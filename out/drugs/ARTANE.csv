3, 3, Shaking hands_ body_ and memory los,Nightmares_ words see different possibly caused by medicine or chemical imbalance as I am on a lot of prescription medicine. Found myself clumsy at times intermittent as it does not happen all the time. Delusions caused by my mental illness that are difficult to deal with. Emotion problems_ pimples even at my age_ and loss of interesting in this I like and lack of interest in sex and feel like I cannot do anything right and loss of confidence and unable to drive a car.,Every medicine has side effects_ even food. Each person has a different body and brain chemistry. What I have as side-effects others may or may not. But I am surving this as even if I am disabled and very sick I am there for my family and friends even if it means I suffer side-effects and am in pain. I studied many methods in prayers and mediation to develop a positive attitude instead of negative attitude and thinking caused by my mental illness and if not then the other prescription medicine I take.Sometimes I am doing great and the slightest distraction or noise or whatever slips my mind out of a positive state and into another one that has me suffer more and in pain. While I need to go to a hospital I am sacrificing my own needs to help my family and friends. But not everyone understands my mental and physical illnesses make me this way and it is not the real me. The real me is kind_ gentle_ compassionate_ but the me with these medicines and illnesses has created delusions that I am other people and many things I say I am sorry for and apologize. I am not making excuses or faking I am surviving it as best I could. Even if the medicine I am taking as directed or suggested (I cannot remember what) by my doctors who are the best in their area I have faith and believe I can get better if I am wrong and I die or get very sick and unable to function at least I did what I could to help others and not sure what will happen to me.,M,42,5  months5 3X D,10/2/2010,Artane

6, 1, Muscle spasms in my neck,Each time I took an Artane tablet I would feel some tightness in my abdominal region.  I also had some irritation in the lungs_ dryness in my sinuses and nostrils_ and dry mouth the next day.  I read where Artane dries the mucous membranes_ so I think that is one reason I had some lung irritation and dryness in my sinuses.  About two hours after taking my third tablet of the day_ I felt extremely spaced out (disoriented_ mental fogginess_ etc.).  I decided to lay off of any Artane and I felt better within 24 hours.  I don't plan on taking this drug again due to these side effects.,,M,46,2  days,9/29/2008,Artane
