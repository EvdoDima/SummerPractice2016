0, 5, Panic Attacks and Insomnia,Drowsiness,I have suffered from GAD and panic disorder since my teens. I have never abused my Xanax and have remained on a low dose for the last 10 years. My anxiety and panic attacks are due to a chemical imbalance and without my antidepressants and Xanax I can't function in life. I got to the point where I couldn't sleep_ eat or work because my panic attacks were so bad. Having a great psychiatrist_ therapist and the right medication helped me get my life back.,F,29,10  years.75mg,8/14/2016,Xanax

3, 5, Severe anxiety. PTSD,No side effects,This med has saved my life. I only use 1/2 the dose I'm suppose to take daily and only when I need it. It helps me fast and has given me my life back slowly. I think it's a great med. Being a (medically retired RN-OIF OEF )  RN I know that you must be responsible with this medication.

It's saving my life from so much I'm going through and giving me the ability to go out again and not stay locked up in the house,I'm VERY careful with this med. I'm careful with all meds including my pain med which is why I'm trusted by doctors to have whatever I need.  Be safe with it and it will help.

6, 5, GAD_ Panic,Slight drowsiness if already fatigued.,"Changed the direction of my life. At what point would an addiction (physiological_ psychological - or both) be preferable to some other condition? I would say when the quality of life with an addiction is infinitely improved when compared to a life without an addiction. One definition of the word ""addiction"" is: ""dependence on or commitment to a habit_ practice_ or habit-forming substance to the extent that its cessation causes trauma"". For me_ anxiety and panic were utterly unbearable. Agoraphobia was creeping in_ and even then staying home offered little more consolation. Traumatic. If I were to stop taking alprazolam_ per the definition of the word ""addiction""_ it would be traumatic. Indeed it would. When a medication's dose isn't increased in years_ is effective at treating the symptoms with very little side effects_ available as a generic_ why cease with the medication? I'm not sure anyone knows if anxiety and panic can be cured_ and I would rather have a mild addiction than live the bleak life I once did.",M,39,8  years.25 mg 2X D,3/15/2016,Xanax
7, 5, Severe Anxiety,None,Xanax is a lifesaver for me. I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks and this medication works immediately and effectively. Makes life tolerable. I love it. I've also tried other benzos_ (klonopin_ valium_ Ativan_ tenazapam) to no avail.,F,39,5  years1mg,3/8/2016Email,Xanax
8, 1, anxiety,terrible fatigue and it will immediately become addicted and constantly having to up your dose. can make you very cloudy and out of focus. after getting to 6mg I couldn't handle it anymore and was put on klonopin with excellent results.,I hate Xanax. my tolerance to it was awful and the dose kept going up and finally I couldn't handle the fatigue. like most benzos its highly addictive and very hard to come off. if you miss a single dose you are in big trouble.,M,43,3  years6mg 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Xanax
9, 1, Anxiety_PTSD_Social Anxiety_ etc.,This drug works fabulously when you first start to take it. That quickly wears off and you need more and more to control your anxiety. It causes fatigue_ mental fogginess_ and short term memory loss for me,I am now a slave to this drug. When I first started taking it I had no idea that it was harder to come off of than heroin. I would never take any drugs of it's class knowing what I know now. I ran out early one time. I had to wait 7 days before I could have it refilled. My withdrawal experience can only be described as hellish.The worst anxiety I have ever had_ panic attacks_ visual and auditory hallucinations_ my body jerking all the time_ seizures_ sweating_ not being able to walk_ tinnitus_ (I hear that all the time now). I could not leave my house_ drive a car_ my husband had to help me get dressed. The only way to get off it is very slowly and most Doctors don't want to deal with that. They try to cut you off a milligram every 2 weeks or something. That just leads to more anxiety. I now obsess about running out of it. I count the pills in the bottle.  When it starts to get low I start to panic. I feel like a junkie but this drug comes from a Doctor and a Pharmacy. If you take this drug please only take a low amount for a few weeks. Don't be in hell like I am!,F,54,10  years10mg 4X D,2/18/2016,Xanax

11, 5, GAD_ Panic Attacks_ OCD,Tiredness_ hunger_ dry mouth,Xanax has been a godsend for me. I have been suffering from severe anxiety to the point where I wouldn't leave the house unless I was going to the ER_ where I was visiting on a weekly basis thinking I was having a heart attack or stroke. I was finally referred to a psychiatrist who prescribed me Xanax and Lexapro. I did ok on this for awhile until the Lexapro made me gain 40lbs and I then I became majorly depressed. I have been on a few others...Klonopin_ Buspar_ and Effexor. All made matters worse. Xanax makes me feel like a normal person again. I can leave the house_ I haven't been to the ER in a long time although I'm still a bit of a hypochondriac. I also find that the Xanax calms my OCD tendencies_ which are excessive cleaning and disinfecting my house. My racing thoughts are calmed and I've lost 30 of that 40lbs. Personally_ Xanax doesn't cause weight for me. It does make me hungry but if I eat something healthy and exercise regularly_ this is not a problem. On Lexapro_ I was working out and eating healthy with no weight loss_ just gain. I looked puffy; not the same type of weight gain as normal. My doctor seems to have no issue with this medication. He's aware that I take it as needed for anxiety and to stop the racing thoughts at night before bed. I would not get on airplanes before this. I now can travel and it's nice to actually get a good nights sleep. I don't need it constantly so if I have to come off of it eventually_ I hope it's not an issue but I do other thin,F,34,5  years1,2/1/2016Email,Xanax

13, 1, Anxiety,Interdose Withdrawls,This stuff is a nightmare.  The rebound anxiety from interdose withdrawals tricks you into thinking your anxiety is getting worse.  Finally during withdrawals- Heard voices_ 24/7 panic attacks_ muscle zaps_ spasms.  Couldn't bathe myself or walk for several days.  Watch out- if your muscles are sore the day after_ you're psychically addicted.,F,30,2  years.5,1/2/2016,Xanax
14, 5, Panic attacks,Dry mouth_ loss of coordination_ trouble focusing_ slurred speech,This drug is the best thing ever. I take a very small dose about .25 MG if I know I'm starting to panic or a whole .5 MG pill if I'm having a panic attack. This is the only thing that completely stops my panic attack. It has kept me from being hospitalized several times. I've taken it for about a month straight before and didn't have a hard time coming off it. I know that it can be addictive and has the risk of being abused but if used correctly for someone with panic attacks it is a life saver.,F,20,8  years.25 MG 1X AN,12/22/2015,Xanax

18, 5, Anxiety_ Panic Disorder_ nausea,Increased appetite_ mild sleepiness_ relaxation_ sometimes lowering of inhibition_ sometimes more emotional. I don't find any of these detrimental_ though.,I have suffered anxiety all my life. When I was younger I suffered extreme emetophobia which led me to always get nauseated during panic attacks. They were a nightmare. I was finally prescribed them around age 17. The first time I ever took them_ 1mg immediately wiped out my anxiety. I've been taking them regularly for four years. I was put on an ssri before regularly taking xanax_ and the ssri (Zoloft) actually made my nausea worse. I have taken other benzodiazepines (klonopin_ valium_ ativan)_ and found xanax to be the most helpful. It is fast acting (I place it under my tongue to dissolve) and immediately cures my anxiety/nausea and enables me to have a healthy appetite. I've had anxiety episodes last for weeks where I could eat nothing and I'd lose weight_ which is bad because I'm already small framed. Managing my anxiety with xanax has given me a healthy weight again_ has helped me do presentations_ get through school and work. It is a miracle drug. I'm currently taking about 1.5 to 2mg a day but will not exceed that as this can be very addictive and has worse withdrawals than most other drugs. For what it's worth_ I can stop taking it for days and have experienced no withdrawals. But I do usually take it daily now. I would recommend it to sufferers of severe anxiety of any kind.,F,24,4  years1mg,11/15/2015,Xanax
19, 5, suffered to 79lbs in mid 90's,I experienced relief_ yet scrutinized. To keep an open man I did try valium however it was too strong_ klonopin didn't agree with my chemistry and broke me out like a teenager and I ventured back to xanax. I'm at a point where I'm getting more guilt and shame again and I I'm about to graduate for substance abuse counseling. However I've never had to increase my dose for the last 15 years.,scared to death because my doctor has moved once again having to go through scrutiny after I get through this crippling anxiety that was so misdiagnosed and the mid 90' and still comes with a stigma,F,37,10  years.5 mg/1.mg,11/10/2015Email,Xanax

After trying so many different ssri's_ that only made me gain weight and actually CAUSED depression_ I realized that this is the ONLY drug that will let me live a semi normal life_ and allow me to leave my house and actually drive on the highway. I am prescribed 1 mg. 3x's a day_ but I only take a half mg 3x's a day due my the fear of addiction. Every once in a while I will have to take an extra half mg_ depending on the curcumstances.

You will feel better just knowing you have the ability to do something about your situation_ instead of a feeling of despair and hopelessness. That is just simply magnificent.

32, 5, Severe anexiety (social),People would notice I was sluggish in the morning_ however I never felt this way,Tried everything even other benzos then my doc gave me this. I had no idea it was addicting or the dangerous withdrawal symptoms. Left my script at parents when I went home for Christmas. I didn't want to drive back and get it so just figured if get it the next weekend. Two days later I had a seizure at work. This was 7 years ago. Now my problem is the high dose I was on for so long and started at such a young age my dependence is frightening and it's not working anywhere near like it used to. I read a study that since your brain is still developing until say age 24 my brain developed on this whopper of a starting dose of Xanax. I'm sorry to say I have to pick some up here and there to feel normal. I went one stent of 14 months without it and I never slept for more the two hours a night and didn't say more than two words to anybody. My brain simply wouldn't work. Just like it was not there. Couldn't do simple things like even watch tv because I had no idea what happened 30 seconds earlier. Does anyone know of any studys that talk about the brain developing on Xanax like mine did. To the point I could take 30MG in a day and not even feel tired. I am doing good making my prescription last and never run out early. But it is always on my mind. I have anxiety over my anxiety just over having my anxiety meds now.,M,37,10  years8 MG,7/29/2015Email,Xanax

No major_ concerning side effects.,This has worked wonders for me. I take it for hangovers when I'm anxious after drinking too much. I take it for public speaking (with Inderal... wonder drugs). I take it for situational anxiety like work meetings. I was worried about the addictiveness_ but I have taken less than 100 pills in 6 years. This is a wonder drug. In situations where I might be anxious_ I take comfort knowing it's in my pocket and normalcy is 15 minutes away_ if necessary.

I stopped that nonsense right away because I truly am debilitated without it. but I don't want anyone thinking oh yeah I got xanax no_ that's not good_ it does make some situations happier or calmer but if you're taking it properly you will get relief from your proper amount. all I'm sayin is don't abuse the privilege of having this helpful little pill in hand just be smart an use your meds safely,F,25,6  years3mg a day,4/17/2015Email,Xanax

This works most days but some days it is out of my control and i have to take xanax. It doesn't make me feel like a zombie_ it just calms me.

I only took one pill and my entire body felt the side effects within 30 minutes of taking the pill with a glass of water I was falling over and I kept feeling this weird feeling of paranoia as if someone was watching me and I was home alone with my fiancé. I was very uncomfortable and for the most part I wished my stomach ache would come back and that the feeling the pill have me would go away I couldn't see anything for a period of about 10 minutes and I don't remember eating or falling asleep my mind today the next day is completely blank after the pill had set in . My fiancé told me he had to pick me up off of the ground 2 times carry me to the bed and that he had to wake me up to check on me multiple times. I will not ever take one of those again. He thought I was going to die in my sleep.,I have also seen others taking this pill some with a prescription and some without one. And it is truly a dangerous drug and that's what scares me and my family so much about it_ it's easy to access far more easy then it should be.

49, 4, Panic Disorder,None,Xanax stopped my panic attacks in their tracks_ especially when dissolved under the tongue. For anxiety management on a day-to-day basis_ I felt my dose was not high enough to prevent -all- anxiety_ but it was strong enough to keep me from panicking. After taking more than my prescription allowed_ I felt calm and euphoric_ but unless I wanted to run out of my prescription early this was not something I did often.

55, 1, Heart palpitations,Terrible anxiety_ irrational fears_ iatrogenic illness that lasted for over a decade.,This drug worked beautifully. At first_ then it became a nightmare. Don't take it. Don't let anyone you care about take it. Please. This is a mind-altering_ highly addictive drug that changes the way your body calms itself down. So much so_ that you may never be the same_ even if you stop taking it. NEVER stop this drug 'cold turkey'. It is dangerous and can lead to a very painful withdrawal syndrome that can last years.

60, 5, GAD_ Panic Attacks_ Agoraphobia,No side effects except for occasional drowsiness. This is seriously a miracle pill. It has helped me get my life back. Before I would not get on an airplane_ drive long distances_ I avoided social situations_ and could barely sit down and relax or focus. I have been through two extremely stressful situations over the past 4 years I.e. my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer which came back after initial diagnosis. I was also assaulted and sexually harassed at work. This has gotten me through it all. Please don't believe the people who say it's dangerous. It is only dangerous if you abuse it! If you use as directed it works as it should. I've tried Klonopin which gave me nightmarish side effects_ Lexapro which made me gain 30 lbs and that gave me more anxiety and borderline depression_ Effexor which made my BP go up so high I was hospitalized for 4 days (high bp runs in the family_ and Buspar which didn't even touch my anxiety. I can go for days without taking xanax and I dont get withdrawal so maybe I am just lucky and it agrees with my body chemistry but it has truly made a huge difference in my quality of life.,,F,33,4  years1MG,9/15/2014Email,Xanax
61, 5, Anxiety,None. This is a wonder drug if used as prescribed. Xanax saved my life.,I was on this drug for 12 years without ever having to increase the dose. No anxiety_ no depression. About two years ago I decided that it was probably of no benefit to me any longer because of all the literature about the body building up a tolerance for it. I weened myself off it 1% a week. Took me two year but absolutely no withdrawal symptoms at all. After I got off it all my anxiety returned. My conclusion. Like any drug it will affect different people in different ways. Just because it can be addictive doesn't mean you will get addicted. You may become dependant but if it works_ keep using it. I should never have stopped using it. Now I am on Valium which my Doctor says is safer. Time will tell.,M,51,12  years1mg 3X D,8/31/2014,Xanax

63, 4, Anxiety,When it comes to dealing with severe_ recurring anxiety_ this drug works best than many that I have. The only problem is that the longer I have taken it_ the more the dosages have been increased. I currently take 4 1 mg tablets a day. I have a new doctor that I am now seeing and he is trying to see if he can get it lowered from 4 times a day_ down to two. He wants me to try another medication in addition with Xanax to see if this combo will help to better lower my anxiety. I will be seeing my doctor next month to talk about this_ as I already have an appt scheduled with him. I have a sensitive stomach_ and alot of pills don't agree with me. Plus_ i currently have a healthy appetite and i would like to keep it that way. Hopefully_ I will end up with a pill that won't cause me to catch severe dizzy spells or severe nausea or vomiting_ which i fear the most when it comes to taking pills period.,The best medication out there for anxiety.

It completely makes me feel normal_ calm_ and peaceful.  All anxiety felt in the area of my solar plexus vanishes.Xanax is not addictive as some have written_ but one can become psychologically dependent.  Unless one has panic attacks or extreme anxiety_ .25 or .50 mg once maybe twice a day should be very sufficient for the vast majority of people.  My physician prescribed .50 mg up to three times per day.  The most I ever took was 1 mg once or twice when my anxiety was high.  It really helps with my depression as well_ and the affect lasts about 24 hours for me.  Some begin feeling anxious in 3-8 hours after initial dosage.,M,54,1  years.5 mg 1X AN,3/16/2014,Xanax
71, 1, Anxiety/Stress,For anyone out there trying to seek an escape from life's problems_ please don't take this. You'll ruin you're life. Not only will you grow a literally deadly dependence of this drug(whether you think you will or not) but it will almost completely erase your memory from the previous night/day. If you take this with alcohol then you will most definitely regret this as it is not like any other medication with alcohol. This will completely floor you and you WILL do something that risks your life or others. Xanax is helpful IF you actually have severe stress/anxiety problems.

I am now emotionless.,My psychiatrist sent me to sleep studies and all types of tests. He said Xanax wouldn't do this. Go to Benzo Buddies.org. Do not take for more then 2 weeks. You'll become an addict. It will make your original anxiety worse. When I stopped sleeping_ I was actually in withdraw_ although I didn't stop medication. Your body builds a tolerance fast. You'll have to do an expensive hospital detox ($7K cash) and you'll still be screwed up for years. XANAX is a POISON and it will destroy you_ you family_ your finances. This is no joke and I am sane (although the damage done to me is overwhelming). Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac says Xanax destroyed 8 years of her life. Xanax permanently changes how your brain works.

The Xanax doses in the middle relieve quite rapidly my panic/anxiety_ and the morning and evening doses of Xanax XR provide me with an undercurrent of long-term day/night-long anxiety/panic relief.

It's when you increase your dose_ start to build that higher and higher tolerance that you run into addiction issues. I also skip it on nights when I feel really tired_ for example if I've worked outside a lot on the yard_ etc. I don't feel tied to taking it ""or else"".

I can do at least some of the things I enjoy again_ and can function on my job (which was in jeopardy before Xanax). I have not needed a dosage increase since I started the drug_ so I'm not developing a tolerance. My advice to you is this: try everything else before you try Xanax. But if nothing has worked_ I mean absolutely nothing including non-medicinal things like psychotherapy_ and if you cannot function any more due to your anxiety_ and you have no life left_ then go on Xanax.

It destroyed my life so fast I didn't even know what was happening to me.  Of course the doctors never told me how bad this drug was_ how insidious.  I lost my life to Xanax and am now off of it but the damage has been done..literally_ the damage has been done to my nervous system and my body is trying to heal.  It takes so long.  Do not even be tempted with this drug unless you are into playing Russian Roulette.

102, 1, anxiety,Tolerance withdrawal soon developed.  Very very sick for 5 years before anyone identified the cause of xanax tolerance withdrawal. Took me almost 2 years to get off this awful chemical.  Major GABA receptor damage.,Symptoms were tachycardia_ chest pain/pressure_  major GI pain_ nausea_ cramps_ diarrhea_ skin rash_ itching_ insomnia_ rebound anxiety_ burning eyes_ tingling in hands and feet_ headaches_ joint/muscle aches_ fatigue.

Other than that my experience has been very good taking Xanax.,I was prescribed Xanax after losing both my parents within a 18 month period. I found that as I got older I was less able to cope with stress at work and stressful situations. I was becoming depressed and had bouts with anxiety.Xanax has been a life saver for me.

104, 5, Panic disorder with agoraphobia,Sedation,I was prescribed Xanax to help calm me down whenever I would have severe panic attacks in public and needing something to work quickly. I used to go to the ER afraid I was having a heart attack and that got expensive real quick. I kept the Xanax on my person as an emergency backup in case an attack hit_ and sometimes just knowing it was there in my pocket if I needed it helped and I didn't have to actually use it. When I did use it_ it helped stop the panic attack quickly and enabled me to regain my composure. On the rare occasions I took it at night_ it made me very sedated and complacent and I slept heavily. This could easily become addictive. Now I still have a script for it but I rarely ever take it. Great for panic attacks_ but be careful.,M,28,2  years0.5 2X AN,3/16/2013Email,Xanax

106, 5, Anxiety,Ive struggled to control anxiety over the years. During the really bad times I turned to Zoloft and Celexa. These days my life is more in order so I don't need a daily medication. I have been using this drug for 10 years for various anxiety issues as needed. I can honestly say that I can still take half of a .25 and feel normal 80 percent of the time without needing more. I never allowed myself to take it more than 3 days in a row without a break fearing an addiction or building up a tolerance like many of the people I know.  If used correctly it can certainly change your life for the better. I recommend it to anyone that doesn't have addiction issues that suffers from anxiety.,,F,34,10  years.25,1/28/2013,Xanax
107, 5, Anxiety,Sleepiness,I was prescribed Xanax for anxiety and though was allowed 1-2 daily as needed_ I have chosen to only take half to one pill as needed when I start to feel overly anxious.  I have also tried to resolve my anxiety by participating in a cognitive behavioral therapy clinical trial_ as well as personal research on that method of treatment.  When I start to feel anxious_ I first try to calm myself with CBT and that usually works.  However_ there are times when no amount of mind-over-matter will calm my racing heart and half a Xanax does the trick.  I'll take a full pill if I'm flying anywhere.  I understand the medicine can be addictive_ however_ anxiety can be treated in so many ways that I highly recommend trying a non-medicinal approach to try for lasting results and using the Xanax on an as-needed basis.  Doing so eliminates the risk of dependency as you learn ways to calm your anxiety without medicine.  Using Xanax (or any other drug) as a supplement to behavioral therapy or even talk therapy_ rather than as a substitute_ is_ in my opinion_ an effective way to address anxiety.  I hope to some day be skilled enough at CBT and at being able to recognize and avoid my triggers (when reasonable) that I can eliminate the need to medicate.  Until then_ half a Xanax every other week or so hasn't given me a single side effect and I haven't had a single thought or action that hints at addiction.,F,41,2  years25 mg 1X D,1/1/2013,Xanax
108, 5, Bipolar panic and anxiety disorder,Xanax has been a blessing to me. I struggled with severe panic and anxiety attacks. The take your breath_ feel like you're having a heart attack kind. After taking a Xanax I would feel much calmer within 20 minutes. Some days are worse than others so I may not have to take my entire prescribed dose every day_ but I always make sure I take a couple to prevent anxiety from coming and prevent withdrawal from happening.

113, 1, Anxiety,Depression_ serious addiction_ worsened anxiety over time.  AVOID THIS DRUG!,yes_ xanax will calm you down but it will also make you completely numb_ dependent and over time even MORE anxious as you work to manage the new anxiety of addiction.  My life literally became me waiting for my next dose_ and panicking that I would lose my pills or somehow not be able to take them_ because the withdrawal from this drug is so immediate and so harsh that it is not worth taking to begin with.  The only country in the world that prescribes benzos for more than a 2 weeks period is in the USA.  There is a reason for that_ and it is Big Pharma.  If you want to be a drug-addicted shell of a person then by all means take this drug.  But I promise you over time it will destroy your life and your brain.  PLEASE AVOID!

I was numb the whole time I was taking them and didn't realize truly how numb and insensitive I was until I got off them. Unfortunately_ I didn't realize that stopping them cold turkey was so horrible. I truly just wanted to die for the first 3 days I came off them and didn't feel normal until 2 weeks after.

118, 5, Panic disorder with agoraphobia,Sleepiness,I owe a lot to this drug. After suffering frequent panic attacks that put me in the ER followed by agoraphobia (fear of leaving my house)_ I was put on this at 0.5 MG twice a day. Simply put_ it saved me from a life of living in fear of having another attack all day and finally allowed me to leave my home to go do regular things like shopping or going to the movies. Sometimes it would make me tired_ but drinking a caffeinated soda or a cup of tea or coffee always helped. I experienced no side effects other than sweet relief from my crippling anxiety. Now I only take it as-needed when I feel I'm going to have a bad day or I have to face a big challenge_ like going out of town. I haven't had to use any for a while because I think just the confidence of having it in my pocket is enough to ward off any anxiety. It works quickly_ especially if you let it dissolve under the tongue (be sure to drink a soda or something with it while doing that_ though_ because the taste is horrible). In short_ I am so thankful for this drug and now I have my life back.,M,27,3  years0.5 MG 2X D,9/13/2012Email,Xanax

I take one or two pills about an hour before an anxiety inducing situation and I feel calm and collected - I don't get sweaty and anxious like I normally would. Unlike others I don't get any euphoric feeling from it_ actually quite the opposite_ I usually want to go home early from an event as I'm not having much fun. Drinking on Xanax is dangerous as I don't ever feel drunk or even tipsy_ so I will drink way more than I normally would or should - I don't recommend ever drinking while taking this medication.

134, 3, Anxiety,Increased emotional instability,I took XANAX for 8 months 1x per day (at night) and only 1 MG. Initially I enjoyed the feeling of relaxed contentment that occurred when I took the drug. Moreover_ it really helped me sleep and stay asleep. I felt less anxious for a brief time however this was quickly countered by irrational emotional outburts such as crying for reasons ranging from how my hair looked to things I saw on TV. My husband could not look at me the wrong way and I would react negatively. I can only compare it to PMS only I felt this way ALL THE TIME! I became very quick to anger and began to experience genuinely paranoid thoughts. The last straw came a couple of weeks ago when I picked a 3 day (yes 3 day) fight with my loving and kind husband for a reason so ridiculous I am too embarrassed to reveal it. It ended on day three with us both utterly exhausted_ near the brink of divorce and me sobbing uncontrollably. I quit taking the drug cold turkey. The first night was unpleasant_ I had racing thoughts and simply could not get to sleep. Fortunately the second night was  bit better and I am now back to normal by which I mean my emotions have returned to what they were prior to XANAX.

It drifts me into a nice sleep_ doesn't feel like I got hit in the head by a hammer.  I started at .25 and eventually worked up to 2 mg every night.  There were times when even that wouldn't work_ so I'd half another tablet.  It got to the point where I would take them during the day if I was feeling very anxiour or stressed about something.  Needless to say_ it became consuming.  And then the time would come that I'd run out of my Xanax and not have any for a week.  The withdrawals were the worst thing I can describe.  I was sweaty_ nervous_ paranoid_ crying and emotional for no reason_ agitated_ and extremely annoyed by everything and anyone.

My Dr. shouldn't prescribe this evil med to me since it almost ruined my life.  To be honest_ I feel much better of not taking it. I have been completely off of Xanax for almost 2 months_ I still feel the withdrawal symptoms (dizziness_ blurry vision_ anxious speech_ confusion_ difficult to concentrate_ anxiety) almost everyday. I started cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) a month ago for my GAD_ it is quite helpful and no side effect at all.

161, 3, anxiety,memory loss_ drowsiness_ low inhibitions.,Xanax is great for short term use in low dosages. It becomes highly addictive over a long period of time.

Being anxious makes these all the worse_ of course. Xanax gave me absolutely no issues.,"It is extremely effective and fast-acting. I could not live without it. Although I have tried alternatives over the years_ this is the one my doctors and I prefer. In all the years I have taken it_ I have not increased my dosage. I still take a 1/2 MG pill and break it half yet again. I would caution that there is a dependency_ but this is like saying a diabetic is dependent on insulin. If I wasn't lacking sufficient amounts of GABA_ I wouldn't need Xanax. That's logical. You don't get addicted_ you just feel badly if your body requires a chemical to stabilize and it is deprived. Doctors now have relaxed the hysteria about Xanax being "" addictive"". They push pills with pharma kickbacks_ and Xanax is no longer one of them.

I took it a couple times a day and kept my dosage low_ but I still had a lot of trouble after I quit. (Despite tapering VERY slowly.) I'd recommend starting with a drug like Valium before using Xanax_ personally. Xanax is quicker acting_ but comes with a lot of baggage. The best thing to do is to use benzos as-needed_ but not every day. OR_ if you use them every day... pick a longer acting drug and use enough to help calm you_ and then make a PLAN to get off_ and taper very slowly.

It was like having a panic attack for 3 hours_ when it finally started wearing off. AWFUL. Will never take again. I know it works for alot of people_ but I'll stick with tranxene or valium.

I went to the ER 7 times in 2010 to get migraine treatment_ and ever since I started the Xanax (plus Reglan 10MG for nausea) I have not had to go to the ER for relief.  I have noticed that Xanax causes serious ""munchies""_ but I could stand to gain a few pounds.  Oh yeah...be careful with this one... LOSS OF BALANCE.",In addition to Xanax & Reglan_ I also take 100 MG of Lamictal_ 10 MG of Lexapro_ and 500 MG of Valtrex daily.  The Lamictal sometimes causes insomnia and I'll take 1/2 or a whole Xanax to help get to sleep.  Of course_ I wake up about 6-7 hours later whereas I am accustomed to getting 9 hours of sleep per night.

Xanax is really just a band-aid for me. It deals with the problem when it is occurring_ but it does not prevent me from having a daily panic personality. after all of the years I've taken it_ instantly after ingesting it I feel much less panicked due to placebo effect_ because it is a guarantee to lessen the anxiety. I take them when I am having a panic attack_ and rather than having a moderately bad one for a few hours_ the pill ends it in ten minutes or less.,F,20,8  years0.25 1X AN,4/25/2011Email,Xanax
177, 1, Anxiety,"Side EffectsWhen I stopped taking it (2 months ago) i was up to 1mg x3 times a day. I suffered from general anxiety_ phobias and panic attacks.  Something worth noting as a woman it caused non stop ""yeast infection-like"" symptoms. I had been told I needed to resort to using boric acid inserts for the rest of my life along with hydrocortisone suppositories. Sex was horrible_ and my partner and myself had undergone countless testing and treatments even though we were monogamous and the doctors were convinced it was an STD. Lo and behold Charles linden reported the same symtoms as me and they magically disappeared within 2 weeks of me stopping Xanax after having them for 18 months (INCLUDING 3 Months of celibacy while going through my divorce) Xanax I believe is a crutch it doesn't make the symptoms go away: you know- the pounding heart_ the sweatiness_ the feeling like you are going to pass out or soil yourself or get locked in a room. My anxiety becasme stronger on this drug",Additional ThoughtsI am a chemist who works in the pharmaceutical field. I have worked on several drugs and know their affects. I never thought this would control my life the way that it has. In severe cases by all means follow your doctor's perscribed direction but don't see this as a long term solution becasue I originally started this drug to get over fear of flying.

But in general_ it really_ really_ helps prevent me from having anxiety and panic attacks_ and I would just be in school trying to pay attention in class but my breathing would get ridiculous_ my lungs would feel like they were almost sealed or other times that my throat was reduced to a microscopically thin airway that felt like it wouldn't be sufficient for me to survive for the next few minutes. But yeah I mostly took this twice a day_ but I'm starting to feel more often like I should take it 3 times a day_ but by the way I am also taking Citalopram_ I just wanna mention that Xanax wasn't able to fully do the job with taking an SSRI as much as SSRI's freaked me out because I was like_ I'm not exactly depressed_ I'm more just really anxious_ why are these doctors trying to give me antidepressants... just seems weird_ I was pretty sure I just had a breathing problem or something. But what's obvious from these forums_ is that everybody does have a different experience_ and don't assume that you can predict how a medication will effect you before taking it_ it is simply a guessing game and you're gonna try to think of how it might effect you before you take it_ but unfortunately you do really have to experience it to understand whether it's good for you personally or,M,24,8  months.5 mg 3X D,3/30/2011Email,Xanax

188, 1, anxiety,I would avoid this drug if at all possible and any other benzo. In Nov 09 went off of valium after 5 years a small dose at night and never took during the day. About a month later a doctor prescribed me a megadose of xanax 200 xanax pills. He wanted me to take all throughout the day. I was petrified when I got this huge bottle of pills after all the press I have read on Xanax throughout the years. I didnt take but the two or three pills ( I forget the actual mg they prescribed) and tried to give it back to a couple of MDS but they say they wouldnt take it off my hands. After second MD said that I was wise not to take but couldnt take I kept and a week or two later a month after I got it prescribed I started to take one pill in AM and night and later 3_ AM afternoon and night.,The medication was scary cause it made me want. I wasnt smoking pot at the time and never have been a drinker at all but the only way I can describe this medication is that I felt like what an alcholic probably feels like craving that pill that a drink. I found out it leaves your system quick and thats why. I would never reccmend any type of benzo there is nothing glamourous about this class of drugs espcially this one. Sure it gave me a feeling of calmness but couple that with moodiness and the cravings it develops on your body its just not worth taking. I have heard alot of horror stories about this drug for decades and see where that comes from. There are a multitude of meds out there that can help the same symptoms and cant understand why this drug is still prescribed so liberally. I was really happy to not take this med. I did fine over all on no pills for the past year but did go on a month ago 25 mg of Elavil a day at night and so far that seems to curb anxiety and seems alot more beneficial on your body cause it works in a different manner and seems to not have a withdrawal and craving effect.I was able to go off the Xanax that I took til the bottle ran out but it I couldnt wait for them to be gone and the medication out of my system. I would never take this medication again under any circumstances. They seem to addictive and when I was on it for the two months it made me feel like I was living from pill to pill.

209, 1, Anxiety,Felt extremely sedated_ even on a lower amount. Doctors_ in general_ will not tell you the truth about this drug.  Unknowingly became tolerant to my dose amount and began experiencing interdose withdrawal a short time after I started taking it.  This drug completely derailed my life and made my anxiety so much worse to the point of becoming homebound and agoraphobic.  I finally figured out what was going on and got off the xanax.  Subsequently_ my anxiety is so much better_ but I am left with many other problems.  If you think your anxiety (or whatever problem you are dealing with) is bad now_ try some benzos and see what real hell is waiting for you.  Do the research_ people!  Consider alternative modes of dealing with your problems before opening this can of worms.,"I strongly advise people to stay away from this drug and any of the benzodiazepines!  They should not be prescribed_ or at the very least_ MUCH more regulated.  They cause dependence (sometimes after very short-term usage) and the risks can be incredibly severe.  I am currently in month four of severe benzo withdrawal.  This stuff is worse than heroin.  I had over 50 symptoms_ some of which you would not even begin to fathom.  This has been my worst nightmare.  I am doing better and am down to about 15 or 20 symptoms_ but am told withdrawal can last and healing can take 6-18 months.  It influences your GABA production_ and_ as I understand it_ can actually damage your GABA receptors.  This does not fix itself quickly.  It takes the brain and body much time to heal.There are some people who will argue that they can take these drugs and get off of them without incident_ but how can you know if you will be one of the ""lucky ones""??  The doctors will deny all of this until they are blue in the face_ unfortunately.  Just don't trust everything your doctor says.  Be your own advocate.",F,33,2.5  yearsVaried 1X D,9/14/2010,Xanax

My doc prescribed it to help me deal with pre-wedding stress.  It calms me down within an hour of taking it.  I can finally relax and stop at yelling at people while planning my wedding.  I know this drug has been said to be addictive_ but I am on SUCH a small dose.  I've been taking .25 mg as needed (which has been every other day or so).  The first time I took it_ I tried .5 mg and it was too strong (I only weigh 120 lbs).  I fell asleep in 5 minutes and was groggy the next day).  I'm really happy with the small dose_ as it calms me without making me too tired.  I have also found that if I take it in the morning_ I can have a glass of wine at night and be fine.

I would not recommend anyone take this drug if you have to be fully functional and/or drive b/c it definitely affects your ability to react...it makes me feel sleepy (I get a great night's sleep when I take it at night).,F,28,4  years.25-.50 mg 1X AN,9/2/2010,Xanax

215, 5, Anxiety,"Dry mouth and throat_ ""light headedness""_ some difficulty with urination. Helps relaxe me.",Everyone seems to react to this drug differently. Some love it and some dont. You can not know or take anyone elses experience_ you need to try for yourself. Start with low dose as recommended and do not exceed 4mg per day. Doses should be spaced out through the day and not bunched up at a particular time of day when you are most likely to have anxiety_ avoid the temptation to double dose when having a bad time. Can be EXTREMLY addictive_ so the lowest dose you can get by with should be used. Trying to get off this stuff at high dose (over 4mg_ but could be lower depending on the person) can be PURE NIGHTMARE HELL. On the other hand_ it DOES work for most folks_ so ONLY take it as directed and avoid the temptation to sneak in a little daily increase. Also_ withdraw symptems are different for different people.

I usually don't need to take another pill until the next time I feel the panic setting in (which is only a few times a year).

I had no idea that Xanax is as addictive as heroin.  Burning chills_ vomiting and diareha all at the same time.  Leg cramps and pains_ headaches_ nightmares_ restlessness.

Doctor first hadme on paxil but I got serotonin syndrome from it and refused to take anything else but xanax..I wanted a pill I didnt have to take every single day!! I wanted something to work when I started having a panic attack and would be gone in a few hours..my doc doesnt want me on xanax but I only take it when I REALLY need it..so I can go weeks without having a panic attack ..just carrying it around makes me feel better to know that I have a solution to my panic attacks.

The attacks were so bad that I felt like I was in an outside world 24/7. I stayed home for a constant 2 weeks because I was scared to leave my house. Once I started Xanax_ I was able to go back to work and start back in my normal routine. I still suffered from panic attacks but they no longer controlled my life. I did have to wean off of the drugs as I got better but it was no big deal at all. My doctor gave me directions on how to wean down and it was successful.

Xanax is not strong compared to other drugs and what I like best about it is that it doesn't make me feel weird or fatigued. I just feel relaxed.

I was put on the Xanax extended release twice a day for anxiety due to an anxiety attack that I had from an allergic reaction to Advil.  After a few days of taking it_ I didn't like the way I felt.  I tried to go off gradually by going from .5 to .25 twice a day.  My brain would not let me reduce the dosage without SEVERE side effects.  It took me FIVE weeks to ween off a drug that I was only on for five days.  I finally went to ER in week three I was so desperate.  The doctor there gave me Vistaril to counter the withdrawals.  I finally was able to stop using it.  I continued to take the Vistaril which is not addictive for another two weeks in case I had any residual effects from the Xanax.  I wish I had never started that awful drug and no matter what anyone says_ it's awful to go off of once you take it on a regular basis...even only five days.  By the way...the doctor in ER told me that if you have a car accident while on Xanax_ it's the same as drunk driving.  If someone dies_ you go to jail.,F,49,5  days.5 2X D,6/23/2010,Xanax

231, 3, sleep onset,drowsiness_ relaxation_ need to eat,Wow. What can I say about Xanax. It is a bittersweet solution to my anxiety at night and problems sleeping. I am a survivor of incest and other forms of sexual abuse and I suspect that the problems with sleeping is related to the abuse. As I have gotten older and more spiritual ironically it is more difficult for me to be relaxed at night and fall asleep. I have more psychic experiences that scare the crap out of me AND I do energy/healing work. Go figure. I take Xanax and it has worked so well for me and I am clearly addicted. When I ran out of it and couldn't see a doctor I had a very bad withdrawal that freaked me out. I KNOW this is not the answer and in time I will be off it. I also am a recovering alcoholic so the awareness of addiction makes it more challenging for me to take this medication with a peace of mind.I should add when I get migraines it helps me so much to take 1.0 and my migraine medication.

236, 3, Anxiety,No side effects - possibly some Nausea but I am not convinced that it was the Xanax causing it as my diet becomes very erratic when I am in a major anxiety phase.,Made me a little drowsy after the first dose but I had previously taken Clonazepam at 1.5mg per day and I mistakenly thought that I could wean off the Clonazepam by switching to Xanax at a lower dose but I now realise that is not the case as they are like for like in potency.  Xanax is way to short acting for me and I was in danger of popping 0.5mg every 4 hours just to try and keep myself steady.  I have switched back to the clonazepam as I really need the longer lasting effect plus clonazepam just seems to work a little better than the Xanax for me.  I am not ruling out trying Xanax again in the future but I think that the prescribed dosage is too low for a Benzo addict like me (been taking Clonazepam for nearly 4 years and have 'upped' the dosage from time to time).,F,44,3  days0.5mg 2X D,5/24/2010,Xanax

I used to always get panic attacks because I can't deal with repetitive sound (pen clicking_ tapping_ repetitive noise_ repetitive sneezing - i know_ weird). I also take it when conflict arises because I get REALLY freaked out and start shaking. It does wear off after awhile but then I find that I don't need it again. I have taken 2 at a time at rare instances but when this happens I have to lay down because I become useless and dysfunctional. I don't find Xanax addictive.

All because some self righteous doctor was against Benzos. Xanax is a miracle drug and doses less than 2mg a day will be metabolized by your liver and out of your system before they become a problem.

For the record_ I have tried EVERYTHING_ including Klonipin (which causes depression)_ Ativan (I hated the way it acted on my brain)_ all SSNRI's_ Ambien (bad drug)_ Valium (my psych says it is the WORST OUT THERE)_ SO YOU be the judge of your ownn brain take responsibility for what you put in  your body_ Xanax has a ""life"" of approximately 4-5 hours in your system.  It is the safest drug out there for anxiety.  Don't listen to these people who say it is the drug from hell_ etc.  It works_ it calms and yes it is addictive but you be the judge_ treat your brain just as you do any other organ in your body.

252, 5, Panic Disorder_ Anxiety_ Insomnia,If used responsibly as I have done_ little or no side effects.,To the previous female poster who was surprised to awake in the morning on her 5th day of Xanax use and experience anxiety; in my 16 yrs. of Xanax use I have never taken more then .5 mg. in any given day. My use has been .25 mg. taken at bedtime. When I wake up the sleepiness is gone but the positive effect is still felt throughout the day. Look through all the posts and you will see most of the people having problems are taking way too much. Xanax is a very powerful drug and needs to be respected. That means taking the lowest possible dose for a positive effect. Instead of taking .5 mg. twice a day_ try .125 mg. twice a day. Also_ try to take drug holidays; go off of them for a couple of days so your body doesn't get too used to them. I do it all the time without any problems.,M,57,16  years.25 mg. 1X D,3/30/2010,Xanax
253, 4, Anxiety,Sleepiness.,I only take this drug if absolutely necessary. I know its extremely easy to get addicted and abuse it. I only use this drug if I feel extreme anxiety and can't sleep. It really helps you sleep and the next day you feel so much better. I started this drug due to a death in the family that was devastating to me. They last me forever because I only take a half of one or a whole in extreme circumstances. I only recommend this drug if you can control yourself and take it occasionally when needed. If you take it regularly_ you will get addicted. Rated 4 for addictive quality. Otherwise its awesome! Don't recommend driving or doing any intense on it.,F,43,8  years.25 mgs 1X AN,3/29/2010,Xanax

I think it is alot less harmful than alcohol. i dont drink.  i am only taking 0.25 mgms and sometimes only take half doses. otherwise i see no problem taking it for the rest of my life. i have only upped the dose in crises_ such as family deaths_ divorce etc._ so i dont abuse it.,M,62,25  years0.25 3X D,2/24/2010,Xanax

272, 2, anxiety,All the side effect were wonderful_ it was the withdrawal that was hell.,If you do research you'll find that Xanax is the most widely abused pharmaceuticals in the world_ and for good reason. It's impossible to have a panic attack while on it. But I've found from taking normal doses myself_ and observing other people who were also not abusing it_ that it should simply be a short term drug. You really have to have a diagnosis of panic disorder to be on it. How many of the people on it do you think really have panic disorder? I'm not saying it doesn't exist_ I used to have it. I'm just saying it is hyped up_ which has made this drug very_ very popular and unfortunately many people taking it for normal use have absolutely no idea how addicting it really is. When I discontinued use_ I had to be hospitalized. Suddenly_ in an office meeting I felt like I was driving down a steep mountain with no breaks. Felt like crawling out of my skin_ while all my coworkers looked at me like they thought I was about to go postal. From the research I read_ a tolerance to a normal dose can develop in as little as a week. If you're thinking about getting on this medication_ do yourself a favor and don't take it very long. If you're getting on it just for kicks_ you won't listen to anything I'm saying anyway. That being said_ I think it is a wonderful medication for short term use.

275, 1, my husband does for anxiety,When not taking Xanax on a very regular basis_ the side effects are unbelievable at least from an observer of so much bizarre behavior.   This is a short lived drug and apparently some people cannot take it as a PRN.  My husband when home often just skips the dose for reasons I do not understand and turns from a person with a flat affect into a man that is filled with rage and anger.  So far no physical abuse but tremendous psychological abuse is tossed my way.  Wondered if I was a trigger but 3 shrinks have said no.   He has been on that medication for over 20 years and obviously is addicted but not respectful of that fact.,His thinking can get very warped.  He had blackouts and memory loss and after he finally explodes verbally_ seems to need 24 hours sleep.   He seems to a great extent unaware of what happens and while he has a therapist he sees once every six weeks to get an Rx_ after 3 or 4 years I have never been allowed to even speak with her.  I doubt sincerely if she has any idea of what is going on.   My husband also adds liquor to the Xanax at times and I suspect that isn't helpful.   Based on reading things here it is apparent that this drug operates differently on different people but given that_ I do believe psychiatrists have an obligation to check with relatives and to do any testing that might indicate other problems.   My husband is in my mind mentally ill and because I wouldn't leave him if he had a physical disease I have tried very hard to learn about this benzo and to try to find coping skills to help me.  We may be close to reaching the end of the line and while I know he loves me and it would break his heart (different though it is)_ it is finally taking a physical toll on me that is serious.This drug has altered his personality and while he is somewhat aware of it_ he won't deal with it because the obvious losses of memory and a sense of shame have him hooked to the point where he can't admit the truth.    Psychiatry can be very dangerous.   My husband is just really paying to get a prescription:  no therapy is involved at all.  It's a business.,F,68,20  years,1/17/2010,Xanax

I take .5 mgs when I'm out somewhere feeling anxious or flashback-y and it helps. If I'm having a panic attack I'll take the 1mg. It wasn't easy getting a prescription for this either - a lot of doctors hesitate because of the addiction factor.

As long as it's not abused and you have a vigilant doctor_ it could possibly improve your life to the point of functioning again. I keep a couple in my purse in case of an attack.

281, 5, anxiety and panic attacks,Was put on drug along w/ clomipramine when hospitalized for suicidality 25 years ago. Still on both. History of OCD_ anxiety worsened by marijuana_ psychedelics. Drug works really well except for time delay 15-20 minutes_ but now I anticipate better and avoid this problem.  Even greatly helped me write exams years ago on moderate dose; relaxation resulting in better recall. Coffee and xanax do not cancel out  I get the best of both_ relaxed and alert. But hungover if too much the day before_ sometimes with flu-like aches. Helps immeasurably with stressful social situations.,Smoked pot again about 10 years ago just a couple of times and xanax didn't work anymore. Put on antipsychotics. After several months gave them up and am fine on xanax. Was concerned about addiction. Told 4 mg daily is threshold for that_ but alcohol use seriously lowers threshold. Originally I'd been on 2 mg daily plus horrible halcion in the same family (see my halcion entry 3/10/2009). Now on 3 mg daily_ usually in 2 installments. Drug is wasted on a full stomach! One shrink said I might as well throw it in toilet if I've eaten first. However_ once I take it_ with LOTS of fluid_ I wait 10 minutes and then eat; otherwise hunger keeps me anxious because of low blood sugar (part of problem with pot). Once was off antidepressants 5 weeks: my sexuality went from nil to like a teenager; kept taking xanax which had no negative effects in this dept. BEWARE withdrawal if quitting or cutting down. Cold turkey from xanax or any benzodiazepine can literally kill you from stroke; even fast cutting down can easily lead to seizure. Anyway_ couldn't live without this drug_ which_ like all benzos_ is based on brain's own GABA antianxiety chemistry; but I've read (non-medical) just buying GABA may not work because of something to do with blood/brain barrier. I don't understand this so do your own research.,M,63,25  years,12/8/2009,Xanax

After only about a week on it_ if I didn't take the next dose I felt the withdrawal symptoms. I experienced worse anxiety between doses and eventually stomach pains/bloating. It's highly addictive. I've used this drug in the past just to help me with my fear of flying. One dose and that was it. But a longer duration just didn't work for me.

I can physically function with Xanax where as with other anti-anxiety drugs would make me go to sleep. Sure I got a warm fuzzy feeling_ but that's what Benzodiazipenes are supposed to do.

I would take Tylenol PM_ benadryl_ excedrin PM_ melatonin.. OTC meds which used to work so well on me.  None worked.   I ended up on Xanax to combat my anxiety after my fathers death.. and started noticing that my headache/migraine frequency/severity had been lessened - having about 50-75% decline per month.  It has been amazing for me.  I know there are risks of dependency_but if you're a chronic migraine sufferer -- you will know what that ANYTHING that relieves that pain is worth it...

298, 1, Anxiety / Panic Attacks,The Xanax works wonderfully when you are on it. However_ if you have been on it for longer than a few months_ go ahead and try stopping it. You won't be able to because Xanax withdrawal creates anxiety and panic attacks. It's one of the most ironic things about this drug is that the drug itself causes anxiety when you don't take it. It took me 4 months to ween myself off the drug and was very difficult. I encourage anybody taking this drug long term to reconsider. It is very addictive after only a few weeks.,If you must take this drug_ only take it during extreme panic attacks_ no more than once a week. If you are taking it on a regular basis you will get hooked on it. I have spoke to several other people who experienced Benzo Withdrawal like I did. It is not a fun thing. I felt like I was having a heart attack every day not on this drug. Don't let this happen to you.,M,33,1.5  years,8/8/2009Email,Xanax

Instead of calming me_ it made me even more upset and I ended up crying all night long.  But I haven't seen on this board anyone else with my experience so maybe it's really rare.  Maybe I should try it again one day when I'm not upset_ just to see if it really was the drug causing these problems.

323, 4," ""Excessive Worrying""",Xanax is a side effect in itself!!! The more you take the more you'll NEED to take! It's a creeping vicious cycle! The withdraw is hell! Save yourself the agony_ and don't start taking them in the first place!,Although I'm on the lowest dose 0.5_ my body adapted to it very quickly. It's highly addictive! I am weaning myself off! I've decided it's worse to become a slave to xanax than it is to worry to much. I've cut my dosing down to 1/2 pill at dinner time_ then the other 1/2 before bedtime. I thought weaning from 150mg Effexor to 37.5mg was going to be tough. My humble advise - don't take this medication unless you truly NEED too. The MORE you take the xanax the MORE you'll need to take it! I'm sitting here typing this and feel the withdraw symptoms rearing their ugly head. I refuse to take it! If I give in I'll only feel better for a short time. It will just make it harder the next time. I'll have to sit here and ride through the chills_ sweats_ and desire to take another dose. The withdraws will settle down eventually. They come in waves. Their like a roller coaster! You feel them coming_ you close your eyes and go with them_ then they pass. I don't know how long this coaster will go up and down_ but I refuse to let this beat me. I'll tell you one thing_ I'll NEVER take these again. It's unbelievable how quickly my body got adjusted to them. I can feel my body craving them. Addiction? I would have never believed it possible on such a small milligram_ and for such a short time.

I have never used Xanax to get high and I don't have an addictive personality.  I don't drink when I take it.  I am so sick of people making me feel bad for taking this.  Nothing else helps my panic or agoraphobia. I have taken on,F,28,5  years,2/10/2009,Xanax

Not so - am now down to only quarter mg. tabs for help sleeping _ none during day any more.  I take no other drugs.  I find other ways to avoid anxiety during daytime - long walks_ TV blabbermouths_ good book_ longish naps_ bothering friends on phone...

My dose became increased & increased & then I started having withdrawal while still taking the drug(in between doses)! The dr. then basically cold turkeyed me off. I have not been the same since.,NEVER take this drug more than 2-4 weeks! This and ALL benzos cause withdrawal and may cause a withdrawal syndrome.

359, 5, Overactive Gag Reflex,No bad side effects other than it tires you out quickly depending on dosage. It most definitely calms you down.,I take it for an overactive gag reflex that in-turn causes anxiety and panic attacks usually leading to vomiting. The Xanax slows/stops my gag reflex from becoming active since it being a type of muscle relaxant. The feeling is very calming.I have also taken it twice for possible flying anxiety. I took two 1mg tablets with half of one of the tablets I let dissolve under my tongue to kick in faster. It made me so calm that if the plane were going down to crash_ I would probably put my hands up like I'm on a roller coaster.

When I finally realized I had developed an addiction and tried to down dose to 1.5mg_ it has caused my emotions to go severely haywire.

So I disregarded their advice to find a doctor and get a long term prescription_ and within 30 days_ had another attack. PLEASE UNDERSTAND - there is a big difference between panic attacks that are caused by psychological reasons (fear or specific places_ activities or things) and and a physiological problem that isn't ""in your head"".

It's been over two months since I ""withdrew"" from this drug and I still have some side effects from it_ I just do not feel right.   This is a very dangerous drug_ there should be major warnings given by the doctors that prescribe this because tolerance is reached very quickly and it stops working unless you increase the dosage.

Decrease in anxiety attack within 20 min of dose; decreased agitation.

I also take Effexor XR 225mg a day_ and am thankful I do not have addictive tendencies. I can stop it anytime without problems(and have run out before); except no treatment for my insomnia. Recently I have decided to switch to Ambien at night instead of Xanax to minimize the acceleration of tolerance. I've taken this for 10 years. Started on 0.25mg_ which used to knock me out.

Severe nausea where you are constantly hanging over the toilet_ itching to the point where I had my skin ripped open_ tremors from head to toe.

Withdrawal was difficult but worth it. Sugar and sugary foods and alcohol made withdrawal symptoms worse. Prescribing physician insisted that these were thyroid-associated even though numerous blood tests came out normal. It was only after the xanax dosage was slowly decreased did the tinnitus and vertigo start going away within a couple of weeks. Four months post-withdrawal_ I finally feel like my old self; irritable only with cause; enjoying going out; listening to music.

400, 4, anxiety_ panic_ racing thoughts,Rebound anxiety_ slurred speech and loss of balance(mild)_ mild memory impairment that faded away over time_ euphoria_ addiction.,Xanax is my favorite of the benzos because it seems to have the least side effects (no drowsiness or depression like ativan did to me).  However_ taking it daily is a terrible idea because of its super short half life. I would find myself grinding my teeth_ getting aggrivated_ feeling anxious and angry in between doses. I would wake up feeling VERY tense and nauseous_ with a strange headache and perceptual disturbances_ all of which would subside after I took the drug! So I recently switched to klonopine_ which suprisingly covered the xanax w/d very well and lasts longer_ elmininating the between dose withdrawel. Xanax made me manic the last six months_ riding up and down a rollercoaster of anxiety. Klonopine has leveled me out and I feel like a normal human again. I can dose once a day_ as opposed to 3 times a day as with xanax.,M,19,6  months,8/13/2008,Xanax

I'm on the XR version now which is way better.  I see how easily it could be abused for someone seeking a downer because this seems like the ultimate down.  It did work_ but in working it incapacitated me.  Oh well.,The XR formulation is well worth considering instead. Taken once in the morning_ you never get more than 0.25 mg in your blood at any given time_ which will keep a lid on mild anxiety but not knock you out.,F,34,7  days,8/8/2008,Xanax

I am medication intolerant -- I am unable to take most medications_ including all anti depressants.  Xanax is the only one that did not harm me.  Please read my additional comments.,I have been on Xanax going on 4 years.  I started at .25 mg's 3 times per day.  It felt like a miracle.  Then a tolerance level began to develop_ so my doses were increased.  Not only was I taking the Xanax for the sudden panic attacks_ but was also prescribed the Xanax as a preventative to be taken every day.  My highest dosage eventually reached 6 mg's per day due to tolerance.  I am now being forced to have to wean_ and I am very scared.  I have suffered withdrawal from Paxil and Cymbalta...those of you who are familiar know the hell this created.  Now I am forced to stop the Xanax...very slow wean...I have no choice because it is no longer working for me and my body is physically dependent on it.  Highly addictive_ even if you don't realize you are becoming addicted.  The only way I will be able to get this Xanax to work again is to wean off of it_ and start over with the lower doses.

SEVERE DISINHIBITION as a result of long-term use (more than a few weeks is long-term on xanax!),Switched to paxil cr after 4 years on xanax (& alcohol) for my panic attacks (did not leave the house for over a year panic was so bad). Switched to paxil cr after seizure trying to come off xanax (xanax stopped working at 4-5mg a day). Xanax gave me disinhibition and basically ruined my life. Wish my first doc started me on paxil cr instead of xanax -- which you can't stay on!! ..unless you want to become a zombie. STAY AWAY FROM DAILY USE OF XANAX!  OK_ ONLY as an occasional PRN. If u let your body develop a physical dependence on xanax_ u are basically screwed -- seek help from a GOOD doc or HOSPITAL ER to get off of it.

After only 6 months of .5 mg a day I quit cold turkey and nearly had to be hospitalized on account of my physical symptoms alone. I know you're supposed to wean from this med_ but that alone should tell you how addictive it is. I also ended up suffering extreme short term memory loss and word confusion in addition to the side effects mentioned. This drug is the worst!

If you can reduce Xanax would be great_ if not_ try to take only when you need it. This is one of the reason why I suggest Marihuana should be legalize_ marihuana is not addictive and help anxiety and is not addictive as xanax.

About 20 minutes after taking each dose my anxiety just disappears and I feel normal_ like I did two decades ago before my OCD and PTSD. I don't get high or euphoric; just a little drowsy_ which a 15 minute nap cures.

I went through horrible withdrawals (even though I was only on them 2 weeks). I could not concentrate or sit still to do anything for more than a few seconds. I could not even sit down to watch TV_ I always had to get up and walk. I could not sleep. I could not lie still in bed at all. I begged my mom to take me to the ER because I felt so bad. I had this constant feeling of my insides being in turmoil. I was confused. I thought people were laughing at me all the time because I was acting so screwed up. It sucked really bad. I was so mad at my mom for doing that. Even trying to wean down on these things d,F,34,14  days,3/7/2008,Xanax

I will NEVER go through something like that again and I highly recommend for you NOT to take this medication!!!

There have been weeks between when I needed a dose and my usual dose is .25mg or .50 mg. I've tried many other medications but I do not like the fact of being on a daily maintenace medication and since Xanax is fast acting its perfect for me.

Why don't they allow refills on this Rx? It's a WONDER DRUG! I was taking 200mg of Benadryl every night (um_ not good for the liver!) and it just wasn't working. Now I just take one of these and sleep a straight 8-9 hours/night. I didn't have a lot of luck with Ambien_ but this stuff works great! I never take it during the day or when I need to concentrate.

Both my doctor and I have reserved ourselves to the fact that I will be on it for life and that the past 12 years cannot be undone. Even on 6 mg a day_ my anxiety is still not 100% under control. I would say its about 85% contained. When I began taking xanax_ just one .25mg a day was all I needed. It certainly works- there is no doubt about that- it almost immediately relieves anxiety_ but then wears off quickly. If you take it_ just be careful- there are times when I wish I wasn't dependent on such a high dosage of a narcotic to just feel normal. If you aren't feeling physically addicted yet_ I would talk to your doctor about safely weaning yourself off.,F,30,12  years,12/12/2007,Xanax

It was different than the original anxiety_ just an unpleasant_ overstimulated feeling.  Mine was minor enough because of the low dose and duration_ I could usually mask it with physical activity_ or something else that required concentration_ but if it had been much more intense_ it would have been hell.  There are plenty of stories on the web about xanax withdrawal_ and it sounds really bad.  So use it if you need it_ but only if you really need it.

I took this pill because I lost my job_ was about to split up with my boyfriend that night and had some other trauma and was really distressed. I just wanted a little break from all the anxiety so planned to take the pill maybe a few days. I only took .25 mg. That's a tiny bit though I am ultra sensitive to drugs.

I realized there was a probblem when there was 3 days I could not account for_ I spent (with a friend) $2000 on drinking and partying (which I do not remember_ nor would have done_ otherwise).  I had wild sex with my boyfriend (thank god_ because it could have been with anyone_ I would have not remembered).  I was not myself_ doing things I wouldnt normally do.  Sexual acts in public_ etc.  I do not live life on the wild side_ so this was completely out of character for me.  I quit Xanax and had the worst withdrawls.  It was like I was Bi-Polar.

I take .5 mg when needed and can function fine awake (although a Red Bull does help at work) or sleep peacefully.  I have tried 4 different anti-depressants and none have helped as much as the xanax does_ although I find doctors seem to be extremely hesitant to prescribe xanax and way too happy to presecribe anti-depressants.  Everyone seems so concerned about its addictive potential (which I can understand because I would love to take it every day). But with all of the side effects and horrible withdrawal symptoms associated with anti-depressants_ it almost seems hypocritical.  My withdrawal from Effexor was horrible!

I see a lot of DON'T TAKE THIS MED postings here_ and that bothers me_ and has scared me many times. There's a lot of guilt associated with these meds and mental problems- and no one needs to read scare tactics. It's situational.

Two years ago my wife got very sick with a rare brain disorder. My anxiety came back with a vengence but I helped her through that horrible ordeal the best I could.  When she finally died ( 10 mos ago ) I went of the deep end and couldn't sleep and was depressed.  Even my favorite tricks of wine and 3mg of melantonin didn't help me sleep and I was a wreck at work.  My blood pressure soared ( I was normal my whole life ).

Withdrawal symptoms were extreme: severe nausea_ vomiting_ dry retching_ vertigo_ visual delusions and halucinations.,The short-acting nature of this benzodiazapine made me take it IN ADVANCE of its action.

It DID allow me to focus on the task at hand (without drowsiness) for which I was grateful at the time.

Generally I can go to sleep with half of a .25 pill_ though there have been periods when I take a whole one.

552, 3, Anxiety,dry mouth_ feeling of depression/sadness and irritability when coming off of a dose,Surprisingly_ Xanaz does not make me tired when I first take it. A lot of people say that it makes them drowsy and tired. Xanax really makes me feel a lot better for the first few hours after I take_ but I start to feel cranky and irritable when the does starts to wear off. I also sometimes feel depressed and worse than I did right before taking the medication. I think I am going to switch back to Lorazepam_ which did make me somewhat tired but not at all depressed. I only take this medication as needed.,F,25,2  years,5/13/2007,Xanax
553, 3, anxiety,physically addicting,when i first started taking xanax i thought it was great(i was taking .25 2 or 3 times a day)..it took away my anxiety completly but after about two weeks of taking it i started to go thru withdrawl when i was coming down from it(irritable_anxious_uncaring_depression)..I definently recomend only taking xanax once in awhile or only when you absoulutly need it..because the dependency for it is really intense and makes you feel worse then what you felt like before you started taking it..i definentily only take it once or twice a week now...be careful,F,28,3  months,5/12/2007,Xanax
554, 1, panic attacks,anterograde amnesia_ an intense return of anxiety after several hours.,Due to its short half-life_ Xanax is more likely to lead to dependence than any other benzo. It is also the hardest to taper from. I have found clonazepam to be a more effective anxiolytic. Under no circumstances would I ever recommend drinking while using Xanax.,F,31,90  days,5/9/2007,Xanax
555, 3, Anxiety/Panic attacks,I only take 1/2 of a .5mg pill occasionally when my symptoms get bad.  It does make you very drowsy. Also for me_ when it started to wear off in about 3-5 hours_ I would have one hell of a crash where the anxiety and panic would get unbearable for a few hours. Even if I took it when I went to bed_ as soon as it wore off_ I'd be woken up with massive anxiety and panic.It also produced VERY vivid dreams_ a lot of times nightmares_ when I took it before bed. That combined with the panic/anxiety when I would wake (see above).,I find this drug a double edged sword. While it really does do a VERY good job at easing the anxiety while it's working_ I'm really trying not to take this drug. The crashes when it would wear off were horrendous and made my anxiety worse. I'm sure if you don't abuse this drug_ and you don't take it often enough to get addicted_ it's definitely worth it because it definitely does work on calming anxiety as long as you don't get the wierd side effects that I get.,M,37,4  days,5/3/2007,Xanax
556, 5, Sleep aid,Cotton mouth_ munchies_ having too much fun to want to go back to sleep,"Xanax works best for me as a sleep aid if I smoke half a joint immediately before taking it. The Xanax must be real not generic_ just as the weed must be good haze or chronic_ not ""dirt"". My problem before I started the xanax with weed combo was waking up too early and not being able to fall back asleep. I would be useless at work; tired and cranky. Regular sleeping pills left me feeling groggy after I woke up -- for the whole day. Now_ If I wake up too early I smoke a little weed and pop a xanax. I have a half hour window where I can enjoy myself_ watching TV_ snacking_ listening to some tunes_ and most significantly feeling confident I will get the extra couple hours of sleep needed to feel great when I wake up. If you wake up too early_ try the weed and xanax method. It works for me.",M,36,4  years,5/1/2007,Xanax

I was just used to eating once a day for dinner only 2 hamburgers from BK then just a snickers for lunch and 2 pop tarts for breakfast X 1 1/2 years. Not on on purpose_ just did not place much importance on eating.I found that like alcohol it relaxed my back allowing me to rest from the constant pain and sleep comfortably.

562, 4, anxiety,great sleep_ quick reduction of anxiety_ bad depression after taking the pill more than three days in a row . . .withdrawal,Xanax is a wonder pill that is exceptionally easy to get addicted to. I was prescribed xanax while my Grandmother was in hospice - watching her die was difficult. Doctor prescribed me .50. She told me take them as needed. After i started taking them and realizing how much they helped I didn't want to go a day without one. Then I didn't want to go more than 12 hours without one. After my Grandmother passed I stopped taking the pills and went into a very severe depression. Some may say it was due to the death of my Grandma...the withdrawal symptoms included an extreme irritation/aggitation_ lack of focus_ not caring about the thoughts and feelings of those around me. drinking while on xanax is a HUGE no no - unless your purpose is to forget everything you are about to do.If you have an addictive personality AT ALL xanax is not advisable as a good treatment for anxiety or any other reason,F,30,18  months,4/11/2007,Xanax

It was more than I could bear at the time.  That's when I started having panic attacks.  Unless you have experienced one_ you cannot imagine how terrible they are. My family dr. prescribed Xanax for me at that time and I have taken it off and on since then.  It did wonders for me.  The feeling I was having that I was losing my mind went away and it was wonderful!  I could function normally again.  I take one every once in a while when I feel an attack coming on_ but I don't have to take them on a regular basis any more.  On the average_ I take 1 per week.

571, 1, anxiety/sporatic pranic attacks,"I am a psychologist myself who currently feels that people really need to be educated about the chronic use of xanax.  I do belive that it is o.k. for people to use on an ""as needed basis"" so theydon't get physically addicted.  I have had occasional panic attacks since college.  I also have some anxiety and decided to try Paxil in 2000 when it was advertised as a great drug.  It didn't work but I had no problem getting off it.  In 2003 I had a  unpredictable panic attack and decided to see if any other med. would help.  My general doctor gave me Lexapro -which made my anxiety worse so I called him and he called in xanax.  I picked it up and the bottle said take 1mg ever 6-8 hours.  I had immediate relief and so my starting dose was 3mg.  I asked my doctor if it was good to keep taking it and he said if it works take it.  It was great for a year..then stopped working..I was upped to 4 which stopped working and so began a constant withdrawl between doses.  I am currently wean","Use of xanax changed my personality to the point that it was apparent to people close to me and nobody liked what it did.I was more moody and just not myself.

NOT... everything was fine until the first day i could feel tingling sensations then bloated stomach_ twitching muscles Then I started feeling like i was in a daze unable to land my feet  Layering of thoughts going very fast. The thoughts beging to slow down but you feel even more in the fog... l thoughts are whirling  around you. I started noticing almost grandiose thinking but really it was very deep thoughts  Very sensitive to everything. Sound_ light_ movement. Wow I hope this gets better it is driving me CRAZY. This is true for me but i really hope no one else has this kind of experience. I am still in the middle of it okay i THOUGHT about it some more. It is just like when you got drunk and you are thinking okay i'm drunk but i can drive and then you  get pulled over because you are driving,STAY AWAY FROM XANEX IF POSSIBLE,M,47,2  years,1/26/2007Email,Xanax
592, 5, recreation,tiredness_ confusion_ euphoria_ relaxation_ memory problems_ disorientation_ decreased sex drive_ and generally not giving a damn about anything.  So DO NOT  drive or perform any skills that require attention until the drug effects are realized.,took xanax recreationally(2 mg)_ but i do actually have problems with anxiety/panic and it worked very well for that.  I was also experiencing withdrawal from paxil (an ssri)and it really helped with thatas well.  However_ it didn't last very long(2-4 hrs).  So I can see how it can become very addictive easily and in a short period of time.  It is the most potent of the benzodiazepines and also the most addictive_ so be careful with it and know what you're doing if taking it.  DO NOT combine with moderate/high doses of alcohol.  Bad things can happen.  I am not a medical expert and do not have medical training.  This information is compiled simply from personal experience  It does not replace that of a doctor's.

607, 5, Anxiety_Panic Attacks_& Agoraphobia,None,Xanax has been a life saver for me.  When I was first diagnosed with panic attacks_ I didn't leave my house for almost 3 months.  I couldn't handle it.  The doctor put me on Zoloft and Xanax.  The Zoloft actually caused more problems_ so I stopped taking it.  I have been on Xanax for about 4 years now at .25 mg.  I only take it when I need it and I may go months without a panic attack and not have to take it.  But when I get really stressed out I may take 3-4 a day.  I used to worry about the addictiveness_ but have had no problems.  Without Xanax_ I don;t know what I would have done.  I've finally figured out that I'm not going to die from the attacks (took a while to figure that out)_ so they come less and less. I still have to take it if I go to a concert or anywhere there's going to be a large crowd of people.  But atleast I can go to those places instead of hiding out at home.

But I have a huge increase in appetite; not like ""Oh_ man_ I need to go out and eat!"" but when I sit down to eat I eat alot more than I used to. I also would get tired after taking it for the first few days_ but for awhile now I've been fine. Also_ for awhile my doctor had me taking the normal xanax as I needed it_ and that would make me very drowsy... kind of like a very unpleasant high. I am also starting to notice mood swings_ though I dont know if that is the Xanax. For instance_ a little thing will make me unusually sad_ and then something just as insignificant will make me unusually happy. I think this is the Xanax as before taking it I was a fairly consistent person regarding my mood. And the final side effect was a decrease in my sex drive for the first week_ and since then it takes a little bit more to get me going_ though I havent had any problems with impotence yet... I just need a little bit more foreplay",I worry about the dependancy issue even though I am at a low dosage. However_ it has helped very much with my anxiety. For example_ I went to a concert last week and was more sociable among strangers than I normally would be due to feelings of anxiousness around them. I also am able to put myself into positions where I would normally feel anxious and not feel so bad anymore_ and this has helped me rebuild some relationships that I had abandoned due to my anxiety issues. The increased appetite is also a good thing_ because I've always been on the lighter side and have been trying to gain weight for years now. So the drug helps and with minimal side effects. I have to admit_ I am a bit skeptical when doctors try to put me on medications. They had me on Lexapro_ Reglan and even Zolfran in an effort to stem my anxiety and the nauseous feelings I get when anxious... but these didnt work very well.

When I start to feel my GAD kick in_ which happens about every 2 weeks to a month_ I pop one in and am usually fine for another month.  I guess I could see how this medication could be addictive to some_ but I really don't like taking medication in general so I would find it hard for me to get addicted.  I think I got a prescription 8 months ago and still have 21 pills left from my starting 30.  Be careful and don't take this drug until you are for sure you need it or are experiencing a panic attack.  If you take the medication just for the heck of it or because you think you might have a chance of getting a panic attack then you probably have a greater risk of dependency.,M,20,8  months,9/6/2006Email,Xanax

However_ I had my heart broken really badly this year_ and was in danger of losing my job because I just couldn't function at work. Finally_ I asked my doc for some xanax. With the very first pill I took_ it was a world of difference. Sure_ my heart was still broken_ but I was not in the debilitating pain that had kept me tearful every day. I could function. I never thought I would see a ""cure"" for the pain of a broken heart. Heaven knows_ alcohol doesn't help. But the xanax took the edge off the pain and kept me sane. Of course_ a good therapist is a must_ too.

I you only suffer anxiety and panic_ don't let your doc put you on a lecapro_ pacil_ zoloft_ etc. without first trying xanax for a month to see if it can take the edge off and then during that time seek counseling and natural means.  Yeah this stuff is addicting_ but have you read what the ssri withdrawals are like...living hell.

646, 3, anxiety attacks,Tiredness_ and dizziness when coming down off the pill,Xanax saved my life when I needed it at the time. At 16 I had very severe anxiety attacks when my parents divorced and was put on .5 mgs. Now at 20 years old_ I am on 2 mg a day. This medication is VERY ADDICTIVE and almost impossible to get off. I have highly considered going into detox. The withdrawl symptoms or symptoms you get from not taking your dose on time are HORRIBLE!!I was extremly dizzy_ would be a complete zombie_ have the shakes_ everything. So although while I needed it I couldnt imagine getting through what I didn with out it_ but now that I dont need it I cant get off of it and it is causing my health issues now I never feel like myself. So be VERY CAREFUL when taking this drug and only take it AS NEEDED not just because you like the effects in the long run it makes for a very difficult recovery.,F,20,4  years,7/21/2006,Xanax

How many people are allergic to MSG with bad hearts and have died from eating foods with it!? If you suffer from anxiety and panic attacks within 10 minutes  - 1 1⁄2 hours after eating_ Ill bet you are allergic to MSG.

What I hate is going to pick it up a a pharmacy and they look at  you like you are a drug dealer.  Do not be afraid of Xanax_ my Dr. knows it is a life saver for those of us who have tried all the other anti-depressants and can not tolerate them.

I suffer from GAD_ social phobia_ and fear of larg crowds.  After consultation with my doctor i tried Lexepro_ Wellbutrin_ Paxil to no avail.  Most of the antidepresents did not work.  And yes i stayed on them for 8-10 weeks but suffered from multiple side effects everything from a rash to complete zombie like effect.  The first day i was on Xanax XR immediatley after taking the drug i noticed how my inhibitions about fear of crowds and fear of fear started to go away.  I speek the truth about this medication and how well it works.  However_ use this medication baseed on your doctors advice.  I see how this drug could be highly addictive_ it just makes you feel good.  This drug has totaly taken away all anxiety and fear from what was robbing me in the past.  I'm going to stop here because i could write on and on about how well this drug works.  If you suffer from anxiety and all other medications that you have taken fail or you are suffering from the multiple side effects from the current drug you are on_ ask your doc about Xanax and how it might work for you... it worked for me (sounds like a comercial) this is the truth_ for now i continue to take Xanax XR once per day and i'm now able to function like a normal human being.,M,35,2  months,8/2/2005,Xanax

Once I felt like I was going to black-out_ but I think I just over-reacted to the above symptoms and just got scared. I've never blacked-out before_ so all the above was new feelings for me. All these symptoms would come and go_ usually from 10am to 3pm. After that_ everything was fine. This had to be the Xanax  being metabolized from my system (i.e._ a little withdrawal).,No side effects at first_ except it would knock me out_ which is what I wanted it to do. I was taking .5mg at night only (none during the day). After a few days on the stuff_ my tolerance level increased and I found that I needed .75mg to make me sleep. It was after this increase that I began to experience side effects during the day. I would think this was due to withdrawal symptoms. As I read_ withdrawals from this drug_ even though you aren't addicted_ can mimic the very symptoms the drug is supposed to fix. Thus the reason why some think they eventually need it 2-3 times a day or more. Xanax is good for it's intended purpose_ anxiety_ but once that is cured_ don't continue to take it as a sleep-aid (insomnia). Don't get me wrong_ some people need this drug on a daily basis just as diabetics need insulin.,M,41,14  days,6/13/2005,Xanax

VERY PRONOUNCED WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS.,After an extended length of heavy alcohol consumption I was very physically addicted to alcohol_ although not mentally -- I seriously wanted to quit at this point_ but if I didn't get a drink every few hours I would experience sweating_ dysphoria_ severe anxiety to the point where I was jumping at shadows and SEVERE insomnia (I went five days without sleep easily when trying to quit).I found a doctor and told him I had previously been diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder and was relapsing (this was true enough_ though I omitted my alcohol situation).  He proscribed Prozac (20mg) and the generic form of Xanax_ Alprazolam (proscribed at 1mg every six hours or as needed).Well_ after a short period where my body got used to the Xanax (I was very sleepy and uncoordinated for about three days as I recall) I was much better.  When I felt the anxiety coming on I took .25mg to,M,33,3  months,1/8/2005,Xanax

757, 5, Panic Disorder / Panic Attacks,Slight memory loss while on the med.  Occasionally will make you tired but still completely functional.  Other than that - absolutely no bad side effects!,I was so afraid to take xanax for the first time.  I read this entire board so that I could be prepared for the worst side effect.  But desperation forced me into taking it and_ luckily_ there aren't bad side effects!  I am so happy that I have it.  It's the only thing that makes me feel normal again and will conquer even the strongest attack.  It takes about 20-45 minutes to kick in_ but is a lifesaver for me given that my attacks last for at least an hour and a half.  For a quicker effect_ I let it dissolve under my tongue for a few minutes before swallowing.  I don't know why doctors are so hesitant to prescribe this med...probably because there's more $ to be made in antidepressants.  I take the lowest dose at .25mg only when necessary.,F,29,3  months,12/14/2004,Xanax

760, 5, Depression_ Anxiety,Just some sleepiness at first.  This went away after a week or so.,I was prescribed Celexa and Xanax when I came down with very severe tinnitus and hyperacusis (hyper-sensitivity to all sound).  The Xanax kicked in immediately to reduce the depression/anxiety until the 40 MG of Celexa became totally effective many weeks later.  I was taking .375 MG of Xanax 5 times a day.  This dosage gave me a very steady_ even dose of Xanax over the entire day and it worked wonders.  After the Celexa became fully effective_ I started cutting down on the Xanax VERY gradually over a VERY long period of time (six months).  I had absolutely no problems tapering off.  My hyperacusis disappeared completely and I underwent Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) to habituate to the tinnitus.  I am still taking the 40 MG of Celexa and don't plan on stopping.  I have no side-effects from it_ feel great_ and_ since there is severe depression in my family_ my doctor and I feel that it is best that I stay on it.  I still take .125 to .500 MG Xanax once a day on an as-needed basis_ when I cannot sleep due to sensitivity to caffeine and some medications.  Luckily_ I have a very supportive and understanding psychiatrist who constantly monitors my usage_ but understands my needs.,M,53,43  months,12/7/2004Email,Xanax

831, 5, Anxiety,Drowsiness_ euphoria,Xanax really helps with anxiety_ although the drowsiness can be alittle bothersome during the day if you work. It tends to go away after a few days of use though_ its unfortunate that most doctors wont allow you to use it long term (as its addicting) because it really works great!,M,25,30  days,2/23/2004,Xanax
832, 2, to help me sleep from restless leg,I have had restless leg-neuropathy for approx. 6 months. I just recently found out what it was. One of my doctors prescribed the lowest dose for sleep_ it seemed as though when I first started taking it; it was helping me. Then my doctor wouldn't give me any refills_ and when I came off of them_ I was very irritated_ anxious_ etc. I noticed also that it wasn't really helping me sleep that well. This drug is only a cover-up_ and highly abused by many people. You wouldn't believe the people that approached me and wanted to buy these! That really turned me off from this drug and made me think twice about what I was doing.,,F,39,2  months,2/12/2004Email,Xanax

I've taken it off and on (skipping weeks) for many years and haven't become addicted to it. I can see how you could_ though.

838, 5, anxiety,drowsiness,I am taking Xanax in addition to Effexor XR. Both medications are great_ although I have a choice in whether I take Xanax or not. With Effexor_ there are major withdrawal symptoms. I only take Xanax when I feel an attack coming on. My doctor prescribed me .5 mg 2 a day as needed after I ended up in the ER for major chest and lower stomach pains_ blackouts_ and hyperventalation. I have had my Xanax prescription for 2 months_ but I have only had to take it five times_ the first two times I took it_ I took one whole pill and within 1 hour_ I was passed out on the bed.

849, 5, Panic Disorder,First week of treatment involved heavy drowsiness and slight tension headache.  The second week side effects mostly diappeared_ except drymouth with a metallic taste.,I was prescribed xanax to help control panic attacks that I was experiencing due to layoff and stress.  This medication will help you cope with these attacks by sedating you and calming you down. I took three pills each day the first week_ and then two the following week.  Now I only take one twice a week. Once you learn how to cope with your attacks_ slowly ween yourself off this medication.  Side effects are mild to moderate.,M,23,3  weeks,4/21/2003,Xanax
850, 5, panic disorder,none,I had to drink 24 cans off beer a day before I got xanax.  NowI don't drink at all.  I take 8 mg of xanax a day and I can now live a normal life. I can now leave home and do things that I could never do without the medication.  I would much rather stay on my xanax_ than ever go back to a destructive drug (like alcohol).  People can say all they want to about addiction_ but for the mentally ill_ being addicted to xanax is alot better life than being under the influence of alcohol.  Xanax has improved my life greatly.  With it_ I am sober_ and yet able to get out and do normal things.  If I did not have it_ I would be in alot of trouble.The use of this drug is stigmatized.  Doctor's fear giving it for fear of addiction; however_ when used properly it is such a Godsend.

859, 5, anxiety_ muscle spasm,none,All narcotics have an addictive nature_ educate yourself! If you have a good doctor and take the medication properly you will develop TOLERANCE which is not the same as ADDICTION.  A diabetic needs insulin to live_ we need this medication to function.

865, 1, anxiety,drowsiness_ inability to function properly_ memory loss_ denial_ etc.,I don't take the medicine...but my brother does because he has cluster headaches_ so the doctor prescribed them to him to keep him from having anxiety attacks_ which would cause his headaches to trigger. However_ now he has become addicted. He is having major problems which is in turn tearing our family apart. He has tried taking medication to cleanse his system_ and we think he might be ok...but then his problems start again because he is only making us THINK he is off xanax. We are all on edge about what to do with him because if you confront him he simply gets angry and yells at anyone who tries to help him. We don't know what else to do for him.

I have to get the bills paid _ I havent been able to work in over three months. I feel kind of awkward telling him that i need my dosage raised. Im really self consious of what people think of me especially when ive now finally got the courage to ask for help. I mean i dont want him thinking im a pill seeking junkie or anything. anyone who takes xanax_ from your experience_ would being on a higher dosage like 1 mg or so be out of the ordinary.

879, 5, anxiety attacks and depression,I take the xanax on a low dosage_ 2.5mg a day_ to combat the anxiety as well as the side effects of Prozac.

I go through about one episode a year_ ( suffer from SAD)_ so the long term effects don't worry me.
