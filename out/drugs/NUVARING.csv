0, 1, BC,First month on this drug I noticed an increase in thick white discharge. When I removed the ring at the 3 week mark_ it had white discharge on it. I got my period 3 days later_ which lasted 4 days and was heavy.  I put a new ring in ever since I have had cloudy to white discharge that looks like a yeast infection_ abdominal cramps_ leg cramps_ my face is breaking out all over_ and my vagina burns. I immediately removed the ring and I will never do this again.  Not to mention my sex drive is at a ZERO and I live with my boyfriend who joint something was wrong bc I never wanted to have sex.  Stay away from this drug!! I'm taking my diflucan and moving on!,,F,34,5  weeks,7/26/2016,Nuvaring

6, 3, Iud is damaging me,Breast tenderness  nausea tired over all feeling of pregnant which subsided today,To the girl who wants an iud I strongly encourage you not to get it. Ive had two and my first fell out my second is literally killing me extremely painful periods that last all month with literally 2 days with out bleeding. And so your know the mireena has hormone so it's probably going to make you feel just as shitty except this time you won't be able to just stop  the birth control due to what it is. I had a seizure and passed out when my second one was inserted and it hurts like a bitch to get it out,F,28,7  days,3/18/2016Email,Nuvaring
7, 1, Birth control_ painful periods,I started NuvaRing a week ago and I took it out today because it made me sad_ sensitive_ impatient_ and generally stressed. I told my doctor I wanted Mirena because I was concerned the hormones would make me irritable but he refused because I haven't had children. I actually didn't mind it the first few days because my period was much lighter but my period went from 3 days in length to 8. Yesterday and today_ I was hating everything and realized that I needed to remove it so I did. Some may say that I didn't give it a chance but I don't think that I should have to go through hell to have a normal period. Am feeling pretty emotional as hormones work their way out of my system and made an appointment with Planned Parenthood to have an IUD inserted later this week. I by no means think that NuvaRing is terrible_ it just wasn't for me. I would just encourage all women to go with their gut and seek providers that partner with them in making decisions impacting their emotional health.,,F,29,7  days,3/10/2016Email,Nuvaring
8, 1, Birth control,I was on the pill before I decided to try nuvaring. I switched because I was forgetting to take my daily pill when I worked night shifts so I figured in that sense the nuvaring would be a better option for me. Ever since week one I felt nauseated all day long_ fatigued_ chest pain and palpitations that would not go away. My anxiety levels reached a level that I could not handle. Nuvaring turned me into a person that I am not. I thought the nausea was the weirdest symptom because this form of birth control is not ingested. But the anxiety levels and mood swings were the worst part. I finally decided that the only problem here was the ring because I live a healthy lifestyle and there was no way that anything else was causing this hell. After taking the nuvaring out I could feel the difference right away_ I was finally able to lay down in bed calmly without shaking or chest pain_ my anxiety was gone and my nausea no longer existed. I could not believe the difference. I'm a health nut and I have not had any good experiences with birth control_ I did my research and all the synthetic hormones from birth control methods just don't go with my body. I am going to stay free of pills and birth control for life. I want to be the person I truly am. It's amazing how much a hormone can affect our bodies.,Nuvaring also made me super lubricated all the time which I personally did not like at all.,F,26,3  weeks30 mg,1/29/2016Email,Nuvaring
9, 1, birth control_  regulate period,"The nuvaring almost ruined my life. I've had symptoms since I started it 2 years ago_ but honestly never connected it to the symptoms I experienced since it stated slow and built up. I took  it out 2 weeks ago and will never look back. I ended up on medicine for panic attacks and severe anxiety for almost the past 2 years. My panic attacks caused fainting. I became depressed_ inactive and never wanted to leave the house. I was tired all the time. I would sleep 6 to 7 hours at night then take a 4 hour nap during the day.  My heart beat became so irregular_ I was diagnosed with tachycardia. The palpitations were nerve wracking and added to anxiety. I gained the most weight in my life. I'm 5'9"" and was 135lbs when I started. I now with 170lbs. This also added to the stress and depression I was feeling. My husband and I used to have sex at least twice a week.  After the nuvaring_ weeks would go by before I realized we hadn't had sex. I never thought birth control was capable of this. I assumed I was just suddenly having panic attacks.  After going through hell_  paying for more testing and meds than I've had/taken my whole life combined_ I stumbled across nuvaring complaints. I can't believe it.  Never again. I am now weening off all the meds I was put on for anxiety. It's rough_  but everyday I feel a little better_ a little more like me.",,F,31,2  years1 ring,1/27/2016Email,Nuvaring

13, 1, Pregnancy prevention,I was taking NR at first it was wonderful. Then later on I started noticing changes. Depression anxiety no sex drive headaches and everything else you can think of. I just followed up on it today with the whole recall deal and saw these reviews.  I'm right there with everyone else. This product is not as great as they say. I mean what's the point of preventing a pregnancy if you don't want to have sex anyway? I even started taking anxiety meds all natural of course. But I bet my entire bank account NR is the cause of this. I will follow up with everyone in a few months.

Absolutely ZERO sex drive_ and when we do have intercourse it is painful. I took the ring out 1 week ago.. No change yet but I'm assuming it will take some time to get back to normal.

17, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Panicky_ chest felt very heavy_ rapid heartbeat_ constant worry_ paranoia_ unmotivated_ lack of libido_ felt like I was going crazy. I am in the fitness industry and in good physical condition_ I couldn't even make it through a workout without a minor panic attack. When starting the NR I weighed 130 pounds_ fit and slender. With all the side effects and loss of appetite I am now 119 pounds. I had written down a log for my doctor which I will share. I'm relieved to see others have experienced the same as me. Log for doctor:Oct 14- had a good sleep woke up at 8 am again. Very hard morning. Couldn't get out of bed. Tried multiple times but returned to bed. Wanted to do laundry and house tasks but didn't. Felt pathetic. I feel like my emotions are gone. I can't feel happy and I can't feel sad. I don't know how to feel love. I'm Scared my medication isn't working and I'll feel like this forever. ****** came home and I started to cry_ I feel bad that this is what he has to deal with. I want my life back. I want to be who I was. I want to feel again. Why did this happen to me. 😪Oct 19I had a fairly good weekend I was able to control most of my worry.  The only time I got weird was when we were out to eat. I began to worry because we were eating unhealthy. I find it hard to eat. But this morning I am back to where I was. I can't get out of bed. I'm not sure if I slept or was awake. My thoughts kept me awake or maybe they were dreams.  I'm so sick of this.,Very scary side effects. I liked the convenience of it and that I did not become pregnant. There wasn't hardly any discomfort and my partner didn't complain either although he said he could feel it during sex.,F,26,5  weeks,10/26/2015,Nuvaring
18, 2, Prevent pregnancy,Anxiety_ chest pain_ severe decrease in sex-drive_ discharge_ headaches,When I first went on the ring 3 years ago_ I thought it was the best thing ever. It was simple to use_ I went up a cup size_ and it didn't make me sick like oral birth control. However_ towards the 3rd year_ I started getting frequent chest pains_ panic attacks where I had trouble breathing_ and I had no sex drive whatsoever. I even went to therapy to try and figure out what was wrong with me and why I didn't want to be touched by my partner (who I had no other issues with). Finally_ when I was considering going on anxiety medication_ my mom suggested maybe the Nuva Ring was the issue. Doubtful_ I took it out a month ago. Now_I have no chest pains_ I'm a lot calmer_ much less emotional. And I've felt turned on more this month than I have been in the last year. This whole time I was blaming my job_ my partner and myself. I didn't realize it was the ring until my sister went on it (who had no anxiety issues whatsoever) and she contacted me 3 months after having it in_ telling me she also had chest pains and anxiety problems. The Nuva Ring is great for some people_ but if you experience higher levels of anxiety it's really not worth it.,F,26,3  years 1X M,10/22/2015,Nuvaring

20, 1, pregnancy prevention,heart palpitations_ dry skin_ dry lips_ dry eyes_ brittle hair_ dry scalp_ brittle nails_ vaginal dryness_ nausea_ foggy brain_ tired_ fatigue_ discharge_ breast tenderness,I thought the nuvaring was amazing when I first started on it_ no symptoms whatsoever and has done great about preventing pregnancy_ but 3 years later I have decided to take it out and never get on it again. A couple weeks after being on nuvaring I had what doctor's thought was a panic attack. I knew they were wrong and I finally just decided to attribute it to low iron. Recently I had the same thing happen_ heart palpitations_ dizzyness_ and feeling like I wanted to faint. Everyone told me it was just stress or anxiety_ but all these symptoms came about after starting Nuvaring. PLEASE if you start noticing any of the symptoms above_ GET OFF OF NUVARING. I have seen news segments of woman dying from Nuvaring_ Of course that is very unlikely to happen but feeling like your heart is coming out of your chest and feeling dizzy and faint is not good for your health!!!! PLEASE pay attention to your symptoms and if you know yourself well enough to know you're not having an anxiety attack_ please look at your birth control_ it could be the hidden culprit.,F,23,3  years 1X D,10/7/2015,Nuvaring
21, 1, Pregnancy prevention,When I first started the ring I lost at least 20 pounds. Which was too much considering I only weighed 116 to begin with. While on the ring I was constantly nauseous and had severe stomach cramps. I had terrible mood swings. Every time I got irritated I would want to throw things or punch holes in walls. It made me a nervous wreck. I was constantly shaking or having anxiety attacks. The only plus is that I never got pregnant in the 4 years I was on it.,I would not recommend this to anyone.,F,20,3  years,9/12/2015,Nuvaring
22, 3, Substitue for the moment,I have not had issues with it so far. Most of the past birthcontrol stuff ive been on made me moody but part of that was do to crappy relationships during those times. I'm giving it another try till I find a facility that does the implant in the arm. I had one and loved it but once it was done after 3 yrs my dr informed me_ my insurance no longer covers it but it covered the removal of it. So for the time being she had offered the pill_ which id be terrible with_ a shot which is the hardest one for me to manage weight with but i never saw a period_ or NR. I decided kn the ring. Only issue I have with it_ is it falling out when going to the bathroom. I have a shallow pelvis so if im goong to the bathroom (#2) the minimum amount of pushing pops it out and there is no emergency back ups when it comes to insurance companies. I have lost a few in the toilet_ so it is annoying making sure it doesnt fall out when using the facilities. Also I have an extremely high sex drive_ so this doesnt stir a ripple for me_ thankfully. I did notice an odd odor though the 2nd day i had it in. Im very keen on my odor because it is very important to me_ and my urine is fairly clear. I drink plenty of water. I've read a rare few reviews where some women said their odor changed only when the ring was in. Other than that I havent had a lot of issues.,My fiance hates the ring because it has caused irritation on his penis rubbing against it during sex or it pops out hanging on him. I had asked my obgyn if there was anyway i can take it out during sex and she said yes. As long as its not out for too long. Less than 30 minutes or so. I'm not a big fan of it but id prefer this then the T insert_ the shot_ or the pill. Hoping to get my arm implant back in soon which I loved_ but till then needed a back up im comfortable with.,F,30,3  days,9/1/2015,Nuvaring
23, 3, Cramping & Birth Control,I've been on birth control for 12 years_ and the Nuvaring for 5 years of the 12 years.  I originally got on birth control when I was very young due to extreme cramping; however I've stayed on it for the birth control aspect.  The Nuvaring managed my cramping well_ made my period extremely light (2 days to no period at all)_ and I never got pregnant while using_ which was great.  I never attributed any negative things that have been going on in my life to the Nuvaring; however I'm starting to rethink my situation.  I have literally zero sex drive_ I've gained 45 pounds over the past 5 years_ I have extreme vaginal dryness_ horrible vaginal pain during intercourse_ and it's literally impossible to lose weight.  Looking back_ these issues have all arose steadily over the past 5 years.,"I've been off the Nuvaring for a week now and I've suffered from ""estrogen withdrawal_"" which needless to say_ has been awful.  I have a headache that won't go away_ I'm nauseous_ and I have the shakes.  Regardless if my other symptoms were related to the Nuvaring_ I won't go back on any birth control due to the fact that I never want to go through this withdrawal phase again.  I'm hoping to start to be able to lose weight again and improve my sex drive over time.  I'm sure neither of these will be instantaneous.",F,25,5  years1 Ring 1X M,8/14/2015Email,Nuvaring

Yes_ I've noticed a slight decrease in sex drive_ but nothing that I couldn't mentally get over. Also_ I have gained weight_ but I also gained weight on other birth control medications. I love that I don't have to have my period every month. I usually choose to leave the ring out for a week every 3-4 months just to allow my body to have a period. Reading all of these reviews_ I wouldn't say to stay away from the nuvaring just because some people have adverse effects because you never know how your body will react to medications_ not everyone is the same! I've had to change birth control medications a few times just to find the one that works right for me_ you should keep your mind open about your options.,F,28,3  years,5/21/2015,Nuvaring

I even went so far as to go and take a sleep study which proved I have slight Restless Leg Syndrome but for the most part I go through the normal sleep phases.

During those 3 years I started having severe heart palpitations_ shortness of breath_ dizziness. Twice I actually blacked out. Resulting in EKG's and wearing a halter monitor. I also experienced instances where I would pass large clots of gray matter. GYN thought after many years of being on b.c. (started at 15) my body needed a break_ which is why I quit using it. At the time I never thought the heart issues were related to the NR. Recently_ after having my daughter and trying Depo (gained almost 80lbs) I decided to switch back to the NR. It's been almost 3 weeks and suddenly I noticed all those heart issues had returned. It wasn't until I left work early tonight bc the symptoms were so bad and talking to a coworker that it dawned on me this was the common factor. Needless to say I have taken it out and will be contacting my OB/GYN tomorrow.,,F,28,8  years,1/26/2015Email,Nuvaring
45, 2, Irreg periods; preg prevention,Bloating and nausea (decreased after one week)_ excess vaginal discharge_ UTI_ increased acne_ breast tenderness_ bigger breasts (only positive side effect),When I was prescribed the nuvaring_ I was excited because of how convenient I thought it would be. However_ within a few hours after inserting the nuvaring_ I started to get gassy_ bloated_ and nauseated. I took it as my body adjusting to the nuvaring. The nausea and the bloating went away within a week. But I had symptoms that would not go away. I experienced excess vaginal discharge_ which was incredibly uncomfortable. I also experienced vaginal discomfort that started within a few days after insertion. It was so bad that I called my gyno because I feared that I had developed a UTI. Turns out I did get my first UTI after a week of being in the Nuvaring. Turns out nuvaring is related to increased UTIs. I also experienced the worst breakout while being on the nuvaring. It wasn't worth it to me. After finishing out one cycle_ I removed the ring. I started my period within 3 days. My periods were not much lighter and was shortened by one day. My acne cleared up right away and I lost about 3 lbs since getting off the nuvaring. I no longer experience excess discharge or vaginal discomfort. I've since switched to a low dosage birth control pill and none of the side effects I've experienced on the nuvaring have emerged. The nuvaring had potential_ but it turns out that it wasn't for me.,F,26,3  weeks,1/25/2015Email,Nuvaring
46, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Weigh gain (15 pounds) with no change of appetite_ and in the gym everyday. Horrible mood swings. It seems everyone on here has the same issues_ and I was so relieved to see that. I would be irritable_ cry at the drop of a hat_ bring myself down about everything_ the weight gain had me feeling so confused and self conscious. I never wanted to go out and do things. My boyfriend and I were becoming very frustrated because of how much this damn ring changed me. I had never been emotional or moody like that before_ it's just not who I am! Took the ring out three days ago and I feel amazing_ I'm back to my old self finally and couldn't be happier. I'm very sensitive to hormones_ I've been on several different pills and they all disagreed with me. My advice_ if you're sensitive to estrogen... Don't do it. Biggest mistake.,,F,20,10  months1 ring,1/23/2015,Nuvaring
47, 1, Pregnancy Prevention,I started on the nuva ring about a year ago. I thought it would be great to not have to take a pill everyday... I noticed right away that my breasts hurt and grew about a size larger_ but also that I was so irritable that it effected my relationship with my boyfriend. I called my Dr. and she said to wait it out and it should get better... It actually only got worse. I was on edge all the time_ fights with my boyfriend were more often_ and I would cry for no reason. I also experienced extra depression while on the nuva ring and weight gain which made me feel awful about myself. I got off of it and I honestly feel amazing. I feel like myself again and my relationship is great. I don't recommend this_ it ruined who I was and my life.,,F,30,1  years,1/16/2015,Nuvaring

49, 1, B.Control & Heavy Cycles,Mood swings_ super white_ thick discharge & slight stinch _ pain during intimacy_ weight gain & bloating.,When I first decided to use the Nuva Ring_ I was very excited. I hadn't had sex in almost a year_ so I was more that clear of not having any issues with my female organs. Might I add that I started on it a few months after having a myomectomy. It saddens my heart that I was not able to stick with this form of contraception_  but it is what it is. The unpleasant feeling after intimacy_ as well as the discharge_  just wasn't worth it. We are different. Just because it didn't work for me_ doesn't mean that it won't work for you...to each his own. In closing_  I must admit that I'm feeling much better now since I've discontinued my use of the Nuva Ring. Good luck!,F,43,2  months,1/4/2015,Nuvaring

51, 2, Birth Control,Depression_ emotional instability_ decreased sex drive_ lighter periods,I took Nuvaring a couple years ago and had no issues with it_ but now I'm having noticeable side effects.  I've always had issues with oral birth control because I would have side effects or forget to take it.  The first time I didn't notice any effects_ but just started on it a month ago and I've had really bad depression_ low sex drive_ and I'm easily irritated.  I'm usually active and stable emotionally. After a month of being on it I've spent days without leaving the house and I'll start crying for no reason.  It's bad enough that people around me have noticed I'm depressed.  I'm in a new relationship and my drive to have sex has dissipated and I'm easily annoyed/offended by my boyfriend.  This wasn't the case before I started taking NR. I took it out two days ago and don't plan on continuing use.,F,30,1  months1x Month 1X M,12/23/2014,Nuvaring
52, 2, Pregnancy prevention,I first started taking the NuvaRing when I was 20 years old.  I absolutely loved it.  I continued to take it for the next  7 years with no noticeable side effects that I can recall.  When I turned 27 I got off the birth control for about 3 years.  In October I saw my OBGYN and jumped back on the NuvaRing bus.  She gave me an actual NuvaRing to insert that Sunday_ and a prescription for the rest of the year.  After inserting the ring from my doctor I felt completely normal_ no complaints.  The next month I filled the prescription at the pharmacy and about 2 days after inserting the ring I noticed that I was not horny in the mornings as I usually am.  I felt the difference right away but thought I would return to normal soon.  After the 3rd ring_ I am totally  convinced the ring has stolen my sex drive.  COMPLETELY STOLEN IT.  Sex makes me feel nothing.  The thought of it does nothing to me_ something is so wrong..,,F,30,10  years 1X D,12/22/2014Email,Nuvaring
53, 1, Birth control,Where do I begin in the past year I've become a complete different person_ one that I hate and one that I'm far from being. I've been in a relationshio for 16 years with a wonderful man that I love more then anything_ we've always had a great relationship up until the past year we've got into so many arguments and fights over everything but mostly my insecurities_ paranoia_ horrible mood swings. Everything bothered me_ everything was accentuated. It was overbearing. A lot of women mentioned that their sex drive was unexistent mine was the opposite I could of  litteraly have sex all the time_ which is not necessarily a bad thing but sometimes was overwhelming and when my bf didn't feel like having sex  even that would make me freak out because I felt unattractive_ and caused arguments_ jealousy. The NR brought the worst out of me. I focused on the negative_ made myself sick overanalyzing everything_ horribly insecure. My emotions were out of control_ I was very negative_ angry_ crying a lot. I didn't  like feeling like that I feeled depressed. My bf asked me to consult to see if I needed depression pills but I researched a lot and fell on the side effects of the NR and saw that so many women had or have similar side effects that I took the decision to remove it because I really didn't want to ruin my relationship. So far I feel a lot better_ more patient_ easy going like I used to be and feeling more like myself. So please the minute you feel like your emotions are getting the,I don't recommend the NR_ it will kill you inside and make you someone you will no longer recognize and will ruin you :(,F,32,2  years,12/14/2014,Nuvaring
54, 2, prevent pregnancy,Paranoia_ anxiety_ depression_ heart palpatations_ blood pressure increased,First couple months I loved the NV because I didn't have to take a pill everyday and I was on the Mirena but it scratched me and my boyfriend during intercourse. The good thing about the NV is it prevented pregnancy. Bad thing is I started having anxiety attacks and panic all the time! Paranoia about everything that was going in my body that I quit smoking weed_ alcohol_ and stopped eating salt_ chocolate_ caffeine because I thought that was the reason for my panic and anxiety. But soon realized that my blood pressure has always been normal before the NuvaRing and I have never had panic before the NuvaRing. I've had anxiety in the past but I never had heart palpatations or felt like I was going to die! I got really depressed and stopped going out with my friends because I was too scared to have a panic attack. I took out the NuvaRing a few days ago...and I'm starting to feel normal again.,F,25,8  months,12/7/2014,Nuvaring

I experienced only slight irritability which I attributed to starting back to college after 6 years and working full time. Month 3 began and I was not myself at all. Mood swings_  emotional outbursts_ extreme fatigue_ depression_ insecurity. My boyfriend commented that I was not myself lately. I would cry at the drop of a hat for no reason whatsoever. I have never been irritable or emotional and the Nuvaring brought out the absolute worst in me. Needless to say_ the convenience of not having to take a pill is not worth the pressure on my relationship or my emotional sanity.  I took the ring out Saturday night and by Monday was back to normal.

However_ as soon as i inserted it_ there was  a definite shift in my mood/attitude. Usually_ i am a very happy person_ laid back and never moody. The Nuvaring was making me more emotional and I would cry over the silliest thing. Also_ I realised I was getting annoyed at my partner for things that dont usually annoy me.

During the 1st and 2nd month on Nuvaring_ I noticed an excess of wetness/secretions_ headaches just about every day_ nausea_ and constipation_ that went away by the 2nd and 3rd month. But the vaginal irritation took over to an extreme. It felt like something was in there and that it had to come out. It made me feel like I was swollen and just overall totally uncomfortable. I've never hated my vagina_ but the NuvaRing made me hate it. I also became depressed_ very anxious_ worried_ and irritable. One of the worst side effects I've had is heart palpitations. Having these are normal every once in a while_ but I've had them frequent and strong enough that it makes me so uncomfortable and even more anxious. Apparently hormonal changes can cause that. Lastly_ it's made my sex life nonexistent. It makes sex not appealing and makes me want nothing to do with sex_ which in reality I do! Its the ring. Total mood and sex killer_ anxiety inhibitor_ and just horrible. Thought I found a good BC_ but now I'm scared of hormonal BC.

But then about 3 months into using nuvaring_ I noticed a severely decreased sex drive (as in my boyfriend had to bring it to my attention that he felt neglected). About another month after that_ I felt the slow oncomings of anxiety. I thought this was just related to a pre-existing anxiety issue (that had been under control for 7 years). Then I started questioning everything I was doing and everything in my life. It didn't make sense. It is now months later_ and I put aside the thought that it was my birth control_ and my anxiety is the worst it's ever been.

86, 2, prevent pregnancy and clear up skin,I have taken the Nuvarung for over 3 years now since I had my son. At first i did not realize or even think about the Nuvaring having any side effects_ because I thought I was just anxious and it was all in my head. I have been on it for 3 years_ but only become aware of the symptoms in the past year. I have extreme anxiety all the time_ sever heart palpitTions on a daily basis_ shortness of breath_ skin itchiness for no reason_ hot and cold flashes_ leg numbness_ high blood pressure_ occasional dizziness/lack of balance_ occasional depression_ moodiness_ lack of patience. In the last year_ i have had such a fear of dying from a heart attack or stroke....which causes even more anxiety. My heart palpitations occur even when i am resting_ and i feel like i cannot even function like a normal person. At first i thought it was just my anxiety and maybe i needed to get my thyroid checked_ but now i know the Nuvaring is contributing to my symptoms too. Please be aware of your physical and mental state while on this bc. My symptoms have increased and worsened gradually over the past 3 years from the Nuvaring.,,F,24,3  years,1/6/2014Email,Nuvaring

104, 1, Vacation,Well_ the only reason I was using nuvaring is because I was going on vacation and did not want my period during that time. So one months duration of the ring was all I needed. On day one (sunday)and two I was fine with it. I then started to notice that I was feeling agitated_ having mood swings _ blurred vision_ tiredness and overall not feeling like myself. I tried not to think and obsess about it being the ring's cause_ I really wanted it to work well with my body's chemistry. As the days progressed into the weekend (Saturday) I had enough. It's so strange that estrogen would have such an effect on your system. I think the MOST deciding factor of removing this foreign object is the lack of desire to have sex!!! I have a very healthy appetite sexually and it had diminished it. I don't know if it was psychological because of my moodiness and overall not feeling well so I could care less about having sex or if the estrogen in the ring had an effect on that as well. The only form of bc that worked really well with me after having two children was the iud. It had no side effects_ I'm fact it made my periods lighter and more tolerable. I had my iud in for 10 years and then decided to have another child and upon removal_ I became pregnant within two months. If anyone is on the fence about birth control_ I would really look into an iud for i felt fortunate to have had it suggested to me by my obgyn twenty years ago and lived a happy healthy sexual being and not having to worry abou,,F,44,6  days30 mg,4/7/2013Email,Nuvaring

Loved it for the first year or so and had no issues besides acne. I was starting to feel bipolar and my doctor put me on anti depressants and anxiety meds (tried FOUR kinds) with no luck. Stopped those and stopped nuvaring after a breakup. Felt awesome during my time off birth control entirely. Been with my current man for 9 months and restarted the ring a month in. Nothing but hell since. I argue over nothing and have zero patience. I'm a total bitch now. I have the worst acne on my face you could ever imagine and nothing will help it.

I never connected the drug with my depression but it started about the same time/a little before my skin started clearing up. I went off the drug for a few months- the wetness was driving me crazy. My skin got worse but my emotions improved (I thought I was just less stressed). I've been back on it for a few months now to help my skin. I've started to become depressed and emotional all over again. It's effecting my performance in gradschool.

I was hoping the consistent amount of hormone delivery may help with my awful pre-menstrual exacerbation of a pre-existing depressive disorder.

I weighed 145lbs previously and currently weigh 139_ but this increases with water retention oftentimes to 148 and back down again.

I've been on four other pills and tried the Mirena IUD and all were intolerable.

118, 4, to prevent pregnancy,Overall i am extremely pleased with the nuva ring. It doesn't make me moody and emotional like most other birth controls. I don't have excruciating painfull cramps like I used too. I also enjoy that my actual periods are shorter and lighter. The only thing I do not like or understand is i have been on it now for 4 months and my cycle is regular_ but I'm having a problem to where at anytime i may start spotting during the middle of the month and sometimes it continues through until my period. The only thing that stops it then is when i change out the ring. This is usually induced when I remove it for a brief period of time or have sex with my husband. I honestly do not understand why this is or what is going on. I know this is normal the 1st maybe even 2nd month while your body is getting adjusted to it but I don't think it is normal for this to continue. Is anyone else having this problem? Also my skin is naturally oily from Italian blood my skin broke out pretty bad the 1st month but subsided after now my face is 100percent clear of blemishes. I've been small my whole like around 110 to 120 I'm 5'6. I cannot say it makes you gain alot of weight however it does help with maintaining weight though. I was 112lb when i found out i was pregnant with my son last year. I went up to 149lbs. I immediately lost basically all of it after giving birth. I think i was at 129.

All the time that I used the NuvaRing I thought it was great. Now thatI am without it & after reading these reviews I firmly believe it was the cause of my non-existant sex drive & very frequent & intense headaches. I have struggled with headaches since I was about 12 years old but they had gotten much more out of hand the last several months I used the NuvaRing. I have a busy schedule & a small child so I really thought the loss of sex drive was just related to my life circumstances.

Therefore_ I think you need to be less judgemental and rude about other's lifestyles. Just because some of us gained weight from this drug does NOT mean we sit around eating fatty foods all day. Some of us had this problem even while maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. Anyway_ when I was on the Nuvaring_ I was constantly bitchy_ mean and never had a sex drive_ not to mention my weight was climbing_ even though I watched what I ate and tried to work the weight off many times to no avail. However_ as soon as I got off of it_ I felt better_ more sexual_ and my weight dropped dramatically.

Then out of no where I started feeling sick_ nauseous_ feeling the need to throw up_ and hot flashes like crazy. I took it out an felt fine but all of the sudden my face broke out BAD!!!! And I started to get a bit puggy. I went to the doc and she suggested I try it again if it worked good before it should again right? Wrong_ I am feeling sick again and now having stomache cramps that come and go but are soooooo painful. Also I have lost all interest in everything (school_ work_ my child_ my husband_ sex) My doc told me to wait it out but I think I am going to listen to my body. If my body doesn't like it_ neither do I. This BC may be great at first but don't be suprised If after a year or so you start to suffer.,,F,21,1  years,8/14/2012,Nuvaring

I suggested the NR but the dr didn't think that was it.  I also contacted my GYN and she told me to continue using it.  After about 10 days the chest pains went away.  I had cramps when I was on my period_ which I never had before_  throughout the month I would have lower abdominal pain_ and I had a lot of discharge.  Eventually I experienced extreme headaches every day_ sore throat_ very tired_ memory loss_ confusion_ my balance was off_ constant nausea_ my knees hurt when I walked_ my arms and legs (especially my right leg) would shake when I would stand and occasionally when I would sit_ when I would read it would take me a minute to figure out a word (easy words) it was like my brain was on a delay or I would read the word incorrectly.  I also had pains in my legs and arms. Once I had all of these symptoms I went to my general dr and told her about my symptoms and told her I was using the NR but she didnt think that was it. The nurse and the dr looked puzzled when I explained to them all the issues I was having.  The dr suggested a thyroid problem or lyme disease_ so I had blood work done_ but again everything was negative.  Then I found this board and read through all the postings and found that a lot of what I was experiencing other women on NR had experienced too.  So I took it out immediately!

Well they didn't find anything wrong so I said that if they didn't find anything I would be taking the NUVAring out because that was the only foreign thing in my body! And I thank GOD that I did!

I don't have pain in my stomach anymore at all when I eat or even drink for that matter. The side effects after taking it out is a whole other story! Emotional and crying for no reason i think my hormones are going crazy_ but I am thankful to GOD that its getting out of my system and it will not be going back in!!!

I experienced a ton of anxiety_ tight chest and my left leg and toes went numb. It was an awful experience. Many people don't realize that they might not need that extra estrogen and by talking a natural progesterone cream would work. Using a natural progesterone cream alleviates pms and Some pain before period. I will never use another birth control ever again.

It is important to note_ though_ that I was taking my Nuvaring so that I was getting my period 4 times a year; which in theory_ according to my doctor_ was supposed to be fine. I don't know what I'm going to do about birth control in the future.

245, 5, heavy menstrual bleeding/cramps,The very first month I inserted my first nuva ring was all nauseas and tender breast_ but my menstrual cycle for the very first time on the nuva ring reduced from 7 days to 5 days and no cramping(maybe just a little bit for one day 2 to 3 hours_ but with 2 Advils I would get rid of it and they wouldnt comeback.) the next 2 -3 months the side effects decreased only having nauseas 3 days after inserting the new ring lasting about 1 day or 1⁄2 a day only_ the best method for me to get rid of the nauseas was to eat a lot of times but small bites not big meals and case close ;) I still experienced mild cramping maybe for 1 or 2 days but nothing out of the ordinary like I said Advils take the mild pain away. Now I only have my period for about 3 to maybe 4 days sometimes and it is not heavy at all_ and I do experience mild tender breast 2 to 3 days prior to my period(to me is just a way of my body reassuring me the nuva ring works and you are not pregnant),Before using the nuva ring i used 3 different types of birth control pills all of them either made me broke out a lot and had nauseas and if i had forgotten to take the pill one day and i had to take 2 at a time i would get horrible nauseas and at one point it made me vomit_ so that was it with the pills and trying to decide which one was better(i did it first because of the money_ pills being less expensive) but i can tell you i dont regret going on the Nuva ring_ my doctor explained me that the nuva ring had high doses of hormones than the pills he had prescribed me but because was vaginal it might help me better with the symptoms i was going through with the pills. I can tell you the first month i used it i didnt see any pimp balls growing on my face(if anything they were disappearing) I can also tell you that i believe the nuva ring acts different on each body for example; i had nauseas right away when i inserted my first ring(but these nauseas weren't that bad they were very manageable_ what helped get rid of the nauseas was eating or having a small bite of something_ the 1st period I had while on it_ wasnt heavy and didnt experience the horrible cramps I used to have which was the whole reason why I decided to take part of using contraceptives_ that period lasted for about 5 days and going from 7 days of having a period to me it was fantastic_ the nauseas within the next 2 -3 months disappeared and eventually my period went down to 4 days and,F,22,10  months 1X D,12/5/2011Email,Nuvaring

Mild increase in sensitivity.During the first week or two I noticed a large increase in discharge_ that has leveled out to a normal amount for the most part. The dryness during sex hasn't_ it takes me  much longer to become adequately lubricated for sex and is less than it usually was. Breast tenderness was very mild only noticed it if I bumped or touched my breast firmly. Increased sensitivitty was mostly crying at sad movies_ plays_ ASPCA commercials and such_ no real mood problems. I would reccomend this to someone to try.

The nurse even told me that if I just put another ring in instead of leaving it out for the period week_ I could just skip my periods. However it was awkwardly uncomfortable - always feeling like its falling out. Didn't bother me during sex_ but destroyed my desire to have sex. Caused moodiness and crying spells. I was willing to even deal with some of these effects_ but the dryness was (and still is) driving me crazy. I finally took it out about 4 days ago and I am feeling some changes_ but this dryness hasn't gone away yet. I will never use nuvaring again.

For the first year and a half i did not notice any major side effects_ other than pesky yeast infections which i solved by removing the ring weekly and rinsing it under cold water. this seemed to help that problem. After the first year+ I noticed major changes in myself. My mood became increasingly unpredictable. I felt anger_ anxiety_ depression_ increased emotions all around. I often became so enraged I was breaking things_ storming out of the house and yelling about incredibly harmless issues. As my emotional roller coaster increased_ it was incredibly frightening to have self-harming thoughts due to frustration with myself_ not realizing  the problems were being caused by other side effects.

I would eat until it was hard to breathe and still be hungry. After a month of nonstop weight gain_ I started working out every day for at least 3 hours a day. I continued to gain weight. No amount of diet and working out would make me drop a pound. About the middle of the 4th month I started cramping for no reason. No blood just discharge. Now the first week of ring 5_ I started spotting. Terrible cramps. Heavy bleeding. To use the bathroom feels like the worst cramps I've ever had. I don't know what its from. But when i take it out to use the bathroom its fine. It's painful to have sex_ and do anything in that area. I finally had enough yesterday and removed it. Feeling better_ still terrible cramps and bleeding.  If you can handle gaining 1/3 of your body weight in a month or two_ really gross discharge_ and always being hungry_ maybe it will work better for you.

Once the ring has been removed I become extremely exhausted and could care less about anything or anyone. This is NOT me. I feel I'm in a fog. My speech sometimes seems slower than normal. All I want to do is lie around or sit around. Again_ this is NOT me. It takes an act of congress to get me to do anything physical. Once the ring has been removed all I can think about is food! Food_ food_ food. It seems my body has a difficult time in starting my periods every month. It's very odd and I truly don't know how else to explain this feeling. I have feelings of hopelessness_ and I cry. I thought all of this was just me or just the month but obviously after coming to this website it's possibly NR. This is only my experience.

At first I was attributing this sudden change on my switch from prozac to welbutrin but honestly the timing doesn't add up. I had an easy time coming off prozac and went without an anti-Depressant for a good 2 months with no problems. It wasn't until I started NR that all of this has happened. I also have no appetite_ and am nauseous all the time. After reading all of these shared experiences with NR I'm taking it out.,,F,23,90  days 1X D,7/31/2011Email,Nuvaring

Im going to have to stop and I am disappointed because it was good otherwise. I dealt with the extremem vaginal discharge and after 4 months it went away.. however the burning never did..

287, 1, prevent pregnancy,I am an athlete who trains for running races of all distances from 5k to the marathon and swim competitively. I am also a schoolteacher. I started using the Nuvaring in 2006 and continued for the last 5 years. For the first year_ I didn't notice the side effects too much_ but later_ after a while_ I noticed my weight beginning to increase by 40 pounds!!!! For running and swimming competition this was insane. I stopped working out and felt like a total blimp! I got off the ring about three weeks ago and have noticed a huge change in my weight already!!! No more bloated stomach_ bigger and heavier legs_ excess all over my body. I couldn't run and would go on long runs of 15 miles_ and my weight would never go down_ stayed the same no matter what I ate or did for exercise/training. I even dieted and nothing was working_ my weight was staying the same. It was unbelievably frustrating. Also_ I felt nausea and my mood swings were terrible.

Small problems began to seem like huge problems. I began to feel hopeless and paranoid. This is NOT like me. I have been through MUCH rougher times in my life and I am usually very resilient. I don't care to do anything for myself. I am snappy_ moody and sad. I took it out today and will NEVER EVER use this product again. In fact_ I am staying away from hormones for as long as I can help it. This has been a terrible experience. I know everyone is different_ but this has made the past two weeks a living hell.

290, 1, Birth Control,Depression_ mood swings_ acne_ no sex drive_ vaginal dryness_ anxiety... the list goes on...,I started taking NV 2 years ago_ I was wary to start with because I had a lot of side effects when I was taking the pill_ but my gyno convinced me the NV was a lower dose_ easy to use_ and shouldn't have the same side effects. WOW was that wrong. The first 6 or 8 months I was on NV things were OK_ my sex drive was gradually decreasing_ but it wasn't hugely noticable since I was so busy. By the time I reached a year on NV my sex drive was gone_ I had anxiety_ and was getting depressed. Over the last year the side effects kept getting worse and worse_ I would be happy one minute and crying the next_ I would get anxious about EVERYTHING_ I kept having breakouts_ and I was becoming deeply depressed. I finally made the decision to take out the NV after having a long discussion with my boyfriend_ we hadn't had sex in a month b/c I was never in the mood_ and I had turned into a different person. Now that the ring is out I feel like I am getting back to normal. For anyone who is considering taking NV beware_ the side effects are serious!,F,26,2  years 1X D,6/29/2011,Nuvaring

My doctor has advised giving it a couple more months_ but I'm not sure I'll stick it out. I have NEVER had vaginal dryness and am now dealing with that. I've been dealing with some personal issues_ so I'm sure some of the moodiness can be attributed to that. However_ I still feel that my emotions are more heighthened than normal.

I am 38 yrs old and I started Nuvaring after using only condoms as contraceptive method for several years. However this time things were different. For the 3 motnhs I used nuvaring I had headchaes every day_ and horrible migraines arounnd my period. So bad that I could not function properly. I I also felt depressed and got into horrible fights with my husband_ I felt like I was going crazy_ feeling like crying for no reason. I also gained 7 lbs in three months. I am 5'3 and used to weigth 122 lbs at my heaviest. I was always hungry and no matter how much excercise I did_ i could not get rid of the weight. Nuvaring does not work for me and I am now off it. I am starting a new contraceptive pill Lo Loestrin but I had seen the comments here and now I am afraid to start with this one. I am not sure what I should do now.

He makes me so happy_ but even though I am happy on the inside_ I wasn't able to show it on the outside.  My fiancé always complained that I didn't smile_ and I wanted to_ I just couldn't.  I never wanted to be around family and let family be with my baby.  I got anxious when family was around my baby.  I had a totally lack of desire for sex...

297, 1, pregnancy prevention,Terrible acne_ heightened anxiety_ depression_ bouts of explosive anger_ negative feelings_ fuzzy-headed_ weight gain_ increased hsv2 outbreaks.,Wow_ so I started taking the ring and it coincided with some personal issues so I had not put together that some of these issues could be with the ring. I have dealt with far worse things with way more grace than I have my current issues. Month one the symptoms were not as bad as this past month. I became super anxious and really sad. I still feel that way (I just took the ring out two days ago). My anger feels explosive. I actually have to just avoid people even those I care about because I feel like I'm struggling to retain my composure and not_ like_ throw things. This is so unlike me. But I thought the negative reactions and sadness were due to my personal situation and that I was just losing control. That is_ until I started doing some research to find that I am not alone. I have also gained weight even though I'm doing more and eating better. What really prompted me to look into other side effects were the huge pimples I started getting! Which I have never experienced in my life. Also_ I realized my brain has been sluggish. Watching jeopardy with my boyfriend (I usually get a few) I was missing questions I knew because i couldn't get the answer out fast enough....I've also had an hsv2 outbreak both months when i've otherwise only had one per year! Its likely the increased anxiety..I think I'll take a few days of crampy bitchiness over constant negativity and sadness.

My nipples were ALWAYS sore_ and I just couldn't be happy. I would go days without smiling.

Starting 8 months in till now_ completely misery - bad mood swings_ depression for no real reason.  Total lack of sex drive and when it does happen_ it is so painful. I thought it couldn't be the BC because I was on it for long enough to be past any symptoms.  I researched the effects of long term BC use and other people's symptoms after being on for a year plus and I am personally done putting synthetic hormones into my body.  I just stopped taking it so I can only hope my body and mind return to their natural state.

305, 4, birth control,weight loss,Do your research before starting any method of birth control: a majority of side effects women list here are common side effects of all hormonal birth control methods. Life events could also contribute to a lot of the complaints: post-pregnancy_ post-honeymoon_ losing a baby and even going to college can cause weight gain_ depression_ mood swings_ loss of sex drive_ etc. Anyway. I switched from Seasonale to Nuvaring because I was beginning to miss pills pretty frequently_ which kind of defeats the purpose of birth control.  I've had good experiences with the Nuvaring. My periods are pretty similar to what I had on Seasonale: lighter and more manageable. My cramps are even more manageable on Nuvaring. Can't feel it during sex_ have not had a UTI since I began it. I do have a lower sex drive but I can't fairly contribute that to Nuvaring: I'm also on a pretty high dose of SSRIs and have been before I began it. Overall_ theoretically women should have an easier time with the ring because of the ease of use_ lower dose of hormone and continual dose of hormone as opposed with the pill.

It was convenient_ my periods were lighter_ less cramping_ no mood swings and my sex drive was healthy.  About 6 months into the ring_ I started having constant yeast infections and general vaginal irritation.  I saw my doctor 4 times in regards to these_ however it was brushed off and said that this drug should help the infections_ not cause them. Also_ recently I have had burning and swelling during and after sex_ which is causing issues with my boyfriend since he is afraid to touch me.  I am going to take this out and see if this will take these symptoms away as it is continuously interfering with my daily life.  It is extremely convenient and hope that others can find it helpful to them but especially after reading similar issues in other women_ I will be trying something else.,F,27,2  years 1X M,3/27/2011Email,Nuvaring

323, 2, Period regulation,Severe depression (suicidal),When i first started nuvaring_ i was thrilled that the spotting that i experienced using other birth controls was not a problem. it definitely worked for me in that respect.however_ i have experienced such serious depression that my friends and family literally took away my next 2 months' supply. i was considering giving it another month to level out_ but i don't know if i'd live through it to be honest.however_ everyone responds differently to any medication. i loved it other than the serious depression_ so hopefully this does not happen to you. however_ if you notice the depression_ be sure to remind yourself that you aren't alone and that it isn't all in your mind.,F,23,1  months 1X M,3/22/2011,Nuvaring
324, 5, Pregnancy prevention.,None.,So far so good. I've tried so many birth controls: diaphragms_ the patch_ condoms_ the pill_ the rhythm method (which was way too confusing for me) and even though the hormonal contraceptives worked I had major mood swings from the fluctuations in estrogen_ and the barrier methods just weren't reliable enough (I learned that the hard way). I was really skeptical about trying another hormone but I've been taking nuvaring for months now and I feel fine_ and so relieved that it's in and working and I don't have to worry about it more than once a month. I suppose it's because the amount of hormone that is released is continual and low and that's the only reason I can think of for the lack of mood swings but whatever it is it's working for me.,F,28,4  months 1X M,3/20/2011,Nuvaring

I started the NR a month and a half ago. The entire first month I had heavy spotting_ and extremely long and heavy periods to the point of anemia. I stuck with it because it was helping my vaginal infections and the obgyn said it would go away soon. After I put in the second ring my life became a living hell. I became extremely moody_ crying over songs on the radio_ and began having terrible anxiety attacks. Before the ring I was a happy_ joyful person but now I couldn't function and I was afraid of everything. I started skipping classes due to my anxiety and excessive crying. I started having frightening suicidal ideation about crashing my car or walking into the street. I couldn't remember the last time I felt happy. My sex drive was dead and I started questioning if I loved my boyfriend even though we were extremely happy before this. I didn't feel at all like myself. As  lay on the couch in anxiety fits I kept telling my mother_ THIS IS NOT ME AT ALL! I took the ring out two days ago and I have yet to escape the debilitating anxiety and depression. Hopefully I will get some peace soon. This should be used with extreme caution. It can really truly make your life a living hell.,F,18,1.5  months 1X M,3/18/2011,Nuvaring

At first I felt numb. I could tell that I wasn't experiencing excitement or enthusiasm. I also felt mentally dull and inarticulate. I thought it might even out_ so I figured I'd try it for a few months. But after a few months I lost track of what feeling good felt like_ and forgot that it started when I started the ring. After 4 months I started to develop dark patches on my face (ketosis) and went to a dermatologist a couple of weeks ago. Finally realized that the hormones were causing ketosis....but not until then did I realize that my irritability and slip into depression were also likely caused by the ring. Now I have to take a bleaching cream for my face which hurts like hell. Mind you_ when I started this drug I was totally in love. (I'm still in love -- but also have become very irritable and listless and it's affected my relationship). Thank god for this forum. I felt like I was losing my mind.

330, 5, Ease of use,,I have been on the nuva ring for 3 years.  Before that I was on birth control for about 10 years.  The Nuva ring was a blessing for me. No longer did I have to forget to take my medicine.  I have never had any strange side effects.  Honestly_ I used to have the ups and downs with my moods associated with taking the pill and when I started the NuvaRing - the ups and downs stopped.  My doctor mentioned that it could be due to the constant release of the hormone in the ring_ as opposed to taking a pill_ absorbing it_ spiking_ it wearing off and so on.   So that was quite a pleasure!    I do have a decreased interest in sex_ but this wasn't caused by the NuvaRing - I had that side effect from my previous birthcontrol pill - Orthotrycyline.   I think that is a standard side effect for most pills.   So for me_ it is something to work around and a MUCH better alternative to unwanted_ un planned children.    I think the NuvaRing is fantastic and would absolutely refer it to any family member or friends. Which I do quite often.,F,33,3  years 1X D,3/16/2011,Nuvaring

When I started taking this_ I had been with my new boyfriend for about 5 months and we decided to have sex. Before this_ I had been in an abusive relationship_ and had been going to see a psychologist since I was 12. (Which was the same time I met this guy. We were ""together"" until I was 19) Then I began this new relationship_ I didn't need therapy anymore_ my doctor released me_ I was so happy_ and always cracking jokes_ I felt like a completely new person. I had just started college and had a decent job_ I felt very independent and I loved everything about life. I hadn't ever remembered being that happy since I was a kid. Then I get put on Nuvaring because I can't remember to take pills. The relationship_ as all do_ became comfortable and I related my sexual issues to this. I figured because I was working a full time job and a full time student I was just too tired to think about sex_ but in the back of my mind I thought that it was strange. If he wanted to play around with me and act silly_ before I would laugh and play along_ but now I have to fake laugh so I don't sound mean and I just try to get away. I don't want him to touch me_ I don't want him to even say the word ""sex"" or I get very upset. And then I'll force myself to do it_ beca",F,20,21  days 1X M,3/9/2011,Nuvaring

343, 1, Birthcontrol,Severe Depression_ Extremely Moody_ Green Discharge_ No Sex Drive_ Weight Gain,My health provider suggested NuvaRing after I had my baby. Unfortunately my baby did not live after birth. I have 2 living children. After six weeks my husband and I started to have sex_ but I was not ready to have another baby because I was still morning my child . I was surprised that sex was amazing and I was feeling so close to my husband_ I was told that I could easily conceive after giving birth and got scared. I wanted to use a contraceptive that was effective.  5 days into using the NR I did not want to have sex. ( I loved having sex)_ the though of having sex was nauseating and emotional. At about the 7th day I noticed I started to have a green mucus like discharge. During my pregnancy I gained weight then gained even more weight (10Pounds) after 11 days.Then my husband noticed that I was moody with him and all my anger was focused on him. I would start crying for no reason and I thought that it was because of the passing of my new born. I was always crying and nothing_ not a girls night out_ not even a hug from my living children would make me happy.  Reading these reviews I see that this contraceptive has only made things worse for me physically and emotionally. I ran to the bathroom and pulled it out.

I actually was diagnosed with depression after the 4th week of being on NuvaRing and NEVER did I correlate the two until a friend mentioned it to me (which at the time_ I did disregard immediately).  I was put on an antidepressant.   Once I took out the NuvaRing_ it took about two to three weeks for me to feel back to normal and not so down in the dumps.  My world started to flip back to normal and it was like a breath of fresh air.  I thought it was the antidepressants doing the trick.  When I went to the doctor_ I literally told my doctor that I had no clue why I was so depressed because nothing depressing with going on in my life.  I was literally sleeping 20 hours straight and eating inbetween wakes causing me to gain 20 pounds within a two month period.  I blew up to 175 pounds.  I also got on phentremine in order to lose the weight I had gained significantly (highly recommend).  Anyhow I dumped the antidepressant and it has been at least four months since NuvaRing had been out of my system before I tried it again (because as I mentioned earlier_ I did not correlate the two).

I have noticed some of the side-effects that others have listed_ including headaches_ cramps (sometimes about a 5/10 but they never last as long as typical menstrual cramps)_ a discharge_ lowered sex drive (sometimes I don't even want to flirt or play around_ or even be touched)_ wanting to sleep for 12+ hours_ increased appetite (especially for carbs) and general malaise.

364, 5, I needed to stop my painful periods,Low Sex Drive,I'll never get off of this drug_ ever. I have horrible disruptive_ painful periods that put me out of commission for days. In college_ my doctor suggested Nuvaring to be used continuously. I had been on OrthoTriCyclen a few years before and experienced awful side effects_ so I was nervous about getting on a hormonal contraceptive. Since it's low doses of estrogen_ I don't have any side effects other than low sex drive. That's not a big deal_ since I'm single now_ and I'd rather have a low sex drive than painful heavy periods. Now I only have periods quarterly (I use three nuvarings back to back_ and take it out for a week after the third ring-so 9 weeks on the ring 1 week off.). No PMS ever_ cramps only 4 times a year_ and I'm saving so much money on tampons and ibuprofen. Talk to your doctor before you use it this way_ as Nuvaring isn't indicated for continuous use.

I have also had vaginal discharge_ but nothing major. I would still recommend at least trying the ring because these symptoms could show up with any type of birth control.

It's been incredibly effective this whole time_ I only rely on my ring as my form of birth control and always always always get my period on time.

But it gave me the uncomfortable weight gain problem. I gained 10 pounds the first two months_ which nothing else besides pregnancy has done. I'm still going back and forth about whether or not to continue using it. The discharge is very inconvenient for sexual activity as well.

I started taking it because I was inconsistent with the pill_ and condoms irritate my vag_ plus my sister seems to love it.  But_ now I never feel like having sex and when I do I'm dry which makes it painful.  Not to mention_ I can feel the ring pushing against my innards during sex.  I feel so bad for my boyfriend because I used to love having sex and now he's lucky if I'm open to it once every 3 weeks. Not to mention that I love good sex so to not be interested is just frustrating.  Also_ over the last couple of years I've noticed I've become incessantly tired and find myself feeling emotionally down way too often.  I thought maybe it was just something natural that happens at 27 but I still feel like I'm too young to be experiencing all this. So_ I've tried all these different things to improve my physical and emotional health:  cook more at home_ eat more fresh veggies and fruits_ workout regularly_ been seeing a therapist and have done some major spiritual soul searching.  All this has helped a little bit_ but my body sure still ain't functioning like it should be. So I'm gonna take the ring out tonight and look for alternative contraceptives that don't involve messing with my body's natural state and start a new chapter.

Me and my boyfriend have tons of sex and I still love it. AND YES im still able to get super wet. Before I used to get severely heavy periods and now my periods are light and almost non existent by comparison. I was always pretty much a moody grumpy person and I dont really feel like nuvaring has intensified any of these aspects of my personality. If anything it helped me probably calm down. I never gained any weight off nuvaring other then from my own doing of eating too much junk food. It helps to clear my acne and makes me feel confident about having sex and not getting pregnant. The only negative side effect I have had from nuvaring is that sometimes i have ALOT of discharge and its pretty gross. Pretty much it only lasts a couple of days and then everything goes back to normal but it doesnt smell weird or bad or at all. Nuvaring does put more estrogen into the system which is why I could understand a woman being more emotional but weight gain and mood swings are all up to the individual how they control them. I can control opening my mouth and lashing out at someone its common sense. And i can control not sitting around and eating alot of fatty foods and never exercising. As you get older your metabolism naturally slows down. Therefore it takes more dilligence and exercising the older you get to maintain the same body weight as you did even three years ago.

At first I thought I was being a hypochondriac so I ignored it the first 2 days. But now it seems to be more consistent so I decided to look up the side effects before I jumped to the conclusion that it may be something else more unlikely like my guy burning me. First thing that pops up on the Nuvaring site is VAGINAL INFECTIONS. I have a doctor appt tmrw to be sure but I was completely fine before and now I'm constantly doing pantyliner changes to avoid having to smell the discharge. Also I noticed dryness during sex.

So now I have to do other blood tests to find out whats wrong. I think it's all caused by the NuvaRing because ALL symptoms started around the same time...1-2 weeks after I started using the ring. I just hope they will go away cause I can't take it much longer. I'm a very healthy person and eat a healthy diet.

So he's had to watch my downward spiral that started with a bladder infection that inevitably gave my a yeast infection. After feeling so crappy and tired all the time_ I began to lose touch with friends and became extremely moody_ which he blamed himself for. After seeing this change in myself_ I became anxious and then depressed to the point of needing anti-anxiety medication. I also gained a whole lot of weight. Since I wasn't very active during this time period due to my isolation and fatigue_ I gained it a lot quicker then other more active girls would have. So after finally discovering that my hell I was going through was caused by a birth control_ I took it out immediately and threw it away. I can't believe my doctor would prescribe me something with such extreme side affects. My boyfriend and I are just sticking to condoms and other methods that don't include birth control. Its seriously one of the worst things you can do to your body. Hormones are super important and they need to be balanced. Estrogen makes us women feel extremely moody_ bloated_ and crampy. Try feeling like that all the time. That's what birth control does because it raises your estrogen levels to trick your body into thinking its pregnant.

You have to realize that people with good results dont get online to talk about it like people with bad reactions do.  The only reason I did was because I got the IUD recently and thought to myself_ ""i wonder if these are just bad reactions_ so ill go see what people said about the nuvaring_ since it was great for me""  and of course all i see are extreme cases.  Im sure youre wondering why i switched.  I have never liked the idea of having chemicals and artificial hormones in my body.  and also because i had messed up with my nuvaring reinsertion dates several times and it would mess up my period (MY fault_ not the ring's_ obviously) and i even became pregnant from messing up (and the times i wasnt pregnant i always worried that i was since i messed up).  With an IUD i dont have to worry for 10 years.  but anyway the Nuvaring was great. always had a naturally strong sex drive_ which didnt change","...i would even get it in sometimes and think ""thats not sitting right"" so id take it out til it was in place right.  but again that didnt happen all the time and it's only once a month_ a small price to pay.  someone mentioned they had to wear their ring during their period with tampons.  i did this all the time.  my period started usually a week after i took the ring out_ which is the time you put a new one in.  but again_ no problems.  I do remember being very conscious of it when i first started it.  I would think about it so much that i could ""feel"" it and always worried it bothered my guy.  Neither were true.  After getting used to it after the first month i rarely thought of it (which is probably why i kept messing up on the dates to remove and reinsert).  I had several partners during my 4.5 years using the ring and not one complained.  I even made sure to ask occasionally.  no complaints_ they cant feel it_ or dont pay attention.  though i did have one boyfriend say it was almost like a toy_ so he liked it =P  Anyway_ dont be overwhelmed by the negative comments.  Remember that everyone is different. if you dont dwell so much on it_ its not as big of a deal as you think it is_ like how i was at first.  and also_ i never ever had problems with my ring being the cause for a condom falling off.  ive never even heard that before!

By nothing I mean that I didn't even want to be touched. I would quickly lose my temper with my boyfriend over the smallest things. I just took it out and praying my body will bounce back soon. I would rather deal with a pill everyday than deal with side effects that turn me into someone that I am not.,F,31,21  days 1X M,11/27/2010,Nuvaring
395, 3, Prevent children,Anxiety_ depression_ severe vaginal dryness_ slight irritation during intercourse_ headaches_ breast tenderness_ crazy discharge.,I been on NR for a little over 3 years not because of choice though. I have taking just about every pill form of BC the shot and the patch my body rejected all those forms and I'd bleed the entire time I'd take them. My last hope at the time was the NR my doctor refuse to do the iud since I haven't bared any children. At first it was alright then I noticed my va jay jay was dried up and sex was becoming painful I was getting thick discharge and couldn't keep a yeast infection away. Being in love and to not to want to have sex because it's painful due to the dryness is terrible I grew very depressed I pushed my boyfriend away. after sex I cried everytime I was beginning to hate myself. I didn't know how I was 21 and dry down under I got to the point where tampons are uncomfortable. I went to my gyno about the dryness and pain and she told me it was incurable and I needed to buy some lube and basically just deal with it. .I got to the point where I was cutting myself to deal with the stress of my sex life. My doctor put my on anti depressants however I still have the problem. Part of me wants to snatch out the ring and dump it but I can't risk the chances of children at this point in my life. It's hard to deal with. I still have sex with my boyfriend but it kills me not to be aroused by his touch or to be able to enjoy sex it makes me hate myself. The doctors have just pushed more meds on me instead if actually caring about my symptoms which makes me resent them as well.,F,23,3  years 1X O,11/23/2010Email,Nuvaring

Normally I feel I am a tough skinned female. Now I am an emotional wreck_ I am scared I am driving my husband away_ I feel like something is wrong when there is nothing.

I have typically steered clear of the pill because I didn't have much luck with it when I was younger.  I have also tried an IUD with no luck either.  So much for regulating my periods!

I literally just vomitted before writing this rating. I am a full time student and a single mom_ so I figured the stress had finally caught up with me. After reading all of your ratings_ I am so relieved to have discovered that the problem is the ring. I even thought that I could have been pregnant_ I was feeling so awful. Also after starting the NuvaRing_ I have experienced severe depression and have contemplated suicide many times this week. I am taking this thing out as soon as I get done posting this!!!

Thats when i realized i had all of the same symptoms as everyone else. i can never sleep at night_ and am always tired during the day. i have a lot of discharge_ but then during sex i have hardly any. i always feel sad or irritated and randomly burst out into tears for almost no reason. sex really isn't enjoyable for me because its constantly burning. at fist i thought this was because i was allergic to the condoms_ but have recently realized that its not that at all. i'm always moody but in the past six months_ its been worse than ever. always snapping at people and being a bitch. but more importantly than any of the other symptoms.. i have no sex drive anymore. and that is just not normal for me at all. its starting to take a toll on my relationship and i've had enough!! the devil ring is just not worth these changes. getting off this immediately.,F,19,6  months30 1X D,10/19/2010,Nuvaring

Everybody responds differently_ definitely. However_ I do seem to see a recurring pattern with girls and side effects they've experienced with Nuvaring: an extreme change in their discharge. It seems like every girl on here experiences increased discharge (or a decrease during sex). I just have a question_ though: when has it STOPPED COMPLETELY for you? I mean_ discharge is normal_ but when has the fluctuating stopped_ and when has your discharge gone back to normal? This is my third month_ and I just started noticing it this month...

I'd previously been on Ocella (generic Yasmin) which made me completely insane so I switched to Nuvaring. My only initial issue with Nuvaring is that it caused some discharge and sometimes had to be pushed back in again. However_ starting a few months ago I started having almost daily nausea. At first I thought I might be pregnant and having morning sickness but that did not turn out to be the case. It wasn't until I had a week without the Nuvaring in that I realized that must have been the cause of the nausea. It was AWFUL nausea too: I couldn't move or talk to people for hours while I was experiencing it. I also realized my sex drive had almost completely disappeared. I am considering switching to a copper IUD--so sick of birth control hormones messing up my body. The copper IUD does not have hormones so hopefully it won't mess with my emotions_ weight_ sex drive_ etc. Good luck ladies.,F,23,2  years 1X M,10/7/2010,Nuvaring

When i put the NR it took about a couple days before the nausea hit every night making it impossible to sleep. Every couple of nights i would wake up drenched in sweat. My boyfriend didn't understand why I was so moody - I was totally turned off did not want him to touch let alone have sex with me. I gained weight_ I'm rather small so when I started gaining weight my skin streched out making me have bulging vein visible. He thought I was pregnant after all the nausea_ mood swings_ and gaining of weight. I do not recommend this product.,F,19,3  weeks 1X M,8/28/2010,Nuvaring
436, 1, Prevent pregnancy,TERRIBLE ANXIETY AND PANIC ATTACKS.  Trouble sleeping.  Nausea. body aches. NO SEX DRIVE,During my time on the NR_ I have felt completely insane.  The few weeks of my first month using it_ I was so paranoid that my boyfriend (of 4 years) was going to leave me.  I would literally cry for no reason and ask him not to leave me.  As if that weren't bad enough_ I would wake up in the middle of the night with horrible leg pains. So bad that I would have to use a heating pad and Aleve to get back to sleep. All throughout my use with NR I have had no sex drive (which just isn't like me)  I believe the 2nd month is when the anxiety really triggered.  I am nervous ALL the time. (this is where the crazy really kicks in)  I changed my number and won't give it out to anyone_ because my phone ringing_ causes me to have a full blown anxiety attack.  And that's just one example.  All day long I'll be hit with a sudden anxiety attack_ for no reason.  I haven't left my house to go anywhere 'Social' since I started NR.  I have stopped talking to all my friends.  I am paranoid everyone is trying to ruin my life.  This morning I woke up and googled NR and anxiety_ and found all these horrific stories. (Though I am SO glad not to be alone)  Last night_ (lying awake worrying about everything) I managed to convince myself that I more than likely have cervical cancer.  For no reason. which of course_ sent me into a crying and anxiety fit.  The paranoia and anxiety_ and dis-socialism_ just isn't me.

I switched to the Nuvaring in May.At first_ I thought it was great & simple. Just slip it in and forget about it! Well about 2 months later I began to notice things..An increase in vaginal secreation & irritaion. The Nurvaring was also very noticable during sex. I also began to notice a change in my sexual drive...I could go weeks without it and didnt even want to do it most of the time. After using the Nuvaring for 2 months I noticed that sex began to feel different than it did before..It was a numbing sensation. I am highly considering going back to the pill unfortunately.,F,19,3  months 1X M,8/24/2010,Nuvaring

My doctor told me to wait 2-3 cycles to allow my body to heal completely before we tried again. Lost the baby beginning of July_ had the D&C July 15_ then waited nearly a month after the D&C for my period to return before starting the ring. By this time I was starting to feel like myself again after our loss_ but within a few days of inserting the ring I was having intense mood swings and headaches. I started getting angry with my husband over everything_ had no patience for our 18 month old daughter (who is so sweet and well-behaved)_ and couldn't sleep.  Every day I felt it get worse and worse. I actually was trying to see if my back aches were a known side effect when I found out how many other women have had the same experience and it clicked for me. I took out the ring for my ""week off"" and have decided not to insert the next ring_ but just use condoms for the next two months rather than wait to see if my body adjusts to the hormones over time.  Maybe if I were on it long-term things would balance out_ but for our short duration it's just not worth the many_ many side effects.",F,24,3  weeks 1X M,8/23/2010,Nuvaring

But the bloating is truly astonishing_ increasing with every month. I've gone up 3 trouser sizes in the past 5 months. I am not a baby about gaining weight on bc: it's part of the contract. But this is so sudden_ uncomfortable_ and surreal that I have no intention of keeping it going. I don't want to see how big I can get.

For the first 3-4 years_ things seemed to be progressing fine (especially since I never got pregnant). However_ the last 3 years have almost been hell on earth with all the mood swings_ out of control hormones_ cussing_ screaming_ emotional breakdowns at least once a month and to top it off_ an extremely decreased sexual drive (which is now causing problems with me and my fiance). I never attributed all of those symptoms to the NuvaRing_ I guess because I have never had issues with birth control prior to this and because my mom began having hormonal/peri-menopausal/pre-menopausal symptoms very early. When I would have my breakdowns_ I could call her and it's as though we were going through the same exact emotional moods. In talking with our pre-marital counselor_ she has deduced that perhaps all of these symptoms are a result of the NuvaRing.

At first I had none_ but after 2 months developed constant nausea and low mood. It was enough to stop using it and go back to latex free condoms.

Upon starting the Nuvaring I had an intense ""episode"" in my life_ although related to personal events_ I found myself significantly more anxious and paranoid. It got to the point where I had successfully convinced myself that I had contracted HIV when there was absolutely no reason to do so (I know_ very crazy). After this had settled_ and about 6 months after using the ring_ I balanced out. But I am still plauged by intense PMS symptoms_ especially on the Monday after I remove the ring_ which I have lovingly started calling ""Manic Monday"". My roommate and boyfriend are both utterly terrified of this day.

The loss of sex drive started to become a huge problem in my relationship with my boyfriend because I never wanted to be touched or have sex or even kiss.

I snap at any and everyone; I find myself crying at my desk at work more days than not. I will say it has worked effectively as birth control as my boyfriend and I rarely have sex anymore because I have ZERO LIBIDO. Even if I try to get in the mood_ we have to bust out the KY because I can't otherwise lubricate. Also_ when we do have sex_ the ring constantly comes out and never stays in place as it should. I'd been getting progressively worse and worse until finally_ my drama with nuva ring culminated in a catastrophic event of me running away in the night so no one could find me.

I noticed that I was a little irritable but I just thought it was the change in hormones and would go away. The irritability has gotten increasingly worse. My job used to be somewhat tolerable. But now I hate going to work. I can't focus or concentrate on anything. I feel anxious and unhappy all the time. I used to be a pretty laid back and happy person. I haven't been this unhappy in a long time. I've always been emotional but this is ridiculous. This is not me at all. I'm used to working out about 5-6 times a week and always enjoy the workouts_ but now I have NO ENERGY. I can barely get out of bed each day. My sleep patterns used to be fairly steady but have become erratic. Not to mention at the end of April_ I started having severe upper abdominal pains that the drs are still doing all of these expensive tests to try to diagnose and they have yet to find the cause. My digestive system is not happy and neither am I. I don't know who this person that I have become is_ but she has got to go.

IN DEFENSE OF THE NUVARING- I have to say_ so far_ it has proven to be the very best B.C. available FOR ME.  I know a lot of people have problems with it.  For me_ it has smoothed out my monthly moodiness_ the decreased levels of hormones thankfully still leaves me with SOME libido_ and it's easy to remember and take in & out.

In the beginning of my relationship I wanted sex more than my boyfriend did and now I can't stand thinking about sex.  The only positive thing about NR is the fact that you just set it and forget it for 21 days.  I just want to feel like me again.  This ring almost ruined my relationship with my now fiance.

475, 1, Birth Control,Mood swings including: severe depression_ anxiety_ paranoia_ irritability_ anger. Hair loss. Weight gain. Breast tenderness. Headache. Constipation. Loss of sex drive. Vaginal dryness. Fatigue.,In 9 months I gained 10lbs even though I work out daily and diet. The worst part of this drug was the mental torture it put me through. The depression got worst month by month_ it was PMS amplified by a million. I found myself uninterested in things that I usually enjoyed. I was tired and lazy all the time_ I had no motivation to do anything that caused my performance in school and work to go down. My irrational mood swings hurt my relationship with my boyfriend_ and It became so bad I spent days at home crying_ with no desire to go out. I at times had suicidal thoughts and became very close to admitting myself into a hospital so I wouldn't hurt myself. I know this all sounds crazy_ before starting the nuvaring I was a very happy_ healthy girl with no history of depression and I honestly blame the nuvaring for ruining that past couple months of my life. Please ladies_ be aware and cautious with this and other synthetic hormones_ it can really trigger your emotions for the worst. I don't want anyone to have to go through what I did_ but I do understand all women react differently do medicines and I feel the side effects just hit me a lot harder than some. Good luck to you all.,F,24,9  months 1X M,5/9/2010Email,Nuvaring
476, 2, prevent pregnancy,My friends told me of the Nuvaring and they both loved it.  I asked my doctor being that I am a smoker which would be better for me for bc.  She stated that nuvaring isn't systemic_ so I felt it to be a safer choice for me.  I had just started the Nuvaring last week.  I NEVER had a problem reaching an orgasm prior to this week.  As of this week_ I cannot reach orgasm_ no matter how hard we try.  I am calling my doctor first thing in the morning on Monday and going back to the pill.  I also am experiencing an increased in thick vaginal discharge and a strange odor.  I am VERY clean and conscious of my hygiene to the point that this too is driving me nuts!!!!  I have not had any other side effects though.  I am prone to migranes_ but I have yet to get one since I started the ring.  I did not gain any weight_ but I can tell you that my appetite has diminished.

But 6-7 months after taking it I began to not have any interest in having sex. It would hurt when we attempted to have sex_ kind of like a raw_ burning_ internal feeling. Also_ it would scrath my boyfriends penis and would leave little bumps. I HATE NUVARING.,F,23,8  months 1X D,5/6/2010,Nuvaring

All of this in less than two months.,I switched to Nuvaring from Yasmin because Yasmin was giving me really nasty crippling migraine headaches (I had never experienced migraines before that) and I was also hoping to free myself from not having to take a pill once a day unfortunately I got every horrible and painful side effect that one can get from birth control_ even a couple really serious side effects that are listed in the contact your doctor immediately category. I have been absolutely miserable the entire time I have taken Nuvaring and based on my experience I would not recommend it.,F,28,2  months0.120 mg 1X M,5/5/2010,Nuvaring

It does thicken any vaginal discharge but I believe is intended as part of contraception.,I switched from oral birth control for ease_ lower dose of hormones and one less thing for my liver to process.

482, 2, pregnancy prevention,loss of sex drive_ dryness_ pain during/after sex_ burning/tearing sensation,I think nuva ring is really convenient and I had no acne/weight gain/mood swings with its constant low dose of hormones.  It killed (!) my sex drive_ I'm pretty sure.  My husband and I had been racking it up to law school_ wedding stress_ you name it_ but I've finally figure out it started around the time I started nuva ring.

483, 5, regulate cycle,None... Maybe some occasional mood swings and cramps during actual period_ but that's just part of being a woman,I have been on the Nuvaring about 3 years now and I personally have had no problems with it. I had horrible periods that would last sometimes for months at time. Now_ although I do experience some menstrual cramping and irritability_ my periods are practically non-existent. They are extremely light and last for about 2-3 days. And as far as the cramps and mood swings go_ they were FAR worse before I went on the Nuvaring. I love that I can skip periods if I want to. It's incredibly convenient to not have to take a pill everyday and I like that it's a low dosage of hormones.  I have NOT experienced any of the common side effects other people have stated such as the headaches_ lack of sex drive_ nausea_ depression_ etc. Although_ I know other people who have taken the Nuvaring and hated it_ I think the MOST important thing is that it works for me! I  recommend that people at least try this_ if it doesn't work_ then it's not right for you (and that's OK). Everyone's body is going to react differently and it's not like they can make a miracle drug that works perfectly all the time for every single person and has zero side effects.,F,21,3  years 1X M,4/20/2010Email,Nuvaring

487, 2, prevent pregnancy,fatigue_ vaginal dryness_ loss of sex drive_ pain during sex_ longer periods,I was dead set on taking Nuva Ring because of its convenience of once a month insertion. I cannot stay on the Nuva Ring due to such a decrease in my sex drive. I don't even want to be touched_ and I used to be in the mood all the time.  I have felt no climax during sex since I have been on the Nuva Ring. It is depressing and effects other aspects of my life especially as a newlywed.  I have also been exhausted by noon everyday_ even though I get 8 hours of sleep every day. I cannot determine if this is from the Nuva Ring but it is a possibility.,F,25,5  months 1X M,4/16/2010,Nuvaring
488, 3, To help menstruating,Loss of sex drive_ hair loss_ mood swings_ headaches_ breast soreness_ weight gain_& loss of energy.,Nuvaring is super convenient and helps me have an easier-going period. My cramps used to be horrible but now they're great. However 6 months into taking th NR_ I kept trying to figure out what was causing all these weird things that keep happening to my body. I am young and healthy and should not be having 0 sex interest or sleeping 10-13 hours + a day. I couldn't figure out why I wasn't as interested or could even entertain the idea of sex. I used to not be like that and the only drug/medication I take is Nuvaring. I feel so aggravated and hopeless. So many horrible BC's in the market.,F,20,1  years 1X M,4/15/2010,Nuvaring

I am prone to depression so this was definitely NOT a good choice for me.,As soon as I removed the Nuvaring_ I immediately noticed a change in my mood. The 'fog' lifted and I definitely don't feel like I'm missing out on life anymore. I will be going back to the Mirena IUD when I can afford it.,F,39,2  months 1X D,4/14/2010,Nuvaring

I have no sex drive whatsoever_ I feel like I would rather crochet a blanket_ or watch the price is right than have sex... sad indeed. I am in general more moody and emotional. At first I experienced extreme pain and burning following intercourse with the ring in. We found that removing it during sex and putting it back in right away afterward has worked_ although like I said I have been more inclined to knit a sweater set than I have been to have sex lately.

492, 2, birth control,lack of sex drive_ migraines_ breast tenderness,I have used NuvaRing for over 4 years now.  I have loved how easy and effective it is to use.  I had a change in insurance and couldn't afford the prescription starting last July.  Once I stopped NuvaRing I realized how much more active my husband's and my sex life became_ but at that point I attributed it to other changes in our life.  In January I had to start on a contracceptive again due to medical reasons_ so of course_ I chose NuvaRing again_ and almost immediately my sex drive went away completely.  It has become a chore and I feel like something I have to do.  There are so many things that I love about NuvaRing_ but I am going to have to find another birth control solution because this is causing a huge rift in my marraige_ and this is a side effect that I absolutely cannot live with.,F,29,4  years 1X D,4/3/2010,Nuvaring
493, 5, Birth Control/Painful periods,Vaginal discomfort_ occasional breakthrough bleeding/spotting_ decreased hormonal acne,Before I went on birth control_ I would have incredibly heavy periods_ migraines lasting 8-10 days at a time_ cramps lasting for 5 days. Initially I tried to skip my period using Seasonale_ but just ended up getting constant spotting for up to 10 weeks of the cycle. I switched to this and use the ring for 24 days and take it out for 4. Some months I have a little spotting_ but for the most part my period is light now and the migraine only lasts 1-3 days.,F,33,3  years 1X M,4/2/2010,Nuvaring

The 2nd time I tried it I loved it_ with the exception (and the reason Im no longer loving it) it hurts. It seamed to press on my internal pressure points or something. I am fairly certain the 1st time I tried it _ the ring was alot more flexible_ thinner and comfortable,F,29,3  months 1X M,4/1/2010Email,Nuvaring
495, 5, Birth Control/PMDD,Increased discharge_ increased libido_ mild alleviation of PMDD symptoms.,I have been on a few different forms of birth control_ and so far I like the NuvaRing the best. It doesn't alleviate my PMDD symptoms as much as YAZ did_ but is far more effective in the alleviation it gives_ because it is more consistently delivered than when I was trying to remember to take a pill daily. I have noticed that I have increased discharge_ and increased sexual desire_ and that it has changed my natural odor a bit. I have headaches_ but those were present before I started on the Ring. As with all medical care and treatment one size does not fit all. Just because it does or doesn't work for me_ doesn't mean it will or will not work for you. Best to consult your doctor.,F,30,  1X D,3/11/2010History,Nuvaring

I took ten pregnancy tests by now as well as one blood test.I was bleeding for days when I first put it in. I had a very very light period the first time I removed it. I had cramps_ my breasts hurt and I think I am gaining weight. I will wait to take it out and hopefully get my normal period_ then I will use it for another month just to ease my mind and I will remove it. First month was crazy_ I slept for ten hours and was tired all the time. Even though it is getting better on my second ring I still think that I will remove it and go back to my normal intercourse(which never had me freak out whether Im pregnant or not),F,27,2  months??? 1X D,3/8/2010,Nuvaring

It's my first birth control_ so I have nothing to compare it to. I like how I can just have it in and not have to worry about taking a pill every day_ but I do have to take it out before sex because my boyfriend can feel it and it bothers him. I am a little disturbed at reading others' reviews on their side effects. I don't understand how some people can go through bad side effects and not know that they are experiencing the bad effects that 'say take it out if you get these'. I suggest you read and KNOW the side effects of any birth control you are taking so if you experience them you wont get hurt and then you know it may not be for you.

501, 3, birth control,tender breast_ decreased sex drive_ decreased wetness,I originally switched to the nuva ring_ from camilla_ which was an absolute nightmare.  Compared to all of the side effects of the camilla I could gladly accept the side effects that I have experienced from the Nuvaring.  My breasts are sore basically all the time_ but they aren't so painful to interupt my dialy activities.  The most annoying thing is being so dry.  Also_ when I do have a discharge it is thick and dries out quickly during sex.  We have pretty much had to resort to using some type of lubrication to keep things comfortable during sex.  I have had a decreased sex drive as well_ but i think that usually sex drive and wetness seem to go hand in hand (in my experience at least).  I haven't had any trouble with nausea_ or headaches.    It is not uncomfortable to wear_ and I have never had a problem with it falling out.  My boyfriend actually likes how it feels.  I think one of the best things about this birth control is that you dont have to take a pill everyday.,F,22,1.5  years 1X M,2/11/2010,Nuvaring
502, 1, birth control,Ordinarily_ I am a very happy person. Loving_ caring and very active. I was on Nuvaring for two months and just could not take the side effects any longer. Nuvaring made me want to be a mass murderer_ lost my sex drive completely_ cry when there was nothing to cry about_ no vaginal lubrication when I was turned on. ALSO_ I took out the nuvaring 3 weeks ago and I have had a headache EVERY morning I wake up. I currently have an appointment to see a doctor about it. It effects women differently I understand this but it made me feel like a monster.. I DO NOT recommend it to any woman I know.,,F,22,2  months 1X D,2/10/2010,Nuvaring
503, 2, To regulate menstrual cycles,Good: convenient_ very regular period_ no weight gain/lossBad: severe abdominal pain_ headaches_ chest/arm pain,I really did love the Nuvaring at first because of how regular it made my cycles. I am quitting it after a year because of how scary it is to be on. I think I could deal with weight fluctuations or cramps (minor things) but the side effects I experienced made me lose sleep. Every month when I took the nuvaring out I would feel chest/arm pain on my right side. Every time I would inhale or laugh_ my chest pain became worse. This happened EVERY month. I went to the emergency room in November for severe abdominal pain. They assured me it had nothing to do with my nuvaring yet I still have no diagnosis for that day. Needless to say_ I am officially through with the Nuvaring. Ladies_ please don't compromise your health for convenience.,F,23,1  years,2/1/2010,Nuvaring
504, 3, birth control,headaches_ migraine_ possible weight gain_ possible anxiety_ vision changes prior to and during off-week,I was on nuvaring for about 4 years and pretty happy with it_ because I travel a lot and would worry about taking pills at the correct time in different timezones. Some downsides to the ring as mentioned by others_ such as decreased sex drive_ etc. mentioned_ but not outweighing the ease of use benefits. Vision changes at end of cycle and off week were annoying and caused me headaches with monthly regularity. Last visit to the gynecologist made me concerned as I mentioned I had migraines_ and she told me it was counterindicated due to stroke risk_ but gave me a prescription when I described my aura-like symptom as lines or flashes_ which she thought were just from a hangover. (Ok_ this is possible too.) I know we shouldn't overreact from things online_ but looking up migraine auras did describe my symptoms and vision changes at the beginning of a big headache. Having had a brief migraine type headache with auras and sometimes nausea once a month for the past couple months_ I became concerned about the increased stroke risk and decided to stop the nuva at the end of last cycle.  (Now I wish they could figure out a way to put an older type hormonal b/c in this type of delivery method_ as I really liked the convenience. Nuva would be smart to license this technology to different drug makers_ as that would certainly be a bigger market opportunity and make women happy with an ability to use different hormone formulations than just the one.),F,32,4  years,1/29/2010,Nuvaring
505, 3, prevent pregnancy,yeast infections_ vaginal dryness,I'm almost 25 and married and I started using Nuvaring about 3 years ago when I switched from the patch. The first year I had no probs and no side effects. Into the second year I got my 1st yeast infection. Then I started getting them every 3-6 months consistently. I asked my gyno if they were from Nuvaring and she said no so I continued to use it. I also started to have vaginal dryness resulting in painful sex which resulted in lack of sex drive. I decided to stop Nuvaring this month so I will see how it goes...,F,24,3  years,1/26/2010,Nuvaring
506, 2, To regulate cycle,Headaches_ cramping_ pelvic pain_ breakthrough bleeding_ non-exsistent sex drive_ yeast infections,My doctor started me on Nuvaring to regulate my cycle and help with the severe cramping and pain I was having with my periods. Since I cannont remember to take a pill everyday my doctor recommended Nuvaring. The first week went fine other than a yeast infection and increase in the amount of headaches I would get. The second week I started lightly bleeding and cramping_ this continued for the next 3 weeks. I called my doctor and the nurse encouraged me to stick it out for another month or two and see if things got better. My second cycle went much better. I had no problems other than a yeast infection and some discomfort in my right ovary that went away after getting period. Third cycle went well until my period started 3 days before I was scheduled to take out the ring and I had severe cramping. I decided to try one more cycle. Fourth cycle was okay until I started cramping 5 days before scheduled to take out ring along with moderate pain in my right ovary. I am scheduled to take out my fourth ring tomorrow and I do not plan on continuing with Nuvaring. The only benefit I had while on Nuvaring was that my legs did not ache during my luteal phases like they normally do since I'm not ovulating (as far as I know). I plan on calling my doctor Monday and switching to something else. I don't think it was a high enough dose for me.,F,25,4  months,1/23/2010Email,Nuvaring

On Saturday (almost one week later) I woke up with very swollen feet and it was painful to walk.  It progressed and got worse as the day went on.  I started to feel bloated in my stomache area as well.  The next day (Sunday - one full week of having the ring in me) I woke up_ feet still swollen_ my stomache even more bloated_ started to have really bad cramps and proceeded to vomit over 6 times that day.  Finally around 3pm I took the ring out.  I have not vomited since then.  Today_ Monday - I still have some stomache cramping but not nearly as bad.  I will not be going back to this form of birth control.,F,30,7  days,1/18/2010Email,Nuvaring
508, 2, Birth Control,Nausea_ headaches_ fatigue and noticeable loss of energy_ significant hair loss_ lowered sex drive (not too severe)_ vaginal itchiness and secretion.,Im pretty young still so I havent been on a birth control for that long_ only about 3 1/2yrs now. I first started on a generic pill for about 3 months_ but it caused horrible nausea and migraines nearly everyday until I went to my gyno and got off of it. She then recommended me to try NuvaRing figuring that it was a lower dose of hormones and it wasnt being directly ingested to my stomach so she thought it wouldnt have the same side effects as the pill that I was previously taking. I have been on the Ring for about a year now_ and honestly for about the first 8 months that I was using it I loved it and thought it was the greatest thing I could ask for. Other than more vaginal secretions and itchiness_ I felt much better than I did when I was on the pill. However in the past few months I felt like my body took a turn for the worse being on the Ring. I now get these random spasms of severe headaches (where nothing can get rid of them_ not even sleep) and my nausea comes and goes all the time. Just recently my fatigue has gotten so bad that I slept for nearly 18 hours on my day off the other day and I friggan woke up still tired as ever and with this horrible headache! Being on the Ring has now become a huge problem in my life all of a sudden causing me to have to call out of work frequently and even having huge panic and depression attacks towards my fiance over NOTHING!

510, 1, pregnancy prevention,breast tenderness_ discharge_ UTI_ yeast infection_ mood swings_ partner could feel it during sex,Immediately after inserting the ring_ my breasts were EXTREMELY tender_ when I'd take my bra off and they weren't supported I'd be near tears. This went away only when it was out during the 'off' week. I became incredibly susceptible to very painful and severe UTIs even though I was taking the same measures to protect against them as I always had. My mood swings were very pronounced. The most important thing I would like to tell other women- I would not recommend this to ANYONE who hasn't tried enough different birth controls to know what works for their body. Prior to using the Nuvaring_ I had only used Depo for a few years with great results. When I started the ring I asked my doctor for a birth control with a lower dose of hormones. A few months into it (using correctly and often using condoms as well courtesy of not wanting to share the UTIs with my boyfriend) I ended up in the hospital with a ruptured tubal pregnancy (no idea I was pregnant) which resulted in a blood clot in my ovary. I had to go into emergency surgery to have that fallopian tube and ovary removed_ although luckily the other side is fine. My surgeon told me that he has very little faith in the Nuvaring_ doesn't recommend it to his patients unless they ask for it_ and suspects that my metabolism was probably too high and burned through the low dose of hormones too quickly. I've been struggling for some time and kicking myself that I ever started using this in the first place.,F,22,3  months,12/24/2009Email,Nuvaring

I absolutely love the NUVARING. It has made it so much easier to take birth control properly and effectively. I have a problem with severe cramps and being on birth control helps lessen them as well as allow me to begin taking pain killers earlier to avoid the pain. The only complaint is the increase in discharge about a week before my period that is accompanied by a slightly sour smell.,F,20,3  years,12/4/2009,Nuvaring

It finally dawned on me about a week ago that the ring may be causing my severe mood changes. I'm glad I'm not the only one that seems to be having these problems.

Otherwise I am very happy with this product as I have had issues in the past with taking a daily pill.

My moods were a constant roller coaster_ and I could barely stay awake. I had horrible headaches and couldn't focus on anything but how bad I felt. I had no clue it would be associated to the ring. After reading this sight I took it out and will NEVER use it again. Not that I have had sex anyways_ because the thought of it makes me sick.

I would snap out at people for no reason. Im normally a very happy and easy going person and i did not recoginize myself when i was on the ring. My libido also increased ALOT! But since i was being so crabby_ of course my boyfriend didnt want to have sex! But with the cramping_ I would only think having sex would be painful.

542, 5, BC,loss of breast milk; vaginal discharge; spotting during the first month of using the ring;,"I started NuvaRing very recently_ about six weeks following the birth of my second (and very-much-planned) child.  I chose NuvaRing over the pills I'd used previously because my doctor said it was a safe BC method for nursing mothers and my baby's pediatrician agreed.  Before starting on NuvaRing I produced about 80% of my baby's food_ supplementing only one feeding of formula/day.  My doctor said that breast milk production would not be affected in most women who use NuvaRing_ and I shouldn't be concerned.  I noticed a slight drop (maybe 10-15%) in milk production during the first month of ring use.  Unfortunately_ I was apparently one of the so-called ""rare"" cases_ and my milk production decreased by about 80% within a week of inserting the second ring.  I was devastated because it is difficult to increase milk supply once it goes down that much.  So be warned... if you are a nursing mom starting NuvaRing_ the risk of losing your breast milk even with this low dose hormone ring is REAL.  I wish I had realized what the problem was in time to have corrected it_ because it was frustrating to switch to formula when I had been doing so well with nursing.   All that said_ I hope to continue on NuvaRing because I enjoy the convenience of it.  But should I decide to have another baby_ I would rather skip sex altogether than destroy my milk supply with this ring!

(I'm trying the continuous method_ to only have a period every 3 mos.) I have had a headache on and off for almost 3 days. This evening I finally have relief_ I've taken proper dosage of Excedrin Migraine for about 2 days. (I did get 1-2 headaches/ mo. before starting NuvaRing_ so I'm not sure if it's a side effect of NuvaRing).

Also the ring would come out during sex at least once a month_ and at other times it would stay in but cause irritation for both me and my boyfriend. I didn't always notice that it had come out and more than once it was out for an entire day_ which was quite scary at times. I notice being very moody (mostly unreasonably ANGRY) about a week before my period_ and my breasts are very sore about a week before the ring comes out but this usually diminishes by the time it comes out.,I was on the pill (Tri-phasil) and I do remember some moodiness and breast tenderness so I don't believe that's unique to nuvaring_ but I don't remember any dryness or lack of sex drive. Also_ my insurance doesn't cover it and the price went from $42 to $66/month in 2 years and has been going up almost every single month for the last 6-9 months. I have one more month left and I will be switching back to a pill now.

I also went from having 5 day_ horrible cramps_ periods to having MAYBE 1 day periods with no cramping. I would think the testosterone would stop me from bleeding_ but I also had no sex drive AT ALL_ so I don't know what this was. It was honestly a trade off_ to go off of it_ because I am terrible at taking the pill at the same time every day. But the lack of sex drive just wasn't worth it.

I now have to go to Target_ embarrassingly purchase some KY_ remove the label_ and HIDE it in the house and secretly use it during sex b/c of the dryness this Nuvaring is causing. I have switched to the pill_ but am still trying to battle the weight_ dryness_ and lack of libido it gave to me!,F,34,1  years,4/26/2009,Nuvaring

Not exactly the type of gf I want to be. I was on the ring for 8 months about 5 months in I started to notice signs of depression _ I questioned the things I've always been so sure about in life_ I felt unattractive_ I had no sex drive_ sex didnt even feel good_ I had migrains daily_ I often got extremely irritable_ and the list goes on.  I took the ring out for a trial period to see if that was the cause of my symptoms. Sure enough_ with in days I was feeling like myself again and I actually felt horny for the first time in months. I was happy to know that I was not going crazy. Just to be sure_ I got back on it after 2 months of just using comdoms. Here I am 2 weeks in and I am moody_ with no desire for sex PLUS my migrains came back. I've had 3 this week. Once this cycle is done_ I am done with the ring. Honestly_ I don't think i would have much better luck on the pill. Plus_ there are so many bad health risks that many Drs fail to mention. Birth control is convenient for some but just not a healthy choice. Sucks for him_ but I dont want to be on any form of hormonal birth control. Condoms here we come!

563, 1, Birth Control,Fatigue_ cramping_ moodswings_ breast tenderness_ weight gain,I Just started NR a week ago on the 1st day of my period_ I have already gained 5lbs_ have constant cramping (not severe but noticeable) my boobs hurt_ and I have constant lethargy. Went for a walk today with my BF and could hardly stand it. Just wanted to lie down...We then got in a huge fight because I was freaking out about every little thing. I was crying and screaming at him_ and we almost broke up. I am normally not like this. So I just took it out. Im sure my OBGYN would say to give my body a chance to adjust but I can't take another day! So Im probably messing up my Menstrual cycle but I'll take that chance especially after reading all the experiences of you other poor ladies.I had tried to get an IUD after many of my friends recommended it. I chose Mirena although I am usually anti hormone_ but my doctor says that the hormones in Mirena do not go into your blood stream but stay locally in your uterus. My friends who have Mirena love it_ less periods_ no cramping_ no side effects. My one friend who had the non hormone one had terrible heavy bleeding_ severe cramps etc. So after TWO TERRIBLY painful attempts at inserting the Mirena_ ( I had to come back a second time on Valium_ Vicodin_ and a pill to dilate my cervix) I was told I am not a candidate because my uterus is TOO SMALL! The U.S only has two IUD's. Europe_ Canada_ even Mexico has smaller sizes available.Sooooooo_ long story short_ I either have to fly to one of these countries_,F,32, ,4/12/2009,Nuvaring

August I got pregnant_ Couldn't go thru with the pregnancy and shortly after started the nuvaring. Since being on it_ I've put on 10lbs that I can't keep off no matter what I tried. Have had absolutely NO sex drive the past 7 months but thought it was due to being afraid of getting pregnant again and because I was unhappy with my over weight self.  I was getting headaches atleast 2-3 times a week and the past two months I've been extremely moody and irritated over everything. So went to the dr and got onto a pill and I'm really hoping this all changes.,,F,20,8  months,4/8/2009,Nuvaring
565, 5, Heavy_ painful periods,Shorter_ less painful_ predictable periods_ increase breast size,I can't believe all the bad side effects people are claiming from Nuvaring. I originally chose it because I knew I wouldn't remember to take a pill every day_ the convenience is amazing. I was on it for over a year_ and it made my periods much shorter (three days!) and reduced my cramping (I usually have incapacitating cramps). It would make my breasts bigger_ but with no weight gain_ thank god.  I've been off it for almost a year now as well (stupidly) and I again have  unpredictable_ painful periods. I've been back to the OBGYN to refill my prescription so I'll be watching for symptoms_ but I'm hoping it was as awesome as I remembered. I do remember a bit of a lower libido but I can't discern if it was the ring or just my boyfriend at the time.,F,20,1  years,4/5/2009,Nuvaring

This time I bled every day from the time I started till after my period ended in the next cycle.  Also_ 2 weeks after I inserted_ I started getting deep_ cystic acne all over my face_ and have had that every day since.  I used to have really nice skin.  So was it effective as a birth control? Yes_ because I bled everyday_ look terrible_ and have less of a sex drive.  I suspect that my body is acting this way because the last time I was on it_ it fell out so I just stopped taking it because I wasn't having sex at that time.,F,31,3  months,4/4/2009,Nuvaring

I had not been on BC for years and shortly before my wedding_ we decided that Nuvaring was the best sounding option for us.

I have been blaming it on my lifestyle change (marriage) and loss of freedom_ but I'm pretty sure this sweet little ring is turning me into a Crying Ball of Fury who hates sex!

Easy to use (in theory)_ low side effects_ nice short-light periods for once. And then everything changed. A couple of months into I noticed a little weight gain_ a lot of cramping even though my periods were very short: 2-3 days_ not to mention the horrible look (brow-black) and smell. Plus_ I couldn't put it in or take it out by myself. My husband was nice enough to do it_ but each time I felt like the ring was tearing me up! I stayed on it until I couldn't have sex_ that was the absolute last straw. I was tested several times for infections_ and nothing was found my GYN could visually see how irritated I was yet couldn't and still can't do anything for me. It has been almost two years since I quit the Nuvaring and I still have trouble with lack of vaginal moisture but the worst thing of all is my sex life.

By Sunday the following week I was yelling at my husband_ ready to pack my bags and leave_ felt fat_ ugly_ worthless... anything and everything negative. I am always a very happy-go-lucky person_ and did not see this coming at all. I took the NuvaRing out and felt better within 2 hours. I would not recommend it to anyone.

No breakthrough bleeding (which has been a problem with every other pill I've tried since having my first child) and even after being overly moody a few days after putting it in the first time_ I seemed to even out by the second week. Got my period as planned_ 2 days after taking it out and all seemed fine. I did feel like I'd gained weight in my midsection (which is SO unlike how I gain weight_ it's usually in my thights/butt) but thought maybe it was from holiday goodies. This second cycle_ just as before_ about 3 days after inserting the new ring_ I was totally moody and it's only gotten worse with each passing day. I've been crying over everything_ at the drop of a hat! I do not feel like myself AT ALL. I'm pissy at every one for no reason at all.

I assumed everything was just side effects of all that_ but after reading other people's ratings i'm wondering if it was the nuvaring after all. So_ Migranes_ slight depression_ and moodiness. My husband just recently brought all of this to my attention. I go in for my anual check up in 2 months and i will be switching.

No worry having and taking the pills.  I did some spotting the second week_ too. But the sex drive thing is nearly overwhelming.  (all you who lost your sex drive:  the other way isn't better.)

First_ I have a complete lack of sex drive_ vaginal dryness_ and difficulty achieving orgasm.

I noticed some minor side affects in the first few months of using it_ like within an hour of inserting a new one each month_ I would get headaches off and on for a day or two_ then symptoms kept getting worse.  I did not realize that they were all related to the pill_ until I looked online and realized that my new ailments seemed to be associated with the ring.  I took it out this morning and already feel better.  My headache of 6 days (since it put in the last ring) finally was dulled and is almost gone.

It seems no matter how much I exercise or how little I eat I cannot get the weight off. Noticed depression in the last few months... but I think it's b/c I'm getting so FAT that none of my clothes fit. Other than that_ I love it. I love not worrying about BC and don't have any other problems. My periods are maybe 3 days and lighter than ever. I'm a nurse and did a lot of research on this before I put it in my body.

After the third month though_ my moods became extreme- one minute I'd be laughing and happy_ the next - I'd be crying or feeling very angry and frustrated. I've also been having panic attacks more frequently. I was initially scared to even try Nuva Ring from all the negatives I've heard_ but since alot of the oral BCP's that I've tried made me very sick (vomiting_ diarrhea) _I really had no other option. Some pros though- I can't even tell it's there_ my periods are very regular and light_ and other than the mood swings_ it's a good fit. I have even lost 7 pounds since starting it (but that's probably due to my recently diagnosed allergy to soy and being more cautious in what I eat) I'll probably get off Nuvaring if my moods continue to fluctuate so dramatically and just be on nothing.

We have had to deal with a lot and it started to push us apart. I would get my period for a minimum of two straight weeks (that doesnt include the days where I would be spotting). I was moody and irritable almost the entire month. I had zero sex drive and I would have to force myself to be with him. We are young and this was not right. I was going to my GYNO every 4 months and I think I had been on every pill imaginable. I was religious about when I would take it. There was no real reason for me to be going through what I was experiencing. Not to mention how much time and money went into trying to find an answer. Finally my last chance was to try the ring. I do admit that I could have tried it before now but I was scared. A colleague of mine had experienced negative side effects and I was only going to use it as a last resort.

I used it for about a year and a half and I just could not take the side effects anymore. It left me with headaches probably 5 days of the week_ extreme depression and my mood swings were crazy.  I loved how I did not have to worry about taking a pill everyday however I do not intend to restart taking the ring again.,F,19,1.5  years,10/23/2008,Nuvaring
601, 5, Birth control,Occasional spotting_ slightly decreased sex drive (but to a lesser extent than other birth control pills)_ sometimes the ring slips out during sex.,I love love love NuvaRing.  I've used 2 other kinds of birth control before(OrthoTriCyclin and Desogen)_ the former made me a crazy emotional mess and the latter made me a clingy gf with constant breakouts.  I had none of these problems with NuvaRing_ other than preventing me from getting pregnant_ it really doesn't seem to affect my emotional/physical well-being at all.  I'd highly recommend it.,F,25,1  years,10/17/2008,Nuvaring
602, 1, Easy Birth Control,vaginal dryness_ lowered sex drive_ more prone to yeast infections and UTIs_ extreme mood swings to the point where my husband started calling me 'just plain mean'_ pregnancy scares the first month used as well as when the ring is finally taken out_ extremely painful menstration,I definately would not recommend the NuvaRing to anyone that is wanting to be sexually active. When I first started on this medication I was a thousand miles away from my husband_ so the effects weren't as obvious at first. Then I began to get irritated more and more with the stupidest things. Once we were finally able to see each other for two short weeks_ vaginal dryness and decrease in sex drive caused us to have intimate relations a measly 5 times after not seeing each other for 13 months. Now the ring is taken out due to a mix up with my insurance(thank the gods for small favors) and I noticed the difference. Yes_ there was a pregnancy scare after the ring came out_ but apparently that's normal coming off the NuvaRing. This product may be convenient_ but should convenience outweigh your own pleasure and happiness? I'm just going to get an IUD (the Copper T is non hormonal :) ),F,21,1  years,10/16/2008Email,Nuvaring
603, 3, Birth Control,Man oh man. MAJOR dripping discharge. I have to wear a pantyliner every single day. It literally runs down my leg! I honestly_ along with my doctor_ believe I may be allergic to it. Irritation_ more prone to both yeast & bv. Also_ loss of sex drive. It weakens my level of sensitivity and my orgasms considerably. No weight gain from it_ and no acne or hair shedding. Only mildly increased moodiness_ but not enough to complain about too much. Also_ has caused post-nasal drip. My gyno says it isn't that uncommon_ actually,I'm taking this thing out! I'm so irritated! I have taken off and on for 4 years_ and I simply am at my wits end. I have tried others in between_ and always go back to nuvaring cuz it causes zero weight gain/bloating. Not anymore!!!,F,29,4  years,10/14/2008,Nuvaring
604, 1, birth control,very emotional_ depressed_ late period_ crazy mood swings_,This form of birth control was very handy since I only had to worry about inserting a ring once a month_ but the side affects were too much for me to continue the use of nuva ring. After one week I started to have excessive discarge. During the second a third weeks_ I was extremely moody_ and was always worrying over stupid things.  I would cry for absolutely no reason (the longest crying period was four days in a row) and was extremely DEPRESSED. Keep in mind Im in a good mood 99% of the time. my libedo was gradually decreasing over the four weeks of being on it. With the nuva ring_ you are given a timer_ and after three weeks it will beep to remind you to take the ring out. That following week is when you get your period. a few days ago the ring fell out_ and I have not put it back in. I also did not like the fact that i had to carry around a timer. My doctor wrote me a prescription for Mircette_ which is a pill. I would not recommend the nuva ring_ but the side effects are different,F,18,1  months,10/14/2008,Nuvaring
605, 5, birth control-regulate periods,Got occasional yeast infection but 1 dose of Gynazole knocked it down fast. And the occasional infections could have been due to perimenopause. No other side effects,It had no adverse impact on my sex drive nor did I experience any of the other symptoms some wrote about. I was in the process of losing weight when I went on it and the weight loss continued without a problem. My partner could feel it once in a while but it didn't affect the sex. The convenience was terrific. I went off a few months ago to check hormone levels to see where I was in menopause. I had no symptoms when I stopped using it. No need to go back on it now.

But as I recall_ being off birth control and dealing with ""natural"" hormones is no walk in the park either (and neither is the constant paranoia about pregnancy).

615, 4, birth control to lessen migraines,very brief and slight discomfort at first. Then_ it went away and I never knew I even had the ring.,My migraines improved in frequency with nuvaring. The headaches were less intense. No nausea. Weight gain was very minimal_ perhaps 2 pounds at most. I did become very sensitive to the sun_ but_ that is a common side effect with all contraceptives. I was hoping that it would lessen my melasma (which was caused by a higher strength birth control pill) but_ it did not. I was grateful that it helped my migraines because I had tried many things over a 4-year period to stop my migraines including seizure meds and blood pressure pills. This ring is similar to a rubber band and  once inserted_ you cannot feel it. It is the lowest dose combination birth control pill that is available. It contains 15 mg estrogen and  .12 mg progestin type.,F,48,2  months,6/18/2008,Nuvaring

617, 1, Birth Control,,Reading these reviews_ it's very disappointing. I recently had a bad pregnancy scare_ which has left me with no confidence in condoms alone. I wanted to get on some form of birth control_ along with still using condoms. But I have a type of kidney disease_ so that rules out almost all forms of birth control. I felt relieved when I was first reading about the Nuvaring_ seeing how great it was_ and seeing how I could use it even with my kidney problem. After reading these reviews_ I'm so disappointed.I could see if one or two people had problems_ but the majority of everybody here...

I got on here to see what other people had to say about the nuva-ring when my dr switched my BC.  I really guess all of these horror stories really depend on the person_ their age_ and the kind(if any at all)of BC they were on.

It went okay for about two weeks_ than started getting bouts of anxiety.  Did not gain any weight with the ring because the anxiety was bad enough that it stopped me from eating.  Also would get incredibly shakey_ and would have weird headaches that would go down the left or right side of my head and down my neck.  Finally had enough as it was completely messing with my mental state.  Took the ring out and have another appt.

I have noticed a big decrease in sex drive_ but part of that I feel is related to just being a girl. Sometimes I want it_ sometimes I don't.  After the first few months_ I also noticed that when it's time to put a new one in_ it sometimes slips down. I have a tilted uterus_ which is part of the problem.

They were so sore I had to wear a sports bra to even sleep. The vaginal discharge is very heavy. I constantly felt wet and disgusting no matter what I did.

Get one of those cycle calculators free online and u can tell when you are ovulating by actually keeping track of your core body temp and the viscosity of your vaginal secretions. when you ovulate your temp goes up for those days and your ""wetness"" can be ""stretched"" between two fingers.

Well_ I had assumed that because i was working_ going to school full-time and taking on night classes to get my LNA_ that I was just overtired and needed a break. Well I finished all of that at the beginning of January and there had been no change in my mood_ and  I was actually feeling better when I got my periods (which as we know is unusual).

647, 5, birth control/decreased periods,Some decrease in sex drive_ slight weight gain,I think this method is great_ I tend to have less breakthrough bleeding than with pills and am way less moody than I have been on other methods (or than I am unmedicated).  I skip my periods using the ring_ and have had very little spotting_ less than on pills.  I did gain about 10 pounds when I started using it_ but this may have had more to do with me excersing less frequently than with the ring,F,24,19  months,1/3/2008,Nuvaring

I have had an irritated_ red_ and painful vulva and vagina for the past six months when I was on the NuvaRing.  Sex is nearly impossible because it is so painful for me. My gyno thought that I was having recurrent yeast infections_ but after a 6 month course of weekly diflucan with no improvement in the level of discomfort_ I have ruled out this possibility.   The most troubling thing that has been happening to me are these episodes of heart palpitations.  My heart feels like it is clenching at about 130 beats per minute- and these episodes have lasted up to seven hours and brought me to the emergency room twice.  They are the most terrifying experience of my life.  The rhythm of the beats during this time is not irregular and the cardiologist does not know its cause.  I hope after I discontinue the NuvaRing I will find some relief... I am furious that my (all of) my doctors did not suggest some correlat,F,21,10  months,12/20/2007,Nuvaring
650, 3, pregnancy prevention,I went off of Ortho Tri Cylcen (was on for 8 years) to find something that had less hormones and therefore less moodiness.  The Nuvaring was perfect for the first 2-3 months but then the vaginal dryness started.  It is so bad and even removing the ring does not help.  Lubrication helps but sometimes not enough.  I will have to stop this medication due to that one factor.,,F,29,4  months,12/17/2007,Nuvaring
651, 5, Birth Control,Brownish discharge during the first month_ but after that_ nothing,I love nuva ring. I switched from yasmine to it_ and during the first month I got a brownish discharge_ and thought that I had started my period early_ but it was too dark. I called the pharmacist and he informed me that it was completely normal when switching birth controls and he was right. I have had no problems with it since then! Its very convenient!!,F,20,4  months,12/16/2007,Nuvaring

My acne is better_ but I can't stand these constant female infections and my husband is ill-pleased as well.  I am also tired all the time_ more so than any other combined pill I have ever taken.  I also have problems with insomnia_ probably contributing to the already-going fatigue.  Oh_ yeah_ and I have had diarrhea all the time too.,F,31,3  months,12/16/2007,Nuvaring
653, 4, Birth Control,I recently gained 10 pounds otherwise no problems with it.,I love this birth control. I used to have very painful periods which included nausia_ severe cramping_ diarrhea_ and vomiting. Since I've been on the Nuvaring I have NOT had any discomforts. As far as sex drive is concerned.... I occassionally have dryness but it's easily fixed otherwise my sex drive is fantastic.,F,34,3  months,12/12/2007,Nuvaring
654, 3, birth control,decreased sex drive_ weight gain_ increased discharge,The nuva ring has worked very well as a method of birth control_ but the decrease in sex drive was dramatic and I'm still struggling with that. The discharge doesn't bother me usually. It's minimal. And the weight gain is unfortunate_ but I haven't gained so much that I'd want to change birth control methods again. This has worked best among all the pills I've tried_ but it does take extra reminders to remember to take it out and put it in.,F,31,8  months,12/5/2007,Nuvaring

The only reason I came here is bc I came off for a month due to insurance and my breast got HUGE! I also feel bloated.  The side effects I posted_ I have just now made the connection after reading these notes.  It was great for the first year. No side effects at all. I have issues with getting wet_ smelly yeast infections_ but my . comes like clockwork and no cramping.  Yesterday I couldn't wait to get back on bc I thought it would bring my breast back to size and take away the tenderness; now I have a new insight.

I should have read about it more carefully before putting it in my body. After four years of a lot of emotional healing work that has increased my self-confidence_ ability to be in a relationship_ and general wellbeing_ I felt like it all went down the toilet in a week. When I started feeling nauseated_ I finally did my homework and realized that the emotional and physical symptoms I'd noticed in the past 4 days were probably related_ went into the bathroom_ and threw the thing in the trash.,F,27,8  days,11/26/2007,Nuvaring

No real bad side effects. Would leave it in and change it every 4 weeks and have a light_ short_ period every 3 months.  Best advice_ take it out during sex (be sure to put it back in within 2-3 hours).  Hated the lower sex drive and feeling fat.  Stopped using it recently because my doctor stopped giving me samples and my insurance charges $35 a month.  Back to using a Vaginal Contraceptive Film made of spermacide.,F,43,2  years,11/23/2007,Nuvaring

I liked everything about the ring_ didn't have any mood swings_ h/a_ vaginal dryness_ breasts were a size bigger_ sex drive was fine. I'm disappointed because it was so perfect for me except for one thing...after 3 months_ one night when I was just watching TV I experienced a powerful flutter in my heart followed by an ""impending doom"" feeling and gradually over a span of a few minutes my heart rate increased into the hundreds and finally into the 150's (I'm a nurse). It was pounding out of my chest. I couldn't breath_ talk or move. I thought I was going to die. Worst feeling I've ever had_ I was saying prayers and making my final ammends. Needless to say the ambulance was called and I was taking to the ER. I was also having multiple PVC's.

When i first got off of it _ it was because i thought it was causing insomnia but then i couldn't really tell becasue i had finals at the same time so my doctor said to get off and try it again later. Well i was questioning my actions whis pasts months.why was i so down? why was i getting so many migraines (i hardly ever did) why cant i sleep.

661, 1, Ovarian cysts,Gradually intensifying anxiety and depression_ burning pain during sex_ weight gain and breast soreness_ all of which went away after removing the Ring,I used the NuvaRing for a year in 2003_ and it was a dream! It was convenient_ and seemed to smooth out my moods. After a year off_ I went back on in 2005. At first all seemed well_ but over the next two years things went downhill almost too quietly to notice. By 2007_ I'd gained weight (despite running 3 miles daily)_ burning pain made sex too painful to endure_ and I was paralyzed by panic and depression. I was actively planning suicide -- and I'm NOT that kind of person! On a hunch_ I quit the ring... and the anxiety waned within 48 hours and disappeared after a few months. The depression is lifting_ albeit more slowly. I dropped 15 pounds without even trying. The excruciating sex faded back to normal with six weeks. Did they change the formula of this thing? It really was lovely the first time I used it_ and only recently have I heard of others having the same problems I did. It may still work great for some_ but pay CLOSE attention to how you feel_ as the awful side effects really,F,43,2.5  years,11/11/2007,Nuvaring
662, 1, birth control,Extreme moodiness and excessive hunger; weight gain,I have been on numerous birth control pills over the years and my doctor wanted me to try Nuvaring  because I was having increasing breakthrough bleeding on every pill I tried.  But nuvaring was by far the worst birth control experience.  I am extremely fit and watch my diet_ but Nuvaring caused me to have extreme hunger_ especially at night.  I gained about 5-7 lbs. in the few weeks I was on it.  I also had no energy and depression like I never experienced before.  I ended up getting off Nuvaring and giving my body a break from hormonal birth control for a few months.  Now I am on Yasmin and so far it's wonderful.,F,35,3  weeks,11/9/2007,Nuvaring
663, 2, Birth control,nausea_ headaches_ depression_ lethargy_ mood swings_ cramps_ paranoia,I am envious of the ladies that can use this without the side effects - I was really hoping for the best!  I inserted the ring on Tuesday night.  By Wednesday morning the nausea started and it's been 24/7 for the past week and a half.  By Wednesday night my entire personality took a nose-dive.  I'm usually a very happy and upbeat person.  I've been depressed_ paranoid and just generally miserable.  I haven't been to the gym since insertion because I have ZERO motivation and I'm tired all the time.  I'm taking it out tonight because the side effects are too severe for me to wait to see if they subside.  I usually have a massive libido and it's still there but I feel so horrible otherwise that I can't spare the energy to attempt 'sexy'.,F,35,9  days,11/8/2007,Nuvaring

The headaches are UNBEARABLE_ the added 10 lbs. in 4 months isn't much appreciated_ and my boyfriend has actually mentioned bumping into it during sex.  I'm not a huge fan of meds in the first place_ so I may be a little hypersensitive.  I have to say_ however_ that birth control is particularly eery because of the intricate biological systems & processes it meddles with.  I'm switching to condoms_ hope_ & meditation.  NO BABIES!!

Because one of the side effects of Graves' is high blood pressure_ finding a birth control method was not easy since high blood pressure is one of the main side effects of almost every bc.  My GYN introduced me to NR and at first_ I was a little apprehensive about the time frame of the ring being inside of me.  However_ a year later and I am still in love with this product.  Even with the Graves' history I have_ I have experienced ZERO side effects.  I guess_ judging from this board_ that I'm one of the lucky ones.,F,31,1  years,11/1/2007,Nuvaring

I bleed almost every day for 3 years. I had given up hope that I would ever have a regular period again. Now going on 2 years with Nuvaring I have not bleed through once and have regular periods. The one annoyance I have is how dry it makes me. I've had to try to explain this to my husband as he thinks it's him and not the meds. Nothing a good lube can't fix though.,F,27,2  years,11/1/2007Email,Nuvaring

My friends suggested the Nuva Ring and I loved it. Last year I got sick and started bleeding and never stopped. Doctors put me on a different birth control but I eventually went back to the NuvaRing because I can't remember to take a pill. Anyway_ in these 5 years I had alot of weird headaches and anxiety. I kept a journal of most of it because I was trying to figure out what was wrong. I have gone through many things trying to figure it out. Now I am extremely healthy and careful with myself and I still feel sick. Looking back on it all_ my problems started when I started the ring (and birth control in general). Because I am getting married and we use condoms every time anyway_ I have decided to stop taking birth control in general. Some of my other friends have stopped to and they feel much better. Most have lost 5-10 lbs. Most have way less anxiety and less crazy feelings. So I am jumping on the bandwagon. I honestly believe its rediculous,F,27,5  years,11/1/2007,Nuvaring
668, 4, Birth Control,Increased discharge but normal color and no odor.Decreased sex drive.,I have more frequent headaches but never really associated it with NR until reading others comments.  Maybe its caused by the hormones_ maybe its not.  There are NUMEROUS reasons as to why people get headaches; like not drinking anough water.My sex drive has decreased but again_ wasnt sure it was because of the NR.  There are other things in life that could cause the decrease.NO weight gain_ NO enlarged breasts_ NO vaginal infections what-so-ever_ NO increased anxiety (I have panic disorder).

I feel bloated_ fat_ ugly and seem to suffer some depression. I've also experienced discolored discharge which appears to happen randomly.

I am hoping I can find something to balance my hormones without all these side affects. I was missing periods and having a lot of anxiety and depression. The anxiety is gone but the depression is still there not as bad as it was. Probably not caused by this_ just life in general. I was just reading about Mirena_ I don't want that either.

I'm not sure when my symptom began_ but little by the bloating began to bother me and was almost painful. I told my obgyn because it was not normal_ but they said it was due to the alkaline changes inside of my vagina from the ring.  They suggested I remove and replace my ring immidiately so my body doesn't have the hormone ""ups and downs"".  That is when my nightmare began.  I tried this and although I was experiencing more and more symptoms I almost made myself believe it was ""just me"".  After finding other sites like this one I realized I was not crazy and I immediately took the ring out.  My body is going though the ""detox"" phase and I feel better_ but not completely.

I first got on birth control because I was getting married and needed an easy birth control method because I just cannot take pills everyday_ I forget! So my doc gave me NuvaRing_ and at first_ it was great. Easy to use_ couldn't feel it_ hubby liked its convenience. But then_ I started to change. Before we got married_ we_ unfortunately_ had premarital sex. It was such a struggle for us because my sex drive was SO HIGH. Just a couple months after using NR_ my sex drive plummetted. I honestly believed it was God giving me my consequences for having premarital sex. Right now_ I could do without sex for the rest of my life. We only have sex 2 or 3 times a month (and we're YOUNG newlyweds!) and when we do it is painfully uncomfortable_ I don't lubricate at all_ and even if I want to have sex really badly_ I just can't get turned on.

Compared to those_ NR has been great.  It did take several months_ but my body adjusted well and only once did I get spotting in between periods.  My libido wasn't quite normal_ but much better than on any of the pills.I sort of wonder_ though_ if part of the reason the rating here is relatively low is that it's mostly the people who have negative experiences who take the time to write reviews.,F,23,1.5  years,10/2/2007,Nuvaring

My doctor recommended nuvaring after i explained my moodiness_ lack of sex drive_ anxiety and irregularity.

I had diarrhea and stomach pains and I went back to the nurse who said there was no way it was related. I was SURE it was but they said no. Then another doctor told me I was lactose intolerant_ so I would take lactaid pills before eating dairy food but it didnt help at all. Caffinated things made me sick as well. As SOON as I started nuvaring_ all the symptoms dissapeared. I still don't know why I had that reaction but I'm glad its gone and certainly have no interest in asking my doctor to find out as she was so sure all the times I came back that I was wrong.,F,17,1  months,9/10/2007,Nuvaring

691, 2, Birth control,Yeast infections to no end. I think I had infections the entire time I used the ring. Really bad ones_ too: I took 4 diflucans during one cycle and they didn't cure the infection_ probably because (as I later found out) I also had a bacterial infection. I finally took some really strong stuff and both infections went away. But what a hassle.,It's too bad that this didn't work out because I was really excited about a reliable birth control option that is supposed to have fewer behavioral side effects than the pill. But I don't think it was worth the trouble. For one thing_ sex is not at ALL exciting when you're constantly dealing with problems down there.,F,26,3  months,8/26/2007,Nuvaring

I lost 10% of my body weight and my breasts grew a cup size_ so no complaints there. However_ my mood swings/depression have intensified and at times I feel lethargic and tired. I've started tracking these symptoms and know when to expect them and better deal with them now. I'll probably stick with it for another few months and if this does not let up_ will go off bc completely. I refuse to go on anti depressants to counteract my bc-just doesn't make sense to me_ I would rather go off and use other contraceptive methods.

Neither my husband or I can feel it during sex_ it hasn't fallen out_ and I can't feel it at all in general. I have had one headache so far (vs 4 or 5 normally)_ but not one headache until after over 2 weeks of use.  I've experienced none of the awful things I've read in other postings - my comments to many of those folks is that all hormone treatments can affect each person differently.  Just be aware of the possible side effects (as is true with any medication) and talk with your doctor immediately if you have any.

I've been on it for one month_ started bleeding heavy again and my dr. told me to take it continuously for a year_ no periods! then see what that does with the monorragia.

It feels as if you used a tampon and didn't inset it far up enough. THey tell you to just push it up but it keeps slowly lowering no matter how far back you push it. It is very anoying.

But after 3 years of starving my fiance out of sex (& myself b/c NEVER wanted it at all)_ and gaining 20 lbs (and I exercise ALOT & eat right)_ along with the other problems - it's just not worth it to me. I'd rather go back to condoms.  If these are the noticable effects_ God knows what other bad things BC could be doing. I guess he's trying to tell me ""Don't mess with Mother Nature"".",F,30,3  days,5/4/2007Email,Nuvaring
740, 2, BC/regulate my period,Severe Panic Attacks_ weight gain_ bloating,At first i loved not having to think about BC everyday and for the most part it was working great_ then 2 months into using it i was getting major panic attacks. To the point that my doctor had to prescribe Xanax! I thought i was going insane. It wasn't until i read the comments on this website did i put two and two together and realized it was the ring. I'm going back to pills and hope that OrthoTri Lo works for me. I also noticed that my moods would change at the drop of a hat. I was angry and moody and sometimes down right evil.. As for the weight gain_ the week before i was to take the ring out i would notice that appetite would increase severely to the point i wouldn't get full.. Good Luck to all and i hope this helps.,F,27,5  months,5/3/2007,Nuvaring

My period was short and at thesame time each month which was nice_ but these side effects are NOT worth it for me.,I sincerely thought I was going crazy_ it wasn't until a friend of mine started using it and commented on her increased moodiness that I realized my devasting mood swings started about a month or so after I started using the ring.  I have gained 20 lbs since I started using it - though I also quit smking within that time_ so that has contributed as well.  I never want to have sex.  As I feel right now_ I could never have sex again and be ok with that.  My poor husband.  I took out as normal last Monday and did not insert a new one today.

The first week I only experienced headaches (which was enough to make me want to rip my hair out)_ then I noticed not being able to eat and having no energy to do anything. I did not want to be around people and I was very moody and irritable. I felt tired and all I wanted to do was sleep but couldn't. I had a yeast infection practically the entire time I was on it and I always felt like I was full after eating very little. I have removed it and I feel normal again.

755, 4, birth control,cervical mucus/vaginal discharge increased in thickness and slightly increased in volume; periods light and short with little to no cramping,First tried Nuvaring about 18 months ago_ stopped after a couple of months because I kept feeling it_ like it was pushing its way out.  Later realized placement might have been an issue_ so I tried again.  I've been told that my cervix tends to point more down/back than most_ so it turns out that proper placement is difficult for me (doesn't affect effectiveness_ but it can affect comfort).  Previously_ when I put the ring in_ it ended up sliding into the area in front of the cervix_ so it wouldn't go very far in_ causing me to feel it often.  Now_ with some more careful finger work (and awkward-looking squats)_ I've been able to get the far edge of the ring to go beyond the cervix (basically making a circle around the cervical opening)_ and I never notice it at all.  If you find you feel the ring_ or it is pushed out easily_ see if you can find a better placement.  With about 6 months use_ I've been happy with the method (as happy as I think I can expect to be on hormones_ at least).,F,31,8  months,4/6/2007,Nuvaring

I tried that and the headaches subsided a little_ but after 2 months_ I then began experiencing extreme anxiety.  I had never had a panic attack before.  Using this_ I had them on a weekly basis.
