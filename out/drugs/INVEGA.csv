0, 5, Schizoaffective disorder,Lactation_ loss of period/very irregular periods_ loss of sex drive_ loss of imagination WEIGHT GAIN (40+ pounds!) but more positively_ back to reality,It is the best anti psychotic I have ever been on and I've been on 4 or 5. No mental side effects like drowsiness or feeling dead like others. Was back to normal which is what the drug is supposed to do.,F,25,3  years75 mg/mo,7/29/2016,Invega
1, 1, Psychosis,It does get better! I used to be tired_ not able to run or do anything. No sexual sex drive_ severe anhedonia. Severe suicidal thoughts every day. Not able to get drunk. Sleeping 18 hours a day. Weight gain. I took injections for about 8 months and I stopped taking it about 8 months ago. I AM COMPLETELY BACK TO NORMAL. Don't lose hope. After about 6-8 months you'll be back to normal_ i swear it has been the worst time of my life going through this waiting period time wondering if I would ever come back to a normal life. edouardapril@gmail.com if you need to talk. I have been through this_ you'll be able to recover.,,M,28,8  months75 1X M,7/6/2016Email,Invega
2, 3, bipolar I mixed treatmentresistant,"Extreme weight gain_ so far up 15 pounds in 2.5 months_ some due to increased appetite & some for unknown reason--what this kind of drug always does.Metabolic? Also daily headache. And it's just ridiculously expensive. I'm probably stopping it even tho I think it has helped me more(harmed me less?) than others like it because I can't handle the weight gain and the cost has devastated my Medicare drug coverage.I'm now in the ""donut hole."" SO frustrating to finally find something that helps or at least keeps you out of the hospital but also packs on the pounds and destroys you financially_ which ends up making you as vulnerable to another episode as you were before you started taking it.",Why can't our poor impoverished  drug co's find a drug w/o such disabling consequences? l'm trying for a Rx assistance program...For the weight gain_ after 25 yrs on psych meds I'm not surprised when I just get fatter. I eat less_ increase activity_ but as it seems inevitable that I will gain weight no matter what I take_ I try not to let it get me too down.(Good luck w/that.) I wish BigPharma thought mental illness was as important as erectile dysfunction.And how about something specifically for bipolar besides lithium_which has been around since leeches?At this point I would try anything.SO tired of off-label_ symptom-driven drugs never meant for bipolar illness but for schizophrenia_ seizures_major depression_ anxiety_OCD_ADD &other random neuro-social problems.On antipsychotics I feel like I'm stumbling around in an already hostile environment_only now also clumsy-fat plus with a paper bag over my head.Invega may work better but its side effects outweigh its benefits.No pun intended.It's hard enough to live w/mental illness in America w/o being fat too.It's not just vanity; there are real health hazards to obesity--just ask the makers of those shiny new diet pills.For me Invega is best of a bunch of lousy choices. If I was rich enough to buy it in the 1st place & could also hire a personal trainer & a chef (i.e._Oprah-Winfrey rich)_Invega could probably be a workable stopgap until we finally invest in treating the bipolar. I don't see that happening anytime so,F,60,3  months3mg ER,7/4/2016,Invega
3, 3, schizoprhenera and bipolar,Loss of sex drive_ trouble with anything working sexual that is your junk kinda quits on ya_weight gain_ and your not sure if you care anymore about anything but you know what you want to feel_ sleepy Ness _ overall weakness feeling mentaly and physicaly_ detachment_ defiantly a sadness you miss what life might use to be like,All in all it works to stop your psychotic symptoms and it stops the voices prevents homicidal and suicidal thoughts stops the paranoia too.

4, 1, Schizophrenia,Side effects are emotional flattening_ spaciness_ and loss of interest in life. Also sleep problems_ dry eye_ drooling_ slowness of response and movement. Low libido_ and little effect from alcohol.,This drug really saps my energy in every way. Takes away the will to live by stripping the emotions dry. Feel one step removed from reality.

5, 1, schitzofrinia,Severely sore and swollen neck and sore neck. I went to the hospital and got a cats can and they said I have muscle spasm which is a side effect of invega.I also had the shakes of my fingers and hands which is also a a side effect since I have sezures. They lowered the dose but it still did not help. I've got a dry mouth and a sore throat as well which are also side effects. And last but not least my bad cholesterol went up and is now too high because of this because it is also a side effect.,I did not get any of these side effects till the very end after I've been on it nearly a year. The  worst one was the muscle spasm that I was getting in theneck which hurt my head very bad.I could barely lift up my head from a lying position or even turn my head from left to right. It hurt so much.it felt like I was carrying around a heavy weight in my head which I wasn't.,F,37,9  months119,5/28/2016,Invega
6, 4, Schizoaffective,Eye twitching,I've been on a bunch of different anti psychotic's over the last couple years. This has been the better option of them all for me to date. Not 100% satisfied because I want more of the symptoms greatly reduced but logically it just isn't going to happen. The eye twitch is annoying when it peaks but it's livable. Understood this would help with mood stabilization and such but have not seen any improvements in those areas even after a dose increase. Did help reduce my negative/suicidal voices so that's my biggest plus because other medications couldn't do it. Anxiety has increased and currently not being treated for it like I want because doctors seem to think this is the cure all problems meds but I think something else is needed to address side issues related to my condition even though I hate taking these pills. Have been pretty forgetful but can't really say if the medication is causing it or just long term effects of my life choices catching up to me. Hard to remember some days if I took my meds or not so have considered the injection but wished it did more before i jumped on board for the injection.,M,26,4  months6 1X D,5/16/2016Email,Invega

15, 1, Mood swings/ OCD,This medication was an absolute nightmare. My son began the medicine after the Doctor swore it was weight neutral. My 14 year old gained almost 40 pounds in one year. Another side effect was that he always exhausted_ and lacked any motivation. I brought the extreme weight gain to our Doctors attention at each visit. We finally had to switch doctors because the doctor insisted on leaving him on this med. This medicine also caused a thyroid condition in my child. The weaning-off process took almost two full months too. During this process_ my child had night sweats and profound exhaustion.. It was an absolute nightmare.,,M,14,1  years9mg,2/25/2016,Invega

I was on 5 psycotropic drugs when my psychiatrist decided to give me Invega.  Much to my dismay.  He did not titrait me off these other drugs before giving me the Invega.  2 days after receiving a long-lasting(30day) injection of Invega I attempted suicide. I don't remember anything prior to my attempt.  I am now picking up the pieces of my life.  I have been in recovery for the last 6 months.  I have suffered multiple broken bones. Legs_ arms_ feet(heels)_ pelvis_ back bones along with an acquired brain injury.From all accounts I should be dead. I now have to use a walker.  My feet and legs are very swollen from all the nerve and vein damage that occurred. I should have not have put on this drug.

I've never heard voices or had hallucinations or suffered from any major delusions apart from the common ones we all do. The folks that were around me did not notice any difference in me after my medication nor did I feel any because I did not suffer from any symtoms of disorders mentioned above. I used to smoke marijuana and that did give me mood swings during withdrawals and I did act like i was off my head at times while stoned coz I was smoking very large amounts of hash but after abstaining for over four months I was fairly back to normal and it was then I saw a psychatrist and my parents told him about my stoned behaviour. The psychatrist diagnosed me schizo and bipolar and put me on invega. All in all the medication did not have any effect on my mental state because it was already normal but I did suffer from all the side effects that this medication entails. I'm lucy that I did not suffer from any major side effect that other people did on this drug but still it was a horrible experience for me. Despite my informing the doc about its indifference to me mentally_ the doc has advised to continue with the medication. I mean do you diagnose a person on how he acts when hes drunk?

131, 3, Bipolar I,weight gain_ drowsiness_ sexual dysfunction,For one year_ I took 6 mg. of Invega per day; after a year_ I reduced my dosage to 3 mg. per day. It helped me think more clearly and reduced symptoms of bipolar depression. I had no manic episodes in the two years I took it.However_ it made me very sleepy_ even at the 3 mg. dose. I also gained quite a bit of weight. My doctor prescribed Nuvigil to counteract the sleepiness_ but then my insurance company wouldn't pay for the Nuvigil anymore_ and so my doctor decided to try discontinuing the Invega. The week I stopped taking Invega_ I lost 6 pounds_ and I continue to lose weight. All of a sudden_ my interest in and response to sex has returned.

134, 4, Schizoaffective,Weight gain_ lactation,Invega worked wonders for me on my psychosis.  I stayed on it for a year and tried (with my dr's guidance) to stop taking it.  When I got off of Invega I lost a considerable amount of weight.  Unfortunatly_ my psychosis came back after a few months and I had to get back on an antipsychotic.  The Invega immediately helped my mind to work properly again_ but the weight quickly came back (10 lbs in less than two weeks).  I know some of that was due to my eating_ but I was HUNGRY all the time.  But at the same time I was exercising several times a week to try to stop the weight gain.  I got fed up and stopped taking the Invega (on my own... not the best) and the hunger went away and I dropped the 10 lbs just as fast as I put it on.  But my psychosis came back with a vengeance and I am still trying to find the best antipsychotic for me (crossing my fingers on Geodon right now...three weeks in_ no weight gain_ no restlessness_ and my mind is working again)_ but I do know that if I have to_ I can go back to Invega to get stabalized_ I would just have to figure out how to deal with the weight issues.,F,35,1  years6 MG 1X D,8/29/2010Email,Invega

136, 2, Bipolar/Mania,Depression with feelings of rage and irritability especially when hungry. Helplessness and feelings of inadequacy at times with more rapid-cycling. Also noticed my son making uncontrollable hand movements with his thumbs.,My son was prescribed Invega because risperidone had worked to control his rage and anger better than any other antipsychoic. His doctor wanted the effects of risperidone to last longer so this was the natural choice. Zyprexa and Seroquel were awful both bringing a dark_ depressing cloud over his moods. Invega does a good job of controlling his mania and he has more periods of normalcy; however_ unlike risperidone_ it causes depression and irritabity that he did not experience with risperidone. I also noticed more rapid cycling with this drug and a very strong hunger-induced rage. Once he ate_ he was better_ but it would start up again after a few hours. I did not notice this on the riperidone_ so today I made a decision to take him off of Invega and switch him back to risperidone. I would rather have the periods of mania over the uncontrollable depression_ crying and anger with Invega.,M,10,1  months3 MG 1X D,7/11/2010Email,Invega

Risperdol caused me to lactate_ (no fun in that) on top of the side effects I had with Invega. I have to say it has kept my moods stable at only 3mg_ so I have room to move up if needed. No more paranoia or tactile hal. I would recommend this drug to anyone with bipolar. Again the side effects are there but I have yet to find one that has no miserable side effects at all.

I never got angry about anything while on it (not sure if this one's a benefit or side effect,Since I hate all drugs that take away my ability to get a hard-on (aka erectile dysfunction for all the asperger's people)_ I stopped taking this one after about a month.  On the positive_ I believe it reduced my anxiety/paranoia/delusional thinking a small amount....not that those were huge problems for me.

I go to the gym regularly to keep the weight at bay although I noticed I was the chubbiest one at my high school reunion after being on the medication for about a year. It takes me forever_ if at all_ to get an orgasm_ and I barely have a sex drive although I have had sex more in the past 6 months than all my life (can't accuse me for not trying!).  I started smoking pot and was doing it every week for the high_ but had 1 manic attack after smoking 2 days in a row even on medication.

It worked fast and helped to get my mania in check and keep my mood more stable.  It helped with my paranoia issues too.  I started at 3mg and went to 9mg_ which is where I stayed for most of the time I was on it.  The bump to 6mg brought the most noticeable therapeutic benefit jump.  All the side effects appeared at the 3mg level and pretty much right away - though perhaps the memory thing was more apparent with time.

When I started at about 6 mgs we upped it to 9 after a month.  I went up to 12mg but that was too much.  So_ it took about three months to get a balance. This drug has been a miracle drug for me. I take it in combination with Citalopram an antidepresant. I also have vistiral as an anxiety drug as needed.  I sleep wonderfully at night. However_ sometimes I go to bed as early as 8:00 PM if I am working hard_ busy.  So for me the drowsiness increases with my physical activity.

164, 1, voices_ raging disorder_ violence,extreme weight gain_ sleeping 16 hrs a day_ major prolactin levels_ missed periods,My daughter has been on Invega for less than a year (6ml in am_ 3ml in the pm)  It has helped with the raging and self injurous behaviors and of course the voices are gone. BUT she is sleeping the minute she gets home from school till 6 am the next day_ she has gained 40 lbs in 8 months and started lactating and missing periods in the last two months. We had the same issue with Risperdal (she took it 4 yrs before the same issues started).  She is mentally handicapped with a seizure disorder_OCD and has a raging issue.  She is on trilepal and topamax for seizures and Seroquel (1200ml daily)Invega (both strengths) for raging and voices_ and Lexapro for anxiety.  Now we are headed to a new drug Stelazine.  Weening her off Invega slowly and adding the new drug.  I would not recommend Risperdal nor Invega to any female at all.  It causes to many hormonal issues.  She actually had to have an MRI with Risperdal to make sure she didn't have a pituitary tumor.  Her level was 182 with Risperdal.,F,20,10  months,10/30/2008Email,Invega
165, 3, major depression - anger control,Gained 20 lbs in one month.  Loss of focus. Movement feels slightly awkward like a robot rather than human. Speech and thinking feels sluggish and dumbed down.,"Took to ""lengthen fuse"" on occasional explosive anger that resulted in hurting myself by overdosing. It does seem to do that effectively.  Due to rapid weight gain I'm getting blood tests to screen out drug induced diabetes.  I'm looking forward to proving to my psych that I can behave calmly enough now without Invega so I can get off it. I can't say it's a primary cause of sex side effects (impotence) I'm experiencing because I was already taking Cymbalta that was already effecting me sexually.",M,42,3  months,10/21/2008,Invega
166, 5, Bipolar disorder,At 3mg_ virtually no side effects. At 6mg_ somnolence in the AM. At 9mg_ somnolence in the AM and much of the afternoon_ amotivated and apathetic_ but not particularly flat.,Invega is way better than Risperdal as regards side effectsit's not nearly as flattening as Risperdal. 3mg of Invega seems to be equal to 1mg of Risperdal_ in my experience. This is a fine med. I'm currently on 3mg qd; it helps me sleep w/o a morning hangover.,M,,20  months,10/16/2008Email,Invega

169, 4, Bipolar,None noted,I'm thinking it could be the cause for my increase in headaches. I switched to Invega because Geodon made me feel too lethargic and run down--too fuzzy headed; Invega is much more light.,M,47,3  months,9/1/2008,Invega
170, 2, Bi-Polar,severe weight gain_ memory loss_  agoraphobia_ loss of interest in a)sex b)hygiene c)social interaction_ food obsession_ hesitancy urinating_ severe constipation_ severe fog,Who would want social interaction after all of that?! I used to be a social butterfly and am now dreading people_ talking on the phone_ being seen after gaining 20lbs in a month (sound impossible? Trust me_ it's not) I needed this after a suicide attempt_ but screw it....I would rather be dead than fat and ugly with no capability  of retaining information. That in itself is depressing.,F,33,2  months,8/31/2008,Invega
171, 4, bipolar,Invega seems to cause daytime sleepiness for me_ but I do sleep better at night. If I take it with clonopin in PM_ I'm zonked the next day.,It has helped bring me down from a 2 month high that other meds didn't effect.  Switching from Wellbutrin back to Effexor seems to have helped too.  So far_ so good!,F,63,6  weeks,8/3/2008,Invega

174, 1, ,dskinesia (involuntary movements / jerks of the arms and legs - movement similiar to if your body received an electric shock)_ sexual dsyfunction.,I took 6mg Invega for a year. My arms and legs involuntarily move almost as if they were given strong electric shocks. They jump like this several times daily. I have had problems with not ejaculating or ejaculate volume being minimal. Most of the time I ejaculate without orgasm or have a extremely weak orgasm (about 1% of normal). I have been off risperdal for almost a month now and have not regained my ability to orgasm and my involuntary movements are still occur daily but not as frequent or as strong. I would not recommend this drug to anyone_ only for short-term (1 month) use to extinguish a major psychotic epsisode.,M,32,1  years,6/17/2008,Invega

177, 1, Bipolar,Extreme mental confusion.,I have been on Invega for five days and the mental confusion is bad enough that  must quit immediately. Simple paper work tasks at work are overwhelming. Before Invicta_ some confusion but no real problems. I started due to bipolar mania_ but this just isn't worth it.,M,53,5  days,4/21/2008,Invega

180, 4, Non-psychotic hallucinations_ bp?,none noted,My son is on 3mg. His diagnosis is ongoing_ but now we're looking at severe anxiety and depression or bipolar. He was on Risperdal and Prozac and did ok for a while_ but recently started having severe mood swings_ worsening of depression_ and hearing voices and seeing things again. Increasing Risperdal helped a little_ but he yawned all the time and you could really tell when the dose was wearing off. Invega has worked very well for him so far. He stays in a much more steady mood all day and is becoming more pleasant. Also recently switched Prozac to Wellbutrin_ and either the overlap of the 2 drugs helped or the Wellbutrin is really helping. Just finishing tapering off the Prozac.,M,9,6  weeks,1/14/2008,Invega
181, 1, BP-Voices,This medication was likely responsible for the deepest depression I have ever felt. I can't say this for sure_ but the time frames correlate pretty well.,What's the point of remarketing a drug that is a downstream metabolite of another drug (Risperdal). Maybe I should add a hydroxyl group to some medication and call it my own.,M,30,2  months,10/4/2007,Invega

183, 2, bipolar,sleepiness_ face around moustache and chin very red_ dry_ and irritated especially after shaving.  Had no will to have sex and could not get a boner if i tried.  Not enough reduction of BP symptoms.,"Isn't working very well for me.  I had to come off Risperdal because it stopped working after a year and now a couple years later i'm back on this which is some sort of isolated form of risperdal.  I started on 3mg which wasn't ""doing anything"" to 6mg which sedated me and still didn't take away my horrible dreams or let me sleep which is one of the things my BP does to me.  I am back on 3mg as of 2 weeks ago and am going to ask my MD this week about stopping due to being tired_ boner problem_ and face irritation.",M,30,45  days,9/16/2007,Invega
