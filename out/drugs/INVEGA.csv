0, 5, Schizoaffective disorder,Lactation_ loss of period/very irregular periods_ loss of sex drive_ loss of imagination WEIGHT GAIN (40+ pounds!) but more positively_ back to reality,It is the best anti psychotic I have ever been on and I've been on 4 or 5. No mental side effects like drowsiness or feeling dead like others. Was back to normal which is what the drug is supposed to do.,F,25,3  years75 mg/mo,7/29/2016,Invega
1, 1, Psychosis,It does get better! I used to be tired_ not able to run or do anything. No sexual sex drive_ severe anhedonia. Severe suicidal thoughts every day. Not able to get drunk. Sleeping 18 hours a day. Weight gain. I took injections for about 8 months and I stopped taking it about 8 months ago. I AM COMPLETELY BACK TO NORMAL. Don't lose hope. After about 6-8 months you'll be back to normal_ i swear it has been the worst time of my life going through this waiting period time wondering if I would ever come back to a normal life. edouardapril@gmail.com if you need to talk. I have been through this_ you'll be able to recover.,,M,28,8  months75 1X M,7/6/2016Email,Invega
2, 3, bipolar I mixed treatmentresistant,"Extreme weight gain_ so far up 15 pounds in 2.5 months_ some due to increased appetite & some for unknown reason--what this kind of drug always does.Metabolic? Also daily headache. And it's just ridiculously expensive. I'm probably stopping it even tho I think it has helped me more(harmed me less?) than others like it because I can't handle the weight gain and the cost has devastated my Medicare drug coverage.I'm now in the ""donut hole."" SO frustrating to finally find something that helps or at least keeps you out of the hospital but also packs on the pounds and destroys you financially_ which ends up making you as vulnerable to another episode as you were before you started taking it.",Why can't our poor impoverished  drug co's find a drug w/o such disabling consequences? l'm trying for a Rx assistance program...For the weight gain_ after 25 yrs on psych meds I'm not surprised when I just get fatter. I eat less_ increase activity_ but as it seems inevitable that I will gain weight no matter what I take_ I try not to let it get me too down.(Good luck w/that.) I wish BigPharma thought mental illness was as important as erectile dysfunction.And how about something specifically for bipolar besides lithium_which has been around since leeches?At this point I would try anything.SO tired of off-label_ symptom-driven drugs never meant for bipolar illness but for schizophrenia_ seizures_major depression_ anxiety_OCD_ADD &other random neuro-social problems.On antipsychotics I feel like I'm stumbling around in an already hostile environment_only now also clumsy-fat plus with a paper bag over my head.Invega may work better but its side effects outweigh its benefits.No pun intended.It's hard enough to live w/mental illness in America w/o being fat too.It's not just vanity; there are real health hazards to obesity--just ask the makers of those shiny new diet pills.For me Invega is best of a bunch of lousy choices. If I was rich enough to buy it in the 1st place & could also hire a personal trainer & a chef (i.e._Oprah-Winfrey rich)_Invega could probably be a workable stopgap until we finally invest in treating the bipolar. I don't see that happening anytime so,F,60,3  months3mg ER,7/4/2016,Invega
3, 3, schizoprhenera and bipolar,Loss of sex drive_ trouble with anything working sexual that is your junk kinda quits on ya_weight gain_ and your not sure if you care anymore about anything but you know what you want to feel_ sleepy Ness _ overall weakness feeling mentaly and physicaly_ detachment_ defiantly a sadness you miss what life might use to be like,All in all it works to stop your psychotic symptoms and it stops the voices prevents homicidal and suicidal thoughts stops the paranoia too.

4, 1, Schizophrenia,Side effects are emotional flattening_ spaciness_ and loss of interest in life. Also sleep problems_ dry eye_ drooling_ slowness of response and movement. Low libido_ and little effect from alcohol.,This drug really saps my energy in every way. Takes away the will to live by stripping the emotions dry. Feel one step removed from reality.

5, 1, schitzofrinia,Severely sore and swollen neck and sore neck. I went to the hospital and got a cats can and they said I have muscle spasm which is a side effect of invega.I also had the shakes of my fingers and hands which is also a a side effect since I have sezures. They lowered the dose but it still did not help. I've got a dry mouth and a sore throat as well which are also side effects. And last but not least my bad cholesterol went up and is now too high because of this because it is also a side effect.,I did not get any of these side effects till the very end after I've been on it nearly a year. The  worst one was the muscle spasm that I was getting in theneck which hurt my head very bad.I could barely lift up my head from a lying position or even turn my head from left to right. It hurt so much.it felt like I was carrying around a heavy weight in my head which I wasn't.,F,37,9  months119,5/28/2016,Invega
6, 4, Schizoaffective,Eye twitching,I've been on a bunch of different anti psychotic's over the last couple years. This has been the better option of them all for me to date. Not 100% satisfied because I want more of the symptoms greatly reduced but logically it just isn't going to happen. The eye twitch is annoying when it peaks but it's livable. Understood this would help with mood stabilization and such but have not seen any improvements in those areas even after a dose increase. Did help reduce my negative/suicidal voices so that's my biggest plus because other medications couldn't do it. Anxiety has increased and currently not being treated for it like I want because doctors seem to think this is the cure all problems meds but I think something else is needed to address side issues related to my condition even though I hate taking these pills. Have been pretty forgetful but can't really say if the medication is causing it or just long term effects of my life choices catching up to me. Hard to remember some days if I took my meds or not so have considered the injection but wished it did more before i jumped on board for the injection.,M,26,4  months6 1X D,5/16/2016Email,Invega

15, 1, Mood swings/ OCD,This medication was an absolute nightmare. My son began the medicine after the Doctor swore it was weight neutral. My 14 year old gained almost 40 pounds in one year. Another side effect was that he always exhausted_ and lacked any motivation. I brought the extreme weight gain to our Doctors attention at each visit. We finally had to switch doctors because the doctor insisted on leaving him on this med. This medicine also caused a thyroid condition in my child. The weaning-off process took almost two full months too. During this process_ my child had night sweats and profound exhaustion.. It was an absolute nightmare.,,M,14,1  years9mg,2/25/2016,Invega

I was on 5 psycotropic drugs when my psychiatrist decided to give me Invega.  Much to my dismay.  He did not titrait me off these other drugs before giving me the Invega.  2 days after receiving a long-lasting(30day) injection of Invega I attempted suicide. I don't remember anything prior to my attempt.  I am now picking up the pieces of my life.  I have been in recovery for the last 6 months.  I have suffered multiple broken bones. Legs_ arms_ feet(heels)_ pelvis_ back bones along with an acquired brain injury.From all accounts I should be dead. I now have to use a walker.  My feet and legs are very swollen from all the nerve and vein damage that occurred. I should have not have put on this drug.

I was sleeping 18 out of every 24 hours and had to cut back uni. I also put on 70 kgs before my doctor went_ ""This is a problem""_ and gave me Metformin as well. Basically my health has been ruined because some drug rep conned my doctor into believing this drug wasn't the toxic dreck it is. I wouldn't give this med to a dog I cared about and the drug reps that push it should be shot.",F,37,4  years100 1X M,4/14/2015,Invega
53, 1, Drug Induced Psychosis they say,I have no feelings for anything or anyone. No more interest in my future. Feels like nothing else to live for_ if never been suicide before invega was injected into my body. I'm fine without the injection and they keep suggesting I take it. I have a twitching pupple_ it twitches all day long with 20 second breaks. I suddenly cry for no reason at times. When I'm not on the injection I'm always in a good mood. I have no way to produce adrenaline_ serotonin or dopamine anymore it seems after taking this so I'm always in a depressed mood.,They are putting me on the wrong medication constantly.
