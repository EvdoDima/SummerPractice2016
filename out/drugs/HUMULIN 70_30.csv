I was put on insulin in 2005.  I only take 50 units 2 times a day.  so far_ I can say that my sugar has had better readings and I feel alot better.  my diet has helped and my eating habits have changed a great deal.  i walk more and in general_ i feel great.,proper management under doctor's advise is the cure.  insulin_ diet_ medication and a good family doctor has helped me stabalize my sugars and feel better about myself.,F,50,6  years,3/20/2009Email,Humulin 70/30
