0, 4, Anxiety_ Bipolar,Great drug!  Immediately felt better day 1 - reduced crazy thoughts and calmed anxiety.  I'm hooked though.  I've tried to stop it a few times and I always go back on due to symptoms coming back.  I did not have weight gain much for many years but recently found out I have high triglycerides - but this just may be due to all the junk food I have been eating lately.  : ),Great drug!  Really helped me.  So glad I got on this drug.,F,48,7  years2.5mg 1X D,1/21/2014Email,Zyprexa zydis
1, 1, they hated me,Chemical lobotomy.,Higher doses of zyprexa are just TOXIC to the brain. Use Seroquel IR 400mg/night instead. Or maybe Zyprexa 5mg. Avoid all neuroleptics and use anticonvulsants instead.,M,32,3  months15 1X D,8/8/2013,Zyprexa zydis
2, 1, Bipolar,Trouble breathing_ dysautonomia_ brainstem damage. Lack of concentration.,Zyprexa is just a toxic drug. Use Seroquel instead if possible. Internet is full of lies but Seroquel IR 400mg/night is not that bad but all atypicals are deadly. One should only use sleeping pills or low doses of pure dopamine blockers (peratsin).,M,32,2  years5 MG 1X D,3/20/2013,Zyprexa zydis
3, 1, auditory hallucinations,Constantly tired_ substantial weight gain - 20 pounds in 4 months.,I was on very small doses of zyprexa_ starting at 2.5 mg/day then increasing to 3.75 mg/day and then back to 2.5 mg/day.  It made me sleep longer than usual and even after waking_ still felt tired most of the day.  I felt like a zombie and wasn't able to do anything.  I also gained alot of weight fast. I finally stopped taking it_ my weight stopped increasing and I was more awake and alert during the day.  The worst part of all this is that the medication had little effect on the auditory hallucinations I was having.,M,39,4  months,2/6/2009Email,Zyprexa zydis
4, 3, ptsd schioeffective depress anxiety,I gained 55 pounds in 2 years_ my cholestrol was elevated_ I was tired all the time avg 12 to 13 hours sleep a day_ it made me not remember very well_ my legs were restless when I would try to sleep_ my feet would ache when I would walk_ I was on 10mg a day_ I was not very motivated. My doctors took me off it and changed to geodon due to weight gain and cholestoral and possibility of getting diabetis.,I was also on lorazapam and zoloft_ It took away my memory of past events that lead to me being on zyprexa_ was still not well enough to get back to work; sleep and no motivation_ But it did help with voices_ paranoia_ anxiety and depression. But the best thing it did for me was take away smells_ so they did not effect me.,F,37,2  years,8/21/2008Email,Zyprexa zydis
5, 3, Mood disorder nos_ cutting_ anxiety,tardive dyskinsia_ somulance_ makes me dumb and demotivated.,I was on Seroquel 375 mg but I got tardive dyskinesia. I was also so sleepy. Zyprexa is a far better drug_ I'm not nearly as sleepy (on 7.5 mg) but have constant fatigue. Also I used to be able to read heavy theory for uni_ but I no longer can. Doesn't make sense-words swim around on the page. Also got tardive dyskinesia. Doc says this shouldn't happen with Zyprexa_ so I don't know if its from the seroquel that I was previously on or the Zyprexa. I don't believe my psychiatrist as the package insert says it can cause tardive dyskinesia. I blame the Zyprexa but I'm a bit confused. Any help would be much appriecated.

6, 3, Bipolar,This medication knocked me out..I slept all day long.,I was on Zyprexa many years ago but I just found this website so I thought I would add my two cents on the meds I have tried. I took this medication on and off for around three years time.,F,22,3  years,5/11/2008,Zyprexa zydis

8, 1, for anxiety and sleeping,huge weight gain_ no sexual feelings_ depression_ anxiety_ no help with sleeping_ major difficulty with withdrawal. Terrible drug.,I'm trying a program to accelerate drug reduction from a site called theroadback.orgwhich offers a full tapering program for both antianxiety and antipsychotic meds. It'stoo soon to say if it works but they seem to understand what it takes to get off thesedrugs. Zyprexa is very dangerous_ can cause diabetes_ pancreatitis_ and death,M,64,3  years,6/16/2007,Zyprexa zydis
9, 5, bipolar 2_ 1st mixed state ever,at 15 mg_ saved my life overnight  LITERALLY just stopped the death wish overnightCut to 10 mg on 3rd daySugar/carb cravings_ sleeping well_ stopped praying for death_ so I'll just have to be careful about my diet & not get too dependent on this stuff.,"Saved my life_ like I said.  First time in close to a year I don't spend my entire day crying/sobbing/screaming screaming screaming screaming in my car driving with windows rolled up because the pain was so bad tears were not enought to express it.  This crap lasted probably eight months at least.So_ yeah_ this stuff saved my life.  Switched to regular Zyprexa after 1 week -- I really think I could go down to 5 mg now.  Finally can sleep (w/Ambien_ too_ but that was not working on its own)...definitely for short term use only but please DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT -- you CAN lose the weight; -- it's a quality of life thing_ really...it short circuited my death-state and I am living and laughing and working again.I am having a helluva a time with my breathing though_ frequently -- what's up with that?  Like I'm breathing really hard and/or my heart is pounding like I've been climbing stairs all day or something_ can't catch my breath...geez...really_ what's up with that?  I am 5'4""",F,47,10  days,11/4/2006,Zyprexa zydis

11, 4, Schizoaffective disorder,Loss of libido_ increased need for sleep_ some weight gain,This medication treated my psychosis when the dose was raised to a sufficient level (initially 40mg_ then 20 mg). I am now on 10 mg and I have noticed that the side effects only stop when the drug is completely withdrawn from your system. Even at 2.5mg_ I still have no interest in sex.,M,26,18  months,3/29/2006,Zyprexa zydis
12, 4, Bipolar - Mixed episodes,definite weight gain_ hypoglycemic-type episodes where I feel weak and dizzy and crave sugar.  I take it at night and it is sometimes hard to wake up in the mornings,This drug was very effective in controlling my intrusive thoughts and while I take it_ I notice less need for Xanax.  An effect I didn't expect but appreciate is that it has relieved my mild stage fright.,M,38,6  months,9/10/2005Email,Zyprexa zydis
