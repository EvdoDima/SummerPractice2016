0, 2, Type 2 diabetes,More pain_ worked early on_ now seems to not work at all? The Metformin dosage is 1000Mg with each dose.,I had some early on benefit from Janumet. I was on 2000 Mg of Metformin XR daily but my A1C had crept up to 8.3 from 6.7 just a couple years ago. So decided to try Janumet. Had some better numbers early on_ but about 70 days into it my numbers remain higher then ever. Averaging 240 now even fasting which was 150 now is over 200. Doing blood test to find out why. I believe the Janumet caused a negative problem with the pancreas. Personally_ although I cant prove much yet. I would say the Janumet hurt more then helped.,M,51,2  months30MG 2X D,6/20/2014Email,Janumet
1, 3, Type 2 diabetes,Experienced sore joints_ and muscular pain (calf muscles mostly_ but lower back also). Severe lack of energy_ slight constipation.,While this medication certainly lowered the diabetes problem_ the negative side effects were noted. I have come off this medication twice for a month at a time in order to ascertain whether the Janumet is actually causing these side effects. Both times negative side effects return once begining dossage again. Shame_ as it does work.,M,59,12  months50mg 1X D,7/31/2013,Janumet

3, 3, type 2 dibetic,Post nasal drip from hell- up to 30 OTC pills to dry me out to sleep and stop spitting up mucous all day. If I take more than 1& 1/2  of a 500 mg tab a day I get head aches. Actos started the mucous_ trying to find a type 2 med to take and get the mucous to stop. The spitting -up herniated my belly button_ too. I purchase 36 boxes of tissue a month. Mucous is robbing me of energy_ cannot go  on any trips.,Blood sugar good. I took regular metformin ( glucopahge ) for 10 years or so but started having headaches. Some weight loss from Actos reversed.,M,68,10  months750 mg 2X D,11/2/2011Email,Janumet
