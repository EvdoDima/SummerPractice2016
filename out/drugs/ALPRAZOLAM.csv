0, 3, Panic Disorder / Anxiety,Side effects were no big deal. Yes it makes you sleepy and you have to be careful driving. you DO get high off it no matter what people say. Even if only for 5 minutes_ you will get high. PLEASE be aware of the addiction risk!!!! I was on this med for 2 years and I went through the worst detox at home to get off it. You can DIE from a seizure if you stop taking it abruptly after forming a dependence. This is good for occasional panic attacks and nothing more. Do not take it for more than 6 months or you will form a dependence. Most people have to be hospitalized to get off this medication.,BEWARE!!! Do your own research and don't believe the doctor.,F,28,2  years2 4X D,7/28/2016,Alprazolam

2, 1, Doctor was pill happy,Depression_ dose wore off in less than 4 hours_ garbage med,There ahould be a law backed by federal jail sentence to ANY dr prescribing this or any benzo longer than two weeks max. My stupid dr (sloan) prescribed this after valium and i went through beween dose withdrawals that would take out a rhino. Anyone that says this is great is in dreamland and you just wait until you wake up from that dream!!! I told my dr(sloan) that i stopped taking this due to a severe drug reaction and he didnt even mention withdrawals. Speaking of withdrawals_ imagine jumping off a 20 story building...that would be easier than the withdrawals! The fda should be thrown into an active volcano and then sealed up_ theres absolutely NO way that these horrendous pills should be on the market...no freaking way. If i had known valium and this would produce the withdrawals i had experienced....id have glady chose the 20 story building. Never listen to positive ratings regarding benzos_ those people are past the point of return possibly and if you want to destroy and blast your life away then this is the pill to take.,M,41,1  months,7/18/2016,Alprazolam
3, 5, anxiety disorder and depression,This drug worked wonders for me until last refill. I always get a generic but for the first time got Dava brand and am jittery nd nervous and feel no relief of my symptoms.,,F,47,1  years0.5 mg,5/23/2016,Alprazolam
4, 4, Anxiety,finding that only the .5mg Greenstone generic_ the Sandoz_ and the Roche are the only two generics that help reduce my anxiety greatly and does not make me sleepy. All other generics Dava_ Qualitest_ Purepac_ Mylan_ Activis might as well be placebos. Why is this?,,M,41,5  years.5 MGP,10/1/2015Email,Alprazolam
5, 1, Anxiety,Went into tolerance to this med and it stopped working and gave me what it was supposed to treat.  Now I have to very slowly taper off of it due to the dangers of stopping it.  It's not pretty.  I don't recommend anyone take any drug in the Benzo family.  They will turn on you after you become addicted to it and your brain will want more.  It's been hell for me and many others.  These drugs should be banned!!,Very EVIL!!,F,65,9  years0.25 3X D,11/15/2014Email,Alprazolam
6, 1, Anxiety,Black out completely 3 times. Fainted_ dizziness_ drowsiness_ gastritis_ Ulcer_ THE WORST TOOK JUST HALF A PILL_ SAME DAY WILL NOT STOP BLEEDING FOR 10 DAYS (In the middle of an IUI Cycle_ thinking it was a miscarriage).,The strange thing is that one Manufacturer had no side effects whatsoever_ then the new manufacturer had horrible side effects including black outs & extreme bleeding.,F,,7  days5 MG 1X D,11/5/2014,Alprazolam
7, 5, panic disorder,Have been taking this since I was diagnosed with panic disorder and now it is strictly PRN. I take clonazepam daily (.5mg) and only take this if I am having an acute attack. Virtually no side effects for me. It simply makes me feel normal. If I take it before I need it (in anticipation of an attack that did not amount to much) it will make me very drowsy and most likely require that I rest. I cannot even imagine how or why someone would abuse these because I could never function if I were to take these for recreational purposes. There would be no recreation - just sleeping.,This drug gets a bad rap because so many ppl abuse it but it is a life saver for me. I only take it when I need it and it makes me feel normal. No drowsiness or drugged feeling - just removes that weird impeding doom sensation and allows me to function in a more normal way. I would recommend anyone trying it to start at the lowest possible dose and see what the smallest amount you can take and still reap the benefits. It can be a great medication when used as you are supposed to use it. Also_ I have never noticed a difference between brand and generic in this particular med although it seems some ppl have based on these reviews. I guess I have been lucky but it never failed no matter which manufacturer made it.,F,42,16  years1mg 4X W,5/6/2014Email,Alprazolam
8, 5, anxiety_ sleeplessness,When it comes to taking Alprazolam_ I must say there are a lot of generics on the market_ that are not worth taking at all. A lot of them are cheap quality_ and won't do a thing to help you from either having panic or anxiety attacks. Plus_ I have encountered some that left a horrible aftertaste in my mouth_ and that were also upsetting my stomach. The best generic to ask for is the Green stone brand. It is just as potent as the original Xanax_ has never caused any bad side effects_ and it has no bad aftertaste. It also doesn't upset my stomach either. I would check with all of your local pharmacies to see who carries the Green stone brand and get your alprazolam filled there. And_ request that  you  be given Green stone only (even if they have to special order it)for all future refills. The Sandoz brand is okay_ but not as high in potency as the Green stone brand. Dava is sub par and I certainly will never try it again. Purepac doesn't work well at all_ don't know why it's even on the,The best brand of Alprazolam to take is Greenstone. Don't waste your time and money on the other brands. Check with as many local pharmacies_ including small mom and pop pharmacy shops until you are able to find it. The other brands are totally less effective_ with Qualitest being the absolute worst.,F,38,5  months1mg 4X D,4/24/2014,Alprazolam
9, 5, panic disorder,"It works. Well. Take as Rxed_ and actually less (like half a pill at a time).At first I thought Ativan was better as I was on it (same dose) for 5 years. And it is better Â—if you never take Xanax. Ativan is ""smoother"" in that you never know you've taken a drug_ and then you feel normal_ fast. Also_ Ativan seems to last a little longer_ and (imo) works faster. HOWEVER_ once you get on Xanax_ Ativan just won't hold a candle to it; I'll be on X for life. It's a thing you just have to accept and not wig out about.","Don't pill pop (I've been on benzos for years; learned the hard way it's EASY to abuse); respect a benzo_ and it will help you. My dad's been on Valiums for decades (5mg/night_ though he's Rxed 10mg)_ and he helped me learn that. X is BEST ON MARKET for panic attacks_ but ONLY IF you respect them. I'm Rxed 3-4mg/day_ and usually take 2mg/day as needed_ but on very bad days (menstrual cycle)_ I'll end up taking all 4mg that day.There are times I wish I'd never have tried Xanax over Ativan_ as I was so happy on Ativan (psych doc put me on Xanax instead of Ativan because ""it's policy"" for panic disorder). But I've learned that even though Xanax doesn't last as long_ a half mg when I feel panic coming on REALLY helps stop that panic attack dead in its tracks. The Ativan (while faster-acting imo!) didn't STOP a panic attack as much as it helped me ""ease through one"". So there is NOTHING better on the market than Xanax for panic. (But you'll have to accept you're like a diabetic with insulin: you can't leave home without it_ and you can't stop taking it one day.) Just don't abuse them and you'll be fine.",F,35,3  years3 3X D,4/19/2014Email,Alprazolam
10, 5, anxiety and panic attacks,I started suffering with anxiety and panic attacks that would leave my heart racing_ my stomach upset_ my body trembling_ feeling tightness in chest_ and experiencing dizziness as well. My anxiety has always been something that I have struggled with_ but I had never sought to seek help for it. But_ due to recent deaths in my family that happened within a week of each other_ my anxiety basically went through the roof. So_ I decided to go to_ the doctor and prescribed amongst other things Xanax to take. I started out with 1mg_ which has been helping. But_ it leaves me too tired and sometimes feeling a bit out of it. I could not handle taking 1mg twice a day. Therefore_ I had to have a medication adjustment. I was then prescribed 0.25 mg to take 3 times a day. This dosage is best for me.,It really is the best pill to take if you suffer from anxiety and/or panic attacks. You just have to make sure that you are prescribed the right dosage_ and you will definitely see a difference!,F,38,25  days1mg 2X D,10/31/2013,Alprazolam

You cannot stop suddenly which can lead to seizures etc. Needs to have a blackbox warning so patients taking are aware of the dangerousside effects of "" Benzodiazepine Withdrawal"". DO NOT STOPTAKING. You must be under a DRs care with  any of these types of medications. I wish I would have known before I took this.

13, 5, Panic Attacks,Drowsiness,I had knee surgery about two weeks ago and was taking pain medication (hydrocodone) which was causing me panic attacks at night for some reason. He prescribed this for the short duration.  It worked.  I took two_ then a third and was able to lay down and fall asleep.

16, 3, airplane anxiety,made me very sleepy_ I don't know how anyone could get addicted to this as it just makes you sleepy,I took this for airplane anxiety_ it pretty much knocked me out (1 mg) so in that regard I guess it did work because how can you be anxious when you are asleep?  BUT_ it was not pleasant and I felt groggy later on.  I do not understand how anyone would want to take more of this drug.,F,28,5  times1 mg 1X D,7/8/2012,Alprazolam
17, 5, Anxiety,Drowsiness like that of one alcoholic drink for the first 20 - 30 minutes.,This stuff works very well!  Yes_ it is highly addictive and should not be taken daily unless you want to become dependent on it.  I take this on an emergency basis only.  Maybe once a month if things are too stressful for me to handle.  I take 0.5mg and 20 minutes later_ POOF_ all anxiety is completely and totally gone and IÂ’m left with a feeling of peaceful calmness washing over me for the next few hours.

Unfortunately it's highly addictive as I've come to learn_ even at its lowest dosage.

22, 5, Panic attacks_ anxiety disorder,None,Literally saved my life.  Was suffering panic attacks for 8 years. Panic became almost continuous causing extreme high blood pressure.  Doctors kept telling me nothing was wrong with me.  After years of fear and panic_ a blood vessel ruptured in my eye from the high blood pressure and a doctor finally diagnosed me with panic disorder and put me on blood pressure medicine and Xanax.  It literally saved my life since he said the blood vessel could have ruptured in my brain causing a stroke.

23, 2, Panic Attacks,It made me groggy_ incoherent_ and brought me into hell which people call withdrawal after only 1 month of use.,I would strongly advise against taking this drug for longer than a month. This is a very addictive drug. If you've been taking it longer than a month and try to stop...good luck. Benzo withdrawal is possibly the worst experience your body will endure in like_ and it often goes on for months.  Be wise with this pill.,M,26,1  months4 mg 2X D,10/28/2011,Alprazolam
24, 2, Anxiety/Panic Disorder,Some relief but it wasn't worth the withdrawal.,If I could go back_ I would only have taken this on extreme emergency days. I think the drug is probably OK in that regard. Even then_ I'd probably recommend Valium or a longer-lasting benzo.  Withdrawal was awful. I'm 5 months into withdrawal and just now starting to feel human.  You really need to weigh your pros/cons when using this. Some people don't have much problem_ but many seem to. Very hard to come off of_ and I took it at LOW doses_ conservatively and tapered slowly. Still had a horror coming off. Once in a while_ probably OK.

I'm much calmer and rarely experience panic attacks anymore.  I'm sure I'm dependent on it by now but I don't take more than what's prescribed_ if that_ and it helps me be 'normal.'
