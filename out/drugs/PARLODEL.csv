1, 1, Prolactinoma,Blurred vision_ stuffy nose_ dizziness_ forgetfulness_ confusion_ twitching_ bilateral headache_ heart palpitations_ peripheral vaso-constriction (L Foot)_ constipation_ increased depression_ lumpy painful breasts_ nightmares and outrageous vivid dreams.,My endocrinologist has insisted over the years that I keep trying to tolerate this medication due to it's benefits (bone density etc).  After 14 more weeks of side effects even with vaginal administration_ I have been advised to STOP taking the Bromocriptine due to the increasing amount of side effect I seem to have every time I attempt to take this medication. The most interesting side effect this time has been lumpy and painful breasts_ which should have been the opposite to what should have occurred.....according to the endocrinologist!  Finally my specialist has admitted defeat on this drug and has instead decided to supplement estrogen levels if they become too low......Hallelujah!,F,46,100  days5mg 1X D,9/27/2015,Parlodel

5, 3, Prolactinoma,Irritability_ light headed_ nausea_ no appetite.,Those were most of my symptoms_ thank goodness_ I wasn't on this RX for long. Where I fill my RX_ I would assume_ the Brand is something they do not keep in stock. When it comes to this condition_ I ask for only_ the generic (Bromocriptine). My Prolactin levels were over 180_ and since the medicine is working_ they do not see a need for the surgery. That_ is just fine! I'm so sorry to see a lot of you are unhappy with this RX_ if possible_ see if you're able to get the generic (Bromocriptine)_ you'll be satisfied with that choice.

The doctor told me that it's the cause of elevated prolactin which is 59 so they put me on parlodel for 1 month. 2 weeks of taking the med i experienced light headednes_irritability.after 1 month my prolactin level went back to normal.  Then after 2  months without parlodel it elevated again so my doctor told me to take parlo for two months. Last monday_ i had my test and the result is soooooo weird!

This med also helps me sleep.,I had pituitary tumor removed back in 2001.  Prolaction level has now gone up again and no menses.  I have also gained weight.  I was on bromo/parlodel years ago briefly.  I was also on Dostinex/Carbogeline with even more horrible side effects.  So trying Bromo again to lower prolactin and resume ovulation and periods.  Although I hear it can take a few months before becoming pregnant. Not sure how much my prolactin levels have gone down yet.  Need to see the endocrine specialist for follow-up lab/test.,F,39,30  days5 mg 1X D,10/28/2011,Parlodel
12, 1, Hyperprolactinemia,Extreme nasal congestion_ hair loss,My fertility doctor placed me on this medication for a slightly elevated prolactin level.  My MRI was normal.  I did not want to take the medication_ but felt obligated to give it a try at the recommendation of my physician.  The first night I COULD NOT breathe through my nose whatsoever.  Try falling asleep with your mouth open!  Not fun.  I called my doctor the next day_ and I was told to take the medication vaginally.  I did not like the sound of that_ especially since I did not want to take it in the first place.  The nasal congestion stopped once I started the vaginal administration.  Several days into the course of treatment I noticed more hair in my comb than what I was used to seeing.  As I paid closer attention_ I noticed excessive hair falling out during the day.  There was no way I was going to put up with it any longer.  I called my doctor and they ordered another prolactin test.  My level dropped significantly within a short period of time on the medication.  My doctor told me I could discontinue the treatment (which I had every intention of doing anyway).  My hair continued to shed up to 200 hairs per day for the next 3 months.  It finally stopped and now falls within the normal range of daily hair loss.  For a woman with long hair_ it was a complete nightmare.  The drug successfully lowered my prolactin_ but the hair loss was horrific.  Of course_ the treatment did not result in a pregnancy either.  Take with caution_ and be sure to ask about potential side eff,F,38,10  days2.5 1X D,10/18/2011,Parlodel

15, 3, Microadenoma,Stuffy nose 4-5 hours after the first dose_ 2.5mg_ sleepiness_ slight headache on one side(right)_numbness in the arms_ stuffy head and puffy eyes_ light nauseous_ dry eyes,My prolactin level was incidentally showed a  slightly high.less than 30 and higher than 24. The MRI showed 2-3mm slightly increase in the anteria of the Pituatary Gland.  Without confirmed test_ my doctor told me the vast majority is benigh and put me on Parlodel to shrink the tumor. I asked how can one confirm if it is benigh_ invasive or malignant; the anwer was: the microedenoma behaves like a benigh tumor: the small size_ secreting prolactin and most of all_ most tumors within the Pituary Gland is noncancerous.  If it gets larger_ radiation and surgery can intervine.  The surgery can be done via my upper gum and the tumor will be nipped off.  Large tumor can interfere with my vision...causing headache and I won't be able to see things on my sides_ only what is in front of me.  This is the worse scenerio.  So my heart goes out for all victims who has PIT tumor and wish all of us recover well.  I am a very active mom with three teenage boys_ working full time and helping the community.  Having to take this medication somehow slows my daily activity down for now.  I hope the side effects will subside soon so I can go on with my daily activity.,F,44,1  days,1/23/2010Email,Parlodel

And even when this last one migt be the least serious of all of the above_ I especially hate this one. Air can't get throuh my nose at all and it last for about 15 minutes.,Before this medicine I was happy_ felt fine. My only symptom was secondary amenorrhea. The cause: my prolactine levels was high >100 due to a prolactinoma. So the doctor prescribed me Bromocriptine 5mg_ which lower my prolactine level and got my mens back_ but at what cost. It makes me feel sick_ and I hate it. After two months_ side effects seemed to go away. Then I start suffering from loss in appetite and involuntary lost in weight_ which really concerned me. Side efects returned really bad after this. So I ask the doctor for a dietary suplement and that smooth them. This fourth month I forgot to take the medicine a couple of days (~4 days) and I was starting feeling better_ like before the medicine. But then I remember to take it and the boromocriptine nightmare was back. I want to quit it so bad!,F,25,4  months,11/5/2009,Parlodel

No weight loss yet!!!,The first two weeks were horrible:  vomiting_ extreme dizziness_ I felt as if I had a constant 24hr bug so I switched to Dostinex.  HUGE MISTAKE!  I was completely disoriented the entire time.  So I switched back_ after a week the symptoms lessened.  I still feel slightly sick all the time_ and my appetite is almost completely gone.  Everything I used to love to eat_ makes me sick to think about it.  I can't sleep at night_ take pm meds to rest_ and as soon as I lay down_ my head gets completely choked up.  However_ my prolactin level dropped from 200 to 16 within a month.

But after a few weeks I had no side effects.,My first sypmtom was galactorrhea. Blood tests revealed an excess of prolactin but MRI showed no tumor. Completely idiopathic. I started a generic bromocriptine December 19. I didn't feel much different but the medication was working: I stopped leaking and apparently started ovulating. Luckily my husband and I were trying to get pregnant; on February 10 I tested positive. (I've since stopped taking the medication_ per my endo.)

I had elevated prolactin which was causing the severe PMS.  My prolactin level is now ZERO on the drug (normal) and I feel great that way. I have been taking 5 mg at night from 1984-present (2009) and have had no problems_ just help with stabilizing mood.  After many years of being on it_ you get the old ""maybe I can cut down on it now"" thing_ so I tried going down from 2 pills to 1-1/2 and had a lot of AM anxiety - after a month on 1-1/2 pills_ I admitted that I just didn't feel right at all_ so went back up to 2 pills and I started feeling perfect again.

My doctor discovered my tumor when he did a prolactin level as I was trying to get pregnant.  It has been wonderful for me when I do take it as it keeps my period regular and it is not healthy for me to be without a period still as I have not yet gone through menopause.  The only thing I am starting to wonder about though is my insomnia.  If I go to bed at 10 pm or 10:30 pm_ I typically have a VERY hard time falling asleep quickly_ but if I stay up to at least midnight or 1 am_ I fall asleep better.
