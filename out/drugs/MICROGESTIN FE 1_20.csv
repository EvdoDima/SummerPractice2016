0, 1, Birth control,I recently started seeing a guy and decided to go on birth control just to be safe. Worst decision ever! I have been a moody_ crazy_ bitch and if he still likes me it's a miracle! Within a week of taking this pill I was depressed_ tired and had crazy mood swings. I got mad at him for absolutely nothing. I've been causing problems between us with no invocation. Recently I started noticing how tired I've been. I'm not sure if this is from the pill but I've been sleeping 8+ hours and always feel tired during the day. Also_ I'm not sure when they started but I've had a constant headache for the last two weeks at least. Makes it very hard to think.,,F,27,1  months,7/15/2016,Microgestin fe 1/20

4, 3, Terrible heavy periods,Mild breast pain_ vomiting morning after,So far I can't say I've had fatigue_ since I stay up till midnight (at least)_ but just the boob pain felt like a metal claw from those sucky claw machines_ that eat away at your savings_ just squeezing your boob and poking it really hard. I guess that's the only way to describe it. I've been a little more irritable_ but not by much. No crying spells or whatever. I'm kinda disappointed because I wanted to have_ like major breast growth in the next_ like 24 hours after taking it_ but I won't ask for the impossible,F,14,2  days1 mg,5/31/2016,Microgestin fe 1/20

6, 4, Acne treatment,Initial depression,I started the pill to try and manage my acne. At first it got much worst_ but then after a few months my face is clear for the first time in years.

8, 1, Birth Control,Weight Gain_ anxiety attacks_ chest pains_ severe depression_ constantly hungry_ bloated_ fatigue_ negative_ irritated_ angry outbursts_ breakthrough periods_ barely existent periods_ no sex drive whatsoever.,"I've switched birth control a few times due to problems here and there. These were the worst pills I have taken.Everything seemed to be fine at first. Then_ I started getting moodier and irritated more easily than usual. I started getting mild anxiety problems_ which quickly escalated into chest pains triggered by mildly annoying situations_ becoming extremely anti-social and avoidance of all social interaction even with my husband. I started becoming tired all the damn time.Nothing I was doing to lose weight was helping. It would only prevent me from gaining more. I used to do strength training in combination of low carb diets and that worked wonders before. Overall I've gained about 20lbs since I've taken it.I'm irritable and angry at the world all the time. I feel completely hopeless. I used to be really cheerful and pretty positive with the exception of the occasional moody outburst around my period.I've always had lighter periods lasting about 3 days. On this pill_ they are very light. I'll often have breakthrough bleeding and spotting and end up with two barely noticeable ""is this actually a period or dark discharge?"" periods.On other pills I've tried_ my skin was very clear with the occasional pimple around my period. I used to have pretty bad cystic acne.The acne combined with the weight gain_ none of my clothes fitting_ and the anxiety makes me not want to leave my house. This is awful.",F,34,10  months1 1X D,4/25/2016,Microgestin fe 1/20
9, 1, Figured I should take birth control,Before I had been depressed but then I started taking B6 vitamins and my depression was gone for a year. Then started this and I have never had such bad anxiety in my life. I have suicidal thoughts and panic attacks multiple times a day. I stopped taking it today and I'm praying that my anxiety goes away. I've barely eaten or slept in 3 months. I tried to wait it out but it just kept getting worse. Also to add to the problem my birth control completely canceled out my B6 viatimins that I continued to take so all that years worth of fixing myself is wasted. Senior proms in two weeks and graduation in two months and I can barely drag myself out of bed after my morning panic attack. I used to be a 3.7gpa average and no I have all D's.,This was the worse decision of my life. I wish I had researched it before I took the pill.,F,18,3  months1/20,3/23/2016,Microgestin fe 1/20

I also work out and still gained the weight. Also would bleed so much when I wasn't on my periods. There are better birth controls. The side effects are not worth it.

15, 1, Horrible Periods_ Prevent Pregnancy,WEIGHT GAIN_ depression_ short of breath_ mood swings_ no sex drive_ headaches_ acid reflux,Thank god for this website because i didn't even know that all this crap was happening to me because of my birth control. I started taking this about half way through my traveling career where i was constantly moving and sweating so the weight gain wasn't noticible but the mood swings and depression was always there. and now that i have a desk job_ even a year after i quit moving around as much i didnt sit all day and i have successfully gained 40 pounds. I have never ever in my life been this big and its not like im 35 and my body is starting to slow down. I have been extremely depressed and had no desire to even do my hair and make up which was never an issue for me. This pill is horrible. I had to start taking prilosec because my heart burn has been so bad. I have had the worst PMS_ i was to the point last month were I felt like I was literally going nuts and i had to talk myself out of it. And even when i'm not hungry_ i'm still hungry. I just stopped taking it about 2 days ago and i found this site. I'm so done and i'm so excited to see what this pill has been doing to me.,F,26,1.5  years 1X D,2/8/2016Email,Microgestin fe 1/20

17, 4, Preventing pregnancy,I haven't been on this pill for too long_ but I have had no pregnancy scares_ sex drive fluctuates_ no acne_ pretty significant increase in appetite but no weight gain yet_ & little to no mood swings. If I miss a pill however_ I instantly have breakthrough bleeding. That is annoying_ as is my increased appetite. Other than that_ the pill seems to be working well. Lighter periods and no cramping. Which is great because I usually am bed ridden & in tears on the first day of my period every month.,,F,21,3  months,1/14/2016,Microgestin fe 1/20
18, 5, Regulate period,,"I was given microgestin to help regulate my periods. I've read horror stories surrounding this particular drug and I was very worried. I take it at night before I go to bed and I have experienced no ill effects. The only ""side effect"" I've experienced is an extremely heightened sex drive. Which is unfortunate considering I'm single. Oh well.",F,22,2  months,1/7/2016,Microgestin fe 1/20
19, 4, Birth control,I am not normally a reviewer_ but I was so nervous about weight gain and side effects before going on bc that I wanted to get my experience out there. I have experienced no weight gain whatsoever_  no mood swings_  no breakouts_ no fatigue. Also this bc has made my periods light and I've had no cramping issues. It's been great. Just wanted to get some positive affirmation out there,,F,25,3  months,12/8/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20
20, 2, Hormonal control,Weight gain_ decreased libido_ acne_ breast growth,I started taking this birth control due to mild breakthrough bleeding. Here's the thing: microgestin did help with that_ but the weight gain is really problematic for me. The first month with this pill was hell. My chest grew overnight_ leaving me with stretch marks and a need to purchase bras a cup size larger. My moods swung between anger and extreme sadness_ I broke out (which almost never happened before)_ I gained about five pounds_ and my breakthrough bleeding got worse. Things started to stabilize about a month and a half in. My moods returned to normal_ and the pill actually helped with my premenstrual sadness. The breakthrough bleeding stopped. The acne and the weight problem got worse though. I am working out now more than I ever did before the pill and I'm eating healthy foods. I've started cutting out inflammatory foods like dairy and sweets. The weight just keeps piling on and I can't seem to stop it. I gave this pill a decent chance_ but after four months_ I think I'm going to finish out this round and stop.,F,18,4  months1 mg,12/3/2015Email,Microgestin fe 1/20
21, 3, To regulate periods,Bloating...gas...unrelenting nausea...and yet_ happiness.,"I feel very strange on this pill. I can't say that I completely hate it. The side effects are 100% digestive/GI related. Stomachaches all day long. Someone said it feels like being pregnant with no baby. I second that_ and would like to add ""like you just ate Thanksgiving dinner_ but you haven't."" I feel way happier and balanced emotionally_ which is the reason I'm hanging in there.",F,39,3  months20 mg,10/26/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20
22, 3, Regulate cycle,High blood pressure,I was put on the pill to regulate my cycle while taking iron pills to overcome anemia. During week 2 of my second pack_ I noticed a spike in my blood pressure. My BP was usually within normal range and would elevate to 130's/80's temporarily on high stress work days. However_ my blood pressure has been all over the place for the last week with the highest being 173/113 which caused me to go to the ER. My BP came down on its own while I was there but it hasn't been stable. Of course I've stopped taking the pill and I'm hoping my BP will go hack to normal without me having to take meds. By the way_ I had no symptoms to indicate my BP was high. I just happened to check it. As for my cycle_ there was no change the first month_ but my second cycle was a lot less painful_ shorter_ and lighter. I'd rather deal with uncomfortable cycles than suffer with the side effects if these pills.,F,40,2  days,10/12/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20
23, 5, Headaches/BC/Acne,A little bit of nausea.,I guess that every woman has its own reaction to this and any other pill. For me it has been a blessing. My period got much lighter. My face is clearing up. Headaches almos gone... My previous pill was just not working for me. The headaches and loss of focus were unbearable. This pill is just perfect for me.

25, 1, Regulate heavy periods and pms,"Took a break for a year from Seasonique_ had been on that for years_ only side effect was low sex drive. I've been on Microgestin for 3 1/2 weeks and my life is hell. Nausea all day (I take pill at night) to point of vomiting_ no energy_ terrible cramps (so bad they wake me up out of a dead slumber)_ heavy bleeding with clumps_ night sweats_ no interest in life_ exhausted_ breasts sore_ ""out of sorts"" emotionally.

27, 2, Pregnancy Prevention,Anxiety_ brain fog/trouble focusing_ mood swings_ fatigue_ flushing of my face_ breast tenderness_ severe abdominal bloating_ burping and gas_ constant nausea_ loss of appetite due to nausea_ unpredictable period,I took BC pills for 10+ years without any issues.  Tried an IUD and wasn't happy with it.  So_ back to pills.  Unfortunately_ my experience with Microgestin has been terrible.  Currently in the 3rd week of my 3rd pack.  The side effects have progressively gotten worse.  I told myself I'd finish this pack_ but I really just want to stop taking them.  I haven't missed any pills_ and take them at the same time every night.  Last month I started bleeding two weeks early while on vacation.  (Is this my period?  Do I keep taking the pills?  Should I be starting a new pack?)  The combination of emotional_ mental_ and physical symptoms is really unnerving.  My overly-anxious mind has me half convinced the physical side effects could be pregnancy symptoms. Also_ it occurred to me last night that I've lost a lot of hair over the last few weeks -- way more than normal.  I can't really attribute the loss to any other changes.,F,35,3  months 1X D,9/1/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20

I was on orth tri cyclin lo before this bc and I'm going back on that... I never experienced so much breakthrough bleeding before_ and that's all my period consisted of...I had a regular period and This pill screwed everything up!!  And the bloating was ridiculous! I've never felt so fat in my life. Also this pill makes it harder to lose weight.  I just felt so different after taking it_ the mood swings and bursts of anger and crying.  It's like you're pregnant again without having a baby! In my experience it's the worst pill to take!,F,31,2  months,8/22/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20
29, 5, Underweight with irregular periods,My favorite birth control ever! I love Microgestin because it makes me absolutely ravenous and helps me to eat eat eat and maintain a healthy weight. It also helps clear up my skin and gives my breasts a lot more volume. Back on it for about four months now and I've always noticed that they inflate right around the end of the third month_ but start getting really really really sore around the 2nd month of use. It also makes my periods incredibly light and I'll stop having them eventually. I've tried depo_ otcl_ estrostep_ micronor_ and I always come back to this one.,,F,27,5  years 1X D,8/21/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20
30, 1, to prevent pregnancy,WEIGHT GAIN_ depression_ never wanting to do anything.,avoid taking this. please. i thought it was just me being a pig because I am one of those people that think birth control can't actually make people fat. It made me think about food twice as much as i usually do. I switched over to levora and i began to feel happier and lost weight. I even confirmed it was the microgestin when i accidentally took the extra microgestin for a month again_ because i ran out of levora and wasnt paying attention.

31, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Severe bloating_ painful gas_ weight gain_ upper abdominal pain_ no sex drive_ clitoral discomfort,I've never had children and can't and shouldn't have them_ many reasons_ mainly my own health_ pregnancy would most likely result in my death. I haven't been on birth control pills for years_ was in a relationship with a woman for a long time so didn't need them. Met my current male significant other so started condoms and birth control pills. The last two weeks have been hell. I can't work comfortably_ I never want to eat_ all my clothes feel tight because I feel like a balloon and I know I've gained about 6-9 pounds the last two weeks. My anxiety is sky high_ completely out of control. I'm a diagnosed depressive so no real change there. The pain though is really killing me. It's uncomfortable to do anything. I wish I had found this site earlier_ definitely asking my dr for a switch to something else. Would use an IUD but my cervix is too small. Plus I never want to have sex because I feel too bad_ which kind of defeats the point of the pill. Can't achieve orgasm at all. I'll continue taking them until I can switch to something else_ hopefully this week. I have taken 13 pills_ and was taking them at 11pm consistently every night.,F,29,2  weeks1/20,8/15/2015Email,Microgestin fe 1/20
32, 1, hormone control,Breast tenderness and swelling_ cramps_ increased breakthrough bleeding_ headaches_ acid reflux_ mood swings_ extreme fatigue_ decreased libido_ acne_ bloating,This is terrible. I started taking this due to having occasional breakthrough bleeding_ but I would much rather have that than all of these other side effects. I become irrationally angry_ then start crying. My chest grew literally overnight (and I have the stretch marks to prove it) and it is painful every day. I am tired all the time; I can sleep for nine hours and have to take an hour nap later in the day. To top things off_ it made my breakthrough bleeding problem much worse. I have never had acid reflux or such acne_ cramps_ and bloating in my life before this pill. I am stopping immediately. I absolutely_ vehemently_ do not recommend.,F,18,12  days1mg/20mcg 1X D,8/12/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20
33, 5, Birth Control,"Very light/No period.After being on this medication for more that a year I stopped having a ""normal"" 5 day flow and it kept getting lighter after that to the point where I don't even have my period only some spotting for a day or two while on the placebo. After taking a few pregnancy test (negative each time btw) and talking with my doctor I found out this is very common for women taking microgestin.",Previously_ I was on an extended cycle birth control (Seasonique). I really liked not having my period for three months but it did not agree with my body at all. My doctor suggested Microgestin and gave a few samples. I noticed a difference right away. With this pill I did not have any side effects and my body seemed to really like the lower dose hormones. I have always had hormonal cystic acne since I was young and it did not seem to change much when I started taking the pill in my 20's_ but since I have been on Microgestin my acne has gone away completely which has really increased my confidence. I think I found the right birth control for my body.,F,32,2  years 1X D,7/16/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20

I had been feeling real tired lately_ like don't want to function tired and I couldn't understand why.  I looked at these reviews and realized it was my pill.  I've been bloated the entire time and gassy. I'm pretty sure it raised my blood pressure. I've been super moody and everything annoys me.

This pill is horrible.  I've been on bc before but its never completely killed my sex drive like this has.,F,27,2  months,5/23/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20

After about one year of being on no pill_ I went to see my new doctor and she prescribed me this (even though I had requested Orth Tri Cyclen).  I guess I didn't realize how different one birth control pills can be from another.   After about one week of taking this_ I was horribly depressed...every single day_ I woke up and wanted to do nothing but cry.  I felt like I was completely out of control with my emotions...suicidal at times.  Not to mention my lack of patience that came into play...like PMS times one thousand.  I became a super-bitch and knew something was not right.  I would never ever recommend this pill for anyone.   Definitely made me feel the terrible!,F,25,1  months,5/3/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20

The only thing that I could think of was it being the Microgestin. Once I started looking up people's reviews and read their experiences with it _ I knew for a fact this is the cause of it. I have had the most random crying spells every day no matter where I am or what I'm doing. They're uncontrollable. Also makes me feel so nauseous. I would rather deal with my cramps than this!!!

I take it at night and I get sooooooo nauseous_ right before I take in and hours after I take it. Its terrible! I even get a little sick in the morning. When I first started I gained about 10lbs within 2 months and Ive been the same weight consistently for 5 years. The food cravings are new but I feel like every week there's a random food that I NEED to have. The bloating & gas are probably the worse. My stomach always looks huge and is always making gassy noises its so embarrassing! Like a lot of people have said the crying out of nowhere... And my breast look and feel a bit more full. I describe being on this pill like being pregnant with no baby. The best thing about this pill which is the only reason I haven't come off it is I used to have TERRIBLE cramps and heavy periods. Now I don't have cramps at all_ like magic_ and my periods are very light.,F,20,1.5  years 1X D,3/23/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20

They ended up taking me off Microgestin after two IVs and an ultrasound ruling out any other issues.Other symptoms include weight gain_ nausea_ dizziness_ heartburn_ red skin blotches and the most horrible mood swings.

I was young when I started (16) and looking back the past 5 years I feel like it's made me an emotional wreck. I have 2 weeks left and then I'm done for good. I'm excited to see if all the side effects I'm having are really related to this birth control. The worse part is the depression. It's been on and off. It's not worth it anymore. I'll find other means of birth control. Ones that don't mess me up emotionally.,F,21,5  years 1X D,2/10/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20

Makes me crave food_ severe gas and bloating_ minor acne_ increases stress_ helps with my depression mildly_ feel very lazy/tried_ but cannot fall asleep_ body temp way higher than normal_ wake up in the middle of the night from being too hot,Not sure if i want to continue taking this. I cannot deal with the acid reflux with no matter what I eat_ gf breads_ fruits_ veggies_ it is endless. Now the need for food is good_because of also taking adderall_ which leaves me with no appetite. however_ the bloating and gassy feeling which is constant throughout the day is very unsettling and makes me feel like I have gained too much weight. I do not have a scale so I cannot measure anything.,F,20,3  weeks 1X D,1/22/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20

I got off of it for 2 months b.c I was just being a cheap-O at the time and didnt wanna pay 20 a month for it but  i switched to Tri Sprintec or w.e its called & was cramping everyday & having only a week break for my period. So I decided to go back to microgestin & immediately the day I took it my cycle stopped. light cramping but thats normal & my boobs are a little sore but overall i love it & i know itll put a stop to my cycle just as it did last time so im satisfied. Im hoping it makes my breasts more full again too lol but yes great pill. i will always take it as long as i can.,,M,23,3  months 1X D,1/8/2015,Microgestin fe 1/20

It was my first type of birth control and had a great experience with it. I usually skipped my placebo pills and went straight to a new pack. I never had any problems with it. Just recently started a different type which wasn't my choice so I'm a little worried. I wish I could have just stayed with this one. Will definitely go back if I have the chance.

Also_ no sex drive. What. So. Ever. I'm grateful it's preventing me from getting pregnant_ but I feel like it's not worth it. It's like being pregnant without the baby. I told my doctor about these problems and she said to take vitamins_ and I have been. It hasn't helped. I exercise and eat fairly well. She told me to wait til I've been on it for 3 months but it's so bad I don't know if I can take it anymore..,,F,18,2  months,12/2/2014,Microgestin fe 1/20
55, 3, Prevent Pregnancy,Breakthru bleeding then little to no periodMigraine/tension headaches (daily)Elevated blood pressureUneven termperment,After coming off depo provera_ which caused breakthru bleeding and headaches_ my OB recommended Microgestin to help with the bleeding. The bleeding continued for 2-3 months. Then suddenly I barely bled. I actually thought this was a great side effect. Then just as suddenly_ I got the worse headache. After the initial onset_ the headache mellowed out. However_ it has continued for almost a month now. I went to the doctor who was convinced it was my BCP causing the headaches and giving me high blood pressure. I have been off microgestin for about a week and feel a bit better but headaches still occur sporadically each day. I guess that's better than lasting the whole day :( I also found the oddest thing would set me off and I would scream at my husband or kids for nothing. I will be so happy to be normal again!,F,39,6  months,11/19/2014,Microgestin fe 1/20

We put it down to just having a bad day_ but it kept getting worse. Yesterday I almost lost my mind because a bag of potato chips wouldn't fold down the way I wanted_ and today I started crying hysterically that this wildly rational side of me meant that there must be something wrong. The only thing that was different was this birth control and after reading all these reviews online it all makes sense.

I didn't have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.  So I am curious as to what caused my stroke.  After I had the stroke_ doctors told me that you should give your body a rest  from birth control pills.  Unfortunately_ I found out too late.

72, 1, Prevent Pregnancy/Adult Acne,BLOATING_ Weight gain_migraines_ rage_ emotional_ spotting_ breakouts_ yeast infections. Heart burn _ bigger breast.,I was put on this particular form of birth control once I switched to home pharmacy through my insurance and they did not carry my original perception. Initially I didn't think anything of it as I had been on BC for over a year already and knew there would be some side effect associated with switching brands but I did not expect all of what I have been experiencing. One I have been on a strict healthy eating plan and workout regimen for almost a month now. I have only lost 3 lbs and my stomach is still enormous compared to any time in my life including right after I had my son who is now 6. In all (about a year total on BC I've gain almost 20lbs) I kept wondering why this was happening and it didn't hit me until I realized that since I started taking this pill in particular I have been spotting in between cycle (usual the second week of the pack) which obviously is causing most of the bloating but in general I have the bloating which is extremely uncomfy all the time and causing heart burn because my stomach seems to always be so full no matter what. I bought new bras about a month ago and thought hmmm these don't fit them same although they are the same size I have been wearing for the past 6 years even going up and down in weight my breast normally never get bigger if I gain weight.

Microgestin was suggested to me after several horrible experiences with other BC pills that caused severe mood swings_ nausea_ etc. Microgestin was easy peasy in comparison--maybe some slight nausea occasionally and a little PMS-type crying_ but it paled in comparison to other pills and was a God send considering how bad my periods were.,I take Microgestin 3 months consecutively so I only get 4 periods per year. My periods had suddenly gotten so bad that I would get fevers every month_ crippled in pain_ couldn't keep down food/water_ and I'd have to spend 3 days a month in the hospital. I was skeptical Microgestin would help_ but it has truly changed my life! My periods instantly were shortened and lightened--maybe 3 days. Cramping is so minimal that I typically won't take anything for it at all (as opposed to needing IV drugs in the ER). No more fevers_ no nausea_ no more losing a week or more of my life each month being sick with horrible PMS gastrointestinal symptoms. I can't say enough how much I love this drug. I honestly feel like the luckiest girl in the world to have found it. It's truly changed my life. You just have to stick it out through the first couple months until your periods are stable and go up on dosing if you start experiencing spotting. This is one of the lowest-dose BC pills around_ so it may not be strong enough for all.,F,26,4  years 1X D,5/25/2011,Microgestin fe 1/20
105, 4, To stop 2 months of heavy bleeding,Constant spotting in first month (this has stopped). Depression and fits of crying_ I thought I was going crazy. Luckily this stopped in the 3rd month. Weight gain in stomach even though I am loosing elsewhere due to diet and exercise. Nausea can occur when taking the pill without food or too late at night. No more migraines!!,After bleeding heavily for over 2 months the pill was one of my best options to stop it. Which it did. I have never had a regular period before so the spotting never bothered me. The mood swings and crying fits were completely foreign and scary. This did not stop until the 3rd month and now I am back to myself. The biggest tip I can give is to take this at the same time every day!! I only experience bad side effects when I do not take it at the same time of day. Luckily my body reminds me within a couple hours if I did not take it at my usual time.,F,28,3  months20 1X D,5/16/2011,Microgestin fe 1/20
106, 5, Pregnancy prevention,None.,I've been taking this BC for 5 years without any side effects. When I started taking it it was like I never did. My periods became lighter and last about 3 days. I have no complaints.,F,21,5  yearsDunno 1/20 1X D,2/16/2011,Microgestin fe 1/20
107, 4, Birth Control,Extreme nausea at first and loss of appetite. Initial weight loss_ but now everything is back to normal. Very very emotional though_ cry at the drop of a hat. Still get nauseous once in a while. But it regulated my period like magic!,,F,27,2  months 1X D,9/20/2010,Microgestin fe 1/20
108, 4, Reduce perimenopause effects,None whatsoever ... I was nervous at first since my Dr prescribed the Brand drug_ Loestrin FE ... That was not covered under my plan_ so I had to switch.,After 6 months_ I contacted my mail order pharmacy (MEDCO) and they switched my prescription to Gildess FE (unbeknownst to me). Now I have to either go on that_ or get my doc to send in another prescription that specifies do not substitute.,F,45,7  months20 1X D,8/20/2010,Microgestin fe 1/20
109, 2, Birth Control_ Yeast Prevention,Yeast infections_ depression.,I tried this pill because I am prone to yeast infections_ and my Dr. thought that this pill would be a good one for me to try to remedy it.  For side effects_ the yeast infections did not subside_ and I became QUITE depressed and emotional while on this pill.,F,26,  1X D,7/22/2010,Microgestin fe 1/20
