0, 3, Seasonal allergies,This seemed to work great at first with no immediate side effects however after several months I noticed I was slowly gaining weight. I blew it off as something I was doing and not the spray but I went off it for a week and lost several lbs. Again I tried to tell myself it couldn't be the spray so I went back on it_ gained evend more weight so I finally stopped using it for several weeks now and again have lost 4 lbs. In total I gained about 8. I know not earth shattering but to me it isn't worth it. Has anyone else gained weight from this spray?,,F,40,2  years2 sprays,2/18/2016Email,Patanase
