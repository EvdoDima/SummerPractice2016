0, 1, ,Chronic diarrhea - for 2.5 years since taking Humatin,I took it for an amoebic infection and it caused chronic diarrhea - this despite taking probiotics before_ during_ and after treatment. In short_ the drug made me worse rather than better_ and the bad effects WILL NOT GO AWAY,M,52,10  days,10/25/2009,Humatin
1, 5, Entameba histolytica,"I had absolutely no side effects since I was eating 250ml of yogurt containing live bacterial cultures_ 3 times a day in between medication dose. Those who complained about the diarrhea are evidently incognitive of the fact that this antibiotic_ just like many others_ kills not only the bad microorganism_ but also the good ones in your GI tract. Hence_ replenishing ""good"" GI bacteria with yogurt that contains active bacterial cultures seems fairly logical.",This is an extremely powerful antibiotic that completely eradicates entameba histolytica infection.,M,33,7  days,8/18/2009,Humatin
2, 1, Intestinal parasites,4 months later I still have liquid diarrhea and problems that started when I began the paromomycin. A disaster. Beware.,I had high hopes that this and flagyl would clear up my problems_ but this just added to it.,M,,10  days,12/16/2007,Humatin
3, 1, Intestinal parasites,It caused ongoing liquid diarrhea which is still a problem 10 days after the end of treatment,This was supposed to help my bowel problem_ not make it worse.,M,50,7  days,8/28/2007,Humatin
