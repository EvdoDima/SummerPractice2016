4, 4, bipolar type 1,mild side effects such as cold extremities and shakiness on higher doses.,Lithium was the medication I needed. for me it has low side effects and the dosage just has to be adjusted just right. my special number is 900mg. taken with lamictal it works incredibly well to treat my mania and mood swings.,M,43,7  years900mg 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Lithium carbonate

7, 4, Bipolar II and OCD,slightly increased acne_ dryness_ mild tremors--all minor,"Lithium was added as a second mood stabilizer_ in addition to Lamictal_ to control my BPII. I take a smaller than normal dose_ as minimum therapeutic is 900mg usually--but success with Li is gauged by blood level testing every so often_ and I'm within range. For me_ Li has been more of a ""calm down"" addition_ whereas I find Lamictal activating. The two work well together. I still have some racing thoughts_ which my dr. says could be helped if I upped my dose; but I'd really rather minimize the amount of meds I take_ keep it all as low as possible. I'm calmer on Li for sure and feel better having my moods stable_ while still having a personality and emotions. It does not help my OCD_ but we knew it probably wouldn't. At least BPII settled is a success. Good med overall. Minimal side effects: tremors were heavier and scary at first_ but are almost totally gone. I also never gained weight. I actually lost some (coincidental maybe). I'll probably be on Lithium for a long time.",F,34,7  months750 1X D,2/19/2016,Lithium carbonate

After this_ depression instensified to a terribly low melancholic state with anhedonia.  Doctor had me immediately go off lithium_ side effects lasted 3+ weeks_ even though lithium leaves your body after 5 days.

13, 1, Clinical Depression / suicidal,I've been on 800 mg of Lithium_ 45 mg of Mirtazapine and 150 mg of pre gabalin twice a day.  Just recently I have had unbearable hunger pangs continuously.  My stomach won't stop gurgling.  My psychiatrist told me it was the interaction between the lithium and mirtazapine.  She is taking me off the lithium.  So have just gone down to 600 mg of lithium for three weeks_ and then down to 400 mg for three weeks_ and then 200 mg for three.  Lithium didn't work for me.  Wouldn't dream of going back on it...too toxic for the stomach.  I'll take clinical depression over hunger pangs 24/7.,Do your research_ but be aware that only about 50% of people have a positive response to this drug.  It is not for everyone.,M,51,4  months800mg,11/5/2015,Lithium carbonate
14, 5, Bipolar Disorder,In the beginning_ I experienced fogginess_ fatigue_ and blurred vision.,"I absolutely love Lithium. I'm enjoying the ""quiet brain"" effect and my ability to slow down and make reasonable decisions based off of logic instead of emotion.

20, 2, Mood stabilizer,More thirsty than usual and urinated a lot more frequently_ especially when first taking the drug.  Some bloating in the abdominal area.,I did not experience too many unpleasant side effects from this medication.  It did not make me gain weight_ which was something I worried about after reading others' reviews of the drug.  Unfortunately_ it did not help stabilize my moods.  Increasing the dosage only seemed to make me angrier and more impulsive.  You do have to watch the amount of salt you eat.  If you suddenly increase or decrease your salt intake by a significant amount_ it effects your lithium level_ which can counteract the efficiency of the drug at best or be toxic at worst.  It's also a good idea to be careful with alcohol as it seemed to make it way too easy for me to end up being black-out drunk.,F,38,90  days300 mg 3X D,7/5/2015Email,Lithium carbonate

It did nothing for my bipolar at all_ no change in moods_ in fact my family said I seemed to be twice as irritable and snappy while on Lithium than I was before. I couldn't notice it_ but everyone around me did. Extreme weight gain_ I was gaining about 11 pounds per month which is not cool. With my metabolism_ it's extremely hard for me to lose weight unless I starve myself and gaining it is easy as cake_ plus heart problems run in my family so the last thing I need is a medicine that doesn't work but makes me fat and unhealthy.

31, 5, Bipolar 1,Possible Bruxism. My complexion has actually cleared up and I've lost weight since starting lithium_ as a side effect of stability_ not lithium!,I feel like this is what normal (non bipolar) people must feel like! I've been working so hard for so long to keep it together on my own_ without medication_ but have only just kept my head above water. Stability is so new to me and I can't beleive how much easier being healthy and functional is! The last time I was on meds it wasn't very successful_ I hated the anti psychotics like seroquel and wasn't taking the best care of myself. Now I feel like I am stable and can continue on with my life without constantly struggling to just function when I'm depressed and not look like I'm on meth when I'm manic. Lithium is a great_ tried and true drug in my book. Just drink plenty of water and get your labs done often. We know the risks of this drug over time_ we don't with the others like abilify. Keep that in mind and do your research! Do not rely on your psychiatrist to make the best decisions for you.

Since I'm taking Prozac for the same reasons_ I can't really tell what med is curing what. Since I can't tell_ I'm just gonna say it works pretty good.

68, 5, Type II Bipolar Disorder,Hand twitches 12 hours from time of dose (If I'm using a calculator_ I'll hit a button twice by accident).  I take it at night_ and the problem is gone by noon.  Caffeine really exacerbates the hand tremors.  I once thought it would be a good idea to drink a big coffee before an exam and my hand was shaking so bad that I couldn't write.  I take this with 1500mg Trileptal and 400mg of Lamictal and I take them all before bed.  They do make me very tired_ but by the time I wake up I have no other side effects.,"Lithium was the ""game changer"" when my doctor and I were working on an appropriate ""cocktail"" for me.  It won't be a sudden change_ where all of a sudden you feel great.  The only noticeable change I could observe myself is the obsessive suicidal thinking toned down significantly.  After 2 years of treatment_ I still don't ""feel"" like the drugs work.  I think It's sort of like if you look in the mirror every day_ you wont really notice you gained 10 lbs.  However_ my friends and family have noticed a significant change in my mood and attitude (they don't look in the metaphorical mirror every day).  I have also been able to successfully stay in school and hold down a job which was impossible 2 years ago.  Even though I don't ""feel"" different_ my life has changed for the better.  Everybody is different chemically_ and lithium may not be for everybody_ but don't write it off just because you don't ""feel"" a change.  Give it some time first.",M,27,2  years1500 1X D,4/29/2013,Lithium carbonate

I was diagnosed with manic depressive paranoia disorder and he suggested that I start taking Lithium Carbonate.  He started me at 600mg a day and then upped it to 1200mg a day (extended release tablets).  He also put me on Seroquel (200 mg a day) to help me sleep and to act as a piggyback drug to the Lithium.  My side effects have been odd and they fluctuate.  I'll go a week feeling like the meds are having zero effects.  Then I'll have a week of bad hand trembling with the taste in my mouth.  Then I'll have a week where I'm nearly comatose (driving is really fun then).  Then I'll have a week where I'm feeling all of them_ etc.  The meds do feel like they have leveled me out (most days)_ but reading all of the various internet pages talking about how bad it is really has me wondering about it.,M,39,2  months600mg 2X D,1/14/2013Email,Lithium carbonate

Embarassing when paying at stores_ the money exchange is very awkward.  I feel like I should disclaim to clerks why I am shaking so bad_ but what do I say?  ""btw_ I am shaking like this because I was put into the psych hospital for 10 days as I was suicidal and having a bipolar episode_ and my borderline almost got me killed in a road rage incident....""  Yeah_ that would help alot...","This medicine is apparently dangerous.  I would think_ anytime a medication regiment that required that ""lithium levels"" be checked_ you are not taking something that's necessarily great for you.  The psychiatrist in the hospital told me ""Well_ the ""SIDE"" effects happen_ before the ""GOOD"" effects do""...  BS!  I cannot function like this.  I quit taking it_ now I am seeing that quitting cold turkey acts as an antagonist to perpetuate the side effects even worse.  So_ now I'm shaking all over my body.  I wish I knew when this would stop - I know I have mental problems so this is likely a statement in redundance_ but ""I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY!""  DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!!!

My only side effects are a fine hand tremor_ which turns into an intentional tremor when trying to do something like tweezing eyebrows - so very close-up work.  I do get thirsty_ but honestly_ I don't think it's any more pronounced than before I started on Lithium. Contrary to popular mythology_ you do not have to ""push"" fluids for fear of getting kidney damage. My psychiatrist said_ ""drink to your thirst""- that by drinking fluids when I was thirsty_ that I would be giving my body ample fluids.  Blood draws are no big deal - once the dose has been adjusted and a level checked for therapeutic range - I only have to go every six months for a lithium level. I have no edema_ and I actually lost 11 pounds because I feel so much better and therefore am more active.  Lithium in no way_ increases my appetite (unlike Seroquel).

I am not comfortable with the idea of changing my brain.  I just want to be comfortable in my skin.The doctor should be monitoring the lithium levels in your blood.

When I take Lithium I feel like myself.  if you get a lot of side effects_ lower the dose.  your lithium levels should be checked by a lab to keep you in range.  if you have a good doctor_ they should prescribe thyroid and kidney tests to be done by a lab routinely.  If you do this_ then you should be able to catch problems early.  this drug MAKES THE DIFFERENCE for me....,F,29,1  years,7/20/2009,Lithium carbonate

Ironically_ I had fewer side effects from the generic lithium carbonate than from the Lithobid_ which made me see double. I don't take this med all the time_ though. I fear the long term liver damage it may cause as well as the possibility that it can lead to hypothyroidism. My maintenance regimen therefore does not include Lithium_ but it is great for a few weeeks for the recovery from mania.,When I first started taking Lithobid I had terrible_ terrible shaking. It was embarrassing. My hands shook like a Parkinson's patient's. Since them I have not had that problem. Been on and off it since 2002. I would never take it for depression_ but that's just me.,F,, ,7/3/2009,Lithium carbonate

I take 1200mg a day of lithium extended release. It has been pretty helpful for my mood episodes. I still have them but they're nowhere near as intense. I had a lot of trouble breaking through the depression and lithium seems to have done that_ although now it's more like I just don't care much about things. Maybe that's still mild depression. With lithium I feel like I'm watching the world on tv_ like I'm not really a part of it. But the worst problem is the movement disorder. It's not the fine tremor that is so common. This is a coarse tremor_ very noticable. I can stop it when I want to but it comes back as soon as I'm thinking about something else. And my head nods slightly_ all the time. It's bad enough that I don't go out much. So I would say Li is very effective but the side effects can be brutal.,F,44,1  years,6/20/2009,Lithium carbonate

If I need more ""manic"" creative energy_ or need to be proactive_ will decrease slightly for a day or two.  If become too irritable and suspicious_ will increase dosage.  Too sluggish_ will decrease dosage.  One has to learn how to recognize what is ""normal"" behavior from bipolar thoughts.  Depending on where you are in your high/low cycle you may experience depression for a day or two. I've found changing lithium levels does cause more problems than staying at same level.  While routine blood levels are needed to avoid toxicity_ I've been below the therapeutic range for years and just go based on clinical symptoms. If you want to be slow_ very dull and less reactive_ keep blood level at high normal range.  Low normal range allows more manic energy to come through.

I guess I'm fortunate in this sense. The WORST ""side effect"" is the one caused by stopping Lithium suddenly: depression_ uncontrolled anger and mania can return quickly and heavily when med is stopped quickly. When Lithium has been stopped--for whatever reason--I find I can get back on track (feeling OK again) 3-5 days after resuming this great_ naturally occurring mineral. Whatever weight gain I might have had was relatively minor and was remedied by increased excercise.","Lithium is like ""manna from heaven_"" one of God's great gifts to humankind. It can't be monopolized by any company because it's a naturally occurring mineral! I currently take it with Wellbutrin XL_ Lexapro and Lamictal (Lamictal was added 4 months ago and works great for my BP depression_ which Lithium couldn't completely take care of. See review of Lamictal for more.) The above combination is my best ""cocktail"" in more than 20 years of treatment. Most people in remission with bipolar disorder know that taking 4-5 drugs is fairly typical and often necessary to keep labile mood in check. I will sing the praises of Lithium forever.",M,49,20  years,11/15/2005,Lithium carbonate
273, 5, Bipolar I,900 mg: slight weight gain (5-8lbs)_ hand tremor_ significant hair loss (~1/3)_ tooth pain_ very rapid tooth decay (lost 2 teeth with *very* good oral hygiene)_ decreased cognitive abilities. All side effects decreased somewhat at 600mg and significantly at 450mg.,900 mg was perfect for mood stabalization_ but to get the side effects in control I had to drop the dosage and now experience mania. The episodes are very light; non descructive to my life. I am not comfortable with the mania_ and am still in search of other drugs to mix with lithium. So far_ lithium is the best. As I learn to more about my own symptoms and triggers_ I am able to adjust my dosage to help control them. I have tried 11 other drugs with unmanagable side effects. I seem to be very sensative to the medications. My side effects may seem significant to the reader_ but they are still very worth the relief of symptoms. If you haven't tried lithium and are still suffering from your illness_ I suggest you try it.,F,37,11  months,10/13/2005,Lithium carbonate
274, 5, Bipolar II,Hand tremors for first year; occasional nausea connected with dosage time (experimented with time of day to relieve feeling),"Lithium worked right from the start_ stabilizing a manic episode that had lasted nearly 18 months. I keep the dosage low enough that I'm not experiencing ""mono-mood"" but I'm always sharp enough to sense if I need to up the dose. My experience is that it's vital to commit to whatever drug works best and not to cut corners--reduce caffeine_ get more sleep_ avoid unnecesary stimuli_ etc. and try to find things you can change to help the pharmacology work_ not just blame the drug when you overload your own system. I do occasionally experience severe nausea a few times a year_ but I work to manage that by adjusting meal times and keeping in close touch with my managing doctor. It's a very small price for being able to have a full-time job_ a good measure of creativity_ and a wonderful spouse.",F,34,12  years,9/11/2005,Lithium carbonate
275, 3, Depression,Had to keep going pee and I had some side pain. I did have some problems breathing at first but after awhile went away.,I do not know if I would take this pill again_ it's ok.

277, 2, Bipolar Disorder,Dry mouth_ frequent urination_ altered taste_ weight gain_ depression.,I took this medication in the past when I actually needed it and had no problems with it.  After taking it for several years_ I was taken off of it and did quite well without it for three years.  I started seeing a new doctor and she decided to put me on it again_ despite my insistence that I didn't need it.  I wasn't even having any symptoms!  I took it anyway_ unfortunately.  It made me terribly depressed_ I gained nearly ten pounds in one week_ and I was in the bathroom so often that I felt like I was doing nothing else.  I stopped taking it and have felt much better.  It works wonders when it's necessary_ but when it's incorrectly prescribed (as it was for me this last time)_ it does more harm than good.,F,33,1  months,7/17/2005Email,Lithium carbonate
278, 5, Bi-Polar II_ Depression_ Cycling,None! Have lost a few pounds in the past few weeks (seem to have less of an appetite).,My psych and I decided to try this as a last resort - nothing else seemed to be helping. I've only been on it for 2 weeks_ but already feel so much better. It started working within a few days. I'm bipolar II_ but mostly deal with major depression_ so I wasn't sure Lithium would help. But_ it seems to assist anti-depressents (I'm on 450mg Wellbutrin and 30mg Paxil). I had tried Depakote and Lamictal in the past_ but they didn't seem to help.,M,43,2  weeks,6/26/2005Email,Lithium carbonate

281, 5, Bi-Polar II_ Manic Depression,Increased Thirst_ Increased Urination_ Makes my Psoriasis worst_ hand trumors only on high doseage,Side effects are well worth the return of controlled mood. Only with the medication can I return to work full time and avoid manic or depression episodes.  I take 600 mg twice a day.  I have not had an major episode for over 12 years.  Before the lithium_ I had 1-2 episodes per year.,M,50,12  days,4/23/2005,Lithium carbonate

This is the first thing to really work at changing the mood swings and racing thoughts. I feel like a completely different person...free...but the lack of emotions with my thoughts is weird.
