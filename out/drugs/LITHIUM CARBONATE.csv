Now after only three months I am down to 0 to 5 time a weeking thinking about it. Has helped even out my sleep as well. Very good medicine.,M,5,3  months300 1X D,5/9/2016,Lithium carbonate
4, 4, bipolar type 1,mild side effects such as cold extremities and shakiness on higher doses.,Lithium was the medication I needed. for me it has low side effects and the dosage just has to be adjusted just right. my special number is 900mg. taken with lamictal it works incredibly well to treat my mania and mood swings.,M,43,7  years900mg 1X D,3/1/2016Email,Lithium carbonate

7, 4, Bipolar II and OCD,slightly increased acne_ dryness_ mild tremors--all minor,"Lithium was added as a second mood stabilizer_ in addition to Lamictal_ to control my BPII. I take a smaller than normal dose_ as minimum therapeutic is 900mg usually--but success with Li is gauged by blood level testing every so often_ and I'm within range. For me_ Li has been more of a ""calm down"" addition_ whereas I find Lamictal activating. The two work well together. I still have some racing thoughts_ which my dr. says could be helped if I upped my dose; but I'd really rather minimize the amount of meds I take_ keep it all as low as possible. I'm calmer on Li for sure and feel better having my moods stable_ while still having a personality and emotions. It does not help my OCD_ but we knew it probably wouldn't. At least BPII settled is a success. Good med overall. Minimal side effects: tremors were heavier and scary at first_ but are almost totally gone. I also never gained weight. I actually lost some (coincidental maybe). I'll probably be on Lithium for a long time.",F,34,7  months750 1X D,2/19/2016,Lithium carbonate
8, 1, Depression augmentation,Depression_ anhedonia_ feeling extremely cold_ shivering_ insomnia_ diarrhea.,Took lithium 150 mg to augment antidepressant (which had been working_ but needed a boost to work better); after a week started to shiver severely_ felt unbearably cold in a 72 degree room.  After this_ depression instensified to a terribly low melancholic state with anhedonia.  Doctor had me immediately go off lithium_ side effects lasted 3+ weeks_ even though lithium leaves your body after 5 days.

It also is guaranteed to damage your thyroid very quickly.

13, 1, Clinical Depression / suicidal,I've been on 800 mg of Lithium_ 45 mg of Mirtazapine and 150 mg of pre gabalin twice a day.  Just recently I have had unbearable hunger pangs continuously.  My stomach won't stop gurgling.  My psychiatrist told me it was the interaction between the lithium and mirtazapine.  She is taking me off the lithium.  So have just gone down to 600 mg of lithium for three weeks_ and then down to 400 mg for three weeks_ and then 200 mg for three.  Lithium didn't work for me.  Wouldn't dream of going back on it...too toxic for the stomach.  I'll take clinical depression over hunger pangs 24/7.,Do your research_ but be aware that only about 50% of people have a positive response to this drug.  It is not for everyone.,M,51,4  months800mg,11/5/2015,Lithium carbonate
14, 5, Bipolar Disorder,In the beginning_ I experienced fogginess_ fatigue_ and blurred vision.,"I absolutely love Lithium. I'm enjoying the ""quiet brain"" effect and my ability to slow down and make reasonable decisions based off of logic instead of emotion. My mania has all but ceased and my severe depression has lifted. I've never known anything outside of a chaotic brain. Feels amazing to function as a human being.

I get hot flushes_ spells of dizziness. eye contact is a major issue_ weather that comes from low self esteem or the struggle to focus due to the lack of emotion I feel i guess I will never know! I drink a lot more in affect going to the toilet a lot more! having said all this I have not had a manic episode in 6 years have a great job and working towards and even brighter future! having read what everyone else has put i know longer feel alone.,F,22,6  years900 1X D,10/12/2015,Lithium carbonate

18, 4, BiPolar,Weight loss - I thought for sure I would gain a bunch because that's my tendency - but alas_ something good.,I like lithium - my body seems to like it too.

20, 2, Mood stabilizer,More thirsty than usual and urinated a lot more frequently_ especially when first taking the drug.  Some bloating in the abdominal area.,I did not experience too many unpleasant side effects from this medication.  It did not make me gain weight_ which was something I worried about after reading others' reviews of the drug.  Unfortunately_ it did not help stabilize my moods.  Increasing the dosage only seemed to make me angrier and more impulsive.  You do have to watch the amount of salt you eat.  If you suddenly increase or decrease your salt intake by a significant amount_ it effects your lithium level_ which can counteract the efficiency of the drug at best or be toxic at worst.  It's also a good idea to be careful with alcohol as it seemed to make it way too easy for me to end up being black-out drunk.,F,38,90  days300 mg 3X D,7/5/2015Email,Lithium carbonate

23, 1, Bipolar,Extreme weight gain_ Highly ineffective,About as ineffective as a placebo. It did nothing for my bipolar at all_ no change in moods_ in fact my family said I seemed to be twice as irritable and snappy while on Lithium than I was before. I couldn't notice it_ but everyone around me did. Extreme weight gain_ I was gaining about 11 pounds per month which is not cool. With my metabolism_ it's extremely hard for me to lose weight unless I starve myself and gaining it is easy as cake_ plus heart problems run in my family so the last thing I need is a medicine that doesn't work but makes me fat and unhealthy.

28, 4, Bipolar II,acne in weird places_ thirst_ frequent urination (wakes me up 5x a night),I consider the side effects to be minimal and don't really think about them much. Lithium is a superior mood stabilizer to Valproate for me. It completely prevents mania_ but not depression although it helps. I still require additional medications for depression_ irritability_ anxiety_ OCD and intrusive thoughts.

I felt like I was starving all the time_ but it did level out my moods and my suicidal thinking. However_ I also felt kind of dull and tired on it and I missed ""my self"" as it were.

31, 5, Bipolar 1,Possible Bruxism. My complexion has actually cleared up and I've lost weight since starting lithium_ as a side effect of stability_ not lithium!,I feel like this is what normal (non bipolar) people must feel like! I've been working so hard for so long to keep it together on my own_ without medication_ but have only just kept my head above water. Stability is so new to me and I can't beleive how much easier being healthy and functional is! The last time I was on meds it wasn't very successful_ I hated the anti psychotics like seroquel and wasn't taking the best care of myself. Now I feel like I am stable and can continue on with my life without constantly struggling to just function when I'm depressed and not look like I'm on meth when I'm manic. Lithium is a great_ tried and true drug in my book. Just drink plenty of water and get your labs done often. We know the risks of this drug over time_ we don't with the others like abilify. Keep that in mind and do your research! Do not rely on your psychiatrist to make the best decisions for you.

It did make me throw up a bit_ but that was because it was mixed with another one of my meds. It's all good now.,Um... Since I'm taking Prozac for the same reasons_ I can't really tell what med is curing what. Since I can't tell_ I'm just gonna say it works pretty good. Just try to drink a buttload of water because 1. Lithium requires you to have plenty of fluids_ and 2.

My hands and fingers move on their own now_ which is sort of weird. The headaches aren't too bad_ but I almost can't eat because of the nausea. The salty aftertaste and dehydration can be easily fixed with water. I can't work out as vigorously anymore because I feel weaker and incredibly nauseated.
