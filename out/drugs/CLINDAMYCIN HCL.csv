9, 1, Tooth infection,Within 12 hours I was suffering heart palpitations_ chest pain_ stomach and abdomen cramping and diarrhoea_ which increased in severity. My heart started to thump and then felt as if it was being rapidly turned over in my chest.  On 4th day it was missing beats every 8 seconds or so_ as confirmed on a hospital Emergency Room ECG.  Â•	Chest pains over the central sternum area.  These symptoms relating to the heart and chest caused me much concern_ as I have high blood pressure and was under the care of a Cardiologist in another city I had just moved from.Â•	My stools had a reddish tinge_ presumably from intestinal/bowel bleeding.Â•	Clamminess_ shivering_ feeling of feverÂ•	Rapid heart rate.Â•	Shortness of breath.Â•	Headaches_ behind the eyes and centre forehead.Â•	Gritty feeling in my eyes.Â•	Tremor in hands and fingers.Â•	Sudden appearance of a red rash on my lower arms.Â•	Weakness_ fatigue_ had to stay in bed almost,Our intestines have NO protection against these increasingly over-powerful drugs. Some create almost identical symptoms to poisoning_ as with Clindamycin (Neocin). I took just 4 daysÂ’ dosage of this and had to be admitted to Emergency 3 times in a week_ and experienced it raging through my intestines_ liver_ kidneys in an almost identical pattern as was caused by a redback spider bite a few years ago! Each organ it attacked gave symptoms of pain_ malfunction_ and my liver felt as if it was going to burst. I think this was the liver trying with all its might to rid my body of this drug. DEADLY. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. It is not a Penicillin_ but something entirely evil as far as I have experienced. I had this given to me by a dentist after I specifically told him I wanted only Penicillin as it has always given me safe healing throughout my 69 years of life. He deceptively Â‘triedÂ’ this Â‘new antibioticÂ’ (Clindaymycin) and told me nothing. Within 48 hours I was experiencing the worst symptoms I have ever had in my life after taking medication_ and lived in fear of it having caused clostridium dif._ which is known to have caused death. There are entire websites recording the devastating effects of this Â“medicationÂ”_ and giving details of 95% of people having been caused similar agonising symptoms_ and even being admitted to ICU with their bodies shutting down to death.

17, 2, Tooth Abcess,Dizziness_ heart burn_ and some weird central nervous system issue that kicked my butt. I actually began to dream when lying awake_ all the while experiencing very hard involuntary jerks and twitches that would cause me to start gasping for breath. I never fell asleep.  This went on for hours after taking my second dose of 150mg and finally fell asleep from exhaustion around 4 a.m.  Lost perception of reality to an extent_ almost like I was on a bad high from a recreational drug.

22, 2, Tooth Infection,SEVERE SEVERE Indescribable heartburn,I have a tooth infection & so have been having difficulties swallowing. I went to take a capsule & I felt it get caught mid way down. I took it w a great deal of water & even ate a little something to aide in it going down. About 10 minutes later_to describe it as heartburn just does not come close to explaining the excruciating pain that came_ I thought I was dying of a heart attack or that acid was coming up & out & was burning right through all the soft tissue in my throat.It has been 3 hours & after handfuls of TUMS & other Antacids_ along with gallons of water_ I am STILL in a great deal of pain. I constantly feel the need to vomit but nothing comes up_ I have just been dry heaving. It is the one of the worst things I have ever felt in my life & that's saying a lot_ it feels like I have something lodged all throughout the entire length of my esophagus down into my stomach. Been through multiple major surgeries_ several tooth abscesses_chemo for cancer_ etc.THIS was by FAR one of the worst things I have experienced. Having such a dangerous powder within a gel capsule_ one that can easily get stuck & begin to dissolve in an area of the body that it is not made to be in_ can cause severe burns & other painful issues. I have heard horrific stories in where this has caused acute harm to people. This has been going on for years_ why they have not formulated it in a different manner_ is irresponsible & careless on the part of the manu,M,38,2  days300 mgs 4X D,4/10/2016Email,Clindamycin hcl
23, 1, Tooth pain/broken tooth,Here is a FYI!!   Be careful with Clindamycin Mine got caught in my throat yesterday_ which lead to me gagging and vomiting. It exploded and the medicine got into my sinus cavity and attached to my uvula ( hangy thing in the back of your throat) which then swelled up to 5 times the normal size. Everything in my head region got burnt by the meds.  My throat_ sinus wall_ mouth_ everything.  Due to that I could not talk or breath correctly.  If I could post the pictures you would not believe it. The doctors have not seen anything like it before.  So I was given some shots and new meds to get rid of the swelling. But she said it could take days for the burnt areas in my body to get back to normal.  This was the only time in my life I was actually thinking I was going to die.  It was the worst pain ever. Have to go back to the doctors today. So now I am paying copays_  gas to go back-and-forth my doctors and who knows how many days of work I'm going to be missing.. Not to mention I can barely swallow which means I have not ate in two days.  Prior to this I got extreme diarrhea_ and headaches which I saw on the side effects that they could be possible,,F,40,8  days300 mg,4/7/2016,Clindamycin hcl

No specific side effects other than feeling like walking death.,Clindamycin took care of the infection in a similar way that chemo fights cancer.  You pay the price either way.

At first_ I developed a fever_ aches_ and chills. My fever reached 103.6 and was began to experience awful stomach pains and watery diarrhea. I went to the emergency room. An IV drip was needed for dehydration as well as strong doses of Tylenol and Motrin. It took 10 hours for fever to come down. ASK QUESTIONS WHEN TAKING THIS MEDICATION!!! I was only told to eat yogurt or take a chewable probiotic to prevent a yeast infection. I was never warned about the horrible stomach/digestive issues.

Still_ it causes significant diarrhea_ bloating and general malaise. At 150mg it did nothing_ but 450mg did the job.,This is a tough antibiotic to take_ but it did rid me of a low grade fever and knocked out a deep infection from a poorly executed root canal (3 months earlier). No headaches_ but I had a weird sense of being out of myself! But I did work and functioned_ though spent more time in front of the TV than usual.

However_ the worse was an itch rash from hell the day I ended the treatment. Neck to feet. My back was so rashy that it look like it had been sunburned. I eventually had to go get a steroid shot to control the itching.,The rash started to slowly fad after a week (on a steroid though). I'm concerned about the diarrhea and hope it's not c-diff. It's not any worse so I'm just going to keep an eye on it. Doc wanted me to take Flagyl but I just don't think I can handle another bottle of poison right now. I'll get tested for c-diff before I take something to cure it. Most people clear mild cases of c-diff on their own anyway. Bottom line: Take some else besides Clindamycin.

On Day 3/4_ my sporadic low grade fever I'd been having for 6 weeks was gone. I think I'm cured. Fingers crossed.,I took this drug after Amoxicillian failed to work. During my course of Clindamycin_ I took Jarrows saccharomyces boulardii (two mornng and one night)_ a good probiotic between antibiotic doses_ and lots of yogurt.

He told me to take Ultra  Florajen a probiotic at least 2 a day spaced as evenly as I could BETWEEN the Clinda doses. Also to eat/ drink yogurt or Keifir. I am allergic to penicillin and I had 2 accessed teeth and they thought 3 more were infected so I needed a strong anti biotic. I got so sick I could not keep even water down and the whole chest felt like it was on fire. I was unable to take the pills as scheduled_ so instead of 10 days_ I am currently on my 14 day. I reduced to 2 pills a day_ 3 when I could brave it. Still have 2 left. I am going to try and take one tonight and the last tomorrow. I saw were someone here recommended eating an apple without the skin. I had some applesauce handy. I ate that and it seems to be helping a little. DO NOT lie down for at least 1 hour after taking the Clinda! This esophageal burning is the worst. However_ I must say the terrible tooth pain is gone. My big worry  from reading everything on this site is that I am due to fly to the Smoky Mountains 1 week from today.

So far no diarrhea or heartburn_ but have been eating yogurt and started taking Florastor to help counteract the meds. I also drink a bunch of water when I take the meds and don't lay down for a while after.,I was put on this because I had a reaction to Augmentin after 2 days of using it. If not for the side effects_ I would say this drug is great_ since it does take the infection away. But there has to be something else that's not as hard on your body than this! But I do understand that for some infections only certain antibiotics will work. So if you must take this_ I do recommend eating yogurt and/or probiotic supplements.

I've been out of the hospital now for 3 days_ but still have liver and kidney toxicity which will take 2 weeks to a month to recover from.,Worst and scariest medication experience of my life.

106, 1, Treat abscess before oral surgery,Before initial consult with oral surgeon_ an abscess was developing. My dentist prescribed Clindamycin 150mg. I took it as prescribed and abscess continued to develop.  At consult ( still on 150mg ) I shared with the surgeon I didn't think it was working for me. He prescribed 300mg. Was on a week of 300mg and abscess continued to develop. Whole side of face large from swelling. I asked surgeon for a different antibiotic. Would not do it. We continued with procedure even with abscess - at doc's recommendation_ against my gut feeling. Ended up in the ER day after procedure in worst_ unimaginable pain ever. They did dilaudid iv to stop pain.,It did NOT seem to work for me at all. Abscess continued on as if I were taking nothing. The only side effect I am experiencing is a coating on my tongue that makes it feel dry. I am drinking my home cultured kefir to combat any imbalances in flora. Hoping this will help with the tongue. Wonder if anyone else felt it had no effect on treating what it was prescribed for.,F,39,2  weeks300mg 4X D,2/9/2015Email,Clindamycin hcl

109, 3, Severe Dental Infection,First couple of days on this medication caused Diarrhea but since I had been unable to consume much prior to the start of this medicine_ it wasn't that severe.  By the third day I experienced severe heartburn unlike any I have had before_ it feels like I swallowed a blowtorch. Extreme fatigue started on the 4th day and I still feel like I can sleep for a week.,Despite all the side effects_ I will have to say that this antibiotic did knock out the infection when a round of 500 mg Amoxicillin four times a day_ didn't do anything.  The infection was causing such severe pain and swelling_ so the Clindamycin did the trick_ but at a high price.,F,53,5  days300 MG 4X D,1/21/2015Email,Clindamycin hcl

Take it half an hour after RX is what I read.  There are capsule probiotics and pb8 is what I take but I'm out so taking what I mentioned earlier.  Take care,Hopefully this will take away the uti as this other RX didn't too many days suffering and can't get a decent nights sleep as I have to take it every 8 hrs with a full glass of h2o and then that keeps me up even longer.Take care and read all about it.,F,52,2  days300 mg dly,1/12/2015,Clindamycin hcl

Starting to go away about a week and a half after I finished my course of Clindamycin.,A blister somehow got infected_ and the doctor put me on this because he was afraid it was MRSA (it wasn't). I am prone to diarrhea and always got it from antibiotics as a child_ but hadn't got it from Amoxicillin as and adult.

My dentist said he could not sedate me while I have the infection or it could cause me to have a heart attack or heart stop because the infection is serious it's almost cleared up now.I have been so depressed and crying so bad over the torture I've been through from this drug.I don't rarely take medication unless I really have to and this is proven fact why!

Sting of the vaginal opening.,This is embarrassing_ I have never had such a small thing create such a huge impact on my body.  I finally googled whether Cleocin could cause the runs.  I have never had something like this in my life_ when it comes_ you have to drop everything and find a bathroom IMMEDIATELY.   My increase for fluids has like tripled! I wanted to almost just buy two smoothies at once because I knew I'd drink it too fast_ I even chugged a glass of half and half_ lol_ geese I feel like a Wild animal. I thought I was getting sick or thinking maybe I was pregnant because I kept getting nauseous.  Now I don't know if it's helping with keeping an infection away as I am yet to actually finish my cycle out and will remain taking it until I see a Dr. for questions.  However I was prescribed this as I am allergic to Penicillin_ but I would highly recommend you to avoid this medication if at all possible.,F,25,4  days300MG,11/24/2014Email,Clindamycin hcl
120, 1, dental implant,As soon as I swallowed one capsule felt as if my throat was closing up and then immediate sore throat followed by heartburn and stomach pain.   I've had reactions to drugs  before and I am allergic to ampenicillin so I became alarmed.  Went online and read all the bad reviews and that some had chest pains so I started to panic since I have a heart condition. When walking around I felt dizzy...   one guy online wrote to drink tons of water so I  drank about a gallon of water to get the drug out of my system and was afraid to lay down since I already suffer from heartburn_ colitis and gastritis. BTW for others who get the burning..try eating apple w/o the skin; the acid in apples counteracts stomach acid and helps with heartburn.  I didn't take any more of the drug and called my periodontist this morning for a more mild antibiodic I've had before. His associate who doesn't know me did the dental implant and prescribed the clindamycin.  I sat up in bed for hours waiting for other side effects and kept drinking more water and some almond milk. I also woke up this morning with a splitting headache_ and felt off all day.. I feel fortunate that I only took one capsule and didn't have a worse reaction..

I wonder why manufacturer don't banned this medication_ its seems to me that side effect clearly overweight the benefits.,,M,35,1  days300mg tid,2/6/2013,Clindamycin hcl
157, 1, tooth infection,Have I got a severe headache_ dizzy. I'm eating yogurt and drinking tons of water. Taking it at good intervals. And I have weird bowel movements. Long thin feces. I feel like I was on a rollercoaster. I have shortness of breath as well.,,F,19,10  days300 mg,1/19/2013Email,Clindamycin hcl
158, 2, Cellulitis,Explosive bowl movements _ terrible leg cramps (different than normal leg cramps  ) these were shotting pain_ and woke up with severe weird type of headache like brain was swollen. Then started to feel sinus fullness with the headache.,I'm a dentist so I have some knowledge. Just stopped right away. Did not second guess.,F,57,1  days500Mg 3X D,12/29/2012Email,Clindamycin hcl
159, 1, Tooth infection_ preparation for ro,Constantly in the bathroom_ very soft_ long (really really long) thin stools_ not diarrhea.  Can't go anywhere because I need to be close to the bathroom-gas feeling is not gas -it's bm. Stomach ache.  Was supposed to take for 10 days. I'm stopping now_ after 7 days.,This drug is no bueno.  I've eaten yogurt everyday but probably should have had it at least twice a day.  Can't take penicillin or sulfa (bactrim) drugs.  Why not z-pac or cipro?  I won't take this ever again. it's going down on my list of drug allergies.,F,44,10  days300 mg 4X D,11/2/2012Email,Clindamycin hcl
160, 5, Dental Infection,Very slight tummy problems.  Nothing major.   Softer stools_ but I took probiotcs and ate yogurt each day.  Tummy settled down after a few days of finishing the course prescribed.   I usually have every side effect known with all drugs I take_ but thankfully I've never had anything major with Clindamycin.,I've taken this drug at least 10 times in the last 5 years.  I've had a lot of dental work done and am allergic to penicillin_ so I have to take something in a different antibiotic 'family'.  I need to pre-med for any dental procedures_ so I always take Clindamycin.  I have had several infections (I'm prone to them_ through no fault of the dentist)_ and they've always started clearing up within 48 hours_ no matter how severe they were.  One infection was so bad that I had to go to the hospital.  48 hours later_ after the Clindamycin was started_ I was a LOT better.  Can't say enough good things about this medication.  I'm sorry others have not done so well with it.,F,51,7  days300 mgs 3X D,6/28/2012,Clindamycin hcl
161, 1, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS WHILE PREGNANT,My OBGYN prescribed this while I was pregnant for a yeast infection.  I was 5 days post delivery and never finished it.  But_ it already did enough damage...on my 2nd day post delivery I had contracted C. diff.  A very horrible bacterial infection.  I had uncontrollable_ nonstop diahrea for two weeks (not fun to have after a vaginal delivery).  I was hospitalized for dehydration and malnourishment.  Was then prescribed Flagyl.  It did the trick to get rid of the c. diff.     From now on I will definitely do some research on any prescription before taking it.  I thought I was going to die.,SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THIS ANTIBIOTIC BEFORE TAKING IT!!!!,F,26,14  days? 1X D,5/21/2012Email,Clindamycin hcl
162, 4, wisdom tooth extraction infection,bloating_ fatigue_ loss of taste,Developed a subperiosteal infection 3 weeks after wisdom teeth removal and was given a week's supply of clindamycin. I have also begun taking probiotics 2 hours after every dose to prevent lower intestinal problems. Since starting this medicine_ I have been carrying a tremendous amount of water weight (+3 pounds) and have been sleeping 14+ hours a day_ which has not alleviated my fatigue and loss of concentration-- pretty unusual for me_ as I am normally very active and alert. However_ my infection seems to be disappearing-- the swelling and pain have both subsided. For those starting this medicine_ I recommend a hefty dose of sleep and probiotics-- good luck!,F,20,5  days300 mg 3X D,4/10/2012Email,Clindamycin hcl
163, 1, dental infection,Severe headache. Felt like my head was in a vice. Couldnt function. After once dose! Stopped immediately.,,F,60,1  days500mg 3X D,12/4/2011,Clindamycin hcl
164, 4, infection after wisdom extraction,Metallic taste and increased bowel movements but not diarhea.  I had a minor rash develop on the 10th day of taking this medication.  I also took probiotics 2 to 3 hours after taking a pill and continued to for about 6 weeks after I stopped taking this medication.  C-difficle is not present in everybody's gut. I think only a minority of people have c-dificile naturally present in their gut.  It's in those who already have c-difficile in their gut that are prone to a c-difficile infection from this medication.  I drank down about 4 glasses of water with each pill so did not experience any heartburn and I sat up for about an hour after taking each pill.,I was floxxed 3 years prior from Cipro so was almost hysterical that I had to take 10 days of Clindamycin.  I had some of the same reactions I had to Cipro(burning skin_ nerve pain_ insomnia_ muscle pain)  That is probably only because I had been floxxed previously by Cipro.  They were way way less intense and they went away within about 1 week of stopping this medication in comparism to almost 6 months after I took Cipro....yeah_ not fun!,F,45,10  days300 mgs 4X D,11/11/2011,Clindamycin hcl
165, 1, Removal of wisdom teeth,Developed severe C difficile infection at age 18 after having my wisdom teeth removed_ I was in the hospital for one week. 10 years later I have had C diff. one more time. I will never recommend this drug to anyone. It has ruined my life. I have permanent IBS and stomach problems now because of it.,,F,24,2  days 3X D,12/14/2010,Clindamycin hcl
166, 5, peridontal infection,metallic taste in mouth,10 days of taking Augmentin every 8 hrs. did not clear up my dental infection_ so I was prescribed Clindamycin. I was anxious about taking such a powerful drug_ especially after reading the comments of this site. Good News folks...I had no side effects or gastro-intestinal issues. The drug eliminated my serious infection - a miracle in my opinion. I always took the dose with food_ spaced the doses as far possible_ and drank a cup of Kefir liquid yogurt once or twice a day. The week following my last dose I drank 2 cups of Kefir daily. A month has passed since then and I am healthy and suffered no ill effects from the antibiotic. Good Luck to all...hope my experience helps.,F,58,7  days300 mg. 3X D,10/25/2010,Clindamycin hcl
167, 1, Wisdom teeth removal,None other than the typical antibiotic side effects_ which is basically just diarrhea.,I am so freaking pissed I had to take this for something as minor as preventing an infection after wisdom teeth removal.  It gave me c-diff_ which just really pisses me off.  Pharmacists need to warn you to at least take probiotics while you're on this antibiotic.,M,25,7  days 3X D,8/15/2010,Clindamycin hcl
168, 5, staph infection,None.  Expected diarrhea but took a probiotic and drank 1 Dannon Active each day.  Had no problems.  Did take exactly every 8 hours to help avoid problems.,"The moron doctor I took my son to first didn't diagnose his staph infection - so when the new doctor I took him to did diagnose the staph skin infection it was bad_ covering 3 different areas_ each about 6"" x 6""_ which is why it took 20 days of medication.  I didn't see an improvement until the 5th day_ but after that the skin infection got noticably better each day_ until it was gone.",M,11,20  days300 mg 3X D,7/9/2010,Clindamycin hcl

170, 4, Abcessed tooth,Metallic taste in my mouth_ stomach cramping_ diarrhea_,My doctor suspected an abcessed tooth because I kept having pain after getting a crown.  He gave me an extremely high dosage of this stuff and it's wrecking havoc on my stomach.  I will be glad when I'm done with this.  I can't take it much longer.  It does seem to be helping my tooth though.  For the first time in over two months I can bite down and not have any pain.,F,27, ,8/6/2008,Clindamycin hcl

173, 3, root canal treatment,Loose_ burning and frequent stool but not diarrhea.  It was as though I had eaten hot peppers the night before.  Bad taste in mouth and nothing tasted right.,"The pharmacist's notes on this medication warned ""diarrhea may occur weeks to months after taking"".  I stopped the medication 2 days ago and my system seems to be getting back to normal.  Food tastes good again.  It was difficult to gauge its effectiveness because I couldn't tell I had an infection in the first place.",F,60,7  days,3/14/2008,Clindamycin hcl
174, 4, Throat infection,nonstop bowel movements_ headaches,I cannot stress enough to take a pro-biotic with this!! If you don't you will be in serious trouble. Drink probiotic yogurt type drinks or take the probiotic in pill form. Clindamycin saved my life but it is a heavy duty drug.,F,34,10  days,1/30/2008,Clindamycin hcl
175, 4, Tooth Infection,None,After reading up on this drug on this site_ I was very nervous to begin taking the course of antibiotics.  I was fine though and I think its b/c I loaded up on Probiotics during and after the course of treatment. It was annoying b/c I felt like I was popping pills all day (probiotics are more effective if taken  2 hours after the antibiotic) but all worth it as I had none of the usual side effects.  Also_ follow the instruction and take with a full glass of water (and/or food) and don't lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking a pill.  The one time I didn't follow those instructions I felt the burning in  my esophogus.,F,35,10  days,10/31/2007,Clindamycin hcl

177, 1, tooth infection,Stay away from this drug and run from anyone that prescribes it! This drug caused chronic diarrhea that has been going on for over 10 months and that has not responded to Flagyl. Any doctor that prescribes this obviously isn't doing their homework. There are other antibiotics that are safer than this. The manufacturers should be put out of business.,,M,40,7  days,7/8/2007Email,Clindamycin hcl

I was prescribed 300mg twice daily for 7 days.  Everything was fine until day 5 when I developed watery diarrea_ my doctor sent me to the ER and they confirmed C.diff_ I am now taking Vancomycin for that (part 3 of medication my review series coming soon!)Seriously_ ask for something lighter if your doc can give it to you.

180, 1, bacterial vaginosis,Clostridium difficile- persistent diarrhea and pain_ which is very difficult to treat... because it is caused by antibiotics wiping out the natural flora in your bowels_ symptoms can be alleviated with medication_ but it is very very hard to CURE.,Clindamycin is on of the main antibiotics that causes C-diff because it is a broad spectrum antibiotic.  Ask for something else.Better yet_ don't take it unless your life depends on it.,F,40,10  days,10/3/2006,Clindamycin hcl
181, 2, bacterial infection in vagina,I got antibiotic induced colitis. I found out afterwards that Clindamycin is one of the main antibiotics that is guilty of causing clostridium difficile_ which produces toxins that cause diarrhea_ abdominal cramping_ urgency and so forth.,It cleared up the bv_ but I wish I could have taken something else_ or somehow avoided the bv. I was pregnant and I had to wait several weeks (until I got out of my 1st trimester) to start a new antibiotic to clear up the c-diff. I hated having this problem while pregnant_ because I did not gain weight and worried about the baby constantly.  This problem is more widespread than one would think. I was a very healthy young person. I just want to say don't take antibiotics (esp. Clindamycin) unless you ABSOLUTELY need them.,F,31,10  days,7/21/2006,Clindamycin hcl
