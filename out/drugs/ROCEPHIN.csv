0, 3, infected abscess,Severe pain_ bruising_ swelling,I had it injected into the glut twice a day for 5 days after a week of oral antibiotics failed. It was unbearable afterwards from repeated injection into the same area. It's recommended to alternate gluts however with the infection in the other glut it wasn't possible (infected dog bite wound). Even with getting so many injections the infection did not go away. I'm sure if it wasn't as severe that it would have worked with a shot or two.,F,25,5  days1g,8/5/2016,Rocephin
1, 4, Pneumonia,I was having HORRIBLE symptoms of fever_ fatigue_ chest pains_ and trouble breathing.  I went to urgent care and they diagnosed me with pneumonia_ and gave me the Rocephin shot in my hip_ along with a prescription for antibiotics and prednisone.  It worked quickly.,,F,17,1  days,7/30/2016,Rocephin
2, 5, Infection in bloodstream,I got the injection in my buttocks (not painful_ but did take about 5 minutes to fully inject the dosage) The burning lasted about an hour then went away leading to some soreness. For some reason the Lidocaine in it made me really high which I didn't like but I got through it. On top of 2 other antibiotics I'm feeling better than ever. Highly recommend it for an infection in the blood stream and highly recommend Cardinal Medical Center in Vista Californa! Ask for Erin_ she's amazing.,,F,19,1  daysUnsure,7/6/2016Email,Rocephin

4, 5, Uterine Infection after miscarriage,The injection did hurt quite a bit immediately_ but dulled to just soreness after about 4hours. The soreness subsided within 24 hrs,"The annoying ""pain in the butt"" is so worth it given its effectiveness. My infection decreased noticeably in just 1 Day. No stomach upset like when taken orally 1 time use_ VERY effective (and fairly cheap)",F,26,1  days,4/7/2016,Rocephin
5, 4, Severe sinus infection,Worst injection pain I've ever experienced_ and I have probably had thousands of injections in my lifetime with a chronic disease. These shots burn going in_ and cause your entire butt check to burn. Since it's a thick solution_ the needle is larger_ and they have to administer slowly_ so it seems to take forever. Pain so severe that I was limping for 30 minutes after each injection. Walking helps to dissipate the med_ and helps decrease the pain_ but it still hurts for several days after each injection.,Works SO FAST though_ that it almost makes it worth the pain! My sinuses feel so much better_ just hours after the first injection. Way faster than oral antibiotics_ and no diarrhea like the oral meds cause.,F,48,3  days 1X D,3/23/2016,Rocephin
6, 1, Staph Infection,A rash on the face that looks like tons of tiny white heads_ almost acne-like.  It appeared three days after I got Rocephin injected. Never had this medication before and the doctor is only guessing that's why I have this allergic reaction on my face.  Taking antihistamines don't seem to even touch it. It's red and sore.,,F,31,1  days 1X D,3/9/2016,Rocephin
7, 5, Strep Throat,Injection itself was not that painful. Pain at injection site (butt cheek) after injection that lasted about an hour. That was it.,My injection also included an antibiotic and I was amazed that just after four hours of getting the injection_ how much better I felt. My throat and ear pain had reduced drastically.,F,,1  days,2/21/2016,Rocephin
8, 5, Severe strep,Slight pain_ burning_ and now the spot is sensitive to the touch but what spot isn't after shoving a needle into your skin.,In addition to my side effects I would like to add that my strep was so severe the doctor even felt bad for me. I walked into the room and she looked at my throat and gasped. My tonsils and throat were so red and swollen I was gagging and choking on my own saliva. I was forcing myself to drink water because it hurt extremely bad to swallow anything. And I definitely couldn't eat anything. After getting this shot I am not able to eat certain things. And I can most definitely drink liquids with no problem now. I am extremely satisfied with this medicine. It has helped me so much!,F,23,1  days30 mg,2/19/2016Email,Rocephin

11, 1, Bronchitus,"The WORST PAIN I have ever experienced!! I have a high tolerance for pain but this was unbearable shooting pains along my back and side. I think the nurse used sterile water to mix it rather than lidocane and/or she hit a nerve when injecting. The extreme pain lasted for almost 4 hours_ and the medium pain lasted for a couple days. It felt like someone was pouring alcohol into a large open wound every minute. I was sweating_ had shortness of breath and thought I was going to pass out from the pain. I called the nurse back and asking if this was normal_ since I thought this must be an allergic reaction. And she said ""yes_ pain in the injection area is normal and lasts 1-2 hours."" I never post on boards online but this experience was so horrific that I can't imagine this drug hurting so bad and it being normal.",Received the shot at a small walk-in clinic to treat Bronchitus,F,34,1  days 1X O,12/28/2015Email,Rocephin

15, 1, bronchitis/upper respiratory infect,I received the rocephin injection in my dr's office to treat bronchitis.  By the time I got home (about 10 min)_ palms of my hands started itching and turning red_ welts started popping up on my wrists_ and my face and lips started swelling.  I had to race myself to the ER and got there shortly before passing out.  I went unconscious_ BP dropped to 52/30 and I almost died from an anaphylactic reaction to the injection.  My veins were collapsing and fluids had to be pumped into my veins so I could receive an epinephrin shot to reverse the reaction.  I spent the next 3 days in the hospital with intravenous steroids and benadryl.,I had received rocephin in the past help clear upper respiratory infections and had never had a problem with it.  Now I can not have any cephalosporins or penicillins or carbapenems.  Learning to live with this and wondering which antibiotics will be safe in the future.  I am also allergic to Sulfa.,F,63,1  daysinjection 1X O,12/10/2015,Rocephin
16, 3, Possible kidney infection/UTI,Injection was painless. I began having chills and drowsiness within two hours of injection. I also began feeling like the skin down my leg (same side as the injection in my hip) had a chemical or sun burn. There were no markings or rash or redness. The same burnt feeling began happening in my vaginal area and inside my buttocks cheeks. Five days later_ the skin inside my buttocks cheeks peeled off_ like dead skin.

20, 4, Respiratory infection ad strep,Severe headache - I am prone to migraines,Shot was not bad at all other than the fact that it took so long to inject the medicine in to me. Nurse had me lean on table and take pressure off the leg on the injection side. Felt a stick_ but that's really it. Stayed at office 20 minutes to watch for adverse effects. I'm nursing_ and I do have to dump milk for next eight hours since it passes to milk. That's the biggest downfall for the moment.,F,37,1  days,5/23/2015,Rocephin

It has been almost 3 weeks since I received it_ but a week after the injection a knot formed in my right butt cheek and is still there.

48, 5, Lyme Disease,Towards the end_ a little problem with loose stools.  Mostly alleviated by eating a lot of probiotic yogurt.  I also had an allergic rash that was localized to the arm the PICC line was in_ and my doctor was unsure whether it was really the Rocephin or perhaps (more likely because it was localized) just the blue dye in the antiseptic that was used on my arm during the procedure to insert the PICC line.,This was my miracle drug.  I'd had Lyme for over seven years before it was diagnosed_ and I was really sick when it was.  I'd started on oral antibiotics_ and they were working_ but very slowly.  So the doc had me taking Rocephin 1 gram per day via PICC line for four weeks_ and after those four weeks_ while I did switch back to oral antibiotics to finish the job (stopping Rocephin) was dictated by insurance_ not my feeling 100% better_ I felt like a new woman.  I went from having memory problems_ problems verbalizing thoughts_ feeling disconnected from reality (seriously - it was WEIRD)_ having mild encephalitis_ having photophobia_ having severe headaches_ having severe muscle pain_ and so forth_ to feeling like I had my brain and body back.  After Rocephin_ I could finally read a book and comprehend it again_ I could focus on my office job again_ my steel-trap memory was back_ the encephalitis was gone_ I regained flexibility in my muscles and joints_ and overall_ my pain went from maybe a 9.5 to a 1.,F,29,28  days,10/11/2009,Rocephin

I took 1g/day 5 days a week... 28 days total. By the day I had to get the PICC line out I was already in the hospital... I had horible pain right where my ribs come together... diaphram area. Turns out the antibiotics caused stones in my gal bladder and I had to have emergency surgery to get my gal bladder removed!!!!!,Not the first time I have taken Rocephin via a PICC line for Lyme disease. I had taken about 1 month worth about a year prior and it greatly improved my symptoms for about 9 months...
