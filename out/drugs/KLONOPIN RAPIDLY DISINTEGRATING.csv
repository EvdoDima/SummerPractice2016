4, 3, Seizures_Anxiety/Panic attacks,"Taking Klonopin 2mg. 3 times a day.  At first it helped a lot.  But i do not know if the labs. aka Big Pharma. did something to change the formulation to klonopin_  Trust it does happen to save $$ i worked for years in Pharmacy's and labs and ""People"" talk.  But any ways_ it does help with Seizures some what_ and not so much my anxiety.. I work in the medical/health field and know how your body can get used to meds. etc. But thats not the case with me  i did  several tests and my own home test to rule that out. So i am still looking for something to help my Chronic anxiety and panic attacks etc.  Now i am looking for organic/natural meds. etc. to help with my anxiety and ptsd. I would say if you want you should look into doing the same!  Klonopin made me on some days feel horrible and not myself _very scary_ some days i was ""ok""...  And i was not mixing anything etc. If you have to take it just be safe and maybe have someone with you that you trust the first time",looking for something organic/natural for my self _ found a few things that do work  .i  try not to take man made chemicals _ if you can help it! but i know sometimes you have to_ like i said i work in the medical / health field so i get it sometimes you can not avoid it.. I hear and see things from patients and other health care workers and thats why i say if you can try to find something natural try it... just trying to help..  be safe peace and love!!,F,30,7  years2mg. 3X D,5/26/2015,Klonopin rapidly disintegrating

6, 1, GAD,Increased anxiety_ horrible experience. Do not recommend the Teva version.,I got the the generic from Teva_ it wasnt covered by my insurance so I was out by $40. Normally I take two of the regular 0.5mg by Teva and they work great_ but was told these would start working much quicker. An hour later nothing happened and I felt sick later.

7, 1, Panic Disorder,Anxiety_ dizziness_ rapid heartbeat,"""NO"" about sums it up for this one. I have been on lots of other benzodiazepines and this was the only one that actually worked in the opposite way--it actually caused me to have a panic attack when I was not having one at the time I took it. 30 minutes after ingesting_ I had all the symptoms of a panic attack despite being calm when taking it. It took hours for the anxiety to wear off. None of the other meds in this class did that to me.",M,29,1  daysN/A 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Klonopin rapidly disintegrating

Very strong drug. Took for 3 months - sleep quality persisted_ appetite restored to about 70%. Relaxes all muscles like after a shower_ removes anxiety altogether_ but doesn't lift the mood at all. If you have depression as well_ you will feel no better then 3 out of 5.I tapered for a month and had no withdrawal symptoms_ except the slowed thinking which recovered for months_ but seems to me it has completly recovered ~1 year after the cessastion.,M,24,3  months1mg 1X D,6/10/2014,Klonopin rapidly disintegrating

14, 4, Bipolar Disorder_ high anxiety,Peaceful_ no manic symptoms_ depressive symptoms started to lift_ massive and life-shattering panic attacks vanished immedietly.,"I was prescribed this by a psychiatrist who was more interested in dosing me up with something to shut me up than finding a way to quell my problems stemming from living with Bipolar Disorder. After a few attempts that never worked out_ this was the medication I settled on. And from the depths of my soul_ it was worth it. I had a tiny dose and suddenly I could function as a normal human being again. The world could fall apart at my feet and I'd die with a smile on my face. I would like to clearly state that if you have an addictive personality_ you should clearly not take a benzo in the first place. I see a lot of negative reviews on here_ generally from people who claim it effected their family_ or it effected this or that and ""I got addicted"" and blah blah blah. I don't doubt it_ but perhaps you should have thought about that before taking the damn pill in the first place_ hmm? All in all_ helped my bipolar disorder on both sides of the coin_ and as an added bonus it helped my crippling anxiety.",F,19,2  years.5 MG 1X D,1/4/2013Email,Klonopin rapidly disintegrating

19, 1, anxiety_ depression_ panic attacks,I was prescribed this medication mainly for my depression_ however it seemed to have a reverse effect on me. I became so depressed that i began cutting my arm up with a knife. I had never cut myself before taking this medicine and have not done so since I stopped taking it. I believe this to be a very dangerous drug_ it scares me to see my scars and know that I could have killed myself.,My sister was also prescribed this same medication for her depression_ it was crazy because even though we were not even in the same house we both had the same reactions on the very same night. My sister also cut her wrist very badly almost killing herself.

I had a recurrence of panic attacks after not having them for 25 years. I was so dizzy I felt that I couldn't drive and function. I almost quit my job_ but my doctor tried this and it's been so much better than expected. I don't feel drugged. I take a surprisingly small dose_ just 1/8 of a mg twice a day_ but it's helped me function whereas I felt on the verge of not being able to before. I'm in cognitive therapy to deal with the anxiety_ but this drug has been the extra boost I needed to stay involved in life and not become agoraphobic or unable to drive.,F,61,4  weeks_125 mg 2X D,9/25/2010,Klonopin rapidly disintegrating

Hormonal problems. Irregular heartbeats and chest pains. Trouble breathing. Depression. Personality changes. Hellish withdrawal when you try to stop.,"This drug should be banned. It ruins lives--seriously. When you first take it_ you become a zombie and so you don't notice that's it's changing you_ wrecking your brain_ altering your personality. by the time you figure it out_ you are unwittingly addicted_ but when you try to quit you find withdrawal is the WORST TORTURE ever experienced. I spent months vomiting all day_ having panic attacks_ dizzy_ cramps_ painful ""electric"" zaps in my feet (that's from the nerve damage this junk causes_ btw). I'm no wimp--but I had to taper for 2 years to get off this stuff_ and now that I'm completely off_ I'm still having horrendous withdrawal symtoms months later. I know I sound a bit crazed_ but trust me_ there is no way to be calm in explaining just how harmful this drug (and all benzos) are.

28, 3, Depression and Anxiety,Headaches_ very tired and drousy,I'm not one for anti depressants but when I started having severe anxiety and depression I decided to take 1 0.5mgs of the generic brand of Klonopin. I felt very tired_ dizzy and had light headaches but the anxiety went away. I felt a sigh of relief (probably because I became so tired). I slept extremly well that night and the next night too. One thing I have to say is this drug is highly addictive so be extremly careful. I have never been an addict nor will I be but I believe there is some addictive chemical in this medicine just like cigerettes.

Basically_ I could hardly function for a week and a half after quitting. I would not recommend this medication as it is not worth all the side effects and is highly addictive even at low doses.Physicians need more information before prescribing these types of drugs and I would also suggest patients do their homework before starting benzodiazepines.

I'm hoping since I've stopped taking it_ the hair loss will reverse. Why didn't my doctor warn me of this side effect???? Oh yeah_ and it caused depression.,I typically took between .25 and .75 mg a day off/on for about 4 months. It did not do anything for my stress levels_ but it did knock me out at night.

35, 5, SOCIAL ANXIETY,none,Klonopin has helped me so much. Like the person above taking it for social anxiety_ I too wished I had been able (afford a doctor) to take this earlier in my life. Before I would be nervous about meeting new people_ my fork would shake when trying to eat in front of people that were not family(eventhough I was not nervous)_ I didn't go to a high school prom (i was asked) i was too shy and didn't want to have to deal with the anxiety_ same goes for dates. In college_ I would panic if the teacher just wanted me to read out of the book_ much less speak in front of the class. One time I just couldn't bare having to wait for my turn to give my opinion on a book we read_ I just got up and left. These are only a few examples of what social anxiety has done to me. It started probably in junior high and only got worse. If I had taken this earler_ my life would of been a lot easier.

36, 4, Panic attacks while flying,I began to feel the effects of slow relaxation within 20 minutes of putting the tab under my tongue_ with a deeper feeling of general slowness of movement inside of an hour_ but by then I was buckled into my seat on the plane. I was flying to another country with 12 hours in the air and took one every 4-5 hours to prevent severe flying-induced panic attacks. I slept most of the time on the flights_ which I cannot normally do. I did not really experience any grogginess or lasting effects except feeling relaxed and unstressed. Even while navigating in airports between flights I did not feel disoriented or confused or sleepy_ just relaxed. The only problem I had is when I took 2 dissolve tabs within 3 hours of each other b/c I was concerned over a trans-pacific flight. After taking the 2 tabs during that time fream I didn't fall asleep on the plane so much as I was most-likely unconscious for at least 2-3 hours during the flight.

37, 5, Social/general  Anxiety,Even at .25 MG taken only as needed_ I sometimes feel it is a little too sedating. And if I take it for more than a few days in a row I have to bump the dose up to .5 to get the same calming results. If I have to take it too many days in a row I do get some withdrawal like symptoms when I stop_ but nothing bad enough to deter me from using it. In any given 30 day period_ I probably only take it intermittently an average of 10-15 of those days.,I am very careful to only take as needed_ and do not have an addictive personality_ so this drug works well for me. I self-medicated for decades unsuccessfully. This has eliminated the stabs of panic and upset stomach I would almost always get when confronted with a crowd situation. I can sit next to a stranger now without coming unglued inside. Still prefer not to_ but can handle it. I have needed something like this since I was in 4th grade or so.
