Very fatigued with strange weakness in the back of my upper arms.  I felt like it was an effort to walk across the room and had to sit down often.,I went to the dr for palpatations and she set me up on a holter monitor and then prescribes something that causes palpatations.

1, 1, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE high b pressure,Had severe anxiety_ panic attacks_ paranoid_ could not handle any stress_ could not travel or leave my home_ weird thoughts_ suicidal thoughts and more. It took me about a year and more to start to feel better from these bad side effects. The effects slowly creep up on you and then they get bad. Also do not stop taking this drug. You will have to slowly ween off the drug or else you will have a bad rebound effect from it. This also happened to me. Not a good drug and should be taken off the market.,HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 5mg or 10mg is for high blood pressure. It is not a good drug and should be taken off the market. Try natural ways like eating alot of veggies and changing your diet instead of taking,F,36,6  months10mg or 5m 1X D,2/9/2015Email,Esidrix
