0, 3, high blood pressure,Began having pain when bending fingers that would run up my arm.  After that_ various pains in different parts of my body.  Pain was so severe that I couldn't sleep and had trouble getting into car and walked with limp.  Researched the drug online and self-diagnosed drug-induced Lupus.  Went to doctor who prescribed it and he_ too_ agreed with my diagnosis.  Took me off hydralazine and put on prednisone for several months. I certainly have sympathy now for people with Lupus.  I had never hurt so bad in my life.,,F,62,10  months20 1X D,11/12/2014Email,Hydralazine hcl
1, 2, High Blood Pressure,Took for about three months. At first_ not too bad_ except made my hair start to fall out. At about 3 months_ I got joint and muscle pains so bad_ I could not even turn over in bed without pain. I immediately stopped this medication_ about two months ago. The pain stopped after missing two doses. At this point_ my hair is just starting to come back. I cannot ever take this again!,,F,66, 50 2X D,9/6/2013,Hydralazine hcl
2, 1, high blood pressure,I am in my late 60s and on no other medications. BP systolic reading as high as 175. I took 1/2 tab twice a day - each tab was 50 mg. I stopped taking this drug after 2 days due to the following reactions: I was nauseous and felt like I was going to throw up; could not think straight; brain fog; fatigue; pressure on the eyes and whole head; heat flushing in face and neck; stuffy and runny nose; muscle twitching above left knee about 4 times a day (for several minutes); loose bowels and heavy urine flow. Decrease in systolic BP was 20 points. None of these symptoms were present before taking this drug. As a summary statement_ I felt like I had been poisoned. I was able to bring down my systolic reading by 25-30 points by drinking 12 oz. of aloe vera juice a day (4 oz. 3X a day) and drinking hibiscus tea (a natural diuretic) as my only liquid during the day (16 oz. or more). Though my BP is still high_ I will look for other natural methods to lower my BP.,I consider this drug a poison.,F,68,2  days50mg 1X D,8/6/2013Email,Hydralazine hcl
