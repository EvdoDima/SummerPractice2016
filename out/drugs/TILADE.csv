0, 5, asthma preventer,Seems to lift my mood a little.    I had bad side effects from steroid puffers and Tilade is the only one I can use.   It took two months to be working really well.,The only puffer preventer I can use without any bad side effects.,F,61,1  years2 puffs 2X D,5/12/2013,Tilade
1, 4, Asthma,"At first it's a bit ""chalky"" on your throat",It is the only asthma preventer style medication I can use. It is not as powerful a preventer as the steroidal preventers. Having said that the steroidal preventers send me into an anxiety ridden insomniac. I'm so glad Tilade exists.,F,51,12  years,4/30/2009,Tilade
2, 4, Asthma,None that we know of (possible weight gain_ but she is also on Singulair),My daughter has been on this medicine for over a year and even though her asthma is not completely under control_ it has been a good option for a non-steriod asthma drug.  We really did not want to have her on a steriod for long term.  She has only had an ocassional night-time flare up_ but we are still working on her endurance during exercise before she has to stop because she can't breath.,F,9,14  months,3/27/2008,Tilade
3, 1, Asthma,shaking_ nausea_ flushed face,,,,1  months,9/25/2007,Tilade
