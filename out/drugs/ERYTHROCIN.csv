4, 1, infected wasp sting,feeling weak_ shivering_ constant severe nausea and not wanting anything to even touch my stomach because even movement felt as if it would set off vomiting.

Reduced the dosage to 1 250mg this lunch time in effort to reduce symptoms felt a bit better hence writing this but still not able to eat much - only some raw carrot and tomato.,On a positive note - the swelling of my foot reduced noticably after 6 hours and even more improved today although still infected - would never take these again although I believe I have taken erythromycin in the past without problems,F,53,2  days500mg 4X D,10/6/2013,Erythrocin
5, 1, Chest infection,Severe chronic stomach pains_ nausea and sickness. Pain lasted for 18 hours after the last pill. Was so severe_ we were close to calling an ambulance. I wasn't advised by my doctor that this drug had such severe side effects. IF PRESCRIBED THIS DRUG - ask for a second opinion as there are alternatives available.

8, 1, Sinus Infection,Extreme nausea_ very tired and weak_ abdominal pains_ vomiting_ headaches_ bloating....,This medicine did help with my sinus infection (within a few hours) however_ I don't think the side effects I experienced are worth it. I have had extreme nausea and have been vomiting since I started it. I would definitely ask for an alternative if you can. This is my 4th day taking it and am considering stopping because the side effects are too much to deal with.,F,30, ,2/2/2010,Erythrocin
9, 4, infected parotid gland,I have Sjogrens Syndrome and get infected salivery glands due to lack of saliva.  I have had Erythromycin before (I'm allergic to Penicillin)and it has never bothered me.  This time felt ill_ terrible diarrhoea.,Thought the pills looked different from previously.  Anyone know if the drug company has been tinkering with them? It did cure the infection but didn't care for the reaction to it,F,80,5  days,1/19/2010Email,Erythrocin
10, 1, dental infection,complete muscle weakness starting in arms and legs_ spreading to rest of body. Trouble breathing_ slurred speech. Loss of hearing_ blurred vision. Felt completely spaced out.,My side-effects are listed as 'myasthenia type symptoms' in the drug info but my GP said i was his first patient in 22 years that has suffered from them. After checking on various forums it seems they are actually quite common. They are very scary_ very real and i ended up in hospital. Please be very wary of this commonly prescribed_ cheap medicine.,F,35,2  days,12/29/2009Email,Erythrocin

15, 4, Bronchitis,The first few days made my chest feel even tighter than it had before I started talking the medication. Also I had a lot of stomach cramping but by the fourth day the symptoms disappeared. My illness went away quickly however the whole time my appetite grew making me feel hungry 24 hours a day. I ate so much_ but thankfully I didn't gain any weight.,Drug works but the side effects aren't really worth it. It is a cheap drug and you can certainly tell. There are better drugs for Bronchitis ie: Azrithomycin which I would recommend.,,20,10  days,6/18/2008,Erythrocin
