0, 4, Ulcerative colitis,Headaches and a mental fog.,This medication works_ but is overpriced. Without insurance it costs over $1000 for 180 tablets. Also it is coated with DBP. I guess with every medication a price has to be paid.,F,26,12  years800 3X D,7/13/2015,Asacol hd
1, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,No side effects.  Asacol HD has worked great for me!  I was diagnosed with UC in 2001 and took Asacol 400 mg for 10 1/2 years.  Then I experienced a major flare and was put on Asacol HD.  It only took a couple of weeks to notice major improvement and a couple of months to be in full remission.  I am extremely happy with this medication and highly recommend it.,,F,37,10  months1600 mg x3,11/18/2012,Asacol hd
2, 2, UC,Bloating_ abdominal pain_ sudden bowel movements_ lathergic_ difficulty staying asleep_ made colitis worse.,It worked for the first 8 weeks. After that things regressed. I thought I was having another flare up. Did my research and found the drug to have too many side effects. There is lactose in this as well_ which I cannot tolerate (most who have an IBD can't!) and I feel contributed to my digestive problems. I've been off of Asacol HD for only a few days now and haven't had any bloating and sudden urges. I'm still bleeding but will seek other treatments for this.,F,31,5  months800mg 3X D,11/21/2010Email,Asacol hd
3, 5, ulcerative colitis,Hair loss,This medicine works. I also take 4g salofalk daily for 3 months. I had to change my diet to 5 or 6 small meals daily_ all healthy and eat only soluable fibre (no skins of fruit of veg)but my diarrehea is gone and UC is under control. I am reducing Asacol over past month and now down to 2 x 400 mg and 4g salofalk every other day and my hair loss has reduced also_ I think if I can reduce further it will be ok. I am hopeful it will grow back. Other than hair loss_ I have tolerated this drug well.,F,47,3  months800 mg x 2 3X D,10/16/2010,Asacol hd
4, 1, colitis,fatigue_ nausea_ headache_ severe rash,It did nothing for my diahrea. Maybe made it worse. I was run down and felt bad. Magnesium levels dropped from diahrea and was getting bloodwork every month. Stopped taking it and am starting to feel better after about 3 weeks. Rash went away after a few days.,F,53,8  months800 3X D,6/24/2010,Asacol hd
