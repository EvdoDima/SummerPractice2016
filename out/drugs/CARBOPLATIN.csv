0, 3, Stage 4a ovarian,Regimen of weekly Taxol for 18 weeks_ Carboplatin added on the third week for 6 cycles.  I am doing much better on the Taxol than the combo.  Last week I began the second round with both drugs and felt like I'd been hit by a train.  The major symptom is extreme fatigue.  Physically tired and muscle fatigue.  Some days it was difficult to climb a small set of stairs.  Today I had just the Taxol_ but had low white blood cell count and very low blood presdure.  The dr. Finally approved the chemo_ but I'm worried that I won't bounce back after the large dose in 2 weeks.  I really dread showing up for that treatment as my oncologist informed me during my last visit that I would feel much worse as time progresses.,,F,50,2  months,9/1/2015Email,Carboplatin
