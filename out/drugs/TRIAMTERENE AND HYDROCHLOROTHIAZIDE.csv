1, 4, Edema,Took this years ago. Worked great_ no side effects. This time after 3 days I am lightheaded when on my feet (I teach)_ nauseated a bit at times. Yesterday started craving salt like no other!! I am excessively thirsty even after having water with me all day. It's disturbing. I didn't take a pill today due to testing in double hour blocks  and I can't leave the classroom to pee. Why am I SO thirsty even after water_ eating watermelon_ broth.... Ugh!,,F,51,1  weeks37.5 mgs,5/22/2014Email,Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide

3, 4, severe water retention,I have Lupus_ therefore I'm careful to stay out of the sun. When I have to be in the sun (mowing the lawn_ etc.) I always use a powerful sunscreen_ but I found that no matter what...I end up with blistered ears_ & often times a severe sun rash that scabs over on my shoulders_ chest_ and upper back. I also find that when I work out and my body heats up...I end up with a rash that appears like hives on my chest and upper back. Over the past year_ I started breaking my pills in half_ & I no longer experience these side effects...& still gain the positive results (no water weight gain)  The first year I began taking this medication I experienced lower back contractions after taking the medication_ but they subsided.,Again_ because I have Lupus...I'm highly critical of any medication I take.  It's really hard to determine what medication may be causing your side effects when you're taking many.  I'm convinced that this one is mainly sun sensitivy & you need to be slightly aware of potassium deficiency. Just pay attention to leg cramps in the middle of the night...if you get them_ just take a potassium supplement. I've had some hair thinning_ but so many things contribute such as age_ Lupus_ meds_ hormones...just love yourself regardless!,F,46,16  days37.5 5-25 1X D,11/12/2011Email,Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide
4, 2, High Blood Pressure,Hair loss has accelerated.  Lost maybe 25% of hair. Side effects subtle.  I was on five drugs so it is tough to assign problems until I stopped it.  After about a week of weaning off of HCT_ feet_ ankles_ calves and legs became swollen.  About 30% to 40% more.  Feet are very swollen and hurt.  It has lasted about five days so far. Exercise and diet doesn't seem to matter.  Swelling is worrisome because it can be symptom of something worse--like heart trouble.   Oh_ and of these drugs_ Metoprolol_ HCT and Hydralazine_ you might as well forget about sex_ especially for men.  Sexual dysfunction is very common and extensive.  Another little treat several of them have is urinary tract pain.  I thought it was my prostate going bad but it is the drugs.  Some advice.  If you have strange symptoms while on various drugs_ look up each drug and their side effects_ even the exceedingly rare ones and you will probably find your symptoms listed.  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor for another drug.,,M,60,4  months25 1X D,9/9/2011,Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide
