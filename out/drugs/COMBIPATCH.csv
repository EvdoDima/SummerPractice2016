1, 3, osteopenia_ vaginal dryness,mild headache_ fatigue_ weight gain/bloating in mid-section_ breast soreness_ bleeding,I started menopause in my mid-30s and am taking this primarily because it is said to improve bone density_ and I was deathly afraid of fosamax.  Since yesterday I've been experiencing more than breakthrough bleeding. I'm not sure if I should be concerned about this. I'm not thrilled about the weight gain_ and am concerned about reading all of the comments about hair loss.,F,46,14  dayslowest 1X D,7/22/2016Email,Combipatch
2, 4, hot flashes and mood swings,Hair thinning loss_ heart palpitations_ extreme vaginal wetness.,It was great for my hot flashes & mood swings!  I had problems  with the patch irrating my skin.,F,60,1  years50/250 2X W,7/18/2016Email,Combipatch
3, 3, HRT,Sadly @ this age there can be SO many issues. I have some food intolerances_ makes me flush. I also think it's really questionable as to the reliability of the dispensing of a patch_  especially when you consider what we're doing to try to make them work...Thought I had the WORST hot flashes; not so. Flushing from allergies.   SPOTTING! Weight gain? or inability to lose weight? some skin issues_ thinning hair_ hard to say if that's from the patch_ occasional headaches_  hard to put that on the patch.  Overall anything is better than suffering extreme hot flashes_ which I'm starting to think are from a myriad of other things along with menopause . To experience the feeling that you're going to spontaneously combust!!  It's hard to believe that other women went through this in the 20s & the 30s .  Of course_ conveniently we get to blame big Pharma for everything . Ideally what it would be great to know about is how some women function who have NEVER HAD THEIR hormones FUSSED with ! Starting at the ages of 13 14 15 and 16.  And now we have the morning after pill_ and another IUD!!! These companies are just looking for trouble aren't they ?  So when you have stats that I can use to compare what it's like to be a woman who hasn't had her body completely contorted by the time she's 25 then I guess I'll know exactly what the real side effects are !,The patch doesn't stay on! NONE of the patches stay on!  The ONLY way to get the patch to stay on; get yourself what is known as a sterile clear window bandage_ take the patch apart put it in the center of the window_ then put the bandage on with the patch . Only the manufacturers will know if this is changing the effects of the distribution of the patch. Maybe they should look at the window bandages and figure out how to incorporate a patch into it (duh) because the damn patches are expensive! Having them come off  is pretty much enough to stop using them_ when you consider the cost of the bandages and the patch .  I guess we women are always supposed to spend more money_ suffer a little more_ get a little less out of life! we can thank the manufacture for this one this time COME ON FIX THE STUPID APPLICATION!',F,59,3  months30 mg,6/13/2016,Combipatch
4, 3, Hot flashes_ night sweatsÂ…..,"WEIGHT GAIN_ my hair has been changing (ticking me off!) Didn't think I was loosing it but I'll pay more attention now after reading all the reviews. Spotting. Recently I seem to be having ""break through"" bleeding. (Frequently!) Slight headache.",It took about 3 weeks for me to get relief from those damn hot flashes and night sweats_ but when the patch finally kicked in all the menopause symptoms stopped. My biggest issue is the patch peeling up around the edges. This happens not too long after I put it on. I clean the area first with alcohol and dry it completely (with my blowdryer!) This is my biggest complaint. Maybe if it were made of a more Band Aid like material it would stay on better. Its like putting a hard piece of contact paper on your skin without getting bubbles! I've already had more of an issue with the weather getting warmer and my skin getting sweaty. It peels right up around the edges.,F,53,6  monthsLeast amt.,6/7/2016Email,Combipatch
5, 4, constant hot flashes_ mood swings,Initially headaches and very swollen tender breasts. Stopped patch to allow  breasts to settle down.  hot flashes returned with a vengeance two months later_ so started patch back    Cured hot flashes_ have some ups and downs with mood_ maybe patches are not quite all the same dose?,I use a waterproof band aid to cover my patch_ sort of like the ones that go over IV's in the hospital. Works like a charm. No leaking of water on patch and it stays on for the whole 3 days.  for those with weight gain_ I was gaining weight through the middle without the patch_ age related_ menopause symptoms I believe_ so I dont think the patch makes that worse.

For me_ this patch increased my anxiety_ gave me acne (which I never have)_ made me very sleepy but too anxious to sleep. I am very progestin/progesterone intolerant.

I do have a red mark when I change patches but that goes away after a day or so_ NO site itching as others complained about.,The Combipatch has made a huge difference in my overall well-being. Prior to the patch I would cry a lot for no reason_ felt exhausted_ suffered with major night sweats_ had wrinkly skin and a loss of muscle tone.  All have improved greatly. I took myself off the patch after about 1 yr because I was feeling so good I didn't think I needed it.  Well_ into my second month of being off the patch the depression_ exhaustion_ extreme anxiety_ night sweats all returned.  Needless to say_ I went back on the patch and I am once again feeling GREAT!  It's so good to feel happy_ energetic and just feel like me again!

25, 3, Menopause symptoms,The first 6 weeks on combo patch there were no noticeable side effects but then heavy spotting for 6 weeks - at around 12 weeks the bleeding stopped.  Mild breakouts during the time I was spotting. Gained 11 pounds or 10% of my body weight in the 5 months on the patch - this was NOT caused by menopause_ I have  always been underweight.  Breasts became very tender and swollen.  Itching and redness at application site from adhesive.  Loss of energy - not certain if this was a result of HRT or just the long winter.,I'm fortunate that the weight gain was not unhealthy_ in and of itself_ as I was so thin to begin with but 10% in 5 months is huge.  I quit HRT as the rate of weight gain wasn't slowing and my breasts became huge.  This was concerning - what else was HRT doing to my body that wasn't obvious?,,50,5  months50/250,2/28/2015,Combipatch

I had not had a period in seven months and now I have a period every 10-12 days.,It did cause weight gain_ mainly in my mid section. Before the patch I went to every doctor with complaints of heart palpitations_ dizziness_ fatigue_ mood swings_ severe hot flashes and night sweats. Finally_ my OB/GYN knew the problem! Menopause. At the beginning_ I thought this patch was the greatest thing ever created. The ongoing breakthrough bleeding is not fun_ but I'll have to weigh out what is worse. I did try higher dose patch_ but did not stop to spotting. Of course_ my doctor wants to perform and Endometrial biopsy. Don't know what to do?  Come off patch and have debilitating symptoms or deal with having bleeding every 10 days.,F,50,6  months50/140 3X W,11/20/2014,Combipatch
28, 4, hot flashes/sweats_ vaginal dryness,leaves mark (sometimes  a scab) where former patch was. Hair loss!!!,The Combipatch eliminated my night sweats and hot flashes as well as the vaginal dryness. I am just talking a break after noticing my hair thinning. Now my hair comes out in clumps when I comb/brush it! I see this is a common side effect after reading reviews. I also noticed some changes in my skin (more bumps/cellulite?) and fat/weight gain around my middle but it's hard to say if it's due to the patch or simply menopause.

My problem was that after a few months I cramped and hurt.   Also started having too heavy of a discharge.   I cut the patch in half and that worked a little better for a short  time then I had the same thing.   I did go to the dr to make sure I had nothing else going on.  All test results were negative.  Only thing it cld be is the patch.  Going to get off of it as the dr suggested and see if things clear up.  If so then I know for sure it was the patch.,,F,48,6  months50/140 2x,9/11/2014,Combipatch

However_ I can't take the regular bleeding and weight gain.  I already had metabolic issues when menopause began.  I am very glad I found this site_ because I was concerned about the bleeding and possible cancer. After reading other comments_ I decided today is my last day for the patch and  I  will pray for something better to replace the patch.

I am high risk breast cancer. Also have iud put in a year ago for heavy ongoing bleeding. My doctor says I am on the lowest dose and will only be on until my moods are better. I don't think I will feel comfortable on this for more than one month. Unless I am super happy. It's really to soon to rate but I had to.

39, 1, mild hot flashes_ vaginal dryness,Nurse practioner prescribed it after a brief discussion of my menopausal symptoms.  It sounded great.  I told her my mother had breast cancer and she said I was very healthy and as long as I kept up with check up and mammograms I would be fine as I was in good health.  Long story short out of the clear blue while on the patch I have developed inflammatory breast cancer IBC and have 4 tumors in the same breast and had 10 lymph nodes removed.  I had to go to Dana Farber as there is no cure for IBC and they are studying it.  Every year I would ask are you sure this is safe for me of course the reply was yes.  In doing further research my cancer is estrogen positive so the patch fed the cancer and made it highly invasive.  There is no cure to date.  I have had chemo_ masdectomy and radiation.  The nurse did not write any of my family history on my chart as I got my records.  I also had a fibroid tumor benign removed while using the patch and it is indicated that they should be removed 4-6,,F,60,4  years50/140 2X W,2/11/2014Email,Combipatch
40, 4, Vaginal dryness_ fatigue_ mood swin,I started out taking the .05mg/.14mg/day patch in Sept. 2012.  The lower dose helped greatly with my vaginal dryness_ insomnia_ hot flashes_ mood swings_ & fatigue_ but it was causing continuous breakthrough bleeding_ so in Dec.2012 my doctor changed me to the higher dose of progesterin of 05/.25mg which corrected the breakthrough bleeding but now (2 months into the higher dose) I am having breakouts of acne all over my face.  I am going to try an acne medication (probably ProActiv) and see if that helps before I give up on the patch altogether. The patch is easy to use but it does leave a sticky residue when you peel it off.  Also_ it helps to rub the area you're going to apply it to with alcohol so that it will stick to your skin better.

55, 1, Menopause,Horrible breast tenderness_ bleeding all the time_ bad cramps. Was on Femhrt prior but they stopped making it. Dr. put me on this patch after I had taken  nothing for 3 weeks and hot flashes had returned. Did not bleed at all on Femhrt. Now bleeding all the time and my breast hurt all the time. Today is last day on this patch. Starting a new pill tomorrow.,,F,56,10  weeks,10/20/2012,Combipatch
56, 4, Hot Flashes,After first year the patch site started itching and producing a red spot. I reported to Novartis & Dr.  No one has any suggestions thus far.  Adhesive problem. INCREDIBLY annoying.,Patch is highly effective. Dr. said can only use for 5 yrs. No side effect except intense red itchy spots that take a while to heal after i remove patch. Sometimes i can't stand it and move patch to another area after 1 day.,F,55,3  years50-250 2X W,10/6/2012Email,Combipatch
57, 1, Hot flashes / night sweats,Serious HAIR LOSS: 1. Several major sheds. 2. Ongoing daily hair loss. 3. Noticeable thinning of hair and widening part.**** I have stopped the patch and within 8-10 days the daily hair shed has noticeably tapered off*****,"I posted on 04/28/2012 re: Hairloss. I thought I would wait a few months to see if the hair shed would slow down. So it has been one year since the shed began: July 2011 to August 2012.Since my April post I have found the following information posted by a medical doctor/hormone specialist on an HRT forum - Baldtruthtalk.com:""Combipatch has a progestin in it that has slight testosterone-like activity"" So I would take this to mean if the patient has Androgen sensitivity /DHT sensitivity the progestin in this particular patch may trigger their hair loss. This side effect is not disclosed in the literature included with Combi-Patch from NOVARTIS Pharmaceuticals. WHY IS THIS NOT INDICATED by Novartis??  ****""CAN CAUSE NOTICEABLE HAIR LOSS"" ***** THIS ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE DISCLOSED! I am stopping this patch now. I have had all the Thyroid and other panels and they are normal so the only possible cause for my thinning hair is the patch. '",F,55,21  months5/500 2X W,8/22/2012,Combipatch
58, 5, hot flashes,Quite a bit of bleeding (sometimes dark_ almost black_ some odor) first three years_ then began wearing it on my back only (had been wearing on front only) and bleeding is much less and more like normal menstrual blood when it does occur. It now lasts only a few days per month if at all.,pros: increased muscle tone_ I am stronger than I've been in years (workout with kettlebells)_ better skin tone and hair.  cons: increased middle fat until I became mostly vegetarian_ cut out all refined foods.....eat only fresh veg and fruit_ some protein like tofu_ walnuts and almonds_ dairy.   It seemed like I had a little hair loss at first but now hair is shinier and thicker. Zero hot flashes_ less dryness_ a few pimples as I had when younger. This has been a miraculous drug for me_ but am beginning to have bad heartburn and wonder if patch is contributing_ and/or diet?? Or just the baby aspirin my gyne prescribed at the same time? So happy to see this website. And how interesting that the middle weight gain and hair loss experienced by so many are not listed in the adverse side effects of the so-called experts. On the other hand_ middle weight gain and hair loss are quite common for those in this age group who are not on HRT_ so we need more studies to sort it out.,F,64,4  years50/140 2X W,7/4/2012Email,Combipatch

60, 4, Menopause symptoms,I'm not positive these come from the combi patch but I do know they happened after starting to take it. 1-Headaches. I get a dull headache if I don't change the patch as prescribed (1 every 3 1/2 days) 2-Constipation. Not terrible but noticed a change in my bowel movements for a short while. 3-Hair loss. Again_ not sure this is from the combi patch but after reading other comments I'm thinking it is.,"I noticed that the hot flashes are much milder and the night sweats tolerable. Neither are extreme as before. I haven't noticed a weight gain per say but do work out and try to eat right. Although after reading comments THAT may be coming! Yikes! My biggest concern right now is the hair loss. The reason I came to this site was to ""just see"" if there was any connection between the combi patch and hair loss. The comments tell me there IS! I can't believe how much hair I've lost in the past few month. My daughter even said ""Mom_ that's not normal"" and I took pictures of it to show my doctor. I'm scheduled for a physical in a month and will discuss this with him. Darn...I may be wearing a wig soon!",F,53,7  months 2X W,5/7/2012Email,Combipatch

I constantly am looking in the mirror and can't believe that I again_ am one more time_ annoyed that I still have to watch what I eat just to ""HOPE"" that I can wear my jeans.  Honestly_ does it ever end.  Had the same problem with BC pills and used IUD in my 30's and 40's_ which definitely relieved the weight gain.  What more can I do??  I cannot go back to the way I felt_ but this is so frustrating.

I have been to my Gynecologist & Dermatologist and they blame it on age.  I am searching to find out if any CombiPatch users have experienced hair loss or changes in their hair.

78, 5, severe hot flashes,slight rash at patch site; controlled with hydrocortisone cream after patch removal,It's saved my sanity--hot flashes and lack of sleep were completely debilitating.  Used the patch for 2 years_ gradually cutting it down (literally cutting it with a scissors) until I weaned myself off it.  Within two weeks the hot flashes were back as bad as ever.  Went back on it at 1/2 patch twice a week--still have very mild hot flashes mostly at night but it's a good compromise for me--hot flashes are largely controlled and my dose is low enough that I don't worry as much about the cancer risk (my mom died of breast cancer so I am high risk--but my quality of life was so wrteched with the hot flashes that I am willing to take the increased cancer risk).,F,61,2  years,12/15/2009,Combipatch
