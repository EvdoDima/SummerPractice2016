0, 1, P.A.D. - FOOT & LEG CRAMPS WHEN WAL,EXCRUCIATING HEADACHE_ HEART PALPATATIONS_ RAPID PULSE_ (go to the list of severe side effects_ I had 90 per cent of them.,Within 6-8 weeks after taking this drug_ the main artery in my left leg COLLAPSED.  Over the course of 6 months_ with Plavix and exercise_ I was able to resume walking almost normally again.  Doctor tells me a secondary artery is supplying the blood flow.  This happened 12 years ago.  (I am not positive about the dosage or frequency.)  I still hurts to walk long distance_ but I am avoiding having a cadaver artery installed.,M,61,7  days 2X D,5/21/2012Email,Pletal

3, 3, intermittent Claudation,Within first few days of taking this medication my body felt like it had been severly burned and that my bones were being crushed.  I could not even touch my own skin it hurt so bad.  The headaches were unbearable for the first 8 days.  I am now experiencing rapid heart rates (up to 173 BPM) and severe shortness of breath.,I am also on Dyazide so my Vascular surgeon had me space out the time that I took the two meds.  It seemed to help as far as the untouchable skin...which the doctor said wasn't a side effect.(yeah right).  Now I am having test done to check my lungs and heart to find out why I am having the shortness of breath and rapid heart rate...and of course_ according to them_ these symptoms aren't from these medications.,F,44,3  months,11/26/2008Email,Pletal

5, 5, Claudication & Peripheral Arterial,Nothing notable,With my left femoral artery fully blocked_ my toes were starting to turn purple.  There was some discussion about a bypass.  In an effort to forestall that_ the cardiologist prescribed Pletal.  All of my doctors--GP_ nephrologist_ podiatrist_ even the cardiologist--thought it wouldn't do anything.  However_ after several weeks_ I can notice a difference.  Not only can I walk a little farther_ my toes are much more normal looking--pink instead of purple.,F,58,2  months,2/6/2007,Pletal
6, 4, Intermittent Claudation,Very severe headache for first six days_ then headaches went away.,I originally started taking this med for possible intermittent claudation_ and later it would be confirmed that I had 100 percent blockage in left femoral artery ( the whole length of it) my left illiac artery was 90% plus blocked and my right leg was block about 70%. Peripheral Vascular-Aterial Disease. They were going to a by-pass by by going putting a tube from femoral to femoral then do a fem-popliteal_ but decided to check my heart first. Prior to the angio they told me to go off pletal. Heart angio discovered 2 coronary arterys 99% and 100% block_ and my left anterior descending blocked at or about 70%. I was then suppose to have open heart by-pass surgery. I have not done it as of this date. I am still alive_ knock on wood. The doctor order me back on pletal and  on this day of first taking the savage headaches came with it. I can hardly walk 20 feet now. We will see what happens. I was the last post on this board Sept of 2005. All I can say is the pletal seemed to work for me a,M,57,1  days,12/27/2006Email,Pletal
7, 4, Possible intermittent claudication,First five days_ severe headaches with in 30 minutes of taking the medicine. Almost quit taking_ on sixth day headaches stopped.

It first started in the crotch of my elbow_ seemingly in the vein there. The pain and tenderness has now progressively worked its way following veins path the the meaty part of the palm of my hand.
