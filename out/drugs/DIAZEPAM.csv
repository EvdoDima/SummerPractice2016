0, 2, Cutting from 3mg Clonazepam,Shaking_ cognitive impairment_ memory impairment_ emotionally out of control,I have cut_ using the Ashton manual_ from 3mg of Clonazepam down to 17.5 and cannot cut any further. For 8 months I have been at this dose_ and the withdrawal has gotten worse_ not better,M,54,8  months8.75 2X D,5/2/2016Email,Diazepam
1, 1, to reduce anxiety,complete anterograde amnesia combined with aggression_ suicidal ideation and attempted suicide,I would not recommend it to anyone - the possible side effects can be deadly.,F,29,3  daysunknown 1X D,2/3/2015,Diazepam
2, 5, Anxiety/panic/insomnia/depression,Morning grogginess_ memory loss,Heaven would be Valium that was not addictive_ did not cause tolerance_ and was OTC. It has stopped my mind-racing worry at night and panic attacks for years. I was recently diagnosed with RBD_ or REM sleep behaviour disorder_ so I have to switch to clonazepam_ which is used for this disorder. So far it seems very deadening and tiring even at a very low dose_ with none of the anxiety-lifting effects of diazepam.,F,73,20  years5 mg. 1X AN,11/11/2014,Diazepam
3, 5, PTSD_PMDD_EDS injuries/pain_anxiety,none. Honestly_ surprisingly level rather than sedate and/or numb. Not depressing or anxiety provoking like ativan. Need it more often than I'd like_ but- my situation is very rare. Usually_ you can use this at very low doses and because it builds up in the system_ when you don't need it_ you can go for days with out it and not have adverse withdrawals like with ativan and clonazepam_ etc.,"I have used this on and off for years_ I am standing dose 9 am/pm right now_ however I had break through PRN's of 5mg tabs every 6 hours and the HS dose 15. I was taking it for the incredible breakdowns/dysautonomia from EDS (Ehlers-Danlos) and my PTSD and PMDD issues. I did not expect it to work so amazingly for pain. They took out the PRN dosing due to insurance confusion_ however that's changing because the difference in cogent thinking and speaking_ in my pain threshold_ my flashbacks and night sweats- un-real. I remembered doing well on it before_ however I still can't believe how CLEAR minded it actually started making me. I also have to be on muscle relaxers that don't strike the collagen cells themselves like flexeril_ skelaxin_ etc. with EDS you have to hit the brain stem and_ I really can't wait to be back on the regular regime. There is some question of ER alprozolam_ but only if it's XR. Everything ""too-too"" IR is NO DICE when it comes to benzos. You're on a bad path 90% of the time for PRN use with extreme chronic anxiety attacks.",F,30,2  months10mg 2X D,6/7/2014Email,Diazepam
4, 5, anxiety and sleep,I have noticed no side effects except a little drowsiness which two strong cups of coffee solves in the morning. My mind starts working overtime when I lay down at night and the diazepam calms me and makes me a little drowsy to sleep.,I make sure I have the time to get my 7 hours of sleep and rest. I never take it to get high. I have broken the pill into if I was calm and not needing the 10 mg and use it to only to sleep unless I get really upset during the day such as a death_  injury to someone I care about_ or now a divorce after 25 years unexpectedly.My new doctor decided to only give me 5 mg. a day and this has really effected me while I have been going through an emotionaldivorce_ my aged mother that lives with me and fell and broke her femur and shattered her wrist and before that someone rear ended my 2005 Buick I had only gotten 2 months earlier.But I would recommend this medication if someone needs it.A doctor wrote me a script and I tried one zanax and it put me in a dark place and I never want another zanax. When I wanted to up my Diazepam to 10 mg the doctor gave me Ambien and not sure I will try it. I read the reviews. :) ,F,61,15  years10 mg. 1X D,5/30/2014,Diazepam
5, 5, Panic attacks,At first sleepiness.,Still works wonderfully after 5 years.  I've tried every benzo on the market_ and its still surprising how this ancient drug works better for me than anything else.  Also taking It with Effexor XR and trazodone.  Knocked out my panic attacks completely!,M,26,5  years10 mg 2X D,1/25/2013,Diazepam
6, 3, GAD_ Panic attacks,tolerance;  very poorly absorbed before/during/after food/meals,Long half-life is great. But I've noticed a severe malabsorption of this med with food. This is a major problem. The pharmaceutical market is (i feel) wide open to an enteric-coated form that is pre/post prandial neutral. One lives in hope...!,M,54,24  months5MG 3X D,12/17/2012,Diazepam
7, 5, Anxiety and Panic Attacks,None,"One of the best meds I've used for Anxiety. This drug has been around a long time and works great if you don't abuse it. Taken as needed_ it has helped me a lot with Severe Anxiety and Panic Attacks. I've noticed that with ALL drugs_ you will find people who say ""Don't take this or that drug"" as if you'll die if you do_ these people have serious issues.",F,55,10  years5MG 3X D,11/27/2012Email,Diazepam
8, 3, anxiety,none.,"Was given this as a substitute for ativan (lorazepam) because of its longer half-life_ and thus greater efficacy at helping me sleep. I found it much less potent than ativan_ and could take it like candy. It's a ""smoother"" benzo experience_ but for that reason_ felt ""watered-down."" I'd rather take ativan for anxiety/panic_ and then lunesta or something for sleep. In my opinion_ diazepam has been surpassed by other benzos like klonopin_ ativan and xanax_ and should be used only to ween off of these (again_ due to its longer half-life and mildness).",M,35,6  months20mg 1X D,8/2/2012,Diazepam
9, 5, Anxiety/Panic attacks/insomnia,Initially_ diazepam sedated me_ especially once it built up in my system after about a week or two_ but the sedation wore off_ and now I find that it works great to keep my anxiety low and prevents panic attacks...also_ diazepam is much easier to withdrawal from than Xanax or Ativan b/c of the long half-life..,,M,25,2  years10mg 2-3x,4/27/2012,Diazepam
10, 1, ...,,Having side effects_ withdrawal problems (between doses_ trying to cut back_ etc) and not getting real info from the medical profession? You aren't alone or crazy. Want to know the truth about Benzo's? Check out: www.benzo.org.uk/manual/,F,,  1X D,4/26/2012Email,Diazepam
11, 5, Anxiety/Stress,None,It has been a great drug to relieve my anxiety for stress in life. I suffer from social anxiety and it helps in social settings.,F,42,2  years5 mg 2X D,2/14/2012,Diazepam
12, 5, Panic/Anxiety,I've been taking Diazepam 3-4 times a week for a couple years now for acute panic. I have a hereditary disease that sometimes causes me to freak out a lot. Diazepam has helped tremendously to keep me on an even keel.,Don't take more than you really need it_ don't stop taking it abruptly_ and DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL while taking it.,M,51,2  years10 MG 1X AN,8/24/2011Email,Diazepam
13, 5, migraine,none,Diazepam (valium) is the ONLY medication that has really helped with my migraines. I take 1 or 2 as I feel the symptoms come on and at about 20 minutes I am fine. No headache_ no aura.,M,41,5  years10 mg 3X D,7/24/2011,Diazepam
14, 4, RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME,None - it is very successeful for aleviateing the symptoms of restless leg syndrome.,Not safe to take for anxiety or sleep disorder as it is ALWAYS addictive. Diazepam takes over the brain's natural functions and brain dependency follows. This is known as addiction. It happens within 4 weeks. It may take 12-18 months to withdraw from diazepam very slowly. Stopping diazepam too quickly can cause cold turkey symptoms and even seizures and death. It is far more difficult to stop than heroin or cocaine. If you need it for a week or two - fine. If not_ then never take this drug ever_ unless it is for RLS like myself.,F,68, 5mg 1X D,12/19/2010,Diazepam
15, 5, Anxiety,drowsiness,Made my flying experience much more comfortable.,M,20,1  days10mg 1X D,10/9/2010,Diazepam
16, 4, Trapped nerve pain & depression,None.  Took it for 10 days (2mg) x 2 times a day.  Felt improvement within 48 hours.,Took effect within 24 hours.  Pain lessoned and I stopped crying and feeling low and miserable.  After 4 days I started to laugh again after weeks feeling hopeless.  Only took 2 x 2mg tablets a day for 10 days.  Come off them and already feeling lower and the pain level is going up.,F,37,10  days,2/24/2009,Diazepam
17, 5, anxiety/ post traumatic stress,After trying multiple drugs with mostly no results and major side effects_ I have finally found a med that helps. But like others have said_ sometimes it works better than others but always atleast takes the edge off.,,M,32,2  weeks,11/1/2008Email,Diazepam
18, 2, sleep problems,none,gp never gave sufficient dose to make it work. I was on 5mg_ i needed at least 6 tablets to feel drowsy. It wore off very quickly too.,M,34,4  years,10/15/2007,Diazepam
19, 1, stress,muscle fatigue and pain.  water retention or some sort of swelling_ feeling of being weak and sick.  All this after 1/2 of a 5 mg pill,would not take this again,F,65,1  days,9/14/2007,Diazepam
20, 5, Anxiety,This worked like a charm.  It allowed me the sleep I needed as well and I woke up in the am with no fatigue.  I took it with Effexor.,I do not have any insurance and if there is anyone that would be willing to sell me any_ it would be greatly apprciated.  I am in the process of finding a job with bennifits that would cover this medication.,M,44,3  months,7/20/2007Email,Diazepam
21, 4, terror attacks/suicidal thots,none,so far a lifesaver,M,37,7  days,5/27/2007,Diazepam
22, 5, Anxiety - Panic attacks,None bad - Slightly groggy in the morning after 5 or 10mg but if you can get 8 hours or so no problems. A nice morning coffee fixes it anyway.,This really helps me. Works better on occasions than at other times. I take it travelling and without out it I get bad anxiety. I try to use it only when needed which varies but go I go through probably 10-15 5mg per month on average. The best medicinal help I've found. Tried Zoloft but way too many side effects.,M,35,5  years,2/10/2007,Diazepam
23, 1, control antidepressane seide effect,"feeling of being ""sick""; tired; muscle soreness; immune system weaked; addiction with bad abdominal pain as withdrwal symptom",I was given diazapam to counteract anxiety due to antidepressants. I always took a lower dose than what was prescibed but eneded up badly addicted. After trying to go off a number of times I found that it takes a year or more (not the month my doctors told me). I found useful info at www.benzo.org. I am still in a lot of pain.,M,50,3  years,10/27/2005Email,Diazepam
24, 1, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Mild tiredness. The doctor gave me a very high dosage and the drug still did nothing. It was_ in my experience_ absolutely worthless,Do not use this drug,M,24,3  months,12/20/2004,Diazepam
25, 5, anxiety,None at all. In my opinion Diazepam is the best drug to treat my anxiety.,I'm being prescibed 20mg.s of diazepam_ same as valium_ to take three times a day and all I'v got to say is it's working great for me ! I finally can walk down the street without the unreal fears I had about people and now because of the help of this medication and my own self determination I now have a job.,M,23, ,11/3/2004Email,Diazepam
26, 5, Anxiety,None,No side effects. This drug did exactly what I wanted...to calm me down! I have such horrible anxiety attaks that I have gone to the hospital emergency room several times for fear that I was actually dying of a heart attack. I've had several EKG's done on me_ and every time my heart appears normal. So was diagnosed with Severe Anxiety and prescribed Diazepam to treat it. It works wonders for me.,F,29,5  years,9/25/2004Email,Diazepam
