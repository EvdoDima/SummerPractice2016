2, 1, sleep,I had a a pain down left arm and left leg at the same time after taking 1 pill. It went down in my fingers. I thought it was a blood clot. It lasted 2 months. I went to the doctor and he said it was called nerve something. It was very painful. He never gave me anything for it.,Don't take that poison. I was reading some of the comments on this drug and I am like O MY GOD. I figure I better warn people too. I felt a little groggy after the pill but thank god I stopped. I hope it don't cause more complications down the road. I didn't know it was for schizophrenia_ that makes no sense that they gave it to me for sleep. The drug companies are the schizos. They should make them take their own medacine.,M,25,1  days1 pill 1X D,11/14/2015Email,Risperidone

4, 4, extreme emotions_ trauma,I started at .5 and gradually moved to 1 mg.  some tiredness in the morning but not bad.  It is a glue that pulls all of your extreme emotions together so you don't feel so out of control.,Dealing with trauma that happened earlier in life. I literally feel like demons are attacking me. This drug is making life livable. I'm supposed to start taking an antidepressant next week.

6, 2, Prescribed for Schizophrenia,Extreme wakefullness for approximately an hour followed by complete disorientation and impaired thinking and decision making and increased aggression due to mental incapacity and fall asleep quickly. Usually feel good/better the next morning but groggy and flat emotional response. Memory loss and intolerance to bright light. Nonetheless risperidone is far better than haloperidol._ chlorpromazine or fluaxonol injection.,,M,28,2  years3Mg,6/3/2013Email,Risperidone
7, 2, irratability_ anxiety_ insomnia,"""floating"" feeling_ hungover feeling in the morning_ minor bodily aches_ emotionally numb",It worked very well for the insomnia. Once I got the timing right_ I would feel very sleepy when it kicked in_ go to bed_ and stay asleep. I was even able to quit taking Ambien. That said_ it did not take away the anxiety or irritability_ but numbed any positive emotions (happiness_ excitement_ love). I just didn't feel like myself and wanted to quit the drug immediately_ which I did_ which was a horrible idea as I had major crying jags and paranoia. So I weaned myself off and feel much better. I'd rather live with anger and anxiety than the feelings this drug gave me.,F,23,45  days1.5 MG 1X D,3/28/2013,Risperidone

9, 1, Psychosis,No emotions_ flat_ depressed_ walking around in a zombie like condition_ sucidal thoughts_ empty feeling_despair_ twitching_ drooling,"Oh my god you can not be serious_ they are prescribing me a drug which makes me worse than I am. It has no benefit except tranquillise. Read Robert Whitaker""Mad in America"" the real truth behind the use of antipsychotic is that they make you more psychotic. These drugs damage  your brain. Get off them today. The only way to deal with mental illness is rest recuperation exercise good diet no sugar meditation yoga acupuncture and positivity through friendsand family",M,32,4.5  months1.5 1X D,9/18/2011,Risperidone
10, 2, ,"a feeling of heaviness/""depression"" in my heart and head_ hopelessness/despair_ brooding thoughts_ prolactin increase_ light period. not fun. horrible overall.",stopped drug almost cold turkey. physical depression started to lift. lots of anxiety though. possibly the worst I've ever had. almost nautious. queezy feeling in body. insomnia. mental depression and despair. brooding thoughts. think my withdrawl lasted about a week and a half and I'm slowly coming out of it. (relief). oh_ and then there was the odd nightmare like scene I had as I tried to drift into sleep. not fun. pretty scary.,F,32,6  weeks1 2X D,7/13/2011Email,Risperidone
11, 3, borderline personality disorder,So far_ I've had terrible insomnia. When I do force myself to sleep_ I have constant nightmares.,I'm really worried about all of the side effects that people are saying_ like the weight gain. I haven't noticed anything like that_ but I've only been on the medication for a week.,F,19,7  days.5 1X D,2/15/2011,Risperidone
12, 3, Drug Induced Psychosis,greater problems with communicating(more so than usual)_ anxiety with blushing(I get this on all antipsychotics)_ Waking up early in the morning_ man boobs may have gotten larger_ at least at least I've noticed there more defined :)_ slight feeling of being drugged up.,So far its the best antipsychotic I've been on_ which doesnt say much about the use of these types of substances. Unlike Olanzapine and Seroquel I dont feel the need to sleep 14+ hours a day which is nice. Has it helped with the voices? Yes a bit... there more constant but less intense. I'll probably be getting my dose put up this week.Mood wise I prefer the it when im of my medication then when im dosed up on antipsychotics which may be because im more psychotic with out them but I doubt it,M,25,3  months2mg 1X D,10/24/2010,Risperidone
