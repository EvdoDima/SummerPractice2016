0, 1, High Triglicerdies,Severe weakness in left arm and shoulder - some in right side -trouble walking at times - feel terribly weak - a little concentration issues cropping up - increased lower back pain - chills - it's August and I am wearing sweats at night to stay warm - trouble concentrating - pills get stuck in my throat.My BP is great. I know why my tri's were so darn high_ I have been drinking Walgreen's brand of Ensure like crazy for months. I easily would go through 2 cases a month. It is loaded with sugar and carbs.I stopped drinking it_ stopped sugar in my coffee (using Splenda)_ honey in my oatmeal_ taking Flax Seed oil_ chewing Omega 3 gummies (I have a very hard time taking pills - they get caught in my throat since having an infection and scarring in my epiglottis plus scarring from GERD) These things_ the Tricor_ get caught in my throat about half the time,I have a failed lumbar fusion and Severe Chronic Neutropenia. I have enough going on as well as a an ill family member who needs me at my best right now.I test my hand strength during these episodes when this weakness thing starts. Equal. I perform basic neurological tests to make sure this is not something else - like touch my nose with each finger while arms out stretched_ touching thumbs to fingers_ each hand going at the same time_ challenging a different pattern (both hands doing the same thing)I grin repeatedly to see if one side of my face is weaker - equal and strong.So_ it has to be this damn drug. I hate it. I will take anything but thisPlus_ I am at my coverage gap/doughnut hole on my part D - no way i can keep taking it_ even if it wasn't making my life difficult.,M,57,2  weeks145 1X D,8/31/2015Email,Tricor (micronized)
1, 1, high cholesterol/triglycerides,liver shut-down,I began to lose weight after taking this drug. After about four months my urine began to darken.

4, 1, Hypertriglyceridemia Tri level 660,Photosensitivity (sensitivity to sun light)_ I developed a very itchy skin rash on the back of my neck and forearms. It got worst as with continued exposure to sun.,There were no side effects at first. I exercise very often (indoors) and spend most of my time studying. After being on the medication for a little over 2 months_ I began to develop a rash on the back of my neck and around my ears. It progressively became more itchy. I thought it was a rash from some fungus I may have picked up at the gym. I tried Hydrocortisone for a week with no relief. The rash began to spread to my forearms and top of my hand. The itch was become unbearable_ so I made an appointment with my doctor who told me stop taking the medicine. The rash began to dissipate as long as I was out of the sun. A week later and I still have some sensitivity to sun light. Also_ my triglycerides decreased by 20 mg. Not much..,M,26,2.5  months 1X D,4/3/2014,Tricor (micronized)

7, 1, High Tri at 200+,My dr prescribed me of this med because he said that I have high risk of heart problem because my father died of it. After taking this med for just 2 days I had already experience dull back pain and arm pain. I thought it was just because of my recent workout in the gym but seem odd because I never felt that way before. After 4th day it worsen and I started checking if this med is causing it. To my surprise_ I was really risking everything just to lower my tri. I immediately stopped taking the med and after just 40 hours all pain went away. I will instead try to workout everyday and control my diet than to endure severe side effect of this med. I will return to my dr this weekend to report this. Not worth it.,,M,27,4  days200,9/12/2013Email,Tricor (micronized)
8, 1, High Triglycerides,Severe gas/bloating_ frequent bowel movements_ flu-like symptoms_ body aches_ persistent low grade headache_ coughing_ pain in large muscles of legs_ feel like doo-doo.,"My doctor is obsessed with my cholesterol. My total is 250 (should be under 200)_ HDL 42 (should be 46 or higher)_ LDL 161 (should be under 130)_ Triglycerides 237 (should be under 150.) Now_ to me_ these numbers are not that terrible. If he'll be patient with me I can get them down through diet and exercise. But he tests me every 4-6 months. I was unable to tolerate ANY type of statin due to the same symptoms I am now experiencing with Fenofibrate (generic form of Tricor.) I think I lasted less than a week on even the lowest dose_ gentlest form of statins. I must be hyper-sensitive to the effects of cholesterol lowering medications because within 48 hours of taking any of them_ the symptoms start. When I quit the drug_ I go back to normal almost immediately. So that makes me realize that it will not do for me to ""push through"" these symptoms just to see my numbers look better on a lab test. Heck_ there is evidence and debate that lower cholesterol even helps prevent heart attacks and heart disease. There is even a disclaimer on many of the web pages I read about his drug_ stating such. I would rather have a good quality of life than have numbers that look good to a doctor. Stay off statins and Tricor if you want a good life. As a side note_ I will add that statins can cause early onset dementia or confusion and brain fog. My mother developed early onset Alzheimer's and to this day we wonder if her statin use was partly to blame.",F,51,2  days145mg 1X D,8/1/2013Email,Tricor (micronized)
9, 1, Triglicerides,Tricor and Triipex Meds experience. Started with rash itchy palms then hives only to spread around to any place warm on my body. Then went to xtream shoulder pain and weekness.Brushing own teeth was a issue  the only relieve was to take benydrel but it only helped the swelling and itching the pain was almost unbearable in the shoulders . Then six years later another Dr. wanted to treat the Triglycerides with another medicine this time I was prescibed Trilipex had the same symtoms but it occured a lot sooner then  with tricor but the same miserable results. Note  Pain seems to migrate from one spot to another rapidly.,Tricor or Trilipex  .   Take these with caution . if you have any kind of weard side affects I recommend you stop taking abruptly and to expect one week of severe issues slowly subsiding over time to full recovery . Asperin and benidril will help no icy hot or anything like that on joints it only seem to make the pain worse. Hot water run over joint pain seem to be a quick relief.,M,53,14  days135 1X D,12/31/2012,Tricor (micronized)

14, 3, ,I'm having some stomach discomfort and nausea_ especially in the morning_ and I'm not sure if it's related_ but I've also had an acne breakout.......,My triglicerides were 681 and my overall cholesterol was 305 when I went for routine blood work about 3 1/2 weeks ago_ which is incredibly high and alarming since I'm only 26 yrs old and in good shape and work out and watch my diet_ especially when it comes to fatty foods. Both of my parents are on statin drugs because they have high cholesterol_ my mother's on lipitor and my father's on crestor_ and the doctor said my high cholosterol is more genetic than anything. And btw_ I also was misinformed and thought Tricor was a statin drug_ the doctor also told me that it isn't in that class. It is in a class of drugs known as phenofibrates (not sure if i spelled it correctly) which also lower your cholesterol_ but not a statin drug like crestor or lipitor. I'm going to go back for another blood test in a week and see if my levels are down from where they were a month before I started taking it.,M,26,3  weeks145mg 1X D,7/15/2011,Tricor (micronized)

17, 1, High cholestrol,Shortly after starting_ began to have continuos_ extreme burning sensation on the bottom of both feet -- like a chemical burn.  Then after 30 days_ due to high stress_ my blood pressure (which had been normal) began to rise.At about three weeks_ I had a reoccurring_ cramp like pain in my left calf; then_ after being on Tricor for 30 days and stress at work got sever I began getting more spots of cramping in my left leg.  Then_ after two days of extreme stress -- which cause very_ high blood pressure_ I began having cramp-like pain all over my left leg_ left arm_ and right leg and each spot was painful from a few seconds to 20 minutes.  At first (when I had the single cramp-like pain in my left calf)_ my doctor suspected a possible blood clot but venal ultra sound was negative -- during that time my BP was normal.  Later_ when my BP was high due to stress I finally went to the E.R. and they ruled out everything except the Tricor.  I've stopped it for 2 days (now) and even though by BP,I would definitely NOT recommend TRICOR if you have or begin to have high blood pressure!  They are many of drugs I've been on for high cholesterol and this_ TRICOR_ is the first one that has given me these side-effects.  I'm so glad I found this website as it confirmed the E.R. doctor's findings.

18, 1, High triglycerides,I originally posted on here several years ago regarding my terrible experience with this drug. Since then_ the medical community has started to realize how devastating statin drugs can be to some people. In my case_ this drug permanently disabled my ability to walk any appreciable distance and it did this in a very short time period.  Unfortunately_ by the time my physician made the connection_ the damage had been done. My Achilles tendons became so degenerated that I had to have both of them resected and grafts put in. For those of you experiencing severe muscle aches and pain in your extremities_ I urge you to stop the medication IMMEDIATELY and see your physician and demand that he pay attention to your concerns.  Mine did not until it was too late.  The condition is known as statin myopathy.  Please take the time to research this if you are having problems as I describe. For those with no side effects_ you are fortunate. However_ in my case_ I was perfectly healthy and active and i,,F,62,4  months145 mg 1X D,4/21/2011Email,Tricor (micronized)

Before starting Tricor_ I walked on the treadmill for 60-90 mins 4-6 nights a week. I ate about 1200 cals a days_ mostly fruits_ veggies_ cherrios and fish. My overall cholesterol was 188_ bad cholesterol was 92_ good cholesterol was 44 and my Triglycerides were 319 - which is why I prescribed Tricor. I give you the background of my activity level because 3 weeks after starting Tricor and I have no energy_ My muscles feel weak and I just want to lay down. I have been this way for 3 days. Almost immediately after starting Tricor_ I have been craving fatty food. That is unusual for me.  But worst_ is the pressure I am feeling behind my eyes. I am going to talk with my doctor this week_ but I really think Tricor is the cause of me not feeling well. I am only 39 and very healthy - except the Triglycerides.

24, 1, hypertriglyceridemia,Let me start by saying that before I took the TriCor_ I was a very healthy and active individual_ able to do about anything physically I wanted with a demanding job in a physician's office.  After_ I felt I had aged 100 years. My symptoms began shortly after taking the medication with aching in the joints. This was tolerable and truthfully_ I thought it was just a sign of aging. However_ these mild symptoms rapidly progressed to an unbearable pain in my legs so severe I could not walk at all. Despite reporting these symptoms to my physician_ her answer was to run tests. All told_ several visits to the emergency room_ MRI_ Doppler_ CT scans_ numerous blood studies later_ the pain was more severe than ever.,On one of numberous trips to my physician_ the light went on for her. She said to stop the Tricor_ which I did immediately and though the pain stopped_ I was left with residual weakness in my lower extremities that is with me to this day. I am happy for those for whom the drug works. However_ on reading this board_ it appears that the bad far outweighs the good. I don't believe at all_ as one poster said_ that these symptoms are a natural aging process. When one becomes immediately disabled simply by taking a medication_ there is not one thing natural about that. It should be removed from the market_ or_ at the very least_ dispensed with caution and strong warnings about its harmful side effects.,F,62,4  months145 1X D,9/24/2010Email,Tricor (micronized)

As soon as I read this website_ that bottle went straight into the garbage can where it belongs.  By increasing exercise and making one MINOR change in my diet_ I cut that number in half in less than one month.

40, 2, High Triglycerides + 1100,I have been on all of the statins for years.  My last was tricor which I have been on and off for years.  I routinely get joint pains which the physicians could not explain.  I had suspected these drugs but was told that it probably was not the cause.  After reading this I believe I know better now.  I get joint swelling_ redness_ tenderness and severe pain which clears in about a week.  Very cyclic_ occurrs around every 7 to 9 months in one or the other ankle_ but never in both at the same time.  Feet always felt stuffed_ stiff and as if pads on the balls of my feet.,I had started on lopid when in was in my late 20's.  I had flu symptoms and eventually switch to Mevacor then Lipitor and Crestor.  A few years back I was switched to Triclor to try.  I have been experiencing joint pain in my ankles ever 6 to 9 months which resembled gout for years.  Redness_ swelling_ and severe pain when streching or moving the joint.  It would always affect only one ankle at a time  but this last week if finally hit my wrist.  I am going to have to get off of these medications because I can't tolerate these pains.  I have had multiple MRI on my ankle_ shoulder_ but the test showing nothing_ and the Orthpedic MD could not account for any findings causing the pain and swelling.  I had been working out 2 to 3 times a week until last year when I found I had 3 bulging discs.  I am now 53_ so I think I am going back to Niacin and Fish Oil.  I have had this unexplained joint pain for 15 years now_ and on occasion had a high cpk reading.  I suspected these medicaiton_ but now hearing everyone elses symptoms I am convienced. I periodically stop the med due to low back pain_ which feels inside and not as joint or muscle pain.

41, 3, 900+ Triglycereides,Only been on 145mg Tricor for a little over a week.  I have dreams that would make Stehpen Kings hair stand up.  My skin feels prickly/hot and my joint and muscle pain has amplified somewhat.  But what choice do I have?  Can not tolerate Niaspan (blistered my mouth).  I'm going to stick this out for a month and see what happens.  Dramatically_ altered my diet and quit alcohol.  Lost 10 lbs. my first week.  In the gym no matter how much it hurts.  Sometimes the cure can be worse than the problem.  I'll continue until my numbers come down.  More than likely I will only take a half tablet after first month.  I need to lose 30 more lbs.  Hopefully_ that will get me back to normal.  No pain_ no gain I guess.  Thanks to everyone for posting and raising my awareness!,Guess many of should just face some facts.  WE ARE GETTING OLD!  With that being said_ those of us in our forties and up have probably worked long and hard lives.  Many of the symtpoms described sound to me as the natural process of aging.  For those of you who have suffered severe organ damage_ I am really sorry to hear that.  I've been HIV+ for 24 years and don't really know what its like to be totally healthy.  Pain is just a part of my world...so I guess I can tolerate this med. better than others due to my conditioning to pain.  I feel really bad for the younger folks too.  What a lifetime battle you will have.  Get out and excerise and eat clean everyone.  Then get off the darn drugs!  I intend to.  I want to live.

And it appears the stuff has suddenly accelerated damage to my kidneys; I was a pretty well controlled diabetic_ now my life span may have been significantly shorted by these drugs. And the NEW evidence coming out on this drug (evidence not paid for by the drug companies) shows this drug has ZERO effect on rate of heart incidents! Most doctors these days are stupid self-serving pill pushers. Don't trust them.,IGNORE all the doctors who endlessly INSIST you HAVE to take this drug (and/or statins). They are just legally covering their @sses at the expense of YOUR health. The original published data (falsely concocted by the drug companies) SAY this stuff is effective and that the side effects are minimal. So the doctors HAVE to prescribe it or risk being sued for malpractice. When docs keep insisting you take this stuff_ they are choosing THEIR career at the expense of YOUR possible death. This stuff is pure poison and they know it. Don't you take it.,M,56,4  months,12/7/2009,Tricor (micronized)
43, 1, Trig,Until I came to this site I had no idea what was going on with my body! I've been having muscle pains in my lower back_ numbness and tingling in both arms_ all over muscles aches and pain_ swelling_ & weak feeling. And get this_ I began coughing alot (another side effect)...and so I went to the Dr. to find out if I was sick. So instead of going over my new Tricor prescription with me to see if it could be a side effect_ she prescribes an inhaler!! Which that in turn made my eyes puffy! Gooood Grief! Seems all my problems were from this drug. I had a pharmacist suggest Fish Oil_ Omega 3...so it sounds like that's the way to go. And of course diet!,I just read this article today...so going off the meds tonight & hopefully will feel better in 24 hours!!,F,47,2  months,11/23/2009,Tricor (micronized)
44, 1, high bad and good chlesteroel,I have been going to a family doctor for six weeks for feet leg stomach back chest and arm pain. Looking back I was in the emergancy room two times this year with chest pain they could not find a reason for. In decamber 08 I had shoulder surgery for what I was told was arthritis_ and I still have the same pains. The bottoms of my feet hurt so bad I cant walk at times_ my doctor has taking me off these two drugs and its been three weeks with no releaf.

47, 1, Hi Triglycerides  875,My side effects started off as mild muscle pain/flu like symptons.  I've been taking Tricor 145mg for about 16 months now.  I have developed severe muscle pain_ mainly in my left shoulder blade area.  It is also in my upper arms and and outer thighs.  In each area is like a trigger point to the pain and this pain then spreads throughout the muscle.  I've had MRI_ x-rays_ and more and they showed nothing wrong.  I'm also fatigued_ sensitive to heat_ and I can't tell you when the last time I slept all night.  I would get awake at least every other hour throughout the night. My urine is getting darker in color the longer I take it.  Over the past couple of months I have been experiencing confusion.,"I finally decided to look up ""TRICOR and muscle pain"" on the internet and thank God for this website.

55, 1, High Triglicerides,Side effects manifested very slowly.  They were a general sense of fatigue_ an aversion to exercise and muscle pains.  They came on so slowly that I didn't realize it was the tricor until later.  The side effects went away_ also very slowly after ceasing to take the medication.  Controling Trigs with Fish Oil and CoQ10 now. Feel much better.,Also_ I was diagnosed with a cardiac myopathy after taking this med for two years.  I feel the two may be connected because the heart muscle (that was damaged) is the same as all the rest of the muscles in your body (which many are reporting to be damaged from this med).

I get a blood test done every 3-4 months.  For the last year_ with no diet changes or weight changes_ my trigs have slowly been creeping back up.  I'm thinking the medicine is no longer working for me_ but doctor says to keep taking.  I started taking an Omega-3 supplement and at the last check_ trigs were down 20 pts.  I think it was the Omega-3 and not the tricor that helped.  I'm going to talk to doctor again about quitting Tricor.  I had no bad side effects other than the flu-like symptoms at first.  I want to try exercise and good eating rather than taking this too.,,F,31,4  years,7/19/2009,Tricor (micronized)

Well the last week while on a trip for work_ I didn't plan right and ran out of Tricor_ and so I did not take it for 3 days while I will still on my trip.  I have not refilled the prescription yet and I have now been off it for 10 days.

60, 1, High Triglycerides,I started taking TRICOR (145 mg) every morning about a year ago. I was okay at first and could continue my two mile a day walk carrying two ten pounds weights. I would go to my office first_ which was on the second floor of our building then do my walk. One day after my walk I started walking up to the  second floor and my left knee went out. It felt like someone stabbed me with an ice pick. A week later my left hip did the same thing_ then my left shoulder. I had to give up all exercise and could not sleep at night because of joint pain. I asked my Dr. if it could be the TRICOR having read this forum. He said no way and_ that it was probably due to my weight. Im 65 and weigh 245. I did not like his answer and went to see a sports medicine Dr. He took x-rays of my knees and said they looked to be in great shape with no damage. I also had an MRI of my shoulder and ditto. I then bought a new $3_000 mattress thinking maybe it was our bed.  All along_ I keep taking TRI,I went back to my doctor two or three more times and he still said it could not possibly be the TRICOR. I finally stopped taking it about a week ago and now I can at least walk around a flat block at a slow pace with minimal pain. My joint pains seems to be slowly going away_ but I fear I have done some permanent damage as my back hurts more than ever. Im sixty-one years old and TRICOR made me feel like Im ninety-one. I hate my Dr. for doing this to me and will not go back. In my opinion TRICOR can cause very serious problems. The manufacturer says to see your doctor if you have serious side effects. My Dr. turned a deaf ear on my concerns. For some_ Im sure it works. For me it was debilitating and I wish I had taken myself of it sooner.I think doctors are afraid to say anything against this medicine and that to me is a crime!,M,61,1  years,6/19/2009Email,Tricor (micronized)

I knew my doctor would push a statin drug after the nurse called with my blood test results. So I wanted to get patient info since i had serious suspicions in taking a statin or any rx for that matter. Notice how when patients report pain and other side affects the doc prescribes a hydrocodine to relieve pain_ not addressing the cause just the symptoms and usually by prescribing another drug. This is one of the most addictive substances (Opiate Based pain killers)known to man. This is the same old Allopathic school of medicine that doctors are indoctrinated into by utilizing regulatory agencies to control the education of Doctors. The same ones who brought you the cut slash and burn method of cancer control.,additional google searches: Dr. Russell Blaylock M.D. author of Exitotoxins the Taste that Kills_ Murder By Injection written by Eutace Mullins_ G. Edward Griffin author and lecturer of A World Without Cancer the Story of Vitamin B-17I would try exercise and diet before taking any medication from a doctor of Allopathic school.

This site is awesome for this purpose. To get info on drugs from real people who have used them and not be limited to web sites and doctors funded by big pharma that spout nothing but benefits for the drug and hide the truth of toxic side effects.,M,29,0  days,2/5/2009Email,Tricor (micronized)
87, 3, High Triglycerides,I've taken this drug for 10 years_ along with Niaspan. It worked great. Triglyceride numbers were way down! Within the last 6 months I have developed fatigue_ muscle aches and horrible nausea and indigestion.  My doctor_ after trying everything_ wondered aloud whether it could be the Tricor or maybe the Niaspan.  After enduring an upper GI endoscopy (which I had to pay for) and finding nothing...I decided to stop taking both drugs.  Within 3 days I was feeling like the old me - and I could eat again!  Last nite I took a tricor just to see...the first 8 hours were fine_ then the nausea and gas returned. I'm off of this stuff.  I'm now looking for other options.  Thank you for this website.,It's hard to rate a drug that actually worked but made me sick!,F,61,10  years,1/29/2009,Tricor (micronized)

It has brought my triglycerides down from the 400's to the 230 range.  In reading the comments on this site I am coming to realize that a lot of the pain issues I seem to be going through are probably a result of the drug although my GP has made the same comments to me that the drug is probably not the root cause.

Had some tingling in fingers last week. Lower back pain.  The elbow thing keeps getting worse and finally it dawned on me it all happened about a month after taking this crapola. I am on my 4th month. Today will be my last. My trigs were 644 and it did lower it down but not worth no sex drive and bad elbow pain.,After reading all these comments it has royally pissed me off.  Word_ next time things don't seem right. Go with your gut and look at what has changed recently. It may be the meds you have been prescribed.  All I can say is this elbow pain better go away and the sex drive better come roaring back or somebody is going to get a can of it !

98, 1, High Triglycerides and Cholesterol,The only side effect from the Tricor for the first year was minor tiredness and muscle fatigue. During the 2nd year I began to experience joint pain in both knees and then the pain expanded to all joints. By the end of the 2nd year I moved like an old man always after setting (almost total body soreness). The soreness would lessen while moving_ but I have a desk job.  The fatigue increased and I needed naps throughout the day when possible_ but I am still working. Toward the end of the 2nd year the bone pain began. I got fed up and quit taking Tricor.,My triglycerides were around 450 and cholesterol 300. The Tricor dropped the triglycerides to ~150 and my total cholesterol to ~140. My HDL to LDL ratio remained low. The minor tiredness and muscle fatigue could easily be overcome with exercise. When the joint pain began in the 2nd year I did not associate my joint pain with Tricor. I increased my mineral supplements and started taking hyaluronic acid they initially overcame the joint pain and increased fatigue. When I started Trico I could physically work all day_ but by the end of the second year I may have had two hours of stamina. When the bone pain began it finally clicked that my problem could be medicine induce. After finding this wonderful website and reading other patients reviews of Tricor I stopped taking the medicine. It took eight weeks for all of my symptoms to leave. I feel like a new man.

The side effects tooks years to add up on me. Finally my liver tests came back and my Dr took me off Tricor about 6 weeks ago. First I slept for 3 days ahd had extreme joint pains. My Dr thought I was nuts and gave me antibiotics for the ""flue"". But now_ I have more energy than I have had in years! I no longer need 2-3 naps a day. I no longer race home to get a nap after work and before anything else. In fact_ my hous off work seem so long now that I do not know how to keep myself busy and must restucture my life for this NORMAL ENERGY that I have now. I will never take this medicine again. For the last 5 years_ I have had this daily fight to have enough energy to have a decent life. Many times I was so tired at work that I just put my head in my hands and prayed I did not get fired.

I went to the ER and the PVC's had stopped for the time being.  I was referred to a Cardiologist and got a Holter monitor.  I showed I had the PVC's_ but not to worry_ I was only having 3-5/day.  I did not want any.  The only thing I attributed this to was the Tricor.  I went off the Tricor by myself and the PVS stopped in 2 days and I have been fine since.  This medicine is horible.  I now take Omega 3 pills.,M,38,2  weeks,2/25/2008,Tricor (micronized)

Back pain got worse and the past week I have barely been able to sit for long without extreme pains in back and knees.

146, 1, High Triglycerides,I had quite a few side effects from this medication.  I know they were caused by the medicine because I took myself off of it and within 72 hours most of the side effects either were gone or were improved.  The main problems follow in no particular order:  1. Sun sensitivity which caused me to get sunburns on cloudy days -- being of Mediteranean ancestry_ I've never burned before even in the mid-summer sun.  2. I gained 25 pounds in 5 months without changing my diet or my daily workout at the gym (all of it around my mid-section). 3. Extreme pain in my shoulders to the point where I could not lift my arm over my head without severe pain.  4. I constantly felt bloated_ as though I had over-eatern. 5.  Fatigue_ both mental and physical.  This started within a few days of being on the drug.  6. After a couple of weeks_ I began having an inability to stay asleep despite the fatigue -- I would sleep for about 40 minutes_ then wake up for 5 to 10 minutes before falling asleep again and repea,I started with triglycerides that were nearly 200 points too high.  The medicine did lower the triglycerides by about 100 points in the 5 months I was on it_ but the number was still over 100 points too high.  I took myself off of the medicine 4 weeks ago and now most of the side effects are gone.  The feelings of bloating and fullness went away after about 48 hours and the inability to lift my arm above my head went away in 72 hours.  The sun sensitivity ended in around 72 hours as well.  I have lost 12 pounds in the 4 weeks Ive been off of the medicine_ again without changing my diet or my workout routine.  The headache pattern is back to normal now.  I am able to stay asleep at night_ though I am still feeling fatigued.

159, 1, Substitute for pain-causing Lipitor,My left knee seized up_ swelled_ got hot_ causing painful walking by day and inability to lie on my side at night. I have to lie on my back and seek comfort from the pain by moving my legs constantly. The pain runs up from my knee to my hip. It seems that every muscle in my right thigh is involved. I have no pain in any other limb or muscle. Today is day 10 and there is no sign of it to go away. This was not a gout attack; my uric acid level_ clinically measured two weeks before the episode in question_ was 5.5 mg/dl--that is_ righ in the mid range of normal. But the pain in the left knee resembled a very severe gout attack nonetheless. I know what a gout attack is_ having had gout for years. I now take Allopurinol for it. Analgesics seem to have little effect in relieving this pain. I've tried Ibuprofen_ Acetaminophen and Naproxen.,My doctor put me on Tricor in June of 2007 and_ because of pain in my left thigh muscles_ I had to give it up after a few days. I reported this to the doctor on my next visit and he put me back on pain-causing Lipitor (he had put me on Lipitor at an earlier date and I had to give that up too). I tried Lipitor for a few days second time round and got the same pains in my left thigh muscles. Gave it up. Told the doctor. He prescribed Tricor once more! This time_ disaster struck.

181, 2, High triglycerides & colestrol,For more than a year and half I was on Zocor_ did a great job on the cholestrol but hardly any effect on the trig_ but began having such serious muscle cramps doctor put me on Tricor. About a week ago I began having severe knee pains_ but could not remember twisting or stretching it in any way that would have caused the pain.  I used a knee brace to be able to walk for two days til the pain subsided.  Then this past week the other knee began with the same pains and I realized that it might be caused by the Tricor and began researching side effects. I have also had severe lower back pains but never considered the possibility of it being associated with the Tricor til reading others coments.,After having been on Tricor for over 90 days and getting my first lab results with fantastic reduction in Trig_ it is disappointing that I will have to stop this medicine_ but the knee and joint pain is too great to continue.,M,50,120  days,8/7/2007,Tricor (micronized)

I have noticed an increase in hot flashes_ however - which seems to be related here.  However_ if I can get the insomnia under control by taking it during the day_ hot flashes are not that horrendous of a side-effect to put up with_ and may go away with continued use.  At this point I'm desperate for something that will lower my cholesterol since there are stroke events on both sides of my family.

228, 4, High Trigs and Chol/ Low good chol,Thank you all for your feedback. It really helps. I guess people react differently to this med. I just began taking it a week ago. I don't know how it will affect my high triglicerides_ high cholesterol and low good cholesterol until I go for lab work in a couple of weeks. The only significant side effect has been pain in both my elbows similar to tennis elbow. However_ something really extraordinary has been hapening. I've suffered from mayor depression for most of my life and currently take 2 meds for that (very low dosages) still feeling a low grade depression. I don't know if there is any scientific explanation for this_ but I feel my depression lifting. I feel calmer and a sense of wellbeing. This could be a placebo effect_ but I began taking tricor without even thinking it would have any effect in my depression or Dysthimia. If there is anyone out there who could explain this_ I'll really appreciate it. So... I think I can put up with this elbow pain and continue to experience th,,F,51,1  weeks,10/17/2006Email,Tricor (micronized)

I am somewhat amazed at a poster above who recommends everyone take this ""medicine."" I would sooner tell someone to step out in front of a bus...at least the pain would be over quick and fast.  At this point_ it has been nearly two years and my debility has not improved at all. I have learned to live with the weakness_ fatigue and severe pain in my lower extremities_ but it's pretty darn sad that before I took this medication_ the only thing wrong with me was high triglycerides.  I cannot believe this medication remains on the market after reading all the comments here_ the bad far outweighs any good this ""medication"" has ever done by reading these comments.

259, 1, High Triglycerides,I'm only 25_ but my doctor told me that my elevated triglycerides were genetic; they were about 900. Thought that I had muscle pain_ turns out that it was a blood clot. I'm not sure if there is a link to the medicine or not. Clots seem rare for someone my age_ as well as taking tricor; I'm not even that overweight. Also have noticed about 50% less vitality and weakness in my muscles_ but all test results come up clear. Lately_ the worse has started. My stomach has seemed to basically stop working. Food seems to sit there without digesting and bowel movement remain unsolid for days at a time. Tests also showed no cause for this problem.,Here is the best part. Doctor is switching me to Niaspan. He says my triglyceride levels have not fallen at all... At All! I am so glad that I took the risk of death or perminant damage to see such wonderful results; my triclyceride level is still 900_ even with 180 mg daily. Doctors ever consider that maybe some people need these? It seems my body is adjusting to return my higher levels because I have begun to feel better as they rebuild. My opinion is that they are important. The problem is that we need to utilize them with proper activities.

Fatigue seems to be creeping back up as it did when I took zocor_ but not to that degree.  My AST also went up from 30 to 99 which is a bad thing.  I attribute this to the tricor but waiting for the results from my sonogram to verfify.,I think there are way too many uncertainties around tricor and the statins that will produce very serious longterm effects.

I've tried Lipitor_ Gemfibrizol and Niaspan_ but Tricor is the only one that put a dent in my numbers.  Also_ Niaspan gave me mild gastritis and Lipitor gave me numbness in my chin.  I am VERY happy with the results of Tricor.,M,36,6  weeks,5/10/2005Email,Tricor (micronized)

282, 5, High Triglycerides/Cholesterol,After the first few days that I was on TriCor 145 mg I had some muscle cramps in my right leg for several days. I stayed off the med for a week and tried the TriCor again as ordered by my doctor. I have been on this med for almost two months and have not had any side effects. The only thing I changed was to take the TriCor in the evening after dinner instead of in the morning after breakfast. I just got back my blood test results and they are truly amazing! My triglycerides went down from 368 to 70_ and my total cholesterol also went down from 240 to 182. It's truly a miracle drug. Hopefully I won't get anymore leg cramps_ and that it was just a coincidense of that happening.,Try it.....it's worth it! God Bless.,F,52,2  months,5/5/2005Email,Tricor (micronized)
283, 1, hi triglycerides,I only took two pills - had mild arm muscle pains.  After stopping_ muscle aches got worse_ especially in upper thighs.  It's now 12 days since stopping the medicine_ and the aches have not gone away -- though they move around on my body.,Can anyone help with advice?  I'm alarmed the aches continue 12 days after taking pill.  But maybe bodies react different.  I've had a strong reaction to just 2 pills.  Anyone know a doctor FAMILIAR with tricor side effects in the northeast?  cdurang8@aol.com   thanks,M,56,2  days,4/21/2005Email,Tricor (micronized)
284, 2, fam hypertriglyeridemia/hi cholestr,severe pain like a truck hit me at full speed.  Every muscle hurt_ including my legs and feet which are the worst. Headaches_ insomnia_ itching_ and tired. Can I work through the pain? If dose is dropped (I'm taking 145mg Tricor),The pain at first I ignored as my fybromyalgia but it got so intense I thought I'd be in a will chair by the end of the day.  Really want some medication that helps and that works with less side effects! Lopid is not helping enough.  Is there anything safer out there that works well to bring down triglyerides and cholesterol by pharmancies and/or natural means you see of websites that aren't approved by the FDA?  Help!!,F,38,3  days,4/18/2005Email,Tricor (micronized)
285, 2, try to raise HDL,Lot of trouble sleeping lately_ wierd dreams but certainly not nightmares...,Tried Niaspan first_ but that was not raising HDL enough_ though the othere levels were very good; but MD wanted me to try Tricor....I'm due to get results of bloodwork since starting Tricor_ & unless the results are dramatic_ I will ask to go back to Niaspan....All things being equal_ much rather take Niaspan over Tricor.....,M,35,2  months,4/7/2005,Tricor (micronized)
286, 1, My Triglycerides are high at 368,TriCor 145 mg gave me muscle spasms and severe leg cramps in my right leg especially around my knee area to the point where I could not walk when it happened. The cramping in my leg started after only the third day I was on it. I stuck it out for 10 days but had to stop it because the leg muscle pains where happening every day. My doctor wants me to stop taking it for a few days to see if I still have the leg cramps_ and to continue back on the TriCor again. I'm not.,I also have had horrible nightmare dreams_ stomach cramps_ lower back pain_ and dry mouth when I wake up while on TriCor. I hope they will come out with another med for Triglycerieds because this one stinks!,F,52,10  days,4/2/2005,Tricor (micronized)

288, 1, Hypertriglyceridemia,I started having severe fatigue and then abrupt onset of lower extremity pain_ first in right leg_ then left_ then in upper extremities.  This was accompanied by terrible muscle spasms throughout my entire body.,All of this culminated in loss of time from work_ visits to ER_ and extreme emotional distress because no one could find out what was wrong. My doctor finally zeroed in on the Tricor.  A terrible time.,F,56,3  months,2/25/2005Email,Tricor (micronized)

290, 1, High triglycerides,After taking 160mg daily for 5 weeks_ I began feeling very weak and fatigued. Reported weakness to my doctor and was told to discontinue use.  Symptoms resided with the exception of muscle weakness in my left leg when I'm tired.  I have not taken Tricor for 7 weeks.  Dr wants me to take lower dosage of Tricor_ but I'm apprehensive.,,F,41,5  weeks,1/5/2005,Tricor (micronized)
291, 5, high triglycerides,Occasional gallbladder pain. Occasional abdominal discomfort. Neither annoying enough to make me want to go off the drug.,My triglycerides at their worst were over 350. [Rest of my cholesterol readings have always been normal.] Gemfibrozil made things worse and gave me intense gall bladder pain. Lower dosage (80 mg) of Tricor worked for awhile and then stopped. I've now been taking Tricor 160 mg for 18 months and my triglycerides have been well within normal. Overall_ I am very pleased with my results with this drug.,F,49,18  months,1/4/2005,Tricor (micronized)

293, 1, Prescribed for high cholesterol,My husband began with severe vomiting after two weeks of starting Tricor.  Then began to lose appetite and feel nauseated. Could not eat.  Heavily fatigued. Vomited 14 hours once.  Lost weight rapidly and began talking incoherently.   We still didn't connect it to Tricor.  Then began running fever_ severe chills_ pains in gallbladder/liver region.  Went to ER_ to our surprise_ they diagnosed bacterial infection and severely high liver enzyme levels (over 400).  Two weeks prior to taking Tricor_ liver enzymes were 12 and 14!  Was advised to see his physician immediately which he did 2 days later.  Dr. took him off Tricor_ all symptoms subsided_ tenderness in liver went away_ fever left_ jaundice left_ appetite returned.  Tricor just about killed him_ I compare it to taking Drano.,This stuff is nasty and can kill you.  Better to have high cholesterol and take your chances than to be killed off by it.,F,59,6  weeks,12/21/2004Email,Tricor (micronized)
