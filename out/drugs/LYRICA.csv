1, 3, Neurological pain multiple sclerosi,Brain fog. Difficulty speaking. Vertigo_ swelling of legs and feet to the point that shoes don't fit_mania_ difficulty sleeping..but always feel fatigued.,Since I have rrms I am not sure which are side effects are from lyrica or maybe a coincidence and is from my existing condition. During a dizzy spell I went to the fridge for a drink not sure how but I think I temporarily blacked  out and did a face plant into the counter. Have a terrible bruise on my chin and chipped my tooth (to side of front left tooth). Thanks a lot lyrica and  Maine government officials that think this horrible drug is better than the narcotics I could take and would not have these side effects and would also help my severe chronic pain more than the tiny bit of pain relief I have had with this weird drug that I'm sure idiotic people will abuse.

They more or less told me there's nothing they can do for me if I won't try the med. Wish I hadn't! The first couple months I thought I'd finally found my miracle drug --- it really took care of the pain. But required adjusting dosage upwards every 3-4 weeks_ as pain soon returned. I would have continued this med if all I'd had was the weight gain. But the other side effects make this med intolerable.  If you're on it and want off_ taper down very slowly. It says on the Rx-info insert to taper off for a minimum of 1 week_ which I did. HA! I'm going through hell now that I've been off it completely for only a few days: nausea_ diarrhea_ vomiting_ alternating hot and cold flashes_ anorexia_ insomnia_ severe anxiety.

132, 1, neuropathy due to Cauda Equina Synd,Lyrica did help with my moderate to severe neuropathy from a failed back surgery that resulted in Cauda Equina Syndrome. The side effects were awful_ however: severe constipation_ terrible nightmares (I already have some PTSD from a major accident and Lyrica made the nightmares blood drenched and horrible)_ 25 pound weight gain_ peeling skin_ swollen ankles_ and the worst was the brain fog and lethargy. I'm a high school teacher and I couldn't remember the names of my students. I'd bog down in lessons_ having no idea what I was supposed to say next. I thought I had brain damage from the major accident that started all of this. Looking back on it now_ I became a lobotomized zombie and didn't know how bad it all was until I started weaning off the stuff and began to get my brain function back!,I completely weaned off of 400 mg/ day over about 3 months in 25 mg increments. The withdrawal was absolute hell- way worse than weaning off oxycodone. I felt incredibly agitated_ couldn't sleep_ my skin was crawling. I had massive panic attacks- never had them before this. I became very depressed_ crying all the time_ and suicidal. It was several weeks after my last dose that I started feeling normal again. I use Lidocaine patches_ Aleve_ Tylenol_ and low dose oxycodone to deal with my neuropathic pain. I have more of it than when I was on Lyrica but I have my brain back and I no longer feel like a zombie. Be very careful with this drug! Think twice! Thrice! before you increase your dosage! If you have neuropathy_ try Lidocaine patches and Gabapentin before you touch Lyrica. If you are trying to wean off of Lyrica_ switch back to an equivalent dose of Gabapentin and wean off of that because it's easier since the effective dose of the smallest dose of Gabapentin (100 mg) is smaller than the smallest available dose of Lyrica (25 mg). If you have access to narcotics_ get off of Lyrica before you wean off of them because they will help dull the withdrawal from Lyrica. I will never touch this stuff again! I'd rather live with the pain.,F,44,7  months100 4X D,9/5/2014Email,Lyrica
133, 5, Nerve damage by severe scoliosis,The first thing I noticed after starting Lyrica was the intense relief of nerve pain. I have significant nerve damage from severe scoliosis_ and the three surgeries that have tried to control it's progression. I've been dealing with it and seeing pain doctors for it since I was 24. When I say I've tried it all_ I mean it. It's not the only pain med I use_ I use it in conjunction with the Duragesic patch_ but before adding Lyrica to it_ the relief from the nerve damage (not muscle or skeletal pain) went unchecked. Stabbing pain from my hips down my legs. Ever since starting Lyrica_ I can have a semi-normal life again. I only have to use my cane when I know I'll be walking a lot  (i.e. Son's band competitions_ flea market_ etc.) my only real complaint is the mental fog that keeps me from remembering things. I'll forget grocery items_ or not be able to recall a word. It's nothing huge_ but it can be annoying. I've learned (as have others around me) to take it in stride. I adjust_ use lists and reminders. If that's the trade off for my mobility_ I'll take it!,,F,38,3  years100 mg x 2,9/4/2014,Lyrica

But missing a year of life caught up in my head_ a developing age for many to go out and fulfill their potential with progress. I on the other hand regressed_ as I made no progress and aged at the same time_ thus causing me mentally to be a year younger than I actually am! In addition I could not perform well in school_ constantly had mental breakdowns and over-all depression. Not the type of depression SSRI's are prescribed for_ it was the type of depression that (not comparing my self to people who serve in the military) a trooper over seas loses an arm in an explosion.

140, 4, Fibromyalgia,Weight gain at a rate of 5 lbs a year_ vision problems_ attention/memory issues becoming less severe over time.,I believe this is a last ditch drug but for those who have tried everything for fibro pain_ Lyrica worked for me. The first 6 months I did have memory and attention problems. I still have some trouble finding a familiar word occasionally (and I have always had good vocabulary skills). I am more relaxed.  I sleep better. I did run out of Lyrica once when I was required through my insurance to do mail order. It was 3 days of cold turkey and I will never forget it. Like the flu with no fever. Fidgety_ no sleep_ sweating_ stayed in bed. As soon as my prescription showed up my husband ran in and gave me a pill. I felt 100% better in one hour. People_ my fibro pain is almost gone except for a few flare ups. I can go to flea markets again and I clean my own house. I don't have to work at a job but I can manage our finances fine. I can still do math in my head which is something I was afraid I'd lose at first.  I did gain weight but enough was enough. I started dieting with the addition of yogurt to my diet every day. Lost 4 lbs in a month.  No hair loss here. Most of my major side effects have lessened significantly and I drive myself everywhere. I have not had a wreck or a ticket. My fibro pain is so much better and I hear Lyrica will go generic in 2019. The biggest fear is forced withdrawal if I forgot to bring enough meds on a trip or run out again. Anyone who has been on Lyrica for a year and says you can quit Lyrica by just stopping cold turkey is not telling the truth.,F,56,5  years150 3X D,7/5/2014,Lyrica
141, 1, S1 Nerve Root Displacement,,Went to the doctor due to reaction to only one dose of Lyrica. She tried to pass off my reaction to an anxiety attack asking me if I had experienced anxiety before. After I told her that I knew the difference then she switched to menopause. I have already been through that with really no issues due to hysterectomy. Next she said maybe I was having a migraine. I know how I felt with each of those and those were not causing my problem. She then said I should probably see my Neurologist since they couldn't prescribe Topamax_ as it was not for nerve pain. I read that it is used for migraines and nerve pain as well as other problems. My daughter asked if drinking a lot of fluids could help flush it out quicker and she went on to say that it was passed through my liver and would have to just wear off. I checked and Lyrica is passed through the kidneys_ not liver. I think I know more than this doc. Won't see her again if my PCP is not in the office. Basically wasted my copay. By later in afternoon I felt more like myself again_ and the next day fine with no Lyrica. That drug for me is satan.

162, 2, Post Op Neuralgia after Jaw Surgery,Initally I had just dizzyness in the first week and I fell over a couple of times. By the second week I noticed fluid buildup in legs. Third week I and got extremely depressed_ going to sleep and never waking up seemed like a completely plausible solution. Fourth week I lowered my dose to 75mg just at night_ then began to wean myself off_ because I decided that the side effects were not worth the small amount of pain reduction I was getting_ which was about 30%. I got off for two entire weeks and then after revisting my doctor_ who advised me Lyrica was the only treatment for nerve pain available_ I caved and went back on for one more try_ because the burning in my face and chin was unbearable and I couldn't concentrate on anything else at all. I've now been back on it for an additional 2 weeks_ just 75mg at night_ initally I took 3 in a 36 hours period for the first two days to get a level in my system. All this week I have had a annoying niggling headache present all the time_ I can,I also use bio-identical hormone replacement_ following a hysterectomy 3 years ago_ which to this point has been working fantastically against the adverse effects of menopause_ but this week I am experiencing hot flashes when I had zero before_ so maybe co-incidental_ but I think Lyrica messes with your hormone levels_ even though it's not a listed side effect_ also I have been constipated throughout and need to take laxitives to resolve it.So I have decided that Lyrica is not for me and I will begin to wean off again. This drug is Dodgy with a capital D. It has been 70 days since my surgery today. I was not told of the possibility of long term neuralgic pain_ post surgery by anyone. I have researched and discovered there are others now_ but it is too late for me_ I have to deal with it.  My pain has only reduced about 50% in two months_ I have no idea how long i will have to endure it. But I am just going to have to do it_ because the side effects from Lyrica far out weigh the small benefits of pain reduction. I read the Lyrica effects your teeth_ so since I have spent about $10_000 trying to save mine_ it's probably not a good idea to be taking something that has a negative effect on them. Pfizer you should be ashamed_ promoting a drug that has such awful side effects and not mentioning any one of them in your promotion to Medical Professionals.

164, 4, Pain and insomnia,Increased my moderate-severe anxiety and panic disorder at first and I found that taking my Xanax half an hour later I did just fine. I didn't like the empty feeling I had (some might call it a high I considered it uncomfortable) but even that went away and the pain was not gone but it was far more tolerable. Doctor switching me to Gabapentin now.,The side effects went away after several days but it also stopped helping quite as much as the side effects wore off. Worth trying in my opinion. I think it important to time taking the medication with other medications you may be on. I have panic attacks and this med increased that so I doubled up on my Xanax (but that is an option my doctor left open to me when she prescribed it) until I realized that if I just waited about a half hour to take the one Xanax after the Lyrica then they kicked in together and I didn't have the anxiety that forced me to double up. Everyone is different so it may not be for everyone but it was worth the try for me. Now I am switching to Gabapentin for both the pain_ insomnia_ an add on to the Zoloft for low grade depression.,F,39,10  days100mg 2X D,3/13/2014Email,Lyrica

Hard to take as I teach dance and yoga for a living! Lyrica relieved the pain in 24 hours and I was thrilled. But these side affects were too much to take. Asked the Dr. to take me off of Lyrica mid-November and I tapered off over 8 days. All was good until 24 hours after cessation_ the leg pain returned and I could not walk again. So I went back on it_ starting with a larger dose of 225mg 2 times per day. Soon realized the side effects were still an issue. I asked the Dr. to provide various dosage sizes so I could monitor the drug myself: 25 mg & 75 mg. For 4 months I settled into 75 mg in the evening to help sleep and 25 during the day to help my focus issues. I have also gained some weight (8 lbs.) and my hair is thinning around my face (temples and forehead). When I saw my hairdresser she noted my hair felt ""dead"" and coated and remarked that she sees this type of reaction in others taking anti-depressants and a few other drugs. I have been experiencing shoulder and arm pain for about 3 months_ especially at night making it difficult to fall asleep. Although my customized dosage is lower than most_ the side effects persist.

225, 3, Chronic daily headaches,25 mg is slower to kick in to work.  However it does keep the pain away.  Have to watch what you eat. Important  be on a diuretic daily to counter to the fluid retention. That helps weight gain of fluid but watch what you eat.   A little acne to the face.  Lower dose minimized side effects.  Comes in 25_ 50 and 75 mg.,At first given 75 mg 2 x day.  That dose was too much.  Many side effects on higher dose.  On lower dose rash has calmed down.  Acne on face is able to be handled unlike at higher dose.  Hair does not fall out as much. Benefit is pain free for a few hours from chronic headaches.  Does not stop migraines.,F,53,1  months25 3X D,12/28/2012,Lyrica

It put me in some type of spin. Can't even explain it but now that my mind is coming out of this strange fog I'm putting some things together. Reading back on old texts messages_ talking with people. I can't believe this stuff is even on the market. This company should have their asses sued off & be splattered all over the TV. I'm still in a state of shock. I was so excited to think something may help some of my pain (which sadly it was)! I was totally naive in reading up on it which I'm usually doing on a lot of subjects. It started working so fast I didn't even realize I didn't have drive to research it. Just kept taking it everyday. Headaches are still there_ have never had a headache this long & it's a strange feeling one.

241, 5, Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Dry mouth_ euphoria and stoned feeling at first. Went away.,This drug has been approved for Generalized Anxiety for the last 7 years in Europe. It blocks the production of glutamate_ substance p_ and noradrenaline_ all of which underlie neural excitation_ fight or flight_ and hence anxiety. By blocking these neurontansmitters_ it acts as an ANALOG of gaba_ the inhibiting neurotransmitter whose receptors benzodiazepines work on. As such it works differently from benzos_ has fewer side effects_ and doesn't cause dependency. Most importantly_ IT WORKS!!!! If you've been suffering from Anxiety_ and your doctor keeps piling on the prozac to no effect_ do yourself a favor and ask him to look at the literature on Lyrica and anxiety_ and also what exactly Lyrica does to the brain_ which makes it an obvious antidote. This is truly great drug for this condition and needs to be taken seriously.,M,35,1  months100mg 3X D,8/28/2012,Lyrica

At one point my Rheumatoligist had me on 450mg of Lyrica daily. I am currently bedridden and my Primary care Dr. and I have a plan in progress to get me off of all medication. I can't possibly feel any worse. I spend many weeks per year in the hospital_ and it seems each time all the Dr.'s want to do is ADD or increase medication. I have been weening off of Lyrica for 3 months now and will be totally off of it in a week or so. I will then ween off of others (mainly Cymbalta_ which in itself is a nightmare as well - with a story of it's own!).

The nerve 'dampening' of the drug also worked on the nerves that cause P.E._ apparently. (Or just E._ if you will.)  If this drug weren't so dangerous to most people I would say it is the new Viagra (but different).  It is extreme.  It diminished the stabbing pain of the Shingles and I felt normal but a little dizzy from time to time. I could get an erection no problem_ it was just finding the elusive orgasm that took so long.

266, 1, Neuropathic pain,Daily migraine with nausea_ stomach ache_ dizzy and 'out of it feeling'.,I fought against taking this drug for over two years_ but  years of insomnia due to pain finally convinced me to try it. I started with 50 mg at night but about three hours before next dose_ I got a migraine/nausea. So I was told to take an additional dose of 25 mg in morning. The dizziness_ out-of-balance feeling in daytime worsened and the migraine became horrible.   I had a history of (monthly) migraine_ usually only the aura without much pain. But now it was daily terrible migraine. I went off the drug more suddenly than my doctor advised_ but I reasoned I was already suffering the max.  But I was wrong. The  24 hour migraine got worse. I spent over a month  ( after Lyrica) with my face in a pillow to shut out light and any loud sounds. Thanks heavens for a supportive husband who read to me to help pass the time. We thought I would be better in a couple of weeks..no! it was over a month of HELL.   I know there is a few on this forum that have had OK results_ but there are far too many who have had serious reactions.   Doctors do not always know what's best. My gut or intuition told me NOT to try this but I did.  My heart goes out to all of you sufferers.   My husband urged me to see a Naturopath and acupuncturist.  I have been in this treatment for two weeks and am getting better. My pains in back and legs are relieved enabling me to sleep and the migraine is receding.

(ALL Antidepressants make me extremely depressed_ and benzos don't work very well for my anxiety and panic disorder) Anyway_ I have found that all side effects so far have been positive ones. I have slightly increased appetite_ and increased libido - both good things for me because I also have anxiety driven hypertension and my BP meds sometimes mess with my libido. I'm also a thin guy_ and the slight increase in appetite is a god thing!","Lyrica has been a wonder drug for me! I have tried SO many medications over the years to get my anxiety under control. As mentioned previously_ I am atypical and benzos never worked that well_ and I discovered by accident when I had my vasectomy that lortab 100% got rid of my anxiety_ and I could also think clearly and felt good from the ""warm"" opiate buzz. I also have a bad knee that makes walking painful after more than 15 or 20 minutes (it swells) so I got a script for lortab and took it for 4 years_ and of course became dependant on them. Coming off any opiate after 4 years isn't fun - but Lyrica got me off them with absolutely NO withdrawl and no bad side effects. I have been taking it for 3 weeks so far_ and absolutely love it!

It took a month to get off due to horrible withdrawl and another month for my hair to stop falling out. Stay away from this med.....,F,48,4  months150mg 2X D,3/24/2012Email,Lyrica

No energy to do much.  I have made an appt and will be going off this Lyrica next week.  This site has helped me make my decision.,AT the beginning Lyrica was the drug for me.  It ceased my sciatica to a certain point.  The sciatica was never gone though.  I have recently started Bowen Therapy which actually relieved the sciatica.  I will continue with it.

I also didn't feel comfortable driving because of the feeling of having 1 to many beers.,I am cutting back to 100MG at bedtime over the next week. Had some problems with the 100MG dose but the problems increased greatly with the 200MG a day.

285, 1, Fibro,I thought lyrica was helping my pain. I was prescribed it twice a day_ but only took it once at night. I did gain weight and go through a period of losing my hair_ however i had been in so much pain for so long i stuck with it. After about 3 years i developed seizures then they stopped. Suddenly last year i developed grandmal seizures. I was out of it. I would nod out. Fall asleep everywhere_ couldn't drive or anything else for that matter. Then i ended up in the icu because no one could wake me. I was breathing normally however_ my lungs were not absorbing the oxygen i needed. No one knew why. I was in Icu 3 times last year. I have been to doctor after doctor who could not  tell me what was happening. Thank God i found a neurologist about 7 months ago who told me lyrica was shutting down parts of my brain. She got me off the lyrica and i had to use oxygen for about two months after i had quit taking it. now no more passing out and no more seizures since i quit taking it. It scares me,It was hard coming off the drug. But I feel so much better mentally now. No more seizures_ i now longer need oxygen and i feel like i have woken up from a four year dream.. I seem to have lost that time_ but thank God i can make some of that up now. I am no longer intrested in trying newer drugs. I agree with the man who said we need to be given opiates.

Have had steroid injections in my neck as well as median nerve ablation at the pain clinic - said No to recommended radiofrequency ablation because all of the other injections only worked the pain up to a higher frenzy.  Was put on Lyrica 2 years ago but stopped due to weight gain & only mild pain relief.  (It was hard going off because pain noticeably increased afterward.)  Newest neurologist put me back on Lyrica and same thing: 20 lb weight gain & mild pain relief.  I'm unable to increase dosage due to dizziness & fluid retention (legs blew up like balloons!)  I can however tell the difference between being on/off Lyrica and  decided to stay on because I can't find anything else that helps aside from botox injections for migraines (can only get injections every 3 months but so far they only last 6-8 weeks - and yes_ the injections in my neck & shoulders do help with some of the pain).,F,48,6  months75mg 2X D,1/30/2012,Lyrica

This is very helpful for me_ as not sleeping is a disaster for my health and well-being_ and this drug seems very safe. I won't take it forever_ but will continue as needed until hot flashes ease. If I miss a dose I do get a mild withdrawal problem_ where I feel nervous_ get extremely bad insomnia and sleep much worse than usual_ however this only lasts one night! I think it is important to say how small of a dose I need  just 25 mgs.

I wake up each day without the pain_ which has kicked in after 3-4pm every day for 10 years (ruined half my life during that time). At night_ it feels like an anvil attached to my ribs or a medieval press contraption.  So I'm willing to stay with the side effects of the drug_ but for how long? I suspect my condition is neuropathic or somatic. I can't find a physician who knows anything about it_ or even registers recognition of a disorder they've seen before.  Doctors are not the answer. And the older you get_ the less interesting you are to them when you ""present.""  I simply need to be more persistent and aggressive until I find the ""right"" therapist or doctor.

It was intolerable to continue on that dose.  I then tried to go down very_ very slowly over a period of 2 months_ hoping to find a dose that would give me the therapeutic effect without the bad side effects I had experienced so suddenly_ but I couldn't.

I was so crabby but I didn't realize it myself_ and I didn't feel unhappy_ just horribly nauseated_ vomiting_ extra pain in my hands and legs aside from awful abdominal pain.  I already have gastroparenthisis because a gastroenterologest damaged my vega nerve so the constipation was almost not fixable.

370, 5, Fibromyalgia,The first few weeks I was a little lightheaded but nothing compared to the misery I had encountered for the past 2 years.Up until I started taking Lyrica my entire body ached from head to toe including every joint and muscle.I was always fatigued even after a full nights rest.I occasionally get a dry mouth after taking Lyrica but I'll take this over the nightmare I experienced everyday of my life aching from head to toe. For me it was the magic pill that I was looking for. The only concern I have is how long it will work for me? Hopefully it will continue for as long as I need it. The only negative is that it can be expensive without insurance. Thank God for good insurance and RX plan. Good Luck to all those using Lyrica.,,M,53,90  days75 2X D,2/14/2011Email,Lyrica

372, 4, Seizure Disorder,Side effects have been minimal especially compared to other meds I took in the past. Yes there is increased cravings for food but developed a good exercise routine and have LOST weight on LYRICA (other anti-convulsants meds were much_ much worse with weight gain so my exercise/diet program I developed has overcome any issues with this med). No swelling and I welcome the sedating quality as I have severe insomnia. I also don't experience the memory issues that others are having (other meds I took were horrible and I couldn't spell my name on them!).,Compared to other drugs_ LYRICA has been a blessing. No seizures and minimal side effects. I'm sorry for the others who have experienced severe side effects but everyone IS different. I tried other meds and the side effects were too great which led me to try LYRICA so I do understand.,M,46,60  days100 2X D,2/13/2011Email,Lyrica
373, 3, Chronic Nerve Pain,Typically_ expect WEIGHT GAIN!!  Any person who says the weight gain comes entirely from eating too much has no idea what they are talking about.  I am in full control of what I eat but regardless I still steadily continue to see my weight increase (Even when I cut back on my daily food intake)  I came off of Lyrica for a period of time and the weight dropped back off. Other side effects I have experienced are chronic stomach bloating_ swelling & dizziness.,Lyrica has definitely helped my pain when no other drug could touch it.  In order to deal with some pain relief I have had to learn to deal with the side effects.  Each person has to weigh it all out and determine if it is worth it to them for their particulat situation.,F,45,1  years75 2X D,2/13/2011Email,Lyrica

I am also a diabetic on insulin_ and take multiple anti-deppresants. The chronic stiffness in my neck and body pains were relieved instantly from the first dose. I have tested myself by not taking a dose and the stiff neck comes back. I will update as time progresses.

375, 5, Fibromyasia,"I Have been so ""crippled"" since age 46.. I started Lyrica and  felt the throbbing leave my legs by day #4! I am able to walk and move with less pain!!! I did feel fuzzy in the first few days_ but well worth the trade off to be able to move. When I say I couldnt move I mean I had to have help at time just trying to get up from sitting_The aching had me in tears_ I was afraid to get into the tub in fear I couldnt get out. My legs were near useless_ like heavy painful pillars. when I wake my hands are not as stiff_ I have had slight swelling in fingers though and as I said the fog for the first few days. I feel like a new person! I can play with my grandchildren and not sit and lay all the time. I had tried cutting back on sugar_ and taking 5_000 of Vit D as directed by my Dr. I even had tried hydropap on my bad days and all I did was sleep from it.I thank the Lord for Lyrica_ I hope it will not wane and start to not work.",I was afraid I would have problem because I am on a BP medication_ as that was one of the side effects_ but so far Its been good.

376, 2, neuropathy in feet,I started taking Lyrica for the severe tingling/burning in the bottoms of both feet. My pain would become so severe that I felt like someone was smacking my feet with a 2x4 at night. I always feel euphoric_ lightheaded_ extremely blurry vision at times  so sleepy I cannot function more than 4 hours at a time without napping. The Lyrica lessened my pain somewhat but not enough to warrant these side effects I am stopping these meds immediately!!!,,F,49,8  months75mg 1X D,2/8/2011,Lyrica
377, 5, FIbromyalgia,So far I feel a bit floaty_ almost like my head is floating around_ but I kind of enjoy it. I am not feeling drunk as others put it. In fact thanks to the pain relief I have gotten so far...my mind is sharp as a tack and clear as can be. I notice a bit of foot swelling. I am hungry a lot more_ but I am not going to gain weight because I am under strict control of my diet and I won't give into the food cravings. It's easy to blame a drug for weight gain when the gain is because you got over hungry and ate_ not realizing it most of the time.,I do notice that it wears off the pain relief after about 11 hours. I believe this is because of the lower dose to start. I honestly don't get why half the people on here are on lyrica. It is meant for specific types of pain_ NERVE pain. Not joint pain_ not headaches_ not injuries or endometreosis. It is FDA approved for four uses: Fibromyalgia_ shingles pain_ diabetic neuropothy  and seizures of a certain type. Anything other than that you may have bad effects not because the drug is bad_ but if your nerves aren't causing the problem messing with them with this drug will make you feel worse_ not better. I advise anyone who takes this drug to drink plenty of water_ keep your feet up when you can_ walk as much as you can (water gain from edema can be helped this way sometimes) and make sure you track your food intake because it is so easy to rack up the pounds when you don't realize how much you have really ate (due to increased appetite). And if a doctor is prescribing it for anything other than these 4 conditions ask them is it fda approved for this? Many doctors get paid off to sell or push medications. You need to research every medication before you take it and make dang sure you are getting it for an approved use. Otherwise you can have issues like I did with a different medication.,F,34,2  days50 mg 2X D,2/4/2011Email,Lyrica

Only that I feel really drunk_ problems to keep my eyes open_ feel like sleeping_ which is not the best when you have to work.

Lyrica was prescribed to combat the problem_ and while it DID in fact improve my nerve pain_ it left me with much worse symptoms. I had trouble balancing_ could hardly walk_ always felt in a fog_ didn't make much sense_ had trouble remembering things_ felt very emotional... and in spite of all these negative side-effects_ it seemed that I was quickly developing a dependency. When it was close to time for my next dose_ my nerve pain would come back worse than before_ I'd get ringing in my ears_ growing headache--then all of this would go away shortly after taking a new pill. It was horrific! I called my pharmacist to ask about addictive properties of Lyrica and cried like a baby--which is totally unlike me! Finally my neurologist told me to stop taking it cold turkey since I was only on it for 10 days_ and I suffered 5 days of the worst withdrawal symptoms. Headache_ vomiting_ horrible nerve pain_ orthostatic problems--my mom had to watch my kids while I lay on the couch in misery for days on end. I am SO grateful to have gotten off this drug when I did_ and I will never take it again. However_ it screwed up my ears by causing a buildup of pressure in the middle ear canal (otis media_ i.e. ear infections_ are listed as a rare side-effect by the manufacturer)_ and it has taken over a year to correct itself; and I still get frequent infections as a result.

My usual dosage of Lyrica is 150mg x 2 daily.  I took 300mg_ smoked the joint_ and then consumed another 450mg of Lyrica.  Two hours later_ I've never felt so good in my entire life and I've tried many drugs including about every  opioid/opiate.  My pain level went from about an 8 to a 3. When marijuana and Lyrica are combined_ the effect is a high that's unexplainable_ not to mention I get a much needed relief from the pain that's ruining my life.  My friend and I watched playoff football and listened to music the rest of the day and I stayed euphoric for 4 hours.  When it finally wore off_ I felt like I had just taken a muscle relaxer as my limbs turned to complete jello!  If you're suffering from chronic pain_ fire up a joint and combine it with your Lyrica.

I had every nerve sensation that I had ever read about going up and down my leg.  Six months after my surgery_ I had lightening bolts going up and down my shin.  It was unbearable!  Within one day in which I took Lyrica_ I had relief.  I have read all the comments on this website and I don't see any comments regarding swelling around the eyes.  I developed unusual swelling underneath the bags under my eyes.  Thinking that it was from the Lyrica_ I called my neurologist office and they suggested that I go off Lyrica.  I immediately went off Lyrica_ but now 3 months later_ I still have unusual swelling under my eyes.  Now I don't think that it is from the Lyrica.  Has anyone else suffered unusual swelling around the eyes?  Unusual Swelling of the Scalp?  I never had suicidal thoughts while on Lyrica.

Given the side effects listed by most in this forum_ I wonder what is better or worse. How long can a person take lyrica? Do new side effects occur with long term use?

I rarely get the excruiating shooting_ lightning like pains down my leg into my feet. It seems to transform the sensation to a managable tingle. Previously this pain would make my leg give way but I cannot remember the last time this happened.It is definately worth sticking with it for a while to see how good it is at pain reduction. Side effects do diminish! I understand one of the side effect may be putting on weight but this has not happened in my case.,F,38,6  months225mg 2X D,11/25/2010Email,Lyrica

Memory seems to be slightly worse.",I found that if I forced myself to get up and fight the side effects of being sleepy and dizzy_ they lessened or went away completely.  I felt as if I could control them...mind over matter. I have noticed that I have more energy and not as depressed.  The pain in my body seems to be lessening _ and I have had no migraines_ but I will see how it goes as I continue to take Lyrica.

I have lost 6 pounds in 1 week and the swelling in my leg has slowed down alot.,The pain that I had from the nerves in my foot were to much to deal with. I have drop foot from a hip replacement and feeling from the nerves would drive me crazy. Lyrica is the only thing that worked for me.

When upping the medication_ I felt like I had to rest my head...sitting up and walking all made it worse.   My head felt heavy.I also noticed that my feet swelled.  My sneakers are fine but I need new dress shoes because I no longer fit into them.I find it harder to come up with the words to speak whether it is orally or written.,Lyrica brought my early afternoon pain from a pre-Lyrica pain of  6/10 to a 3/10.

I now take 75 mg. 2x a day and     The pain control is very good.  I would highly recommend this medication for any chronic pain sufferer.,F,53,4  months75 mg 2X D,11/17/2010Email,Lyrica

428, 4, sleep disorder and hot flashes,Lyrica makes me tired_ even at this tiny dose_ but I was given it for my sleep disorder after a head injury. It works fairly well_ but often makes me groggy in the morning. It has a side effect of treating my hot flashes_ so this is a bonus. Sometimes I get bad withdrawal for one day if I stop_ even with my super low dose_ but I have to take breaks to due grogginess.Though I was not give this for pain control_ I happen to have a tooth problem for a month - eventually got a root canal - and I actually did not feel any tooth pain for that month because I was on the lyrica! Wow!,I think people are taking way way too high of a dose here. Doctors often prescribe much higher doses than needed. What for? That's how you get side effects. I URGE people to insist on taking the smallest possible dose and working your way up until it helps you. It can't hurt_ and it might help. I personally cannot imagine take 100 mg of this stuff or 75 twice a day - way too much.,F,45,6  months25 1X D,11/7/2010,Lyrica

Few side effects remain.",I was on a low dose for about a year and it helped with muscle tenderness_ but not for the debilitating pain I had experienced since I was 15.  My doctor and I discussed incresing my dosage from 75mg2x/day to 150mg 2x/day. The results were amazing.  For the first time in my adult life I am almost pain free.  There are some continuing side effects: dizziness and shaking when I first take it.  I probably shouldn't drive for an hour or so after I take it.  But the benefits for me far out weight the risks.  I haven't had any suicidal thoughts_ no weight gain_ although I do have bouts of ravenous hunger!  I am sorry that some people have had such a bad experience with this drug_ but for me_ it's been a true lifesaver.  I have been able to do things again.  Important things_ like sitting for more than ten minutes at a time.  I have been able to go horseback riding_ rollercoasters_ sit through a movie.  It's been great for me.,F,30,2  years150 2X D,10/30/2010Email,Lyrica

Intermittent extreme euphoria_ excessive confidence and loss of self-awareness (saying things I wouldn't normally say!)  Awful acid reflux_ especially at night.,Also taking Trazadone_ Dihydrocodeine_ Naproxen.  Lyrica has eased severe head/eye pain from C2 neck_ and virtually stopped severe leg pain at night (a big relief).  But other neck/arm pain is unresolved.  Experiencing a lot of language difficulties with a lot of 'forgotten' words and 'Spoonerisms' (e.g.'big dog' - becoming 'dig bog'_ 'the mat sat on the cat')_ written communication is also difficult and 'jumbled'.  Euphoria is unpredictable_ gabbering on like a (loud) idiot.  The worst is the weight gain_ I look like an overly pregnant hippo_ my stomach sticks out so much.  Loss of orgasm (but hey at this size partner's losing interest!)  Intermittent reaction with the dihydrocodeine (which I still need for the other pain) - can make me even more hyper (but not always).

I started taking Lyrica due to talking to the orthopedic specialist at my doctor's office. My healthcare provider at the office referred me to her once the herniated disc diagnosis was confirmed. I started with Tylenol 3 & Flexeril 5 MG_ then Tramadol 50 MG. Next_ it was increase frequency of the Tramadol with the Tylenol 3 and the Flexeril. Then_ tried Vicodin 5-500 MG generic and Lyrica. Something finally worked!!! When I say ""worked""_ I mean as far as taking the edge off. I've been taking Lyrica now for about 7 weeks.  The only side effect I've noticed is the blurred vision in my right eye and swollen right eyelid. I'm guessing that it's specific to just my right eye as that is my eye with Astigmatism. But_ the swelling didn't start until I started the Lyrica. The eyelid swelling is more of an annoyance than anything else. The swelling sometimes goes down.I haven't noticed any weight gain. Actually_ quite the opposite. I think it's actually curbing my appetite. I was already losing weight anyway because of the pain. Because the pain I have is so bad_ I really don't eat that much now...just don't feel like eating.  I've lost about 20 lbs within 2 months because of the pain alone.

I do feel empathy for what others are going through because I've been there with other medicines (read below).Main - This was the 1st Drug that I tried after being Diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue because of my skin sensitivity & my Foot/Hand pain. Foot Pain caused by taking Lipitor_ then went away after I stopped taking in 3 days. Later they put me on Simcor and Foot pain started all over again_ but this time did not stop when dose stopped.

Well_ folks_ just because you had an allergic reaction or just because you had bad side effects does not mean that the drug is ""bad"".  If you honestly expect a miracle drug that has NO side effects for anyone whatsoever_ then you live in a dream world.

Following major abdominal surgery for cancer (3.75kg tumor) I was in constant awful pain as a result of major nerve damage_ for 2 years_ until I was prescribed Lyrica. Great improvement in less than 24hours. I was at the point of suicide to stop the never ending pain. I still have constant pain but much less than prior to Lyrica.

Wanted to share this in case it helps anyone - don't give up immediately as I did. The first time I tried it_ I popped a 50mg pill in the morning - HUGE mistake- I felt totally stoned! I couldn't drive but had nice euphoric feeling and reduced pain - but I told Doc get me off this stuff! Then tried Neurontin 500 mg/day was not helping. So back to the Lyrica_ only now_ I take 50 mg before bed and 25 mg with breakfast. Only side effect so far is a bit restless sleeping/dreaming. Taking natural liquid melatonin to help.

So I don't understand why my Rheumatologist put me on Lyrica when she knew that is a big part of my history.  Anyway_ the first four days were not too bad but then the anxiety and panic started to get out of control.  After taking it for 12 days I phoned my doctor's office and was told to stop taking it immediately.  I didn't know it was the cause of my problems but started to realize it probably was when I kept getting worse.  The withdrawal off of this drug is worse than when I was taking it.  My anxiety/panic_ and complete loss of control over my emtotions had me running scared.  I couldn't cope at all.  I wanted to crawl into a corner and disappear.  I am not agoraphobic at all.  I am a very happy_ social person but I couldn't leave my house for days.  My Psychiatrist put me on Trazodone and Seroquel to help slow me down and help me sleep at night_ and I am finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  I have been off of it for 8 days now and I know for a fact that it is the drugs my Psychiatrist put me on that is helping me get through the withdrawal period and making me feel better. Once I start to feel like myself again the Seroquel will be dropped.  The Trazodone is helping with my pain and I was able to cut my Hydrocodone in half.,F,54,12  days50 1X D,8/20/2010,Lyrica

In September of 2007 I fell and broke both bones in my left forearm and dislocated my elbow.  While taking pain medication for a few days noticed that all my body pain_ that I had attributed to my numerous depression medications_ was gone! I was referred to a pain specialist who perscriber Lyrica.  It made me so dizzy that I had to stop it after the first day for fear that I would fall and damage my arm further.  Started Lyrica again_ in addition to physical therapy in 2008.  Finally quit both due to severe diahrea.  After an upper- and lower-GI and colonoscopy_ the Gastrointerologist gave me some med that stopped the diahrea within 3 days (had it for 8 months).  I still have a severe stomach ache and cannot eat until early evening. Have also had an IVU that led to a hyda scan_ both negative for liver and gallbladder problems_ then a uterine biopsy for possible cancer (negative). It's been a year and a half and still living in constant pain.  Did go back to the Pain Specialist who now recommends EXERCISE for fibro!  Too bad that I am too sick to do anything! Eyesight problems_ pain throughout body_ paranoia_ afraid to leave house_ perception and focus issues that inhibit me from driving unless I absolutely have to (food and doctor appts).

500, 2, ,weight gain_ anxiety_ memory loss_ anxiety and suicidal thoughts,I must say the suicidal thoughts were the worst thing I have ever experienced.  It took me quite a long to time to attribute this to the Lyrica.  My problem came when I was late taking a dose or if a dose was missed. I became more severe when I began trying to get off of the medicine.  My doctor prescribe a 75 mg drop and I was not able to see life as something one could possibly want to remain in. Pretty scary especially when you don't know what's causing it.  Lorazapan helps this but also makes me sleep.  Kind of tough when one needs to function in life.  It became impossible when the insurance Co. Would not allow the doctor to write the script necessary to drop 25 mgs at a time. I can not handle dropping any more than that. Even that much causes a problem. I just need to accept that and get through a couple of tough days. So_ now the doc tells me to break open a capsule and dump out half?  Is she kidding me?? A) this is illegal..  The reason is_ is that the active ingredient vs inactive_ you have no way of knowing how much of each is in each half.  Not only that but if you dump out the powder inside the pill how on earth can you make an accurate half?  Even if you weigh it which_how many of us own a scale capable of accurately weighing that small of an amount.  So I have gone through 6 months of weaning to get to 150 mgs and I'm half way there.  I can't imagine going cold turkey as I think I would need to be hospitalized and medicated to do that.  The insurance company see,F,50,2  years150 2X D,6/23/2010Email,Lyrica

Weird been on nuerontin for 8-1/2 yrs and does same thing. After 4 months of takin it I have had knee and joint pain but without lyrica I cannot leave my house so its a trade I guess. Chronic pain is never cured you just bounce around on different drugs as the side effects worsen and unfortunatly were along for the ride.,Do not give up on this drug after a day or just a week the side effects will cease. you will be giving up on relief! If you scare away because of side effects try and find a drug without them been there done that still cant find one. If you are bed ridden or cannot leave your house or work due to pain I would give it a try but if your taking it due to minor discomfort pain and still able to work  I'd try advil you can talk to your doctor about loading up with correct dosage. Ive been living with chronic pain for over 10 years cant sleep cant work cant live felt hopeless lyrica has given me some great family time and gotten me outside it is so good to feel alive and smell the outdoor air.

Up to then my Dr. & I had been working since 2004 with several symptoms of depression_ a neck & shoulder injury_ blood pressure & thyroid issues. My overall experience with Lyrica has been a little concerning.The dosages have been adjusted up & down. I have been thru audiology testing_an mri_ neurology testing regarding my brain &  memory retention & abilities. Even with decreased dosages_ the lessened dizziness_ jerking movements_some memory and word loss & depression_ are 'normal' for me now. The most disturbing side effects have been recently & have gone away with a dosage change.  I experienced extreme memory loss_ loss of words & complete inability to hold a thought for longer than 30 seconds.  My job is completely based on details_ information retention_ multi-tasking & legal compliance (to a degree).  I was also experiencing paralyzing anxiety & then paranoia.  My overwhelming fear was that my job was in danger.  I have been in this position for 8 years & held in some degree of esteem_ even tho I am only support staff. Now I was out of my mind_ literally.  I then agreed that I should decrease dosage by 1/4. My life immediately returned to 'normal' & on the first day. My bosses & I had a meeting. They had never considered 'firing me'_ just wanted to learn how they can make my job easier.

It's been 3 days_ starting to feel better. Will report back if symptoms don't go away.  Careful taking this drug. Don't believe the hype. I don't think it helped with pain after first 2 weeks.,I guess I was hopeful because I felt better for awhile but also had a bursa shot when I started it.

So its the devil you know_ then nothing else works. I have tried TCA's_ SSRI's_ other anticonvulsants. Normal pain relief doesn't touch the pain_ and I won't take addictive stuff.

I am a software programmer and concentration is vital. I lost my will to eat_ keep up with myself and work and even live. I started to contemplate suicide within the first 4 days.  as soon as I started weaning off the medication (don't just stop_ that is ever worse) i got my normal frame of mind back.  I am in process of filing a lawsuit against pharm company for loss of wages and alot more.. I also have been taking effexor xr for 8 years for depression and it works great with no side affects_ lyrica either interfered with the effexor or just is poison to some people_ including me.

524, 5, Tremors and GAD,Very hyper_ Feel like I'm floating_ no longer craving cigarettes_ euphoria,Just started treatment with Lyrica and so far so good. I was hesitant to take it at first_ cause of all the bad stuff I heard about it. I have tremors in my hands and generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks. Lyrica stops the panic attacks and helps me stay calm. It also helps my tremors so I my hands stopped shaking a great deal. I have been on several different medications_ but the Lyrica is the only medication that really helps. Another thing I have severe back pain due to arthritis and have been on antiinflammatory medications_ and the Lyrica stopped my back pain 100%. Lyrica makes me so full of energy which I can live with that_ after all that's a small price to pay for relief from my anxiety and tremors. Everyone reacts differently to Lyrica. For some reason after taking Lyrica_ I no longer crave cigarettes after smoking one pack a day for six years. Lyrica to me is a miracle medication.

I have horrible intractable head pain--think lightning bolts.  I have gained 17 lbs on Lyrica and it is all lower thorax/upper abdomen.  I can't sit without feeling uncomfortable.  It is difficult to tie my cross-trainers.  My BMI is shot because of this and I am going to cardiologist for her to determine if this big belly is fat or water retention.  If it is fat_ I am going off Lyrica and will talk to my neurologist about stepping down_ trying something else or see if a surgical option is available to severe some nerves.  My face will probably sag but the nerve pain is such a living hell.  Even though Lyrica relieves 75% of pain and reduces painful episodic pain_ the pain is worse when I garden_ clean out from under a bed_ clean out lower drawers_ shelves; in general it is still exacerbated from bending over.,F,61,6  months150 4X D,5/10/2010Email,Lyrica

This also extended to sometimes actually having the desire to have a one on one confrontation with anyone that might excite or strongly disagree with me... It takes much self control to tolerate the side effects. I was prescribed the Lyrica for nerve damage in my head after an auto accident_ hit from the rear_ whiplash... Is it worth it?  I am not really sure. But until something better comes along I guess it is. Good Luck!,Be cauious with your dosages not to exceed 300 mg per day_ if you can tolerate 3 X 100 mgs per day...

It takes 4 hours roughly to reach peak effect and lasts for an hour at this level...a great window to get to sleep in. If I miss the window though_ sleep is hard to come by. Dizziness and slurring of words occurs during that hour too. Otherwise I have no pain and work in a busy profession 3 days a week. I cope with it very well now. Sometimes I take paracetamol and ibuprofen or diclofenac as well. Occasionally I need 50mg of Tramadol for more severe breakthrough pain but it is rare and only if I am experiencing a fibro flare.

I took the first dose at night.  (It's worth noting_ I also take Savella.  My results with it are decent_ not great.) I slept great that night (I'm a raging insomniac)_ but didn't wake for 15 hours and simply could not function the following day.  I knew there was no way I could do anything during they day if I took my day time dose.  So I waited until I acclimated to my night time dose and until I got through a couple of important meetings I had to attend; then I started the day time dose.  I have been asleep_ night and day_ with few exceptions_ since then.  My waking hours are usually in the middle of the night.  I'm having one heck of a time adjusting to this.  I'm sure part of it is the high dose and the fact that I'm already on the Savella.  Part of it is me.  I am my PCP's worst fibro case.  BUT I am willing to do and try anything.

I hated the sudden electricity shooting across my chest_ too. I decided to get off the drug but the anxiety came in horrible waves when I tried to stop it cold as the doctor said I could. Instead I gradually decreased my dosage_ weaning myself slowly by pouring a little of it out of the 50mg capsules until I just stopped. Worked. I have been off for 2 years now. Pain did not return. Discovered I was B12 deficient and low thyroid while on the drug. Was furious doctors prescribed Lyrica instead of the vitamin B12 and Levothroid. Now I take B12 and low dose Levothroid and I have no pain. Slowly I have improved almost to normal and have my energy back and my mind is sharp again and I type fast and well again. I beat my son in scrabble now and then as usual. He no longer beats me everytime.,F,56,8  months75 2X D,4/13/2010,Lyrica

I would NEVER recommend this to anyone.  It did NOTHING for my fibromyalgia--straight Neurontin (the ""parent"" drug of Lyrica) did more for my fibro with fewer side effects.  I gained 50 lbs. and had severe edema_ to the point where the ER doctor told me that I was in danger of dying if I didn't lose the weight and stop doing whatever I was doing to make my body retain so much fluid.  One edema incident was so bad that_ as I was trying to get dressed before the ambulance arrived to take me to the hospital (I was having severe breathing difficulties and my body was swollen)_ I could barely squeeze my legs into my ""fat girl"" jeans that I had worn comfortably earlier in the day!  I also couldn't get my shoes on because my feet were so swollen.  After that incident_ I threw out my Lyrica_ went through withdrawal_ and begged my GP for a different solution.  NEVER AGAIN will I take this drug.  If it works for you_ great.  But if you're considering taking it_ read the adverse side effects list CAREFULLY.

Numbness_ tingling_ tightness_ and pain are now tolerable_ big toe no longer pulls up hard and painfully_ and I can sleep at night. No weight gain. This drug has been a miracle that has saved my life_ as neuropathy pain was so bad I just couldn't continue like that.

The dosage of 300 mg 2x/day was reduced to 300 mg/night and 150 mg/morning.  This was to combat the ""drug hangover.""  Initially using with Cymbalta.  Well who wouldn't be depressed if you hurt all the time!  Really dislike Cymbalta and no longer use at all.  Use Lyrica with Ambien CR at night and have some generic Darvoset to supplement when I really hurt.  Over a year and a half its now 60 lbs extra weight and I'm not a large person.  However_ am finding Disability Board and Examiner don't comprehend the fatigue experienced nor the pain of fibro.  The Disability Examiner says the TV commercials show people are running around with energy_ so why can't actual patients?  I think the side effects are under reported and the medical field does not receive adequate information to support patient claims of side effects.  We are NOT a TV commercial!  If I have to be somewhere in the morning_ I have to skip the morning dose or I will sleep through the appointments.  Its not drowsy as in yawning a little bit_ it full on puts me to sleep.  I have to schedule my days to sleep off the drugs_ then it takes on average 3 hours for the sluggishness to wear off from the morning dose after literally waking up from the morning nap.

Sleeping well is not worth this.,Since I am so young and my medical problems are complicated my pain management doctor convinced me this was the last resort! I tried so hard to stick with it but it literally controlled my life. When I slept_ when I was in pain_ and when I had the ability to think and go to class. I would rather deal with the flare ups and loss of sleep then loss my life to a medication. It's scary this drug is legal...I have yet to find a new pain management doctor to take me seriously because of my age.

I am still on Cymbalta_ 60mg per day in the morning_ with the Lyrica.  I take several supplements such as fish oil_ magnesium_ mutli vitamin_ B supplements_ chondroitin_ 1200 mg ibuprofen twice per day. The pain really decreased and my sleep seemed to level out at first.  Over the 7 months of taking this stuff_ I am starting to wonder if its worth it.  It took the ""burning"" pain from my fibro_ but the trigger points and tension in head_ neck and shoulders has intensified again.  If I miss one dose for any reason_ the insomnia and withdrawal is as if I've stopped cold turkey from street drugs or alcohol.  It's intense and scary. My sleep schedule is completely off and I have no control over my body's behaviors at all.  I am in complete submission to all my drugs and their side effects as well as the disease's side effects.  I am depressed again due to this lack of control.  my quality of life has seriously deteriorated and my relationships are suffering.  If it weren't for my dog who is the only one who can ""hang"" with my weird schedule_ I'd be all alone.

601, 4, Anxiety,Lethargy_ vivid sometimes disturbing dreams. DON'T TAKE WITH ALCOHOL!!,Because Lyrica is not approved for GAD in Canada_ there is not a lot of info out there with regards to this off label use. My doc started me on this drug at a low dose of 25mg/day in an attempt to get me off of the 1mg of ativan that I was on. The 25mg didn't help so I was bumped to 50mg and then to 100mg. This drug is funny and I'm unsure what side effects belong to the Lyrica and which belong to my benzo withdrawal. I have noticed that I worry less about most things in life. I used to have anxiety attacks at the drop of a hat. The one thing that I MUST STRESS is that if you drink alcohol_ DO NOT TAKE THE LYRICA UNTIL THE BOOZE IS OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM. I had two separate experiences where the day after was complete hell. Incredible anxiety_ depression and suicidal ideation. I am curious to see what the effects of this med will be once I am off of the Ativan. I don't plan on being on this med for longer than a few months.

626, 3, Fibromyalgia and neuropathy in feet,Extreme weight gain_ fogginess_ short term memory loss_ irritable_ fatigue_ drunk-like feeling at first,I was prescribed Lyrica about a year ago. I started on 50mg. twice a day then up to 150mg. twice a day. I felt very strange_ almost drunk but with much more intensity. I've gained 20+ lbs. and I'm sure that's not helping with the pain in my feet OR my fibromyalgia aching. Lyrica helped with my pain but my feet began to worsen so I was increased to 225mg. twice a day. After a few months_ my feet began hurting again. I was sent to ANOTHER neurologist and he's now weaning me off the Lyrica and has prescribed Savella. The withdrawals from Lyrica are the worse thing I think I've ever been through. I got down to 225mg. once a day but my mood was terrible. I was unable to sleep much and not good when I did sleep. The headaches are unbearable and I wanted to cry all the time. My thinking became very unrational. I'm back at 150mg. twice a day just to give myself and those around me a break. Overall_ Lyrica worked at first but gradually stopped even with an increase in mgs.. I've been on alot of medications since most doctors have no idea what to do with fibromyalgia patients but I have to say these are the worse withdrawal symptoms of any drug I've had to wean from.

Rash left arm_ shortness of breath.,I began taking 50 mg. capsules twice a day about 4 weeks ago for undiagnosed burning sensations_ mostly in my feet.  At about the 2 week point I started having mild episodes of dizziness (or feeling momentarily intoxicated).  These episodes have increased in both severity and frequency to the point where the feeling is now continuous.  Additionally I noticed a rash on my left bicep_ and had difficulty breathing under exhertion during weeks 2 and 3.  The prescribing Dr. told me it might make me a little sleepy_ but made no mention of watching for allergic reactions_ and certainly no mention of perpetual dizziness and out-of-body experiences.  I put a call in to the Dr.'s office today to ask about tapering_ but no response yet.  I've experienced the unpleasant withdrawl from SSRI drugs before_ but LYRICA has those drugs beat by a mile.  I feel like the life is being sucked out of my body; like my brain is moving 3 steps behind; and like I'm stoned.  This stuff has proven to be an awful_ beastly thing.

634, 3, Fibromyalgia,Dizziness_ brain fog_ mood swings_ crying for no reason_ irritability_ sleepyness.,This drug *worked* for my Fibro pain.  After one week at 150mg per day the pain was nearly gone. After another week at 300mg per day there was no pain.  Unfortunately_ the side effects were awful.  I felt high all the time_ I couldn't remember anything - I was constantly searching for the right words.  The brain fog was even worse than my fibro fog.  When the mood swings kicked in_ I had to call my rheumatologist and ask to be put on something different.  In short: It works_ but the side effects aren't worth it.,F,,1  months,9/3/2009,Lyrica

After the 3 week prednisone taper_ I stopped the 50 mg of Lyrica and completely quit sleep.  I'd go for 4 days/nights without sleep and would then sleep for 2 hours and the cycle would repeat.  I then tried to reinstate the Lyrica (50 mg) reading it helped with sleep but would still get only 2-4 hours/night.  Doctor then added Ambien (same results) and Lunesta (same results).  After being on for 2 months and having extreme twitching/insomnia_ I tried to stop again.  Went into horrific insomnia.  Not sleeping for 5 nights and then sleep 2 hours.  After 2 months of this_ doctor put on Remeron which slowly helped to get 4-5 hours of sleep.  Currently withdrawing from the Remeron.  Prior to this nightmare_ I always slept well and soundly.

I've been on Lyrica for about two weeks_ one week on 75 mg and the next on 150 mg. I also take .5 mg of Flexeril at night to help me sleep. In spite of the side effects_ it has gotten rid of persistent excruciating back pain_ tingling and weakness in hands_ anxiety depression and severe insomnia. I'm able to do most of what I used to do: sewing_ playing the piano_ cleaning_ cooking_ artwork_ hoisting granchildren_ etc. I was a pretty busy person involved with many things before I was felled by fibro and pretty much incapacitated. It has also worked wonder on my anxiety disorder and feel much less stressed out. I had been reluctant to even go to a doctor with fibro_ since the first Rheum doc told me 5 years ago I needed to pursue an ""aerobic exercise program""_ which made it worse. I did a lot of ""other"" treatments: I am on the Paelolithic diet and take B-12_ Magnesium and Fish oil_ which helped a little but not enough. I also tried Guaifenesin (worked a little_ then built up a tolerance and then it caused severe urethritis)_ Ativan (same problem)_ Soma (a complete waste of a drug) and months of PT (did almost nothing). I knew that my mother probably had Fibromyalgia/GAD and it scared me that I could up an invalid like her. New doc doc said the gold standard for fibro drugs is now Lyrica.

Now I only take maybe 2 Lortab and that's only to get off of it gradually.  For me this seems too good to be true.  I'm hoping that I don't experience any of the side effects that I'm reading about.

I take 50mg in morning and 50mg in afternoon and that is it. It helps me with job performance. I eventually hope to gradually taper off to see what happens_ I would prefer to be drug free. Another thing_it helps alot with anxiety_ which works out good for me. If your thinking of taking this medicine give it a chance_ take small dose for a while.

OUCH! and WAY too tired!  Lyrica allowed me to do some mild-moderate training for a short-course triathlon_ as the pain was much less (and when fatigue was under control (most days)).  I am currently taking 150mg BID but am now experiencing awful constipation (have been since the beginning--have NEVER had problem before) despite a diet full of fruits_ vegetables_ and whole grains.  Constipation definitely accounts for probably all of the weight I've gained while taking Lyrica - unfortunate_ but true - ew.

Now I have all of these side effects that I see most other people are describing in here and the side effects are as bad as having the fibromyalgia. I can barely get my shoes on my feet because they are so swelled. My rings are now hard to get off because my fingers are so swelled. I proudly lost 30 pounds in 2004 and now just in the last few months I've gained 30+ pounds! I'm having more brain fog and memory loss than usual. My sleep is more off than usual_ hence being tired all of the time. The good part was that it took away my severe menstrual cramps and dysmenorrhea symptoms every month (something I had to deal with since age 11). But I cannot take these side effects either_ so I don't know what I'll do now_ but I definitely have to talk to my dr about going off of the Lyrica.,F,38,11  months,7/12/2009,Lyrica

My pain was horrible for years_ to the point where I could no longer work.  I was a mess!  Although I have many symptoms_ it allows me to live.  I was not living before taking Lyrica.  To the individual who states there is no such thing as Fibromyalgia....you need to live in my shoes for a few days!  You are a very narrow minded individual!,F,40,1.5  years,7/8/2009,Lyrica

It scared me when it made me foggy and loopy and changed my personality like I was not myself.  This happened very soon after taking the medication.  It helped the pain_ but only to the point were it made it a duller pain not taking the pain away.,F,43,4  days,7/7/2009,Lyrica

Drowsy all the time - if it wasn't for coffee I'd be horizontal_ concentration and memory loss_ forgetting words and sentences dry up! Mood swings_ some small amount of weight gain (but I'm less active due to illness). Apetite varies from day to day,I found lyrica helpfull in stopping pain from muscle spasms and nerve comrpession_ I was having awful neck and head aches which were debilitating at best and did the job where drugs like codeine and steroids had not helped (the constipation from taking codeine was also a reason for stopping). Getting a good nights sleep has helped me cope with my symptoms and although i agree that Lyrica has some very undesirable side effects - I would not swap for a lesser effective drug at the moment_ all drugs have side effects(even herbals). I would recommend that you explain what you are taking and let your family read up on Lyrica_ my OH was very frustrated with me at first and we argued constantly due to my forgettfullness and lack of concentration_ he's now more tolerant as he knows it is out of my control and he helps me remember things I've said (visa versa). I am looking forward to coming off Lyrica after I've had my operation to remove the offending disc in my neck in a few weeks_ I am concerned at stopping suddenly - there seems to be little info on coming off Lyrica!,F,37,5  months,7/5/2009Email,Lyrica

For the first few months it seemed to be a miracle drug - not eliminating my pain_ but making enough of a dent for life to be bearable. In the last couple of months_ though_ the brain fog and sleepiness has gotten so much worse. From 2 hours after taking a dose until 6 hours after I just. can't. think. I could deal with the balance_ twitching_ and constipation_ but I'd rather be in constant pain than lose my intelligence_ and as I *have* to be able to drive_ the sleepiness is dangerous!,F,31,10  months,7/5/2009,Lyrica

Have to use gum if liquid is not near by to help with sever dry mouth_ muscles cramping all over my body for hours_ pain so bad I scream while crying_ finally contacted ALS website and went on magnesium of 2400 mg. a day to stop cramps_ it worked but my doctor is worried about my heart_ yet it did not bother any doctors when I almost kicked one in the face while he was trying to examine me because sever muscle cramps started all over my body and I was crying and screaming in pain.  Swelling of feet and hands_ many new medical problems and no doctor seems to be keeping up with the Lyrica drug issues.  We really need better medical information for the patient and doctors must READ.  This I believe will come once we have more government control,After two days when I began on 50 mg twice a day it took away pain in all 18 trigger points. Now 2 years later it is another story.  I was amazed and told the doctor I had at the time that yes drug worked for now_ but this has happened to me before with other drugs. Now being up to 450 mg a day.

Felt like I had been drinking too much by the afternoon though and was afraid to drive etc.Pain started to return and noticed my thought process was confused. My dr. suggested reducing the amount by one pill(50mg) in the morning since sleep was most beneficial to me and that still seemed to be working. I have now reduced to just taking 100mg. at night. I notice a numb feeling in some of my limbs at times_ just slightly but enough to take notice of and the tingling or pins and needles that others have mentioned. I will probably continue taking for a few more weeks till I reevaluate with my dr.,This is a very potent drug with a lot of side effects for a lot of people it seems.I don't dwell on my pain the same as I did before taking this drug.

I have had chronic pelvic pain with sitting for seven years and finally received a diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment.  I have tried numeroous prescribed medications without any success in alleiviating the pain.  The lyrica has only taken a small edge off the pain -  bringing the pain level from a 9 to an 8.

My medicationsinclude Tylenol SR_ Advil_ Soma_ Flexeril_ and Ultram_ which is a synthetic narcotic developed in Germany.  I have had nerve ablations in the lumbar region_ and also steroid injections.  The beneficial effects of these last an average of six month.I was calling my primary care doc for refills of Ultram_ which were refilled.  At the last appointment_ my doc suggested Lyrica_ subsequent to seeing in the chart_ that the pain clinic has prescribed this drug_ at some point earlier.  I must say I was in pronounced_ sharp pain since last Saturday_ after sitting in a portable chair_ watching my children play a soccer match.  Muscle spasms set in.  I called my boss_ Monday morning_ and reported a sick day.  Today_ I had troublemoving off the bed.  I showered_ and got dressed_ with my wife helping me with my socks.  I caught the train to work_ in pain.  I was pretty miserable.  I gobbled three 25 mg Lyrica late in the afternoon_ and the relief came in about 45 minutes_ thereafter.

692, 1, burning in arms,Within hours of starting Lyrica_ I experienced NEW BURNING in my face (cheeks_ nose_ ears_ around eyes_ and under chin/throat) and legs (feet_ shins_ calves_ inner & outer thighs_ buttocks_ genital area). Even though I stopped Lyrica 4 1/2 months ago_ these side-effects have continued and are worse. Additional_ gastro-intestinal side-effects included bloating_ irregularity_ intermittent sharp pain etc_ which ceased when I stopped using Lyrica - except five months later I have almost constant low-level nausea_ which may be a manifestation of burning on the 'inside'. Lyrica has made a condition which was limited to my hands & arms now spread to almost my entire body. It has made a condition which I tolerated for 10 years 100x worse.,I have had burning in my hands & arms for 10 years_ which began as RSI from computer use. I have tried many approaches to deal with this_ without positive result. I used Advil to dull the pain. In January_ a rhuematologist put me on Lyrica (150mg) for 'idiopathic autonomic peripheral neuropathy'. Within hours_ I felt new burning in OTHER parts of my body_ such as face and legs. I reported this but was told to stay on the drug. When I saw the doctor 2 weeks later and spoke of these continuing side effects she said she had never heard of them before and to keep taking it: that night I found this website and quit immediately. All side effects disppeared for one week and then returned... It has been nearly five months now and I have almost constant burning in my legs_ feet and face_ accompanied by low-level nausea. It is not going away_ but on the contrary_ it is getting more intense. This drug has done something terrible to my brain and body. Instead of turning nerves off_ it has turned them on. How do I undo what it has done to my nervous system? And - do I have any legal recourse?

701, 4, Fibromyalgia,Gained 4pounds in weight after a year or so.,Fibro is running in the family. After 2 years of meetings with specialists_ I finally found a working solution! Approx 1hour before bed_ I take 100mg Lyrica together with 3mg Melatonin. The reason is that Lyrica makes you more alert in the beginning_ and then slowly makes you tired. Melatonin makes you sleepy after 30min. Most fibro patients have restless sleep_ mostly because the lack of deep sleep (delta). Lyrica is the only drug that will get your body to stage 3 and 4 during deep sleep!**IMPORTANT! Do NOT take more than 150mg before bed or your symptoms will get worse! Stay Off Lyrica during the day.** Twice a day_ take vitamin B12+Folic acid (many fibropatients lack the ability to absorb B12). B12 will get you more alert_ and may also reduce som pain. To verify the results: Try it for 10days_ then stop for 5. After apprx 2-3 days you will be back in your standard tired/sleepy/lack of energy state. B12 is stored in the liver for 1-2 days. Watersolvent. Very low risc of side effects. Good Luck!,M,42,23  months,5/20/2009,Lyrica

It is well known that people with FM need smaller doses_ they really need to realize that when prescribing it.,This drug saved me from being bedridden.  I have to work hard at balancing myself_ eating right_ getting my exercise (I started at 2 minutes on the treadmill and worked up)_ and taking vitamins_ but the Lyrica made that possible.  I only take 50 mg am and 25 mg pm_ and it controls the horrible neurological symptoms without the side effects.  I do not recommend taking the high doses they prescribe_ however.  It is horrible then.,F,48,4  months,4/22/2009Email,Lyrica
719, 2, Peripheral neuropathy,Muscle soreness for no reason.  Joint pain for no reason.  Incredible_ oppressive somnolence_ as if just getting off the redeye from Tokyo... all day long.  Sleeping 9-10 hours/night.  Horrid nighmares_ and suicidal thoughts.,"It's a love/hate medication.  It does reduce the incredible unreasonable pain of PN... which elevates in the evening_ and especially at night.  I sometimes describe the neuropathic pain I'm experiencing as follows:  ""It's as if toes were blown off with a 12 gauge_ and then remainder wrapped with barb wire_ crushed in a vice_ and then inserted in a hornet's nest.   Sometimes feels like someone dropped a piano on the feet and then attacked by a herd of porcupines""Anyway_ you get the drift.  Lyrica does help reduce the spontaneous stinging_ burning_ and razor pain at night_ so I can sleep.  I only take it at bedtime...  I find that 75mg does nothing.  150 mg starts to help_ and usually gets me through the night_ but generates the somnolence and soreness next day.  I've gone with 225mg at bedtime_ which definitely helps with the pain for the night_ however_ I am the walking dead the next day_ and can hardly keep eyes open the entire day.   Lyrica should be labeled with a skull and crossbones_ and should come not with side effect advice_ but stern warnings that as beneficial as it can be for nerve pain_ it can be life altering to the negative_ in many other categories.   Suicidal thoughts are frightening_ but wonder if they are completely from the Lyrica.   Intractible pain alternated with the side effects of Lyrica as an only alternative_ are enough to drive one to suicidal thoughts simply from the hopelessness of the situation.",M,59,1  years,4/22/2009,Lyrica

I do not know if it is a miricle drug but it has reversed a lot of the symptoms I had prior to fibromyalgia. I was in so much pain for so many years and I had a lot of memory loss and pain_ it is nice to have more energy and less pain. I have been on the medication 1 1/2 months and have very little side effects except the ones I mention earlier. Like all medications_ one should try it for themselves and then determine it. I read many of the comments and felt bad_ because if you suffer from fibromyalgia like I have for so many years and to have something that can help me to continue to work then_ thanks be to those who can help others.,F,53, ,4/20/2009Email,Lyrica

After experiencing light-headedness for a couple of days_ the side effects went away and I felt better than I had in years.  Then my hands and feet began to swell and tingle.  I began to gain weight rapidly (20 pounds in two months.)  Then it seemed like I was suddenly severly depressed.  After coming off it slowly and looking back_ I realize the depression came on gradually_ almost from the time I began to take Lyrica.  It got so bad that I could only sit in a corner and cry. Suicidal thoughts got pretty persistant.  Anything my husband said made me cry.  Even after cutting the dosage as I began to come off it_ I was agitated and angry all the time.  I am now free of it and feeling better but the pain has returned and I'm still agitated_ which is a new experience for me.  I'm usually very mellow!  I hope I get back to normal eventually.

730, 4, Fibromyalgia_Sjrogrens_Lupus_ PAIN!,"Dizziness_ slight ""high"" feeling_ mild nausea for 2 days with each increase in dosage_ some swelling of lips_ slight rash on face around mouth_ constipation.","I started on 50mg at bedtime 1 1/2 weeks ago. The first night_ I slept through the night for the 1st time in 6 yrs. Did have extreme dizziness and a slight ""high"" feeling the first 2 days. Took Meclizine (Antivert-available over the counter but you have to ask the pharmacist for it-take up to 100mg/day-ask your MD). Used for dizziness_ nausea_ motion sickness.  Those side effects wore off after 2 days. I had good pain relief within 24hrs and so was determined to work thru side effects as I was pretty non-functional even with pain meds. The 3rd day my lips were somewhat swollen and I took Benadryl without added symptoms. I developed a slight rash around my mouth on one side of my face_ the Benadryl and Hydrocortisone cream helped with that. Pain continued to improve and was only taking Darvocet in evening only before next dose of Lyrica due. Increased dose to 100mg at bedtime Tuesday and the dizziness returned for about 36hrs but again the Meclizine helped and Benadryl helped. Today I feel great_ pain is only mild in back and haven't needed pain meds today - Yey!!! I also am not needing to take Ambien every night either to sleep. Was sleeping 12-14hrs per day without the med and now 10hrs with good rest. No return of rash. Some bloating/constipation - taking Miralax for which helps_ otherwise no swelling or weight gain yet. Am to increase dose next Tues to 50 mg in the morning and 100mg at bedtime. Right now the good definitely outweighs the bad.",F,50,2  weeks,4/10/2009Email,Lyrica

733, 3, Fibromyalgia,eye twitching for about 1 to 2 weeks and then went away_ felt very lightheaded and spacey.  Urinary incontinence_ major constipation_ very bloated and gained weight.,Although I had side affects_ I had good results the very next day at 75mg 1x day.  I felt like for once I could feel normal and pain free and enjoy life again.  It has now been 2 months now at 75mg 2x's a day and it is starting to wear off but I am scared to go up in dosage due to more weight gain.  I also have more anxiety now sometimes.  As for the constipation and urinary incontinence_ I have been drinking onion juice tea with honey 1 cup everyday and it has really helped get rid of excess fluids and constipation.  I cut up a spanish onion in half and simmer in pot of water for 2 hours until the color is dark yellow liquid.  Drink only the juice as tea with honey in it for taste and this really helps me stay regular and not so bloated.

Later that day another dizzy spell_ I fell with just having total hip replacement...lucky for me the spill was broken by my head.   I had somewhat the same very serious side effects with Neurotin two years ago and was told to watch out as these two meds are somewhat the same ingredients?  but pray this would help my major chronic pain.   Needless to say I have hurt my already budging disk in neck and back from this fall. And pain level was doubled...  I was on Cymbalta for years and it major helped with Fibro until it stop working... I was hoping for the same results.,I agree with many people please note all side effects... I know these drugs helps some people...but there are those of us that it causes dangerous side effects.   I have one to many doctors of specialized areas...I work with all them.  And if they do not work with me_ they are dangerous to my health as well as my well being.

I even had an auto accident because I ""zoned out"" while driving_ which I think was due to the effects of the medicine.  I am worried that my brain will never be as sharp as it was before I took Lyrica.  I did not notice any problems when I stopped taking it_ as I had tapered down to 75mg at night only.

I physically put my hand out to stop something from happening_ or to help someone;  I talk out loud to people in my dream and feel as though I am a part of everything that is happening_ instead of just 'observing' the dream. Quite enjoyable_ but weird.,Am concerned because I am not only sleeping 10 hours at night_ but am now falling asleep frequently during the day.  This has crept up on me_ but after sleeping right through my grandson's birthday party last week I am worried about what is happening to me.  Today I fell asleep while sitting with a pile of files on my lap_ then it happened again another three times in the same day.  I live alone and am now afraid I may have a stroke or something equally as bad.  How much do we really know about Lyrica?

Can't exercise and added weight not helping with back or with emotional status.",In spite of weight gain_ this is truly a wonder drug. I had horrid pains in both right leg and left arm due to spinal stenosis resulting in fusion/decompression at both my neck (L5-6_ L6-7) and lower back (L5). The pain isn't all gone but managable now and amazed at how quickly pains return after missing only 1 dosage.

Slight swelling of hands and feet. After 1 month I was HUNGRY ALL THE TIME. 30 minutes after dinner I felt like I hadn't eaten. Gained 15 pounds. Pain in right side near kidney and liver. Had to quit when I started to have to urinate twice an hour.,This worked well BUT the pain in my side was so bad I had to quit. Withdrawal was AWFUL. For over a month I had headaches_ insomnia_ increased pain_ vomiting_ and what my friend calls coma sleep. I would pass out for 5 hours at a time and no one could wake me.

At times difficulty putting two words together. Stomach upset. Swelling of hands_ feet and face for several hours after each dose. Hand pain for first 5 days. EXTREME bladder retention to the point I was in some pain and it kept awakening me. Some increase in appetite but I'm not sure if that's from the Lyrica or the irritation I'm feeling.,I started out on 50mg 3x/day. I did notice some substantial relief of the radiating pain but no relief of any other pain. After consulting w/MD am backed down to 50mg 1x/day with the hope of slowly increasing. She wanted me to take it at bedtime but due to the bladder retention I gave up on that and am trying it mid-day. My concentration has improved greatly as has my speech but the irritability_ headache and hand/feet/face swelling is still there and the bladder retention (the last two aren't as bad though.) At this point I strongly feel that the side effects far outweigh any relief. I would love to hear from anyone having similar or the same side effects as I've described_ especially if you have the same dx as myself. My MD is feeling strong about this medication and I'm so dearly tired of wasting so much of my life trying this and that where the side effects are so bad that I'm losing rather than gaining quality of life.

(started the 2x regime on a holiday weekend so I didn't have to drive). Side effects: a little weight gain_ sometimes foggy brain_ can't remember words_ tiredness. After 2 months on drug: slight swelling of legs and feet at the end of the day and muscle twitch below eye (these have just started). But I don't need to be on this drug for much longer- surgery in a week.,This relieved my pain (due to herniated disc at L4/L5) and I can function. Greatly helped me with my pain_ I forgot to take a tablet one morning and by 3pm I was in a lot of pain. So it definitely works for me. Helps with sleeping- at the beginning I think it just knocks you out but as your body gets used to the drug this stops. Sleeping better due to better pain managment.

One horrible side effect is when you forget to take your pills. It happened me three times and you just feel horrible_ the head feels like its going to explode. My doctor recommended me to check my sight since if you take the drug a long time it can influence your sight.,Beside these side effects I must say that the medication helped me in reducing my anxiety. Before I could have such strong anxiety that I couldnt get to work. Almost all my anxiety is gone_ and I feel much more secure.

Urination is VERY difficult for me; I must strain like I am giving birth just to pee.  I also urinate much less than normal for me. Straining this way causes my ribcage to hurt badly.  I would like to know if anyone else has experienced chest pains like me.

I can't sit down during the day because my legs and knees hurt so bad I have to constantly move them_ even though I am exhausted. When I do finally sit or lay down at night I usually cry myself to sleep because of the pain.

First side effects are dizziness and lack coodination on waking after a night dose. This goes away in a few days. I moved my Lyrica 75_ then to 150 dose earlier in evening so no morning hangover. Dry mouth is a side effect of this and ALL antiseizure meds; it is not as bad as others! The slightly clouded feeling later in the day is WELL worth the relief of Chronic migraines. I have not had a migraine in 17 days now_ after using Imitrex 18 to 20 times in 30 days at my worst times. Slight increase in appetite (I watch it!) gained 5 lbs in 6 weeks.

Extreme dizziness right away_ dry mouth_ confusion_ loss of hand control (would drop things)_ hot flashes_ severe headaches_ nausea_ bruising easily_ small rashes_ moody_ complete loss of sex drive_ concentration is pretty much gone_ loss of balance_ memory loss.  I would have a conversation and not remember it 30 mins later!  I'm sure there is more_ I just can't remember right now!,Lyrica has helped with my severe pain from my fibromyalgia_ BUT sometimes the side effects really interrupt my life... almost as much as the pain!  The last few days_ I've been dizzier than usual and I'm feeling like I am going to pass out.  Sigh... I'm feel better knowing that it's from the medicine and I'm not going into menopause!!,F,38,11  months,11/4/2008,Lyrica

When I tried to wean off because of the weight gain the nausea came back.  I am now only taking 75 mg at night.  No one can explain why it works for my chronic morning nausea but it does?,F,46,2  years,11/2/2008Email,Lyrica
851, 5, Anxiety/Depression,Weight gain_ Swollen hands and feet_ joint pain_ sensitive nipples,After 4 years of extreme anxiety and depression that I could not control with medication_ Lyrica has changed my life.  I tried over 30 different drugs without any relief.  Lyrica at 375mg. is allowing me to live my life again.  I truly mean this.  The side effects are extreme--I'm taking a number of drugs just to counter the side effects; however_ I will live with them as long as lyrica helps me.,M,51,9  months,10/28/2008,Lyrica

Doc started me on 25 mg 2 X a day because I'm only 115lbs. Its not helping with pain and cause unwanted side effects_ don't mind the increased appetite though.

I would only recommend it for people with severe and constant pain.,M,45,2  years,10/26/2008,Lyrica

855, 3, Post - Herpatic Neuropathy,No noticeable side effects initially_ but after several months noticed hair loss_ short - term memory problems_ and severe bruising from small impacts that would not have resulted in bruising before taking the drug. intermittent problems with skin rashes.,Lyrica at 150 mg_ twice per day reduces_ but does not eliminate the intermittent stabbing and constant burning pain due to the nerve damage on my right side_ near the belt line. I also use Lidocaine patches applied at night to aid in sleeping. (The pain would often cause me to wake during the night). I have now lost all the hair on my arms and legs_ all underarm hair_ most chest hair_ and am rapidly balding. Bruising_ mostly on arms_ looks bad but I do not seem to bleed abnormally from minor cuts and scrapes. Short - term memory loss_ forgetting names and conversations_ is the most disturbing side effect. No significant weight gain.,M,75,2  years,10/21/2008Email,Lyrica
856, 3, ,Prescribed Lyrica initially for anxiety. Developed undiagnosed viral infection leaving me with extreme skin sensitivity and persistent sharp stabbing pain. Started with 50 mg 3x a day 4 days ago . Within 2 hours of taking 50 mg pain had subsided to a manageable level. This is where things start to get weird. I  immediatly started to feel depressed and confused with thoughts racing at times. I'm not sure if this correlates at all but I'm experiencing flu like symptoms that have not subsided. I've increased my dosage to 200 mg total and am starting to notice hand tremors. The verdict is not out yet for me but I'm impressed with the theraputic effects. If side effects continue I may be forced to evaluate another medication.

857, 1, Foot neuromas,Depression set in very soon after starting the drug. I then noticed problems with memory and thinking in general - it was a general foggy condition. I experienced heart palpations several times that I don't generally have. I was sleepy more during the day. I had to force myself to do my routine running exercise and I couldn't go nearly as far or as long as usual. There was a general apathy in everything I tried to do.,Though I did have some relief from the pain in my feet_ the depression and memory problems worried me a lot!! I had some pretty worrisome thoughts and concluded that the minor relief came at a high price! When I stopped the drug I started to feel the fog lift after a day and then I was able to return to a more normal feeling with regard to the depression.THIS DRUG IS POWERFUL AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO READ THIS SITE BEFORE TAKING THE MEDICATION. It may help some with extreme conditions_ but for me it is a definite NOGO.,M,62,9  days,10/12/2008,Lyrica
858, 3, pain from stenosis of the c-spine,Dizziness_ brain fog_ edema_ dry mouth_ headache.,I wouldn't necessarily recommend this drug.  HOWEVER_ I do believe in some cases this medication would be very beneficial.  It does help control pain but it seems that I had to increase the dose too often and I was so swollen that I was miserable.  The main problem is that if you have to stop taking it_ it's very hard to discontinue.  I felt like I had the flu for several weeks and I titrated down to 50mg for a couple of weeks before I stopped.  Just be prepared for this if you have to discontinue it for some reason.,F,37,3  months,10/10/2008,Lyrica
859, 5, suspected fibromyalgia,I have not experienced side affects.  Maybe a little constipation.,This drug is a miracle drug.  I have been in pain for 31/2 years that has gotten worse over the years.  The day before I started taking this drug I tried to walk four laps around a track and couldn't do it.  I took 50mg before going to bed.  Slept great and felt great in the morning.  I was able to walk the 4 laps the next day.  Leg pain_ lower back pain_ neck pain and the pin and needle feeling I had has just about disappeared all together.,F,43,3  weeks,10/8/2008,Lyrica

He says it helps with pain but complains about memory problems. As an outsider_ I also see complete apathy_ a sort of locked in behavior_ extreme decrease of intelligence_ cannot keep track of a simple conversation_ lack of reasoning skills and unaware of this happening.

862, 1, posible seizures_ fibromyal,major weight gain_ and sever swelling of feet legs and hands. I feel like a giant marshmello just puffed up every were.,this medication has done nothing for me to releave the pain from my fibromyal  pain. If anything its made it worse due to the swelling in all my joints. If I sit down for more than a couple minuets those first few steps once getting up are so painful.I'll never take this again. I'm currently lowering my does from three hundred milograms a day to nothing. If I had it my way and the doctor hadn't pitched such a fit I would have stopped taking it cold turky. but he went on and on about having withdraw problems and possibly being sent into another seizure from the sudden stop.,F,45,2  months,10/7/2008,Lyrica
863, 5, RSD/CRPS,VERY FIRST DOSES I was out of it_ very confused and slow.  But those quickly went away. Now I have very small tremors...but seeing as I'm taking 4 different medications a day_ it could be from any one of them.,I don't mean to knock the Fibromyalgia patients_ but it sounds like a lot of the negative side-effects effect those patients.  Maybe it's not for Fibro. patients.I noticed (I believe I'm the 4th or 5th) patient with RSD/CRPS-which is a terrible disease I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  Lyrica literally saved my life.  This disease would put thoughts in your head you never thought you were capable of thinking.  The constant_ unrelenting pain_ inability to concentrate or do anything productive because all you feel is that someone is torturing you over and over again and no one will stop it.  Well Lyrica is a a life saver.  I think for RSD patients it's a miracle drug.  I haven't had any main or small side effects that would make me give it up.  I literally wouldn't be alive without it.

864, 3, Nerve Pain in back and legs,Extreme weight gain--40 lbs in 4 months!  Severe edema in knees_ ankles_ feet_ hands.  Memory loss_ night terrors_ severe sweating_ dry mouth_ early on there was a loss in balance_ but that improved after I had been on it a while.,It was a life saver for me and combined with an opiate_ it really helped my pain level. However_ I keep trying to go off of it because I hate the side effects.  They are still there and I am down to a dose of 50 mg three times a week.  Each time I try to go off completely_ my pain level jumps right back up to being unbearable.  I would recommend this drug only as a last resort.,F,53,1  years,10/4/2008Email,Lyrica
865, 3, Fibromyalgia/Arthritis,Weight gain; fatigue; very strange nails_ they aren't coming off yet but they are thick and the white tip is extending half-way into the nailbed like another posted_ also skin around the nail is peeling (I didn't associate this with the Lyrica until I saw the other post that hit my nail symptoms on the head - no pun intended)Lab tested neg. for fungus; now getting headaches/migrains.,I've been on this drug about 8 months. Began with low dose and worked up to 75mg 3x day.  Side-effects were too severe with higher doses.  After about 7 months_ began having migrains.  They aren't extremely bad but are definately annoying and have caused some temporary vision impairment.  Dr. suggested I cut back my dose.  I am now at 50mg 3x day.  Headaches have improved but not disappeared.  Not absolutely certain headaches/migrains are from Lyrica but highly suspected.  Fibro pain is definately better with this drug than without but I am concerned about side-effects at this point.  The nail thing is disturbing_ along with the weight gain (10lbs)_ and the headaches. Also experienceing some calf pain and warming that travels from my left mid calf down to my toes.  Unsure at this point if it is from Lyrica.  The jury is still out for me with this drug.  It seems to have good potential if I can get the side-effects under control.,F,44,8  months,10/4/2008,Lyrica

Losing my bearings suddenly was a constant problem.  I could not take the pills directly from the bottle.  I had to get a daily pill reminder box.  I was constantly forgetting if I had taken the medicine.If you do decide to take this drug_ keep close tabs on your psyche.  Communicate everything and anything with your doctor.  It cause so many issues that I had to abrubtly stop taking my 3 X 75mg dose after 4 months.It did stop the nerve pain which was causing sleepness nights among other things.  This is the first thing the neurologist prescribed.  I will see what other options are out there.I think if you have good working brain chemistry to begin with it may be alright.

Unless you have withdrawn from a highly addictive narcotic/opiate_ then I guess that a little discomfort is too much for you.  Everyone is complaining about moodiness_ nausea_ etc when they stop taking Lyrica.  Try to stop taking Oxycontin and Percocet and Methadone and Lortab and all of the other pain medications out there (on your own)_ and then try to stop taking the Lyrica.  I guarantee that a little bit of discomfort from the Lyrica is nothing compared to what you will feel for a week or so when you stop taking a REAL addictive medication.  Stop complaining and just go on with life_ even if you feel like you have the flu-like feeling.  BABIES!!!,F,36, ,9/18/2008,Lyrica

Granted_ if I sleep enough_ drag myself to the gym and take my anti-depressants. I'm ok. Withdrawal sucks. My secret to weight loss on such a high dose? I'm on 450 mg of WELLBUTRIN/day. It makes me not want to eat. The memory loss though_ affects the limbic system and that is the pain/pleasure center. I don't think about food.

The weight gained in the beginning is now gone along with a lot more.. 30lbs more. I can't stand the skin sensitivity that sent me looking for relief_ but I don't think I can live with this either. Losing consciousness without warning and falling into things is no fun either. IF YOU WANT TO TRY THIS OR NEED TO TAKE IT_ DO SO WITH THE SMALLEST DOSE POSSIBLE. I believe this has caused the Vitamin D deficiency I have had for at least 6 months as well. And the weakness from it has me feeling as though I'm 76 instead of 56.

887, 1, Unknown diag. due to pregnancy,I was put on lyrica after giving birth back in January 08.  Took 100 mg. a day (3x a day for two months) because my foot  atrophied and I had a foot pain that was unbearable (drs. first thought neuropathy or RSD).  Of all the drs. seen_ no one was able to determine a cause and though lyrica would help the nerve pain in my foot.  After taking this drug for 2 months_ I started having paresthesia in both hands_ feet and top of head.  I called my doctor and she suggested coming off the drug over a couple of 2-3 weeks.  Because I began freaking out (panic attacks_ anxiety_ joint pain from the medication) I stopped taking lyrica all together.  I must say_ the withdrawal was AWEFUL (lasted about 2-3 weeks). I have not felt the same since_ still have occasions where I have some tingling in my hand and foot_ have some joint pain (in my back) and have now been diagnosed with osteoporosis.  I believe lyrica did a number on my body!  I am slowly getting better but 8 months later still going throug,I would never take this medication again in my life nor would I recommend it.  If a dr. does not have a clear cut reason why this medication is a medication for you_ DO NOT take it.

Have since tried to wean down to 3x100_ and hope to go lower.  Even reducing the amount does not alleviate the side effects.  I also had 2 surgeries to deaden the nerves in my back with no success.  Tried the TENS machine for nerve damage with no success.  Started taking Ultram ER 200 daily and increased to 300 daily.  I so wish there was a natural alternative to these highly addictive meds.  If anyone knows of something natural that would help the pain_ please let us know.  I have tried many natural herbs and a lot of Vitamin Bs which is supposed to help heal the nerves.

She has only had a couple of lucid or clear hours during this time.  Her doctors at first suspected Lyrica-now her new doctors haven't told us anything yet-but after all we have read and experiences we have heard about_ it seems very likely lyrica is to blame.  They can find nothing wrong with her.","We have heard many stories of people taking lyrica and reporting confusion and ""lost time'-but none to the extreme as my sister-she only took the pills 2 a day for 6 days-the sample size.

897, 4, Fibromyalgia,Definite fuzzy brain & some chest tightness.  No weight gain - no hair loss.  Just very fuzzy - need to really space out pills or just try to take one and not get as much pain relief.  Fuziness has not made me unable to do work or made my sleepy - so I'm able to work fine - hard to explain - almost like I'm aware of the presence of my brain in my head? Dry mouth.,Has helped with the fibromyalgia pain if you can cut through the fuzziness. I was feeling incapacitated by the pain prior to taking it - could not even drive to work (20 miles) or work at my computer without wanting to cry.  I can now manage these things a bit longer due to the Lyrica. It  hasn't cured me_ but it has helped.  Don't take late afternoon or night if you drink.  I enjoy a glass of wine at night_ so I don't take it past 3 pm or it wipes me out.,F,39,45  days,8/8/2008Email,Lyrica

900, 4, fibromyalgia,weight gain (10 lbs)_ blurred vision_ heart palpitations_ hair loss_ loss of sex drive (as in NONE),"For me_ Lyrica is so worth it!  Before I was placed on this drug_ I could barely walk_ and the pain was so disabling that I had to use a wheelchair to walk more than a few feet.  I hate taking drugs_ so I started very slowly with this 50mg to 75mg to 150mg to 175mg per day.  I worked with different times of day to take it_ and found 9:30 am and 7 pm worked best. FMS is tough for task oriented people_ and one of the things I found hardest to do was learn to say ""no_ I can't do that right now"". You learn_ or you suffer more!  I'm blessed that I have a sister who works with me_ and doesn't get embarrased (like my husband does) when I can't do something or need a wheelchair.

901, 4, Fibromyalgia Pain_ etc.,Some weight Gain_ but I was underweight from the stress of the extreme pain I was in I barely ate once a day.  Now I am eating healthier_ 2 to 3 times a day.  My muscle fitigue used to cause me to tremor_ On lyrica that doesn't happen as severly or last as long.  Minor dizziness.,Fibromyalgia comes with insomnia_ muscle fitigue & tremors_ anxiety from strategizing how on earth one will accomplish all that needs to be done_ that one can't seem to get done effectively.  Am I right!  I had insomia and discovered to take 15mg of melatonin at night_ which helped tremendoulsy_ but it didn't stop my mind from racing (anxiety). Lyrica has helped/calmed my racing thoughts.  My husband and my teenagers all say I am much calmer and less stressed during the day_ too!  I'm on 100mg in the am and 100mg in the pm.  I built up to that dosage in 50mg increments over two months.  My Dr. has said to increase my activity_ as I am able to endure it_ to help off-set the weight gain.  The longer I've been on it_ dizziness has lessened.  My Dr. said to take it WITH food_ so it doesn't come on me in a flash/rush causing startling dizziness as it did when I took it on an empty stomach.  It's not a cure-all_ but it has sure helped alot so I'm staying ON this medicine.,F,39,3  months,8/4/2008,Lyrica

I usually react negatively to meds within the first week so I was very optimistic when no side effects appeared. I took Lyrica for 3 months before getting hit full force will all my side effects at the same time. I have stopped taking it and have an appointment with my doctor in a few days to address the side effects and I know I will not be taking Lyrica again.

If this is supposed to relieve the pain_ what's wrong with this picture?,"I started thinking about being on this for life since there's no ""cure"" for idiopathic peripheral neuropathy. Frankly_ if I'm going to give money to someone every month_ I'd rather it be a Pilates instructor or a naturopath doctor than Pfizer.

Pain has recurred but is much less so I can tolerate it as I also take Percocet for post operative recovery from shoulder repair of rotator cuff.  I had shingles one month following surgery so I had double whammy of pain all on same side of body.,Lyrica helped with the burning pain that I had following shingles & allowed me to sleep when the shingles pain was at its worse.

Arthritic-like pain in hands and feet can't bend fingers or open jars. My muscles feel like concrete it is really bad first thing in the morning. Someone mentioned this same symptom on this sight. I have the same one and it is the middle two fingers on my right hand are so stiff and sore. I also have that sensation in the first finger on my right hand and the toes in my left foot. Foggy brain - forgeting names dates words I call it Lyrica-Brain when describing to other people_ euphoric feelings_ constipation_ sleepiness during the day.,Lyrica has saved me in some ways and destroyed me in others. I had shingles in the groin area and now have post herpetic neuralgia. I get itching_ burning_ stinging pain that never goes away. The itching alone makes me go crazy. Lyrica is the only thing that calms the nerves down. My mood has improved greatly on a regular basis and I now sleep like a baby. I also have fibromyalgia and I have not slept well in several years. However_ the other side effects are becoming just as disabling as the nerve problems. I can't bend in the middle anymore. I have gone up 3 clothing sizes. My muscles are like concrete and I can barely move. I can't exercise hardly at all. It wouldn't matter anyway because nothing takes the weight off. I just wish the side effects weren't so bad because otherwise it works just fine. I am having to pursue other options because the side effects are too much to bear.

Seems like a beta blocker for the brain.,On 75 mg's twice daily. Worked better with 25 mg's of Zoloft - the two worked better than either one alone. Seemed liked they worked in synergy. You will suffer depression otherwise w/out the Zoloft. Better sleep than I've had in years.  Less pain - more energy. I'd stay on it except for the hair loss.

I work in a major hospital and financially unable to stop working.  I was taking 800mg of Ibuprofen to help me through at work and my Rheumatologist put me on Lyrica.  I was already on Cymbalta bc he said it had something for pain and would help my depression.  After about a month my pain came back and I would still have to eat Ibuprofen along w/ Lyrica.

Some days I take 0.5 mg of lorazapam to blunt anxiety and irritability. I was a kinder person before taking this drug_ but I was pretty close to being dysfunctional_ so the trade-off seems reasonable. Another reviewer wrote about sinus headaches. Before reading her comments_ I wasn't sure if Lyrica was the culprit. Severe headaches hit me hard 2 months after starting with Lyrica and lasted about a month. Now I only feel an occassional remnant_ accompanied by increased anxiety and irritability. That's when I B-line for the lorazapam.,F,56,5  months,6/12/2008,Lyrica

My wife thought this was great :-)_ but it was pretty frustrating for me.  After going off_ urination and ejaculation returned to normal.

My doctor still doesn't believe that all of this could be caused by the medication but I have started to taper off on my dose and have noticed an immediate improvement in my concentration and the strength in my hands so we will discuss it at my next appointment.  I am so glad I happened to come across this website_ it just reinforces that I am not the only one having these problems!

Plus_ things that used to provide pleasure in my world of living with fibromyalgia no longer matter. I am now being weaned off the drug. (in my 6th month) Also_ I would like to describe 2 other effects that I contribute to Lyrica. I have been Post-menapausal for 8 years. The hair on my legs had become extremely fine and grew slowly. In the last 3 months I have seen a great increase in leg hair. And_ it is very coarse. Also...I am cold. I still experience low grade fevers from the Fibro_ but find that I am unusually cold most of the time now. (I live in California) Initially I was pleased with Lyrica's affect on my pain. It DID ease much of the deep burning pain_ especially in my neck and shoulders. But I want to feel better emotionally and feel less bloated and less foggy... so right now I welcome the return of my burning pain.",I cannot say that I do not reccomend this drug. It has helped a couple of people in my Chronic Pain Management classes. I am simply providing my experience and observations.

Current dosage is 75mg twice daily. Started out 75mg once a day for 2 weeks.  Neurologist wanted to up it to 3X per day_ but I said no way could I handle a higher dose.",Does seem to have mellowed out the pain level somewhat following a double cervical fusion (C5-6-7) for herniated discs with stenosis.  Two years post-op_ and am able to do just about anything I want except drive for long periods of time.  I believe that is due to the Lyrica_ with the resultant dizziness & vertigo feelings.  The only good thing I can say about it is that I've slept fairly well while on it.  No weight gain_ but do tend to retain water overnight_ and spend a fair amount of time in the bathroom in the mornings because of it.  Sheesh_ you just can't win.

954, 3, Fibromyalgia,Previously on Neurontin. Started on 75mg_gradually weaned off of Neurontin while increasing Lyrica to 75mg 4 times a day. Put on 10 lbs_ so I started Nutrisystem. Passed out a couple of times_ I had low Blood Sugar. Unable to tolerate 75mg. 4x a day decreased to 2 times a day. I was reluctant to discontinue med d/t increased pain relief. Problem with Sciatica for the last 6 weeks which got worse. I increased Lyrica to 3 times a day from twice a day. Seen by Physical Therapist who said I have pronounced muscle weakness. That is a side effect of Lyrica. I have also noticed that I am experiencing hair loss. I am going to call my doctor today to get different pain management program. I have also been on Skelaxin and Darvocet N 100 for pain relief. I will probably go back to the Neurontin. MD will probably wean me off of Lyrica and reintroduce the Neurontin at the same time. This is of great concern to me because I haven't been able to do anything d/t pain of sciatica. Decreased endurance_d,Darn_ this medicine did work for pain relief at first utill the muscle weakness asthenia caused the Sciatica_ which I ignored. As anyone who has Fibromyalgia knows_ you push yourself when you want to get things done_ pay the price with increased pain_ rest and then with meds you usually feel better. I am unable to do this now that the muscle weakness and Sciatic is so pronounced my activity is down to just walking around the house and at the store whenI am up to it.,F,59,6  months,5/22/2008Email,Lyrica

958, 4, peripheral neuropathy,Bradycardia with (PR interval prolongation) ,Overall favorable but effects more pronounced at first with lessening of pain relief due to some accommodation of efficacy. This accommodation is very similar to that seen in Neurontin. Although I speak as a patient as a retired physician I can attest to the remarkable efficacy of the drug for bone fide cases of peripheral neuropathy. However_ I caution anyone having any allergic/hypersensitivity symptoms to see their physician ASAP. Significant mental deficiencies/ bizarre or especially suicidual ideations are a cause for concern and one should consult their physician ASAP.

If I actually do manage to get around_ I'm so disoriented and forgetful it takes me 4 times as long to do routine things that I'm always late_ which just exacerbates the sense of futility_ the depression and the agitation.

I've never suffered hair loss_ and my Dr. thought it might be due to the trauma from my surgery and subsequent hospitalization--but that kind of hair loss should be broken hairs_ the poor protein processing from my trauma 4 months ago now having grown out and causing breakage at the weak spot.  Additionally_ I cannot ejaculate.  Originally_ I thought this_ too_ was a function of my surgery (which was extensive and life-saving)_ but after reading other people's comments here_ I'm wondering if it's the Lyrica.,As for my pain_ it IS diminished.  Hooray!  But I am getting closer to abandoning it for the hair loss problem.  I tried Neurontin briefly_ and it upset my stomach and caused strange bloating feelings_ etc.  I'm about willing to go back to it and suffer through those symptoms...if it'll make my hair stop falling out!,M,35,2  months,4/13/2008,Lyrica

As a fitness instuctor_ the weight gain is not acceptable and I have already noticed.  All these ""feel better"" drugs seem to have that weight gain side effect.",I have tried many medications and treaments these past few years and have found NOTHING that really takes the pain away...aside from knocking me out...not a good idea as the mother of 4! Found Lyrica to be unremarkable and as I have been living with the pain for so long_ another irritation ( the extremely dry mouth and weight gain) is not worth it to me. Cymbalta is the ONLY drug I will take that I feel truely lives up to it's name.,F,42,2  days,4/11/2008,Lyrica

My hands and shoulders have TIC-symptoms perticulary a few hours after taking the drug.,It helps with my back pain but I need to take Neurotin on top of it.

991, 3, fibromyalsia,I slept better_ but felt pretty high all day_ even on a very low dose. The pain was reduced so I stayed with it_ even though I was gaining weight so fast my clothes did not fit. Finally woke up with a full body rash_ that tells me I am allergic.,It works for pain_ I was lovin' it at first because for 10 years I have been a RX experiment.  Been on every possible drug and most did little or nothing to stop the pain.  Lyrica allowed me to get out of bed and walk_ not limp. But after 6 weeks I woke up this morning with a full body rash. Along with the 15 pounds I gained_ I guess this drug will not work for me. Too bad_ as it really can be life changing if you can tolerate it.

I am also taking amitriptyline 30mg at night up to 6x530mg co-codamol and 3x 600mg ibuprofen_does anyone know if knocking off something else will work_ I have had the pain now for 4years it is wonderful to have something that takes it away_ but if the side effects stay I will just drop down a level have some pain but no effects.,M,38,5  weeks,4/6/2008Email,Lyrica
993, 3, Fibromyalgia,Originally_ I noticed some swelling of my ankles. This seems to have subsided somewhat. I also felt some sadness and depression_ not good because I have enough of that without adding any on. What I would like to know is if anyone else gets chills taking this medication? This seems to be my primary side effect and I have not seen it specifically listed_ although I know it is mentioned in some of the trial tests.,Not certain I'm going to stay on this.

Dr said that fibro was the problem and could not be treated by surgery. I got on Lyrica and in one day I felt great! I do take Cymbalta as well and Ambien at night. I feel almos the same as I did before this dang thing (Fibro) took over my life. If I have a drink at dinner_ I do fall asleep during the news_ though.

When I got outside I saw on the bill I'd paid Interac but I could not remember punching in my code_ etc... very scary. Off of Lyrica now for 2.5 weeks and had another small blank but at least this time with concentration I was able to recall the missing moment. Swelling in face went down and bloating too.

Lower dose does not make me sleepy anymore.  This is the best pain relief I have had in 10 years.  No swelling_ weight gain or other problems_ maybe because I was opoid tolerant to start out.

I do worry about coming off them. But I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.  Not as much worried about the pain_ but about the drug withdrawal. I did try to ween myself off the prednizone (stupid_ but dr. didn't call me back and I was running out of them) and ran out of Lyrica at the same time_ that was a disaster!

Thank God my husband realized it was the drug_ threw them out and saved my life. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!And my hair is falling out!!,What a terrifying drug reaction! I was prescribed LYRICA for chronic pain of fibromyalgia and PTSD. I have been taking oxycodone for three years with no adverse side effects. Taking 75mg Lyrica twice a day caused me to lose control of my life. I became anxious_ forgetful_ lost things I would never lose_ forgot to take my other drugs_mentally confused_ forgot where I was driving to on the interstate_went to the wrong terminal to catch a flight although my husband dropped me at the right one_irritable_ irrational. I became so completely depressed I wanted out of my body_ my life_ my home_ my marriage_ all of these thoughts are not ME. It felt very sane to me at the time to decide how to poison my dogs and cats because no one else could take care of them better than me. Since I knew I was driving my car into a tree to commit suicide it seemed logical to me to tell my husband horrible things that were not true so he would think less of me and not be so hurt by my suicide.

I've only been on it a few days_ starting at 50mg 1x a day_ upping it 2 days ago to 2X a day. Since going to the 100mg./day dose_ I've had some abdominal cramping and mild dizziness_ but nothing too bad yet. I've been able to sleep very well with this drug_ it stopped chronic deep cramping pain in my ankles and hands within 2 days_ and doesn't make me throw up or sleep the day away like most of the other drugs I've tried! Pain has gone from 7-8 range down to a 2-3_ except for a little pain when walking that's probably due to joint damage_ nothing much I can do there_ but the Lyrica seems to help that better than Tylenol #3 (the only pain reliever I can take without vomiting and migraines).,M,46,5  days,1/13/2008,Lyrica

Additional 8 lb. gain in 8th mo. resulted in congestive heart failure_ shortness of breath_ extreme bone_ joint and soft tissue pain from shoulders_chest_ elbows_ through hips to bottom of feet.  Pain interrupted sleep for 2 months.  Mattress pressure exacerbated ability to sleep with feet elevated.  Diuretics were ineffective with side effects.  Self-medicated with Advil for pain relief_ but Advil further complicated my condition.After being off Lyrica 3 months I was prescribed Nurontin for pain treatment_ but feet swelling and 3 lb. weight gain reinforced my inability to take this class of drug.,Blood_ urine labs and cardiology exams supported fluid build up around my heart and kidney disfunction.  Weight loss was slow as was improvement in pain syndrome and ability to sleep.  My body healed itself over time.Mayo wanted to admit me to their Fibromyalgia Clinic however_ I knew that was not my problem and did not wish to be labeled.At 10 months off Lyrica I rarely get shortness of breath when talking & multitasking.

It worked wonderfully_ the first medication that actually made the pain go away until it was time to take the next pill. The possitive surprise of the medication was that I found that the constant Sadness and Anxiety_ which I felt as part of my Depression_ went away with Lyrica. I have since found out that the Statins that I was taking to control my blood lipids in time brought on the Trigeminal Pain_ and have now stopped taking the Statins. Within a week of ending the Statins_ the pain in the nerve lessened_ and now_ a month later_ I have been able to cut down on the Lyrica to 3 times per day. My jaw pain is gone after suffering with it for 2 years_ but I also have De Quervain's tenosynovitis in both my thumbs and wrists_ and I find that the Lyrica seems to help that too_ besides the positive effect it has on my depression.

Research showed Lyrica can cause low platelet counts_ or thrombocytopenia. It can be very serious. So I have to quit this stuff. I am sorry about that_ because it helped the pain.

It took me almost three weeks of trial and error to find the right dose and timing and get used to it. I am taking 100 mg twice a day_ rather than 3 times a day and it works well for me so far.

It does seem to be helping with pain -- currently at level 2_ down from level 4-6 with spikes to 9 -- but I think I'll need more time to be sure it's the Lyrica. Probably_ since this is a lower level of pain than I've had in some time. That being said_ if symptons don't diminish I'll probably try switching back to gabapentin/neurontin at a higher dose.

So far so good!,Most of my nerve pain has diminished while taking this drug_ My feet and hands barely hurt while taking this drug. Yeah!!!! Other parts of my body also seem to feel better.

1213, 4, Compressed nerves in shoulder/neck,Some dizziness and disorientation_ dry mouth.  Occasional inability to talk properly_ felt as if tongue was swollen or not responding how it should.  Personality changes; increase in general anxiety.  Occasional inability to think properly cloudy brain.  Reduction in ability to notice I had to go to the bathroom; constipation as a result.,Initially I had very little response to the drug.  After increasing the dose to 75mg in the morning and 150mg in the evening and then later 150mg morning and night I had a reduction in pain as well as a dramatic reduction in numbness/tingling in my arm.  Nothing else I have done has helped.  Ive had a fair amount of side effects_ but in my case_ the benefits far outweigh the side effects since I am now able to perform normal daily tasks I could not before.,F,23,4  weeks,6/22/2007Email,Lyrica

1216, 4, cervicogenic muscle spasm,Enabled sleep. Some swelling of fingers but not very bad.,I quit this drug at 75mg a day_ because it aggravated a skin condition I've always had: aquagenic urticaria/pruritis_ caused bloating and I thought it also caused depersonalization episodes. I went back on 30-40mg (roughly 1/2 of a 75mg capsule each night) and it is enough to help with pain from scarred nerves_ allows me to sleep_ actually lessens pain from aquagenic pruritis_ and let me cut back on narcotic pain killers a little bit. I now have mininal peripheral edema_ and no depersonalization. So_ if you had bad results at one dose_ you might want to try again in a while at a lower dose. This drug's side effects can go from one extreme to another depending on dosage. If you have neuropathic pain from scarred nerves it can be a real help.,F,52,2  weeks,6/8/2007,Lyrica

The pain relief was never dramatic_ but it did seem to provide some modification to pain. Decided to step down from the drug because it seemed to lose effectiveness_ and don't want to keep increasing dose to get relief due to side effects. Thankfully_ no weight gain_ blurred vision_ or other issues. Do be warned that coming off this drug leads to a headache and nausea feelings.

Also_ pain relief not enough to allow me to cut back on percocet and valium. I suspect Lyrica in greater doses (150 to 225mg/day) may even be aggravating pain. Finally_ the relief of pain seemed to drop off after the morning confusion went away.

Its getting harder and harder to walk very far because I can't catch my breath. Sometimes when I'm typing_ my fingers and hands jump around so bad_ it takes twice as long to type anything.,One reason for the dramatic side effects has been the fact that I already take many other CNS (central nervous system) medications that can also cause twitching_ sedation_ etc. I was already taking up to the limit to where these kinds of symptoms would begin to occur. When you add meds that intensify those symptoms_ then hopefully you can go off them. The other CNS drugs I take already_ I don't dare go off them because they are very necessary.
