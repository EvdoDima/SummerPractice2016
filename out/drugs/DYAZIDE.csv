0, 1, Meniere's disease,"After the first dose_ I started experiencing a rapid heart beat.  It felt like my heart was going to come out of my chest.  I normally have a "" lowered"" bp_ so I could feel my bp was doing something abnormal.  I felt shaky_ disoriented and anxious.  I decided to try it one more day knowing that medications have possible reactions_ maybe it was just me_ so the second dose just brought on more reactions.  After this dose_ my ""anxious"" feeling got more intense_ my heart rate elevated again_ and about an hour after taking it_ my lips and face started tingling.  That was enough for me!!!  I called my doctor next day and he took me off of this medication.",I have never taken this medication before.  I was prescribed this medication for treatment of Meniere's disease which I have recently been diagnosed with.  Yes_ it definitely did the job of a diuretic which is what it is supposed to do_ but the side effects for me were enough.  I am going to talk to my doctor and see if there is another alternative diuretic that I can take that does not produce these side effects.  I am sure I am needing to be on something other than controlling my diet and my sodium intake_ but if this is all that is out there to treat my condition_ then I will go without.  The reaction to this medication for me was as bad as trying to recoup from a severe Vertigo attack.....horrible!,F,47,2  days37.5-25 1X D,7/3/2016,Dyazide

5, 4, Edema - Side Effect from Norvasc,I am taking this to treat extreme swelling of my feet and ankles which is likely a side effect of Norvasc (taken for chronic migraine). Within 12 hours of taking Dyazide I had my ankles back! I have had diarrhea for the past two evenings_ but if I can stay hydrated I think it's a small price to pay for being migraine free and being able to wear shoes!,,F,34,3  days25,3/23/2014,Dyazide

The third night I contitaking one @ 8pm even less ueinating @ night_ bit I woke up in the middle of the morning with bad leg cramp.  Now I will see what happen tonight.

Prayer is definitely helping me thru this.,,F,58,1  days,6/16/2013,Dyazide
7, 3, edema in ankles and feet,diarrhea and leg cramps,After a few days the edema went down_ but when diarrhea started I discontinued the Dyazide.  I've gone through this scenario before; you see_ I have UC which has been in remission for over a year and I won't take any med or eat any food that causes the UC to flare.There must be another med to take; else_ I'll live with the edema.,F,72,2  weeks37.5/25 1X D,8/13/2012,Dyazide
8, 3, HBP,I notice my feet sweat alot and vaginal dryness. no extra bathroom trips but I am not retaining water...not sure if this med will work for my issue. BP was 160/110 almost a week ago check last night after exercise and was 130/92. Dont know if its the med or the exercise_ go back to the dr on 4/29. Plan: lose 5-10lbs and keep exercising.,Dont want long term meds_ too young but bad fam history and over weight. I think weight loss will take care of the problem. plan to be off med by 7/2012,F,27,5  days37 1X D,5/15/2012Email,Dyazide
9, 1, Meniere's Disease,Felt like death warmed over and the worst hangover of my life.  My BP fluctuated wildly; headache_ severe nausea_ light-headedness_ couldn't stand for more than a few minutes_ pulse spiking >170 bpm after non-stressful activities (walking up 6 stairs)_ BP would bottom out with no notice - suddenly I would be sitting on the floor_ unable to even try to stand.,I was prescribed Dyazide to help with daily bouts of vertigo from Meniere's Disease.  My BP has always been in the normal range_ tending toward the lower end of normal_ so a medication typically used for high BP caused me lots of problems.  I called the doc's office after 8 days of terrible side effects; they told me to stop taking it and stick to a low sodium diet instead.  I would rather have daily vertigo than deal with the terrible side effects from Dyazide.,F,26,8  days 1X D,1/13/2012,Dyazide
10, 3, HBP,I have been taking this drug since I was 36_ now that I am older(48) I have noticed some side effects such as the tingling_ in toes_ & hands on occasion. If I miss taking it for a week_ my ankles begin to feel swollen. It does make me urinate often_ therefore I take this drug before 4pm each day. I have been getting frequent headaches lately and frequent loose bowel movements.,I take this drug along with one other (ATENELOL 100 mg.) They are supposed to work together_ but you must cut the salt out to achieve any results with these two drugs. It is a cheap drug_ and I hope it does not ruin my kidneys_ after long term use. This is something I want to address to my Physician soon.,F,48,12  years,12/11/2009Email,Dyazide
11, 1, high b.p.,I took it in the a.m. and by late afternoon I had to go home from work because I had horrendous head pain and down the back of my neck.  Could not get rid of the head pain until next morning and then the next evening still felt very bad.,I did not take any more of those pills as I was certainly afraid of the same thing happening again.,F,57,1  days,6/4/2009,Dyazide
12, 3, Hypertension,For the first month I was taking the drug I had Hot Flashes constantly.  They lasted for about 1 month only.  After being on the drug for 10 months I began to get foot cramps and am feeling fatigued 4 to 5 days a week.  It has controlled my Hypertension and my reading are in the normal range on a daily basis.,,F,52,14  months,6/3/2009,Dyazide
13, 1, Hypertension,I have been taking this for 3 days.  I have tingling in hands and feet_ cramping in legs_ have no energy and feel very much out of it.  Dizzy and headaches low grade.  I am in good shape and a runner_ very sad that I have high blood pressure at 47.,,F,47,3  days,4/14/2009,Dyazide
14, 4, HP,None until a year ago. Then tinnitus started in ears. Now have in both ears and tingling throughout body. Sometimes feels like something crawling inside or feeling of buzzing in body.  Dr considering taking me off and using beta blocker with other diuretics.,,F,, ,2/27/2009,Dyazide
15, 3, Borderline hypertension,First two weeks_ got dizzy changing positions.  Already have an inner ear problem so didn't like the extra dizzies.  Now top right teeth are cold sensitive.  Unsure if related.  BP getting slightly lower.  Vague headaches frequently.  No weight loss.,Meds generally freak me out.  Would rather control with diet_ alternative therapies.  Potassium was checked and is okay.  Heart flutters.  Triglyceride levels through the roof but difficult to believe that could be related.  Jury's not in on this yet for me.,F,65,5  weeks,11/30/2008,Dyazide
16, 5, high blood pressure,I am a 51 year old female with first time high blood pressure.  After three weeks on dyazide I've lost 11 pounds! I don't retain fluids and I'm not having the problem with constant urination like others noted here. I cannot use any other type of BP meds because I'm a asthmatic so beta blockers will not work well with my asthma meds. Anyway_ bottom line with dyazide I'm just simply not hungry (this is a good thing as I'm about 35 pounds overweight).  I do feel dizzy occasionally and initially had a sense of restlessness_ but that is subsiding.  I would recommend this medication. BP is down_ weight is down.  A GOOD THING!,,F,51,3  weeks,10/24/2008,Dyazide
17, 4, Borderline HTN,I started having dizziness after 1 year on the dyazide. I has kept my B/P down marvelously_ however if I skip any doses I can feel my hands and feet swelling.  Not sure but have started having tinnitis_ it's aggravating.  I have feet_ and leg cramps_ so far my potassium level is o.k._ but the cramps come 6 hours after dosing if I do not hydrate myself well.,I am wondering has anyone else experienced tinnitis with dyazide_ along with uncomfortable itching.  My itching may be due to the bath & body work products I use every day.  I notice a decrease in itching a week after I stop using bath & body works but it has not completely stopped yet.,F,47,1  years,9/16/2008,Dyazide
18, 2, hbp,Nausea.  I only take this every other day_ not only doesn't it seem to work but I am nauseous every once in a while,,F,62,2  years,1/6/2008,Dyazide
19, 4, Hypertension and edema,"I  have chronic hypertension and idiopathic edema_ and after an 80 lb weight loss_ my Dr. took me off Norvasc and HCTZ and put me on Dyazide because my BP was much more normal_ but I still needed a mild antihypertensive.  Dr. told me to take it every day. On day #4 I experienced sudden vertigo and passed out in my kitchen floor. When I ""woke up"" I was sweating profusely and very weak. My BP wouldn't even register on my BP machine_ it was so low. I now take a Dyazide every third day. It is just enough to keep my BP normal. I urinate very frequently of course after I take for around 12 hours_ and always experience some muscle twitching and muscle cramps (mainly feet & legs) the day after taking it. My electrolytes are always normal when they are checked.I no longer have chronic edema like I did. It's great having normal sized feet and ankles! I don't feel like a water balloon anymore.",Dyazide literally decreases my Systolic BP and Diastolic BP by about 20+ points each when I take one_ and taking one every 3 days or so works great for me. I feel like the antihypertensive effects peak at about 24 hours for me.  BP will run around 130/80 and then when I take one_ it will decrease to around 100-110/60. I do experience occasional orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. My BP will gradually creep back up over the next 3 days or so_ until I take another one. Dyazide has a potent effect on my BP personally. It seems to decrease my BP more than Diovan HCT or Norvasc ever did.  Of course_ it could just be that I lost down to a normal weight and it's just mild HTN now. I like the fact that I am only taking one pill every 3 days_ it totally takes care of my chronic edema_ and generally keeps my BP normal.  I do have to watch out for hypotensive episodes sometimes though and make sure I drink 2 liters/day when I take it for hydration.,F,36,1  years,8/21/2007,Dyazide
20, 5, Elevated blood pressure,Extreme craving for salt initially_ none now...was eating a jar of pickles plus drinking pickle juice initially to relieve craving.,Has worked very well in decreasing my BP,F,45,6  months,8/19/2007,Dyazide

22, 2, For my blood pressure and edema,My doctor Prescribed Dyazide and Norvasc to control my blood pressure and the swelling in my legs and feet.According to the medical dictionary Norvasc causes swelling in the legs.I haven't question my doctor about this but I intend to.I have also become sexually disfunctional.My Urologist prescribe Cialis_but it has no get effect on me,I think that the drug would work better if the doctor would suggest a proper diet for the patient or a list of meals that you can choose from that will not increase you sodium intake and lower your blood pressure.,M,62,3  years,6/10/2007Email,Dyazide
23, 4, Hypertension_ edema,I take this in AM and haven't noticed excessive urination. The heachache is chronic_ though_ a nagging 2-3 on a 1-5 scale.I disregarded the sunlight warning one day and my face and neck have a rash that is still irritated and itchy four days later... yow!,Pretty tame Rx_ considering I'm taking it along with Metformin_ Effexor_ Lipitor_ Levothyroxine_ and an antibiotic as well right now.,F,53,28  days,6/6/2007,Dyazide
24, 1, hypertension,Heart flutters; unable to do yard work without feeling weak and exhausted; tightness and aching on the left side of my chest.,I started taking Dyazide at the same time I reduced my Toprol XL dose from 75mg to 50mg so the side effects might be related to taking less Toprol.  Side effects began after 4 days and on the fifth day I went back to taking 75mg of Toprol but symptoms continued.  Quit taking Dyazide after 7 days and the symptoms disappeared.,M,60,7  days,5/23/2007,Dyazide

26, 4, high blood pressure,nothing that I'm bothered by anymore (been on it for years) except needing to pee a lot in the morning (take medication when I get up in the moring) and for about 2-3 hours after taking the medication I have difficulty getting and maintaining an erection. I sometimes take the Dyazide a few hours later if I run in the morning (so don't have to pee so bad on run) or my wife and I have sex in the moring.,,M,50,10  years,4/24/2007,Dyazide

28, 3, Hypertension,Excessive urination all day long. Dry mouth. Sometimes blurred vision. Recently experiencing dry eyes.,May wash out good minerals as well as sodium.  Frequent potassium checks via blood tests should be done_ as Dyazide is a potassium-sparing diuretic.,M,65,4  years,3/2/2007,Dyazide
29, 5, HBP &  Fluid Retention,Only on the first day.....so far just a mild feeling of vertigo after I took it this morning_ but I expect that with any new drug. Frequent urination....so I assume that it has begun doing what it is suppose to since I do have fluid retention as a result of HBP. Blood pressure has been at 186/98. Very high indeed. Took a reading this evening and it was 129/88.,I am hoping that this will help with my HBP issues. Will come back to post progress on this drug in about a week.,F,30,1  days,10/21/2006,Dyazide
30, 2, blood pressure reduction,flushed face_ dizziness and irregular heart beat (missing beat every 5-10 beats - never had this before - really scary). Took myself off. Was taking cardizem cd as well_ and dyazide did not lower my blood pressure. I once had a reaction to a sulfide drug and that might also be part of this - there's a warning about sulfa algery - my doctor didn't seem to know this.,,M,,8  days,10/4/2006,Dyazide
31, 4, High Blood Pressure,"Dizzyness at times_ but also side effect of Effexor. Change in bowels_ sort of constipation. Some people described dry mouth_ I have ""Burning Tongue Syndrome"". It is getting worse and occurred after increase in diazide to 25mg every other day. Could it be a side effect?",With Norvasc_ it helps controlling my blood pressure.

34, 5, Meniere's disease,In the first few days I felt a little weak_ and also felt numbness and tingling in my face_ tongue_ hands etc. But these went away and I no longer feel any side effects.,This drug has been very effective in reducing the incidence of vertigo attacks. In the two months before I started taking it_ I was having 3 or 4 disabling attacks a week. Since I have been taking it I have had only one serious attack in two months. I think my initial side effects were due to the drug lowering my blood pressure_ which was not high to begin with; but since I have gotten used to it I am fine and would highly recommend it.,F,53,2  months,12/31/2004Email,Dyazide
35, 5, borderline high hypertension,Cleared up irritable bowel syndrome by helping kidneys function better (a good side effect).

36, 2, hypertension,severe leg muscle cramping_ arrythmia_ apparently from loss of potassium from excessive urination_and  exhaustion_ but this was more likely the beta blocker I was also taking. This caused fatigue and weight gain. When I developed severe arrythmia (taken to ER) I took myself off the diuretic and the beta blocker.,I read  Dr. Julian Whitaker's book 'Reversing Hypertension' re getting off meds and the adverse effects of long term diuretics and other BP meds. There I found out about potassium. My doc. though sceptical_ prescribed it for me and also changed me to Norvasc. Weight came down_ arrythmia_ cramps_ fatigue stopped.,F,66,2  years,10/8/2004,Dyazide
