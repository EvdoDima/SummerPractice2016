0, 5, PCOS,I was first prescribed ovcon 50 after being on lo estrin 24 fe. I was on six months then weaned off because my Gyno was afraid of blood clot. Since then I've been on 6 other bc pills and none of them worked like this one. Now after 3 years of switching bc constantly and seeing an endocrinologist_ I'm back on ovcon 50. It cleared up many issues the other bc caused (acne_ thinning hair). Everyone responds differently to horomones. Ovcon is high estrogen- some people may need a different horomone or different dose.,,F,23,8  months1x a day,11/30/2012,Ovcon-50
1, 1, Ovarian cists,Tremors (constant uncontrollable twitches_ terrible migraines_ can't focus at all almost like constant brain fog_ lower sex drive_ severe anxiety episodes_ mood swings_ trouble sleeping_ fatigue_ joints and body aches_ increased appetite and EXTREME bloating and can NOT lose weight AT ALL!_ bad depression,I am an extremely health person I eat healthly_ i work out daily and i live a healthy life style. I switched from my previous birth control Ortho-tri cyclen lo to Ovcon for Cyst control. I never had any previous side effects with my previous Birth control usage and i've only been on Ovcon for 2 weeks and the side effects have been terrible. I stopped the pill because it literally is not interfering with my day to day living. Jeans that fit me 3 days ago i can't even get one leg into them. my body typically loses anywhere from 1-3 lbs a week easily with constant exercise and healthy diet. The mood swings_ anixety and depression are unbearable and these are things i have never had a problem with until i tried this pill. I'm now having to go through detox sessions at my dr's to try and get this crap out of my body. I would NEVER recommend this to ANYONE and i am shocked they can prescribe this to people. Terrible terrible form of birth control. do not take!,F,25,2  weeks 1X D,10/19/2012Email,Ovcon-50

4, 5, birth control,this birthcontrol was GREAT until my blood pressure started going up.....and the headaches...and the upset stomach...there are alot of side affects.,ovcon-50 is a good method of birthcontrol but if your blood pressure starts rising i reccomend you stop taking the pills and talk with you gyno.for a diff. method of birthcontrol.,F,24,5  months 1X D,3/24/2011Email,Ovcon-50
5, 5, Birth Control,A couple instances of fainting in the first few days,Other than fainting a couple of times in the first few days_ this pill has been great! I've taken a few different kinds of BC (the patch_ ortho-tri_ etc) and this was by far the best for me.  It cleared up my skin a little bit (complete opposite of ortho-tri_ when I broke out big time!)_ I haven't gained any weight from the pill (just from not working out as much!)_ and my periods are shorter_ much lighter_ and always on time.  My doctor tried putting me on the lower dose_ ovcon-35_ for a while_ but I would start my period a week early and it would last for two weeks.  He put me back on the ovcon-50 and no problems!  I realize there are plenty of people who haven't had good experiences with this_ as everyone's body reacts differently to medications.  But there are enough kinds of birth control out there that you are bound to find one that does work for you!,F,26,7  years50 1X D,12/5/2010,Ovcon-50

7, 1, endometriosis,major mood swings_ horrible cramps_ dizziness_ hot flashes_ weight gain,This medicine didn't really help the endometriosis at all.  The mood swings were incredible (sobbing to screaming in anger multiple times over the course of a few minutes).  The hot flashes were unbearable.  I felt like I was going through menopause at age 14.  The weight gain was bad (extra 30 pounds over the course of taking the medicine).  It was awful being on this medicine and I would rather try my luck with a difference medicine than risk losing my mind on this one.,F,21,4  years50 1X D,11/16/2010,Ovcon-50
8, 5, Heavy periods due to endometriosis,,This is the only birth control out of several that has successfully suppressed my heavy periods. I haven't had any problems while taking it. My only complaint would be that that it is very expensive and few drug stores carry it.,F,19,1  years50 1X D,7/17/2010,Ovcon-50
9, 4, Constant heavy bleeding,Extreme mood swings_ depression_ abdomen pain_ crying_ anger.,I am still taking this medicine despite the side effects I listed because my choices are this or a hyterectomy at age 28.

It only took about 4 days for me to realize this BC is not right for me.  I can't focus_ having severe anxiety_ and cannot sleep.  Stopped taking it immediately and cannot wait for the side effects to go away.,F,27,7  days50 1X D,6/17/2010,Ovcon-50
11, 5, irregular cycles and spotting,None.,I was on 6 other brands of Birth Control pills before Ovcon 50.  Ovcon 50 was the perfect match for me.  It was incredibly expensive_ but totally worth it.  I would only have my period once or twice a year while on it_ so that alone made me love Ovcon 50.  My doctor said that decreased and/or missed periods are common with Ovcon 50.  I just recently stopped taking Ovcon since my husband and I are going to start a family :-),F,34,6  years50 1X D,6/2/2010,Ovcon-50

Lower sex drive_ fatigue_ appetite increased but no weight gain sometimes bloating,I have not had any break through bleeding since I was taken off of my ortho-lo_ tried a few different brands and still break through.

I have had no complications.  My periods have been mild_ short_ and stress free.  My doctor tried to lower me to the 35s but it didn't work out.  My choice is to go for the one that works and stay with it.  I would recommend this medication to anyone who tends to bleed whenever and whereever.  It will be controlled with this medication.,F,35,3  years50 1X D,4/17/2010,Ovcon-50

19, 5, birth control,none,I tried the nuvaring and a different pill before this one and had excessive breakthrough bleeding with both. Since being on ovcon-50 I have lost all my pregnancy weight_ and more. I was experiencing depression with the other two pills and I have not had that at all. My periods last about 3 days (before this I had 7 day periods). Obviously everyone's body will react differently_ but I think this is for sure worth a try.,F,25,18  months,6/17/2009,Ovcon-50

22, 2, Stop breakthrough bleeding,Excessive bloating_ acne(I've always had pretty clear skin)_ weight gain_ loose bowl movements_ trouble sleeping_ fatigue,I got so bloated on this pill that my mother actually asked me if I was pregnant which I'm not. I started taking Ovcon-50 because i had breakthrough bleeding on Yaz after taking it for a year(I've been taking birth control pills for health reasons for years and yaz is the only pill that I've taken and haven't gained weight). When I drank excessive amounts of water and cranberry juice as diuretics it actually got worse. And bloating was not the only side effect. My doctor lowered my dosage to Ovcon-35 because he thinks it might be the dosage. I've been taking the lower dosage for about a week now and there has not been any change yet. If I don't see some improvement soon I'm calling my doctor again.,F,21,3  months,2/7/2009,Ovcon-50

24, 4, PCOS & birth control,bad headaches during off week. Moodiness during off week and the week before. more cramps during period.,I have been taking this a long time for polycystic ovary syndrome. It helped regulate my periods and make them lighter (they had been horribly heavy before) and cleared my acne. I also lost some weight. I have more cramps during my period due to the fact that now I'm actually ovulating monthly. I get headaches often and am extremely moody right before my periods_ but overall for PCOS I think this has been a good pill.,F,23,2  years,12/3/2008,Ovcon-50
25, 3, Heavy periods & large clots between,"Excessive tiredness_ horrible migraine headaches during the ""off week"" with VERY heavy clotting_ very thirsty...all the time_ decreased sex drive_ abnormal appetite.",I had a Mirina IUD for 3 years_ after 2 1/2 years I was given Femcon in addition to the IUD to try and control the bleeding.  After 6 months of being on Femcon_ I had the IUD removed and continued with the Femcon.  This did not stop the excessive bleeding/large clots between periods.  2 months ago I was put on Ovcon 50 as a last resort before an Endometrial Ablation that will lead to a hysterectomy.  I am young and only have 1 child_ but do not want more...yet.  My doctor suggests that I have a second child VERY soon then have the Endo-Ablation if this pill doesn't work.  This is only my 2nd month on the new BC_ but my periods are HORRIBLE!  The only good thing I can say is that I'm not bleeding in between_ but the week of my period is worse than ever!  I will try for a few more months to see if it works_ if not_ then I will have to make a decision as to whether I will continue with my problems_ have another child that our family isn't ready for yet or take the possiblity for another c,F,25,2  months,12/3/2008Email,Ovcon-50

I hated the Yasmin!!  I felt pregnant all over again - fatigue_ morning sickness_ breast tenderness_ etc.  My period was much heavier and lasted longer on the Yasmin so I switched back to the Ovcon.  I love this pill.  I have lite periods that usually only last 3-4 days.  My husband and I agree the lower sex drive associated with the Ovcon is better than feeling pregnant all over again while taking the Yasmin.  What good is a great sex drive if you're too fatigue and nauseas to have sex?  Ovcon 50 is great and I would highly recommend it to anybody.,F,28,4  years,3/19/2006,Ovcon-50
