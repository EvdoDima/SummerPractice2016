0, 5, Heavy bleeding,Cramping a few days after insertionExtreme pain during insertion (fainted),Despite the extreme pain with the insertion/removal/ and re-insertion of a new Mirena I am Completely satisfied with the results - it's great for birth control but I got it to control my heavy bleeding - it worked great the 1st five years and I recently had another one inserted.,F,49,5  years,8/3/2016,Mirena
1, 1, Heavy bleeding,	To my surprise_ the IUD has shifted my gender identity_ sexual orientation_ become a barrier in spiritual self realization (meditation) and has many physical side effects. I am not the first_ the only_ or the last who will experience these symptoms from an IUD. I did not reduce acne_ prevent migraines_ regulate my period or reduce cramping. SCAM ALERT! The doctors will tell you the procedure and birth control is free_ then take thousands of dollars (about $2_500) from your familys insurance. Ive spoken to other girls who have also had to fight for several (4) months for their familys money back. In addition_ for two months_ there was SEVERE_ constant_ unbearable pain and spotting. I lost fifteen pounds and some days I could barely get out of bed some days. I had many sleepless nights for eight months due to painful_ sharp cramping and pinching. I am not over exaggerating_ the pain was similar to breaking a leg. 	Before IUD placement_ I was a feminine lesbian.,It was a traumatic experience and easily the worst thing I have ever done to my body.,F,18,8  months 1X D,8/1/2016,Mirena
2, 1, Pregnancy Prevention/Heavy Periods,During the first year of having my mirena everything seemed fine. My heavy periods were nearly nonexistent and I no longer had breast tenderness or cramping prior to my periods. Around the 1.5 year mark my periods stopped. That's when things got weird. I started developing cystic acne. At any given time I would have 5-10 large cysts on my face that refused to go away. I went to a dermatologist who told me my mirena is causing a hormonal imbalance which is causing my cystic acne. I still did not want to have the mirena removed_ so he prescribed me to 3 different medicines. These helped. However_ during the time my fave started clearing up I started to become very anxious. I was constantly in fear of passing out because I always felt so off balance (to this day I still feel the same way). Then around the 2 year mark I lost all sex drive. I am in a happy_ committed relationship so this threw me for a loop. Today I've had the mirena in for a little over  2.5 years. I had it inserted in January of 2014. I am literally about to get in my car to drive to my OBGYN to have this demon exorcised from my body. I am excited and hopeful that these negative side effects go away after removal.,May be right for some women_ but apparently I am sensitive to hormones so this is not right for me. If you feel these symptoms do not let them persist as I have. I look back over the past year in disbelief of the symptoms I've endured. Stay strong ladies! I wish you the best.,F,24,2  years,7/27/2016Email,Mirena
3, 3, Birth control,Fatigue. Cramping.  Baby fluttering in my stomach. Weight gain..,,F,33,8  months,7/19/2016,Mirena
4, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Hair thinning_ slow growth_ painful cramps after sex_ ovarian cyst_ severe breast tenderness_ bloating_ weight gain_ depression_ anxiety_ suicidal thoughts.I had my first Mirena placed in 2008. I did notice my hair stopped growing_ painful cramps after sex_ extremely tender breasts 2 weeks out of the month_ but no weight gain_ just a bloated puffy stomach all of the time. Had a second one put in a couple months ago and I'm realizing because I've already gained 15 pounds_ that I neglected to see all of the other side effects I'd suffered from all along. I was always an extremely mellow person and I've been a basket case for years. I can pin point this beginning exactly a few weeks after my first IUD was placed. I have been more emotion_ depressed_ hazy_ lethargic_ almost catatonic at times. I'm not one to soak up people's experiences and project. It's not psychosematic. These side effects are real. It keeps your body in a physical and mentally vulnerable state of being_ mimicking pregnancy. I had mine removed recently_ but worry the other side effect is early menopause as I haven't had a period in years. I am a very in shape person and this thing wrecked my body. With all of the technology we have someone please come up with better birth control solution for woman.,,F,34,6  years,6/14/2016,Mirena
5, 1, Birth Contraception,Since I've had the Morena I've been extremely irritable and I'm having severe hot flashes and cold sweats. I've felt unlike myself. Every now and then I feel this feeling in my stomach that is similar to a baby kicking. I get severe cramps during sex at times as well.,I will be having this taken out asap! I DO NOT recommend this birth control at all.,F,18,1  years,6/1/2016,Mirena
6, 1, Contraception,As soon as i got the mirena my life became so crap so quick_ the sharp stabbing pains_ the best way to describe this is i felt like i had a tampon in like when you put ot in wrong_ they say u shouldnt feel it but i could feel it. I was moody_ anxious_ dizzy i felt on edge and i was only on this for 5 days!! I went to the doc and had it removed and guess what instant relief and she even confirmed it was still sitting in the right place . The pain is gone and my mood balanced again. I already have anxiety and the mirena intensified it.,I am so happy i didnt just hack out the side effects hoping it would go away one day. This drug is the devil,F,33,5  days,5/27/2016,Mirena
7, 1, Birth control,Bloating_ weight gain_ head hair loss_ but extra body hair growth nervousness_ depression_ loss of sex drive_ painful cramps,I have never had a kid_ my doctor recommended I use it for birth control since I'm bad at remembering to take the pill. Other than the painful stabbing cramps and the spotting all the time (I assumed it would go away after a few months) it was ok to start with. Then after a year and a half I noticed I started losing hair off my head (I had bald patches at 25!) but I was growing wayy extra hair on my legs_ stomach_ and hands. The cramps only got worse and I could actually feel it in me. I also gained about 45 pounds and couldn't lose it. Then I started feeling depressed all the time_ I wasn't myself and it started to affect my new marriage. Two months before I got it removed I started feeling nervous all the time and couldn't go into work or come home without having panic attacks. After trying to convince me to leave it in_ I finally made my doc remove it. It's been gone for two and a half months and ive already lost 17 pounds_ the hair on my head is growing back and I don't see any more unwanted body hair. No more panic attacks and I am much happier. My best friend also had all these symptoms until she got hers removed too. DONT GET MIRANA! ITS NOT WORTH IT! ITS WAY BETTER TO BE ON THE PILL!,F,26,2  years,5/24/2016,Mirena

9, 1, Pregnancy prevention.,Had cramping_ abnormal periods- real inconsistent. Felt like I was always bloated due to this insertion.

10, 1, Birth control,Hair loss_ joint pain_twitching eye_ hormonal_feeling pregnant. After removal: tired_ anxious_ not ovulating and no periods (was extremely fertile_ like clockwork before mirena).

13, 1, Heavy Bleeding,Spotting every day since insertion_ vaginal discharge_ light period bleeding for a month at a time (every other month) dry itchy rash on legs_ the last period I had heavy bleeding & painful cramps.,I am scheduled to have it removed in 2 days and it can't get here soon enough!,F,47,6  months 1X D,3/20/2016,Mirena
14, 1, Birth Control,I got Mirena 6 weeks after my second child was born in hopes for easy birth control. Insertion was painful_ but nothing a little Ibuprofen wouldn't handle. I bled very light for 6 weeks straight after insertion. Finally my period came regularly it was extremely light but lasted at least 3 days longer than normal (7+days). That was nothing compared to the pain the IUD caused me 24-7 pain_ my husband felt it every time we had sex_ even 9 months into having it he moved it causing extreme nausea_ dizziness_ back pain for 2 weeks until it moved back to place. Then add the severe PMS symptoms to the mixture_ I was miserable. Had it removed 17 months after insertion and would not recommend to anyone. The pain and side effects out weight the benefits.,Felt the IUD the whole time I had it for 17 months. The low dosage of hormones was not right for me and put my whole body out of wack for 2+ weeks straight each month.,F,29,17  months 1X D,3/13/2016,Mirena
15, 3, Contraception,In my last month's with the Mirena I am suffering with anus and vaginal itch on the skin it is so uncomfortable I can't stop scratching and it bleeds and splits open.... I have also gained weight and have bad sleeping habits... Is this another side effect? I am going out of my wits as the Mirena brought on early menopause or is this part of menopause side effects !!!!,,F,44,1  days30,3/2/2016Email,Mirena
16, 3, Heavy periods,First placement was flawless. I had cramping for the first month_ then no side effects and no period for five years.,The second placement_ I got pelvic inflammatory disease and spent five days in the hospital after having the Mirena removed two weeks after placement. The pain was intense. The fever caused hallucinations. The infection had to be evacuated by a needle inserted in my abdomen while in a CT scan. The cause of the infection was probably less than sterile conditions. The bacteria was E.Coli. I was never specifically told that 1 in 1_000 insertions end up in PID. The commercials on t.v. state it very clearly. I guess that since my first Mirena was fine_ I did not pay attention.,F,46,5  years 1X D,3/2/2016,Mirena
17, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Weight gain_ moodiness_ cramping_ massive hair loss_ anxiety_ depression,I had the mirena in for about 6 months and my sister told me I had a bald spot. That bad spot is now huge and I have 3 smaller ones. I have to wait the the hormones have run their course before it will stop fallingOut. It has decreased which is great but not stopped as of yet. It's been out for 5 months and yet still small shedding. It's crap and please do your reaserch before deciding to get one done. I'm almost bald on one whole side o my head!,F,31,7  months,3/1/2016Email,Mirena
18, 1, To prevent pregnancy,I'm on my second Mirena now. It was inserted in April of 2015. I had Mirena for 5 years prior to this one_ and it was great. Only side effect was no period at all_ which was great. However_ this one has been completely different. I have insomnia. I am cranky all the time_ and don't feel like myself. I get cramps for no reason. My sex drive has plummeted_ and I don't want to be touched at all. I have acne like a 16 year old. I have gained 25 pounds_ and no matter what I do_ I can't lose weight. Most of it is around my belly_ and I've never had that issue. I'm miserable. I'm getting it removed_ and I will never get another one.,Not worth it. It seems the product is very inconsistent. The side effects vary widely not only from person to person_ but are different in the same person each time they have to get the product re-inserted when it expires.,F,38,6  years,2/9/2016,Mirena
19, 1, birth control,Had third Mirena placed. Within two months_ experienced hair loss around temples that has continued for 6 months_ complexion changed (acne and then rosacea diagnosis)_ and breasts grew by half cup size despite no weight gain. Gynecologist and dermatologist confirmed this is due to the levonorgestrel released by the coil. For the first 10 years of having the Mirena (two separate ones as per the 5-year replacement guidelines)_ I didn't notice any drastic changes. I had the Mirena removed last week as I do not find these side effects acceptable.,,F,35,11  years 1X O,1/31/2016Email,Mirena

21, 2, Birth Control,I thought my increasing cramps and boating were due to IBS but now think it's the Coil_ dull and spotty skin on face_ neck and shoulders. Anxiety_ thinning hair resulting in bald spot at front temple_ increase in hair growth on face and chin_ very short temper_ almost rage like outbursts otherwise overall feeling of nothingness..,Helped with heavy periods but found I was having brown discharge 3 weeks out of 4 and more unpredictable_ gave it 12 months but I paid my dues in terms of bad skin in my youth_ not something I want to be doing in my 40's_ I suffer with a skin picking disorder related to anxiety so it was a recipe for disaster really as both have been worse whilst I had this..my hair is curly so hardly use shampoo_ never brush or comb my hair and even with that gentle treatment it was noticeably thinning. Couple of days ago had enough_couldn't get doctors appointment for weeks and didn't want to fight to get it removed_ looked it up online and removed it myself...even in 48 hrs a proper period appears to have started_ I'm more mellow with the kids and husband_ also my skin seems brighter_ akin to the bloom you get during pregnancy...sounds daft but feels like my body spent 12 months trying to tell me there was something foreign that it wanted out.,F,41,1  years 1X D,12/30/2015,Mirena

Over the last few months_ my periods have been dark brown/black_ mostly like dried blood. According to my husband_ I've been moody_ hateful & crabby for the last several years. I never contributed it to the Mirena_ just the peri-menopausal issue.

32, 3, Birth control,For the first 10 years (2 devices) I was relatively problem free. My periods stopped within 2 months of first insertion and I had smooth sailing. Then I started having regular periods again about 4 months before the 2nd device was due to be removed. I had a failed insertion with the 3rd device_ I was advised to wait 3-4 weeks to try again. After that time passed I had another inserted and an ultrasound a month later confirmed it was placed correctly. However I now feel a shot of deep pelvic pain when I sit a certain way_ and sometimes I get horrendous cramps after sex (never had that before). I am 3 months into this 3rd device and I have gained weight_ my face is covered in acne_ I can't sleep well_ I'm tired and lethargic_ moody_ and very irritable.,"I don't understand how I could have been 100% symptom free for 10 years_ and now be so miserable on this 3rd device.

Panic/anxiety started making me agrophobic 12 months ago_ very out of character for me.

However_ having BAD nausea - to point where needed anti nausea meds - at long last my GP admitted that Mirena could have caused all my problems amd removal causes early pregnancy symptoms in some women!

53, 1, Pregnancy Prevention,From the inception I've had severe cramps- mainly in my back and legs. Ridiculous mood swings which I've never experienced before- so bad my husband and oldest daughter became frightened. Depressed- even to get out of bed is a chore. Daily tasks are overwhelming. Anxious all the time. Panic attacks. I've never had any of these things before. Simple daily life is nerve wrecking.,Asked my Dr multiple times to remove but was encouraged to 'get past' the initial humps. Having it removed after waiting for some relief. Had to demand the removal. I would NEVER recommend an IUD. I never had problems with oral contraceptives.,F,35,9  months,8/29/2015Email,Mirena

All of these were gone in less the 24hrs_ -4kg in 5 days after insertion. Improved the mood_ restored self-esteem_ the weight loss is progressing further since then. Only occasional spotting_ some cramps but no bleeding (never bled during depo years)_ random pelvic pain. Satisfied overall. saved me from completely loosing it on Depo..,The unusual pelvic pain is being investigated_ but U.S. found the coil in perfect place_ so it is not the obvious cause. Might be underlying condition enhanced by the change of local hormonal changes. I see how some of you suffer on this_ that is how i was on depo. For me this is light and flawless. I suppose we have differene tolerance levels_ and therefore we react differently to different BCs. If any of you suffer on Mirena_ avoid Depo from afar. ,F,34,2  monthsStandars,8/15/2015Email,Mirena

59, 1, Birth control,Currently recovering from the emergency c section I had to have in order for it to be removed. We were planning on starting for baby number 2 but when my doctor went to remove it in her office_ she couldn't. A scheduled hysteroscopy the following week didn't work_ which turned into a failed laproscopy which then went to a c section. This has derailed my family for this time. I'm unable to care for my daughter. My husband is taking on both roles and working. I'm in pain all the time. It has caused havoc for us. I also experienced every negative side effect while having it so the removal was for more than just wanting to get pregnant so now! Instead of expanding our family I'm recovering and what makes me even more angry is that my second pregnancy will HAVE to be a c section due to the perforations in my uterus. Do NOT get the Mirena IUD. If you have it? Get it out! It's not worth the risk. At any time that thing can start moving around your body.

I have been keeping a journal since December and it always seems to be the following week that I get so bad I cannot even get up sometimes. My heart races I get hot cold sweats and vision is almost like a blurred tunnel vision. I was prescribed 0.25 of Xanax to help with the anxiety. My original prescription was for about 30 pills that I got back in Nov. 2014 and I probably still have over half left just to give you an idea of how often I take them. I too have been to the ER and even a Neurologist to see if I was having seizures next was going to be a sleep depervation test??

I got a small sore on my inner thigh (almost looked like a boil or a pimple forming) I just assumed I had an infected hair from shaving the day before with a slightly used razor. By day 9 I was completely broke out in huge and painful sores_ to the point I went and got another std test thinking it was something really bad. The metallic smell also transformed into something I cannot even truly explain. Almost like rotting road kill. Everyone around me could smell it. I had zero sex drive while it wAs in_ who would want to have sex with sores and smells anyway.I finally got fed up after going to the hospital. I had no yeast infections_ no bacteria infection_ no stds. The hospital refused to help. I decided I wasn't crazy and I came home and removed it myself.Instantly the smell was gone_ the iud itself smelled terrible as it came out. It's been gone 3 days_ all of my sores are gone.

64, 1, Not to get pregnant,I would say until yesterday when I read something about Mirena on Facebook I have never associated my symptoms to Mirena_ but I have gone from one doctor to another with all the symptoms described here as side effects by most women; my worst one is panic attacks_ fatigue _ hair loss_ hopelessness and being just over anxious_ ovarian cysts. I read the side effects and noticed that I have almost every single one of them called the doctors office and I am having it removed on Monday. I am not sure how long it will take for my life to go back to normal but I am sure I will not recommend this to anyone since my life has been very hard the last couple of years with it_ if I had know earlier thAt Mirena was causing all my problems I would have had it taken Out long time ago. The problem was not one single doctor ever said anything about it_ with all the symptoms and all the tests coming back negative .

I didn't bleed and heavy as I always do_ but what normally only lasts for 4 days_ lasted 11. The period symptoms were near horrific_ but I have always gotten really bad cramps. Lately I've been having a lot of cravings so basically what it feels like is I'm having period symptoms_ with no period. Since my period ending_ I have spotted twice and not enough to wear a pad_ just a small panty liner_ and even then_ the blood will not touch the liner. My mood has changed a bit_ lately I've been angrier than usual and really annoyed_ but I was on the shot(depo)_ and also NuvaRing when I was younger_ and nothing could ever come close to how horrible those made me feel. I plan on sticking with Mirena because all of these symptoms were expected_ the thing I'm happiest about is it is an affective Birthcontrol that I don't have to worry about remembering for a while.

I spotted for about 3 weeks; at first really heavy and then just spotting randomly. I noticed that after one month it was painful to sit and i was just uncomfortable. People kept saying i shouldnt feel anything.  I noticed i was more bloated and had anxiety. I would be doing something and just get all nervous and loose my train of thought. Definitely not like me. I went in to have it checked and it was almost falling out_ so my doctor took it out and said that some women just arent the right candidates.,. While breastfeeding with my daughter i did not have any period and the same with my son. However i wanted to make sure we were careful so i figured the Mirena would work.

It started coming out strands at a time all day.long.  I related the hair loss to all the possible let med changes or getting older or vitamin deficiency.

I have tried every pill out there and every time I would have the worst PMS ever so after our second son my Dr convinced me to try Mirena again because she had never seen anyone have the problems I did_ so I gave it a try. We are going on 3 years now and I've been debating on removing it for the past couple of months_ I didn't realize all my issues were related to this damn thing. So I researched like crazy because I was the lowest I had ever been in my whole life. Turns out I have every side effect they warn you about_ headaches_ acne_ weight gain_ depression_ and the worst one ovarian cysts (super painful)....

A few months after having it I suffered from very bad acne but had no idea it was the mirena. All my doctors told me it was just adult acne. I did have it removed about 3 years later so that I could get pregnant. It took me over a year to get pregnant with my second son. After he was born 6 weeks later I had the second one placed because ultimately the first one wasn't as bad as I thought besides the acne that I had no idea was being caused by the mirena. Well needless to say the second one was placed I had for about 6 months. I never really stopped bleeding_ either I had my period or I was spotting_ my acne was worse then ever causing horrible scaring and craters_ I would cry at the drop of a dime and was severely depressed to the point I almost started lexapro for depression bc I knew this wasn't me_ I was always a happy go lucky girl that loves life! And nothing in my life changed but the mirena. I did my massive research on it and found out thousands of women were experiencing all the same symptoms.

Periods became nearly non-existent. Many of the other side effects I never correlated to Mirena until I had it removed 3 months ago and started to see changes almost immediately. My sex drive was down to zero_ but is up significantly. My mood went from being happy_ care free and fun loving to being cynical_ depressed and angry. I am worrying less and happier overall now.

My doctor told me the insertion would feel like a pinch but that wasnt the truth. It was VERY painful. I was on the pill for 4 years prior to getting it. I never had any of these problems. My doctor assured me that it wasn't the mirena but after doing research that was another lie. I've always been a happy fun person but with this I am very mean_irritable_ and Moody. I've lost a little over 40 pounds without any exercise or dieting. When I try to eat I get naseaus and it just doesn't taste good. I am constantly tired and have no energy and sometimes I just want to stay in bed. I never got yeast infections until I got mirena. Every woman's body is different but I am getting this removed.

I only have breast tenderness when my period comes it is almost like my body is warning me haha and the anxiety is me thinking my mirena slipped out or moved around somewhere and that im pregnant BUT thats never the case. My doc hates that i come in for my monthly check to make sure my mirena is there then tells me to stay off the internet haha but i wanted to share this with you ladies.

I spotted sometimes but really have no period.  I noticed changes in my body but didn't even consider it being the Mirena until I read some of the comments and noticed I had the same things. The thing that bothered me the most was the discharge and odor_ I didn't realize how impacting it was until someone said something to me. The weight gain and headaches have also been a big problem for me_ I've seen tons of doctors and they never could figure out why it happening. I am going to have it removed next week and hope things will start getting better.,F,35,5  years 1X D,5/22/2015,Mirena

I will note that I have no allergies to medication of any kind and had a care provider I trusted to place the implant properly_ which likely led to my problem-free experience. I would (and have) recommend Mirena as a great_ long-term option for birth control (but don't panic if it doesn't work for you...I had tried the pill first and had terrible side effects_ so an IUD was actually my second choice).,,29,3  years,5/12/2015,Mirena

I am constantly fatigued so this has affected my fitness regime & studies greatly. My relationship has been effected negatively as it instantly depleted my sex drive and the fact that I haven't stopped bleeding doesn't help matter either. I have booked in to get it removed next week. I wouldn't recommend anyone taking the risk of such an expensive IUD before being fully aware of the negative effect it has for many.

So far I love it! Super light spotting on and off but nothing I even need a panty liner for. I would recommend this to anyone that wants long term birth control without the hassle.

I did not have a terrible experience at all. It was more of a slight discomfort that I was able to breathe  through and it was over. I would suggest taking your time getting up when it's over. I became briefly dizzy_ hot_ thirsty and on the verge of fainting. I sat down and had some water within 5 minutes I was fine and drove myself home. I rested and felt fine. I spotted the end of a period brown blood for the day. I wore a panty line for 3-4 days with only small amount of brown discharge. By days 5-6 I had clear discharge with a tinge of brown. I had sex on day six_ I was very nervous_ wondering if it would be painful and would he feel it. No pain_ and he couldn't feel it. So i'm a week out and have not had any horrible experiences.

My periods were always heavy with very painful cramps and PMS bloating...you name it.  I am a single divorced mother and was in a monogamous relationship at the time i decided to get one.

Yes_ i've had a few ovarian cysts that have been manageable and i keep them on check.  my acne is manageable and a small price to pay for peace and tranquility of not having to deal with periods.  Along with that it's a great contraceptive methods and i do not spend on pads_ pain medications.  Just the sheer joy of not even going to the feminine products aisle is awesome.  My hormones are at good levels since i get them checked.  I recommended to my friends.  In fact_ I am not looking forward to the two months I am off it when get the current one exchanged.

I bled on and off for about 6 months before it finally evened out. At that point_ I didn't have too bad of periods for awhile. I was already overweight at the time_ so I may not have noticed my weight gain_ etc. Although I'm sure it didn't help! I had a lot of the smaller side effects for the most part throughout that time. During those years is when I found out about my nabothian cysts as well during an exam_ which I found out they are a normal occurence in women who have had children. I also read that Mirena could make it worse_ but I am not sure if that is confirmed or not. In Oct 2013_ I had my 2nd Mirena inserted_ which was SO painful. I did it at Planned Parenthood. It hurt so much_ my blood pressure dropped and I had to lay there for like 20 minutes. It was a pretty awful experience. I had pain for several days after. After this IUD_ I had a thick yellowish_ semi-odd smelling discharge for days on end_ almost non-stop for several months_ almost until now. It's annoying wearing panty liners every day! It slowed down the last month or two. But before then it was annoying. I was tested for bacterial infections_ STD's_ etc_ and I always ended up being clean_ so it has to be the hormones or something with the Mirena itself.

During one of these attacks_ i lost feeling on the left side of my face_ neck_ throat and arm.  I ended up in the ER.  To make a really long story short_ I was in and out of the ER and inpatient at the hospital for months.  I lost out on the first 2 months of my babys life as I hardly remember anything. The doctors talked brain surgery to remove excess spinal fluid that was building around my brain.  In the end_ i was diagnosed as having a TIA ( mini STROKE) as well as all of the other issues and medical procedures that my family and I were put through. The Mirena caused the mini stroke and now I am left with suffering severe migraines that I am seizure meds for.

I can't stand having hot flashes so I will be switching my birth control when it is due_ at the end of next month.  What I do like about this is the convenience of it_ you only have to have it inserted once and you are good to go for 5 years.

The insertion is painful_ but if you have had a child vaginally_ it is very little pain compared to child birth. I had bleeding after insertion_ thankfully no infection!_ and it was painful for a while during sex. However_ the doctor did tell me to refrain from sex for about 2-3 weeks to help close the cervix again and heal a little. Also_ what persisted the following months were sharp stabbing sensations after having an orgasm. This has gone away and I have enjoyed my mirena after those initial 2-3 months. I have had slightly increased acne on my face_ but it could be due to a more stressful lifestyle right now.

199, 1, contraceptive,CONSTANT menstruation,I suppose I was the unlucky one when I see all the women whose periods stopped completely with this medication. Shortly after placement_ my periods increased in duration (10 days beginning to end... then 2 weeks... then 3 weeks..) then I experienced daily bleeding for the last 6 months. The aggravation (and cost_ if you know what I mean) of daily menstruation drove me nuts. Don't know why it took my doctor so long to recommend taking it out. It's been out for 2 months now and my cycles are back to normal. It was sooooo NOT worth the convenience.,,41,2  years 1X D,7/14/2011Email,Mirena
200, 5, birth control,When I had my first Mirena inserted 5+ yrs ago_ I had a nonstop period for 90 days then...magic...no period for the remaining 4 yrs_ 9 mths.  Just had it replaced for another 5 yrs and only had light spotting.,Love it!  Since I've never had kids_ the initial insertion was extremely uncomfortable because I had to be dilated. It was worth the cramping and pain for 10 minutes while the MD inserted several rods into my cervix to make it open.  When I had the second Mirena inserted_ no dilation was needed so it was a quick but still uncomfortable procedure. Again_ I'll endure 10 minutes of discomfort for 5 yrs of birth control!,F,40,5  years 1X D,7/8/2011Email,Mirena
201, 1, Birth control,Weight gain_ acne_ severe cramping,i liked that my periods were so light_ but I have never had such frequent and horrible cramping...It would drop me to my knees.  Also_ I gained 30 pounds in six months_ even though my eating/exercise habits didn't change.  I went through tons of testing to figure out what was wrong_ and then I thought maybe it's Mirena. After some research_ I realize that I'm not alone in my symptoms_ and I'm having it removed ASAP. I just need to find another form of birth control.,F,30,6  months 1X D,7/5/2011,Mirena

203, 3, Birth Control,Extreame Irritablility_ Mood Swings (super mad followed by super sad)_ Irregular Periods (never know if PMS or crazy because of IUD)_ Absent Mindedness,"After taking ortho tri cyclin lo for the past 10 years_ i decided i didn't like the risk of heart attack and figured 10 years was too long to take a hormone like that and decided to get the Mirena. The first time my doctor tried to insert the IUD on my regular visit and the contraption was defective and wasn't opening properly...found this out by trying to force it in.  OUCH!!! Realized during this visit that I have cervical stenosis (cervix wont dialate) so she scheduled me to be under anethesia for the 2nd attempt.  Thank god because she said even under anethesia a tensed up and outstreatched my legs upon insertion.  First 3 months were constant cramping and spotting.  Painful sex so didn't even try.  Finally stopped being sore but periods are very irregular_ sometimes will have two back-to-back and then skip a month.  The worst side effects by far are the raging mood swings.  My poor boyfriend.  It takes alot of patience to deal with me when i am so irrationally enraged about the most insignificant things. Also_ went and saw the movie ""bridesmaids"" (a comedy) and cryed through the whole thing!  I am giving this another 6 months to a year because even though i have read that there are similar experiences and that people have them removed...no one comes back on and says how they feel 6 months to a year later.  I am hoping my body evens out. Probably wouldn't do it again but i have no kids and don't want a permanent birthcontrol yet.",F,28,1.5  years 1X D,6/21/2011Email,Mirena
204, 1, birth control,daily bleeding_ terrible  cramps_ hair loss_ perforated uterus requiring surgery,"This birth control is a TERRIBLE choice. I had really painful cramps for weeks after my mirena was put in. I bled every day for nearly 10 months. When I went to have my mirena removed_ I was told it had perforated my uterus and I needed  to have it surgically removed from my abdomen. This was apparently a ""very uncommon side effect"" until the doctor discovered I needed surgery and then apparently ""oh this happens all the time."" Also_ I lost nearly all of my hair. I wear hats every day now.  DO NOT PUT MIRENA IN YOUR BODY!",F,22,10  months 1X D,6/21/2011Email,Mirena
205, 1, Contraceptive,Spotting_ Loss of libido_ painful sex_ UTI's and Bacterial infections.,I have had Mirena twice. The first I had removed after 6 months of painful sex. I had it put in 2 months after having my first child. I decided to give it another chance 6 months AFTER my 2nd child. It was okay for a while as long as I wasn't having sex while laying on my back. My husband and I figured it was just a change in my body after having a 2nd child and possible Cysts. I decided recently that I should have it checked and sure enough the strings were barely visible and it was misplaced and on my cervix. I had it removed. Never again. I am going to stick with Nuvaring.,F,34,5  years 1X O,6/15/2011,Mirena
206, 1, Birth Control,Complete loss of libido,After getting the implant_ my libido slowly but surely diminshed to nothing. I didn't want my boyfriend touching me_ kissing me. i would rather watch paint dry than have sex. And before mirena_ my libido was through the roof!!! It was awful. I didn't even fell human anymore. I had really bad headaches too. I have always suffered with headaches and migraines_ but they were way more frequent with the mirena in. I had it taken out a little over two weeks ago and now I am back to my old self. I love kissing_ cuddling and having sex again. Thank God I figured out the problem because my boyfriend and I almost broke up over this.,F,32,2  years1 1X O,6/8/2011Email,Mirena

208, 2, birth control,weight gain_ spotting_ cramping_ bleeding,I had heard wonderful things from a friend who had the same IUD_ so after my first child_ I had one put in.  For the first 6 months_ I had almost constant spotting.  After that_ I began to get more normal periods_ but had HORRIBLE cramping on the first day- much worse than before I had my child.  I have also had a steady gain of 20 lbs since I got my mirena.  I am trying to stick it out for a little while longer since we're not ready for another baby_ and I cannot use oral birth control_ but I don't know how much longer I can stand it.,F,29,1  years 1X O,4/9/2011,Mirena
209, 4, birth control,Strange vaginal odor,I love my mirena. I have noticed a strange vaginal odor since having it put in but I can deal with it. Its a small price to pay I guess. Period stopped after 2 months. It has been pretty great overall,F,29,1  years 1X D,4/6/2011Email,Mirena

211, 1, Birth Control,Constant heavy daily bleeding_ fatigue_ abdominal pain_ urinary tract infection_ and 15 lbs weight gain.,I was told that I may have breakthrough bleeding however I had severe heavy bleeding with abdominal pain and bloating. My obgyn had me come in after 30 days for an ultrasound to check placement and at that point I developed a UTI and requested the Mirena to be removed. Definitely not a positive experience_ this is not for everyone for sure not for me. Appreciated taking a daily pill after that experience. Its been a year and my body is still not right. Buyer beware.,F,30,30  days 1X D,3/30/2011,Mirena

I had never had never had a migrane_ and had 2 while on this_ also constant back pain_ some cycles were heavy and for 2 wks and others never came_ with Months inbetween.

213, 4, endometriosis,chronic yeast and cervical infections_ severe back pain_ weight loss.,Had mirena inserted at 18. no kids still a virgin. NEVER had a period from day 1 of insertion but yeast infections were horrible which im still batteling after 1 year. found out the doctor put it too low where it was in my cervix rather than uterus which causes all my issues. im now 19 and had it reinserted higher up 2 days ago. so far so good and no issues except cramping. keeping this one in for 5 years regardless.,F,19,3  months 1X O,2/26/2011,Mirena

The last 2 years were pure hell trying to figure out ""what's wrong with me?"".  I never thought Mirena would cause so many ailments in fact I rarely remembered it was in my body.  Having it inserted was a little painful but having it removed ranked up there with labor pains.  My suggestion try a birth control that can easily be removed or stopped because it was very difficult to find a doctor willing to take it out.",F,32,4.5  years 1X D,2/23/2011,Mirena
215, 3, Birth Control,Insertion was painful and I had heavy cramping and bleeding for about 1 week. Then I went back to normal periods that faded away to nothing after about a year. My husband complained about being poked every once in a while but we decided it was worth the convenience. About 18 months I began cycles of feeling very bloated and tender in my lower abdomen. No periods though. I started gaining weight and am still gaining (up 15 pounds) despite heavy exercise and dieting.,I've also had several bladder and vaginal infections in the last year. I've never experienced this type of frequency before (and yes_ I'm very careful with my hygiene). I'm suspecting it's all related so I'm having the device removed to see if there's any improvement and a return to my normal weight. At this point_ I'm giving Mirena a 3 since it really is effective and at first has minimal side effects. If I find out these later side effects are related to the Mirena_ I will score this drug lower.,F,36,27  months20 mcg 1X D,2/22/2011Email,Mirena
216, 1, birth control,hair loss_ breakthrough bleeding_ weight gain_ irritability_ fatigue_ lower back pain_ joint pain_ headaches,I decided on Mirena for birth control after my 2nd child was born.  I noticed greater-than-usual hair loss for about 3 months after having it inserted.  After that_ my periods stopped completely for 9 months_ which was wonderful!  I was rushed to the ER for heart palpitations (which I'd never had) and low blood pressure.  After having Mirena for nearly 11 months_ I suddenly got a period and it went downhill from there.  I gained 8 pounds in 2 months (mostly noticable in the stomach)_ experienced extreme fatigue and lower back pain_ very bad mood swings with general irritability.  By the 12th month I had Mirena_ I was experiencing severe joint pain that OTC pain relievers weren't helping at all.  The pain was too much to live with_ so I had the Mirena removed.  I've felt like a different person since!,F,30,13  months 1X O,2/9/2011Email,Mirena
217, 5, Heavy bleeding,Lower back pain_ cramping after insertion.,I decided on Mirena due to extremely heavy bleeding with my period.  Insertion was fine_ a little uncomfortable but not like some describe_ I went to work as a nurse after insertion!  At first I bled all the time.  After 6 months I was still bleeding and ready to get it taken out.  But the bleeding finally began to lighten up and after a year_ it has stopped.  Now when a period is due_ I get some lower back pain_ spotting_ enough for a liner for a day and that's it.  Wonderful...,F,40,15  months 1X D,1/8/2011,Mirena
218, 3, Birth control,Horrible acne_ breast tenderness_ reduction of breast size_ blond facial hair. Pelvic pain for first 2 months after insertion.,I am 50/50 with Mirena. I have been on most birth control methods (different pills & shot)_ including Yaz_ in which I had the worst mood swings_ depression imaginable. In that sense_ Mirena is a godsent because I am normal now as far as mood swings. However_ the body changes from Mirena are a bit difficult to manage. The horrible acne_ the breast size reduction_ and now facial hair. Great. BUT_ I never have periods (occasional spotting every 1-2 months)_ and never have to think about birth control. I'm thinking Mirena would be great when combined with a hormonal addition_ like Aldactone which would control the hormonal acne and facial hair. Now if I could just get a prescription for that...,F,24,8  months 1X O,8/23/2010,Mirena
219, 5, Excessive menstrual bleeding,NONE!!,I had some spotting almost daily during the first few months but no regular period.  The spotting began tapering down after about 3 months_ and after about 4 months I stopped having periods/spotting altogether which I'm totally loving!  No side effects either.  I did have some pain during the procedure_ which is to be expected_ but with ibuprofen it went away quickly.,F,40,1.5  years 1X O,7/23/2010Email,Mirena
220, 4, Birth Control,Headaches_ nausea in 1st 3 months_ spotting btwn periods.,Of all the birth control I've tried over the years_ this is probably to best one when it comes to side effects. My biggest complaint is headaches. They are manageable but frequent. The first few months were the toughest getting used to it but it got better. I had nausea the first 3 months and then went away completely. Lighter periods until just recently I've had bleeding in between periods which never occurred the first 3 yrs. Normal pre-mentrual cramps. Doesn't help with acne. But the good things are my libido is great!!! No weight gain. No mood swings. Don't have to worry about forgetting to take a pill. I feel normal and active_ I just wish I had less headaches and fewer periods.,F,35,3.5  years 1X D,6/20/2010,Mirena
221, 1, Birth control_ Manage heavy periods,Headaches_ extreme irritability_ weight gain_ memory loss_ heavy periods_ severe break-through bleeding between periods.,I was put on Mirena as a way to help me manage my very heavy periods_ as well as act as a form of BC since I had just had my second child.  The medication seemed to help somewhat in the first couple of months_ regulating my period and decreasing the flow.  After the first 3 months_ things got much worse and seemed to go downhill. My weight increased_ I experienced headaches_ extreme irritability_ increased memory loss_ trouble sleeping and my periods were coming every 2 weeks.  I am ashamed to say that I toughed it out for 2 years before having it removed.  I was very unhappy and depressed and should have linked all of my symptoms to the Mirena_ but did not do so until I performed some detailed research on the internet and discovered others suffering from the same side effects.  I had it removed in March 2010 and feel much better as a result. Of course_ I still have not been successful in finding an alternative form of BC that helps my periods_ but I am glad to have finally made the right decision about the Mirena.,F,42,2.5  years 1X D,6/17/2010,Mirena

223, 3, Birth Control,mood swings_ weight gain_ headaches_ cramps_ ovarian cysts,I have had Mirena for 2 years. After 6 months_ I stopped having periods which was awesome. After 3 months_ I started having bad cravings and hunger problems. I am always hungry. It's ridiculous. I used to have a small appetite. I would eat half of my food and my boyfriend would eat the rest for me. Now_ I eat ALL of my food and snack in between becauseI'm constantly hungry. I have bad mood swings. I have never really been sensitive or emotional_ but since I got the Mirena_ I cry at the drop of a dime. I cried through half of Marley & Me and then cried for 30 minutes after it was over. I'm constantly getting upset about everything. I NEVER EVER had cramps of any kind and since I got the IUD I have cramps all of the time. Nothing helps them either. I have also had a couple of ovarian cysts as well. One of them bursted. The worst pain I have ever felt in my life,F,20,2  years 1X O,4/28/2010,Mirena
