0, 5, Heavy bleeding,Cramping a few days after insertionExtreme pain during insertion (fainted),Despite the extreme pain with the insertion/removal/ and re-insertion of a new Mirena I am Completely satisfied with the results - it's great for birth control but I got it to control my heavy bleeding - it worked great the 1st five years and I recently had another one inserted.,F,49,5  years,8/3/2016,Mirena
1, 1, Heavy bleeding,	To my surprise_ the IUD has shifted my gender identity_ sexual orientation_ become a barrier in spiritual self realization (meditation) and has many physical side effects. I am not the first_ the only_ or the last who will experience these symptoms from an IUD. I did not reduce acne_ prevent migraines_ regulate my period or reduce cramping. SCAM ALERT! The doctors will tell you the procedure and birth control is free_ then take thousands of dollars (about $2_500) from your family?s insurance. I?ve spoken to other girls who have also had to fight for several (4) months for their family?s money back. In addition_ for two months_ there was SEVERE_ constant_ unbearable pain and spotting. I lost fifteen pounds and some days I could barely get out of bed some days. I had many sleepless nights for eight months due to painful_ sharp cramping and pinching. I am not over exaggerating_ the pain was similar to breaking a leg. 	Before IUD placement_ I was a feminine lesbian.,It was a traumatic experience and easily the worst thing I have ever done to my body.,F,18,8  months 1X D,8/1/2016,Mirena
2, 1, Pregnancy Prevention/Heavy Periods,During the first year of having my mirena everything seemed fine. My heavy periods were nearly nonexistent and I no longer had breast tenderness or cramping prior to my periods. Around the 1.5 year mark my periods stopped. That's when things got weird. I started developing cystic acne. At any given time I would have 5-10 large cysts on my face that refused to go away. I went to a dermatologist who told me my mirena is causing a hormonal imbalance which is causing my cystic acne. I still did not want to have the mirena removed_ so he prescribed me to 3 different medicines. These helped. However_ during the time my fave started clearing up I started to become very anxious. I was constantly in fear of passing out because I always felt so off balance (to this day I still feel the same way). Then around the 2 year mark I lost all sex drive. I am in a happy_ committed relationship so this threw me for a loop. Today I've had the mirena in for a little over  2.5 years. I had it inserted in January of 2014. I am literally about to get in my car to drive to my OBGYN to have this demon exorcised from my body. I am excited and hopeful that these negative side effects go away after removal.,May be right for some women_ but apparently I am sensitive to hormones so this is not right for me. If you feel these symptoms do not let them persist as I have. I look back over the past year in disbelief of the symptoms I've endured. Stay strong ladies! I wish you the best.,F,24,2  years,7/27/2016Email,Mirena
3, 3, Birth control,Fatigue. Cramping.  Baby fluttering in my stomach. Weight gain..,,F,33,8  months,7/19/2016,Mirena
4, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Hair thinning_ slow growth_ painful cramps after sex_ ovarian cyst_ severe breast tenderness_ bloating_ weight gain_ depression_ anxiety_ suicidal thoughts.I had my first Mirena placed in 2008. I did notice my hair stopped growing_ painful cramps after sex_ extremely tender breasts 2 weeks out of the month_ but no weight gain_ just a bloated puffy stomach all of the time. Had a second one put in a couple months ago and I'm realizing because I've already gained 15 pounds_ that I neglected to see all of the other side effects I'd suffered from all along. I was always an extremely mellow person and I've been a basket case for years. I can pin point this beginning exactly a few weeks after my first IUD was placed. I have been more emotion_ depressed_ hazy_ lethargic_ almost catatonic at times. I'm not one to soak up people's experiences and project. It's not psychosematic. These side effects are real. It keeps your body in a physical and mentally vulnerable state of being_ mimicking pregnancy. I had mine removed recently_ but worry the other side effect is early menopause as I haven't had a period in years. I am a very in shape person and this thing wrecked my body. With all of the technology we have someone please come up with better birth control solution for woman.,,F,34,6  years,6/14/2016,Mirena
5, 1, Birth Contraception,Since I've had the Morena I've been extremely irritable and I'm having severe hot flashes and cold sweats. I've felt unlike myself. Every now and then I feel this feeling in my stomach that is similar to a baby kicking. I get severe cramps during sex at times as well.,I will be having this taken out asap! I DO NOT recommend this birth control at all.,F,18,1  years,6/1/2016,Mirena
6, 1, Contraception,As soon as i got the mirena my life became so crap so quick_ the sharp stabbing pains_ the best way to describe this is i felt like i had a tampon in like when you put ot in wrong_ they say u shouldnt feel it but i could feel it. I was moody_ anxious_ dizzy i felt on edge and i was only on this for 5 days!! I went to the doc and had it removed and guess what instant relief and she even confirmed it was still sitting in the right place . The pain is gone and my mood balanced again. I already have anxiety and the mirena intensified it.,I am so happy i didnt just hack out the side effects hoping it would go away one day. This drug is the devil,F,33,5  days,5/27/2016,Mirena
7, 1, Birth control,Bloating_ weight gain_ head hair loss_ but extra body hair growth nervousness_ depression_ loss of sex drive_ painful cramps,I have never had a kid_ my doctor recommended I use it for birth control since I'm bad at remembering to take the pill. Other than the painful stabbing cramps and the spotting all the time (I assumed it would go away after a few months) it was ok to start with. Then after a year and a half I noticed I started losing hair off my head (I had bald patches at 25!) but I was growing wayy extra hair on my legs_ stomach_ and hands. The cramps only got worse and I could actually feel it in me. I also gained about 45 pounds and couldn't lose it. Then I started feeling depressed all the time_ I wasn't myself and it started to affect my new marriage. Two months before I got it removed I started feeling nervous all the time and couldn't go into work or come home without having panic attacks. After trying to convince me to leave it in_ I finally made my doc remove it. It's been gone for two and a half months and ive already lost 17 pounds_ the hair on my head is growing back and I don't see any more unwanted body hair. No more panic attacks and I am much happier. My best friend also had all these symptoms until she got hers removed too. DONT GET MIRANA! ITS NOT WORTH IT! ITS WAY BETTER TO BE ON THE PILL!,F,26,2  years,5/24/2016,Mirena

9, 1, Pregnancy prevention.,Had cramping_ abnormal periods- real inconsistent. Felt like I was always bloated due to this insertion.

13, 1, Heavy Bleeding,Spotting every day since insertion_ vaginal discharge_ light period bleeding for a month at a time (every other month) dry itchy rash on legs_ the last period I had heavy bleeding & painful cramps.,I am scheduled to have it removed in 2 days and it can't get here soon enough!,F,47,6  months 1X D,3/20/2016,Mirena
14, 1, Birth Control,I got Mirena 6 weeks after my second child was born in hopes for easy birth control. Insertion was painful_ but nothing a little Ibuprofen wouldn't handle. I bled very light for 6 weeks straight after insertion. Finally my period came regularly it was extremely light but lasted at least 3 days longer than normal (7+days). That was nothing compared to the pain the IUD caused me 24-7 pain_ my husband felt it every time we had sex_ even 9 months into having it he moved it causing extreme nausea_ dizziness_ back pain for 2 weeks until it moved back to place. Then add the severe PMS symptoms to the mixture_ I was miserable. Had it removed 17 months after insertion and would not recommend to anyone. The pain and side effects out weight the benefits.,Felt the IUD the whole time I had it for 17 months. The low dosage of hormones was not right for me and put my whole body out of wack for 2+ weeks straight each month.,F,29,17  months 1X D,3/13/2016,Mirena
15, 3, Contraception,In my last month's with the Mirena I am suffering with anus and vaginal itch on the skin it is so uncomfortable I can't stop scratching and it bleeds and splits open.... I have also gained weight and have bad sleeping habits... Is this another side effect? I am going out of my wits as the Mirena brought on early menopause or is this part of menopause side effects !!!!,,F,44,1  days30,3/2/2016Email,Mirena
16, 3, Heavy periods,First placement was flawless. I had cramping for the first month_ then no side effects and no period for five years.,The second placement_ I got pelvic inflammatory disease and spent five days in the hospital after having the Mirena removed two weeks after placement. The pain was intense. The fever caused hallucinations. The infection had to be evacuated by a needle inserted in my abdomen while in a CT scan. The cause of the infection was probably less than sterile conditions. The bacteria was E.Coli. I was never specifically told that 1 in 1_000 insertions end up in PID. The commercials on t.v. state it very clearly. I guess that since my first Mirena was fine_ I did not pay attention.,F,46,5  years 1X D,3/2/2016,Mirena
17, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Weight gain_ moodiness_ cramping_ massive hair loss_ anxiety_ depression,I had the mirena in for about 6 months and my sister told me I had a bald spot. That bad spot is now huge and I have 3 smaller ones. I have to wait the the hormones have run their course before it will stop fallingOut. It has decreased which is great but not stopped as of yet. It's been out for 5 months and yet still small shedding. It's crap and please do your reaserch before deciding to get one done. I'm almost bald on one whole side o my head!,F,31,7  months,3/1/2016Email,Mirena
18, 1, To prevent pregnancy,I'm on my second Mirena now. It was inserted in April of 2015. I had Mirena for 5 years prior to this one_ and it was great. Only side effect was no period at all_ which was great. However_ this one has been completely different. I have insomnia. I am cranky all the time_ and don't feel like myself. I get cramps for no reason. My sex drive has plummeted_ and I don't want to be touched at all. I have acne like a 16 year old. I have gained 25 pounds_ and no matter what I do_ I can't lose weight. Most of it is around my belly_ and I've never had that issue. I'm miserable. I'm getting it removed_ and I will never get another one.,Not worth it. It seems the product is very inconsistent. The side effects vary widely not only from person to person_ but are different in the same person each time they have to get the product re-inserted when it expires.,F,38,6  years,2/9/2016,Mirena
19, 1, birth control,Had third Mirena placed. Within two months_ experienced hair loss around temples that has continued for 6 months_ complexion changed (acne and then rosacea diagnosis)_ and breasts grew by half cup size despite no weight gain. Gynecologist and dermatologist confirmed this is due to the levonorgestrel released by the coil. For the first 10 years of having the Mirena (two separate ones as per the 5-year replacement guidelines)_ I didn't notice any drastic changes. I had the Mirena removed last week as I do not find these side effects acceptable.,,F,35,11  years 1X O,1/31/2016Email,Mirena

21, 2, Birth Control,I thought my increasing cramps and boating were due to IBS but now think it's the Coil_ dull and spotty skin on face_ neck and shoulders. Anxiety_ thinning hair resulting in bald spot at front temple_ increase in hair growth on face and chin_ very short temper_ almost rage like outbursts otherwise overall feeling of nothingness..,Helped with heavy periods but found I was having brown discharge 3 weeks out of 4 and more unpredictable_ gave it 12 months but I paid my dues in terms of bad skin in my youth_ not something I want to be doing in my 40's_ I suffer with a skin picking disorder related to anxiety so it was a recipe for disaster really as both have been worse whilst I had this..my hair is curly so hardly use shampoo_ never brush or comb my hair and even with that gentle treatment it was noticeably thinning. Couple of days ago had enough_couldn't get doctors appointment for weeks and didn't want to fight to get it removed_ looked it up online and removed it myself...even in 48 hrs a proper period appears to have started_ I'm more mellow with the kids and husband_ also my skin seems brighter_ akin to the bloom you get during pregnancy...sounds daft but feels like my body spent 12 months trying to tell me there was something foreign that it wanted out.,F,41,1  years 1X D,12/30/2015,Mirena

Over the last few months_ my periods have been dark brown/black_ mostly like dried blood. According to my husband_ I've been moody_ hateful & crabby for the last several years. I never contributed it to the Mirena_ just the peri-menopausal issue.

32, 3, Birth control,For the first 10 years (2 devices) I was relatively problem free. My periods stopped within 2 months of first insertion and I had smooth sailing. Then I started having regular periods again about 4 months before the 2nd device was due to be removed. I had a failed insertion with the 3rd device_ I was advised to wait 3-4 weeks to try again. After that time passed I had another inserted and an ultrasound a month later confirmed it was placed correctly. However I now feel a shot of deep pelvic pain when I sit a certain way_ and sometimes I get horrendous cramps after sex (never had that before). I am 3 months into this 3rd device and I have gained weight_ my face is covered in acne_ I can't sleep well_ I'm tired and lethargic_ moody_ and very irritable.,"I don't understand how I could have been 100% symptom free for 10 years_ and now be so miserable on this 3rd device.

Panic/anxiety started making me agrophobic 12 months ago_ very out of character for me.

However_ having BAD nausea - to point where needed anti nausea meds - at long last my GP admitted that Mirena could have caused all my problems amd removal causes early pregnancy symptoms in some women!

51, 1, To treat heavy periods,Heavy bleeding_ spotting_ headaches_ mood swings_ random pain,I had Mirena placed on advice of my doctor who I am convinced is getting money from them_ I was in horrible pain for 4 days after insertion to the point my husband wanted to pull it out himself_ my moods have been so on and off and today I had the worst headache I ever had I thought I was dying that was enough for me and the damn thing is getting removed Wednesday my husband has a vascotomty so we aren't using it for birth control I honestly just want it gone,F,36,2  weeks,9/3/2015,Mirena
52, 1, birth control,Headaches_migraines_ backaches breast very sensitive_anxiety_ some palpitations_ sometimes panic attracts_ feeling spaced out sometimes_ can't concentrate_ its awful_,until now reading other women's comments on it_ I had no idea! It's because of this thing! I didn't know what was wrong with me. I would talk to my doctor and all she would say_ is_ it's probably stress_ just try to relax!! I had this put in five years ago it helped back then after the first five months_ but I went and had it replaced because it expired. But since the second one_ I have gotten all these side effects not being able to have a normal life_ thank you everyone for sharing your experiences it gives me hope! I am going to have this removed asap! I had no idea_ I thought I was the only one. God bless you ladies!!,F,52,5  years,9/3/2015Email,Mirena
53, 1, Pregnancy Prevention,From the inception I've had severe cramps- mainly in my back and legs. Ridiculous mood swings which I've never experienced before- so bad my husband and oldest daughter became frightened. Depressed- even to get out of bed is a chore. Daily tasks are overwhelming. Anxious all the time. Panic attacks. I've never had any of these things before. Simple daily life is nerve wrecking.,Asked my Dr multiple times to remove but was encouraged to 'get past' the initial humps. Having it removed after waiting for some relief. Had to demand the removal. I would NEVER recommend an IUD. I never had problems with oral contraceptives.,F,35,9  months,8/29/2015Email,Mirena
54, 3, to not get pregnant,Weight gain_ anxiety_  panic attacks_ bad odor and mood swings!,The first 5 years were great! Didn't have any problems. The second mirena has been a problem.  Everything stated above started happening to me. I plan on having it removed.,F,31,8  years,8/21/2015Email,Mirena
55, 4, To control painful cycle,Stopped the sideeffects of years long Depo shots and  then its withdrawal symptoms(breast pain_ swelling_ weigh gain_ hair-loss_ acne). All of these were gone in less the 24hrs_ -4kg in 5 days after insertion. Improved the mood_ restored self-esteem_ the weight loss is progressing further since then. Only occasional spotting_ some cramps but no bleeding (never bled during depo years)_ random pelvic pain. Satisfied overall. saved me from completely loosing it on Depo..,The unusual pelvic pain is being investigated_ but U.S. found the coil in perfect place_ so it is not the obvious cause. Might be underlying condition enhanced by the change of local hormonal changes. I see how some of you suffer on this_ that is how i was on depo. For me this is light and flawless. I suppose we have differene tolerance levels_ and therefore we react differently to different BCs. If any of you suffer on Mirena_ avoid Depo from afar. ,F,34,2  monthsStandars,8/15/2015Email,Mirena
56, 1, Heavy periods/migraine,Constant bleeding since insertion_ cramp_ itchy_ dry skin_ blurry/dry eyes_ back pain_ extreme fatigue_ worsened migraines_ headaches_ mood swings.,I am going to get this removed this week_ I simply cannot stand it anymore.

57, 5, contraception & painful periods,Nothing bad,After a few months post-insertion_ my periods pretty much stopped with only occasional spotting. After 4 years_ they started back up on a regular cycle but not nearly as heavy or painful as before insertion. After removal_ I had hot flashes for a few months. Now I've returned to having painful and heavy periods. They're also on an erratic schedule_ but that may be because I'm premenopausal.,F,,6  years 1X O,8/9/2015,Mirena
58, 1, Birth Control,Weight Gain! Body acne (large pimples)_ mood swings_ irritability_ absolutely no sex drive_ fatigue all the time_ spotting all the time_ nausea_ headaches or migraines_ vertigo_ itchy skin!,I had the Mirena in August 2014 and had it removed today 7/30/15. I gained 30 lbs in about 4-6 months! The GYN swears it has nothing to do w/it ! BS! I am a nurse! I know my body. I would not recommend this crap to anyone!!!!,F,39,1  years 1X O,7/30/2015Email,Mirena
59, 1, Birth control,Currently recovering from the emergency c section I had to have in order for it to be removed. We were planning on starting for baby number 2 but when my doctor went to remove it in her office_ she couldn't. A scheduled hysteroscopy the following week didn't work_ which turned into a failed laproscopy which then went to a c section. This has derailed my family for this time. I'm unable to care for my daughter. My husband is taking on both roles and working. I'm in pain all the time. It has caused havoc for us. I also experienced every negative side effect while having it so the removal was for more than just wanting to get pregnant so now! Instead of expanding our family I'm recovering and what makes me even more angry is that my second pregnancy will HAVE to be a c section due to the perforations in my uterus. Do NOT get the Mirena IUD. If you have it? Get it out! It's not worth the risk. At any time that thing can start moving around your body. There are other safer options out there,,F,36,7  months 1X D,7/30/2015,Mirena
