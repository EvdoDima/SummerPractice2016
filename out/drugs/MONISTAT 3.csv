0, 5, Suspected yeast infection,"I was freaking out having never having a YI but I had extreme redness_ horrible itching_ which ultimatly lead to burning_ and my discharge was thick!  Never has this happened before_ so online I go_ going against all warnings about not using product if you have never had a YI before_ I had to try!  I got the 3 day_ upon insertion of the first "" egg "" for the first 30min-hr the itching and burning got noticibly worse_ it all depends on your pain tolerance I suspect_ but tolerable!  I didnt lay down like everyone else_ i kept it moving_ which i had some leakage_ but nothing major_ by day 2 my symptoms have completely dissipated_ so Im not sure if I should continue_ but I will!  I will recommend this product without hesitation!   People complain about a burn_ Im more concerned with the red swelling and itching_ devil ass burning with a side of thick pasty discharge that was there pryor to this miracle ""egg"" !  If you can suck up a little pain or discomfort_ try it_ and say ""bye_ bye"" to funk of your YI!  Granted all resullts are different_ but who knows until you try!

1, 5, Yeast infection from antibiotics,Leakage,"This is my 2nd ever yi and first time using monistat. I've been laying in bed for almost 2 hours now_ prepared for extreme pain_ because other reviews warned about ""burning from hell"".

2, 4, Yeast Infection,Itching_ tenderness_ irritation,"I am using the 3 day Combo pack of the suppositories and cream. I was able to go about a week not knowing what was going on. I finally went to the doctor who said to try the 7.  I'd like to say that the area was raw_ but not from itching/ irritating it myself. I believe many are having issues with burning because of that. I took a shower_ laid on my bed inserted the suppository_ put on ""granny panties"" and a light pantyliner and laid there and waited for the pain to start. NEVER happened. Around 30 minutes later I rolled over and went to bed. DID NOT put on the cream though just to not experience double burning. When i woke up in the morning I felt better down there and only had small amount of leakage.Try the suppositories instead of prefilled cream. I decided to put the actual cream in the morning before work to help with any possible itch and it tingled for like 1 minute and then it was fine. I think if you are heavily irritated already of course this will burn. I will finish the rest of the 2 days and continue the cream for the 7 just to kill it off indefinitely.",F,28,3  days200mg_ 3x 1X D,5/10/2016Email,Monistat 3
3, 5, yeast infection due to pregnancy,Itching burning irritation upon urination spotting and lots of discharge,Monistat 3 was a big help !

5, 4, yeast infection,None,I was expecting the worst after reading about how badly this product burned everywhere on the internet_ despite having used it once many years ago. I have what I believe to be a mild but lingering yeast infection and upon the first usage_ I had no side effects. It will come out of you when you go #2 however_ even 24 hours later_ which is somewhat annoying but obviously unavoidable.,F,37,1  days 1X D,2/9/2016,Monistat 3
6, 5, Vaginal Yeast Infection,ONLY burned on a cut.,"I felt 100% better after only 1 out of 3 applications of Monistat 3 (ovules).  I felt zero burning and zero itching apart from what was already there due to the yeast infection itself_ and one cut.  I only applied the remaining two doses to ""finish the course"" so to speak. The only negative about this product (for me) was the messiness_ and it's worth it for the relief it brought.  I had an advanced yeast infection (I've only had one other prior_ and I'm 40).  Keflex (antibiotic) causes them for me.  It had spread to my bottom area and above my pubic line.  After just 1 application the rash had disappeared_ the itching had ceased to exist_ and all I was left with was the extreme swelling and a touch of stubborn discharge (both went away within 2 days_ and I felt no discomfort).  I see a lot of women saying it's devil-fire burning_ and I have no doubt that happened.  But_ if anyone is reading this and you've not yet tried Monistat 3_ please be certain that you do NOT HAVE cuts and/or abrasions from scratching yourself.  I had 1 teeny-tiny little cut from my fingernail in the affected area_ and when that cream hit that 1 little spot it felt like I'd just dipped a Q-tip in acid and held it against the cut.  That is NOT THE PRODUCT'S FAULT_ it was *my* fault for scratching myself raw in the first place.  Had I had more cuts from scratching - I'm thinking the pain would have been extreme.  I would use this again_ for sure.",F,39,3  days200mg 1X D,2/3/2016,Monistat 3
7, 4, Yeast infection,First yeast infection_ never used tampons before so I was slightly scared to use the applicator but it wasn't too bad. After applying the anti itch cream and inserting the cream I laid down and began feeling a burning sensation. Bearable_ but uncomfortable. It kind of feels like icy hot in a way_ after about 20 minutes the burning lessened and began to give a little bit of relief. Hopefully day 2 and 3 are better.,,F,19,1  days,1/28/2016,Monistat 3

10, 2, Yeast infection,Yes I know I'm only 18 and doesn't seem shocking but I have my first yeast infection with my first real partner this year. I'm more of a self cleanse type of girl so when coconut oil helped for a few I finally came to my sense and gave in . I  brought monistat 3 day cream. While doing my research after applying the first dosage I knew I wasn't alone the pain you can say that it was  unbearable but bearable since I'm on the second dosage but as a student of medicine the only reason for the burning because it is cleaning the bacteria inside your body which can be a 50/50 strike for anyone so be advised that everyone is not the same,Yes it can be painful but understand the reasoning for it being the way it is that's why the direction advise you to take it at night when your contempt and are about to go through REMP.S my reasoning for rating it a two is seemly because I am not done with the full treatment and am not quite sure if it had fully worked to my advantage then saving another bill exspnense to my GYN,F,18,3  days,12/27/2015Email,Monistat 3
11, 4, Yeast infection,Okay so first off I wasnt sure if I had BV or a yeast infection. I thought maybe the soap I was using was irritating my lady parts so I waited it out a few days by drinking tons of water.. Well 3 days has passed and the irritation got worse but I still wasn't sure if it was irritated inside.. until I had sex with my husband. I knew right then and there it was a yeast infection because I felt the WORST burning and itching sensation ever. And there was cottage cheese like discharge_ but no odor. So the next day completely convinced it was a yeast infection_ I went to the store and got monistat 3. I was going to get monistat 1 but I really wasn't sure if that was gonna be a great one to get. Well I'm glad I didn't because that's the strongest dose! Soo I finally got the balls to do the first dose of the 3 day right before bed since that's what you're supposed to do. So I inserted it and I felt nothing for the first 30 minutes. I was like hey_ I feel nothing the reviews freaked me out for no reason! Umm no. I got up to use the restroom and use the itch relieving cream and suddenly I felt a mild burning but UNBEARABLE itch! I went and ran to my bed and I could not sit still for nothing! It was the most uncomfortable feeling ever OMG..I was rolling around grunting and sweating and the natural reaction down there is to push it out. Which I was constantly doing I just couldn't help it. Finally I started praying lol. After about 15 minutes the itching stopped but there was a slight bu,Tough it out!!! That's all I can say.,F,22,3  days200mg,11/28/2015Email,Monistat 3
12, 4, yEast infection,This is my 2nd yeast infection.. The first time I had to go to my gyno and she gave me 1 dose of Difulcan which cleared it up immediately. This time I had the same symptoms so I treated it with Monistat 3. The first night I inserted the suppository it burned and itched SO bad for the first 20 min. It was bearable though. 2nd and 3rd night.. No issues. It did take a full seven days however to clear up all symptoms. Hope this helps!!,,F,21,1  days200MG,11/10/2015,Monistat 3
13, 1, Yeast Infection,I'll start by saying everyone reacts to medicine different. My sypmptoms for a YI had just started. So letting it go too long wasn't my case. My doctor said I had a mild YI so try over the counter products. I purchased the Monistat 3 and 10 minutes after I inserted it_ I experienced the worst burning and itching I've ever encountered. It was like I had inserted acid with the applicator. I endured this pain a whole hour before I tried to shower and wash it off. That didn't work. I experienced this pain for 6 hours before I finally felt numb. It is now morning and I have a slight itch/burn still. Not only would I not recommend this product_ I'm not completing the next two days. Everyone is different and some don't experience any side effects_ but if you don't have to risk it_ DONT. Stick with the 7 day or just use the pill.,,F,27,1  days200 MG,11/9/2015,Monistat 3

Unfortunately I still have itching and discomfort down there so it is hard to tell if it actually worked or not. I also now how weird blood clot looking thing coming out when I use the restroom now almost as though I am on my period. The pain was bad the first night I definitely recommend a sleeping pill overall I feel better but am curious as to why I am still uncomfortable.

I'm applying neosporin to the swollen skin around the area and taking ibuprofen to reduce swelling and pain. Seriously hoping the second night gets better. This is the first yeast infection I've had_ and it's because of taking antibiotics after getting strep throat. So the past week or so has been a lot of fun.

21, 3, YI,1st day) To be honest_ I had no clue what to expect since this was my first yeast infection and it was already hurting for a week so when the doctor said that this product would clear it up face I could let wait to try it. BE WARNED this product is different for different people. for me I took a shower then inserted the ovule egg then I use the cream. wrong order. once u put the egg in your done stay down. if it's your first night stay down and take a sleeping pill because you do not want to be conscious for the slow killing of your fungus in a very sensitive area. you think the yeast infection itch and pain was bad well you haven't felt anything yet. 2nd day) The pain is bearable still hard to walk but bearable. I used the itch cream in the morning after washing the white junk from the egg thingy(don't worry it suppose to happen) and for me the itch cream increases the itch so I really wonder if it was good. Used the itch cream again at night then inserted the ovule egg. I took a drowsy medicine to sleep so I'm not sure if it still hurt on the second night3rd day) During the day_ I am contemplating,,F,17,3  days,6/18/2015Email,Monistat 3

23, 1, yeast infection,swollen vulva; burning_ ulcerations,immediately after applying the monistat I felt horrible burning pain.  My vulva became very red and swollen and eventually had multiple ulcerations all over it.  My doctor actually thought I had herpes.  The doctors office did a herpes culture_ which the office then somehow lost.  So I had to go back 8 days later to get the blood work after being treated with valtrex.  I was negative for herpes simplex 2.  My blood showed that I was a carrier of the simplex 1 virus which is commonly associated with oral fever blisters but as 80% of the population carries that virus she can't say if that is what caused the problem.  I know that I have been married for 15 years_ I've never had any issues before and I definitely had a yeast infection.  I instantly had a reaction to the monistat that burned like fire.  I've read online that many others have had the same reaction.,F,36,3  days 1X D,6/11/2015,Monistat 3

Stinging_ itching_ general discomfort.... basically you just have to tough it out with this stuff.I am surprised that the formulation has not been improved but hey_ at least you can get it OTC.

27, 4, yeast infection,It's me again. This is my 3rd day using this product monistat 3. Once I woke up in the morning I would shower and put the shower wash for my vagina called summer eves wash. After I showered I would put in the last egg tube thing in me_ I also applied the external cream where it was irritated. I feel a little better than before honestly...right now I just applied the external cream before bed. I still have my period though. I know it's a bit hard to get healed because of it. I'm almost done with the medication. I'm done with using the eggs but not with the cream I'm going to use it until my 7th day. So far it's my 3rd. I'm going to apply the external cream twice a day. Once in the morning and before bed. Of course I have to clean myself before I apply it. I've also been drinking 2 bottles of water with food. I still feel a light tingle and light burn on my irritation. But I feel alot better forsure!  I'm still going to update you all about this product like how it would go for me on my last day_ my 7th day.,So far it's working great. It burns but of course that means it's doing its magic.

28, 3, yeast infection,This is my second day trying out the product. Yesterday_ before I went to bed I put on the cream only because it says twice a day so the 1time I put it in the morning with the tube thing. Anyway_ this is my 2nd day. just right now I put the tube cream in me and then I put the external cream where it was getting irritation. So far_ im not feeling the way I felt in day 1. Day 1 was the worst_ it burnt me and I felt like puking. I took it like a woman though and drank water alot. Of course you're going to feel a burning sensation because it's infected.... You need to treat it soon before it gets worse. I think I got the yeast infection in the hot tub. Day 2 for me is a little better not as much stinging but still is in the process. I didn't feel like puking this time. I layed down as soon as I used the medicine. Don't forget to put a pad on the cream comes out. I hope this goes away soon....

31, 5, Yeast infection,This is my first yeast infection due to taking antibiotics for a sinus infection. It was a pretty mild yeast infection. I called the nurse line and she stated they recommend trying monistat before being seen by a doctor with the mild symptoms I had. She said to try the 1 or 3 day monistat.  I selected the 3 day due to all the bad reviews of the one day version. I was terrified to try this due to all the negative reviews. Unlike many people_ I did not experience any itching or burning upon insertion. There was a very slight tingly feeling about 15 minutes after I inserted the ovule_ but nothing painful. I had very mild cramping the morning after_ like menstral cramps but they only lasted about 15-30 minutes. I am very happy I tried this and will use it again in the future if needed.,I've noticed many of the negative reviews used the cream version_ not the ovule eggs. I used the less-mess ovule and have not had any problems and my symptoms are much better after just one day. Also_ Vagisil anti-itch cream burned badly_ but the cream that came with Monistat worked great with no burning sensation.,F,30,3  daysX3,3/19/2015,Monistat 3

I wiped down my area and inserted the ""capsule"". Next I used the anti itch cream around the outside of my area to ease any itching or burn I probably would experience. I'm going on about a hour and still no scary itching or burning. At most I have a little tingling sensation. Hopefully this does not intensify over time because I do not want to be woken out of my sleep for this. If it does burn I will apply more cream and try to bear the pain.

I gave it a four rating because of the itching side effects.  I'll probably go back to the Monistat 7 after this experience.,F,40,3  days 1X D,4/9/2011,Monistat 3
119, 4, Yeast Infection,Extreme internal itching/burning,I actually didn't even know I had a yeast infection until I had my annual pap because I had no symptoms except a little more dishcharge_ but I thought that was normal. I took a prescribed pill and it didn't get rid of it so I bought Monistat 3. I used it the first night no problem_ but woke up the next morning with extreme itching and burning which only lasted about an hour. I'm on my second night tonight and am experiencing a lot of internal itching but it's subsiding. We'll see about the 3rd day! I would recommend this so far because I figure if I can feel a reaction to the medication_ then it's probably working!,F,23,2  days 1X D,3/30/2011,Monistat 3

And slight burning- I cannot sit still,"Can someone please tell me how my mildly itching YI has turned into a full fledged itching nightmare from the so called ""cure"" ?

121, 4, Yeast infection,Used the external cream first. Was feeling very itchy and very annoyed. Cream actually helped within minutes of application. Very uncomfortable inserting the internal applicator due to swelling (and overal discomfort anyways); probably didn't insert applicator in completely (could barely get it in maybe 3 or 4 inches?) No discomfort or pain after internal cream. Nothing significant has happened. No pain/discomfort/ITCHINESS any more intense than originally.,This is my first time having a yeast infection_ therefore my first time using Monistat (use generic version). At first I was dreading using the vaginal applicator,F,16,3  days200 mg 1X D,3/7/2011,Monistat 3
122, 3, Possible Yeast infection,Increased mild itching (as bad as it was during the worst of the yeast infection)_ little cramping and periodical warming sensation.,I was not diagnosed with a yeast infection but I had all the symptoms for about a week and a half an could not handle it any longer- it became extremely uncomfortable and embarrassing. Nit being able to get into the gynp for a while- I read about monistat. All the horrific comments sounded better than what I was experiencing so I purchased the three day creme inserts. It's been about a half hour since I used my fist dosage and at first_ I felt nothing. Now it's Bering to itch but not any worse than the actual infection caused. I will be sure to update again after the process is complete but I don't think it's nearly as bad as some of these reviews. We all have different reactions to pain and medication- the only way to know is to try it yourself!,F,18,3  days200 mg 1X D,3/6/2011,Monistat 3
123, 5, Yeast Infection,Minor burning sensation_ strange feeling knowing there is a leaky little egg of medicine sitting in there...,You're all wimps.

124, 3, yeast infection,Burning_ itching_ swelling,This medication is very uncomfortable but here are some tips... take 600 mg of ibuprophen about an hour before you apply the internal deems. Also_ using monistat 7 is very effective and I do not evperience any pain with that medication. Because it is a shorter treatment window_ m3 has to be stronger. So if you don't mind treating yourself for 7 days_ skip the burn and go with m7. Hope this helps!,F,29,3  days 1X D,2/11/2011,Monistat 3
125, 4, Yeast infection,Burning_ increased itching and discomfort_ swelling,I have a love hate relationship with this and all other forms of monistat. Yeast infection can be tough. They can be embarrassing_ painful anxiety causing nightmares that affect us in our personal_ work_ and live lifes and there is not much worse. That being said I can Only imagine how awful it would be to have a yeast infection and not have the money to go to the doctor and get a pill to cure it and have no products OTC available to treat the infection. If I had my choice I would take a pill every time_ but I have not always been able to afford or get to a doctor because of a holiday (Christmas and out of town) In those times I have been very greatful for monistat. However_ the treatment can be harsh_ extremely painful_ and drive you crazier than you ever thought you could feel. The worst pain I ever had in my life hands down was when i let a yeast infection go too long without treatment. I had paper cut type of breaks in the skin from the infection and I have never ever ever had so much pain in my life!! But after about 5 days I was symptom free. Since then I have learned that if you know you aren't going to be able to fight one offbeither take a prescribed pill or use the 3 or 7 day treatment at night. Take 3 benadryl_ 3 Excedrine_ an Ativan (if you have it or something for anxiety) all about 20 min before treatment. Have yourself an ice pack_ snacks_ drinks. And the remote or a book and just pray that the medicine knocks you out before you feel too bad. Have a buddy make,F,27,3  days 1X D,2/1/2011,Monistat 3

I couldn't not lay still_ and kept having to get up and pace. Thankfully this only lasted about an hour. Granted the side effects remained they were tolerable_ and could get some sleep.

128, 5, Yeast Infection,The first night was rough. I had intense throbbing_ itching and was SO uncomfortable. The next day at about noon_ it hit me that I felt much better. The second night...the same. On both nights I took an Aleve tablet. It's for inflamation and I think that was the only thing that allowed me to sleep. But_ my mom always told me if medicine burns....then it's working! :) So_ I stuck it out and I'm feeling better. It's my 3rd since my last dose and I'm still a little itchy_ but I'm about to start my period...so that could be a part of it.,"I have an intense white coat syndrome phobia. I can't go to the doctor. I try to think of people all through time that didn't run to the doctor when something happened and I do think natural remedies help a great deal.  My husband and I were playiing with ""toys."" One was an intense vibrating one that the next day made me sore and irritated. I ignored it until it seemed to get worse. I was swollen and the itching was unbearable. I went to the bathroom one evening and saw pasty white stuff. No odor. I looked online and saw that I more than likely had a yeast infection. I did look at all the other things it could be_ but my symptoms were for YI. I went to Walgreens that night and got the 3 day pack. Also_ before bed that first night and before the first dose_ I took a hot bath with Apple Cider vinegar_ and_ I've done it all week.. THAT soothed me more than I thought possible. My first night with the cream was rough and I took Aleve to help with the throbbing inflamation. The second night was the same_ but I was feeling much better through the day. After the third dose_ I seem to be cured or close to it. I still have some exterior irritation_ and I'm sure that's from the itching and it will take a couple of days to heal. Also_ I'm about to start my period and things are aways weird down there at that time.

132, 5, Dr. recomendation,None,I was suffering with irritation.  I assumed it was the Tide with Downy_ but it wasn't because it did not go away. It got worse to the point I was in tears. I called my Dr. when it got  to this point.  I have't had a YI since I was a teenager so this didn't cross my mind. This worried me_ because I'm not a sexualy active person_ that's why I called my Dr. She told me I had a YI and to go to the store and purchase Monistat 3. It was so cold outside 10 degrees_ 10:00 at night_ but I had to do it. I came back home_ inserted the suppository_ recieved some releif_ fell asleep_ and woke up feeling great. I believe my last 2 treatments will have me back to normal.  I'm a shower person_ and when I read bubble baths can contribute to YI_ I said that's where it came from.  I decided to soak in bubbles one night_ relax have a glass of wine_candles just pampering myself_ and this is what I get_ a YI.   I love showers_ and that is what I'm sticking to from this day forth.  Thank you Monistat 3.  I'm glad I tried this product before reading the feed back.

It is now day 3 and im on the last dosage and i feel great. Im on my period so i havent reallly used the external cream but it doesnt even matter. I will def use again if i get another YI.

Especially since it was cold. I tossed and turned for 2 nights and suffered all day at work and Im so glad its finally over! If anyone has tried monistat and it just burns_ please try plain yogurt.

138, 4, YI,None,After reading the horror storied on this site I was terrified to take Monistat.  I went with the 1-day ovules_ since one night of discomfort seemed better than 3 or 7.  I tested a small amount of the external cream a few hours before bed and had no reaction_ so I felt comfortable with the ovule.  I inserted it just before bed and had absolutely no pain_ burning or itching and slept well.  I think some of the people here either have very severe infections_ broken skin_ or are simply allergic.  As others have suggested_ I highly recommend testing a small amount of external cream before using the product.  I do have some very slight burning today_ not sure if its the cream or just that the infection is not entirely cleared yet.  Either way its hardly noticeable.,F,32,1  days1 day 1X D,12/2/2010,Monistat 3

I used the topical cream first and there was a little bit more itching and burning than was there originally but it subsided quickly_ used the internal dose and it was fine.  The next day I used the topical just like it recommends and the same thing_ slightly more discomfort then fine_ the night dose was intense but only lasted for 10 minutes with itching_ burning_ and a throbbing sensation_ 3rd night was horrible!!! felt like I was sitting on a candle and nothing helped.

The first night I thought it was possibly related to the yeast infection itself even though the infection itself only bothered me slightly during the day.  The itching and burning was unbearable.  I got out of bed and used the bidet for 20 minutes or so the first night and that helped.  The second night nothing seemed to alleviate the itching.    I had a very difficult time falling asleep and was so upset to wake up this morning still burning and itching.

The external cream was awesome! I sincerely believe that some of the ladies waited until they were 4-5 days into the infection_ before they treated it.

I did experience some mild itching and burning on the outside after applying the external cream_ but no problems with the internal cream.  I woke up with less itching than the day before.  I think of the burning experience as the medication working_ and getting rid of the yeast infection.... i mean sometimes when people are prescribed antibiotics they may vomit or feel and upset stomach... not all medicines are pleasant but they just may be strong.  Just suck it up and if it works then it was worth the pain.  I have used monistat before_ experienced the same symptoms while using it_ but its all worth it in the end when my YI is gone.,F,23,3  days1 insert 1X D,8/25/2010Email,Monistat 3

159, 1, mild yeast infection,extreme itching and burning,Used the CVS over-the-counter version: Miconazole 3. Was fine when I first inserted it_ so I stayed in bed and went to sleep. I woke up about 4 hours later with INTENSE internal itching. I tried to ignore it_ but it was so severe I just kept tossing and turning. I finally turned my light on and got on the internet because I was afraid I was having an allergic reaction. After an hour of looking around and writhing in pain_ I finally decided to get this CRAP out of my body. I went to the bathroom and rinsed it out with hot water. The hot cloth provided a bit of relief_ and I was able to get most of the cream out. I took 4 ibuprofen and sat in the bathtub for a while_ and finally was able to get the pain/ itching down enough to get back to sleep. I have no idea why so many people report leaving it in - this stuff feels hazardous_ and I did not want to do that for my body! Today I went out and bought a homeopathic suppository called Yeast Gard_ and I'll up my probiotic intake.

162, 1, yeast infection,Excruciating burning,On the third application (the first two were fine)_ this medication caused extreme burning and I have spent two weeks in excruciating pain_ unable to sleep more than hour at night.  I have a high pain tolerance but this experience has brought me to my knees.  As a result_ I've also become moderately depressed because I have had to stay home from work_ cancel a vacation_ and see countless doctors.  So far_ nothing has healed the burns but I am getting pain relief from 5% lidocaine gel (available only by prescription) applied 4x a day.  I am praying that at some point my tissues heal.

As for the capsules that get inserted_ it did burn during the night_ but today it was fine inside. Just the outside cream - beware. I've used Clotrimaderm cream before on the outside and it great. I recommend that instead.,F,29, 3 day 1X D,4/24/2010,Monistat 3
167, 4, Yeast Infection,I haven't experienced any so far.,I was worried about using this product after I read all of the comments here.  I read about women burning_ itching_ and crying.  It freaked me out.  But people can have different reactions to things and I had to see what it would do to me personally.  So I used a little bit of the cream first and I felt no burning or itching whatsoever.  So before I went to bed_ I inserted the suppository and today I've felt absolutely no side effects.  I'm terribly sorry to everybody who had such a bad reaction to this product.  Your experiences do sound painful.  But so far it is working for me.  To anybody getting ready to use this_ I suggest trying a bit of the cream first to see if you're going to have any kind of bad reaction.  Maybe this product is right for you_ maybe it isn't.  But so far it's been right for me.  I guess I'll see how it turns out.,F,19,3  days 1X D,4/18/2010,Monistat 3
168, 2, yeast infection,Holy crap this stuff itches like crazy...I thought I was going insane. I have never used this before and was at the store and figured I would try it.  I didn't think I could ever itch this bad that it mad me cry...I am only on day one don't know hopefully it will start to feel better,,F,22,  1X D,4/8/2010,Monistat 3
169, 4, Yeast infection; discharge_ burning,Mild increase in itching and burning,"Do not take this until you are completely ready for bed. If possible_ stay in bed all through the night to avoid leakage and maximize the time the cream stays inside. HUGE TIP; wash down there before inserting_ the cleaner you are down there the less your chances are of having it burn as intense when it leaks. I like using the PH balanced soap called Lemisol; you don't have to but I personally like the ""sensation"" it gives. It is only my first night and my first time using M3 cream applicator*I used M7 before.*",F,20,3  days 1X D,3/27/2010,Monistat 3
170, 5, yeast infection from antibiotics,mild cramping_ tingling,like a lot of the other woman who were scared to death about taking monistat 3 after all the horror stories_ i was definitely reluctant to try it. so far so good. granted it's my first night and i'm about to pass out_ but no crazy burning sensations (knock on wood) I was just really ready to be over this stupid infection so i took the risk of having to wash it right back out. thank goodness that wont be necessary. so it's up to you whether or not you want to take the risk...it seems like you have a 50/50 chance of not having crazy side effects. good luck with the treatment! someone SERIOUSLY needs to find a better way to take care of this though...what a struggle!!!,F,19,3  days 1X D,3/12/2010,Monistat 3
171, 5, Yeast infection,"Cooling ""Minty"" Sensation. Fast Acting.",I got the Monistat 3 box. which came with cooling wipes_ ovules_ and a cream_ the ovule itself created a cooling minty sensation_ which was demi-pleasant_ however awkward. as for the cream_ it relieved my itching_ and perhaps its just me but i feel like it has helped the swelling go down.I would recommend this_ and I will buy again if I have another infection.,F,17,3  days 1X D,3/7/2010,Monistat 3
172, 3, Yeast Infection,Severe burning and itching,Completely sympathize with the women who had a problem_ and thank them for posting it.  At 2 in the morning it is nice to know that you do not need to go to the ER!I was uncomfortable with the yeast infection for about 5 days before I purchased this product_ and had done some scratching_ so maybe that made it worse.  But for about two hours I was in absolute writhing agony with the itching and burning.  It was unbearable_ and there should have been a warning.  I very rarely take pain meds_ but I hunted down some Tylenol and that helped.  Some advice - immediately before it got really bad_ I stood up to get some water.  Maybe if you sleep through the night it would leak out more slowly and hurt less.Besides a residual burning_ my yeast infection symptoms seem to be subsiding today_ so I will grind my teeth through another two nights.,F,27,3  days 1X D,2/20/2010,Monistat 3
173, 1, Yeast Infection,Burning_ itching_ swelling_ sore_ OUCH!,So_ its 5:27am and I'v been up all night unable to sleep due to the extreme pain that I am in_ it is so itchy down there_ and it burns. So_ anyways_ I had no problems the first and second days but last night_ my third night taking this is when it started itching and burning. After the second night all the symptoms of my yeast infection were gone but you have to finish the treatment anyways for it to work_ so a couple hours after puting the last ovule up my vagina I woke up in extreme pain from the burning and itching. and I haven't been able to sleep since (I went to bed at around 11:30) so... I would not recomend this product to anyone_ it hurts! I donno what to do to make it better_ and I have school in 2.5 hrs. ahh.,F,17,3  days3 Day 1X D,2/19/2010Email,Monistat 3
174, 2, YI,This was my first time using Monistat 3.  As soon as I inserted the medicine_ I started burning and itching incredibly bad!  I thought something had to be wrong_ so I grabbed my laptop and started searching for answers while laying in bed in pain.  I'm just glad I'm not alone and this seems to be a very common reaction.  That was comforting to me.  Misery loves company! lol.  It has been about an hour after my first application_ and the burning and itching seems to have decreased tremendously.  I just hope everything is okay in the morning and it was worth the pain!  Still debating if I should continue the next two days or not.,,F,29,3  days 1X D,2/12/2010,Monistat 3

The first night my (down there) swole and burned.. the second night wasnt so bad but i cant tell if im gettin better or not becuase it burns when it leaks out! im going to do my last one tonight... hopefully its better...

177, 5, Vaginal Yeast Infection,Only side effects were from the external cream - experienced mild to severe burning and discontinued use of it. No side effects from the ovule inserts!,I used the Monistat 3 Combination Pack about a week ago for a yeast infection that had resulted from strong antibiotic use. The ovule inserts cleared it up with no side effects beyond the heavy leakage overnight and the next morning after use. I only briefly applied the external cream. After experiencing pretty mild to severe burning from it_ I decided against using it at all! I would definitely use this product again if needed. My first time with it wasn't a horrible experience at all!!,F,27,3  days,1/26/2010,Monistat 3
178, 2, Yeast Infection,I got a pretty bad yeast infection from taking antibiotics and took two Diflucan pills and nothing... so I decided to try Monistat 3. Horrible idea. I had the most discomfort and pain. The burning and itching intensified until I couldn't sleep. I have taken it before_ with the same results and know it fades in a little while but I feel stupid for taking it again in the first place. Good to know I am not alone in how this feels.,,F,21,1  days,1/23/2010,Monistat 3
179, 5, yeast infection,Slight itching right after inserting,Slight itching right after inserting_ so I used the creme and that helped. It leaked slightly over night and the next morning after use. But it was very effective! Didn't have any symptoms after that night and used it for all three days. I did have very light bleeding_ but could be getting period earlier than expected..,F,21,3  days,1/19/2010,Monistat 3
180, 5, vaginal yeast infection,none.,i had a persistent yeast infection for about 2 1/2 weeks; i was taking AZO yeast because after reading the comments on monistat i was nervous to try it. but eventually i gave in_ because the pills were not curing the infection at all--it may have actually gotten worse. i used monistat 3 and it immediately gave relief. i had no terrible side effects_ and the infection is gone.,F,20,3  days,1/14/2010,Monistat 3
181, 5, Yeast infection,Itching_ leaking,I was really terrified to take this after reading some of the comments on here_ but decided to go on with taking the monistat 3 ovules. I took my first ovule last night before bed and within about 20 minutes I had pretty intense itching. But that was it. I wasn't doubled over_ I didn't feel like I was on fire. It just itched pretty bad. The next morning the itching was somewhat worse than the day before_ but on other sites I read that the itching means that the medicine is working. I am about to use my second dose and I feel sooo much better than I did yesterday_ the itching and soreness has definitely went away a little. I would have to say the worst part of this whole experience was the leaking that occurred during the night and for the better part of the next morning.,F,20,1  days,1/7/2010,Monistat 3
182, 4, yeast infection,Burning within a few hours of the first dose,The burning woke me up in the middle of the night after the first dose_ which was terrible!!  However_ by the 2nd and 3rd dose_ the burning went away.  Actually_ the initial yeast symptoms subsided very quickly.  Not the most pleasant experience_ but it did work in the end.,F,31,3  days,1/5/2010,Monistat 3
183, 4, yeast infection,none,i read the comments other people were leaving and almost didnt use the product beacause of it. i had no extra itching or burning. the first night about 10 mins after inserting i had some reliefe and last night i used the second dose. i have not had itching all day. i would recomend this product to anyone,F,18,2  days,1/4/2010,Monistat 3
184, 1, yeast infection,The most intense itching I have ever in my life experienced.,I've had quite a few yeast infections before and this time decided to use monistat to help get rid of it quicker. This was the first time and night of using it and 10 minutes after inserting the creme the itching began. The intensity of it can't even be put into words the discomfort is so severe that it's making me twitch. I took 4 ibuprofens_ 2 benadryls_ and a hot bath_ it's starting to become bearable. Not only should the box warn you of intense itching_ it should also tell you how to get the creme out in such cases. NEVER AGAIN_ I'd much rather deal with the yeast infection without medicine.,M,22,1  days,1/4/2010,Monistat 3
185, 1, yeast infection,It burns! Super painful! Beware beware beware!,I was pretty raw down there_ so that's probably why the burning was so terrible. The first night was sheer agony and I writhed in bed in terrible pain for hours. I really don't know how I got myself to use this product the second night_ which was still pretty bad. The third night (last night) did not hurt at all. Not sure yet if it zapped all the little yeasties.,F,25,3  days,12/31/2009,Monistat 3
186, 1, Yeast Infection from antibiotics,Extreme Burning! Unbelievable. i am afraid to put in the second dose! I got the infection from an antibiotic. I have never experienced such burning,It appears that many people using this stuff are having the same strong burning sensation.  Apparently the men in the FDA think there is no problem in approving a drug like this one.Perhaps they should try some on their privates!,F,58,1  days,12/29/2009Email,Monistat 3

I was eventually able to sleep_ but it was difficult. This is after Day 1_ so cannot say yet how effective it is.

190, 4, yeast infection,light bleeding on second and third day,"This medicine seems to have worked well for me.  To those of you who are having horrible itching and burning_ try this.  Get a peri bottle (squirt bottle) and fill it with 1/4 cider vinegar and 3/4 water.  You can use warm water if you're sensitive to cold.  Insert the Monistat and then spray yourself (EXTERNALLY ONLY) with the vinegar solution.  Brace yourself_ because the itching urge will get really intense for a moment.  Try to leave it on for as long as possible (15 to 30 seconds should work).  Then blot yourself off with tissue_ making sure you get all the vinegar.  Now go STRAIGHT to bed.  Do not get out of bed for as long of a time as possible to give the monistat time to work and not leak out.  The vinegar will make you feel a little uncomfortable for about 5 minutes_ but after that you will feel normal... pre-yeast infection.  It is really amazing.  Do an internet search on ""vinegar yeast infection"" and you will see lots more information about how vinegar can help.",F,33,3  days,12/7/2009Email,Monistat 3

192, 5, yeast infection after antibiotics,very very mild itching and burning - less than yeast infection,I was afraid to use this after reading the negative comments_ but had no problem with it.  I suspect those that did were allergic to it and those that had no problems before but did the last time_ had developed an allergy to it.  My suggestion - try a little of the cream externally first to see your reaction.,F,69,3  days,11/25/2009,Monistat 3
193, 2, Yeast infection?,Wow does this burn! Day 1 and the burning is so intense I needed to look up side effects.

When I applied the first dose it felt like my vagina was on fire_ but the next 2 nights I felt no burning. I don't recommend Monistat 1 or 3. I haven't even tried Monistat 1 because of how concentrated it is. I would definitely go for Monistat 7 because that has mild side affects. and you start to feel relief around the 2nd or 3rd day.,F,19,3  days,11/18/2009Email,Monistat 3

I checked the Monistat website and it said_ ""minor burning may occur"" (or something like that)_ so I was even more concerned. No WAY was this minor. I laid in bed whimpering until I fell asleep. The itching yesterday was SO bad and intense_ but nothing compared to the burning from the Monistat last night! I think I have taken this in the past_ and never experienced this. Today I am still uncomfortable - this I would consider slight/minor burning - and I don't think I will continue with this medicine.",F,42,1  days,11/17/2009Email,Monistat 3
196, 2, Yeast Infection,I wish I would have read these comments before I spent almost $20 on this product. I actually purchased Monistat 1--I know I have a yeast infection due to taking antibiotics...it's a very mild yeast infection. I took the monistat 1 because i just wanted to get the dumb thing over with and had never tried monistat before. also am on NUVARING and I had to take my ring out early so i could start this. As soon as the little ovule popped and started leaking (yes im wearing a pantyliner) it is tingling/burning! Not much of an itch but it wasn't too bad to begin with. Last night my vagina was swollen and it hurt just inserting the wand to put the ovule in! Idk when this tingling will go away but thank god i don't have to insert more little ovules. I have been reading to eat lots of yogurt and you can cure a yeast infection with just plain cultured yogurt...once this med is out of me and if it gets any worse im going to try that.,surely there are other remedies out there other than this...feels like a harsh chemical.,F,21,1  days,11/12/2009Email,Monistat 3
197, 4, slight yeast infection,,although the side effects SUCK BIG TIME_ it does say on the box this is common after you first apply.  It does work though so as long as you can stick it out the first dosage it will be okay.  I was literally itching like crazy and felt soooo annoyed but I SLATHERED on the external cream and felt A LOT better.  The best thing to do is trying to not think about it and waiting it out. Everyone's body is different....even the prescribed oral pill for this has negative side effects that seem scarier if you look it up. Any medicine does...just look up side effects people have experienced with ANY birth control under the sun..there's always people who have no side effects and people who have horrible ones.,F,23, ,11/11/2009,Monistat 3
198, 2, yeast infection,intense burning and itching.,I think that this medicine works at killing the yeast_ but it can be very painful.  I think I've used it in the past and once got the really horrible burning and itching and didn't get it another time_ but I can't quite remember.  Try using some aloe vera gel to cool the burning.  It seemed to help a lot.,F,28,2  days,11/7/2009,Monistat 3

After an hour_ the discomfort is beginning to lessen.,I have used other products before without side effects. This is the first time I have used Monistat 3 and the burning was so bad_ I thought I must be having an allergic reaction.  I was relieved to read that this is a common side effect but disgusted that it is still on the market. With other effective products available_ I wouldn't recommend Monistat 3 to anyone.,F,53,1  days,11/1/2009,Monistat 3
201, 1, ,Yeast Infection during pregnancy,I used my first does of the 3-day regiment and I have NEVER been in more pain down there! The burning and itching was MUCH worst after the application of the medication. I would not recommend using this product if you have a fear of feeling like your vagina is on fire... inside and out. I curled up in bed and was afraid to move for fear the burning and itching would get even worse. I could stand about 8-9 minutes before I rushed into the bathtub to rinse the medication off. I will not use this product again.,F,31,1  days,10/26/2009,Monistat 3
202, 1, yeast infection,Very strong burning and itching_ feel like I am on fire,I am sure I used this medication years ago for yeast infections but did not have this kind of reaction. I had surgery last week and they gave me antibiotics_ and it seems I came down with a YI - at least that was what the nurse said on examination. She recommended fluconazole (which I took) and monistat applied externally to my inflamed vulva (the vagina is not involved_ for some reason). The result was almost immediate intense burning. I am sitting with an ice pack down there now! I think I will try to wash this off_ I sure didn't anticipate making it worse_ I wanted some relief!,F,58,1  days,10/20/2009,Monistat 3

I was afraid to do the insert after reading all of these comments since it's basically the same ingredient as the cream_ but went ahead and did it and had NO PROBLEMS!  In fact_ My symptoms are already much better after the first application.  Will definitely do the 2nd and 3rd.,If the external cream itches/burns_ wash it off.  What works much better is Vagisil_ Maximum Strength.  It relieved all of my exterior itching.,F,36,1  days,10/19/2009,Monistat 3

Last night it was really hard to get my mind off the itching and burning_ because it was very bad_ like jump out of my skin bad. I had to take some Tylenol Pm's to go to sleep finally. But I woke up this morning with very little discomfort. Although when I did use the restroom the creme came out too. I'm not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. I also used the External Creme this morning before leaving for work and I have had almost no itching or burning all day. So far good_ we'll just see how tonight goes_ I'll take PM's before so I'll be more relaxed and won't notice the itching and burning part. Good luck with your uses.,,F,18,1  days,9/24/2009,Monistat 3

209, 4, yeast infection,I am prone to yeast infections after taking an antibiotic. I tried the one day before and I did end up with intense burning after inserting it. I have decided this time to try a lower dose and go with the 3 day. I took my first dose about 40 min ago and no problems yet. I believe I caught it pretty early this time and didn't itch myself raw before treating it. I think when it is irritated enough and there is broken skin it makes the burning of putting on a product much more worse. It will cause stinging and burning. I agree also with the lady who mentions tric which is another infection that can cause itching and will NOT go away using any yeast infection product. You will need to go see a doctor to get you on some antibiotic to cure it.,On day one and so far so good. Much better than the 1 day for me.,F,31,1  days,9/2/2009,Monistat 3
210, 2, yeast infection,ITCHING!,If you thought the itching because of the yeast infection was bad_ just wait until you get the itching because of the medicine! Seriously_ it's the middle of the day (day 2) and I'm sitting here itching myself like crazy and it won't go away. The cream doesn't do a damn thing! I'm sticking with the 7 day!,F,20,2  days,8/27/2009,Monistat 3

I used to use the cream version and everytime i did it would burn sooo bad i couldnt sit still i had to do something to take my mind off it. I think mild burning_ however_ from any medicine for yeast infections is perfectly normal. But as i was saying_ the monistat 3 ovule is good for me_ no itching_ burning at all_ and it is a lot more comfortable to insert than using the cream tubes.,F,21,1  days,8/23/2009Email,Monistat 3
212, 4, yeast infection,I had a really good experience with this product.,I was quite reluctant to use Monistat 3 after reading all of the past reviews_ but I was quite pleased with the results.

213, 2, Yeast Infection,Intensed burning and inflamation.,This was my first experience with Monistat 3; I normally use Monistat 7 without any problems so I was extremely surprised and disappointed when I started having the side effects.  Seconds after I inserted the medicine I felt extreme burning instead of relief.  My whole vaginal area became inflamed and irritated.  An ice pack gave me temporary relief_ but I still could sleep until I got in the shower and used the showerhead with hot water to thoroughly rinse the area.  After that I was able to sleep without the irritation.  I had mild burning when I awakened.  I will not be using the rest of this medicine_ I would not recommend it to anyone_ nor will I ever buy it again.,F,36,2  days,8/2/2009Email,Monistat 3

Believe me_ I'm 76_  and I've probably had both of these infections more times than you are old.  They are a plague for women.  I've had to take a lot of antibiotics over the years and each time I end up with the yeast infection.  In fact_ I am going to have to get some Monistat this week because I am on amoxicillin right now.

I was glad to hear that it is the medicine that causes the itching.  I almost thought that I needed to go to the doctor.  Things are feeling better_ so I would certainly advise you to just suck it up_ and follow through.,,F,34,2  days,6/20/2009,Monistat 3
219, 3, yeast infection,burning and intense itching upon use,this sucks. i'm with you girls who cried yourselves to sleep. i haven't cried yet_ and now that i've read your comments_ i feel better. this is night two_ it's 2:10 a.m. and i'm up researching side effects to see if what i'm experiencing is normal. thankfully [???] it is [??]. i just hope it works...i'm debating whether i'll use it tomorrow night. i agree with the poster who recommended terconazole_ i had that once before. this time i treated it myself (generic monistat 3) and....i'll be looking up other brands before i go again.,F,26,2  days,6/13/2009Email,Monistat 3
220, 3, yeast infection :(,Slight burning and itching like crazy!,Well this is my first time ever having a yeast infection and I hope to God I never have one of these things again! I felt an strong* itch more than anything.. the burn I can deal with but the itch was unbelievable! I'm only on my first dose and I really want this thing to be gone... I don't mean to be a baby but it sucks_ never again!!!,F,17,1  days,6/5/2009,Monistat 3

222, 5, Yeast Infection (Soreness/Itching),Slight burning right after I inserted the ovule. It went away after 5 minutes.,This is my second dose_ and I almost feel like I'm back to my old self again. If you are experiencing pain or discomfort_ maybe you should try Monistat 7. It takes longer but it is a lower dosage.,F,27,2  days,4/30/2009,Monistat 3
223, 4, ,Mild burning_ severe itching _ and thick white vaginal discharge,I notice that almost every woman mentions not seeing the side effects on the box.  IT IS NOT ON THE BOX!!!!!! it's on the instruction sheet that comes in side under SIDE EFFECTS. I admit it is uncomfortable at first but very bearable.,F,19,1  days,4/11/2009,Monistat 3
224, 4, 1st yeast infection (dr recommend),None that were out of the ordinary... just slight cramping (no more than what I would get when I'm on my period). Also_ I was pretty tired by yesterday afternoon.I'm taking the 3 day ovule inserts_ and tonight would be my 3rd night. So far everything seems good. Medicine seems to be working.,The only few recommendations that I have about this product are that you probably have to take it right before you go to bed. Otherwise_ if you stand too long after you start using.. then there will be more leakage. Definitely wear pantyliners while using this product. Also_ the only other concern about it is that the ovule applicators don't come individually wrapped. The ovules with the medicine are wrapped_ but the applicators aren't.,F,20,3  days,4/7/2009,Monistat 3
225, 2, yeast infection,Horrible burning!!!!!,"I can't believe the girls on here saying to ""suck it up"". If those girls experienced the pain Monistat has caused me they would also be crying themselves to sleep as I was. The side effects were worse pain that the actual infection was. I was in my bedroom SCREAMING in pain almost immediately after inserting the cream. I will NEVER recommend this product and I am shocked that the company does not have a more accurate warning on the box!!!",F,24,2  days,4/1/2009,Monistat 3
226, 1, yeast infection,severe severe severe burning and pain both inside vagina and out.,I just got back from the emergency room it was so bad. I gave it a 10 on the pain scale and have never been in so much pain in my life. It felt both like my vagina was on fire and like I was being eaten alive. I was prescribed Benadryl and Vicodin and after taking both am finally starting to feel a little better_ but it was 3 and a half hours of blinding pain. I was sobbing hysterically nearly the whole time. It works for some people_ but my doctor prescribed it to me earlier today and even she seemed to have no concept of what would happen. Just be wary.,F,21,1  days,4/1/2009,Monistat 3

228, 3, yeast infection,itchy_ slight burning sensation_ and thick discharge,this was my first time using M3 and it was horrible! i can't truly say if it works or not cause i had to discontinue my use of it. i used it as directed my first night and within 10 mins it felt like my privates were on fire. it burned more when i used it than when i didn't. i couldn't sleep at all cause i couldn't close my legs it burned that bad. i literlly cried myself to sleep. if it works for any of you i'm glad but for me it was to bad to continue_ i discovered that i was allergic to it. best of luck to all those who tried it :o)!,F,24,1  days,3/7/2009,Monistat 3
229, 4, Late-diagnosed yeast infection,Mild burning_ itching around vagina.,This is my first time having a yeast infection and first time using Monistat 3. I wasn't sure if something was wrong because I only experienced pain during sex and when I peed afterward_ but after reading about symptoms online and on the Monistat box_ I knew I had a Y.I.. Just used the first tube last night. I didn't want it leaking all over so I put a few throw pillows under my legs and fell asleep on my back. Didn't have any problems until about 2 o'clock in the morning when I woke up with a warm_ itching sensation around my vagina and realized that some of the cream had begun leaking out. I just forced myself to go back to sleep and today I'm feeling much better(no burning or itching to speak of). Looking forward to being CURED after these next two nights.,F,20,1  days,3/5/2009,Monistat 3

231, 5, Yeast Infection,Mild burning from the vulva cream.,I was on antibiotics for a UTI and soon after I had all the symptoms of a yeast infection. I went and bought the Monistat 3 (ovule form) and read about it on here before I took it. What everyone was saying scared me_ but I knew I had to take it. From what it seems_ the generic brand of Monistat 3 seems to create a burning and itching sensation more than the actual version. I suggest inserting it as far up as possible for best results and wearing a panty liner or small pad for leakage. People commented on how the cream that comes with it burns and itches horribly. Most woman are putting the cream on broken skin so of course it is going to sting a bit. I only put a little bit on and it barely stung.,F,18,3  days,2/12/2009,Monistat 3
232, 5, mild yeast infection,none_ very mild burning the first night,This is my first experiance with yeast infection.I was scared to death reading the experiences of other women for monistat3. I called my dr and begged her to prescribe me the oral medicine_ she explained me how this medicine would just deal with the area effected and it is not a good idea to take a medicine orally and get all kinds of harmful chemicals in my blood stream specially when it is not required. I had no choice and i was sobbing badly before trying it as i thought it would hurt. But to my amazement I was totally fine. A very mild burning was there the 1st night and even in morning. My itching was completely gone. Today is my 2nd night and no burning or itching. I think people who had bad experience were maybe allergic to medicine or had a pretty bad infection. Also_ maybe they had scratched themselves too much and that caused more burning when medicine was applied. Best of luck and yes please don't be scared. NOT EVERYONE HAS HAD A BAD EXPERIANCE.,F,31,3  days,2/2/2009,Monistat 3
233, 4, yeast infection,moderate to severe burning_ pain_ soreness (my fist experience)...mild itching_ it was MORE the soreness and burning that bothered me throughout the treatment_ especially when i urinated. it was too painful for me to stand_ walk_ especially sit during the 1st and 2nd day of treatmet.,honestly_ Monistat3 did not really help soothe any of my symptoms the 1st day/night. BUT by the 2nd and last treatment i was feeling much better. it was really painful with constant soreness during the beginning of my treatment_ but by the 3rd/4th day i had minimal to no itching_ pain or soreness. the only thing that was still bothering me by my 4th/5th day was the slight bleeing_ and mild burning when i urinated. (but i think this is due to the treatment and just needs time for the vaginal to heal). TAKING MONISTAT3 WAS PAINFUL BUT ONLY BECAUSE I THINK IT NEEDED TO KILL OF THE INFECTION THAT WAS INFESTING THE SKIN CELLS. IN THE END I'M HAPPY I TOOK MONISTAT3.,F,25,3  days,1/25/2009,Monistat 3
234, 2, yeast infection,extremely severe burning where I put the cream_ and also inside the vagina. Painful and felt very uncomfortable.,I have the 3 day monistat pill and I have used Monistat 7 (wax-like suppositories) and those had no side effects (but it didnt cure the yeast infection either). My doctor recommended M3 and I am worried about taking the second and third dosage. I think they need to clearly state on the outside box about this side effect because the box only said that 'mild burning' may occur.,F,26,3  days,1/23/2009,Monistat 3

236, 1, yeast infection,"Horrific itching and mild burning on first and second application.  It lasted for hours and was truly awful.  The morning after my second treatment_ I had light bleeding and I'm quite sure it's from the irritation of this ""treatment.""",They should have a warning on the box about the itching and burning.They should have info on the box about whether it's okay to stop this treatment after 1 or 2 days - or_ if like an antibiotic_ we're supposed to keep going to avoid making things worse.Seriously_ they have no helpful info on the box whatsoever!,M,40,2  days,1/18/2009,Monistat 3

238, 4, mild yeast infection,Very mild burning.,I wanted to post a comment on here because I had very bad side effects from taking Monistat 1 a year ago.  With Monistat 1 I experienced the extremely painful burning that other women have mentioned.  I had a MUCH better experience with Monistat 3.

240, 5, YEAST INFECTION,INCREDIBLE AND HORRIBLE BURNING AND ITCHING ABOUT 15 OR 20 MINUTES AFTER FIRST APPLICATION,I've only taken my first dose last night but I have used it once before when I was pregnant.  The burning sensation is truly terrible and almost unbearable but it does work greatly.  The symptoms get milder as the treatment progresses.  What helps me get through it is that I keep thinking that the burning sensation is the medication working.  Have you noticed that the women who have the most serious and scary and terrible complaints are older women_ maybe this has a connection.  Don't let these comments discourage you_ it works greatly_ most good things have a bad side effect and you have to feel bad before you feel better.,F,23,1  days,1/9/2009,Monistat 3
241, 2, Yeast Infection,I agree with these other ladies...you people who say not to be so dramatic are ridiculous! The pain and itching I felt the first time I used it was awful! I almost took myself to the ER. Nowhere on the box does it state that this will occur_ so I thought surely there is something wrong! It says mild itchiness may occur. Mild my a**! This was bad! but I have to say_ it seems like it is working.,,F,22,3  days,1/7/2009,Monistat 3

243, 5, Monistat 3,I can see why some of you ladies would complain about using the applicator to insert the Monistat into your vaginas. Although the applicator is not as smooth as I would have ideally liked it to be_ it was not entirely unbearable. All in all_ it was NOT painful to use Monistat.,Right before my man walked in the door with the Monistat 3 (sweet guy went to the grocery store to purchase it for me because I was being a baby about the whole yeast infection experience)_ I started freaking out about using the medication altogether because I was reading about all the negative comments on this site. I think people have a tendency to over-exaggerate and embellish their stories. Please do not let the comments here discourage you or frighten you from a medicine that could potentially help you get relief!!!

And just because it didnt work for you doesnt mean it wont work for others. If you had read the instructions well it told u to cunsult a doc before using. For the mos part this product is still being sold because it works!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was a first time user and i was very satified. At first was scared to use it because of some comments that were left but consulting my doc and using monistat 3 i was relieved both mentally and physically.,F,23,3  days,11/9/2008,Monistat 3
245, 5, Yeast Infection (antibiotics),With the first application of the cream_ there was a burning sensation_ which I see a lot of people have experienced. However_ the skin down there is broken_ so helloooo_ of course it's going to burn! After the first application_ I went to sleep. Once I woke up_ there was no more burning_ itching_ or irritation whatsoever. I even put some of the cream on just in case...but that didn't burn the second time.

247, 4, Yeast Infection,I agree with the other women that after inserting the medication there is a burning and itching sensation. My yeast infection was mild_ so the side effects were not as bad. Monistat works_ but if you can have your GYN call you in a oral medication_ diflucan. My GYN also recommended using 3 day or 7 day for best results.,,F,22,3  days,10/27/2008,Monistat 3
248, 3, Yeast infection,Any time I take antibiotics I get a yeast infection.  I always get Monistat 3 or the store brand equivalent.  Even though I KNOW I'm going to SUFFER.  This product does work_ I'll give it that_ but within minutes of inserting the cream I get the most horrendous uncontrollable torturous ITCHING that does not stop!  I just want to shove a piece of sandpaper inside of me to make it stop!  This is just AWFUL.  WTF don't they sell Diflucan over the counter?!  I give this product a 3 because it works_ but it is negative one MILLION on the side effects.  Absolutely horrible!!,,F,35,1  days,8/12/2008,Monistat 3
249, 4, Yeast infection :(,Mild itching after applying. Nothing too bad.,I actually took care of this as soon as I had symptoms. The prefilled cream ones. Night 1 of medication I experienced minor internal itching. It didn't last long. The next morning I was feeling a little better. Not all better though. Night 2 It did not itch. Night 3 is tonight. My symptoms are gone but I will complete the 3 day process.      Overall I recommend this product_ However If you really didn't catch your infection early on_ maybe something stronger should be used. I've had yeast infections in the past and waited a day or two to take care of it and it just got worse. The worse it is the stronger the medication I guess. I've used Monistat 7 in those cases and that usually worked in about 5 days for me.,F,29,3  days,8/8/2008,Monistat 3

My only complaint is that the applicator tubes have a rough edge and ended up scraping me on the inside when I applied the internal cream_ resulting in some bleeding which is still going on.

So i took it for the second day and it was not much itchng_ nor for the third day and now its been about 5 days and i am completely cured. The itching and burning was bad but the results are worth it. Trust me_ i would recommend this to anyone so long as you know the HORRIBLE itching and burning is okay lol.

I had a very little bleeding the morning after but the insert says that you may have that.,When I was in high school I had a very mild yeast infection & don't really remember what I took or how I felt. This is my second one but I caught it at the very start. Before using the first aplication last night I read most of these postings & almost didn't use it because some of the experiences these other women had. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't let it scare you into not using this product. I know everyone reacts to medications differently but talk to your Dr first if you have concerns.

253, 5, Bad Yeast Infection,None besides the slight burning which is normal and quite common_ from what I've heard.,I honestly searched up this YI Med before using it and came across this website with all these negative comments towards the med... thankfully I did not freak out_ instead I tried it myself and by the first dosage_ the irritation/symptoms of a yeast infection went away! I was so relieved because it was horrible...  I'm finally done all 3_ and extremely satisfied with the results_ it's unfortunate that some women did not have any good results because it worked great on me. Didn't have to wait at the doctors office to notify him and get a prescription_ than waste double the money for antibiotics.

I actually took Monistat 1. No itching_ no pain_ no side effects at all. I'm really surprised by some of the extreme side effects of some of the other users. I should note that I did catch it very early and have very mild symptoms so maybe that does have something to do with it_ also_ I think it's very important to get it in as far as it will go.,F,25,1  days,3/2/2008,Monistat 3
258, 5, Yeast Infection,Slightly burning the morning after the application.,It is my first time having a yeast infection. I did a swab to make sure it is a yeast infection_ and still waiting for the result. I knew it was because of the symptoms_ especially the itching and burning part. Spoke to the nurse and told me to get Monistat. Not sure which one to pick_ so I took the 3 day pill. The first try was great!!! Relieved my itching_ but still felt a slight burning. I just had my second pill_ and after inserting it_ lots of yellowy_ smelly thick cream like medication came out gushing...that wasn't pleasing at all.

260, 4, yeast infection,"justThe white""crap""that wont go away",I think if you catch it at the earlier states you wouldn't have the problems. I used it and I have no problems at all. I googled yeast infection because this is my second one and I wanted to know the warning signs. On the package it says not to use if it's your first time and to call a doctor. I called my doctor and I used it until i could go and he said it was gone but to make 100% sure I got some more antibiotics from him.,F,25,2  days,11/9/2007,Monistat 3

I just took the 1 dose ovule ( have taken the 3 day before)...had to take it twice as the first time  I took it during the day (box says you can) and it fell out in to the toilet when I had a BM!  :-)  Inserted the ovule WAY up second time (and before bed)_ used cooling wipes and cream IMMEDIATELY (all came in the package) and aside from some short term itching and buring and of course_ leakage of the product (wear a pad)  my infection seems to be clearing up. I think the name brand may burn less than the generics.  Maybe it is worth the extra few dollars?,M,44,2  days,10/16/2007,Monistat 3
262, 4, Yeast Infection,Worked well for me...,When my Dr. diagnosed me with a yeast infection from taking antibiotics she told me to try Monistat 3. I bought the combination pack that included the external cream as well. I found this site before taking it_ and after reading some of the other experiences people have had with this product_ I was too scared to take it for three days!!  Finally after a miserable l-o-n-g weekend I tested a small amount and found it did not bother me.  Thank goodness!  It worked really well for me and eased my symptoms right away...it takes a couple of days for it to completly cure the yeast infection.  I took it for the three days then continued to use the external cream for a few extra days.  At first I was concerned because not all of my symptoms were gone after the initial three days though they were MUCH improved and the external cream would take care of them completly for awhile.

263, 4, Self diagnosed yeast infection,very very mild cramping,I read the comments on this site and they almost scared me into not using the Walgreen's brand of Monistat 3.  For those of you reading these comments and are not sure of taking this medication: 1. keep in mind that burning and itching are part of the symptoms of a yeast infection  2.  if anyone experiences anything more than the burning and itching it could be an allergic reaction.  My advice is to take some of the cream and place a SMALL dot on the inside of your arm to see if you react before using Monistat or any other yeast infection cure product.,F,33,3  days,9/24/2007,Monistat 3

I assumed this unbelievable pain was simply the result of a yeast infection_ though I'd never experienced pain anything like this before with a yeast infection.

267, 3, Persistant yeast infection,burning_ itching,I put in the medication_ went to bed (was extremely tired and immediately passed out)_ woke up_ went to the bathroom_ and felt the burning and itching. Yes_ it was very bad_ but not unbearable (maybe I have a high pain tolerance? Who knows). Used Vagisil external cream and now do not feel burning or itching at all. Will continue using as two doses of Diflucan have failed me. Don't really see another option... everyone reacts differently to every medication! Was on Cipro for 6 days and had no side effects_ for example.,F,22,3  days,5/4/2007,Monistat 3
268, 1, yeast infection,MASSIVE BURNING AND ITCHING.,The pain didn't start when I first put the medicine in_ it was when the medicine started to come out on it's own the next morning after I got up.  I think the medicine sitting on an already irritated area made it all that much worse.  I hope it cures the yeast infection_ as I will suffer through the last dose tonight.  It better cure it after this pain.,F,34, ,5/4/2007,Monistat 3
269, 5, Mild Yeast Infection,I just took the first insert last night and it felt completely fine.  The only pain I felt was a slight feeling of cramping later on in the night. It was_ though_ kind of annoying trying to lay down after inserting the cream because it did leak A LOT! So I  definately recommend that you do get some kind of pantyliner or the cream will get everywhere!,I would recommend it. And I cannot believe so many people on this site had so many problems with it. I am sooo glad that I did not read this before I bought the product or I would have been freaked out and probably would have ended up spending WAY more money at the doctors on a pill. I honestly just think Monistat 3 will be different for everyone because everyone's body reacts differently to all kinds of medications. I say if your really that worried about the Monistat 3 worsening your pain and/or you are prone to irritation easily then you probably should fork up the extra dough to ensure painlessness.

270, 1, ,Tonight I went to the store and bought Monistat 3 for my yeast infection.  I was really looking forward to bedtime_ thinking that I would get some relief and not itch.  A couple minutes after I inserted the medicine_ I started itching so badly_ I couldn't contain myself.  I tried wiping it off_ peeing_ dancing around_ it just ITCHES SOOOOO BAD!!!  I can't take it.  I will never ever ever take this product again!  This was the worst decision I've ever made.  I would rather let the infection eat me alive than take Monistat again!,,F,24,1  days,4/27/2007,Monistat 3
271, 5, Terrible yeast infection,Slight increased itching around entrance_ which was cured by the external cream that comes with it.,I didnt use the cream kind.  I've used it the 4 times I've gotten a yeast infection... and it worked perfectly everytime and get rid of my infection within a day after the treatment was over.,F,17,4  times,4/26/2007,Monistat 3
272, 4, Self-diagnosed yeast infection.,I have experienced ZERO side effects. LADIES_ LISTEN UP. For all of you out there who are frustrated about what to do with your itching vagina_ and you come here and read a billion horror stories about this product_ CHILL OUT. I realize that you aren't liars here and I'm sure you had severe problems_ but I read this page prior to buying it and prior to using it_ and I was COMPLETELY TERRIFIED. I bought this product two days ago_ I've used it 2 of the 3 nights_ and I have felt NOTHING but relief. I was scared as well because I didn't go see my doctor first_ but I was pretty sure I had a yeast infection because I'd taken antibiotics and started itching soon after. But Monistat 3 has definitely taken away the itching and the general icky feeling.,I got the suppositories that can be inserted_ not the cream. INSERT THIS MEDICINE RIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED. I have experienced NO messiness and this is the way I've went about it. Also_ some of your burning and itching may be because you didn't insert it ALL THE WAY. It's like a half-inserted tampon: it's gonna hurt. So shove it in as far as it goes.Girls_ relax.,F,18,2  days,3/29/2007,Monistat 3
273, 4, Yeast Infection - self diagnosed,"I had a yeast infection 2 other times in my life - and I am a firm beleiver it matters WHEN you start the product.  I've taken Monistat 3 - this last time (last night was my last dose) and last summer_ and each time_ the outcome was fine.  Last summer was better - but that was the LOTION that you pump in the inserters.  This time_ I accidentally got the ""tablets"" or whatever - they look like lipstick...and though I'm finished with my dosage_ I feel like I may need another one - though I may not.  But_ point blank - if you do something about any uncommon itching/burning AS SOON AS YOU FEEL SOMETHING (that night) - then you should be fine.  Unless_ of course_ your body doesn't react well to Monistat.  But_ I""ve never had any complaints.  I'm not 100%_ but compared to 2 days ago - I am in heaven because that was definitey HELL.  UgH--i hate them...and the funny thing is - I got it from taking Penicillin for a week for a dental infection!!  You think taking something good fo",I RECOMMEND it...just make sure you get the LOTION that goes into the tubes...and I'd stick with 3-5 day dosages.  I never went wrong with 5.,F,25,3  days,3/26/2007Email,Monistat 3
274, 1, Mild Yeast Infection,Add me to the list.  First time in years I'd had a yeast infection_ I'd caught it early and tried the M3.  Within a minute of inserting the cream_ the itching was unbearable.  It was truly shocking waves of itching -- much_ much worse than what I'd been dealing with from the infection.  The only thing that brought the itching down to a tolerable level was a warm bath and getting as much of the cream out as I could.,I'm astonished this product is still on the market with so many complaints.  I will be calling my PCP this morning_ who prescribed me the antibiotics a few weeks ago that gave me the yeast infection_ but from now on_ I'll stick with yogurt_ diflucan or something from the health store.,M,35,1  days,3/26/2007,Monistat 3
275, 5, yeast infection,slight burning and that is normal.,I dont understand what these woman are talking about!! this site scared the crap out of me when I first used the product. I used the product the first day and I felt nothing and went right to sleep but when I woke up It was burning because it was leaking out. Then I went to this site to see if burning was normal and these woman are saying it was so bad but it was a light burning nothing I could not handle_ but after reading this I was scared to use it again_ but I did because I wanted to get rid of this thing. The second night i used it I felt slight burning when i laid down for awhile but nothing wh en I woke up I took a nice shower and went on about my bis the third night I felt alittle more burning but nothing serious I went right to sleep_ I woke up and it was alittle burning took a nice shower and went on with my day_ not a big deal at all. I do believe my yeast infection is gone but if not I will take a diflican if the symptoms come back. Ladies my advice would be to not look at,F,22,3  days,3/23/2007,Monistat 3
276, 2, yeast infection from antibiotic use,INTENSE ITCHING_ like nothing experienced before applying the medication! I used the Walgreen's brand (Miconazole-3) and had the same awful side effects reported here: nearly unbearable itching and burning after applying the product. I'm just relieved to find that so many other women had the same problem with these products - I thought it was just me! I used Maximum Strength Vagisil following the applications to help squelch the HORRENDOUS ITCHING (despite instructions not to use other vaginal products simultaneously).,"The labels on both products (Monistat-3 and Miconazole-3) should CLEARLY WARN that INTENSE ITCHING AND DISCOMFORT may occur (not just ""mild itching and burning_"" as printed on the Walgreen's brand box). I took the 3rd dose last night so do not know yet if the yeast infection has been knocked out or not. I hope other women here will report back regarding the final results_ after suffering through the cure!",F,48,3  days,3/21/2007,Monistat 3

278, 2, Reaction to Amoxicillin,PAIN PAIN AND MORE PAINHOT BURNING PAIN FOR HOURSNEXT DAY_ STILL SORE,WHY_ WHY_ WHY WOULD A MANUFACTURER OF SUCH A PRODUCT USE AN INGREDIENT THAT STINGS_ BURNS_ ETC.I PHONED THE MANUFACTURER AND GOT MONEY REFUNDED - BUT WHAT ABOUT PAIN AND SUFFERING?NO_ I AM NOT A BABY !!   I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN AND A CANCER SURVIVOR FOR TWENTY YEARS.....GET RID OF THIS PRODUCT AND GIVE US SOMETHING THAT CURES THE PROBLEM WITHOUT CAUSING SUCH PAIN,F,64,1  days,3/15/2007Email,Monistat 3
279, 5, yeast infection,It was itchy and burned a little at first but I had taken some tylenol PM and fell right asleep. I was itchy and burning before I took it too...I woke up and had no more sympotoms and in 3 days my infection was gone.,,F,33,3  days,3/9/2007,Monistat 3
280, 3, yeast infection,I used the 3 day pill instead of the cream this time and it was 1_000_000 times better. I'm not finished taking it yet but there is no pain with the 3 day pill.,my doctor told me that if you have a reaction to monistat then to try canesten_ and that unless its a really mild yeast infection then to do a 6 day treatment rather than 3!,F,21,2  days,2/28/2007,Monistat 3
281, 1, Self-diagnosed yeast infection,"Day one was okay...  not bad... day two.. OMG_ can you say ""Vagina of Fire?"" All i wanted to do was get it out!!! Called a nurse hotline who suggested a 1/2 cup of baking soda in a 1/2 tub of water which seems to have helped somewhat_ but man... I AM NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN. EVER. This 'cure' was worse than the 'disease'!!! The nurse I spoke to said this wasn't the first time she'd taken a call like mine.",ER doc said i'd probably get a YI after he switched my anti-biotics for an abscessed tooth from Amoxicilian to Clindimycin... so when the symptoms appeared_ i headed to the pharmacy per his instructions and chose Monistat at the recommendation of the pharmacist. Someone had suggested plain yogurt_ I wish I'd listened instead of scoffing... this was a horrible experience.,F,38,2  days,2/28/2007,Monistat 3
282, 5, Yeast Infection,none,My first yeast infection_ the walk in clinic doctor prescribed to me Monistat7 and was cured from it.  For my second yeast infection (2 years after my first) I bought monistat 3 because I didn't want to be on the meds for a week.  It cured me just fine.  I don't see how other women are in such pain_ but then again each women have different bodies.  I recommend this product to any woman with a yeast infection...YOU WILL BE FINE_ don't listen to the other women...just suck it up,F,20,3  days,2/26/2007,Monistat 3
283, 1, Recurrent yeast infection,I feel vindicated that I found this website. My gyn told me he's never heard of such a reaction as I had. My entire vulva swelled up and was on fire and it took days for it to settle.,I was depressed and in sheer agony. I used to use this stuff and it was a relief. I don't know what changed.,F,30,3  days,2/9/2007,Monistat 3
284, 5, Yeast Infection,The side effects are worse than the actual infection. Within 2 minutes after taking my first dose I began feeling this intense itching/burning sensation. This kept me up for the majority of the night. As I said before my syptoms were nowhere near as bad before as they are now and I'm not understanding why or how that is possible. After reading many of these comments I find comfort in knowing that it is not just me or something I did_ and can now conclude that I shouldn't continue the next two doses.,I understand that everyone's body reacts different however the fact is that there are many of us on here that are experiencing the same problem and to the same degrees of discomfort. I recommend to those who have not used this product to maybe think of some alternative methods and/or products,F,23,1  days,12/28/2006,Monistat 3
285, 5, yeast infection,i never had any problems with this medication at all.,cured my yeast infection in three days.  no itching_ burning_ etc.  i had no problems whatsoever!,F,20,3  days,9/29/2006,Monistat 3
286, 2, Yeast Infection,My first injection went fine. With my second injection_ the burning/itching got so bad that I ended up lying down in my shower washing the drug out.  I braved trying the third injection_ and the side effects weren't as instense so I ended up falling asleep_ BUT I woke up soaked in blood which bled through my panties_ pants_ and onto my bed.  The bleeding stopped by the next day_ but definitely disconcerting.,Though the cream is somewhat relieving_ I wouldn't use this product.  Go to the dotor and get a one-time medication or use yogurt.  This drug hurt me more than it helped.,F,20,3  days,9/24/2006,Monistat 3
287, 1, Yeast Infection,Unbearable burning_ pain & swelling.,Have been taking Sporanox for a few days to eradicate yeast infection.  In the meantime_ I decided to purchase the Monistat cream to help with the burning & itching.  What a mistake!!!!I used Monistat years ago many times without a problem so am wondering what the deal is now.  Don't use this product.,F,53,1  days,9/21/2006,Monistat 3
288, 1, 1 dose,Burning/Itching Severe... The extreme swelling of one of my inner lips!!!!  (scary) and redness all over...Also in the past the monistat 3 burned me and turned my whole vagina white (and im black),i had mild irritation due to a yeast infection caused by takin anitbiotics.  im not finished with the anti-biotic so i didnt want to take the diflucan yet.. so i got the 1 dose over the counter (Tioconazole is the generic name).  This has my vagina itching and burning severly.  I woke up with redness all over_ white at the bottom_ and one of my inner lips ARE SWOLLEN LIKE CRAZY.. im just scared.  Ive decided to stay home from work and continue to wash like every couple of hours to keep this medicine off my skin while it seeps out.  My Er copay is 100 bucks and my doctor is 30... so im gonna wait it out to see if it goes down.  This is the WORST experience ever. I just cant believe it.  I do feel better that I am not the only one that this happend to.  This product should be banned.,F,26,1  days,9/20/2006,Monistat 3
289, 1, ,don't even think this deserves a rating of 1. more like -1.,bad allergic reaction to this stuff. burning_ painful feeling_ flushing of the face_ dizzy feeling. don't recommend this crap. I'd rather slam my head into a wall!,F,23, ,8/13/2006,Monistat 3
290, 2, yeast infection,incredible burning sensation that sent my heart racing---literally put me in a panic. i am not sure why_ but this treatment is very painful. there must be a better way to irradicate a yeast infection.,,F,30,1  days,8/9/2006,Monistat 3
