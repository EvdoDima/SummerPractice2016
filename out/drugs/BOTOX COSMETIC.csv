2, 1, Chronic migraines after whiplash,First 24 hours reduced headache_ then it started back up but different_ behind eyes_ dizziness_ serious pain in neck and shoulders plus raging headache. One thumb went numb within 24 hours. Head is hard to hold up_ muscles feel very weak or atrophied_ flu like symptoms and now 10 days post injections.,I ABSOLUTELY wish I hadn't done this. It feels worse than before... I cannot lean over as the neck is so weak. I can't get comfortable without lying down. I do not recommend it and wish i hadn't been talked into it. Expensive mistake. HOPE it wears off soon. Fatigue and GI upset too.,F,48,1  days150mg 1X D,9/24/2014,Botox cosmetic

4, 5, Chronic daily migraines,Pain at injection site.  Migraine headache increased for 7 to 10 days after injection then subsided.,Botox is the only thing that has helped my migraines.  Doesn't completely resolve the migraine symptoms_ but severely reduces the pain in about a week  to ten days after injection.  First couple of times didn't show big improvement.  Third time on and beyond was the charm.,F,45,1  years90 units 1X O,1/28/2014,Botox cosmetic

6, 1, Migraines,Intolerable face and head pain - migraines much worse after getting injections _ Bedridden because of the pain and nausea_ also had trouble swallowing food_ had to wear soft neck collar a while to keep head upright ( hospitalized for 3 weeks) and hair loss,I felt somewhat bullied into trying Botox_ my neuro at the time gave many people Botox _ I had been to urgent care several times for pain - a pain shot would usually give me relief _ make me sleep _ and I often would have weeks of No or manageable head pain  . Before Botox I had bad migraines_ but with interventions I was able to take care of my 2 special needs children_ take them to ot pt and speech therapies_ homeschool- etc I also began taking care of my father after he had a stroke and could not stay at his home . Since the Botox shots my unrelenting and excruciating pain made it impossible to get out of bed most days_ kids had to be placed in public school_ have only been able to drive a handful of days in four years.  I am still having excruciating pain_ My gut reaction was not to get the Botox . I let others sway my decision.That's my experience. ( Botox injections were about 23 injections head and forehead- in 2008),F,45,1  times2 vials ? 1X D,9/14/2012,Botox cosmetic
7, 1, Chronic headaches,Headaches for about three weeks_ bruising around my eyes_ then massive_ continuing hair loss.,I love the look of my smooth forehead_ unwrinkled eyes_ and no more headaches_ but my hair has lost fifty percent of the volume_ and I'm still losing it. I'm terrified and worried that it won't stop. I've been tested for lupus_ thyroid_ and many others_ and they all came back normal. I've not lost a large amount of weight_ changed my eating_ started taking any new prescriptions_ over the counter medicines_ supplements_ or had any stressful events happen in the last year that could have caused it_ except for my getting the botox injections around and between my eyes_ and in my forehead. It's been a miracle for headache relief_ but a nightmare because of the hair loss. I'll probably never know if it was the Botox that caused it_ but I'll never have it again to find out.,F,45, 25 units 1X D,5/30/2012Email,Botox cosmetic
8, 5, Migraine Headache,None,After YEARS of daily headaches_ this has provided relief.  I have had no side effects.  I have tried numerous other medicines both preventative and reactive_ and this is the only thing that has provided sustained relief.  It is  a miracle drug.,F,45,1  years30+ inject 1X O,11/29/2011,Botox cosmetic
9, 1, forehead lines and wrinkles,I received one Botox injection in forehead from an experienced dermatologist/M.D. The next day I had weakness in my legs and felt terrible. This weakness lasted for 2 months I was lethargic and had to sleep a lot. Also  had trouble concentrating on anything and due to the weakness in my arms_ I couldn't lift anything heavy.. Dr. said that it couldn't possibly be from the Botox. I know otherwise!! I will never ever get this injection again. There are many alternatives to try.,,F,53,1  days 1X D,11/28/2011,Botox cosmetic
10, 5, frequent migraines,pain at injection site_ forehead mostly paralysed (no wrinkles!),Miracle drug.  Gave me my life back.  Didn't work at all the first time_ slightly effective the 2nd time_  the 3rd time was the charm.  I started off getting Botox every 3 months_ eventually got to every 4 1/2 months.  My migraines are always behind the eyes so I mostly got injected in my forehead which hurt a lot but the results are more than worth the pain.  Also_ it's expensive but fortunately a large part is covered by my plan_ and again_ worth it at any cost.  My migraines went to weeks_ a month_ up to 2 months apart instead of 3 days out of every week.  And when I got them_ they required less pain reliever to get rid of them and they didn't return.  Botox has been my lifesaver and I've recommended it to everyone I know.  Unfortunately now_ after 3 years_ I've apparently built up antibodies to the drug and it no longer works well for me and I have to come off it.  Am so depressed. I now need to find another drug.,F,51,3  years100 cc 1X AN,5/31/2011,Botox cosmetic
11, 1, Treatment resistant migraines,Headache_ neck pain_ flu symptoms_ sinus pain_ congestion_ nausea_ difficulty breathing and swallowing,Six weeks ago received 100 units of Botox for treatment resistant migraines. The injections were administered in my forehead_ temple_ neck and the back of my head. This was done by a well known_ experienced and trusted doctor who specializes in pain mgmt. My reaction to this medication has been horrible. I have had sinus pain_ pressure_ bronchitis_ headache and flu symptoms for six weeks now. My vision has become blurry. My mind is in a fog and I can't concentrate. I'm experiencing depression and anxiety. My ears are completely stopped up and I have been having difficulty breathing. I am dizzy and nauseas. This has been going in for 6 weeks. I lost my job because of it! My suggestion to anyone considering putting this medication in your body is do your research. I failed to do so and now I must pay the consequences. The irony is_ I still have migraines. If you're considering Botox for cosmetic use_ I urge you to onsider. The side effects I'm experiencing do not occur in everyone_ but it could happen to you!,F,28,6  weeks100 units 1X O,4/16/2011Email,Botox cosmetic
12, 5, Migraine prevention,Soreness at injection site for a few days.,I have nearly daily migraines and had injections 9 days ago. Have not had a migraine since. My neurologist will discontinue the several other preventive meds that I am on and I will be drug free except for periodic botox injections. I suppose I will take something if and when I do experience a migraine.,M,49, ? 1X O,4/6/2011Email,Botox cosmetic
13, 4, chronic neck_ shoulder and tmj pain,i have chronic pain in my neck_ shoulders and tmj joints as well as some mild low back pain and muscle tightness all over so it's really hard for me to tell what is normal pains_etc..and what may be a side effect. i don't think i have had any significant side effects. a mild to moderate stinging when it's injected depending on the area. i have about 4 rounds of injections in the past year. at 1st i didn't think it worked much at all until after the 2nd and 3rd round started to wear off and the pain increased so i realized it did work afterall. hasn't been a miracle drug but has helped me.,usually get around 30-40 injections in my neck_ left shoulder_ upper left arm and both tmj joints. I honestly think my doctor who uses this medicine alot hasn't quite figured out all the right spots yet to inject for the best effect.if you have chronic pain_ its worth giving a try! and most insurances cover the cost (minus your co-pays and deductibles).,M,38,1  years?? 1X O,11/3/2010,Botox cosmetic
14, 5, Migraines,Occasional slight bruising_ tenderness at injection site for a few days,This is a miracle drug!  I have tried multiple prophilactics_ and they all worked for awhile_ then the effect wore off.  I no longer have to take other meds for migraines.  I only use botox.  It takes about 1 week for the botox to work after it has been injected.  I get about 30 injections each time_ and the shots really don't hurt bad.  I receive injections in the forehead_ temples_ and neck.  With all the injections I have had_ I was only bruised from two of them_ and the bruise was very tiny.  I have never experienced droopy or swollen eyes like some people complain about.  I think that is probably caused by receiving injections from people that do not know how to properly inject the drug (I get it from my neurologist).  The injections sites are tender for 2 to 3 days after the injections.,F,25,1  years 1X AN,6/28/2010,Botox cosmetic
15, 3, weekly migraines,By day two_ had pain at every injection site (about 20) over forehead_ and back of neck.  By day four whiplash-like pain_ with an inability to hold head in any position except upright without severe pain.  Eyelids are continuing to droop more each day creating a swollen appearance with slits for eyes.,Some relief from migraine pain at first_ but by day 8 feeling flu-like symptoms and great pressure behind eyes.  Overall aches with ongoing symptoms of whiplash in the neck area.  Have had to take 50 mg of Imitrex on two separate days to relieve migraine brought on by pain in the neck radiating behind eyes. Was told the benefits would reach a peak at 4 weeks.  Hoping these side bad effects diminish.,F,50,8  days200 cc 1X D,5/29/2010,Botox cosmetic
16, 5, To get rid of frown lines btw. eyes,soreness from injection site,This is about the 4th time I've received BOTOX_ it has worked wonders to diminish the frown lines (elevens) between my eyes. It was $240 for 20 units_ but it wears off eventually. If it were free I'd go back every three months! Instead I've been going about every 9 months.,F,39,1  days20 units 1X D,4/26/2010,Botox cosmetic
17, 3, ,Breakouts (fluid filled bumps)on forehead and cheeks lasting (last time anyway) up until the botox was almost worn off.,Didn't have this problem until maybe the 5th or 6th time botox was injested. This last go around has been the worst. Still_ I'm dreading when the botox wears off because I know I'll be too afraid to have it injected again.,F,54,3  years,9/6/2009,Botox cosmetic
18, 1, elimination of frown lines,Started evening of Day 6_ insomnia_ feeling wired_ strange twitching sensation all over body.  Started disepating week 6 and was gone by Wk10 Didn't feel completely normal until Wk 16,I understand it's allure..the results looked great_ but this is a neurotoxin with very frightening results for many people,F,50,4  months,8/30/2009,Botox cosmetic
19, 4, Medicinal purposes,Headache_ pain in the injection site_ flu-like symptoms_ usually the first week after the injections.,I've been getting injections of non-cosmetic Botox for 4 yrs andI really don't have anything bad to say about it. When I first started to get the injections they didn't work as well. My doctor told me I had to get several rounds of Botox_ before I would feel and/or see any kind of difference. Finally after two years_ I felt a difference in my neck. I need the Botox b/c I have Cervical Dystonia_ and it is the treatment for this horrible disorder_ which can be compared to Parkinson's Disease.Yes_ I may need Botox for the rest of my life_ but it's better than living with pain and agony in my neck. Good luck to anyone who takes Botox for medicinal purposes_ as that's why it was invented in the first place! The only thing I have to worry about is developing an immunity to it_ and not being able to getany pain relief.,F,45,4  years,8/17/2009,Botox cosmetic
20, 1, cosmetic purposes,Severly hooded brow and eyelids to the point I look like like a caveman_ frozen forehead_jitters_ headache_ rash_ memory problems_ dilated pupils_ exacerbated my rosacea and period cramps and bleeding.,Each day another bad side effect appears.  And I went to a renowned top doctor in Westport_ CT who took part in the Allergan testing and has been doing it for years. I would never subject myself to this poison again.  The side effects are awful and I have to wear glasses everywhere I go to disguise my hooded eyes.  I'm having nightmares and am stressed out beyond belief.,F,42,6  days,2/24/2009,Botox cosmetic
