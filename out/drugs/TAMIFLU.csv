9, 1, FLU,I felt so 'off' Confused_ Dizzy_ even now 2 days after I stopped taking it_ my scalp is still 'crawling'. My eyelids feel like theyre sunburned. I had to stop taking the medicine on day 3. I couldnt do it anymore_ I felt worse on it.,As my first and last time taking Tamiflu_ I would never recommend this medication to anyone.,F,37,3  days30 2X D,4/11/2016Email,Tamiflu
10, 1, Flu,Worst nausea and vomiting of my life. Got worse with each dose taken. I did not have nausea with flu_ only as side effect. Episodes of diarrhea with Tamiflu. No appetite. Funny taste in mouth. Do not take and would not give to family_ especially children.,Too many bad side effects. Should be reevaluated by FDA. Taking Tamiflu made me sicker longer than the flu.,F,60,3  days,4/8/2016,Tamiflu

12, 4, bad respiratory infection,I did have some vomitting_ only with meats etc. When I ate soup I didn't have a problem. My doctor told me to start it at night...I don't know why so many preferred to start it in the morning. Anytime you are on a new medication_ it is best you take it at night when your body will be resting_ so that it actually has an opportunity to work properly,I would recommend,F,41,4  days75mg,3/24/2016,Tamiflu
13, 1, diagnosed w/influenza A,nausea_ dizziness_ severe diarrhea,I dumped out most of the first capsule I took because I tend to have bad reactions to medicines.  A half hour after taking the partial capsule with some jello_ I began to feel nauseated.  Zofran helped settle my stomach_ but then overnight I developed severe diarrhea.  The irony is they tell you to take the medicine with food_ yet when you have the flu_ you have no appetite.  I'm glad I didn't take the second dose of this if that's what one half capsule did to me.  I won't be taking it ever again and would not recommend it to anyone.,F,45,5  days75 mg 2X D,3/24/2016,Tamiflu
14, 4, I have the seasonal flu.,Ran my fever up_ got chills.,This medicine isn't as horrible as everyone makes it out to be. It did raise my fever and made me feel a little uncomfortable_ but other than that_ it's lessened the symptoms. I haven't experienced any vomiting or anything (thankfully)_ and I am on the path to getting better. It can sometimes make you feel worse than the actual flu_ but you get over that grogginess rather quickly. I recommend it.,M,17,3  days75 MG,3/23/2016,Tamiflu

16, 1, Flu,I took the test and was confirmed that I had the flu....10 pills to the pack.  I was dizzy and nauseated...feeling yucky...so I could contributed the symptoms to the flu.  After taking the 5th pill.  I was sleeping....and suddenly stopped breathing...that will wake you up quickly...I tried and tried to breathe...trying not to panic....finally after telling myself subconsciously to breathe...I started choking....and started to breathe.  I waited about five minutes making sure I would continue to breathe... Jumped out of bed and ran to my husband telling him I almost died.  He and I agreed that we would never take this drug again.,Dangerous.....I found out that shortness of breath was a RARE side effect.,F,65,2  days,3/19/2016,Tamiflu
17, 1, Flu,I had the worst experience with tamiflu - my dr took me off it after explaining such horrible side effects. I wish I just stuck out the flu without the continuing effects after being off of tamiflu for over 2 days now.,,F,28,2  days75,3/19/2016,Tamiflu

21, 1, Flu type a diagnosis,First dose was taken at 11 am. By 5 I was vomiting(hadn't previously). Assumed that was a flu symptom. I have spent most of the second day on it vomiting repeatedly. I have blown the blood vessels in my eyes and have a black eye and my ribs hurt to breathe. My daughter_13_ was also on Tamiflu and is throwing up 7 days after being diagnosed with flu. I wish I researched sooner but I felt so bad. I spent 280 for both of our Rx's which is almost half my paycheck. I am outraged dr pushed this on us,Sucks!,F,39,2  days75mg,3/14/2016,Tamiflu

23, 1, Diagnosed with Influenza A,My 13-year old daughter tested positive for Influenza A this past Wednesday and was started on Tamiflu immediately.  Other than some nausea and vomiting the first day_ she is now on day 5 and doing much better.  I became symptomatic two days after she did and was also put on Tamiflu immediately_ well within the recommended 48-hour window.  I did not react to it as well as she did. I am unbelievably uncomfortable and restless.  I have blurry vision_ heart palpitations_  severe nausea and vomiting_ diarrhea_ and I have not slept a single wink in two days.  Although my body is exhausted_ sleep completely eludes me.  My fever has gone up instead of down_ and I am so parched from dehydration that no amount of fluid intake quenches it.  I suppose it is because I don't keep anything down long enough for it to help.  I am going to ask my husband to take me in so I can get fluids and hopefully some anti-nausea meds.  I am discontinuing the Tamiflu immediately and keeping my fingers crossed these symptoms subside quickly so I can get some rest.,,F,43,2  days75 MG,3/13/2016Email,Tamiflu
24, 3, Flu,Severe diarrhea_ gas_ and abdominal cramps for 3 days. On the last day my daughter's diarrhea was yellow and her cramps were so painful she couldn't sleep at all. I decided to discontinue her medication since I couldn't get a hold of her prediatritian. Only followed 3 days out of the 5 day treatment.,The medication was effective to treat her flu symptoms. After the first dose she was already feeling well. However_ the medication's gastrointestinal side effects were far too severe.,F,13,3  days,3/12/2016Email,Tamiflu

Although after the second dose I felt a little better I suffered from severe headaches loss of appitite strange feeling all over like a weight was put on my chest and my tounge was too big for my mouth.

26, 1, Flu,I noticed in a couple of hours of my  3rd dose I felt so nauseous which I had not felt prior to taking.  I noticed my vision was off a bit and that I was wide awake in the middle of the night. My taste buds seem off and things smelled strange to me. I wouldn't recommend this medication to anyone and the cost is obnoxious.,,,45,2  days75MG 2X D,3/11/2016,Tamiflu

At first we thought it was the fever making him act strange but then the temperature went away and he kept talking mumbling as if he didnt know how to talk. He wasn't making sense. Also he would get upset for no reason and punch the floor then cry cause he hurt himself. He had never acted like this before. He kept waking up with night terrors screaming and being afraid of us. He also would scream holding his stomach in pain and pooping himself. It is awful!! Is like my child is possesed. I haye to see him like this. Would never give him this meds again.,M,3,2  days7.5ml susp,3/11/2016,Tamiflu

38, 1, Preventive/kids exposed to flu,,My kids were exposed to the flu and were prescribed liquid Tamiflu as a preventive measure. I was able to reason with my 5 year old to get her to take it but my 2 year old was having none of it. I tasted it myself to see what the issue was. It really is disgusting.

50, 1, For the flu,I gave tamiflu to my son at 8:30 pm and his fever went down by morning. Gave him his 2nd dose at 9 am and he starting acting funny. I gave him his 3rd dose at 9:30 pm but he didn't want it_ so he only got 1/2 the dose and thank god for that because he starting getting a rash and had problems breathing_ so who knows what would have happened if he got another dose. I was really skeptical about giving him this in the first place and for good reason. Trust your gut feeling on this medication because it definitely can cause side effects that may not be controllable and scared me to see. I will never use it again!,Worst part is I paid to see my son have side effects and worry all night. And I will never recommend this to anyone.,M,7,2  days,2/14/2016Email,Tamiflu
