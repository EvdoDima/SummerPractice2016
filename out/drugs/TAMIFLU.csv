10, 1, Flu,Worst nausea and vomiting of my life. Got worse with each dose taken. I did not have nausea with flu_ only as side effect. Episodes of diarrhea with Tamiflu. No appetite. Funny taste in mouth. Do not take and would not give to family_ especially children.,Too many bad side effects. Should be reevaluated by FDA. Taking Tamiflu made me sicker longer than the flu.,F,60,3  days,4/8/2016,Tamiflu

12, 4, bad respiratory infection,I did have some vomitting_ only with meats etc. When I ate soup I didn't have a problem. My doctor told me to start it at night...I don't know why so many preferred to start it in the morning. Anytime you are on a new medication_ it is best you take it at night when your body will be resting_ so that it actually has an opportunity to work properly,I would recommend,F,41,4  days75mg,3/24/2016,Tamiflu
13, 1, diagnosed w/influenza A,nausea_ dizziness_ severe diarrhea,I dumped out most of the first capsule I took because I tend to have bad reactions to medicines.  A half hour after taking the partial capsule with some jello_ I began to feel nauseated.  Zofran helped settle my stomach_ but then overnight I developed severe diarrhea.  The irony is they tell you to take the medicine with food_ yet when you have the flu_ you have no appetite.  I'm glad I didn't take the second dose of this if that's what one half capsule did to me.  I won't be taking it ever again and would not recommend it to anyone.,F,45,5  days75 mg 2X D,3/24/2016,Tamiflu
14, 4, I have the seasonal flu.,Ran my fever up_ got chills.,This medicine isn't as horrible as everyone makes it out to be. It did raise my fever and made me feel a little uncomfortable_ but other than that_ it's lessened the symptoms. I haven't experienced any vomiting or anything (thankfully)_ and I am on the path to getting better. It can sometimes make you feel worse than the actual flu_ but you get over that grogginess rather quickly. I recommend it.,M,17,3  days75 MG,3/23/2016,Tamiflu

After taking the 5th pill.  I was sleeping....and suddenly stopped breathing...that will wake you up quickly...I tried and tried to breathe...trying not to panic....finally after telling myself subconsciously to breathe...I started choking....and started to breathe.  I waited about five minutes making sure I would continue to breathe... Jumped out of bed and ran to my husband telling him I almost died.  He and I agreed that we would never take this drug again.,Dangerous.....I found out that shortness of breath was a RARE side effect.,F,65,2  days,3/19/2016,Tamiflu

21, 1, Flu type a diagnosis,First dose was taken at 11 am. By 5 I was vomiting(hadn't previously). Assumed that was a flu symptom. I have spent most of the second day on it vomiting repeatedly. I have blown the blood vessels in my eyes and have a black eye and my ribs hurt to breathe. My daughter_13_ was also on Tamiflu and is throwing up 7 days after being diagnosed with flu. I wish I researched sooner but I felt so bad. I spent 280 for both of our Rx's which is almost half my paycheck. I am outraged dr pushed this on us,Sucks!,F,39,2  days75mg,3/14/2016,Tamiflu

23, 1, Diagnosed with Influenza A,My 13-year old daughter tested positive for Influenza A this past Wednesday and was started on Tamiflu immediately.  Other than some nausea and vomiting the first day_ she is now on day 5 and doing much better.  I became symptomatic two days after she did and was also put on Tamiflu immediately_ well within the recommended 48-hour window.  I did not react to it as well as she did. I am unbelievably uncomfortable and restless.  I have blurry vision_ heart palpitations_  severe nausea and vomiting_ diarrhea_ and I have not slept a single wink in two days.  Although my body is exhausted_ sleep completely eludes me.  My fever has gone up instead of down_ and I am so parched from dehydration that no amount of fluid intake quenches it.  I suppose it is because I don't keep anything down long enough for it to help.  I am going to ask my husband to take me in so I can get fluids and hopefully some anti-nausea meds.  I am discontinuing the Tamiflu immediately and keeping my fingers crossed these symptoms subside quickly so I can get some rest.,,F,43,2  days75 MG,3/13/2016Email,Tamiflu
24, 3, Flu,Severe diarrhea_ gas_ and abdominal cramps for 3 days. On the last day my daughter's diarrhea was yellow and her cramps were so painful she couldn't sleep at all. I decided to discontinue her medication since I couldn't get a hold of her prediatritian. Only followed 3 days out of the 5 day treatment.,The medication was effective to treat her flu symptoms. After the first dose she was already feeling well. However_ the medication's gastrointestinal side effects were far too severe.,F,13,3  days,3/12/2016Email,Tamiflu

I gave him his 3rd dose at 9:30 pm but he didn't want it_ so he only got 1/2 the dose and thank god for that because he starting getting a rash and had problems breathing_ so who knows what would have happened if he got another dose. I was really skeptical about giving him this in the first place and for good reason. Trust your gut feeling on this medication because it definitely can cause side effects that may not be controllable and scared me to see. I will never use it again!,Worst part is I paid to see my son have side effects and worry all night. And I will never recommend this to anyone.,M,7,2  days,2/14/2016Email,Tamiflu

It was on Sunday evening so we had to take my son to the urgent care center.,Day 2 - first dose of tamiflu was given at midnight and straight to bed.  All is well.Day 3 - he woke up and complained of stomachache.  It was alleviated with ginger ale.  After breakfast he vomited.  He received 2nd dose after lunch.  He vomited 1 hr later.  After nap time he had some milk.  He vomited again.  We gave his some pedialyte_ and bit of food.  We stopped giving him tamiflu all together.4th day - he woke up complaining of pain on both his legs.  He walks around on tip-toe.  Which led me to do some research and found this site.His fever is now controllable with tylenol and motrin again.  Stomachache_ vomiting and legs pain are the adverse effect he had.  Thankfully he didn't have any psychological effect.  My son only had 2 doses so I can't say if the tamiflu helped or not.

Was taking Tamiflu after testing positive for B by 9pm.When you discover what the virus does to you and how an antiviral halts it's progression - it seems logical choice.,Would take it again_ Always with food.,F,8,5  days,1/27/2015,Tamiflu

It lasted all night_ by early morning_ he was confused and unable to say words.  Fearing a stroke_ I called 911 and he was taken to the ER.  He tested positive for influenza and his heart went into distress.  He has an ICD and due to the loss of magnesium in his system he was in the cardiac ICU for 5 days.  He is home now_ but still not back on his feet yet.  This all happened during the 3rd week of Dec.  he is on prednisone now for lymphedema.  Poor man.

Had a mild dry cough_ fever_ muscle soreness_ throbbing headache and fatigue. Now on Day 3 of Tamiflu: I don't know if it's because it's 3:40 am and I can't sleep_ but I keep thinking I see something flash by in the corner of my eye.

156, 1, Prevenitive,Several kids in my daughters class had tested positive for flu so when she came home with a fever we started her on it prophylactically. The first night she took it she woke up with hallucinations and screaming uncontrollably. At first I just thought she was sleepwalking but it happened in the second night and she's never done that before. The only correlation could be the Tamiflu. I have never heard her scream uncontrollably and not make sense when she talks...it is truly scary to be woken up with that type of fear from your child.,If you have a child and feel the need to be on Tamiflu I highly recommend sleeping in the same room next to them to monitor their sleep while on this medication. The more research I did confirms that she's not the first to have such explicit nightmares.,F,7,2  days,1/16/2015,Tamiflu

I had hallucinations all night_ not sure if Tamiflu of high temp_ definitely temp will do that. On my third day I got over the high fever by taking a 20 Luke warm bath. I think the water boiled as I sat in it with a 104.8 temp. This was last resort before my wife driving me to ER.

174, 4, to prevent flu,My 6 year old daughter was prescribed this at the ER to prevent the flu. Her flu test was negative but she has had all the symptoms. Ever since she has been so hyper_ mischevious_ and doesn't sleep well at night. She will be unruly and rude in public places which is typical of a 6 year old. I mean she has been like a rabid wild beast. Bouncing on furniture_ whooping her teenage brother_ and running out if vehicle to go in the store to use bathroom before I even turn the car off. I swear I'm gonna go crazy if she doesn't calm down. Lol.  It has helped her illness awesome. And thankfully insurance paid for it_ but my god she needs a padded room or a marathon to run off all this energy. Tonight is her last dose. And tomorrow she goes to school.

I had one bad day of flu on 1/4 when I tested positive - 102 fever_ chills_ aches_ etc.  1/5 I was groggy_ no fever_ had energy_ aches still_ but not severe.  1/6_ I'd go to work if not for warnings to stay away.  Another possible factor: I had the flu shot.  I had to pay $100 out of pocket for the Tamiflu.  I would do it again in a heart beat to hedge my bets. I feel I'm an anomaly.

177, 1, Diagnosed with Influenza A,Severe and constant nausea with some vomiting.  Painful headache and pressure. Broke out in an itchy rash towards on day three of taking tamiflu.,This was pushed on me by a CNP I saw when I came down with the flu. At first the flu was so bad I couldn't really tell any side effects from any particular drug. However_ the last two days of taking tamiflu I felt pretty good as far as my flu symptoms_ that is until I would take the tamiflu. After taking the medicine as directed I would go from feeling okay to feeling terrible again_ often vomiting. My rash was primarily localized to my arms and legs. However I did have some minor patchy redness on my stomach and chest. I was not too concerned as it responded to benadryl_ and I wasn't initially sure if it was the flu or the medication. My physician said to be sure to take the full course of the drug so I was hesitant to stop taking it midway through. I had the flu really bad and didn't want to tempt the fates. However_ looking back if I could have changed anything I would have stopped taking it as soon as I noticed any adverse effects. I recommend being very cautious with the medication and listen to your body!,F,24,5  days75MG 2X D,1/4/2015,Tamiflu

Plus_ at 55 years old_ I had never had flu.  I was up and about the day after the first 2 pills. I did not take the last dose hoping my head would clear so I would be myself for Christmas.

But I was so bad that I went to the doctor a day and a half after coming down with flu symptoms. Flu test was positive.   So far_ I have taken 5 of the 10 (twice a day) doses of TAMIFLU.   The first day I didn't see any difference.  The second day....huge difference.  It really did help me get over the flu quickly - good since it was only a few days before Christmas.  However_ soon after starting TAMIFLU_ I got a HUGE hive on my chest_ like 6x4""!  Hive also swollen and hot and quite painful.  I couldn't figure it out until I read the side-effects of TAMIFLU and saw that hives or other skin reactions were one of the most common problems. I also was wide awake at midnight and during the day felt jittery. I stopped taking the drug since I am MUCH better in that regard.

I read so many negative things about Tamiflu that I almost didn't take it. It has worked wonderfully for me.

199, 1, Preventative,Nausea_ vomiting_ fever_ chills,I was positive for flu and my daughter was placed on preventative dosage.  Flu has been in the house 3-4 days and she was fine.  Her immune system was working (we all had the vaccine).  She took a dose and got queasy and fever and chills.  Next morning_ she took a second dose.  Threw up and that continued for hours.  Doc said to work through it and the symptoms should be gone next day (or go to ER if not).  The drug was far worse than the disease_ so we stopped it and within 12 hours_ she was back to find and has been ever since.  AVOID THIS AS A PREVENTATIVE.

201, 4, Influenza A,Gave daughter only 1 dose of Tamiflu after she had flu symptoms for about 15 hours. She improved after 6 hours and woke up cheerful the next morning and said she was almost all better. I decided that was good enough for me!,I decided not to continue the full dosage recommendation due to the side effects I read about and heard from other people. The main goal of Tamiflu is to reduce the replication of the virus in the body. Since my daughter felt much better_ it told me that it did just that so why would I keep giving her medicine that everyone says is toxic after 3-4 doses?!,F,9,1  days8 mg 1X D,12/23/2014,Tamiflu

It's now 3 weeks later and my son still has lingering hives as if he is allergic to something. We are taking him for allergy testing to find out what could be causing these mystery hives but he has never ever been allergic to ANYTHING before this. We have a dog_ he eats all types of food and not once in his two years of existence has he ever had a reaction to anything_ let alone a crazy reaction days after taking Tamiflu. I have to say that he was also on amoxicillian while taking tamiflu due to a double ear infection_ so maybe it was a combination of the two_ but he has never reacted to amoxicillian before. - the allergist says he is ""dermograhic"" which basically is a skin disorder where he hives up from scratching himself or touching his skin!! He has never been like this! Ever!! And I know 2 other people who had similar reactions to tamiflu and some pediatricians won't even prescribe tamiflu to a 2 year old!!! I'm so upset over this!!

I was not happy about starting it as I had read of all the side effects_ but her fever was really high. The medicine made her want to vomit_ but she kept it down. That night she kept springing up_ wanting to get out of bed...almost driven like a motor. She would shout out a few things_ and then I would settle her back down. The next morning her fever was down to around 100-101 which was great_ however_ when she tried to get out of bed she cried because of leg soreness in her calves. This lasted all day...she just crawled everywhere. I did not continue the medication. I am hopeful that the leg pain will be gone today when she wakes up.My son_ 15_  is on a preventative does as he was leaving on a trip the next morning.

Then on Tuesday night_ my fever spiked to 101. That was after 2 full does of the Zpac. I went back to the doctor on Wednesday because I felt like I had been hit by a Mack truck! I had all of the classic flu symptoms. Fever_ aches_ fatigue_ cough. So she tested me and it was negative. She said that they are getting a lot of false negatives. She said that I did have the flu and gave me tamiflu. I took the first 2 doses on Wednesday and then Thursday morning my fever had broke. I took my 1st dose of the day that morning. Throughout the day_ I felt itchy but wrote it off because of my job. I took my 2 dose of the day that night about 2-3 hours before bed. When I went to bed_ I got so hot and red. I wrote it off as still part of the flu. Then I woke up at midnight with a pretty nasty rash! I took some benadryl and went back to bed.,How long does this last? I will not take this ever again! I will also make sure I get the flu shot next year! This is HORRIBLE!!!!!! If I could give it a lower rating_ I would have!

After the third dose_  I noticed insomnia and a yellow hue and halo to my vision.  Finally_ after having been awake for 18 hours with no rest_ I dozed off for a few minutes only to have the worst nightmare.  It was like an out of body experience where I was watching an unseen force kill me.  I was consciously aware it was a dream where I forced myself to wake up.

Even worse_ he told me he wanted to kill himself and thought about dying!!! Imagine my shock_ dismay_ heartbreak!! After researching Tamiflu I discovered this is actually a side effect in children and teens. Japan actually banned the drug because of so many patients committing suicide while on the drug. My son is normally the happiest_ most joyful child. Idont know how long his symptoms of depression will last. Prayer and trust in God is our only answer.,,M,6,4  days,1/30/2014,Tamiflu

Normally within a few minutes of laying down_ I fall asleep. Not now with the Tamiflu keeping me awake. Also feeling bloated and really gassy. Some loss of appetite. Food and drinks have lost some of their taste. The only good thing is that my cough is gone.The insomnia is the biggest surprise related to this drug. This was my first time to take Tamiflu and it will be my last. Not being able to get some good deep sleep has left me feeling zombie-like. Brain is kinda slow and not quite as sharp as usual.

He prescribed me Tamiflu and the only side effects I was told by the pharmacist was it could cause nausea and vomiting.I think the pills totally wiped out my immune system. I had a rash on my ankles_ wrist_ and lower back_ my ear piercing became infected_ and I got a huge infected pore on my face. All is well and all is healed but I think my body could have fought the flu on it's own. I am mad at my doctor for prescribing me such a strong medicine when I am a healthy 33 year old woman who eats healthy and is physically fit.I have been over the flu for a week and I still feel exhausted. I hope those pills haven't ruined me as I naturally have a strong immune system and this was the first time in about a decade I have had the flu.I am going to continue avoiding the flu shot and if I ever get the flu again I will NOT be taking Tamiflu.I will let my body fight it naturally. There are too many medicines out there and we have become to reliant on them. It's all for the money. Exactly why they won't give us the cure they have for cancer.

Doctor said it was a rare reaction (9% of people get it) and to wait 72 hours for the drug to exit my system.  He prescribed Xanax to relieve the anxiety and to help me sleep.  The relief from the anxiety was almost immediate after xanax and my appetite returned about 3 days after my last dose of Tamiflu.

If you don't know anything about DP_ look it up - it might be what you're experiencing if you're still not feeling ""normal"" after stopping the Tamiflu. Wikipedia states it is a classic withdrawl symptom from many drugs.  It can be reversed through proper diet_ exercise_ and vitamin supplementation to correct the chemical imbalance. Tamiflu has definitely left residual effects - not quite as scary_ but tolerable.  I will NEVER take it again - I'd rather endure the flu!  msceleste2@hotmail.co",F,37,2  days75 mg 2X D,4/4/2013Email,Tamiflu

316, 1, Influenza B,Initially nausea_ vomiting and diarrhea.  Then stomach pains and cramps_ then alternating diarrhea and constipation_ my intestinal track hasn't worked right since.  I took the Tamiflu the week before Christmas and here we are the end of March and I am still having the bowel problems.  I have been having bleeding_ servere stomach cramps with bouts of alternating diarrhea and constipation_ unable to control my bowels.  I didn't have these problems prior to taking Tamiflu so it must have caused this.

317, 1, Flu Symptoms,Nausea and abnormal psychiatric behavior_ irritable_ restless and very aggressive.,"My son would become nauseated within about an hour of taking Tamiflu_ he vomited once after the first and second dose.  If he ate something before taking Tamiflu the nausea was lessened.  He lost his appetite while on Tamiflu and did not get his full appetite back until at least 36 hours after his last dose.  The most troubling side effects were psychiatric_ the worst manifested at about 36 hours into his Tamiflu treatment.  My son has exhibited very aggressive and combative attitudes to persons around him.  He is physically and verbally aggressive to close family members i.e. yelling_ biting and hair pulling.  He has been off of the medication for over 36 hours and is still exhibiting aggression towards others.  I would not recommend Tamiflu.  I'm actually disappointed with the manufacturer and the FDA for their lack of judgement about how they prescribe the drug and the lack of communication about the side effects.  The question my wife and I have now is how long the side effects will last?  We can only hope it subsides very soon.  I'll end with a few more notes I've found while researching Tamiflu -  ""Japan bans Tamiflu for teenagers""_ ""Masato Tashiro_ head of flu at Japan's National Institute of Infectious said My personal concern is that Tamiflu might invade the brain through the blood-brain barrier.""_ ""The manufacturer of Tamiflu said experiments in mice showed it depressed brain activity and caused death in animals too young to have a fully-for",M,8,3  days10ml 2X D,3/17/2013Email,Tamiflu
318, 3, Flu,GERD/acid reflux symptoms within 30 mins. of taking medication_ nausea_ dizziness_ loopy_ leg pains primarily in the knees,I've had the flu 2 years in a row. Last year I did not take Tamiflu and this year I did. I started taking it about 1 1/2 days after getting a sore throat and fever. Although my fever and body aches did go away faster with the Tamiflu_ the nausea_ reflux and dizziness were draining. I've also had difficulty sleeping which is counter-productive since rest is so necessary when fighting the flu. I've stopped it for now and likely will not take it again. I rather treat the fever_ chills and aches with ibuprofen and Tylenol. My 5 year old daughter also took it and had nausea and vomiting within the hour of each dose and had to be given Zofran.

319, 1, Tested positive for Flu,My daughter had a slight fever and runny nose. Her dr. tested for the flu and prescribed tamiflu since it was the first 24 hrs. After her first dose she became a different child.. Having hallucinations_ night terrors_ jittery and couldn't sit still. I contacted her dr. and brought her back to the office and was told those were flu symptoms and to keep her on the meds!! After 2 more doses she was out of control crying for no reason throwing tantrums.. And having no personality with a  blank slate face when she wasn't crying. Also complained of her head hurting and would cry about it. My poor love .. I felt horrible as if I failed as a parent for putting her through such torture.

Once he got it out of his system he was fine and out of bed for a bit_ talking_ laughing_ etc. I had to have the doctor call in a prescription for Zofran so he could keep the Motrin and Tylenol down.

I couldn't tell if it helped me or not bc I felt so nauseated and vomited several times after taking it. My first dose made my flu symptoms a little better at first but immediately after I was puking. And I almost had to pay a fortune to get it in the first place! Thank god I didn't pay for it. My ob actually had some samples so I ran over there and got some rather than wait at my regular MD. I'd rather not pay to puke. And it keeps me up if I lay down I fell like I'm going to throw up more than if I'm sitting up or doing something. Why on earth would they make a pill for the flu that only makes it worse?!

388, 3, My kids tested positive ages 1 &10,After reading all the reviews on side effects_ especially for children I decided to discontinue use. My one yr old daughter and 10yr old son started tamiflu within 24-48 hrs of symptoms of flu such as high fever and body ache. The ER Dr. Prescribed the drug and did not mention one thing about side effects! I was very nervous for my daughter because she was only 14 mo. Old and with the flu. I knew it would hit her harder than older children so I filled the prescription and started it right away. I will say that after the second day my children felt a little better. The fever went down_ the body ache was less intense_ and headache was gone in my 10yr old. My daughter also looked like she felt better because she started walking around the house again and her fever was less frequent as well. The drug seems to be working okay_ however there are some side effects that are present in my kids that I read on here. My daughters heartbeat was racing at what felt like 200 beats per minute last night. I almost took her back to ER but_ I decided that high fever does that and at that time she did have a high fever 102. Now I know it prob had something to do with drug. Needless to say I did not sleep a wink because I was so nervous and stressed out about her. symptoms.  On top of the rapid heartbeat she was very wakeful while on this medicine. She would wake by jerking moving_ or twitching every 5 min. Which I now know is prob due to nightmares which I read is another side effect of tamiflu.,,,1,2  days5ml,11/12/2012,Tamiflu

If you are considering taking this_ DON'T. The symptoms are still here and still occur every so often. I was so anxious I couldn't leave the house or go to school.

I was dizzy and that set off a panic attack where I had to breathe into a paper bag. Probably dizzy bc I had severe diarrhea. After everything I ate or drank I had to RUN to the bathroom.  I am not taking the 6th dose tonight. I think I would have ratcheted tough out flu symptoms than have a severe panic attack or feel like I'm getting a colonoscopy prep. I'd never take it again.

392, 1, Influenza type b,Within two hours of taking the first dose_ I began vomiting uncontrollably and that continued for about 5 hours.  I couldn't keep anything down.  I attributed that initially to the flu.  However_ after the 2nd and 3rd doses produced the same results_ I went back to the doctor who told me to stop taking the tamiflu.  He gave me a shot to try to calm my nausea and vomiting.  No more vomiting after that last dose got out of my system_ but for several days_ I have been feeling strange sensations that feel like my skin is trying to come off my body_ just odd and uncomfortable_ like jitters and nerves.   I also have an egg allergy so couldn't take the flu shot.,Two family members took this at the same time as I did and neither of them had the same reaction so I am not sure why I did.  The only thing I can think of is that because I have a slight egg allergy_ something in this medication reacted to that_ but I will never take it again.,F,58,2  days30 2X D,7/25/2012,Tamiflu

This is not the worst side effect of it - from day one - I have been experiencing horrible stomach pains. These stomach pains are like no other - they feel like the inside of my stomach is on fire_ that I'm going to explode_ like there are a million needles going through my insides. It has caused me to lose my appetite and the pain killers are not helping me. Last night_ I could not stop vomiting - I vomited everything ... I couldn't keep anything down.

Took the second dose last night and within 10 mins felt some stomach pains but was able to quickly fall asleep. I was woken up 2 hours later because of SERIOUS stomach pains that almost brought me to vomiting. I didn't eat with the second dose and thought that might be why I was feeling the way that I was. I didn't sleep the rest of the night and had horrible sweating on and off_ yet had no fever! I decided to take another dose this morning WITH food_ and have been in agony all day. It literally feels as though there is a rock in my stomach. On top of the pains_ I've had waves of odd feelings rush over me ranging from depression and anxiety to actually tearing up watching a South Park episode! I have no flu symptoms at all_ and am house ridden now because of this disgusting drug. It should be banned. I will not take another dose and DO NOT recommend it to ANYONE. The joke of this drug is that it only SHORTENS the length of the flu by a small amount (0.5-1.0 days). Whether you have side effects or not_ it is obviously a serious substance and isn't worth putting into your body period.

I took one pill at noon and the next one 12 hours later. Sunday morning I noticed red bumps pop up on my hands_ wrists_ and forearms. I dismissed them thinking they were bed bug bites or flea bites from my new dog. I took the pill as usual at around 11:00am. By the afternoon these bumps began to itch severely_ and by the evening my chest and my whole upper body seemed irritated with some kind of rash. I stupidly took the next dose (now the 4th pill_ second day dose) and within hours my whole body exploded in hives. I stopped immediately and have been told my doctor to take Benadryl. Within 24 hours of stopping the Tamiflu treatment my hives have slightly decreased in redness and some spots have faded_ along with some of the itchiness_ and its somewhat stopped spreading.

Great. So the doc prescribes tamiflu. Told me it would shorten the time of the flu. I took the first one and two hours later I was hugging the toilet but that was the only time that day. I took another that night and one more the next day. Again about two hours after taking it I was vomitting. Thinking it was like the day before it would happen once and I would be fine. WRONG! About an hour after I threw up again then about every ten to fifteen minutes I was vomitting. I was miserable! That was yesterday. I didn't take the other dose last night. I still have the flu but hopefully the throwing up is over bc I won't be taking anymore tamiflu. Besides the horrible vomitting I haven't slept more than three hours a night since taking this medicine and I feel like my heart is racing sometimes. In edgy.

426, 1, Prescribed by doc for flu,"Hellish headache_ nausea_ vomiting_ sinuses feel ""burned out"" and nothing smells the way it should",Short of having swine flu_ I would never use this med again.  My doc prescribed it because I had flu symptoms less than 2 days.  She thought it would help_ but next day nausea and vomiting started.  Then I got a persistant_ MASSIVE headache (not good_ as I already suffer from frequent cluster headaches).  I won't be taking another dose.  It's just not worth it just to knock a couple days off the course of the flu.,F,50,4  days75mg 2X D,1/14/2012Email,Tamiflu
427, 3, possible flu,I was pretty miserable when I was prescribed Tamiflu and the Z pack.  I felt bad Tues night_ went to Dr the Dr on Wed.  By then I had chills_ body aches_ chest hurt_ eyes hurt_ head was killing me_ ears hurt_ couldn't breath_ fever_ and could not move!  I started taking the meds that night.  Today (Sat) is the first day I was able to get out if bed.  I couldn't say if Tamiflu would be the reason I felt so bad it not?  I will say the headaches were worse and I did notice more irrational behaviors (temper quick to surface).  But everything I've read say the flu itself will bring those on too.  I haven't seen any other updates in the last two months about this drug_ so I thought I'd put mine in.,,F,33,6  days75Mg,1/8/2012Email,Tamiflu

429, 1, H1N1,I share a similar experience to the person below me. Since taking the Tamiflu I have had 24/7 migraines for the past 2 years. I took the Tamiflu 2 years ago (age 13) when a doctor diagnosed me as having the H1N1 although a swab was never done to confirm this. Light sensitivity_ seeing flashes/stars and noise sensitivity are just a few things that came bundled with my headaches. The vision problems have been steadily worsening_ I just came back from an eye test and my eyes were perfect_ so it must be neurological. I have seen several doctors and am now regularly seeing a neurologist. I've had an MRI_ CT scan as well as a number of bloodtests and so far they can't find anything wrong. Only two things significantly reduce the pain of my migraines_ one being marijuana and the other being botox injections around the base of my skull. The Botox injections are by far the most effective_ but these can only be done once every 3 months and are not covered by Canada's health care (of course). Oth,Don't take it. The risks far outweigh the benefits_ trust me.,M,15,7  days 2X D,11/21/2011Email,Tamiflu
430, 1, 12-year child for diagnosed H1N1,In the past 2 years since Tamiflu_ my (now 14-year old) has had complex partial seizures_ sleep disturbances_ attention problems_ short term memory deficits_ mood swings_ irritability_ is failing in high school_ and has numerous falls.  A complete neurological evaluation was inconclusive.  She is soon to have a sleep study.  Exhibits signs of narcolepsy.  Has also had hallucinations and cataplexy attacks.  This occurred only since Tamiflu and has continued the past two years.  I am a neuroscientist and pharmacist and my observations are not hyperbolic.,I would never ever recommend anyone taking this medication_ especially children or teenagers.  The side effects can be delayed after the flu and it was some time before I realized all these neuropsychological problems began occurring following Tamiflu.  These are gradual and subtle and many parents may not realize why they suddenly have a teenager exhibiting strange neurological and psychological symptoms.,F,14,5  days75mg 2X D,10/31/2011,Tamiflu

She would scream a frightening paranoid scream all through the night and she would pound her head into the walls. It took us almost a 9 months for her to return to normal. This DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED. Do your research. In Japan_ the drug is banned in children under 16 for the same reasons.

Strange dreams.,I had a nasal swab and tested positive for influenza type A. I took Tamilflu for 5 days. I felt better by the second day and was much relieved because I felt like I was hit by a truck on the first day.However I have been having strange thoughts vivid bizarre dreams. It has been 2 weeks now and I don't feel like myself. Two family members got the flu too and took this medicine and they are saying they have similar symptoms. Makes me feel edgy too. Lack of energy. I am very worried that these symptoms are permanent like it has changed my brain. I would not have taken this medication had I known I would have dealt with my flu  symptons. Tamiflu did help me get over the flu_ but two weeks later I still feel odd.

He was also hitting his sister for no reason. He developed a rash. My 6 year old daughter was sleep walking. She was taking the meds to prevent getting the flu so there is no other reason for her to sleep walk. My face is tingling and getting puffy. I was catching myself feeling very angry at people for doing things like waking me from a nap. I had trouble sleeping. One night I only got 2 hours sleep and was able to go all day without feeling like I needed more. Which isnt normal for me.

Nausea turned to vomiting. These symptoms lasted for about 24 hours. Also experienced heart fluttering and palpitations and racing heartbeat and dry mouth. Once those initial symptoms subsided_ felt better. Since I had not taken another dose while experiencing nausea/vomiting_ re-started the Tamiflu and felt fine - until I awoke with heart palpitations/fluttering/racing again_ along with severe dry mouth_ wracking cough and light headedness.

I have had some sleep disturbance but I am sick and drove 1300 miles home from Florida with the flu. My wife has worse problems sleeping than I do and has the same level of nausea. No vomiting. Diarrhea nothing new to me as I have celiac dz and this may account for it but I don't think that is all of it. As far as emotional and hallucinations we have not had any that though both were edgy on ride back from Florida with my parents and 6 year old twins. We all survived (heh heh),I saw patients with the flu the week before going to Florida on a road trip. I was concerned as the flu shot has not seemed to help with this one. Half way through trip (in Disney World) felt REAL BAD. Had to go to first aid there and slept 2 hours. This is NOT me. I will bulldoze through ANY cold (even pneumonia). I was out of it and it was not a good thing as we had to drive back home in 3 days with my parents_ my wife and 2 6yr old boys. Had no choice but start tamiflu. 2 hours after first dose sat up in bed turned on TV (not something tolerated as light even bothered me before that) and then felt alot better and could drink (very concerned about dehydration at the time). That evening took second dose and was up walking and making sense (people in party relieved) and then 2 days later drove (over 2 days) 1300 miles home and feel ready for work tomorrow.

Normally sleeps 9.5 to 10 hours without problem.  Been 4 days off Tamiflu and still having problems sleeping.  He also experienced fearful and death thoughts such as worrying about parents dying.  Also verbalized feeling like he sees people in his bedroom.  The package insert describes in detail neurological and behavioral side effects_ as well as post market behavioral side effects which I read after my son experienced similar events.  Suicide is also listed as a side effect in a small number of children in Japan attributable to Tamiflu.  If I read the package insert or was informed by the P.A. whom prescribed this med_ I would NOT have given it.  BE CAREFUL WITH TAMIFLU_ question the doctor_ and avoid it if possible.

479, 2, Flu,Restlessness_racing thoughts while trying to sleep. I had trouble going to sleep which made me stay up for over 18hrs. When I did get to sleep it would only be for an hour then my eyes would pop back open. Nausea and diarrhea. Gnawing feeling in stomach.,I was diagnosed with the flu on a Friday and by Sunday I was feeling better and wanted to continue to take the medicine believing it was in my good favor since you suppose to take it until it's gone.  However_ that's when the restlessness_ more noticeable nausea_ and diarrhea started.  My stomach is still not right and I've been sipping on ginger ale all weekend.  I stopped taking this medicine today because my flu symptoms are gone and taking the rest of the meds will do more harm in my opinion.  I don't know if Tamiflu helped me get over the flu faster then normal or not but I can attest that if you feel better stop taking it.  Also it advises to take with food - that's a joke.  I ate food with every dosing and still had the stomach issues. This medicine is too expensive to have people dealing with all these issues and not get the full benefits as claimed from the medication.  It's upsetting to say the least.,F,30,3.5  days75 mg 2X D,2/7/2011,Tamiflu

481, 1, flu b,Gave one dose to my 10 year old son after diagnosis with in 28 hours of first symptom of headache.  It made him very sick with vomiting about 20 minutes after taking.  He continued with the nausea for about 6 hours.  I started researching this drug and decided not to give him anymore.  He is feeling better with the over the counter meds.  Since taking the Tamiflu he has not been able to sleep_ and it has been about 18 hours since taking the only dose and he has slept about 4 hours where he normally sleeps 10. He is tired but he just can not fall asleep.,I think that the over the counter meds have worked better at making my son comfortable and for the end result of having the flu end possibly 1.5 days earlier_ I think we will choose not vomiting for 5 days and suffer the flu one extra day.,F,43,5  days60mg oral 2X D,2/6/2011,Tamiflu

Called in sick on Wednesday...but by that evening....I knew it was something else. I checked into the ER at about 9pm Wed...got diagnosed with Influenza A...got prescribed Tamiflu.  Took my first dose Thursday at noon...by then I had already been in bed for about 36 hrs straight.  After my first dose...the nausea kicked in...bad.  I threw up almost 30 mins after taking it...and after that it didnt stop.  That entire day I was dry heaving...nothing in my stomach to throw up so it was just me in the toliet attempting to throw up.  At one point I think i threw up some stomach fluid (bright yellow nasty tasting stuff)...that scared me.  I was also taking ibprofin for the pain which I guess helped my muscle aches.  That first night I kept my husband up all night long.  I must have turned around to re-fix my position every 5-7 minutes.  I was extreamly restless and didnt get one wink of sleep that night. I think I finally got to bed at about 6am Friday morning.  About midday when I woke up...all I remembered were the crazy vivid dreams I had.  I mean...I've had weird dreams before but these were way out of the ordinary.  That entire Friday (yesterday) I was crying_ sweating_ paranoid_ I don't know.

Took 4 different kinds of tyneol. Extra strength_ complete_ fever etc. But fever won't go down. So went to see dr and he gave me tamiflu. Originally. Fever won't go away_ dry cough_ painful sore throat_ no runny noise_ no ears blocked.body feels hot n cold the same time.  Day1 minor night sweats that feels good after_ major headache can't sleep well.   Day2 morning fever is gone. Eliminated painful sore throat_ears and nose blocked. Can feel a lot off stuffing in nose but not runny at all_ head heavy_ tired and sleepy. Day2afternoon 2nd dose_ reduced ears n nose blocked but started coughing and u can feel the stuff belongs in ur nose is now in ur throat so u have to try to cough it up often.  Bad headache. But can stay awake longer. Weird taste in mouth coz of the nose stuff went to ur throat. Body temp back to normal. But still not as good of a progress as u expected bcos I slept 48hrs straight almost. Skipped meals due to fatigue. Seems like symptoms get push from one area to another. But it still outweigh the terrible fever and hot N cold body temp at same time before taking tamiflu.

I usually cannot take cold medications because I become extremely agitated/hostile when on them. It is now Friday and I have been on TAMIFLU for 4 days. The flu is pretty much gone but there are side effects from the medicine i believe. My side effects are mild general discomfort (both physical and emotional)_ confusion_ food tastes REALLY salty_ loss of appetite_ mild anxiety and paranoia_ headaches and fatigue. I can say it has been working for me but cannot say if it will work for you. I dont like the side effects but I had bad case of Influenza A and the side effects did not out weight the sickness.

The first two days_ she tolerated it well and her flu symptoms subsided. Fever was gone_ but respiratory symptoms still there. Day three_ she vomited 1-2 hours after the each dose_ did not sleep well_ and was very irritable. Now today (day 4)_ she is still vomiting and has horrible diarrhea_ and is very clingy. She will be fine one minute and the next she will be crying and wanting to be held. It seems that no matter how I hold her or what position she is in_ she is not comfortable. She has also been making a strange smacking sound with her mouth and complaining of joint pain. Her pediatrician did not mention the horrible side effects_ nor did the pharmacist. We left the day after Christmas for a ski trip so I am not able to get a signal to contact her doctor & inquire about side effects & if I should continue giving her the drug.

I found this website and decided not to take it because of all the bad reveiws but I had been with a fever for 3 days and was getting hot and cold. So just before bed I made the decision to take one tablet. This was around 10? I then woke u at around 12 and felt sick and vomited. But I only did once. I then slept through the rest of the night and woke up in the morning with no fever. I would use it again. New Zealand,F,16,2  days75 1X D,8/12/2010,Tamiflu
524, 1, possible/probable flu not H1N1,After the first dose felt a bit better. Subsequent doses caused nausea_ hallucinations_ vivid dreams_ hive breakout_ pains in legs_ inability to control temperature_ sudden sweats_ inability to urinate unless pressing on bladder_ extreme personality changes - angry_ argumentative_ oppositional_ generally unpleasant_ intense headache_ sore spots over head region_ loss of taste sensation_ increased coughing not associated with the flu_lack of interest in anything_ unable to find the right words when speaking_ general confusion,This medication was prescribed by an after hours clinic GP. My guess is they had been overwhelmed by the number of sick people due to the cold snap ( we are in Australia) and as we have a stockpile of this dangerous medication here in our country it is probably best to get rid of it before it is out of date. This experience frightened the life out of our family_ including the patient and we are left wondering why doctors are prescribing this poison. I only wish I had found this website before he began taking it because I am sure that my husband would have elceted to ride out the flu rather than endure the side effects of this medication. It is two weeks since his last dose and only today did my daughter remark that he is almost back to his old self ( personality wise). He is still quite sick as he now has pneumonia and we believe he wouldn't have it if he hadn't taken the Tamiflu because the meds made him so sick he had to lay down and was not able to clear his lungs. He is on the second course of antibiotics and our family doesn't take a lot of drugs without a good reason. MY ADVICE - STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG. APPROACH THE FLU SENSIBLY AND YOU WILL RECOVER MORE QUICKLY AND WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. We just hope all the side effects go away.,M,62,5  days 2X D,7/15/2010Email,Tamiflu

He was sleepy_ but could be from the flu. This medication worked well and I would use it again if I had to. He was also prescribed omnicef for precautions so the side effects could be from that medication. When his flu swab came back positive for swine flu I gave him 2 doses that day of 30 mg. and he was showing sighns of improvement by day two. I read the post on this medication after giving him this medication and was freaked out by what was being said about this drug.

535, 1, H1N1,Strange behavior_ vocal tics_ aggression_ hallucinations,Last November (09) my six year old son was prescribed Tamiflu for possible H1N1 flu. After the first dose_ his fever spiked to 104 and he was very lethargic and refused anything by mouth. By the next morning_ his fever was down and he was feeling better. BUT_ the next day he started acting violent and trying to hurt himself. He also started whispering words to himself. In the following weeks he developed several vocal tics which were severe enough that we couldn't leave the house. We took him to his Pedi_ a neurologist_ and had several tests done. There was no explanation for his odd behavior other than the Tamiflu. Our Pedi told us that it does have neuro-psychotic side effects and that it should eventually go away. It's been almost five months and he still has some residual tics.

575, 1, Suspected H1N1,"My son was perscribed tamiflu because his symptoms were ""textbook"" for swine flu (even though his nasal swab was negative). He seemed to tolerate his first dose well_ but the second and third dose are a COMPLETELY different story. He was up all night vomiting_ dry heaving and having diarrhea. Prior to starting tamiflu he had none of these symptoms. I do not know if the tamiflu offered him any relief from the fever and body aches_ and if it did I would say the new symptoms are harder on him than the fever and cough. My husband and I stopped the tamiflu after the third dose_ and although he still has a fever and cough_ the vomiting and diarrhea are gone. I would not reccomend tamiflu to my worst enemy!!",Our regular pediatrician perscribed tamiflu for my son.,M,3,1.5  days,12/20/2009,Tamiflu

The second day I gave it to her her fever went down pretty well but every day after that she was super cranky and clingy even though I don't think she was that ill anymore. Also she wouldn't eat food very well and she would wake up crying at night_ Not sure if all of this was the tamiflu but it was all out of the ordinary so I think it was.

I had to call the doctor's office back up and the pharmacy and finally was able to get the amoxicillin in liquid form... the tamiflu they said to open the capsule and mix it with applesauce or pudding... now I don't imagine either one of those being easy on a stomach when vomiting is present.

I thought it was because of the flu and my asthma but when it happened the next day about the same time I figured out it was a reaction to the TamiFlu.  I took benedril and went to the doctor.  He gave me a steroid shot and told me to stop taking it.  I stayed on the benedril and threw away the Tamiflu.  I did not experience the swelling the next day.  My throat and chest are just sore and irritated.,I got the tamiflu from my doctor.  I just want others to know throat swelling is a side affect if you are allergic and keep the benedril handy.  I only took one tablet at night for 2 days and the throat swelling happend about 10 the next morning.  I take an allergy pill every night and decided that probably helped the allergic response to the Tamiflu.,F,50,2  days,11/26/2009,Tamiflu

624, 1, Early Flu Symptoms,Took first dose on an empty stomach (not smart with any meds) and within a half hour was violently vomiting. Decided not to take two doses in one day in fear of getting deathly ill.  Felt better after about the first 2 or 3 hours.  Trouble sleeping that night.  Next day decided to try it again with food in my stomach_ same thing_ vomited for a few hours but then felt better.  Again_ decided not to take the recommended two pills a day.  So the next day I decided I would hold off to see how I would feel without it and my chest cold and what not came right back so I took a dose and again_ within about a half hour I was more ill than I had ever been from the flu or even the tamiflu. I would never take this medicine again because it is just too harsh on my body.  It did take my flu symptoms away after the two or three hours of being violently ill.

Went to urgent care that day and was on Tamiflu within 24 hours of first symptoms. Within an hour or two after taking first dose_ I felt a lot better_ but was still vomitting. Doctor also suscribed Zofran and that finally made the vomitting stop. Second day on dose_ I felt a lot better_ just a decrease in appetite. Third day_ some abdominal discomfort and nausea again_ but no vomitting. Fourth day had extreme abdominal discomfort and diarrhea that prevented me from sleeping. The only thing that helped was eating saltines_ even the zofran did not help. It is the worst stomach pain I have ever experienced.,Even with the side effects_ for me it was worth it. The extreme vomitting I had before taking it was worse than the side effects. I could not see my regular OBGYN as the office was designated a well clinic and they would not see me.

It's hard to tell if he was suffering from any other side effects--because he's 2_ never been sick before_ and I don't know what to expect from him ""being sick""--but I would say the nausea & vomiting were the worst of it.

I stopped giving it to him after that dose.  He is still experiencing side effects though... a week later.  He is a lot more sensitive_ crabby_ angry_ and has had more nightmares.  He was put on it because his brother had H1N1 and my 3 year old has asthma.  So_ it was a preventative.  Then I found out that more kids that get the flu shot and have asthma end up in the hospital than those who have asthma that do not get the shot... I know this was the tamiflu and not the flu shot_ but I have to wonder about this too.  Has anyone else experienced these symptoms days after stopping the med?

However_ on the third day of taking Tamiflu_ I started getting very dizzy.  My head was throbbing_ I had a big headache_ and I was feeling so nauseous that I wanted to throw up.  The next day it got worse although I continued taking the medicine.  On the last day_ I called my health provider to see if I could stop taking the medicine.  I could not even tell if I was sick from the flu since I kept feeling the nausea.  Although I did not take the medicine the entire day_ I still felt extremely nauseous.  I feel like I'm on a boat that is floating on a very rocky river.  I'm not sure how long the side effects will last.  I don't really recommend taking this medicine_ but keep in mind it did get rid of my fever almost immediately.

667, 1, flu_ moderate asthma,My ten year old son took it once this past weekend. He had a completely psychotic reaction within ten minutes of taking it. He started ranting and hallucinating and was extremely paranoid. He finally calmed down. Took him to Childrens Hospital in Boston and nurse there said they had been seeing bad psychiatric reactions in the hospital as well. My son was extremely nauseated for several hours later.,My son was prescribed over the phone from urgent care. No warning from nurse or pharmacist.,M,10,1  days,11/9/2009,Tamiflu
668, 5, H1N1,No side effects noticed,5 month old baby diagnosed with H1N1.  Because she is high risk (was very ill when born) we started her on tamiflu immediately.  After two doses her fever broke and she has been feeling better since.  What a relief.  I was TERRIFIED to give it to her ater reding the other side effects people noted but she is prone to pnuemonia so we could not chance letting her already weak body fight the flu alone.,F,0,5  days,11/8/2009,Tamiflu

672, 1, flu symptoms,Me and my 16 month old son were given Tamiflu because we both had flu symptoms. I started my son on it Tuesday night through Saturday. Every night he was up most of the night crying_ and everyday he was not the child that I knew to be mine. He cried and whined all day and wanted me to hold him constantly. Even my sister and parents who believe that my child can do no wrong said they couldn't believe how he was acting. I told his doctor about the change of behaviour_ but she didn't seem to think it was a big deal even though she herself said that he wasn't happy as he was at the begining of the week when she had seen him. It wasn't the flu that caused him to act this way. He had a fever of 104.6 BEFORE starting the Tamiflu and was running around playing happy as always. The week my child was on Tamiflu was the most exausting week of my life. I wish I had reasearched it better before giving it to him. Once I got on the Tamiflu website and saw the side affect of behavior change I stopped,My OBGYN called in the perscription over the phone. And my son's pediatrition gave us the prescription for him.,F,31,3  days,11/8/2009,Tamiflu

674, 1, flu symptoms,Took Tamiflu for 2 days. Stopped yesterday. Dizzy the entire time. Tonight_ I am experiencing sudden numbness on my right side of face with sudden onset of delerium_ anxiety and generall feelng of lack of control. Hives on neck first day of dose. These horrible symptoms (taking no other medicines and tested negative for flu)are what made me google for side effect and I came upon this website.  Terrible headache and chest pain landed me in the ER 24 hours after taking Tamiflu. The ER visit and the tests they gave me (cardiac markers & flu) all showed negative.  Basically_ I think I had a cold and the Dr prescribing Tamifly was over zealous in prescribing same.  I would not take Tamiflu again. I'm fearful how long these side effects will last now that I have stopped taking it.,,F,46,2  days,11/8/2009,Tamiflu

I have noticed my 4year old daughter being more aggressive than usual.  She is usually quite sweet and sensitive_ now she responds us with anger.  She elbows me and pushes me if i am in her way.  When I talk to her about it she cries and needs holding_ but then returns to same agressive behaviour.  My husband finished his tamiflu one day ago and he is not sleeping.  He is coughing so much_ but that is from h1n1.  I finished my tamiflu first_ about two days ago.  My nightmare was so scarry I still can't shake the thoughts of it.

She felt relief immediately_ which ran out about 3-4 hrs prior to her next dose_ but again immed improvement until just before her next dose. I DID GET THE SCRIPT FILLED AND INTO HER WITHIN 8 HOURS OF THE ONSET OF HER FLU. Apparently this makes a diff. I did not note her experiencing any of the horrible psych effects I have just read on here. BUT MY PHARMACIST ALSO DID NOT MAKE ANY MENTION OF THEM EITHER!!

684, 1, Diagnosed with Swine Flu,After taking Tamiflu i could not sleep all night. My felt my head was going to burst and i just wanted to run out of my house screaming. When i try to sleep i cannot close my eyes and i see dreadful dreams which i have never seen before. The headaches are never ending and just dont go away.. I sweat a lot and the only positive thing is my temperature has gone down (could have done that with paracetamol i guess). My chest is very tight and my body aches from head to toe and being asthmatic dosent help. As i am kept isolated i do feel scared_ especially at night with all the dreams. I sought advice from a lovely nurse who gave me advice and said that i could stop taking Tamiflu. I dont know what is worse_ the symptoms of Swineflu or the after effetcs of Tamiflu....? I guess i'll have to wait and hope for my recovery from today.. I am used to reading up on thigs before i consume it_ should have done the same with Tamiflu. I wish the best to all those who have been affected. Written on b,My regular doctor gave me Amoxicillin and sent me home.

690, 1, Flu,I am posting this about my son who took it four years ago and had horrible reactions to it.  He was only 3 at the time_ his flu seemed to be mild but his doctor recommended it anyway.   I stopped after one dose.  He couldn't keep anything down_ he cried NON-STOP and it wasn't from the flu_ he couldn't sleep even though he was exhausted_ he screamed like we were killing him when we tried to pick him up in his sleep.  He was irrational_ aggressive and cried all the next day.  Once the effects of the Tamiflu wore off_ he was fine.  He was still sick_ but not like he had been on the Tamiflu.  He was diagnosed with Swine Flu Sunday and when the Tamiflu was offered_ I immediately turned it down.  I'm using Elderberry_ Vitamin C_ Zinc and OTC meds. to treat him this go round and his illness has been mild.  He's already on the mend w/out the terrible side effects of Tamiflu.  My 17 year old neighbor also used Tamiflu for the swine flu and ended up blowing out a major blood vessel in his nose,,M,3,1  days,11/5/2009,Tamiflu
691, 1, suspected h1n1,Major irritability_ personality changes_ loose stools_ possible abdominal cramping,both of my children (7 and 2 year-olds) ran 104 fevers on a Saturday evening. Upon calling the pediatrician_ they ordered tamiflu for both (suspecting the flu) Both children had had the h1n1 vaccination 1 week prior. My son had congestion and lethargy and high fever. My daughter_ 2 years old_ only had high fever. She had no other symptoms - great appetite_ no other issues at all.( I think the vaccination lessened flu symptoms) I didn't even want to give her the tamiflu (should have listened to my inner voice!) but kept thinking_ what if she gets worse_ etc. I stopped giving her the med after 5 doses because she just didn't have any major flu symptoms and it seemed crazy. I also stopped giving it to my son. He didn't seem to have an issues with the drug. However_ my daughter_ even after being off for over 24 hours_ is such a different child_ screaming at everything_ upset over everything_ loose stools_ poor appetite_ and my guess is_ severe abdominal pain. I was so distraught and worried today becuase I had never seen her act like this_ even during real major sickness or teething or severe double ear infections. Her reaction to this pain or mental discomfort has been almost unbearable for all. My husband and I are disgusted with the drug at this point. I regret giving it to her at all. Once you see how miserable a child can be while on it_ you would know. I just hope it leaves her system soon so we can have our daughter back.,F,35,2.5  days,11/5/2009,Tamiflu
692, 1, H1N!,After taking Tamiflu I feel extreme confusion/spaced out_ disoriented_and dizzniness. You can't really function fully on this medication.,The dr. prescribed me Tamiflu after having a my regular doctors appointment. I had a temperature of 103_ nights sweats_ chills_ sore throat_ and chest pain when I coughed_ and the doctor diagnosed me H1N1. My fever went away the next day after Tamiflu_ but then I became disoriented. I don't want to take the last day of treatment because it makes me so spaced out.,M,29,4  days,11/5/2009,Tamiflu

694, 1, High/Fever_ Flu,The side effects heavily outweighed the benefits. After starting my prescription of Tamiflu I had back and forth bouts of diarrhea and vomiting. I honestly felt like I was going crazy. I couldn't sleep_ and would wake up from extremely bizarre_ violent dreams. These were all things I experienced AFTER my fever had broken and would immediately get worse after each dose.  All of my symptoms (other than my temperature) got worse after taking it rather than better.,I contacted my pharmacist explaining everything and she said I really need to finish the course much like antibiotics_ or the flu may come back stronger. Now I have to deal with these side effects for a another two days_ while I feel otherwise I would already be back on my feet. I really don't think Tamiflu helped fight the flu any faster than rest_ hydration and over the counter drugs. I will never take this drug again.,M,23,3  days,11/5/2009Email,Tamiflu

Also seems irritable & unable to have a good sleep when she wasn't crying.,She was diagnosed on Halloween (Sat) w/ H1N1 & was prescribed Tamiflu. Sunday night she woke up screaming in pain & couldn't be comforted. This went on all night w/ only periods of 45 min or less between screaming fits. We were on our way to the ER when we realized a side effect was possible abdominal pain. so we waited & called the doctor. The nurse told us to add culturelle & see if that helped. It somewhat helped & only had 1 or 2 episodes lastnight. Then it happened again throughout the day & made the dr's office see her. They took her off the medicine. If they wouldn't have I was going to stop it. Thank God she is sleeping peacefully right not. I felt completely helpless watching my baby girl scream in pain.,F,2,3  days,11/3/2009Email,Tamiflu

700, 1, H1N1,I had one of the less common_ yet all too serious side effect - a seizure. Less than 1% of people experience this_ so I guess I fall into that category.  The seizure caused me to fall_ get a concussion_ and pass out.  This happened the FIRST DAY I was on the medication!,DO NOT TAKE THIS!,M,51,1  days,11/3/2009,Tamiflu
701, 5, H1N1,NONE - Please read for counter-point.  I thought it would be helpful to provide a full story.,My 5 year-old got H1N1 in school_ it was going around and the symptoms were pretty clear.  We generally resist medication and let illnesses run their usual course_ and became even more resistant after reading the reviews on this site_ which frankly scared me a LOT.  We let things progress for the first 36 hours without medication.When she woke up the second day with 104 fever and clearly getting worse_ we called a very close family friend_ who is also the best doctor I know_ and he encouraged us to start Tamiflu right away and also to give it to our 15-month-old as a preventative measure_ even though he hadn't shown any symptoms yet.We hesitantly started Tamiflu and had NO problems whatsoever for either child.  24-hours after we started it_ our daughter clearly started feeling MUCH better and has gotten better every since then.  The baby hasn't shown any symptoms of the flu.I honestly cannot report ANY side effects whatsoever_ other than *maybe* very mild irritability in the baby.  But they have both slept great_ much better than when the flu was causing her to wake up every hour.I don't think Tamiflu saved her life or anything_ she probably WOULD have recovered just fine on her own.  But it also could have developed into bronchitis_ pneumonia_ or other complications.  Perhaps Tamilflu had no effect on her fast recovery_ but it certainly seemed to help a LOT with ZERO downside for us.,F,5,3  days,11/2/2009,Tamiflu
702, 5, h1n1,Slight queasy or spacy feeling_ not sure if is from the flu or the tamiflu,I give this a 4.5 rating.  I went to the doctor halloween night after 24 hrs of vomiting_ nausea_ chills_ terrible aches in my joints.  I was severely ill_ had a fever of 102_ hadn't really slept for almost two days due to flu symptoms. I was the sickest I have ever been and pretty miserable. I had a positive flu test and was given tamiflu.  I took the pills right away.  I was finally comfortable enough to sleep that night and the next morning my fever was down to 99.  Today is my 3rd day on the drug and I am almost fully recovered.  The flu didn't go to my chest which is the main danger of this flu_ which I contribute to the tamiflu.  I have had some slight quesiness_ but I am not sure if it is the tamiflu or the h1n1. One of the characteristics of the h1n1 flu is nausea and vomiting_ which is how my illness started_ so I wonder if some people mistake this as being cause by tamiflu when it is really the flu. For me personally_ the nausea has gone way down since I started taking tamiflu_ enough to allow me to drink plenty fluids and eat small meals_ which I could not do before I got tamiflu.  I have not experienced any nightmares or hallucinations.  Just maybe a slight quesyness or spacyness_ but considering I am recovering from the flu and 3 days of having a fever I think thats pretty good. I general I feel the tamiflu shorten the duration of the flu and took the edge of the symptoms right after I started taking it.,F,27,3  days,11/2/2009Email,Tamiflu
703, 4, Preventative for HIGH RISK,Adult by Injection: I had a very sore arm from the injection site. The muscle ached a great deal more than it usually does from flu shots (i get them every year). It abated the third day. CHILD (2-3 years)1st dose by injection: My son ran a fever for two days off and on. On the third day was very dazed and lethargic_ especially when trying to wake up. It was a little alarming.,While we both had side effects_ they were fairly common. Considering we were both high risk_ I have more peace of mind knowing we'd had it.,F,35,3  days,11/2/2009,Tamiflu
704, 4, H1N1,The only thing I noticed was I was very alert after taking.  Was up until 2am most nights.  Other than that no nasty side effects at all.  I am surprised because I seem to get side effects from EVERY drug I've ever taken.,I took Tamiflu only because we have a young infant at home who was very ill when born and is still immunosuppressed (sp?)  I was told that it would be in our best interest to take the Tamiflu when I tested + for Influenza A.  They also prescribed it to my 4 1/2 month old as a preventative treatment.  I chose not to give it to her considering it is not even approved for under one year old.  She is still healthy_ knock on wood.  My older daughter is nine and was sent home from school today with a 101 fever...  Once again we were prescribed tamiflu to try to shorten the duration and have less chance of passing in on to our little one.  Im nervous to give it to her but have talked about what she might feel and that she needs to tell me ASAP if she gets any funny effects...  I hope I'm doing the right thing here....,F,28,5  days,11/2/2009,Tamiflu

It made me feel much better than the flu did for the first couple days_ but now that the flu symptoms are gone_ I still have to take it for 1 more day. I can't concentrate or help my 7 yr old with her homework. I feel like I have to get out of my house and I feel hot. My face and throat and saliva feel hot.

706, 2, Flu,Waking with screaming.....,"My 3 month old had a fever of 101.3 F_ so I had my husband take him to the E.R.  My 3 yr old and 5 year old both had ""suspected"" flu earlier this week. No tests were actually done to confirm it. But I was worried about my infant. The E.R. said he had the flu (no test done) and prescribed Tamiflu. I had read some websites about the possible side affects_ but worried with him so young_ that he might have complications from the flu. After his 1st dose_ I put him back to bed and he woke up crying after sleeping a while. He never cries when he wakes up...just makes noises until I come and feed him_ then smiles at me. But he would cry and not seem all awake. Now tonight_ after his 3rd dose_ he's waking up absolutely high-pitched screaming!!!!  So scary! Luckily he is consoled easily_ but it keeps happening. And I don't even know of he's in pain or anything.  I am stopping the Tamiflu!!! Is this going to cause lasting damage? Is my happy boy going to go through this every night?  Yes_ his fever is gone_ but to get rid of one evil to replace it with another is awful! I hope he gets back to normal with no lasting side affects. He also has a red dotted rash on his face_ neck_ and chest_ and he keeps rubbing his hands on his face like he's trying to scratch it.  Awful medicine!!!

708, 1, possible flu,after the 3rd dose I had severe stomach pain almost equal to labor pain and the pain gave me nausea.  It's not worth it to me given that it only reduced the illness by a day or two. I just got back from the ER and it turns out that Tamiflu severely constipated me per the Xray and I never have problems in that department.  I though my appendix was going to explode_ I was afraid since the pain was so severe.  And yes I do know what gas pains feel like and it was nothing like this.,Had a pregant friend who took it because we are both teachers and she was fine_ no complications.

I picked up the medicine and logged on to find out about tamiflu. thanks for this site_ i decided not to give her tamiflu nor antibiotic.  we just treated her as if was normal flu_ lots of vitamins_ fluids_ watched her temperature. as her temp didn't go too high_ she had a 3 day flu. didn't go to school for two days and hit the ground running without any pains or sufferings. To me_ this swine flue is a hoax to scare people and make money. tamiflu was not needed_ we bought it and ready to toss it in the trash.,M,49,0  days,11/1/2009,Tamiflu

Her flu symptoms were minor. It was prescribed b/c she has a history of getting asthma when sick and the doctor heard some wheezing in her chest. She also had a fever. After 2nd pill_ she had a nosebleed midday_ then another nosebleed that evening. I skipped the dose the next morning and she was fine. Gave her a dose after dinner and she came into my room in the middle of the night with another nosebleed. She never gets nosebleeds_ so this is VERY UNUSUAL! I came to this site to see if others are reporting nosebleeds_ but haven't seen any posts citing nosebleeds. She has a cough now_ but is otherwise fine. I am considering discontinuing Tamiflu.,F,10,3  days,10/31/2009,Tamiflu
719, 1, Flu-like symptoms,Halucinations_ Paranoid_ nausea_ horrific nightmares_ delusional_ numbness to my hands_ twitching in my legs_ very unusual thoughts_ dizziness_ Insomnia_ dazed and confused....,"I have never been so terrified in my entire life. I know the medicine works great for some people because I've asked. It's very hard for me to describe my story but I'll give it a shot... I started taking TamiFlu Tuesday morning_ Oct. 27. (Two pills a day for ten days) Wednesday evening_ Oct. 28th I started feeling dizzy and had to sit down. I started sweating a bit_ but my mom told me it was the Flu. I went to the doctor with these symptoms: Body Aches_ fever_ headaches. I tried to eat a bit and figured I'd go to bed. I decided not to take the next dose(4th pill) because I knew something was wrong. I continued to sweat_ and I could not go to sleep at all. I tried squeezing my eyes shut many times because I was so frustrated. My legs twitched pretty hard a couple of times and it made me lock my knee caps. I started getting scared at that point. After that I started seeing very unusual things every time my eyes would close.... Knives_ scary faces_ demonic type things_ Linda Blair in the exorcist- In my head I could see the part in the movie where she turns her head all the way around_ and when her head turned in my direction it was my face on her body. I could hear the tv shows begin and end all throughout the night. That's how I knew that I wasn't falling asleep. I had a nightmare that I was driving a old racing type car_ the car was in flames completely_ I was driving it at about 1000 miles an hour. When I saw myself I looked like Freddie Krueger with burn holes all over .I was also on fire_ but I was not screaming. I was driving this burning car_ with patches of my hair on fire_ slightly turning the wheel left and right uncontrollably. When I could finally see my face I was laughing looking right-left_ right-left. I jumped up in my bed. I was sweating a lot_ my heart was pounding. I kept checking on my 2 year old daughter over and over because I wanted to be sure she was okay. I began to pray over and over asking God to watch over myself and my family. Asking him to make sure I didn't die because my daughter needs me and because I have to teach her everything in Life. I have never been so scared in my entire life. And I assure you_ I do not have any psychiatric issues. I have lived a normal life_ and I have had the Flu more than once. The three flu tests at the hospital were all negative this time too! I finally calmed down_ and laid me head on my pillow. My alarm clock started to beep. I had to return to work Thursday_ Oct. 29th. I have never felt so relieved to get out of my bed for work at 6:15 in the morning. I took a shower_ and felt a little dizzy but ignored it. Anything felt better than being in my bed. I started driving to work_ and I couldn't feel my hands on the wheel. It looked like I had a ""tunnel Vision"". I got scared again_ and couldn't concentrate.

Probably more but because of the age his mum stopped the drug as soon as she realized what this drug was doing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  DO NOT LET ANYONE SAY THIS DRUG IS SAFE!,NO one should be on this drug!

725, 2, H1N1,I experienced nausea and extreme fatigue even with a low dose.  My 10 year old daughter found it extremely disgusting and she either puked it up or felt really nauseated from it.,Neither the doctor nor CVS pharmacist discussed side effects. I read the package warnings_ paused and took it anyway since I'd just spent a small fortune on supplies for a family of four.

726, 1, TESTED Positive with HINI,I work in a hospital as a Nurse and was exposed to it. I got tested by MDH and it came back Positive. Was given Tamiflu by one of our MD. It was HORRIBLE! I started to vomit_ was dizzy to the point where my vision was blurred_ and hullucinations. I stopped immediately and just let the Flu run it's coarse.,I strongly encourage parents to not give their children Tamiflu. I know that some think this drug is great. Reality check_ if your child is feeling better within 24 hours_ they probably didn't have the flu. This drug is suppose to decrease the 4 to 9 days of having the flu to 4 to 8 days. 24 hours less then the typical possible 9 days of flu. This drug is still being study for future effects if you have been exposed to it.  Don't give Tamiflu to your children unless they have any chronic conditions_ such as cancer or asthma. I am truly afraid of the future effects of Tamiflu and having yet another medical condition to worry about. Do your homework and really study this drug before using it. I would never givet this to my children or my family. I rather have them hositalized and let the flu run its coarse then put in their body a drug that is on market with such little study. If you go on your state medical department page_ you will see that they are constantly changing information about HINI. Obviously they still doing their homework too_ so wait for the full facts before thinking this medicine is great and exposing it to your children. Calm down_ its the flu_ let it run it's coarse and it goes away. Rest_ push fluids_ tylenol/ibuprofen as needed for fever and comfortablity. Be seen if dehydrated_ child is weak and not responsive_ or at any point where you feel uncomfortable.,F,34,2  days,10/30/2009,Tamiflu
727, 1, Influenza A,have not taken this medicine due to all the side effects I have been reading_ but just wandering if anyone has advice about how to treat the flu without using Tamiflu,My son 4 years old was diagnosed influenza a_ regular flu. They gave him tamiflu_ but I have been hesitant to give it to him because of everything I have read. He has been sick since Tuesday and we have been dealing with high fevers between 100 and 104 all week. At this point_ we are still dealing with him not eating much_ fever of 102_ and his coughing is getting worse. I have started giving him a natural flu medicine called Oscillococcinum_ so far I dont feel this is working for him. He is also taking immune boosters that I bought from a health food store. I am worried for him because I want him to get better_ but I dont feel that the Tamiflu is safe! I have read some previous postings and I was wandering if anyone has found anything else that treats the flu other than the Tamiflu. Any advice would be helpful! Please email if you wish and good luck to everyone!,F,24, ,10/30/2009Email,Tamiflu

He gave us all the info regarding the drug and told us it was up to us if we wanted to go ahead and give it to them based on the possible side effects.  We did decide to give it to them since it was within the first 48 hours of their symptoms starting.  We have had absolutely NO side effects whatseover and my kids were feeling better after just 2 doses!!!  I would definitely recommend trying it.  If there are side effects you cannot blame the drug.

731, 2, Asthmatic w/ H1N1 flu,Extreme Insomnia_ anxiety_ tiredness_ moodiness and loss of appetite,I am in excellent health with the exception of being an asthmatic. I was prescribed Tamiflu Sunday evening after a visit to emergency room for uncontrolled coughing_ inability to breathe and extreme aches and pains. My first dose of Tamiflu was taken Sunday evening with some food in my stomach resulting in just a small bout of nausea. However_ it's been all downhill since then. I have been awake since Monday.......can't sleep_ day or night. I feel like I am losing my mind.  I am not eating. I have weird thoughts. I can't function.  And since I am still coughing uncontrollably after five days_ I am not confident this product has helped. The side effects for me are overwhelming. Unfortunately_ there is no way to know how this product will affect you until you use it. Please give serious weight to all the pros and cons before using this product.

732, 1, Suspected H1N1,Anger_ irritability_ nightmares_ aggression_ emotional.,My 12 year old daughter was prescribed this medicine because she had all the symptoms of H1N1. After the first dose_ she could not keep her eyes open and fell asleep within 30 minutes. I gave her the second dose the next day at 3:50pm. She complained of a tummy ache_ nothing real bad. Then at about 1am in the morning I woke up to her standing up in the middle of the room screaming. I called her name and she turned to me and started hitting me in the face! The look on her face was horror_ I could tell she was scared. She was screaming and crying. i finally got her calmed down and she said that she had a dream that I was trying to kill her. My daughter was petrified to go back to sleep. She kept begging me to keep her awake so that she would not have to go through that experience again. She kept looking at me like she was afraid of me. She said she was afraid that it was not a dream because it felt so real. She kept asking me if she was awake or was she dreaming. It was awful! I never want my daughter to experience something like this again. I felt so bad for her. She kept telling me she was sorry for hitting me and she kept kissing my face. I told her that it was not her fault_ that it was the medicine. She finally fell back asleep 2 hours later.I am throwing the medicine out! I am also going to do whatever I can to get this drug off the market! If anyone would like to join me please email me.,F,12,1  days,10/29/2009Email,Tamiflu
733, 1, Flu like symptoms,Extreme disorientation_ suicidal thoughts_ tired_ throwing up_ restlessness_ not able to sleep,I took the meds for a total of 10 days (8 doses)_ because I was so disoriented that I couldn't remember to take if.  I just got back from the Emergency Room where the Dr called the poison control center to ask about the side effects (she didn't know) and all they said was nausea_ and dizziness.  This is their primary medicine treating a pandemic flu and no one knows the side effects.  The real pandemic is that our whole health system is a train wreck and people are dying unnecessarily.

Hospitals_ doctors etc. So_ I had to weigh my options...Give this to my baby or fear he would be hospitalized. I am on day 4 and he has had a rough time with it. He is aggitated_ I can tell his tummy hurts and the first dose made him vomit.,It has stopped the flu in its tracks. He was fever free within 24 hours and does not have it nearly as bad as my son did. I have heard the last few doses are a bit easier on the stomach. Since he is too little to tell me what is wrong it is heartwrenching to watch him be this uncomfortable.

738, 1, H1N1,My 2 year old son was diagnosed with H1N1 (with out a swab test done) I am 13 weeks pregnant. They put both of us on Tamiflu. He seems to be okay. However_ I do NOT have it and they gave me 75mg once a day for 10days (just because I would be High Risk). With in 30-45 minutes I had uncontrolled vomiting! My chest was heavy felt as I just ran 30 miles with every other word I had to gasp for air_ horrible headache_ back ache and I also felt very dizzy and disoriented. (I will say I had the back ache_ headache before taking the Tamiflu however_ they only got worse) I am sure I the back ache and headache was from staying up with my son. Despite them saying stay away for your sick child_ my son was sick for a day and a half before it HIT him hard so I looked at it as I was already exposed and If I am going to get it there is nothing I nor they can do to stop it. So_ I will care for my 2 year old who wanted his mommy and no one else!,I called my OB right away_ they are taking me off this drug and going to put me on the nose sprayI dont know if I should take that one or not?? I will say this flu is not as bad as it has been made out to be. Although my son never had the swab_ he already had the regular flu this year and the regular flu shot  so it was not as bad. The Doctor said with out a doubt he has the H1N1 bug_ he had EVERY symptom_ plus he was around two other children at day care that had the swab done and were positive. Its a flu that needs to run its course. I am happy to say he is doing okay. However_ the media has a great story to run with and its sad.its just a flu with a fancy name_ nothing to fear unless you have other problems that make you high risk however_ they fail to tell you_ you are just at risk to die from the regular flu too if you are high risk.,F,26,2  days,10/28/2009,Tamiflu

749, 5, H1N1,My 9 year old son has asthma and is considered high risk with the flu.  We decided that the risk was enough that we needed to give Tamiflu a try.  First dose was on empty stomache.  He did not eat much with 103 fever and couldn't eat.  He had mild to moderate nausea and threw up twice.  Second does just Nausea and the third dose Nothing at all.  If I can say anything at all_ EAT first before you take this drug.  Although the first time you take it you feel like a train hit you_ keep taking it.  The side affects of Nausea goes away after the first couple of days.,His best friend has it and has had 103 fever for 3 days_ chills_ aches and pains_ moderate cough.

I have two other kids and will report on them when/if they get h1n1.  But_ from what I see- this is a fabulous drug that prevents flu from doing real potential damage.

That afternoon he was running 101.5 and complaining of his throat hurting and has a runny nose and a cough.  I took him to the after hours clinic and he tested positive for Flu A and they suspected the new strain.....H1N1.,My son started the Tamiflu that night and we are on day 4 of 5.  It has helped tremendously.  I would say that by day 2 he was nearly back to his old self and has been fever free for 2 days.  My 9 month old is on the preventative dosage and has had no side effects either.  I make sure I give it on a full stomach.,M,5,4  days,10/25/2009,Tamiflu

The vomiting just happened and she didn't even know it was coming.,Her flu isn't that bad and she doesn't feel very bad_ so I think we will skip the rest of the tamiflu doses.  it's not worth the almost violent vomiting.,F,33,1  times,10/25/2009,Tamiflu

She has never been more misserable! We will just ride out the virus without meds! I am extremely dissapointed in this drug! We have never had a problem with meds before but after this I will question everything I give my kids!,We thought the flu symptoms were bad until she took the tamiflu and got REALLY sick!

762, 3, Confirmed H1N1,None,After reading all the comments here I was very hesitant to start my 12yr old son on Tamiflu.  However_ after talking with his pulmonologist and several pharmacists I decided to at least try it.  My son has severe asthma and trachea/broncho malacia and nearly every cold ends in pneumonia.  So_ the benefit of having symptoms even one day less could help us fight this.  However the horrible side effects that I read about scared me to death.  I am happy to say that we are on day 2.5 and there have been no side effects what so ever.  I will say that we have yet to see any benefit from it_ but this has hit my son exceptionally hard.  I hope this review helps other parents.  It's a scary thing_ and I think that if my son had no other issues I would not have started him on it.  Good luck.,F,37,2.5  days,10/24/2009,Tamiflu

765, 1, Flu and Dr. perscribed Tamiflu,My son started taking tamiflu that our Dr. perscribed and immediately he started violently throwing up. He was in alot of misery and pain. Six hours later he tried another dose and got worse and violently throwing up again. He decided it was definitely the tamiflu that was making him so sick. He stopped taking it and said the flu symptoms were much better to bear than the tamiflu side effects! The next day my husband brought home 'Feijo Homeopathics Flu 'for symptoms of the flu'. My son says it helped him tons. He could feel himself getting better and better with each dose. 2 1/2 days later he was all better. So_ I looked up the ingredients of this and was a little worried about the Arsenicum ingredient. But on the other hand taking tamiflu caused hallucinations. I was told that when one is having hallucinations neurons are being overloaded and burning-out by the hundreds never to be repaired. That is scary. Plus all the misery and pain and throwing up the tamiflu caused.,Maybe more than 1 out of 4 get terrible side effects from Tamiflu than they say.,M,18,1  days,10/24/2009,Tamiflu
766, 1, Confirmed Influenza A and Asthma,Severe behavior problems_ Fits of rage_ Depression_ Crying uncontrollably,I gave my 4 year old son 2 doses of Tamiflu.  After the second dose his behavior became very violent.  He is usually a mild-mannered child and became 'a monster'.  He was screaming_ hitting_ kicking etc. for hours.  He looked as though he was out of it during these rages.  I called his Doc the next day and they said to take him off of Tamiflu.  It was terrible to see my boy have to deal w/ these side effects.  Even 4 days later he is still showing some abnormal behaviors.  NO TAMIFLU.  We need to come together and get this drug out.,M,4,1  days,10/24/2009Email,Tamiflu
767, 1, H1N1,hallucinations_ suicidal thoughts_ disorientated_ anxiety_ depression.... none of which I have EVER experienced before,"The first day of taking the Tamiflu I did not have any side effects. The evening of the 2nd day_ about an hour after my 4th dose_ I was attempting to study for an exam I had in a couple of days and started crying and repeating ""the information won't go in my mind."" My parents then told me to go to bed_ and while in bed I started thinking of how I would feel better if I cut myself and released the pain_ or if I would just hit my head against the wall. I NEVER have had suicidal thoughts before_ nor have I ever hurt myself_ so these thoughts confused me even more. I felt like a crazy person trying to talk themselves out of hurting themselves. Finally I rolled over and saw dark figures surrounding my bed. I turned on the light and rocked back and forth convincing myself I wasn't crazy and crying uncontrollably. My parent's came back later and found me and I told them what happened after I had calmed down. This was by far the scariest side effect I have ever experienced_ I legitimately thought I was losing my mind. Over two hours later I am still extremely disoriented. I'd rather have H1N1 for a month than experience that again. I think the severity of the side effects stems from the fact that I had a decreased appetite and had barely eaten anything when taking the medicine.",F,20,2  days,10/24/2009,Tamiflu

She had unsettled sleeping the first night_ waking and having trouble returning to sleep (not usual for her). The following day she came up with a hive-like rash on her legs and arms.

Just let the flu take its course.  The drug ended up doing more harm than good and I feel like an idiot for giving it to my kids and taking it myself.  We ended up with dry mouth_ vomitting_ diarhea_ extreme dizziness_ my head has been spinning for days now. Just another way for the pharm. co's and govt to make money and create public anxiety and fear.  The flu was fine.  The side effects from this drug were horrible and ended up making us more sick_ and extended our illness.,,F,36,5  days,10/23/2009,Tamiflu
776, 1, N1H1 flu,My 3 year old son had nightmares_ would awake several times during the night screaming_ very frightened_ clearly misoriented_ crying inconsolably_ pushing and hitting us when we were trying to hold him and calm him down. He was also acting strangely during the day_ being much more stubborn and jumpy than ususal and acting at times as if he had autism disorder - crying inconsoalbly without any reason and not being able to explain why he is crying or what he wants done. That is very unusual for him; he is very verbal. He took just 3 doses before we stopped giving him the medicine.After the first dose there was just one nightmare episode_ and we did not know that it was a TamiFlu side effect; after another day on TamiFlu (2 doses) there were several nigght episodes_ and those were longer and more severe than the first. After we stopped the drug_ the effects could be felt for another 3 days_ though not as severe; much shorter and only once or twice a during the night.,I think that it is a crime to prescribe such a powerful drug with a potential of such horrible side effects to little children. According to the manufacturer's website the drug shortens the length of the disease by 1.3 days. Its is not worth it.,M,3,1.5  days,10/22/2009Email,Tamiflu

She went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Influenza A and was given Tamiflu.  She took her first dose at 4:00 PM today. She will not be taking another dose.  1 hour after taking Tamiflu_ she spiked a fever of 103 and began vomiting blood.  I researched and found that yes_ in severe cases vomiting blood was being reported with Swine Flu_ however_ this child was ill with what anyone has experienced with a ""run of the mill"" type flu.  It wasn't until right after taking the Tamiflu did she become VERY ill.",PLEASE do your research_ let the flu run it's course...MY RECCOMMENDATION:  DO NOT GIVE THIS DRUG TO YOUR CHILD!,F,8,1  days,10/22/2009,Tamiflu
778, 4, prevent the flu,hardly slept through the night.,My daughter ended up in the hospital at 2 weeks old for pyelonephritis_ but my fiance had been in the hospital 1 day before her admission for the flu_ so they put her on tamiflu due to that & the fact that she was so young and admitted to the hospital where obviously a lot of sick kids were at_ being that she's so young I can't exactly say any side effects she may have had_ but I did notice she wasn't sleeping as much through the night_ they started her on the meds two days after admission_ and those two days before she started the tamiflu they had her on antibiotics while trying to figure out why she had a temp of 102.8 & she started sleeping through the night_ so I'm just assuming that tamiflu may have been the issue_ but she hasn't been sick since being exposed to her father & the hospital_ so it's hopefully worked the way it's supposed to.,F,19,7  days,10/21/2009,Tamiflu

789, 5, H1N1,None whatsoever_ I took the medicine on a full stomach as recommended.,I started on Tamiflu within 12 hours of getting the first symptoms (for me_ it was a sudden onset of a raw larynx_ i.e. a deep cough accompanied by sudden unset of high fever and aches.)Within 12 hours after taking the first dose of tamiflu_ all the symptoms went from a grade 8 (like a steamrolling train) to about a 3_ a low grade fever that didn't even require me to take anymore tylenol to be comfortable. By day two_ symptoms went down to a grade 2_ I even stopped coughing up any green globs. By day three I was pretty much on my feet without anymore aches_ although still fatigued.I was back to work by day 4. I just took my last pill this Morning_ so day 5_ and all that is left is a little bit of a cough. All in all_ the medicine performed exactly as advertised: symptoms were reduced_ and the duration shortened.I highly recommend this medicine.,M,42,5  days,10/19/2009,Tamiflu

Severe anxiety and hot sweats.  After my first dose I vomited within 20 mins,I wish I had just let the flu run its course to be honest.

Hate to think of what I'd feel like with the full dose but would bet the effects of the flu feel worse.,Hate the side effects but overall I am pleased with the outcome.  My daughter has asthsma and was feeling horrible prior to treatment.  Within 24 hours she was doing much better.

Seemed to make me feel more 'groggy' as well and after second two doses tempreature and headache seemed to get worse_ but this may have just been the flu itself_ hard to tell. Had some trouble sleeping and some strange nightmares. I have discontinued the course_ and wish I hadn't started it - would much rather just deal with flu symptons than the awful constant naseau.

Hated the side effects_ but truly believe at least two of us would have had to be hospitalized if not for the efficacy of this drug in fighting the virus.

810, 1, Type A Flu,Vivid_ terrifying nightmares. Leg pains from the knees down.  A jittery or shaky feeling inside.,My 11 year old tested positive for Type A Flu after running slight fever for 5 days.  He had not been very sick_ I simply took him to have his lungs checked out due to a painful cough.  The doctor put him on Tamiflu.  His first dose was taken on a Wednesday evening two weeks ago.  That night his first nightmare happened.  EVERY time he falls asleep he immediately starts breathing hard_ flailing about and moaning.  I also started making him tell me about the nightmares and documenting each one.  My son has watched me (Mom) be burned alive_ drowned_ hit by an 18-wheeler_ etc.  I almost always die before his eyes.  In desperation_ I took him back to his pediatrician_ told her about his side effects_ gave her a report on the nightmares he has been having. She said that NO problems with Tamiflu had been reported and that his side effects were from the actual Flu.  If that were true_ shouldn't he have had these side effects before he started the drug?  (5 days after onset of symptoms)  It has been 2 weeks since first nightmare and they have not slacked off at all.  We are both exhausted!  Will NEVER give Tamiflu to this child again!,F,11,5  days,10/15/2009,Tamiflu

We had not been able to bring his fever down; was 105 night before and 103 the morning we gave him this drug.  His fever dropped within hours_ and was not above 101 the rest of that day_ and normal the next.  This seemed faster than the recovery his brother had (w/o tamiflu).

823, 4, H1N1,One of my daughters became ill and it was three days before we got a correct diagnosis and started Tamiflu. She was really pretty sick_ terrible coughing_ fever_ congestion...when my other two children started complaining of not feeling well_ I took the immediately to the doctor and the were put on Tamiflu as well. The latter two children did run fever and felt bad_ but not anything like the first one. I am convinced the Tamiflu helped my two children to not feel the full force of H1N1_ because the one who was the sickest was my strongest child_ she just didn't take the medication soon enough. One of my children often gets very_ very sick with respiratory problems and we did not experience any of that_ and I attribute it to the Tamiflu.,A lot of the side effects also correlate with symptoms of the flu.,F,38,5  days,10/12/2009,Tamiflu
824, 3, family member diagnosed H1N1,after last dose: anxiety_ redness under eyes(similar to sunburn)_ vomiting_ night sweats_ itchy. Previous doses: dry mouth_ lethargy,This was strange as the side effects only became very uncomfortable after the last (10th) dose. The redness came first_ then the restlessness_ sweats_ forceful vomiting. The itching occurred after the vomiting_ but that may be because the stomach discomfort masked the itching.,M,21,5  days,10/12/2009,Tamiflu

I became extremely tired and hazy_ felt a bit depressed_ and had very strange dreams. I also experienced itchiness that became worse at night - mostly in my feet and on my face_ but occasionally on my back.  I also had more of a tendency to become angry... not in a rational or usual way at all.  The most upsetting side-effect for me was the very tired feeling - I had no energy at all. I wondered more than once if I should have just taken my chances with the flu.,F,43,5  days,10/12/2009,Tamiflu

831, 2, h1n1-my daughter is asthmatic,My daughter(who is 7) was throwing up 20 minutes after the first dose. She has thrown up several times after taking the medicine which really stinks because she was holding down liquids.  We're now concerned that she may become dehydrated because she is throwing up once again and is refusing to eat or drink.  She is also complaining about her legs being really sore.  I read on this website that another little girl was complaining about soreness in her feet.  My daughter started complaining about sore legs shortly after taking Tamiflu.  This is our first day on the medication so I am going to contact her doctor and see if we should stop using it. ,So far_ it has made her symptoms worse.

I took it on an empty stomach and was nauseous and vomiting within an hour.  That lasted about 3 hours or so and then I started feeling better.  I decided to try again the next day but made sure to eat a hearty meal about 45 minutes before taking the pill.  I felt perfectly fine and will comtinue taking it.  I read that alot of people have dealt with the nausea so maybe try eating a full meal before hand and that might help.,F,24,2  days,10/8/2009,Tamiflu
839, 5, Type A Flu - possibly H1N1,hyper and very talkative -- this happens to him with a lot of medicines though.,My 6-yr old son was prescribed this after being diagnosed with Type A (suspected H1N1) flu.  Within about 12 hours of taking this he was feeling much_ much better.  He took his first dose about 36 hours after the first sign of flu (high fever).  His fever was down to 99.5 after less than 24 hours of starting Tamiflu.  The only side-effect appears to be making him hyper.  This happens to him on a lot of medicines like decongestants_ etc. though so it isn't unique to Tamiflu.  I would highly recommend this.  It really cut his flu down to being not bad at all.  He is symptom free from the flu 2 days after starting this with the exception of still having a low-grade fever.  We are on day 2 of a 5 day Rx.,M,6,2  days,10/7/2009,Tamiflu

I wouldn't recommend this medication.,F,16,4  days,10/7/2009,Tamiflu
842, 2, H1N1,Depression_ sadness_ nausea,My 13 year old daughter took this medicine for 3 days and began to say she was sad_ that this was the worst day of her life. She cried and nothing I could say or do helped.  She sobbed when trying to make up the classwork she had missed. I went to this site when I knew something wasn't right.  I stopped this medicine immediately.  I wish I had come to this site before I let her take the first dose!

His fever shot up to 40degrees celcius the next day_ and stayed there for nearly two days_ inspite of the Tamiflu. All the while_ he was complaining of severe stomach cramp and nausea_ and pleaded to stop taking the medication_ but the doctor told us to continue. It is day 3 today_ the fever has gone down_ but the diarrhea and nausea just kept getting worse_ so we finally decided to discontinue Tamiflu. His classmates who were also contracted with the same virus at the same time_ and who didn't take Tamiflu experienced high fever for just one day and then recovered quickly without any cramps or diarrhea. I wish I hadn't let my son take this medicine from the start.. My son has asthma_ so I got wary. But it was a big mistake.,M,13,2.5  days,10/7/2009,Tamiflu

Before giving her the first dose I read up on the side effects on other web sites. Most had the same information but only this website caught my attention because patients were rating the drug. I decided to go with a couple of doses since some of the patients on this site described little or no side effects.  :( Within thirty minutes my daughter was vomiting. She felt nausea for hours afterwards and felt even more fatigued than she had been.  This continued for several hours so I decided not go give her the second dose.  How this drug ever made it out to the public is difficult to fathom.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRUG BE GIVEN TO CHILDREN.  Too many of them are experiencing ill effects.,F,7,1  days,9/30/2009,Tamiflu

I would barley stand and became instantly bed-ridden. After the first dose i stopped taking it but it took 2 days for the added side-effects to subside.

She was prescribed a 7 day course of 75mg Tamiflu. Whilst taking this the only side effect she had was nausea. However since stopping the Tamiflu her behaviour and mood has changed to the extent that she is totally unrecognisable. She cries for no reason_ her behaviour at times is confrontational and aggressive_ she won't eat much and has lost weight.

Prescribed Tamiflu cos of Asthma. Started taking 18hrs into flu. Temp back to normal after 2 days_ suspect would have been 3 without tabs. Awful stomach_ no sickness - had tablets after eating dry bread! Am prone to flu and prone to ending up with bronchitis after. Have to say this seems a shortened flu and has left my lungs alone_ which is one of the things Tamiflu claims to protect. Awful stomach and runs though_ but this started before taking tabs.

Couldnt sleep the whole night_ tossing_ turning and twitching. Kept waking up in a pool of sweat. Eventually got some sleep at 6am. Im guessing thats when the meds wore off.

910, 3, Doctor prescription for flu,"Consistently experiences two severe side effects timed to 12 hour dosing cycle: severe effects started within first hour after taking dose and dissipated after 8 hours: Extreme pain at right side base of neck radiating through teeth and right arm making falling asleep impossible_ brain haze making normal activities like driving difficult but not impossible. Not like being drunk_ but more like having to really exert yourself to stay ""mentally alert"" and ""connected"" to reality--  similar to alertness issues of drivers when having driven too long.","Tamiflu did knock out the fever (and presumably the flu) within the first day_ but after reporting problems to my physician_ I got permission to stop  after second dose (24 hours). I went ahead and took third dose and subsequently experienced the exact ""timed release"" recreation of the side effects noted after dose number 1 and 2 (brain haze and severe pain at base of neck). I stopped Tamiflu after dose number three with no recurrence of flu symptoms.  Lingering side effects from Tamiflu on fifth day are mostly in early morning and before retiring: dizzyness_ nausea and general weakness and shakiness when moving around. However_ the majority of daytime hours since discontinuance of Tamiflu have been okay with good appetite and no flu symptoms. No sleep problems  since discontinuance.   I disagree forcefully that my neck pain was in any way related to the flu. I  did experience normal joint discomfort earlier from the flu. But the Tamiflu induced   pain in my neck was very localized and intense and repetitive after each dose. The neck pain was so bad-it made my teeth ache- you wanted to rip your teeth out. Giving this drug to little kids or infants without feedback seems unethical. I will be saving my remaining pills for a real pandemic emergency_ but I would never recommend Tamiflu to be used casually or as an easy way out for low-risk patients with the flu.",M,56,1.5  days,8/28/2009,Tamiflu

After taking this medicine_ plus some for congestion and some Tylenol_ I immediantly began to have stomach pains and nausea. Maybe it was because I didn't eat after/before taking it. I advise anyone who takes this_ to eat something with it. Maybe that will help. But so far_ this medicine.Also_ I've been getting so dizzy_ I almost passed out. It's been like that when I first got the flu symtoms and went to school(didn't know I had it_ plus my mom thought I was faking). But after a while_ the dizziness went away. Then when I started taking this medicine_ it happened again. Maybe it's the flu_ maybe it's the medicine.

Hot flushes. Involuntary spasm during sleep. Wild_ vivid dreams when actually able to sleep. Insomnia.,It was hard to know which were symptoms of my flu and which were side effects_ but by the third day of taking the drug I was in terrible pain on my back and although I had no raised temperature_ I felt waves of hot flushes. Some people have mentioned joint pain as a side effect_ I felt joint pain too_ but I belive it is a symptom of Swine Flu_ rather than a side effect of the drug. The pain in my armpits_ neck (lymph glands?) and back was so severe by day 4 that I had to call NHS direct and was referred to my GP. I found this drug unpleasant_ but would rather take it and be safe. I would definitely think twice about giving it to a young child. From my understanding it is important to complete the course once started_ so although I really wanted to stop_ I felt that the suffering of the side effects would have all been totally in vain.,M,35,5  days,8/20/2009Email,Tamiflu
926, 2, Suspected Swine Flu,headaches_ dizziness_ mild nausea_ confusion and inability to think lucidly.  Some skin rashes on the face.,I came down with severe flu headache and fever.  My father who is a physician wrote me a prescription_ after suspecting swine flu.  Within two hours of taking the first dose_ to my surprise_ my severe headache and fever were reduced significantly.  However by the third day I started to realize that I was feeling strong side effects of the drug.  I wish I had never taken it and had simply let the illness run its course.  I stopped taking it on 7:00 AM 8/19/09 (after six pills).  It is almost fifteen hours later - while I feel slightly better_ I am still still in a general haze and having difficulty concentrating.  It feels like I am hungover from downing a bottle of tequila_ except this hangover does not go away. I am not sure how I am going to be able to work or be productive. I guess I can get mad at my Doctor/Father....,M,37,3  days,8/20/2009Email,Tamiflu
927, 4, Suspected H1N1,Nothing on the first two days but suddenly felt dizzy_ nausea_ confusion and exaggerated emotions on the third day. Taking the pill in the morning_ the symptoms are mild but in the evening they seem to peak. YUK! No other word for it.,Tamiflu has definately stopped the flu in it's tracks but there is a trade off. As you get better from the effects of the flu_ you become worse with the effects of the Tamiflu. The question is_ have Roche got the schedule or timeline correct? Five days may be a little too long to tolerate as the drug builds up in your system and the side effects take over. I've had to stop at three days. This may be to my detriment_ we shall see but in my opinion_ the nausea and confusion is more debilitating than the flu symptoms. I believe Tamiflu works but as soon as the side effects begin_ one should stop taking it. By this stage_ the flu symptoms would've subsided enough for you to get back into life.,M,46,3  days,8/19/2009Email,Tamiflu

Although we both aren't in tip top shape after 3 days on tamiflu so far_ we both haven't gotten worse and I believe it is because of the medication.

Few glasses of pure orange juice (vitamin C)  first day of illess_ was manageable. 2nd day of illness was really bad_ high fever comes and goes_ nausea_ diarrhoea_ vomiting_ tiredness_ headaches_ evey sympton kicked in together. Stayed in bed all day and kept taking parectamols and water_ 3rd day all symptons were gone and am left with a mild chesty cough.  I found on the 2nd day I had to wear a few layers of clothes and two pairs of socks_ whilst having high fever and cold chills. I would then sweat a lot and that would break my fever.

She is over the worst of the flu but is now very irritable and just doesn't want to sleep. Never has she had hysterics like this_ even when she has been sick and had ear infections before_ or chest infection. This drug is evil_ don't give it to your kids. Now she has developed a rash as a side effect. I would never have given it had a read some of the other comments.,F,2,2  days,7/28/2009,Tamiflu
973, 5, swine flu,Stomach Cramps_ dry mouth_ slightly hazed.,I think it is fair to say that Tamiflu definately has side effects but I think the benefits are outweigh them. If you want to get rid of your swine flu quick then take it. The only reason I took it was that I was due to go on holiday_ if it wasnt for that then I would probably just take normal pain relief.,M,26,5  days,7/27/2009,Tamiflu

976, 1, suspected swine flu,Only started taking tamiflu yesterday_ after being perscribed it due to symptoms such as fever & chills_ headache_aching joints and stiffness_ diahorrea. Since then I have only taken 2 tablets but the results have been unbearable. The stomach cramps that have come about since starting on the meds are unbearable_ I am in agony and sometimes screaming in pain_ alongside even more severe diahorrea than before. I know the diahorrea may be due to the flu itself_ but the stomach pains are definately due to tamiflu. Wil not be taking it anymore_ awful!,I wish I had just started to get over the flu myself with water and paracetomol. I hope these side effects dont stay in my system for too long.,F,20,2  days,7/27/2009,Tamiflu

They said that the symptoms were side effects of the tamiflu tablet. They then prescribed me with Prednisolone steroid tablets for my chest_ as the tamiflu bought on my asthma and I had to increase my intake of inhalers. The second day I still had severe stomach cramps and diarrhoea so had to phone my GP again and then they prescribed me with Buscopan as it also bought on IBS.,"I would recommend you try to just take paracetamol_ drink plenty of water and get plenty of rest as the Tamiflu drug made me feel ten times worse. I am still in bed now and have been for five days. The doctors and NHS are only in most cases saying ""Suspected Swine Flu"". Take this medicine with caution if you decide to take and suffer from asthma or a bad stomach.",M,34,5  days,7/26/2009,Tamiflu
978, 1, Influenza,Nightmares and disorientation,Our son has been taking Tamiflu for several days and has had two nights of bad nightmares where he is disoriented and screaming out even when we wake him up and try to console him.  He appears terrified moreso than any typical bad dream that he would have.  Note this is also occurring after his fever is gone for the past day or so which would indicate these are not flu symptoms.

981, 3, Swine Flu,9 year old son was prescribed Tamiflu as doctor thought his symptoms indicated Swine Flu.  Not sure if he just got better or if the Tamiflu made him better_ I kept him off school_ kept him warm_ and gave him little bits of food often_ and anything he felt like eating_ his appetite was very poor_ and is usually very good. He was confirmed positive for Swine Flu.,I found he was very quiet_ played on the floor with toys like a toddler_ and wasnt at all interested in the usual playstation_ nintendo etc that he loves to play if off school sick.  Very confused state_ bewildered_ and wish I had read this website before we started.  Only have 2 more doses to take_ but thankfully no nausea or leg aches.

984, 5, suspected swine flu,None. It was a doddle.,I was terrified of taking this drug after reading the comments on here but Tamiflu was one of the easiest drugs I've ever had to take. I took it as I have underlying health problems including adrenal insufficiency. I took every tablet after 2 slices of toast to avoid nausea and stomach upset. I accept nausea seems to be definitely a problem for some but most of the other claimed side effects could just be the effects of the flu itself. Finally if you think it is causing severe side effects you can stop the drug immediately without consulting a doctor - it says so on the packet.,F,39,5  days,7/24/2009,Tamiflu

I took my first dose and later follow up with sudafed I thought I was going to jump out of my skin. Went to the doctor the next day and was told that it might of been the sudafed.  To continue with the tamiflu and was given other meds.  I took my second dose will in the hospital was a little jumping but not much.  I then took my next dose around midnight went to a sleep but not restful.  I then took my cough medicine and tessalon pearl.  That's when it got scary I began to feel out of control crying for no reason_ short of breath and feeling of doom.  Call doctors office was told to leave msg was connected to the ER and was told to go to the nearest one because of shortness of breath.  I got dress don't remember how and was asked by my other son where I was going I couldn't remember the whole conversation but I was not all there according to him.  He took me in_ they took a chest xray and told me to continue on meds.  I am not taking the tamiflu if I am going around not remembering what I am doing and feeling panicky.

987, 1, ,Sudden High temperature/Flu like symptoms,My 20 month old son initially was sick after his first 2 doses of tamiflu but what followed this on the 3rd (and last) day of his 5 day prescription was horrific..He was acting like a completely different child_ screaming and crying for no reason every 5 mins_ walking around in a daze_very irritable_ did not want to be touched_ restless_ very  anxious and could not sleep for much longer than 30 mins or so at a time..It was terrifying to see. The doctor told me that if his other symptoms had passed then to take him off it_ which we did. I wouldnt say he is his normal self yet_ still irritable although a lot better..Why  were we prescribed this without more information?

I was ten times worse after taking it and stopped after 2 tablets_ despite taking the first 2 with food as suggested.  I would never take this again and would never recomend it to anyone; if it was a cure it would be different_ but I would have been better off riding the flu out as I've done in the past.

1009, 1, Possible Swine Flu,Extreme nausea_ dizzyness_ severe stomach cramps,I took my first dose of Tamiflu yesterday evening. After about 25min my head felt like it was buzzing and I started feeling really dizzy. Then I checked out the leaflet and read through the side effects and I seemed to be experiencing quite a lot of them. About 10min later I had to lie down in bed as I felt so dizzy and horribly sick! Then the stomach cramps kicked in_ worse than the ones I have while I'm on my period. I was lucky that I had anti sickness medicine at home (which I took straight after reading the side effects in the leaflet!). Otherwise I probably would have vomited a lot. The anti sickness was also making me feel nice and drowsy so I drifted off into a good 12 hour sleep. For people that have a sensitive tummy like me I would not recommend taking Tamiflu but if you do_ make sure you have enough anti sickness medicine at home.I have not taken anymore Tamiflu since_ apart from this last dose. For me_ nausea dizzyness and vomiting are side effects I cannot bear and I'd rather have a headache and a bit of fever.,F,23,1  times,7/14/2009,Tamiflu

Also_ unable to open doors_ a bottle of water or hold his sandwich (I had to cut it up and he ate it with a fork!). I called his MD and he advised to discontinue the medicine.  He also has asthma and was taking predisone for congestion along with albuterol nebs treatments.  Apparently this is not a good combination.

I would say_ though_ that the Tamiflu MUST be helping_ because that's what it is for!  Today I started to get a very dry mouth - I feel as though I just can't get enough water. This is really the only thing I can think of that must be a side-effect. Would definitely take it again if I got the flu again.

Well that did not happen because he had a sore throat and fever by the time we got to New York.  The doctor said we would have to reschedule and gave us all a prescription for Tamifle.  He said there was a pandemic of flu in New york. My son started on the medicine and did not become ill.  Five days later I became sick with a headache_ sore throat_ dry cough and severe body aches.

1016, 3, H1N1 Virus - Swine Flu,While quarantined and treated from June 11-17_ I felt very tired. Exhausted. Sleepy. Had a strong strange taste in my mouth. I don't know if Tamiflu helped with the Swine Flu_ as I had a very mild case. Also_ I wonder if Tamiflu affected my chest_ since I had wheezing and a rattling chest - even though the Xray showed clear.. and I have never had asthma. The chest problems stopped 3 days after I went off Tamiflu.,Now it's July 3rd. I've been puzzled about why I am still exhausted_ but didn't connect it with Tamiflu. I keep getting headaches everyday_ and a weird 'buzzing' in my head. My back aches a lot more. I've been bluer than usual as well. Plus the IBS flared up too. I've made the connection with Tamiflu because today I tasted it very strongly in my mouth_ when I haven't taken it for over 2 weeks! It certainly must still be in my system!

1020, 4, Diagnosed Type A flu,"My 52 yr old significant other - Had been eating trail mix in the ER_ when released 3 hours later and took 1st dose of Tamiflu_ 25 minutes later had repeated vomiting. At 4th dose 48 hours later_ broke out in ITCHING HIVES_ inside one elbow and opposite knee/calf. (He later observed redness but no swelling at either side of waist/trunk.  He reported this skin redness ""moved around"" from place to place during the day but was gone by the time his next dose was due 12 hours later.  Called Doc who DC'd a ""new"" designer antibiotic he was giving coincidentally (AZO) but wanted him to take at least one more dose Tamiflue. WE SUSPECTED TAKING ON EMPTY STOMACH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO PROBLEM.  As additional doses taken with food did not effect much response - some redness once_ and mild itching_ but not nearly as severe.",Fever dropped in 1/2 degree increments after starting Tamiflu - (from a high of 102.4).  We believed it definitely helped. He has history asthmatic allergies and his respiratory symptoms were very scary the first night.  Although it IS curious that he had no real nausea before taking the Tamiflu ... it might have been a possible progression of disease? Cost for 10 tabs - $115! (Insurance covered only $65)HINT: TRY HYDRATING PATIENTS WITH GREEN COCONUT WATER! It was the only thing he could keep down for 36 hours (But sipped down a pint during first night!) Coconut water is said to have been used as IV substitute during WWII in the Pacific theatre when blood/plasma supplies ran out. Electrolytes mimic those of human blood_ (high potassium) and cocount is also thought to have antimicrobial properties. By late morning day 2 was tolerating tea w/lemon and dry whole wheat toast - but still wanted the coconut water.,M,52,5  days,6/24/2009,Tamiflu

So i took one Thursday night_ 2 Friday and Saturday but every time i took it the symptoms got worse. So i took it Sunday morning but didn't Sunday night. I have had anxiety attacks in the past and it seemed to be similar symptoms but much worse. I am glad that this medicine made my son well with what seemed like no side effects for him but i felt scared_ crazy and anxiety ridden the whole time. I called the doctors office today and they said not to take anymore of it. That i was most likely having an allergic reaction to it. I'm a little torn honestly. If i ever get the flu in the future i might take the chance on tamiflu instead of taking the chance on the flu. I just don't know.,F,36,3  days,6/22/2009,Tamiflu

1026, 1, My sister had the flu,Extreme nausea_ vomiting_ diarrhea_ disorientation_ lack of sleep_ loss of appetite,This medicine was horrible. I took it because my little sister has the flu and her pediatrician suggested my family take it so we wouldn't get it as well. I was also taking penicillin at the time to get rid of a sinus infection. Within minutes of taking tamiflu_ I felt nauseous and felt like I had to go diarrhea. I thought it might have been because I mixed the two medications_ so today I have only taken tamiflu and I've felt awful all day. I had diarrhea a few times and felt so nauseous to the point that I just vomited a little while ago. However_ there was not much to throw up because I hadn't eaten all day due to the lack of appetite this medicine gave me. I've felt like a zombie all day and haven't had any clue why - I figured it had something to do with this medicine. I wish I looked at this website sooner.,F,20,2  days,6/19/2009Email,Tamiflu

Don't know if the torso cramps and pains are attributable to tamiflu.  I stopped taking tamiflu today.  I'm 73. My suggestions:1.  If your situation is very bad_ call the tamiflu company or email as ""urgent"" and tell them what the situation is.  Ask if they have any remedy.2.  Call or get in touch with the CDC in Atlanta_ give them the lo-down. Ask for remedies.3.  Find a  good doctor.4.  Go to a hospital for help as needed.In the interim:5.  Try to cleanse your body system with hydration.  Take soup portions all day long.  This should consist of broth's_ vegetables and some easily digestible proteins such as small and not a lot of quantity of chicken (buy a small cooked one and take shreds) or white fish such as flounder_ garlic_ bok choi (Chinese cabbage - any will do)_ scallions_ 3 table spoons of parsley_ etc.  Do use a small amount of salt_ to keep up your electrolytes.  Drink_ or soup up lots of fluids 3 to 5 or 6 times a day.  Clean out your system.   Stay away from binding foods such as bread_ crackers_ beef_ pork or even lamb with or without soup_ do eat a few crackers that were made with an oil to help lubricate on elimination.  I am using a package of Ramen noodles. I triple the amount of water called for in my soup pot as too much salt affects my blood pressure.  I use only half",,73,4  days,6/18/2009,Tamiflu

He woke up around 9:00 pm crying.  I tried to calm him down and there was no calming him.  He complained of severe leg and arm cramps and would not let me touch him.  I asked him to calm down and tell me exactly where he hurt but he said he could NOT stop crying.  I asked him why he could not stop and he said he didn't know.  He would cry for an hour and a half and then basically fall asleep crying.  I would nod off and he would be back up in 10-15 minutes screaming in pain for another hour or so.  This lasted until 6:00 am the next morning.,I would not give this product to my worst enemy.  When I called my doctor he said he did not know of this side effect but to definately stop giving it to him. Please think twice before giving this to your loved one.

The doctor prescribed Tamiflu to lessen the effects of the influenza.  Last year he took it as well_ had some vomiting but we contributed that to his coughing so much it made him gag and then vomit. This year shortly after his first dose he came down with horrible stomach cramping and then vomiting.  We gave him two more doses at their designated times and his vomiting and stomach pains continued.  He is only six years old.  I called our family doctor_ who did prescribe the Tamiflu yesterday_ and she recommended stopping the medication altogether.  He had his last dose this morning but still is vomiting from time-to-time and is still suffering from stomach cramps.

I do not think it was Tamiflu related- remember she threw it up and at $8 per pill I was not going to give another to see it in the toilet.

I am 27_ work in the Emergency Room and seem to catch every illness known to man! Anyway_ I am on day 3 of Tamiflu and even when taking Tylenol PM along with the night dose of Tamiflu_ I can only sleep in one hour increments and feel like I am drunk or something. I vomitted the first 2 days (dry heaving). My skin itches and I get very hot all over.  I also have very strange dreams when I do sleep.  I haven't noticed a huge improvement in my illness yet but I will continue taking it unless these side effects get worse.,F,27,3  days,2/12/2009Email,Tamiflu

1073, 1, Postive Flu results,Immediate_ severe vomiting,My 9 year old son was diagnosed with the flu about 40 hours of beginning symptoms. His doctor wrote him a prescription for tamiflu (actually he wrote prescriptions for the whole family and I am so thankful that I didn't start treating anyone else). Within 30 seconds of his first dose he threw up. He was eating lunch at the time so I thought maybe that was the problem. I took the medicine back to the pharmacy to have a flavor added to see if that might help. We tried again when I got home and he immediately threw up after taking only 1 ml of the medicine. He felt so bad because he knew the medicine would help him feel better but he just couldn't keep himself from throwing it up. We tried 2 more times and he just couldn't keep it down. Finally_ I decided not to give him anymore because I was worried he would get dehydrated from throwing up. I think we are just going to let his body fight the virus and cross our fingers that the rest of the family doesn't get sick.,M,9,4  times,2/11/2009,Tamiflu

Within 20 minutes of taking it_ he was wandering around the house in a daze_ asking me odd questions and then telling me he needed me and running into the bedroom_ where he threw up in the middle of the floor.  He threw up again in the bathroom and then took a shower.  Afterwards_ he had no recollection of ever speaking to me or vomiting.  Very scary.

She also told me a few times she felt like she was going to vomit. She has not been able to eat hardly anything. I am the kind of mom that does not like to give my kids medicine unless they REALLY need it. I felt unsure about giving it to her but decided I would try it out.. Tonight I gave it to her and about hour later she was complaining of a really bad headache and was just in a bad mood. That is when I decided to do some research. I too have been taking tamiflu and it has made me a little dizzy. I will NOT be giving her the rest of the medication. I too will NOT be taking it anymore.

1093, 1, Flu Symptoms (Not Diagnosed w/ Flu),Insomnia (highly irregular sleep patterns)_ diarrhea_ severe dehydration_ complete loss of appetite_ sore throat_ increased heart rate_ anxiety_ altered mental state,BEWARE OF TAMIFLU.  I was prescribed this medication by a physician's assistant who noted I didn't seem to have the flu_ but showed some flu symptoms (fever_ congestion in the lungs_ etc.).  I started taking TamiFLU on a Wednesday.  I immediately got severe diarrhea.  Complete loss of appetite and severe dehydration followed. That first night_ my body would NOT fall asleep despite being exhausted.  It was like torture.  I was also very emotional_ and when I did fall asleep_ I experienced bad dreams/nightmares.  I took a total of 4 doses of TamiFLU before I realized it was making me sick.  Thank goodness for this website_ where I read other patient complaints and realized it was the drug_ and not something wrong with me.  It took approximately 5 days for my body to return to normal after being on TamiFLU.  BEWARE OF THIS DRUG!

After about 1 1/2 hours it seemed as though he had settled down a bit. He went to bed and I have gone in at least twice within the last hour just to check on him. This is going to be a very long night. After reading these comments_ I must be alert and check on him throughout the night.,I have no words to describe how a feel at this moment.

I was prescribed Tamiflu as a preventative measure.  Two hours after my first dose (only 1 pill) I felt awful.  I ended up having to take Zophran (sp?) for the nausea and zantac for the heartburn (I already take regular acid reflux meds).  Over 12 hours later I still feel awful_ although thankfully the other medications have helped some of my symptoms.  Had to miss school today because of the side effects.  My younger sister (11) also threw up several times after one dose.  I now warn everyone to STAY AWAY from TAMIFLU.  The bad definitely outweighs the good.,F,18,1  days,3/12/2008,Tamiflu
1122, 1, Flu,"Severe night terrors in my 3 year old.  4 nights of her waking up_ insisting someone was trying to ""get her"".  She's NEVER had night terrors before and these were EXCRUCIATING.  She could NOT wake up nor could she calm down.  She also developed a terrifying rash of 4-5 dots right on her vertebrae that blistered.",We finally called her doctor who told us to take her off it.  I will NEVER give this Rx to my children again.  It needs to be studied by the FDA.  It's been an awful blow to our family. Our 3 year old still seems to be suffering from occasional night terrors_ a week after taking this.  She had 1-2 night terrors a night beginning the day she 1st took the Rx...never had one before. She was also terribly restless and vomitted_ although that could have been the flu.,F,3,4  days,3/11/2008,Tamiflu
1123, 1, Tested positive for influenza,Nausea_ severe diarrhea_ loss of sleep,My son initially threw up within 45 minutes of initially taking Tamiflu.  I decreased the amount a little and had him take it with food.  His bowels became loose and on the 5th day became mucousy and even bloody.  He's had diarrhea now for 6 days and now after getting some herbs from the health food store they are becoming a bit more solid.  He completely regressed and turned back into a baby.  He was no longer potty trained_ he could only sleep for 30 minutes at a time.  He was extremely irritable and wanted to be carried at all times.  He completely withdrew and didn't talk_ eat_ or respond much to anything.  I wish I saw this website before I gave him this medication.  This is a horrible drug and should never be given to anyone!,M,2,5  days,3/10/2008,Tamiflu
1124, 1, diagnosed with influenza,stomache pain_ hallucinations_ nightmares_ night terrors_ and depression for several days after stopping drug,Prescribed for 9 year old son - we will NEVER use Tamiflu again. Side effects started after 1st dose. He took a total of 3 doses before I found this site and made the connection to the drug. All side effects_ except the depression_ stopped immediately upon discontinuing the Tamiflu. Do not use this medication!,M,9,2  days,3/10/2008,Tamiflu
1125, 1, Diagnosed with the flu,Within an hour of taking the first pill I broke out with a rash all over my hands.  Terrbile diarrhea followed as well.  Very out of it and became very snippy towards my loved ones_ totally out of character for me!!  The following day I woke up with a fever and more hives now on my hands_ feet_ ankles and  going up my legs as we speak.  Going to a doctor immediately.  Stopped taking pills after second dose (supposed to take 1 pill twice a day for five days) made it through one day!,For the amount I spent on this pill I am VERY disheartened at the results....I paid someone nearly 100 dollars to make me worse than I already was!!!,F,26,1  days,3/7/2008,Tamiflu

Started Tamiflu by 1 pm_ and felt better Sunday. Aches/fever were definitely reduced. Monday_ I felt dizzy and fuzzy-headed all day. Tuesday_ woke up with full-body rash_ vertigo_ swelling/tingling. Called the doctor_ and was told to discontinue Tamiflu. Wednesday_ still feel the swelling/tingling in hands_ feet_ and neck_ but rash is diminished. Thinking seems clearer. Feel very weak and shaky_ which could be either flu or side effects. It may be a good drug for some_ but I won't take it again.,F,46,2.5  days,3/5/2008,Tamiflu
1127, 1, heavy exposure to influenza a,nausa and diarrea first day_ calmed by third. But on fourth day had severe psychotic expriences. Felt like RLS all over body_ so bad I wanted to do ANYTHING to end the feeling. Heard voices_ out of it_ extreme anger.,I dont know if i had the flu_ but sure felt like it after taking first does of tamiflu. By the fourth day I felt like i was out of my mind. As an adult I was able to realize that something was wrong and I was not myself. Im a psychologist and if I had seen myself_ I would have been concerned. I wanted to crawl out of my skin and was a wreck. Felt like a constant panic attack_ clenching teeth and muscles clenching up as tight as they could. Slept 1/2 first night. Stopped taking it_ and am slowly returning to normal. Am very sore from being so tense and putting my body through that. Also got a rash. Watch your children_ they may not understand what is wrong or be able to explain it to you. It is a horrible feeling.,F,30,5  days,3/5/2008,Tamiflu

1130, 3, Flu,Mild dizziness initially (within first couple doses only)_ but no other noticible side effects for me.  My children did experience emotional side-effects though.,Was very effective at reducing the severity of my flu symptoms within 2 days of being on the medication.  I would be very hesitant about having this prescribed for young children though (under 10).  My whole family was prescribed this as we were all at various stages of flu symptoms.  My 9 year old son and 7 year old daughter had no real physical side-effects_ but seemed prone to mood swings while on the medication. My 3 year old son was on it during the same time and started experiencing very intense night terrors a couple times a night after about 2 days on the medication.,M,38,5  days,3/4/2008,Tamiflu

Some of his fits would be characteristic of a panic attack.,,M,4,4  days,3/4/2008,Tamiflu
1132, 4, Flu,Some nausea...but I DO have the flu...,"I took this drug after being diagnosed with the flu (i.e. actually tested postive for it).  By the 3rd dose my fever and body aches were gone. I m very concerned by reading what others have written about this drug. It seems like a majority of the people didn't have the actual flu. I read that many people ""thought"" they were getting the flu so they started taking it. If you had the true flu_ you don't just ""think"" you have it_ you do have it. This drug ONLY works if you actually do have the flu virus_ not some other virus. The ONLY way to know that is to be tested. And as for the side effects people describe they are ALL symptoms of the flu. One person said she started Tamiflu after being sick for less than a day and the next day she was worse after starting the med. However_ the 2nd day of the flu bug IS worse. This drug is not like Dayquil or Theraflu. It does NOT treat flu symptoms. It ONLY shortens how long you were going to be sick. I think people are under the",F,24,3  days,3/2/2008,Tamiflu
1133, 2, Flu,dizziness_ heavy head_ insomnia_ nausea,About an hour after I took each tamiflu pill I would feel so awful.  I became nauseaus and dizzy and couldn't sleep at night.  After 3 pills I figured out that the tamiflu was making me feel worse than the flu.  Once I got the tamiflu out of my system I just experienced other flu symtoms that were much more manageable (ie. fatigue_ weakness_ cough_ body aches).  I would not use this drug again.,F,38,2  days,3/2/2008,Tamiflu

1136, 1, Flu,My 6 yr old son took this medicine and had diarrhea within an hour.  After the 4th day of the 5 days it was prescribed_ a horrible rash broke out in tiny dots all over his body and his entire face was red and itchy.  Now it is 5 days after stopping the medicine and he still has side effects_ namely a horrible stomach pain and cramps.  I will never let him or anyone else in my family take this drug.,Not worth the agony of seeing your child suffer the side effects,M,6,5  days,2/28/2008,Tamiflu
1137, 5, got influenza despite vaccination,nausea and sleeplessness,Seemed to take my fever down very quickly--no sweats or chills after the first dose; also the nasal congestion and painful coughing subsided within another day or two. I took an antibiotic with it for a sinus infection that had already developed. In the past_ I have gotten asthmatic bronchitis with the flu. But that did not occur this time_ and I put away the inhaler. Fatigue persists but I am much better. Hopefully_ people will take the medicine responsibly to avoid creating drug-resistant strains of influenza virus.,F,47, ,2/27/2008,Tamiflu
1138, 5, diagnosed influenza B,No side effects noted.,Started tamiflu on second day of flu symptoms.  within 24 hours_ all severe flu symptoms; fever_ aching muscles_ nasal congestion_ severe malaise were  reduced to tolerable levels and gone within 48 hours.,M,63,5  days,2/27/2008,Tamiflu
1139, 3, So much for the flu shot!!,The first two nights_ I had weird dreams_ the third-fifth nights_ INSOMNIA! My stomach upset increased as more of the medicine was introduced into my body and as day 5 hit_ I was nauseous (with a burning sensation) all day.  Also_ I know that extreme fatigue is a symptom of the flu_ but I felt more fatigued throughout taking Tamiflu than less. On top of everything else_ I am now battling a yeast infection. :(,I had read the package inserts and researched Tamiflu before taking it.  I made SURE to take ALL doses (especially the first two days worth) with a LOT of FOOD in my stomach. I took it twice a day for 5 days. After my muscle aches and fever went away (day 3)_ I wanted to stop the medicine because I think it was making me feel WORSE! Also_ I developed a runny nose and cough (that I did not have before I started Tamiflu). I just don't know if I would take it again or not....it might be worth trying to get through it once WITHOUT this medicine.,F,38,5  days,2/27/2008,Tamiflu

I had a fever around 102_ but in about 3 hours_ I noticed I didn't feel as bad and actually felt like I could hold my head up and my fever had come way down.

Towards the end of the box of pills I began to have extreme anger problems and it felt like my blood was boiling I would get so mad. I felt dumb as well as if I couldn't understand things and I started to worry about things terribly which I believe caused the heart palipitations that scared me even more_ also night terrors.,It did rid me of my flu. But I had to stop taking it because of the ridiculous side effects. I'm not sure I'd ever take this again although it was greatly effective.,M,22,4  days,2/22/2008,Tamiflu

1147, 3, Diagnosed with influenza.,Nausea_ double vision_ dizzyness.,I have been experiencing extreme nausea with this medication that usually seems to lessen after I get some sleep. This is my second day of taking it. Took the first two doses and was able to sleep instead of puking. Took my third dose about a half hour ago and no nausea as of right now. My cough is a little bit better but nothing amazing so far with this drug. The rest of my family (mother_ sister_ father) has been prescribed and as far as I know they are having no side effects. I am having a strange sensation like when I look at something and look somewhere else the imprint of that is still there. I don't know how else to explain it. When I rub my eyes everything gets black and then fades to gray and eventually I have full vision again. I am dizzy and feel a little bit messed up.,F,18,2  days,2/20/2008Email,Tamiflu
1148, 2, flu prevention (boyfriend had flu),Was told to take it 1x a day for 10 days.  All was fine until day 5.  Woke up in a panic attack on the 5th night and having psychotic symptoms (intrusive images of hurting myself_ suiciding_ hurting my boyfriend_ and hurting my dog).  VERY scary.  I have never had psychotic symptoms before and it was absolutely terrifying.,I would not recommend anyone take Tamiflu for prevention (or for any other reason) unless absolutely necessary.  I have never had psychiatric side effects from a medication and honestly I would have rather had the flu for a week.,F,34,5  days,2/20/2008,Tamiflu
1149, 3, Tested Positive for Flu,The first few days I experienced nausea and a slight amount of diarrhea.  I had a headache before the use of Tamiflu_ but it continued at lesser degree while taking it.  Diarrhea became extreme after the 3rd day.  The entire time on the medication I seemed in the haze.,The medication did greatly help the stiffness and bring the fever down with in the first few days_ but for me putting up with the diarrhea after day 3 and becoming more dehydrated became more of a detriment.  My biggest issue is the packaging and the Tamiflu website does not list additional side effects such as headache_ diarrhea and sleeplessness.  It only lists nausea and vomiting.  Use this drug wisely,M,37,5  days,2/19/2008,Tamiflu
1150, 2, positive for influenza A,extreme nausea_ fogginess_ headache,It did take away the aches and pains_ but in my opinion at a higher cost.  I could at least move around before taking tamiflu_ once I started taking it I felt drunk,F,38,2  days,2/18/2008Email,Tamiflu
1151, 2, flu,My 15 month old son started taking this medicine when he tested positive for the flu. Late the first night_ he had muscle spasms in his arms and legs and got very stiff. Then he started screaming. The next day and night he wouldn't sleep for more than 45 minutes to an hour at a time_ and he would start screaming_ wouldn't let us touch him_ and would back himself into a corner and sit down on the floor. This happened multiple times_ and we assumed it was due to his high fever of 104. But by day 2 1/2_ the fever was gone_ and he was still behaving strangely. On day 3 we didn't give it to him_ and he was fine_ no problems. On the morning of day 4 I gave him a dose_ and an hour later_ he was backing away from me_ sitting in the corner_ banging his head on the wall. There was no question it was the medicine.,We have learned that these side effects have been seen in Japan_ but not really here. We have no Asian ancestry in our family. While it does shorten the duration of the flu_ don't assume that strange behavior is the result of the high fever. It may not be.,F,34,3  days,2/17/2008,Tamiflu

I took her to the doctor and my symptoms were just beginning. he said it was too late for her but prescribed the tamiflu for me since I was early onset of clear flu symptoms from her. I had one horrible night of progressing pain headache and symptoms_ but by the following morning and third pill feel almost 100%. If you can get this at early onset_ like within 12 hours of symptoms it is a real lifesaver since the virus has not fully multiplied. As you get close to 48 hours the effects become less then nil.,M,37,1  days,2/13/2008,Tamiflu
1156, 1, Positive Flu test,Severe Nausea_ ** voilent vomiting** _ loss of desire to eat,Was advised to take this with food... but it did not help.  The nausea was extreme_ and got worse with each dose.  I had an appetite but when I looked at food I got incredibly nauseous.  My 3rd dose this morning_ left me so nauseous I could not care for my 3 small children for a short time.  I violently threw up and - luckily - felt better right away.  I have not vomited in 24 years... through 2 pregnancies (one was twins).  But this stuff - ugh_ I'm glad my kids were busy playing and did not get to see me being so ill.  Be very careful if you take this drug.  If you have a bad reaction_ you need to have help around.  I stopped taking this drug after 3 doses.  Will never attempt again.  Next year - I'll probably get a flu shot.,F,43,2  days,2/13/2008,Tamiflu
1157, 4, Preventative for me_ son had flu,Headache_ nausea_ dizziness_ fatigue_ severe vertigo.,This drug has such good and bad.  My son had a positive Influenza A nose swab_ and I took it as well as a preventive measure_ since I was beginning to feel flu-like symptoms.Well_ we took the Tamiflu_ and felt so horrible for 2-3 hours_ I mean_ I literally could NOT lift my head off of the pillow from the side effects_ the room was spinning and I thought I was going to throw up!  However_ after about 2-3 hours_ these side effects went away_ and after the second dose or so_ I felt like I'd never been sick -- and so did my son!So_ overall_ would take again_ even though the side effects were HORRIBLE_ they were temporary_ and the medication COMPLETELY wiped out the flu within two days.,F,29,4  days,2/11/2008,Tamiflu
1158, 1, Diagnosed Influenza B,This was given to my 92 year old father who is normally very with it mentally. Although he is legally blind_ this medicine is causing him to hallucinate and it won't let him sleep. He's dizzy and unstable.  It's just awful. It did get rid of his flu symptoms_ but I think I would have rather treated the symptoms with over the counter medicine.  Be aware if you take this medicine_ it could be dangerous.,,M,92,2  days,2/10/2008,Tamiflu

My twins are both on it as well and one displayed dreaming problems and then the next day both are back to normal with only a nagging cough left.  Its really a double edged sword taking this medicine.  I helped the flu symptoms but comes at a cost.  You either have the flu or tamiflu.,M,42,5  days,2/7/2008,Tamiflu

Within 24 hours fever was gone_ and I got a lot of energy. Within 48 hours_ though mild cough still lingered_ felt healthy enough to do daily chores all day. Judging by my co-workers who got the same strain of flu_ Tamiflu cut the duration of the disease by at least 50% and the symptoms by more than that.

After 2 days of taking this drug_ I was still running a fever of over 102 and began experiencing uncontrollable crying and sobbing_ unexplained anger and fear.

Went to the doc_ prescribed tamiflu to help me get over the flu faster.  The price was insane_ but in weighing the cost of being sick (I don't get sick pay at my job) and having to take extra time off work... it seemed like the better choice.  Within 30 minutes of taking the drug I was horribly nauseus and had to lay down with something to continuously vomit/heave in to.  The vomiting side effect experience lasted roughly 4 hours - intermittent vomiting/heaving/nausea.  In addition to the 4 hours of pure hell I experienced (thank you tamiflu)_ it had worsened my headache so much that it was nearly unbearable for the next 12 hours_ and the stress of the heaving popped blood vessels in my eyes... which is just nasty.

I noticed people are complaining of body aches_ nausea and diarrhea .. those ARE flu symptoms ??  I had those symptoms before I took the Tamiflu_ so of course I had them after that.  I slept for 16 hours and yes I did experience some bad dreams that night but do remember that I was taking decongests that night to relieve symptoms_ which dehydrate in turn can cause bad dreams.  The next night I did experience a hard time sleeping_ but it may have been because I slept for 16 hours the night before.  I think the symptoms were because of having the FLU itself.  BUT let me tell you I felt much better within 24 hours_ almost perfect within 36 hours and 100% as if it never happened within 48 hours of taking it.  It worked great !! Last year the flu had me in bed for a week_  this was very effective for me.  It is debatable if you can blame my side effects on the Tamiflu_ but if you coul,F,36,3  days,1/18/2008,Tamiflu

Today_ Japanese government decided that Tamiflu should not be given to othewise healthy children who are 10 or older. In this season alone_ two 14-year-olds jumped to their deaths from their high-rise apartments_ and two 12-year-olds have broken their legs after jumping from balconies here in Japan.

NOTE:  Some people who have reported negative experiences here have had legitimate adverse reactions_ which will happen with any drug.

Or the guy who said he ""was exposed to a cold."" Well_ DUH_ Influenza is NOT a cold_ and Tamiflu will not work at all for colds. That's not what it was developed for.

He experienced extreme nausea that had him bedridden that he thought was related to the Tamiflu_ but he was also taking a cough medicine that had hydrocodone in it.  I convinced him that it was the cough medicine that was causing the symptoms because every time I've ever taken anything with hydrocodone in it (i.e. Lortab)_ I've had extreme nausea and vomiting.  When he stopped taking the cough medicine and continued taking the Tamiflu_ his nausea disappeared.  If the Tamiflu is taken with food_ any nausea it causes is usually mild and is gone completely within a couple of days of taking the medicine.,My 1-year-old daughter also took the pediatric dosage of Tamiflu to keep from getting the flu when my husband was diagnosed.
