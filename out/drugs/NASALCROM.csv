0, 4, Allergic rhinitis and allergy cough,Critical neutropenia and moderate leukopenia.  This is a rare adverse effect.  The drug did its job on the allergy symptoms_ felt fine and healthy_ but tanked my white cell count as found by a routine CBC.  This is an older_ third line of defense for allergies_ but I cannot take antihistamines or corticosteroids.,Should be fine for the general population_ but if one is sensitive to other medications_ I would advise caution.,F,36,4  months,7/26/2016,Nasalcrom
1, 1, Allergies,Upset stomach,It upset my stomach aggravating my gerd. I have the same reaction to Singulair and nasonex. IT was thankfully millder than either of those drugs but somehow the medication is getting into my stomach even though sprayed in the nose.,F,43,1  days 1X D,3/8/2015,Nasalcrom
2, 5, Sinus congestion,None,I find it is the only allergy medicine that PREVENTS allergies from starting or developing.  At the first sign_ I use it 3-4 times a day & it always takes care of it.  I had been suffering from more & more frequent sinus infections & found this.  I notice none of the other meds list prevention.,F,79,15  years1 squirt 3X D,5/11/2014,Nasalcrom
3, 2, Allergic Rhinitis,I cannot take antihistamines and thoughtNasalcrom would be my saving grace.  It did seem to help_ but after 3 months of using it did cause racing heart beat.,,F,,3  months40 mg,9/8/2012Email,Nasalcrom
4, 5, Allergic Rhinitis,It causes a scratchy throat if it drips down the throat. Must tilt head forward when using spray to prevent this from happening.,Have used for 3 months per year for past 4 years_ during fall ragweed season. Works well_ but I must use up to 5 times per day during peak pollen season. It has allowed me to discontinue nasal steroidal sprays. For some reason my eyes feel less dry and more comfortable than when I used Nasonex (and other similar prescriptions).,F,48,4  years 4X D,5/27/2012,Nasalcrom
5, 2, Year round allergies,Post-nasal drip_ sore throat_ swollen glands,With each use of Nasalcrom_ I experienced an almost immediate post-nasal drip_ mild sore throat_ and swollen glands in my neck.  I didn't connect the symptoms with the Nasalcrom at first. The last time I used it_ I experienced the same symptoms but to a much more severe (painful) degree_ lost my voice for a several days_ and had raspy breathing. It took about 5 days for everything to clear up. This may be an unusual reaction_ but I won't be using Nasalcrom anymore.,F,56,7  days 2X D,9/28/2010,Nasalcrom
6, 4, Allergies,"Metallic ""smell"" sensation I experienced after dentist used a specialized surface cleaner has persisted for a month now. May not be related to Nasalcrom or may be specific issue_ but the but the sensation has persisted after I discontinued use about 2 weeks later (having used 12 weeks overall as suggested by manuf.) Can't be sure of the relationship at this time_ however I note that metallic sensations are stated with other nasal applicators and can't rule out the connection.",As an allergy medication this product is spectacular. After the second week of use I thought that there were no allergens this summer_ but my friends were all suffering miserably. I highly recommend the product given my specific reservations.,M,45,3  months,9/5/2007,Nasalcrom
7, 1, Allergic Rhinitis,Nightmares_ acne_ increased hunger/weight gain_ increased thirst_ dehydration_ constipation_ depression (crying no reason)_ increased agitation/irritability_ sinus swelling_ nasal congestion (just like when I used Singulair).,"Okay - this stuff works.  And works well IF you use it 4x a day for greater than 2 weeks.  BUT at the 2 month point - I had to stop.   I KNOW this is not Singulair_ but it is STILL a mast cell inhibitor and 7% of each squirt up your nose DOES get absorbed into the bloodstream.   I was shocked.  I didn't even know what was going on - and then it hit me.  THIS is a mast cell inibitor JUST LIKE singulair.   In fact_ it is even a type of ""something"" sodium chemical_ just like Singulair.   My side effects were IDENTICAL as when I took Singulair for 2 months.  Am I the only one?   I was even urinating all the time and had insomnia at night_ racing heart - the whole deal!  Really nuts.  And I was so dissapointed too - because it DID work so well.  So use with caution and if you DO get side effects / don't believe its not the drug.  ALL DRUGS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS...and anything you take in orally or put on any mucus membrane WILL get absorbed and the longer you use it_ well - you get th",F,41,2  months,4/19/2007Email,Nasalcrom
8, 5, allergies; extreme nose irritation,Started getting nasal relief in a few days.  I take zyrtec all year_ but sometimes need a boost when I get allergy attacks.,Takes a while to feel benefits_ but helped a ton.  A few times a year I need a more medication than just my regular antihistamine_ so I take benadryl and/or nasalcrom.,F,30,4  weeks,10/17/2006,Nasalcrom
9, 3, allergies_ sinus headaches,NONE,NasalCrom works fairly well.  I started it because all the antihistamines were giving me terrible side effects.  NasalCrom is OTC and is supposed to be one of the safest drugs available for allergies.  Downside is it has to be repeated every 4 hours.  I've read it works best after about 2 weeks_ I'm not quite there yet.  If I were able to take it once or twice a day I would be pretty happy with it.  It's not as strong as other antihistamines I've taken_ but I don't get drowsy or moody.,F,32,6  days,4/4/2005,Nasalcrom
