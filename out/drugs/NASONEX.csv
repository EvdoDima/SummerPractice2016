Now for the past week every Night I am having terrible dreams about drowning_ being chased and shot at_ and death of family members.  Nothing else has changed in my life so I'm worried it is the nasonex.  I have also noticed bags under my eyes  recently_ I'm guessing from waking up after dreams in the night and being scared.

I have persevered in the hope things would get better but I now suffer from very odd headaches which tingle and my head feels a little numb at times.   The headaches are often localised to particular parts e.g near the right near my ear or top of my head. The numbess has at times spread to around my eyes although not constant.  I also feel quite anxious and feel on edge at times.  I sometimes wake up during the night feeling very anxious.

This is an extremely sweet little girl who turned into a crazed_ moody_ out of control child within a few weeks. About to lose my mind when I thought about what had changed since she started acting this way. It has to be the Nasonex. I am glad I saw these reviews before something even worse happened to her.

25, 3, Sinus + mucus overproduction,It seems that it roughly coincided with when I began that  I have difficulty swallowing food.  It hurts.  It feels like I have an air lock in my upper throat. I looked for comments  on this drug and am interested to see the number for anxiety or depression since  after I started Nasonex I feel like crying a lot of the time - something I'm not at all prone to do. Another - possible - thing is that one week after starting Nasonex I got a bad sinus infection - something I've managed to avoid for several years now,I was prescribed the Nasonex because of nasal drip to see if it was connected with night 'chokings' - a feeling of total constriction in the throat when asleep and then sudden panic waking.   Nasonex has helped this since I haven't had a  night choking since taking it.,F,69,2  months200 1X D,4/27/2015,Nasonex
26, 3, Allergist,Dry eyes_ eye pressure and severe eye pain.  Possibly multiple salzmann nodules,I took this drug for 5 years (during allergy season) and didn't think it was having any effect.  Except that I also had other problems (namely eye problems) going on_ but thought they were unrelated.  However_ when I stopped using this product for 4 months_ my eye problems also went away.  I started the product again_ eye problems returned.  At that point_ I had an epiphany ... all these years of eye pain_ eye pressure_ dry eye_ blurry vision that glasses weren't fixing have all likely been side effects of this medication.  I've also had two salzmann nodules in my left eye that requires surgery in the past 2 years - and that might be due to the increased eye pressure?,F,42,5  years50mcg 1X D,4/25/2015,Nasonex

33, 1, sinus problems,From day one of taking this spray I had trouble sleeping_ I can usually fall alseep around 10pm but wasnt dropping off whilst 2am. Half way though the week I found I was having nightmares and bad anxiety (I am usually a cobfident person but was overwhelmed with even going to the supermarked) I was extremely snappy with my partner and started getting paranoid over the tiniest things. On the final day I had a disturbing nightmare which caused me to wake up at 4am and not go back to sleep_ the only connection I could make to my odd behavior was nasnex and removed my self off it immedietly. I thought I was being ridiculous and made an appointment with my doctor the very next day who prescribed me anti depressants. Luckily I refused to take them it is now day 5 of not taking nasonex and im starting to feel more like me_ normal bed times_ calmed anxiety and the nightmares are getting less and less. I have no doubt Nasnex made me feel the way I did and I would not reccomend to anybody.,,F,20,8  days,2/5/2015,Nasonex

35, 1, Seasonal allergies,-Anxiety-depression-mental unrest,At first my seasonal allergies were bad_ so I took it daily and it helped marginally. After awhile_ my mental state started to decline and I started getting mild anxiety and depression as well as homesickness (at college). Progressively_ my condition worsened to the point of mental anguish that would arise at random points during the day. Then I started some real investigating and found that when I stopped taking nasonex_ I returned back to normal. I'm not sure if anyone will see this but if you do_ please heed my warning. DO NOT TAKE THIS! Whatever benefit you may receive is nowhere near the mental costs caused by Nasonex. Although it seems unlikely from a nasal spray_ it truly was the cause of me going from one of the happiest people I know to one that would go through each day thinking terrible thoughts and wanting to cry (I'm an 18 year old male) at any given time.

My ENT told me to do to sprays in each nostril twice a day for two weeks.  My vision has felt very strange and almost like I have vertigo.  I have always been an extremely balanced person who has not suffered from dizziness.  I too have been very scared that the feelings would not go away as it has been more than a month since I stopped taking it.  I also have never had a bad reaction to anything that has been prescribed to me I do not suffer from any allergies and am an extremely healthy person aside from this postnasal drip which has been really annoying me for the last couple of years hence my visit to the ENT.  It's impossible to say for sure if this drug is the cause of these feelings how ever so many people have described similar feelings I have had heart palpitations nervousness anxiety dizziness which are all new to me and today I definitely feel better and I hope that gives the other people still experiencing problems that you will get better.  I do still have a strange feeling when I move my head and in my eyes but it's much better than it was.

I had been getting by with normal Claritin for years and after rescuing a dog in August of 2013_  I began suffering from long term sinus congestion.  My sinus' were dry and what seemed like ""swollen shut"".  I then decided to change to Allegra_ and tried that for a month_ then Zyrtec the following month with zero improvment.  I then decided I had to go back to the old allergy pills I used to take with the ""D"" on the end... spent a fortune on Claritin - D and still could not breathe out of my nose.  I broke down one day and finally went to the doc who prescribed me Flonase and I started improving. I was back to my normal unobstructed breathing again.  After that ran out I found it far more convenient to purchase Nasonex - which has been just as effective.  I can't imagine my life without this product.

59, 1, seasonal allergies,heart palpitations_ full blown anxiety disorder_ nasal sores that wouldn't heal_ weight gain (35 lbs over time)_ THINNING OF BONES to the point of osteopenia_ GLAUCOMA,"I used to be a size 8/10 before being prescribed this junk. It worked for my allergies_ but it caused 10 years of nonsense. Who knew? Drs would tell me it didn't cause any side effects because it"" wasn't absorbed into the blood stream."" Seasonally I would outgrow all my clothes and feel like a cow_ and after stopping Nasonex Iwould start to slim down again. Then another allergy flare-up would occur and I would start the Nasonex again_ and this yo-yoing has been going on for 10 years now. I trusted drs too much. One day it finally occurred to me that this stuff happened seasonally. Sorry_ just slow to realize it. Don't use this stuff!!!!  It has taken a month to drop a dress size_ and will probably take a few more months to drop the rest of the weight and bloat. Nose sores are healing_ and bloody nose is going away. I'm using Nasalcrom_ with great results. Dr's didn't know why my bones were thinning and why I should be developing glaucoma at my age. One day it all hit me like a ton of bricks. Shortly after starting this med_ I had full blown anxiety syndrome for which I had to seek treatment. Never made the connection until very recently. Keep having thinning of the bones reports. Never made the connection until now. Eye spasms in one eye. Since stopping Nasonex_ I was really tired at first and had alot of joint pain. Now that is going away_ and I am taking Rx grade vitamins and Glucosamine/Chondroitin. Feeling and looking better. I'm sad for all the lost years to th",F,55,10  years2x/ea side 2X D,5/13/2014Email,Nasonex
