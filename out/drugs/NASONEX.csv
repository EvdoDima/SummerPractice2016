I have persevered in the hope things would get better but I now suffer from very odd headaches which tingle and my head feels a little numb at times.   The headaches are often localised to particular parts e.g near the right near my ear or top of my head. The numbess has at times spread to around my eyes although not constant.  I also feel quite anxious and feel on edge at times.  I sometimes wake up during the night feeling very anxious.

This is an extremely sweet little girl who turned into a crazed_ moody_ out of control child within a few weeks. About to lose my mind when I thought about what had changed since she started acting this way. It has to be the Nasonex. I am glad I saw these reviews before something even worse happened to her.

25, 3, Sinus + mucus overproduction,It seems that it roughly coincided with when I began that  I have difficulty swallowing food.  It hurts.  It feels like I have an air lock in my upper throat. I looked for comments  on this drug and am interested to see the number for anxiety or depression since  after I started Nasonex I feel like crying a lot of the time - something I'm not at all prone to do. Another - possible - thing is that one week after starting Nasonex I got a bad sinus infection - something I've managed to avoid for several years now,I was prescribed the Nasonex because of nasal drip to see if it was connected with night 'chokings' - a feeling of total constriction in the throat when asleep and then sudden panic waking.   Nasonex has helped this since I haven't had a  night choking since taking it.,F,69,2  months200 1X D,4/27/2015,Nasonex
26, 3, Allergist,Dry eyes_ eye pressure and severe eye pain.  Possibly multiple salzmann nodules,I took this drug for 5 years (during allergy season) and didn't think it was having any effect.  Except that I also had other problems (namely eye problems) going on_ but thought they were unrelated.  However_ when I stopped using this product for 4 months_ my eye problems also went away.  I started the product again_ eye problems returned.  At that point_ I had an epiphany ... all these years of eye pain_ eye pressure_ dry eye_ blurry vision that glasses weren't fixing have all likely been side effects of this medication.  I've also had two salzmann nodules in my left eye that requires surgery in the past 2 years - and that might be due to the increased eye pressure?,F,42,5  years50mcg 1X D,4/25/2015,Nasonex

33, 1, sinus problems,From day one of taking this spray I had trouble sleeping_ I can usually fall alseep around 10pm but wasnt dropping off whilst 2am. Half way though the week I found I was having nightmares and bad anxiety (I am usually a cobfident person but was overwhelmed with even going to the supermarked) I was extremely snappy with my partner and started getting paranoid over the tiniest things. On the final day I had a disturbing nightmare which caused me to wake up at 4am and not go back to sleep_ the only connection I could make to my odd behavior was nasnex and removed my self off it immedietly. I thought I was being ridiculous and made an appointment with my doctor the very next day who prescribed me anti depressants. Luckily I refused to take them it is now day 5 of not taking nasonex and im starting to feel more like me_ normal bed times_ calmed anxiety and the nightmares are getting less and less. I have no doubt Nasnex made me feel the way I did and I would not reccomend to anybody.,,F,20,8  days,2/5/2015,Nasonex

35, 1, Seasonal allergies,-Anxiety-depression-mental unrest,At first my seasonal allergies were bad_ so I took it daily and it helped marginally. After awhile_ my mental state started to decline and I started getting mild anxiety and depression as well as homesickness (at college). Progressively_ my condition worsened to the point of mental anguish that would arise at random points during the day. Then I started some real investigating and found that when I stopped taking nasonex_ I returned back to normal. I'm not sure if anyone will see this but if you do_ please heed my warning. DO NOT TAKE THIS! Whatever benefit you may receive is nowhere near the mental costs caused by Nasonex. Although it seems unlikely from a nasal spray_ it truly was the cause of me going from one of the happiest people I know to one that would go through each day thinking terrible thoughts and wanting to cry (I'm an 18 year old male) at any given time.

My ENT told me to do to sprays in each nostril twice a day for two weeks.  My vision has felt very strange and almost like I have vertigo.  I have always been an extremely balanced person who has not suffered from dizziness.  I too have been very scared that the feelings would not go away as it has been more than a month since I stopped taking it.  I also have never had a bad reaction to anything that has been prescribed to me I do not suffer from any allergies and am an extremely healthy person aside from this postnasal drip which has been really annoying me for the last couple of years hence my visit to the ENT.

I do still have a strange feeling when I move my head and in my eyes but it's much better than it was.

I had been getting by with normal Claritin for years and after rescuing a dog in August of 2013_  I began suffering from long term sinus congestion.  My sinus' were dry and what seemed like ""swollen shut"".  I then decided to change to Allegra_ and tried that for a month_ then Zyrtec the following month with zero improvment.  I then decided I had to go back to the old allergy pills I used to take with the ""D"" on the end... spent a fortune on Claritin - D and still could not breathe out of my nose.  I broke down one day and finally went to the doc who prescribed me Flonase and I started improving. I was back to my normal unobstructed breathing again.  After that ran out I found it far more convenient to purchase Nasonex - which has been just as effective.  I can't imagine my life without this product.

Then another allergy flare-up would occur and I would start the Nasonex again_ and this yo-yoing has been going on for 10 years now. I trusted drs too much. One day it finally occurred to me that this stuff happened seasonally. Sorry_ just slow to realize it. Don't use this stuff!!!!  It has taken a month to drop a dress size_ and will probably take a few more months to drop the rest of the weight and bloat. Nose sores are healing_ and bloody nose is going away. I'm using Nasalcrom_ with great results. Dr's didn't know why my bones were thinning and why I should be developing glaucoma at my age. One day it all hit me like a ton of bricks. Shortly after starting this med_ I had full blown anxiety syndrome for which I had to seek treatment. Never made the connection until very recently. Keep having thinning of the bones reports. Never made the connection until now. Eye spasms in one eye. Since stopping Nasonex_ I was really tired at first and had alot of joint pain.

I also hadn't attributed the Nasonex to the sleeplessness_ but since discontinuing it I am sleeping better_ not waking up as much_ and feel more rested in the morning.

This resulted in having full-blown sinus pain.  I had no nasal drainage and was able to breathe through my nose.  I was placed on an antibiotic_ amoxicillin 875 mg_ I believe.  First round did not get rid of my sinus infection_ so the Rx was refilled.  I continued to feel so awful generally on top of the other specific symptoms.  It finally occurred to me to look up the side effects of Nasonex since I realized that I had become worse after beginning it.  Eureka.  I did not take it yesterday or today.  My thinking is much better today.  My sinuses still seem to be messed up deep in my upper forehead.  I was so bad that I thought I must surely have a brain tumor or cancer of the sinuses and_ who knows_ maybe I do!  All I know is that I have stopped the Nasonex and I feel better today than I have in months_ even though I still have a ways to go in feeling 100% better.

He was taking it for coughing at night due to a post nasal drip and constant ear nfevtions. However_ this time it was prescribed to take it twice a day. Within 3 days there was a MAJOR change in my sons behavior. My very sepweet boy who loved to eat and sleep became super aggressive.  He started hitting me and his baby brother who he always kissed_ not hit.  He began screaming an out of control scream making me wonder if he was possessed!  He was waking up at night screaming from night terror than wouldn't go back to sleep_ he was probably too scared from the awful dreams he was having. I thoug at first that maybe it was the beginning of the terrible twos but theses symptoms came on way too fast and the it dawned on me that it might be the nasonex.

118, 1, Hay fever,My 7 year old son was prescribed Nasonex by an EMT aMonth ago. One squirt in each nostril each night. He developed a cough (sounds like a clearing of the throat) which wouldn't go away so I took him to the GP. He was tested for whopping cough which came back negative. Whilst at the dr getting the test results the doctor noticed a certain hand movement that's son kept doing. He sent my kids out of the room and said that he thinks my has behavioral (the cough & hand movement). He told me he would refer us to a Tourette's specialist in a few weeks if it continues. The cough & hand movement both began about a month ago. I went home confused and tried to think of what could be the cause. Then I remembered he started Nasonex not long before both symptoms occurred. So I googled Nasonex side effects & it wasn't listed. So I googled 'can Nasonex cause behavioral tics' and hundreds of results came up. I rang my GP who had never heard if it. He did his own research and said there seems to be a definate link and to stop using it immediately. I rang the ENT who have scheduled my son in for an emergent appointment next week. I'm hoping that when the Nasonex is out of his system the tics will stop. In the meantime_ after_ the poor kid has nausea & headaches from withdrawals_ and it's only from 4 weeks use.

128, 1, allergy,Pressure in the eyes and forehead_ itchy and puffy totally dry eyes_ tiredness_ sleepness_ inability to concentrate,I have suffered 1 year from the side-effects of Nasonex. I have undergone a total hell. My symptoms started suddenly after 2 weeks of using Nasonex_ twice a day. It took me 4 months to realize that the spray was the cause why I feel so weird. Think I visited all possible doctors to find out the reason_ but nodody could diagnose anything. It ended up that my parents took me to a psychiatrist who insisted that I had an endogenious depression. I was put on Cipralex. But I was totally happy individual before that incident! So I continued thorough researching and after 1 year the total understanding of what happened came to me. In short_ Nasonex constricts the vessels also the ones of the brain. Narrowing of blood vessels results in glucose deficiency_ magnesium deficiency in some cells (not enough glucose is brought to those cells so they canï¿½t perform aerobic respiration in a normal rate). Thats why we feel so awful. First you need vasodilators (I used Crataegi fructus and Ginkgo biloba in high doses). It will widen your vessels and enable minerals to be delivered to the cells again. Then you need to increase magnesium in your nutrition - better to buy magnesium in the pharmacy and drink a daily dose. This is how I recovered from a year nightmare when I thought I was going insane. I dont take anything now and feel great. Get well people!,F,23,4  months 2X D,11/6/2012Email,Nasonex
129, 1, Allergies_ stuffy nose,Within a few days the allergies were gone_ no snotty nose or sneezing. What I thought was a miracle drug actually has caused some pretty horrific side effects. Within a week my son developed a dry cough (spoke to pharmacist & was assured it had nothing to do with nasonex.) This cough hung around for about 3 weeks before the diarrheoa & dizziness begun. Saw the GP who diagnosed mycoplasma & we were given antibiotics. The vomitting started_ chest pains_ increased dizziness_ wheezing. All these symptoms I associated with the mycoplasma. Continued using the nasonex_ no improvement seen in my son. A chest X-ray was performed_ nil signs of infection (no temperature the whole time) another lot of antibiotics given & he seemed to completely heal... Until yesterday & bang chest pains_ difficulty breathing_ dry cough_ wheezing +++  I am talking about a child who in 9yrs has barely had a cough/cold last for more than a week let alone had a severe wheeze in which ventolin provides only short term relief!. I 100% believe this medication is responsible for what has gone on in the past 5 weeks & to think that doctors & pharmacists were oblivious to these side effects is disgusting... I work in the medical field & I know it's impossible to know every drug back to front_ but really isn't it obvious it can do more harm than good.

We didn't know at the time why.Second_ his behavior became markedly worse_ often over excited/agitated and was getting into trouble in summer camp.  To the point where he was kicked out of CAMP!!Third_ he started having heart palpatations at night_ now he's only 4.5 and cannot describe the symptoms.  But he'd wake up in the middle of the night grasping his chest while crying.  Took us 2 weeks to find this site and realize all the symptoms are due to the stupid steroid.  We immediately stopped using it.  But his vision problem did not improve until 1 month later.  We only gave this drug to our son because his doctor swore it had ""no side-effects"".

What I'd forgotten about was the side effects I'd had before_ mainly hyperactivity. I don't take any other medication so the difference was remarkable. People have also commented on my mood so I'm sure it's affecting that simply because they have commented - grumpy is the word they use. All of which is out of character.

Every year I think I'll be able to get away with homeopathic remedies or natural cures_ but I inevitably end up at the doctor's office.  I have tried nasonex twice_ a couple of years apart.  The first time I took the recommended dose and after 3 days I had a major panic episode.  Today_ out of desperation_ I decided to give the steroids another shot. I decided to  take half the recommended dose to start.  I put one spray in each nostril_ and about thirty minutes later I started feeling extremely strange.  I was twitchy_ despondent... I felt disconnected from the world_ almost out of body. I almost lost my mind at the grocery store - every little thing made me jump ten feet in the air and cry.  When i got home I totally lost it.  I was running a bath and the sound of the bath water frightened me because it seemed way too loud.  I started panicing and crying_ hyperventilating and feeling totally out of control.  My boyfriend wanted to take me to the hospital_ but I asked him to get me an ativan instead_ which after about 20 minutes had me feeling closer to normal. I've heard nasonex isn't supposed to give you a systemic steroid reaction_ so maybe I'm just extremely sensitive to steroids (they always make me feel horrible).Regardless_ if you have any kind of steroid sensitivity_ I'd avoid this.

These lumps were strange in that they formed almost overnight coming up suddenly and were hugh. When I traced back I realized the first one appeared after I started the nasonex. I finally looked it up on the internet and found acne as a side effect. I told my allergist who said this was highly unlikely-it is only in your nasal passages.  Before these lumps I was very pleased with Nasonex. Now I am trying Astelin but I feel groggy.

Nurse took my BP and told me it was high 152/100 - she took it 4 more times and each time it came back high from 160 -150/100 range.  She told me I should follow up with my GP regarding it.  Went to my GP yesterday for the heart palipitations and shortness of breath - and she wanted to put me on Blood Pressure Medication - explained that I haven't been feeling well_ and was at the ENT 2 weeks ago and they told me I have high bloop pressure..  I'm 40 - work out 6 days a week biking and running.  I'm 5'2 and weigh 118lbs. My BP has always been normal - until Nasonex.  She told me it's not the nasonex and I should start taking Beta blockers - well - I'm not taking beta blockers_ or Nasonex anymore.  Too much of a coincidence for me to believe that I just got high blood pressure out of the blue.  I don't feel much better yet_ but I can feel my body slowly coming back.I'm convinced this is all realated..,F,40,21  days2 sprays 1X D,9/21/2011Email,Nasonex

He scheduled me for a barrage of tests. It suddenly dawned on me that my symptoms began about the time I began using Nasonex. In researching the drug_ I found this website. I was amazed to see the number of people whose symptoms were just like mine. I quit using Nasonex two days ago and I am already feeling much better. I'll go ahead with the tests just in case_ but I'm convinced that Nasonex was the cause of my problems.,F,57,3  months2 sprays 1X D,9/5/2011,Nasonex

Nasonex does what it's supposed to do_ even now that I have a runny nose_ I dont feel very congested. But like others Im starting to think the side effects start to become far worse than the nasal congestion I got the spray for. I get runny nose far more often than before_ I have developed a nasty insomnia (3+ hours to fall asleep no matter what). Doc gave me medicine for depression too which I discontinued to use as certain events improved the quality of my life. Achy muscles are really annoying_ a short walk is enough to cause muscle cramps that I didnt usually get even after running for 30 minutes or more. My long range vision has become somewhat blurred. I just dont know whether to quit taking nasonex as Im afraid the nasal congestion comes back far worse than what it was before starting to use the drug.,M,23,1  years50mg 4X D,8/31/2011,Nasonex

218, 3, Severe Hayfever,A miracle cure for the first few days_ then I started to get severe anxiety symptoms and irregular heartbeats.,The doctor said the anxiety symptoms and heart problems were caused by anxiety due to some kind of hidden mental problem (yes they worked that out after a 5min consultation) and Naxonex was completely safe.  I now believe that some people who have low stress levels or more importantly low levels of adrenaline can cope with nasonex_ just like they can with caffeine etc.  However_ my guess is that anyone who is sensitive to adrenaline or has high stress levels_ may find that naxonex pushes them over the limit into anxiety attacks etc.  I found after discontinuing naxonex for a year_ that the recommended dose was far to high for me and I suspect others too.  I now have one single spray every 3 days and I can cope with that.  I also completely avoid caffeine and alcohol while I'm taking it. I keep my adrenaline levels as low as possible.  It's a shame that doctors don't recognise this connection.,M,48,14  days50mcg 2X D,8/22/2011Email,Nasonex

230, 1, Allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps,Throat numbness_ headaches_ heart palpitations_ shortness of breath_ serious recurring sinus infections_ loss of sense of smell and insomnia if used before bed.,Prescribed by an ENT_ I used Nasonex for almost two years.  It was initially effective for the nasal stuffiness_ although it left me shaky with moderate heart palpitations and shortness of breath for up to a couple of hours after use. Eventually I experienced complete loss of the ability to smell anything at all.  The ENT said that the anosmia was due to the polyps NOT the Nasonex and even with surgery was probably irreversible.  About a month ago (May of 2011) I caught my first real cold virus in a number of years and quit using the Nasonex because I was just too sick and the congestion made it impossible to spray anything into my  nose.  After about five days I was feeling better and thought about going back to my usual allergy routine however I woke up one morning with the beginnings of a sense of smell which improved throughout the day until I was able to smell things for the first time in a couple of years.  I have not restarted the Nasonex_ my sense of smell seems to have returned permanently_ and it isn't making any difference to my allergies which it seems are well controlled by the other prescriptions of Astepro and Ipatropium Bromide.  No more headaches_ no more palpitations or shortness of breath when climbing my stairs_ insomnia is gone and I could almost cry for happiness about being able to smell again.  While the idea of having these polyps is kind of creepy_ the feeling is diminished by actually being able to smell a rose as well as increased enjoyment of food,F,68,2  years50 mg 2X D,6/16/2011Email,Nasonex

233, 1," Dr. said ""Allergies""",SEVERE laboured breathing_ panic episodes_ dizziness_ minor bleeding nose.,"I went to the doctor with bad post nasal drip and a clogged ear tube.  He claimed it was allergies (though I told him I have had the same ear problem over and over and not during allergy season).  He insisted that was the problem and instantly prescribed me Nasonex ($45.00)  I used it a couple of time at night before I went to bed and noticed it almost immediately cleared up my nose drip.  I used it for a few more nights and then one day I started getting extremely dizzy_ to where I actually had to go and lay down to stop the dizziness.  I went to a different doctor who said the dizziness was from my clogged ear.  I went a couple of days without using it and the dizziness went away_ I assumed my ear was getting better although it didn't feel unclogged at all.  I went out of town for a weekend and noticed my ""allergies"" were really acting up_ so I took Nazonex_ for 3 nights straight and on the 4th day_ I could barely walk a flight of stairs without struggling to breathe!  I thought I was gonna die.  When I returned home I continued with my Nazonex because it really did help with the nose drip and stuffiness.  Then one day I had to episodes of severe trouble breathing.  One when walking up a flight of stairs and one while loading my 2 year old in the car.  That last one was really bad.

But then I got suspicious and started reading the side effects on the leaflet_hardly anything was mentionned. So I searched further and luckily found this website. I can see a clear link with my sudden symptoms and am stopping taking this today. Very grateful to everyone who has posted their experience of this as I've only been using it for a week_ so limited damage. It's very effective in clearing the nose however_ so maybe it's O.K for someone who doesn't suffer from these side effects or who is an extreme case. Maybe allergy sufferers are more sensitive to steroids? I have had similar reactions using an inhaler. So I'll go back to my stuffy nose rather than have the side effects from this drug.

I have been off Nasonex for three weeks_ and my side effects have disappeared.  I have been on antipsychotic medication for years_ and when I went to my psychiatrist with complaints of loss of balance_ he attributed the balance problem to the long-term use of antipsychotics.  But in three weeks without Nasonex I have had a remarkable improvement in balance_ so much so that I would consider that Nasonex is the primary culprit.  I had used Nasonex off and on for four years_ and that is how long I had balance problems.

271, 4, Allergic Rhinitis,Some more things to consider,PART 03: Some studies to consider:I did some further research into the magnesium and mineral loss connection and found some interesting information:1 - Mometasone Furoate (the active ingredient in nasonex) is a very potent steroid at the systemic level. This means only a small amount is needs to be absorbed to have a significant effect and although the drug has been designed to act topically some is still absorbed systemically (see study: http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/20/6/1386.full?related-urls=yes&legid=erj;20/6/13862 - The reason small amounts of steroids can have a large effect is due to their transactivation or upregulation of genes.

272, 4, NasalObstruction_Allergic turbinate,This drug did help for the first few days_ then i started noticing side effects. On examining side effects I came to the conclusion mineral deficiency maybe the cause.,PART 01 January 29_ 2010: Many thanks to the person who mentioned Magnesium deficiency related to use of this corticosteroid nasonex. Heres why I believe the symptoms maybe due to the mineral deficiency:1- Its clear that at least some of the nasonex is being absorbed systemically where its supposed to have glucocorticoid-like effects (similar to the body under stress). BUT the amount of nasonex used (even if all of it were to be absorbed would'nt be sufficent to cause this list of crazy symptoms: your body produces far more corticoid steroids in response to running on the treadmill than a couple puffs of nasonex would provide so the steroid itself does'nt seem to be the problem2- I noticed symptoms which i initially thought were due to the nasonex because they were similar to symptoms of the body under stress (indigestion_ irritability_ insomnia) BUT on further examination i realised the symptoms did'nt fit stress symptoms exactly. I did'nt have the characteristic sweating like when i'm stressed or the cold hands and feet_ I was even able to have solid erections (TMI? :) ) something i can never do when i'm stressed. On researching the Magnesium deficiency it seemed to make more sense. Mg is heavily involved in digestion and mg deficiency maybe why so many here report stomach symptoms. All of the other symptoms i've seen listed can be attributed to magnesium in some way especially irritability_ anxiety_ depression_ numbness_ brain fog...the list goes on,M,27,2  months4 sprays 1X D,1/28/2011Email,Nasonex

What I've discovered after having been to numerous doctors and having all sorts of tests etc is that I have been on the verge of suffering from adrenal fatigue. Naxonex contains corticosteroids which mimics the cortisone - the hormone that produces adrenaline.  When I took the Nasonex_ it basically pushed my adrenals over the edge producing classic adrenal exhaustion symptoms - such as numbness and hot/cold areas of the body due to poor blood distrobution and really bad insomnia. Do a search on adrenal fatigue and you'll come up with many of the symptoms we all experience.  I read that a very high percentage of the population suffer from adrenal fatigue. It would make sense then_ that this medication could affect many people by boosting their adrenaline to the extreme - the symptoms of which are very nasty indeed.

By the time you realize what's going on it's too late.  Your life has been destroyed!  I've been to the doctor more in the past 5 months than I have in my entire life combined.

My doctor believes these are withdrawal symptoms and that they should go away in 2 weeks. We will see.

All I know is after one week of taking this + a standard antibiotic (cefdinir) I feel worse_ and am so anxious I'm considering seeking psychiatric treatment (lack of sleep_ constant feeling of fear_ racing pulse_ dizziness possibly brought on by anxiety). If this drug DOES cause these side effects (and the sheer number of comments in this database which list anxiety-related symptoms certainly suggest this_ at least to me) it really bothers me that there is virtually NO documentation of this anywhere else on the internet. Would this not have been discovered in testing and thus documented somewhere scientifically? The whole scenario is just unsettling.,M,27,7  days2 pumps 1X D,11/1/2010Email,Nasonex

307, 1, Allergies_ Sinus Infections,dizziness_ vertigo_ clouded thinking_ feeling of fainting_ anxiety_ panic attacks_ ear and sinus pressure_ ear ringing_ jaw pressure_ numbness in hands_ loss of taste_ dried blood when blowing nose_ nausea,I've been on nasonex on and off for five years and regularly for two years. I had multiple sinus infections and was relieved to have my doctor prescribe Nasonex for daily use initially. It definitely cleared my sinuses and my sinus infections became less frequent. In December 2009_ I experienced what my doctors thought was a migraine headache- spotted vision_ dizziness_ vertigo_ and a drop in blood pressure. I began to develop anxiety to what I thought were migraine symptoms. I became afraid to be at work_ to drive_ and to be in public because I thought I was going to faint. Recently_ my vertigo has taken the form of my head feeling that it is being pushed to one side. After visiting my doctor_ an ear/nose/throat_ an allergist_ and a headache specialist I just happened to type in Nasonex and side effects and found this website. I am going to begin titrating myself off of this medication tonight. Before 1-2 years ago_ I was a healthy and happy person. Since then I've been dizzy_ barely made it standing up in two weddings because I felt so dizzy and nauseous_ and started seeing a therapist because I thought I had severe anxiety. I am a therapist myself and thought I was going crazy and didn't understand why. I had no idea that this medication was a steroid.

321, 1, allergies,Please read the three parts to my story...,PART 2: My wife was very worried but supportive and she took me to another doctor.  That doctor recognized my story as a previous patient of his had gone through a similar ordeal.  We did a million tests but his main recommendation was to see a naturopath who had helped his previous patient.  She put me on a simple diet and vitamin regimen.  She told me that this would take at least five months to clear and put me in touch with two other people who had nearly identical histories with Nasonex.  To make a long story short_ these two strangers helped me through what I now know was a serious withdrawal from this drug.  After a few months_ the headaches begin to disappear_ the shaking stopped_ and my vision was mostly back to normal.  Although we were all at different stages_ all three of us took a year to get to the point where we felt that we were almost 100% better.  I am writing this because I know what long-term use of this drug can do and I want to let people (especially parents) know that this is not a simple and harmless drug_ it is a powerful medication with potentially horrific side-effect.  Doctors will tell you that this is only anecdotal evidence but please ask them to produce a clinical study with trial subjects who took this drug for more than 40 days.

324, 1, Allergies,PLEASE read the three parts of my story if you are suffering from this drug,PART ONE:  Please do not believe that this drug is harmless.  I could write a book about the horrors this drug put me through.  My doctor prescribed it long term_ telling me that it was ï¿½harmless.ï¿½  I took it for just over two years.  At first it was a wonder drug.  I could breath through my nose again and I didnï¿½t have to spend my days with my nose clogged up.  I also gained 25 pounds in those two years (and Iï¿½m very active) but just figured that it was part of the aging process.  After about two years_ I started to have vision problems and would shake uncontrollably in the morning (right around the same time I would take Nasonex).  Shortly after this_ my vision became permanently foggy and I began to get headaches that forced me to book off work.  I suspected that it was the Nasonex but my doctor told me that I had anxiety and that I should see a shrinkï¿½he said that there was no possible way Nasonex could cause any of these side-effects.  As the symptoms got worse (constant tremors_ migraines_ vision problems_ insomnia_ night terrors_ voices) I decided to quit Nasonex.  Within a week_ I was suicidal_ depressed_ and so lost that I considered quitting the job I loved_ leaving the woman of my dreams_ and ending it all.  In short_ I had been a VERY happy and relatively stress-free guy_ and here I was_ ready to pack it in.  Within a month_ I had barely eaten and lost over 30 pounds.

I decided to stop taking Nasonex. The following night I came down with vertigo. Extreme dizziness_ nausea_ room spinning_ inability to keep balance_ etc.Week three: Went to GP and ENT and they said to keep taking the Nasonex. I went back on it and the symptoms got much worse. I could not stay balanced_ my head felt like it would explode_ and my sinuses were painful. Words cannot describe how bad I felt. I was sure I had a brain tumor or aneurism. Week Four: I am convinced that Nasonex is from hell. I quit taking it and over the next three days the symptoms lessened. I am into day 5 of being off Nasonex right now and I am still experiencing dull headaches_ and bouts of dizziness and nausea associated with vertigo but not anywhere near as bad as when I was taking it_Conclusion: This is an awful drug. I would say that the illness CAUSED by this evil in a bottle is ranked in the top 3 of the worst things that have ever happened to me physically.

During some bad spells_ I've been sneezing 30~50 times per day_ runny nose_ etc. Nasonex cleared it right up and so far has been very effective. I don't really like taking medications for fear of developing resistance_ so I will probably stop after a few days to see how bad it gets again_ but for now_ I've been very satisfied. I can now breathe with both nostrils_ sneeze once or twice a day at most_ no runny nose_ etc.On a side note_ I've seen some people complaining about the price of Nasonex_ and that seemed strange_ so I looked up the prices. Oh_ my God! I saw prices ranging from 50~100 dollars! That's ridiculous. Why is it so expensive in the US? I'm in South Korea_ and one bottle cost something like 3 or 4 dollars with a prescription. Of course we have a good national health care system_ so something like 60~70% of most medications are paid through insurance_ but that still makes it around 10 dollars without insurance.

349, 1, Constant clogging in one nostril,Horrible.  Thought I was having a flu come on late in the second week.  Sore throat_ felt like swollen glands_ blinding headache_ body pains and finally nose bleed.  Side effects are so bad they don't respond to Tylenol and was only able to get a few hours of relief when using 800mg of ibuprofen. Also trouble sleeping - like anxiety.  I have been off Nasonex now for 3 days and the headaches and throat issue have not subsided.  Happy I found this site because I felt like this was never going to end.,The reaction to this is so bad that I will likely never take a nasal spray again.  I think they need to do more trials on this product because the percentages of people they say that have the side effects don't appear to be consistant with how many people are posting problems.  This product should be pulled from the market pending further studies.,F,34,2  weeks2 sprays 2X D,7/19/2010,Nasonex

Meanwhile the other things were worstening. I became depressed and moody. Then I started with intermittant dizziness that grew into steadily worstening loss of balance. Then added to that I began to feel as though my head was swimming all the time. I was absolutley convinced that I had a brain tumor.,I stopped Nasonex..not because of knowing about it's side effects_ but because I figured that PERHAPS the reason for the migraines was dry sinuses_ and that the migraines were causing the other symptoms. After a week off Nasonex_ everything stopped.I feel normal. I'm glad I found this database! It totally validates everything I've been feeling since May. I have a stuffy nose_ but I feel normal again.

NASONEX has helped me somewhat for about a year or more.Reading these comments are suggesting to me that my almost constant anxiety; hyper tension and not feeling myself - (when reality tells me I have every reason to be very happy) could well be due to Nasonex.

378, 2, Nasal infections / cough / asthma,Headache_ burning in sinuses_ bloating of stomach_ nausea_ feeling depressed_ irritable and very tired_ muscle and joint pain_ ear pain.,First I am generally of well above average fitness and eat healthily. I began taking the spray after an asthma review with my GP in an attempt to improve my endurance and add to my fitness level. He was convinced that the persistent cough and chest infections I was picking up could be treated by stemming the post nasal drip I had suffered from for years (broken nose/operation to straighten septum with subsequent sensitivity to various triggers) Dosage = one spray in each nostril once a day. The spray quickly relieved the symptoms but I have progressively suffered from the afore mentioned symptoms. First extreme tiredness & headache (like I was coming down with a bug)_ then upset stomach and loss of appetite. In the 6th week_ I developed a severe earache in one side and joint and muscle pain in my back & legs. The headache & tiredness became more severe and I was given antibiotics for supposed infection.  I was unable to go to the gym or ride my bike (normally done 3-4 times a week). There was no improvement after a week and I decided to look on the internet for a possible cause. I was becoming more and more irritable and depressed with little patience and was even beginning to suspect that I had a serious condition developing. Imagine my reaction when I found this forum. Seems many of you have been there already.I see that several people have nothing but praise for the drug but for those of us who do react badly it is important to see why!,M,53,8  weeks100 mg 1X D,5/16/2010,Nasonex
379, 4, Chronic Sinus Infection_ Nasal Cyst,Did not have any side effects probably because I increased my magnesium while on this drug.  I've read on different websites that you are supposed to icrease your magnesium to about 200 mg a day while taking any corticosteroids because these drugs pull magnesium from your body and give you all the side effects that all of you are mentioning (anxiety_ headaches_ leg cramps_ nausea_ etc.)  This is probably why I am not experiencing any side effects is because I increased my magnesium intake.,Since taking this drug_ my nose no longer bleeds.  I no longer experience headaches or dizzy spells.  Also_ I don't sneeze as often or react as much to allergens.  This drug has been a lifesaver to me.  I do want everyone who has had side effects from this drug to listen to me - you need to increase your magnesium - I swear by this.  I've read about it on different websites (can't remember exactly which ones)_ but I was on different websites researching about Nasonex before I agreed to listen to my doctor and take this drug.  So_ the first day I started taking my Nasonex I immediately began to increase my daily intake of magnesium - using supplements - particularly Isotonix Calcium Plus (you can buy and learn more about Isotonix on the internet). I am not kidding you_ when I tell you that all the nasty side effects that many people have been writing about on this website are all symptoms of very low magnesium levels in your body.  Your side effects might go away simply by increasing your magnesium.,F,43,5  months 1X D,5/12/2010Email,Nasonex

I recently contracted a virus so bad I landed in the hospital with 104 fever_ chills_ dehydration.  I don't think the Nasonex GAVE me that virus_ but now I see (too late) that it can lower your body's ability to fight infection_ which explains everything.,F,53,3  months2 spritz 1X D,5/4/2010,Nasonex

And the same thing happened during my vacation in Hawaii last year... It ruined my holiday_ and I thought I had to go on anxiety meds. Totally irrational.  It only just dawned on me that it could be the Nasonex b/c I started a new round of them ~5 days ago_and am experiencing the same thing.

My throat wasn't sore at all_ but the swelling lymph glands and drainage were making it a little red. I'm certain I've developed a viral infection in the sinus cavity by the eye. Throat is secondary.

However_ it also dried out every other mucus membrane in my head -- eyes_ nose_ mouth_ etc.  Made my mouth unbearably dry -- gums turned white and swelled_ and tongue swelled up.  Roof of my mouth turned cold.  ENT said he never saw a side effect like this.  Had me tested for several autoimmune diseases (Sjogren's_ R.A._ etc.)Said it wasn't an allergic reaction (not seeing this ENT anymore!) 2 weeks later and still dealing with side effects -- going to dentist tomorrow to see how badly my mouth is messed up.  Gums around my teeth are starting to bleed when I brush my teeth.,"If it works for you_ great.

Stopped taking this drug. Going back to my OTC allergy med & natural remedies. Mild side effects may occur my eye! This stuff is scary! Thought I was going to have a heart attack last night. But strangely enough none of these side effects are listed on any websites when I was researching this drug. I am writing the FDA about this. Never again. Acupuncture & Yoga here I come_ don't need to be poisoned by Big Pharma anymore! Took this drug for 10 days last year & couldn't even breathe through my nose at all_ it was horrible.,A good way to flush this stuff out is make a warm tea of honey & 2 & a half tablespoons of red wine vinegar. Drink twice a day. When you start to feel better go down to once a day. It helps with sinusitis as well. I drink it every day.,F,41,2  days200 mcg 1X D,3/21/2010,Nasonex

I went back to see  my doctor but even him did not have a clue what was going on so he decided to prescribe some anti-histamine tablets which have not helped at all. The thought of swallowing anything is petrifying as it feels very much like razor blades cutting my throat to pieces.The breathing gets worse as the day progresses into the evening and then the sleepless night!

Dr. gave me a refillable prescription.,Went for a physical last month and blood pressure was in the danger zone 155/80. At first I didn't link it to Nasonex and just thought I might have to be on BP meds if this continues. Last week I started to look at nasonex side effects and found this site. I stopped using nasonex last wed and my BP are slowly getting better. Looked up nasonex's website and there's no mention of elevated BP as a side-effect. But if you look up side-effects of glucocorticoid steroids: irregular heartbeat and elevated bp is one of the major ones.

Along with taking Nasonex I am taking Singulair because of the sneezing I am having {Past year I have developed allergies}. Nasonex so far hasn't done anything bad but what people need to understand when reading comments by other people in relation to a drug is that just because a group of people had one thing happen to them it doesn't mean the same will happen to you. Reaction to drugs just goes by who you are and your tolerance. If your DR told you to take it; then take it. If it botheres you to the point it harms your day to day life then contact your DR and tell them the issue he/she will tell you what step to take next. To many people stop taking a medication given to them by a DR without talking to their DR first. I see it everyday in my pharmacy.,F,25,4  days2 sprays 1X D,3/6/2010,Nasonex

Im back to six miles a day running and free weights every other day with 100 situps and 50 pushups with each workout everyday. Im 49. I did this work out program since i was 17 and i was down to barely a walk two times a week. Nasonex was going to slowly kill me and i didnt even think it was that. I looked like i had track marks on my arms i was alway sick no energy and you can read the post on 1/24. The big difference is i purchased a netti pot at walmart for 14 dollars (neilmed brand its there only one) and after stareing at it for 3 days and thinking it would make me vomit or water was going to go in and explode my head i finally did it. And there is no going back to poisonex ever again. I cant believe how great i can tastes food and smell smells i have been missing. And my ears the big thing i can hear soooooo great i cant tell you how good it feels.They pop normaly i can hear highs,I will never use nasonex or any drug in my body for my ears or sinus ever again unless ther is a culture done and it shows a need for drugs.

Don't particularly like looking like Rudolph!

Dr. prescribed this spray. I gave it to him last night and today he was on top of the world today. Hugging me--constantly. Chasing his brother. Gave the dog a bath. Cleaned his room. Laughing at everything. Jumping around. Saying he woke up not feeling tired. Like he's on speed or coke. Weird. The sudden and dramatic personality change is huge. I don't understand why it is happening exactly_ but nasonex is powerful stuff. I'm not sure it's a good thing. He needs to breathe at night_ but he's freaking me out. He seems a little crazy and unbalanced. Thank goodness we are seeing an allergist next week. I would NEVER use this over the long term and MIGHT use it once a week. Might not_ too.,Sudden and dramatic personality change in my 8 year old. Fortunately he's a good kid and turned in to turbo-charged super boy rather than Mr. Naughtypants. But it's not normal!

I had all the proof that the nasonex was causing my problems but he really didn't believe me and diagnosed me with anxiety disorder and put me on prozac. My problems didn't start until i started using nasonex every night. I will never use it again and I wish I could say that my anxiety is gone since it has been like 6 since i stopped using it but its still there. This drug is evil.

446, 5, chronic allergic rhinitis,Initially a dry nose and a little blood but only in the first month. If I breath in too much I can taste it a bit in my throat. Small price to pay for the relief it gives.,After 3 & 1/2 years I was allergy tested and no reaction to the 40 main culprits. But still I was so bad it would lay me up in bed and take a day to get over after a bad attack and in-between bad bouts my nose was constantly blocked and/or runny 24 hrs a day. I would have to lay on my back so that it could run down my throat as I couldn't blow my nose often enough to keep up. Like having a severe constant head cold for over 3 years. Was continually taking allergy tabs and decongestant sprays to make me feel half normal even though the sprays aren't good for the nasal passages and the tablets never made a major difference.  The doctor prescribed Nasonex to try and it took affect after a few days. I BEGAN TO FEEL NORMAL AGAIN. No more bloodshot eyes or watery noses or waking up at night unable to breath. It is the best thing I have tried. No drowsiness_ sleep like a baby_ have a slow and steady heart beat_ my taste and smell is fine. I would prefer to know why I am so allergic but would need much more intensive testing. It really did help. From what I can read it seems to work best with allergy suffers. The side effects mentioned here sounds scary but I have not had a one and am very happy with how it has managed to help me. I still occasionally get blocked and still use a nasal decongestant but that is usually if I drop my doses.,F,49,8  months,1/15/2010,Nasonex

I continued to take it and could not sleep due to heart palp. The final day of taking it_ I did not sleep at all. I have stopped since the final day and I am still fending off against the side-effects - anxiety_ heart palp_ lack of appetite. I should say that my sore legs are a bit better.,I am going back to the Doctor's to get a antibiotic to clear the sinus infection. I am going to continue to use the saline rinse.

I have been feeling unwell off and on for the last two years.,I had not considered that the spray was the cause of my problems as I take other medication and put it down to a combination of these. However the last three months have been hell and I have visited the Dr on three occasion giving a large number of the symptoms already mentioned. I thought the depression and suicidal thoughts would have made them jump to action but they just gave me a course of anti histamine_ then more and very strong Steroid drops and anti biotics then another ultra strong steroid spray. All made me feel even more ill. Thankfully I found this site yesterday and am now trying to get through the cold turkey effect of coming off this drug from hell. I have been a long term user around 7 years I reckon. Still having some problems but it is only day two off the spray. Feeling more human already. Don't take it_ I have been through hell in the last two years and I was convinced at times I was going insane.,M,64,7  years,1/14/2010,Nasonex

Took an oral steroid a month ago (with antibiotics to try and treat my vertigo...didn't work)_ and had strange head sensations/pain all over.  I've been on Nasonex for a week_ and yes_ I am breathing much better_ but those darn sensations are back - and stronger than ever.  I also feel ""timid"" and anxious. I'm also losing sensation in my left hand...but that could just be carpal tunnel.  I didn't think turning 40 would suck so much.","I'm stopping this_ especially reading about all the side effects on here.  I would highly recommend a Neti pot for saline sinus irrigation instead of medical treatments for allergies.  I've been leaning towards organic-based healing options since I am discovering that doctors are ""trigger-happy"" in prescribing drugs before really learning about you.

A couple minor nosebleeds. My taste and smell are probably effected too_ but the anxiety is what is killing me. I also feel palpitations and am having some sort of breathing issue while trying to fall asleep.,"I googled ""allergies and anxiety"" the night before last while I couldn't sleep yet again and low and behold this website showed up. I am so thankful to have found it because I have been using Nasonex on and off for 3 years and am going through my second round of anxiety since then. I am just putting all this info together and stopped using the spray immediately. Last night was my first night not using the spray after using everyday for 10 days. I still had alot of trouble sleeping last night but managed to get 4 hours. I am still feeling anxious but maybe a little bit better. I am praying my symptoms go away.

462, 1, nasal polyp and associated snoring,Wish I'd read this site sooner. Soon after taking Nasonex I developed anxiety and an inability to sleep through the night. Also had the more common nosebleeds.,Cured the snoring after 3 months_ but at much greater expense.

463, 1, fractured nose_ swollen tissue,Head aches_ slight burning in nose_ bloody nose when blowing onto tissue paper_ insomnia_ depresion_ feeling 'spaced out'_ breathing difficulties leading to panic attacks.,I noticed side effects straight away. First was the slight burning sensation when you inhale it. You feel 'spaced out' for about 2 hours after taking it. Then for about 12 hours afterwards_ a dull headache. For 3 hours_ I'd be headache free. Then I'd get headaches again_ like almost a withdrawal symptom. This stems into the night_ causing insomnia. This has a nock-on effect of feeling misserable_ cranky and depressed. Whilst exersizing_ it took me ages to regain my breath. As I inhaled_ it felt like the walls of my trachea were touching each other_ causing me to gasp. Not being able to breathe lead me to having panic attacks.-------------------------------------------------About me: After fracturing my nose_ the doctor prescribed me Nasonex to reduce the swelling of the tissue_ allowing me to breathe. This spray hasn't worked_ and has messed around with my body. The panic attacks have happened twice during a work out_ because I couldn't get enough air into my lungs as it felt my throat's walls were touching each other. I've been on Nasonex for 5 weeks_ and nothing has improved. I find it more than a coinsedence that hundreds of people have had similar side effects_ which the manufacturers haven't told us. Nasonex is a waste of money (ï¿½7.50 UK)_ damages your body_ your life_ and DOESN'T work. Look at the overall rating people.,F,20,5  weeks,12/6/2009Email,Nasonex

Almost a similar feeling to having a spastic twitching nerve you can't control_ but only it's your heart. I have never been so aware of my heartbeat. It was scary. I was going to see my doctor in 3 days because I thought I might have a heart condition_ but started researching this drug since it's the only thing that's changed in the last month.",I rated it at a 4 b/c it has REALLY helped with my sinuses and allergies.

465, 5, Allergies/ Hay fever / Blocked nose,None_ except for a few slight nose bleeds,I had a blocked nose for over a year and I found it difficult to smell_ taste_ swallow and breath properly. This was due to allergies_ hay fever and asthma_ my skin was constantly itchy and I was always breaking out in rashes or hives due to allegens. I am very weary of any forms of drugs and used this medication carefully. I didnt take the higher dosage my doctor advised. I started off with one spray per nostral before bed. My nose cleared up within 3 days and I could finaly use it again. I then slowed my dosage to once a night every second or third day for the next 2 months and now I only use it if I feel my nose blocking up again or if my allergies start playing up this can be weeks or even months between each dosage. It has worked very well and not only cleared my nose but dramaticly reduced my hayfever and allergies they are almost non existant which has given me back a productive life_ I have so much more energy now and I dont feel run down any more. I think what may help some is to taylor the dosage to your own needs (you dont need overkill) and when you spray into your nose *dont* breath in at the same time as this will draw it into your throat and lungs. I also noticed if I aimed it wrong and sprayed the inside side of my nose I tended to increase my chances of a nose bleed now i make a conscious effort to aim it up the middle and have not had any bleeding since. Not all medications are for everyone but I hope this may help some.,F,42,11  months,12/2/2009,Nasonex

Crazy vivid dreams.  Dry cough and dry mouth.  Dizziness and palpitations.  Shoulder and wrist aches.  I suffered for 2 1/2wks with headaches thinking it was my vasmotor rhinitis.  I statrted to cough and couldn't stop coughing when I spoke.  My head would throb so much it felt like it was bobbing back and forth.  I stopped taking the Nasonex a week ago when I started on Leavaquin.  I am still tired and coughing.  The dizziness and palpitations seemed to have subsided. I am a very healthy person.

471, 1, cronic sinus infection,I have absolutely no sense of smell or taste after taking Nasonex for 2 months.  I just realized this last night; I called the pharmacist to inquire about the side affects of my meds.  She suggested Nasonex could cause loss of smell and taste.  I called my dr. this morning and talked to his nurse explaining the symptoms I was experiencing.  I asked if the meds would cause loss of smell and taste. She said to keep my appointment 10 days from now.  Stay on my meds. and then the dr. would evaluate my symptoms. She showed no concern. It was only after I told her that the pharmacist suggested that these symptoms could be caused by Nasonex that she went to speak with the dr. and came back saying that I should discontinue the Nasonex.,Your pharmacist is so much more educated on effects of meds than your doctor or nurse.,F,62,60  days,11/19/2009,Nasonex

I also had a recurring sinus infection. I did not think it was  the Nasonex so I continued to take it and my depression got worse to the point of having suicidal thoughts. Uncontrollable bouts of crying. I also started getting a bit aggressive. Someone told me that I must have been taking drugs. I laughed it off at first and then I read the report done by Jane Pauley on steroids in medications. She too was having the symptoms I was having. I confronted my doctor and he totally disagreed with me. He even wanted to put me on a different steriod. Sounds like ""Big Pharma"" and monetary kickbacks to me but thats another story.

He only takes Nasonex ... so after 10mths of Nasonex my child no longer takes it. I now have a hungry tired pleasant toddler with ""normal"" tantrums.

I also had a lot of anxiety at night and subsequently_ trouble sleeping (I normally sleep very well).  I went off the drug to see if that was what was causing the palpitations and sure enough_ they went away.  Then_ to rule out any coincidences_ I started using Nasonex again.  The palpitations came back immediately.  I went off it and will never use it again.  I have not had another palpitation since.,It worked excellent in clearing up my alergies but certainly some of us have side effects which are not listed on the drug itself.  Nasonex is not for me as the palpitations were really scary.,F,35,3  months,9/21/2009Email,Nasonex

496, 2, Sinus Allergy,As others have described I noticed the Hang Over effect. Also extreme dryness. I have tried this product 5 times and each time couldnt get past a week on it. It also cause the frequency of sinus infections to go up...(read the label),Did sure anything but make me feel like ive been partying last night,M,36,4  days,9/20/2009,Nasonex
497, 1, not getting enough air through nose,I can no longer smell anything!!! (Not even popcorn_ or bacon frying_ etc.)  My ability to taste has declined too.  My breathing issues have not improved so Nasonex has caused me more problems rather than help.,,F,55,2  months,9/19/2009,Nasonex

499, 1, Runny nose and congestion,Irritable_ cold and flu like symtoms_ waking up through out the night_ wet the bed during naps 5 days in a row even wet himself awake almost like uncontrollable blatter.,THANK YOU PARENTS FOR POSTING YOUR RATINGS!!!!!  My son was prescribed Nasonex for runny nose and congestion. He first started not sleeping_ then became very irritable_ finally he started wetting the bed during naptime at preschool. And I thought the bed wetting was an accident but after 5 days in a row and twice the last day it seemed like it was getting worse and no longer seemed as an accident. I feel so bad that I didn't protect my child and read about it first. I have even know about the side effects from the commercials and wouldn't take it myself. I will look up any meds prescribed from any doctor from now on. They get paid extra to push meds for the pharmaceutical companies.  Parents: don't trust everything they give your kids!!!! Doctors: please be more careful with our children!!!,M,3,3  weeks,9/9/2009Email,Nasonex

501, 2, Nasal polyps related snoring,Total and permanent loss of smell,I was prescribed this drug to treat my snoring problem by an ENT specialist to help shrink the nasal polyps which she believed might cure the snoring. After applying about 3 cannisters of it_ my snoring was cured. However_ I started to lose my sense of smell gradually without even realizing it myself until my daughter asked me if I could smell something really fowl in the house then. 5 years have gone past since then and I still can't smell anything at all. I told my ENT specialist when I visited her later over the loss of smell and told her of my suspicion of this dangerous side effect but she somehow did not agree with me. For your own benefit_ don't use this drug especially over prolonged period as you never know if you are going to end up like me.,M,58,2  months,9/2/2009Email,Nasonex

504, 1, Perrenial Allergies,I used to use this drug without any problem. It felt like it wasn't working so I asked the doc what else could I use. At this time I had an unrelated asthma exacerbation and was put on a high dose of prednisone for 3 weeks. I have been off of the prednisone for 3 1/2 weeks now and was feeling that Nasonex wasn't working so the doc prescribed Rhinocort. It didn't work well so I went back to Nasonex. I feel this second time around Nasonex caused heart palpatations_ higher blood pressure_ and aniexty. I didn't have these effects the first time. I'm wondering if the effects of the prednisone coupled with Nasonex is a double wammy for me. Prednisone can cause these symptoms too. I stopped Nasonex after 3 days intersparingly which is today (been 24 hours since my last sprays) bu I still have a 93 heart rate and 122/76 blood pressure. I usually have a great heart rate and lower blood pressure. I say both Prednisone and Nasonex are EVIL!!!

My headaches become more frequent and severe. I stopped using it immediately.,,F,59,7  days,8/16/2009,Nasonex

Still can't smell and I haven't used it in 21 days.  Now thjey are saying something is wrong because my spleen is enlarged.  Don't know if the two have anything to do with each other but it sure is a COINCIDENCE,DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  Too many doctors pushing too many drugs.,F,48,2  days,8/8/2009,Nasonex
507, 1, sinus pressure and congestion,I went to two ENT's because I had ear ache_ vertigo_ and severe nasal congestion. One diagnosed me with TMJ (???) and prescribed Nasonex for my congestion. Another ENT said it was middle ear infection. Took the nasonex sample for 3 weeks. The dizziness didn't go away. On top of that_ my vision was so blurry_ squinting all day_ had trouble sleeping_ had swollen lymph nodes_ difficulty swallowing_ unable to focus or concentrate_ headache_ just felt like my head was in a bubble (the hangover feeling everyone is describing). I stumbled upon this website (thank goodness) and tossed the nasonex immediatley. Two days later_ the blurry vision and dizziness went away. Slept like a baby. Feel so much better. However_ the muscles/nerves around my face are achy_ sore_ and tired. No pain just extremely uncomfortable. Hot compresses and massage help. Does anyone else experience this after they stopped using it? This drug is awful and it should be banned. I wish I had known about the side effects pri,Nasonex did relieve my congestion but the side effects are too severe. It's not worth it. I wish I had know about all the side effects before using it. I am exploring other alternatives to relieve my congestion. I am trying out natural products and they seem to be helping.,F,40,21  days,8/6/2009,Nasonex
508, 1, sinusitus,For the first week I didn't notice any side effects but then each succeeding day I noticed that a horrible taste would linger in my throat after taking Nasonex. Each day the taste lasted longer. I stopped taking the drug after 18 days but the horrible taste and weird sensations in my mouth lingered for over six months. I no longer have the bad tastes but I have not recovered my sense of smell and taste.,I definitely would not recommend this medication to anyone. Loss of taste and smell is heartwrenching.

513, 5, Severe allergies,None,For most of my life I've had terrible allergies at all times of the year_ so bad I couldn't breathe. The symptoms would last for weeks and sometimes months and then turn into bronchitis. I've even been hospitalized for it. Since I've taken nasonex for several years now_ I have had no (zero) such occurances. It's the best thing that ever happened to me--completely changed my life. I feel healthy.

Although I can't say for sure that these 'side effects' are caused by the Nasonex until I stop taking the drug and monitor over a period of time but it seems that it is a possiblity and I can find no other reason.,Unfortunately Nasonex has cured most of my allergy symptoms which is a dilemma_ the alleged side effects are mostly in line with others apart from the swolen ankles and the constipation. I have been taking this for two months now and all the side effects have built up over this time_ before hand I was healthy but with Hayfever!

His mood has been much improved with the alleviation of some of his allergic symptoms (poor guy)_ but he has slept horribly_ waking 2-4 times/night crying_ sometimes wet from sweat (the room is kept quite cool_ so I am assuming this is from anxiety/dreams- unusual for him).

Did nothing for the nose but definitely seemed to get the side effects. Stopped taking it for a couple of days and generally felt better. However doctor recommended I keep using it and symptoms returned almost immediately when I started taking it again. Have stopped now.

My doctor was VERY emphatic about not ""snorting"" Nasonex into my lungs.  Some people have said that they had  tight chests and sore throats.  This might be a very real side effect for some but for others_ the medicine should never get that far.  Lightly breathing in through your nose while spraying is enough.  DON'T spray and snort the stuff into your lungs like asthma medicine.  Also_ I found that after one bottle_ I switched to one spray per nostril--works fine for me and I can finally breath through my nose after years of nasal blockage.",M,,2  years,7/15/2009,Nasonex

Aside from the terrible symptoms I already listed a dr. diagnosed me 2 weeks later with 'steroid psychosis' after having a weekend-long panic attack that culminated in me almost going to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack. I was fine for a while but I still am dealing with anxiety - something I never had in my life until after using this drug (3 dr. visits in 2 months since using nasonex).

It did break up my stuffy nose_ but at the cost of feeling like I threw up pool water out of my nose even 20 hours later. It also caused a severe headache.

537, 5, General Pollen Allergies,Barely any if at all.,Personally i'm pretty sensitive to allergy medication. I've gotten depressed off of both zyrtec and claritin so i'm pretty weary about new stuff. I take nasonex on a must-need basis and have had about a 95% success rating with it helping my allergies for at least 2 hours. Afterwards I still feel better as long as I don't mess with my face too much and wash my hands regularly. Usually It works for 4-8 hours per single squirt (each nostril) under decent conditions. The only time it is less effective is when i'm surrounded by pollen (like my sister's porch....) I can't say anything about effects of prolonged usage simply because this stuff aint cheap when you don't have insurance and I'm also paranoid now since i've had so many issues.,M,23,2  years,6/10/2009,Nasonex
538, 1, Seasonal allergies,My doctor prescribed Nasonex for me after Flonase kept me very awake.  For me the most noticable effect at first was the difficulty in getting to sleep and staying asleep.  I had to sleep with the TV on to have something to focus my wandering thoughts on.  Then I would doze and wake about every 15-20 minutes all night long.  Other effects which I finally attributed to the Nasonex were_ dry sore throat; anxiety; depression; shaking & tremors; loss of appetite & nausea; shallow_ tight breathing; increased heart rate; dizziness; loud ringing & pain in ears; hot then cold flashes; feeling feverish all the time; somewhat irritable; blood pressure up slightly.  I thought there was something seriously wrong with me and started to examine all different aspects of my life to see what might be making me feel so bad.  On the fourth morning (today)_ just as I was reaching for the bottle of Nasonex_ it dawned on me that that was the source of my trouble.  I hope the shakes will stop soo,"Even though Nasonex cleared my breathing (for part of the day)_ the side-effects are not worth it.  I have gone back to using Vapo-Rub and irrigating my sinuses.

Note: I was taking Nasonex when I tried an Allegra-D 12-hour pill which spiked my blood pressure_ caused high  anxiety_ and sleeplessness for 30 hours plus.  Taking Nasoenx by itself_ didn't seem to bother me. I don't know if Nasonex increased my bad reaction to the Allegra-D or not.,M,63,14  days,6/1/2009,Nasonex

I took the first dose of Nasonex mixed with Otrivin (pediatric dose) perscribed by the doctor at about noon. Within a few hours I became very nauseated and then started deep belching and vomiting. This lasted throughout the night and finally stopped at around 2am. I will NEVER take this medicine again. I had no idea what was going on. I thought I needed to go to the emergency room. I then realizd that the only thing that was different was the Nasonex I had taken. My sinuses did feel better in the morning but NOTHING is worth how awful I felt. I finally was able to eat again in the morning. I've since asked friends and found similar stories. They need to let you know about this potential horrible side effect.,M,67,1  days,5/30/2009,Nasonex
542, 3, orbital celulitis & blocked sinuses,none,My 4 yr. old child hasn't had any of the side effects/symptoms described. Reason for taking: She had a hospital stay due to orbital cellulitis (infection of tissues around eye).  Six weeks later a CAT scan revealed there was still sinus blockage.  The ENT prescribed this (to be taken for 3 months) to relieve the blockage.   After reading the posts I will talk with my doctor again_ and am glad we will only be taking for 3 months.  Can't say I am satisfied or not because we probably won't do another CAT scan to see if the sinus is cleared.  Personally I would recommend NASAL IRRIGATION to anyone who has sinus problems.  It is natural and it works!!  It can be done with children and I will probably consider trying this with my child if she is willing.,F,4,1  months,5/29/2009,Nasonex

Anyone listening! DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. There is a natural remedy for allergies and it works much better than any pharmacitical garbage. Its called CAYENNE.

Spent 2 1/2 days in the hospital having a bunch of tests done on my heart. All of them came back ok. My Doctors ignored me when I tried to talk about my sinus and Nasonex theory.  Stopped taking it and don't plan to use it again.,M,42,35  days,5/22/2009,Nasonex
549, 1, Blocked sinus_ post nasal drip,Anxiety_ palpitations_ raised blood pressure_ tight chest_ pain/numbness in left arm.  Same as others_ I thought I was about to have a heart attack,Shortly after taking Nasonex I started feeling anxious and very tired_ then 2 to 3 weeks after starting Nasonex I experienced dizzy spells.  I stopped taking Nasonex just in case it was responsible and visited the doctor.  Doctor said my blood pressure was high (174/90) but said Nasonex wouldn't have caused it.  Visited doctor a week later and blood pressure was normal.  Doctor suggested I start taking Nasonex again_ which I did_ and two weeks later my blood pressure is back up - 172/95 this morning.  So I'm doing the same as other people and 'chucking Nasonex in the bin'. It did clear my nose though!,F,52,30  days,5/21/2009,Nasonex
550, 5, Chronic Sinusitis,Dry throat now and then.,Nasonex has allowed me to breath normally for two years straight with no serious side effects.  Taking this drug is not ideal but I can't imagine how I used to manage without it.  I have since dropped my box of kleenex per day habit and love the fact that I am no longer dealing with a stuffed up nose every single day.,M,,2  years,5/19/2009,Nasonex
551, 2, Sinusitis_ recurring URTIs,Depression_ irritability_ anger_ mood swings.,Nasonex is a love hate relationship. I have been on it before each time for a couple of months. When I am on it I no longer get chest infections or sinus problems and my allergic rhinitis goes away. However_ the other side of the coin is that I get moody_ irritable_ depressed and angry on and off. Withdrawal is especially bad. When I come off Nasonex I get really angry and moody. What does one do????,M,40,2  months,5/19/2009,Nasonex

554, 1, Allergies,My 7 year old son was prescribed nosonex for allergies.  Took it for about a week. Started to complain of back pain_ shoulder pain_ body aches_ head ache_ stomach aches.  The next day he is vomitting_ didn't eat all day(That's rare for him_ even when he is sick).  Extrememly weak that day and pale(probably from vomitting for half the day). Stopped the nasonex when he was vomitting and when he felt yucky just because his nose was the least of his problems. I thought he was experiencing flu symptoms. Two days later I start the nasonex back up_  on the first night he woke up in the middle of the night straight up talking for a while in a panicked daze(unusual for my son he is a heavy sleeper). In the morning he has a minor nose bleed. The next day I give it to him_ a little while later he starts complaining of back & neck pain.  I thought he was getting over it so I started worrying about menengitis or infection. Then it crossed my mind that he just started this med.  So I looked up t,Reading all the side effects it shouldn't be for sale.  I can't believe it got through the FDA!  My kids don't get a lot of side effects from any med. and they have been on a lot of meds.  I would have never thought that a nasal spray could have made my son so sick. I will now always check the side effects on this web site before I give anything to my family.  It's nice to see somebody who cares about humanity and not about the all mighty dollar. To bad it couldn't have been the Nasonex company.,F,32,2  weeks,5/12/2009Email,Nasonex

I felt like I was going crazy_ went to see the doctor who told me it could not be from Nasonex. I then found this website and stopped taking it - all side effects have since disappeared. Nasonex worked wonders in clearing my allergy but it made my life hell. Think I would rather have a runny nose than what I went through with the drug's side effects.

This is similar to what others have also written so I think it is safe to attribute this to the Nasonex.

My nose starting flowing like a fire hose.  Did anybody else experience that?  I don't see anyone else who listed it.  I stopped and started 3 times thinking that I must have caught a cold each time.

562, 1, for ear congestion,high fever_ vomiting_ low appetite probably due to stomach pain_ pounding heart_ sensitivity and fear.,My son was perscribed this medication over a year ago now. When we first tried it he got sick. We thought it was just a bug so we waited for him to be better. We tried it again and he got sick again. I still thought it was a bug from daycare. after a few weeks I thought we better get using it again. My son was sick again. we kept giving it to him and he just got sicker. He already has autism and other issues so we did not relate his accelerated behavior to this drug until it became pretty obvious. Later we found out he also has a heart defect. I am thankful we stopped using Nasonex before he had heart failure. We have never seen him as sick as when he was on Nasonex. It was very scary. Our ENT said he had never heard of such a reaction_ which made me feel a bit crazy. After reading this site_ how could he not know??

The addition of Prednisone (20mg/once a day) may be making the side f/x more severe (I AM NOT SURE on this_ I haven't consulted my allergist yet).

I can work and play outside and breathe clearly- without sneezing_ itchy eyes or sinus problems.  Here's the deal: I don't use this every day- I use it when my allergies first begin in early spring_ about once per day for a week or two_ and then stop.  My allergies are then gone for weeks or more at a time.  If they return_ I repeat the process.  It's expensive_ but one bottle will last me the entire season or even a year based on my usage.   By the way- I'm somewhat of a health nut and abhor medications of all kinds.  I take vitamins and eat pretty well_ and don't see doctors very often at all.

Had used it several times for less than a week with symptoms building up but five days ago after ten days use was the end of it for me.

I started it again and got the burning in ribs and chest tightness.  I've been off it for about two days now and I almost feel like myself again.

581, 1, Mouth breathing,My son has experienced extreme tiredness issues for 3 years now and recently had a sleep study. All came back OK except that he breathes through his mouth whilst asleep. I have sinus issues myself and when really bad make me very tired. The sleep specialist prescribed Nasonex to help my son sleep better. From the first day he was very aggressive. In the last few days he has been off his food and seems very depressed. Also he has wet the bed twice in the last week. My son has NEVER wet the bed_ even when he was first toilet trained as a two year old. I am SO angry at the doctor who prescribed this drug. It was so expensive but we are prepared to do whatever it takes to help his tiredness so we bought it. What makes it worse is that I always read the insert that comes with a drug before I use it.

The congestion appeared to be worsening and I was desperate to try anything. I finally went to the ENT. Within a few days of using Nasonex_ I was able to feel like a normal person again! I do still have a bit of sneezing/blowing but I'm also not sure what is caused this problem in the first place. All I know is that Nasonex is really helping at the moment. Only wish I had went to get it sooner. I know the people who are satisfied with a drug often don't bother leaving a review_ which is why I wanted to leave a positive review.

I should also mention that while I never had a nose bleed ï¿½per seï¿½ while on Nasonex_ I did notice blood in my mucus anytime I blew my nose (and that has never happened before). I cannot believe this is prescribed to childrenï¿½ I am sure they have no way of putting a lot of these feelings into words.

I found that I felt like I was just totally out of sorts_ and had great sense of being uneasy and somewhat nervous. I had great difficulty sleeping more than an hour or two at a time. This is very out of character for me_ as I am usually a confident person_ who is not nervous.  The circular that came with it did not say a word about these possible effects_ nor did my physician.

Also_ since it's a steroid it also causes facial hair to grow faster (not a big hit if you are a woman).,I am sad and at a loss b/c it does indeed stop allergies but at what cost? I am not going to continue using this drug b/c of these side effects that have taken me to multiple doctor visits and the ER on a few occasions b/c with the severe heart palpitations_ dizziness and vision problems I was not sure what was happening to me_ I now however know. I have stopped taking Nasonex and now the symptoms are gone!!!,F,28,4  years,2/4/2009Email,Nasonex
599, 3, Nasal Congestion,I have tried Nasonex twice.  Both times I have experience irregular acne on my face.  I only narrowed it down to the nasonex after the second time I used it.,,,24,2  weeks,2/4/2009,Nasonex
600, 1, Sinus congestion,I had many of the same side effects I just read about on this page. I had tightness in my chest_ heart racing (as high as 120)_ headaches_ dizziness_ foggy thinking_ trouble sleeping_ a burning sensation(like really bad heart burn)_ tierd_ chest was sore.  I had started taking a decongestant which caused my heart to race. My doctor then put me on Nasonex and told me it would not cause this.  So when it began racing again I was instructed by me doctor to go into the ER.  They ran all kinds of test and found nothing. I had to see a heart doctor who after reviewing all my testings_ xrays_ and boold work finding nothing wrong_ he and the ER doctor looked up Nasonex and said that though not often Nasonex could cause this because it is a steroid.  I had been admitted to the hospital and just got home today. I wish I would have found this information before.  I dont have insurance_ so this whole event is going to cost me.,You can always try it.  It did clear my sinuses_ but while on it I thought I had something seriously wrong with me.  Very scary experiance!!,F,32,2  weeks,1/29/2009,Nasonex
601, 2, Sinus infection_ headaches,Our son had been complaining about mild headaches frequently for the past several months. Our pediatrician felt that he had a sinus infection. Our son took nasonex_ one squirt to each nostril every night before bed for 2 weeks_ along with an antibiotic.I didn't notice anything really all that different at home_ but his preschool teachers actually called us at home after 2 weeks of the Nasonex and said how concerned they were about his behavior at school. He was restless_ wouldn't pay attention or do what he was told_ he was aggressive_ and just not himself. We told them that he had been on this steroid and hoped that was the problem. He stopped taking it after 2 weeks (3 days ago) and still is causing concerns for the teachers. We shall see what happens.,Didn't seem to change anything with the headaches_ continues to have them. Unsure if he ever had a sinus infection in the first place. We saw no benefit from taking this medication_ possibly a negative side effect,M,4,2  weeks,1/27/2009,Nasonex
602, 3, Fluid in middle ear,On it four days_ so far only experienced heart palpitations and one night I got a really high-pitched ringing/buzzing in my ear accompanied by what felt like an electric shock. Mild sore throat. I'll try it for two weeks and see if it works or if the side effects get worse.,"Like most people on this site_ I wasn't given any information on the drug. My doctor just handed me two samples and said ""spray once a day."" I asked her about side effects and she said there were none. If it's true that this drug causes all of these symptoms described_ I am very sorely disappointed in the manufacturer for hiding this information.",F,31,4  days,1/26/2009,Nasonex

Been off for 2 months. Heart palpatations almost gone. Still have shortness of breath. I was on sinus infection medication and just waiting to see if all the side effects go away or if I need to get the operation. Feel 70 percent better from being off nasonex. Symptoms slowly going away. Watch out for his drug!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also doctors_ ENT's also told me that nasonex doesnt cause these problems but they are obviously dead wrong! There should be legal action here due to the fact that these symptoms are not listed_ and doctors and ENT's are giving out wrong information.,F,28,365  days,1/25/2009Email,Nasonex

I will not give this medication to her again.,F,7,1  days,1/20/2009,Nasonex
606, 5, Dust mites_ grasses_ trees_ etc.,None,I had some of the worst allergy symptoms prior to using Nasonex.  Since using Nasonex_ I rarely if ever get any inflamation.

However_ I tried it for my allergies (I'm 37) and it gave me a severe headache.,F,3,3  days,1/11/2009,Nasonex
608, 4, Frequent sinus infections,None,I used to get sinus infections once every 6 weeks_ needing antibiotics and losing out on several days of work (and pay). After I started taking Nasonex 1 1/2 year ago_ this problem has completely disappeared and I experience no side effects. Only worried about using ANY medicine for prolonged periods of time though different ENT doctors have told me it's no problem with Nasonex.,F,44,18  months,1/9/2009,Nasonex
609, 1, sinus infection,insomnia_ nervousness_ anxiety_ loss of control and depression,I have been taking this off and on for about a month for chronic sinus infections.  I have been off of work for nearly a week and haven't left the house.  I felt like I was going crazy.  I feel extremely anxious and panicky.  I can't even function with my daily life or job.  I am extremely sensitive to medications therefore I stopped taking everything except my antibiotic and nasonex.  This morning I made a doctors appointment and was considering seeking counseling even though I have nothing out of the ordinary going on in my life.  I started researching the meds I am on and found this site and to my relief now know that it could all be caused by the nasonex. I will never take this again I would rather deal with the sinus issues than the anxiety and depression.,F,37,30  days,1/8/2009Email,Nasonex
610, 4, Ear Infection,Frequent nosebleeds.,My doc prescribed this to help an ear infection_ and it definitely dried up my runny nose within a couple days.

This is going straight in the trash and I will just deal with my slightly plugged ear.,F,42,1  days,1/5/2009,Nasonex
612, 5, Allergies,None,Been on it for indoor allergies_ 200mcg twice a day_ which is relatively high_ have not had any side effects. This stuff is great_ way better than anti-histamines. Steroid nasal spray are the gold standard for allergic rhinitis_ and now I know why. I think that while this site can be helpful_ people should also read about the clinical trials for nasonex to get a better idea of side effects. I read some comments implicating nasonex to psychiatric side effects_ which I found strange_ since it wasn't observed in any of the clinical trials that I've read and also doesn't make much sense because nasonex is a local application of a cortical steroid_ and thus shouldn't have any systemic effects. In general_ I feel like some people are blaming other problems that are unrelated on the drug they are taking_ but that's just my opinion.,M,23,30  days,1/4/2009,Nasonex

In 3 days I was on here checking to see if anyone else was having shakes and anxiety as I just had a feeling it was the nasonex. I didnt take any today and already feel a little better. I had only had 3X1 doses so Im hoping I will be back to norm. in a few days..and back to my flonase which never gave me any angst.

I have never suffered from high blood pressure as it has always been on the low side.  It took me over six weeks to get over the symptoms.

617, 1, Ear Infection-Reduce Adnoid Size,After taking Nasonex for several days given at bedtime. On about the 5th night(an hour or so after going to sleep)my son came into our room BURNING UP with a 102.3 fever and his heart was beating really really fast. We didn't make the connection_ gave him some tylenol which cooled him off after a bit and he seemed okay the next day. On the following night (tonight as I write this post) same deal. I gave him his two squirts at bedtime and an hour or so later he comes in here BURNING UP AGAIN!  HOT ALL OVER!  Temp 102 again and his heart was POUNDING OUT OF HIS CHEST.  That's it for this crap!  I'm saddened the ENT would prescribe this to him.  He should have said something about the possible side effects. This is SCARY. Thank GOD for this website and all the post I just read.  He's just now cooling off again from the Tylenol. We're just going to have to have his adnoids removed.,This crap cost us an arm and a leg. $88.00 for a teeny weeny tiny spray bottle.

618, 4, Sinus Infection,Loss of smell.,"This med has helped me in the past. I asked for and was just prescribed it again today. It had been 3 1/2 years since I used it. This time the doc seemed quite concerned and made every effort to make me understand it is a steriod with side effects. She suggested I research it on the internet. And here I am. What an eye opener! It wasn't until reading the comments that I was alerted to the possible cause of losing my sense of smell a few years ago. At first I had a constant smell of_ what I can only describe_ as a wet ashtray. Didn't matter where I was_ the smell was there. I couldn't get rid of it. I don't smoke nor did anyone in my home. After that went away_ I had no sense of smell or taste at all. It got embarrassing at times as I would be asked to smell this or that followed quickly by the response of_ ""Oh_ that's right_ you can't smell."" I couldn't! It took over 3 years before I got my sense of smell and taste back. I would like to hear from anyone that experienced the s",F,53,3  months,12/18/2008Email,Nasonex
619, 1, Allergy,Insomnia_ depression_ low sex drive,After having nasal surgery my ENT recommends that I take nasonex for the rest of my life.  I took it for several months and then stopped.  At that time I also had these symptoms but did not make the connection.  Then started nasonex again for about a month and started getting the symptoms again. I have now been off it for just over 3 weeks but still have some of the symptoms and am very concerned.  I hope some people on here can post how long it took for all the symptoms to go away after not taking it.  I am curious to see if the symptoms I have are truly related to it or if I am just being overly stressed about it.,M,38,6  months,12/16/2008,Nasonex
620, 3, Nasal Polyps & Congestion,Very high-pitched_ constant_ tinnitus (like 'cricket chirping'- only higher).,I am not 100% sure that taking Nasonex is the cause of this tinnitus.  However_ it only appeared after taking this_ so I think there is a pretty good chance it is the cause.  The Nasonex has worked to unblock my nose though.,M,48,2  years,12/11/2008Email,Nasonex
621, 1, itchy eyes_  nose and sinus problem,I recently had sudden onset of insomnia_ racing thoughts and intense anxiety during the night. Prior to this current use of Nasonex I had the same problems for at least a year.  I did an intensive sleep training clinic_ addressing anxiety and good sleep behavior.  At the same time of this treatment I had a respiratory infection and had my meds changed to address my asthma.  Near the day that Nasonex was dropped I suddenly slept deeply.  I thought it was the training working after 5+ weeks of intensively addressing the sleep issue. So_ about 40 days ago my allergist said my infection was cleared up and to go back on Nasonex.  Within days my sleep was disturbed.  So_ yesterday I decided to look over my calender and drug info to see if I could make any connections.  It is not indicated on the Nasonex information that there could be sleep or other behavioral disturbances so_ I NEVER SUSPECTED IT.  It clearly showed on my calender that use of Nasonex was consistent with the sleep and anxiet,If you must_ use with extreme caution and observation.  It is always important to journal drug use.,F,44,40  days,12/11/2008Email,Nasonex

I had to keep it dilated for 10 days to keep from having permanent vision loss.  Also_ Nasonex cost me $$ for eye doctor and anti-inflammatory eyedrops_ loss of work_ and lack any joy in my life.,I can't believe the doctor said there would be no side effects_ and I only took the child's dose (1 X day).

623, 4, Allergies,none,I think this stuff works best with just sporadic use. I had most of my allergies symptoms disappear after the second day_ so i stopped taking it. My allergies symptoms didn't reappear for about a month_ so I took one more hit and that bought me another month of relief.

653, 3, Allergic Rhinitis_ Post Nasal Drip,Dry cough at night_ sore chest_ sore nasal passages_ sore throat_ weakened immune system_ sleeplessness_ nervous tension_ inability to concentrate_ headaches,I was prescibed Nasonex because of hay fever made much worse by desert sandstorms where I live overseas.  I had no idea the spray is steriod related.  Lately I have come to recognize the severity of my hay fever problem_ and thought it was causing ALL of the above.  I started using the Nasonex more.  It does help the runny nose and sneezing.  The sleeplessness and nervous tension are something I have been aware of lately_ and it has been a mystery to me.  I had no idea that the cough I have now developed could be related to the Nasonex.  It is typical in a foreign country not to be told all of the truth.  I already use steroid cream very sparingly for occasional eczema.  I will never use the Nasonex again_ even though it gives the quick relief.  Thank God I found this site and can see I'm not alone.,M,40,12  months,9/15/2008,Nasonex

I started having problems after I suffered a miscarriage last year and my allergies went a bit crazy. I now have a very high allery to my cat_ dust mites and my general allery reading was 20 times higher than it should be.  The doctor said he had never seen such high allery results. I was getting severe headaches_ eyes were swelling up and terrible earache_ but nasonex has made me feel so much better.

She asked if he was taking a nasal spray with ""steroids"" in it. This is what caused the bleeding. (which she later denied saying). Took 2 years of test after test to try to stop the bleeding and ultimately laser treatment (she ""fried"" his macula"" and referred him to someone else. The bleeding finally stopped but He did not get his vision back because of the laser surgery.It was an absolute nightmare.

To top it off_ our son really only has mild allergies! We thought he had just picked up a stomach bug_ but after the diarrhea and stomach pains didn't go away_ and the other side effects started_ we sussed out that it was the Nasonex causing the problems. Thank the gods for this website -- it confirmed our suspicions. We stopped his dosage yesterday_ and hope to see an improvement soon. The funny thing is_ I am normally the one who is hyper-sensitive to medication_ and I have used Nasonex with no problems!

Worried about affect on growth_ immune system.  I will say that since he has been on this medication_ he has not had another sinus infection and although the runny nose remains_ its not nearly as bad and doesn't seem to cause as many colds and infections as before_ I just wish there was something else I could try_ I hate trading one problem for another.,M,3,1  months,5/27/2008Email,Nasonex

695, 3, chronic allergies/ear fluid,anxiety_ bloody nose,My six year old son was given this as a last resort after multiple medicines haven't worked for allergies/ear fluid.  This little boy has always had excellent behavior.  The first morning after receiving a nightly dose of this_ he had a meltdown at school so bad_ crying hysterically the teacher ordered me to pick him up.  He immediatly changed and began crying every day in school ( noone was picking on him) and wanting to come home because he missed me.  This is the last month of school and he NEVER acted like this before ever.  Almost like a different child.  Dr and pharmacist say this med is not sytemically absorbed_ so is NOT the cause of the sudden abrupt behavior change.  I am stopping it and expect his behavior to be back to NOT sad and anxious anymore.  His nose is clear in the morning_ but full and clogged by the end of the day.  Not worth what he has been going through side effects.  Dr refuses to accept that it even MIGHT be this medicine.  I am convinced it is.,M,6,7  days,5/6/2008,Nasonex

714, 1, nasal drip,My 3-year old daughter was prescribed Nasonex to help control her constant nasal drip/allergies. Though the medicine does seem to help control the drip to an extent_ the side effects are not worth the small benefit.  My sweet-tempered child has become irrational and angry with constant mood swings_ is anxious_ apparently is hallucinating_ and is having nightmares and night terrors.  As the side effects have gradually worsened_ I only recently put two and two together to realize it is the medicine.

If I feel jittery_ it's because I am nervous. If I can't sleep_ then I have...duh - insomnia. Don't buy into the hype_ people. If it fixes what ails you_ then good. Nasonex is a drug and is not a natural cure-all. Take it with caution and don't get paranoid about every little symptom.

While all seem to work initially for a couple of weeks or so_ I think all greatly contributed to excessive nasal dryness to a sinus already made dry by allergy (ragweed most likely suspect).  Decided to use non-medicated saline nasal spray several times a day to relieve dryness and also stopped all prescriptive nasal sprays. after about a week or so of almost constant nasal saline baths during the day and night_ appears sinus now on the mend. also took 1G of viatamin C on theory to reduce histamines in system.   no OTC oral drugs were effective except to disrupt sleep. oh yes_ also used a 50% saline solution diluted Afrin spray a few times when night time sleeping too disrupted  and very effective but very limited use due to rebound concerns.  will also be sure to use saline sprays and nasa,,58,3  weeks,3/18/2008Email,Nasonex

On my own I stopped taking all vitamins_ nasonex_ etc. last month and I started to feel much better. Last night I took Nasonex and all of my symptoms returned. It was like a nightmare all over again.

757, 5, swollen turbinates; mucus blocked,Upon each application_ a few moments of watery drainage from sinus into throat_ but that is the medicine itself.  Otherwise_ no side effects whatsoever other than the intended result:  The swelling of the turbinates decreases drastically over extended time-period usage.  This lessening of swelling permits partially dried_ partially moist mucus to pass out the nose from the sinus cavities.  Prior to one squirt of Nasonex into each nostril every day_ mucus was building up in the sinus cavities.  This was causing infections and bacterial growth.  This was causing further swelling of the turbinates_ which further blocked mucus evacuation.  Previously a vicious cycle_ but with Nasonex_ the problem is completely solved without any unintended side effect.,Dec2004:had a severe nose bleed_ deep within my sinuses.  Huge blood clot never fully evacuated.  Oct2005:could hardly breathe through my nose due to being 100% swollen shut in one nostril and majority swollen shut in the other nostril_ alternating throughout the day.  Rhinologist advised surgery to remove inflatable soft tissue on my turbinates_ leaving only bare bone: stretch my nostrils; stick knives up my nostrils to cut & scrape away the inflatable soft tissue.  CT scan showed the risks of not treating this immediately:  major infection deep in the sinuses could cross-over into the ear canal or brain cavity.  I learned about how the balloon-like turbinates act as a pair in opposition_ first the left side inflates while the right side deflates then the right side inflates while the left side deflates_ every several hours.

The only thing I worry about is that it will lose its effectiveness_ so every few months I take a short break from it.Nasonex is not an anabolic steroid. That's not to say it couldn't have rare side effects for a minority of people_ but it seems many people's imaginations have gotten the better of them.,M,29,1  years,12/21/2007,Nasonex
773, 4, seasonal sinus infections,Had been working great_ then I needed to refill the prescription now my chest hurts_ burning. I have read some of the comments and I am now going to stop using it.

774, 4, Mucus draining down back of throat,Did't know if related or not.  Thirstier than before and lots hungrier.  Of course_ eating more has led to weight gain that I was already fighting.  My migraines have increased somewhat.,The Nasonex has decreased the constant drainage down the back of my throat.  I was ALWAYS swallowing.  It would make me cough_ too.  Wake me up at night coughing.  Now I'm not sure what to do.  Keep going or quit!,F,62,1  months,12/20/2007,Nasonex
775, 1, Severly swollen nasal passages,jittery_ felt as if I were being driven by a motor one minute and tired and weak the next. Felt sick allover_ very nervous_ anxious and agitated. Fast heart rate and cough. Insomnia_ and a disgusting metallic taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth.,This drug is absolutely poision..I will never use it again. The pharmacy acted like well that is unusual for nasonex but I guess it could happen just stop taking it. So none for me today or ever again I threw it away_ I wonder how long it takes for this stuff to leave your system. Soon I hope!,F,32,5  days,12/20/2007Email,Nasonex

Parents report some similar agression but had not linked it to Nasonex dosing.  Thank you for this website_ I was certain his behaviour was due to this drug_ pounding and irregular heartbeats do not come from being over-tired.,F,56,6  months,12/5/2007,Nasonex

782, 3, NASONEX,I was prescribed this as I was suffering from buzzing noise in my ears day and night and Dr though it would help equalise the pressure in my ears.  I started to use this and it did stop the buzzing but the main symptom i exoerienced was my left eye twitched.  All in all it worked for me but I only took it for a week,,F,39,7  days,12/4/2007,Nasonex

784, 3, Congestion/Nasally Voice,My six year old son's pediatrician prescribed this for a nasally voice and congestion related to the seasonal allergy.  He has been taking it for about two weeks now and he has had no side effects for ear infections_ headache_ sleeplessness_ or stomach ache.  However_ he does seem to be more irritable and disagreeable since starting to take it.  This orneriness seems to heighten at evening-time before he gets his dose although he gets argumentative throughout the day now.  Not sure if his current disposition is related_ but thought it was worth adding this note since he is usually pretty agreeable and laid-back.  My son still talks nasally which could just be habit now_ but he is not congested at night now.  This is a big relief since he has been congested since he was a baby.  We'll continue for the few weeks the doc suggested and go from there.,The pediatrician said that the nasal spray does not enter into the blood stream like other steroids do.  However_ I don't understand how it can't to some degree since it goes into the tissues of the nose.  I guess I would look further into it if my son had the more severe side effects like some here I have read about or if he would need to take it all the time.,M,6,14  days,11/27/2007,Nasonex

I have never had an allergic reation to a medication & I have taken other steriods before_ like prednizone_ but I really thought this stuff was going to kill me.  I couldn't breathe for 2 days over Thanksgiving holidays.  I almost went to the ER.  My BP went up to 168/116.

After having read the reviews on this site_ I am going to stop taking it immediately and hope that these symptoms go away soon.,M,43,8  months,11/25/2007,Nasonex
788, 3, congestion,At first it worked great.  He could breathe at night and slept better.  After about a month and a half_ my son started getting nose bleeds.  We were told by our allergist to make sure we sprayed the Nasonex toward the outside of his nose which we do.  We also spray his nose with saline spray to counteract the nose bleeds which seems to help.  He only uses it once a day at night.  After two months of use_ he now complains of a sore throat and increased hunger.  This past weekend he had to blow his nose all the time.  He couldn't clear his nose and carried a tissue constantly.,We plan to keep an eye on his symptoms and take him off Nasonex if they continue.,M,9,60  days,11/20/2007,Nasonex

I am a very athletic healthy male and I suddenly developed PVCs.  In 3 years my doctor has not been able to determine the cause (nor have I) as I was taking the drug occasionally.  Recently I stopped using Nasonex after using it for several months and suddenly I am at ease.  Heart is fine.,M,36,3  years,11/13/2007,Nasonex
791, 1, Sinus infection/congested/ear fluid,My pediatrician recommended my almost 3 yr old daughter try Nasonex to help break up her congestion.  After I gave it to her_ she became like a different person.  Extremely hyper_ unable to focus and listen to our directions_ rough with her pets_ panicky at bedtime_ unable to go to sleep... very unusual for her!  In the middle of the night I realized this wasthe first time she had taken Nasonex.  I looked at the side effects in the packaging and none were listed like this.  Then I found this site_ and I can't believe how often this happens to young children.  Very scary indeed!,,F,3,1  days,11/13/2007,Nasonex
792, 5, Allergies,Severe migraine-type headache,Nasonex definitely solved my allergy symptoms immediately. I was constantly sneezing because I am terribly allergic to ragweed pollen. I take Claritin and do allergy shots_ but those weren't even working anymore so my dr. prescribed Nasonex.  After the allergy symptoms disappeared_ I continued to use it since ragweed was still high.  After a few weeks_ I began having a severe migraine-like headache which causes nausea and sensitivity to light and is not lessened with Tylenol_ Alieve or Motrin. I stopped using the product a couple days ago since my allgergies are better and I'm pretty sure it caused this headache. I would use this product again_ only I would only use it for a few days at a time_ or only as symptoms come up.  FYI... Flonase is MUCH worse about giving migraine headaches than Nasonex.,F,36,1  months,11/11/2007,Nasonex

I have never felt worse in my life. I even went to my doctor and asked what would cause this. I had an EKG done as well as blood work only to find out that I am in perfect health yet I felt like I was going nuts. He said the nasonex should not be causing this but after reading all of these comments I have stopped using Nasonex.

Wow_the fisrt night amazing results. It was first time I could sleep a full night without nose strips. o After about two weeks of use develop a sore throat. Within couple of days it was like I had an apple in my throat and swallowing became very painfull! I developed a very dry and painfull cough. After another week I started to getpains in my chest and what I had thought was very bad heartburn. My heart felt like it was beating out of control and I also thought someone was standing on my chest. So much for my good night sleeps as even though I could breath freely I was paying for this in other ways. I enjoy a cold beer and the other night I had one and it was one of the most painfull experiances attempting to swallow as it burned all the way down.I didn't make the connection with the spray but that is why I am posting this. I thought,I have had 3 nasal surgeries due a sports accident while in high school. This past spring  I had decided to seek advise form another Doctor as my breathing was terible especially at night while trying to sleep. When she looked ino my nasal cavity with a scope she suggested that past sugery worked well and she could no improve what had been done.

831, 3, allergies_ seasonal/pet,Have used off and on for a few years.  Just started using it again and after a week I noticed my right eye sometimes felt like it had glass in it_ and is very dry.  Sharp stabbing pain  in my right eye near my nose.  Blinking makes it worse.  When I sprayed my nasal passages this morning I immediately had another sharp stabbing pain in my eye and burning in my nose.  This caused me to suspect the Nasonex.,I had lasik a few years ago and my eyes are somewhat drier anyway now_ so I am probably susceptible to this.  I thought I was just outside too much in the sun/wind and my eye dried a little_ maybe I'm not hydrated enough and need to drink more water_ etc.  Now I am thinking this sudden onset of eye pain and extra dryness is very likely associated with the Nasonex.  I will stop again and see if the eye pain goes away.  Glad I found this site and that others have commented on the dry eyes.  Not a side effect that they tell you about in the literature.,M,44,7  days,8/15/2007,Nasonex

Thought I had the flu or was pregnant... dizzy.. no appetite.  Then I thought maybe it was my vision since I had the twitching.  Before I went to eye doctor I thought I'd check about side effects of Going OFF Nasonex.  What I've found is shocking.

I've taken everything from Alavert_ Sudafed_ Claritin_ Flonase_ Nasacort_ and Nasonex. I was so tired of spending money on drugs that had minimal effectiveness with_ what seemed to me_ maximum adverse side-effects that I decided there HAD to be another way to combat seasonal allergies_ effectively.  NOTE: since I took myself off of all the allergy medications and nasal sprays (almost 2 weeks ago) and started doing the following_ I have had no allergy symptoms_ no trouble breathing_ sleeping_ or smelling.  Here's what I do: buy Ginger root_ cut off a 1-inch piece_ peel and crush (don't puree)_ place crushed root in tea ball & steep in 8 oz hot water for 10 min's.  Drink it.  I do this once a day (everyday) after dinner about an hour before bed.  I wake up in the morning_ drink my coffee_ blow my nose and I'm great the rest of the day.  Absolutely NO SIDE EFFECTS!  It might take a couple of cups / days before you notice a difference_,F,37,1  weeks,4/5/2007,Nasonex
893, 2, Allergies & severe nasal congestion,Headache_ nausea_ upset stomach_ muscle aches_ sleeplessness,I made a visit to the ENT doctor after several plaguing months of sinus congestion and no relief from over-the-counter meds.  The doctor decided I must have developed some allergies as I have gotten older. She administered Nasonex in the office and gave me the sample to try.  It has only been one day of use and I could not sleep at all last night_ I developed a headache_ my muscles started aching and I felt like I was going to be physically ill. I thought it was a mild case of the flu.  I know it has been only one day but is it coincidence or not?  I am very leary now and going to call the ENT doctor back for suggestions.,F,38,1  days,3/30/2007,Nasonex

Doing that has avoided the throat so now I can just enjoy the benefits. It's a life saver in hay fever season.,F,51,3  years,3/17/2007,Nasonex

Reluctantly_ I couldn't fall asleep so I'm still up from yesterday (its noon now and i used it @ 10pm).  I can't figure out if this is better or worse.....but I'm not even tired.  My muscles feel wierd_ especially when i flex they get a little shakey feeling and kind of achey (it's hard to describe). I also can't taste anything and my nose is really dry (but sinuses are still stuffed up so i have a lot of pressure) and bled earlier and my throat hurtsa little. I dont know how long it's going to last but i want it out of my system... It did clear up my nasal passage_ but the experience was awful.IMO - It's effects are not worth the side effects.

The ENT doctor put me on Nasonex to help keep my ear canal passages free . And then one day I noticed I couldn't really see well out of my left eye_ I have agood freind that is an optometrist and he saw me right away. He sent me to a retnal specialist_ who diagnosed me with central vision loss due to taking Nasonex_ I was told to immediatly stop taking Nasonex. My ENT doctor had never heard of such a thing and had the specialist send him info on this. He thought the fluid that built up behind my left eye would probably absorb back into the body and go away on its own. But_ I have had 3 appointments so far with the retnal specialist and it has not gotten any better_ no worse_ no better. I go again in 5 weeks and if it is not better he will do laser surgery.,,M,47,30  days,3/2/2007,Nasonex

This summer_ my doctor prescribed nasonex and I have been taking it ever since.  This winter_ I haven't had a single cold.  This is like a miracle for me!  I haven't caught my boyfriend's colds or my office mates' colds.  The only thing different in my life is nasonex.  I don't know why this side effect is so opposite than the others' here who think it has weakened their immune system.  Also my sense of smell has IMPROVED on Nasonex.  I have been feeling a little dizzy at times_ not enough to bother me but it is good to know that others feel this too.

The pharmacist also said that I could take Nasonex with Singulair but that was a disaster for me --waves of anxiety and adrenaline. Am much relieved that others have had this experience and that I am not just ""stressed out.""

Whilst I don't seem to have any current side effects I'm concerned about the long term use of a steroid. If you have nasal polyps I would recommend the use of douches using water and a little salt everyday to help clear your nose and sinuses.

Had previously been prescribed Flonase but that spray did not help at all.  I later had a successful septoplasty done but this provided only a slight benefit.  After the surgery_ my doctor prescribed Nasonex since the surgery hadn't resolved my symptoms.  Nasonex worked instantly and has eliminated by headaches and made my congestion 90% better.

He started to have persistent stomach aches that stopped when he went off it_ and started up again immediately when he went back on it.  Still don't have enough information to know if this is coincidence or a side effect.,This really cleared up my son's constant sniffles and runny nose.

It took me a long time and much self experimentation over a period of several years of on-off use to finally positively identify a direct relaionship between Nasonex use and loss of sex drive and sexual potency. Beware of long-term use. Seems reversible over a period of several months of non-use_ however.,Nasonex (and surgery to remove nasal polyps) was a godsend initially. I went from 4-6 colds leading to bronchitis per year_ to maximum 1 cold per year. I miss sense of smell however.

993, 3, allergies_ chronic sinusitis,every few weeks suffered mild colds/sinus pain_ much more frequent than before taking Nasonex - not sure that it was the nasonex but after seeing another reviewer with the same problem_ I think it might be related. Did a search on google and came up with several results that claim glucocorticosteroids reduce immunity (t cells and immunoglobulins). Although this might make sense_ considering allergic reactions can be the result of overactive immunoresponses to what the body perceives as 'allergens' (and g-steroids would thus dampen that response)_ I think more research might nevertheless develop a link between g-steroids and increased infections. Since my sinus infections are MUCH worse than allergy symptoms_ I've stopped taking this drug. Anyone else who experienced similar problems_ rate away_ I'd love to hear any similar experiences.,it definitely works for allergies_ sneezing and runny nose_ no doubt_ but I'm afraid it may be reducing my immunity. stopped it.,,21,5  months,12/30/2005Email,Nasonex

I suspect the inflamation caused by the allergies were triggering migraines.,F,42,2  months,3/8/2005,Nasonex

1013, 4, Chronic stuffy nose,I have a terrible metallic taste in my mouth and a burning sensation on one side of my tongue - tongue is sensitive too.  When I eat or drink anything the burning is worse and it alters the taste of my food.  It's so unpleasant that I can only used this medication for a couple days and then I have to stop.  When I stop_ so do the side effects. If not for the side effects I would love this stuff.,It does work. It says that it can take awhile to work but it works for me right away. But I'm not sure what's worse_ the stuffy nose or the horrible thing it does to my tongue.,F,43,6  months,2/20/2005,Nasonex
