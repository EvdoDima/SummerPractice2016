0, 5, Birth Control,May have had weight gain but I took another medication with that side effect so I don't know. Still had cramps but only for a day or two and they weren't unbearable.,This was amazing! My periods were short and I always knew exactly when I was going to get them because they came like clockwork on their expected days. I was switched from Loestrin to this one without feeling any sort of change at all. I am now on Junel because new insurance does not cover minastrin and my period is neverending. Going on 9 days already. I hate it.,F,23,2  years,4/19/2016,Minastrin 24 fe
1, 1, Birth Control,This gave me really weird mood swings and appetite problems_could barely eat.Worst of all I was so scared I'd have a heart attack!The heart palpitations are ridiculous after the first two weeks and random depression was not worth continuing this pill.,,F,21,3  weeks1mg,3/13/2016,Minastrin 24 fe
2, 1, Birth control,Switched after loestrin 24_ was not the same. Weird bad angry moods.  Vaginal Dryness_ with and without recurring yeast/bacterial infections _ dr said to give it 3 months to adjust _ by month 3 I was pregnant. Was taking this while pregnant _ 2 weeks before I found out luckily baby is fine.,Doctors love to push this pill_ but it's the devil.,F,,4  months,7/20/2015Email,Minastrin 24 fe
3, 1, Birth Control,Headaches_ depression_ anxiety_ weight gain_ chest pains_ vision problems_ insomnia,This should NOT be on the market. Google negative side effects for minastrin and there are DOZENS of women who are experiencing all of these side effects and more. This pill should be pulled immediately,F,39,3  months,6/30/2015,Minastrin 24 fe
4, 1, Birth control,Major hair loss.  I just stopped taking it today_ so I have no idea if this can be reversed.  But my bathroom drain looks like it has a guinea pig in it.  Sooo sad!!!  I got super depressed on it too.  Couldn't figure out why the heck I was so down.  Then it dawned on me.  I know everyone reacts differently_ but this one is NOT for me!,,F,36,15  days1 pill 1X D,12/1/2014,Minastrin 24 fe
