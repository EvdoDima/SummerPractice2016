0, 1, resistant bacterial infection,Sleeplessness_ tendon weakness and pain in shoulders_ either tendon or cartilage weakness and pain in knees_ RA pain went from about a 1 to 10 overnight_ tendons or ligaments in foot made foot feel like it was badly sprained_ I would barely move for the 14 day course. My tendons all were snapping_ my neck made scary cracking sounds when I moved it. It's been 3 mos since last pill and have some healing but still can only function at about 25% of pre-poisoning by Levofloxacin. I feel fortunate when I read others who are suffering so much worse than me.,This along with all drugs in same class_ Cipro_ Levaquin_ and many others_ should NOT be used unless a culture of the bacteria proves it is needed_ that no other antibiotic will work. Even young  people have dies or become disabled_ and often with excrutiating pain that only high doses of opiates will alleviate_ and docs will not prescribe that. Taking OTC NSAIDS very often worsen these horrible side effects and some people have been suffering for 20+ yrs.,F,66,14  days500mg 1X D,3/4/2016Email,Levofloxacin
