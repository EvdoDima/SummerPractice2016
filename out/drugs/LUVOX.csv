0, 3, OCD/ Compulsive Skin Picking,Weight Gain,Gained 14 pounds in 8 weeks_ but it makes the physical tension I feel from my OCD go away so it's worth it. Missed one dose by maybe 17 hours though and I had a mental breakdown and self harmed_ very rare for me. I'm also in the process of life changes_ so it might not even be from Luvox.  Like any drug it'll work different but so far this is my 5th medication and it's actually working.,F,23,3  months200 mg,5/26/2016,Luvox

3, 4, Anxiety disorder,Drowsiness_ it's recommended to have it at night just before you go to sleep. Sometimes headaches but just mild headaches and mild dizziness.,So far_ it works on me. No terrible side effects.According to my doctor I need to take it for 6 months. I have improved a lot. I can walk in public now and I can survive in crowded places. But then again_ different people might have different reactions to this drug. If you are very sensitive to medicine_ like me_ my doctor advised me to take half of it (for my case insted of 30 mg_ I took 15 mg) then after a week or two_ you can take 30 mg.,F,24,2  months30 mg,4/11/2016Email,Luvox

Doctor thought this pill would be perfect for me but instead ruined me. I don't want to say this pill won't work for anyone because I'm sure there are success stories with it_ my body just so happens not to like it!,M,17,2  days 1X D,3/20/2016,Luvox

But I think it is not because of the medicine_ I think it is because of my condition.",Wonderfull medicine for OCD. If you are very out of your mind_ wait_ at least_ 6 months. Don't worry about the initial symptoms. Most of them are because of our conditions. If you give this medicine to someone that does not have any condition_ that person_ probably_ will not feel any colateral effect (my brother is an example of that). The best thing of it is that it affects almost nothing the libido. In my case_ it increased. Because I was with a lot of obsessions thoughts about sex in general. I was hypochondriac about being affect by some disease in a relationship.. I'm still increasing the dosage until I find the best for me. I will wait more to see if 125mg is the perfect dosage for my case.,M,28,8  months75n/50d 2X D,7/5/2015EmailHistory,Luvox
9, 5, OCD_ Generalized Anxiety,Severe anxiety and constant panic attacks initially while the drug was beginning to work_ then non really except loss of libido and occasional tiredness,"Luvox has been a godsend for me. I have tried many other antidepressants but none have compared to Luvox. Luvox has been the only drug (and trust me_ I've tried many - antidepressants_ antipsychotics_ mood stabilizers_  etc.) that I can say has really been beneficial in treating my OCD. I would often get stuck in rituals that would take up hours of time and cause a great deal of distress_ but since being on a high dose of Luvox I have been able to better manage how much time these rituals take_ how much anxiety they cause_ and the frequency. I've also found that I've had a more ""appropriate"" response to things that would normally set me off_ probably due to my lower generalized anxiety level. My OCD was severe before Luvox_ interfering with driving_ leaving the house_ typing_ and even sleeping for a reasonable amount of time. Luvox has given me more control over my OCD symptoms and I'm able to calm myself down easier. The only thing I don't like _ is that the depression seems more prominent_ even though I'm on 300mg of an SSRI. This could be because the depression is ""unmasked"" -  I've opened up so much of my time where I would normally be doing rituals and have in fact found that these rituals have prevented me from becoming active and developing friendships_ etc. Other medicines I would dread taking because of side effects_  but with Luvox its like taking a pill that only works for OCD. It's nice to have something that works_ helps_ even if it doesn't wo",M,17,2  years300MG 1X D,6/13/2015Email,Luvox
10, 5, Depression anxiety OCD,No side effects,This medicine has worked wonders for me. I feel more like myself than ever before.,M,42,3  days150,6/9/2015,Luvox
11, 1, OCD_ Anxiety,Panic attacks_ Extreme OCD_ Fixation on specific thoughts or objects_ Extreme blurry vision,"At first it worked wonders for me. Helped my OCD greatly. I was finally not afraid to shower_ I don't have a water phobia or anything but the way water felt on my skin was always gross like a creepy crawly sensation. I hated getting wet and feared my overly annoying OCD shower routine anyway. So that went away with this med and so did the need to repeat actions 3 times or have labels facing a certain way but my 100% perfect vision went to being so blurry I could not read a street sign 10 feet away from me. I felt high_ floaty_ spacey_ like I was in a daze. Then things returned to normal_ vision returned_ no more high feeling but I started getting 3-8 day long panic attacks every time I took this. I would literally sit in my bed for 3 days straight repeating a thought over and over like one line of a song would be stuck on repeat like a broken record to the point I was catatonic_ could not answer people's questions_ It would take me five minutes to say ""uh...uh...are....are.....weeeeee.....uh.......going to........walmart?"" I checked myself into the psych ward for 5 days over this crap.",F,29,3  years100mg 1X D,5/6/2015,Luvox
12, 4, Anxiety and depression,Weird smells_ nausea_ weight loss_ heavy periods_ tiredness_ anxiety in morning when waking up.,Side effects took months to disappear but then I felt so great I wanted to go off it. Bad idea. Looks like I need to stay on it a bit longer.,F,40,4  years100 mg,4/14/2015,Luvox
13, 5, Social anxiety_ OCD_ bipolar depres,As a result of taking Luvox_ I have some pretty strange dreams. I also have night sweats. The most bothersome side effect is an almost complete loss of libido. like others have said_ I can sleep for almost 20 hours straight. I don't know how much of that is medication-related or overwork-related though. I will add that the withdrawals are almost immediate if I don't take my dose within 24 hours_ and they are almost intolerable.,This drug is a lifesaver! It makes all the side effects worth it. I used to be unable to leave my house due to social anxiety_ live with chronic suicidal thoughts_ spend hours picking at my skin_ and have paranoid delusions related to bipolar disorder. I can deal with night sweats and loss of libido_ but I can't deal with the aforementioned symptoms.,F,34,9  years100mg,3/9/2015,Luvox
14, 4, OCD_ Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Apathy_ Depressed Mood_ Lost of Interest_ Fatigue (Severe at times - have to take a nap everyday around 2-3pm),"I've tried just about every SSRI_ antipsychotic (atypical and typical)_ mood stabilizer (anticonvulsants)_ SNRI and other type of drug to treat my OCD. My level of generalized anxiety is so high and I spend most days locked in compulsions. I was pessimistic about Luvox (knowing that it's an SSRI - which have never TOUCHED my anxiety even at above recommended max doses) but I must say I'm impressed. Going up on it until you get to the dose you want to get at is living hell (almost a constant panic attack around the clock_ nausea_ etc.) but once you're there your anxiety level drops like a rock. I still have a ridiculous amount of anxiety and OCD but at least I can somewhat sort-of painfully function of Luvox. The combination of this and Vyvanse is what is getting me through high school. I have noticed since taking Luvox I've been depressed_ just ""sad"" about where I am in life and my future and its kind of depressing. I cry sometimes. At least I can function. Im worried though because it being just an SSRI means it can ""poop out"" at any time. I think thats already happening - my compulsions are becoming more intense. Maybe this is just the ""new normal"".P.S. My first psychiatrist had me on Xanax 3 times a day_ just to give you an idea of how bad my anxiety was. It helped_ but come on 3 times a day and I'll buildup a tolerance in no time.",M,17,1  years125 2X D,2/20/2015Email,Luvox
15, 4, OCD,Increased sweating_ very hard to reach orgasm_ heavy period_ easily bruised_ tiredness- could sleep 13 hrs and not wake up. I am on 40mg of adderall and could still take it and fall asleep.,It does help my obsessive thoughts_Anxiety and skin picking. So far the most normal I have felt. The sexual side effects suck though,F,29,9  months150mg,1/27/2015,Luvox
16, 5, OCD (Multiple Subsets),Honestly_ none that I notice. Sexual side effects in beginning_ but they cleared within 3 weeks. Was sleepy during day so switched to night dosing and this helped greatly. I take whole dose at once.,This has been amazing in helping with the OCD symptoms. I never knew what it felt like to be 'normal' until this was introduced to me.,M,31,2  months200MG,1/12/2015Email,Luvox
17, 4, OCD,"I was put on this to deal with obsessive worrying and obsessing that was ruining my life. My niece had just started taking it and I asked for it . At first I was taking it at night and it gave me wild dreams. I switched to morning and the nightmares stopped. Started working on my obsessing within 2 weeks. It's been amazing. I'm bipolar and it didn't make me manic which is good. Only complaint is I think I'm a little ""eh"" about everything. I am not worrying all the time but I almost seem to not care about anything that much. I'm not depressed.... Just sort of ""there"".",,F,38,1  months50,12/15/2014Email,Luvox
18, 1, OCD and Depression,Frequent suicidal thoughts_ worsening of depression_ anger_ irritability_ uncontrollable fits of rage_ anxiety.  But my OCD totally went away.,This drug is dangerous.  I went from having OCD and some depression to having crippling anxiety_ uncontrollable fits of rage_ frequent (3-4 times a week) serious thoughts of suicide.  My doctor added CLONAZEPAM 0.5MG TABLETS to help control the anger and rage but it only took the edge off.  My OCD went from a 9 to a 0 on a scale of 1-10 but it wasn't worth it.  Finally_ after 9 months of being completely out of control_ my doctor suggested I have a mood disorder_ like bi-polar disorder.  Now I know that's not true so I suggested he take me off these evil pills immediately.  I have been tapering off these pills for 1 month so far and have been sick the entire time.  Moods are better_ but tapering off as my doctor instructed has led to vomiting_ nausea_ brain zaps_ dizziness_ depression_ uncontrollable crying_ fatigue_ hallucinations_ and more (but less frequent) rages.  I'm finally completely off of both prescriptions now and am back to having only slight OCD (about a 1.5 on a scale of 1-10).  My stomach is still iffy and I still cry easily.  I wish I'd never heard of this medication.  I have also lost all faith in my doctor and won't be seeing him again.  This has been the worst experience of my life and I no longer trust SSRI's.

20, 3, Depression Panic Anxiety,This is one SSRi that did upset my digestive system. Watch out for loose stools and be careful when you expel any gas. I had a bad experience at a friends house and had to clean up in the bathroom.,Seemed to be very_ very strong for serotonin. Made me feel manic at times like I just couldn't stop shopping and spending money.

But the extreme stomach problems and weight loss made me stop taking it.  It looks like she had me on too much at 300 mg per day.  I'm about ready to go crazy here and feel I need to get back on.  I think I will ask for a smaller dose than 300 mg.  Maybe my system could handle it.  Again - this stuff really knocked the OCD_ counting and depression out of me.

With having OCD_ a ""regular"" antidepressant missed the mark (I tried many...Zoloft_ Prozac_ Paxil_ Celexa).  With Luvox_ my obsessive thoughts are so much more under control.

28, 3, Pure OCD,Very tired all time (12 hours sleep not enough)_ paranoid at times_ reduced creativity (felt like my imagination was suppressed)_ Sugar craving ( I don`t know if this drug caused this but I was always wanting to eat candy_ and was never like that before taking the drug)_ I gained weight over time and used to be extremely slim which was a bit upsetting (Also_ do not know if I can blame luvox only as it was probably a combination of that_ being tried all the time and playing too much xbox). Also this drug increases aggression drastically_ and it has been proven to be associated with an 8.4 times increase in violence compared with other antidepressants (check out wikipedia).,Probably the most effective drug for OCD_ but comes with side effects. You can avoid being tired all the time by not drinking caffeine! My psychiatrist did not tell me that this medication inhibits caffeine by 5X. Check it out at wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluvoxamine So drinking one cup of coffee is like drinking atleast five. Avoid any caffeine at all costs! I have done a lot of research on this drug_ and it also acts like an antipsychotic_ by reducing dopamine in certain parts of the brain. So yeah_ it has antidepressant and anti psychotic effects which both help for OCD. It does this through being an agonist of the o1 receptor agonist. Also_ start the dose at 25mg for a week_ then 50mg for a week_ and then 100 mg. I went above 100mg and there is not any additional benefit_ so going all the way up to 300mg just seems a bit like a waste of money. Up to you though. This is strong medication but when used with care can work really well for OCD. It also has quite a lot of side effects and drug interaction which you might want to look out for. Also_ withdrawal is horrible. Makes you feel detached from reality and cannot concentrate or even think clearly. So yeah_ good luck.,M,16,7  years50mg X2 2X D,9/22/2013Email,Luvox

30, 1, OCD_ depression_ anxeity,I took Luvox Cr for a coarse of 7 months_ september 2012-april 2013. While on luvox I felt every sedated and apathetic. While I was on 100mg I would sleep most of the day .I experienced emotional blunting side effects. And stopped caring I eventually dropped out of college due to fatigue and my inability too keep up because of the mental problems with luvox .I am now weaning off luvox and I am on 25 mg and still deal with sedation and mild emotional bluntness. Before taking ssrI I believed medication. Was going to help me greatly but now I believe Erp therapy to be the way to deal with ocd (pure o) sexual obessions.

32, 2, OCD,Immediate side effect was stomach discomfort. Went away within about a week. After two weeks_ had great difficulty reaching orgasm if at all. Dropped to 12.5mg on days expected to have sex. Still could not orgasm. Extremely frustrated. I want my OCD GONE but I want my extremely gratifying intimacy with my husband back. PLEASE....can't science do any better than this??!,,F,51,3  weeks25 mg,3/26/2013,Luvox
33, 5, OCD_ Anxiety,The primary drawback I have experienced is reduced libido and difficulty with orgasm. It is definitely something to take into account if you need more than 100 - 125 mg per day. However_ maintaining a high level of physical activity (weightlifting and walking for me) seemed to offset the side effects significantly.,The side effects worsen with dosage increases. Fortunately it actually does what it says it does. For me at least_ it eliminated all anxiety issues and reduced compulsive thought patterns by at least 75%. Even under significant stress I can still get through really bad days w/o anxiety attacks and minimal compulsive thought patterns.,M,55,15  years150 mg 1X D,3/7/2013Email,Luvox
34, 4, Obsessive thinking_ GAD_ depression,Initially some nausea and headaches_ but tolerable. Went away after a week.,Where all other AD's failed_ Luvox managed to stop the obsessive thinking dead in it's tracks within a few days and lifted the depression. For anxiety it lags a bit behind and I had hoped for more_ but you can't have it all I guess... I can't tolerate a higher dose than 50mg because upping to 100 made me -still after a month- feel suicidal. Not a miracle drug but it definitely made me feel better. The good news is that it doesn't mess with sexual function at all. I tried to quit recently_ but after two weeks I felt just as bad as when I started. So now I'm back on it again for a week and I already feel the benefits.,M,58,6  months50mg 1X D,2/11/2013Email,Luvox

39, 4, Depression,Insomnia only,Took it back in 07 after other initial ssris became gradually less effective (ie zoloft_ lexapro).   It made my mood at least a 9/10  and my libido skyrocketed.   Not only no sexual side effects compared to the other ssri  (this is documented in literature)_  but actually enhanced it.  Had to go off due to getting severe insomnia on it.   I just could not get to sleep and would have to take medication each night to initiate sleep.  I rated 4 instead of 5 only due to the insomnia and apparently this is not a common effect.  Rather_ its more common to get sleepiness and hence PM dosing is suggested.  So its definitely worth a shot.,M,28,30  days150 1X D,11/20/2012Email,Luvox

I rather have low sex drive then continue feeling depressed and obsessive thoughts that i want to die.,I LOVE LUVOX! Luvox have saved my life for the past 11 years. I have been on Zoloft in the past which was good with the combination of Prozac_ but after 4-5 years the combination stop working. Once_ i got started on  Luvox 11 years ago_ my depression lifted and also the thoughts associated with OCD within 6 weeks. I had to be very patient. Thank God for a supportive family and co workers at that time.  I completed therapy also with the addition of Prozac 20 mg. to be taken with the LuVox. I have also taken Luvox CR that work well also for a short time_ but it is very expensive and i had to return to regular Luvox. I am currently taking a dosage of 150 mg of Luvox with 20 mg. of Prozac daily and continue feeling GREAT. I am careful with other drugs that may interact with Luvox_ because once certain drugs interact with Luvox_ it takes a some days (unknown amount) for the Luvox to start working again. I love Luvox and pray it never stop working. I am a person who will have to be on antidepressants for the remaining of my life_ because i of the three episodes of depression i have experienced from the age of 21 to presently.

I have taken celexa_ lithium_ seroquel_ abilify and trazodone all at wildly varying dosages. Luvox is a miracle for me.,F,27,30  days100 1X D,5/13/2012,Luvox
55, 5, OCD/Anxiety,Old luvox... Weight gain_ problems with reaching orgasm at times_ occasional heartburn_ always had to be drinking something.On old luvox for about 9 years. Stopped taking it after being on only 25 Mg a day for 2 years. Totally off for a year. Owning a business and working odd jobs to stay afloat in this economy made the OCD/Anxiety return. Started 50 Mg of CR 3 days ago. Side effects_ some muscle twitching and the wierd_ vivid dreams. Although_ these dreams seem to only happen when I'm in that half awake state in the mornings and drift back to sleep before the alarm clock goes off.For people that say it's doing nothing_ give it a month. Some people feel better from the start. Others_ it can take about 30 days. It doesn't work for everyone nor do other ssri's. That's why there are different ones. But give it a complete chance.Attitude does play a major roll. Keep it positive. I've spent many years coaching people with anxiety disorders and teaching relaxation techniques. When I was first diagnosed_ my Dr thought I'd be a semi active recluse at best. By not giving up_ learning that I could contol this brought the fighter out in me I once had. All anxiety disorders can suck the life out of you and bring on unpleasant physical problems_ also. Fight it! It gets worse before it gets better_ but fight!,,M,43,10  years50 Mg,5/7/2012Email,Luvox

58, 3, generalized anxiety disorder,sleepiness: I'm not sure how much to blame on Luvox because I take Topomax and Xanax too but I think Luvox contributes to the fact that I'm always fighting exhaustion. sexual side effects: Luvox is much better than some other SSRI's but still lowers my libido and and makes it harder to get an erection and harder to come.,The side effects are the problem. Luvox does an excellent job of managing my anxiety and depression. It's no help for obsessive thinking but nothing I've tried is. One other problem is I can't go up in dosage from 50 mg if I'm having a rough period because it's murder on my stomach. I'm looking for an alternative but everything else seems worse.,M,51,5  years50 1X D,4/10/2012,Luvox
