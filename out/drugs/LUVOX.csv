0, 3, OCD/ Compulsive Skin Picking,Weight Gain,Gained 14 pounds in 8 weeks_ but it makes the physical tension I feel from my OCD go away so it's worth it. Missed one dose by maybe 17 hours though and I had a mental breakdown and self harmed_ very rare for me. I'm also in the process of life changes_ so it might not even be from Luvox.  Like any drug it'll work different but so far this is my 5th medication and it's actually working.,F,23,3  months200 mg,5/26/2016,Luvox

3, 4, Anxiety disorder,Drowsiness_ it's recommended to have it at night just before you go to sleep. Sometimes headaches but just mild headaches and mild dizziness.,So far_ it works on me. No terrible side effects.According to my doctor I need to take it for 6 months. I have improved a lot. I can walk in public now and I can survive in crowded places. But then again_ different people might have different reactions to this drug. If you are very sensitive to medicine_ like me_ my doctor advised me to take half of it (for my case insted of 30 mg_ I took 15 mg) then after a week or two_ you can take 30 mg.,F,24,2  months30 mg,4/11/2016Email,Luvox

Doctor thought this pill would be perfect for me but instead ruined me. I don't want to say this pill won't work for anyone because I'm sure there are success stories with it_ my body just so happens not to like it!,M,17,2  days 1X D,3/20/2016,Luvox

But I think it is not because of the medicine_ I think it is because of my condition.",Wonderfull medicine for OCD. If you are very out of your mind_ wait_ at least_ 6 months. Don't worry about the initial symptoms. Most of them are because of our conditions. If you give this medicine to someone that does not have any condition_ that person_ probably_ will not feel any colateral effect (my brother is an example of that). The best thing of it is that it affects almost nothing the libido. In my case_ it increased. Because I was with a lot of obsessions thoughts about sex in general. I was hypochondriac about being affect by some disease in a relationship.. I'm still increasing the dosage until I find the best for me. I will wait more to see if 125mg is the perfect dosage for my case.,M,28,8  months75n/50d 2X D,7/5/2015EmailHistory,Luvox
9, 5, OCD_ Generalized Anxiety,Severe anxiety and constant panic attacks initially while the drug was beginning to work_ then non really except loss of libido and occasional tiredness,"Luvox has been a godsend for me. I have tried many other antidepressants but none have compared to Luvox. Luvox has been the only drug (and trust me_ I've tried many - antidepressants_ antipsychotics_ mood stabilizers_  etc.) that I can say has really been beneficial in treating my OCD. I would often get stuck in rituals that would take up hours of time and cause a great deal of distress_ but since being on a high dose of Luvox I have been able to better manage how much time these rituals take_ how much anxiety they cause_ and the frequency. I've also found that I've had a more ""appropriate"" response to things that would normally set me off_ probably due to my lower generalized anxiety level. My OCD was severe before Luvox_ interfering with driving_ leaving the house_ typing_ and even sleeping for a reasonable amount of time. Luvox has given me more control over my OCD symptoms and I'm able to calm myself down easier. The only thing I don't like _ is that the depression seems more prominent_ even though I'm on 300mg of an SSRI. This could be because the depression is ""unmasked"" -  I've opened up so much of my time where I would normally be doing rituals and have in fact found that these rituals have prevented me from becoming active and developing friendships_ etc. Other medicines I would dread taking because of side effects_  but with Luvox its like taking a pill that only works for OCD. It's nice to have something that works_ helps_ even if it doesn't wo",M,17,2  years300MG 1X D,6/13/2015Email,Luvox
10, 5, Depression anxiety OCD,No side effects,This medicine has worked wonders for me. I feel more like myself than ever before.,M,42,3  days150,6/9/2015,Luvox
11, 1, OCD_ Anxiety,Panic attacks_ Extreme OCD_ Fixation on specific thoughts or objects_ Extreme blurry vision,"At first it worked wonders for me. Helped my OCD greatly. I was finally not afraid to shower_ I don't have a water phobia or anything but the way water felt on my skin was always gross like a creepy crawly sensation. I hated getting wet and feared my overly annoying OCD shower routine anyway. So that went away with this med and so did the need to repeat actions 3 times or have labels facing a certain way but my 100% perfect vision went to being so blurry I could not read a street sign 10 feet away from me. I felt high_ floaty_ spacey_ like I was in a daze. Then things returned to normal_ vision returned_ no more high feeling but I started getting 3-8 day long panic attacks every time I took this. I would literally sit in my bed for 3 days straight repeating a thought over and over like one line of a song would be stuck on repeat like a broken record to the point I was catatonic_ could not answer people's questions_ It would take me five minutes to say ""uh...uh...are....are.....weeeeee.....uh.......going to........walmart?"" I checked myself into the psych ward for 5 days over this crap.",F,29,3  years100mg 1X D,5/6/2015,Luvox
12, 4, Anxiety and depression,Weird smells_ nausea_ weight loss_ heavy periods_ tiredness_ anxiety in morning when waking up.,Side effects took months to disappear but then I felt so great I wanted to go off it. Bad idea. Looks like I need to stay on it a bit longer.,F,40,4  years100 mg,4/14/2015,Luvox
13, 5, Social anxiety_ OCD_ bipolar depres,As a result of taking Luvox_ I have some pretty strange dreams. I also have night sweats. The most bothersome side effect is an almost complete loss of libido. like others have said_ I can sleep for almost 20 hours straight. I don't know how much of that is medication-related or overwork-related though. I will add that the withdrawals are almost immediate if I don't take my dose within 24 hours_ and they are almost intolerable.,This drug is a lifesaver! It makes all the side effects worth it. I used to be unable to leave my house due to social anxiety_ live with chronic suicidal thoughts_ spend hours picking at my skin_ and have paranoid delusions related to bipolar disorder. I can deal with night sweats and loss of libido_ but I can't deal with the aforementioned symptoms.,F,34,9  years100mg,3/9/2015,Luvox
14, 4, OCD_ Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Apathy_ Depressed Mood_ Lost of Interest_ Fatigue (Severe at times - have to take a nap everyday around 2-3pm),"I've tried just about every SSRI_ antipsychotic (atypical and typical)_ mood stabilizer (anticonvulsants)_ SNRI and other type of drug to treat my OCD. My level of generalized anxiety is so high and I spend most days locked in compulsions. I was pessimistic about Luvox (knowing that it's an SSRI - which have never TOUCHED my anxiety even at above recommended max doses) but I must say I'm impressed. Going up on it until you get to the dose you want to get at is living hell (almost a constant panic attack around the clock_ nausea_ etc.) but once you're there your anxiety level drops like a rock. I still have a ridiculous amount of anxiety and OCD but at least I can somewhat sort-of painfully function of Luvox. The combination of this and Vyvanse is what is getting me through high school. I have noticed since taking Luvox I've been depressed_ just ""sad"" about where I am in life and my future and its kind of depressing. I cry sometimes. At least I can function. Im worried though because it being just an SSRI means it can ""poop out"" at any time. I think thats already happening - my compulsions are becoming more intense. Maybe this is just the ""new normal"".P.S. My first psychiatrist had me on Xanax 3 times a day_ just to give you an idea of how bad my anxiety was. It helped_ but come on 3 times a day and I'll buildup a tolerance in no time.",M,17,1  years125 2X D,2/20/2015Email,Luvox
15, 4, OCD,Increased sweating_ very hard to reach orgasm_ heavy period_ easily bruised_ tiredness- could sleep 13 hrs and not wake up. I am on 40mg of adderall and could still take it and fall asleep.,It does help my obsessive thoughts_Anxiety and skin picking. So far the most normal I have felt. The sexual side effects suck though,F,29,9  months150mg,1/27/2015,Luvox
16, 5, OCD (Multiple Subsets),Honestly_ none that I notice. Sexual side effects in beginning_ but they cleared within 3 weeks. Was sleepy during day so switched to night dosing and this helped greatly. I take whole dose at once.,This has been amazing in helping with the OCD symptoms. I never knew what it felt like to be 'normal' until this was introduced to me.,M,31,2  months200MG,1/12/2015Email,Luvox
17, 4, OCD,"I was put on this to deal with obsessive worrying and obsessing that was ruining my life. My niece had just started taking it and I asked for it . At first I was taking it at night and it gave me wild dreams. I switched to morning and the nightmares stopped. Started working on my obsessing within 2 weeks. It's been amazing. I'm bipolar and it didn't make me manic which is good. Only complaint is I think I'm a little ""eh"" about everything. I am not worrying all the time but I almost seem to not care about anything that much. I'm not depressed.... Just sort of ""there"".",,F,38,1  months50,12/15/2014Email,Luvox
18, 1, OCD and Depression,Frequent suicidal thoughts_ worsening of depression_ anger_ irritability_ uncontrollable fits of rage_ anxiety.  But my OCD totally went away.,This drug is dangerous.  I went from having OCD and some depression to having crippling anxiety_ uncontrollable fits of rage_ frequent (3-4 times a week) serious thoughts of suicide.  My doctor added CLONAZEPAM 0.5MG TABLETS to help control the anger and rage but it only took the edge off.  My OCD went from a 9 to a 0 on a scale of 1-10 but it wasn't worth it.  Finally_ after 9 months of being completely out of control_ my doctor suggested I have a mood disorder_ like bi-polar disorder.  Now I know that's not true so I suggested he take me off these evil pills immediately.  I have been tapering off these pills for 1 month so far and have been sick the entire time.  Moods are better_ but tapering off as my doctor instructed has led to vomiting_ nausea_ brain zaps_ dizziness_ depression_ uncontrollable crying_ fatigue_ hallucinations_ and more (but less frequent) rages.  I'm finally completely off of both prescriptions now and am back to having only slight OCD (about a 1.5 on a scale of 1-10).  My stomach is still iffy and I still cry easily.  I wish I'd never heard of this medication.  I have also lost all faith in my doctor and won't be seeing him again.  This has been the worst experience of my life and I no longer trust SSRI's.

20, 3, Depression Panic Anxiety,This is one SSRi that did upset my digestive system. Watch out for loose stools and be careful when you expel any gas. I had a bad experience at a friends house and had to clean up in the bathroom.,Seemed to be very_ very strong for serotonin. Made me feel manic at times like I just couldn't stop shopping and spending money.

But the extreme stomach problems and weight loss made me stop taking it.  It looks like she had me on too much at 300 mg per day.  I'm about ready to go crazy here and feel I need to get back on.  I think I will ask for a smaller dose than 300 mg.  Maybe my system could handle it.  Again - this stuff really knocked the OCD_ counting and depression out of me.

With having OCD_ a ""regular"" antidepressant missed the mark (I tried many...Zoloft_ Prozac_ Paxil_ Celexa).  With Luvox_ my obsessive thoughts are so much more under control.

28, 3, Pure OCD,Very tired all time (12 hours sleep not enough)_ paranoid at times_ reduced creativity (felt like my imagination was suppressed)_ Sugar craving ( I don`t know if this drug caused this but I was always wanting to eat candy_ and was never like that before taking the drug)_ I gained weight over time and used to be extremely slim which was a bit upsetting (Also_ do not know if I can blame luvox only as it was probably a combination of that_ being tried all the time and playing too much xbox). Also this drug increases aggression drastically_ and it has been proven to be associated with an 8.4 times increase in violence compared with other antidepressants (check out wikipedia).,Probably the most effective drug for OCD_ but comes with side effects. You can avoid being tired all the time by not drinking caffeine! My psychiatrist did not tell me that this medication inhibits caffeine by 5X. Check it out at wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluvoxamine So drinking one cup of coffee is like drinking atleast five. Avoid any caffeine at all costs! I have done a lot of research on this drug_ and it also acts like an antipsychotic_ by reducing dopamine in certain parts of the brain. So yeah_ it has antidepressant and anti psychotic effects which both help for OCD. It does this through being an agonist of the o1 receptor agonist. Also_ start the dose at 25mg for a week_ then 50mg for a week_ and then 100 mg. I went above 100mg and there is not any additional benefit_ so going all the way up to 300mg just seems a bit like a waste of money. Up to you though. This is strong medication but when used with care can work really well for OCD. It also has quite a lot of side effects and drug interaction which you might want to look out for. Also_ withdrawal is horrible. Makes you feel detached from reality and cannot concentrate or even think clearly. So yeah_ good luck.,M,16,7  years50mg X2 2X D,9/22/2013Email,Luvox

30, 1, OCD_ depression_ anxeity,I took Luvox Cr for a coarse of 7 months_ september 2012-april 2013. While on luvox I felt every sedated and apathetic. While I was on 100mg I would sleep most of the day .I experienced emotional blunting side effects. And stopped caring I eventually dropped out of college due to fatigue and my inability too keep up because of the mental problems with luvox .I am now weaning off luvox and I am on 25 mg and still deal with sedation and mild emotional bluntness. Before taking ssrI I believed medication. Was going to help me greatly but now I believe Erp therapy to be the way to deal with ocd (pure o) sexual obessions.

32, 2, OCD,Immediate side effect was stomach discomfort. Went away within about a week. After two weeks_ had great difficulty reaching orgasm if at all. Dropped to 12.5mg on days expected to have sex. Still could not orgasm. Extremely frustrated. I want my OCD GONE but I want my extremely gratifying intimacy with my husband back. PLEASE....can't science do any better than this??!,,F,51,3  weeks25 mg,3/26/2013,Luvox
33, 5, OCD_ Anxiety,The primary drawback I have experienced is reduced libido and difficulty with orgasm. It is definitely something to take into account if you need more than 100 - 125 mg per day. However_ maintaining a high level of physical activity (weightlifting and walking for me) seemed to offset the side effects significantly.,The side effects worsen with dosage increases. Fortunately it actually does what it says it does. For me at least_ it eliminated all anxiety issues and reduced compulsive thought patterns by at least 75%. Even under significant stress I can still get through really bad days w/o anxiety attacks and minimal compulsive thought patterns.,M,55,15  years150 mg 1X D,3/7/2013Email,Luvox
34, 4, Obsessive thinking_ GAD_ depression,Initially some nausea and headaches_ but tolerable. Went away after a week.,Where all other AD's failed_ Luvox managed to stop the obsessive thinking dead in it's tracks within a few days and lifted the depression. For anxiety it lags a bit behind and I had hoped for more_ but you can't have it all I guess... I can't tolerate a higher dose than 50mg because upping to 100 made me -still after a month- feel suicidal. Not a miracle drug but it definitely made me feel better. The good news is that it doesn't mess with sexual function at all. I tried to quit recently_ but after two weeks I felt just as bad as when I started. So now I'm back on it again for a week and I already feel the benefits.,M,58,6  months50mg 1X D,2/11/2013Email,Luvox

39, 4, Depression,Insomnia only,Took it back in 07 after other initial ssris became gradually less effective (ie zoloft_ lexapro).   It made my mood at least a 9/10  and my libido skyrocketed.   Not only no sexual side effects compared to the other ssri  (this is documented in literature)_  but actually enhanced it.  Had to go off due to getting severe insomnia on it.   I just could not get to sleep and would have to take medication each night to initiate sleep.  I rated 4 instead of 5 only due to the insomnia and apparently this is not a common effect.  Rather_ its more common to get sleepiness and hence PM dosing is suggested.  So its definitely worth a shot.,M,28,30  days150 1X D,11/20/2012Email,Luvox

I rather have low sex drive then continue feeling depressed and obsessive thoughts that i want to die.,I LOVE LUVOX! Luvox have saved my life for the past 11 years. I have been on Zoloft in the past which was good with the combination of Prozac_ but after 4-5 years the combination stop working. Once_ i got started on  Luvox 11 years ago_ my depression lifted and also the thoughts associated with OCD within 6 weeks. I had to be very patient. Thank God for a supportive family and co workers at that time.  I completed therapy also with the addition of Prozac 20 mg. to be taken with the LuVox. I have also taken Luvox CR that work well also for a short time_ but it is very expensive and i had to return to regular Luvox. I am currently taking a dosage of 150 mg of Luvox with 20 mg. of Prozac daily and continue feeling GREAT. I am careful with other drugs that may interact with Luvox_ because once certain drugs interact with Luvox_ it takes a some days (unknown amount) for the Luvox to start working again. I love Luvox and pray it never stop working. I am a person who will have to be on antidepressants for the remaining of my life_ because i of the three episodes of depression i have experienced from the age of 21 to presently.

I have taken celexa_ lithium_ seroquel_ abilify and trazodone all at wildly varying dosages. Luvox is a miracle for me.,F,27,30  days100 1X D,5/13/2012,Luvox
55, 5, OCD/Anxiety,Old luvox... Weight gain_ problems with reaching orgasm at times_ occasional heartburn_ always had to be drinking something.On old luvox for about 9 years. Stopped taking it after being on only 25 Mg a day for 2 years. Totally off for a year. Owning a business and working odd jobs to stay afloat in this economy made the OCD/Anxiety return. Started 50 Mg of CR 3 days ago. Side effects_ some muscle twitching and the wierd_ vivid dreams. Although_ these dreams seem to only happen when I'm in that half awake state in the mornings and drift back to sleep before the alarm clock goes off.For people that say it's doing nothing_ give it a month. Some people feel better from the start. Others_ it can take about 30 days. It doesn't work for everyone nor do other ssri's. That's why there are different ones. But give it a complete chance.Attitude does play a major roll. Keep it positive. I've spent many years coaching people with anxiety disorders and teaching relaxation techniques. When I was first diagnosed_ my Dr thought I'd be a semi active recluse at best. By not giving up_ learning that I could contol this brought the fighter out in me I once had. All anxiety disorders can suck the life out of you and bring on unpleasant physical problems_ also. Fight it! It gets worse before it gets better_ but fight!,,M,43,10  years50 Mg,5/7/2012Email,Luvox

58, 3, generalized anxiety disorder,sleepiness: I'm not sure how much to blame on Luvox because I take Topomax and Xanax too but I think Luvox contributes to the fact that I'm always fighting exhaustion. sexual side effects: Luvox is much better than some other SSRI's but still lowers my libido and and makes it harder to get an erection and harder to come.,The side effects are the problem. Luvox does an excellent job of managing my anxiety and depression. It's no help for obsessive thinking but nothing I've tried is. One other problem is I can't go up in dosage from 50 mg if I'm having a rough period because it's murder on my stomach.

66, 5, OCD_ Depression,Restless nights and sweating while adjusting to meds. Bouts of paranoia and anxiety while adjusting to meds.,Started at 100 mg/day and went to 300 mg/day within two to three weeks. Side effects were intense with the higher doses. I backed off the higher dose and worked my way down to the 50 mg/day and my emotions stabilized within a week or two. The obsessions had left within a couple weeks of starting the medication_ but I had to deal with the side effects. So far_ so good at 50 mg/day. If the obsessions start again_ I'll ratchet the meds up to 75 mg/day. The longest period of time dealing with the paranoia and anxiety was about 2.5 weeks. Those bouts would come and go.

I suffered badly from obsessive thoughts which caused insomnia and was very tiring and stressful. I found luvox has worked for me. I am on a higher dose-100 mg 2xper day but I really love it. I don't get social anxiety anymore or obsessive thoughts. Also_ I don't pick at my skin or clean for hours like I used to. A week ago I missed a few doses accidently and I found myself craving sugar and fatty foods like I used to when I was stressed. I know it shouldn't be used to control your diet. But Luvox has given me the ability to control my sugar cravings (probably related to my old stress habbits). Be careful as it is a strong drug but for me it has worked!

Still_ this medicine seems to work where others either worsened my symptoms or had no affect whatsoever.",Hopefully_ my trouble ejaculating will work itself out as my regimen of medication and therapy sessions progress.

Mild insomnia.,I started taking Luvox when I was 7 because I used to obsessively count my steps between stopping_ pull my hair out and I also used to brush my hair 50 strokes with one brush in the morning and 50 strokes with my comb before bed. Once I started on this_ I used to get a little aggressive with my older sister but when I reached about 9_ I started to calm down. Luvox continued to help me throughout puberty_ although we expected things  to get worse because of the hormones_ but all was well. When I was 11_ I started to come off Luvox_ gradually_ so as not to face withdrawal symptoms. There weren't any withdrawal symptoms. By the time I was 13_ I was off Luvox entirely_ but my I started to feel stressed out and became a little depressed. I also became socially awkward and spent all of my free time online_ because it felt better to be roleplaying as a mystical creature_ rather than stressed out me. I preferred my online pets to my real friends and I stopped wanting to go out. My OCD returned. I got back on Luvox and now I'm better again. :),F,15,8  years150 MG 1X D,3/14/2011,Luvox

Also was incredibly fatigued all day.,It is hard to believe one little pill could cause all these symptoms_ but sure enough when I researched side effects of Luvox all my symptoms were listed...right down to the tooth aches.

I'm just nit hungry and when I do rarely eat_ I can't finish a meal. It's great! Lol. Worst side effect is difficulty in orgasm_ which I'm used to b/c I've tried just about every SSRI.

I previously took Lamictal for about 2 years and this makes me more drowsy but has almost stopped the panic attacks altogether. I also take Trileptal which has helped with my tremors. Luvox also makes me extremely drowsy which was a severe problem_ as i am a college student who has work/ school more than 60 hours per week. My Dr put me on ADHD medicine which helped me stay focused in school and offset the drowsiness for the most part.

If my liver could tolerate it_ I would probably like Remeron better_ because it really doesn't hit the libido very much_ but Luvox is the next best thing.  I don't feel ""Medicated"" most of the time when on it_ with only a few exceptions if I eat black licorice or when I wake up in the middle of the night.  There has been some weight gain_ but the meds that seem to work good for me tend to do that (e.g. not much reduction in panic with zoloft_ so I lost weight on zoloft because I eat LESS when I have panic""Important thing to remember on Luvox: NO CAFFEINE.  You also shouldn't smoke on it.  Some of the weight gain is probably caused because I used to drink diet coke when I ate out all the time_ now it's tough to find diet caffeine free soda_ so I drink sprite_ which has a lot more calories.When my Anxiety is bad_ I have some OCD_ and this has helped that as well.

I experienced very vivid dreams/nightmares every night and was placed on Trazodone to help with the horrible insomnia it gave me. I ended up losing weight on Luvox because it decreased my appetite significantly and when I did eat it was a miniscule amount_ I felt full after a few bites of something. I also felt extremely jittery and happy manic at times but irritable as well. And of course the sexual side effects of many ssri's...It decreased my libido and made it harder to reach an orgasm_ and at times I couldn't reach one at all.,This drug helped mostly with my social anxiety and obsessive compulsive behaviors/mentality. It truly is a great choice if you experience any kind of ocd. As far as it helping with my depression it was hard to tell because overall I felt in a better mood (hyper)most of the time but I also experience manic depressive episodes so this drug wasn't fully beneficial for me. I would not recommend this to anyone who could potentially be Bipolar.,F,22,1  years150mg 2X D,9/8/2010,Luvox

Sleeps throughout the night (first time ever)and has 'lovely dreams'. Definitely less anxious and less obsessive. Stopped pulling out her hair. Generally getting on better with everyone at home. BUT she has become quite destructive. Started doing things like cutting up my bed linen and her clothes_ drawing on furniture with kokhis. This is not normal behaviour for an 8 year old.

But_ it made such a more relaxed person and my OCD thoughts went away.  I was even a better parents_ calmer with my kids.  It elevated my mood.  I hated to stop it but the nausea and headaches are something I cannot deal with.  I think I want to try it agian_ but only if I do not go any higher than 150mg_ which I see people do.

Other than that_ it has cut back on the severity of my mood swings_ but not really by much. I recently experienced thoughts of suicide_ which I believe is not due to the drug but to some marital problems and the underlying depression. My psychiatrist had me double my dose from 100mg to 200mg until he could see me (about a week)_ and during that time I was always tired_ even if I slept 13 hours. However_ my husband said that my moods seemed level during that time_ but I think was just due to effort on my part to avoid further alienating him.

This one wanted to wean me down on the Effexor and start me on Luvox to see if I could get better results.  I got down to 75mg Effexor and tried the Luvox twice; 2 weeks the first time and 1 week the second.  I had high hopes and I probably wasn't on it long enough.  But my head hurt so bad it was difficult to not call in sick and I couldn't do that.  Constant nausea too.  I could take phenergan and sleep through it on the weekend but couldn't do it during the week.  Went back to the Effexor.  I never had a problem with side effects from it like I hear most people do.

Now trying to slowly_ very slowly reduce dosage so I can maybe get off someday all together.  reduced doseage now down to 50 mg a day. will do that for several weeks and then try to stop.

176, 3, anxiety_ depresion,dry mouth_ excessive weight gain_ ADDICTION!!!,I slowly began to taper off of luvox as I felt like I really didn't need it anymore.  I was at 200 MG a day for a few years.  Really added weight (I normally weigh 175-185.  I was at 210 when i decided to quit).  I dropped from 200 to 100 with no problem_ but once I tried to dip down to below 50 MG a day_ I experienced extreme withdrawal symptoms.   Just search for fluvoxamine withdrawal online.  They say it's worse than coming off serious drugs (heroin_ coke_ meth_ etc).  Once I stopped taking it for good_ the withdrawal symptoms were still there for a few weeks.  I feel great now.  Back down to my normal weight and have had very minor anxiety problems.   To anyone who is thinking about taking luvox_ be weary of addiction.  Come of the drug EXTREMELY carefully.  If you are willing to put up with a bit of excess weight and dry mouth_ it's a great drug.,M,22,2  years,11/24/2008,Luvox

180, 3, OCD/BiPolar/GAD,I take 100mg at night.  I am a complete zombie the next day_ especially in the morning.  Seems to clear up a little by afternoon.  In the morning_ I am virtually unable to function.  I cannot stay awake at work_ can't remember anything_ and have lost my sense of awareness and time.  I'll do something in the morning and that night I'll think about it and it feels like it happened last week.  The heavy sedation and loss of awareness persists even though I've been on it for about a month now.  My boss had to send me home several times to take a nap because I couldn't stay awake. My psychiatrist prescribed Provigil (which is used to treat narcolepsy) to combat the sedating effects.  The Provigil helps_ but by the time I get home from work_ I'm completely exhausted.,While the obsessive thoughts have greatly diminished_ I'm not sure it's worth the side effects to take this medication.,F,36,1  months,10/1/2008,Luvox

Sex drive is still there_ although I can lose an erection just as quick as I get one.  But it's nothing that's a show stopper.  I do notice that I sweat more and also that it does not take well to caffeine or alcohol.  Two beers is 100% intoxicated.  A cup of coffee will trigger a mild anxiety attack.,While on this med (6 months so far)_ I've become more aware of things going around me.  It's allowed me to focus more on bettering myself as a person and really look at what I want out of life.  Something I've been looking for awhile now.  While it's got its negatives_ I think the positives slightly outweigh the negatives.  I would_ however_ strongly suggest it as a last alternative.,M,28,6  months,8/23/2008,Luvox
184, 3, OCD_ depression,Sedation_ slight initial nausea_ mild apathy_ prone to erotic fantasizing (have it with any SSRI).,At first_ I wasn't very enthusiastic about fluvoxamine (Luvox) - it was antidepressant but not anti-obsessive/anxiolytic. Now_ on a higher dose (200mg instead of 150) I feel that fluvoxamine is a worthwhile antidepressant_ even when it doesn't beat obsessions for me. It isn't one of the activating SSRI's_ but rather has a somewhat calming/stabilizing effect for me. In comparison to Paxil (paroxetine)_ which I have used before_ I prefer fluvoxamine - the side-effects are milder; on Paxil I used to have horrible dreams_ while on fluvoxamine my dreams are more often pleasant. Also_ Paxil made my sweat smell like hell - this doesn't happen on fluvoxamine. The weight gain is still mild as well. Sexual side-effects are practically none - just takes a little longer to achieve orgasm_ which I consider a pro. I think about upping the dose some more to see if the drug might help with my obsessions after all.,M,32,7  months,8/16/2008Email,Luvox

Honestly_ I have never taken LCD_ but it seemed to be like dropping acid.  I had a bad trip.  I am hoping these side effects will deminish.  All of these drugs for deppression/ocd should be approached with caution.  These drugs really have the capability to mess with your mind.  I am not trying to scare anyone.

When I arrived at 125_ the anti-depressive effect kicked in. I now take 75mg 9AM and 9PM. I feel chemically well_ but I'm not happy. Fluvoxamine doesn't seem to be very activating.

Furthermore_ bizarre and violent thoughts and dreams worried me a great deal.,Horrendous side effects greatly outweighed any benefits gained from Luvox_ a drug which had the least side-effects for me after trying several others.

It took  a bit for it to help numb and make things roll of my back at first. After a while_ it did a great job in helping me cope without the strong reactions of anxiety or depression. Counselling also helps with depression. In the last 4-5 years_ it enabled more to roll off my back so I don't get as upset with frustrations_ or the oc side of me get so anxious and nervous over things. I've tried to get off the medication 3 times but found after about 3 weeks that the anxiety starts to come back and this year_ felt overwhelmed with some things without it. So I'm glad to have a medication that takes the edge off_ so that I can lead a much more positive_ enthusiastic_ happier life.,F,51,7  years,1/6/2008,Luvox

Also_ dihorrea all day every day. Very hungover feeling in the morning and the only hours I start to feel ""normal"" (ie the fog lifts) are the two hours directly before i take my next dose.

265, 4, Severe OCD,Loss of energy_ loss of appetite_ drowsiness_ diminished libido_ trouble ejaculating.,Combined with cognitive therapy_ this drug was very helpful_ but it was not an end-all solution by any means. I still needed to undergo draining_ intense mental exercises and therapy to help keep my OCD at bay_ but I am sure that this medication made it far more manageable than it would have been otherwise. The only real complaint are the side effects I've experienced_ as they have severely inhibited my sex life and my ability to stay focused and awake. But_ all in all_ I'd have to say these sacrifices were worth regaining control of my life.,M,22,8  years,12/6/2005Email,Luvox

267, 5, OCD,Initially_ dry mouth_ delayed orgasm.  Disappeared after a few weeks.  Weight gain was a long term side effect_ but I've controlled it well with strict exercise.  Sense of time_ word retrievel_ crispness of memory_ have suffered somewhat_ but it is very much worth the benefits.,This stuff has worked beautifully for my OCD. It actually got me giddy in the first couple of years. I'd be driving_ and especially if it was sunny outside_ I'd just start laughing for no reason. It was like bliss.  I've been on it for 8 years. The initial side effects of delayed orgasm and dry mouth went away within weeks.  The side effect of weight gain which don't disappear within weeks_ I've been able to control with strict exercise.  Sense of time_ word retrievel_ crispness of memory_ have suffered somewhat_ but it is very much worth the benefits.  Be very aware of the addictiveness of this and other SSRIs.  I arrogantly went off this med a few months ago_ cold turkey_ and suffered the most severe anxiety/fear of my life.  I actually was checked into the physch ward because I was suicidal.  I tried to switch to a different SSRI_ Zoloft to regain that blissful feeling of the initial year or so of Luvox.  But that made the anxiety worse.  So after 6 weeks of the Zoloft_ I've returne,M,30,8  years,11/2/2005,Luvox

272, 5, depression from chronic pain,diminished libido,This drug has been miraculous for me_ as I have a great life now.Because things are going so well_ I've thought about stopping Luvox. On the other hand_ I am afraid to for fear of a major relapse.  Before this drug_ I was taking Amitriptyline and had gained much weight.  I've lost all that and do not eat compulsively like before.  My attitude is mostly positive and I don't let pain dictate my life. Hopeless thinking went from pervasive to almost non-existent.

278, 5, OCD,Lowered sex drive_ weight gain.,I tried several different antidepressants and none helped at all_ if anything made my ocd worse. Luvox gave me my life back! My ocd is highly obsessional thinking with some rituals. It started helping me the first day I took it_ they say that is takes time to work but not for me.

It was extremely helpful for depression and boy did it cure my insomnia.  But I gained 70lb_ and ultimately became hopelessly apathetic about everything.

Occasional headaches too_ but paracetamol is effective enough.,Have been very happy with it.  7 months later I have fully recovered from Panic Disorder_ and am doing well with regards to anxiety and depression and obsessional thought.This is a good drug for anxious depression_ and especially those on the obsessive side or with insomnia.

290, 1, depression,My 16 year old son was actually the one taking this medication for depression.  After he'd been on it for one month_ he attempted suicide by taking the entire bottle of luvox_ a gallon of rum_ and a pain medication he had for a previous injury.  He was in intensive care for a week_ another week on a pediatric floor_ and another 3 weeks in a psych hospital.  While in the psych hospital he was put on Zoloft_ 100mg_ and it's working wonderfully!  If you're taking an antidepressant and don't feel it's working_ TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR_ antidepressants work differently for different people.  I'm a registered nurse_ and though I have knowledge of different medications_ I just kept thinking the Luvox would start working soon.
