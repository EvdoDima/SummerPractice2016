0, 5, Lifelong atypical depression,Agitation_ grinding teeth at night_ difficulty having orgasm.,"Prozac is my miracle drug. Started in 1990 @ 40 mg - lifted my lifelong depression & changed my life. I no longer felt like I was dragging myself thru each day. Tried switching to other antidepressants due to side effects but nothing else works for me like Prozac so I decided it was a small price to pay. Buspar helps counteract the agitation/anxiety & is not habit-forming. Now in perimenopause and hormones are affecting my mood - upped Prozac to 60 mg - I know it's still working because I feel good on my rare days when hormones are ""good."" Pre-Prozac (1st 22 yrs of my life) I never had a good day. Am starting hormone therapy but that's another story ...",F,48,10  years60,7/24/2016Email,Prozac
1, 4, Nervous breakdown/anxiety,Initial weight loss_ upset stomachs_ migraines_ after 5 months of using drug massive weight gain of 30lbs in 6 months_ yawning all the time.,This drug did help me. My anxiety was very bad_ could not leave the house and felt on edge all the time. Had no life and pretty much did not want to be on the planet any more. However after 2 months of taking the Prozac I started to feel better. I've been taking it 16 months now and am fully recovered.  I have gained a lot of weight_ this weight gain only started with the use of Prozac. Long term use of this drug you will gain weight.  I've reduced my MG to 20 now. In 2 weeks time I will start to come off Prozac_ however I will be doing this slowly as withdrawal can be pretty bad.  Great for helping recovery but in my experience does cause significant weight gain.,F,35,1  years40Mg,7/13/2016Email,Prozac

3, 3, Aniexty,At first_ restlessness_ agitated_ cold sweats in the night_ sometimes extremely painful acid reflux after taking (I used to take mine in the morning) Definatley helped a bit. Felt extremely happy a lot of the time and comfortable but after a year of taking it decided to stop taking it just because I thought I couple cope without it. I'm fine now but Have gained weight and I blame it on Prozac because I've always had a fast metabolism and seems like no matter what I eat or what I do I'm stuck this way,,F,25,1  years20mg,6/28/2016Email,Prozac
4, 4, Severe Anxiety,Weight gain ( 20 pounds in a year and I exercise and watch my diet). Not as interested in sex.,This medicine gave me my life back in the sense that I had debilitating anxiety and could barely leave my house_ except to go to work. I was extremely anxious and paranoid. The medicine definitely helped me with those aspects_ but the weight gain is causing depression now.,F,31,1  years10 MG,6/21/2016,Prozac
5, 4, Depression_ anxiety_ worrying,Makes my hands shake.,I believe I am already feeling better.  A little more energy and I am not worrying about everything.  Have not had any suicidal thoughts since starting it.  Feel like this might be the one that helps.,F,49,9  days20 MG,6/8/2016,Prozac

7, 1, Anxiety,Side effects started right away in the first week. I had a sense of numbness and lack of feeling. Then stomach and gas issues. My panic attacks were worse and muscle tensions really bothered me.,This drug is strong. Dont let someone tell you this a mild antidepressive. Although it takes time to work_ the side effects can be worse then before taking the drug. I worked with a therapist to work through it_ but I only had maybe 3 really good days in 4 weeks. I decided on the 30th day (after bad heartburn and uneasiness) to just stop. I am going back to just taking xanax as needed.,M,45,30  days20 mg 1X D,6/2/2016Email,Prozac
8, 5, ,First week no sleep restless legs _very real dreams.the restless legs is ok some nights I still get the tremers .,Any side effects from this drug are totally worth it. I too though it wasn't working and I felt more depressed then I felt great I thought is this what it's like to be normal.for me it is working great and any side effects are nothing compared to the 20years of anxiety and hell i have been suffering .it works for me im not paranoid im not argumentative and im so chilled out these daysðŸ˜Š,F,42,7  weeks20mg,5/29/2016,Prozac
9, 5, Depression_  Anxiety,Gave me weird dreams at first but that went away once my body was adjusted to the medicine.,Prozac has saved my life! Before Prozac I didn't know what it felt like to live without debilitating depression and constant suicidality. Thanks to this medicine I am able to go to work_ be an involved parent_ and do many other things that I enjoy. I no longer lay in bed all day wishing to die. I know now what it feels like to be okay!,F,22,5  years80 mg,5/17/2016,Prozac
10, 2, Moderate depression and social anxi,Nausea and acid reflux on the first few days_ then just headaches and feeling even more numb and disconnected from the world. Not too bad.,Did not work for me personally so I changed to a different SSRI (zoloft which worked great) however not all medication works for everyone and if your medication doesnt work after a month then try switch to something else.,F,17,1  months20 1X D,5/13/2016,Prozac
11, 2, Mild depression,,"My mom took me to the doctor_ thinking that I was depressed. The doctor prescribed Prozac for me. The next morning I took my first dose. Within about an hour I experienced intense paranoia. I literally believed that ""someone"" was waiting outside of the school to come and get me! It was a horrible experience. Luckily_ the fear and paranoid thoughts left that evening. I would never take that medicine again!",F,14,1  days,5/8/2016,Prozac
12, 2, depression_ possible adhd,Headache_ nausea_ extreme fatigue,I was taking lexapro and what a difference. This drug_ after 3 days_  made me feel suicidal and irritated. Now it's been about two weeks and again I'm feeling suicidal and irritated. It's definitely the Prozac. Not taking again.,F,21,3  weeks20,4/26/2016,Prozac

14, 1, Anxiety/Depression,For the first few days I didn't have any side effects and I was super pleased with it. But on the 4th night_ I was woken out of my sleep with a terrible burning in my stomach_ extreme_ dizziness_ vomiting_ and shaking uncontrollably. I was vomiting all night. This was last night. I still have a burning in my stomach the following day. My Doctor just proscribed me Wellbutrin so hopefully I don't have the same problem...,,F,21,4  days20 MG,3/8/2016,Prozac
15, 1, Depression,Extreme weight gain_ headaches,This is definitely not something I would recommend_ especially if you're someone who has weight problems. I was on it for two years and it didn't help.  I gained over 100 pounds while on it even with dieting. Since getting off of it dropping the weight I gained while on it has gotten so much easier.,F,19,2  years,3/7/2016,Prozac

20, 1, depression/anxiety,It modified my behavior_ more confident_ but also I didn't feel much_ It's like I was numbed to my emotions. I was also overly activated/wired.,I don't recommend it_ try therapy and life style changes instead. Also time heals a lot of wounds.,F,18,9  months20 mg 1X D,1/12/2016,Prozac
21, 1, Depression/Anxiety,(I'm currently still on it.) Worsened both of the previous mental disorders and my suicidal tendencies_ while giving me more mental illnesses. I'm almost completely sure I have Schizophrenia_ as I feel like someones always watching me_ and Bipolar II_ as a friend with the disorder said I had a lot of the traits of which she had. Not as many physical side effects as mental_ but in worsening my anxiety it did make me start to develop tremors.,I was actually told that I either needed to go onto Prozac early this summer(2015) or go to a mental hospital. I'm a 14 year old_ 5'3'' girl_ so I wanted to get out of the mental hospital thing as fast as I could.(Before someone comments on my age_ this is a better description of what could happen to other minors on Prozac. I simply want no one to have to go through what I did.) I decided to take Prozac_ a relatively small dosage. I was on Zoloft about 4 months before that_ for 8 months_ which had made me either develop anxiety or had worsened pre-existing anxiety to the point it was noticeable. I had almost every single symptom of anxiety_ and they've only gotten worse on this drug. I want to kill myself extremely badly_ I have about 30-40 plans too. I have much less emotion or apathy. I get scared when someone gives me a present because I won't seem happy enough_ when pets die I don't care or seem sad_ etc. I can't think_ my grades dropped_ I can sleep for entire days if given the chance_ and I cannot sympathize with people. I can only hate_ but hate some things less than others_ as I am completely void of love and cannot even tolerate most things or people. I have no hope and my only aspiration in life is death. Instead of taking away depression this seems to have wiped away the remaining traces of happiness_ while giving me multiple mental disorders. Never take this. Please.,F,14,6  months10mg 1X D,1/3/2016,Prozac
22, 2, Stress and anxiety,Really tough 1st 6 months - sweating_ nausea_ vomiting_ insomnia. Those side effects eased but numbness_ headaches_ loss of libido_ and some dizziness remain,,M,49,2  years20 mg 1xd,12/30/2015,Prozac
23, 3, Depression_ Anxiety_ Mood Disorder,Irritability,I took this when I was recovering from Anorexia_ started in 8th grade continued til the beginning of 12th. The first week taking prozac I felt amazing_ but like most SSRIs I took this feeling quickly wore off. It stabilized me for a while then just wasn't effective. I've heard many success stories about Prozac but I'm not one of them. I think this medication is good for people with short term depressive episodes_ but not for people like me who struggle with long term depression and mood problems. My highest regular dose was 40mg my lowest was 20mg. I noticed on the higher doses I was more irritable_ another pattern typical of me with SSRIs. It took the edge off_ but really didn't do much in the long run. I've been off it for a long time now.,F,20,4  years20-40mg 1X D,12/29/2015,Prozac
24, 2, depression and anxiety,stomach aches_ loss of appetite_ emotionless_ dazed_ scared_ not fully there,I've been taking it for a short while and I'm not sure if it will help me. I'd rather have emotions and be myself again than be an emotionless robot.,F,13,3  days10,12/26/2015,Prozac
25, 1, Depression_ Anxiety_ Fatigue,Libido loss_ loss of emotions/thoughts_ horrible withdrawal symptoms (for the love of god taper off of this poison as slow as you can_ hell-like experience),Avoid this poison proven less effective than placebos!! Also it was never approved for long term usage or for children!! Ruined my teenage years and I am still recovering 1 year later!,M,17,300  days60 MG 1X D,12/5/2015,Prozac
26, 5, Depression and anxiety,Loss of appetite (which is not a bad thing) lol,I was constantly having depressing thoughts about death and just worrying myself silly but then when I started the Prozac after a few weeks I never have any thoughts like that. It really has changed my life! I am more affectionate towards my husband and I am more positive and happy!!,F,36,10  weeks40 mg,11/17/2015,Prozac
27, 5, anxiety and panic attacks,I no longer had panic attacks.  My chronic anxiety became a thing of the past.,There is a warning about prozac that it causes teenagers to kill themselves.  I believe that these things happened because they did not take it long enough to receive any benefits from it.,F,58,2  days20 1X D,11/13/2015,Prozac
28, 1, Depression and anxiety,I was on lorien which is one of the generics i think.Took one a day_ eventually started to work_ but then found it started making me more depressed_ then went up to 2 a day_ same thing started to work then took a dive_ Took me to dark places i will not voice out loud_and almost like i just didn't care any more_ not that i wasn't anxious_ i just didn't care or have the energy to care_ also wanted to eat_ put on over 2 kg in just over a month.I've stopped taking them before things could get worse...,,F,43,2  months,11/1/2015,Prozac
29, 2, Panic attacks_ anxiety,Irritable_ more anxious_ restless_ no sexual desire_ craving for sweets_ junk food.,This was prescribed to cure my panic attacks_ I find this strange as my anxiety got a lot worse! Yes_ the frequency has decreased but I also take xanax 1 mg and 0.25 mg klonopin/day. I did not experience any mood improvement except I now find pleasure in eating sweets and drinking mochas.,F,39,2  months10 mg 1X D,10/27/2015,Prozac

31, 1, Bipolar 1,The first week I was very sick to my stomach_ and had the runs. I had plenty of energy though and set about my tasks proficiently. The second week my symptoms got a bit better_ still nauseous. The third week has been hell. I'm not me_ but I am_ I'm trapped in my head. The rest of my  body doesn't feel connected to my head. I'm lucky if I even remember to eat once a day_ I've become lazier_ my body and emotions feel sort of numb_ like I'm just here but I'm not really. I space out frequently_ I'm losing my depth perception (bumping into things a lot and accidentally banging my head on things from misjudging distance)_ I feel weak_ a pitcher of tea feels heavy_ my legs..... Whenever I try to walk my steps are very shaky_ and I've started breaking out in rashes that come and go. My menstrual pain which was always a nightmare due to a tilted uterus and a couple ovarian cysts got even worse. I would feel ok at the beginning of the day_ by mid day I felt high as a kite_ by night time I am fee,"Don't be an idiot like me and self medicate_ this drug was not prescribed to me_ I was essentially taking it as something to hold me over til I got my own meds_ it was a huge mistake. Bipolar 1 and Depression are not the same by any means as far as treatment goes_ I also have PTSD not sure if that makes a difference. My body has become so numb I can't even feel it when I cut myself_ shadows move_ I find myself wanting to get drunk or high now_ I feel like I want to elevate the feeling but it's not even that great_ and I keep taking even though I know it's making me sick. No more. Please do your research before you start taking this_ and if for one second you think that self medicating is a good idea and don't think there's harm in it_ think again. This is my mistake for taking something not prescribed to me. I have seen countless stories now of how it's helped some while not others. If you are taking this and notice anything resembling any of these symptoms you need to tell your doctor ASAP. They usually wean you off so I hear_ there's apparently withdrawal symptoms in some cases. The important thing is_ if you feel like this drug isn't helping you and that it's making you worse_ tell your doctor right away_ write down any differences in mood or behavior_ they can't help you otherwise. Good luck to you all in your endeavors to feel whole and happy_ feeling like a ""normal"" person. I hope you guys find whatever it is that works for you and helps you achieve your emotional",F,27,29  days40 1X D,9/28/2015Email,Prozac

33, 1, Anxiety/Depression,Before starting Prozac_ I had been vomiting (apperantly due to anxiety) without reason for several months. I missed several weeks of school_ and was severly depressed because of it. In my few years of using Prozac I threw up maybe four times. Life was good... Except my grades were plummeting_ everyone thought I was an idiot_ and I found myself unable to think clearly. I looked online_ and found many people had the same issue. Eventually I switched to Zoloft_ and found that for the first time in years I could think clearly_ and I still wasn't vomiting. Prozac may do as advertised_ but for me and many others_ it traded a horrible problem for a bad problem.,Do NOT use!,M,17,2  years100MG,8/21/2015,Prozac

It is not.I will not step in the room of another psychiatrist again in my life unless someone is aiming me with a gun.,M,19,6  months20 mg 1X D,8/16/2015,Prozac
36, 5, Depression_ BDD_ Binge Eating,Vivid dreams_ teeth clenching_ loss of appetite(a welcomed side effect),Prozac has helped me more with my binge eating than my depression.

52, 1, Anxiety,In just 4 months I completely lost myself. I went from a fearful_ worried guy_ to an agressive_ irritable one. THIS DRUG CHANGES YOUR PERSONALITY COMPLETELY. I feel betrayed by my doctor who told me it was completely safe and with no serious side effects. The people that promote this drug have a special place in hell for them.,It sucks to be so irritable that you sometimes don't stand being around people. I was not like this before taking this shit.,M,19,4  months20 mg 1X D,6/29/2015,Prozac
53, 2, Anxiety/hypochondria/mild depressio,This drug numed my emotions a lot_ the good ones and the bad ones_ it also decreased my libido. The side effects were not worth it. My recommendation is to not take this drug unless desperate. Fluoxetine is a powerful drug VERY overprescribed and in most cases therapy should be the answer instead of fluoxetine. In my case I feel that I should have accepted my anxiety as a part of myself_ istead of thinking there was something wrong with me and that I needed to be medicated.I am currently stopping it and hoping my emotions to come back.,It numbed all emotions_ also the anxious ones_ that's how it works.,M,21,7  months20 mg 1X D,6/20/2015,Prozac

Over the course of the year I have gained 30-40 lbs going from 190 to 230 despite being even more active than I was prior to taking the medication. I am 6ft tall by the way. My libido also dropped to nonexistence.,,M,21,1  years10 mg,6/15/2015,Prozac

58, 1, Depression/Anxiety,Extreme restlessness and agitationInsomnia,Had been on Prozac previously and well tolerated_ decided to come off so that I could grieve properly for my mother. During the course of a year of being med free_ steady spiral back down to severe depression_ anxiety and obsessive thinking. Restarted Prozac at 20 MG. Bad idea. I have never experienced that level of restlessness and agitation in my life. Could not sit or lie in one place for more than five minutes_ Felt like I was constantly under threat  Could not sleep for days and days or find any mental peace whatsoever. I know all about initial side effects_ but this was a totally different level. Began to feel suicidal after about two weeks. Doctor told me to go to ER for Psych evaluation. Things have never gotten that bad before. Psych doctor switched me to Effexor XR. After a few days began to feel better than I can ever remember feeling since about the age of 13.

I still cry during sad movies and funerals_ I still get upset over a dirty house_ I still get anxiety (as always)....and I still laugh..I no longer feel that the world will end over a bad comment I made or worry about offending someone.

I don't think my anxiety is that severe compared to other people (I've only had 3 episodes of panic attacks) think I can just do yoga and mediation and take things slow.

65, 4, Anxiety,After having a positive experience  with prozac yrs ago I'd thought I'd give it another shot. Works great for my panic attacks. This isn't a fast acting  drug_ you have to give it time. 4 to 6 weeks to be fully active. So if your looking for a quick fix this isn't it. Be patient. Only side effect I've experienced was impotence  which sucks but only occured on occasion. Most of the time was able to engage in sexual activities  for hrs which isnt a bad thing.,,M,29,1  months10mg,3/21/2015,Prozac

68, 3, depression,The first three weeks it didn't really woek on me_ but rather made me feel more suicidal and depressed. After that I was upped to 40MG and that was too much. I had insomnia_ unreasonably much energy and I always felt tired at the same time. I couldn't sit still and took up running_ my hands and legs started trembling if I sat still for like 5 mins and I couldn't concentrate at all. So it was down to 20MG again. After some months_ it was going fine until my insomnia upped and I started seeing vivid and horrible nightmares and just falling asleep everywhere. I became even more depressed and unmoralized than before and started thinking about suicide again_ then I completely stopped taking it_ still exeperiencing the side effects.,It really works if you're in DEEP depression and need some forced push to actually get you to continue your life. It ddoesn't go well woth school/work though. I experienced almost all of the side effects but even though that_ I am somewhat better than the times when I started taking it. I staryed crying less and such (though be warned if you're anxious like me because it makes you feel CRAZY anxious). So I guess it's worth taking for a few months_ but not any more for me.,F,17,3  months20MG,3/13/2015,Prozac

76, 1, Fibromyalgia,Intensifies the pain from fibromyalgia rather than aiding relief. Had panic attacks for the first time in my life in Prozac. Severe depression caused solely by this drug (ironically). Anxiety and nausea were constant. (Completely) lost the ability to orgasm within two weeks of taking this - (went numb down there). Dreams of blood and gore which were extremely vivid. (I am not a veteran and I have never experienced this before - so it was quite terrifying.),Please be careful what you put into your body.

So I went on 20mg again. Worked for 6 months and depression got even worse so I was upped to 40mg. It's been 3 months and I feel a ton better.

82, 3, Depression,Initially I had a lot of nausea_ really strange sensations in my head. Pains in my chest. Hypo-manic_ and super sleepy a few times a day especially after eating. Anxiety.,I abused substances for the greater part of a year totally exhausting my seratonin supplies and damaging my neuron transmitters. After realizing recreational drugs no longer had the same effect on me_ and figuring out how much damage was done memory wise I quit using and drinking_ only to find an extreme dose of depression. I cried randomly all the time over nothing. Any bit of emotion whether happy or sad made me teary. I started to binge eat all the time which led to great weight gain. Then I decided to try my first anti-depressant. Prozac. It was kind of a crazy ride to begin with. I'm pretty sure I was Hypo-manic_ because I started feeling extreme emotion. Either getting extremely excited or upset. More happy than upset. My brain was running miles_ but I had trouble thinking straight. I'd forget what I was even saying as I was saying it. I just got lost in thought. I felt like an idiot. I experienced higher brain activity for sure_ I just wanted to talk! it sucked though because my mind was in such a jumble so words didn't come out right. My brain was a mess. I didn't know if I should blame prozac or brain damage. But the high that I had on prozac was amazing_ I was just bursting with energy and laughs. Actually felt happy. Loved talking to people when normally I'm reserved. But not on a high dose of prozac (similar to recreational drugs) Had crazy amounts of energy throughout the day_ had shaking leg syndrome_ hands shaked like crazy at first_ would get super tired rando,F,25,2  years15-60mg 1X D,10/25/2014Email,Prozac
83, 3, panic depression anxiety phobia,This drug only works for me when I combine it with 25 mg of doxepin_ another antidepressant. That helps block the side effects of too much anxiety from the Prozac. Doxepin blocks the 5ht2a receptor which Prozac stimulates and this will let you sleep better if it gives you insomnia and or anxiety. If I take too much Prozac it will make me irritated and cranky.,Works ok for me mild depression and anxiety but still have panic at times.

Then_ appetite reduction_ slight weight loss_ hard to sleep at first_ vivid dreams_ renewed desire to be involved_ lethargy.,The first few weeks there was no effect_ so we doubled the dose.  It worked pretty well_ at least at first.  Over a year into it now_ I am not so sure.  I had noticed that I have had some pretty vivid dreams_ but I did not associate those with prozac until I read that could be one of the side effects.  It is definitely not a cure.  I used to never be a crier_ but right before I started taking this it's like a switch flipped.  Now everything makes me cry_ and Prozac has not changed this.  It did help with the destructive thoughts so that I could actually interact with society.  I think I still have that effect_ but the initial other benefits have worn off.  I don't have reduced appetite anymore.  It's actually increased.  I did experience some weight loss at first_ but obviously that all came back.  I am not sure that this medicine works for me anymore.  I am not in the black pit that I was before_ and I am grateful for that_ but as far as is this a miracle drug?

Tapering off and getting through withdrawal takes patience-this process can be very frustrating if you have to resume a previous dose longer to avoid withdrawal. Also_ very difficult to get through school or work day when going through withdrawal.,I took Prozac from age 16-27. Pros: Gets rid of depression_ anxiety_ and stress. Also helps with headache prevention_ PMS_ IBS_ SAD_ fibromyalgia_ low immunity_ chronic pain reduction. Only take this med if severe depression_ anxiety_ or stress interferes with your daily functioning-otherwise the side effects arenÂ’t worth it. Must weigh benefits of meds vs. side effects. Lower dosage can be just as effective as higher dosage. 5-10 mg works just as good as the 20 mg with less side effects. Some people even get benefits with a dose as low as 2 mg.

The reason why the psychiatrist prescribed me prozac was because he believed I was suffering from Bipolar Disorder (which I never was!). The reason why I was taken off prozac immediately was because of the severity of the following symptoms:Â• Visual and Audio Hallucinations;Â• Psychosis;Â• Gross Weight Gain/Morbid Obesity;Â• Mood/Personality Dysfunction; Â• Increased Appetite/Not Feeling ""full"". Being on this was utter torture and I DO NOT recommend it!",,F,23,5  yearsmin to max,9/22/2013,Prozac

136, 4, major depression & anxiety,Weight gain due to blood sugar changes that doctors do not cop to.  Insomnia_ water retention_ and a bit of joint-swelling.,This drug does not need to be prescribed at high doses.  I do great with just 5 mgs_ and did ok w/10 except for the side effects were a bit worse.  One can minimize the side effects of the weight gain simply by sticking with a low dose and being on a low-carb high-protein diet.  I highly recommend this drug at a low dose for those with depression.  Very effective_ safe_ and reliable.  Also_ if ya skip a dose_ there are minimal withdrawal symptoms_ but particularly at the low dose of either 5 or 10 mgs.  This medication has been the best and I have tried a lot over the course of 10 years.  I keep going back to Prozac for a reason.  Also_ it has not messed up my sleep as badly as a higher dose does_ and I can concentrate very well on it.  My brain works better_ I think clearer_ and am in better control of my emotions on it.  I also have had no problem with any sexual issues on this drug.  All is well as far as that goes...at least for me.   Btw_ taking fish oil_ probiotics_ and digestive enzymes are very helpful while on this drug as far as weight.  Taking them helps keep weight issues to a minimum.  I have had a weight gain of only 15 lbs on this in the past 10 years_ and I'm 44.  Not too bad.  I DO work out and watch my diet though.  That is truly crucial.Please be advised that this medication can heighten the happy feelings of alcohol_ and can cause cravings for alcohol with minimal hangovers.  Very dangerous that way to the liver and to one's health.  If ya like alcohol,F,44,1  years5 1X D,6/25/2013Email,Prozac
137, 4, Anxiety Panic and Mild Depression,Nausea.. Mild.. Headache.. Some Constipation.. Total loss of appetite..,I have been on Lexapro for nearly 2 years and it did help but I was always exhausted feeling about mid afternoon.  Although it helped with my anxiety issues_ it never really helped much with panic so I asked to switch and my pdoc and I agreed on Prozac.I slowly went off the Lexapro and started adding 2.5MG of Prozac for every 2.5MG of Lexapro I would lessen.  The Prozac seems to be less sedating so far but I think there's some residual Lexapro still in my system at this point so we'll see in a week or two.The cool awesome thing is my ability to orgasm easily came back_ and it came back STRONG and POWERFUL.  I still have delayed orgasms but when I finally ejaculate it's extremely intense.  I also have ZERO appetite which is fine for now because I could stand to lose about 15 pounds_ so most of my food is forced down.  And I'm back to sleeping for 6 or 7 hours a night instead of 8 or 9 like I was on Lexapro...  Hopefully it will hit the Panic attacks better than the Lexapro did - but so far - I'm happy with the switch...,M,43,6  weeks10 MG 1X D,5/29/2013Email,Prozac

I took the 5th dose and within hours I had a splitting headache.  The problem there is that you are not supposed to take NSAIDS (Ibuprofen) or Aspirin when you are on prozac because of an increased risk of internal bleeding.  I had hoped there would be no side effects to this drug_ but no luck.  I'm going to stop.  I can deal with bad periods much better than nausea and immobilizing headaches that I can't take Ibuprofen for.,I was on the generic version for PMS.

I used to take 80 for OCD dose.  It worked.  When I go down I get obsessed about guys who didn't want me and couldn't let go_ was cluttering_ shop on web all night.  I went down to 40 and felt depressed again and bad obsession.  Finally got off and went on Lexapro_ felt way better_ but then gained 7 lbs in a month.

179, 5, Severe Depression,Lessened appetite_ weight loss,this drug has changed my life around.  People say it doesn't work but it has been amazing for me.  I had tried to commit suicide.  Not only has it eased my crazy thinking_ I have been able to replace the negative thinking with only positive upbeat thinking and it has changed my entire life perspective.  We have to take some kind of responsibility for our behavior.  The prozac helped me enough to realize that I was not behaving properly_ that I was angry_ that I was mean and spiteful.  I decided to approach life with a totally new perspective.  No judgements_ letting go of anger_ forgiving and accepting responsibility for actions_ no gossip or drama.  What a huge difference this has made in my life.  I challenge everyone to try this!!!  I feel great_ I see life completely differently than I did when I tried to take my own life.  It's still tough_ life is hard_ but when I don't blow the molehills up into mountains_ it sure is different.  When I stop beating myself up_ it lets me control who is beating me up...and I don't allow it anymore.,F,48,8  months20MG 1X D,3/1/2012Email,Prozac

Still have some erratic energy levels (tired then energetic),I trust this drug_ period. Helps my focus/attention. I can get anxiety_ but no panic attacks. Like the long 1/2 life.

184, 4, Depression/Social Anxiety,Minor nausea after eating while I was taking the drug_ extreme nausea at all times of the day once I stopped taking the drug.,For me personally this drug worked wonders the first six months of taking it. I was started out on 20mg My confidence was high_ I began to love social events and meeting new people however larger groups still tended to raise slight anxiety just not nearly as bad as before. Before starting prozac I was about 150lbs and five feet tall because I would turn to eating to try and help my depression. After starting the drug I lost 30 pounds. My severe fatuige and constant emotional numbness and lack of motivation vanished after a month of taking Prozac. However after about a year I began to feel the effects of the medication wear off. Over the next four years I increased my dosage to 40mg and added Wellbutrin_ I never felt nearly as amazing as I did those initial six months however the medication did help tremendously. I quit cold-turkey and have been off Prozac for about 3 weeks now with no emotional side effects but SEVERE nausea. Personally_ my experience was great_ but everyone reacts to anti-depressants differently.,F,19,4  years40mg 1X D,1/12/2012,Prozac

189, 1, grief_ PTSD,Increased anxiety,This stuff has made me much worse.  At first_ I thought it was anxiety over upcoming colonoscopy but I now think it's the Prozac.  I'm worse than I was before I started taking it.  I take it in the AM but it still disrupts my sleep (not good).  I wake up wishing I was dead.  I fight the anxiety all day long_ it has affected the efficacy of the Xanax I take throughout the day.  I took one this morning after not taking it for the past two days and now wish I could throw up to get it out of me.  I don't know why doctors think they can medicate grief.  I lost my 23 year old daughter 7 months ago_ how am I SUPPOSED to feel?  This stuff is making my life a living hell as if it wasn't bad enough to begin with.

I was a senior in High School at the time (so_ 17-18 when taking Prozac) and it also made me moody and unmotivated.

193, 4, OCD_ Anxiety_ Depression,,I keep forgetting my password so I cannot edit my previous rating; I am the 28 year old male who did a review on 08/08/2011 complaining about long lasting drowsiness after my last dose.  I also did a review on 07/23/2011.To correct my review on 08/08/2011 where I stated I had drowsiness for two weeks after my last Prozac dose: I think there was initial drowsiness due to taking too much Prozac.  However for most of the days the drowsiness was likely due to the depression itself.  I say this because I was not on any medication recently and noticed drowsiness that lasted for two weeks.I tried Celexa and Prozac this week and within an hour any drowsiness I have goes away and I feel very alert.  So I think for me_ taking SSRIs in normal amounts causes me to be awake; however if I take way too much it causes me bad drowsiness.So I am changing my rating for Prozac back to a 4.  The minus one star is for some dry eyes.I am also experimenting with using a really small dose now - so that 0.6 mg is not a mistake.,M,28,56  days0.6 mg 1X D,8/31/2011Email,Prozac

195, 1, SA_ GA_ and Depression,24/7 ANHEDONIA_ NOT FEELING PLEASURE EVER_ delayed orgasm_ increased energy the first two months_ suicidal ideation on withdrawal,Prozac shut down my emotional world.  Sure you feel sleepy and you feel hungry.  But I didn't feel emotions that made life meaningful to me anymore such as all the different flavors of happiness.  They just went away.  It did have an anti-depressant effect_ so I wasn't crying and sulking_ which made OTHER people feel better about me_ but at the same time music meant nothing to me_ exercise wasn't pleasurable_ sex wasn't pleasurable_ nothing was pleasureable!  This seems to be a VERY common effect of the drug anecdotally.  There is medical literature on this issue of the drug_ sadly its sparse_ and many doctors don't seem concerned even if it is true that most people who take the drug don't experience pleasure.,M,20,4  months40 1X D,8/14/2011Email,Prozac

The jittery feeling went away after a few weeks; I am sure it also helps I am on a very low dose (2.5 mg).I still think that the drug makes me have a bit of a dry mouth and dry eyes.,The drug works very well for my depression; my mood is very good and my quality of life is better overall.

I had two toddlers at the time and my OB/GYN attributed the way I was feeling to post-hormonal changes.  I didn't know what to expect but within two weeks all I can say is my life got ""easier."" Things that used to bother me for years left my focus. The biggest gift this medicine gave me was relief from obsessive thoughts about food and dieting. I had been treated 20 years ago for an eating disorder and had been recovered for most of that time_ but the effect of taking Prozac made my daily conscious decision to control my urges to over or undereat go away. I cannot explain the relief. It was life changing. I only wish I had been put on this medicine years ago while I was in five years of therapy. Don't get me wrong; the therapy did wonders. I recovered from the darkness without drugs. But now I enjoy not having to fight so hard. What a blessing. I briefly switched to other meds (Lexapro_ Pristiq) but the obsessions came back.

My Dr. said ""exercise"" um_ when a pill(s) makes you feel like you cant do anything b/c you're so comatose how can you exercise? Honestly those 6 years are a blur. It helped the depression by making me feel nothing. I don't think that is how depression should be treated for me. I had NO sex drive_ I felt nothing. It was terrible and how can a side effect like major weight gain_ help with depression? It made me feel like a big fat blob that was numb and ugly. Maybe the dosage was too much_ the Dr. said it was the lowest she could recommend. I found out later that was a lie. Also the Tegretol greatly effects birth control.. again_ how does getting pregnant help with depession? It doesn't. I mention Prozac with the Tegretol b/c it's usually combined with one or the other for bipolar disorder.

226, 1, Asperger's / OCD,Mania....Hyper_ talkative_ self hurting herself_ aggressive_ releasing bodily fluids purposefully_ swearing...completely flipped into a different person!,"My daughter (11 y/o) was on Prozac for 3 years_ as well as Tenex.  She was on 10mg of Prozac for most of it and was on and off anxious and aggressive.  We put her on a few different anti-psychotic's (not at the same time) with the Prozac and Tenex and it may some difference for a while (little did I know we were probably treating symptoms of the Prozac at that time too).   Months later_ my daughter started becoming more obsessional so we increased her Prozac from 10mg to 20mg to 30mg and then to 40mg.  We also took her off the anti-psychotic med that we didn't see to be helping her much (but gain weight).  Now with the antipsychotic med off_ it wasn't able to camoflauge the side effects of the Prozac anymore.  She became terribly manic.  She was very talkative_ hyper_ very aggressive and needed to be restrained almost every day with Ativan given.  I took her off Prozac (only on Tenex now) and finally after 3 weeks off Prozac (takes a while to get out of their system) my daughter is soo much better.  I have not restrained her in about a week and she is soo much calmer.  I know it was the Prozac and what an awful thing it did to her.  It made her crazy.  Too often are doctors prescribing med's (antipsychotics)to treat the side effects of the antidepressants (Prozac_ etc).  Thank goodness our new doctor was willing to take her off these med's to see if her behaviors were ""her"" or the ""med's"".  They were the med's.

I know a lot of people who do pretty well on it_ but I've known people who got off of it too.It really only works if you lack seratonin. Prozac is totally over-prescribed for a lot of people who already have enough seratonin_ and that's...usually when it fucks you up.I took it for a week_ and it worked immediately the first or second day.I was really chilled out_ REALLY mellow_ it was great. I took a walk through the park and wow_ everything was clear and beautiful.At night however_ I couldn't sleep at all. I Got a few hours and would wake up staring at the clock every few minutes or so. One night_ I was even over-aware of my limbs and started examining my hands before forcing myself back to sleep...About halfway through the week I started getting dizzy spells_ and REALLY thirsty_ dry mouth down to the throat and deep rooted. No matter how much I drank_ it didn't go away.I got minor anxiety at night and just started freaking out about random things.The doctor had given me prozac for' anxiety/depression' which..was unneeded because I do not have depression due to a chemical imbalance.

If you have anxiety_ and not depression_ DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  The first time you take it_ you'll feel great.  Tons of energy and the world will seem brighter and happier.  Enjoy it--because it won't ever be like that again.  Instead_ you'll have insomnia and your head will feel like it's floating out of your body for two weeks.  Then the mood swings start--that's what did it for me.  After about a month of taking Prozac I started having MASSIVE mood swings.  Literally would go from happy to screaming at my husband_ to crying about something sad_ to laughing and being silly_ within an hour.  I woke up in the middle of the night and my heart was pounding and I was sweating and I thought I was gonna die.  I called my doctor and we stopped the Prozac.

I've thought about doing stuff like jumping out of the car while my mom's driving down the highway_ and just yesterday I almost touched a hot burner on the stove.  A friend of mine_ a junior in college studying psychology_ says that I'm probably thinking like this because my meds make me emotionally disconnected_ and danger or can give me an emotional high that I can't get from normal things anymore.,F,17,9  years5 MG 2X D,1/11/2011,Prozac

It was a lifesaver_ initially.Cons: My doctor originally told me I should expect to take Prozac for the rest of my life. I eventually fired him. It took me many years to get off this drug because withdrawal was so uncomfortable and long-lasting that I gave up and went back to it several times. -- I do not know if Prozac causes gastrointestinal problems or merely irritates them severely_ but BEWARE if you already have an ulcer or gerd; I came to dread taking my Prozac because the acid reflux pain that followed would last for 2 hours and was so bad that I considered going to the ER more than once. -- RBD_ directly attributable to Prozac_ nearly wrecked my marriage. I kicked and slugged my poor husband many times during my Prozac-fueled nightmares. This side effect lingered for nearly a year after stopping the drug. -- I noticed the emotional blunting kicking in after about 2 years. You don't get excited about anything_ nor do you feel particularly sad about anything. You just don't feel. As an example of the impact that can have_ I was unable to shed a tear at my dear father's funeral_ because I was on Prozac. -- My bottom-line recommendation: Take this drug seriously.

During my years under the influence of prozac_ I was more relaxed and at ease socially.  Every day things wouldn't bother me; I didn't feel any ups & downs - everything just felt OK and level.  In retrospect that was a problem as I was happy to stay in situations that would normally bother/annoy me such as jobs where I didn't like the people I worked with.  I would just be on cruise control and had a didnt-care attitude.  So even though I didn't have unpleasant feelings_ I felt I did not truly grow as a person with all that I experienced. It was sort of like time that just went by.  In retrospect I wish I just dealt with raw life without this chemical barrier and used other means to cope.

My doctor has tried to add other anti-depressant medications_ but the side effects were intolerable_ so I've learned to deal with the symptoms that Prozac no longer relieves.

Slow but steady weight gain.,Although I have been on Prozac for 20 years and it was wonderful for awhile_ it stopped working long ago for depression.  My big concern is that my memory has gotten worse over the years and I'm worried it could be caused by the Prozac_ so I am very slowly weaning myself off it to see if I notice an improvement.I think the memory issue is more than just the normal age-related decline.

I do not trust generics. I've heard some real sad stories from friends taking generics. I was told the pharmacies ""push"" generics because they make more profit on them. I want pharmacies _or any business_ to  make all the money they can. However_ I draw the line on generics. I don't like generic foods or soft drinks either.

I started on 20mg_ and I'm now taking 30mg. I have noticed a big difference in how I feel. I get excited about little things now that normally would have meant nothing to me. I enjoy shopping and music again. I'm actually decorating for Christmas which I haven't done in years. I'm nicer to people_ especially customers at my job. I feel like I want to be friendly to people. I like to make people happy now. I feel like I like my boyfriend more than usual. Someone at work actually told me_ ""You look so happy today!"" and honestly_ no one has ever said that to me before. It's always_ ""What's wrong?"" I'm so so happy my doctor decided to try prozac_ I feel like I'm becoming a new person. After about 6 years of being depressed_ it's definitely a welcome change.

Yes. I don't have panic attacks and it has helped my premenstrual disorder. But at what cost? I am always nervous and restless. I am irritable and easily angered.

287, 5, Premature ejaculation_ IBS,I began taking Prozac after research that indicated that it helped perhaps 12x greater than a commonly prescribed premature ejaculation drug.  I have to say that it indeed does work for me_ providing more control than previously.  But not only did it help there_ it had two other beneficial side effects: It helped enormously with constipatory irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that I had suffered from for 20 years.  It also has had a beneficial mental health benefit that is subtle but definite.  I feel it has mellowed me and permitted me to approach things less rashly_ though it takes none of the edge off that is needed sometimes in order to get things done.,This has been a wonder drug for me in terms of my IBS - will stay on 10 mg per day indefinitely as it has changed the quality of my life rather remarkably.,M,49,2  years,11/28/2009,Prozac
288, 4, Anxiety and depression/ADD/insomnia,Initial side effects were increased anxiety and insomnia_ but those abated within days and an improved mood replaced them. I have gained weight_ but I also have hypothyroidism_ so not sure what's to blame. I also feel pretty drowsy and foggy sometimes_ so added Wellbutrin and that seems to help. Recently_ heartburn has become an issue_ which I have only experienced in pregancy before. My libido and orgasmic ability are probably a little decreased_ but not absent.,The most obvious and immediate benefit of taking Prozac for me was the ability to sleep without sleeping pills. I am very sensitive to drugs and had to start taking it like 1 mg at a time. Side effects were short and relief was worth it. I stayed on 10 mg for a while_ but needed to raise it to 20 mg at some point. That made me tired. Also_ the Prozac did not improve my ability to concentrate_ so Wellbutrin was added slowly and the combo seems to keep me pretty functional as a mom of two little kids through a marital separation_ possile loss of our home_ and financial stress. The side effects are worth the ability to care for my children.,F,40,3  years,11/6/2009,Prozac

290, 1, Depression,"Hospitalized with diagnosis of probable acute heart attack.  Interestingly it turned out to be the ""panic attack from hell.""  Hallucinations_ nightmares_ intense anxiety_ fainting.","On the first day of taking Prozac the trees seemed prettier.  On the second day songs on the radio brought tears to my eyes.  Later that day abruptly it felt like someone had hit me across the chest with a baseball bat.  I went to the ED who diagnosed me with a probable heart attack and spent then night in the ICU.  The next day a lack of cardiac enzymes said: ""no  heart attack.""  What happened is this: Prozac and most SSRI's are metabolized by the Cytochrome P-450 liver enzymatic systems. Some people have very inactive systems.  This is not a problem (usually) but in the case of Prozac_ perhaps I could metabolize 1mg/day where for a normal person they might metabolize 10-20mg.  So what happened is that I rapidly built up a toxic level.  I found out later that my sister and neice had the same thing happen.In short_ if Prozac works for you_ great.  But if you rapidly get increased anxiety or experience a major anxious response it is likely that you too have a less active Cytochrome P450 system and if so avoid all SSRI's.  Try an antidepressant that does not use this system like Remaron_ Serzone or Imipramine.",M,52,3  days,11/4/2009,Prozac

It was the most terrifying experience of my life_ especially the suicide thoughts  - yes_  I'm an anxious person but generally enjoy my life!

I also collapsed one morning in the lounge and my partner had to call the ambulance to take me to hospital_ and i had a low blood pressure.,The suicidal side effects of Prozac are very dangerous. Doctors are not advising you that this can happen when they prescibe the drug. I have since read the results of a large trial (12_000 people) in the UK_ where they found that there were no benefits to Prozac at all. In my opinion this drug is now a major embarrassment to the Drug and Medical profession as they appear to have been duped into believing that it was a cure for depression when now it has been proven not to work at all.,F,59,3  years,9/15/2009,Prozac

I started at an extremely low dose - 5 mg (.5 of the 10 mg capsules) and had immediate very adverse reactions.  Inability to think straight and ""seeing things"" is definitely bad and I was told to discontinue use - which I was happy to do.

I've never taken anything like this and my doctor didn't even tell me when I asked her why I was gaining all the weight - fool!  Anyway_ I did like the way it took the edge off.

It stops the really bad thoughts from getting out of hand_ like a safety net. Makes socialising much easier_ doing simple things are no longer a huge effort_ controls negative gloomy thoughts and makes sleeping pattern more normal. Effect on depression is stronger than on anxiety.One odd thing: the time it takes to kick in varies a lot. sometimes you feel better after 10 days_ other times it can take 4 weeks.

It was prescribed to me by a well known and reputable psychiatrist who I believe was more interested in where he was going to speak next than in treating me. He made up his mind right away about what was wrong with me and if I tried to tell him I felt differently he told me (And my mom) that I was lying. Prozac pushed me into a deeper depression and very severe manic states. It led to a month long hospitalization.

By January_ 2001_ I was put in the hospital for a two week stay where I was introduced to Prozac.  I was so ill that I went from 140 lbs. down to 114 lbs.  Eventually I couldn't walk or stand for any length of time.  I had no strength to do simplest of tasks such as lifting a gallon of milk or bending over to pick up objects.  I developed several autoimmune disorders such as fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism and obsessive compulsive thoughts ruled my life.  The doctor's diagnosis... I was dying.  They contemplated putting me into a nursing home but decided to increase my Zyprexia and Lithium dosages_ add Prozac to the mix and send me home.    During this time_ I would cry uncontrollably.  One day_ after approximately 4 weeks of Prozac therapy_ something clicked in my brain. Instantly_ to my surprise_ I no longer felt the need to cry.  Four months later_ I was healthy and strong enough,I've lived with depression most of my life but it usually followed a major event.  Then in February of 2000_ out of nowhere_ I was hit hard by depression. I couldn't sleep for days at a stretch.  If I closed my eyes_ I would see a light show of flashing colors and certain smells made me very dizzy.  My depression aggravated my fibromyalgia to the point of screaming pain and I developed debilitating migraines.    There were 2 components that contributed to my depression - hypothyroidism and abrupt menopause.  Did you know that hypothyroidism can cause psychosis?  When I went from regular  periods directly into menopause_ I was thrown into a hellish hormonal storm.  I took numerous antidepressants - trycyclics 1st_ then older SSRI's but none worked.  The newer generation of SSRI's like Celexa and Remeron put me in outer-space parking spaceships.

369, 4, depression and anxiety,nervousness,I'm highly sensitive to psychiatric drugs and at one point thought I couldn't be on antidepressants since they made my anxiety and agitation worse. My initial dose of Prozac was 5 mg which has helped quite a bit with depression and helps me from falling off the deep end emotionally -- but it also made me too hyper.  Doses of 3.75 mg and 3.3 mg (achieved by alternating 2.5 and 5 mg on different days) still made me nervous. Now I'm on 2.5.  I'm more emotional on this dose but I still consider it effective. I also tried Remeron and Lexapro which made me feel like I was having a nervous breakdown; Prozac in contrast for me has no side effects. At this dose_ my sexual response is still normal. I am still searching for relief for the anxiety side of my problem however.

I gave up on it because the side effects though diminished were still very negative and i felt worse than not taking anything.  Simply was not the right medication for me.  It has put me off SSRI's and has made me resistant to try other medications.,M,47,27  days,9/21/2008,Prozac
380, 4, Dysthymia,"I started taking prozac about 7 years ago for about 1.5 years. Although it was awhile ago_ I distinctly *do not* remember any day-to-day side effects like nausea or headaches. I had no weight gain. It started working about week 3 or 4. I'm not sure exactly when_ but somewhere around week 2 or three I basically lost my ability to orgasm. I could never have an orgasm during sex and only occasionally could I get myself off with a very powerful vibrator. That was totally unsatisfying. It's like everything went numb. At the time I was willing to make the sacrifice because of how bad off I was. When I started healing and feeling better (about 11 mos)_ this side effect got annoying and I worked to get off prozac. I went down to lower and lower doses_ but this did not help. Even one molecule of prozac in my system affected my orgasm completely. Finally I went off_ and it took  some time (maybe a year) to regain normal orgasmic capability. I never had a single sexual ""hang-up"" mentall",Even with the side effects_ prozac helped me immensely. I have no regrets about taking it_ and I am eternally grateful I had that option. I would not be who I am today or as happy and healthy if I hadn't had prozac. I had been in individual therapy for a year and group therapy (Al-Anon) for 3-4. They helped me gain perspective_ but I just couldn't stop the thoughts in my head. I had no separation from me and my negative thoughts and feelings. I was in a horrible cycle of self-recrimination and it was affecting my graduate work and all my relationships. I still remember when the prozac kicked in and_ although all my problems were still there_ I finally felt a distance between them and me. It was truly a miracle for me_ and I absolutely needed it  (in conjuntion with other means). I've been off of it for 4+ years and doing well.,F,28,1.5  years,9/17/2008,Prozac

I was given another ad for depression which I know believer was simply a side affect of the prozac I lost years messed up on antidepressants thanks to the first off lable perscribing of that first doctor.

386, 5, depression and OCD,I remember some heartburn (which was alleviated by eating a little before I took my dose).,I started with OCD and depression symptoms early in my first pregnancy (fall 1996).  So I took prozac during my pregnancy (that baby boy is now 11 and a principal's honor roll student_ perfectly healthy) and within 3.5 weeks_ the OCD and depression was gone!  I continued to take it for 5 years but went off of it_ on purpose_ with the second pregnancy.  Did not experience the OCD and depression as with the first pregnancy.  But as soon as I delivered my daughter (May 2001)_ I went back on the prozac and had no problems.  Continued to take it until spring of 2006 when I switched to Zoloft (still kicking myself for that).  I have had 2 depressive episodes and ebbing and flowing OCD symptoms since that (the latest episode began June 2008 and is still on and off).  I go back to the psychiatrist in a few weeks_ and will insist on switching back to the prozac.  No offense to the Zoloft folks_ but Prozac just worked wonderfully for me.,F,40,10  years,8/21/2008,Prozac

Although I cannot say for sure that the onset of presbyopia was due to Fluoxetine_ I was 33 at the time_ and that is quite a young age for presbyopia to start (not to mention quite a coincidence).  I discontinued the drug_ and while the numbness subsided_ the presbyopia has never gone away (it has been several years as I write this).  Oh--the Fluoxetine did nothing to ease my depressive symptoms.  If anything_ the awful side-effects made it worse.,M,33,6  weeks,8/20/2008,Prozac

Now I can go on and off Prozac and hardly get that at all. Less sexual side effects than Effexor for me. No other side effects for me!!,I can't say enough positive things about this drug!!  My psychiatrist allowed me to try them all--even MAO's.  I kept coming back to this one because it really is one of the best for me & also for a friend of mine.  I feel NORMAL_ focused_ calm but motivated_ not constantly berating myself_ positive_ pleasant_ joyful_ and really enjoying being with myself and others. I really notice the roses and smell them and thank God for medicine like Prozac!! I take 40mg daily. Takes several weeks for full effects but I feel better in several days.

Symptoms honestly seemed to dissipate in 2 days; now that it has been a week I am calm like my old self_ and for the first time in a long time_ have hope for the future. I have tried just about every antidepressant out there_ and Prozac cannot be beat (for me at least).

395, 4, Depression/Anxiety,Not too many at first_ although sometimes a bit jittery as in taking a bit too much coffee.  Mild insomnia at night.  After taking for a much longer period_ lowers libido and sexual performance.,It's a great drug_ although Prozac isn't for everyone.  Really helped me get through some tough times.  Also helps with obsessional thinking and OCD_ but in turn decreases random sexual thoughts. Did not gain much weight on it. I noticed improvement right away but takes several weeks for it to fully work.  Dampens libido and has some sexual side effects_ but less so than some of the older SSRIs. Currently trying some other meds with limited success.  May go back to Prozac in the standard or slightly higher dose.,M,28,7  years,7/3/2008,Prozac

After a month or so_ it made everything seem much less stressful and I stopped overreacting to everyday problems. However_ the severely decreased sex drive_ increased appetite_ vivid dreams_ and suicidal thoughts were too troubling to continue on the drug.,F,21,4  months,6/20/2008,Prozac

I have noticed that I'm a bit more tired_ and have less energy in general. But all in all_ these side effects are very very mild.,I've been on this for just about a year now_ for anxiety attack and deep depression due to Post Traumatic STress Disorder. So for me_ the fatigue is very mild_ and a bit hard to combat_ so I've put back on weight that I lost_ but for me_ it's worth it_ because it gets rid of the anxiety attacks and I have more of a zest for life_ I feel more in control_ rather than the PTSD being in control of me.,F,35,1  years,6/10/2008Email,Prozac

Now_ at the age of 30_ I find myself suffering slightly from postpartum and needed a little something to help me through. I turned to prozac for help. This time_ I experienced symptoms like nausea and sweating. HOWEVER_ these pale in comparison to one very frightening symptom- I lost consciousness for a few minutes when I was home alone with my son! At that moment_ I decided to wean myself off the drug_ but the next time I took it_ I once again felt nauseous and likely to faint. For some this drug is wonderful_ but be careful not to overdose!

But_ again I have Stepford wife syndrome. I just smile even at the worse arguments with spouse. I suppose that may be better than a brawl.

406, 5, depression/anxiety/anorexia/cutting,mild dizziness_ some nausea_ tiredness,I take currently 60 milligrams of Prozac but have been as high as 80 milligrams. It has helped me with regulating my depression and sorting out the hopelessness and suicidal tendencies I had beforehand. With my anorexia_ it has helped regulate my appetite which tends to increase greatly when I have bingeing periods but when on Prozac seems to help with a feeling of fullness. Overall the Prozac has been greatly helpful and has not cured my depression but has most defiantly has calmed down the more immediate symptoms and allows for alleviated living. It is a tool which I use along with personal work to try and work through daily depression and anorexia which is at times_ even on Prozac immobilizing.

The things that usually irritate me (noisy neighbors_ heavy traffic_ screaming kids) did not bother me at all.  I had never taken any meds for moods before_ and I know I'd never feel that good ""on my own"".  I probably would have continued it if it wasn't for the loss of sex drive.

This drug is lethal.,My PMS had become so bad that my life was a continual bout. I am sure that my doctor prescribed Fluoxetine to get me out of his office as quickly as possible. It should have been a last resort_ not a first choice of treatment. The side-effects were so violent that I really did think it would kill me. This is almost a year ago now and I'm still bitter about it. Another doctor prescribed the Pill and this has been fine. I would not recommend Fluoxetine to treat PMS_ no matter how bad it has become for any patient. I have been told that Fluoxetine has a 'good track record' for alleviating PMS but I think it is completely unsuitable_ in fact it is lethal. From what I have read on this site_ it should only be used to treat serious depression. For worsened PMS_ take the Pill. I recommend Loestrin 30.

422, 4, Anxiety_ panic_ OCD,Some insomnia initially. Headaches.,Very important!!! Prozac in a dose that is too high for you can actually cause depression and thoughts of self-harm and suicide. I've never been depressed but I have suffered from anxiety_ panic_ and OCD all my life. I started out at 10 mg prozac after trying Lexapro_ Zoloft_ generic Zoloft_ and Paxil. Even 10 mgs of prozac was way too high. All the meds I mentioned caused me to feel very depressed_ despondent_ hopeless_ no energy_ suicidal_ wanted to hurt myself. Prozac does this the least_ but it does still happen if I take too much. I am now on the liquid Prozac so I can take very tiny doses. I take about 1.5 mgs per day and that works very well on the panic and anxiety and doesn't cause depression. I've been taking Prozac for 8 months now.,F,51, ,3/18/2008,Prozac

For the first few weeks I had some insomnia but now I have become so use to these meds that if I go back on it_ that doesn't happen.,Overall_ worked well for me but eventually gave me migranes and killed me love life with my new husband. Too bad. I lost weight_ had energy_ and felt great. Remember though_ since we  all respond differently to certain meds_ it would be wrong to tell others to stay away since you had a bad experience. I never felt suicidal or any of those other types of side effect while taking any SSRI's and I have taken most of them. Keep in touch with a psychiatrist_ not a primary care M.D. and tell them when you have problems.,F,40,1  years,2/26/2008,Prozac
425, 3, depression/anxiety,so far...none.,well i have only been on 20 mg prozac for about 4 days because of depression mostly and little bit of anxiety.And honestly after only 4 days i feel a little better.I know it takes longer to work fully but i find myself not thinking depressing thoughts all day_and im also being much more patient with people( i used to be snappy).I found myself smiling the other day for no reason and thats when i knew it was helping alittle!im going thru a breakup from a 6 year relationship and i was thinking about my ex and how sad i was about it all the time_but since i started it hasnt been as bad.The first day i took it it did make me very emotional and i was crying uncontrollably_but after that it has seemed to be helping. i hope and pray it continues to only get better.,F,22,4  days,2/24/2008,Prozac

I always wanted to sleep and I would sleep for 16 hours a day. I had no energy to do anything at all. and the weight gain was awful 61bs. and I am only 5 feet tall so that is alot of a little girl. I used to have a great sex drive even before the medicine but this just made it go away and I did not want anything to do with sex anymore. Now I am on Wellbutrin XL and what a difference. I guess that was not the drug for me. My husband takes Prozac and is doing great! SO I guess it depends on the person.,F,31,4  months,2/20/2008Email,Prozac

Prozac seems to get along well with any of the other drugs I get prescribed.  I seem to have to change my seizure/stabilizer drugs often... still looking for the right mix.  The Prozac stays constant_ though.  Take me off it_ and I am depressed to the point of killing myself within less than two weeks.

After awhile (and with the help of a mood stabilizer)_ i no longer needed anti-anxiety meds and i just generally felt like a good person. home life and friendships improved. work improved. but after about a year of taking the stuff_ i started getting horrible acid-reflux and vomiting_ beginning a few minutes after taking the pill and sometimes continuing all day. after stopping all meds i eventually had my psycho symptoms back_ but I no longer felt physically sick anymore.  i still recommend prozac_ though_ as i'm pretty sure the acid reflux and vomiting stuff is a fairly rare side effect. for myself_ i'm going to try something new.,F,,1  years,1/24/2008,Prozac

Horrendous withdrawal symptoms when I stopped taking the drug and I have now been diagnosed with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity as a result of my toxic exposure to Prozac and I still have the seizures (grand mal and petit mal) that I developed very shortly after I started taking the drug.,This drug should be banned.  I can not believe that a drug that has been linked to suicidal thoughts is being given to vulnerable people who are experiencing depression.  What's even more unbelievable is the fact that there are so many vested interests in the prescribing of these drugs_ the drug's manufacturer have not been prosecuted for withholding negative information from the clinical trials relating to this drugs.

438, 5, Depression,None,When my doctor put my on Prozac_ it was like somebody turned the lights on in the room.  I complimented my wife on how nice she looks_ I'd pet the dog instead of bitching at it_ my energy and interest levels of everything I was doing in my life went up.  After being on Prozac for about 7 years_ I thought_ I don't need this anymore.  I dropped my dosage in half for a couple months than went totally off the drug.  I immediately felt the blues come back and went back on it and just take one pill every day and life is good.  A fantastic drug.  Thanks for whoever created it.,M,62,15  years,1/15/2008,Prozac

442, 5, Depression,Decrease in libido,I had been depressed for years_ and was suicidal before I began on Fluoxetine. The difference was almost immediate - within two weeks my mood improved_ I felt less socially awkward_ more gregarious_ etc. It has made a huge difference in my life_ and I feel like it has allowed me to mature and become more comfortable with who I am. It has significantly decreased my sexual libido_ but it's still worth it compared to being suicidal.,M,27,2.5  years,12/30/2007,Prozac

And as my doctor increased my dosage_ I never experienced the shakiness again.,It's not a cure all_ I still feel a bit of the anxiousness/fear at times_ I just don't get a full blown attack (you know_ the kind that leave you shaking in terror) anymore. It also does nothing for the nightmares. But the depression is GONE_ I'm no longer in that black hole_ I have way more energy_ I'm not lying in cold sweat of terror at night_ and in general_ I feel like me again and more importantly more capable of handling the PTSD. Not a wonder drug but it helps tremenously with almost no side effects.,F,35,2  months,12/27/2007Email,Prozac

Cymbalta_ Buspar_ Dalmane and ? too lazy to go see what the 5th one is. Sometimes I wish I could just die in my sleep and not have to hurt and be so depressed all the time.  I joined a group on depression and one for shyness.  Those are the only times I leave my house except to go see my Psychiatrist.  I can't die damn it_ my daughter is only 15 and she needs me_ for what I'm worth but she has begged me not to leave her again because when I had my stroke and was gone for months she wasn't treated well by my own family!

My depression diminished_ I was able to get out of bed_ I did not obsess over everything as much as I used to and my bulimia was in check.Then it stopped working_ my Dr increased my dosage but to no avail. I stopped taking it and switched to Wellbutrin_ then zoloft then lexapro but none worked like Prozac initially did.After  a long break from taking Prozac_ I am ready to try it again.

Prozac changed my life in the most positive way - after taking I felt how I imagined most ""normal""_ non-depressed people people felt.

451, 5, Depression,I have taken this off and on for over 15 years. Initially_ effects were as I imagine speed: muscle/back/jaw tension_ then effects seemed to morph into a more sleepy side-effect. Sex drive was initially muted_ but now seems relatively benign_ or maybe my drive has increased with age. Not sure. Sex remains enjoyable but orgasms are more challenging_ for sure. One thing I worry about is my memory: I notice there are gaps_ entire experiences I don't recall that others do. Not sure if that is middle age or the drug_ but it seems to increase when I take it.,I remember when I first took it feeling remorse that I had waited so long to experience life without the sadness that had colored most of my life prior to this. It was truly a wake-up call: that my emotions could be challenged chemically_ that there was a drug that could help me be joyful_ happy_ confident_ and not mopey_ moody and prone to serious blues. I don't like being on a drug for the rest of my life_ but know that serious depression (father had shock therapy_ brother hospitalized) is in my family_ so will probably stay on it for the foreseeable future. I don't want to get stuck as I have in the past in gloom and doom. Life is too short_ and I want my child to know a parent that can fully embrace life.,F,46,17  years,11/22/2007,Prozac

I stopped taking it for a while_ got really depressed_ now I'm taking 20mg again.  Ugh.  On top of all of that_ I'm not really feeling like it's helping the depression.  It might actually be making a dent in my social anxiety though_ I find myself less anxious in social situations.  But the side effects are too much for me to deal with.

Don't know why it took so long for a doctor to give me this instead of zoloft. Welbutrin has also worked_ but not to the degree that Prozac has. The only thing that I don't like is that after a few months of being on it the ""happy relief"" feeling went away and was replaced with a little complacency. My doctor says there are various theories on why this happens but she said that it does happen. It has worked great for my severe PMS/PMDD as I am seriously intolerant of any type of birth control pill.",F,33,5  months,11/9/2007,Prozac
455, 5, OCD/Depression/Anxiety,I took Prozac for a year in college and it really helped my symptoms but it made me feel tired_ hungry_ and it killed my sex drive.  Since then I've tried a lot of different drugs and the best combination for me was effexor/wellbutrin but I gained weight on it and my acne increased.  Recently I went back on Prozac and I have been taking 18 MG of Concerta with it and it is fantastic.  The concerta counters all the side effects of the Prozac.  I feel really good.,Prozac alone works great but makes me tired.  Prozac with concerta is working really well for me with very few side effects.

I also found myself going out and drinking more than usual_ maybe because i was seeking some energy and excitement after sitting around all day. my job requires an ability to hold a bunch of tasks in my head and problem solve in a linear manner very quickly and accurately. i am normally extremely good at this. i found the drug took my ""edge"" away so i was unable to perform properly. CONCLUSION: less bad days_ but no good ones! i also found taking this at bedtime helped_ taking it in the morning",F,40,5  weeks,7/23/2007,Prozac

483, 5, Depression / Anorexia,When I first started taking Prozac_ 60mg per day I had some weird visual disturbances_ a bit like hallucinations_ which was bizarre_ but I had it checked out at the Opthalomology department_ and there's nothing wrong with my eyes.,This drug has made my life tolerable again_ and have been stable and content for some time. My only concern is that withdrawal may cause problems.,F,24,4.5  years,7/20/2007,Prozac
484, 3, OCD / Depression,Extremely exhausted all the time and a lot of weight gain_ difficulty reaching orgasm.,I took Prozac about 10 years ago for over a year.  At the time_ it was one of the only well-known SSRIs on the market.  It was my first time on an antidepressant for my OCD and I was extremely happy with the results.  It improved my mood dramatically and made me see myself in a whole new light.  That being said_ the side effects for me were dramatic.  I gained at least 20 lbs in a year (and I was 22 and very active_ not at all fat).  I also could not stop sleeping.  I was always tired and it made it hard to work and go to school.  It was very easy to withdraw from it though.  I did lose all the weight within 3 months of going off it without really trying.  People thought I found a miracle diet!,F,33,1.5  years,7/18/2007,Prozac

I also forget to pay bills_ appointments etc. This is very unusual for me. I'm a very organized person_ but not on Prozac. I feel so ""good"" that I'm not phased by consequences of my actions. It's bizarre. Although I'm no longer depressed_ I'm not sure how long my husband can handle living with the ""child-like"" me.

I gave the drug 8 weeks to work because I was told the side effects would go away.  Well_ they didn't!  Prozac made me worse.  I feel like I've had a chemical lobotomy!,I thought the side effects would subside after discontinuing the med_ but 8 weeks post discontinuation and I am still suffering from the side effects and can barely function. I was a happy and content person before taking Prozac for mild depression due to a miscarriage. Now I am just a shell of the person I once was. I can barely work_ my husband has become my caretaker_ things I used to enjoy I have no interest in.  I just pray that Prozac did not cause permanent brain damage. I know these drugs help some people_ but please_ please_ please think twice about taking an SSRI_ especially if you are dealing with mild to moderate depression. I've learned the hard way that doctors don't really know much about severe adverse effects of SSRIs and there is no treatment for people like me who still suffer from persistant adverse effects.

I've also completely lost my taste for caffeine_ which is good because Wellbutrin and caffeine do NOT mix!,"I'm taking Prozac with Wellbutrin_ both low dosages.  I suffered (for years) with PMS_ then perimenopause hit and my moods were up and down.  Cried_ got angry_ irritable_ depressed.  This happened every month for a few days until finally my doctor put me on a combination of prozac and wellbutrin.  Took about 8 or so weeks to kick in_ but what a difference!  I still feel some irritability with PMS_ but NOTHING like it used to be.  I also find a ""detachment"" from things that previously would have really bothered me.  Every day now is stable and my outlook is much improved.  I should have sought medical help a long time ago for this PMS/perimenopause issue.

I'd have to say after trying so many different medications_ Prozac was one of the best meds I've taken. I didnt even feel like I was on anything (besides for the low sex drive). Give it a full 8 weeks to feel the full difference in yourself. Side effects might happen_ but they should disapear after a few weeks. Just stay with it the 6-8 weeks before you make your decision. I stopped taking after 3years of being on it. I felt like I was better and didnt need it anymore. I did good for about a year_ but then my anxiety and depression came back full force.

First and foremost_ I did feel a little better and had better erections with the Prozac_ that's it!  The most important advice I can give a person making the change_ do it slowly_ withdrawal from Paxil is painful and emotional.  Initially I just stopped one and started the other.

Maybe for some people with severe depression this provides relief_ but for me the side effects far outweigh any potential benefit.

It got really bad and I stopped taking prozac in January 2007. I have now started on wellbutrin and already the memory loss and sleepiness has stopped.

I'm on day 4 of a 10mg/day dose (same as before) and I have experienced dry-mouth_ jitters_ and nausea. I'm a little concerned because this is very different from my experience before. As I said_ I'm only on day 4_ so I'm hoping they'll go away. Also_ I'm thinking of trying and alternative to treat te anxiety (yoga or something) so the Prozac can just work on the depression.

536, 2, Depression_stress_pmdd,I did not do well with this drug. I took it for 27 days @ 20mg. I took it on time everyday in the afternoon. It made me Very tired_induced severe anxiety_panic attacks_insomnia_night sweats_shaking_elevated blood pressure_chills_brain numbness_out of body feeling. It was horrible! I had to eventually start taking Xanax along with the Prozac to try and control the anxiety it was creating. While it certainly made my moods better (It did it's job in that respect) it made me feel hyper and like I might lose my mind. It was a funny feeling and I felt so restless at certain times during the day or evening.,I think it is great for the right person who can tolerate the side effects. My sister has been on it for years and does great with it. My brother was put on it and had the same reaction that I did. I guess it just depends on the person.,F,40,27  days,3/10/2007,Prozac

538, 5, Anxiety/Depression,Yawning. Dry mouth at the beginning.,Amazing. Highly recommend. Couldn't wipe the smile off my face at first(in between yawning.) I tried 3 other drugs over the years but stopped quickly due to reactions and didn't want to bother with another. After a friend committed suicide_ I became depressed and decided to try once again. I only take 10mg. It's changed my life. I'm calmer and I also received a promotion within months of starting it. I attribute it in part to  less worrying and anxiousness.,F,46,2  years,3/7/2007,Prozac
539, 5, Acute depression,In the beginning a slight decrease in appetite.,Prozac turned my life around.  For the first time in 30 years I was finally able to live my life minus all the negative thinking and depression.  I began taking prozac in 1989 after discovering a chemical imbalance that caused my ongoing depression.  Today after 18 years and still taking prozac_ I am healthy with no major negative side effects.  Prozac is my miracle drug.,F,51,18  years,3/6/2007,Prozac
540, 5, severe depression,first week easily angered.,this is number 4 for me. the last was celexa which did really well but the problem was it made me so tired i could fall asleep anywhere. after 3 months i had to change. i like what it did for me except the extreme tiredness. if wasnt for that would still be on celexa. NOW on to the prozac. first week was hard. easily angered. not just mad but very angry. it had two sides to it. felt very good in control but could lose it quick. in second week now and that is gone. definately helps knock the edge off and feel like im leveling out. dont let the name scare you. its in the same family of meds that celexa is. wish you all luck.,M,36,2  weeks,3/6/2007,Prozac

Two weeks have passed already_ and my libido is not back. I've tried 6 other antidepressants_ and it's never happened to me before. Can anyone tell me what the hell is going on ?

Did not boost my ood however but did the trick re: the paxil w/d side effects.  With prozac I had no paxil withdrawal problems.,,F,43,40  days,2/16/2007,Prozac

Though_ i went off about a year_ and the panic attacks came again_ and the headaches returned. I do recommend taking prozak AND seeing a pshcyologist.,I heard after 10 years_ it affects your liver?

549, 5, bulimia,slight loss of body sensation_ including sexual sensation; occasional nausea,It took about 2 weeks for the effects to totally kick in_ though I could feel it in my body the first day. After it fully kicked in_ I have not binged or purged one time_ nor do I want to ever. I have suffered with bulimia for three years and have tried everything non-pharmaceutical under the sun. I am completely amazed at how this has worked for me! I am like a new person. I would really encourage bulimics to try this. (I started with 20 mg. and just went to 40 to take the additional edge off.),F,28,31  days,2/6/2007,Prozac

Now im learning about social anxiety and trying to put my life back together.  My whole life was hell because of this and prozac has got me back on track.

553, 5, Anxiety/Panic Attacks & Depression,Possible weight gain_ not sure if directly related,I am sorry to see so much negative postings on Prozac_ and hope readers understand all drugs effect each of differently and that this drug could possibly be a solution for you. As a result of a divorce & ending of a 13 year relationship I began having severe panic attacks. I was contemplating suicide daily and put myself in positions where I was hoping/inticing negative outcome (I was a Police Officer at the time). I turned to my Doctor and shared with him my thoughts..after trying 3 different meds he put me on Prozac which completely eliminated my attacks and gave me a general better outlook on life and living. I must admit_ as a added bonus it gave me 95% complete control of my orgasms_ which has been nice through the years. As a youth I was very tempermental and hot headed at times_ Prozac took all this away and made me deal with things much more clear headed. I have been on Prozac for 12 years now and I am certain I would probably be in jail or dead had it not been for this dru,M,37,12  years,2/5/2007,Prozac
554, 4, Situational Depression,Yes_ I DID receive relief from my depression_ however_ I felt lazy more often.  In addition_ Prozac seemed to make me feel less empathetic.,I noticed my shopping habits changed and I was shocked!

555, 1, For constant severe head pain,Constant thoughts of suicide_ hallucinated my own suicide over and over all day_ and in nightmares all night long. I was listless_ unable to interact with anyone---I would see people talking and wonder how they knew what to say to each other_ and I am normally an extrovert with tons of friends. When I reported these side affects to my drs_ they increased the dosage_ kept telling me it would help my pain. I had sexual dysfunction_ breast tenderness_ and experienced two episodes of serotonin syndrome on this med.,This is a dangerous med in so many ways. The new reports of side affects are just the tip of the iceberg. The FDA finally put warnings on the drug for children_ but despite signing petitions that over 500_000 others signed about the dangers of prozac to adults_ the FDA refuses to listen to us.,F,58,6  months,2/4/2007,Prozac

558, 5, bulimia,nausea_ mild tremor_ insomnia_ night sweating,Am currently on 40 mg and my bulimic behaviors have DRAMATICALLY decreased.  I am happier than I've been in a very long time.  I have gained some weight_ but likely not due to the drug_ but rather due to the fact that I am no longer purging meals.  I really do not like the night sweating though.  Sometimes it can be pretty bad.,F,29,2  months,1/11/2007,Prozac
559, 5, Depression/Anxiety,increased anxiety initially_ borderline panic_ mild in[para]somnia_ listlessness and lethargy. Sometimes I still feel like the prozac still gives me anxiety_ but I'm not too sure as to whether it's a decreased form of residual anxiety that will dissipate as the dosage is increased_ or if it's caused by the stimulating effect of prozac itself.,"I've taken this medication when for 6 years from when I was 12 til I was 18 and worked great. I stopped it and within a year my depression began to take hold. This time around_ I feel as though my depression is somewhat different_ the prozac has taken the edge off my depression and anxiety but it hasnt cured my like it has before. I may need to increase the dosage and augment it with a medication that inhibits the reuptake of Dopamine and Norepinephrine such as Wellbutrin (which I have actually began today). As of now_ i've been on 40MG daily for the past 2 months. Averaged out_ I feel about 60% better than I was at my worst_ 80-90% better on my good days_ only 30-40% better on my bad days. My trend of depression is rather odd and close to that of ""double depression"". I'll usually feel fine for a few days and almost forget i have depression_ then i'll fall back into depression for the next few days. The prozac hasnt worked as well as it has before.

561, 5, depression_ ocd_ panic,WEIGHT LOSS (which i didn't like_ as i am already skinny)_ sweating at night_ vivid dreams_ poor sleeping_ and itchy skin.,"I began taking 5mg and slowly increased the dosage to 20mg over a period of 60 days. I truly feel prozac is a drug one should begin slowly_ as there is no ""one"" dosage for everyone. I truly feel starting with a low dose is one of the main reasons why i barely suffered any ""negative"" side effects! I have now been on Prozac for 5 months and have never been happier in my entire life!!!! I have a theory that part of the reason this drug worked so well is because i do not drink_ smoke_ do illegal drugs_ and was not taking any other over the counter drug or prescription drug at the same time as starting prozac. I began taking birth control last month and BAM_ i began to feel like crap. Whether due to mixing the two or the birth control_ my point is_ certain negative ""side effects"" people may think is being causes by the prozac could be coming from something else they are taking_ or poor health habits in general!",F,27,5  months,1/2/2007Email,Prozac

In fact_ i swear my sex drive went way UP! I have no problem reaching orgasm_ and actually find i get horny easier_ i think this is due to the prozac lifting the heavy burden of stress and depression off of my back!

Just wnated to die! Maybe would have been better to start off at 10mg instead of 20mg?,I started taking prozac in 1997 for mild depression after a breakup and it worked great!  I went off a few times because of the sexual side effects but went back on everytime_ eventhough I was not really depressed_ because I was less angry and moody on the drug.  I went off earlier this year due to pregnancy then went back on after miscarriage. I never had start up side effects in the past_ but this time I had to stop after 4 weeks because the side effects were getting worse_ not subsiding. I was literally disabled for for the entire start-up period and I am still recovering 5 days later. I gave Prozac a 5 rating because it was so helpful for so long.  If I were to rate it based soley on this experience I would give it a 1. Prozac had always been a good friend to me_ but not anymore.  I am going to miss it! :-(,F,43,4  weeks,12/29/2006,Prozac

IMO it's not worth taking for mild irritability_ I would rather try higher doses of B vitamins etc rather than take this stuff.  I may also have to search for something else to help mild irritability that comes with pms.  I have been taking this stuff since spring 2004.,F,42, ,12/19/2006Email,Prozac

(I took it for about a year when I was about 20.)  Other minor side effects.,You will (typically) have to increase the dosage every so often to experience its positive effects.  It will eventually stop giving you benefits no matter how much of it you take.  I was very lucky to take only 20mg a day for a relatively short period of time.  Be warned_ it will not live up to its promises.  Additionally_ I don't want it to sound like the side effects I experienced were minor.  My aggression and anger increased and I could very well be sitting in a jail cell today or dead from suicide because of the unpredictable_ powerful effects of Prozac on the brain.

Extremely horrific withdrawal reaction that took two months to subside,Sent me manic_ psychotic_ and cognitively impaired although initially it helped my concentration. Made me anxious yet disinhibited so i didn't care what others thought of my behaviour. Withdrew due to frontal lobe syndrome which it_ although very rare_ can induce. Withdrawal was hell.

I began on 10mg_ then stopped.,My doctor seems reluctant to put me on anything else. When I told the doctor that 10mg gave me nightmares_ he wanted me to try it again at 20mg.

I am now making necessary changes in my life - having courage to do stuff that before I was just hopeless and in despair.  There is only one side effect I still have - insomnia.  I wake up after 3 or 4 hours and sometimes need a sleeping pill to get back to sleep.  But apart from that_ no negative side effects.  I am feeling very positive now about this medication - it really does take about 3 weeks at least before you start to notice the change - stick with it.,"FYI: I am actually taking the generic Prozac ""Fluox""",F,29,3  weeks,11/15/2006,Prozac

On 20 mg. I think I need more xanax for anxiety; and Xanax can cause more depression.  I am not sure if anyone else is on prozac for PTSD; I also have adhd_ depression and obsess about suicide. The suicidal thoughts are a little bit better than when I was on Cymbalta_ which made them worse. I don't think anything can help as much as a really good psychotherapist who understands PTSD and really studies this and cares a lot.I have that good fortune; I do think I am a bit more stable on prozac (generic) than without; I don't know why cymbalta was so horrible for me though since most people like that one.,F,50,3  months,11/14/2006Email,Prozac

I was on 60mg/day initially then tapered to 40mg/day since 1995. This year_ I started experiencing similar thoughts_ anxieties and 'fuzziness' I had back at the start of my treatment in 1995. I went back to counselling_ and counselor sees loss of effectiveness in Prozac at current dosage. She is now increasing dosage back to 60mg/day to see if it lifts me out of black funk. Next item on protocol agenda_ if this move isn't effective_ is to move to next anti-depressant (Zoloft?).

584, 3, moderate depression,Worst side effects for me (at 20mg/day) are difficulty sleeping_ muscles sometimes ache throughout entire body_ and I get extremely sleepy in the afternoon.   Minor side efffects include jaw clenching at night - once caused me to chip my teeth; restless legs when sleeping; and decrease in sex drive and function.,For the most part_ this medication eliminates the dark thoughts and improves my mood and energy level to nearly normal_ but not as energetic as I was in the past.  The medication basically works for me as an antidepressant_ but does not work as well as I would like.  At 20mg/day or more_ drowseyness is sometimes so much of a problem for me that I really can't function.  After experimenting with different doses_ I found that 10mg/day provides most of the desired effects with greatly reduced side effects.

586, 4, Depression,Just to report on my first week taking this drug at 20mg/day - I experienced a few side effects in the first 3-4 days but they have subsided now - the main side effects were insomnia and a complete loss of appetite.  7 days now and these side effects havew disappeared.  I would not say that my depression has disappeared yet_ but I definitely feel less anxious than last week.  I feel calm.,I would like to warn anyone who is just starting out on this drug that they should expect a brief 'low' during the first few days_ but this should go away.  I researched it_ and apparently the drug sort of briefly 'tears down' the chemical structures that control your mood in order to 'rebuild' them_ so hang in there if you actually feel worse on day 2 or 3 - I did_ but it soon went away and now i am starting to feel a little better.  I will post back after 2 weeks to let you know the changes (if any).,F,29,1  weeks,10/30/2006,Prozac

It was time to fix that- so I tried Prozac_ starting on a dosage of 10 mgs.

Then a little more than a week later_ the side effects came_ but they were bearable- by the time I had been on it for about 4-5 weeks_ I had increased the dosage to 20 mgs with little to no side effects and I was feeling better than I had ever thought I could before I was on it. The side effects went away and I was feeling much less paranoid and a whole lot happier overall plus my PMS was barely noticeable.

Blood pressure went from routine normal to mid-range high and doctor couldn't find out why in tests and physicals. Headaches.  Lethargy so bad that I could not even get up to go to work and eventually lost my job. Knew I had deadlines_ love the work_ absolutely could not even get out of bed_ not due to depression but to lethargy and fatigue. By the time I was pulled off of it I was sleeping 16-18 hours a day and desperately willing to sleep more except needed to go to work or fix dinner_ etc. No desire to see people most of the time. Instead of taking pride in a clean house_ barely did minimal requirements. Had desires at times to hit people due to anger_ though I never hit anyone. Stomach problems that became so severe_,3 months later_ hair is growing back on my eyebrows and eyelashes. As of a follow up 2 days ago_ my BP is normal_ and I've never taken meds to correct the BP. I'm off Protonix and all other stomach meds. I sleep normal hours. Looking for work. Sense of humor has returned. If I get angry_ it's appropriately handled by me and it's for a legitimate reason.

I take Trazadone to be able to sleep.  I went off of Prozak once to shut my husband and mother up.  3 mos. later I was in bed_ fetal position_ crying my eyes out.  They begged me to go back on it and its worked ever since!!!  Now I have my mother-in-law telling me that she read somewhere that Prozak is bad for my heart and liver_ never heard about this before.

I've tried Paxil (Horrible!)_ Welbutrin (alone and with the Prozac - the combination is best)_ and a few others that I quit within a few weeks due to side effects that were much worse than with Prozac.   The combination of my major depression and anxiety disorder cause me to have anger and irritablity problems as well as classic depression symptoms like lethary_ brain fog_ and lack of motivation.  Within a week or two after I start taking it_ Prozac makes me calmer_ more relaxed_ and better able to handle stress. It starts to relieve the depression symptoms at about 4 weeks.

At the same time I was pretty hyper and when I took a Prozac and some allergy medication at the same time_ my heart started beating so quickly I thought I might need to go to the hospital.  But gradually the ""high"" and hyperness of the drug wore off.  After a couple years it wasn't really cutting it and I was crying again at the drop of a hat_ etc.  Also I lost a lot of weight right away on the drug_ but after a couple years I packed it back on then some.  The problem with Prozac is that you have to keep uping the dose.  It did help me immensely with sociaphobia and eating issues that I obsessed about.  I went off the drug and things got worse_ so my doctor recommended lexipro.  It is supposed to be more efficient.

686, 5, Depression; OCD; Anxiety,Some weight gain_ dry mouth.,I say thank God for Eli Lilly!  I suffered from depression that would keep me in bed for days; when i wasnt depressed I lived in fear of the depression returning.  I've been on this drug since it was in research_ stupidly deciding that I would try to go without it twice.  That was ridiculous because my life began to fall apart and I began to self medicate with other drugs.  Prozac has allowed me to cope with life and remain clean and sober for 11 years.  If you don't like Prozac_ don't take it.  But please respect the fact that there are people who's lives and the lives of their families have been made whole and meaningful with this medicine.,F,47,18  years,7/22/2005Email,Prozac

I need the seratonin which prozac gives me. gave up 3 times - all resulting in terrible experiences. Prozac has saved my life - SUCK IT AND SEE! if it's not for you_ that's fine. But if it is - it can save your life. Sure_ I still have problems and get down and worried_ but now I feel more whole and myself - can function better.

I never had a problem with drinking before_ nor has anyone in my family as far back as anyone can recall. I never went back to that OB/GYN...I went to a mental health pro who diagnosed me as Bipolar II... Prozac (& antidepressants in general) were the WORST possible thing to give me.

Prozac does that to you . It does cure depression however_ I was mildly depressed and trying to self-med and treat and balance my serotonin levels_ however_ it totally fucked with me and I put on weight (2 years after prozac the weight is still here) ... (I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD EXCESS FLAB) ... I was the kind of person that could eat whatever the hell I wanted ... and still be able to maintain a really lean figure . PROZAC TOTALLY FUCKED UP MY METABOLISM . I became lazy_ sloppy_ no desire to improve self image_ stopped working out_ stopped phoning chicks_ my house was messy ... I was sleeping all day . That kinda shit . FUCK PROZAC . Another word : These effects _ ... are NOT temporary . (Even though my psychiatrist said they were) ... well _ after 2 years stopping prozac _ my sex drive was still non existant _ please tell me how that is considered temporary .,Yes _ prozac sucked _ the sex drive part . If you are on prozac or were on prozac and had your sex drive totally torn apart ... I'd recommend that you take WELLBUTRIN TO REVERSE THESE EFFECTS . Stop prozac and get on WELLBUTRIN . It is also another antidepressant . I took prozac for 3 months . In 3 months_ prozac destroyed my sex drive (I was the horniest freakiest sex maniac you could ever imagine_ prozac made me a priest basically) . And for 2 years_ I did not take any prozac and waited and waited for my sex drive to return_ but it did not . Until I took wellbutrin . 1.5 months into wellbutrin_ I would say my sex drive feels like it is returning to normalcy . Thank you wellbutrin . Fuck you prozac .

Next I had difficulty sleeping_ and then complete insomnia.  Dead tired_ I would fall asleep only to experience a weird_ terrifying dream and wake up immediately. I thought I was losing my mind_ but then quit taking the drug and recovered.,As an adult I had enough sense to quit taking Prozac.

Prozac takes that away. my fight or flight response is amplified terribly off this stuff. my ocd is almost gone. my brain is no longer constantly ruminating causing me headaches and stress. i had 2 kids before i started taking this stuff. i was such a nervous person the hospital drug tested me when i had my first child. i wish i would have discovered this years ago as i have been like this all my life. i would not take it while pregnant though_ i do not plan on having any more children. i can deal with the forgetfulness and the spacey stacey feelings. that's a small price to pay to feel like you are really living_ not just surviving but living.,F,27,2  years,9/16/2004,Prozac

Only God can know the human body fully.,It helped me very much. I have tried to come off it several times but it seems that I am better off taking it than not. One might ask why I wanted to come off it. Well_ no one experiencing these things likes to be dependent on medication. It costs money and there are side effects and there is a feeling_  very basic I believe_ that I can whip this mysterious thing called depression. Well_ each time I tried to whip it_ it very slowly raises its ugly head and   begins to whip me again. So what I think I have discovered is not to try to come off it but  to find the dosage that I am comfortable with  and live with it for the rest of my life. I  lived in Russia for many years and that is where my SAD symptoms really peaked. Prozac helped me immensely in that regard. I have also found a lot of help basking in the sunshine. I am learning to deal with the side effects and not to over react to them but just accept them as part of my healing. Thank you_ Lord.,M,52,5  years,8/29/2004,Prozac

So I was firs switched to prozac to get rid of sexual side effects and was started at 20 mg every day.  AFter being on it for 3 weeks I began getting headaches every single day that by the next week lasted all day every day and were horribly painful.  I coudln't handle it anymore and was switched to serzone which didn't work very well for the amount I was taking.  Then I went back and asked to take 10 mg prozac half the month instead of 20 all month long.  I no longer have headaches with this method.,Only problem is sometimes it doesn't eradicate all my pms and then I am considering to take 20 mg for two weeks of my cycle instead of only 10 mg for two weeks of my cycle.

The main problem I have had is in trying to get off of the drug. I have tried this twice over the years because I was feeling well and thought I might be able to discontinue the medication altogether.

I wonder how much this was due to the feeling of relief at having started some kind of attack on the depression. After 6 months I failed to see any ongoing improvement and decided to stop treatment.  This was partly because by then I was motivated to change the root of the anxiety and felt the drug was making me too complacent to do so.

852, 5, anxiety/depression,At first_ very tired and some sleep disruption. Now none to speak of.,Best thing that I've ever done.  I've suffered from Depression and anxiety all my life and I now feel like a completely different person.,F,42,1.5  years,7/3/2002,Prozac
853, 4, Depression (maybe bipolar),Terrible drowsiness and apathy at 20mg/day; these affects were reduced by reducing dosage to 20mg every other day or third day after emerging from acute depression. Also caused some back pain and cramps_ but since my depression causes lots of physical aches_ this wasn't too objectionable.,Slow to take effect_ but it worked well. The drowsiness was a double edged sword because I usually have terrible insomnia_ and on Prozac I could go to sleep almost at will any time_ even earlier than normal. I also have ADHD and a degree of obsessiveness and anxiety. Prozac made me feel very friendly and relaxed in social situations_ whereas I normally am self conscious and prone to talk too fast and too much_ a function of ADHD. Prozac helped with some other ADHD symptoms_ making my thinking altogether more orderly and deliberate. I eventually switched to Wellbutrin_ which I'd used before_ because the drowsiness did not diminished with time and the latter is more of a stimulant.,M,44,3  months,6/28/2002,Prozac
854, 5, Depression,None,10 mg a day is just enough to flavor my life with joy.  I can hardly believe I was obtuse enough for the 25 years previous to wake up daily feeling like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill and living a life of shades of gray_ rather than brightness and joy.,F,51,2  years,6/9/2002,Prozac
855, 3, Borderline Personality Disorder,Lowered lobido/anorgasmia somewhat_ lethargic_ no appetite_ short & long term memory LOSS_ word-finding-difficulties_ hands/feet sweat more than usual_ APATHY. Difficulty concentrating on any task or on conversation.,I'm a difficult case to treat in the first place_ having problems with eating disorder_ impulsive spending sprees_ aggression/anger control problem_ high anxiety_ low-self esteem_ self-harm (hitting my head with my fists)_ severe depression_ and emotionally am worse a few days before period starts.After trying Zoloft and Celexa_ my doctor put me on Prozac.  Of the three meds_ it makes me feel as normal as I could hope to be_ but I still suffer from mild depression much due to apathy and my self-confidence is very low. Having a bad memory makes me feel stupid or like a zombie.  Zoloft worked great the first week (only took 25mg)_ but I became nervous and agitated as dose was increased to 50mg. and didn't help with anger control.Celexa made me apathetic and severe memory loss (20mg)_ but had no problem having orgasm while on it.  I still felt depressed_ but not severe depression.Prozac made me feel terrific for the first 3 or 4 weeks (20mg daily)_ but then the wonderful feeling subsided.  I notice this happened with the other two SSRI's I've tried as well. I take brand name Prozac 20mg every other morning_ due to its build-up characteristics in the body (long half-life).  I may need to start taking it daily again_ or increasing dose.   It gets to be a letdown when these drugs don't work as one hopes_ as in lasting effects.  You begin to get frustrated with the trial and error process. I am currently taking 1mg of estradiol 25 days ea. mo._ plus 100mg of progesterone two weeks ea. month for hot flashes. I am curious if the estradiol is causing me lethargy.  I seem to get sleepy an hour or two after taking it_ so I might change to taking it at bedtime_ or slow taper off of estrogen.  Progesterone for certain makes me sleepy.  I take it at bedtime.  My doctor prescribed BuSpar_ 10mg twice a day to see if this drug combo will work better for me_ since they both work differently on neurotransmitters.,M,39,4  months,6/6/2002Email,Prozac

Then_ 6 weeks into therapy_ had a severe allergic reaction - took 2 weeks for the itching to stop. STill have not found any med that worked as well as the Prozac. But manufacturer says I can't take it anymore due to the reaction_.,,F,46,6  weeks,5/15/2002,Prozac
859, 1, depression,"Agitation_ anxiety_ clenched teeth and jaw.  It was bad.  The medical and pharmaceutical communities now publicly acknowledge that about 7-9% of Caucasians are what they call ""slow metabolizers"" of this_ and other antidepressants.  What this means is_ we cannot break the drug down and clear it from our systems as fast as ""normal"" people do.  And the drug was created for ""normal"" people.  So if your body processes it slowly_ you will end up with way high concentrations of it in your blood_ for very long times_ and you will be slammed by the side effects at an unbelievable intensity.  Unbelievable to experience_ and also my physician refused to believe me.  Of course I changed doctors.  Life is too short to put up with this type condescension in addition to the struggle with depression.  Some people will never be able to tolerate this medication.  I'm one of them_ unfortunately.",,F,39,5  days,4/29/2002,Prozac
