59, 1, Hypertension,I see all the side effects people have commented about and I have many of the same issues. I'm not absolutely positive that it is caused by diovan but after seeing this I'm 85% sure that it's a real possibility. I feel there isn't much use to talk with my doctor right away until I can prove it because I'm certain I will hear its not the medication and why after all this time has it taken so long to have these symptoms. There (not recommended) I'm going to stop the diovan for now and see if the side effects dissipate. I will control my blood pressure naturally for now doing my best. Anything is better than what is happening to me now for the last few years. The issues I've been experiencing are extreme neuropathy with foot pain to the point I can't wear socks and shoes without having severe pain wich lingers on throughout the whole night after a short period of wearing then and some walking_ eye/vision issues. The most important of any and there are a couple more is the neuropathy. The pain never goes away in my feet_ toes especially_ its there 24/7 and have alotbof trouble walking (i use a cane) and when I do walk it's not far at all. They had much difficulty giving me a diagnosis of pheriphial neuropathy because there was no good reason for me to have it.Therefore another reason for me to believe the diovan is the cause. Excuse how long this is but there is so much more I could say about this. This is the worst most devestating thing I've ever physically experienced and I',,F,51,5  years80 MG,8/8/2014Email,Diovan

The symptoms were so mild I didn't pick up on them; anxiety_ stomach gases_ bloating_ gaining weight when on weight loss program_ fatigue. My dr switched me from the Exforge to Divan 6 months ago. At the end of February everything went downhill from there_ I was having problems breathing_ horrible stomach pain with really bad gas and bloating_ dizziness_ head in a fog_ so nervous and started having panic attacks_ tingling in my arms_ fingers_ feet_ tongue and head with numbing too! These panic nervousness started lasting all day. I couldn't sleep. I went to my dr and he didn't believe it's the Divan even after I showed him all the adverse symptoms. He did take me off of it but only because my sodium was low which is another symptom. He was trying to convince me that the panic attacks was me. I have never been a nervous person. This has been a horrible and frightening experience. So scared. I refuse to get on any HBP med. I and going to do it the healthy way_ lose weight eat right make sure my electrolytes are in balance. My BP has been 136/85. Ever since I stopped taking the medication the symptoms are diminishing thank god. Each day I get a little better. This is a horrible drug the side effects are debilitating.

Within two (2) days my energy was back and most of the achiness was gone. So were the leg cramps and muscle spasms.This is a BAD drug! It cannot possibly be helping if it's screwing up your body and your life! Fortunately_ lifestyle changes can usually control blood pressure_ and I have taken steps to do that. (Take a look at Mark's Daily Apple website for a lot of good hints as to diet and exercise.) As for the White Coat Syndrome_ I will monitor it myself at home and avoid the doctor's office to the maximum extent possible.

Had kidney cyst removed in Sept_ 2010 and none of the symptoms disappeared.  Have since had swallowing tests_ PH studies_ gastroscopies_ ultrasounds_ etc to try to determine the cause of all this pain since then and all results come back normal.  Have  been on numerous pain medicines to try to control this pain that no Dr. can diagnose.  Pain persists.  Just a couple of days ago I thought perhaps my blood pressure medicine was causing this pain_ so I have not taken my meds since Tuesday night and am still not feeling great_ but it's only day 3_ so will give it some time.  BP was 142/94 this morning_ so not ideal.  Will give this a few weeks to see if these symptoms go away_ and if they do will visit Dr. to discuss other options.

(my doctor also gave me pills for that which I did not take) Long story short_ after many ekg's_ chest x-rays_ a stress test and many emergency room visits. On my own I figured out what was happening to me. Because the pills gave me anxiety and it took 3 weeks for the pills to come out my system_ my body went into what's know as adrenal fatigue. I had to eliminate all sugars_ (even natural sugars) caffeine_ all preservative and all processed foods from my day diet.  I was taking in a total of less than 2 grams of sugar a day. After 4 months of cleansing my body of these foods_ finally the anxiety went away. It was like a ton of bricks was lifted off my shoulders just to feel somewhat normal again.

(could always get an erection but took more effort)_ rash_ fatigue_ did very little to lower bp_ anxiety_ and all the others I forgot to mention! No cough like ace inhibitors tho. I am tired of these poisons and have stopped tiazac_ lipitor (muscle weakness big time)_ vit D. Just read about hypervitimonosis D. Not good a sarcoidosis thing. Also a reduced ability to sense low or high blood sugar levels. I am a type I since 23. Also something swoolen in my throat. Seems to be dying down since ceasing diovan 3 days ago. I hope it is really happening and not just seeming to happen.,I am trying to get off all of these pharmaceutical  meds with things like valarian root (sleep sooo well now) and hawthorn. These doctor just ignore all problems when it says if this occurs consult your doctor. I would tell him and he knew where the problems were coming from but did not care!!

163, 1, hbp,Blurry vision started on day one.  Tired all of the time_ legs ache_ feel bloated all of the time.  Three days ago I started having severe chest pains_ sweating_ and feeling faint.  Went to the ER and they ended up admitting me overnight to monitor me.  Had EKG's done_ nuclear stress test_ bloodwork_ etc. and all was fine.  I had a feeling that it was all due to the side effects of the Diovan.  I hate this stuff.  Saw my doctor today and he wants to switch me to Cardevilol twice a day.  I do not want to take it if it will have side effects anywhere near to what I have been experiencing this past week.  Will try to lower BP naturally at this point.  Only found out two weeks ago that BP was elevated and I was stressed and sick with the flu at the time.  I think the dr pushed me into drugs way too fast.,,F,39,8  days80 1X D,4/7/2011Email,Diovan
164, 1, High BP,I switched from Avapro to Diovan shortly after having an EGD to diagnose chest pains. I switched because my insurance would not pay for avapro so my doc gave me samples of diovan until the insurance gave me an approved list of medicines. While on avapro  I did have an upset stomach but Avapro was candy compared to Diovan. Diovan did a beautiful job with my BP(110/74 down from 165/95) but I had all of the side effects that most have listed. Muscle spasms_ in back and stomach_ muscle twitches all over body_ eye twitches_ tingling all over body_ ear popping_ anxiety_ insomnia_ waking up from sleep early(2am-3am) and not able to go back to sleep_ fatigue_ headache_ pressure in head_ developed flu like symptoms with terrible cough and thick green/yellowish mucus_ back pain_ dizziness_ lethargic_ and just an over feeling of being ill. I did not feel like myself the entire time I was on Diovan. Over the past three weeks I have had a abdominal ct_ numerous blood tests_ 2 mri's on back_ numerou,My wife is almost 5 months pregnant. Our first child was still born after she went into premature labor at 5 months less than a year ago. Because of Diovan I have wasted a month of our pregnancy going back and forth to the doctor and adding additional stress to my extremely nervous pregnant wife. I have been off Diovan for 24 hours and 90% of my symptoms are gone. If you can take this drug without side effects I am happy for you. I encourage anyone that is on this drug and is experiencing side effects to visit their doc ASAP to change meds unless you like that near death feeling.,M,28,1  months320 1X D,3/15/2011Email,Diovan

I am 5 feet 3 inches and normally weigh 117 to 119 but now weigh 124 (not really noticeable b/c I'm fit but it's too much). My HBP is genetic (my dad is on BP med). Diovan did LOWER my BP to normal levels (from 140/150's over 90s to 120s/80s or lower!)_ but it is not worth the side effects. I may try something else.,F,50,3  months 1X D,3/5/2011Email,Diovan

I went to the gym 5 times a week and usually ran 2-5 miles every time I went to the gym. Initially the doctor put me on Linisopril while I had a cold and a cough. Yes_ it only made the cough worse. Then they put me on Diovan 4 years ago. Since then my weight had increased to 430 pounds. Ive gained approximately 180 pounds since taking diovan. Shortly after taking Diovan_ my back hurt so bad_ I could barely walk 20 yards.  I would go to the gym and lift weights for hours and my muscles would never get stimulated not would they even grow after going 4-5 times a weak. I felt like blood wasnt getting to the muscles. One of the major side effects of Diovan is Skeletal Muscle Loss according to Ehow.com. After work in a office_ my feet would hurt so bad the only thing I could do to eliminate the pain was to take Hydrocodone or Darvocet.I often travel because of my profession. A walk from an airport gate to baggage claim seemed like a journey across the Mojave Desert.  Initially_ the only reason I stopped taking Diovan was because I lost my job and health insurance. I started taking Linisopril again because it was very very inexpensive and I had some left from 4 years ago.Since I stopped taking Linisopril_ I notice that my stamina at the gym and my strength at the gym have increased just by stopping the Diovan.

170, 4, high B.P.,some blurriness once in a while_some hair loss.,I had been taking an ace inhibitor and was always coughing. My cardioligist prescribed 16o .mg of Diovan.  It kept my blood pressure down to 120/74 all that time.  Once in a while I was a little lightheaded.  Now my BP has spiked up to 150/84.  He wants me to double up on the Diovan and cut out the potassium pills I had been taking because of Lasix for water retention.  I am a little fearful of this but will try anyway.  The hair loss didn't bother me_ because most of it is gone anyway.  I have a scheduled blood test in two weeks to see if it has affected my kidneys and liver.

174, 1, hypertension,Took 80mg dosage for about a year before needing to increase to 160mg.  Upon increase almost immediately noticed substantial hair loss and change in consistency of hair_ i.e._ curly hair going straight and curls that remained changing direction -- never curled under in 45+ years.  Also experienced increased anxiety_ bizarre disturbing dreams_ legarthy_ joint pains and then the usual mild cough and skin irritations that are common with BP meds.  The total change in hair composition and loss of hair acted like a chemo drug. How horrifying.,Additionally it was never effective_ even tried highest dosage at 320mg for a month and it had no impact in lower BP from bumping dosage up from 160 to 320. Ineffective for all the side effects and high cost.  My physician had never heard of hair loss relative to Diovan.

I have been on this poisons for about a year and half before experiencing any side effects.  It started with tingling and a very warm sensation in my foot. .  I started having really bad anxiety.  Then came terrible neck pain like my neck could not support my head. My neck was popping/cracking all the time. The POWERFUL leg pains came next!  They were SO bad I couldnt sleep at night.  I have also felt pain in my arms with feelings as though someone was plucking my skin from the inside.  My hair started coming out strand by strand every time I would touch it.  I also couldnt focus my vision at times and would see double First I thought it was just because of the HCT in the Diovan (was taking 80/12.5).  Then my doctor switched me to Diovan 160 (no HCT).  That made my leg pains WORST!  I have officially taken myself off of the medic,I'm knowing by faith that the LORD is healing me of ALL these terrible side effects.

Another told me to stop taking the medicine immediately.  I did  and things got a little better but not by much.  Finally found a really good doctor who immediately figured out that I needed potassium ASAP_ the day I took the first pill_ what a huge difference it made.  I felt so much better_ and after reading about potassium deficiency_ all the symptoms of it are almost identical to what I was going through. My tiredness is gone_ the dizziness_ the anxiety_ blurred vision_ I feel much better now.  Apparently the drug_ because it is a diuretic_ washed out the potassium out of my body.

Since he became raw vegan (eats only raw veggies_ fruits_ nuts and seeds) his blood pressure dramatically & dropped naturally (it's is now 117/76 - 120/80). We do not eat any animal products_ including diary and eggs_ do not smoke or drink. My husband lost more that 45 pounds and feels way better than before. If he knew that RAW VEGAN life style will help him so much to become  feel healthier and younger looking_ he would never have needed drugs to start with. Now he knows that getting rid off toxins in your body by eating raw food can lower blood pressure as body becomes healthy.  I wish we knew it 5 years ago!

I stopped taking the 1st bp med and my dry cough stopped.  I started taking the Diovan and within a week the dry cough started again.

I really have concentrated on exercise and trying to watch what I eat as well.  I actually hope that I can come off of the meds completely.

259, 3, high blood pressure,hair loss_ insomnia_ dry cough_ fatigue and joint pain occasional shortness of breath and mood swings.,I was on Diovan on and off for 10 years. Though it controlled my blood pressure. I cannot deal with the side effects.  I was experiencing hair loss for several years and realized it started when I started taking Diovan. Everyone I spoke to stated that hair loss was not a side effect of Diovan. Needless to say I discontinued the Diovan at least a month ago and my hair is growing back_ I haven't had that annoying cough_ no shortness of breath_ my joints are not hurting anymore and I have no trouble falling asleep and a decrease in the mood swings. All of these side effects were making me miserable. I would gladly take Diovan again if it weren't for the side effects.,F,38,10  years,7/23/2009Email,Diovan
260, 3, Hypertension,Severe sleeping problems. Never had such a hard time falling asleep in my life! Even if I were to finally fall asleep from exhaustion_ due to not getting enough sleep_ I will wake up in a few hours_ usually sweaty.  Most of the time_ I could not fall back asleep.  I'm not sure but I feel like I have similar dry cough symptoms as I did with Lisinopril but still not very pronounced and too early to tell.,I was initially prescribed Lisinopril and took it for a few months but had to stop due to the persistent dry coughs.  I coughed all throughout the day and it also woke me up almost every night due to it.  I have only been on blood pressure meds for 4-5 months now.  Diovan for about 6 weeks.  It does seem to work on controlling my BP though.,M,38,6  weeks,7/18/2009,Diovan

262, 2, Hypertension,INSOMNIA!!!!! Up until 5am_ and then only able to sleep for a few hours. Felt crummy. Also didn't impact my b.p. much--would have had to increase the dose_ and I was already having way too many side effects at the lowest dose.,Might work for some people_ but not for me!!!!!! Micardis_ in the same class_ really works for me. Diovan_ unfortunately_ did not. I never felt well on Diovan. When I changed the timing of the dose_ then I had to deal with exhaustion. So_ not a good drug for me at all. Cheaper than Micardis_ yes_ but just didn't work for me.,F,52,7  days,7/16/2009,Diovan

275, 1, HBP,My heels hurt so badly that I could barely stand to walk_ and my ankles felt like they could go out on me at any time. I had  headaches upon waking_ heart flutterings and night sweats_ weight gain_ and puffiness. I also couldn't breathe right.  Thought I had a major sinus problem.  Didn't feel healthy at all.,Previously_ I took Coreg_ and my legs grew to be so weak that I could barely walk around my building at work.  (not that big of a building)  I switched to Micardis because of that_ which was okay_ but then switched to Diovan because of cost. I now know that the Diovan has been causing my current symptoms_ thanks to this website.  All of these meds are toxic chemicals_ so if you're looking bigger_ it's because your body stores toxins in your fat cells because that's the safest place for it to put them! I'm currently working on a full body detox_ as well as a liver detox_(through Dr. Marilyn Tucker out of Nashville_ Tenn.) and today_ right now_ I feel like a new person.  Go to http://drmarilyn.tv/index.html and read about it. Something's changed because I haven't taken Diovan in three days and my blood pressure hasn't spiked up.  Also_ MY HEELS AND ANKLES NO LONGER ACHE!!!  Dr. Tucker has helped me so much. She's a Doctor of Pharmacology who came to understand that all chemical meds are poison.  She's totally holistic now.  It costs some money for the products_ but she actually calls and talks to you personally_ AND assigns you counselors.  If I can help even one person with this information_ I'll be very happy.

Keeps my BP in check.,Have taken several BP meds (azor_ benicar_ amlodipine_ bystolic makes your eyes close_ soooo sleepy) and all have some issues. I've only been on BP meds for a year and hate it.

277, 1, High Blood Pressure,Extreme lower back pain and abdominal cramps.  Blood pressure 200/104 when above 7_000 ft. Dosage increased from 40mg. once a day which I could tolerate_ to 160mg.  Never lowered BP. -- even adding Norvasc or Topril at night.,When I returned to FL quit taking diovan.  Within 48 hrs. my extreme lower back pain subsided and after 4 days all symptoms completely gone. After something I read on the internet_ I am wondering if Diovan affects the kidneys and if it can cause renal failure.  There was no warning about this side effect.  I am off all medication and will take my chances despite stroke level HPB.  Have tried Dyazide_ Norvasc_ Topril_ Monopril_ and Diavan.  None did much to lower HBP but all had unacceptable side effects.  Does anyone know of a BP medication that works at high altitude?,F,66,2  months,4/3/2009,Diovan

I had to go to an eye doctor to correct the vision in my right eye. The ringing in my right ear_ scalp problems_ and pressure headaches on top of my head still linger. This medication was poison to me. Lucky are those who can tolerate it.,F,64,2  months,4/3/2009,Diovan

280, 4, High BP,No side effects_ really.  I have had occasional dizzy spells_ but they have lessened over the years.  I've been on Diovan 160mg in am and 80mg pm for years.  This is the only BP medication that DIDN'T give me side effects.  It was a breath of fresh air and a relief to finally find something like it.,The only caveat is that the Diovan doesn't lower my BP enough.  I just took my measurement and I'm 130/87 (before am dose).  In the doctor's office I'm usually 138/90 or slightly higher (midway between doses).  The NP wants to try me on ExForge (which combines Diovan with Amlodipine)_ but after reading the side effects on amlodipine and reviews here for Diovan_ I think I'll stay on the Diovan and increase my exercise instead.,F,47,4  years,3/28/2009,Diovan
281, 2, High BP,BACK PAIN_ dry mouth_ loose stool_ fuzzy vision at times_ mild insomnia_ sweating when I wake up in middle of night_ clammy hands and feet_ memory haze_ cough_ tingling in face_ fatigue.,I have been prescribed  Exforge which is a combo of two drugs_ Diovan being one of them_ for renal hypertension.  I am a 40 yrs. old and am in good health...I have never had a high BP problem until 2 weeks ago and have always been healthy with the exception of a mitral valve prolapse diagnosis many years ago which has only ever caused me palpitations.  I was just diagnosed with a blockage in the artery to my right kidney which is causing my high BP.  (I eat good_ exercise moderately and am a healthy weight for my height) I will be going to see a vascular surgeon to have an angiogram done to my renal (kidney) artery.  My cardiologist put me on Exforge to bring down my BP.  It went up to 200/110 and I am normally 120/80 or below.  That's what made them suspect my kidneys.  However_ I just got off the phone with my cardiologist's office and told the nurse all of the side effects I am having. She told me to stop taking it and I am waiting to hear back to see what he wants to put me on instead.  I do take Toprol XL 50mg per day for palpitations and have been for years.  I have never had one side effect to that.  After I go for my angiogram and possible angioplasty to my renal (kidney) artery_ I am hoping to be able to go off of high blood pressure med (except Toprol for my palpitations) all together.  This Exforge is like taking poision.  I feel horrible from it. It has brought my blood pressure down to about 130/90ish give or take a little but the side effects are terrible.,F,40,2  weeks,3/16/2009Email,Diovan

The only side effect I've had since starting it is waking up during the night and having trouble going back to sleep.  It started when I started taking Diovan and has not stopped. Otherwise_ this medication takes care of my high blood pressure with no other side effects for me.  Once_ my doctor doubled the dosage because it wasn't lowering my bp enough_ but then I had trouble breathing because it made my asthma worse.  So I stuck with the 120 mg. dosage and started an exercise program.  That did the trick and my bp is now normal with the exercise and the Diovan. I am very happy because I had horrible side effects on other bp meds over the years.,F,39,2  years,12/30/2008Email,Diovan

314, 5, high blood pressure,Taking 160 mg daily at night.  Only side effect has been sporadic numbness/tingling in arms and hands at night_ sufficient to wake me up with pain.  No weight gain/hair loss_ both of which I am prone to and have experienced with other BP medications.  In fact_ I've lost 20 lbs at Weight Watchers while on this medication.,My starting blood pressure varied wildly -- often 150+/100.  Now it still varies a lot_ but in general stays about 133/75_ lower in the summer.  I can live with the annoying side effect of having my arms and hands fall asleep at night.  This is the 5th or 6th BP medication I've been on and the side effects of all others have been much worse/intolerable.  Atacand was the worst -- felt like I was going to commit suicide.  Toprol caused immediate weight gain & fatigue.  Diuretics made me extremely fatigued and gave me migraines.  Cozaar didn't do a thing to lower BP.  Diovan is a blessing for me.  I do realize that prescription medications effect each of us differently_ so I am lucky I found something that can address my high blood pressure successfully and still allows me to function.

Also_ irritable (unlike my normal self)_ exhausted and weak all the time_ so I just bought a HPAP machine to help me breath at night (was told it was sleep apnea).  I just asked my doctor for an allergy test but know those symptoms began with the beginning of Diovan in 1996.  Does anyone know how to control HRT without medical help?  I practice organic methods and herbs but it's soooo dangerous a practice with HRT unless you know what you're doing.  Was hospitalized with 240/160 two years ago when I couldn't afford the Diovan and was without it for a week.,I want to go off Diovan.  I want a life.

(6-8 pounds in 3 months.)FEET/ANKLE PAIN. I have been to the podiatrist..there is nothing wrong with my feet_ so why do they hurt?OCCASIONAL TINGLING OF ARMS/HANDS_ a crawling sensation.LIGHT-HEADEDNESS_ spinning sensations,After an episode with acid-reflux sent me to the ER in the middle of the night with chest pain_ a cardiologist whom I had never even met_ ordered a stress test for me.  I am in good shape: golf and work out regularly.  My heart rate went up very slowly_ but when I got the heart rate up_ the BP was up higher than he liked..180/90.  He immediately put me on Diovan 80 mg..no questions or history..nothing.  I have not felt the same since.  The BP has come down some_ but not enough for me to put myself through this every day!  I am taking myself off this stuff_ and going to see my own doctor.  There must be some kick-backs for doctors_ I don't know_ but I don't need to feel like this from now on!

360, 1, High Blood Pressure,Blood pressure was running 150/100 or higher. Doctor prescribed lowest dosage of Diovan 40mg once daily. Immediately gained 12 pounds around waist area without changing exercise or diet_ and stomach felt bloated all the time. 4 years later was on Exforge (Diovan 320mg and Norvasc 10mg) Blood pressure was good on this medication. Stayed in the 130/70 range_ but besides weight gain I felt like I had a cold or flu all the time. Chest congestion would get so bad I would have to go to the doctor every 3 months for steroids and antibiotics to clear up severe chest congestion. That would would clear up_ but constant stuffy head and nose would cause it to get congested all over again. Just a vicious cycle that I got tired of.,Told my doctor I wanted to try something_ anything else. Insurance company recommended I try Azor 40mg/10mg. Have been on Azor for about 3 months now_ and absolutely no chest congestion_ no stuffy nose or stuffy head feeling_ and I immediately lost 12 pounds without adding exercise or changing eating habits. Blood pressure since starting Azor is averaging 125/65_ which is as low as my blood pressure has ever been. Doctor was hesitant to change medication at first saying it couldn't be the Diovan or Exforge causing my problems.

363, 1, High Blood Pressure,I have been taking Diovan for about three years and my sides affects have recently changed_ not sure why but at first I had horrible diarrhea (on and off for 12 months) and the doctor keep saying it was not a result of the medication.  Also_ I have had an increase of sinus and upper respiratory infections.  Most of those symptoms have gone away; however over the last 4 weeks_ I have noticed a lot of hair loss_ to the point I had to have my hair cut short to hide the new thining long hair.  The strangest thing has been a side affect called Paresthesia_ I feel like my skin is always crawling and tingling; especially the scalp of my head.

366, 1, High Blood pressure,My doctors will not admit that my symptoms are side effects. I think it is because the PDR is no longer in a book_ but on the net at a cost of one thousand dollars a year. Many cannot afford this so they only know what the salesman tells them. I got diabetis_ gloucoma_ diarehia_ eye flashes_ left eye swollen_ knee and ankle pain_ horrible tenitis_ night sweats_ etc. I stopped the Diovan and will try a natural New Chapter drug that attacks HBP from three paths.

Have been experiencing depression_ blurry vision and occassional vertigo/dizzyness. No hair loss_ but skin has been very dry_ itchy with strange dermititis from time to time. I have developed insomnia which may be part of the side effects though not 100% sure. I have a dry cough that developed that also may be Diovan related. Some leg cramps and pain from time to time as well. I normally am fairly active but I must admit it seems more often than not I am feeling extremely fatigued. Definitely seem to have some memory loss as well... Why was I on this website again..? :),"I usually avoid reading the side effects panel on drugs because there is a tendency to start thinking you are getting all the side effects.. so in this case I didnt look up the weight gain_ depression_ anxiety_ memory loss_ blurry vision_ etc until I was experiencing it.. and going ""hmmm.. I wonder if it could be.. this drug""Diovan did seem to lower my BP significantly at first_ but it seems like there was a 'rebound' effect. At first it dropped to 120/80 but after a few months the pressure seemed to creep back to high normal and sometimes higher.. I stopped taking Diovan for a few months and cut back on Toprol and managed to lose 30 lbs.

I started to limp when I walked and at first_ I thought I was getting arthritis or possibly_ something serious until I found this website and discovered that many people had the same symptoms.,I decided to tell my doctor I wanted to go off Diovan and within 2 days my arm aches went away and my rash started to clear up.

Before I started Diovan earlier last year_ I worked out the gym 2-3 nights a week and had no cracking/popping in any joints. It was only after I started Diovan! My kness are puffy and are more than often stiff. I am still able to work out. My doctor doesn't think it's the Diovan_ but I certainly do! I will be asking my Doctor to change my med tomorrow. Perhaps I can get her to prescribe Avapro this go-around. I have been on Diovan 320 and also Lotrel and none seem to work that well. The stronger doses have not been good for me. Side-effects as follows:1. Knee_ elbow_,"Anyone have any ideas as to why the cracking/popping of the joints has occurred_ please advise. I have taken MSM Glucosamine for years and thought I'd try ""Osteo Bi-Flex with Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM"" to see if it would help the cracking/popping. Nothing yet after three weeks!",M,59,9  months,2/24/2008Email,Diovan

I've been on this about six months now and have been experiencing an increase in my hand and arm pain_ which originates with my DDD_ stenosis_ herniations in my neck.  I also have a ""trigger finger"" on the right hand and my left thumb as well.  Very painful.  I found this website and now I think that the increased pain and trigger fingers may be related to the Diovan.  Since my blood pressure is not that high (generally 140/90 before the Diovan)and I'm very healthy otherwise_ I will be asking my doctor to d/c the Diovan.  If she feels I still need something_ I'll try another drug.  The Diovan has brought down my readings as low as 116/60 which is where I was a few years ago.",I will be asking to switch meds when I visit my doc next.

Then_ I experienced extreme (10 pounds) in two days. I had ongoing chest pains_ pain under my ribs_ leg pains_ joint pains_ crippled feet_ tingling hands and legs and a sensation of coldness on my legs.  The longer I took Diovan the worse the symptoms got.  My lips started blowing up and tingling each time I took the pill.  Then_ my throat would close and face would swell. Lastly_ trapped gas.,I started to think I was dying.  My calcium became elevated due to thiazide in Diovan.  The doctor informed me that I probably have bone cancer due to the elevated calcium and all the bone pain.  Thank god for my endocrinologist!  She asked me to check the side effects of med.  As it turns out_ Diovan is poison to me.  The last pill I took almost killed me.  My throat closed etc..  thank god I was told to take Benadryl immediately lots of it.

I thought there was something wrong with my brain and I never linked it to the drug. Diovan is the only drug that I take at 160 mg. I feel like I have to walk very gingerly and watch my steps. I feel groggy_ like I am floating and less mentally aware_ almost a sloth-like feeling. I miss not having energy_ and I hate this loss of control over my body. My blood pressure has gone down_ but I cannot stand these symptoms. I feel like I am losing days_ months_ years of my life not being able to participate more fully.

No pain pills ever_ but motrin shot my pressure up_ made my heart race_ unable to walk right since I started this drug. My knee surgery was a success_ but the joint pain that set in after a sprain was unbearable.

I am praying my hair will stop falling out.  Where is the FDA - oh_ yeah_ I remember_ in the pocket of the drug companies.,F,53,1  days,10/8/2007Email,Diovan
437, 1, borderline high BP,I tried several meds prior to this_ all with SE's_ but this was by far the worst.  I felt like I died and went to hell. had terrible headaches_ terrible tightening across upper back and chest_ cough_ numbness and tingling_ pain in wrists and ankles_ and i was on this poison only for 5 days.  stopped taking it and within 5-8 days almost all symptoms subsided.

438, 3, Pre-hypertension,I've been on 80 mg of Diovan for almost 4 years. For at least the last two I have been having terrible pains in my legs when I get up from sitting after a short time. I have been to the foot doctor and chiropractor thinking this was related to my feet or back. I've had all types of xrays. Nothing significant related to these pains came up. Last weekend I heard for the first time that bp meds can sometime cause muscle pain. So on Saturday I stopped taking my bp meds and I'm monitoring by bp this week. If these leg pains stop within the next week or two I will be back to my doctor to let him know. I don't like taking any meds so the Diovan is all that I take. I am 55 years old so I thought maybe it was just getting up there_ but the pain can be so bad I wouldn't buy into this as being a normal part of aging.,,F,55,4  years,10/2/2007,Diovan
439, 1, high blood pressure,My mom is getting out of the hospital on Saturday from EXTREME side effects of Diovan. She was on Diovan(only med she was taking) for 2 years_ and in June '07 the side effects began.  First she had a stiff neck. Her dr. ordered an MRI. Nothing showed. So he ordered physical therapy. Within a week_ her arms were hurting so bad she couldn't use them. My dad bought a lift recliner so she could get out of a chair.   The dr. sent her to an orthopedic surgeron who took more MRI's. Nothing. Now nausea and urination problems began.  The orthopedic sent her to a neurologist_ but before the neurology appointment_ dizziness began that was so severe she was 100% bedridden.  We drove her to the ER where she was admitted.  More dr.s (8 total_ including a psychiatrist)_ and NOT ONE DR. looked at her one med_ Diovan.  The Diovan wasn't bringing down her blood pressure so then they doubled the dose. Now she had confusion_ became incontinent_ and was totally unable to eat. IV's kept her alive. One night,But do you think one single dr. will admit guilt? Of course not!  They are giving every reason (except withdrawing from Diovan) for why she is perfectly well now.  Mom is back to normal_ calling every day and we are all so relieved. The side effect I believe she would have had next is heart failure. I believe 100% that Mom would have died and we would never have known why.  Moral of this? Take your health care into your own hands! Don't rely on doctors to save you.,F,80,2  years,9/27/2007Email,Diovan
440, 1, Hypertension,Tried 80 mg. per day and stayed in bed most of time for six days until I realized it was the Diovan.  It certainly dropped my blood pressure from borderline to 100/60 or less.  On 40 mg. now_ but I break them in half.  On 20 mg. per day_ I'm experiencing depression_ lethargy_ tiredness_ back pain_ shoulder pain_ hip pain and increased ringing in ears.  This is my last day on Diovan.,I've developed Ty.2 Diabetes and my doctor wants BP lower than normal_ less than 120/70.   Diovan certainly works to reduce BP_ but the side effects are way too much for me.  I am sensitive to the side effects of BP medications.,M,65,10  days,9/27/2007,Diovan

442, 1, mild high blood presure,Side effects were awful and until I found this forum I thought my recent surgery had been a waste.  My sinuses were swollen_ back pain_ ringing in the ears_ tingling in legs_ feet and face.  Blurred vision and scratchy eyes as well.  As another stated I felt as if I had been hit by a Mack truck.,I was put on this med by a doc awhile back.  Had no clue that it was the cause of the sinus/ear pressure I was suffering with among the many other side effects I was experiencing.  Recently had endoscopic sinus surgery that I am sure now that I really didn't need had I of just gone off of this horrible medicine.  I am angry because I was feeling so bad and so looked forward to having the sinus surgery and feeling better.  When the symptoms didn't resolve after surgery I was sure that my medical problems were much deeper only to find later that Diovan HCTZ was the culprit.  I was robbed of my recovery period of feeling better immediately after surgery.  The days of me just taking whatever the doc prescribes are gone.  Will check ask a patient first before taking any new scripts.  Will definately work ahead on a homeopathic measure to rectify my BP problems.,F,59,90  days,9/17/2007,Diovan

I noticed that my legs are very heavy and have cramping especially in the calf muscles.  I now have joint pain in my wrists and ankles as well.  Initially I thought I may have picked up some sort of bug_ but apparenty it's the medication as it's the only medication I am taking.  I will be seeing my doctor to get to the bottom of this as this has been going on for the past 2 months.,Initially_ Diovan did lower my blood pressure to a normal level_ 120/70_ after I was diagnosed and hospitalized for HBP which was 230/110.  I am athletic and have a very good diet.  At 46 years of age and 6 feet tall_ my weight has been a constant 190lbs.  I did inherit HBP from my Father's side who had developed this condition around 45 years of age.  My younger sister also developed this condition.

528, 3, hbp,Initial hair loss_ but this has reversed_ hairdresser said this often happens when changing med. or starting med.but returns to normal after a few months - she was right.Fatigue_ loss of libido_insomnia_ backpain_ pains in legs and feet_ dry skin_ itching all over about half an hour after going to bed_ blurred vision_headaches and strange head pains_noticable deterioration in hearing.,Before taking Diovan I had developed a dry cough from my previous med. which I'd been on for 6 months.Before starting any hbp med. I had been experiencing twice monthly migraine attacks which lasted about 36 hours - the only thing I could do about them was go to bed and wait until they passed and try to cope with the terrible pain until it was over. I am worried about the side effects of Diovan especially now that I've seen this site and realize that what I'm experiencing are the side effects - and I intend to discuss this with my doctor- but even so this long list of side effects is still nowhere near as bad as the migraine attacks I suffered before medication_ and which I have only experienced once since.Trouble is my bp hasn't lowered significantly so I may be facing an increase in dosage_ and then I may feel differently about the side-effects.I'm glad I found this site!,F,47,10  months,2/22/2007,Diovan

532, 1, High Blood Pressure,"Was put on Diovan 80mg 2 years ago due to moderate hypertension_  a great birthright passed down from my father's side of the family.  I am otherwise healthy in diet_ weight and exercise habits.  At first the 80mg tablets seemed to be controlling my moderate hypertension (down to 115/75 on home monitoring and at my office visits).  After about 9 months my numbers started creeping upwards to levels higher than I ever had in the many years of being diagnosed as ""borderline"" and off meds.  Finally doctor upped dosage to 160mg daily.  About three weeks after new dosing I ended up in the emergency room with severe heart palpitations and disorientation.  Was sent home with Ativan prescription and told I had anxiety attack.  About six weeks ago (1 year after emergency room visit) I started having constant ringing in ears and heart palpitations that are getting worse.  Worst symptoms happen after getting into bed where ear ringing is deafening and palpitations feel like imminent hear",As of tomorrow I am taking 3-4 days off of the Diovan (with close BP monitoring of course...  though I can't imagine it getting worse than when I am having the palpitation attacks).  After six weeks of constant ear ringing and irregular heart activity I have to try something to see if in fact it is the pills that are causing my misery.  I can't live like this anymore!  Calling doc on Monday.  I like him so I am giving him one last chance to take my side effect complaints seriously before trying someone new.  I just honestly think that doctors may be unaware of these effects coming with this medication.  Thanks to everyone who has posted their thoughts on this site.  I honestly thought I was losing my mind!!!  It's unbelievably liberating knowing that others have experienced the h*ll I have been living through.  How can so many clinicians be unaware of these possibilities with the use of this med?!?!,M,32,2  years,2/10/2007,Diovan

I was able to go back to sleep but same thing happened when I woke up this morning; the vertigo was accompanied by nausea (I still took my Diovan 80 with water_ as I do every morning_ but threw it up half hour later...).  Other side effects I have noticed: less urination_ sluggishness_ less mental acuity_ (I work in finance so this is definitely not a good thing)_ and I have stopped menstruating.,My bp is still higher than it should be_ although it has come down from where it was before I started taking medication.

After some months I started to develop problems with my sinuses for the first time ever but didn't connect it. Had an operation to sort them out_ but problems continued.  Dosage of Diovan was increased to 80mg and my sinuses became worse_ I was having to take antibiotics at regular intervals_ coughing incessantly and had to make frequent visits to an ENT specialist who said_ after a CT scan  that I may need another operation. After a few years I began to find walking difficult as my legs were so heavy and I had pain in my joints. I felt as if I was recovering from flu.  I also had problems with my bowels and digestive system. Was given tablets to suppress the acid in my stomach (which in themselves had awful side effects so I eventually stopped taking them).

542, 3, HBP,I have been takin diovan and Diovan HCT now for almost two yrs.  I want to say I agree witht the remarks that everyone has made from the scale of 3 to 1.  This drug is good at lowering your BP but it is awful on your body.  I have experienced a lot of the symptoms you all have described and they are not very comfortable.  I also say to the people who have been experiencing the ringing in the ears to take that very seriously.  If you have been to a ENT then go to another one for a second opinion_ Now i am telling you this from experience_ I went through the same thing three yrs ago and now_ I am deaf.  I went from ENT to ENT and there was no diagnosis ever given.  I dont think the Diovan caused it but_ it definitely havent helped with the after effects.  Please take the seriousness of the ringing in your ears personally and try to get as much help as possible_ as I said my deafness started with a simple ringing in the left ear and ended up taking control over my right ear in a short per,The medicine works to lower your BP_ but the side effects are murder on your body.,M,46,2  years,1/10/2007Email,Diovan

I am so glad I got to this site and read what other patients said about the drug.  I am only taking 80mg but I will not continue on the drug.  My BP is lower but the side effects are too much.

547, 2, blood pressure,I am not sure if all these side effects are caused by Diovan. The first thing I noticed is an acidic stomach and acid reflux at night. I have pain in my knuckles. I am tired most of the time. Most recently_ and most disturbingly_ I've noticed blurry vision. I am going to see an opthamologist about that.,I didn't associate the symptoms with this drug before reading this website. My first 30 days on Diovan was OK. My Dr. reevaluated me and asked about acid relux_ which I hadn't expereinced by then. I guess it's a common side effect; I don't think that it is listed on Diovan's website though. I know that the blurry vision isn't listed as a side effect. I only made that association after 'googling' Diovan & vision_ just in case. I am going to stop taking the Diovan (80 mg daily) and see the Doc about alternatives_ and see an opthamologist about the blurred vision. I am pretty sure there's a connection and it's not just coincidence_ though.,M,55,75  days,12/24/2006,Diovan

551, 1, High Blood Pressure,I have been on Diovan for 4 years.  It has been good at lowering my blood pressure. Until about 9 months ago I was taking 80 Mg since 2002_ then it was changed to Diovan W/Hctz 160/12.5.  Over the last 6 months I have suffered severe joint pain in my legs_ hips and back.  I noticed my hair starting to fall out.  Not knowing what the cause was_ I had gone to several doctors trying to find what was happening.  I also suffered from reoccurring acid reflux.  Finally my obgyn asked me about Diovan and how long I have been taking it.  I told her several years.  I now am beginning to realize that my severe hair and joint pain loss started about the same time my Diovan was increased to double strength. I have lost over half of the hair on my head.  I have always had extremely thick hair and this has become a major problem for me.  I will get off Diovan ASAP.,Diovan has caused me several side effects that took me a long time and several visit to doctors to find out the causes of my problems.  It is the Diovan.

I didn't feel like getting anything accomplished at work or home. I was still having ear pains and my doctor said that was not a known side effect.,"Diovan quickly lowered my blood pressure to healthy numbers. My doctor was very happy how I responded. In spite of the lower numbers I stopped taking Diovan due to the side effects and my energy was gone. I recently began taking ""Hawthorne Berry"" (Standardized Capsules) and this stuff is a miracle!

561, 4, High blood pressure,I  have experienced extreme feelings of heaviness and fatigue in my leg and hip muscles. I never had problems with walking previously_ and routinely walked at least a mile each day.  After starting Diovan I got to the point where I would have to sit_ or at least stop and rest_ every half block while walking. I found myself using a scooter in the grocery store and that is when it hit me that I was getting seriously impaired.  The first drug I was prescribed was Lisinopril and I had the same symptoms so this is not only a reaction to Diovan (I was switched from Lisonopril to Diovan after two weeks when I reported side effects_ see below.)  After five months on Diovan I stopped the medication (not advised_ I know_ but I was desperate) and at the end of three weeks I was back to walking one or more miles with absolutely no symptoms.  My blood pressure went up and I reinstated the Diovan.  The symptoms returned within 48 hours.,"In reviewing my symptoms of the past few months I realize I have gained about 30 pounds (I was obese to start with) which I chalked up to having limited mobility. Now I am reading that Diovan patients report weight gain so I am wondering if the weight gain may be another side effect. My only positive comment is that Diovan lowered my blood pressure. I am going to speak to my physician about my concerns. She had told me ""no one"" had ever reported difficulty with fatigue of leg muscles and the resulting difficulty with ambulation when I reported it regarding the Lisinopril so I felt like a nutcase. I can't go on not being able to walk_ though!",F,55,6  months,11/15/2006Email,Diovan

569, 2, High Blood Pressure,Well I have experienced the same lethargy as most have reported here along with the dizziness and dry mouth. After just over a week_ I woke up with a bad case of Vertigo and ended up in the hospital. I had not taken my morning dose (one 160mg tablet/day)of Diovan when the symptoms occurred. I was told by the doctor at the ER as well as my normal doctor that the Diovan was not the cause of this but from reading everything here it seems it was. I went off of the drug for two days between the ER and my normal physician visit and immediately felt better after being off the drug a couple of days. Only problem is my BP went right back up. It has done well to control that. The doctor told me to start back the next day and immediately the dizziness_ lethargy set back in. I will start cutting my pill in half and look at the results.

Well_ 7.5 months into taking diovan the weirdest symptoms began and haven't stopped and I have been suffering with them for about 7 months since the onset.

610, 3, High Blood Pressure,Was taking 160mg once per day with what I thought were few if any side affects. Doctor increased to another 160mg at the end of the day. I have since been feeling terrible. I have severe ringing in the ears_ feeling nauseated all the time_ vision is very blurry all the time.,I will be cutting back my 2nd dose of 160mg and see if this makes a difference. I had a heart attack on 3/9/06. Had 4 stents put in and was put on several medications: betablockers_ Vytorin_ a Triton Study drug_ Diovan_ Norvasc_ protonix_ anxiety pill_ nauseated pill and aspirin. Needless to say_ I had all kinds of side affects and little by little_ I started getting off of them. I got off all the medications_ except for the diovan and norvasc and the triton study drug which is like plavix. Most of the side affects had dissapeared except now when I was added the extra 160mg of diovan. These last two months since my heart attack has been hell and I blame a good deal of this on the medications. I have had great success in cardiac rehab and have been losing weight. I do not smoke or drink. If there are alternatives to these drugs_ I will find them and take my chances with them instead of something that pharmacies are pushing toward doctors to give patients....,M,54,1  years,5/12/2006,Diovan

620, 1, Hypertension,I started out by having an itchy skin rash all over my body but as specially in my face. This rash started within 1 day of using Diovan. After 3 days I could start adding an eye irritation to the list as well. At one time my lips started to swell. Within 5 days I started to suffer from fatigue and at the same time insomnia! So now Im tired_ itchy and I cant sleep! I also suffer from anxiety and have palpitations as specially in the morning. But also have episodes through out the day.  This is not working for me at all. The only positive side is that my blood pressure returned to normal in just 5 days.Im making a new appointment with my doctor and Im going to tell her Im not going to take this drug any longer. ,I think its a scary drug to give so many side effects within 10 days of use!,F,40,10  days,3/30/2006,Diovan

I was started out on 80 mg and didn't really notice any bad side effects_ but I was only on this medicine one week when they bumped me up to 160 mg._ because my doctor thought 80 mg. was ""little old lady medicine"".  After taking 160 mg. for approximately a week or so I started noticing that I was sleeping at least 9 hours a night and waking up tired.  I've always had loads of energy and was starting to get depressed about my terrible lack of energy.  I continued on with the drug hoping that I would adjust. After 6 weeks_ I still felt horrible.  Then I developed a bad case of acid reflux which I never had before.  I was prescribed omeprazole 20 mg. for it and that really took care of the acid reflux.  I decided to cut back to 80 mg. of diovan and monitor my bp carefully.  I immediately felt about 25 percent better with the energy levels_ but I'm still depressingly tired.

It's harder for older folks like me to keep having personal bests.  I'm thinking it's because the Diovan has decreased my blood pressure to average 126 /76.

I'm on antidepressant so I don't have my usual sex drive :( .

666, 1, Borderline Hypertension,After approximately three weeks on Diovan (80 mg once per day) I begin to experience ocular obscurations (wavy lines and distortions to vision) in my left eye.

(Note: I have not taken Viagra or any similar drug.) At the time this vision loss occurred I had also been taking Tricor 48 mg for one month to lower blood Triglycerides.  These are the only two prescription medications I have ever taken on a regular basis.  I take one aspirin per day (325 mg) per physicians recommendation.

Diovan only lowered my BP to the 150's. When I added 1250 mg. of garlic a day_ it brought it down 10 points.  A second garlic brought it down another 10_ and a third another 10_ till my BP was in the 130's.  I have now quit the Diovan and am amazed at how awake I feel. I am working with a naturopathic doctor to find a non-drug method of addressing the high BP.
