0, 1, Vaginal dryness_ painful intercours,UTI_ hemaroids_ difficult getting out!,Not worth the side effects,F,61,2  weeks2mg 1X D,7/2/2016,Estring
1, 4, vaginal dryness_ painful sex,Works great for intended purpose.  Life in that regard is back to normal.  But the weight gain is terrible and rapid.  i gained 10 pounds_ all belly fat_ in a very short time without change in diet or exercise.  It is terrible_ my whole shape has changed.  I tried osphena for 2 months but it didn't work nearly as well and I didn't lose the weight so now I'm back on estring.  Also I am experiencing constipation_ and I've never had that problem before. I think that it blocks something or other and I can't go.,,F,60,6  months 1X D,4/20/2016,Estring
2, 3, HRT,,My GYN told me to use a SUPER PLUS tampon applicator_ and do it like a tampon assuring I knew it was far enough in . It has only been 4 days_ but I 4 get its there/don't feel it. She said I should know if it's working in like 2-3 weeks. I also used a little coconut oil to lubricate and help with insertion. But so far so good. Maybe it will help if you try again. And Pfizer has an excellent patient assistance program_ I think it's called Rx pathways_ but you only pay 15$.,F,,4  days2mg,4/20/2016Email,Estring
3, 1, Urinary frequency and dryness,Just couldn't get the thing in_ then it wouldn't go in all the way -  it seems my vagina is shortened and atrophied - tried to shove it in further but very painful... left it as it was but it was so irritating and painful I hauled it out and threw it out. $90 in the garbage.,If you have been in menopause for a long time (6 yrs for me) and not frequently sexually active (use it or lose it apparently ladies!)_ then the Estring might not be a good fit for you. I will try Vagifem and then maybe try the Estring again if my vaginal atrophy abates. At any rate it was a very expensive experience. Wish that the medical / pharma personnel would mention this and suggest trying vagifem or an estrogen cream before moving to the ring...,F,49,1  days2mg 1X D,4/4/2016,Estring
4, 5, vaginal dryness,none,Have been using for over a year now and it works great! Does not move when exercising (and I am a high-intensity exerciser)_ urinating_ bowel movements_ sex_ anything. I cannot (nor can husband) feel it when we're having intercourse. No weight gain/loss. No pain.,F,, 2 1X D,3/31/2016,Estring
5, 1, Vaginal atrophy,Headache_ nausea_ UTI_ bloating_ gastric upset,Had high hopes this would help prevent frequent UTI.  Instead just the opposite.  Really made me ill. Would recommend caution before using_ and prompt removal with onset of symptoms.,F,71,20  days 1X D,3/19/2016,Estring
6, 1, Vaginal atrophy,Breast pain and tenderness. Possible breast density that went away when I stopped using it. Weight gain and abdominal cramps.,Don't do it! I have been unable to take off the 10 lbs I gained from this and it's been 9 months since I stopped using it & I only used it for 2 months. I was gaining 1 lb per while while on it. I started menopause in 2007 & never had a weight problem_ not until I used this thing. I just can't shake this weight even with diet and exercise. I would have stopped using it anyway because my breasts were constantly sore_ feeling like they were 100 lbs each & I had abdominal cramps. The ring must have skewed my mammogram. I was told my breasts were dense. I was sent for an ultrasound that showed a small spot in the left one. I was sent for a 6 month follow-up. I had the ultrasound done recently & it was clear. My breasts are no longer dense & don't hurt! I used Estrace for almost a year before the ring. Sure_ it can be messy_ but it didn't make me gain weight_ I may have lost some weight while using Estrace. My breasts weren't sore and the cramping was brief. I'd rather use the Estrace.,F,59,2  months,3/1/2016Email,Estring
7, 1, Dryness_ skin tears,Constant pain. Breat tenderness.,I was uncomfortable from the start. The ring never stopped hurting. I finally removed it. It was too large and too painful.,F,61,1  days2 mg 1X D,2/18/2016,Estring
8, 4, Vaginal Atrophy_  Painful Intercour,The estring definitely helped with vaginal atrophy and dryness_ and sex was no longer uncomfortable. However_ I gained 7 lbs. in 3 months_ with no other changes to my diet and exercise regime. I took it our for a few days_ while waiting to refill the prescription_ and lost 2 lbs. As soon as I out the new one in_ I re-gained the 2 lbs. within a few days.,Very disappointed_ as I had tried Estrace cream_ but found it too messy and inconvenient. The estring definitely relieved my symptoms_and I found it easy to insert and comfortable once in_  but I can't stand the weight gain. Still debating whether or not I will continue to use it.,F,61,3  months 1X D,2/7/2016,Estring
9, 5, Vaginal Atrophy,None,Better than using the topical pill (Vagifem) or Premarin cream.  I used to forget to insert the pill or cream.  Therefore_ I was not getting the full benefits of applying a topical estrogen.  Estring has appeared to restore my vaginal moisture.  No more dryness during intimacy.,F,52,  1X D,2/2/2016Email,Estring
10, 4, Vaginal dryness,Significant weight gain. Thinning hair.,It did what it was designed to do_  but the side affects are not worth it to me.  I removed it and started losing the weight.,F,59,1  years,1/2/2016,Estring
11, 4, Vaginal Atrophy,Vomiting (1st day)_ Abdominal pressure_ slippage during bowel movement,"DAY 5: MUCH better! The first day_ I inserted it at 5pm. By 11pm I was vomiting (3x between 11 and 1am) At 1am_ I called a 24hr pharmacy. The pharmacist told me it could take 48 hrs to adjust. No more vomiting and the abdominal pressure has subsided (day 5). Neither I nor my husband could feel it during sex. I did remove it prior to bowel movement as I could feel it slipping and didn't want it to land in the toilet. If you remove it_ be sure to follow the directions and rinse it with lukewarm (not hot!) water. Easier to reinsert with dry hands. I rinsed with my left hand and used my right hand (I'm right handed) to reinsert. For me_ there seems to be an adjustment period. Every day is a little better. The convenience is worth it and if it works better than Vagifem (my doctor says it will)_ it will definitely be worth it. I set up ""reminders"" on my Google calendar to replace after 90 days with refill reminders 1 wk prior.",F,54,5  days2 mg 1X O,12/7/2015,Estring
12, 3, Vaginal thinning_ dryness.,Mostly breast tenderness _ some gas_ some abdominal pain_ some weight gain_ little moodiness.,My boyfriend can't feel it i can't feel it either_ seems to lubricate_ still evaluating_ was using cream with no side effects,F,63,1  months3 MG,11/29/2015,Estring
13, 5, Vaginal atrophy_ dryness,None. I didn't expect any as this is a local_ not systemic medication.,Definitely has decreased my vaginal dryness.,F,57,1  years,11/11/2015,Estring
14, 5, vaginal dryness_ atrophy_ cystitis,Slight discharge,I feel so much better after using Estring. Definitely helped all of my symptoms. I feel back to normal. I take it out during sex and have no difficulty with insertion and removal and do not feel it while it is in if it is positioned correctly. I know that they say the results are not systemic but both my husband and I noticed that the skin on my bottom and on my breasts are softer. I had tried everything to keep my areola's from drying out in the winter but nothing seemed to work in the past. I may have gained a pound or two but I also have not been working out as much as usual due to my busy life. love this product!,F,49,2  months 1X D,11/10/2015,Estring
15, 5, burning & painful intercourse,Uncomfortable when first fitted_ felt like needed to poo - just take it out and refit.  Weight gain - 3kg - but could be due to menopause anyway!,I had no periods for 18 months before starting_ but am now having them every 6 weeks.  I take the EString out for a few days and have a lot of sex. this seems to trigger ovulation and then I put the ring back in. At this point the severe night time sweating stops for around 2 weeks-  which is amazing. I have 5 days of increasingly painful breasts to indicate the period. I take the EString out for a day or 2 and my period starts. Weird I know but it is really working for me. I have had 10 years of UTI's up to menopause and now I have had none for nearly 6 months.  The break from the night time sweating means I can cope the rest of the time. Not heard of this happening to anyone else_ but they may not have tried taking it in and out to mimic the 'normal' oestrogen drop at ovulation.  If you have really severe night sweats I would give it a try. The first time I did it was by accident as the abdomen felt uncomfortable and I thought I would take a break. Now I just track and manage it. Doctor wants me to stop using it but the vagina is plumper & perky instead of 'grumpy' and uncomfortable all the time. I can get aroused and it lubricates itself like it used to - there are no UTI;s no sudden crazy burning for no reason requiring me to sit on a bag of frozen peas - so no_ so I am not giving it up!,F,52,150  days 1X M,10/26/2015,Estring
16, 4, Constant UTI's and Vaginal Atrophy,Extreme weight gain!!!,Other than weight gain (which I detest....I have gained 9 lbs in one month_ and prior to this_ I was losing)_ I LOVE it. It has taken the edge off of the atrophy_ and I have had NO UTI's. Love the product_ but I am not sure what to do about the weight gain. I am hoping it will level out.,F,58,1  months 1X D,10/20/2015,Estring
17, 5, Dryness; hot flashes,No side effects.,Wonderful product - very grateful. Fixed dryness problem and helped somewhat with hot flashes_ though that's not in the label.,F,58,1  years,10/7/2015,Estring
18, 4, Vaginal dryness_ painful sex,Seems to be working well_ however took about 9 weeks.  Some light cramping but tolerable.  I've tried everything over the past 2 years and this is working.,I would recommend trying it.,F,48,1  months30 mg,8/28/2015,Estring
19, 1, Vagiinal dryness and urinary urgenc,abdominal discomfort_ bloating,felt creepy about something in the vagina for a 3 month period.  Am a RN and know I positioned correctly above pubic bone.  It dislodged after a bowel movement.  Perhaps nature needs to take its course  and we ought to accept the natural course of aging,F,64,5  days,7/12/2015,Estring
20, 2, thinning on the vagina walls,Put in estring    next day cramping _ headaches_   continued to put up with headaches snd cramping _ day six woke up _ to abdominal pain and blood in urine _ took estring out went to emerg.   Still cramping and dizzy spells less frequently as day went on ... will talk to my ob gyn on monday.,Wanted it to work because of allergic reaction to estrace cream,F,52,6  days2mg 1X D,7/11/2015,Estring
21, 2, vaginal dryness_ painful sex,Swollen legs. Painful_ stiff_ swollen knees. Very heavy feeling in legs like I had to lay down & prop them up.,Once removed couple weeks earlier than the 3 months expected_ have started to improve gradually. Heavy feeling starting to go away. Thought I had a blood clot but saw my family dr who did ultrasound and was negative thankfully. Never used hormones in my life but thought locally would be OK. Won't use ever again!,F,62,3  months2 mg,5/27/2015,Estring
22, 1, vaginal dryness,Horrible unrelenting headaches started on day 4 still have it on day 8 ......Just took it out myself...Not easy to do_ but didn't want to wait for doctor.Will never use this again back to estrace cream.,,F,54,8  days2 MG 1X M,5/22/2015,Estring
23, 2, Vaginal atrophy,I had cramps for the first week and that went away. Breast tenderness continued from the first week. Weight gain 7 lbs. in 7 weeks. I felt pre-menstrual yet I've been menopausal for 7 yrs. I could not satisfy my appetite_ craving mostly sweets which I usually don't crave. My hot flashes did not go away. Maybe I could have given it more time_ but my breasts were intolerably sore and I couldn't bear the thought of gaining more weight_ at a rate of 1 lb per week. I still had burning with sex. It is a low dose of estrogen. I have to watch estrogen having had endometrial hyperplasia with pre-cancer cells. It's worth trying if you can get the company's prescription card discount. It's a week since I removed it and I've lost 2 lbs_ my breasts are pain free.,I used Estrace (1 gr 2x week) for 6 months before Estrung but I had some spotting and Estrace is messy. I don't think I'll go back on either. I was still dry down there with both. Now I'm back to the drawing board.,F,58,7  weeks2mg,5/11/2015,Estring
24, 5, Vaginal dryness,Love it -- no problems at all; fixed symptoms after about 2 weeks (I felt like I was sitting on a tennis ball) -- my only problem is that it hurts when I remove it as I can barely reach it -- will try the crochet hook that another person recommended,,F,64,6  months 1X D,5/10/2015,Estring
25, 4, Dryness,Other than a little discharge I have not had any side effects,I love it!  I feel like I am 30 years old down there.  My partner loves it too because we no longer have to use a lubricant.  There is one drawback and it is not really a big deal; I have to take it out before sex because we both can feel it.,F,56,2  months 1X D,3/25/2015,Estring

29, 5, UTIs_ vaginal dryness,I've had absolute no problems on Estring.  Ore marine didn't seen to help at all.  Had constant UTIs going into menopause.  Vaginal dryness and minor bleeding.  As each month went by_ gradual improvement to the point my husband and I actually have a sex life in our late 50s!,,F,56,4  years2mg 1X O,11/5/2014,Estring
30, 5, Vaginal dryness,The ring hurt the first time I used it and I almost gave up. I was so desperate for some relief that I took it out and repositioned it. It worked! Can't feel the thing! If you find it uncomfortable_ try doing the same and see if that helps. Push it way up as far as you can. It has made simply living more comfortable and has made sex way more enjoyable. Imagine! No pain! My husband is happy also because he knows he's not hurting me.,,F,53,3  months,10/28/2014,Estring
31, 5, vaginal dryness_ astroph,Stopped taking Estrace cream because of constant yeast infections. The ring is much better_ any side effects are mild compared to the side effects from lack of estrogen. My hair is thicker_ my skin less dry and my sex life is good again. I don't have trouble taking it out or getting it in. My partner doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.,,F,50,9  months,10/1/2014,Estring
32, 1, Hormone replacement and cure drynes,Uncomfortable_ bloating and damage to nerves.,I have a history of endometriosis. When I inserted the ring it was very uncomfortable. After a week of trying_ I took it out. My health started going down hill after that. My doctor thinks that the hormones in the ring has aggravating nerves and this has been extremely painful. After numerous UT and bladder infections with exploratory laparoscopic surgery_ my doctor is finally pin pointing it down. I highly recommend not using this product. It is so not worth it! I am still in tremendous pain of 6-months now. Hopefully with Gods help and guidance_ I will recover.,F,53,1  weeks 1X D,9/24/2014Email,Estring

34, 3, Vaginal atrophy,short (40 mins.) but intense headache with intercourse_ won't stay in place.,"I had a total hysterectomy many years ago and have been on HRT for years.  I still have vaginal atrophy with dryness_ painful intercourse_ tearing & bleeding with penetration despite using LOTS of lubricant_ multiple trips to doctor thinking I had another infection to find out it was just dryness causing the pain_ itching_ burning.  Estring definitely took care of the dryness_ itching and burning but the darn thing won't stay in place!  I was constantly having to put it back up higher.  I checked it before leaving the gym locker room_ started walking slowly on the treadmill to warm up and the darn thing slips out 4 mins. into my walk!  Had it fall out in the toilet when  I was not even trying to have a bowel movement.  The idea of washing it off with warm soap and water and reinserting it after that makes my skin crawl!  I am a medical professional and the idea of putting that ring back in after it is contaminated that way gives me the willies!  I'm going to try Vagifem or Osphena.  I have tried to use Estrace but it is messy and I definitely do not like that the tube comes with only one applicator that you have to reuse each time.  I guess after using it enough_ you could save enough applicators to use a ""clean"" one each time but it will take a LONG time to save up that many applicators.  Why can't they package it in a single dose disposable applicator or a suppository like Monistat is packaged?",F,58,30  days2mg 1X D,7/8/2014Email,Estring
35, 3, Vaginal atrophy,Haven't bought this yet because I'm wondering about the taste - new relationship with male friend who is excellent with his tongue.  He is also very well endowed (originally thought that was the problem)  is he going to feel it ?  Do I take it out first ?,Haven't had sex for about 12 years so I'd like something to work besides stopping before insertion and using lube.,F,61,0  days2mg 1X D,7/1/2014Email,Estring
36, 5, Vaginal atrophy,Very minor side effects. Minor discomfort at insertion that completely dissipated after a day. Slight increase in hot flashes_ but bearable. Was originally using Estrace vaginal cream_ but did not like the 'gooey' feeling. Planned on trying Osphena but insurance would not cover-very expensive out if pocket. Asked GYN for ring - very satisfied. Had TAH 3 years ago and suffered with painful intercourse. Dry_ burning_ bleeding!!!  As for inserting the ring_ I used the applicator included with the vaginal cream. I inserted the ring_ and used the applicator to carefully push it up further. Ring cannot be pushed too far_ so no worries. Just follow directions for removal - very simple.,,F,46,1  months,6/13/2014,Estring
37, 3, Severe Vaginal Atrophy,"Bloating_ BAD CRAMPING_ discomfort_ always felt it and it wasn't a ""good"" felt it!","I LOVE LOVE LOVE the effects not the SIDE effects of this medication! For the FIRST time in 40_ (yes you read that right... I had a TAH at age 20 due to severe endo) I was able to have enjoyable intercourse. No tearing_ burning_ dry as the sahara_ feeling like ""just get it over so I can go cry in the bathroom""_ and put cold compresses on afterwards!I loved the full_ thick_ cushy feeling in my vagina.  BUT_ I had to remove it last night due to the severe cramping and overall pain and discomfort_ I felt it constantly_ like a dull ache and sitting was very uncomfortable. :(  I probably should have taken it out sooner_ but... I ALMOST would put up with the pain for the benefits and today am really conflicted except already the cramping is gone! I wonder if it was not seated high enough_ wonder if I just didn't wait long enough to adjust_ wonder_ wonder_ wonder. I will go to gyn and have her check the placement_ fit and talk about how long the discomfort lasts or whether I would EVER adjust. Please email me if you can share a common concern/experience_ as I am rally conflicted!",F,61,9  days 1X D,6/10/2014Email,Estring
38, 5, constant UTIs - this was the fix,so far some slight (but disturbing )dizziness that has since gone (still keeping an eye on any recurrence) but other than that_ it's been my salvation.  no pain_ no other side effects (that I can attribute to the ring) -- only a blessing and relief,suffered from constant UTIs for nearly 3 years - was being treated by a urologist with only antibiotics and drastic diet limitations -- no help -- finally asked her about estrogen to treat vaginal dryness.  She prescribed some cream_ and shortly afterward (within a month) I went to a gynocologist who agreed with me that it would help get rid of the UTIs and she suggested I switch to Estring -- which I did after a couple more months of testing out the cream.  It's been fabulous.   I will be seeing the gyno again soon to check on my hormone levels and to be sure that there are no severe effects that I may not be aware of -- she uses it herself_ which was another reason I thought I'd give it a try.  So convenient and I haven't taken an antibiotic for months_ and haven't had a UTI since I first started on the vaginal hormone use.,,,8  months2 1X D,6/7/2014,Estring

Still have some pain with intercourse_ still a little bleeding. The 2nd month of the 2nd ring I started having a lot of hot flashes_ which had largely disappeared during the 1st ring. They disappeared with the 3rd ring. I am hungry all the time and have gained an uncomfortable amount of weight.,F,56,7  months2 MG 1X D,3/1/2014Email,Estring
43, 5, vaginal dryness_ painful sex,This totally cure my vaginal dryness. I was almost to the point where I couldn't have sex. Now I can have sex and there is no more painful stinging afterward. I have not noticed any negative side effects. I have not had problems putting it in or taking it out. I can't feel it at all. Sometimes it's a little bit hard to reach but not too hard.  I take it out for sex because otherwise we can feel it. I am so grateful for this! I went into menopause early and this has really helped me get back to normal.,,F,,180  days 1X D,1/23/2014,Estring

It gave me a renewed vagina but ive now got sore breasts_ abdominal cramping just like i used to have with my periods_ and it is EVERY day. My symptoms get worse starting 2 months in to my ring_ & my insurance only will pay for 90 days. Ive 9 days to go & my hot flashes and my mood    is explosive.

47, 1, vaginal atrophy_ lubrication_,Daily splitting headaches_ crying jags/depression_ hair loss_ weight gain,Stupidly_ I tried to excuse the side effects because it did work for vaginal atrophy and lubrication.  Finally_ my intuition told me in no uncertain terms to pull it out.  My husband had to do it.  I can't believe my gyno did not educate me about side effects although I should have done the research.  I was too desperate for a cure.  Interestingly_  I have not had any of these problems with Viville dot patch.  All I can think of is that vaginal delivery is much more potent.,F,58,3  months 1X D,12/13/2013,Estring

Got a bad case of the chills_ nausea and cramps.  But the worst was the dark yellowish foul discharge_ requiring me to wear a lite day after many years!    Ewwwwww.

After eight hours I couldn't take it anymore. My husband had to pull it out and couldn't believe how far up he had to go to  reach it. It hurt terribly when he was pulling it down. Ring is large and circular - I am small and narrow. Bad combo. They should make much smaller.,,F,47,1  days,9/21/2013,Estring
53, 4, Vaginal dryness,Loved it. Cured dryness_ went in pretty easily (a little tricky)_ Never felt it_ partner didn't feel it_  Love the fact i only had to insert it once every three months. The only problem was I had a lot of difficulty getting it out. I just couldn't reach it with my fingers and my partner had to pull it out for me (and he could barely reach it)_ When I talked to my ob-gyn  about this she said I had an exceptionally Long vagina and that was probably the problem. She hadn't had other patients with this issue.,If they only had a way to Get it out in my situation_ it would be perfect!!!!!,F,62,10  years2 mg 1X O,9/15/2013,Estring

Witin two days I was notified that I needed to have another mammogram and an ultra sound. I had both done and within a couple of days I was told that I needed a biopsy on my left breast. Had test done and found out that I had stage two breast cancer and it was also in my lymph nod. There is no history of breast cancer in my family and the only change I had was the E=string. I read the pamplet that came with it and in very small print it said that it could cause breast cancer. If I had known I would have never used it.,F,55,8  months 1X D,7/17/2013Email,Estring
57, 2, frequent uti_ vaginal dryness,some weight gain_ hot flashes increased,The estring helped with dryness and any atrophy going on but the reason why I was put on the estring to begin with was for recurring uti's.  I had alot of hope until after 7 months I got a full blown uti.  Now I'm back on antibiotics and have discontinued use of the estring.  Before I started the estring_ I took probiotics and was able to go longer without a uti.  I'm going back to my probiotics.

60, 1, Yes,Estrogen absorbed into my bloodstream causing high billi rubin count. The reading indicates the medicine is being filtered through the liver. Because this side effect didn't show up in studies_ my endocronologist thought it was due to my thyroid medicine and prescribed thyroid removal. After careful evaluation of my blood work a second doctor realised estring was the culprit. Blood work showed my estrogen levels were sky high as were billi rubins. I reported side effect to manufacturer and stopped estring. Billi rubins back to normal. Had my blood not been monitored for Graves estring could have caused serious problems down the road. Aside from potential liver damage I had no other side effects. I wish they made a lower dose ring my body cold tolerate. I loved the ease of the estring.,,F,50,6  months 1X O,2/10/2013,Estring

My libido is very low_ however_ it has not helped with that at all. This medicine is expensive_ and now my drug insurance wants me to switch to something else or pay a higher percentage of the price myself. The cream was too much trouble so I didn't use it; the ring is the way to go.

While I am relieved of the dry tenderness of my vulva and vaginal walls_ I seem to have lost my libido_ which is seriously troubling!,I wasn't able to have a pap smear easily for the last few years before using this insert.  I hadn't been in a relationship and/or having sex before_ so that wasn't an issue_ but then I met someone.  When we got close enough for me to share intimate details and then have sex_ I was relieved to not have any issues with pain or tearing.  I am concerned about not feeling sexual and/or having an orgasm_ which was previously not something that bothered me_ but maybe that will level out in time with usage and with the relationship.

Symptoms have cleared; I am now well-lubricated and have not had even a hint of a UTI since I inserted the first ring.  I previously used Estrace cream_ but I hated the inconvenience and it didn't seem to help the symptoms as much as Estring does.  I have zero problems inserting or removing Estring.  My fiance says he ""might be able to feel it during intercourse"" but it doesn't bother him.  I can't feel it at all_ any time.

70, 4, Vaginal Atrophy,Discomfort_ abdominal cramps_ Vaginal Swelling,I am 54 and have used Estrace Cream for last 4 years.  Was tired of having to insert an applicator full every other night and wearing a panty liner the next day.  Also the cream didn't provide a uniform result and I always still burned after intercourse.  My Dr. suggested I try the Estring for 3 months and see what I thought.  Have been using Estring for 8 weeks  & just love the results I'm getting.  My Vagina feels normal again and doesn't hurt during intercourse or burn afterwards.  However_ there are down sides to this drug.  My husband can feel it and it is not comfortable for me either- so now I take it out before sex. Another thing is It never feels like it is inserted properly even though I insert it into the vagina as far as I can_  by the end of each week I am swollen inside and uncomfortable with it riding so low in the vagina and my side aches (I do push it back up throughout the week) So_ for the last two weeks I have been removing the ring on Friday night and reinserting it back on Sunday night before I go to bed. This gives me a break over the weekend.  By Monday Morning I'm back to normal & I usually don't feel the the discomfort from the ring again until about thursday afternoon. This seems to be the only way I can use this drug. I will finish out my 3 months_ then take a month or so using the cream again_ then back to the ring for another 3 months.  I would recommend Estring. The results are awesome just the discomfort that's not.,F,54,8  weeks 1X O,4/21/2012,Estring

75, 5, Vaginal Dryness and Urinary Urgency,None,At first I was reluctant that this ring could help my severe symptoms_ but within a week the vaginal dryness and urinary urgency were gone. It gave me my life back! Be patient with it the first two days as it takes a couple of days for the body to become used to the feeling and then I didn't notice it was there. I personally like to remove it once every week just to rinse the ring off with lukewarm water and reinsert directly after and I remove while having sexual intercourse as it tends to get in the way and then I reinsert afterwards. I will use this indefinitely as long as it is working for me. I recently placed a new second ring as the first lasted me only about 80 days before I began noticing vaginal dryness and urinary urgency that brought me to the ring.

77, 4, vaginal atrophy,prior to estrogen replacement I experienced severe vaginal atrophy and painful sexual intercourse. I tried transvaginal cream but found it messy and inconvient. I hated it and wouldn't use it as frequently as I should bringing my issues back,The first day I put the estring in it was VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. I thought for sure it was not inserted correctly. I did multiple internet searches to see other peoples experiences and that is why I am writing this.  I am a 41 year old post surgical menopausal woman since the age of 28.  The first day I used the estring it felt like it was going to come out and it almost felt like I was on the verge of bad cramps. I was just so uncomfortable and didn't think I could use the device. I took it out and inserted it again several times thinking it wasn't high enough.  By day 2 I could feel it but it wasn't uncomfortalbe anymore.  By day 3 my body had totally adjusted and I can't even tell it is there.  So I just wanted to let other women know that it does get better-just give it a few days.  I have not tried to have sex with it yet since it's not been long enough but I can't imagine I will be able to with the device in. Because of my hysterectomy I do not have a cervix and think my vaginal canal is probably shorter which along with the atrophy contributed to my first day of pain.,F,41,4  days2mg 1X O,2/12/2012Email,Estring

After a year or so_ I got a whopper yeast infection so I took the Estring out and threw it away...Dryness was back with a vengeance within a week or two and hotflashes were back. My refill wasn't due for 8 more weeks_ so I suffered through rather than pay out of pocket. Sex was terribly painful and I worried it would remain that way. Not so--within a week of the new Estring lubrication was back and within two weeks all vaginal dryness and painful intercourse was gone within a couple of months_ the hotflashes faded too. MD said I didn't need to take it out for the yeast infection--I'll take her advice if I get another one.,I've had some of the side effects/symptoms described: weight gain_ cramping_ sore breasts_ joint pain_ but don't attribute them to the Estring.

I am 60 now and have been using Estring for about 3 years.  It is great_ but sometimes it actually seems to fold in half after intercourse_ and removal is very difficult.  However_ the crochet hook did the trick - a VERY large one with rounded edges.  Periodically I take a brief holiday just to see how my body feels - it takes about two weeks for me to notice the symptoms that brought me to Estring to begin with.  Much better than creams_ in my opinion; when I was using those I seemed to have frequent UTIs.,F,60,3  years1 1X D,8/16/2011,Estring

My gyno recommended the Estring and my life HAS BEEN CHANGED!  I am lubricated again_ am able to have orgasms_ and am totally ENJOYING sex for the first time in a long time.  My husband has no complaints_ says he cannot even feel the ring_ and it does not interfere with oral sex at all.  I am just concerned that after 5 months I am beginning to gain weight because of it.  I also wake up at about 4:30 almost every morning and cannot go back to sleep - this just started in the past month or so.  Nothing is different in my life except the Estring_ so I am worried that the Estring is causing the side effects.

But for many years_ this was sufficient.",I never had side effects. Tho I am a real ninny_ I have found it easy to insert and remove_ if I did not leave it in more than 3 mos. The middle finger makes a good soft hook providing you do not have long nails. A little lubricant helps if the ring seems stuck.

It was only after going online and reading these comments that my own suspicions were confirmed.  As a breast cancer survivor_ I do not have any other choice.

I didn't know wheter it was related to the ring or not but I decided to remove it and had it out for about 2months_ the hypoglycemic episodes stopped (they couldn't find any medical reason for them) and the UTI's started back again so I reinserted a new ring with in 2&1/2 weeks my blood sugar started dropping again.

I'm amazed to read that people have problems because it was so perfect for my needs.,Fantastic.  I couldn't feel it inserted_ I merely felt 100% better.

(Love is grand :-),"I'm going to ask my doctor for an estrogen pill you insert in you vagina or an estrogen cream you insert in your vagina instead of the Esting. Those are the other two options he suggested when he suggested the Estring. I chose the Estring because I thought it would be a simpler option. I took transdermal estrogen for years as part of a combined estrogen_ progesterone and testosterone hormone replacement therapy_ but went off everything four or fivr months ago and was finding my vagina dry and easily torn.On the transdermal estrogen_ I had very little vaginal sodour and my husband said it was a ""nice"" smell_ so I don't think it's the estrogen.

103, 2, vaginal dryness,The ring worked extremely well for the first 5 months though I felt mild crampy discomfort occasionally.

Still itching_ waiting to see doctor to see how I can relieve the itching.

106, 3, burning_ itching of vulva,hot flashes,I am 68 years old_ have had the estrogen patch for years_ recently became sexually active after nine years and was experiencing painful intercourse and burning and itching. There was no evidence of yeast_ so the doctor suggested the cream_ but it was too messy. So_ I switched to the Estring and use the cream twice a week on the outside_ because I was told the estrogen from the patch does not get to the vagina_ and the estrogen from the ring does not get to the vulva. While all the other problems have subsided since using the Estring_ I now have hot flashes which are making me pretty miserable.,F,68,2  weeks2mg 4X O,7/30/2010,Estring
107, 3, vaginal atrophy,Hair thinning after 3 months.,I used an estrogen cream for a few weeks prior to insertion and didn't have trouble_ removal was a little stressful--crochet hook helped.  Got a yeast infection right away_ which I treated with OTC meds. No recurrences.  The Estring relieved my vaginal dryness and greatly reduced tearing--still had to use lubricants_ though. I even seemed to sleep better.  But after 3 months started noticing hair thinning--mostly around the temples.  My hairdresser noticed too.  Didn't relate to the Estring until 9th month when I re-read the product insert. I removed the Estring and I'm not refilling Rx. Frankly_ I'd rather have hair than sex!  I am switching to KY ovules.

109, 5, Vaginal Atrophy,None,Around age 50_ as I was going into menopause_ I began having slight urinal leakage while I was jogging_ or dancing_ or if I sneezed while standing. It became more of a problem as time went on during any activity requiring physical exertion (even walking fast)  so I started to use light days pads_ then progressed to light Tenna and Poise pads. I often had urgency to urinate. Intercourse was uncomfortable due to dryness_ so we started using a lubricant. I noticed my vagina was 'drying up and shrinking'. My Dr. recommended Estring because it delivers only estrogen locally (and it is not systemic like the creams that have both estrogen and progestin which will make you menstruate). Now my vagina is back_ with body_ full and plump!  I notice a slight more fullness in my lower abs; but no weight gain_ no hair loss_ no dark circles - none of the side effects that others reported_ which could have also been due to menopause.  I can now go to the gym without wearing a pad and have no leakage! Only word of caution: the ring may move forward during contractions during bowels movements_ so be ware because you may have to push it back with your finger before you stand up or it will fall out!,F,53,3  weeks2 mg 1X D,6/5/2010Email,Estring

I also had my very first UTI _coincidentally_ just a week before the cyst was discovered.  I feel quite strongly that both the UTI and the ovarian cyst are a result of using the Estring.  There is no other reason at age 57 that I would get both of these ailments within the same timeframe_ and for the first time in my life_ and only after using the Estring; also the first time I've used any type of synthetic form of estrogen.,,F,57,12  months 1X O,4/26/2010Email,Estring

119, 5, ,Before using estring I had severe vaginal atrophy. Even simple wiping would tear me down there. Forget sex it was like cut glass and I bled all the time. I haven't had a period for at least 3 years so I am completely through menopause.  I tried creams yet they gave me horrible UTI's. My doctor prescribed the estring.,I am happy to report I am well. This medication made a huge difference for me. I take progesterone for 10 days every 3 months too. However_ my hair started thinning like crazy. Not sure if it was the lack estrogen in my body or the estring. I contemplated removing it and in fact did for about a month to have my hair to continue to fall out and the symptoms returned with a vengeance. So back on estring I went and began Rogaine and to my delight even though I am not fond of the Rogaine all my hair has returned and even seems a bit thicker than ever before. I recommend estring for vaginal atrophy as it made a difference for me. What my doctor explained to me was that this entire ring was about the amount I was using cream wise but is put exactly where it is needed and is secreted slowly.,F,51,1  years2 mg 1X M,4/3/2010,Estring

I also wake with pain in the joints of my hands. Now that I took the estring out_ the vaginal dryness and burning during intercourse is back [bummer] but I want to keep it out and see if the leg cramps go away!
