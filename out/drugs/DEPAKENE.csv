0, 3, epilepsy,weight gain_ general slow metabolism.,This was added to my phenobarbitol and took my seizures down from once a month to complete control.  But nobody told me about the interaction between these two drugs.  Evidently the dep potentiates the pheno increasing its blood level so if you try to step back your dose on the dep or the two together it's like a crash cold turkey on the pheno levels.,F,53,9  years1000mg 1X D,5/27/2015,Depakene
1, 1, Epilepsy,One of the most miserable experiences in my life was taking this medication. To me Depekene never really felt right from the start with it giving me feelings of mild fogginess and never really controlling the seizures to well. But the real problems didn't really start occurring until I had a breakthrough seizure at 14.5 years old and the neurologist increased the dose to 1750mg causing me to become extremely sleepy and sleep for 12-14 hours every day and even when I wasn't in bed I would still fall asleep at school to a point where the teacher even had to call my parents. It wasn't until last year when the medication actually started triggering more seizures than if I wasn't taking it that the neurologist requested a blood test and discovered toxic levels of Depakote in my blood and told me to come off it asap and I immediately started to feel better about a week after totally coming off it_ but to be honest I've never really felt the same as before. But stopping all my complaining about all the bad stuff I've gone through with this medication my bottom line is that I highly suggest not giving this  to anyone under the age of 16_ this medication is dangerous to children and should be a last result for there is a much higher chance of OD'ing at a young age that could possibly cause permanent brain damage. So if you notice being extremely tired on this medication call your doctor asap and insist on a blood test.,,M,16,2  years1500-2000,3/17/2014Email,Depakene
