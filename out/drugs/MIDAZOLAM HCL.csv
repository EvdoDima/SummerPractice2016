0, 1, Endoscopy,This drug gave me permanent memory loss_ PTSD and outrageous anxiety,I had this given to me with no warning of amnesia and other side effects in 1991. I still suffer from it 24 years later.  Never ever let anyone talk you into taking this mind altering poison.,F,32,1  days,6/2/2015Email,Midazolam hcl
1, 1, Gastroscopy,I have very sore cold legs_ no matter what I do I cant get warm. Shaking_ headache feel like iv got gloves on_ cant really feel my fingers properly.,Was told I was going to have mild sedative & wouldn't feel a thing. I felt like I was choking & could hear the nurse shouting at me. Then wen I woke up I felt like I didn't no where I was & just wanted to get out as fast as I could. This all happened on 19th Jan 2015.,F,49,1  days2mg,1/19/2015Email,Midazolam hcl
2, 5, several surgical procedures,i've had over a dozen surgeries and every time midazolam was used...it relaxed me so much and helped out a great deal!,,F,21,1  daysnot sure,4/9/2013Email,Midazolam hcl
3, 1, partial thyroid lobectomy,total amnesia after surgical procedure,Had very bad results from this surgery. PONV_ bronchspasms_ you name it. Suffered a paralysed vocal chord but didn't remember anything at all post surgery. Only found out about the drug later. All day in Post Anesthesia Care Unit and I remember nothing. NEVER AGAIN!,F,72,  1X D,9/4/2012,Midazolam hcl
4, 5, Pre-surgery,Euphoria_ slight loss of motor control,"I was given this medication intravenously once before surgery and I must say I was highly impressed.  Within thirty seconds I felt high as a kite - much more so than the times I had taken Xanax.  This drug made me emotionally calm yet I was more physically in control than the one time I took 10 mg of Valium before surgery.  I am shocked to see all these negative reviews of this medication.  When it kicked in my first thought was ""Wow! Now THIS is what I am talking about.""  I had no negative side effects either.",M,23,1  daysunknown 1X D,6/23/2012,Midazolam hcl
5, 1, 	Cataract,Panic_ trembling_ tachycardia. Felt weird and unsettled for weeks after.,The emotions were bizarre and frightening. Not an anxiety reducer at all.,M,67,1  times 1X AN,2/22/2012,Midazolam hcl
6, 1, Unknown!,Given to me prior to a minor surgery_ my memory of the events is intermittent. What I recall is barely being able to move or speak_ and not being happy about it.,Fuzzy memory_ slow thinking_ mood swings_ not at all my normal self for almost 3 weeks afterward. I learned of the Versed after questioning my dr.  and getting a hard copy of my record.,M,45,1  times2 1X AN,8/5/2011,Midazolam hcl
7, 1, anesthesia induction?,Amnesia_ anxiety_ distrust_ anger_ flashbacks,"I wasn't warned about amnesia like others posting. Was told it would ""relax"" me. I told them I didn't really need anything to relax_ but got the shot anyway. It didn't help me AT ALL_ in fact I am still upset and angry weeks later. Maybe some people like paying a professional (so called) to just mistreat them. No thanks. I changed doctors_ and no one will ever give me anything to ""relax"" me again. Bad drug for me_ and wasn't told about effects.",F,56, 2 1X D,7/22/2011Email,Midazolam hcl
8, 1, pre colonoscopy,Anger_ depression_ memory issues_ unable to return to work the next day.,"Was flat out told I'd be awake and responsive_ not ""out"".  Was not told of the amnesia.  I was shocked and then angry when the process was complete and I had no recall.",M,50,1  timesunknown 1X AN,7/9/2011,Midazolam hcl
9, 1, colonoscopy,Prolonged amnesia_ confusion_ fear,Requested to be awake_ amnesia was never mentioned_ woke up terrified_ confused_ and angry_ felt like hours of my life were missing_ procedure itself only lasted 15 minutes.  I feel so betrayed by my doctor.  If it is truly given for the patient's benefit_ it would be explained. The real problems  begin after the patients get home_ and then they don't care_ won't return your calls_ deny there are any problems with the drug.  Hundreds of us know better.  Shame on the medical profession.,F,51,1  days5MG 1X H,6/25/2011,Midazolam hcl
10, 1, not sure: it was prior to surgery,immediate:amnesia. for weeks after:_ anxiety_ fear_ nightmares_flashbacks_ now at six months:finally anger.,"This was a very scary experience for me. Like others_ I was told it was ""to relax"" me. I was on a gurney_ in a hospital gown_ with an IV in my left arm running antibiotocs in a preop area surrounded by strangers. I cannot forget the smirk on the face of the woman that injected it into my IV. ""Amnesia"" was never mentioned. For weeks I had panic attacks and still cannot go for my follow up check up because of the nightmares and fear.  This drug took away my ability to remember anything for about 8 hours except severe pain_ wanting to escape_ and feeling like I was helpless because I couldn't move. This memory comes in waves_ without warning.I could never recommend this drug to any one. They may as well have hit me on the head with a hammer: I really hope any one reading this post will be better informed than I was.I also hope the stinkers that do this get their pants sued off.",F,58,1  days2 mg 2X D,4/27/2011Email,Midazolam hcl
11, 1, Inguinal Hernia,Totally blindsided by the amnesia part_ was not told anything_ I didn't even know anything was in the IV. I was in the holding area and instantly it was 90 minutes later and I was in recovery. It was mentally like being slammed up against a wall. Very jarring and I am still angry months later.,Let's see: a drug with the main purpose of causing amnesia. It is not a pain killer. Too bad if you go through hell_ you won't remember to complain about it.I wasn't supposed to be having general anesthesia but to me it might as well have been.,M,40,1  times2 1X O,4/24/2011,Midazolam hcl
12, 1, colonoscopy,Numerous. I went from my usual calm couldn't-care-less to half-PANIC. There was an odd feeling that the drug actually forced TENSION on me. Breathing became laborious and  I felt I had to work at inhaling. I became restless and agitated. For weeks afterward I was slow at everything_ memory was shaky. I had odd relapse episodes where my tension and anxiety would suddenly climb like a rocket and I would be shaken up for 15 minutes or so. ,"I would love to see the world's supply destroyed so that nobody ever experiences what I did. Sign me up for the job. Judging from some of these ""5"" ratings_ looks like there's a bunch of medical people trying to defend their precious drug. This drug should never be used for any procedure.",M,47,1  times2 1X AN,3/17/2011,Midazolam hcl
13, 1," Alleged ""Anxiety""",Blackout,"Nobody said a word about blacking out for hours.  Was told it was ""liquid Valium.""  That's about as complete a lie as I have ever heard.  I woke up strapped down.  They said I was strapped because I had a ""reaction"" to one of their drugs.  At no time did they admit that it was their ""liquid Valium.""   I've had valium before and it was nothing like this drug.  NOTHING!  I am angry and ashamed_ neurotic about any more ""minor"" procedures where medical people lie and sneak a nasty drug like this into a person.  Rot in Hell you dingbats.  Unbelievable what passes for medicine these days.",M,36,1  times? 1X AN,3/3/2011,Midazolam hcl
14, 1, rotator cuff surgery,Groggy stupid feeling_ major depression_ anxiety_ crying jags and feeling of hopelessness. DO NOT GET AMNESIA!!!,"I have had Versed many times as you can tell and each time the amnesia didn't work and I was left in agony_ unable to move and screaming in pain while my nurses laughed and said ""you won't remember this honey"" The last 2 times I have begged not to have it and they agreed. They lied and just gave me MORE! Last Wednesday I finally got them to agree to give me general anesthetic so that I could avoid Versed. I even wrote NO VERSED on my arm where they put the IV. They said OK_ but when they got the IV running_ they argued with me over Versed and gave it to me anyway! I still have not returned to work... I WORK in a Dr.s office and he won't have Versed given to him! So depressed that I can't do anything but cry. Thanks Versed and all those people in the hospital.",F,52,8  times2? 1X H,2/5/2011,Midazolam hcl
15, 1, endoscopy,Actually CAUSED anxiety when I was calm to start with_ also dizziness_ fear_ and agitation; developed into rage_ fear of falling asleep_ and then deep depression when I couldn't figure out what happened to me_ and the doctor & nurse evaded my questions and were COMPLETELY uncaring and cold to me,Something must be wrong with this drug if medical people are sneaky and forceful about using it_ without explaining it to patients. There is almost universal lack of informed consent regarding its use. WHY ???,F,50,1  days 1X D,12/31/2010Email,Midazolam hcl
16, 1, ansethesia for same day surgery,Panic_ breathing difficulties_ scared both me and the doctors.,Highly recommend you stay away from it. Bad drug!,F,55,  1X D,11/30/2010,Midazolam hcl
17, 1, pre-op hernia repair,Plenty. I'm normally not afraid of surgery. It scared the hell out of me. My husband said I tried to get up and leave. I nearly fell since I had no coordination. Lasting memory problems. Vertigo. Weird semi-panic episodes during the day_ nightmarish dreams at night.  Feeling unrefreshed after eight hours sleep for months afterward. ,Sorry I didn't Google this beforehand_ but I didn't know this drug was being used until my husband called and asked. We had no idea.Add me to the list of people who were never told about the amnesia. This is a lie of omission and it angers me because it is deliberate.,F,44,1  times 1X AN,11/6/2010,Midazolam hcl
18, 1, Prior to Hip Replacement Surgery,I was not anxious prior to the surgery but my doctor ordered the versed added to the IV anyway. Why bother to ask if you're going to just walk all over me anyway?? Within minutes I felt a bizarre disconnect with reality. I was not sure why  I was there and began asking to leave.,In the future I will demand that this drug not be used on me!,M,52,1  times 1X D,10/26/2010,Midazolam hcl
19, 1, Upper GI endoscopy,I  had memory problems and cognitive difficulties for  months after the procedure. I had a second procedure three years later and asked to not have this of drug but it was administered anyway. The second time the side effects were even worse. I cannot in good conscience recommend this drug as the risk of side effects is too great.,I recommend against having this drug under any circumstances. The amnesia and other mental effects can linger in some people.  Versed is not a pain killer - it is used to cause amnesia and compliance. You will still feel the pain but you will not remember it_ which is not the same thing as not experiencing the pain at all. I have found articles suggesting implicit memories remain.,M,51,2  times2mg 1X AN,10/13/2010,Midazolam hcl
20, 1, don't know,Blackout_ anxiety and rage afterward,"I was very upset about not remembering what happened to me.  The hospital told me it was ""normal"" to have a complete blackout of events at the hospital.  They refused to tell me why.  Imagine my shock when I watched an old ""Law and Order"" rerun and their Doc was talking about ""Dazzle.""  That's when I understood what those sneaky so and so's did to me.  No wonder I'm nervous_ upset and angry.  Nobody ever mentioned this drug at any time_ nor did I give permission for any drug of this kind.  They just snuck it in the IV and it was supposed to be antibiotics.  I wish I could have them all arrested for assault.",F,32,1  times 1X O,9/3/2010,Midazolam hcl
21, 1, set broken wrist,"This was the second time I broke a wrist. I was not in pain_ but just very uncomfortable. I was GLAD when they went to set it. But then the idiots_ for no reason_ decided to hit me with Versed (Midazolam). I went from a fairly calm_ neutral state to downright terrified. In my mind_ logically_ I had no reason to be upset. It was like the drug FORCED me to become unstable. I do not drink or use drugs_ maybe it only works on experienced ""users"".",I had a broken wrist when I was 7. They set it quickly and quite painlessly using no drugs at all. I was scared at the time_ but would not have been if I knew how simple it was going to be. With the Versed (Midazolam)_ the situation is reversed. I will RUN to the nearest exit if I even know Versed is in the same hospital as me.,M,28,1  times?? 1X D,8/24/2010,Midazolam hcl
22, 1, outpatient surgery,Confusion_ hostility and docility.  Long term chronic anxiety and PTSD ensued.  Took years to recover my mental processes.,"Don't ever let anybody near you with this drug if you value your brain.  This stuff causes chemically induced Altzheimers if you are LUCKY!  Otherwise destroys your brain and personality for a time_ and sometimes a long time.  Don't buy the line that it's for ""relaxation.""  It actually knocks you on your a**_ but the control that it gives medical people and the ability to hide or mask the abuse they will subject you to is the real reason for using this drug.  It's unethical_ immoral and pure patient abuse to inject anybody with this drug_ especially without informed consent_ just the ""relaxation"" line.",M,42,1  times7 2X H,8/20/2010,Midazolam hcl
