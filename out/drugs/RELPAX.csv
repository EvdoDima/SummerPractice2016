0, 2, Migraine,My doctor gave me a sample pack when I told her that my previous medication Maxalt was taken much longer to take affect than it used to. I took the Replax with the onset of the migraine yet it took a full three hours before I felt any relief. Frequent unination and severe thirst_ dry throat/mouth kept me awake for the remainder of the night. The next day I left very groggy and weak in the limbs.,I do think think that I will be using Replax again and will stick with Maxalt.,F,52,1  days20mg 1X D,6/23/2016,Relpax
1, 5, Migraines,I have suffered migraines since my 20's. I avoid my food triggers_ and now only get them when the barometric pressure drops. I bought a weather barometer_ it helps me to understand why a migraine is starting. Sometimes i get the nausea first- relpax helps. The down side of relpax is it drains me of energy..the migraine eventually goes away_ but drowsiness sets in and then i start to sweat...,Only med that works for me. I started with 20 mg but now go right to the 40 mg the neurologist prescribed.,F,61,1  days40 mg,6/21/2016,Relpax
2, 5, Migraine,I had no side effects when I first started taking Relpax.  At that time_ I needed it so much!  Now_ whenever I take one as I need them less frequently_ I get sick to my stomach.  It relieves my migraine pain tho_ so that is what is important for me!!  This is the only medicine that has EVER helped me..and I have tried pretty much all migraine meds over the years..,I believe it has been around 13 years on this medication..I cannot remember exactly when I started taking it tho as it has been awhile.  Also_ I must always have some of this on hand as it is the only thing that works for my migraines.  With that being said_ 6 pills at $256 is so much money!!  We recently changed insurance plans and this is how much I have to pay.  Tho_ on my previous insurance it was only $10 with the Relpax savings card! It's crazy how it can be so expensive with one plan over another.,F,38,13  years40mg 1X AN,5/11/2016Email,Relpax
3, 5, Migraines since childhood,Extreme sleepiness_ dizziness_ and weakness.,Wonder drug for me. I don't think it's safe to operate a vehicle after taking this drug for the next 12 hours due to the side effects.,F,45,5  years40 mg,5/3/2016,Relpax
4, 5, Migraines since I am 19,Slight drowsiness_ more frequent urination and occasionally hazy feeling; more sensitive to hot water on hands and hot drinks seems hotter after taking the pill.,This is a miracle drug for me despite the minor side effects that I have.  I do not even mind them but I am aware of them every time.  I get  about 8-10 migraines a month.  I take the pill at the first onset of my migraine.  I already feel relief within 30-45 min.  Wipes it right out!! However_ there are times when I decide to wait it out and then the migraine is so painful I can barely see straight...on those occasions_ when I do finally take the pill_ it takes longer for the pill to give me relief.  I have never needed a second pill.,F,47, 40mg 1X AN,4/19/2016Email,Relpax
5, 5, migraine headaches,Slight drowsiness_sensitive to hot water on hands and hot coffee seems hotter when taking the pill.,Prior to taking Relpax my migraines would last 12 or more hours and my day would be spent in bed as soon as I feel it coming on I'll take 1 pill and that pretty much does the trick about 95% of the time and that's a miracle to me!!,M,53,2  years40 Mg,2/6/2016Email,Relpax
6, 4, Migraines,Heavy feeling In upper body and extremities. Numbness in hands. Severe tightness in throat_ hurts to swallow. nausea.,Side effects were not pleasant_ but were bearable. Zofran helps with the nausea. The side effects were better than a full blown migraine.,F,49,1  months40 Mg,1/8/2016,Relpax
7, 5, Migraine,Side effects are very bad_ I am sleepy_ can't work. Also I can't swallow and I have pain in the throat. After taking Relpax I drink a lot of water like I can't stop but still better than that awful pain :(,Migrex and Relpax are only medicine that helped me with migraine,F,28,6  months40,10/30/2015,Relpax

11, 4, migraine (hormonal),I have taken imitrex injections for many many years and never found anything else that worked even half as well but I recently lost insurance coverage and had to find something more affordable.  Doc suggested this.  It seems to knock the pain of taken early enough.  The first few times I took it I didn't have any significant side effects but tonight I had some very scary chest pain/pressure.  It brought me to tears_ felt like a very tight squeezing around my chest.    It's eased quite a bit now_ couple hours later_ but not completely gone.  I don't have an alternative med and the migraines are unbearable so I guess I'll continue to take it but I'll make sure another adult is around just in case it happens again and is serious.,Probably a very good med for most_ just getting a tad nervous about that side effect,F,49,5  months40,5/13/2015Email,Relpax

13, 5, Migraine,Around 30 minutes after taking 40mg my head starts to clear and the migraine is gone. I've never had to take more than 40mg. If I take one before sleeping I usually wake up feeling muscular stiffness all over.,Have to admit I don't go to the gym for 24 hours after taking a relpax because I'm afraid it will be too much for my system. Also get sleepy_ groggy_ but I can work and drive.,F,57,15  years40 mg 1X D,3/12/2015,Relpax
14, 5, migraines,Sometimes I feel a little nauseous and tired in phases before the pill kicks in but after that the migraine is gone. After many years of taking it_ I started to feel like it's a diuretic also and I get itchy all over but mostly my scalp_ still better then a migraine though,This has been the only thing that's ever helped me and I've suffered from migraines since I was 3. I just wish I knew what the long term side effects mean for me.,F,38,10  years40,12/5/2014Email,Relpax
15, 5, Migraines since I was 13,When I first stared this med many years ago_ I had to take the pill and go straight to bed. I can now take this meds and continue to work and go on about my day. The only thing that I notice the most is that it makes me urinate a lot after I take it.,I really am glad that this was suggested for me to try. Before this med I was having to make frequent trips to the ER. Relpax seems to always work for me. I do know that if I have to take the second one and it don't work then I know it's off to ER_ but Praise the Lord_ not had to go in a good while. Thank you RELPAX!,F,35,7  years40mg 1X D,11/11/2014,Relpax
16, 4, Migraine,I took the Relpax today_a friend of mine gave it to me and it definitely worked. I'm quite satisfied with the drug. At first I was afraid to use it after reading all the comments regarding it. But the pain was so severe I had no choice_and I'm glad I did because it helped me. And I'm no longer in pain. I suffer with migraine because of hormonenal reasons.I also wanna add I was fortunate not to have bad side effects_ I just got sleepy and felt some laziness.,,F,30,1  days1,10/29/2014,Relpax
17, 2, Migraines,Initially my head began to feel much better. 30 minutes later I began to get lock-jaw. Felt my body temperature drop_ I was freezing to the touch (says my boyfriend)_ and I was sweating profusely. My jaw hurt so badly down my neck_ back arm and into my chest. I had a hard time breathing. I could barely open my mouth to talk. It was terrifying. My heart rate increased. I was so dizzy and later vomited. It took my migraine of three days_ away amazingly but the side effects were seriously scary. Just didn't work well with my body I guess.,,F,23,1  days40 mg,10/25/2014Email,Relpax
18, 5, migraine,I feel a bit spacey and out of it for a few hours after taking relpax unless I can take it and sleep for an hour or so then I feel okay. I also feel very sensitive to tastes and I crave a coke. I never drink coke but I need one when I take a relpax. Also this may be too much info but I can not have an orgasm when taking this.,Relpax has been a godsend for me. I have had migraines since I was 12 and it takes the migraine away fully.,F,42,8  years40 mg 1X AN,9/24/2014Email,Relpax
19, 5, migraine,Have occasionally had the chest tightness and tingling/lightheadedness. Recently though_ has started having a diuretic effect_ which never had before. I have the same thing with Benedryl - in the bathroom every 15-20 minutes.,As long as I take it with the onset of symptoms and don't wait too long to figure out if it is really a migraine or not_ it works. If I take it too late_ it doesn't matter cause I can't keep it down.,M,52,8  years 1X AN,9/5/2014,Relpax

24, 5, Migraines,NO side effects!,I started taking Relpax in 2003.  What a Godsend this medication is!  It knocks my migraines out (which are hormone related) every single time.  I do sometimes still have the dull pain_ but nothing like a full blown migraine.  I guess I am very lucky to have zero side effects from this drug.  I can't recommend this drug highly enough!,F,38,11  years40MG 1X AN,4/1/2014Email,Relpax
25, 1, Migraine,Swollen face and neck_ black/blueish around eyes looks like I was in a brawl_ extreme back neck pain lasting all day so far_ tiredness_ still migraine  meds made everything worse_ including my headache. Tightness in chest. Harder to breathe. Burning in throat_ feels alot worse when drinking hot liquids-seems like I was drinking acid!! Horrible!! Slept all day. Face a mess. Emotionally feeling like I was on another planet. All my joints hurt. I would not recommend trying this medication at  all!! I wish I would've read these before hand_ if I did_ I would've never even taken the chance. Trust me_ don't try it! I can't wait till this feeling wears off!! I hate migraines_ but at least I know what it is -  the way I look and feel right now_ I don't know how serious it is!!! Try something else! Good luck to everyone!,HORRIBLE !!!!!,F,40,1  days40mg 1X D,2/8/2014Email,Relpax
26, 5, Migraine,Slight diuretic effect,I take only as needed for a migraine.  This medication has been the best!  I have taken it for years and it still works.  I have built up a resistance to most of the other medications I have taken. It works quickly and I can remain at work.

27, 5, Extreme migraines in hospital from,When I take my relax I have to take a phenegran and find a bed ASAP.  That is a lot better than having to be in a hospital from a migraine,I have had migraines all my life 11 years ago they were so bad I was hospitalized for almost a month.  My medical team tried everything.  Finally a student nurse suggested Relpax and phenegran.  Luckily my drs tried me on it and it has been a Godsend ever since.  I only take it when I absolutely have to.  My insurance company with very high co pays will only let me have six a month.  That just doesn't cut what I need when I do.  While taking care of my disabled Iraq war vet that is my husband.,F,38,11  years40mg 1X AN,12/7/2013,Relpax
28, 5, Anemia induced migraine,I'm usually very sensitive to medication side effects_ but I handled this surprisingly well.  The only side effects I was that my one foot temporarily lost feeling.  My doctor had warned me I might lose sensation in my hands or feet.,I LOVED this.  This is the only prescription med I tried for my anemia induced migraine.  I had a 12 day straight global migraine before I went to the neurologist.  A few days after my appt I had another bad migraine start.  I took the Relpax and within 30 minutes I was feeling so much better.,F,30,1  times 1X AN,12/3/2013,Relpax

31, 1, Chronic migraines,Tingling around jaw line_ nausea_ fatigue. Overall felt gross. Hot flashes. Would rather have the migraine,I really did not like relpax_ although it did take the migraine away after about an hour the side effects were just too much. I would rather have continued to suffer with the migraine than have all these side effects.,F,27,1  weeks40 mg 1X D,9/14/2013,Relpax
32, 4, chronic migraines,"chest tightness_ pain in jaw and neck_ sleepiness_ feeling ""out of it""_ burning sensation in head",took my migraine away within 1 hour. I was already 12 hours into this headache and nothing else worked. side effects are not pleasant_ but more bearable than the migraine itself. I only take this if nothing else works_ and I have to be at work or some other important function.,F,31, 40mg 1X AN,9/4/2013,Relpax
33, 5, Migrain,A mild chest pressure_ thats it!,My migraines started when I was 24_ then one year later I discovered Relpax_ it saved me_ because for that year nothing worked. Some times if I take the pill when the migrain is advanced_ the pain will not go away_ so I take 30mg of ketorolaco and if that doesnt work at night I take 2 tablets of Advil PM_ the next day I feel like nothing happened even if the day before I suffered all the migrain terrible symptoms.,F,33,8  years40mg 1X D,8/15/2013Email,Relpax
34, 5, Chronic Migraines,Numbness in one arm.  Slight dizziness.   A small amount of confusion_ and not being able to think clearly.  BUT_ this was minor compared to the benefit of pain relief from the headache.,I have had migraines since I was in my 20's.  They have increased as I have been going through menopause and after have surgery for Chiari Malformation in Feb of 2012.  In the last three years_ as my hormones have been fluctuating_ I was getting 4-5 intense migraines a week. Not sure if the root issue has been the hormones or the issue with the Chiari.  I have tried everything from occipital nerve blocks_ to facet ablations_ to pain medications ... when finally a friend of mine who gets migraines recommended that I try Relpax.  The first one I took_ at 40 mg gave me some major side effects - like numbness going down one arm which ended me up in the ER to rule out stroke.  My MRI showed all was fine.  Although the headache was GONE within 30 minutes!  This was a huge victory after struggling with intense headaches for a few years.  So_ I read on line to cut back the dosage.  So_ with the next migraine I had_ I broke my pills in 1/2 and it worked wonderfully to get rid of my headache and to minimize the side effects.  The only down side to this for chronic migraine sufferers is that I am only allowed by the doctor and insurance to get 9 pills in a 3 month period.  This is somewhat discouraging when this medication works so well to get you back into the flow of life again!,F,46,3  months40 MG 1X D,8/9/2013Email,Relpax
35, 5, migranes,My arms can barely move very tired but its sooooo worth it when a migrane makes you nausous and can barely lift your head!   I love Relpax its already changed my life.   I have to admit im on a preventative also atenolol 50mg a day which also works great however those make me very sleepy but both much better than migranes!!!,,F,29,2  months50mg?,6/29/2013Email,Relpax

Relpax is the only medicine that has worked for me.  It's been like a miracle drug for me.  Last year_ my neurologist gave me a card from Pfizer that enables me to get my Relpax prescriptions for a $10 co-pay.  It's been a life-saver for me.  You can use this card whether you have insurance or not.  It's called the ""$10 Co-Pay Card.""  Call 1-800-422-5604 to get one.",F,58,6  years40mg 1X D,6/2/2013,Relpax
37, 2, Migraine,Muscle tightness in neck_ shoulders_ jaw_ throat & back; extreme sleepiness; confusion/inability to put thoughts together,I was given samples of several migraine meds as interventions when I get migraines_ thanks to a new dr taking my pain seriously.  I was excited when relpax ended. My severe migraine in less than an hour_ but noticed side effects skyrocketing as the migraine faded. My dr was so concerned by the sleepiness and confusion she crossed Triptans off the treatment list entirely.  (also bad run to imitrex previously.),F,43,1  days40 mg 1X D,5/24/2013Email,Relpax

It helps my vomiting_ nausea does not make me sleepy and is the only drug that I dont need to go to bed for it work. I get migraines with all the symptoms (vomiting_ nausea_ light/noise sensitivity) and nothing BUT Relpax works.  My complaints? If I take the pill when the migraine is too advanced_ I might throw that pill up and have to take another.  Main complaint?

40, 4, Chronic migraines,I get sick in the stomach_ horrible pain in my shoulders_ chest and neck and drowsy. But it does take my headache away 99% of the time. And to be honest I would rather have those side effects than the migraine,,F,35,2  years30 mg,3/28/2013Email,Relpax
41, 3, migraines,Tight throat and chest. Nausea. Achey knee joints. Takes hours to work. Adding in Zofran helps with nausea. Side effects severe enough to only take with my worst migraines. Makes it worse before it makes it better.,,F,33,3  months40 mg,1/15/2013,Relpax
42, 5, Migraines,Extreme tiredness.  I had tried both Imitrex and Frova before Relpax.  Imitrex and Frova did not stop the migraine_ and in most instances I couldn't even keep them down for 15 minutes before vomiting.  Relpax has worked every single time_ with no nausea.  The only side effect is the extreme drowsiness.  Within 20 minutes of taking it_ I have no choice but to sleep.  I could never take it at work or in public.  However_ it is 100% worth it.  My insurance also covers 6 pills a month_ but they aren't happy about it.  I always have to argue with them about it.,,M,34,6  months40 mg,11/8/2012,Relpax
43, 4, Migraine,Extreme pain and tightness in neck_ throat_ chest_ etc.  Makes you wonder if you are having a heart attack.  Some numbness in face.  In extreme cases_ it radiates down to arms_ back_ etc.  Can make me feel light-headed and out of it.,Despite the side effects within the first hour or so_ it does get rid of the migraine.  I think the trick for me is to recognize the migraine is coming and to take the medication sooner rather than later.  It seems to minimize the side effects.,F,49,3  years40 mg 1X D,10/23/2012,Relpax
44, 5, Migraines,The side effect is No Pain...and it lasts longer than most triptans. I can actually have a life and think again.,Finally_ a life saving drug for the hormonally challenged chronic migraineur...Better than Amerge.  Unfortunately_ the drug is not covered by my insurance...and it is SUPER Expensive without insurance. SIGH!,F,54, 40 1X D,9/20/2012Email,Relpax
45, 5, Frequent Migraines,Makes me a bit drowsy and takes a long time to work_ about 2 hours for some reason. It gets rid of my migraine everytime though. Also leaves me a bit dehydrated so I just have to drink lots of water and I'm good!,,F,24,4  months40mg,9/13/2012,Relpax
46, 4, Migraine,Chest tightness_ throat tightness_ sore mouth and throat_ sore glands in neck_ sore scalp when brushing hair. Rebound headaches_ nausea_ bad tummy,Although I get all these horrid side effects_ the Relpax does get rid of the migraine after 1hr. I usually take it before bed so that I sleep through the worst of side effects - but always wake with a sore throat and sometimes sore all over like i am bruised.I can usually get away with taking it once - so much better to have effects for 1 day_ than migraine for 3 days. This last time I had to take it twice and I have had a headache for 4 days now.,F,37,4  months40mg 1X D,8/15/2012,Relpax
47, 5, Migraines.,My midwife prescribed me Relpax when I was 17 & pregnant. It made me drowsy at first so I would take a nap_ wake up_ and my migraine would be gone. After taking it for years the side effect wore off. I have tried everything & this is the only thing that worked:) Also wanted to add took it through all three pregnancies and my kids are as healthy as can be.,,F,23,6  years40MG,8/12/2012,Relpax
48, 1, Migraine,It marginally reduced the pain but left me with a host of side effects which kept me out of work for 2 days so far. Side effects included severe neck pain which radiated down to the lower back and strong nausea. Couldn't eat_ had a hard time drinking fluids and was unable to walk upright due to the pain in the neck and back.,The only reason I took Relpax was that I arrived at my Dr.'s office with a migraine for which I usually take Amerge and have had amazing results with that. Relpax samples were given so I had something to take right away. BIG MISTAKE! I will stick to Amerge for my future needs.,F,52,1  days40 mg 1X D,7/26/2012,Relpax
49, 3, Migraine,Very_ very sleepy after taking this.  It got rid of my headache relatively quickly_ but I felt very out of it.  I think it would be better if I could have laid down and gone to sleep_ but I was at work and could not.  Also got a rebound headache the following morning that was worse than the original headache.  Personally_ Amerge (naratriptan) works better for me.  Less side effects and longer acting.,It works_ but I did not like the side effects.  I'll probably stick to taking Amerge and save this for bad headaches when I need immediate relief.,F,46,1  days40mg 1X D,6/15/2012Email,Relpax

53, 5, Migraine,It am migraine free about 20 minutes after taking it. The drowsiness side effect depends how far into the migraine I take the pill. If I take it at the beginning of symptoms_ I am okay. If I have a fully involved migraine_ I get very groggy and need to sleep. I do experience frequent urination_ which is a blessing and a curse. My migraines are usually triggered by menstrual hormone fluxuations so_ being relived of retained fluid is GREAT! But_ having to get up to go to the bathroom when all you want to do is stay cocooned in a far_ quiet_ cool room and sleep is REALLY annoying.

55, 5, Migraine headaches,At first side effects were tight chest_ tight throat. Overactive glands. Now I seem to take them all too often making me suspect rebound effect. Severe back pains and tension creating headaches. Trying to keep on top of regular exercise and stretching otherwise I am stuck taking relpax daily. When I first started taking them I know my headaches did not come this often.. So watch out! Use sparingly..,I'm glad I have found it even though it's now become a struggle_ at least there is something for the pain.,F,48, 40mg 1X D,3/12/2012,Relpax
56, 5, migraines,After suffering from migraines for years_ countless trips to the doctor and ER_ this is the ONLY drug that works for me.  I've tried it all!  Relpax saves me every_ single time.  Side effects are minor..usually sleepiness and frequent urination for a few hours after taking it.  I also experience rebound headaches_ and take as many as 6-10 of these in a month.  40 mg tablets work perfectly_ and sometimes I take two tylenols at the same time to speed up the relief.  I am so thankful for Relpax and carry one with me at all times.,,F,42,4  years40 mg,2/3/2012Email,Relpax
57, 5, Migraines,Good side effects I felt are: feeling extremely peaceful_ happy and pain free.The only bad side effect I felt was: tight chest and slight difficulty in taking very deep breaths.,I am so glad that my doctor prescribed this!  NOTHING else has ever worked to stop the pain of my migraines.  This doesn't make me feel drugged up like Imitrex and the pain is gone within an hour! Before I started taking Relpax_ a migraine meant 12 - 15 hours in bed in a darkened room enduring pure agony then feeling completely exhausted_ drained and out of it the next day.  Migraines used to steal two days (and on a few occasions 3 days) of my life.  But that won't ever have to happen anymore!

Which basically means addiction_ I finally learned.,I went from taking one relpax every few weeks_ to once a week_ to every 3 days_ over the period of about a year.  I finally realized that it wasn't that my headaches were more frequent_ it was that my brain chemistry was addicted to the relpax.  But whe you have headaches that put you in bed crying and throwing up for nearly 3 days - you will continue to take the Relpax for a long time!  I did anyway.  I finally realized they were really screwing with my whole manner of thinking - and I quit.  Wasn't near as bad as I thought it would be.  I now take Relpax once a month at the most - and reserve them for time I must take them (Out of town_ business trips etc).  I can think more clearly_ and I'm not Constantly coming down from or getting into another headache.  I have also started following the headache diets religiously - which do help.  I used to think they were BS because they were so inconsistent in causing headaches - but after reading a few books I understand the concept of many triggers adding up to push over the migraine threshold.  Anyway - Relpax does cause rebounds BIG TIME.  Know this.,F,51,2  years40mg 1X AN,1/16/2012,Relpax

I sleep through alarms it knocks me out so much. Numb fingers & other areas.

I take 1/2 tablet initially and if no result in 1-1 and 1/2 hrs_ repeat with second half.  Usually 1/2 tablet does the trick.  I don't use a tablet splitter_ just bite it in half_ save the other for later if necessary.  My doctor switched me to Relpax after repeated failure of sumitriptan. I work as pharmacist so leaving work for migraine isn't an option.  This drug enables me to complete a full shift.,M,47,7  years20 to 40mg 4X W,10/4/2011Email,Relpax
62, 2, migraine,I took relpax as a rescue drug for migraine headaches.  It did not help with the headache or the pain.  I was not as concerned with my headache because of the intense throat pain and neck pain that lasted for several days after taking two pills (one Saturday and then one Sunday since my headache was still there).  I would not recommend this pill.,,F,30, 20 1X D,3/25/2011Email,Relpax

The Dr. said it was not a reaction but side effects of the Relpax. I only took one pill and will never take another one. This was my first time using this drug.,My neck became so enlarged that I was unable to remove my necklace that is on an 18' chain and very loose fitting on me.This was my first time taking the Relpax and I will NEVER take it again I would rather lay in bed in pain than have this happen again EVER.

65, 4, Migraines (with and without aura),Tired for a few hours after taking it_ sensitive scalp/hair_ like it had been pulled back too tightly for too long.,It works. Maxalt is my triptan of choice but if I've got a really really bad one (like going blind in an eye or puking my brains out) I'll opt to take a Relpax_ because it works faster and is stronger and knocks just about any migraine out of the water. But_ I get rebound migraines and I will get one after just one Relpax_ so I know if I take one_ I'll have another migraine the next day. It probably won't be as bad as the original migraine but strong enough that I'll need to take a Maxalt to function. Sooo_ if other triptans aren't working for you or just taking the edge off_ trying Relpax is definitely worth a shot.,F,33,1  years40 mg 1X AN,10/7/2010,Relpax

67, 5, Migraines,dry mouth_ sweating,I am in love!  I've been suffering from migraines since two years after my hysterectomy in 2006.I would usually get a migraine once a month- if that.  My husband and I were hit by a semi on 4/28/10 and I took a blow to the head and suffered a concussion. My migraines have increased to about 5 per month ever since.  I have tried Imitrex_ Maxalt_ Zomig_ Frova over the years and they didn't work.  Out of that group- Zomig was the only one that was effective- and that was only when it was paired with a Vicodin + a Flexeril.  The Zomig also took a good hour to kick in.  ALL of the former meds I had tried also had the side effect of making me extremely energetic/alert afterwards for a good 13-15 hours.  If I got a migraine at night- I was guaranteed to be up all night- usually cleaning because I was wide awake. It felt like I had drank 15 cups of coffee w/in an hour. I would be completely exhausted the next day.  One pill of the Relpax in conjunction w/icing my head down kicks the migraine w/in 20 minutes.  No drugged out/groggy feeling afterward.  No extreme energy/alertness. I had the sweats for about 2 hours- and slight dry mouth.  Besides that it is my miracle drug.,F,31,1  days40 mg 1X AN,7/26/2010,Relpax

69, 5, migraines,None!,Relpax is my wonder drug. Almost all of my migraines are knocked out with one pill; occasionally I need two. Relpax has only failed me once: I was in a very smoky restaurant/bar and got a killer migraine the next day. Relpax didn't work_ neither did torodol injections_ I ended up with a demerol injection.

Sometimes a slight tingling.,Have been experiencing migraines for 7 years which have been progressively getting worse over the past 2 years. Would have migraines for at least 10 days in a month. Nothing worked_ took Frova_ Axert nada. Relpax  works wonderfully and I hope it continues to work. Migraines are also less frequent. Now about 2x a month for a few hour each.

72, 5, Migraine,Weepiness and sadness after about 5 hours. It's at the end of the side effect list - it's not you just feeling down about having had a migraine - it really is a side effect! Otherwise_ typical triptan side effects but nothing severe. The usual migraine nausea intensifies for about an hour or two then subsides.,Relpax changed my life. This drug always works for me and allows me to function with a migraine. It's best to lie down for about 2 hours_ but then I can function_ and if I absolutely have to work through it_ I can. The side effects are not nearly as bad as they were with Maxalt or some of the other triptans.  Sometimes_ a really bad migraine will come back after 24 hours_ but taking another Relpax does the trick. I've never had to take it more than twice in 2 days.  The weepiness and fatigue is a totally bearable side effect.  I really appreciate this medication_ and I can't wait until there's a less expensive generic available!,F,36,5  years 1X AN,4/30/2010,Relpax
73, 5, Migraines,Tightness in head & neck - maybe difficulty swallowing - headache sometimes gets worse for an hour or so before going away.  Some fogginess and tiredness but NOTHING in comparison to having a 3 day nightmare.,Have had migraines about twice a month for 30 years - largely hormone related.  They lasted 3 days - and had gotten worse as I got perimenopausal - including 36 hours of severe vomiting and pain - complete incapacitation.  Relpax works great now that I finally learned to take it right away - thanks to lots of your comments - thank you!  I had awful rebounds with imitrex that lasted 6 days - so I was afraid of tryptans.  Now that I pushed past that fear_ and take them right away_ Relpax works within about 2 hours - though it frequently seems to get worse at first.  I am trying to find out what the doseage limits are - if it comes back.  I take about 10 to 12 a month. I have taken 2 pills on occasion initially to get it to really go away - and it would sometimes come back in 24 hours_ but go away if a took a second pill.  Now I've had some where the headache comes back in 8 to 10 hours.  How frequently can we take them?  I hope it doesn't become ineffective with time!

Relpax works very quickly (20-30 minutes on average for me)_ even after onset of a severe migraine.

As expensive as these pills are I hate taking two so I have disciplined myself to take them immediately when I feel the migraine coming on. The only down-side is that the insurance companies limit the number you can get per month and I have to really pay attention to how many I am taking.
