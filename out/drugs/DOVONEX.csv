0, 3, Psoriasis,It will dry out non psoriatic skin apply carefully and over the years I have built up a tolerance as it is not as effective when first used a decade ago,great first topical of choice for new psoriasis sufferers.,M,40,10  years 1X D,8/12/2011,Dovonex
1, 4, moderate psoriasis,slight tingling the first few times i put it on - only been using for 3 weeks so hope no longer term side effects appear,noticed vast improvement in patches even after 2 weeks - hope that his improvement lasts,F,28,3  weeks,10/27/2009,Dovonex
2, 3, Psoriasis,Mild redness and peeling. Takes a while to really work 6-8 weeks for me. Loses effectiveness over the years on it. Still works wonderful on my forehead and scalp.,Now just in cream form. The ointment worked so much better. My doctor had given me a new form of the dovonex with a power steriod - I don't like the fact that it thins your skin in that form. Not really impressed with Dovonex anymore.,M,39,10  years,7/16/2009,Dovonex
3, 2, scalp psoriasis,None,Didn't work other than provide VERY temporary itching relief.,M,35,8  months,1/14/2009,Dovonex
4, 5, severe psoriasis,No side effects,Cleared psoriasis from legs.  Significantly reduced spots on arms_ buttocks and back.,M,583,365  days,7/4/2008,Dovonex
5, 3, Psoriasis,,Had used it for many years (ointment) which is now discontinued. It has been less and less effective over time. Really only works on my scalp now as when it is put on my body it has no effect anymore... Once was a very promising drug.,M,35,9  years,1/16/2008,Dovonex
6, 5, Moderate psoriasis,initial reddening and spread of legion area,This stuff works great for me_ preferred the ointment but they've discontinued it now_ the cream is marginally less effective but it's still very good. 17 years of psoriasis cleared up within weeks_ one of the lucky ones.,M,39,3  months,4/18/2007,Dovonex
7, 3, Severe_ widespread psoriasis,Immune suppression causing numerous chronic infections_ including sinus.  Adrenal suppression (vitamin D *is* a type of steroid_ contrary to popular belief)_ kidney function abnormalities.  Dry mouth_ extreme thirst and urination_ sleeplessness if used at night.,Taking a one week break from this med_ using it once_ not twice per day_ not at night_ can help prevent serious side effects.  It really works best the less of it you apply.  If you can tolerate every other day treatment_ endocrine damage may be reduced or preventable.  Ill effects increase with age and length of usage_ as well as size of area applied to.,F,52,12  years,3/17/2007,Dovonex
8, 5, psoriasis,some skin dryness in sensitive areas,Dovonex takes a few weeks to really start helping.  It keeps my scalp psoriasis clear_ but must be used almost daily. (applied 1x a day)  This seems to be the case with Dovonex in general.  Good for alternating with a steroid to prevent your skin from becoming immune to  to the steroids.,M,41,8  years,2/28/2007,Dovonex
9, 1, Psoriasis,Unsightly peeling skin on my hands_ two months after I stopped taking it for my toes.,One toe was cleared of psoriasis_ so I perservered with the other big toe. It improved.Alas_ the side effects occurred on my hands were minor at first. However_ after taking antibiotics for a cold that would not clear up_ the side effects of hand peeling (which I had seen before) came back with a vengeance after the course of antibiotics finished. No painful yet_ but if it went the way of my feet it would be serious. Worried.,M,54,60  days,3/31/2006Email,Dovonex
10, 3, psoriasis,was told to use the cream in the morning and the ointment at bedtime.  the cream although less greasy seems to work better for me.  the ointment does not work very well.  I also forget to put it on and that is probaby why it is taking some time to clear up.,I really do like this medication much better than the tar based stuff I used in the past.  I have had psoriasis all my life since i was young.,F,33,6  months,4/17/2005Email,Dovonex
