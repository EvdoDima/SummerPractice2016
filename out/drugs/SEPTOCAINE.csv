1, 5, Dental work,Wonderful drug! Doesn't provide the length of relief to me that most patients experience_ but that only means a 2nd or 3rd injection for lengthy procedures when it starts to wear off.,"Before people who have had bad reactions scream ""take it off the market!"" Ask yourself what relief is available to those of us who are allergic to lidocaine!?!?",M,40,1  days4%,6/28/2015,Septocaine
2, 1, Temporary crown placement,Intense pain at injection site (advil helps)_ dizziness_ tremors_ flu-like symptoms_ terrible headache_ neck pain_ intense anxiety.  After 4 day_ there is no improvement.  Can't get any good advice as to how long this will last or if it will get worse.  Terrible drug!,,F,53,1  days? 1X D,11/4/2014Email,Septocaine
3, 1, cosmetic dentistry,injected upward for top incisor work and made my nose first numb_ then painful for two weeks.,My chart said no Sudafed_ ephedrine_ etc. and Septocaine has epinephrine in it.  The next time I was switched to Carbocaine without epinephrine and it wore off several times during the procedure (epinephrine is added to make the effects last longer).  No problem with the Carbocaine though.,F,62,1  daysdon't know 1X D,2/22/2013Email,Septocaine
4, 1, in my dental injection to do crown,SEVERE nerve injury along my jawline for SEVERAL YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (IAN nerve injury) Chronic BURNING PAIN!!!  Debilitating PAIN!!  The needle hit my nerve during the injection and I yelled out.  In addition_ I had painful and swollen glands under my neck for about 6 months.  In the first month_ I also had stiff neck_ heartbeat irregularities_ loss of hearing.  In the first few months my pain was 24/7 and I didn't think I could live the rest of my life in that much pain.,"The FDA needs to immediately take this drug off the market!!  A quick search on google will bring up the study that got it approved through the FDA_ and you'll see how it showed it had almost triple the nerve injury rates from that of the old standard of lidocaine!!!!  Studies also showed that the rates of these injuries rose in Canada and England after the introduction of Septocaine (also called Articaine).  Please also see the tons of people posting online about their injuries from this drug in the popular discussion group online.  Just type in ""oral nerve injury"" on Google and then click on the first or second website that says sciental in it.  Then click on ""Discussion Group"" in the left column_ and then click on the topic ""Injection Nerve Injuries"".  Most of the people with these injuries posting on this board state that they got Septocaine instead of Lidocaine!!!!!  Many are in so much pain that they are discussing suicide!!  Studies also show that i",F,39,1  times,11/1/2007,Septocaine
5, 1, dental anesthetic,Rapid heartbeat_ tremors which began mid-appointment and escalated into severe Parkinson's-like shaking violent and scary enough to send me to the ER in the middle of the night. This went on for 2 days!! until the drug cleared my system.,My dentist at first suspected low blood sugar and gave me juice_ then suggested antihistimine for an allergic reaction - this did not help. The emergency room kept me several hours and sent me home untreated to hope this would eventually go away!!!  This was a nightmare that may have long-lasting neurological effects.,F,53,1  times,10/31/2006,Septocaine

8, 1, small filling replaced in tooth,Everything seemed like a routine trip to the dentist. But once the numbing started to wear off_ pain increased where the needle had been inserted until it was unbearable. Terrific pain in my jaw and the worst headache ever! Migraines are nothing compared to this. I was given Naproxen for the pain and that made the pain somehow tolerable. It took a good month for the pain to go away. Very nasty drug. All this for a small filling that fell out and had to be replaced.,Prior to taking Septocain_ I never had any trouble with medications. Since that time_ I've had a very difficult time with anything doctors try to prescribe. I also have ringing in my left ear and sometimes visual issues. I wonder if it is still in my system.,F,53,1  days,6/7/2005,Septocaine
