0, 3, Gastoesophagitis,Minor headaches. Really bad abdominal pain/cramping. Burning in throat. Insomnia & back pain.,Even though the side effects are bad_ I do feel a lot better than before I started taking this medication. I'm also taking 10mg of omeprazole daily_ the side effects could be from that_ but who knows. I heard it takes a week or two for your body to adjust to medication_ so hopefully over time they subside. Oh yeah. I take the sucralfate 3 times a day_ not 4. I feel like thats too much. I separate each dose by 6 hours.,M,20,2  days1 GM,5/5/2015Email,Sucralfate
1, 3, GERD post-op,Nausea can be intense at times,Every time the anesthesiologist sticks the damn tube down my throat for a surgery_ I have intense pain in the throat for weeks afterwards. Two surgeries ago the doc started me on sucralfate and it eventually takes the pain away but causes waves of nausea. Pain or nausea_ what a choice!,F,32,6  months1 GM 4X D,6/2/2010,Sucralfate
