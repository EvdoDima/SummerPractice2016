0, 2, glaucoma,Extreme sweating in head_ face_ neck_ and chest. Sudden-onset episodes of sweating_ even in cool temperatures. This interfered badly with my sleep.,The med worked very well to control my eye pressure_ but the side effect was debilitating. The sweating did not occur immediately after I started the drug but came on gradually_ and increased in severity. I consulted both my internist and my OBGYN_ both of whom seemed to be assuming this was an effect of old age_ which I must learn to live with. Neither asked about new medications.,F,70,6  months1 drop 2X D,8/23/2012,Phospholine iodide
