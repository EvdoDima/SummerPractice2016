7, 2, Metastatic breast cancer,Fatigue and_ by the time I stopped it_ an almost complete inability to eat or retain what I'd eaten.  I was taking it with epirubicin and cisplatin so I'll put the other side-effects in the first few days after treatment down to them.  But the nausea/loss of appetite went on continuously so was probably the oral Xeloda which was taken continuously.,The combination didn't apparently do me any good anyhow.  Because of this and because my quality of life was so poor_ I gave up the chemo after 3 months rather than doing another 3 months.,F,40,3  months,3/12/2007,Xeloda
8, 2, Advanced metastatic breast cancer,Swelling of abdomen_ slight diarrhoea (stools = always yellow in colour)_ dry and itchy skin_ cystytis.  Exhaustion.,Taken in tablet form twice a day for 2 weeks and then a week's rest.  I found side effects just as bad_ if not worse_ during the week off!  Xeloda is metabolized to fluorouracil in the body.  Exposure to chemo is longer than with intravenous treatment every 3-4 weeks.  Maybe that's why I feel worse than on CMF most of the time.,F,50,2  weeks,10/10/2006Email,Xeloda
