0, 1, seizure control,Fatigue_ somnolence_ unrefreshing sleep_ agitation_ irritation_ anger_ short-term memory loss_ muscular pains_ suicidal thoughts_ Steven Johnsons Syndrome_ cognition issue_ mood swings,This is possibly the worst med I've tried since beginning to address my condition over 41 years ago.  Lack of information identifying the possible impacts resulted in many harmful stressors_ the loss of a position_ extreme difficulty in getting off the med.  I didn't learn about the possible SJS until someone died because of it.,M,50,4  years20 1X D,7/4/2016Email,Onfi
