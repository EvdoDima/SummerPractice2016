19, 1, I will not take prolia,Teeth becoming loose,My father who is 78 has been on Prolia for 18 months and he has always had really good teeth. Within the last 12 months  the dentist has removed 3 teeth due to being loose but no decay. My father was not told of any side effects regarding jaw rot and did not mention he was on Prolia to the dentist. Doctors really need to take the time to explain all the side effects_ especially to the elderly. I myself was diagnosed with osteoporosis in Jan 2016 as I ended up in hospital with 2 compression fractures in my spine. I was told my T score is -5.6. After researching on the net  I decided to keep away from Osteoclast type products like Prolia as long term use can increase the risk of fractures as the bone becomes brittle. I take vitamins D3_ K2_ magnesium_ silica and am on a Osteoblast type medication. The thought of taking Prolia scares me.,F,55,18  months 1X O,4/29/2016Email,Prolia

I also have horrible reactions to most medications. The nurse at my rheumatologist's office couldn't have been nicer. The shot was painless. She allowed me to sit and talk with her until I felt comfortable enough to leave. I was a bit achy the next day_ but nothing that Tylenol didn't help. So far_ so good.

25, 1, ,lightheadedness,I received Prolia for the first time on March 9_ 2016 @ 9 am.  I felt fine all day until about 4pm.  My head felt light and I went to bed.  About 10pm_ I didn't feel any better.  My daughter contacted the Arthritis Doctor.  He suggested I take 2 Caltrate Calcium with Vitamin 3 and to repeat the dosages in the morning and I did.  By morning my head was very light.  My daughter called the doctor and he seemed puzzled and suggested that I have my problem checked out.  I went to ER and had to use a wheelchair to go inside.  After chest X-Ray_ sonogram on my neck_ sonogram of my heart and a MRI of my brain_ all tests were negative.  My lightheadedness and weakness of my legs did not improve.  I remained in the hospital until March 15_ 2016.  The lightheadedness didn't improve until March 22_ 2016.  I saw my Primary Doctor and the Arthritis Doctor on March 21_ 2016.  Neither one did not have any idea as to what was wrong.  I was still using the walker.  The Arthritis Doctor said he  would not recommend Prolia again.  Today_March 27_ 2016_ I able to walk a little without the walker.  I have been exercising my legs and will have physical therapy on Monday_ March 28_ 2016.

27, 1, Osteoporosis,Excruciating pain in lower back and left hip_ pain in left shoulder and eczema  on many parts of my body,After having stomach and back pain while taking Fosamax and then Boniva_ my doctor recommended taking Prolia. She said she had some patients on it and they weren't experiencing any problems. I was very hesitant to take it because of my experiences with the other drugs. Didn't want to have the same side effects and then be stuck with them for six months! So I researched Prolia and read some negative and positive things about it and waited about a year to finally just do it. But guess I'm one of the few who can't tolerate it. I have never ever...even after having 4 children...experienced such excruciating pain!!! After the first shot_ I had slight back pain about 2 months later. After the 2nd one I had slightly more pain. After the 3rd one_ December 3/15_ I had the same pain but for a longer period. But 1 week ago today I was in the most excruciating pain ever_ and have been flat on my back in bed ever since...crawling to the bathroom because it hurts too much to walk! If anyone has any suggestions for how to relieve the pain...other than Advil etc...which doesn't really help...please email me. I am done with any osteoporosis drugs and will figure out a healthier way to strengthen my bones!!!,F,57,1.5  years60mg 1X O,3/11/2016Email,Prolia

35, 1, Osteoporosis,My doc had someone call from his office to try to get me to take prolia. I declined. I believe they are getting kickbacks for recommending this dangerous drug. It's only supposed to be used for people with bone cancer.  Thank you ladies for all of your reviews- you have confirmed my fears and suspicions regarding prolia and the other bone density drugs. They're all dangerous_ have terrible side effects and they don't prevent fractures. Some seem to cause them. No discussion  of what factors are causing my early osteoporosis or alternative safe treatments such as diet_ supplementation_ weight bearing exercise and in my case more testing and starting hrt again. I'm also eating 100g of prunes per day- read the study: the women who ate prunes had increased bone density with no suppression of the bone making process. Supplement vitamin k2 with vitamin D3- k2 makes sure calcium is absorbed into the bones. Get your calcium from food not supplements. Supplement minerals- you need 1part magnesium for 2 parts calcium. Go online and read about alternative treatments for this. Doctors should be ashamed to be poisoning patients with prolia and these other drugs.,I won't be taking it.,F,54,1  days,1/30/2016Email,Prolia
36, 2, Osteoporosis,Within 1 week of my 1st injection I started picking up various viruses after being virus free for the previous year_that along with serious fatigue and flu like symptoms_ and over the followig months-increased lower leg bone pain with weakness. +more,Including one virus in my mouth bringing sensitivity and tissue changes/patches along the side edges of my tongue which freaked the dentist out and almost made me get a biopsy for cancer. Cleared after 3 months_ my tongue remains sensitive. The injection location on my arm stayed red and swollen the same amount of time I had these viruses_ then disappeared. Strep-like. I had in my lifetime a previous bout of Epstein Barr and the theory is the injection lowered my immunity enough to reactivate mono. I am not dissatisfied_ but I cannot take 3 months of that after each injection. Also an unusual finding showed up on my bloodwork about a month after injection_ which was never there before_ called monoclonal gammopathy which can be a precursor to multiple myeloma.  Like others_ I had increased_ significant lower leg pain this year- bone pain. I attributed it to my osteoarthritis_ but I am wondering if the increase in pain and weakness in my legs was caused by the Prolia. I am hesitant to blame Prolia because along with osteoporosis I have Degenerative disease in my spine and other related issues. From reviews on here I expected big spikes in my pre standing pain_ but I only experienced my normal pain except my legs increased.  I have enough issues without new ones_ so after I talked with the dentist (I have some pre standing dental issues) and enough things to focus on wellness already.I will Instead focus on Vitamin D and K2 supplementation along with weight bearing activity,F,56,1  timesStandard i,1/17/2016Email,Prolia

I called his office today after doing extensive research on this drug and canceled my appointment for the injection.  I hate to say it...but I think these doctors are receiving a kick back from the drug companies for having patients taking these horrible drugs.  I'm going to continue taking vitamin ""D"" and calcium supplements and hope for the best.  I'm very active and I feel great now after I stopped the actonel.  I'll never get talked into a medical trap again..",M,63,0  days60mg 1X O,6/8/2015Email,Prolia

67, 1, Osteoporosis,1st injection in July 2014.  Several weeks later I developed severe joint pain. I thought I was having some weird arthritis flare up. I saw my family Dr. He put me on Prednisone.  It worked until it wore off.  Dr prescribed physical therapy. Sorry but you can't make this crap up. Put back on steriods. I unfortunately never connected the Prolia to my condition. It was 3 weeks later. My Dr didn't catch it either.I had my second Prolia injection on January 20_ 2015. On February 2_ 2015 I noticed a dime sized red rash on my knees and elbows. Some had big pustules.  Oddly enough there was no itching and no pain. I still didn't connect to the Prolia.  The pain and extreme joint stiffness would not allow me to get out of bed or walk without assistance. I've had two 10 day courses of Prednesone. I finished the last of it on February 27_ 2015. I am again having symptoms.  The rash has started and the stiffness is roaring backOh_ my Dr said to take motrin and Benadryl. yeah right,Be careful to know all the side effects of this drug.  In many people the symptoms begin weeks after the injection.My Regular Dr finally figured it outThe Endocrinologist that prescribed Prolia never returned my call.,F,70,  2X O,3/5/2015Email,Prolia

69, 1, Osteoporosis,immediately after the Prolia injection (that evening) I started to get jaw pain for about a week. I got the injection on November 18 and on the 23rd I had severe left lower abdominal pain that kept getting worse. On the 25th I was admitted to the hospital with an attack of diverticulitis for 6 days. I knew from a colonoscopy (2013) that I had diverticulitis but had never had an attack. I have been dealing with this daily and just had a CT scan and I see a surgeon tomorrow. Also_ I have more jaw pain for several weeks from a gum infection. Needless to say_ I will not have the 2nd shot and do not recommend this shot if you have any kind of illness.,I trusted my doctor that said it was highly unlikely that I would have side effects_ maybe some red skin blotches_ irritations. Yes_ I was given the literature. Listen to the Prolia commercials and you will hear about the jaw pain and prone to infections.,F,66,1  days2 X year,1/28/2015Email,Prolia
70, 1, Osteoporosis,Immediately after my first dose my lips began to swell. This was followed by rashes that were very inflamed on my face_ eyes and other areas of my body that became progressively worse. I had to be on prednisone for 8 mos. to control it. It took over a year after my first (and only) injection for the symptoms to subside. It is almost 2 years and I still have some lingering symptoms. I would not recommend prolia under any circumstance. It's like playing Russian roulette - you may be fine or you may literally end up going through hell.,,F,58,1  times,1/22/2015Email,Prolia
71, 1, Osteopenia,Itching & sores,After a double mastectomy in 2008_ I began taking Arimidex in 2009.  For years my oncologist wanted me to take a bone-strengthening medication and I refused.  In March 2014_ I gave in to Prolia.  Two weeks after the injection_ I began to itch at my mastectomy scar.  I ignored the itching.  Two weeks later when I removed my bra_ the right side was soaked in pus.  After investigating further_ it appeared to be from the injection.  Meawhile_ the itching spread from my chin to my waist.  Saw a dermatologist who agreed it was the Prolia.  It is now seven months later and I still apply a prescription cream at least twice a day.  The fluid-filled sores were taken care of within two days of using the cream_ but the itching continues with less intensity.  NEVER will I get another injection of Prolia.,F,67,1  times 1X O,11/13/2014,Prolia

Plus_ at three months my hair began to fall out and is is totally ruined now. I have approximately 1/2 left and what is left is porous and straw-like.  I have also experienced very high anxiety.  If you have other health problems_ I do not recommend you take this drug.,This drug actually changes your hormones and 'shuts down' the body's natural sloughing of bone cells.  The idea is to stop the sloughing_ but not the making of new cells.  Anything that works in this manner has got to affect other hormones.  I'm scared of it.  I will NOT do the second shot. The choice is brittle bones and my sanity or stronger bones...maybe....and I die of pacnreatitis or otheer problems.  No thank you.,F,,5  monthsshot 2X O,5/24/2013,Prolia
81, 1, osteoporosis,No negative side effects with first injection.   Side effects with second injection started one week after the injection and lasted about two weeks.   The side effects were heartburn_  vertigo_  blurred vision.  I visited my doctor and ophthalmologist.  I didn't put the side effects together with the Prolia. After the third injection I had heart attack symptoms_  Costochondritis (swelling of rib and sternum)_ pain in limbs.  This is a wicked drug.  My husband finally realized that with each injection the side effects were getting progressively  worse.  It helped the osteoporosis but I will not take any more.  Frankly_  another injection would probably kill me.  I don't know what to do about the osteoporosis.   My doctor is suggesting Evista but the reviews scare me.,,F,55,2  years,4/10/2013Email,Prolia
