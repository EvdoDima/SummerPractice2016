2, 3, Prevent pregnancy,Dizziness_ slight nausea_ migraine headaches w/ aura_ breast tenderness and swelling_ fatigue_ acne,I'm not a huge fan of this birth control_ although it does what I need it to. Usually_ doctors say your body will get used to the birth control pill hormones within 3 months; however_ I have almost every side effect continuously every month. It has done nothing to help with acne (if anything it's only made it worse) and the only reason I'm taking it and not switching brands is to prevent pregnancy.,F,20,8  months30 Mg 1X D,6/7/2016Email,Microgestin fe 1.5/30

6, 1, Did not want to get pregnant & acne,Extreme weight gain_ numbness_ poor circulation in my arms and legs_ fatigue,I gained 14 lbs in 19 days on this pill. I was eating healthy and working out.

8, 5, Pregnancy prevention,Lighter periods_ way less cramping_ PMS has decreased significantly,Began taking this pill three months ago and while taking the first two packs everything was pretty much business as usual. But this month I'm thankful to report a much lighter period_ so light in fact that I don't even have to use a tampon. My moods swings which were always severe are barely noticeable. I'm a little more tired but that's fine- naps can be a good thing:-),F,36,3  months1.5/30,4/26/2015,Microgestin fe 1.5/30
9, 4, Did not want to get pregnant,Possibly decreased sex drive_ not a bad thing though.,I originally got on the pill because I was 18 and had been with my boyfriend for two years and wanted to protect myself against pregnancy. I noticed the pill drastically help my cramps and length of my period. My period used to last 7-10 days and now I lightly bleed for 3-4. I suffered from mood swings (PMS)_ cramps_ and breast tenderness BEFORE I started the pill. I still have light cramps_ my usual mood swings around my period_ and breast tenderness_ so i feel that the pill has not changed anything other than my sex drive. I believe that my sex drive was extremely high_ and I feel that the pill has made it normal. I've been on this pill for over 5 years_ and I plan to be on it until I want a child.,F,23,5  years,1/31/2015,Microgestin fe 1.5/30
10, 3, Irregular period/ weight gain,Nausea after eating_ dizziness_ anxiety_ moodiness,I originally bargain taking this pill to regulate my periods and It worked for that. When I began taking this pill I was 16 and weighed 90lbs. I have since gained 15lbs and am a lot more healthy!

11, 2, Regulate periods,Weight gain_ breakthrough bleeding (Similar to having 2 full periods a month)_ increased anger_ decreased impulse control_ sugar cravings_ heartburn_ swollen ankles (severe during the first pack_ VERY minor by the third)_ feeling faint upon standing (occasionally)_ swelling in fingers (increasingly worse the longer I took it)_ numbness and pain in hands and fingers  (began around the third pack_ also increasingly worse),I hadn't had a period for 6 months before taking the medication - not pregnant. I was happy to start my period again and I would have even put up with 2 a month_ as long as they were regular.  I could have tolerated most of the other side effects too.  However_ the inability to control my behavior_ especially my anger outbursts and wild eating habits made things  rough.  The numbness and pain made me stop. I also experienced unusual hives well into the 3rd pack_ but I do sometimes have allergies so this may or may not have been an actual side effect.,F,35,4  months 1X D,1/11/2015,Microgestin fe 1.5/30
12, 1, having break through bleeding,I have had break through bleeding since the beginning I thinking I have not had any bleeding maybe 2 whole weeks since I started it. I am having cramps and breast tenderness and mood swings I have  called the dr. A few times and they keep telling me it will take time for my body to get use to it. The 16 yrs I have been on birth control pills I have NEVER had to wait for my body to get use to a pill. I don't think this pill is for me at all!,,F,,3  months,12/15/2014,Microgestin fe 1.5/30

20, 1, Hormone supplement,I'm 50 years old and was trying this as recommended by my GYN as a hormone supplement. After the first week I started having cramps. Then_ my mood increasingly went south after that. By the third week I was a basket case with thoughts of suicide_ hating my family_ not wanting to interact with anyone. I finally threw the pills away and started my period yesterday. Since then_ the cramps have been debilitating. I have never had symptoms like this before. Horrible_ horrible pill.,,F,50,18  days 1X D,4/14/2012,Microgestin fe 1.5/30
21, 5, Debilitating PMDD,None,I truly believe these other reviews are inaccurate_ and that the symptoms reported should not necessarily be attributed to the Microgestin.HISTORY: Diagnosed at 18 with panic disorder (incl. frequent panic attacks) and depression. After 8-10 years of behavioral therapy AND varied medication regimens_ my panic disorder was cured and my depression is under control. I began taking Microgestin about 6 or 7 years into my therapy_ and it did NOT cause a relapse or worsen my panic disorder/depression in any way. My mental health progess continued as normally as it would have without Microgestin. ALSO: Microgestin near-immediately eased my severe PMDD of more than 10 yrs. Previously_ I suffered debilitating cramps_ hot/cold flashes_ moderate to severe bloating_ nausea and occasional vomiting_ and drastic mood swings. After 2 months on Microgestin_ the severity decreased by about half; after six months the PMDD was essentially gone.I believe Microgestin *helped* my recovery from depression and panic disorder_ and wish that more people who use it successfully would take time to write positive reviews. It is a low-dose option_ and great for PMDD sufferers. Those with horror stories are likelier to post_ but I think it's unfair to scare others with biased accounts_ and especially irresponsible to blame a medication for symptoms that are likely attributable to something unrelated. Don't self-diagnose! Talk to a doctor.,F,33,6  years 1X D,9/30/2011Email,Microgestin fe 1.5/30
22, 3, Anemia / Birth Control,Nausea_ panic attacks_ paranoia (as in_ anticipation or impending danger_ or feeling like you forgot something important)_ decreased appetite_ weight gain (5 lbs)_ Heavy lethargy_ lack of impulse control_ poor anger management_ irritability_ depression the second week_ acne the second week_ vanishing sex drive_ extreme sugar cravings week two. No period yet_ it was due yesterday.,I recommend Xanax or lots of tea when taking this pill. A gym membership is helpful to keep you calm_ focused and to keep your weight under control. Your significant other will be fed up with you if he is unaware of the side effects.,F,30,15  days1 tablet 1X D,5/14/2011Email,Microgestin fe 1.5/30
23, 3, Contraceptive && Irregular Periods,EXTREME NAUSEA! Weight gain of about 4 pounds. Boyfriend said I've turned into a B-word. So definitely moodiness and depression.,I took this pill when I was 17 and didn't even manage to get through 2 packs because my family and friends made me get off the pill because it seemed to make me so mean and depressed. I've been back on it now for 2 weeks_ and I now remember what the SEVERE NAUSEA was like ): I can barely eat sometimes because of it. I really don't want to get pregnant and I really want to have sex. But I think its making me into a mean hormonal mess and pushing me and my boyfriend apart. I might just have to quit this pill. (again),F,18,2  weeks 1X D,8/20/2010Email,Microgestin fe 1.5/30
24, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Significant weight gain_ increased appetite_ loss of sex drive_ depression,I've been taking these pills for about 2 years and recently my prescription ran out.  It wasn't until then that I realized how awful these pills have been to me.  The minute I stopped taking them my appetite decreased.  My depression also seems different now.  The past two years of my life have been hell due to depression_ anxiety_ and excessive weight gain.  Now I know why.  Bye bye.  I'd rather get pregnant than take these pills again.,F,27,2  years 1X D,6/24/2010Email,Microgestin fe 1.5/30
