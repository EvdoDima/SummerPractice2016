4, 1, Severe hyperacidity/ulcers,The medicine helped a lot to get rid of the ulcers and hyper-acidity issues. But trying to come off has been *hell* Every time I try to cut my dose down from 40 to 20 mg's I have the most excrutiating bone pain! My back_ neck_ knees and hips ache 24/7 until I go back up to 40 mg's. I WISH that the Dr would have warned me that long time use would mess up my acidity levels so badly that I would never be able to come off this medication again.I have had chronic sweating/hot/cold issues for years now. Internet research finally enlightened me that using acid suppressing drugs causes major body temperature issues as well as terrible nightmares (yes_ have had those every night_ never realizing it was the P.P.I. meds causing this.)I feel totally gutted that no Dr ever warned me that to try to come off this drug would be impossible.,,F,56,5  years40 1X D,3/7/2013Email,Pantoprazole sodium
