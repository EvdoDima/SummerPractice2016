0, 5, Back Pain and Fibromyalgia,Some stomach cramping and diarrhea about the 3rd day taking med and then it goes away.,"This med is a wonder drug for my back pain and pain associated with Fybromyalgia.  You take this med once per day and it starts working on about day 4 or 5.  Once it starts working take it for another week and then stop. Your pain will be gone. I only take it when needed.  My stomach could not handle the high mg Ibruprofen and I hate muscle relaxants that make me feel ""drugged"".  This med is great but it does take a few days to start working",F,50,10  years,4/28/2008,Piroxicam
