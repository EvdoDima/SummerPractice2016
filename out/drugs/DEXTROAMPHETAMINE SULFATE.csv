0, 4, ADHD,At first I felt somewhat energized_ but after a couple weeks I felt normal and at ease.,I tried Adderal_ but the Levo-amphetamine made me feel aggressive and made my heart beat fast. I switched to Vyvanse _ but would never feel any real focus_ but felt relaxed and calmer. I then switched to Dexedrine and after trying a couple manufacturers_ Barr/Wilshire and Malinckroft and the Malinckroft brand was very relaxing_ helped focus and anger issues got better. Went from never getting an A in my life_ to getting 5 in my first 2 quarters back to college. I can control my anger much better and will one day learn skills to take the place of the medication_ but the medication has given me an equal dopamine level with everyone else in the world.,M,47,6  months10mg 3X D,8/10/2014,Dextroamphetamine sulfate
1, 5, ADHD,,We have tried ALL the ADHD meds for our 7 year old son and this is the one that has worked the best for him. He has EXTREMELY SEVERE ADHD.  The down side is that he needs to take it 4 times a day and it's a on/off medication.   But I'm very happy with this medication.  He's not a zombie on it and he's a pleasant little boy who is very creative with the medication something he can't do when he's not on medication.  I never knew he loved to draw so much until he started ADHD medication_ he couldn't sit still long enough to enjoy it.  Also he's also safer as well because he's no longer jumping off the dresser onto the bed or from sofa to sofa etc....   Very Happy with this medication and would recommend it to anyone.   It's also a lot cheaper as well_ we have insurance and for his child dose cost less than $20 a month for this medication.   It does take away the appetite for food so we do work hard to make sure he gets enough calories.   And when he's hungry he's hungry !
