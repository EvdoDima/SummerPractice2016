0, 2, High blood pressure,Went years thinking that there were no side effects until I found this Ask a Patient forum and discovered that there were numerous side effects that I had attributed to other factors.   Notable effects have been tingling and numbness in my left fingers and hand. General malaise/fatigue leading to reduced physical activity_ and definite drop in libido.,While this drug did maintain my blood pressure at adequate levels that satisfied the doctor_ and myself_ I was however unaware of the costs my body was having to pay for that 'benefit'. Once I discovered the undesirable side effects_ that were conveniently not brought to my attention_ I determined that I should become proactive in dealing with the root cause of my hypertension_ that being a poor diet and lack of exercise_ and relying on someone else's artificial answer for the high blood pressures that I had brought on myself. A proper diet_ exercise_ and bringing my weight back down to normal levels were all that I needed to do to eliminate the need for the medication that I had been taking for 8 years. I AM NOW FACED WITH A WHOLE NEW SET OF PROBLEMS. What to do with all this new energy and renewed sex drive. I'll gladly settle for resolving those issues.,M,57,8  years5mg 1X D,2/18/2016,Ramipril
