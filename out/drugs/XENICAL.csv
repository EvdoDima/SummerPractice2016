3, 5, Obesity,I started taking Xenical in November_ 2014 with the goal of losing 40 pounds.  I have lost 35 to date.  I have had the usual effects of loose and frequent stools and elimination of oil usually about 48 hours after a high fat meal. Side effects are body doesn't efficiently absorb fat soluble vitamins A_ D_ E and K,I have had no diarrhea or other discomfort with this medication.  I take extra fibre every day (eg. sprinkle some on my cereal in morning) and before bed I take a multi vitamin and extra vitamin D to give my body the vitamins it may not be absorbing during the couple of hours the drug is effective.,F,70, 120 2X D,9/11/2015,Xenical

It is amazing how much oil is in some foods. Butter on toast - no oil ?,I only take one at dinner for a fat blocker. Also when I go out to restaurants.

I have lost weight_ I can feel it_ but not getting on the scales_ going for a walk most days for half hour and have lost some weight! Happy with the xenical_ but you do just need to eat healthy ie lots of salad vegetables & protein with an occasional treat!

27, 3, To lose weight,Orange & oily stool. Oil can sometimes leak when your standing_ etc.,Im only on the first week of taking xenical & Im hoping it is working. I've been watching my diet and I lost almost 5lbs. The only thing I would say about this pill is what you've read already. Its unpleasant when you have use the restroom and oil comes out. I went shopping the other day and felt wet from behind & rushed home to prevent embarassment. Oil comes out even when you pass gas. Wiping w/ tissue alone doesn't remove the oiliness of your butt_ so I would recommend having wet wipes. I usually just take showers after I use the restroom.,F,20,4  days 2X D,10/12/2011Email,Xenical

I have not gained any weight but can eat a bit more.  Only problem I have is that I feel much more hungry now because of the frequent bowel movements that are sometimes 3 times a day.  Then you feel light headed and tired as it wears you out.  I worry that I'm not keeping any good vitamins in my system.  I think it's good for short term use and after you have already been dieting but don't kid yourself_ you will not lose a large amount of weight on this pill and you will be broke.  Buy a pack of and keep them for emergencies only_ like when you had a night of cheating every now and then or if you are going on a trip_ tuck a few in your suitcase.,F,45,1  years30mg 1X D,9/6/2011,Xenical

34, 5, Lose weight,None,I am a healthcare professional. I give out box after box of xenical. I have done masses of training on this medication_ and I will tell you this for fact - THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL GET THE SIDE EFFECTS IS IF YOU DO NOT ADHERE TO THE INSTRUCTIONS! It partly disables an enzyme in your gut called lipase_ which breaks down fat_ so it cannot be broken down and absored. About 30% of your dietry fat will be expelled. There is physically no way you can get such explosive side effects if you adhere to the instructions - there would not be enough fat in your system for this to happen! So take a good hard look at what you have eaten_ every little thing you added to food_ and ask yourself again if you adhered to the fat allowance.,M,27,3  days3 daily 3X D,8/18/2011,Xenical

I was quite nervous about taking xenical because I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. However_ I've had minimal side effects.

I have lost 2.6kg so far but am unsure how much of this is due to Xenical and how much is due to the detox diet I am currently on (Day 3 of detoxing). Lots of gas but no bowel movement at all. Headaches_ but this is due to lack of water and tummy pain which I guess is due to not having a bowel movement for 5 days. I hope this drug helps me lose the additional 20 kgs I'm carrying around.

55, 1, to lose weight,the usual oily discharge_ wind_ tiredness_ bloating,Am very disappointed. Have lost 1kg or 2lb_ and honestly that is probably more like a normal fluctuation than a loss. With the more careful diet I've been on (to avoid the 'explosive nasties') I would have expected to have lost about 4kg anyway even without the Xenical. I think it is making me hang on to the weight. I even jumped up and down on the scales this morning to make sure that they weren't stuck! (and in frustration).

56, 3, To lose Weight,Fatty or oily stool_ Uncontrolled & spontaneous bowel movements_ Increased frequency of bowel movements_ Unexplained rash_ Headaches_ Abdominal pain,In my country_ you don't need any prescription for this drug and you just go to pharmacy and buy it. First started in 2002 and same side effects i mentioned. Till 2006 i took 2 Xenical tablets before meals. It kept me no matter what i eat in same weight that time. But i decided not to use it later because of the warnings of some doctors. After stopping this medicine i started to gain weight and believe or not i put somehow 50 pounds in 3 years time. Then i decided to use Xenical once again_ in fact it did not make me lose weight and side effects came back. Now over a year now_ i use Xenical_ and it don't make me lose weight_ even gained few pounds. I think if u use for the time period_ it helps to stay in same weight. But if you give a break later and restart this medicine_ you don't lose weight at all. Side effects can occur as we all know and no need to mention especially within 1st & 2nd year and lessens afterwards_ but oily thing never goes away. I think it works for not everyone but some and if you stop taking it_ then never ever restart Xenical because it don't help at all. Somehow your body get used to this medicine and restarting it_ don't make you lose weight at all. I understand now.All we need is to reorganize our diet and lose weight. Drugs and all medications is not the answer of weight loss.,M,41,8  years240 2X D,2/20/2010,Xenical
