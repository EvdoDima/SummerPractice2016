3, 5, Obesity,I started taking Xenical in November_ 2014 with the goal of losing 40 pounds.  I have lost 35 to date.  I have had the usual effects of loose and frequent stools and elimination of oil usually about 48 hours after a high fat meal. Side effects are body doesn't efficiently absorb fat soluble vitamins A_ D_ E and K,I have had no diarrhea or other discomfort with this medication.  I take extra fibre every day (eg. sprinkle some on my cereal in morning) and before bed I take a multi vitamin and extra vitamin D to give my body the vitamins it may not be absorbing during the couple of hours the drug is effective.,F,70, 120 2X D,9/11/2015,Xenical

Happy with the xenical_ but you do just need to eat healthy ie lots of salad vegetables & protein with an occasional treat!

27, 3, To lose weight,Orange & oily stool. Oil can sometimes leak when your standing_ etc.,Im only on the first week of taking xenical & Im hoping it is working. I've been watching my diet and I lost almost 5lbs. The only thing I would say about this pill is what you've read already. Its unpleasant when you have use the restroom and oil comes out. I went shopping the other day and felt wet from behind & rushed home to prevent embarassment. Oil comes out even when you pass gas. Wiping w/ tissue alone doesn't remove the oiliness of your butt_ so I would recommend having wet wipes. I usually just take showers after I use the restroom.,F,20,4  days 2X D,10/12/2011Email,Xenical

I have not gained any weight but can eat a bit more.  Only problem I have is that I feel much more hungry now because of the frequent bowel movements that are sometimes 3 times a day.  Then you feel light headed and tired as it wears you out.  I worry that I'm not keeping any good vitamins in my system.  I think it's good for short term use and after you have already been dieting but don't kid yourself_ you will not lose a large amount of weight on this pill and you will be broke.

34, 5, Lose weight,None,I am a healthcare professional. I give out box after box of xenical. I have done masses of training on this medication_ and I will tell you this for fact - THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL GET THE SIDE EFFECTS IS IF YOU DO NOT ADHERE TO THE INSTRUCTIONS! It partly disables an enzyme in your gut called lipase_ which breaks down fat_ so it cannot be broken down and absored. About 30% of your dietry fat will be expelled. There is physically no way you can get such explosive side effects if you adhere to the instructions - there would not be enough fat in your system for this to happen! So take a good hard look at what you have eaten_ every little thing you added to food_ and ask yourself again if you adhered to the fat allowance.,M,27,3  days3 daily 3X D,8/18/2011,Xenical

Headaches_ but this is due to lack of water and tummy pain which I guess is due to not having a bowel movement for 5 days. I hope this drug helps me lose the additional 20 kgs I'm carrying around.

With the more careful diet I've been on (to avoid the 'explosive nasties') I would have expected to have lost about 4kg anyway even without the Xenical. I think it is making me hang on to the weight. I even jumped up and down on the scales this morning to make sure that they weren't stuck! (and in frustration).

56, 3, To lose Weight,Fatty or oily stool_ Uncontrolled & spontaneous bowel movements_ Increased frequency of bowel movements_ Unexplained rash_ Headaches_ Abdominal pain,In my country_ you don't need any prescription for this drug and you just go to pharmacy and buy it. First started in 2002 and same side effects i mentioned. Till 2006 i took 2 Xenical tablets before meals. It kept me no matter what i eat in same weight that time. But i decided not to use it later because of the warnings of some doctors. After stopping this medicine i started to gain weight and believe or not i put somehow 50 pounds in 3 years time. Then i decided to use Xenical once again_ in fact it did not make me lose weight and side effects came back. Now over a year now_ i use Xenical_ and it don't make me lose weight_ even gained few pounds. I think if u use for the time period_ it helps to stay in same weight. But if you give a break later and restart this medicine_ you don't lose weight at all. Side effects can occur as we all know and no need to mention especially within 1st & 2nd year and lessens afterwards_ but oily thing never goes away. I think it works for not everyone but some and if you stop taking it_ then never ever restart Xenical because it don't help at all. Somehow your body get used to this medicine and restarting it_ don't make you lose weight at all. I understand now.All we need is to reorganize our diet and lose weight. Drugs and all medications is not the answer of weight loss.,M,41,8  years240 2X D,2/20/2010,Xenical

65, 5, obese teenager,in the first couple of weeks i didnt get any side effects_ i felt great and completely normal. yesterday was the first time that i had orange_ oily stool. this can be explained though_ because i ate kfc and didnt watch my points that day. it wasnt bad/painful though.,i weighed 120kilos when starting xenical_ honestly it has changed my life. i cant remember a time when i loved shopping_ my body and clothing so much! i wore a size 24-26 for the past year_ which is horrible as a teen in highschool. in just four weeks im now wearing size 18 jeans! big big big improvement_ i cant believe it. i can now also fit into (the biggest size though) of normal clothes_ not pluz size for once! i currenty weigh 112kgs. its great_ i dont feel like a burden to myself_ family or friends. its now october and ill probably stay on xenical until january_ just to get over the xmas period. xenical is great_ i havent had any side effects and it has boosted my fitness_ confidence and ability to love myself.. email me if you wish for any other details.,F,17,4  weeks,9/30/2009Email,Xenical

72, 5, To help me loose weight,The only sideeffects I have experienced are the ones I have asked for by eating too much fatty foods which causes the horrible orange diarreah.,"I started off with ""Alli"" which in Norway has half the amount of orlistat in it. It worked fine so I asked my doctor for a prescription on Xenical.(Which has twice the amount of orlistad and half the prize)  I have no sideeffects of the pill unless I eat too much fatty food. The pill helps me get consious about what I put in my mouth_ and together it has made me loose 1 kg every week so far.I have tried every diet available before this without effect_ but this pill har really helped med loose weight and made me more consious about my intake of food.",F,46,2  months,6/25/2009,Xenical
73, 5, to help me loose weigh,Lot of gas in my stomach. A bit rash on my skin_ But I think Is due to thefact that my body is expeling the fat. Nothing major.,Firts of all I want to say_ I exercise every day. 40 min on the bicycle_ 45 to 1 hour running/walking with the dog and a bit of weigh and sit up. Is hard! Before start xenical I was 81kg. In 3 week`s time I lost 4 kg_ the exercise and xenical together done the job. There is one problem only. Gas in my stomac. When I`m home is fine_ but at work is really unconfortble_ I need to run to the toilet every 30min and hope noone is there. If I don`t go it hurt. I know is not the solution_ but is helping me alot. Once I reach my ideal wiegh I`m gonna stop xenical and keep going with the exercise. I`ve done soo many diet nothig really work_ but since I change my life style (wich was really hard) I`m happy. God I was soo blind b4. I`m healthy now and I`m planning to have a child with my partner and is really imprtant for me to give a good example to my child. I don`t want him to think that be overweigh is ok. I would like to thanks the persnon that invent xenical. Good luck with your weigh loss to all of you. Melissa,F,26,3  weeks,6/13/2009,Xenical

75, 4, Overweight,"Loose oily stools_ only once though when I ate something that didn't agree with ""the plan""",I have been on it for a week and a half and have lost only one pound_ however I am noticing a difference in how my clothing fits_ so I think I am losing inches moreso than poundage.  I did not have any side effects at all except a bit of gas... that was until I made taco's the other night.  I even used 85% lean ground beef AND rinsed it when I strained it to get ALL the excess fat off.  Note to self and others.... taco's even if HOME MADE are NOT a good idea!  I do get the occasional headache here and there more than I usually do but my water intake is not the best_ so I am working on that.  Otherwise I am very happy with the way this drug is helping me learn to eat properly!  If you didn't have the horrible side effects I don't think you'd really see what these foods that are high in fat content really do to your body.

77, 3, Overweight,Can anyone help? Been taking tablets with a low fat diet for 3 days... most people report orange stools or brown oily stools... should i be worried that i am experiencing a quite bright green oily situation? it was a shock! Any advice please?????,Apart from as stated... i feel a little light headed shortly after taking tablets. I haven't felt too hungry either which was a surprise. Not sure that has anything to do with the tablets.,F,30,3  days,5/16/2009,Xenical
78, 3, Weight loss,Headaches_ slightly out of it / lilght headed feeling.,You must eat a low fat diet with this medication (or suffer the consequences of the oily excretions) and drink lots of water - that is why I think I had headaches when I first started taking it.  If you eat a relatively low fat diet your stools will still be a bit oily but not too bad.  A maxipad is a good safety net though.,F,38,6  days,5/13/2009,Xenical
79, 3, Lose weight,No side effects except the normal stated here - e.g. being caught out once (and only once!!!) when I tried to pass wind while not on the toilet.  Worst problem at work was that people kept complaining about the oily residue in the toilet and wanting to know who was leaving it.  Finally resorted to using about a quarter roll of toilet paper to seep up the oil and help it flush away.,"I used Xenical for about 9 months in 2006/2007 and lost 13 kgs. The side effects helped make sure I kept relatively fat free.  In fact_ I had no side effects for the first 2 weeks.  The first time I suffered them was after a night out at a very ""high in fat"" French restaurant resulting in shocking side effects for the next 2 days.  However_ I thought I would mention one other possible long term side effect which might or might not be related to Xenical.  I am post menopausal and recently my Skin Specialist gave me a Vitamin D blood test as it is essential for promoting calcium absorption in your gut.  My reading was sub 40_ which was very low_ but also highly unusual as I get lots and lots of sunshine (I own a farm and work outdoors most of the day without sunscreen!) and also I eat lots of fresh eggs and tinned tuna and salmon.  If anyone should have high D_ I should.  The only thing we can come up with is my 9 months of Xenical which would have inhibited the absorption of vitamin D as it is fat absorbed and Xenical was getting rid of any excess fat I was intaking.  18 months after ceasing Xenical_ I'm now thinking it may still be inhibiting my absorption of vitamin D.  Who knows?  I'm just throwing it out there as a possible side effect and I would suggest post menopausal women who have taken Xenical for a while_ have their vitamin D levels checked to make sure they're OK for absorbing calcium - hopefully to avoid osteoporosis.",F,58,9  months,4/20/2009,Xenical
80, 4, Lose Weight,PLEASE HELP!!!!! I am at 250 and NEED to lose weight NOW due to my health. I have Lupus and a Under Active Thyroid which is fighting against me all together. I have taken Xenical before_ about 7 yrs ago and it worked great then (I lost 30 pds is 2 mths_ very fast). I did eat healthy and drank water in stead of pop_ so that helped out a lot. The oily discharge does come almost everytime you eat and you need to be prepared. Ware heavy pads on your rear end. Because it is only doing its job_ by getting rid of the fat in your body.,I am on a thyroid medicine for my under active thyroid and was told by my doctor not to take the Xenical due to side effects. But I searched on line and ran across a web site that said I could take the two medicines together as long as they are taken 4 hrs apart. Does anyone take thyroid medicine along with Xenical. If so how does it work and have you had any side effects?,F,37,2  months,3/23/2009Email,Xenical

I cant barely wait.,I know the side effects are unappealing and can actually be uncomfortable_ but if you cut a good amount of fat from your diet_ you cant go wrong.

It's simple_ if you eat too much fat you may not make it to the toilet in time.  And it's not like you can eat fat and not take a pill to escape the side effects because it stays in your system for several days.  You can still have a drink because alcohol is sugar_ not fat.

I am really determined to lose the weight and this pill has been a great aid in doing so. Yes_ I have the oily stool but you take the bitter with the sweet you know?~~~,I say to anyone who is serious about losing weight_ this is a wonderful companion to your dedication and willpower because the pill wont work a miracle on it's own_ you have got to change your habits.,F,32,3  months,8/7/2007,Xenical

133, 4, Incentive to eat less high fat food,None to date,2nd comment_ not sure what happened to the first...anyhow...I have read alot about this med and I think it can mean different things to different people. For me_ I am taking it as a deterrence from eating high fat junk food. I have lost 60+ lbs in the past 24 months and stuck at 195 (5'7) due to mental block. I am using Alli (from Costco-150 pills for $66) to help get past this. I do not eat more than 15gm of fat per meal and average 1200-1400 cal's per day. I do not want the gross side effects so as long as I take this med_ 1 or 2 x per day until they are gone_ I will NOT eat high fat food. I will post back and update on occasion. Highly recommend this for people who are already willing to eat less high fat foods in the diet and need extra incentive to not binge. I do not see this med as long term help_ only short term. I don't think there is any cheating either as from what others have posted about eating high fat foods 3 days AFTER not having taken xenical. I think any food eaten in,F,40,5  days,7/3/2007,Xenical
134, 4, Lose weight,Day 2 and no side affects,My stats 5'7_ currently 200 after losing 60+ lbs in 24 months. Weight lost by eating less_ moving more. I am stuck at this weight. Will get to 195_ then sabotage myself and gain back to 200. I decided to try Alli (Xenical) as a tool to get past this mental block. I don't see Alli as a magic pill. I see it as a deterrent from eating high fat foods. If I follow eating small portions and healthy choices_ (keep exercising daily)_ then I will start dropping the weight. BUT_ if I want to start binge eating (emotional eating or boredom eating) on junk food_ I will pay the price physically with the gross side affects. Hence_ the deterrent. I thought I could 'cheat' every once in a while and skip a day_ not taking Alli_ and eat what I want_ but then_ duh_ it hit me...After eating foods lower in fat_ with Alli or not_ if I eat something high in fat and a lot of it_ I am going to get diarrhea because my body is not use to it. So_ when I want to 'cheat'_ I am hoping I can take a bite of bday cake,F,40,2  days,6/30/2007,Xenical

138, 2, Overweight,Oily Gas_ oily stools_ sometime uncontrollable. Swollen hands and joints once I stopped taking it.,Please take caution in reading people's statements about how this drug works_Everyone is NOT the Same. if you are very overweight you may see a loss of 10 pounds or so very quickly but if you are around 20 pounds overweight I wouldnt expect to see much of a loss if any unless you combine it with seriuos dieting and excercise. I took it and went on my way living as usual and saw zero changes. I dont eat totally crappy but I also dont eat that well either. Before i purchased this medicine I was excited to read people saying they lost all this weight but you have to think to youself...how much does this person weigh? 130 pounds or 330 pounds-this will make a difference as far as results. This medicine is very expensive and if you are not willing to COMBINE it with dieting_ dont waste your money.It probably wont work for you-evryone is different.

Haven't seen my period as yet which is wierd because I have all the symptoms of it but it just hasn't come as yet. no appeitite. Scared to eat certain things just by the way they look or smell. i have been eating meat like chicken and stuff but like the rice and pasta_ the starch part I'm just not that interested oin eating. I do pass gas and it is very smelly but I just can't pass and stool. It's Scary. I stopped taking Xenical. I did lose a lil weight but that was because i wasn't eating_ because I was afraid to eat because of the cramps that i got by being on the meds and eating.,Although I stopped taking it_ I'm still constipated and now I'm eating prunes like crazy and taking laxatives. This is the pits beacause I'm four days away from my vacation. I still don't have an appetite and i have serious stomach cramps. I had a friend who started taking Xenical the same time as I  did and she's fine. she's experiecing the normal orange oily poop and bowel movements and has lost 5 pounds and it's goingon her second week. I gave the rest of my Xenical. I just think it's not for me.Because I was so constipated my face borke out in pimples and everything I ate didn't want to stay down.

204, 1, To lose weight,I stopped taking Xenical because it was not causing any weight loss.  I gained weight due to using prednisone_ not because of eating unhealthy food.  My diet wasnt the problem.  3 days after I stopped Xenical_ I went on vacation_ where I decided to treat myself to foods I wouldnt normally eat.  This caused severe diarrhoea_ vomitting and anal leaking of bright yellow oily substance.,If this had happened while I was on Xenical_ and eating this type of food_ it would have been expected.  However_ I had not taken the pill in 3 days_ Vomitting was NOT part of the noted side effect.  I got back from vacation and ended up in the ER.  Both the ER doctors and my Primary Care Doctor agreed that it was Xenical that made me sick.  I then gave a statement to the company that distributes Xenical_ for them to change the packaging to show that sickness can be a side effect even after a few days of not taking this medication.  Apparently the whole point of this 'diet pill' is to make you so sick of the yellow discharge that will leak out of you_ if you eat fatty foods_ that you just won't ever eat them again.  Well_ that's fine in theory_ however_ the pill is NOT supposed to stay in your system for 3 days.  If that were the case_ you wouldnt have to take one with each meal.
