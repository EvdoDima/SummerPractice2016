4, 1, Inner Ear Infection,I was taking Claritin D because I had an inner ear infection causing me dizziness_ naseua_ and many other things. Doctor recommended Claritin D as a decongestant to open up my sinuses and help the ear infection pass quicker. it made my symptoms WORSE. I've been dizzy_ naseuas_ I've had no appetite_ I've been jittery_ my heart is racing_ and my mouth has never been so dry. It has not affected my sleep though_ but it's been annoying to go from feeling better to feeling worse once starting this medication.,,F,20,10  days30Mg,2/8/2016Email,Claritin-d
5, 3, Nasal congestion cant breath,I have been taking claritin for about 10 months.The only side effects I have gotten from this simI have lost my appetite some.It doesn't clear my nasal passages out all the way.If I don't take it I still cant breath.,breathy agree with the other post.There are alot of stupid people out there that had to go and ruin it for alto of people that have to take claritin for allergies.So people like me and everyone else has to sign for it at the pharmacy every 10 days.And you cant even get it the day before.My sister tried to get it the day before and they wouldn't give it to her.She had to wait till the next days far as I know she hasn't had any problems taking the claritin.They need to change the way they sell claritinD.So those that have ruined it for me and everyone else have a much harder time trying to buy it and or cant buy it at all.One of these days they may take claritinD 12 hours and the the other claritind of the market for good Because of those stupid ignorant people that have ruined for everyone.,F,56,10  months5mg,11/4/2015,Claritin-d
6, 3, To stop itching my eczema,Extreme dry mouth _ chills and rapid heart rate.,My Doctor recommend I take Claritin to help with the itch caused by my eczema. While it has stopped the itch  - I'm covered in goosebumps and have to drink about 500L of water to help with the dry mouth - which leads so having to use the washroom ever 20 mins. Not sure its worth the side efforts.,F,28,1  months1 1X W,9/10/2015,Claritin-d
7, 5, Nasal congestion,Slight rise in heart rate.,Great product. My sinuses get really clogged. Sometime the Claritin D doesn't even clear my stuffed up nose all the way. When that happens I eat (2) cloves raw garlic and then I'm 100% again. Try it_ as garlic is the best natural decongestant there is. :),M,50, 12 hr 1X D,8/3/2015Email,Claritin-d

18, 5, Allergies_ extreme sinus congestion,Sleeplessness_ wake up multiple times throughout the night,First off_ I must say Claritin D 24 hr has been a MIRACLE cure for my horrific sinus congestion_ enflamed nasal passages_ relentless sneezing and constantly running nose. Despite the sleeplessness_ I would not give up my Claritin D. To be honest_ I slept horribly without the Claritin D anyway. At least with it I'm able to breathe. My nose is completely clear and it is wonderful to be able to breathe through my nose as if I had no allergies at all. I've been taking the pills at night which may be part of the sleeplessness issue_ so I'm going to try taking it in the morning instead. Regardless_ I absolutely love Claritin D. It's the only allergy medication that truly cures all my symptoms.,F,26,3  days24 hr,3/26/2015,Claritin-d

The thing I hate the most is I can only buy a small amount so I'm constantly at the pharmacy_ I get cut off if I buy too often because some Aholes have to ruin it for everyone & make drugs out of it! Fucking annoying! I have no health insurance so it's costing me a tom also. :(,F,31,3  years,1/6/2015,Claritin-d
27, 1, Clogged Ears_ Allergies,This drug helped somewhat with my congestion and allergies_ and it gave me extra energy.  Unfortunately_ I had difficulty with sleep on this drug_ and then after taking it for about 2.5 weeks_ I became very depressed and unable to control my emotions_ which is very much unlike me.  It took me almost two weeks to start feeling normal again_ and I'm still not sure that I am totally back to myself.,I am sure that not everyone will have the same experience that I did_ but I wouldn't want anyone to risk it.  This was one of the worst experiences of my life.,M,36,17  days 1X D,1/6/2015Email,Claritin-d
28, 5, severe sinus drainage,No side effects.,This is the only medicine that ever works for my severe sinus problems. I take regular Claritin on a daily basis but when I get a cold I get bad drainage that makes me cough and the spit out phlegm. I have anxiety and I feel very calm on this medicine. I hate to say it but you can't take other peoples word on everything. Each person is different. I like to breathe through my nose. Which is impossible without this medicine. I only use it when I get a bad cold or severe drainage that even antibiotics can't get rid of. I highly recommend this product. It works. If you have other problems I'd recommend talking to your Dr first.,F,34,2  years10 ng,12/10/2014Email,Claritin-d

I have been struggling with my throat and sinus issues that even affected my breathing I felt like I was choking for over 1 year multiple doctors_ thought it was Acid Reflux causing issues.   After taking Claritin D  this was the first time in a long time I felt normal again I was so happy.  I wanted to find a post somewhere to let other people that might have same issues.

46, 4, nasal run_ sneezing 27 years,Started taking for a cough with congestion I could not get rid of as a prescription from my dr. Turns out_ the medicine she prescribed was what it had needed for the past 27 years of my life. Cleared up the cough I had for 6 months_ and my nose completely quit running. Yes_ I feel like I'm on speed. I have mild insomnia_ due probably also to my work patterns as well. I do have a bit of appetite loss. And if you don't force yourself to eat_ you will feel the full effect of the speed. And I'm really surprised I had not seen anyone mention an increased sexual appetite_ or pleasure. I would recommend this to anyone with a legitimate reason to take it. Since it is OTC with signature_ it's not for everyone .,,F,28,10  days,9/29/2013,Claritin-d

I had no idea I had been living w such head fog all this time and for the first time my brain felt clear and I was able to to think. I'm not kidding . I also feel like I'm so sharp _ I'm focused and finish my tasks . I also have energy I can clean my house for hours. I got a little worried that this drug is so great . So I asked my ""date "" who is a doctor if this is bad . He told me not to worry abt it but just to know if I stop taking it Iay b more congested for about 2 days until my body adjusts... Oh so I love this magic pill.... I just say take it if u need it don't take it for other reasons .... And yes it curves appetite but I remind myself to eat my 3 meals bc I believe if u don't eat at all it can't be good And it can slow ur metabolism so they day u stop taking the pill a d u get hungry again and start eating  u will gain weight faster. So I eat but healthy bc due to the pill I don't feel like having big meals. I have lost abt  5 pounds ..",,F,34,1  months240 mg,6/29/2013Email,Claritin-d

On the fourth day I had another_ this time it had no affect on my allergies. After I got home from school I was suffering so I took another. Within a hour or so I started to feel the anxiety I've had for the last 2 days get unbearable_ I was having suicidal thoughts.

I actually feel tired now if I don't take it. I think you just get use to it and the harsher side effects subside. Never had a problem with my sex life or any nose bleeds.

I have never suffered from anxiety before_ but this made me realize how bad it must be for people who do.  The anxiety made me so depressed that I even had some suicidal thoughts.  It took my wife to figure out that it was the medication as I was too wrapped up in anxiety and lack of sleep in the medication to figure it out.  I stopped taking it and after the dose wore off began to immediately feel like myself again. Due to this experience I personally think that anything containing pseudoephedrine should only be available by prescription.  If you have any of these issues stop taking it immediately.,M,37,7  days 1X D,8/10/2012Email,Claritin-d

Dry mouth (and skin!) is the only side effect I've noticed. Haven't had any experience with insomnia or anxiety. If anything I'm sleeping like a rock_ but that could just be because now I can BREATHE. I don't think I'll take this year-round.

After a colleague told me he experienced similar issues I stopped taking and had no problems sleeping after a couple of days. I was recently at the doctor and mentioned this to her. She indicated this is a common problem and recommended I try the 12 hour version_ taking it early in the AM so it should be out of my system by bedtime_ however after the second day_ here I am wide awake again when I need to be sleeping. I will not take any more. Although Claritan D works great in alleving my allergy symptoms_ the insomnia is not worth it!

I either take this and deal with a few side effects_ otherwise I have sinusitus_ chronic_ and recurrent.  It is frustrating_ but don't know what else to do.,M,36,14  years10mg/240mg 1X D,10/1/2011,Claritin-d
65, 2, Severe year round allergies,Loss of appetite(not consistent enough to be sure if its the drug or lack of effectiveness of drug)_ severe insomnia_ dry mouth.,Yes I have been taking this drug since I was about 10_ and I do know the box says you should be 12. That said. I used to work pretty good for me. I would take this and Pseudoephedrine together. After a few years neither really did much for me_ though. So I stopped both_ and started 2 prescription drugs instead. I would use Claritin-D 12hr occasionally(when I ran out of the scripts and had forgot to call them in) for short bits. All it really did though was keep my body from completely spazzing out. Recently(last month or so) I have no longer had either of my prescriptions so I went back to Claritin-D 12hr. I still experienced severe pressure in my head and bad nasal drainage. However_ it mostly kept my eyes from itching_ my nose ran a bit less_ and prevented my mouth/lips from itching and breaking out. So it was better then nothing_ but not great. Defiantly not a long term solution.,F,19,9  years 2X D,9/20/2011Email,Claritin-d

68, 5, Severe Allergies,Weight Loss_ no appetite_ tremors_ insomnia for the first few days_ dehydrated_ dry mouth,I have been taking Claratin D every spring for the past eight years.  This is the only medicine that makes my severe allergy related nasal congestion go away.  Although the side effects are not fun_ they are only really bad for about the first week.  Once my body gets used to the medicine being in my system_ I am completely fine.  I always drink extra water because I know the medicine makes me dehydrated.

The plain Clariton makes me sleepy_ although not as much as benedryl_ and I have all the same side effects except the agitation and anxiety. Sometimes the anxiety is a bit over the top.

I've been waking up between 4:23am and 6am EVERYDAY for the past week and cant get back to sleep it's horrible I figured something was wrong with me until I started reading about everyone else's side effects they had! I don't recommend taking either drug...see your doctor first...I'll keep benadryl once I detox my body for a few days of no allergy medications_ it'll suck but if it fixes my sleep issue so be it I'll take congestion over 3 hours of sleep every day!,M,22,5  days240 1X D,5/16/2011,Claritin-d

TKO of all allergy symptoms which is why I keep taking it; however_ the side effects are extremely bothersome. For the past week_ I've been taking half of a tablet - this seems to help lessen the severity of the side effects.

82, 1, allergy control,numbness in fingers and toes_ pain in joints_ irritability_ urinary problems_ hair loss,My neighbor mentioned to me she had finger numbness and bruising when using Claritin 24.  It went away when her physician took her off of it. I too had pain_ numbness and swelling (no bruising) which started after a few months of use.  After talking with her_ I discontinued use five days ago and these problems are gone.  I also now realize I was terribly angry_ had negative thoughts and was irritable all the time (as my wife continually told me). These thoughts and actions appear to have vanished.  I also had problems urinating and this problem seems to have subsided somewhat. I hope no damage was done and that this problem also totally disappears.  I also experienced hair loss on my arms and legs this past year and hope some will grow back.  I assumed that all these problems were due to old age as they  gradually crept up on me this past year.  In fact most (if not all) were related to this product.  Unbelievable that the manufacturer gets away without mentioning all these side effects. I also heard this week that researchers on this drug were surprised that it was even approved.

I have been technically awake all day and have had several shots of espresso as well_ but I am so tired that I am struggling to stay awake as I write this at 8pm!  Claritin-D has been the only allergy pill that has ever worked for me and it's worked its magic this time_ but I just want to take a nap!,Something in the formula for Claritin has changed for sure and I am positive on this.

They have never caused anosmia.,I am a Physician and would recommend this product with reservations and recommend the patient read the side effects carefully.

If taken after 6pm I often have trouble falling asleep. Dryness_ but after all the point of the drug is to dry your body out. Sometimes I feel slightly ""out of body""_ as if my head is floating above my shoulders.",This drug works for me without uncomfortable side effects. Sometimes I take it for the side effect of concentration; it makes work go by much faster. When taking it you must DRINK PLENTY OF WATER (20oz.+ per hour_ but stop short of over-hydration which is dangerous) otherwise you will become dehydrated quickly and suffer effects related to that. I believe many of people's ill side effects are a result of improper hydration that is exasperated by the drug. Though_ I personally know many people who fall asleep within minutes of taking this drug. It's definitely not for everyone_ so if you're a first time user take it in a controlled environment where you don't need to drive_ can sleep if you need to_ and have access to water.,M,23,2  years24 hr 1X D,9/10/2010,Claritin-d

I am laid off & it doesn't look so good when you can't fill out an application in front of an employer.

113, 2, Spring allergies,I could not stay asleep. I was jumped right out of bed in the morning despite my lack of sleep. I am not hungry and find it hard to eat food even though I know I should. I have a disconnected feeling from myself similar to a tipsy_ not drunk_ feeling. I have to urinate more then usual. My mouth_ lips and nose are dry but that is most likely due to the Pseudoephedrine.,This medication did not make me feel completely better as far as the allergies. I would say that I feel maybe 50% better because I can breath but my nose is still a bit drippy. The side effects more then account for the 50% better so I will not be taking any more of this drug. However_ for someone else this drug may work great. It would probably also make a great diet pill since I have no desire to eat.,F,28,2  days240mg/10mg 1X D,4/14/2010,Claritin-d
114, 4, allergies,Insomnia,I was looking for a website to determine if the 24hr. Claritin-D I was taking could cause insomnia. Looks like others are having the issue as well.

Just thought I would try again as I was getting sinus headaches and lots of pressure in my sinus cavities.  Something obvioulsy changed since I took the medication last_ but may GOD have mercy on you if you take this and experience the side effects.

Ironically_ even though it causes drowsiness_ it also causes insomnia so I would advise to take it as early in the day as you can.,I find that is works great initially but the side effects are so strong for me that I can only take it once a week and hope that carries me through until I can take it again.,F,36,8  years5 mg 1X W,2/7/2010,Claritin-d

I have since used it for all allergic reactions (and usually only take it for one or a few days--until symptoms subside). I expected it to affect my sleep and I immediately realized it caused dry mouth but I only just connected it to these out-of-nowhere muscle aches. I will definitely asked my doc for something else.,F,30,1  days,12/26/2009,Claritin-d

I have been taking regular Claritin for many years without side effects but I thought the ""D"" would reduce the pressure I was still experiencing after a sinus infection. I have completed  two series of antibiotics and although I have many allergies to drugs_ I never thought I would have a problem.

I am returning the package to the store tomorrow.  I would not recommend this drug at all.  They keep it behind the register here in MA b/c people use it to make meth.

I'm assuming how I felt around hour 23 is similar to what it feels like to come down from meth.  I will NEVER take this drug again and am so glad I found this forum before I took a second dose.  I would much rather have congestion and sneezing than feel like a crack head.  I took 1 pill at  5 pm on Wednesday- it's now Saturday morning at 3:30 am and I can't sleep.  My joints and lower back are still killing me_ too.  This crap is pure evil- you'd think after two and half days_ it would be out of my system.

133, 3, Seasonal allergies,Constipation_ dry mouth_ some insomnia. frequent urination.,I had really bad allergies this year. I took the 24 hour Claritin for about a week.  The drug cleared my sinuses up almost immediately. I had some insomnia the first few nights_ but it went away. The constipation was the worst! I would go several days between a good bowel movement. Yet_ because of all the water I drank to get my bowels moving_ I had to go to the bathroom and urinate all the time.  Regardless_ my mouth was constantly dry despite drinking excess water. Lip balm helped.Had I known about the constipation issue before_ I would've had some prune juice or mineral oil. But it did take care of the allergies_ though.,M,32,8  days,10/9/2009,Claritin-d

135, 1, nasal congestion,extreme dry mouth_ thirst_ anxiety_ extreme sweating_ frequent urination_ jitters/nervousness_ loss of appetite_ depression_ feeling hot,I tried 24-hr Claritin-D only 3 times.  I took the whole pill once the first day.  It worked great that first day_ clearing up my nasal congestion and allergies completely and I felt great because I could finally breathe out of my nose.  But I also had a ton of sweating (I mean a lot) and increased thirst.  I was really jittery_ but not anxious or nervous.  I felt sort of buzzed like I had drank a ton of energy drinks / caffeine.  The second day I tried only half the pill_ hoping it would reduce the side effects_ but I felt just as bad and my nasal congestion didn't clear up as well.  I figured maybe it will go away eventually.  So I tried a third day of half the pill_ which was yesterday.  I just woke up at 3am_ and I felt extremely_ hot_ extremely thirsty and just could not sleep.  I was tossing and turning probably since 2am.  It's 4:30am now as I write this_ and I feel terrible.  For most of yesterday I felt like a nervous wreck_ and I was very depressed.  I even had a few bouts of anxiety_ which is not like me at all.  I also lost my appetite and was oddly not hungry for most of the last few days.  I only ate a few meals_ and I'm not sure if I've lost weight.  A few people told me I looked really tired.I will never ever touch Claritin-D again.  I'm guessing it's because of the high pseudoephedrine content_ which I will never touch either.  The negatives far outweigh the benefits.  I can't wait for this stuff to get out of my system.,M,25,3  days,10/3/2009,Claritin-d
136, 2, hay fever_ cats_ dust etc.,I took Claritin-D for a while regularly (at least a year) and though I never really noticed any intense immediate side effects_ over time I began to realize that my heart rate was elevated and intensified_ though I never linked this to the drug. However_ about a month ago I stopped taking Claritin because of technicalities (apparently you need a prescription in Oregon) and I noticed that my heart rate was much more normal (going from about 90 while on Claritin-D to around 60). I'm fairly certain that my blood pressure as well has decreased as I've begun to experience headrushes when standing up etc. Today I took Claritin-D for the first time in a while because my allergies are acting up and I managed to get a prescription and since yesterday my heart rate has increased considerably. Though it does wonders on my allergies_ it is disturbing that it should affect my heart rate in this way and I think I am going to stop using the drug.,,M,18,2  years,10/2/2009,Claritin-d

I took it again this morning because it helped my allergies and the side effects are way worse! My eyes can hardly focus on anything_ everytime I stand up I blackout and my vision feels crosseyed. My head feels very allert and really fuzzy. I have also felt sick to my stomach and had back pain.,I would NOT suggest anyone take Claritin-D or the generic version!

145, 3, Loss of libido_ nose bleed_ problem,To help my allergic reactions to oak and pine pollen in FL I saw my family doctor in March and the doctor recommended that I take CLARITIN-D-24 daily until mid Sept.  The drug worked_ no allergic issues with the pollen in my area_ no congestion life was good.  But_ I noticed problems urinating_ my sex drive was not like it was and I had a nose bleed during sex which was down right scary..  Late July I went to see a Urologist and of course listed CLARITIN-24 as the medication I was taking... They drew blood to test for cancer_ did the exam of the prostrate_ uroflow test..... The doctor then commented about drug interactions... CLARITIN D-24 can impact the prostrate cancer test and it care impact urine flow and it can cause with freq use cause the blood vessels or linings in your sinus area's to be weak and if your excited_ blood pressure is raising those small blood vessles in the nose could bleed.,I have since at my urologist suggestion stopped taking CLARITIN D -24 and it's has been 2 weeks and my sleep is back to normal_ no problems urinating my prostrate cancer test came back normal and my sex drive is back to normal...

However_ when class ended for the day_ I really began to notice the side-effects. If you like coffee_ save it for another day when you are not taking Claritin-D... At one point I had alomost convinced myself that I needed to see a psychiatrist... I cannot believe this product is allowed otc by the FDA.

While on the med I had poor sleep and never linked it to Claritin-D. I couldn't take the 12 hour because it kept me awake_ not sure why I didn't think the 24hr one was affecting me.  So I had another reason to stop. I itched for weeks after stopping. When I went to the gym and got hot and sweaty-the itching was so intense I thought I was going to die. I wondered if this was how meth addicts felt and understood why they would try and cut their nose off to stop the itching.,Be aware before taking this drug that stopping is hard and has side effects.

Also_ my boyfriend has noticed that I've been very irritable and aggressive lately and that is very unlike me.,I would recommend finding alternative medication.

I would recommend everyone stay away from this product and find something else. I will never put this in my body again and the company should be held accountable for how horrible these side effects are.  I feel like a completely normal person since I have stopped taking this.

A cloudy_ almost high feeling.,This prodoct worked ok for my allergies_ which were pretty sever.  Had a sore throat_ conjested sinus and runny nose.  It dried out my sinus and got rid of the sore throat.  Still have to blow my nose every once and a while but its not running.     I started out taking Claritin D-12hr when my seasonal allergies started up.  I took it for 4 days.  During this time_ it reduced the severity of my allergies.  I also lost 4 lbs_ loss of appetite and had a constant cloudy_ almost high feeling.     I switched to the Claritin D-24hr when I ran out of the 12hr.  I immediately noticed a increase in irritability and feelings of aggressiveness.  I'm on the 3rd day of feeling like this_ so I think I'm gonna stop taking the Claritin D-24hr.Seems kinda odd that the 24hr and 12hr would affect me differently_ but thats what I experienced.,M,32,7  days,5/18/2009Email,Claritin-d

164, 1, Recommended by doctor for congestio,I took Claratin D-24 for 4 days. By day 3_ general lethargy_reflexive coughing_ and mild insomnia. By day 4_ pinkeye_ drowsiness_ constricted breathing in addition to day 3 symptoms. When i stopped_ symptoms begin to clear @ 24 hrs. after the last dose.,I was diagnosed as having a cold; the Claratin D was supposed to clear up my nasal congestion.  Instead_ it made me feel worse.,F,53,4  days,5/5/2009,Claritin-d

167, 4, Very bad allergies,I took this medication for a few months about a year ago and had no side effects. But I have started it again 3 days ago. The first night I only got half an hour of sleep(but I also drank a soda about an hour before bed that night). The second night I was restless and woke up it seemed every time my boyfriend rolled over in bed. It's the third night and I slept soundly for about 4 hours before I woke up. After an hour and a half of trying to sleep again I gave up.,I am very tired right now_ but besides the insomnia this medication has done wonders. I would like to say the benefits out way the side effects for me_ but I'm sure if this continues after about a week I'll be delusional from the lack of sleep. On the positive side though_ without it I suffered from horrible sinus headaches_ stuffy nose and runny nose_ sore throat_ itchy and water eyes as well as back and neck aches. This medication has done wonders for those_ and every other medication that helped my allergies made me so drowsy that I almost got fired once because my boss thought I was on drugs. I will try to take the medication on a different time of day and if that doesn't work I will switch to the 12 hour.,F,19,3  days,4/27/2009,Claritin-d
168, 1, Sinus congestion,Sweating_ anxiety_ heart palpitations_ dry sore throat that feels restricting_ sleeplessness.,Didn't help my sinus congestion at all. I only took this pill for 2 days_ the 24 hour Claritin D and I can't wait for 3 pm to roll around so that it can get out of my system. I will never take this pill again!,F,44,2  days,4/27/2009Email,Claritin-d
169, 4, Allergies,Way over-stimulated.  Totally focused on my job which was my first clue this drug is working overtime!  Helped with the symptoms of stuffiness_ sneezing_ and morning headaches from those clogged up allergy season nights.  I think I will stick with Claritin without D as this helped too but not as strong.,I had a hard time trying to purchase this med at my local drug store.  They asked me to sign and for my driver's license.  The guy next to me with the beer got in and out faster than I did!,F,52,1  days,4/24/2009,Claritin-d
170, 2, Post Nasal Drip / Allergies,headache_ light headed and dizzy_ detached awareness_ lethargic_ nausea,Helps my allergies only a bit.

Ehh_ took the 24 dose and want it out of my system NOW!,F,25,1  days,4/20/2009,Claritin-d
171, 2, watery eyes_ sneesing and bad sinus,extremely bad headaches (like a heartbeat)_ high blood pressure_ slight fever_ jittery_ and trouble sleeping,My sinuses somewhat cleared after a couple days but for what its worth i would have rather of not taken it and just took some benadryl. I felt worse and got more symptoms from taking it then it helping me. My blood pressure is so bad I started seeing stars and got light headed and I am in really good cardio shape.,M,28,2  days,4/15/2009,Claritin-d
172, 1, Seasonal allergies,Seriously sore jaw_ just throbbing pain which is easily the worst side effect for me_ although the sinus headache and intermittent nausea run a close 2nd  & 3rd. This drug (I made the mistake of taking the 24-hour dose) did absolutely nothing for my allergies - I still have the runny nose and sore throat - and the side effects are making me feel like a speed freak. I took the pill at 11 AM_ it's now 8:40PM - tomorrow morning can't come soon enough.,Based on this experience_ I cannot recommend the 24-hour Claritin-D. Try something else!,M,31,1  days,4/14/2009,Claritin-d
173, 4, allergies,The first day I took it_ I noticed how tired and annoyed I felt_ but it helped my allergies.

I worry about the long term side effects of this medicine and will only take it when absolutely necessary.,,F,26,7  days,4/13/2009,Claritin-d
174, 4, Allergy,Jitters_ sleeplessness,I've had severe allergies all my life. I've now been taking shots for over 4 years and it's helped emensely. I've tried virtually all over the counter meds plus some perscription meds and Claritin D is the only thing that's ever helped me. The side effects are minimal compared to the benefits. Seems like I really only need to take it once in a while because the shots have cleared up most of my problems.,M,54,2  years,4/12/2009,Claritin-d
175, 5, allergies,Try the Claritin D 12 hour!  It worked best for my allergies out of any other allergy pill. I also seemed to lose weight when I was on it; I think it curbed my appetite.  THe Claritin 24 hour is horrible. I felt anxious_ jittery_ paranoid_ and did not sleep at all the days I took it.,,F,25,3  months,4/10/2009,Claritin-d
176, 1, sinus/headache/congestion,Not sleeping at all_ jittery_ depressed_ no appetite_ really painful leg and feet cramps.  I have only taken this for about 6 days and I will not continue. It does help with the sinus congestion a lot_ but I actually have a sore throat now and gravelly voice.,My pharmacist recommended this_ but my doctor had recommended Benadryl.  I am going to try that_ since I believe it is the sudafed in Claritin that is messing everyone up.  Very powerful drug.,F,51,6  days,4/2/2009,Claritin-d
177, 3, sinus infections and fogginess,high blood pressure for the first time after taking it for a year.,Works great on my allergies and sinus problems but definetly makes me jittery and now I've developed high blood pressure and I'm in great shape.

181, 5, I have terrible allergies.,"I have never had any bad side effects from taking Claritin-D. However_ my blood-pressure does go up everytime I have to show my Drivers License and sign for ""allergy medication"". Why_ so the Gov't can keep track of how many times I blow my nose?  What a joke!!!",For all you people who can't handle CLARITIN-D - please_ stay away from ALL allergy medications before you mess it up for the rest of us!!!,F,54,10  years,3/11/2009,Claritin-d
182, 3, spring sinus allergies/hay fever,Dry mouth and throat_ dehydration_ skin rash.,While it was awesome for treating and preventing my sinus allergies_ while taking Claritin-D my mouth and throat were so dry and I was so dehydrated that I literally had trouble speaking!  My throat was terribly sore and I couldn't believe how thirsty I was (my water consumption doubled).  All of this was tolerable_ until I woke up in the middle of the night after having taken the medication for about 5 days with several patches of an itchy rash on my shoulders and neck.  The next day I didn't take the Claritin-D_ a good bit of the rash faded_ but one spot would not fade until I stopped taking the medication and slathered it with hydrocortisone.All in all_ it worked great_ even with the dry mouth and sore throat_ but the skin rash kinda scared me so I stopped taking it.,F,23,7  days,3/11/2009,Claritin-d
183, 1, allergies_ with headache and stuffy,I am so glad I found this web site_ because I thought I was going nuts. I have been so sick_ took this medicine for 3-4 days_ I have been having horrible nausea_ then today on the 4th days_ gagging_ vomiting_ I slept last night but woke up every one or two hours_ felt good in the morning unitl I try to eat or drink_ and forget about your morning cofee_ also feel lethargic_ and removed from life taking this. I have no energy either.,I couldn't go to work because of the side effects of this medication_ I am definelty going back to regular clartin_ and just Mucinex_ and maybe Tylenol Sinus.  The side efeects are not worth it..,F,38,4  days,3/10/2009,Claritin-d
184, 3, seasonal allergy symptoms,alternating chills and hot flashes_ dry mouth_ nausea and stomach cramps,My waterey eyes and congestion are gone completely. So I'm impressed with that. But I keep alternating between being hot and cold. My LEGS sweat! What's that about? Then these chills and goose bumps.  Weird. Then late this evening I started feeling sick to my stomach. I took the 12 hour one. After reading the other comments I am very glad that I took it early this afternoon. Hopefully I won't have insomnia. I've actually had a couple of short naps today. Perhaps it made me drowsey. Although I'm glad for the relief of my symptoms_ I will only take this again if I am desperate.,F,38,1  days,3/8/2009,Claritin-d
185, 1, Congestion_ sinus pressure,Insomnia (I took it at bedtime with the hopes it would decongest me and enable me to sleep better - should have read this board first - went to bed at 10pm and was/am wide awake at 1am); throat extremely tight (felt like I was having a panic attack); anxiety; nervousness; bloating; thirst,My sinuses defintely cleared up_ so I suppose I give Claritin D credit for doing what it's supposed to do.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone due to the side effects_ though.  I'm wide awake now in the middle of the night_ panicky and alternating between hot and cold spells.  I'm a very healthy person who has never had sleep problems and doesn't take any regular medication_ and this drug is making me feel pretty crazy.  The closest thing I liken my current side effect symptoms to is when I took diet pills w/ Ephedra in college and had panic attacks.  The pills worked_ but it wasn't worth the side effects.,F,28,1  days,2/13/2009,Claritin-d
186, 5, for severe sinus pressure,i felt alert .. i take the claritin 12-hour when i need to.,i'm sorry to hear about all these negative side effects from the others.. i use this in conjunction with a saline nasal spray and they work wonders combined.  i have to say this is the ONLY medicine that helps my sinus pressure.  thank goodness for claritin d-12 !,F,41,14  days,2/10/2009,Claritin-d
187, 5, year round allergies,back pain_ urinary infections_ insominia_ irritability_ costipation,I could not live with out this medicine. Side effects are bad but the alternative is worse. We moved across country 4 years ago because the doctors had done as much as they could for me. I had hoped I could stop taking this but my minor allergies are still bad enough to have to take it. I would sleep 24 hours aday with out it. If I still lived back east I would be in the hospital.,F,43,9  years,2/10/2009Email,Claritin-d

It is now 3AM and I cannot sleep.  Having terrible insomnia and feeling jittery.  Earlier tonight I had very little appetite at supper time.  This afternoon I felt significant anger/rage and threw a temper tantrum at work.  I will NOT take this medicine again.  It is definitely not worth it.  Particularly the inability to sleep.,,M,41,1  days,1/3/2009,Claritin-d
190, 5, Allergies Took Claritin D 12 HOUR,Extra energy_ less appetite_ good for allergy symptomsHIGHLY RECOMMEND THE 12 HOUR VERSION NOT THE 24 HOUR,MY ADVICE IS FOR ALL OF YOU WHO COULDNT SLEEP - TRY THE 12 HOUR VERSION AND TAKE IT IN THE MORNING.I have the same problem with the 24 hour formula but the 12 hour wears off during the day and then you can sleep better. I LOVE this stuff_ it clears me up and gives me energy. But not too much. THe 12 hour is a little less potent.,F,31,4  years,12/25/2008Email,Claritin-d
191, 1, Sinus Infection/Headaches,Claritin-D Non-Drowsy 12 hour pills are an oxymoron. Please do not use this product. The first day_ was fine_ then I experienced extreme and unusual fatigue_ dizzy spells_ loss of appetite_ very drowsy all day_ but sleepless at night (would sleep 2 hours a night) Bad dreams_ blurred vision_ anxiety_ panic attacks waking me out of sleep_ lightheadedness. I became antisocial and angry over the 5 day period of taking the tablet! I didn't take my 2nd dosage this afternoon_ and I feel 80% better at 10:00 P.M,This drug is scary. I thought that I was still suffering Sinus Infection symptoms_ but turns out the side effects of this drug are way more dramatic then any sinus problems.,F,28,5  days,11/24/2008,Claritin-d

194, 3, Sinus pressure,Increased thirst_ dry mouth_ insomnia_ extreme need to get things done_ wide-eyed_ chills up and down my body (but not horrible)_ determination_ extreme decrease in appetite.,About 30 minutes after I took it_ I felt so much better.  But about 4 hours later_ I was like a crazed woman.  The first mistake was taking it at 7pm - I didn't go to sleep until 6am and only slept 3 hours.  I woke up and was completely awake and not at all tired.  It has been almost 24 hours since I took it and I'm still in a weird determined state where I think I need to get things done.  I still feel really wide-eyed and not hungry at all.  I did work on my computer last night from 12am-6am without even a 5 minute break.  Maybe they should market this to college students studying for exams or people trying to lose weight...lol.,F,27,1  days,11/14/2008,Claritin-d
195, 3, year round allergies,no side affects untill I stopped taking Claritin D,I felt great fro 6 years on Claritin D. I did tell the Dr that I was addicted and he laughed! I stopped taking Claritin D after a severe anxity attack that came out of no where.  I stopped all allergy medication and I have started the Shots!! I have been off all meds for 2 years and I still feel very tense and anxious and my mind races all the time.,F,31,6  years,11/12/2008,Claritin-d
196, 4, Sinus congestion & sneezing,Took me a while to figure out what was causing my heart palpitations (was worried I was going to have a heart attack)_ bloating after eating and constipation_ but has really taken me from feeling miserable with sinus congestion and constant sneezing attacks all year round to feeling human again.  The benefits outweigh the negatives for me.,Nothing else has worked for me_ I take it daily and if missed I notice a return of my sinus almost immediately....hurting me in the hip pocket though.,F,51,60  days,11/5/2008,Claritin-d

I took one pill.  I had absolutely NO interest in eating dinner the day I took it_ and the next morning and afternoon I didn't want to eat either_ and I had taken the pill yesterday!  I would describe the feeling of being on this drug as being on Adderal or Ritalin_ some kind of speed.  Don't plan on having a good nights sleep at all while taking this medication.  You will be tossing and turning.  Very potent!  Definitely not for people with any health problems or heart problems.,F,25,1  days,11/5/2008,Claritin-d
198, 3, rashes-allergic reaction to the sun,rapid heart beats_ high blood pressure_ insomnia_ almost passing out_ breaking out in sweat_ tired all the time.,I took Claritin-D for 3 days. The rashes are gone but I could fall asleep for only an hour or two each day. Yesterday_ I though I was going to die because all of a sudden_ my heart raced like crazy and I broke out in sweat.  I started seeing stars around me and I almost passed out several times.  It lasted for about two hours.  Now I feel so tired.  I was going to the doctor before I decided to check the internet for side effects and I'm glad I did.  I'll never take it again. I hope it didn't cause any permanent damage to my heart.,F,59,3  days,11/3/2008,Claritin-d

200, 4, Seasonal Allergies - Fall_,Well_ overall_ I'd say I like this (my throat hurt terribly before taking the medication).  I am definitely out of it however.  I can't remember what I had for lunch_ wait_ I just remembered.  Anyway_ I'm really out of it_ and definitely have weird chills going through my body_ but its better than having a terrible throat pain and not being able to talk or sing).  I also have a decrease in appetite_ but thats ok for me because I usually eat too much.,Overall Good,F,26,5  days,10/27/2008,Claritin-d

205, 3, Seasonal Allergies (Fall),I've taken this for at least five years during the fall season. It usually works fairly well at surpressing my hayfever but this year the side affect are terrible. Increased BP_ racing heart_ constipation_ depression_ anxiety_ moodiness bording on constant irritation of all people. Jittery_ not a buzzed feeling buta constant state of surrealism. I did not have muscle spasms but felt like I was walking funny_ as if my knees and hips had suddenly become bolted together. Also a bit of paranoia. The only reason I guessed this was the problem was that a friend had mentioned he had experienced the same thing_ I just thought I was going nuts.,While this drug is not for me I think it is worth trying.  Just be very careful and pay attention to your overall moodiness or mental state.,M,42,3  weeks,9/12/2008,Claritin-d
206, 3, Allergies,Horrible constipation!!  I use to be very regular_ and now I have not gone in a week.  I drink about a half gallon of water daily and take in 40 grams of fiber and still no relief.,Works great for my seasonal allergies.  I am going to start taking laxatives once a week.  I am lucky because I only have seasonal allergies Sept-Oct_ so taking laxatives for that short period of time is a good solution for me.,M,36,9  days,9/12/2008,Claritin-d
207, 5, severe allergies/asthma,I am trying to no take singulair and advair anymore due to weight gain.  Woke up this morning & thought I'd try Claritin D 24 hour. Within 1 hour symptoms were completely gone but the side effect set in.  Tingling chills all over my body_ clinched jaw_ heart palpitations and overall jittery feeling.  I tried to take a nap around 3PM and barely slept_ waking up sweaty.  Definitely noticed decreased appetite in this short time. Glad I am off work today_ as I don't think I could concentrate very well.  I feel like I am on drugs...I see why they use this stuff to make meth now.,I will continue to try this over the weekend_ maybe take 1/2 of the 24 hour pill tomorrow and see how that goes.  Quite honestly_ the decreased appetite is appealing to me.,F,32,1  days,8/21/2008,Claritin-d
208, 4, Seasonal Allergies,I slept fine_ but found it very easy to wake up in the morning. Not as hungry. Full of energy. Slight wheeziness sometimes_ but not when you'd expect - I could jog fine but would get wheezy at random times.,Can you imagine a drug that makes you have more energy_ need less sleep and not want to eat?  Part of me wants to take this drug every day for the rest of my life. But one day I ran out_ and just took a regular claritin instead. (I usually take it before bed). The next morning I had a terrible time getting up and was a zombie all day. The fact that it has such a huge effect on me scared me a little bit. Don't know that I'll keep taking it. It's unnatural how it effects me.,F,26,6  months,8/18/2008,Claritin-d
209, 5, itchy eyes_ headache_ congestion,decreased appetite_ increased focus and motivation_ increased mood_ lighter wallet.,The first day on the med I felt wonderful_ slightly hyperactive/verbal_ but overall I felt great! I am already a happy person_ but it made everything seem brighter and better. It helped immediately (within 30 mminutes) with my sinus headache_ my itchy/watery eyes and congestion. I have noticed a decrease in appetite_ but nothing worthy of concern_ if anything that is a beneficial side-effect. It increased my motivation_ increased my ability to focus and concentrate_ and I think it even increased the speed at which I think and solve problems. I have not taken the med today and already notice my sinus headache and itchy eyes coming back. I think I am having problems as a result of mold_ so hopefully by taking care of that I can stop taking the Claritin-D. I buy the generic version of it at the pharmacy and it is still outrageously priced I think that is the main downfall!,F,26,4  days,8/6/2008,Claritin-d
210, 2, sinus congestion_ drainage,nausea_ short of breath_ moodiness_ irritability_ sinus pain_ anxiety,I felt like I was losing my mind. I had been taking Drixoral_ but cannot get it anymore. I assumed the claritin d would be comparable. The pseudoephedrine is the same for both. I never thought the antihistamine could make such a difference. After not taking it for one day_ I already feel so much better.,F,42,15  days,8/1/2008,Claritin-d
211, 3, allergies_ sinus pressure,"I have never had a problem with Claritin-D.  The only side effects I noticed were that it made me hyper and feel somewhat ""high"" for awhile_ and then I was tired once the high wore off.  However_ these side effects were not so bad that they interfered with daily life or made me want to stop taking the drug.  However_ I don't know if the drug is very helpful either... I still have symptoms like sinus pressure_ post-nasal drip... but the symptoms are much less severe than they are when not taking the drug.  have been taking claritin D on and off for about 7 months.",satisfied overall.,F,22,7  months,7/26/2008,Claritin-d

Extreme drowsniness_ dizziness onset within 12 hours after taking it.,This medicine did not help to control my watery itchy eyes.,F,34,1  days,6/23/2008,Claritin-d
218, 3, allergies/nasal stuffiness,For 2 1/2 years I suffered from low back pain_ before a co-worker said he was having the same symptoms from taking Allegra D and suggested mine might be connected to Claritin D. I went to a regular MD_ a chiropractor_ a physical therapist and an acupuncturist for two years_ and none of them could figure out what was causing the pain. Within two weeks of stopping the Claritin D_ my low back pain was nearly gone.,While the medication took care of my allergies pretty well_ the low back pain I suffered from it wasn't worth it. I'm very disappointed how difficult it is to find this information. I feel like ALL side effects should be listed in the packaging_ even if it only affects 2% of people tested. Why should those 2% suffer unneccessarily just to save space on the packaging?,F,48,2.5  years,6/11/2008,Claritin-d

220, 3, sneezing,possible hyperness,I was told to give Claritin to my little boy by the doctor.  I could not find Claritin D for children so I gave him the generic without Sudafed.  Now_ 2 years later after him being off of it for several weeks_ I think the Loratadine was causing ADHD type behavior for the last 2 years.  When Sudafed was added to it_ he was calm_ but if we forgot the Sudafed_ he still had Loratadine in his system_ and was a little wild man.  He has had no allergy meds for 2 1/2 weeks and is calmer_ but still sneezing.  He also developed thick mucus in his throat a while after taking Loratadine and we have not been able to get it cleared up_ even with Prednizone.,M,7,2  years,4/29/2008,Claritin-d
221, 3, sinus pain from high pollen levels,Low back pain in the very middle of my back and some fatigue.  Wasn't sure if this was from the Claritin-D_ but I see a handful of women around my age here complaining of the same thing.  I guess I'll need to try something else to get through tree pollen season headache/pain-free (this is a new thing for me over the last couple of years).  Until the back pain hit this morning (after only 2 12-hour pills)_ I thought I had found my solution...,,F,37,1  days,4/28/2008,Claritin-d

First few days felt an increase in energy level_ but after day 4 had a definite drop in appetite_ bouts of dizziness_ and then the insomnia kicked in.  Will not use again on a regular basis.

All this after one dose.  I can handle the dry mouth and am not surprised it is making me tired (all antihistamines seem to do so even when they claim they don't cause drowsiness) but it hasn't even given me noticeable relief of my allergy symptoms so not going to take it again.

228, 4, seasonal head congestion,trouble sleeping_ dry mouth_ frequent urination in large quantities_ raised heart rate (I think this is what causes the insomnia),Twice a year I get a sore throat_ followed by head congestion that would then settle in my chest and cause me to cough for weeks_ especially at night.  I tried all kinds of stuff_ but claritin d 24 hr was the best to keep the congestion out of my chest.  I'd take it for 7-10 days_ and would be good to go.  The side effects are annoying_ especially the insomnia_ so I've started taking a couple of tylenol pm at night.  it doesn't seem to be as bad with the 12 hour tablets,M,40,5  days,3/28/2008,Claritin-d

My allergies were awful this morning_ so i broke down and took it(the 24 hour).  It always makes me feel crazy and nervous.  I have cried 3 times today.  My throat was all tight too and kind of sore.  I havent taken my leather jacket off all day because im freezing.  Completely lost my appetite too.  I have felt like a bundle of jittery nerves all day_ its awful!  I swear...never taking this stuff again!!,F,33,1  days,3/27/2008,Claritin-d
230, 5, Severe Allergies,mouth dryness_ insomnia if taken later than 3 pm or a lot of caffeine intake.,I was taking Allegra D  twice a day for 20 years.  After trying Claritin D12 hours_ I was amazed that it worked as well or better.  I only need one Claritin D where I needed 2 Allegra. It's great not needing a prescription_ and the hundreds of dollars in savings.,F,58,1  days,3/26/2008,Claritin-d
231, 2, allergies_ nasal congestion,during hours 1 and 4 (during the day): cold sweats_ fingers were like ICE_ heart rate dropped_ panic attacks_ inability to concentrate and focus (i.e._ couldn't work!); LATER THAT NIGHT (after 12 hours passed): nightmares_ woke up frequently,Yeah_ this relieved my congestion but it is NOT worth the side effects.  The first 3 days were uneventful_ but day 4 destroyed me.  I had no idea these symptoms were from the drug until I realized they started right after I took it and lasted for 4 hours.  I thought I was going to have to go to the ER because I couldn't figure out why I couldn't warm up my hands and I was sweating profusely.  I thought it was my thyroid.  If I would have known it would get as bad as it did_ I would not have bothered at all with this drug. It was like a bad trip.,F,29,4  days,2/7/2008,Claritin-d

I haven't slept more than an hour or two (at best) the last two nights.  I will never take this again.  I'm so glad I talked to some people at work today who confirmed I am not alone in this side effect_ and led me to do some research only to find out this is a pretty common side effect.  YIKES!,F,36,2  days,1/30/2008,Claritin-d

235, 3, constant allergies to everything,Constipation_ constipation_ constipation. I was always prone to it_ but with a good diet it wasn't a problem. I was taking it on and off and didn't notice anything_ but then I was taking it solidly for the past two weeks and have been wondering why there is no #2 happening. Not fun... well I missed yesterday's pill and voila_ it was like I was normal again. Still didn't think anything of it. Then I started putting it together and now I'm pissed I even took it tonight! Because no amount of food/water seems to help.,Also_ dry mouth_ frequent urination_ sometimes trouble emptying bladder_ and once had a total freak out that I've never experienced before- my heart was pounding so fast and hard while I was laying in bed the other night_ I was actually pretty scared. Lasted maybe 10 minutes. Anyhow_ the drug doesn't devastate my body but I think_ given the cost (I take the generic) I will discontinue use.,M,23,2  months,1/20/2008,Claritin-d
236, 1, allergies,Horrible insomnia.  I thought I was going crazy_ as I never had a problem sleeping.  Would wake up after an hour or two and not be able to go back t sleep.  I went 5 days with almost no sleep before I figured it was the Claritin-d.  I lost almost 8 lbs as I had no appetite and was a nervous wreck.  I also had bouts of extreme anxiety and depression.,This stuff is poison as far as I'm concerned.  The side affects are far worse than a runny nose.  They really need to more prominently label the major side affects_ which after reading all these posts are:  Insomnia_ nervousness/anxiety_ depression.  Will never use again.,M,57,5  days,1/17/2008Email,Claritin-d
237, 5, Stuffiness_ frequent infections.,Occasional heart rate flutter_ or pounding when drinking caffeine (coffee) an hour after taking Claritin-D 24hr; Unable to empty bladder completely_ leaking urine_ and semen; There is an undeniable direct affect to my prostate; Dry mouth.,Side effects have been reduced dramatically by switching to 12hr and taking 2 pills a day_ my workplace is extremely dusty and Claritin-D has enabled me to continue in my career_ I feel more alert and clearer thinking while taking it_ probably due to the unrestricted breathing and sinus relief. In my case Claritin-D has been a life saver however I would hate to add up how much has been spent on it over a three year period.,M,34,3  years,1/1/2008,Claritin-d

240, 2, seasonal allergies,EXTREME drowsiness.,I've taken the generic versions of this drug many different times and NEVER had drowsiness before.  In fact_ I always have the opposite reaction - lots of energy and trouble sleeping sometimes.  The only reason I have the brand name Claritin-D is because my fiance bought it and it didn't do anything for him_ so he gave it to me.The drowsiness was horrible_ to the point where I had to leave work early.  Worse than taking two Benedryl. At least the drowsiness from Benedryl is only temporary.,F,31,1  days,12/18/2007,Claritin-d

242, 4, Severe allergies,Constipation_ sleeplessness with the 24 hour dose and a little hyperness.,The key to this drug is how you take it and the doseage. Don't take the 24 hour dose unless you enjoy staying up all night.

Fatigue.,My Doctor told me that most of her patients have significant side effects from Claritin and Claritin-D. The bladder infections and back pain are known side effects_ and common in her patients. This is why she does not prescribe or recommend this drug anymore. The insomnia_ dry mouth and nose (leading to nose bleeds in some people)_ are also known side effects that many patients experience. Plus_ the Claritin didn't really correct my allergies. I also had to pay for 3 rounds of Macrobid to clear up my urinary tract infection. Claritin is too expensive...,F,39,4  days,11/27/2007,Claritin-d

Slept in very late this am_ woke up very moody.  Turn into a confrontation later in afternoon.  Ended up with swearing and hitting me with an object.

247, 5, Allergies,Decreased appetite_ thirsty_ a little edgy,If I eat a good breakfast and take my Claritin-D 12 hour in the morning.  This helps with any sleep disorder side effects.  I can eat a sensible lunch and dinner because of the decreased appetite.  Drink lots of water_ and exercise to help the edgy feeling.  I also take two Kava-Kava (purchase from healthfood stores) capsules which take the edgy/moody side effect completely away. Claritin-D works for me!,F,47,2  years,10/24/2007Email,Claritin-d

251, 5, Sinus Congestion_ Itchy Throat,I drink a lot of water and I eat a balanced diet so maybe that helps me to have no side effects at all.  Because my congestion is relieved_ I am clearer headed_ but not jittery and able to focus easily.  I love my 24 hour claritin D and do not know why others react so strongly and negatively to it.  I take this stuff every day and when I tried to be cheap (even thought I use the generic brand) and I chose not to take Claritin D_ I couldn't breathe as clearly and I felt foggy headed and usually get a sinus infection if I do not go back on it soon.  That means time off of work + cost of prescriptions and that is not worth it at all!I sleep fine every night_ too.  Everyone's body reacts to drugs differently and this is one example of that.,This stuff helps me survive my move from California to Texas and the development of allergies that I NEVER had before the move!

254, 5, Seasonal Allergies,Constant thirst means I have to drink lots of water_ then I have to pee a lot and it takes me a long time to go (weak stream).  I wake up more during the night_ but have plenty of energy during the day. Constipation subsides after about three days of continued use.  And mosquito bites don't itch!,For me_ the benefits clearly outweigh the side effects.  When I periodically go off Claitin-D_ I sleep through the night but feel tired all day and can't touch alcohol or I get a SEVERE sinus headache an hour or two later.  After several days of being constantly foggy_ groggy_ congested_ and miserable_ I always go back to the Claritin-D and feel better immediately.  From reading this thread_ it appears you either love it or hate it.  I agree there are side effects_ but haven't found anything else that works (for me).,M,45,2  years,7/19/2007,Claritin-d

The dizziness goes away after taking it several days consecutively. I gained five pounds when I stopped taking it. Didn't realize that pseudophedrine really does mean pseudo-ephedrine! I have a heart murmur_ and I just can't take the extra pounding on top of it. My doctor acted like I was crazy_ so I'm glad there are others out there.

Considering Claritin is over-the-counter_ I NEVER expected to have these symptoms.  I took it for over a month and each week I blamed it on something new.  I was taking a weight supplement and I blamed it on that_ then I went to Las Vegas_ and blamed it on the alcohol.  I've been taking the 24-hour pill and it's been hell.  I've woken up 2-3 times EVERY night for the past few weeks with a pounding heart rate and need to urinate.

When I was finally able to get to sleep_ I really crashed - slept like the dead for 12 hours.,My stinking HMO wants me to switch to Claritin so they wouldn't have to pay for Allegra which for me worked w/out side effects.  ONE PILL of this JUNK did nothing for my allergies_ but had me bouncing off the walls for 3 days.  This is a DANGEROUS drug.  I do NOT recommend that anyone take this stuff.,F,44,1  days,6/9/2007,Claritin-d

I stick to the 12-hour version and again_ after the first couple of days of use_ the insomnia problems go away.

It wasn't until recently that I had to start taking it again.  I noticed the lack of stool at first but it didn't really bother me because I could breathe.  Recently however I've been more backed up than ever before.  I've changed my diet_ taken lots of fiber_ and nothing has worked.

I thought I was going to kill (not literally) my boyfriend today and after reading everyone else's comments about how it made them anxious and irritated I am relieved to know that I'm not the only one going crazy!

274, 3, sinusitis,increased heartbeat_ nervousness_ dizziness_ anxiety_ sleeplessness,I've been taking this on and off_ but I recommend only taking the 12 hour dose once a day because the 24 hr causes these intense side effects.  It's such a relief to hear that other people have the same symptoms; I didn't know why I felt so horrible all the time!,F,21,4  months,5/4/2007,Claritin-d

277, 1, red_ watery_ itchy eyes and nose,Ok this is the deal. Exactly one week ago I had a face peel. No big deal. Done it before. Same day I started taking Claritin D 24 hour. No big deal. After 4 days I couldnt for my life figure out why my skin_ STILL_ was dehydrated and peeling and red. And I was SOOO thirsty and oddly enough very hyper. Started to buy all kinds of skin creams cause I figured I must have overdone the peel-thing. Nothing helps. But after reading these reviews I know why my skin is messed up along with the rest of my body!!!! Currently as I write this_ I am experiencing ALL of the side effects. I will NEVER EVER take this tablet again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,TAKE IT OFF THE SHELVES!!!,F,30,7  days,4/23/2007,Claritin-d

I could actually feel my stomach trembling inside me! I felt tingly on my lips_ scalp and back. My tongue went numb.

Dreaming constantly_ restlessness_ headache_ congested still at 3am. I wake with the headache still_ very thirty_ stomach hurts_ nasal passages burning. Felt like I only slept 3 hrs. No energy....at least I don't feel enough to get through today. I swear I will never take this again. Tingling is gone for the moment but I just feel drained. I tossed and turned all night.,,F,34,1  times,4/17/2007Email,Claritin-d
279, 2, newly acquired allergies,While I type this_ I am sweating like crazy_ I have a killer headache_ I'm nauseaous_ and I've been fighting off vomiting for the past three hours.,I recently moved to TX and discovered that it's very common for someone who has never had allergies to all of a sudden get them in TX.  I tried this drug after having allergy symptoms for more than three weeks.  I feel so awful right now_ and my eyes are still watering_ my nose is still running_ and my sinuses are still heavy.  There's no way I'm taking this again.,F,35,2  days,4/16/2007,Claritin-d
280, 1, nasal congestion_ sneezing,Within 3 hours I felt groggy_ by hour 4 I felt horrible. I felt dizzy_ drunk and hangover all at the same time. I could actually feel my stomach trembling inside me! I felt tingly on my lips_ scalp and back. My tongue went numb. I felt nausea. (Pardon any misspelling_ I feel zombie-like still. It's 11:40pm and I took 1 12 hr pill at 3pm.) At the end of the 4th hour I was on the couch hoping it would be over soon. Over 8 hours after taking it I am congested. It didn't really help that much. I've been really thirsty. Normally I eat around 6 or so and tonight I didn't eat until 9:30pm. I wasn't hungry. I had slight stomach pains. Pain on my inner thigh....don't know if it's related but I didn't feel until about 4 hrs. after taking it.,I don't mind taking pseudoephidrine. I take Advil cold & sinus (25mg pseudoephidrine) but Claritin 12 hr. has a massive dose of 120mg. I would hate to think how I'd feel if I took the 24 hr pill.And there is a Claritin 24 hr pill commercial on TV as I type!!! Don't take this. Please find something else. You've been warned!!!

282, 1, Seasonal allergies,Have not slept in 72 hours!!!! This drug is worse than any thing i have ever done in my younger stupider days as a recreational drug user.  Nervousness_ elevated heart rate.,It did help my sinuses_ but not worth the side effects by any means. In fact this stuff should be pulled off the market as I am about to lose my job which requires the utmost precision and skill.,M,,3  days,3/29/2007,Claritin-d
283, 2, Seasonal Allergies,"I feel only half ""with it""_ wanting to curl up and fall asleep_ dry mouth_ mild anxiety (I suffer from it already though).  This feeling of being only half awake seems to come with any nasal decongestant drug I've tried_ and I hate it.",I had a very similar feeling with Allegra_ which is why I stopped using that drug (even though it worked great).  I decided to give this one a try_ and am disappointed that the side effects are so strong.  I think I'd rather live with the allergy symptoms_ even though they are quite annoying.  I felt like the drug kicked in around an hour after I took it_ my nose cleared up_ and I felt great.  But about 3-4 hours later_ my nose started running_ and it felt like the medicine was only making me feel more sick.,F,26,1  days,3/19/2007,Claritin-d
284, 2, Extreme Spring Allergies,Helped somewhat with symptoms_ but the side effects are unbearable.,I have been taking 24 Hour Claritin-D now for 3 days. I stopped because I was having a lot of trouble falling asleep and staying asleep_ a problem I never have otherwise. I experienced very wild intense dreaming and nightmares that caused me to wake frequently throughout the night. Claritin-D did not completely eliminate my symptoms_ but I did notice that it helped a great deal. I plan to stop using this because I do not like the side effects.,M,37,3  days,3/17/2007,Claritin-d
285, 1, Acute sinus infection,Outrageous anxiety; irrational thought processes; nervousness; elevated blood pressure; muscular tightening; tunnel vision;,I realize my reaction was extreme_ severe_ and out of the ordinary.  But I use the OTC form quite often without noticeable side effects.  Frankly_ this 6 hour duration period was the most scary experience I have had in my 43 year life span.  I do not wish this experience upon my worst enemy.  I sincerely pray that nobody else ever has these side effects.,M,43,1  days,3/13/2007Email,Claritin-d
286, 3, Allergies,At first I wasn't sure Claritin-D was to blame for all of my symptons. But now I think so after reading other comments and doing research. I noticed the constipation immediately. Fiber does not help--only a laxative once a week. Now 2 laxative pills don't work--has to be three!! My throat is achy and so is my chest. My body aches like I have a viral infection and I am tired too much. I have noticed occassional shaking and tremors in my legs to such a degree that I walked funny. And unless I go work out_ I do have trouble sleeping some nights. I noticed when I skipped Claritin-D a day or two I felt better. Fatigue and achiness came back once I resumed use.,It does help control the allergy symptons_ however. I do not have the constant sinusitis and headaches I used to get all the time. I work around a lot of dust_and with the Claritin-D I don't sneeze very much. Great for allergies...LOUSY for everything else!,F,46,3  months,2/8/2007,Claritin-d
287, 5, Undiagnosed Allergies,Lightness of wallet.  Other than this_ no adverse side effects noticed.,I have taken OTC generic pseudoephedrine(240mg for 24hr) and loratidine(10mg) - both treat the individual symptoms (pseudoephedrine lets me breathe_ loratidine controls the itching/sneezing/coughing/watery eyes_ etc.).  So_ Claritin-D is a good 2-in-1 for me.  I have recently started taking the generic Walitin-D and haven't experienced any loss of relief_ and it saves me a couple of bucks every 10 days.  I am concerned about possible long-term effects of taking this drug (addiction/desensitivity/buildup in the liver_ etc.)_ and would love to find the right diet/lifestyle combo that the alternative health community claims is the key to freedom from allergies.,F,27,3  months,2/2/2007Email,Claritin-d
288, 1, Allergies,This was my on again_ off again antihistamine. I took it because I lack health insurance and my allergies are pretty bad at times. This medicine sometimes relieves my allergies by a good margin_ but I sometimes experienced irritablity and loss of appetite. You cannot fathom how angry I was when I took one to relieve my allergies and not only did it do NOTHING in stopping my allergies_ but it killed my appetite - right before I was going to eat at a Japanese Tepon! I stopped the drug after that. I'd rather eat.,Antihistamine drugs are a bad idea. I've been taking them for years and experienced many chronic health problems_ including frequent loss of energy_ loss of appetite_ asthma_ painful indigestion; I'm in my twenties! I shouldn't be experiencing all of this! I recently learned to control allergies through a healthy nutrient rich diet_ an avoidance of processed foods (saturated fat is fine_ as it's a real food; margerine is solidified vegetable oil_ which is the same as trans-fat). Taking a higher dose of vitamin C usually stops my allergies within fifteen minutes of consumption - all without side effects. I have no repsect for convenience drugs anymore. The key to freedom is not only independent financial secerity_ but also being the masters of our own health. No doctor has EVER told me that allergies is a modern disease and can be controlled with diet. I feel cheated that I suffered with my allergies this long!

290, 4, Allergenic Rhinitis - year round,Occasional insomnia_ rapid heart beat (seems to be in conjunction with caffiene).,This is the only drug that allows me to function in society.  I am allergic 24 hours a day and almost every day of the year I have swollen red eyes and congested nose.  NO other medications work for me_ I can't take regular claritan or other med without having horrible swelling of the nose and eyes.  If not for Claritan D I'd be a social misfit and unable to carry my career.  I curently take the 24 hour version and my allergies are so bad that sometimes even Claritin D isn't enough.  I've had sinus surgury to encourage draining and I get shots (which help).  I also take singulair and nasonex with Claritan-D.  I have a history of sinus infections and even had recurring infections for over 14 months.  If Claritin-D left my life I'd be in trouble.,M,28,10  years,10/11/2006Email,Claritin-d
291, 4, Nasal allergies,To date_ no side effects at all.  I have not been constipated_ although I have been drinking a few cups of green tea every day_ which might help others who are experiencing constipation.  I have been sleeping okay - never do sleep through the night anyway.,I have never had allergies till about one month ago.  I have tried two different prescriptions from the doctor - nothing worked - totally stuffed up_ could not breathe through my nose for 3 weeks.  Miserable.  Finally_ doctor said to buy OTC Claritin-D.  So far_ I'm much better.  Not totally_ better_ but I can at least breath pretty good through my nose and feel more like a human being.,F,49,6  days,10/9/2006,Claritin-d
292, 1, Allergies,Extreme sleeplessness_ racing heart_ slight dizziness and light-headedness_ dry mouth_ decrease in appetite_ thirst_ increase in urination.,I had heard great things about Claritin-D for allergies_ but unfortunately I tend to be extremely sensitive to any drugs_ so I got most of the bad side effects.  I won't use it again_ and I would recommend that anyone with anxiety or drug sensitivity not take it either.,F,29,1  days,8/14/2006,Claritin-d
293, 5, Relief From Allergies,At first I did notice the constipation_ so I tried to eat some roughage and found that Oatmeal or a Banana was a great reliever.   Now_ occasionally constipated_ so I just grab a banana or have some oatmeal_ almost always very shortly followed by releif.   Occasional minor constipation is a very small price_ especially when considering the alternative of life without it.   I have tried other prescriptions_ but have found nothing that works as good as Claritin-D.... nothing!,I have been taking Claritin-D 24 Hour for well over 10 years.  Prior taking this drug I suffered with my allergies... extreme sinus congestion.   I was always tired and extremely irritable!!!  I was so irritable that I found myself withdrawing and avoiding even saying hello to people.  Fellow employees would stop by my office to say hello and the whole time that they were there_ I would be raging to myself... when are they going to leave!  Also_ if I stopped_ I dropped.  I would fall asleep getting my haircut_ teeth cleaned_ etc.  I even fell asleep having my crowns replaced.  Now_ I have the energy that I had before I had allergies.  I take every morning before I shower; by time I am done_ I feel great!  When ever I forget to take it_ by 10 AM I can feel my rage climbing and lack of concentration setting in_ all which promptly subsides shortly after taking.  Yes_ I am dependent on this drug... its been a life saver for me.,M,50,10  years,7/22/2006Email,Claritin-d

I also had loss of appetite_ dizziness_ and inability to concentrate well.,I didn't notice any significant improvement in my congestion_ but even if I had_ I don't think the side effects would have been a worthwhile tradeoff.

All experienced during severe episodes.,After being on Claritin D for over a year I started experiencing a severe reaction. The decongestant had built up in my system and caused overdosing symptoms. The dumping into my system lasted about an hour several times a week. During the hour it lasted_ I thought I was dying it was so severe. Taking Claritin-D again several years later started producing the same side effects after only a few days.,F,26,1  years,5/10/2006,Claritin-d

I drink lots of water on or off Claritin D so never have constipation problems. Also what works for me is to take 5min to 1hr before bedtime. First two nights are tough but then I sleep like a baby.

I am grateful to the chemical company that produces it.  Because it stopped working for me after weeks of usage exactly this time last year_ I haven't used it in over a year since 2 days ago.  So last year my doctor prescribed Allegra 180 and that cured me_ but it took 5 days.  I want nothing else but Claritin-D 12hr or Allegra 180 24hr.
