4, 1, Inner Ear Infection,I was taking Claritin D because I had an inner ear infection causing me dizziness_ naseua_ and many other things. Doctor recommended Claritin D as a decongestant to open up my sinuses and help the ear infection pass quicker. it made my symptoms WORSE. I've been dizzy_ naseuas_ I've had no appetite_ I've been jittery_ my heart is racing_ and my mouth has never been so dry. It has not affected my sleep though_ but it's been annoying to go from feeling better to feeling worse once starting this medication.,,F,20,10  days30Mg,2/8/2016Email,Claritin-d
5, 3, Nasal congestion cant breath,I have been taking claritin for about 10 months.The only side effects I have gotten from this simI have lost my appetite some.It doesn't clear my nasal passages out all the way.If I don't take it I still cant breath.,breathy agree with the other post.There are alot of stupid people out there that had to go and ruin it for alto of people that have to take claritin for allergies.So people like me and everyone else has to sign for it at the pharmacy every 10 days.And you cant even get it the day before.My sister tried to get it the day before and they wouldn't give it to her.She had to wait till the next days far as I know she hasn't had any problems taking the claritin.They need to change the way they sell claritinD.So those that have ruined it for me and everyone else have a much harder time trying to buy it and or cant buy it at all.One of these days they may take claritinD 12 hours and the the other claritind of the market for good Because of those stupid ignorant people that have ruined for everyone.,F,56,10  months5mg,11/4/2015,Claritin-d
6, 3, To stop itching my eczema,Extreme dry mouth _ chills and rapid heart rate.,My Doctor recommend I take Claritin to help with the itch caused by my eczema. While it has stopped the itch  - I'm covered in goosebumps and have to drink about 500L of water to help with the dry mouth - which leads so having to use the washroom ever 20 mins. Not sure its worth the side efforts.,F,28,1  months1 1X W,9/10/2015,Claritin-d
7, 5, Nasal congestion,Slight rise in heart rate.,Great product. My sinuses get really clogged. Sometime the Claritin D doesn't even clear my stuffed up nose all the way. When that happens I eat (2) cloves raw garlic and then I'm 100% again. Try it_ as garlic is the best natural decongestant there is. :),M,50, 12 hr 1X D,8/3/2015Email,Claritin-d

18, 5, Allergies_ extreme sinus congestion,Sleeplessness_ wake up multiple times throughout the night,First off_ I must say Claritin D 24 hr has been a MIRACLE cure for my horrific sinus congestion_ enflamed nasal passages_ relentless sneezing and constantly running nose. Despite the sleeplessness_ I would not give up my Claritin D. To be honest_ I slept horribly without the Claritin D anyway. At least with it I'm able to breathe. My nose is completely clear and it is wonderful to be able to breathe through my nose as if I had no allergies at all. I've been taking the pills at night which may be part of the sleeplessness issue_ so I'm going to try taking it in the morning instead. Regardless_ I absolutely love Claritin D. It's the only allergy medication that truly cures all my symptoms.,F,26,3  days24 hr,3/26/2015,Claritin-d

26, 4, constantly stuffed up but not aller,Nothing,If I do not have this I cannot breathe through my nose it is horrible and impossible to live without it. The thing I hate the most is I can only buy a small amount so I'm constantly at the pharmacy_ I get cut off if I buy too often because some Aholes have to ruin it for everyone & make drugs out of it! Fucking annoying! I have no health insurance so it's costing me a tom also. :(,F,31,3  years,1/6/2015,Claritin-d
27, 1, Clogged Ears_ Allergies,This drug helped somewhat with my congestion and allergies_ and it gave me extra energy.  Unfortunately_ I had difficulty with sleep on this drug_ and then after taking it for about 2.5 weeks_ I became very depressed and unable to control my emotions_ which is very much unlike me.  It took me almost two weeks to start feeling normal again_ and I'm still not sure that I am totally back to myself.,I am sure that not everyone will have the same experience that I did_ but I wouldn't want anyone to risk it.  This was one of the worst experiences of my life.,M,36,17  days 1X D,1/6/2015Email,Claritin-d
28, 5, severe sinus drainage,No side effects.,This is the only medicine that ever works for my severe sinus problems. I take regular Claritin on a daily basis but when I get a cold I get bad drainage that makes me cough and the spit out phlegm. I have anxiety and I feel very calm on this medicine. I hate to say it but you can't take other peoples word on everything. Each person is different. I like to breathe through my nose. Which is impossible without this medicine. I only use it when I get a bad cold or severe drainage that even antibiotics can't get rid of. I highly recommend this product. It works. If you have other problems I'd recommend talking to your Dr first.,F,34,2  years10 ng,12/10/2014Email,Claritin-d

I have been struggling with my throat and sinus issues that even affected my breathing I felt like I was choking for over 1 year multiple doctors_ thought it was Acid Reflux causing issues.   After taking Claritin D  this was the first time in a long time I felt normal again I was so happy.  I wanted to find a post somewhere to let other people that might have same issues.

46, 4, nasal run_ sneezing 27 years,Started taking for a cough with congestion I could not get rid of as a prescription from my dr. Turns out_ the medicine she prescribed was what it had needed for the past 27 years of my life. Cleared up the cough I had for 6 months_ and my nose completely quit running. Yes_ I feel like I'm on speed. I have mild insomnia_ due probably also to my work patterns as well. I do have a bit of appetite loss. And if you don't force yourself to eat_ you will feel the full effect of the speed. And I'm really surprised I had not seen anyone mention an increased sexual appetite_ or pleasure. I would recommend this to anyone with a legitimate reason to take it. Since it is OTC with signature_ it's not for everyone .,,F,28,10  days,9/29/2013,Claritin-d
47, 5, I had sinus and therefore headaches,"So for me the first day after 10 minutes of taking it I immediately felt my head clearing up but felt a little spaced out so went to bed. The second day and from that day on I feel great. No more sinus no more headaches . I never felt so focused before . Living w sinus pressure and like u can't think or so anything is the worst. I had no idea I had been living w such head fog all this time and for the first time my brain felt clear and I was able to to think. I'm not kidding . I also feel like I'm so sharp _ I'm focused and finish my tasks . I also have energy I can clean my house for hours. I got a little worried that this drug is so great . So I asked my ""date "" who is a doctor if this is bad . He told me not to worry abt it but just to know if I stop taking it Iay b more congested for about 2 days until my body adjusts... Oh so I love this magic pill.... I just say take it if u need it don't take it for other reasons .... And yes it curves appetite but I remind myself to eat my 3 meals bc I believe if u don't eat at all it can't be good And it can slow ur metabolism so they day u stop taking the pill a d u get hungry again and start eating  u will gain weight faster. So I eat but healthy bc due to the pill I don't feel like having big meals. I have lost abt  5 pounds ..",,F,34,1  months240 mg,6/29/2013Email,Claritin-d

I have never suffered from anxiety before_ but this made me realize how bad it must be for people who do.  The anxiety made me so depressed that I even had some suicidal thoughts.  It took my wife to figure out that it was the medication as I was too wrapped up in anxiety and lack of sleep in the medication to figure it out.  I stopped taking it and after the dose wore off began to immediately feel like myself again. Due to this experience I personally think that anything containing pseudoephedrine should only be available by prescription.  If you have any of these issues stop taking it immediately.,M,37,7  days 1X D,8/10/2012Email,Claritin-d
