1, 3, Birth Control & Migranes,Pros: Helped migraines. Loved not having a periodCons: major hair loss over time. Use to have very thick hair_ so I wasn't concerned at first_ until 2/3 of it was gone. Hair everywhere all the time. Loss of libido.,I was very excited when this came out and went on it the first month it was on the market. It has been a double edged sword for me - I have a love hate relationship with it. Trying some other birth controls to see if my hair will come back. May be keeping me from losing weight (body build_ run_ HITT + good diet). But not sure.,F,39,5  years 1X D,3/7/2012,Lybrel
