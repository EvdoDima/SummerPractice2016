1, 5, Unrelenting vicious migraines 4 day,Increased urination as migraine desists_ then horrible bone ache throuhout body_ esp spine_ fluid shift from peripheral to central.,There is nothing else that remotely touches the pain_ and if taken promptly_ I will avoid having to take anti-nausea supp. For there is nothing so helpless as when the projectile vomiting begins.,F,66,10  years,6/30/2016Email,Maxalt
2, 3, Migraines,I take the generic Maxalt and although it does take migraine away_ Im always scared of taking it cause of side effects. Chest and throat tightness_ trouble swallowing_ stomach burns_ half my body feels heavy and slight numbness on half of face,I only take this if I really really can't take headache anymore because I hate the side effects of Maxalt. Also_ takes a good 1 hr to start working,F,38,4  months10mg,4/10/2016Email,Maxalt
3, 4, migraines,I usually get about 2-4 migraines a month. Initially exhaustion was the side effect. However_ the last few months I have noticed that my memory is not the same. This is the only prescription medicine I take. My memory is failing. I am 53 yrs old.,I have suffered w/migraines since I was a kid and a migraine  would last up to 72 hours. Initially thought Maxalt was a miracle drug. I take it as soon as the migraine starts. Usually 1 pill (10 mgs) resolves it w/in an hour. Sometimes the migraine is so severe after 2 hours I have to take another dose_ but the 2nd dose always stops the pain & all the other symptoms. When the pain is gone I am usually left w/severe exhaustion & feeling like I got hit by a truck. But since the migraine is gone w/in a few hours I just sleep off the exhaustion. However lately I have noticed that my memory is not the same. Very scary!  Hoping the memory loss is reversible once I stop the rizatriptan.,F,53,3  years10 mg 1X AN,4/9/2016Email,Maxalt
4, 4, Migraines,"Very tired and sluggish_ slow mental response time.  I find that the Maxalt works best with two asprin_ something about the caffine in the asprin makes it work better.  My migraine is usually gone within 1 1/2 hours.  If I do have to take more than 1 for a single migraine I do experience the ""medicine hangover"" the next day.",,F,45,5  years10 MG 1X AN,3/30/2016,Maxalt

6, 5, Cluster headaches,Slightly drowsy but worth it,I take Maxalt generic (Rizact from India) as soon as I feel the onset of early symptoms (light headed_ feel warm_ sinuses drain) and it aborts the cluster. taking it after the cluster is in full pain mode does not work. then I take imitrex inject,M,47,7  days2 x 10mg 1X D,2/25/2016Email,Maxalt

8, 5, Chronic acute rmigraines,With brand Maxalt I had no side effects.  It melted quickly_ had a decent_ minty_ taste and worked amazing_ if taken as prescribed_ at the very onset of migraine.,I'm STUCK with the generic now and I hate it.  The taste is awful and it takes much longer to melt and work.  When I have nausea_ with my migraine_ the foul taste makes me gag.,F,47,5  years10 mg,1/23/2016,Maxalt

10, 5, Disabling migraine,Groggy_ bad taste in mouth_ dry mouth_ visual disturbance and photophobia up to 24 hours after migraine_ hyper sensitive to smell_ change to colour and smell of urine_ foul body odour_ hangover type feeling for 18-30 hours after migraine clears.***i have experienced frightening serotonin syndrome symptoms almost immediately after taking MAXALT when cluster migraines have caused me to miss a dose of SSRI meds***,It clears my migraines better than anything else. If I can take it immediately my pre migraine symptoms occur_ no side effects and only mild migraine develops and clears within  60 minutes. If taking MAXALT once migraine symptoms have begun_ it takes  around 2 hours to clear and puts me to sleep for about 40 mins:but I awake without the severe pain.MAXALT is a godsend for me. At best other treatments only reduce the pain by about half_ and shorten migraine duration to around 24 hours.  The side effects are worth it - except for the serotonin syndrome which is scary; I now keep a dosette box so I can check whether the SSRI has been administered: and if not_ I take it with the MAXALT.,F,49,1  years 2X D,8/31/2015,Maxalt
11, 4, Severe Migraines,I take this med 1-2 times a day PRN (when needed). Typically several times per month.No noticeable side effects.,Works well for my migraines.

12, 5, Migraines,Mild diarrhea occurs the following day. Upset stomach is worse if I take maxalt more than one day in a row. Occasional tightening of the throat or jaw sensation_  but doesn't last as long as it did  with other medications.,Have previously taken Imitrex  and relpax _the maxalt melt tablets work faster and more effectively for me with less side effects.

14, 5, Chronic migraines for 43 years,As many_ I have tried most migraine medication to no prevail until I was prescribed maxalt.  As a child I was hospitalized with chronic migraines and ad I got older 100% of the time a mrgraine ended me in ER. Since using maxalt_ if taken during the first few minutes when vision starts to go fuzzy I can head of most of the horrific systems. I still feel a dull localized pressure and incapacitated for the remainder of the day. I 100% fall asleep and not able to do anything visually maxalt hsd changed my life. I would be violently ill for several day before maxalt and by the next day I function fine but feeling like I have a severe neurological event. I feel a bit slower in thinking and response time and physically a bit fatigued. I can't operate in florescent lighting and I try to keep down stimulus.,I have tried the generic_ however was NOT successful.

15, 3, Migraines for 17 yrs,I usually take one Maxalt_ and then wait about 2 hours and have to take another,Maxalt has been working for me (generally speaking)...but I usually have to take two in order to get relief. My legs and arms feel heavy afterwards and I am unable to drive. I thought that the reason for these quick acting migraine meds is so that you can resume a normal life after a migraine attack? I haven't found one that doesn't leave me incredibly dizzy and tired_ therefore requiring that I take the day off of work anyway. I feel very achy all over_ kind of like how you feel before you get the flu. I felt the same with Relpax_ only worse. Imitrex also.,F,36,1  daysnot sure,6/29/2015,Maxalt

Maxalt only works when I catch the migraine within the first hour. My doctor limits me to six per month with 2 per migraine.

29, 3, Chronic migraines,Always: drowsiness and clumsiness_ varying degreesUsually: Moderate/severe tingling/burning sensation in my nose_ forehead_ and scalp (skin hurts to touch); decrease in mental acuity.,I've had migraines for approximately 10 years_ but as I have gotten older_ they have gotten much more frequent and painful. After getting an ulcer taking only Excedrin for the pain_ I tried both Imitrex and Maxalt. I prefer the Maxalt mainly for the reason that the Imitrex would always give me the tingling sensation_ and the Maxalt only will about 65-75% of the time. However_ I also see a pattern in myself of the medication only getting rid of the migraine 75% of the time; 20% it will dull it but not erase it_ and 5% it doesn't touch it.I'm critical_ but I do think this is a really good medication. My biggest issue is the burning_ which I know not all people experience.,F,25,1  years10MG 1X D,6/17/2013,Maxalt
30, 5, occular and cluster migraines,some chest and neck tightness_ a little drowsy.,I LOVE THIS medicine!!! I have had migraines for as long as I can remember. Imitrex helped_ but the choking sensation and neck discomfort was almost unbearable. Maxalt MLT works so good_ it has given me my quality of life back. My migraines are not menstrual related_ they are related to barometric pressure changes though. I dont know what I would do without this medicine. It is wonderful.,F,46, 10 mg MLT 1X D,4/8/2013,Maxalt
31, 5, migraines,drowsiness_ dizziness_ inability to concentrate for about 2 hours after taking,"I took my first ever dose of Maxalt tonight for a migraine with associated light sensitivity_ neck pain_ nausea. Within 35 minutes my pain was 95% gone_ although I did become very sleepy and felt ""drugged""_ which wasn't ideal since I was at work. Most sleepiness was gone in about 2 hours_ completely resolved by 4 hours after the dose.

32, 3, migraine,I get quite confused after I take it_ and am easily agitated. It gets rid of the pain_ though not as quickly as I'd like_ and I still have a very strong smell sensitivity after taking it_ which is one of my worst migraine symptoms (other than pain). While I do take it to get rid of pain_ I'm hoping to switch to something else_ because the MaxAlt leaves me as unable to work as a migraine does.,I once took it several hours after using alcohol--big mistake. I was completely confused and hallucinating. It did fix the headache_ though...,M,36,8  months10 mg 1X AN,2/25/2013,Maxalt
33, 5, Migraine,I used to wait until I was sure it was a migraine but now at the onset  I take 1/2 of a maxalt-mlt  if not backing off I take more. I don't get as sleepy that way. Still feel something odd at the back of my throat but that's tolerable,,F,50,2  years10 mg,2/14/2013,Maxalt

35, 5, Migraine,Slight fatigue although I think it is a result of severe head pain being removed rather than a side affect of the medication.,This medication has been a God-send! I have no side affects and can take it a work. It has worked every time I take it. No other medication has worked for my migraines than this one. I have tried many others with no relief whatsoever. Unfortunately it is very expensive and my insurance only covers a part. I pay about $10 a pill. But I would be willing to pay $100 a pill for for something that cures my migraine like Maxalt does. I've taken it off and on for over 10 years and it has always worked.,F,49,10  years10 Mg 1X M,12/3/2012Email,Maxalt
36, 5, Migraine,None,After suffering for 25years with migraines and taking various things that barely worked without making one feel awful_ i can't believe how wonderful this little dissolving tab is.  As soon as i feel my neck/head tightening and sometimes already the start of a headache  ( which is my warning to a migraine attack) i take one 10mg tab and usually within 30mins the symptoms have disappeared.  Just pray there'll not be any long-term bad effects from taking Maxalt.,F,65,10  months10mg 1X M,11/28/2012Email,Maxalt
37, 5, migraines,Not sure of any.  Works really well and I get headaches at least twice a week.  Best if taken at night so sleep follows. Often sneeze within a hour of taking which relieves pressure. I can get 30 per prescription versus limit of 10 with Imitrex.  So I never worry about running out because of monthly limit.  Effectiveness has never diminished in years.,,,,6  years5 mg,11/3/2012,Maxalt
38, 3, Migraine with aura,It got rid of my aura_ but never got rid of the headache. I had migraine hangover everyone I took it. I don't like this medication at all anymore because now I no longer get the aura and it makes the pain worse. The only things that work for me now are narcotics.,,F,15,3  years,9/6/2012,Maxalt
39, 5, Migraines roughly 2-3 per month,Slight drowsiness sometimes_ but nothing severe.,I told my doctor I loved him after he prescribed me this medication_ after suffering from my migraines that lasted for 24-48hrs since puberty. So long as I catch it within the first hour_ this tablet will kick it completely. I love that it is dissolving so if I'm already a bit nauseous_ it starts absorbing quickly.,F,30,1.5  years10mg 1X AN,8/31/2012Email,Maxalt

42, 5, Migraine,Just leaves makes me more tired.  Have tried Imitrex & Naratriptan but they make me so sick to my stomach after taking_ headache worsens & the headache lasts for hours.,Maxalt usually works within the hour after taking & only a few times did I have take another one within the same day.  Problem is my insurance WILL NOT cover Maxalt & been forced to take one of the other medications.  Looking forward when the patent is up & hopefully a generic can be made that one can afford even if out of pocket.  The cost know is prohibitive & have been looking into Canada just so I can have a Maxalt in reserve since the other medications do not compare & take TOO LONG to work,F,58,1  daysMG 2X M,6/18/2012,Maxalt

45, 4, Migraines,Felt intoxicated_ declined motor skills_ gallbladder attack Was prescribed maxalt due to horrible migraines. Military doctor decided it was the route to go. It works great_ kicks in around 30 minutes after taking. Only problem is if you already have gallbladder problems it could trigger a gallbladder attack. An hour after I took 10mg I have had the worst gb attack so far. But I'd say relieving the migraine was worth it.,,F,20,1  days10mg,2/21/2012Email,Maxalt

47, 5, Chronic daily severe Migraines,Originally 1 10mg MLT worked well 8-5 yrs ago. Have been to Mayo Clinic and re-bounds have been a question. Times can go days without. As I get older(hormone changes) seems I have longer frequency per episode where total daily amount of 30 mgs barely touches overall pain. Have had to start ketorolac shots at home if 30mg dose doesn't fully work. This is way better than going to ER and paying them $$$ for the same anti-inflammatory shot. No luck on preventatives. Waiting for industry to come out with a different medication that may help.,,F,40,8  years10MG X 3,2/2/2012,Maxalt

As soon as I injected I would feel a thump in my heart and sudden intense tingling throughout my body_ vomit and then the headache would go away_ but often come back.I only took @ 5 injections over 6 months or so (have terrible fear of needles at at the time only way to get it)   @ 1 year after beginning to take Imitrex. I suddenly developed SupraVentricular Arrhythmias_ As another reviewer reported_ I could not walk up stairs_ I was forced to begin taking beta blockers_ I could not go out alone with my 2 year old_ for fear of fainting--it seriously affected my way of life. I repeatedly mentioned the above reactions to Imitrex to MDs who shrugged any correlation off.  Approximately 5years later they arrhythmias mainly went away although it shows up from tim,I took ONE DOSE A MONTH AGO. FOR THE PAST MONTH I have been experiencing a horrific side effect--SEVERELY DECREASED MENTAL SHARPNESS_ MEMORY IMPAIRMENT_ CHANGES IN SPEECH     I am never taking this drug or any related drugs again.

52, 2, migraines,Drowsiness,Maxalt was great until it stopped working.  The first few times I took it it quickly got rid of my headache.  It was the first time I ever felt true relief from a migraine without suffering for hours.  I was taking it for two months and then it randomly stopped working.  My doctor said I was taking it too much and that my body had built  a tolerance to the medication.  I get migraines pretty often so this definitely was not the right medication for me.,F,26,2  months 6X M,12/9/2011,Maxalt
53, 5, Migraines,Maxalt has been a miracle drug for me. I've had migraines since I was 8 years old. I have tried everything_ but Maxalt is the only drug that knocks out my migraine in less than an hour and I am still able to function. No more going home and getting in the bed. It does make me groggy and my throat does tighten up some_ but I'll take that any day over the pain of migraines!!,,F,43, 10 1X AN,12/8/2011Email,Maxalt
54, 5, Migraines every 3 or 4 days,Mild sleepiness_ increased urination.

56, 5, Migraine Headaches,Frequent urination first few hours after taking MLT tablet.  Issues with concentration and memory.  Need to have food in stomach or I have trouble keeping it down.  I hate the bad taste I get in my mouth from the orally disintegrating tabs - which doesn't help the nauseous feeling.,I get the feeling similar to my head being wrapped in cotton -which is by far better than the pain of a migraine.  I tried for years to not take a Maxalt until I couldn't stand the pain...this is NOT the correct way to take it!  As others mentioned_ take it at the first sign of a migraine_ for me that is a stiff neck and disturbed sleep as well as highted sence of smell.  I found I am able to do just as well with 1/2 a pill_ however I am petite and only weight around 100 lbs.,F,54,10  years10 mg 4X D,10/25/2011,Maxalt
57, 5, migraine,nausea but Im not sure if it is from the medication or my gerd,This the only medication that has ever helped me_ the doctors like to put people with migraines on blood pressure meds even if you dont have high blood pressure I didn't want to take that route so I thank GOD that I was introduced to Maxalt.

59, 1, Chronic Migraines,I experienced extreme nausa_ numbness and tingling in my left foot and hand_ lightheadedness_ dizziness_ vision blurring_ couldn't walk or sit up at first without feeling worse then after I passed out for 2 hours I could walk & sit up but was falling back down. I was also slurring my words and not making any sense whenever I talked. Basically after I passed out_ I felt really high (on something harder then marijuana).,"Maxalt made my migraine worse. I took this the night before (9/26) and I couldn't get up to go to school today (9/27). When I started to feel high_ I was saying the craziest things like ""I wonder what it would me like if my hands were the opposite wrists."" Who says that unless they're high ?

61, 5, chronic migraine,Ive mostly had no side effects.  Occasionally it makes me feel a bit sleepy_ but not all the time.,Miracle drug.  The cost is way too high- about 30 us dollars per pill.  Apparently drug companies change the formula of these medications every few years to keep them from going generic.,M,36, 10mg 1X D,9/15/2011Email,Maxalt
62, 5, Migraines,Extremely tired about 1/2 hour after taking it.  A little tightness in my chest.  Sluggish for the first few hours.,This medication has been the best thing to ever happen to me.  I've had migraines at least once or twice a month since I was 12 years old (I'm now 28).  They usually last 3-6 days.  The one drawback of using this is that I can only take it for one or two days in a row or I get rebound headaches that perpetuate the migraine.  I've tried Imitrex_ but that makes me feel like I've been hit by a bus and made the headaches even worse.  There are almost no side effects for me with taking Maxalt other than sleepiness.  Occasionally it doesn't help for menstrual migraines.  For me this drug seems to last an unusually long time.  I can take one and the migraine is gone for 10-12 hours.  My doctor told me it usually only lasts for a few hours with most people.  I can't live without it.,F,28,2  years 1X AN,9/6/2011Email,Maxalt

64, 5, Migraines,Feel a bit drowsy_ a little nauseous.,It's been a life saver for me. The side effects are nothing compared to the symptoms of the migraine_ so for me it's a small price to pay. I don't understand why some people have commented that this drug should be taken off the market because they have experienced more severe side effects and were scared or rushed to the ER. Don't comment that it should be taken off the market because you've had a bad experience with it_ because there are millions of people who've taken this medication and have gotten their lives back. There was a time when I was getting up to 18 migraines a month_ unable to work and spending the majority of my time on the bathroom floor. Maxalt gave me my life back. For those who say it should be pulled from the market--you need to find an alternative treatment and allow those of us to continue taking a med that works for us_ and somewhere along the way_ get yourself a dose of compassion_ common sense_ and rationality.,F,43,10  years10 mg 1X AN,7/26/2011,Maxalt

66, 2, chronic daily migraines,first got bad chest pain the 2nd dose of it_ continued on from there. Pain made it extremely difficult to take large breaths and continued for nearly a month after I stopped taking it. It made me extremely drowsy all the time_ instead of always being tired from the migraines_ it was more of a half and half split (I think). Drowsiness made me very out of it_ more forgetful_ falling asleep midday; I went around in kind of a daze while I was on it.,As a fair point_ the neurologist that prescribed the drug did so without paying attention to the fact that daily migraines should not be treated by only abortive medication. I do not believe this med should be taken daily under any circumstance.,F,17,3  weeks10 mg 1X AN,7/16/2011Email,Maxalt

72, 5, Migraines,Truly a miracle for my migraines.  Within 30 minutes of dosage the migraine is gone.  I just need to sleep for about an hour and then I am fine.

73, 3, Migraine,The side effects depend on when I take the drug in relation to the state of my migraine. If I take the drug immediately at the on-set of a migraine_ it typically eliminates the pain within 20 minutes with minimal fatigue. I am not always able to take the medication within this fashion. The onset of my migraines are quick...first symptoms to full blown pain within 10 minutes...therefore_ if I take the medication once the pain is severe_ then it may take an hour or more for the pain to subside. If the pain does not subside after an hour_ I typically take a second Maxalt. Side effects of the drug_ when taken in this fashion_ include fatigue and trouble focusing. I am also plagued with feelings of lethargy for several hours after taking the medication.,,F,33,12  years10 MG 1X AN,4/9/2011,Maxalt

78, 4, frequent migraines,tired_ but good tired_ like after a long workout. Possible rebound headaches?,This drug has been so helpful! It sometimes works well on its own but when combined with Tylenol I find my migraine is gone within 15 minutes. I can actually feel the pain draining away. Amazing! My only concern is that more often than not_ the headache returns within 12-16 hours and I end up dealing with it for days at a time. It's hard to know if Maxalt just postpones the migraine and prolongs it_ or if I would have had 5 days worth of pain anyway. Still_ it's fantastic to be able to stop a migraine when I need to (like important family events) even if it does come back later.,F,46,1  years10 mg 1X AN,2/25/2011,Maxalt

I get migraines almost everyday. A little sleeping the next day but nothing major_  I use to take 8 to 12 tylenol or ibpro everyday so imagine how my body felt_  Im down to 2-4 a day now thanks to Maxalt. Kind of expensive but here's a helpful tip_  order them from kanada. I get 40-10mg Maxalt for $400_  which is better then paying $400 for 12-10mg Maxalt at CVS!

It did make me really tired_ but I was still able to be productive at work_ which I wasn't able to be when I had a bad migraine. It's been a long time since taking it because my headaches (which I think were stress-related mostly) went away for a while. I recently began getting them again and they've been interfering with my job_ so I requested a prescription from my doctor_ which he wrote. However_ the pharmacist showed concern when I tried to get the prescription filled. He would not administer the drug without receiving a direct request from my doctor.

Went to er and they continued tests including a ct scan and angiogram. Heart is good_ has to be Maxalt. I was in the hospital 3 days.  I was given nitroglycerin just in case and told to be careful but could try Maxalt again if I needed. I had an extreme migraine (Nitroglycerin gives migraines!) after coming home and took a Maxalt. Within a half hour_ headache was gone_ but chest pains began. They went from small_ crampy pains to increasing pressure toward the center of my chest_ then I took the nitro which relieved those pains. I got a sharp horrible neck pain at the base of my skull which continued for 4 days. So I am told at this point it is an allergic reaction to the drug.,I have successfully taken Maxalt for years! It works for me on one dose_ and within 30 minutes. This incident was amazing and horrible. I now realize that I have had small chest pains for about a month_ and I have taken it 3 times this month.

I usually take the dissolving tablet_ and then lie down in a darkened room.  When it works (which is most of the time)_ it's like magic:  I wake up with NO headache at all.

The first two times I took Maxalt I went straight to bed so I did not notice these side affects.  I would not take this medication at work again (where I took it the third time)!

Migraines are usually accompanied by visual disturbances_ nausea_ numbness in the face or body_ cloudy thoughts and trouble speaking_ as well as the pain behind or between the eyes. I always get visual disturbances (called an aura) before the migraine starts. That's when I take Maxalt_ and it really does help me avoid the migraine from becoming severe. Usually the aura disappears and I get a very slight ache around the eyes (which would have otherwise developed into a fullblown migraine). I recommend this even if it only alleviates symptoms.

I've tried every migraine medicine under the sun and found the only thing that worked was taking some muscle relaxers_ a Vicodin_ and literally spending the entire day(s) in bed sleeping_ until I tried Maxalt.  Maxalt has seriously been a life-saver!  If I'm able to catch the migraine early enough one pill will take care of the migraine.  If it's particularly bad I take a Maxalt and a pain pill (usually Vicodin) and the migraine will be gone by the end of the day and allow me to stay at work and do my job.  If you suffer from migraines and find no help with other drugs_ suggest this to your Neuro or primary doctor.  The pills are costly (figures_ right?) but worth every penny to get your life back.

120, 2, migraine,Horrendous side effects. Felt like I was under anesthesia--this was on only 1/2 dose. Speeding heart rate and respiration_ unable to think or function_ falling into dead sleep_ then hung over for another 1.5 days. Did it make migraine go away? yes_ but the cost has been far too great. I will not take it again tho I did take it reluctantly for about 1 year for migraines that steadily increased--possibly due to the drug.,,F,49,1  years,10/8/2009,Maxalt
121, 1, Migraines,Worsened headache_ tightening in the jaw_ dry mouth_ drowsiness,I had terrible side effects from Maxalt. I first tried the melts and when I reported back my side effects I was prescribed the tablets. While the tablets were less severe_ they still made me feel terrible. They made me drowsy and incapable of functioning in everyday life. My migraines come every single day and I have yet to find a cure for them but Maxalt makes them beyond intollerable and I had to stop taking it.,F,19,2  months,9/27/2009,Maxalt
122, 5, Migraines,slight floating feeling,Thank you so much for this product. Nothing else I had tried worked for me.My migraines start usually in my neck and then the noise around me starts the onset. I take half of a tablet and within 30 minutes the migraine starts to subside. It is rare that I have to take a whole tablet. By taking only half allows me to function at work and does not make me drowsy.,F,48,5  years,9/18/2009,Maxalt
123, 5, migraines,frequent urination in the first couple of hours after taking it_ fatigue,This is a miracle drug that truly works for my migraines.  Within about 40 minutes they are about 85% better and it allows me to function all day at work.,F,40, ,9/16/2009,Maxalt
124, 5, moderate to severe migraines,drowsiness_ neck pain,I have been on MANY maintenance medications to try to control my migraines (for about 12 years) and other headaches but Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked consistently for me. I do not take it daily but only when I feel a migraine coming on. Occasionally I experience some rather uncomfortable neck pain about 20 minutes after taking the dissolveable Maxalt but that is more than worth getting rid of a migraine. Migraines used to completely incapacitate me but now I can have a life! :),F,31,5  years,9/7/2009,Maxalt
125, 4, Menstrual Migraines,"Fatigue_ feeling a bit lightheaded and ""out of it_"" frequent urination",This is the only medication that has helped suppress my migraine. The migraine does come back eventually -- I would say it suppresses for about 8-10 hours. I usually take about 4-5 per bout and have one bout a month. With this regimen_ I only have bad migraines a few times a year_ and that is when I don't take the Maxalt in time.,F,28,2.5  years,9/4/2009,Maxalt
126, 5, Migraines,Mild drowsiness.,Fast-acting_ usually bringing relief in less than two hours depending on the severity of pain at the time it is taken.

127, 5, Severe Migraines,Side effects were minor_ tired_ out of it_ trouble concentrating_ increased pulse.,This medication has helped me so much.  If I take it early on my headache is gone within 15-20 minutes.  If I take it too long after the onset of the migraine_ my migraine gets worse for about an hour then goes away completely.  I have used this 18 times_ there was one time when I had a very sever migraine that this medication did not work at all_ that was the first time I used it.  Since then it has been incredible.  They have really changed my life.,F,28,4  months,8/4/2009,Maxalt

I'd been taking Maxalt for years as it worked well on my headaches.  But_ this time_ it caused this problem_ which the literature says is rare.  Usually_ after about an hour_ the Maxalt makes the headache stop.  This time_ after about an hour_ a tightness developed in my chest and continued to get stronger till it was painful. Three days in hospital including an angiogram.  They say the damage done to my heart is minimal.  :-)  No more Maxalt for me_ though.Would I recommend it?  I'd say it worked for me for years.  I'd say_ ""Be cautiously on the alert for side-effects."" and tell them what happened to me.",M,56,4  years,7/15/2009,Maxalt
129, 4, Chronic migraines,Extremely tired_ dizzy_ tingling over whole body_ very out of it_ swollen throat and pain between the eyes.,I reccomend this drug.

I don't recommend driving or operating machinery as well as drinking after taking this medication.,F,18, ,7/9/2009,Maxalt
130, 5, migraines,none,MaxAlt is a lifesaver.  I have the melts_ which taste horrible to me_ with me at all times.  I get migraines due to stress_ but also because of changes in the weather.

142, 5, migraine,frequent urination_ some drowsiness_ body is tender to the touch everywhere,I love maxalt_ it has been a life savor I have been using it for atleast 5 years_ I have had migraines since I was 19 used imitrex and zomig previously they would work but had the tightness in the chest and it would take much longer to take effect.  Maxalt works within 30 minutes if I catch my migraine soon enough_ a little longer if I wait to long to take.  I prefer the pill_ the dissolveable makes me more nauseated.,F,34,5  years,3/25/2009,Maxalt
143, 1, Chronic Migraines,Difficulty breathing_ tightness in the esophagus_ chest pains_ rapid heart beat_ increased elimination_ dizziness_ rebound headache_ fatigue/weakness,DO NOT EVER TAKE THIS MEDICATION! I've taken a lot of pills for my headaches but this is by far the worst and the most scary. I spent 6 hrs. in the ER because of this drug and I'm still experiencing malaise as a result. I'm just waiting for the side effects to wear off; I threw the medicine away. I'd much rather suffer through a migraine than go into anaphylaxis from taking the drug that was supposed to help me. I think better research needs to be done regarding this medicine.,F,20,1  times,3/10/2009,Maxalt
144, 5, I take Maxalt for Migraine Headache,Upbeat_ Strong penis.,"My doctor recommended Maxalt. She gave me some free samples and boy what a relief. It is like night and day. I usually get two headaches every week_ if I am lucky a whole week will go by without me getting a headache. Migraine headache usually affects my whole lifestyle in a negative way_ and is triggered if I miss a meal or two_ drink alcohol_ smell certain foods or fragrances. I sometimes play cheap_ so I wait to see if ""incoming headache signs"" will go away before I take a maxalt_ rarely it does. If it doesn't and the headache starts getting severe_ it usually is too late to take a maxalt. Pill or no pill the headache will be in full effect_ vomiting and all. It really sucks. My migraine headache usually comes with upset stomach and a strong pain on the forehead_ just above_ between the eyes. If I take the Maxalt as soon as I get the first sign_ it works perfect. I always have one in my pocket or car. I refuse to leave",M,44,4  years,3/4/2009,Maxalt

148, 5, Migranes,Tired and dizzy,I don't actually think these are side effects of the medicine.  I think they are side effects of having a migrane.  I used to take Vicoden to relax me to sleep so I could naturally get rid of my migrane.  I still had these symptoms before I started MAXALT. I used to vomit and spend a whole day in bed before this medicine and now I can function well after only a couple of hours,M,21,1  years,2/6/2009,Maxalt

150, 5, Hormonal Migraines,Frequent urination_ but I think this helps by unloading fluid volume which might be causing increased pressure within the head.  Just a suspicion_ as I have not read that in the medical literature.  No other side effects.,"Taken immediately upon start of a hormonal migraine_ it starts to work in about 2 hours 10 minutes_ to 2 hours 30 minutes_ or not at all depending upon how rapidly my migraine ""escalates"" before the maxalt is through the blood-brain barrer and starting to work.  I sometimes have a very rapidly escalating migraine that causes sudden projectile vomitting/diareah_ upon which all oral meds are flushed from my system and will not work. It is my favorite TRIPTAN because it is rapid acting.  For my hormonal migraines_ it keeps the headache at bay about 13 hours_ whereas Frova keeps it at bay longer_ but has a longer onset of action for me.",F,52,10  years,1/25/2009,Maxalt
151, 5, Migraines,A little tired,Have been taking for about 2-3 years now and to me is a miracle drug.  I love it!  I've had migraines since in high school and this is the only drug to work!  I can live with being tired for a little bit since I can at least still function.  I am useless with a migraine and those sometimes last for up to a week.    Remember_ this is a drug that works on your vascular system as it reduces swelling of the blood vessels in your brain that are causing the migraine.  It only makes sense that it would effect other vascular areas besides the brain.  For me_ it is worth the risk.,F,40,3  years,1/21/2009,Maxalt
152, 5, frequent migraines,I have had no side effects.,Maxalt has been  a lifesaver to me.  I take about 8 per month at the first twinge of aheadache.  It started to lose it's effectiveness for me several years ago and so my Drprescribed Propranolol to be taken every day.  This_ in conjunction with the Maxalt usewhen I feel a headache coming has proved VERY effective.,F,61,8  years,1/17/2009Email,Maxalt

154, 4, Migraines,The most prevalent side-effect was intense thrush! Oh my God. It was horrible. I mostly felt it at the back of my head_ but then I began to feel it in my chest_ neck_ and face_ like they were on fire! I concur with some of the other reviewers that it causes chest tightness and a pressure-like feeling. I feel this particular symptom around my sternum and it last for about two hours. It also causes extreme exhaustion if you need to take two. I do find that there is some groggy/cloudyness with this medication as well. I don't necessarily feel disoriented_ just tired and unmotivated. It takes about two hours for these side effects to pass. At that point the migraine is gone.,Thankfully one pill will usually get rid of my migraine_ but there are occasions when I've needed to take two_ usually consecutively after discovering that the first one didn't work. It successfully gets rid of the migraine_ but some of the side effects are just unpleasant. I am giving it a 4 because it does help_ but I really can't stand the side-effects. I get migraines about once a month_ but they are totally debilitating. I first tried Imitrex but the thrush with that was unbearable. My doctor said it has something to do with the increase in blood circulation. Now I only take it when it's extremely painful. I still would prefer an analgesic narcotic_ which are sure to work and not make you feel like crap_ but my doctor won't prescribe them for my migraines.,F,28,2  years,1/5/2009,Maxalt
155, 4, frequent migraines,None.,Until two years ago_ Maxalt was a guarantee to relieve my migraine within 1-2 hours.  No side effects (drowsiness_ nausea_ heart problems_ etc) - can function normally.  Lately_ it sometimes doesn't work and I need to take a 2nd pill.  Also_ recently getting more clusters (3 or 4 days straight with migraines)_ and I wonder if there is a rebound phenomenon with it_ or reduced effectiveness after using it so long.  I take about one hundred tablets per year now.,M,41,8  years,12/31/2008,Maxalt

157, 1, migraine,"vomiting_""pressure feeling in eyes_headache on left side_ anxiety_ depression_ went to sleep for 24 hours!!!",Maxalt is an expensive and scary medication! The side effects are very serious and life threatening! When I have had migraines in Argentina I had a medication that worked excelent. It was a combination of medications that work with the different symptoms of the migraine. But here in Canada it doesn't exist. I have been having migraines since 21 years old. They are hormone related. I have them every 2 weeks. I hope to find something useful to treat them soon. I am tired of having my life interrupted by them.,F,43,2  weeks,12/7/2008,Maxalt
158, 4, Migraine,A little loopy like some people have said_ very groggy_ sometimes an upset stomach with diarrhea but not very often.,This drug is really a lifesaver. If I feel a migraine coming on_which lately is in the evening_ so I take it at night_ which is great because then I sleep like a baby and wake up clear headed.  I'm afraid I'm having rebound headaches with it now becaues I've had to take it so often.  One other thing_ I've read on this board about esophagus tightening_ and I experience that sometimes without actually being on Maxalt_ but wonder if it's because I've been taking it for about 3-4 years now. If water goes down the wrong pipe_ or sometimes just spit going down the wrong pipe will cause my airway to constrict and I can't breath very well... I've scared myself and my family to death. If I relax it finally loosens up and then I'm fine. But I am getting worried about this now after reading other posts.,F,51,4  years,12/4/2008,Maxalt
159, 3, migraine headache,throat/esophagus tightness_ frequent urination,today was my first time taking Maxalt for a migraine headache. I have taken Fioricet in the past with relief and no adverse side effects. My doctor prescribed Maxalt 2 weeks ago and this was the first headache since. Within the first hour I experienced frequent urination ( felt as if I had taken a diuretic). The headache did go away almost completly within 1-2 hours_ but my throat and esophagus felt like something was stuck in it_ even now over 12 hours later_ i still have this uncomfortable sensation. I do not think that I will take it again; reading about too many scary side effects.,F,44, ,11/28/2008,Maxalt

I tried them all when I found out that I'd probably been having migraines all my life.  This is the one that completely fixes the headache if I get the meds into me as quickly as possible. I usually wake up with the headache and if I take the maxalt and have coffee and breakfast_ I'm usually fine_ except_ as I said_ for a slightly cottony feeling in my head. I can do all my activities after taking this.  Interestingly_ though_ my acupuncture treatment seems to remove the headaches completely and since this medication is ridiculously expensive ($110 for six pills right now where i live on my health plan) I am doing the acupuncture again to get rid of the headaches.

I tried every headache product on the market_ special diets_ vitamins_ etc.  Nothing worked till I was given Maxalt.  Without Maxalt_ my work life would have been over. I would have had no pension and been on welfare.  I had gotten to the point where I could not work 2-3 days per week_ plus I never knew when a headache was coming so couldn't plan anything.  Many momentous family events had been ruined by the headaches.  The headaches would last for 16 hours_ during which time I wanted to commit suicide.

So my Doctor did recommend this to me and I felt like a million after taking it _..... Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!,F,39,5  days,4/18/2008,Maxalt
181, 5, Migraine,Brief fatigue,I wonder if some of the people who this doesn't work for have true migraines.  I believe it's a vasodilator - the veins tighten up (constrict) and blood just can't get through_ so Maxalt dilates them and thus relieves the migraine.  It's not a pain killer.  So if it's not an actual migraine you're experiencing_ Maxalt most likely won't help.  If you have a true migraine you probably agree that any degree of fatigue or dizziness is worth getting rid of that pain.  I'm convinced that I could not function/survive without a drug that is a vasodilator.  Pain killers and anti-inflamatory drugs do almost nothing for my migraines.,F,39,8  years,4/11/2008,Maxalt
182, 4, migraine,flushed face_ sluggishness_ had to pee every twenty minutes for an hour and a half_ got real thirsty.  I have been taking this drug for several years and never has anyone mentioned frequent urination_ but this ALWAYS happens when I take this pill.,"It works for my migraines_ the dissolvable pill makes me want to vomit so I take the tablet.  I am ""stoopid"" sometimes on them_ but also my pms makes me feel this way_ and my migraines are hormonal_ so..........?  I am concerned about long term effects and becoming immune to this drug.",F,44,4  years,4/9/2008,Maxalt
183, 1, Migraines,sleep_ heavy drugged feeling_ slurred speech_ clumsiness_ feeling like my whole body is too heavy to move.  Effects last 2-4 hours.,I hate this drug. I'd rather have the migraine and drink a liter of cola. The doctor told me I might feel mild dizzyness lasting no more than 15 minutes.  I can't take this drug during the day_ when I need it_ because I can't function for at least an hour when I've taken it. Thank goodness the first time I took the Maxalt it was a Saturday and I didn't have to go anywhere. I could have killed someone if I got behind the wheel of a car after taking this drug.,F,31, ,3/30/2008,Maxalt
184, 5, headaches,"a little ""out of it""_ but that went away after 10-15 minutes",i just started taking maxalt 10mg after taking relpax 40mg (which worked for a while_ but stopped; i think a became tolerant of it). after a few minutes_ a numbness washes over my brain (i don't know any other way to describe it) and within a half hour_ the headache is gone. it's a miracle! i haven't had a severe headache yet after i got the prescription_ so i don't know its effect/abilities on headaches that aren't minor.,F,19,1  weeks,3/25/2008,Maxalt
185, 5, migraines,drowsiness_ faigue_ need to take a nap after using second dose,I've been using the dissolvable tab with good success over the last eight years.  Often need to take a second tab 1/2 hour-1 hour after initial dose to get rid of H/A. Oral pill does not do anything for me_ unfortunately. I have no insurance and price is a huge factor in how many migraines i can afford to treat.,F,49,8  days,3/10/2008Email,Maxalt

187, 5, migraines,,I LOVE THIS MEDICINE! I have been taking it for 6 months now. However_ after I took it the first three times I didn't have another migraine for about three months when I was having one almost every other week! It has been an absolute miracle for me! I can take it and within 20 minutes my migraine is GONE! I do get somewhat sleepy with it_ but like other people are saying that's a VERY small price to pay compared to the pain I would have without this medicine. I would definately recommend this medicine!,F,18,6  months,2/24/2008,Maxalt
188, 4, suicide migraines,THE MAIN SIDE EFFECT WOULD BE MEMORY LOSS. ESPECIALLY WHEN ON THE MEDICATION_ CAN NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SAID TO ME OR ANYTHING I HAVE WATCHED ON TV.,STARTED OUT WITH THE ONES THAT MELTED ON TONGUE_ BUT TONGUE WOULD START TO BURN AFTER TAKING IT_ HAD TO SWAP TO THE PILL. MOST OF THE TIME THE MAXALT WORKS_ WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS_ BUT IF THE MIGRAINE DID NOT GO AWAY_ WOULD HAVE TO TAKE LORCET.  I HAVE HAD MIGRAINES FOR 18 YEARS_ AND OUT OF ALL THE PRESCRIBED DRUGS I HAVE TAKEN IT IS BY FAR THE BEST.,F,51,10  years,2/12/2008,Maxalt
189, 3, menstral migraines,tight chest_ dizziness and nausea.,does not work very well. my headaches are bad and last at least 5 days starting sometime within the first couple days of my period. maxalt can take the edge off so i can function somewhat but if i take it at the first sign of headache it just delays the headache and the headache still gets me at night and i wake up with it in full swing the next day. Once in full swing the maxalt only takes the edge off a bit. if i take a second dose an hour after an apparently ineffective first dose_ then i get high blood pressure and terribly spacey although the pain subsides a bit.,F,51,1  years,2/7/2008,Maxalt
190, 4, Migraines,Lack of focus_ fatigue,I've had varying results with Maxalt but it's dependant on when I take the drug (beginning_ during) The dissolvable tablets work 100% better for me than the pill did. The lack of focus and fatigue are small prices to pay for not having to spend 2 days in bed!,F,24,2  years,1/3/2008,Maxalt
191, 1, Occasional Severe Migraines,MORE Migraines!,I began taking it two years ago for severe migraines I had every six months or so.  Immediately after I started_ my migraines increased to once a month and then twice a month and so on.  By the second year_ I was having them twice a week.  I'm now on Inderal to prevent the migraines.  I would NOT recommend this drug.  It also did not work very well as a painkiller.  It just slightly reduced the severity of the migraine pain.,F,34,2  years,1/3/2008,Maxalt
192, 5, Migraines,None at all.,After I had a migraine for 4 days and was taking either fioricet or vicodin for the pain with no relief_ my neurologist recommended Maxalt. I was very leery of taking a new drug when my pain was so bad_ so I waited until day 5. I woke up with a horrid headache_ took the Maxalt and put a cold compress on my head. FIFTEEN minutes later I was completely pain-free. i could not believe it. I could feel nothing. It is the best migraine medicine I have even taken_ and I have had migraines since I was 13 (I am 35 now.),F,35,1  days,12/18/2007,Maxalt

195, 3, Migraine,I didn't like it really...I took it and a couple of hours later I had a kind of severe short term memory loss as well as drowsiness followed by a disoriented state of being. It did take the migraine away_ it just scared me with the side effects in doing so.,I've seen where a lot of other users have complained about the whole memory loss thing_ so that might just be something to look into before taking it.,M,18,1  days,11/20/2007,Maxalt
196, 1, Migraines,I was ok for about 12 hours after taking the Maxalt. I was a little loopy and flushed but the headache for the most part was gone. I still had a lot of pressure in my head but it wasn't taken at the start of the headache. When we started to relax I started having chest pains. They kept getting worse and worse and then I started having pain in my arm. I ended up in the ER until about 3am. The doctor said all my tests came back normal and that it had to of been a side effect from the MAxalt. I will NEVER take it again! The chest pains are far too scary to be worth it especially since it didn't fully knock out the headache.,I am in pretty good shape and had no symptoms that would have made me believe that I would have had chest pains from taking medicine.,F,33,1  days,11/20/2007,Maxalt
197, 5, migraine,heated feeling in my head followed by slight pressure_ still function 100%,slight tripping feeling while looking in the mirror but overall a great drug. It knocks out my headaches in about 30 minutes,M,20,1  months,11/13/2007,Maxalt
198, 4, Allergy & Stress Related Migraine,Haven't really had any...,I take the disolvable tablet...great for on the road.  No water necessary.

200, 1, classic migraines,The medicine extinguished most of the migraine for the first hour_ then go progressively worse after the aura and some of the pain went away. Nauseau_ increased pain_ dizziness_ numbness_ etc... I am very worried that it has had a long term effect on my memory. Literally_ prior to taking this I would be able to retain and memorize information for long periods of time...When someone tells me to remember something or if I need to memorize things for an exam_ or especially when I am reading_ I actually forget everything almost instantenously. Have read the other side effects from users on here and some have said the same thing. Might be worth further investigation of a memory loss side effect.,Would not recommend with thorough research.,F,22,2  times,10/13/2007Email,Maxalt
201, 2, Migraine headache,Taking tablets.  Relieves the pain well and quickly.  About 3-4 hours in_ I have to take a nap_ and 6-24 hours in I feel like I'm coming down from diet pills.  Muscles tensed_ jaws clenched.  Feel edgy and anxious and can't sleep.  I've stopped taking it.,I tried Maxalt 3 times.  I_ too_ was rotating with Zomig and Imitrex and will just use them from now on.,F,59,2  months,9/17/2007,Maxalt
202, 2, continuous headache,Thought I was having a heart attack! And really wasn't a miracle drug for me.

204, 4, Migraines,Feel a little absent minded.  Loopy and some pressure in my forehead.,Took it for the 1st time_ felt pretty good.  I was able to function.  Next day felt a little tired and out of it_ but able to go to work and get through the day. My migraines start a couple of days before my period.  The migraines are so bad_ vomitting and I end up in bed for a day to two.  Horrible_ I need to function!  I have small active children and can lot leave work every time a migraine comes on.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that this is my miracle drug.  I wish the cost was a little less!,F,44,1  days,9/13/2007,Maxalt
205, 3, Migraine,Strangely_ I had a brief two-three minute episode where everything I said resonated in my head as if it were an echo.  General fatigue and relaxation.,This medication_ orally disolving tab_ worked but not as quickly as Imitrex.  It took nearly an hour for the relief.  I'll try the regular pill and see if there is a difference.,F,37,1  days,9/12/2007,Maxalt
206, 3, Migraine,Depends on what other drugs I've taken_ sometimes sleepy_ tired_ mentally dulled; I experienced serotonin syndrome when I used it with nortriptyline.  It always makes my blood pressure go up_ but that time it went up to 212/130.  You should be very careful what drugs you take with triptans.,For me any of the triptans just delay the headache.  If I have a bad migraine and I absolutely have to be somewhere_ then I'll take a Maxalt_ and it almost always works_ but 24 hours later the headache is back and worse than before.  Seems like I have to have my 2-3 days of migraine regardless.,F,61, ,9/10/2007,Maxalt
207, 4, Migraines,"Feeling of being ""high_"" anxiety_ difficulty breathing_ tiredness_ feeling mentally out of it (but still able to work!)",I get migraines mostly around my period and notice a connection between my migraines and shallow breathing. I take 5 mg when I get a headache that feels like it won't go away with relaxation techniques or I'm unable to lie down. My headache generally goes away for at least 24 hours. I'm concerned about rebound headaches_ as I've recently begun getting migraines that seem to last several days and require several doses of Maxalt. How do you know if it's a multi-day migraine or a series of rebound headaches?,F,38,4  years,9/5/2007,Maxalt
208, 5, Migraines,Felt a little intoxicated or spacey for the first hour after I took the medication_ but was still able to work. This medicine actually puts me in a much better mood and reduces my tension tremendously!,After experienceing a bad headache every other day which culminates in a debilitating migraine every weekend_ I finally found something that works while enabling me to still function during the day. I take a tablet every couple days when I feel one coming on and no longer have the horrible migraine on the weekend.,F,32, ,8/31/2007,Maxalt
209, 4, Migraine,It makes me dizzy_ weak_  and little spacey_ which actually helps me sleep.  On the other hand though_ it takes the pain away and I can deal with the mild side effects as long as the pain is gone.  I'm usually useless after I take one and have to go to sleep for the rest of the evening.,I did notice that the migraines increased in frequency for the first week of taking it_ then went back to a normal pattern again. I recommend it for those who have tried Imitrex and other OTC analgesics with no results.  This is the first medicine besides hydrocodone that works on my migraines.,F,25,2  months,8/31/2007,Maxalt
210, 4, Migraines - Menstrual Migraines,Occasional difficulty breathing or heaviness in the chest.  Sometimes euphoria.,It usually takes between 2-5 hours to work depending on how bad the migraine is.  I will try the nasal imitrex to see if it works faster.,F,49,6  months,8/26/2007Email,Maxalt
211, 5, constant migraines,heavy chest_ nausea,Despite feeling a heavy chest sometimes_ or having to throw up_ this has been a miracle drug for me.  I would constantly have migraines that would force me to lay in bed_ in a dark silent room_ sometimes for up to three days at a time with no relief.  This pill cures my migraines in 20-30 minutes and I am able to get on with school_ work_ and my daily life.  I am recovering from two car accidents that left me suffering from migraines as the fruition of different injuries_ and I thank God that this drug is available because it allows me to get on with things.  It works very well and I recommend any people with migraines to try it.  For people who are on any SSRIs_ you cannot take it_ as there is a potentially deadly interaction causing serotonin levels in your brain to become too high.,F,23,1.5  years,8/25/2007Email,Maxalt
212, 5, Migraine,Tired and thirsty,Maxalt has been a wonder drug for me.  I was very ill an average of 14 days per month.

If I have to take 2 pills in the same day or 2 days in a row_ my lower legs_ ankles & feet swell pretty bad & that kind of worries me_ so unless I absolutely have to I don't take doses that close together.

219, 3, Migraine,None for 5 years with hit and miss pain relief results.  Use Imitrex mainly_ Maxalt as backup when out.  Within last year noticed increase in headache pain before relief_ sometimes very severe.  Feelings of being very disconnected_ sense of something very bad happening until migraine breaks.  Last few months Maxalt produces bad anxiety with feeling of impending doom with same hit and miss pain relief.,Stopping medication as side effects have overtaken migraine_ which is a monumental statement considering my migraine pain.  40 years old now and am concerned side effects are due to long term use (suffering since early 20's) and probably narrowing arteries from being the McDonald's generation.  Imitrex does not produce such profound side effects and is much more effective.,M,40,10  years,7/15/2007,Maxalt

The headaches would last for 4-5 days at a time.  I take Maxalt as soon as I can tell that my headache is a migraine and not a ""regular"" headache.

If I wait as little as 20 minutes before taking it it seems to seriously slow progression of the migraine for the rest of the day_ but then migraine is back again by the next day (and progressing)--if I take more the second day it doesn't seem to do much--maybe it results in a less severe migraine but I'm not sure.

Going back to work isn't too difficult. I think this med may have some strange effect on my memory as I sometimes forget simple words/phrases when I take too much (3+ times a week).,F,27,2.5  years,4/4/2007,Maxalt

Plus_ if you can catch the migraine sooner_ you can break the cycle and find yourself free from pain for a much longer period of time. It is indeed expensive_ but I find that the cost is worth the relief. I have never experienced rebound headaches or an immunity to the medication.,F,26,5  years,2/7/2007,Maxalt

After one year of Maxalt use_ my foot pain is permanant and none of the doctors (Primanry care_ podiatrist_ Rheumatologist_ Orthopedic_ Neurologist) after conducting tests like X-Rays_ MRI w/Contrast_ 3-phase bone scan_ vascular ultrasound_ EMG etc._ have been able to diagnose my foot pain. They find it hard to believe that Maxalt can cause such pain_ but I am a living proof. Daily Advil helps the foot pain now. BTW_ I got high blood pressure due to excessive use of Advil. SO now I take beta blocker (Inderal) to keep my BP stable. This keeps the migraine away and consequently Maxalt away. But I am stuck with this foot pain now.,M,38,2  years,4/14/2005,Maxalt
