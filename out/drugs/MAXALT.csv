1, 5, Unrelenting vicious migraines 4 day,Increased urination as migraine desists_ then horrible bone ache throuhout body_ esp spine_ fluid shift from peripheral to central.,There is nothing else that remotely touches the pain_ and if taken promptly_ I will avoid having to take anti-nausea supp. For there is nothing so helpless as when the projectile vomiting begins.,F,66,10  years,6/30/2016Email,Maxalt
2, 3, Migraines,I take the generic Maxalt and although it does take migraine away_ Im always scared of taking it cause of side effects. Chest and throat tightness_ trouble swallowing_ stomach burns_ half my body feels heavy and slight numbness on half of face,I only take this if I really really can't take headache anymore because I hate the side effects of Maxalt. Also_ takes a good 1 hr to start working,F,38,4  months10mg,4/10/2016Email,Maxalt
3, 4, migraines,I usually get about 2-4 migraines a month. Initially exhaustion was the side effect. However_ the last few months I have noticed that my memory is not the same. This is the only prescription medicine I take. My memory is failing. I am 53 yrs old.,I have suffered w/migraines since I was a kid and a migraine  would last up to 72 hours. Initially thought Maxalt was a miracle drug. I take it as soon as the migraine starts. Usually 1 pill (10 mgs) resolves it w/in an hour. Sometimes the migraine is so severe after 2 hours I have to take another dose_ but the 2nd dose always stops the pain & all the other symptoms. When the pain is gone I am usually left w/severe exhaustion & feeling like I got hit by a truck. But since the migraine is gone w/in a few hours I just sleep off the exhaustion. However lately I have noticed that my memory is not the same. Very scary!  Hoping the memory loss is reversible once I stop the rizatriptan.,F,53,3  years10 mg 1X AN,4/9/2016Email,Maxalt
4, 4, Migraines,"Very tired and sluggish_ slow mental response time.  I find that the Maxalt works best with two asprin_ something about the caffine in the asprin makes it work better.  My migraine is usually gone within 1 1/2 hours.  If I do have to take more than 1 for a single migraine I do experience the ""medicine hangover"" the next day.",,F,45,5  years10 MG 1X AN,3/30/2016,Maxalt

6, 5, Cluster headaches,Slightly drowsy but worth it,I take Maxalt generic (Rizact from India) as soon as I feel the onset of early symptoms (light headed_ feel warm_ sinuses drain) and it aborts the cluster. taking it after the cluster is in full pain mode does not work. then I take imitrex inject,M,47,7  days2 x 10mg 1X D,2/25/2016Email,Maxalt

8, 5, Chronic acute rmigraines,With brand Maxalt I had no side effects.  It melted quickly_ had a decent_ minty_ taste and worked amazing_ if taken as prescribed_ at the very onset of migraine.,I'm STUCK with the generic now and I hate it.  The taste is awful and it takes much longer to melt and work.  When I have nausea_ with my migraine_ the foul taste makes me gag.,F,47,5  years10 mg,1/23/2016,Maxalt

10, 5, Disabling migraine,Groggy_ bad taste in mouth_ dry mouth_ visual disturbance and photophobia up to 24 hours after migraine_ hyper sensitive to smell_ change to colour and smell of urine_ foul body odour_ hangover type feeling for 18-30 hours after migraine clears.***i have experienced frightening serotonin syndrome symptoms almost immediately after taking MAXALT when cluster migraines have caused me to miss a dose of SSRI meds***,It clears my migraines better than anything else. If I can take it immediately my pre migraine symptoms occur_ no side effects and only mild migraine develops and clears within  60 minutes. If taking MAXALT once migraine symptoms have begun_ it takes  around 2 hours to clear and puts me to sleep for about 40 mins:but I awake without the severe pain.MAXALT is a godsend for me. At best other treatments only reduce the pain by about half_ and shorten migraine duration to around 24 hours.  The side effects are worth it - except for the serotonin syndrome which is scary; I now keep a dosette box so I can check whether the SSRI has been administered: and if not_ I take it with the MAXALT.,F,49,1  years 2X D,8/31/2015,Maxalt
11, 4, Severe Migraines,I take this med 1-2 times a day PRN (when needed). Typically several times per month.No noticeable side effects.,Works well for my migraines.

12, 5, Migraines,Mild diarrhea occurs the following day. Upset stomach is worse if I take maxalt more than one day in a row. Occasional tightening of the throat or jaw sensation_  but doesn't last as long as it did  with other medications.,Have previously taken Imitrex  and relpax _the maxalt melt tablets work faster and more effectively for me with less side effects.

14, 5, Chronic migraines for 43 years,As many_ I have tried most migraine medication to no prevail until I was prescribed maxalt.  As a child I was hospitalized with chronic migraines and ad I got older 100% of the time a mrgraine ended me in ER. Since using maxalt_ if taken during the first few minutes when vision starts to go fuzzy I can head of most of the horrific systems. I still feel a dull localized pressure and incapacitated for the remainder of the day. I 100% fall asleep and not able to do anything visually maxalt hsd changed my life. I would be violently ill for several day before maxalt and by the next day I function fine but feeling like I have a severe neurological event. I feel a bit slower in thinking and response time and physically a bit fatigued. I can't operate in florescent lighting and I try to keep down stimulus.,I have tried the generic_ however was NOT successful.

15, 3, Migraines for 17 yrs,I usually take one Maxalt_ and then wait about 2 hours and have to take another,Maxalt has been working for me (generally speaking)...but I usually have to take two in order to get relief. My legs and arms feel heavy afterwards and I am unable to drive. I thought that the reason for these quick acting migraine meds is so that you can resume a normal life after a migraine attack? I haven't found one that doesn't leave me incredibly dizzy and tired_ therefore requiring that I take the day off of work anyway. I feel very achy all over_ kind of like how you feel before you get the flu. I felt the same with Relpax_ only worse. Imitrex also.,F,36,1  daysnot sure,6/29/2015,Maxalt

Maxalt only works when I catch the migraine within the first hour. My doctor limits me to six per month with 2 per migraine.

29, 3, Chronic migraines,Always: drowsiness and clumsiness_ varying degreesUsually: Moderate/severe tingling/burning sensation in my nose_ forehead_ and scalp (skin hurts to touch); decrease in mental acuity.,I've had migraines for approximately 10 years_ but as I have gotten older_ they have gotten much more frequent and painful. After getting an ulcer taking only Excedrin for the pain_ I tried both Imitrex and Maxalt. I prefer the Maxalt mainly for the reason that the Imitrex would always give me the tingling sensation_ and the Maxalt only will about 65-75% of the time. However_ I also see a pattern in myself of the medication only getting rid of the migraine 75% of the time; 20% it will dull it but not erase it_ and 5% it doesn't touch it.I'm critical_ but I do think this is a really good medication. My biggest issue is the burning_ which I know not all people experience.,F,25,1  years10MG 1X D,6/17/2013,Maxalt
30, 5, occular and cluster migraines,some chest and neck tightness_ a little drowsy.,I LOVE THIS medicine!!! I have had migraines for as long as I can remember. Imitrex helped_ but the choking sensation and neck discomfort was almost unbearable. Maxalt MLT works so good_ it has given me my quality of life back. My migraines are not menstrual related_ they are related to barometric pressure changes though. I dont know what I would do without this medicine. It is wonderful.,F,46, 10 mg MLT 1X D,4/8/2013,Maxalt
31, 5, migraines,drowsiness_ dizziness_ inability to concentrate for about 2 hours after taking,"I took my first ever dose of Maxalt tonight for a migraine with associated light sensitivity_ neck pain_ nausea. Within 35 minutes my pain was 95% gone_ although I did become very sleepy and felt ""drugged""_ which wasn't ideal since I was at work. Most sleepiness was gone in about 2 hours_ completely resolved by 4 hours after the dose.

32, 3, migraine,I get quite confused after I take it_ and am easily agitated. It gets rid of the pain_ though not as quickly as I'd like_ and I still have a very strong smell sensitivity after taking it_ which is one of my worst migraine symptoms (other than pain). While I do take it to get rid of pain_ I'm hoping to switch to something else_ because the MaxAlt leaves me as unable to work as a migraine does.,I once took it several hours after using alcohol--big mistake. I was completely confused and hallucinating. It did fix the headache_ though...,M,36,8  months10 mg 1X AN,2/25/2013,Maxalt
33, 5, Migraine,I used to wait until I was sure it was a migraine but now at the onset  I take 1/2 of a maxalt-mlt  if not backing off I take more. I don't get as sleepy that way. Still feel something odd at the back of my throat but that's tolerable,,F,50,2  years10 mg,2/14/2013,Maxalt

35, 5, Migraine,Slight fatigue although I think it is a result of severe head pain being removed rather than a side affect of the medication.,This medication has been a God-send! I have no side affects and can take it a work. It has worked every time I take it. No other medication has worked for my migraines than this one. I have tried many others with no relief whatsoever. Unfortunately it is very expensive and my insurance only covers a part. I pay about $10 a pill. But I would be willing to pay $100 a pill for for something that cures my migraine like Maxalt does. I've taken it off and on for over 10 years and it has always worked.,F,49,10  years10 Mg 1X M,12/3/2012Email,Maxalt
36, 5, Migraine,None,After suffering for 25years with migraines and taking various things that barely worked without making one feel awful_ i can't believe how wonderful this little dissolving tab is.  As soon as i feel my neck/head tightening and sometimes already the start of a headache  ( which is my warning to a migraine attack) i take one 10mg tab and usually within 30mins the symptoms have disappeared.  Just pray there'll not be any long-term bad effects from taking Maxalt.,F,65,10  months10mg 1X M,11/28/2012Email,Maxalt
37, 5, migraines,Not sure of any.  Works really well and I get headaches at least twice a week.  Best if taken at night so sleep follows. Often sneeze within a hour of taking which relieves pressure. I can get 30 per prescription versus limit of 10 with Imitrex.  So I never worry about running out because of monthly limit.  Effectiveness has never diminished in years.,,,,6  years5 mg,11/3/2012,Maxalt
38, 3, Migraine with aura,It got rid of my aura_ but never got rid of the headache. I had migraine hangover everyone I took it. I don't like this medication at all anymore because now I no longer get the aura and it makes the pain worse. The only things that work for me now are narcotics.,,F,15,3  years,9/6/2012,Maxalt
39, 5, Migraines roughly 2-3 per month,Slight drowsiness sometimes_ but nothing severe.,I told my doctor I loved him after he prescribed me this medication_ after suffering from my migraines that lasted for 24-48hrs since puberty. So long as I catch it within the first hour_ this tablet will kick it completely. I love that it is dissolving so if I'm already a bit nauseous_ it starts absorbing quickly.,F,30,1.5  years10mg 1X AN,8/31/2012Email,Maxalt

42, 5, Migraine,Just leaves makes me more tired.  Have tried Imitrex & Naratriptan but they make me so sick to my stomach after taking_ headache worsens & the headache lasts for hours.,Maxalt usually works within the hour after taking & only a few times did I have take another one within the same day.  Problem is my insurance WILL NOT cover Maxalt & been forced to take one of the other medications.  Looking forward when the patent is up & hopefully a generic can be made that one can afford even if out of pocket.  The cost know is prohibitive & have been looking into Canada just so I can have a Maxalt in reserve since the other medications do not compare & take TOO LONG to work,F,58,1  daysMG 2X M,6/18/2012,Maxalt

45, 4, Migraines,Felt intoxicated_ declined motor skills_ gallbladder attack Was prescribed maxalt due to horrible migraines. Military doctor decided it was the route to go. It works great_ kicks in around 30 minutes after taking. Only problem is if you already have gallbladder problems it could trigger a gallbladder attack. An hour after I took 10mg I have had the worst gb attack so far. But I'd say relieving the migraine was worth it.,,F,20,1  days10mg,2/21/2012Email,Maxalt

47, 5, Chronic daily severe Migraines,Originally 1 10mg MLT worked well 8-5 yrs ago. Have been to Mayo Clinic and re-bounds have been a question. Times can go days without. As I get older(hormone changes) seems I have longer frequency per episode where total daily amount of 30 mgs barely touches overall pain. Have had to start ketorolac shots at home if 30mg dose doesn't fully work. This is way better than going to ER and paying them $$$ for the same anti-inflammatory shot. No luck on preventatives. Waiting for industry to come out with a different medication that may help.,,F,40,8  years10MG X 3,2/2/2012,Maxalt

As soon as I injected I would feel a thump in my heart and sudden intense tingling throughout my body_ vomit and then the headache would go away_ but often come back.I only took @ 5 injections over 6 months or so (have terrible fear of needles at at the time only way to get it)   @ 1 year after beginning to take Imitrex. I suddenly developed SupraVentricular Arrhythmias_ As another reviewer reported_ I could not walk up stairs_ I was forced to begin taking beta blockers_ I could not go out alone with my 2 year old_ for fear of fainting--it seriously affected my way of life. I repeatedly mentioned the above reactions to Imitrex to MDs who shrugged any correlation off.  Approximately 5years later they arrhythmias mainly went away although it shows up from tim,I took ONE DOSE A MONTH AGO. FOR THE PAST MONTH I have been experiencing a horrific side effect--SEVERELY DECREASED MENTAL SHARPNESS_ MEMORY IMPAIRMENT_ CHANGES IN SPEECH     I am never taking this drug or any related drugs again.

52, 2, migraines,Drowsiness,Maxalt was great until it stopped working.  The first few times I took it it quickly got rid of my headache.  It was the first time I ever felt true relief from a migraine without suffering for hours.  I was taking it for two months and then it randomly stopped working.  My doctor said I was taking it too much and that my body had built  a tolerance to the medication.  I get migraines pretty often so this definitely was not the right medication for me.,F,26,2  months 6X M,12/9/2011,Maxalt
53, 5, Migraines,Maxalt has been a miracle drug for me. I've had migraines since I was 8 years old. I have tried everything_ but Maxalt is the only drug that knocks out my migraine in less than an hour and I am still able to function. No more going home and getting in the bed.

I hate the bad taste I get in my mouth from the orally disintegrating tabs - which doesn't help the nauseous feeling.,I get the feeling similar to my head being wrapped in cotton -which is by far better than the pain of a migraine.  I tried for years to not take a Maxalt until I couldn't stand the pain...this is NOT the correct way to take it!  As others mentioned_ take it at the first sign of a migraine_ for me that is a stiff neck and disturbed sleep as well as highted sence of smell.  I found I am able to do just as well with 1/2 a pill_ however I am petite and only weight around 100 lbs.,F,54,10  years10 mg 4X D,10/25/2011,Maxalt
