1, 2, ,Raspiness in voice to the point of being unable to talk on the phone. Had a few days of dizziness and rapid heart rate as well.,While this helped to relieve the coughing I had experienced_ losing my voice was not an option. The dizziness didnt help either. Was switched to Qvar 80 and that became on even worse nightmare_ (see post at Qvar site).,F,57,1  months2 puffs 2X D,5/22/2014,Pulmicort flexhaler
2, 2, Seasonal asthma from allergies,Irritability and depression,Although this drug helps with shortness of breath I realized it makes me very anxious_ angry and depressed. When I quit taking it_ it took a few days for this to wear off. I wish someone would explain how this can happen. How can a steroid cause depression and irritability?,F,59,10  days 1X D,8/20/2013,Pulmicort flexhaler
3, 2, ,Insomnia_ Borderline High Blood Pressure_ Chest Pain in Pectoral Muscle Area.  Symptoms started after six months and got progressively worse until I had to stop taking it.,"Pulmicort worked very well to control my mild asthma_ which was made worse by a case of pneumonia.  However_ after a year of taking it_ I had to stop due to side effects (insomnia_ borderline high blood pressure and chest pain near pectoral muscles).  For the record_ I never had any of these symptoms before_ and I ignored them for a few months as my (former)pulmonologist and another pulmonologist said that my side effects were not caused by Pulmicort.  As soon as I stopped taking it_ however_ they went away.  Both doctors told me that it is a very small dose which goes directly to the lung and therefore has no systemic effects.  Using this logic however_ inhaling other drugs (like cocaine for example) should have no systemic effects_ which of course is ridiculous.  The manufacturer states that 1-3% have these symptoms but downplays them to the point where it appears that they might not be related to the drug.  After consultanting with a well-respected microbiologist who researches these and other drugs as well as an allergist and my general practioner_ I learned that my side effects were absolutely possible.  Even though the steroid dose is relatively small_ it can build up in your system and cause problems over time.  Fortunately_ my asthma is not bothering me now_ however I would encourage anyone taking this drug and other inhaled steroids to be very careful before assuming that they're safe to ""take for the rest of your life.""",M,44,12  months180 MCG 2X D,6/22/2012,Pulmicort flexhaler
4, 5, asthma,Improved asthma symptoms_ decreased wheezing and coughing. Absolutely no other side effects.,This was the medication that finally let me run without needing any albuterol. And walk in cold weather and not wheeze.,F,25,3  days180mcg 2X D,3/16/2011,Pulmicort flexhaler
5, 1, asthma maintenance,while I could never find a pediatrician to admit that this medicine had side effects_ this made my son at 5_ 6_ 7 years of age have trouble sleeping_ agitated_ quickly became angry_ trouble focusing. I took him off the medicine for 3 months and he was a different kid. Put him back on and it was horrible.,If you are experiencing similar issues_ ask your doctor if your child can take the lower dose of pulmicort. My child ended up switching to the lowest dose of flovent (44) about 90 days ago after trying singulair_ asthmanex_ flovent 220 and flovent 110. They all gave him steroid-like aide effects.,M,8,2  years180 2X D,3/15/2011Email,Pulmicort flexhaler
