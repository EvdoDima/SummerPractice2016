1, 3, Type 2,"Next day or 2 felt ""full"" as if I didn't need to eat. Somewhat of an upset stomach.","As in other comments about the ""lumps"" at injection site--they tell you there will be.  No weight loss yet.  Sugar readings have been on a decline recently.",M,58,2  months 1X W,1/11/2016Email,Bydureon
2, 5, Type 2 Diabetes,Initially_ I was initially injecting at mid-day because that was around the time I got my first injection from the doctor.  The nausea was horrible but I found that injecting before bedtime worked better for me.,my glucose readings were off the chart before I started bydureon.  I can truly say that I'm running in the 90s now_ on average_ versus the high 100s to mid 200s.  I was spiking continuously before starting this medication.  My endo took me off of glipizide and started the bydureon along with Glumetza extended release and I've done a 180 degree turn around.  Yeah_ the needle is a little big and you get those bumps at the injection site (they do go away eventually) but this has made a huge difference in my life!,F,56,6  weeks 1X W,7/23/2015Email,Bydureon
3, 1, To lower the blood sugar.,I had a severe pain in my the right side of my stomach_ up near the waist.,The needle was very large and more difficult to insert.,F,68,1  weeks 1X D,12/9/2014,Bydureon
4, 5, diabetes type 2,no side effects at all,blood sugars went from 180 in morning to 100.was having trouble with mixing medicine in vial without sticking to sides.found out it is caused by taking bydureon out of cold  storage to warm created condensation in vial. I store mine in cold attic area and mix immediately upon removal with great results !,M,62,6  weeks 1X W,1/27/2014,Bydureon
5, 5, Type 2 diabetes,This drug has been wonderful in helping lower my blood sugar.  I was taking Actos which caused me to gain weight and my feet and legs to swell.  Sometimes I do develop lumps after injections but only if I don't alternate injection sites.,,F,60,2  years1x weekly,9/29/2013Email,Bydureon
6, 4, Diabetes,No side effects yet.,If you take the medication out of refrigerator 30-60 minutes or nite before..There is NO pain from injection or needle.  Not long enough to see if it will work well but so far so good.  Mix and shake well.  I thought I was dieing only to find out it was the Victoza_ but now I have a brain tumor.,F,68,3  weeks 1X W,9/23/2013Email,Bydureon
7, 1, Type 2 Diabetes,Lumps at injection sites (The size of a jellybean),I've taken Byetta for some time_ injecting it twice daily. I'd sometimes forget_ or would be somewhere_ without my pen_ and would miss my injection. When my doctor told me that Bydureon was a weekly version of Byetta_ and could be injected without regard to having eaten_ I was all for it. One inject a week_ instead of 14 injections? Yes! Then_ I found hard lumps had formed at each injection site. I didn't notice them right away_ but when I did_ I was alarmed. I discontinued Bydureon and use Victoza now. Weeks have passed since I last used Bydureon_ but the lumps are still there. I've read that they will dissolve over time_ and I certainly hope that's the case. I wish I had done more research on this drug before using it.,M,40,4  weeks2 mg 1X W,2/21/2013,Bydureon
8, 1, type 2 diabetes,Besides the fact the needle so big and painful to inject_ I now have lumps where I injected the medicine. Did not see any changes in my blood sugars. This medication is extremely ridiculously high!,,F,44,1  monthsnot sure,12/20/2012Email,Bydureon
