2, 5, Perimenopause/Panic/Hot Flashes,sore breasts_ periods close together (was pretty much done with periods when starting climara. Had a period 2 weeks after starting and then another one 17 days later). No other side effects.,Started with .025.  Since I'm perimenopause and not in full menopause_ my own hormones shifted after 2 weeks and I got a period (hadn't had one in months). When my period started_ my symptoms came back strong. Woke up with major anxiety_ panic_ hot flashes. Doctor told me to add another patch. Symptoms disappeared that night_ so now I am on .05.  The patch stays on great! I have dry skin_ so that's probably why. I take a cotton ball with alcohol and wipe and dry the area before applying the patch. No problem with it coming off.  Haven't had a panic attack since using this product. Sleep is actually something I get now. I hope I never have to stop this product and I hope it never closes business.

5, 5, menopause,some redness after patch is removed_ but it goes away within a day or two,I had been on Vivelle-dot for two years but never felt completely back to normal. Yes_ it was an improvement vs. no HRT_ but even with the highest dosage of the vivelle-dot it seemed like I needed more. We switched to climara (brand name_ not generic) and I noticed the patch is much bigger. For me_ it has been a miracle patch! All the aches and pains that Vivelle dot reduced but never quite took away_ Climara took away! And it gave me so much more energy and restful sleep. On vivelle-dot I was still waking up every hour or so. Even though both the vivelle-dot and the Climara are .1mg_ for me at least_ the Climara is stronger and I feel so much better! Amazing! Anxiety gone_ eliminated hot flashes_ skin and hair better. Mouth and nasal passages moister. Brain fog gone. However_ I need to replace after 4 full days as I start to feel the low estrogen effects creep in and the headaches start. It doesn't last a full week for me. I wish I had switched to Climara sooner instead of wasting two years on the Vivelle-dot.,F,,2  months.1mg 1X W,4/28/2015,Climara

51, 5, total hysterectomy,Overall after a period of adjustment_ life has been wonderful with this product. I had horrid night sweats_ hot flashes and aggressive mood swings and was on a roller coaster of emotions before using it. After using it about 8 years I thought I'd try to get off of it_ but the hot flashes flared up again_ so I started using it again. Now after 16 years_ I have successfully been off of the product about a week and have been symptom free so far. Side effects were minimal during my use. I did notice when I applied it to my backside where instructed_ I had pain in my sciatic nerve. I remedied this by applying it to my lower abdomen on either side below my panty line and this also kept clothing from rubbing it off. I found that removing it before a shower then making sure the area was completely dry before reapplying helped because any type of moisture trapped beneath the patch prevents it from adhereing well. I did notice even with precautions_ some patches simply would not adhere for the e,Because I have a long list of allergies and for some reason my system will not absorb pill forms of many drugs_ Climara was an answer to a prayer and helped me keep my sanity as well as be a functional person. I realize everyone reacts differently to medications_ however_ I would recommend Climara patches to any woman experiencing post menopausal symptoms.

56, 5, Total Hysterectomy,On the .1 mg I had miserable Migraines daily_ cutting the dosage in half has relieved me of those!,"Honestly_ I have no other drug to compare this too.  I was on Lupron to ""help"" prevent my hysterectomy.  I gave up and had the surgery fearing menopause at my young age.  The fist dosage of 0.1 mg was too much for a migraine sufferer like me.  I was in daily headache hell.  So the switch to .05 mg has been much better.  Yeah_ the little black circle sucks_ but I keep the thing on my butt_ so I don't really look at it.  LOL  I am suffering from the onset of mutliple kidney stones and trying to deterimine if it was the Lupron therapy that did that or just menopause in general.",M,42,3  months.05 mg 1X W,6/17/2010Email,Climara

58, 5," Perimenopause ""issues""",None--I was very pleasantly surprised_ as I usually experience some side effects w/medications.,This patch (not the generic) has been a lifesaver for me...I was experiencing hot flashes (10-12 average per day)_ sleep disruption_ lack of sex drive_ unexplained dark days_ moodiness and a general inability to focus--feeling like I was in a fog_ as others have described it. Almost immediately_ all of the above has disappeared or been greatly reduced (hot flashes are now almost non-existent). The one thing about these patches that no one talks about is the dark muck (skin oils) that accumulate around the edge_ which I dislike and is pretty disgusting. I work out a lot and sweat a lot but shower very often so I don't see a way around this. As far as the patch coming off_ which others have complained about_ I have only had that happen once 2 days before I was due to replace it. I believe that was a result of my tearing off sweaty gym clothes in a hurry....Being in good health and not at high-risk for stroke or other major side effects_ my husband and I are really happy that this is an option for me. Pleased to say also that my sex drive is coming back and my husband isn't afraid that I'll bite his head off as he was for awhile there....,F,52,1  months0.025 1X W,5/15/2010,Climara
59, 4, Supracervical Hyst W/ 1 Ovary rem.,Various,I was on climara back in 2001 (27yoa)after my hyst. I still kept one ovary but was experiencing low estrogen symts. My Dr gave it to me for temp use until my body adjusted after surgery and it was wonderful. Now 9 years later I am in perimenopause. Anxiety_ Nausea_ fatigue_ night sweats_ hot flashes. I was put back on it once I convinced my military drs what was going on i was sure was related to hormones! I am only 34 but had the hysto early. Now that i have been back on it_ i do feel better. Not 100% but getting there. I know it takes several months to level out. I tried to add progesterone cream on my own and it wasnt a good mix for me.Especially since I no longer have a period_ dosing days is tricky. I have no problems keeping the patch on. I often shower 2x a day because of my work out routine. Never comes off_ but on occasion I have had to change it early because the effects seem to wear after 5-6 days. When that happens I get moody_ anxious and hot flashes that feel like my skin is burning. I am hoping to be on it only temp again_ but we will see. I know the risks_ but quality of life means a lot to me. I have a family and they need me too.,F,34,5  weeks.025 1X W,3/25/2010,Climara
