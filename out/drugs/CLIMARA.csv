2, 5, Perimenopause/Panic/Hot Flashes,sore breasts_ periods close together (was pretty much done with periods when starting climara. Had a period 2 weeks after starting and then another one 17 days later). No other side effects.,Started with .025.  Since I'm perimenopause and not in full menopause_ my own hormones shifted after 2 weeks and I got a period (hadn't had one in months). When my period started_ my symptoms came back strong. Woke up with major anxiety_ panic_ hot flashes. Doctor told me to add another patch. Symptoms disappeared that night_ so now I am on .05.  The patch stays on great! I have dry skin_ so that's probably why. I take a cotton ball with alcohol and wipe and dry the area before applying the patch. No problem with it coming off.  Haven't had a panic attack since using this product. Sleep is actually something I get now. I hope I never have to stop this product and I hope it never closes business.

5, 5, menopause,some redness after patch is removed_ but it goes away within a day or two,I had been on Vivelle-dot for two years but never felt completely back to normal. Yes_ it was an improvement vs. no HRT_ but even with the highest dosage of the vivelle-dot it seemed like I needed more. We switched to climara (brand name_ not generic) and I noticed the patch is much bigger. For me_ it has been a miracle patch! All the aches and pains that Vivelle dot reduced but never quite took away_ Climara took away! And it gave me so much more energy and restful sleep. On vivelle-dot I was still waking up every hour or so. Even though both the vivelle-dot and the Climara are .1mg_ for me at least_ the Climara is stronger and I feel so much better! Amazing! Anxiety gone_ eliminated hot flashes_ skin and hair better. Mouth and nasal passages moister. Brain fog gone. However_ I need to replace after 4 full days as I start to feel the low estrogen effects creep in and the headaches start. It doesn't last a full week for me. I wish I had switched to Climara sooner instead of wasting two years on the Vivelle-dot.,F,,2  months.1mg 1X W,4/28/2015,Climara

51, 5, total hysterectomy,Overall after a period of adjustment_ life has been wonderful with this product. I had horrid night sweats_ hot flashes and aggressive mood swings and was on a roller coaster of emotions before using it. After using it about 8 years I thought I'd try to get off of it_ but the hot flashes flared up again_ so I started using it again. Now after 16 years_ I have successfully been off of the product about a week and have been symptom free so far. Side effects were minimal during my use. I did notice when I applied it to my backside where instructed_ I had pain in my sciatic nerve. I remedied this by applying it to my lower abdomen on either side below my panty line and this also kept clothing from rubbing it off. I found that removing it before a shower then making sure the area was completely dry before reapplying helped because any type of moisture trapped beneath the patch prevents it from adhereing well. I did notice even with precautions_ some patches simply would not adhere for the e,Because I have a long list of allergies and for some reason my system will not absorb pill forms of many drugs_ Climara was an answer to a prayer and helped me keep my sanity as well as be a functional person.

I was in daily headache hell.  So the switch to .05 mg has been much better.  Yeah_ the little black circle sucks_ but I keep the thing on my butt_ so I don't really look at it.  LOL  I am suffering from the onset of mutliple kidney stones and trying to deterimine if it was the Lupron therapy that did that or just menopause in general.",M,42,3  months.05 mg 1X W,6/17/2010Email,Climara

58, 5," Perimenopause ""issues""",None--I was very pleasantly surprised_ as I usually experience some side effects w/medications.,This patch (not the generic) has been a lifesaver for me...I was experiencing hot flashes (10-12 average per day)_ sleep disruption_ lack of sex drive_ unexplained dark days_ moodiness and a general inability to focus--feeling like I was in a fog_ as others have described it. Almost immediately_ all of the above has disappeared or been greatly reduced (hot flashes are now almost non-existent). The one thing about these patches that no one talks about is the dark muck (skin oils) that accumulate around the edge_ which I dislike and is pretty disgusting. I work out a lot and sweat a lot but shower very often so I don't see a way around this. As far as the patch coming off_ which others have complained about_ I have only had that happen once 2 days before I was due to replace it. I believe that was a result of my tearing off sweaty gym clothes in a hurry....Being in good health and not at high-risk for stroke or other major side effects_ my husband and I are really happy that this is an option for me. Pleased to say also that my sex drive is coming back and my husband isn't afraid that I'll bite his head off as he was for awhile there....,F,52,1  months0.025 1X W,5/15/2010,Climara
59, 4, Supracervical Hyst W/ 1 Ovary rem.,Various,I was on climara back in 2001 (27yoa)after my hyst. I still kept one ovary but was experiencing low estrogen symts. My Dr gave it to me for temp use until my body adjusted after surgery and it was wonderful. Now 9 years later I am in perimenopause. Anxiety_ Nausea_ fatigue_ night sweats_ hot flashes. I was put back on it once I convinced my military drs what was going on i was sure was related to hormones! I am only 34 but had the hysto early. Now that i have been back on it_ i do feel better. Not 100% but getting there. I know it takes several months to level out. I tried to add progesterone cream on my own and it wasnt a good mix for me.Especially since I no longer have a period_ dosing days is tricky. I have no problems keeping the patch on. I often shower 2x a day because of my work out routine. Never comes off_ but on occasion I have had to change it early because the effects seem to wear after 5-6 days. When that happens I get moody_ anxious and hot flashes that feel like my skin is burning. I am hoping to be on it only temp again_ but we will see.

64, 5, total hystorectomy,I probably have experienced weight gain_ itching around patch_ patch falling off.,I have been very happy with this product. I had a total hysterectomy 6 years ago due to horrible pms symptoms. My doctor had me take Lupron injections for six months to see if this would help alleviate my symptoms. Sure enough...I felt much better when I was not having periods. After my surgery he put me on the patch. And I tease people saying I am worst than a Heroine addict. I must have my patch! If I don't get it I start to become very moody_ irrational and irritable. I have put on about 20 pounds since that time and I never thought about it until I read all of the other comments that it may be due to the patch. I thought it was because of the surgery. I still can keep my weight down with a lot of focus_ self discipline and following weight watchers. The weird thing is that about three nights ago I stopped sleeping so well and started having night sweats. I made an appointment with my doctor for this Friday.

Dosage of 0.075 mg/day eliminated the infections.  Recently a doctor suggested I try to come off the patch as it is intended for short term use.  I must admit I noticed an increase in my libido within a few days_ but also noticed my skin appeared less firm.After 2 months there has not been a reoccurence of infection but due to frequent hot flashes_ night sweats and the associated loss of sleep I have just gone back on. Since I want to use the lowest possible dosage I am cutting the 0.075 patches in half to see if 0.0375 mg/day will be sufficient to get rid of the hot flashes_let me get some sleep and maintain my libido.

66, 5, total hysterectomy,Horrible hot flashes (day and night) and mood swings.,I have used Climara for about 19 years. After my hysterectomy_ at age 43_ the hormone replacement offered by my GYN basically drove me out of my mind.  This patch was prescribed by a specialist GYN-endocrinologist.  Almost immediately I experienced relief from horrible hot flashes and mood swings.  Besides being bio-identical-I believe the only way to go-the patch makes the medications use very easy.  I have recommended this product to many women over the years and will continue to do so. It's great!,F,61,19  years,1/20/2010,Climara

I also seem to be sleeping better - actually have been able to go back to sleep if awakened.  This was not the case before the patch.  Although_ I was not affected by mood swings_ I do seem to notice I feel calmer.  Could be the sleep I am finally getting.  I have not noticed hair loss and will continue to monitor.  As far as the patch staying in place:  I followed a gal's suggestion on this feedback page where she applied the patch at night_ used a hairdryer to make sure skin was dry_ hair dryed the area after applying rubbing alcohol.  She also covered the patch with a transdermal bandage which I believe helps tremdendously.  I work out 6 to 7 times a week_ take lots of showers and the patch has held.

72, 3, complete hysterectomy,Especially hair change. I had beautiful bouncy hair. Now dry and listless. Also_ I feel grey hair has come in heavier than prior to this medication. Lack of sex drive. I was 37 when I had my surgery.,PRior to taking climara_ I was on estradial. Quite a while. Went several years with nothing after that but the sweats and hot flashes were SO severe I finally had to go back to the Dr._ even with the risks_ and go back on something. CLimara was it. The sweats and flashes after a week or so do disappear. However I agree that the patches MOST OFTEN DO NOT stay on for a week. I properly put them on and am careful in the shower or other water activities. Then you cannot refill before its due or the insurance will not pay even if the patch is defective. They do make a patch that you can put on twice a week_ but get this_ the insurance Companies will not pay usual amount. We have VERY good insurance. I even checked into other insurances policies re this problem_ and all were the same. The isurance woulnd't have you go without heart medication_ blood pressure meds. If the 2 X week patch has been prescribed why do they makea you pay higher price. If there were a pill out there you only had to take once a day or 3X a day_ there is NO difference in price re co pay amounts.Most women will go without for that period until you can refill again if the price is 3X usual. That does not help the moods. Positive note though_ I had to see another Dr. re some other health issue and did find out something interesting. I was at the Portland University Hospital and a specialist told me that the medicated patch bypasses the liver as the oral medications DO NOT.

73, 3, Hot Flashes_ Sweats,Bleeding almost non-stop after the 2nd week.  Also after going off the patch heavy bleeding for a week.,The patch was effective for the hot flashes but the heavy bleeding that occured was a lot to take. It was almost non-stop and I also had bloating. I've been off the patch for 4 months. Initally upon stopping I bled heavily for a week. I am having the hot flashes and sweats again but am trying to manage them_ live with them. I've tried a homeopathic remedy suggested by my doctor...lacheses.  It seems to take the edge off.  I discontinued taking these after a time (unemployed and could no longer afford)...probably stopped taking them too soon as it takes time for homeopathic meds to work. When I have insurance again I will try the Climara again at a lower dosage after reading the posts here. I was taking the .045/.015mg dosage_ 7 day patch. Also a side note_ there is no generic for this drug in the U.S. as I am aware. Are the post about a generic for Climara Pro from another country? Very curious.,F,54,10  months,9/20/2009,Climara

Really high blood pressure! Then on 0.5 Estradiol. Still too much! Still high blood pressure. After taking matters in to my own hands_ I was able to come off all replacement therapy and GRADUALLY start from scratch.

110, 5, Radical Hysterectomy,None that I've noticed,***** HELPFUL ADVICE *****  GETTING IT TO STAY ON  *****I have found a little trick that will keep my patch on for quite a while. Do this at night_ before you go to bed.1st...wash the area with warm soapy water...dry skin with a clean towel.2nd...wait a few minutes until your skin is completely dry then rub the area with alcohol.  Again_ dry with a clean towel and wait a few minutes...make sure that your skin is not only dry but that it is the same temperature as the rest of your body.3rd...without touching the patch_ except for 1 tiny part of the edge_ put the patch on and press it tightly against your skin for 15-20 seconds.  Then_ gently rub it for another 15-20 seconds.4th...put on some panties that will snugly cover the entire patch. 5th...Go to bed!!It is extremely helpful to change the patch before you go to bed so it has a chance to fully adhere while you sleep.  Also_ I found that I always had the most luck putting it on my lower belly as opposed to my butt,F,36,2  days,4/27/2008,Climara

I have to have the patch to feel better.  It actually helps my depression_ not makes it worse.  But the patch does come off too soon and sometimes will come off with my clothes.  If they fix this about the patch_ I think it would be a fantastic product_ I will try the tegaderm transdermol patch over it to see if it helps keep it on.  Weight gain is a problem_ but I have lost weight by eating better and working out continually  any suggestions on weight loss and/or keeping the patch on or alternative therapy which may help with hot flashes and not increasing the dosage.

After 2 months of not taking estrogen I was a mess. Went to an OBGYN and she put me on Climara with Prometrium. I loved the Climara patch with prometrium at night.  Most menopause symptoms vanished.  After about 8 months on Climara I noticed my hair started falling out.  at the time I did not connect the hair loss with the patch. I am health conscious_ eat a well balanced diet and exercise 6 x a week.  It is now over 2 years and finally I read that hair loss was a side effect.  I have lost half of my hair.

120, 3, Total hystorectomy,It seems that it helped all of the symptoms immediately that are associated with full menopause.  But I have had many health problems that I am not sure whether to blame the patch or the hystorectomy.  Burning mouth symdrome_ nervous breakdown_ cloudy thinking_ cannot sleep well.  Recently I have started gaining weight and cannot lose it like I used to when dieting.  My stomach hurts and is bloated and my breast are tender.  Now I am becoming nauseated and I am dry heaving.  I am definitely going to come off of the patch and do not no what road to take after that.,It was a better way to go than the pills and helped you to keep your sexual urges but does not help with the dryness.

128, 3, menopause symptoms,hair loss,I have loved this patch for the last 2.5 years I was on it but wanted to try a bio-identical cream.  Went to an endocrinologist and started bi-est cream.  I didn't give it much time and symptoms were back so went off everything!  Thought maybe I could handle this alone.  After two months of misery went back on Climara patch .025 mg.  That was in late June 2007.  I began to notice my hair drying out and now it is falling out.  I have always had a full thick head of hair and now it is noticeably thinner.  That scares me.  Went back to endocrinologist and they pointed out hair loss as a common side effect.  I am thinking about trying the biest cream again.  Any one else having the hair loss?  When I first started the patch I don't recall seeing hair loss as a side effect.  I am wondering if the make-up of the patch has changed so that is now one of the common side effects.  Does anyone know?  I'd love some other opinions.,F,54,3  years,9/6/2007Email,Climara
129, 2, surgical menopause,Would. Not. Stick.,"After a TAH/BSO_ my doctor gave me a generic Climara patch_ manufactured by Mylan. It reeked. It was Big and Thick and Band-aid colored and the glue did not go all the way to the edge - there was a millimeter or two to spare between 'the rim' and 'where the glue begins' and it collected hideous 'belly-button-lint' at the intersect zone...after I took the patch off_ there was always a big nasty gunky ring what would take rubbing alcohol to remove. And::: some of those Climara-clone patches wouldn't stick worth a s*** which is Just Disgusting at $8+ per patch_ eh. GET: the Vivelle-Dot!!!!!!!! instead...is way smaller_ transparent and thinner_ and sticks like a Tick...the glue goes all the way to the edge.

My doctor removed everything. The night after the surgery was pure misery - hot flashes_ deep sadness_ I was overwhelmed. The next morning I put on a Climara patch (0.1 dosage)_ and my life has completely turned around! I'm calm_ happy_ peaceful. I want and enjoy sex. (lucky husband!and lucky me!)The only drawback - the Climara patch doesn't last for 7 days. According to the amount of aerobic exercise I particpate in_ it last 3 to 5 days. Then_ it doesn't stick and/or it's no longer effective.I tried replacing Climara with Vivelle-Dot. My libido dropped_ my energy level dropped_ I became moody and anxious_ and I experienced hot flashes.For me_ the fact that Climara doesn't last 7 days is a very minor thing to have to deal with.

My main concern is that it does not stay on very well and if I don't put another one on right away I start a very heavy period (which I had not had a period in over 2 years before starting the Climara). Along with the periods I have worse cramps than I ever had before.  I have read other postings about putting tape and other patches over this one but I already feel self concsious running around with this on my butt and adding more layers just doesn't work for me.

Lint attaches to patch leaving a black ring around the patch.  Which defeats the purpose of the patch being clear.  The patch does not stick for a full 7 days.  I have to take special care when showering not to get it too wet.  Taking baths are a thing of the past.  It is much too expensive to replace the patch before 7 days. I would choose Clamara over Premerin any day.  I just wish I could take it in pill form.  Worried about swimming and sun bathing in summer.

155, 4, heartbeat irregularities_ hot flash,I have had a full hysterectomy. After taking it for 4 yrs_ I notice now I have burning mouth syndrome and dry mouth. On the 6th and 7th day sometimes the dosage start to wean and I feel my irregular heartbeat and have cold hands and feet. Hot flashes after a hot shower too. Sometimes mild ringing in the ears. Just wanted to input that I live in Las Vegas_ Nevada for 6 1/2 yrs and could location and climate play a part in the effects of this patch???? Please list location with your comments. Thank you.,Showering too long in hot water have an effect of the strength at the end of the week. Long showers weakens the strength.Placing the patch on my upper rear butt instead of my front abdomen works best for me. It's been very good to me for 4 years but now I am developing problems with this patch.Maybe my body is rejecting it after using it soooo long.I am considering on changing to a different brand just to see if my burning mouth/dry mouth disappears.It made my face smoother_very minimal hotflashes_ minimal heart irregularities_more energy.My mood swings are no longer. I feel very mellow. It has given me a life for the past 4 yrs. Now I am feeling very badly with stomach indigestion and dry mouth which makes it hard to eat. I am losing weight because of this.

159, 2, complete hysterectomy,It was a long couple weeks getting off oral medication and waiting for the patch to take effect. My skin is dry where the patch has been. When the patch stays on it seems effective.,Although taking a daily pill was quite inconvenient_ it was minor compared to the aggravation and frustration of the patch. I have followed the directions to the letter_ and it just won't stay put. At the end of the first day_ I have dark lint outlining the patch and adhesive residue on my panties. By the end of however long it decides to stick_ the outline of the patch is nearly disgusting. For me_ the Climara patch has been an intrusion. I cannot shower the way I used to_ as the patch ends up in the bottom of the tub. I cannot wear lotion like I used to_ for fear that the patch will not stick at all. I find myself constantly worried about where my patch may have migrated. Even intamacy effects the integrity of the patch. This is not something on which I wish to focus at such a time as this. Between the lint encrusted patch and the dryness of previous sites_ it is difficult for one to enjoy the attention of a new husband. At the end of this prescription_ I intend to talk to my doctor,F,39,2  months,10/1/2006Email,Climara

164, 5, Full Hysterctomoy,none-so far,I just had my uterus and ovaries removed 8/4/06. I was having monthly periods going into surgery. Never entered menoupsue. I was so worried about my hormones after surgery.  The Climara patch was put on me the day of surgery. I cannot believe how good I feel!!  I will see my doctor in a few weeks to discuss this patch.  I have no problems with  it sticking.  In fact I cannot get over how WELL it sticks.  I hope this is a safe way to go right now. I have history of panic and anxiety disorders and so far it's been OK.  I get super paranoid going on any kind of medication.  At the same time I have the most incredible female doctor who specializes in this area.,F,53,3  weeks,8/18/2006Email,Climara

I REALLY did not need the help in the upper portion and was already poofy in the lower from a ceaserean. However_ this does work for me as to relieving Hot Flashes_ night sweats_ and all of the other wonderful stuff that goes along with the menopause process. My only complaint is that the effects are lessened after about 5 days even if the patch is in place. If I could change it every fifth instead of seventh day all would be hunky dory!!,F,51,5  months,6/6/2006,Climara

Switched back to premarin on low dose of 0.45 because did not retain fluid on pills. Take pill every other day and so far so good. Hard to lose weight on climara because I tried but can on premarin.,Good for hot flashes_ night sweats but as far as losing weight seemed impossible on climara.

Wish they'd make one with a touch of testosterone!,I also wish they made Climara in form to be changed TWICE a week.I feel that it's effectivness starts to wear off around the middle of the week.

180, 3, Total Hysterectomy,I have been on 0.1 for over 5 years and it has been great until recently. For about the last 6-8 months the patches DO NOT STICK like they used to. It is not the same batch and I used to be able to keep them on for almost the full week. I have not changed toiletries or the way I bathe. Now it is like they shrivel up and get rigid. I can tell even without checking the condition of the patch as I get moody and short_ I get achy_ and I get the sweats.  I am a veteran at applying them and knowing when a new one is due.  I even called the company and complained about the change. They offered to give me a free patch and told me to put some tape over it to hold it on. I would like to see a 3-4 day version as that is the max they now adhere.,,F,43,5  years,10/4/2005Email,Climara

182, 5, hysterectomy,enlarged breasts_ weight gain I just cannot burn off,no problem with adhesive_ but I have to stay away from moisturizer soaps and lotions in area of patch or it falls off.

188, 4, Complete hysterectomy at age 48,skin irritation at site of patch,I swtched to Climera from Vivelle 6 months ago_ due to change in job and health insurance company.  Vivelle was x2 per week -- much better.  This patch does not stick as well_ and I experienced skin irritation after 4-5 days. Otherwise my health_ energy level_ mood_ and sex drive are terrific.  How can we get this company to consider making a x2 per week patch?,F,53,5  years,2/15/2005Email,Climara
189, 2, severe menopausal symptoms,Occasional_ mild low back ache and stomach cramping similar to with PMS_ and mild skin itchy irritation in the area of the patch.,Usually I can't tolerate normal doses of anything_ and have many side effects_ even rare ones_ to most meds. However_ with bioestrogens (estradiol) so far (in full meno most of 2004 now)_ it's like my body is a huge sponge dying for as much bio estradiol as it can get_ with no or very little side effects.  I had no side effects from bi-est_ it was just not strong enough and peaked and vallied too much.  That's why I got on the patch_ the only one I've done so far (for a couple of weeks now) is Climara_ and WHEN it is giving me THE FULL dose of estradiol and LASTING/STICKING...it works perfectly for me. The problem with Climara_ for me_ is it doesn't stick to my skin well or long at all (bubbles up and loosens on the first/second day)_ so it then doesn't deliver the full amount of estrogen_ and I suffer.  This stuff is good_ ONE DAY ONLY...If I could change it daily and not weekly_ it would be perfect! It also would NOT irritate skin if changed daily_ and would not have to worry about showering_ bathing_ exercising_ etc...if changed daily. I dont' think the technology for wearing these patches more than one day_ has really been perfected. And so_ it's a way to simply charge us more_ to get the full dosing. A scam. And we suffer even more.,F,45,2  weeks,1/20/2005,Climara
190, 5, Total hysterectomy,weight gain_ some migranes,Overall I like Climara.  It helps with the hot flashes.  I have been on all dose amounts.  My doctor is now having me go back to the .025mg. Got off of the .1mg for two months to see if I could do without. Nope I ended up feeling tired _ emotional and horrible night sweats. Now that I am back on it I feel good and like my old self. I hope to continue taking for a few more years.,F,38,8  years,1/14/2005Email,Climara
191, 5, total hysterectomy at age 32,NONE,I use the weekly patch and sometimes by the 7th day the patch isn't sticking so well anymore. Overall_ however_ this drug/patch is wonderful. I had a total hysterectomy due to endometriosis and the Climara patch - which I've been on for almost 4 years now - has for me prevented night sweats_ hot flashes_ dry skin_ mood swings_ etc...basically all the effects of hysterectomy & no estrogen. I would definitely recommend this drug to other women. I have no real gripes about it whatsoever and have experienced absolutely no side effects from it. I will probably be on this for the next 15-20 years and so I hope it continues to work as well for me as it does now.,F,36,4  years,12/30/2004,Climara
