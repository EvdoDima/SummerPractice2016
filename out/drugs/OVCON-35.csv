1, 2, Birth control,I am taking Zenchent. I have had many bad side effects and my ob is finally switching me to a different pill after this pack is completed. I have a brown spot on my forehead_ unwanted hair growth_ weight gain_ changes in the way my fingernails grow_ cysts on my ovaries_ and sometimes I start spotting a few days before my period actually starts. I cannot wait to get off this pill.,,F,30,10  months 1X D,5/16/2014,Ovcon-35
2, 4, birth control_ heavy period_ moodin,This is the only birth control that I've ever been able to take without becoming intolerably moody (about the tenth one I've tried). Increased libido. Fuller breasts. I do have some nausea_ and slight break outs which I've never had before_ but I also have extremely light periods that last four days instead of extremely heavy nine day periods. Very pleased.,,F,21,1  days35,2/2/2014,Ovcon-35

5, 5, regulate period and mood swings,None,I am extremely happy with this pill. I was having very bad mood swings_ breakthrough bleeding_ heavy periods_ bad PMS that lasted all month. With Ovcon_ I almost feel like my old self. Due to my age_ my gyno is trying to wean me to something lighter but I tried HRT and felt insane and went back on Ovcon for another year. Now I am trying something new but it has less progesterone and I am starting to feel hormonally crazy again. Ovcon has the right mix of hormones for me.,F,52,5  years 1X D,12/10/2012Email,Ovcon-35
6, 1, birth control & severe cramps,Severe depression and fatigue,When I first started taking Balziva (generic form)_ I didn't experience any side effects at all. My cramps were gone_ minimal flow_ it was great! But little did I know the drug was building up in my body and causing severe depression. After about 2 years_ I really started to notice the depression seeping in_ it was getting worse and worse by the week. I tried anti-depressants which didn't work with my body. I finally just stopped taking Balziva and within a week I felt like the dreadful cloud of depression was going away. It snuck up on me so quietly_ I almost didn't think about the possibility of it being because of the pill. I'm so glad I'm off the pill_ nobody's body should have to endure that kind of torture.,F,24,2  years 1X D,11/27/2012,Ovcon-35
7, 2, Endometriosis,I'm taking the generic (Zenchent). I'm bloated_ I have tender breasts_ and have gained weight and I'm still cramping pretty bad-I feel miserable.  I may have to try the brand name though. I feel like I have a tire around my belly and think I would rather deal with the pain then to feel this way and get fat.

However I have been on several types of birth control pills_ some of which caused extreme anxiety_ and this has been the only pill that has worked for me.

12, 5, birth control,GOOD SIDE EFFECTS: Extremely light period. Major improvement in menstrual cramps.,I have tried 3 different birth control pills before this one and had nothing but bad side effects from them all_ including extreme mood swings and depression. I am taking the generic version of this pill (Balziva) for about 2 years now and have NO bad side effects. Different bodies react differently to every type of pill so only way to find out if this pill is for you is to try it.,F,23,2  years 1X D,1/22/2012,Ovcon-35
13, 5, To stop my period,Non,I use the generic_ Balziva.  I have had no issue with this bc.  I take it non-stop for three months and then off for a week.

14, 1, hormone inbalance,I was on the brand name Ovcon for 3 mths ( pks from Dr) and when the pharmacy filled my rx_ they gave me Balziva..this is the worst pill ever. In the last 9 days_ yes_ just 9 days_  I've gone from perfectly fine to a wild raging hormonal freak! My breast are tender_ my uterus is killing me_ I 'feel' bloated_ and I feel like I'm in the middle of the worst PMS ever and I am a full 2 weeks away from a period. I called the pharmacy and they are sending out Ovcan asap_ they gave generic because it was free. My sanity is worth whatever they are charging and I can't wait to get my hands on that pack!!!!! Avoid using this pill if at all possible..my dr's office has said they've had many complaints about Balziva and can't figure out why it's still out there. It was on about day 5 I noticed some of these things but thought it was stress from work and the holidays......nope..it's the damn pill...today was the worst day I had in years,When I was on the actual brand name Ovcon 35 I never felt better!! I was back to the person I used to be..it was great. But_ on Balziva I am a raging bitch from hell with some of the worst PMS like symptoms ever. Thankfully I am getting the brand name in a couple of days..hopefully I make it till then.,F,43,9  days 1X D,12/22/2011Email,Ovcon-35

18, 3, regulation of an absent cycle,I was prescibed ovcon-35 to regulate my cycle and it did do that. However_in the 2yrs that i have been taking it i have began my cycle on or before day 14.I will continue to have my cycle until I start a new pack. I have lost 50lbs in the last 6 months but thats because I've choosen a healthier life style.I'm not sure if my cycle came early twice because of the weight loss and all the changes that goes along with that.I was just wondering if anyone else had this problem.,I did not have any noticable effects with this medication until now.,F,28,2  days35 mg 1X D,7/5/2010Email,Ovcon-35

I could not live like this for an extended period of time.  I am counting down the days until I finish this pack.  I know every woman is different and these pills may work wonderfully for many_ but for those experience the same symptoms as I this is confirmation that you are not imagining them.,F,36,15  days35 1X D,5/11/2010Email,Ovcon-35
20, 4, Birth Control & decrease period,I haven't noticed anything. I only take the active pill so I don't have periods (ob gyn approved this),I was taking Femcon Fe .35 but it was too expensive so my obgyn prescribed me Ovcon but my walgreens pharmacy gave me the generic Zenchent. Seems to be ok so far. I'm moody because of personal issues and have gained weight (totally my fault for not taking dieting and exercising like I should).

21, 1, very painful periods,15 pounds of weight gain after being the same weight for years (probably water weight as I am drinking a lot of water - 10glasses a day as well as stopping at water fountains constantly - and my pee remains bright yellow)_ really moody_ crying all the time_ fatigue_ headaches_ slight depression,I was on this BC for a few months before they switched me to the generic for it. The generic did nothing for my periods so they took me off of it and I've been on it now for about six months (started in September_ it's now beginning of March). The first time I was on it_ I loved it_ but now I've gained A LOT of weight and my moods are insane. I'm always tired even if I get 10+ hours of sleep. I've been on other birth controls_ but have had break through bleeding and such and never had this problem. I'm calling my OBGYN tomorrow to get taken off of it ASAP.,F,21,6  months35mg 1X D,3/3/2010Email,Ovcon-35
22, 3, Stop bleeding after UFE failed,I am on Zenchent_ still bleeding every day_ bigger swollen breasts_ sleepless and left knee keeps swelling.  Weight gain_ ever hungry for cabs and tired all day. occassional headache.  Still better than Loestrin 24_ which drove me to moodiness_ crazy dreams and cramping pain,I have been using the generic Zenchent and it has made me less moody and more myself than Loestrin 24_ which stopped bleeding for a week_ but I was dreaming scaring things and wake up sweating with palpitations.  With Zenchent_ I've never stopped bleeding_ its scaring as the bleeding is on_ each day (ligther than before)_ but I cannot have a physical relationship with a man_ quite annoying as my breasts are beautifully sexy and I still want loving!  My insurance will cover Ovcon 50 so I'll change tomorrow and see.  I usually need high doze_ so this might be right for me.  It was what the doctor wanted me to have_ but I was scared of the dosage and had no idea Ovcon 35 was not covered.  ALL wOMEN SHOULD FIGHT for INSUrance that wil cover the medicine that works for each individual NOT just the lowest cost generic.  IT causes women to suffer and to waste time_ money and their youth.  I waste so much time awake and then when I use a sleeping pill_ the mix with Zenchent makes me very dizzy and forgetful.  Also its another drug to confuse my body.,F,45,6  weeks35 1X D,2/26/2010,Ovcon-35

24, 5, Prevent pregnancy,Some break-through bleeding (off and on),This pill has been a great fit for me. I had been on Depo_ but it was too strong for me/my body type. I then switched to NuvaRing_ which made me depressed. After several months of just using barrier methods_ my doctor put me on Ovcon and it has been just right for me. I am now on the generic Zenchent_ and have been since my second pack of these pills.,F,26,1  years,12/2/2009,Ovcon-35
25, 1, regulate periods,weight gain_ insomnia_ moody_ nauseous,I was on Loestrin for two years and decided to get off birth control to get my body ready to start trying for a baby.  Well_ 5 months after getting off Loestrin I hadn't had a single period.  My Dr. tried putting me on 10 days of progesterone but that didn't do the trick.  So she started me on a month of Ovcon 35.  Only Walgreens gave me the generic Zenchent.  I have gained 4 pounds in a week and a half.  I can barely get my wedding ring off my hands are so swollen.  I'd lost about 6 pounds after getting of Loestrin and now it is all coming back on.  I eat healthy and workout at least 5 days a week. I hate this.,F,26,11  days,6/19/2009,Ovcon-35
26, 5, abnormal bleeding,No negative side effects.  The positive side effect is that it made me less moody.  I suffer from depression and have never felt better since being on this new birth control.,I was bleeding for 10 weeks straight.  After 3 birth control changes and an inconclusive Hysteroscopy_ I was put on this birth control.  The bleeding stopped within a week_ and hasn't returned!,F,30,3  weeks,6/8/2009,Ovcon-35
27, 1, ovarian cysts,Severe mood swings_ headaches frequently_ breakthrough bleeding now for 4 days(taking to avoid period altogether) and major cramping,This is the second birth control that I have been put on for ovarian cysts.  After I took the second pill_ I IMMEDIATELY started feeling depressed and severe moodiness.  I called my Dr and spoke with the nurse_ whom asked if I was sure it was the pill and not anything else making me feel this way!!!  Well_ sorry but this actually almost made me feel like I was just crazy!!!!  Reading all the comments here sure make me feel better.  Got an appointment with dr. in two days.  Can't wait to get off this pill!!!!,F,30,1  months,5/17/2009Email,Ovcon-35
28, 5, Very Bad Menstral pain,NONE,I love this stuff....I've tried four others before my doctor put me on this. I'm glad that I found one that doesn't make me crazy or have bleeding every day. I am on an extended dose where I take three months of the active pill and then take the white. I have minimal to NO pain with my pill periods and I can function like a normal human being. Even the flow is light_ and it is wonderful compared to heavy and painful. I love it and recommend it to anyone that has heavy_ painful periods.,F,31,2  years,4/18/2009,Ovcon-35
29, 2, Heavy and Painful Periods,Moodiness all the time. Depression_ Anxiety_ Tiredness. Weight gain of 10 pounds. Weird food cravings during period.,I would not recommend this pill to anyone. Extreme clotting and periods that last for seven days. Very painful cramps. This was supposed to lessen my period_ but did not do it. I am always moody and always depressed for some reason.,F,21,1  years,4/15/2009,Ovcon-35
30, 5, BIRTH CONTROL,none really- was switched to it from another kind that was making me cry all the time- no probs w/this one but I take the name brand one- I am going to stick to it bc I have had probs w/other generics in the past and come to the conclusion they produce worse/more side effects- so I'm too worried about trying the generic version of this- (esp reading other reviews on Balziva),unfortunately it is very expensive & the price keeps going up- my insurance will only pay for the generic which I'm afraid to try d/t side effects- it's costly but I guess worth it to avoid any terrible side effects,F,37,1  years,3/27/2009,Ovcon-35
31, 5, birth control,For first three months experienced about 5 to 10 pound weight gain_ breast tenderness_ bloating.  After that the weight came off and any other weight gain was my own fault (meaning I could exercise it off).  After almost 9 years I barely have a period at all and often completely skip it altogether.  This does make me buy more pregnancy tests which are always negative but rather pricey.,Very satisfied for the last nine years_ even after switching to Balziva_ which I was very nervous about since Ovcon had always been perfect.  I will be stopping it soon and am nervous about all the withdrawal effects I have been reading about on the internet.  I seems like people only report the negative.  So I will then be able to determine if how I feel on the pill is different then off the pill.,F,28,9  years,2/28/2009,Ovcon-35
32, 2, prevent pregnancy,breakthru bleeding_ tender/sore breasts_ mood swings_ very emotional,Have had breakthrough bleeding before my period.  My actual period lasts about 2 days then stops then goes for another day.  My breasts are very sore/tender.  I'm much more moody and emotional.,F,26,2  months,2/4/2009,Ovcon-35
33, 5, birth control,none,I started taking Ovcon about 5 years ago_ and I switched to the generic Balziva.  I love this pill! I only have a period once every 3 months_ and when I do have a period it is so light_ and lasts only 1-2 days.,F,36, ,1/20/2009,Ovcon-35
34, 4, endomitriosis,no crazy side effects. i wasnt anymore moody than i normally am_ i think i have an increase in my sex drive but mostly because i think my old BC decreased it down to nothing. sadly my breast size has remained unchanged. and i did not gain any weight. the only thing i can think of that may have been related to this pill was that i was having a bit of joint stiffness the first week or two of taking it. it was more annoying than anything.,i was put on ovcon to stop my periods after my surgery for endo. the last pill i was on was unable to do this and i was on my period for a good 3 months straight. finaly after maybe a month and a half of taking ovcon it has stopped. as with all medication_ every persons body reacts differently_ and it may take a while for your body to fully adjust for it to start working properly. do not take this pill for one week and then give up on it. it may work for some and not work for others but you have to take it for a few months to let your body adjust. so far this one has worked great for me :) you just have to find the right mixture of hormones for your body. not everyone is the same,F,21,3  months,12/31/2008,Ovcon-35
35, 3, to help control my period,I was very emotional_ cried a lot_ very depressed_ gained weight_ had loose bowl movements_ and nausea_,I am 38 and my period went crazy_ had it for 6 weeks with heavy bleeding and clotting.  My obgyn put me on this 5 weeks ago_ and over the last couple of weeks I've noticed the weight gain and my mood swings_ crying all the time_ and don't want to be bothered by anyone or do anything.  I stopped taking it today after looking at this website_ will call the Dr. on Monday to prescribe something different,F,38,5  weeks,12/27/2008,Ovcon-35
36, 1, To stop breakthrough bleeding,I took two months of Femcon Fe and had my period the entire two months_ I never stopped bleeding once. I had cramping_ bloating_ back aches_ head aches and fatigue for two months straight and my period was the heaviest it had EVER been. I had never had problems sleeping before and suddenly found myself restless every night. I stopped after the two months and decided to let my own body take over.,May try another pill later in life if needed but don't plan to use Femcon Fe again.,F,34,2  months,11/25/2008,Ovcon-35
37, 5, birth control,none,I was on Ovcon and switched to Balziva. After experiencing severe depression and anxiety for the first time in my life_ my doctor switched me to Yaz. I got melasma and then she switched me to ortho tri cyclen lo... and I got more melasma. I want to switch back to ovcon 35_ but am now wondering if it is no longer available? I was also wondering if anyone has switched to ovcon from a lower dose pill and had melasma not worsen? any info would be appreciated!,F,26,2  years,11/10/2008,Ovcon-35
38, 2, Yes aka Balziva,Bleeding did not stop_ just got a little bit lighter. Weight gain is very noticeable. Tenderness in nipples. Sexual drive is a zero. Swelling in hands and feet also very noticeable. Have at least 1-2 major headaches (or tightness around the back of neck area) a day.  Fatigue (tired during the day_ but restless at night). Daily body rashes appear and disappear. Depressed.,I've been on this medicine now for a little over 1 week and I can see all of the above side effects taking a toll on myself physically and emotionally. I did not get on this medication by choice nor am I taking the medicine to avoid pregnancy. I recently turned 28 and for the first time in 16 years_ my period decided to go berserk on me. I had an abnormal heavy clotty period that lasted for a month and my doctor (not OBGYN) prescribed this med for me. At first she stated it would stop after 1-2 days of taking the med...this did happen_ but then on the 4th day...my period came right back. Called doc back who advised it can take up to 1-2 WEEKS to stop or regulate my cycle. After reading some of the comments about this med_ I am seriously having 2nd thoughts about continuing this med...I am not sure what is worse...having a heavy/clotty period or all of the side effects I've listed.,F,28,7  days,11/8/2008,Ovcon-35
39, 5, Birth control,Dampening of sex drive_ otherwise very little or no periods.,I took Ovcon-35 for about ten years before being forced to a generic due to insurance limitations.  It was very effective.  I maintained a healthy weight the entire time_ I did not feel sick like I did with higher hormone pills_ it kept my moods level_ and my periods almost entirely disappeared.  I only lament that it pretty much destroyed my sex drive (so_ why take birth control if you don't want to have sex?!).,F,35,10  years,9/6/2008,Ovcon-35
40, 1, avoid pregnancy,feel so disconnected. extreme depression and so moody. I have felt as though i have the flu. breast enlargement and missed periods.

41, 1, ,Weight gain up to about 15 pounds after years of always being the exact same weight. Awful mood swings that made me irrationally angry_ depressed and often really paranoid. All of this went away almost immediately after I discontinued use.,I strongly urge women against taking this method of birth control.,F,25,10  months,7/16/2008,Ovcon-35
42, 2, birth control,weight gain_ EXTREMELY tender breasts_ spotting (which I've NEVER had before)_ incredible cramps (also which I've never had before)_ amplified back ache,I'm on the quest for a new pill and this is the third I've tried.  At first_ I thought I had found the one_ now three months later the truth is revealed.  I will be switching ASAP.,F,31,3  months,7/14/2008,Ovcon-35
43, 2, birth control,Breakthrough bleeding the entire 1rst month and off/on for 2nd month_ weight gain_ breast tenderness_ headache and fatigue,Switched from Yasmin to Femcon Fe(same as Ovcon-35)to help w/ breakthrough bleeding.  It got worse. Plan on switching back.,F,38,2  months,4/29/2008,Ovcon-35
44, 2, Period Regulation,I started off by taking Yaz_ which just didn't cut it to regulate my period.  So my ob/gyn switched me to Ovcon_ for about a month it helped me by regulating my period then the other side effects started.  I couldn't sleep during the night_ then I was tired all day.  I had horrible cramps during my period and major mood swings.  Also_ I had a strong feeling of nausea before my period started.  It really helped me by reading other women's comments about the effect of this pill because at first I thought it was just me.  So now I'm calling my ob/gyn to find out what would be better for me to take.,,F,,4  months,4/25/2008,Ovcon-35
45, 2, birth control,It was great at first. I had been on the patch but had gained sooo much weight that I had to switch. Ovcon was great_ and switching to Balziva I thought was great too. The side effects rear their ugly head after about a year. NO sex drive_ and terrible mood swings. I have an appt to try something else tomorrow.,,F,23,1.5  years,4/14/2008,Ovcon-35
46, 5, birth control and period regulation,migraines,I've taken alot of different birth controls and had many different experiences_ this being the best. I mostly wanted to say in response to alot of comments that one birth control may not work for you but may be a godsend for another.  We all have very very different bodies.  I'm sure glad they didn't take this one off the market because it is the only one that has been able to regulate my bleeding and keep me from being depressed thus far. It's your ob-gyn who will ensure you get the proper bc. My first ob-gyn basically told me to suck it up.  I saw this dr and she was wonderful and helped me with my bc and constant bleeding issues. I have to be on a bc or I will constantly bleed.,F,25,1  years,4/13/2008,Ovcon-35
47, 1, Birth control,I took Ovcon-35 for about 5 years and then went off for 2 years because I wanted to give my body a break.  I went back on 3 months ago and have experienced much of what has been described here: anxiety_ fatigue and moodiness.  I am easily frustrated and angry.  I have also experienced a full on period after taking a pill 12 hours late once.  Problems sleeping and heaviness in my chest have also been prevalent in the past 2 weeks.  I am going off- better just to use condoms.,,F,36,3  months,4/7/2008,Ovcon-35
48, 4, preparing for Invitro fertilization,nausea at beginning_ spotting 1ce_ on 20th day and experiencing cramping and feel like going to start period early. I have always been regular and seems to really be screwing up my normal cycle.  Seems odd to be on birth control to try to get pregnant but this is how the drs keep you on their schedule to start fertility drugs.  I feel I would have been better off keeping on my natural schedule since I will have to put off another month starting my treatment because of starting period early.  I feel calmer than normal and less anxiety which is great; however_ after reading all the comments about hair loss I definately wouldnt stay on this if I had to take birth control on a normal basis. Maybe cramps by this times normal however I havent experienced it at this time in the month off bc. Seems like by reading all comments there are too many side effects_ but_ like many others I am on the generic too.,,F,31,20  days,3/26/2008,Ovcon-35

53, 3, Birth Control/PCOD,"I had been on Ovcon 35 for a few years with no problems.  I lost weight_ had barely noticeable periods_ and never eperienced any side effects.  However_ my insurance ""made"" me switch to the generic BALZIVA.  I now have horrible PMS: mood swings_ minor depression_ sore breasts_ and periods about 3 times heavier than with the name brand.  I didn't make the connection before_ but I have had some horrible heart burn since taking Balziva.  I will definitely switch back to Ovcon once I change insurance companies.",I spoke to my gyno about the mood swings _ heavier periods_ etc. that I was experiencing with BALZIVA.  She explained that generic birth control pills can have up to a 40% difference in absorbtion rate as compared to the name brand.  It was her opinion that the side effects of Balziva are due to inconsistent levels of absorbtion from month to month,F,26,1.5  years,2/21/2008Email,Ovcon-35
54, 4, birth control,i have been on ovcon for seven years_ and in the beginning i thought it was a GOD SEND. it leveled out my mood_ i lost about seven lbs_ my skin was clear...i had tried a lot of pills and this was the one for me! however_ sadly_ it seems that the bad side effects start to increase the longer you are taking it. for me my main side effect is hair loss. now_ i never had jessica simpson hair to begin with but i have a sneaking suspicion that over the years this has thinned my hair dramatically. i went off it briefly last year and noticed that my hair was growing back_ but ultimately after six months went back on it for birth control. i have definitely become more moody too_ over the years_ and noticed a lot more bloating and easier weight gain. oh_ and lack of sex drive. if anyone who reads this is experiencing hair loss/hair thinning please contact me at saavy77@aol.com  i am curious if it is just me!!!!,never had any issues with spotting/nausea. always got my period on time. for all the girls on here_ reading this_ IF YOU ARE SPOTTING or HAVING YOUR PERIOD MORE THAN ONCE A MONTH while on OVCON_ then it is not strong enough for you and you CAN get pregnant.  if you notice on this board_ the girls who report the side effect of bleeding during their cycle_ heavy spotting_ etc. those were the ones who got pregnant. be careful...the doctors don't warn you about this for some reason...,F,30,7  years,2/3/2008Email,Ovcon-35
55, 3, Control menstrual cycles and cramps,Nausea_ diarrhea_ insomnia.,I have been on birth control for roughly 7 years_ and on Ovcon 35 for at least 3 years. If I miss a single pill or take it more than 12 hours later_ I most likely get a period with full flow and cramps. If I try to make up for a missed/late pill and take two within 24 hours_ I am awaken at night with nausea_ diarrhea_ and anxiety. I have found that when I start a new pack/month_ my digestive schedule is thrown off track. I will wake up at night to defecate_ and may be constipated in the following days. Ovcon has been the most effective birth control I have taken_ making my periods lighter with generally less cramping. However_ I took two pills 12 hours apart yesterday (to make up for a missed pill) and I have been up since 5am on a sunday_ been to the restroom 4 times in 3 hours. Not fun!,F,22,3  years,1/27/2008,Ovcon-35

57, 1, Birth Control,My pharmacist gave me the generic brand of Ovcon-35 which was Balziva because it was covered under my insurance for alot less.  I would say that I've been taking it for abount 8 months but I finally stopped because I believe it has made my hair brittle and has made me loose alot of my hair.  I'm not taking any chances and I will never take Balizia again because I would rather have my hair.,If I do start to take birth control again I probably would take ovcon-35 and not it's generic brand.

59, 4, birth control and lighter cycles,I didn't have any noticeable side effects from Ovcon-35,I was taking Ovcon-35 until my insurance company stopped paying for it. I was given the generic_ Balziva_ and it SUCKED!!! I started taking the Balziva about 2 months ago and I started experiencing all types of side effects. Nausea_ altered sex drive_ hair loss and frequent headaches are just a few of the side effects I experienced. When I say I loss my hair_ I am not exaggerating! I had healthy_ long_ full hair and now I may have to cut it and start fresh due to this drug! I didn't have any problems like this with Ovcon. You don't have to worry about me taking Balziva ANYMORE!! I took that mess back to the pharmacy and told them that I wasn't going to take it anymore!,F,30,2  months,11/25/2007,Ovcon-35

I almost thought I was better because of the hormones.  Its been 5 weeks since I've been off ovcon and my mood is much steadier. I guess your body readjusts.  I just never relized how ot was controlling my mood and my life. I was so young when I started taking it.,F,28,8  years,11/24/2007,Ovcon-35

I didn't have a problem with the periods_ but lots of headaches_ serious allergy problems.,I was on Ortho Evra for almost four years.  Never had a problem with it_ just got tired of worrying about whether it would fall off one day.  I got on LoEstrin for a few months_ but found i couldn't afford it.  So_ my doctor put me on Balziva.  I've been on it for a little over two months_ and I'm not taking it anymore.  DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL!  The depression is HORRIBLE_ and_ while I'm hoping that the depression will stop now that I'm off of it_ I worry that it won't.

63, 5, Regulate periods,First month was not fun_ long period. Second month was fantastic_ very short period. I have not gained weight; I am losing weight_ but not just due to starting this drug. I believe I was a little over-emotional the first month as my body was adjusting_ but now I feel great. I have very long cycles when not on birth control_ and this is doing a great job of regulating and causing me to have lighter and shorter periods.,I am on a generic of this drug.,F,34,72  days,11/8/2007,Ovcon-35

Every month_ a day before my period_ and sometimes more often_ I would start crying_ cause trouble on purpose_ start fights_ talk back to people_ be rude_ couldn't control my anger. My friend is the one who thought it might be the hormones in it. I stopped taking it for a month before I got a new birth control. During that month and waiting for my next period_ everything was fine_ no more anger_ no more being bad_ getting in trouble.",Ovcon was nice in the whole lighter_ shorter periods. Very nice.

My periods were very irregular before and now they are regular_ my cramps are less and I never hardly get blemishes on my face. The only down-side is that I gained 20 pounds. I was one of those skinny people who could never gain weight before and I gained 15 pounds within the first year of taking it. I know this side effect only happens for some_ so if you are thinking of trying it_ don't let this discourage you. As for myself_ I am thinking of switching to a lower estrogen dose pill to see if that will help with my weight.,F,21,4  years,3/5/2007,Ovcon-35

I would still experience a lot of vomiting and breast tenderness but didn't switch b/c at least I knew what to expect with Ovcon (even though they were almost as bad as Ortho).  I switched to Junel Fe finally b/c my side effects just got really bad.  I would have really bad naussea and throw up almost 3-4 times a night during the first 3 pills of the new pack (even though I would take my pill with a meal).  I would get really bad headaches_ breast tenderness_ loss of sex drive and non-stop yeast infections.  I even had a bald spot the size of a $1 coin_ which I now think is a result of these damn pills!  Any slight change in my stress level would make me not get my period_ or get it twice a month.

Still have some pelvic pain during weeks 2_3_4_ but much better than before.,I am satisfied b/c it has helped me with my issues_ but I'm not sure if I'd recommend this pill to someone who is looking for birth control.

112, 4, Ovarian Cysts,The first month that I was on Ovcon 35_ I experienced back pain_ nausea_ and extreme moodiness. I also had a very light cycle so I was afraid that I was pregnant. I ended up taking 4 pregnancy tests and all were negative. However_ I didn't have any problems the second month. I was given Balziva by the pharmacists for the 3rd month. I am in the third week of the packet and I have started experiencing really bad cramps and nausea. Has anyone else had problems with Balziva?,,F,34,3  months,12/22/2006Email,Ovcon-35

I take it continually (no periods!!!!) to control my endometriosis pain.  I had gained about 5 lbs_ but I am relatively sure that is due to my love of pie.  This pill is amazing_ I would recommend it to anyone looking for continual birth control due to ovarian cysts and endo.,F,20,1  years,12/17/2006,Ovcon-35

Terrible cramping_ very heavy bleeding_ then no bleeding for one day_ then back to extreme bleeding(thru a super tampax and a mini pad in about two hours).

But_ than about 2 months ago i had to start taking the generic kind Balziva and since i've been on that i have experienced break thorugh bleeding ( alot_ not just spotting) and am feeling bloated alot. When it is time for my real period_ my cramps have gottong worse and i am extra bloated and it is alot heavier. When i was on ovcon35 my period only last for 2 days and i had no bloating or breakthorugh bleeding. Could the generic version be giving me these side effects? If anyone could help it would be great!

116, 4, DUE TO CRAMPS,Moody and emotional,I loved this pill!! I was so upset that they discontinued it just ALL of a sudden. I presently ended up taking the Balziva birth control pill and my sex drive is gone. I did not have this problem with Ovcon-35 AT ALL. Therefore_ I am getting ready to try a chewable birth control pill that my gyn recommended that is in place of Ovcon-35. Can't wait to see what happens.,F,33,28  days,12/15/2006,Ovcon-35
117, 2, regulation,chewable caused me to feel anxious and heart burn...,I was on ovcon 35 for over 15 years and LOVED it. They recently switched to a chewable tablet(that you can also swallow) This pill contains sucralose(like splenda) and caused me to have increase feelings of nervousness_ etc.  I just asked my Dr to write me a perscription for Balziva which is the generic for the original ovcon 35. I am very dissapointed that the original was changed.,F,36,15  years,12/9/2006,Ovcon-35
118, 4, period regulation_ birth control,breast tenderness_ bloating_ irritability,I have been on Ovcon for over 3 years now...looking at some of the other long-termers_ yes_ it has produced the least side effects...however the belly weight gain and breast tenderness is more noticable now.  I have even recently increased the amount I exercise_ and still no difference.,F,30,3  years,12/6/2006,Ovcon-35
119, 5, Regulation_ severe cramps,For the first 2 months I was bloated_ had headaches and stomachaches.  After that_ no side effects.,I have been on at least 5 different birth control pills.  Most of them I get extremely moody_ lose my sex drive_ still have horrible cramps_ and remain completely unregulated.  My Dr has me on the new GENERIC form of this drug (which most insurance covers) taking placebos every 3 months and I love it.  My periods are actually regulated and light_ my cramps are almost gone_ I have a sex drive_ and no mood swings.  I love it!,F,24,3  months,12/5/2006Email,Ovcon-35
120, 2, Birth control,Irregular period and water retention,I had to get off Ovcon-35 after 4 months because I would have my period even when I was on the active pills.  I would also gain a lot of water weight during my period.  My weight would go from 108 lb to 113 lb.,F,35,4  months,12/4/2006,Ovcon-35

122, 3, birth control,I've gained almost 15 pounds_ which is more that I'd gained in the past 10 years before being on Ovcon35.  I've also experienced mood swings and I am much more emotional than before.  I have also been getting nauseous when I'm hungry which I had never experienced before.  I was fine for about the first year of being on this pill.  There was some increase in emotional issues and I gained a few pounds_ but both have increased more the second year.,I have had shorter periods on this pill which has been nice.  It has been an effetive birth control.,F,29,2  years,11/27/2006,Ovcon-35
123, 5, Birth control,,They have discontinued regular Ovcon 35 but now there is Ovcon Chewable which I believe has the same effect.  You can actually swallow or chew this pill and it is supposed to be a spearmint flavor.  I have been taking the chewable for a month now and haven't noticed any difference from before.  I have been on the shot and the patch and hated both.  LOVE Ovcon.,F,27,2  years,11/26/2006,Ovcon-35

126, 2, Irregular periods_ mood swings,THe first month I felt great!  But going into the second I have experienced almost constant diahrea_ loss in sex drive (dramatically) and slight depression.  I'm crying all the time_ my face broke out really bad and I gained 5 lbs.  Not a happy camper!,I would never recommend this for any of my friends.  Its too expensive and too much trouble.  I have been taking birth control for 5 years and this was the worst experience I have had.,F,24,2  months,11/21/2006,Ovcon-35

128, 5, Severe ovary pain_irregular period,I have been on Ovcon for about 6 months now. The first two months_ I had constant breakthrough bleeding_ severe nausea_ headaches_ and tender breast but since my body has gotten used to it I haven't had any pains in my ovaries and my periods are on time every month.  I also did not gain any weight but my breast have gotten a little heavier.,Although I don't know if I am going to have a heavy or light period from month to month_ I do know that I am going to get a period the same time every month.  I was a little hesitant_ but without it I would be in worse pain.,F,21,6  months,11/16/2006Email,Ovcon-35
129, 4, Birth Control,I've been on this pill for about four months now and so far the only complaint I really have is weight gain.  I haven't gained a lot of weight but it's enough that I notice it_ even though nobody else really does.  One definite plus of this pill is the EXTREMELEY light flows.  My last period only lasted about 3 days and I barely bled at all.  It actually worried me a bit and I thought I might be pregnant so I went out and got a test but it was negative.  I have also experianced excessive vaginal lubrication before sex so if you have a problem with dryness down there this pill will defintely help you out!,,F,20,4  months,11/16/2006,Ovcon-35
130, 2, Birth Control,Breakthrough Bleeding_ Mood Swings_ Weight gain,I have been on this pill for 8months now and the first few months my period was a little out of wack but then it was fine. Now I just started to breakthrough bleed and I have experianced frequent mood swings.

131, 4, Birth Control/ Irregularity,I tend to have really bad nausea or even vomiting_ but only if I miss a pill and then take 2 the next night. The morning after that is awful_ but that's a matter of being responsible I guess. My breasts got bigger too_ and I did gain a little weight_ but I also gained weight with the first pill I took as well.,I switched to this pill because the first one I started on didn't get me regular_ this one really did- but the first month was awful_ constant heavy bleeding and cramps. I am generally happy- but the vomiting is insane.,F,18,8  months,11/12/2006,Ovcon-35
132, 1, to regulate cycle_ bc,gained a million lbs_ DID NOT regulate ANYTHING_ total loss of sex drive,i was on ortho evra which did not work for me so my doctor switched me to ovcon 35 and told me it could take up to 6 mos to be effective. i gave it nearly a year and it was an awful year: i had my period 2x a month_ gained weight continuously regardless of how much i exercised_ decreased my sex drive so bad_ which was terrible since i was getting my period 2x a month_ the availability of days to have sex was already limited. i finally stopped after 10 months on Ovcon and wouldn't you know? the next month_ while not on ANY bcp_ i got my period on time and only once! since then_ i've switched to another bcp and it has been wonderful.,F,26,10  months,11/10/2006,Ovcon-35

135, 1, Birth Control,Nausea_ dizziness_ cramps_ lower back pain_ bloating_ increased appetite_ spotting and breakthrough bleeding_ sinus drainage_  swollen glands_ migraines_ lack of concentration_ and absolutely NO ENERGY!,My doc switched me to Ovcon 35 because I was having occasional bleeding after intercourse (after being tested for any STD's). She suggested I try something a little stronger. I have taken 3 different birth control pills in the last 9 years and have never experienced any side effects until I tried Ovcon 35.  I have had flu like symptoms and nausea since the day I started this pill. I have had spotting for 4 days now_ which has only become worse each day_ and I am still taking the active pills! I am so bloated_ I look like I'm pregnant. My entire body has hurt since I started taking this and I have no energy at all. I am a Kickbox instructor_ which makes matters 100x's worse_ especially when I have to teach a kickbox class 3 days a week!  I'm switching back to my old brand_ Triphasil 28 when I finish this pack. Although my doc says it will take a few months for my body to adjust_ I highly doubt it's worth all this pain and frustration.,F,28,16  days,10/31/2006,Ovcon-35

137, 1, very painful periods.,I have been on ovcon for only 3 cycles. It made me feel like I constantly had the flu. I felt like utter crap. I have been to my doctor 3 times for swollen glands. My husband finally threw pills away mid cycle.  Guess what? I feel great.,I would not reccomend this pill to anyone.  After reading comments I realized I too had headaches every morning. On top of all that my period was worse than ever.  Will not take pill ever again.  Back to the drawing board....,F,34,62  days,10/29/2006,Ovcon-35

139, 3, painful periods,passed out 1 week after being on it_ slight cramping throughout the month. Abdominal problems after starting the nonactive pills and major headaches on nonactive pills. Nipple tenderness within the first month.,Barely got a period the first month (last month) scared I was pregnant so I called my doctor and she said a very very light period is normal for up to three months. Even with this information I still took a test and it was negative but...(Still hoping I'm going to get mine this month though!!!) I'd rather get one than be afraid of being pregnant!! I just don't feel like myself on this pill. I was on ortho-low for about 6 months and it did nothing for my cramps and gave me headaches. I'm definitely rethinking whether or not bc is for me or if I should just stick out the unbelievable pain of cramps once a month.,F,19,2  months,10/23/2006,Ovcon-35

141, 3, Birth Control,Extreme nausea_ depression_ vaginal dryness_ intense pain with intercourse,I started with a new gynecologist and she wanted to change me from OrthoCyclen (which I loved) to OvCon-35_ so I agreed to try what she suggested. The first month I had a big increase in my sex drive. Halfway through the second month I started my period_ which continued about 12 days. Around that same time_ I began to notice such severe vaginal dryness that even just walking (and especially urinating) was painful. I called the doctor and they determined over the phone that I had a yeast infection (I had no discharge or odor). The problem didn't go away with medication and the pain during sex worsened so I went in for an exam. After spending an hour and a half at the doctor's office and incurring over $100 in outside lab fees (in addition to doctor's fee) they founs that nothing was wrong with me (not even bladder related). I think this is attributable to OvCon.

The headaches and vomitting never occur now.,I was on the shot when i first started birth control and i had terrible spotting problems and i would i have my period for a week or 2 when i wasnt suppose to. I also noticed i had major mood swings and would cry on the flip of a dime. Then i tried the pill and couldn't ever remember it. Then i switched the patch and i would have terrilbe cramps and vomitting problems every time i changed the patch and it was very uncomfortable no matter where it was. Then i switched to Ovcon 35 and i'm very happy with it. I  never had mood swings and my cramps are not even noticable. My periods are much lighter now too. I would never go back to anything else.,F,20,1  years,10/4/2006,Ovcon-35

Fairly sure the bloating is due to bc. Would like for husband to bet a vasectomy_ so I can get off the pill for good. I also have hypothyroidism and I am thinking Ovcon may be interferring with my Synthroid to control hypothroidism.

I was having a STROKE!!!!  At first we thought it was a TIA_ but it was a FULL BLOWN STROKE.  I was admitted to the hospital and now I have neurologist_ opthomologists_ hematologist_ etc. on the payroll.  I have a $34_000.00 bill because of Ovcon-35.

It regulated my periods and I felt fine with no break-thru bleeding. Then I got horrible mood swings so I switched to Ovcon 35.  The first month I felt great. It helped with my mood swings and just made me feel good. Then the second month into it I began to bleed (I thought nothing of it). Then the bleeding lasted for 12 days. I was so misreable. It was terrible. I don't know if I should continue my quest for the right birth control for me or give up.,F,18,2  months,8/12/2006,Ovcon-35

I was surprised on how this pill made me feel like I was pregnant.  I have been through two_ and if I did not already have an hysterectomy I would have been going to CVS for some pregnancy tests.  I have been craving salty foods all day long and my hunger has increased to wanting food all day long.  What surprised me the most is how much weight I gained in such a short period of time on this pill.  I have not eaten more - actually I have been eating less_ exercising more but I still gained 8 pounds.  Get this_ I only eat salad for lunch and dinner with vinegar_ for breakfast only egg whites.  I know it is the pill putting on the weight because no one can gain weight with a diet such as this.  The three positive side effects are my breast getting bigger and firmer plus it has helped my ovary pain and my hair loss. I have only been on this pill for 12 days and I am  stopping it though due to the weight gain.  I will write ba,F,36,12  days,8/2/2006Email,Ovcon-35

I feel a lot better and I have a lot less extream emotional outbursts like I did before.  It had made my life so much better.  My boobs did get bigger (yay)_  but so did my stomach (boo).  I have been on it for 6 weeks_ and I started to have some breakthough bleeding today.  I would say its worth the $48 dollars I'm paying for it_ because there is no generic version of this drug avaliable.,F,23,6  weeks,8/1/2006,Ovcon-35

I started taking it on the first day of my period and it shortened my period. The second week I started having breast tenderness and even had cramps and bleeding as if I got my period again. I had a very good sex drive before and now I have nothing_ which my boyfriend isn't happy about. The breast tenderness seems to get worse everday.Maybe this is just for the first month or two but I'm not sure. So far I don't like it.

Every woman has a different system and all meds effect people different_ I don't think reading other people's comments can help you decide if this is the pill for you.  For me though I love this pill_ I have not had any problems with it and the 12 pounds I lost are an added bonus is how I am looking at it.  For all the people that stated they were on it for a day or two and hated it_ as is any medication_ give it time -come on!!!,F,32,5  months,7/26/2006Email,Ovcon-35
173, 3, birth control,Switched to Ovcon-35 due to lack of sex drive on previous pill.  This pill fixed that_ much to my delight_ but my breasts are now huge and are often tender.  I can't even wear some of my bras anymore.  I have also developed pretty bad acne problems_ and always feel bloated and large.  I've looked at myself in the mirror some days and my stomach just looked like a swollen balloon.  I seem to have gained 5-10 lbs while on this pill_ although I guess I can't be sure the pill actually caused the weight gain.  But definitely there has to be some weight gain from all the water retention.  I am switching to a different one.,Give it at least 3-5 months to see how you do.

Signs of depression.,This is my worst nightmare packed into a tiny peach pill. If I'm not walking around with a green color on my face from the nausea I'm starving. I cant even look at my boyfriend without panicking that he might actually want to sleep with me since my lack of sex drive is so bad that just the thought of sex makes me want to vomit. I never knew the pill could cause psychological effects like these. My boyfriend is so wonderful_ I know this must be difficult for him to bare. Anyone else would have bolted. Only time my mood perks up is when I hear the mention of greasy salty food. I'd managed to keep my weight at an even amount for the last few years and it seems that now its next to impossible to do and part of me doesnt even care...I'm taking this to try to shrink the lemon sized cyst comfortably seated on my ovary right now.

Antibiotic and two treatments with viginal cream helped just a little bit. Unbearable burning. One week even the face was burning and eyelids were red and impossible to touch. Area between breasts became supersensative to touch - after showering it was red for 2 hours! Slight rubbing of the skin somewhere else also left redness for several minutes. Never had anything like this in my life! Stopped taking the pill after 3 weeks - all simptoms are gone except the vaginal infection.,It was the worst experience of my life.

I had no bloating_ headaches_ or constant light depression_ which I've had with many other pills over the years.  I was very happy with it from month 2 until last month.  I liked that my breasts were larger and skin was very clear_ but_ during the last month_ all of a sudden my face is breaking out_ my breasts are smaller_ and I feel a little depressed again.  I'm not sure why this sudden change.,F,31,6  months,4/22/2006,Ovcon-35

Symptoms are getting worse.

231, 1, birth control,I am terribly annoyed with the break-through bleeding.I feel as though i'm in bad nightmare where I bleed 3 out of 4 weeks of the month.THIS IS HORRENDOUS. I have cramps throughout the entire month. Additionally_ I was a total basketcase the first two months on the pill. I was so depressed at the beginning of my period last month that I could hardly motivate myself to get out of bed. I didn't leave my house for an entire week. Untypical behaviour because I eat well (mostly raw_ organic foods) and excercise almost everyday_ and am very social by nature. I want the bleeding and cramping to stop. My sympoms are getting progressively worse. I'm ready to quit this pill at the end of this cycle. NO THANK YOU_ OVCON-35.,I did gain 5 pounds_ became overly emotional during pms time. No bloating and little breast tenderness.,F,25,3  months,4/17/2006,Ovcon-35

It's totally traumatized me from other pills too.,F,19,3  months,4/12/2006,Ovcon-35

234, 3, endometriosis,Have been on Ovcon for almost a month.  I have never had cramps until now.  Three pound weight gain and brest tenderness beyond belief.  Was bleeding most of the month on other pills though and have not on this one.  No headaches_ no real fatigue.  Had some slight stomach irritation but it has passed.  Most concerned about the weight gain.  I work out one to two hours a day and had been losing weight.  I have found the weight gain to be very discouraging.,,F,37,15  days,4/6/2006,Ovcon-35
235, 5, birth control/period,occasional headaches the first few days of sugar pills,I love this pill. My periods are very light and never last more than 4 days which we all know is a blessing.

237, 5, ovarian cysts/birth control,No negative side effects - very happy with this medication. Had multiple ovarian cysts prior to using Ovcon 35....after 9 months_ I currently have none.

243, 5, IRREGULAR BLEEDING,I gained a cup size since December_ which was fine with me but I also have a little tummy which I do not like. The first month or so I was emotional_ however_ I switched from Depo (which I became immune to after 8 years!) and that could be the reason.  I have an increase in sex drive_ though I did not in the beginning.  Also_ my period is either right on time or does not come at all.  This is tough since I have an active sex life with my boyfriend.,The negatives are the tummy I have gotten and if I do not get my period the stress of going to get a pregnancy test.  Since I have become immune to other birth controls I freak out when I do not get my period!,F,28,4  months,3/21/2006,Ovcon-35

I am not a person that suffers from depression_ but with this pill I feel like the world is against me.  I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.......you feel like death.

256, 4, heavy period,breast tenderness_ migraine_ nausea_ moodiness (Irritability),I was put on Ovcon 35 due to a rpolonged heavy period while using the Paraguard IUD I've had for two years. Mt midwife advised me to take 2 pills a day until the bleeding stopped and then to finish out the pack. In 2 days_ I felt like I had morning sickness_ severe morning sickness. I have 3 children all ready. On the 3rd day I went to 1 pill and the morning sickness feeling is going away.I've been on BCP before in college and I had migraines everyday and gained weight and my face broke out.

There was one month in the middle during which I did not take it and the problems with my nose stopped until I resumed the pill.

I had two serious side effects. The first one is that my gums have been receeding. I was told by my dentist that the gum recession was due to brushing my teeth too hard. I don't believe that since the gum recession didn't begin until after I started the pill. I have always brushed my teeth the same way. The second one was a cronic sinus infection that would not go away. Now that I am no longer on the pill my sinus infection is gone with out any antibiotics and my gums are beginning to grow back. I miss taking the pill but I want to have all of my teeth when I am 40 and I don't miss the cronic sinus infection. I also don't miss spending $40 or more dollars a month.

The nausea and headaches only lasted a few days and cleared up.  The biggest problem I have with this medicine is the pain I have in my breasts now_ and hopefully that will get better.

Still_ I gave it a year - time to try something new,F,28,11  months,11/13/2005,Ovcon-35

306, 3, contraceptive and mood leveler,Nausea_ spotting_ severe breakthru bleeding when I missed one pill and then was late twice all in the same week. I have lost about 3lbs. Only a few mood swings right before I started. A little breast tenderness and a bit of a heightened sex drive.,Well_ okay. The first month was awesome. I took it within 45 minutes of the same time every night and my first period on ovcon was extremely light... not even 3 days... when I'm used to 5 heavy days. But... about 2 days later I started spotting a bit. Also_ during the week of mid-terms I missed a pill and then was like 7 to 9 hours late taking 2 pills. Yeah. I started two days after the last late pill. This is like the worst period I've ever had. I started yesterday and I have cramps that could kill a horse_ headache_ extreme nausea. So_ basically... it's a dream pill if you take it at the exact time every day... otherwise... spotting and headaches and nausea may occur... and it totally sucks! I guess that will teach me to be on-time. :( Feeling stupid and sick.,F,23,1.75  months,11/4/2005Email,Ovcon-35
307, 4, To get rid of unbearable periods.,I've been on Ovcon 4 months now and get spotting every month in between periods.  My periods are light to moderate but nothing like they were before.  I am enjoying this!  Sometimes right before the spotting occurs I get a headache on the left side of my head at the base of my neck that travels up and around.  One bad thing I noticed is that I have extreme difficulty getting out of bed in the morning and definite overall fatigue.  However_ I am losing weight which is strange but good! Before the pill I would get bloating so bad that I looked 4 months pregnant.  Gotta love a pill that will keep my weight off even when I'm a lazy bum!,Overall I like Ovcon.  I was really having major health issues with my cycle before.  Now I can enjoy being a woman without feeling like a complete mess_ emotionally and physically!,F,33,4  months,11/2/2005Email,Ovcon-35

Have been on it for almost 3 years now and haven't gotten pregnant yet (yea!  Knock on wood).  Periods evened out and became EXTREMELY light and EXTREMELY predictable.  However_ sometimes I would miss my period all together_ which is fine and dandy unless you are having sex and all of the sudden are freaked out about the absense of your period and therefore the possibility of pregnancy.  I think I would rather just get my period every month and know I'm not pregnant than not getting it...but it is still nice to not have to deal with it all the time.,F,24,3  years,10/24/2005,Ovcon-35

318, 3, To regulate menstruation,Initially I felt some nausea_ but that quickly disappeared.  What I did notice_ however_ was the complete lack of sex drive and the extreme mood swings coupled with irritability_ and some weight gain. Although I was happy to get rid of the 2 x/month period issue_ I was not too happy about the side effects.,I went from taking Micronor for 5 years(stuck with it after childbrith)_ which was a great pill_ but had to change to a pill containing estrogen b/c of the irregular periods.

My nausea actually woke me UP!  I have always taken Triphasil. Never had a problem. Had a baby_ now Gyno put me on this Ovcon stuff.  Why suffer all of these YUCKY side effects?  It's worth feeling all the nausea & weakness if you are getting a baby out of it...but to suffer like this?  Who wants to have sex when they feel so crappy?,F,33,2  days,7/7/2005,Ovcon-35
370, 2, birth control,nausea_ bloating.,I have only been taking this pill for about 2 weeks_ but the nausea is horrible. I've tried many brands and have never felt so sick to my stomach before even after taking it with food. Only started taking it because i switched to a new doctor who prescribed it after not being on any bc for about a year. Going back to Alesse which gave me no side effects.

372, 3, Birth Control,In the beginning_ I was SO excited because I had no side effects whatsoever. Which was a relief_ because I was on Yasmin before this_ and Yasmin made me feel like I was going insane and about to have a heart attack.,The one side effect that I have mixed feeling about is a wildly irregular period. The second month I was on Ovcon-35 my period was skipped altogether_ making me intensely paranoid to the point of taking several pregnancy tests (all negative_ thankfully!) despite the fact that I knew I had taken the medicine exactly as prescribed. I just got my period yesterday (Friday)_ and I don't start the inactive pills until Sunday. (Hello?!?) I need to speak with my doc to see if this is normal. Otherwise_ I'm a little more tired than normal_ but those are all of the side effects.,F,26,3  months,6/25/2005,Ovcon-35

I am getting married in less then 3 months and this is adding to my stress level.  My Dr. put me on a 'super advil' to help stop the bleeding but it hasn't. I take an active pill for 9 weeks and then the inactive pill for a week so that my PMS symptoms are less and right now I feel worse then I did off the pill.  I have another two weeks until I take an inactive pill and I am seriously thinking about telling my doctor to switch my pill because I can't deal with this anymore.  She tells me to reduce my stress level so I do and this happens_ hello more stress!  Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.,F,22,49  days,6/12/2005Email,Ovcon-35
377, 2, severe cramps_ endo,nausea every morning_ cramps throughout the day_ bloating_ minor weight gain,I'm quite unhappy with the side effects so far - but according to my doctor_ after 3 months of using this pill my abnormally thick endometrium should be more 'normal' (thus less severe cramping_ bleeding_ etc).

379, 4, Contraception,Mood swings and depression_ improved complexion,I've been experiencing severe depression AFTER my period is over_ once I start taking the active pills again.  I think it has to do with my body readjusting to the hormones after a week of not taking it.  It lasts a few days to a week.  So_ if you're experiencing depression_ take note of the time of month.  It may be your body readjusting.Thankfully_ though_ I don't get withdrawal migraines from not taking it during the week of my period like I used to with Estrostep.,F,28,8  months,6/6/2005,Ovcon-35
