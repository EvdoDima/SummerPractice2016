1, 5, For Crohn's Disease to boost my Rem,Weight gain_hair loss_appetite increase,Imuran has improved my remicade to work over a 2mth period but has caused my hct to drop down to 0 now i have to have iron infusions which causes my Crohn's to flare up dramatically and the pain gets to be unbearable but it works for sure and Im happy about that but cant deal with the hair loss and severe weight gain.,F,43,2  months100mg,5/27/2016,Imuran

3, 5, Lupus,I started out at 50mg once a day for 4 months_ but fluid began building up around my heart again. So doctor increased to 75 for a month and finally to my maintenance dose of 100mg a day. It takes about 3 months for this drug to take full effect. I place the pills in gel capsules to prevent stomach upset and also take it with a meal. I have IBS and have had no stomach upset at all from Imuran. I can't think of any side effects I have had from it. I am really doing much better...except for periodic bouts of fatigue. I am back to exercising most days....less muscle pain.,Imuran does not help with Lupus fatigue at all_ but I am relieved to have no more organ involvement. So far the periodic blood checks have shown no problem with liver function due to Imuran. Once I have been on my maintenance does for one year_ the doctor wants to begin reducing the dose and see if I can go without it for a while. I am glad this one works for me as I had a very bad allergic reaction to Plaquenal...covered in hives.  Everyone is different so don't let the negative comments steer you away. I am just glad there is something to treat this illness. Wish there were more options available though. For me.....so far_ so good....for now.,,68,1  years100 mg 1X D,3/23/2016Email,Imuran

STOP THIS DRUG!,My husband was given a 40% survival rate (only that high because we caught it early).  He had to undergo extreme chemo & had a bone marrow transplant. He almost died several times. We are broke_ he lost his business & he is now at high risk for other cancers. He has residual side effects from the ordeal including chronic fatigue. The Dr. did not warn us of a possibility of contracting this cancer & there was no warning at the time he started it. Now there is a black box warning. The Dr. did not monitor my husbands levels. as a matter of fact_ he did not even have him come in for a checkup for 3 years. He just kept filling the script over the phone.

30, 1, Myositis,Dizziness_ severe muscle spasms_ stomach pain_ lightheadedness.,I started taking Imuran because Prednisone wasn't controlling the release of muscle enzymes.  Soon after starting Imuran_ I had  a 103 fever for three days which developed after being in a cold room for 2 hours.  After feeling generally lousy for three weeks_ I realized the Imuran may be the cause.  During that time_ I hurt my back just from doing very light exercise and the pain never went away. For 4 weeks_ I suffered from a severe back ache. Two days after stopping Imuran_ the back ache got better_ dizziness and all other symptoms disappeared.,F,52,4  weeks50 mg. 2X D,8/20/2014Email,Imuran

36, 2, Crohn's,While Imuran kept my Crohn's disease in remission for many years_ it has done tremendous damage to my liver. Only after vomiting blood did I find out that the Imuran had caused  hepatoportal sclerosis_ which caused enlarged varices in my esophagus and stomach. I have since had to have a surgical shunt procedure performed. I'm not sure what the outcome of this will be_ but I'm not optimistic......,ASK QUESTIONS! Make yourself an informed patient by researching the side effects of Imuran. A live biopsy can be performed as an outpatient procedure_ if you've been on this drug for any extended period of time_ and your doctor notices any change in your liver enzymes_ get one done.,M,49,10  years150 mg 1X D,4/14/2014Email,Imuran
37, 4, Colitis,Initially I had no side effects_ and Imuran has really helped to bring my colitis under control.  It was starting to dominate my life.  After 6 months on the tablets I began to experience joint pain in my fingers_ knees and feet.  This has got to the point that I am having significant difficulty walking_ especially after sitting/ waking up.  Xrays show no sign of arthritis.  With reluctance I am now coming off the tablets.  They have in my opinion helped me significantly.,Great results with my Colitis_ just the negatives started to out weigh the positives.,F,43,1  years100mg 1X D,4/5/2014Email,Imuran
38, 3, Autoimmune Hepatitis,Moderate to severe (after physical exertion) joint and muscle pain.  Knees_ elbows_ shoulders_ fingers and spine affected the most.  A throbbing deep bone pain in my legs if standing for any length of time.  Thinning and coarser hair. Unable to sleep but I think that's because of the pain. Joints seize up if in one position for too long.,Works wonderfully for keeping my AIH in remission.  The side effects are disabling at times however.  Was on steroids before and during the first 2 months of Imuran and I CAN NOT handle the side effects of prednisone.  Will deal with pain any day over the freak show that is prednisone!,F,37,4  months75 mg 1X D,2/3/2014,Imuran
39, 4, Crohns,Nausea to being with which lasted quite a while without improving. Rather than give up on it the doctor prescribed lanzaprozole to suppress stomach acid  and that has helped enormously and allows me to tolerate the imuran. Have had more colds and bugs than normal_ and one particularly nasty throat infection but this is much better than having a crohns flare.  Have recently started to get a lot of joint pain but not clear if this is due to Imuran or not and as long as bloods stay ok I wouldn't swap it for what went before.,Hospitalised three times in the 12 months prior to starting but under control since. Very closely monitored with bloods test and good access to both my GP and GI so when there have been 'scares' along the way have always felt in control.,M,31,18  months150mg 1X D,1/6/2014,Imuran

45, 2, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia,acquired hemolytic anemia from what I believe was a side effect of other medications I was prescribed for a head injury.  After 2 years of taking it  I was experiencing sweats_ joint muscle pain_ very dark urine_ jaundiced eyes_ weakness_ HGB 90_  abdominal pain and I decided as a last resort I would quit taking it.,almost immediately my urine started clearing _ over the next month the sweating stopped and I felt cooler_  the abdominal pain has almost completely subsided_ the jaundice has almost gone.  I feel a bit stronger. I will see what the next blood tests say but I am thinking I did the right thing .  Everybody is different and though stopping seems to be working for me it may not for someone else. I should add that I have been extremely careful with my diet ; ie very little junk food_ alcohol and eating lots of red meat_ vegetables_ dates_ fish_ etc. I have been taking supplements _ walking... not sure if this info will be helpful to anyone else or not .  my last HGB count was 97 (after 6 weeks)and I feel it is rising.

48, 3, Rheumatoid Arthritis_ Pericarditis,Occasional_ mild acid reflux,I believe that Imuran is the reason I can get my prednisone dose down to a minimal maintenance dose. It took a few weeks to take effect_ and the effect was not dramatic for me.  I just know I'm at the lowest dose of prednisone I've been on for over a year.,F,50,5  months150 mg 2X D,9/9/2013,Imuran
49, 5, Polymiositis/Autoimmune Muscle Dise,Stiff wrists_ hands_ hips and back but not all the time. Difficulty with heat_ excessive sweating.,It's hard to say sometimes if it's the imuran_ my condition_ or menopause. But my blood work comes back great so I don't think it can be the disease if it's under control by the imuran. I used to love the heat but now I sweat like crazy. The joint pain comes and goes. It is sometimes nonexistent. Over all it is a God send because without I would probably be in a wheelchair or worse it could have moved into my lungs or heart. So some aches and pains far out-way the alternative. Was previously on prednisone and methotrexate. Prednisone takes care of the symptoms but makes you look awful. It's bad enough to be sick but then to add the feeling of not wanting to go out of the house is cruel. Methotrexate got rid of the symptoms as well but replaced the fatigue of my disease with fatigue of methotrexate.,F,52,9  months75mg 1X D,8/31/2013Email,Imuran
50, 5, UC,Some nausea to begin with_ but started to take the tablets one in morning and one at night and it soon passed. After a couple of weeks I started to take them both at same time (night) again and it was fine.,I have had UC for 23yrs. My doctor had tried everything to stop my UC flare ups and eventually I was unable to come off the steroids. Taking Imuran was the only was I got rid of the steroids. I've had a couple of minor flares since taking the medication_ but that is mainly due to me forgetting to get my new prescriptions on time. If it hadn't been for this medication_ I would have had my bowel removed 9 years ago. I am fit and health - but I now feel the time is right to try and come off of the Imuran to see how I go. My doctor is right behind me and after my next colonoscopy (as long as there are no ulcerations) I will come off it. I am nervous as it works so well_ but would not hesitate to go back on it again if needed. The side effects are a worry_ but they are not as common as people think. So fingers crossed!,F,36,9  years100mg 1X D,7/29/2013Email,Imuran

I do not have time now to meditate_ relax & give herbal medicine time to work. So I have had to succumb to my Drs wished and take the stupid drugs (I thought as a quick fix_ boy was I wrong). NEVER AGAIN! The side affects of the prednisone and imuran are far worse than the symptoms of Crohns. This weekend I thought I had 3 heart attacks. The pain in my chest was that bad I nearly called an ambulance. That was the last straw. I went back to my specialist and she told me to stop the imuran as she had only ever had 1 other patient that complained of this too. I had constant chest pain for 4days I stopped taking the imuran yesterday and the pain has gone. I am nearly off the prednisone now too. Back to natural medicine I go. It has done more for me than this other crap!. Acupuncture_ chinese and herbal medicine deals with Crohns Diesease in a much more humane manner.

I also would go through episodes where I would get very light-headed_ dizzy_ become extremely pale_ sometimes would faint_ severe debilitating migraines_ jaw tension_ sensitity to light_ moderate acne. Since I got myself off this drug_ all those symtops except the jaw tension and severe migraines_ ceased. The migraines I believe are a result of the other drugs I have to take for UC_ namely asacol. When I have a flare up_ I am prescribed predinsone_ which makes those symtops worse_ and the prednisone has had a diminisioning effect over time_ as that happens with a steroids. My best advice is to have a serious talk with your M.D. and do not let them intimidate you with medical talk. The majority of M.D.'s_ only know how to throw drugs at a problem_ and will do so because that is where they get their funding. Explain to your doctor they cannot hide behind drugs anymore_ and that they need to address these issuses with logic_ reason_ and COMPASSION. I have fired my GI_ and am now under the care of another_ that is working with me to get me off_ and keep me off the meds. In conclusion_ STAY AWAY FROM PREDNISONE_ IMURAN_ ASACOL_ and all the other chemicals the medical industry will throw at you_ and find a REAL doctor.,,M,26,3  years30mg daily,6/24/2012,Imuran

I got sick with a respiratory virus and respiratory bacteria.  I was admitted to the hospital and within 2 days_ I had been intubated and was on a ventilator to help me breath.  I was in a medicated coma for 14 days.  I had interstitial pneumonitis due to toxicity of the Imuran in my lungs_ which allowed the diseases to take over.  My lungs were not the only things affected.  My liver shut down_ as well as my kidneys (did dialysis for 5 weeks)_ and my intestines too.  The doctors said I had a 70% chance of dying_ but thankfully for my family and friends who prayed over me EVERY SINGLE DAY_ I am now home and recovering!!!  I am only 32_ and if this had happened to someone older_ they may not have survived!

I also cannot wake up in the morning even though I sleep early and sleep quite well. My rheumatologist told me that the hair loss and fatigue are probably from the lupus itself; the reason being that the drug (imuran) is still hasn't kicked in yet_ since My blood test results still show that my immune system is still very active.

I feel that prednisone (which I took for about a year and a half) was a million times worse.  I have mild to moderate acne as a result of the med but it is manageable.  I believe that many of the symptoms which people are attributing to Imuran may be the result of Prednisone (if taken together) because I also had a huge moon face_ weight gain_ cystic acne_ facial hair_ ect.,I will have to take Azathioprine for life because my AIH relapsed after being removed from the med.

Stayed on it_ side effects continued. Stopped after a year and never had these side effects since. Skin growths_ of course_ remain though. Changing my diet was more beneficial than taking Imuran. I really recommend making serious changes to  your diet before starting a drug like Imuran. The reason why Imuran causes skin growths in many patients is because it has the ability to cause cancer. Your doctor might downplay this_ but if it happens to you_ well_ that really sucks for you and what does it matter to your Dr? He/She might pretend to care_ but the fact is most GIs don't; and even if you have one who truly does_ it doesn't change anything. Using Imuran is basically throwing your money away_ wasting your time going to see your GI (and he/she'll probably just look at you during the appt)_ and you might get cancer_ or just even skin growths and other such things.

He started taking Imuran in September when he experienced extreme pain in his abdonmen which radiated through to his back.  He seeked medical attention on more than 6 occasions but not one doctor could find the cause of his pain.  In late October he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer which had spread to his liver.  This disease is terminal.  He passed away in January of 2010 only 9 weeks after being diagnosed (aged 45).  We will never know if this medication caused his cancer but I am sure it play some part.  I would be extremely cautious about taking Imuran.,M,45,14  days,1/31/2010,Imuran

The pains inmy stomach were so severe i couldn't even stand up straight. I was then put in the hospital for a week_ and my dotors took me completly off of IMURAN. They said that the pains in my abdominal might be caused from the medicine. It is now almost three months later and i'm experiencing severe pains again.

Because I'm always freaking out about being on such toxic drugs my gastro tells me I can reduce after two years but he keeps asking 'what's the alternative?'

You can't assume your doctor knows what's going on.

278, 1, Crohn's colitis,Neoplasia_ extreme nausea_ infections of all kinds_ sore throat and a cold the whole time I was on it_ extreme weakness_ extreme fatigue_ so tired I could barely move_ it was like my body was just shutting down_ warts all over my body and face_ acne.,It doesn't work_ just suppresses your entire immune system_ which basically assures you're going to get infections and things like that and it also makes you sick and can possibly give you skin cancer_ leukemia_ or lymphoma. You have an immune system for a reason. It's pretty stupid_ I think_ for doctors to give you a drug that shuts down your entire immune system. This might work for some people with very mild forms of the disease. For people with serious or even severe forms_ however_ in my experience_ it doesn't work at all. Probably the people for whom it works are only experiencing a placebo effect and could get the same effect from a sugar pill--without the serious risks_ of course.,F,,7  months,8/22/2008,Imuran

280, 1, Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Fatigue_ jaundice_ Hair thinning (no loss yet)_ Interstitial pulmonary infection_ Excessive sweating,My mother has been on Imuran for about 2 months and so far has been hospitalised for a severe pulmonary infection.  She is 69 and the doctor that was called out to see her at home seriously didn't think she'd make it.  She is tired all the time and suffers with yellow jaundiced eyes.  She hasn't lost any hair yet but it's thinning and only time will tell I guess.  My mother is a get-up-and-go woman who cannot sit still but since she has been on Imuran she has lost her zest for life and I am very worried - I have never seen her like this before.  We are at present compiling reserach on alternative treatments.,F,69,2  months,8/2/2008,Imuran
281, 5, microscopic colitis,Nausea if I don't eat a hearty breakfast when I take the Imuran.,I didn't respond to traditional drugs or diet for microscopic colitis_ even Prednisone.  Imuran has saved my life.  I started on 50mg_ and then 8 weeks later another 50mg_ and then 8 weeks later he increased it by 25mg.  I think I am good to go now.  I really couldn't tell it helped until recently.  I also have been taking Entocort to help me get by until the Imuran kicked in.  I am weaning off the Entocort now.  I get my blood tested regularly and everything so far is good.  Fingers crossed!,F,54,5  months,7/26/2008Email,Imuran
282, 1, Auto Immune Hepatitis,2 hours after taking the pill for the first time_ became violently ill_ vomiting and diarrhea at the same time. At times blood both ways also. Immense pain in stomach. Became uncontrollable. This lasted for over an hour when my office called the paramedics.  My stomach lining was being torn up by the pill. Two days after being off the pill_ I was fine.,I would not recommend this pill to anyone. I have been taking prednisone for over two years. I have gained over 50 pounds and my face in quite full.  However_ can live with these sides effects without hesitation compared to those of Imuran.  Imuran is a nasty drug with too many bad side effects.  Don't take it.,F,60,1  days,7/26/2008,Imuran

I wonder if that's why Imuran didn't work for me and why I only had bad reactions. My skin is still yellow and I've been off Imuran for quite some time now. I wonder if my yellow skin could be a sign of a liver problem? I know Imuran takes a while to get out of your system_ but it seems like my skin should return a normal color at some point...i don't like this drug.,F,33,7  months,7/24/2008,Imuran

Reciently I have had my dosage dropped to 50 mg from 100mg and have noticed an increase in hip abduction pain and muscle spasms.  I have also found it difficult to take the weight off I gained from the use of prednisone.  The muscle spasms are what is really troubling me_ because I can not tell if it is a side-effect_ withdrawl_ or something else completly.,I am completly greatful to have my life back thanks to prednisone and imuran. I would like to find more information about any withdrawl symptoms imuran may have.,M,32,1.5  years,7/13/2008Email,Imuran

My disease was supposedly very severe_ and yet I put my disease in remission with just a strict diet and probiotics. The drugs never did anything for my disease_ just bad things for my overall health and quality of life. If you know what to expect_ of course_ you can mitigate and prevent some of the damage the drugs can cause. Still_ I'd recommend trying the safer treatments first. For me_ they weren't just safer; they were also more effective.,M,,4  months,6/26/2008,Imuran

Ended  up in hospital with severe pancreatitis_ hospital did'nt make the connection between the pancreatitis and the medication and told me to carry on taking it_ eventually stopped taking it myself took the hospital 6 weeks to make the connection.  I lost six months of my life from taking this medication_ thats how long it took me to recover_ even now i have stomach problems which have never stopped.  The RA Consultant said to me well when you started to feel unwell you should hae stopped taking it_ bit difficult when you have been given no warnings and not being told to have your blood tested. If you are ever given this drug_ make sure you get  your blood tested very early on_ if I had i would have known to stop taking it.,M,44,21  days,6/25/2008,Imuran

You really need to be monitored closely on this drug. And there are serious risks--like cancer--so keep that in mind. Don't let you doctor brush aside your concerns.

I nearly lost my whole bowel. i was dependent on prednisolone for nearly a year and had put on over 2 stone which i have now lost_ so glad to be off the steroids i had terrible side effects from them_ didnt sleep for about 3 months. Since starting on imuran my uc symptoms have decreased_ minimal bowel pain and less bowel movements_ has given me my life back without the operation_ apart from the joint pain and tiredness but ill suffer it as long as i can_ never want to be that sick again and want to avoid operation for as long as possible.,F,23,6  months,5/26/2008Email,Imuran

I no longer have blood in my stools. No more severe cramping that has put me in the hospital 3 times now. I went to the GI yesterday and I am finally coming off prednisone_ im nervous cuz everytime I do_ everything comes back...This is the longest I have ever been on it though. Started at 50mg and came down every 2 weeks_ 40_ 30_ 20_ 10_ 5...It turns out im alergic to Asacol which I know is the prefered drug for UC. All in all_ I like Imuran so far..

I also feel very anxious and nervous most of the time. I noticed that I started feeling this way after a feww months of taking Imuran_ although there could be other factors (stressors) involved.,Taking it for Wegener's Granulomatosis Vasculitis.

296, 3, UC,tiredness_ redness in face_ sensitive teeth_ hair loss_ achy joints_ mood changes_ weight gain_ bloated_ moon face_ night sweats_ blood sugar rise...the latter of these prolly from steriod usage.,"Started Imuran 100mg daily_ while hospitalized in dec 07; in addition to 40mg of Prednisone then tapering down 5mg every 2 weeks. I was extremely dehydrated/anemiac and had severe UC that could not get into remission w/out spending 3.5 weeks in the hospital. They kept talking about surgery until they put me on Imuran and I did a 180 turn for the better! Has helped tremedously in keeping inflammation at bay. Recently have had some inflamation in rectum area_ and have been bumped back up to 15mg daily of prednisone; then will very slowly taper over next few weeks. Not sure if my side effects have been from the steriod or Imuran itself; but was curious about my hair loss and wanted to see if others have experienced it. I used to have beautiful wavy hair_ now very thin and kinky and can not get it to do anything I'd like it to do! Very upset by this as well as my ""bloated"" appearance.

White blood count very high and Red blood count low.  Had blood transfusion.  I'm considering surgery.  Hopefully being on prednisone for a few months will buy me some time to get a ""real"" GI doctor that knows what they are doing - like at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota - I hope.  I've only got 5 weeks of high school left before graduation.  I can't be sick for that!  I will definately be doing something this summer.

That's the story so far.,I couldn't sleep because I sweated at night before I started on Imuran.  So I was tired all the time and itchy with excema.  Captain Imuran came to the rescue though and I have had no side effects since that initial hiccup with fever.

I take the whole dose in the morning along with Colazal. I also depend on regular doses of fiber supplements. I take the fiber in between colazal doses.

The doctors put me on Imuran the same day as the put me on remicade and the nausea was pretty horrible_ i've spent much of the last 5 months in bed - but i've been almost symptom free from the original illness as well. I quit Imuran two weeks ago and the nausea is gone_ so are the migraines. I have_ however_ had a pretty upset stomach for the last few days_ but i am hoping it is just a coincidence... Doctors say it's important to stay on Imuran for 6 months after you start remicade_ and the wean off it so remicade can work its wonder by itself.

After 1 month (Dose increased weekly from 50mg-200mg)began having neck pain causing headaches (might be related to misalignment in neck) A week later when a cold hit I had severe knee and foot pain along with fatigue.  Dropping dosage back down to 100 mg has reduced the symptoms to cramping in my feet and hands and the headaches.  With all I've read I am hoping my doc gets me off this soon (though I'll be stuck on the Medrol for at least another couple months).,One doc told me that it takes a month or two for the Imuran to build up to effectiveness.  I guess that would mean for all of us who survived the initial dosage without problems have to wait a while to see what side effects might be there.  Overall_ I can't tell if the Imuran has had any effect on my treatment_ if the corticosteroids have been doing the trick (since getting out of the hospital)_ or if the disorder has run it's course.,M,34,6  weeks,2/14/2008,Imuran

But this is still much better than the alternative_ which is UC in full active attack. Still have minor bleeding problems and not all inflamation has dissapeared. Some days better than others regarding typical symptoms.,I take 200 mg/day at dose of 2 mg/kg body weight. Adding maximum dose of Asacol (4x3time/day) to make this combinination work better. Without both together neither works well. Without both of these drugs my life really sucks. I am greatful to have it.

About a week later I had bad stomach aches similar to what I used to have when eating acidic foods. Since I'm on 20 mg. of Achiphex 2X day for GERD_ we didn't think this would be a problem_ but it was. Staggaring the dose didn't help either.

The doctor refuesed to believe it to be Imuran. After trying Asacol (didn't work) I said I'll prove Imuran is bad for me. I took one pill - mistake. By that evening_ I had the high fever and extreme knee pain. The fever lasted about 5 days and the knee pain lasted over two weeks. This occured 6 years ago.

It took about 3 months for the Imuran to start working_ and was able to wean off of the steroid. I don't have any side effects other than occasionally my White Cell count goes a bit too low. My doctor has me  go off the med for 5 days_ then repeat my CBC_ then go back on. I only wish I could have started this drug with my first doctor!

I havn't lost any hair yet but after reading all this Im scared I will.  I have been taking Omega 3 flax and fish oils + vitamins for about a year-so maybe that has helped with the hair thing.  After being on this for 3 months and being totally better I had a slight flare again and upped my dosage.

The nausea and vomitting were horrible and unexpected (no_ I did not have a virus... I was fine during the day and evening)...but I am glad they happened cause it's a reason to get off it before i wasted too much more time_ and I will now hopefully move on to something that will actually work for me (6 months since diagnosed and still looking)!

Have been slowly increasing over last three months. Was sitting pretty until recently when dose was increased to 125mg. Now starting to experience severe stomach pain_ my fingers feel like they're made of glass and I have a general feeling of unwellness (whereas when on a lower dose I was feeling the best I had for months). Dr insists dose needs to be increased and that it won't 'work' on less than 150mg. Seems to be helping with arthritis_ inflammation not as severe and I'm now down to 3mg prednisolone but I'm finding it a frightening drug to be on especially now that I'm experiencing some weird things!,F,35,3  months,12/11/2007,Imuran
327, 4, Autoimmune hepatitis,I have had some hair loss_ change of texture in hair_ extreme fatigue.  I have had bouts of extreme joint pain.  After being on it for approximately 4 years I am slowly becoming crippled by extreme joint pain in my hands fingers and wrists. over the last 5 months I have developed several locking fingers on the right hand_ and it is now spreading to my thumbs.  When not totally locked in either opened or closed position_ the large joints at the base of each digit is extremely painful to touch_ making it hard to accomplish many tasks.  I do not know if this is another aspect of my autoimmune journey or if it is the medication.I have lost 2 dental bone grafts in the last two years after developing serious infections_ about 2-3 months into each graft.  I showed no serilogical indications of having these infections such as elevated WBC's.,The positive part is:  Prior to starting the prednisone (off that now) and the imuran_ I was so ill that it was hard for me to walk across the room.  I was constantly nauseated_ weak_ tired and had over all lethargy.  My liver enzymes were in the 1040 rang for one_ and 980 for the other. They have been normal for several years_ except when I went off the medication and went out of remission. Over all I think the imuran did improve my life.  I was so ill prior to taking it.  I have had some really good years and was well enough to enjoy both my daugters weddings.,F,55,4  years,11/11/2007,Imuran

I've been off and on prednisone and my longest remission has been about 3 months. I've noticed that being on imuran has led to fewer flare ups. However_ losing my hair is horrible. I used to have really really thick hair now it's really really thin_ but I'd much rather live with thin hair then having to constantly use the bathroom. within the past year i've noticed tightening of the chest and constant headaches. I've also noticed joint pain in the knee and lower back pain which forced me to quit playing tennis and basketball which was basically my life.

Now 3 weeks into it I have quite a bit of hairloss_ actual vomitting within an hour or so of taking it and a wierd rash (hives?) on my chin and below my nose.,Emailed my Dr. because the vomitting is getting worse_ last night I threw up for about an hour_ about 1 hour after I took the pill.  The rash on my face is tollerable_ hopefully it doesn't get worse.  The hairloss just started so not sure how bad that will get.  Hoping he can give me something for the vomiting but we'll see on Wednesday at my f/u appt.

I'm still losing hair_ not as much & have joint pain.,It did not work for me_ however I did try something that completely worked and thought I'd mention it for those who fall into my category.  I was diagnosed in my 30's with UC after I quit smoking.  I started smoking again and didn't think much of the correlation with the nicotine and it went away.  I sporadically quit smoking off and on over the years and now looking back noticed that's when I got symptoms.  I quit smoking 4 years ago again and had symptoms 2 months after.  I tried EVERYTHING_ including Imuran and steroids with minimal results.  Facing surgery (complete removal of my large intestine in two procedures)_ I started reading studies and found a relationship with the nicotine.  I started to smoke again (1 day before my 4 year anniversary of quitting) and with 2 1/2 weeks_ I barely had any symptoms.  I have been smoking (only about 4-5 cigarettes in the evenings) now 2 months and am off all drugs and symptom-free.

A severe bout of throwing-up once caused me to be admitted in the hospital.,I have been having back pain on and off.   The pain is getting worse.  I am also having weakness in my legs_ ankles and arms.  I'm losing  weight and a feeling of something isn't right.  Would like to know if anyone who has taken this drug for a while has noticed these symptoms.  Also_ I am African American and have noticed a definite change in coloring of my skin.  First_ it was only in the summer.  I'm only on 3mg of prednisone a day. 150Mg of Imuran and 200mg of plaquenil. I am trying to figure out what is causing the feeling of malaise I've been experiencing recently. I don't think it is the prednisone or the plaquenil.  Imuran has really helped_ but I wonder if it has turned toxic to my system.  It is definitely a drug with advantages.  email if you can give any information.,F,60,6  years,9/4/2007,Imuran
338, 5, crohns,I have had crohns disease since by 20's and was on a zulfidene drug for many years. Then Went on Imuran have been on it for over 18 years.It was working very well_ until now. Was out of remission in April and to go on Predisone 50mg_ reduced now to 10mg. Meanwhile my doctor increase the imuran to 125_ started noticing my feet was getting numb_ didn't think anything of yet_ until slowly it started getting worse. Told my doctor he thought it was the Imuran. Slowly getting off the predisone. Finally went to the hospital due to the numbness and tingling_ etc in both feet_ said I had neuroapthy. Went to my Dr. and she put me on this drug for it_ made me very dizzy_ stopped in one day. Finally_ went to a neuro Doctor_ comfirmed i had this disease combination of having Crohns and the Imuran. When your auto-immune system is so low_ you get everything_ have had shingles_ thyroid problem now. Your white blood count has to be checked every 3 months which I do_ because of this drug. I am telling m,Imuran is a very good drug for crohns_ but long term use can be very damaging it seems. I have problems with it now and I feel it is time to change to another drug for my crohns.

(I was at that point only on Prednisone_ previously had been taking the two drugs.) That is_ the number of times I had to use the bathroom (diarrhea) was cut in half to 10 by the first day and down to two by the second. Be careful with this drug! I stopped after 30 days.,F,45,30  days,8/28/2007,Imuran
340, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Although I felt tired and drained and experienced hair loss_ I feel some of this may have just been due to how severely ill I was by the time I finally had imuran prescribed for me. The last major attack of ulcerative colitis required 2 hospitalizations and took almost 5 years to bring under control.,If the alternative to coming off imuran is to feel as sick as I did before taking it_ I will stay on it as long as my doctors feel that it is safe. Being fatigued a little earlier in the day is a small price to pay compared to what a full blown attack does to your life.  I put on almost 90 pounds with long term usage of prednizone (75 off after 4 years)and dealt with all the psychotic side effects of that drug. I just sleep a little earlier_ keep a positive outlook_ smell the roses every day and am grateful to imuran for giving me back my life.,F,47,7  years,8/27/2007Email,Imuran

I don't like the sore/achy joints especially considering I am used to being very active_ but it's better than being in the hospital and having surgery_ which I have had twice.

342, 2, Ulcerative Pancolitis,Increased fatigue_ nauseous_ hair loss_ loss of appetite_ headaches_ and I think causing acne-never had it before,Imuran worked to get me off prednisone.  After reaching 150mg I really started experiencing the side effects; hair loss_ loss of appetite and bad headaches.  My doctor said to stick with it_ so I have.  I am still tired a lot_ I still experience hair loss_ appetite is gone_ BUT over time the headaches stopped almost completely and I do not feel as nauseous as I did.  Acne on my face has now showed up?  Not pretty and I can only assume its because of this drug-I have never had acne before.  If you can stand the side effects hang in there_ it does get a little better with time.  For me it seems to be doing the job on the UC and keeping me off prednisone-which is great.  This is not a miracle drug for me_ it has a ton of side effects and it has not made the symptoms of UC go away completely_ but it seems to be the only thing working for me.,F,28,3  months,8/27/2007,Imuran

But I'm always tired_ especially in the early afternoon time_ but when it's time for bed_ I can't sleep.  I end up staying up late doing laundry or something else.  Besides that_ it really hasn't helped my symptoms at all.  I still have the same things_ except for the excrutiating pain I had in the several months prior to surgery.

For me it has been a fantastic treatment_ in addition to bowel symptoms I had severe joint problems as part of the Crohn's and much of this has abated. I still have the occassional 'bad' bowel days_ my iron levels are generally a bit low and my joints a bit tender_ but as a rule 50mg of Imuran has kept me well.

I don't know if this constitutes an allergic reaction_ and I also believe this is probably very rare_ but it was the sickest I have ever been.  This is not meant to scare anyone and I was so disappointed because I had read here of all the positive things folks had to say about it.,I didn't know how to rate my satisfaction with Imuran so I rated it a 2 because it didn't work for me.

I also have acne and strange rashes on my chest and back.  I have been using Proactive for the acne_ which has always worked for me to clear up minor zits in the past_ but I am having no results this time.  I feel like I am fighting a losing battle.

So I tried Imuran (Azathioprine) @ 50MG per day. For the first 12 days all was well.  On day #13 I started a low-grade fever_ headache and leg muscle pain. This was all minor compared to the almost crippling pain I experience in my knees_ ankles_ and lower back over the next three days. On day #18 a sudden and terrible pain in my upper center abdomen was added to the mix.  This pain landed me in the hospital where I was diagnosed with a pancreatitis.

It is fast acting and hard to diagnose and has a mortality rate as high as 50% and patients can have impaired reason so might not know they are that sick. You basically go into toxic shock and have organ failure. It might be too advanced to cure if you wait for a lab result as it progresses rapidly within days and seems ot escalate fast in the last 24 hours. Different viruses have a variation of morbidity rates. He got 2 different cases of Septicemia. They cured the first one and a more aggressive germ got him a few days after he was taken off life support and within a few days he went into shock and had a heart attack.,My father took Imuran for 1 week and on his follow-up appointment (7 days later) he had a fever of 101. He was getting sick and the doctor gave him a prescription and told him that he could fill it in the evening if he needed it. When my mom took him to the hospital's emergency room that evening with a fever of almost 104 and chills_ the doctors sent him home with aspirin and an antibiotic_ which he may or may not have taken as he was very ill. He seemed to get better and we thought he was taking his medicine but he almost died that Friday as he started going into toxic shock and his Kidneys started to fail_ it takes 2-3 days to get lab results.

It started coming out when I was on 75mg and now I am on 100mg :( I hope it will stop falling out and grow back because this drug has been working great for me so far.  I won't know for sure if the benefits will last until I can wean off the prednisone_ but I am just coming out of a bad flare and 50mg+10mg pred was not bringing me out.

418, 5, Crohn's Disease,"Initially lots of hair loss - distressing.  Tapered off over time and Nioxin shampoo system has helped that tremendously.  Diagnosed 10 years ago_ have been in ""remission"" since 1997 with help of Imuran & Asacol - have never had Crohn's related surgery.  No other med has helped or had intolerable side effects.  I believe Imuran was ""investigational"" for Crohn's when I started.  Has been a life saver to me.",Have been on it nearly 10 years_ now only blood testing every 6 months. Still flare from alcohol and shell fish.  Had to get off it for pregnancy (didn't do so in time) and had a healthy child but a very difficult pregnancy with serious complications (maybe/maybe not due to meds?).  Flared after birth and got right back on it.  Been fine 5 years now.

434, 3, Ulcerative Colitis,Hair loss_ recurrent respiratory infections_ fatigue_ general malaise,I was desperate to get off the predisolone treadmill and so ended up taking 200mg of AZT a day which left me feeling like I'd been run over by a bus_ especially as my tonsils seemed to be on some major crusade for about 7 weeks! Eventually my new consultant agreed that I should stop taking it although he thought I could have got away with only 100mg. Unfortunately my colitis flared badly when I stopped (proving at least that AZT does work in my case!) and for the moment I'm having a go with Asacol instead. That said_ the symptoms of the flare have been so unpleasant that I think I would reconsider the AZT at a lower dose if necessary. I can tolerate it_ and it is a great drug for many people_ I guess it's getting a balance with quality of life!

435, 4, ulcerative colitis,Very_ very serious FATIGUE.  However_ I think it is possible or even likely that the fatigue is due more to the disaese (ulcerative colitis) than the Imuran.

The Journal of American Gastroenterology says up to 40% of ulcerative colitis patients have problems with fatigue_ EVEN WHILE THE DISEASE IS NOT ACTIVE.,I take 175mg per day.  I may have some hair loss_ but it isn't a major problem.  It took a VERY long time for this drug to start working.  Don't gove up.  ALSO_ it is possible that the generic doesn't work as well for me.

492, 4, Crohn's disease,None_ except perhaps the tireds,I was afraid of taking the drug and resisted for 2 years. I've had a mild case of Crohn's confined to the mid ileum for which I had a bypass resection in 1978. I then enjoyed a 20 year remission without meds. Activity began again in 1999 at both the anastomosis and a new area near the ileocecal valve. A short bout of Flagyl and daily Pentasa put it in remission. Disease activity began again at the ileocecal valve_ mild but there_ so I finally opted to take Imuran in April 2003. So far_ so good. Inflammation has been receding via fecal calprotectin test and Ceretec WBC scan.,F,61,7  months,11/29/2003,Imuran
493, 4, Crohn's Disease,Now on Imuran for 2 years_ I am experiencing fatigue_ nausea (no vomitting yet)_ slight weight loss_ but sadly...some hair loss. No problem though...they have great girly wigs and hair extensions which I'm looking into.  Hey...it's only hair right? But for a fashion-conscious gal like me_ hair is essential (sorry girls_ but no hair-loss on legs nor under arms.,Frequency of required blood monitoring is somewhat of a pain_ but if for my safety...I'll continue to be a good patient.,F,40,2  years,2/11/2003Email,Imuran
