This is a blow by blow but overall let me say that on a scale of 1-10 (10 being awful)_ even on the worst days I would give it a 4.  I never missed a day of work_ though I did go to bed earlier and sometimes slept in.  At week 14 I did a fast_ 1 week turn around trip to Africa_ and though tired_ actually felt mostly OK.Week 1: No side effectsWeek 2: mouth sores for about 3 days_ the first day it felt like a burned my mouth (like after you eat a hot piece of pizza)  The third was somewhat sore_ like having a bunch of cold sores.  Then it just went away on its own Only came back for a couple of other days around week 5. Also low white blood cell count (3) from a starting point of 14.  They give me neupogen the day before next session (Week 3).  It works (WBC 27) but really makes me feel achy in my bones for a day.  Insurance will not cover_ so they switch me to granix.  Went for a 3 day 35mile backpacking trip aft,Diagnosed at 48.  Triple positive so had weekly taxol for 12 weeks starting 5 weeks post surgery to remove lump.  Also taking Herceptin which I started first. Side effects worse than Herceptin alsone_ but overall quite manageable.

Started with dose dense A/C for four treatments every other Tuesday and ended with dose dense Taxol_ four treatments every other Tuesday for a total of 16 weeks of chemotherapy.

Side effects not suffered include nausea_ intestinal problem_ heart or kidney problems.,"I have had 20 injections (each lasting 2 hours) of Taxol in the last 26 weeks. I take 3 weeks in a row_ skip a week_ and then start another 3 weeks of injections. Currently I will be skipping 3 weeks (impending cataract surgery) and resuming weekly injections on June 13th. I have found that this skipping allows my body time to rebuild and not leave me completely drained and weak..The day of and the day after chemo are my coming down from the steroids days. Days 3 and 4 after chemo are generally my ""don't do anything"" and rest days. Days 5 and 6 are my ""normal"" and productive days. The latest CT scan shows that Taxol has reduced the cancer mass in my lung to one-third the size it was before Taxol. Prior to Taxol I was on Carboplatin every 3 weeks_ however this chemo still allowed for the effusion to build up in my lung. Since starting on Taxol last November I have not had the need to have my lung drained of effusion (thoracentisis). As a comparison_ between my diagnosis in June 2011 and my last thoracentisis in Nov 2011_ a total of 11.3 liters of fluid at 7 different times were removed from my left lobe.",M,66,26  weeks180 MG 1X W,5/17/2012Email,Taxol
15, 3, Adv Metastatic BC stage 3C grade 3,I was treated in May 2006 first with A/C and after no affect 6 weekly doses of TAXOL. I had lost my hair from A/C treatments but after taxol I lost ALL my body hair. The neuropathy began my second treatment which was done while I had shingles. I know I am alive today because of this drug but I hate that for so long Doctors have not taken the long term effects of Chemo drugs especially taxol seriously. After almost 6 years I continue to walk like an 80 year old. My fatigue is severe_ I have constant bone pain in both my lower legs_ numbness_ burning_ aching_ and shooting pains in my feet and hands. I am a single mom_ a middle school teacher_ and I haven't been able to work a full year since treatment. I have to take pain medications to work and it is depressing not to be the active strong person I was before treatment. I am thankful to be alive_ yes_ but please give us the information_ care_ and belief following treatment as well. I want to live happy not be in horrible psn and a burden to my kids.

17, 3, Breast cancer Stage 3A,I was just diagnosed last year MAY 2010. I can admit I am still alive but living in a body that feels like I am 90. I wake with such horrific pain I have to take my Morphine 30 mg instant release and 60 mg slow release. It takes about 1 hour to feel well enough to get out of bed_ just to go to the couch_ I can hardly stand for 5 minutes_ I cannot climb stairs well_ use handicapped parking areas to avoid walking so far_ my legs feel like they are on fire. They pinch_ burn_ throb_ ache_ with pulsating pain and sometimes shooting pains. I can have a massage but as soon as I am finished they hurt equally to when it started. I have found a scalding hot bath helps until my morphine kicks in and takes the edge off enough to sleep. Since the taxol I have become an insomniac. I dont sleep well or at all with out the help of 2 sleeping aids. My arms up to my arm pits ache when things get really bad. Also I believe A/C first contributed for my hair loss but I am sure taxol didnt help because abou,"I too wish I would have known about these side effects. I noticed the extreme ""I cant take it"" kind of pain right after my 2nd dose of taxol_ Where as A/C just made me feel like I had been hit by a bus and I was nautious the entire time. Those symptoms started the 2nd day after treatment and lasted until about day 10. Things were the very worse at about day 5 through 9. My quality of life is ruined. I used to work managing large hotels and was used to running around the building to manage things. I excercised regularly and lifted weights. I loved rollerblading and biking. My feet go numb after an hour of wearing shoes.I cannot keep up with my 3 year old. I am unable to work_ not even able to depend on myself to wake up in time_ since I dont sleep well_ All I can say is without the morphine I am on_ I would rather die than feel the extream intense pain I have when it isnt in my system. I have tried to go off of it many times but the pain is so horrific. I am looking for someone else like me_ in my situation. I have tried ketamine infusions which they said will reset my nerve path but even that_ which was helpful_ did not work. HELP!!!",F,31,2  months 2X M,12/13/2011Email,Taxol

Rash and swelling on both ankles_ muscles hurt during exercise_ accumulative effect fatigue.,After A/C -four 3 weekly sessions- Taxol is not so bad.

I didn't think it would ever go away but happy to say there is light at the end of the tunnel! Still occurs once in awhile after a long day at work or exercise.

26, 4, breast ca,,Interesting comment about the Claritan as I take that daily for seasonal allergies_ and living in FL we have been in high pollen for weeks.  I just finished Taxol last week and did well; common symtpoms were fairly mild and manageable.  For the person needing advice re: nail fungus...try Tea Tree oil daily to the affected nails.  This was recommended to me by a podiatrist for common nail fungus (another prevalent condition in this warm_ humid climate). Tea Tree oil has a pleasant_ medicinal smell and the oil base probably helps nail growth also.  I find the oil I get at a reputable health food store to be a much better quality than the cheaper brands tried from big chain stores...hope it works for you.,F,54,12  weeks 1X W,3/18/2011,Taxol

28, 2, Stage 2 - Triple Neg -Breast Cancer,Peripheral Neuropathy set in following the first Taxol treatment_ hands first then feet.  I lost all skin on my hands_ numb at the tips_ sharp electric shock feeling when I touch things.  Side affects got worse following each treatment. Lost toe nails after second treatment and big toes hurt_ finger nails are now purple and they say the finger nails will probably fall off too.  The pain is intolerable at times_ especially at night.  After a few weeks it has gotten a little easier to walk_ hands are arthritic feeling_ ankles hurt - I just hurt all over and I feel 90 years old instead of my usual active and happy self.  Not sure if it was worth it yet as I had chemo first_ with surgery to follow.  I cherish my quality of life over length and this is far more severe side affects than I was told to expect with only 4 treatments.  They gave me pain meds the first few weeks_ but now suggest the symptoms should be subsiding and I should use natural remedies and buck up and it will go away in,Chemo is poison for some and medicine for others and doctors are not sure how anyone will react for sure.  More research is needed to find a cure_ but in the meantime more emphasis should be spent on treating the side effects and not just the cancer.  Side affects are real and most often pushed off onto the aides and nurses to treat and unless you get a really qualified nurse_ this can be emotionally and physically very difficult.,F,51,7  days 2X M,2/20/2011,Taxol

Of course I have fatigue_ complete hair loss_ eyebrows and eyelash loss_ weight loss of 40 lbs because everything tastes horrible_ and sometimes I just get sick and tired of being sick and tired! I was told by one of my chemo nurses to take Claritin after chemo and IT WORKED really well! I have very strong pain medicine that doesn't even work_ but the Claritin (just one pill) helps with the pain. I also take 3_0000 mg of L-Carnitine - 1_0000 mg 3X a day and have not experienced any tingling or numbness...yet anyway. I hope this helps someone feel better. I still have five more treatments to go.,"I am a middle school teacher and could not work at all with A/C chemo treatments - 4 rounds after a double masectomy and 38 lymph nodes removed. I went back to work 3 days a week on Taxol. I am tired and in a bit of pain_ but I'm praying to be cured and cancer free after all this. I also have 33 radiation treatments to look forward to.

39, 3, Stage 2b Breast Cancer,Four A/C treatments with minimal side effects (fatigue & hair loss). Thought Taxol would be a breeze but I was wrong. The bone & muscle pain (mostly from the waist down)started 3 days after my first Taxol treatment and was so severe I took Darvocet that was leftover from my surgery. Pain lasted 5-6 days. Second Taxol the pain started 2 days after and lasted 9 days. Third Taxol the pain started the next day and lasted the full 2 weeks until my last Taxol which was 2-1/2 weeks ago. Pain is still incredibly intense. Initially the pain was more in my hips_ legs and feet.  Now it's also in my shoulders_ arms & hands. I also have neuropathy and darkened nail beds but I can deal with that.,I had 4 A/C treatments with very little side effects. The Taxol has definitely been much harsher on my body. I have a very high pain tolerance and the bone and muscle pain is about a 9. I've been on Vicodin since the 2nd Taxol and have had to increase the dosage with each treatment. The pain came on earlier and lasted longer with each Taxol treatment. I called my oncologist 2 weeks after my final Taxol and he increased my Vicodin dosage and also prescribed a muscle relaxer. Not sure how long this will last but I'm hoping it won't be much longer. I had the option to go with the 12x weekly Taxol dosage but thought since the A/C was so easy that I'd do the 4x every other week.

I have tingling in my ankles at times of shooting pain.  In the morning I my hands are curled up and in  pain.,I have not returned to work because my balance is so poor.  The quality of my life has diminished.  At 53 years of age I feel 90 years old.  I have tried Lyrica _ gabapatene_ and amitriplyne as well as Vitamin B and glutamine.  None have been able to relieve the pain and often have left me in a bit of a mental fog.   I have always been physically active and have tried to continue to exercise by riding my stationary bicycle_ walking_( with the worst gait possible)yoga_ weight lifting  rehab pilates on a reformer and just started dragon boat racing.  Any exercise you can do sitting down . I have tried to golf 9 holes riding a cart however my ankles are so painful afterwards I con't know if it is worth it.   My typing accuracy is dreadful since I can't feel the keys.  Taxol might have saved my life from a recurrence of cancer but it also stole the quality of my life and livelihood.  All I have been told is that it might get better over time.  One can only hope.    I have just recently been seen by a neurologist.  When I told my oncologist after the first round of taxol that it was the worst pain I had ever experienced that he joking said that I had never experienced labor as if that would be more pain than I was experiening . I told HIM_ HE never experienced labor either and not that type of pain now for 8 months....I have tried everything I can do from drugs_ diet_ exercise_ mediation etc...however I have no control when or if the periperal neuropathy and my mobility will,F,53,4  times 4X O,5/20/2010,Taxol
42, 4, Triple Negative Breast Cancer,Some fatigue on days 3-5 post treatment.  Some joint pain in shoulders.  My hair thinned out significantly_ although I didn't lose it completely.  I ended up shaving it off anyway since my insurance paid for a wig.  I just had my 9th treatment (3 more to go) and I have been getting headaches now for the past couple of weeks.  Today's was the worst yet.  Hoping they subside soon.,I haven't had any major issues with Taxol.  My chemo experience thus far has been better than I anticipated.  I begin FEC in 3 weeks and I'm hoping it goes as smoothly as the Taxol has gone.,F,35,12  weeks 1X W,4/15/2010,Taxol
43, 2, Triple negative breast cancer,Numbness/loss of sensation in fingers and toes; no sense of taste_ so food seems disgusting; awful_ bitter coating in throat; 3 days after treatment bone/muscle pain starts and lasts for 4-5 days. Worst in the hips_ lower back_ and knees_ but also shoulder bone and ankles. I hobble around like a 90-year-old_ just as many of the comments above mention!,Did 4 rounds of A/C followed by 4 rounds of Taxol--the last round is later this week. My onc said that since I tolerated dose-dense A/C so well_ Taxol would be a breeze. Well_ it's different from A/C but I wouldn't call it a breeze. I sure hope that this was worthwhile_ but I guess that only time can tell.,F,49,2  months 2X M,3/15/2010Email,Taxol
44, 4, Stage IIIa BC_ one side mastectomy,Painful brittle_ yellow nails; mild neuropathy in fingers_ tired,I took 12 weekly Taxol Tx after AC for 2 months every 2 weeks. Taxol was so much easier! Dexamethasone was giving me trouble (water retention and weight gain of ~12lb by the end of tx). I am now 1 month after tx and feeling really well. I was exercising throughout my treatment_ walking 4-9 miles almost every day_ swimming several times a week and working almost full time. I even went skiing in the Rockies while on Taxol! I believe that good physical condition before dx and continuous exercise during tx helped me to go through this difficult time. It was not exactly a walk in the park but close enough. I started radiation now_ Arimidex and Clodronate and still run.,F,59,12  weeks 1X W,3/13/2010Email,Taxol
45, 5, BC Stage3A,Hair loss_ nausea_ neutropenia and anaemia.,I continued working (office)_ but had to quit the gym_ which I resumed 3 months after the last chemo and surgery. I had a giant tumor_ which after Taxol reduced to 10.5 cm but had free margins. I'm currently finishing my rads and taking Armidex. Apart from the anaemia and neutropenia_ which required some extra care the treatment went smoothly. 3 months after I still have a bit of neutropenia but my quality of life is OK_ besides the doctor says I'm cancer free!,F,48,6  months 1X O,2/5/2010Email,Taxol
46, 4, BC Triple Neg Stage 1 (1.8cm),Numbness in fingers and feet.  Joint pain in shoulders.,My treatments consisted of a lumpectomy_ 4 rounds of Adriamycin/Cytoxan_ 4 rounds of Taxol_ and 33 radiation treatments.  I experienced joint pain and numbness in feet/hands from the Taxol.  Did chemo from April through July of 2008.  Still experiencing shoulder pain and some numbness in my feet.  Drinking Kangen Water (electrolyzed water) helped to keep me hydrated throughout treatments.  Also - never threw up during chemo.  This redhead barely got pink during radiation.  I love my Kangen Water and feel it helped tremendously during my treatments.,F,45,4  weeks,1/22/2010Email,Taxol
47, 4, BC Stage 2A,,04/16/09 was my last Taxol treatment.  I am still experiencing joint pain_ muscle weakness BUT_ it is much better now than before.  The joint pain/stiffness is worse of a morning.  Once I take a shower_ the warm water seems to allow me to be more moble.  I haven't gained weight_ actually I've lost more since treatments.  I also took 33 treatments of Radiation after Taxol.I would like some feed back from other BC survivors who was dx with triple negative BC.  My appetite is back to normal_ I just get full quick_ also experience alot of loose stools. I also notice problems with my memory. Not too back_ but it's there.,F,53,12  weeks,11/17/2009,Taxol
48, 5, Stage IIA Breast Cancer,After 4 treatments of AC_ Taxol although isn't a walk in the park is easier.  Side effects include bone aches days 3 - 5 usually starting in the afternoon.  Fatigue.  Bowel problems.  Mucous in stool and stomach pain.  No nausea.  Nose bleeds.  New side effect - rash on hands.  Lost my hair during AC and seem to be losing more with the Taxol.,Currently on 8th cycle of a 12 week low dose Taxol.  Looking forward to having some energy again.,F,51,12  weeks,10/26/2009,Taxol
49, 5, Stage I Breast Cancer,Some fatigue_ short-term memory loss (but not enough to affect my work)_ very upset stomach for three days following treatment_ diarrhea/constipation and loss of menstrual cycle.  NO mouth sores_ joint pain_ nail problems_ neuropathy_ or total hair loss (just some thinning of my hair_ but not my facial or bodily hair).,I was prepared for the worst_ but found Taxol to not be as bad as I thought it would be. I just finished my last dose on August 13th.  I participated in a clinical trial where I received Taxol weekly for 12 weeks.  I think the data is showing that a lower dose administered weekly is easier on patients.  At least is was for me.  I was able to work every day but the day I got the Taxol.  The worst symptom for me was my stomach/bowels. I didn't lose my hair.  It continues to fall out_ now 3 weeks post Taxol_ but I never lost enough that I had to wear a wig.  I did_ however_ have to have high does of Decadron because I had a severe reaction to my first infusion. After that (which wasn't fun)_ it was faily unremarkable.  I have three children under the age of 4 and was able to care for them without them ever knowing I was sick.  So_ I recommend Taxol_ and definitely given weekly over 12 weeks.  Hope this helps :-),F,37,12  weeks,9/6/2009Email,Taxol
50, 5, Breast Cancer Stage IIIB,Neuropathy in hands and feet; rash on my face_ progressive memory problems/light headedness; weight loss/loss of appetite; loss of hair on entire body,I am sure this is what helped me to have complete response; more and more research is showing weekly dose is the way to go; I did it because of side affects I had with AC; I still have back pain and numbness 3 months later but I show no cancer on my scans and path report,F,53,12  weeks,8/29/2009Email,Taxol
51, 4, AC for stage 3c BC_ reduce tumors,Fatigue_ incontinence_ more hair loss_ low BP_ not too bad. Intermittant bone discomfort_,AC reduced BC stage IIIc from 4 cm to 1 1/2 cm. Still not small enough for surgery. Will be 11 more weekly infusions as I seem to respond well to chemo. Am getting benedryl to reduce side effects. I can tough it out! AC was bad_ yet I survived that. Am taking probiotics_ antioxidents_ calorie counting_ metamucil_ etc. Keep the body alkaline and healthy so the chemo can do its job. Nausea was associated with low blood sugar. Don't listen to horror stories_ a positive attitude makes an alkaline body. I know its going to get worse but I have faith in my oncologist. She'll get me through it.,F,73,5  days,8/21/2009,Taxol

But I have SUFFERED incredible pain since then. Every hair on my body was lost during treatment but came back.That was nothing compared to this last 16 yrs. I would take it again because it helped save my life. I have memory loss and difficulty concentrating. Just something else to work on. LOL.,"Thanks to my Dr for putting me on anti-depressants. That in itself helped so much. Knowing that I am mind_ spirit and body I went to work on all three. I ""raged against the dying of the light""_ that ol' cancer. I suffer daily but would have missed so very much. Peripheral neuropathy and shortly after I completed the Taxol and Cysplatin I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.Some folks think I'm lying about having Ovarian C.especially metastasis but I have the papers to prove it. First I had to decide whether I REALLY wanted to live. Then I started kicking butt My story is too long to tell now but I'm still amazed that the bark of the Yew tree helped save my life. After 3 rounds we did another CT scan and the mass of 3 tumors in my pelvic area the size of grapefruit were gone. Still had many small tumors ""lining the wall of my abdominal region."" They had to put me in intensive care to administer it every 21 days because it was so strong. I was diagnosed June 1_ 1993. I'm still here.The staph in my port. almost took me out!

55, 5, breast cancer,fatigue,I am on weekly taxol for twelve weeks_ just finished my fourth.  So far my only side effects are some fatigue after the decadron steroid wears off_ and a little stomach acid so I avoid spicy foods.  No hair loss yet_ although I'm expecting it.  No neuropathy or joint pain as others have described.  No other side effects. I was on AC for four cycles before and it was horrible.  Compared to that_ this is a walk in the park!,F,48,12  weeks,6/19/2009,Taxol

57, 1, Breast Cancer,I had a stage 2b breast cancer. Taxol resulted in an 8cm abscess in my lung.  I had anemia.  It was discussed on my second treatment if I should have a blood transfusion_ and not have the second treatment at that time.  I was given an injection of medication that was supposed to increase my red blood cells_ and then given a taxol treatment directly after given the. I believe that  this treatment resulted in the lung infection_ for I had a low grade fever for several days following this treatment.  Despite_ complaints about feeling ill_ treatments continued.  Throughout the treatments I was developing pain in my feet and hands. I was told to take large quantities of vitamin B_ which I tried. I developed peripheral neuropathy that continues  to the present_ 5 years after treatment ended.  In fact_ over time it got worse until finally I couldn't walk. I was told it wouldn't last but tests show I have no reflexes from my knees down.  I finally was given neurontin_ by a physiatrist_ which w,"I think if I had a stage 4 breast cancer_ I wouldn't be as angry about the resultant deterioration in my quality of life_ and would have seen it as it as saving my life (many people have said ""well it saved your life"").  I know there were other ways to go_ with regard to chemotherapy_ which I only found out after the fact. I don't believe it was necessary for the stage of cancer I had_ but would definitely not have felt that with a stage 4 cancer. I checked off dissatisfied but that was with regard to having a stage 2b breast cancer. I do understand that not everyone has these side effects_ but for whatever reason I do_ and thus the anger and frustration.",F,62,2  months,6/6/2009Email,Taxol
58, 4, Metastatic Breast Cancer,Severe itching sometimes_ fingertips norm_ fatigue_ depression_ digestion problem_ severe gum sores and teeth sensitivity-can't chew my food and have to eat soups. I wish chemo drugs would target only the cancer cells and leave the normal immune cells alone. I can't believe with all the technology out there_ the research and drug companies can tell the difference between cancer and non cancer cells and still can't treat only the cancer cells.,I don't know what the deal is_ but there's got to be a better way. This is just too much sufferings from side effects and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. I have been told I have to be be on chemo for ever but I still hope not_ and hope for the day they will announce a chemo that targets cancer cells and short on side effects.

59, 4, metaticized melanoma,Fatigue and tingling in the hands and feet,"I am sure that taxol saved my life_ but not alone.  First I have a very intense astanga yoga practice helping to keep the numbess at bay and keeping my mind focused both inward and outward because of the asanas_ breathing and inward focus.  Second_ I have a husband who is determined to keep me alive_ and groown loving children.  Third I team-teach in a high school theater arts program.  Every day the kids inspire me to work and forget about myself.  I also have friends who understand and love me.  Taxol is a challenege and I wish I were not taking it.  Yet I am vitally alive even on the many moments when I bemoan my ""FATE.""  The other day I saw a ten-year-old boy using a walker to get to his seat with family at a restaurant.  He had a sparkling Cheshire-cat grin with no attached cyniscm.  I can stand on my hands and do a drop backbend_ thanks to a wonderful and patient teacher.
