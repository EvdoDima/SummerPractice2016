This is a blow by blow but overall let me say that on a scale of 1-10 (10 being awful)_ even on the worst days I would give it a 4.  I never missed a day of work_ though I did go to bed earlier and sometimes slept in.  At week 14 I did a fast_ 1 week turn around trip to Africa_ and though tired_ actually felt mostly OK.Week 1: No side effectsWeek 2: mouth sores for about 3 days_ the first day it felt like a burned my mouth (like after you eat a hot piece of pizza)  The third was somewhat sore_ like having a bunch of cold sores.  Then it just went away on its own Only came back for a couple of other days around week 5. Also low white blood cell count (3) from a starting point of 14.  They give me neupogen the day before next session (Week 3).  It works (WBC 27) but really makes me feel achy in my bones for a day.  Insurance will not cover_ so they switch me to granix.  Went for a 3 day 35mile backpacking trip aft,Diagnosed at 48.  Triple positive so had weekly taxol for 12 weeks starting 5 weeks post surgery to remove lump.  Also taking Herceptin which I started first. Side effects worse than Herceptin alsone_ but overall quite manageable.

Started with dose dense A/C for four treatments every other Tuesday and ended with dose dense Taxol_ four treatments every other Tuesday for a total of 16 weeks of chemotherapy.

Side effects not suffered include nausea_ intestinal problem_ heart or kidney problems.,"I have had 20 injections (each lasting 2 hours) of Taxol in the last 26 weeks. I take 3 weeks in a row_ skip a week_ and then start another 3 weeks of injections. Currently I will be skipping 3 weeks (impending cataract surgery) and resuming weekly injections on June 13th. I have found that this skipping allows my body time to rebuild and not leave me completely drained and weak..The day of and the day after chemo are my coming down from the steroids days. Days 3 and 4 after chemo are generally my ""don't do anything"" and rest days. Days 5 and 6 are my ""normal"" and productive days. The latest CT scan shows that Taxol has reduced the cancer mass in my lung to one-third the size it was before Taxol. Prior to Taxol I was on Carboplatin every 3 weeks_ however this chemo still allowed for the effusion to build up in my lung. Since starting on Taxol last November I have not had the need to have my lung drained of effusion (thoracentisis). As a comparison_ between my diagnosis in June 2011 and my last thoracentisis in Nov 2011_ a total of 11.3 liters of fluid at 7 different times were removed from my left lobe.",M,66,26  weeks180 MG 1X W,5/17/2012Email,Taxol
15, 3, Adv Metastatic BC stage 3C grade 3,I was treated in May 2006 first with A/C and after no affect 6 weekly doses of TAXOL. I had lost my hair from A/C treatments but after taxol I lost ALL my body hair. The neuropathy began my second treatment which was done while I had shingles. I know I am alive today because of this drug but I hate that for so long Doctors have not taken the long term effects of Chemo drugs especially taxol seriously. After almost 6 years I continue to walk like an 80 year old. My fatigue is severe_ I have constant bone pain in both my lower legs_ numbness_ burning_ aching_ and shooting pains in my feet and hands. I am a single mom_ a middle school teacher_ and I haven't been able to work a full year since treatment. I have to take pain medications to work and it is depressing not to be the active strong person I was before treatment. I am thankful to be alive_ yes_ but please give us the information_ care_ and belief following treatment as well. I want to live happy not be in horrible psn and a burden to my kids.

17, 3, Breast cancer Stage 3A,I was just diagnosed last year MAY 2010. I can admit I am still alive but living in a body that feels like I am 90. I wake with such horrific pain I have to take my Morphine 30 mg instant release and 60 mg slow release. It takes about 1 hour to feel well enough to get out of bed_ just to go to the couch_ I can hardly stand for 5 minutes_ I cannot climb stairs well_ use handicapped parking areas to avoid walking so far_ my legs feel like they are on fire. They pinch_ burn_ throb_ ache_ with pulsating pain and sometimes shooting pains. I can have a massage but as soon as I am finished they hurt equally to when it started. I have found a scalding hot bath helps until my morphine kicks in and takes the edge off enough to sleep. Since the taxol I have become an insomniac. I dont sleep well or at all with out the help of 2 sleeping aids. My arms up to my arm pits ache when things get really bad. Also I believe A/C first contributed for my hair loss but I am sure taxol didnt help because abou,"I too wish I would have known about these side effects. I noticed the extreme ""I cant take it"" kind of pain right after my 2nd dose of taxol_ Where as A/C just made me feel like I had been hit by a bus and I was nautious the entire time. Those symptoms started the 2nd day after treatment and lasted until about day 10. Things were the very worse at about day 5 through 9. My quality of life is ruined. I used to work managing large hotels and was used to running around the building to manage things. I excercised regularly and lifted weights. I loved rollerblading and biking. My feet go numb after an hour of wearing shoes.I cannot keep up with my 3 year old. I am unable to work_ not even able to depend on myself to wake up in time_ since I dont sleep well_ All I can say is without the morphine I am on_ I would rather die than feel the extream intense pain I have when it isnt in my system. I have tried to go off of it many times but the pain is so horrific. I am looking for someone else like me_ in my situation. I have tried ketamine infusions which they said will reset my nerve path but even that_ which was helpful_ did not work. HELP!!!",F,31,2  months 2X M,12/13/2011Email,Taxol

Rash and swelling on both ankles_ muscles hurt during exercise_ accumulative effect fatigue.,After A/C -four 3 weekly sessions- Taxol is not so bad.

I didn't think it would ever go away but happy to say there is light at the end of the tunnel! Still occurs once in awhile after a long day at work or exercise.

26, 4, breast ca,,Interesting comment about the Claritan as I take that daily for seasonal allergies_ and living in FL we have been in high pollen for weeks.  I just finished Taxol last week and did well; common symtpoms were fairly mild and manageable.  For the person needing advice re: nail fungus...try Tea Tree oil daily to the affected nails.  This was recommended to me by a podiatrist for common nail fungus (another prevalent condition in this warm_ humid climate). Tea Tree oil has a pleasant_ medicinal smell and the oil base probably helps nail growth also.  I find the oil I get at a reputable health food store to be a much better quality than the cheaper brands tried from big chain stores...hope it works for you.,F,54,12  weeks 1X W,3/18/2011,Taxol

28, 2, Stage 2 - Triple Neg -Breast Cancer,Peripheral Neuropathy set in following the first Taxol treatment_ hands first then feet.  I lost all skin on my hands_ numb at the tips_ sharp electric shock feeling when I touch things.  Side affects got worse following each treatment. Lost toe nails after second treatment and big toes hurt_ finger nails are now purple and they say the finger nails will probably fall off too.  The pain is intolerable at times_ especially at night.  After a few weeks it has gotten a little easier to walk_ hands are arthritic feeling_ ankles hurt - I just hurt all over and I feel 90 years old instead of my usual active and happy self.  Not sure if it was worth it yet as I had chemo first_ with surgery to follow.  I cherish my quality of life over length and this is far more severe side affects than I was told to expect with only 4 treatments.  They gave me pain meds the first few weeks_ but now suggest the symptoms should be subsiding and I should use natural remedies and buck up and it will go away in,Chemo is poison for some and medicine for others and doctors are not sure how anyone will react for sure.  More research is needed to find a cure_ but in the meantime more emphasis should be spent on treating the side effects and not just the cancer.  Side affects are real and most often pushed off onto the aides and nurses to treat and unless you get a really qualified nurse_ this can be emotionally and physically very difficult.,F,51,7  days 2X M,2/20/2011,Taxol

Of course I have fatigue_ complete hair loss_ eyebrows and eyelash loss_ weight loss of 40 lbs because everything tastes horrible_ and sometimes I just get sick and tired of being sick and tired! I was told by one of my chemo nurses to take Claritin after chemo and IT WORKED really well! I have very strong pain medicine that doesn't even work_ but the Claritin (just one pill) helps with the pain. I also take 3_0000 mg of L-Carnitine - 1_0000 mg 3X a day and have not experienced any tingling or numbness...yet anyway. I hope this helps someone feel better. I still have five more treatments to go.,"I am a middle school teacher and could not work at all with A/C chemo treatments - 4 rounds after a double masectomy and 38 lymph nodes removed. I went back to work 3 days a week on Taxol. I am tired and in a bit of pain_ but I'm praying to be cured and cancer free after all this. I also have 33 radiation treatments to look forward to.

39, 3, Stage 2b Breast Cancer,Four A/C treatments with minimal side effects (fatigue & hair loss). Thought Taxol would be a breeze but I was wrong. The bone & muscle pain (mostly from the waist down)started 3 days after my first Taxol treatment and was so severe I took Darvocet that was leftover from my surgery. Pain lasted 5-6 days. Second Taxol the pain started 2 days after and lasted 9 days. Third Taxol the pain started the next day and lasted the full 2 weeks until my last Taxol which was 2-1/2 weeks ago. Pain is still incredibly intense. Initially the pain was more in my hips_ legs and feet.  Now it's also in my shoulders_ arms & hands. I also have neuropathy and darkened nail beds but I can deal with that.,I had 4 A/C treatments with very little side effects. The Taxol has definitely been much harsher on my body. I have a very high pain tolerance and the bone and muscle pain is about a 9. I've been on Vicodin since the 2nd Taxol and have had to increase the dosage with each treatment. The pain came on earlier and lasted longer with each Taxol treatment. I called my oncologist 2 weeks after my final Taxol and he increased my Vicodin dosage and also prescribed a muscle relaxer. Not sure how long this will last but I'm hoping it won't be much longer. I had the option to go with the 12x weekly Taxol dosage but thought since the A/C was so easy that I'd do the 4x every other week.

I have tingling in my ankles at times of shooting pain.  In the morning I my hands are curled up and in  pain.,I have not returned to work because my balance is so poor.  The quality of my life has diminished.  At 53 years of age I feel 90 years old.  I have tried Lyrica _ gabapatene_ and amitriplyne as well as Vitamin B and glutamine.  None have been able to relieve the pain and often have left me in a bit of a mental fog.   I have always been physically active and have tried to continue to exercise by riding my stationary bicycle_ walking_( with the worst gait possible)yoga_ weight lifting  rehab pilates on a reformer and just started dragon boat racing.  Any exercise you can do sitting down . I have tried to golf 9 holes riding a cart however my ankles are so painful afterwards I con't know if it is worth it.   My typing accuracy is dreadful since I can't feel the keys.  Taxol might have saved my life from a recurrence of cancer but it also stole the quality of my life and livelihood.  All I have been told is that it might get better over time.  One can only hope.    I have just recently been seen by a neurologist.  When I told my oncologist after the first round of taxol that it was the worst pain I had ever experienced that he joking said that I had never experienced labor as if that would be more pain than I was experiening . I told HIM_ HE never experienced labor either and not that type of pain now for 8 months....I have tried everything I can do from drugs_ diet_ exercise_ mediation etc...however I have no control when or if the periperal neuropathy and my mobility will,F,53,4  times 4X O,5/20/2010,Taxol

Dexamethasone was giving me trouble (water retention and weight gain of ~12lb by the end of tx). I am now 1 month after tx and feeling really well. I was exercising throughout my treatment_ walking 4-9 miles almost every day_ swimming several times a week and working almost full time. I even went skiing in the Rockies while on Taxol! I believe that good physical condition before dx and continuous exercise during tx helped me to go through this difficult time. It was not exactly a walk in the park but close enough.

NO mouth sores_ joint pain_ nail problems_ neuropathy_ or total hair loss (just some thinning of my hair_ but not my facial or bodily hair).,I was prepared for the worst_ but found Taxol to not be as bad as I thought it would be. I just finished my last dose on August 13th.  I participated in a clinical trial where I received Taxol weekly for 12 weeks.  I think the data is showing that a lower dose administered weekly is easier on patients.  At least is was for me.  I was able to work every day but the day I got the Taxol.  The worst symptom for me was my stomach/bowels. I didn't lose my hair.  It continues to fall out_ now 3 weeks post Taxol_ but I never lost enough that I had to wear a wig.  I did_ however_ have to have high does of Decadron because I had a severe reaction to my first infusion. After that (which wasn't fun)_ it was faily unremarkable.  I have three children under the age of 4 and was able to care for them without them ever knowing I was sick.  So_ I recommend Taxol_ and definitely given weekly over 12 weeks.

I see 90yr olds who walk better than I do. My worse fear is that it is only going to get worse as I age_ will try any medication to alleviate pain_ Lyrica didn't help.,F,40,6  days,12/22/2007,Taxol
77, 2, BC,Pain entire body_ unable to think or concentrate_ tingling and pain in feet and fingers_leg and feet cramps_ weakness and pain in hips_ unable to walk very far_ off balance and need help to go up and down stairs. Toenails and fingernails separating from nailbeds and shriveling up to small unsightly nails. I finished taxol in June 2007_ it is now December 1_2007. I still have all these symptoms plus my back has broken 3 times this summer due to chemotherapy and osteoporosis. I now have added pain and am very limited in what I can do.,I don't know if I could recommend this drug or not_ I have not been told whether it has helped me. I am in physically worse shape than I have ever been and was always a very active person. The only thing I know to do is wait and hope it gets better. But (am having trouble thinking of the word) yes_ depression is always there.,F,59,3  months,12/1/2007,Taxol
78, 5, 2nd bout with cancer,Dizziness_ bowel disruption_ tingling in extremities_ muscle aches_incontinence_malaise.loss of body hair_ metallic taste. horrific side effects,This chemo was worse than the first time.  I was unable to function for 5 days after sessions. But_ although I said I could not handle another dosage_ the reality is that I am alive. Three months after the last dosages_ feet and hands still ache.  I fell and fractured some ribs during a dizzy spell_so am still using a cane.  But I am alive and am enjoying life.  My hair has begun to grow again.,F,72,6  times,11/24/2007Email,Taxol
79, 2, Breast cancer recurrence,3 days after treatment felt like I was hit by a bus.  Could not stand up_ severe leg  and foot pain made it impossible to stand.  About 1 week after each treatment_ I started to feel fine again.,Its been 2 months since last Taxol treatment and I feel like my legs are crippled from the knees down.  If I sit for longer than 10 minutes I have so much pain I can hardly stand.  Also leg pain when on my feet.  I am only 49 years old and I feel like I am 80.  I was always extremely active.  Hope this does not last forever.,F,49,4  days,11/13/2007Email,Taxol
80, 2, treatment for breast cancer,"I had two bouts of breast cancer_ early 2004 and late 2005_ different kinds each time_ so I got the double whammy with chemo less than two years between sessions. The second time I got Taxol. I had terrible leg pain (hips_ knees_ feet_ shins_ heels) and shoulder pain. Only people who have been through this know what I mean by ""leg pain."" It sounds so petty. This got worse and worse even after the treatment ended until I was walking with a cane_ couldn't go up and down stairs_ and was afraid to step off a curb. Further tests showed severe and rapid deterioration of the left hip joint and left shoulder joint. I'm only 57 and had to have my left hip replaced in April 2007 and my shoulder joint replacement is scheduled for Dec. 2007. Both the arthritis specialist and the bone specialist say they have never seen such rapid deterioration_ especially of the shoulder_ for any naturally occuring reason and they suspect it's from the chemotherapy_ probably the Taxol. I will say_ the hi",As far as being satisfied that Taxol helped me_ it's something we'll probably never know. So looking back I probably would have taken it anyway; better to be alive to complain. But the side effects were very severe in my case.,F,57,3  days,11/2/2007Email,Taxol
81, 3, Breast CA,Felt like a train wreck  about 3 days  after my first dose. I had done 4 doses of A/C and had started back as hospital nurse after the A/C. Thought the chemo was a piece of cake. thank God for Emend.,I have terrible joint and achy pain that I never had before since the chemo.  I guess  you should say shut up since your'e still alive--Some days it aches so much I wonder. Back working full time,F,53,8  weeks,9/20/2007Email,Taxol

Lost any and all remaining hair (eyebrows_ eyelashes_ nose_ arms_ etc.) But worth it to save my life.,Had four rounds of A/C and four rounds of Taxol.  Finished last taxol treatment two weeks ago; tingling hasn't gotten worse but it hasn't gotten better either.  I walk everyday which helps immensely.

86, 1, Breast Cancer,Taxol was horrific.  This was my second primary breast cancer so I couldn't use Adriamycin again.  From the very first treatment I could barely walk.  Began treatment in May 06 and finished in August.  I thought my symptoms would get better when I finished_ but it only got worse.  I have always been active and now have to struggle to walk or even move on some days.  I am 43 and I walk like my grandmother. Feet_ hips_ shoulders and hands hurt terribly.,,F,43,4  months,4/2/2007,Taxol
87, 3, breast cancer,Mostly just a little tired the day of and after taking taxol. Very little nausea. At the end of the treatments however_ I experienced severe leg cramps_ and neuropathy in hands and feet.,2 months later and still walking like Im eighty---always had strong legs and knees before---hope I get that back.,F,45,3  months,3/21/2007,Taxol
88, 5, Metastatic breast cancer,Fatigue was the only important one; one day mostly in bed for each weekly cycle.  My hair fell out_ but who cares?  None of the nausea/vomiting I've experienced with other chemo drugs.  No peripheral neuropathy.  Only very mild and occasional joint pain.,I had 16 weekly doses of Taxol over about 6 months; 3 weeks on 1 week off with a long break over Christmas due to going on holiday rather than medical considerations.  Having weekly doses seems to reduce the side-effects without reducing the efficacy (there is scientific evidence for this_ not just my opinion).  It was palliative in intent_ and it has worked ie my various tumours have shrunk in size.,F,44,6  months,3/12/2007,Taxol
89, 4, ovarian,the main side effects I have had is being somewhat tired and weak feeling_ food tastes and dehydration the first few days after treatment.,I received 8 cycles in 2005 and now am near the end of 6 cycles. I have experienced no neuropathy during or after either of these cycles.  And taxol has decreased my CA125 down to normal each time.  My doctors are amazed at how well my body is handling treatments.  Frankly_ I am too.,F,44,4  months,2/27/2007Email,Taxol
90, 5, breast cancer,Side effects of Taxol were more severe than those experienced from Adriamycin/Cytoxin.  With Taxol_ slight numbness in fingertips and slight detachment of fingernails.  Fatigue.  Took glutamine and high-dose vitamin B6 to minimize side effects.  Had GREAT result with first four A/C treatments.  Tumor was further diminished by four treatments of Taxol to the point that my last treatment was optional.  Took it anyway.,I started chemotherapy very shortly after diagnosis in order to save my breast.  My doc said neo-adjuvant therapy works in approx. 70% of patients.  Glad I yook my chances! Chemo is no walk in the park_ but it does help save lives (and breasts!),F,52,8  weeks,11/15/2006,Taxol
91, 5, breast cancer,I experienced severe myalgias & neuralgias while on the drug_ plus neuropathy in hands and feet. The neuropathy in my feet is still there to a lesser degree after 5 years.,"I have experienced a loss of cartilage at my great toe and foot joints - something the orthopedic MD says he does not frequently see in ""someone like me.""  It is extremely painful and there is really not much you can do about it_ except surgery to fuse the toe.  I am concerned that the cartilage damage has been caused by the Taxol and that other joints will be affected. Has anyone else experienced this????",F,,8  weeks,11/30/2005Email,Taxol
92, 1, Breast Cancer,I finished chemo six months ago_ and I have had lingering side-effects from Taxol that make me regret having taken it for primary bc. I have very bad pain in all my joints (especially shoulders_ elbows_ knees_ back).  I also have a great deal of muscle pain in my arms and legs. I am 44 years old and I walk like a ninety-year-old. It is very hard for me to get around. My immune system is shot too: I have on-going shingles_ sore throats_ and mouth sores. No one told me my quality of life would diminish so severely.,Question your doctor about future quality of life issues before you begin Taxol.,F,44,4  times,9/25/2005,Taxol
