0, 2, Seronegative RA and fibromyalgia,I had my first infusion 2 days ago. Have had a dull headache and neck pain since infusion. Extremely tired. More severe pain than before medication. Can hardly use my hand due to pain. Cannot touch my arms due to severe pain. I had high expectations of this drug after failing Enbrel_ Orencia and Xeljanz. Now thinking that no drug is going to work for me. It's a daunting feeling. Willing to try another dose of Actemra to see  if it will work.,,F,45,2  days 1X M,6/16/2016,Actemra
1, 3, rheumatoid arthritis,At the beginning_ first few months_ I would have mild headaches_ or runny nose_ but nothing special. The only problem was that I had various infections_ don't know if that could be related with Actemra_ since it happened also prior to taking the med.,It worked for about 6-8 months. Now I have been taking it for 18 months_ and last 5-6 months I feel worse and worse. My rhummy is thinking of switching the med. Hope the next one will work better.,F,39,1  years560,5/2/2016,Actemra

3, 2, RA_ Fibromyalga,Rash_ dry lips that crack and bleed_ fatigue_ bleeding gums when brushing teeth_ I feel worse then with Remicade. Remicade I had several terrible flare-ups. This med is not for me. I've had four treatment and I feel lousy everyday with headaches_ sore hands_ my joints are inflamed all day and I have a terrible time walking because my muscles are soooo sore. Also_ my hair is falling out.,,M,63,1  months2x,4/8/2016,Actemra
4, 1, RA,I began developing consistent headaches and symptoms not improved! Developed HTN after second dose now on meds. My head began hurting day 1 & doesn't let up...haven't had issues with my migraines for quite a while. This drug is a joke!! I want to stop it immediately,,M,39,2  months8 mg,1/31/2016,Actemra

6, 4, Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis,Mild to moderate injection site reaction. Mild to moderate headaches 2-4 days after injection and lasting 2 or 3 days. I was told by an RN to load up on fluids prior to injection day and after; to stay well hydrated and this would help prevent headaches. Am hoping the headaches lessen or subside once my body adjusts to the medication (as was the case with MTX_ in pill form_ which I also take at 20mg/wk) I am also taking Prednisone 7.5mg/day_ a reduction from 10mg/day_ in an effort to wean off of Prednisone. It's possible this reduction might also be causing or contributing to the headaches.,This drug seems to be working. I have noticed a definite lessening of fatigue_ along with less pain and stiffness. Prior to this_ I had failed Arava_ Plaquenil_ Enbrel_ Humira & Orencia (last three all SC injections+with MTX). I had only a mild response to Enbrel & Orencia. I had not much response to Humira_ except for an extreme drop in white cell count and two very severe flares after discontinuing that drug. The Actemra+MTX combo is the first really good response I've gotten since beginning treatment for RA in 12/2009_ so I am very optimistic and hoping for continued improvement.,F,50,6  weeks162mg 1X W,8/1/2015Email,Actemra
7, 5, Rheumatoid arthritis,Tired the day of infusion and after a few months on it I noticed I was losing more hair than usual. Nothing that concerned me though.,Actemra has been my miracle drug.

Problem is no one else seems to have this reaction.I also flared after Enbrel and Humiera_ though not to this degree.All the symptoms of R.A and rated a severe on the Vectra D.A. test_ which ironically showed that Actemra should  have been the right med.Anyone else had these effects from the biologics?,,F,54,3  months8,6/19/2013Email,Actemra

20, 1, RA Fibromyalgia,This drug is POISON!  While taking my first half dose infusion I started to Get a headache. I TOLD the nurse giving the infusion and she said to take a tylenol when I went home and to taken one before my next infusion next month. By the time I got home my head was ready to explode and I was nauseaus. This lasted for days. I then began to break out in an eyelid infection that overtook my eyelid and turned it purple. The side of my eye swelled up. I also broke out in a cold sore on my lower lip. I never have cold sores or eye infections let alone at the same time. My skin turned red like I had a rash in different parts of my neck and arms . When I went to my Rheumatologist for the next infusion I still had the above mentioned symptoms. It was determined that they should go ahead with the second dose which would be a full dose. I again had an immediate headache even though I took the tylenol as prescribed. They pre-treated me with nausea medication and antibiotics. This time beside the headache_ I broke out into a rash that had pustules that would pop. Skin that pealed away_ lips and throat that swelled_ my eye got worse and so did the cold sore. I had seeplesness for two weeks sleeping only two hrs at a time. Now after three weeks from my last infusion I am beginning to sleep again. My eye and lip is still messed up and hurts. I am still breaking out into pustules and am going to see a Dermatologist tomorrow. I am still using the anti anxiety medication they had to give me to,,F,58,2  monthsinfusion,2/26/2013Email,Actemra
