0, 5, Sigmoid colonoscopy,It didn't work for me initially_ not until 3 hours 45 minutes after I started prep.,Only had 3 bowel movements that night_ was able to get some sound sleep_ used the bathroom constantly between the 6-8 next day prep. It's just like expelling water mostly_ inconvienent but doesn't hurt. Tastes like fruit loops that have been left out in the sun in a plastic tub.,F,28,2  days4 liters,8/17/2016,Golytely
1, 5, colonoscopy prep,none; 4 liters consumed @ 8 oz. per ten minutes,All the negative reviews are mostly silly complaints_ not harmful side effects_ Especially the nasty comments about the mfg. The colonoscopy must be done on a perfectly clean bowel_ especially if concurrent with polyp removal. Colon cancer and polyps are very serious! Yes_ it has an aftertaste like plastic. If they could make it taste like beer_ wine_ ice cream or chocolate or French fries_ they would. My Dr. had me take an 8 oz bottle of magnesium citrate (OTC) the night before 4 hours after a lite meal. This was my 4th. prep in 14 years and was the easiest_ considering the effects.

3, 4, Colonoscopy,I have been drinking this going on 4 hours now and only had mild nausea on and off.,I was terrified after reading all the horror stories and reviews on this product before I started drinking it and it really hasn't been nearly as horrifying as I imagined. I had a lemon packet to put in the powder and it's not nearly as horrible tasting as everyone has said. While it's not my drink of choice I have found taking sips of kiwi strawberry propel after gulping a drink down makes it much more tolerable. I have had no adverse side effects from it so far and I am 4 hours into drinking it.. (almost completely done) It took me about an hour and a half to have my first bowel movement and I will say this... don't go far from the bathroom because when you feel the urge to go you really need to get to the toilet quickly.,F,29,1  days4 liters,6/21/2016Email,Golytely
4, 1, Colonoscopy upcoming,Nothing yet after 90 min (not even a need to use the bathroom)_ I just had to comment on the utter disgustingness of the taste.,The manufacturers are horrible human beings.  They really couldn't add a flavor to this to make it not so disgusting???  I can't decide which of the following two things it tastes like:   at first_ I thought it tasted like a LOBSTER'S URINE would_ with the same thickness/filminess.  Then_ I thought it tastes like what human skin blended up into a light syrup would taste like.  It's just NASTY.Braintree Laboratories_ the sick-minded people who make this garbage_ should be embarrassed at the atrocious product they are pushing.,M,45,1  days1 gal 4X H,6/7/2016,Golytely

6, 1, Colonoscopy prep,Vomiting_ nausea_,Drinking 4 liters of anything doesn't seem wise_ and in fact I ended up vomiting with burning throat_ horrible aftertaste.  The stuff itself is vile.

7, 4, Colonoscopy,Chills,Since most people only give ratings for poor outcomes_ I wanted to add my experience to help others needing to take this prep.  While I am sure everyone reacts differently_ for me it was not all that bad. Yes_ it didn't taste the best_ but I sucked on hard candies in between every 6 oz that I drank to counteract the taste. I drank the 6 oz quickly without hardly stopping most times. I did get chilled_ but a warm tea after I was done helped tremendously.  Also_ it helps to have a fireplace on_ if you have one. Started my 1st B.M. In 1 hr 15 mins_ completed drinking the entire prep in 3 1/4 hrs and finished the last B.M. In about 5 hrs. except a few small ones in the a.m.  Was mostly all yellow liquid by the 3rd hr.

8, 1, Colonoscopy,Bloating_ headache_ chills,I could only force 3 liters of the 4 liters down. Fortunately it was enough to clean me out for my colonoscopy. I vomited after drinking the last glass and the thought of drinking any more made me vomit. I took Suprep for my previous colonoscopy and that was so much easier to get down and I was done with the diarrhea within 2 1/2 hours. Its been nearly 24 hours since I had started the golytely and my stomach is still rumbling and I'm still having diarrhea.

The night before the clear liquid prep diet ) to get the bulk out of the way.  I did not use the flavor packet_ keep the mixture at room temperature and finished the gallon does in 2.5 hours drinking 16 oz. at a time. It began working in about 1.5 hours and in 4.0 hours ...""going"" medium yellow color.

Added water and Crystal lite to mix_ two packs were good for a gallon. I used the yellow lemonade_  due to thinking the pink had red dye...put in fridge for a few hours to chill. 7p.m started my first 8 oz glass...I pinched my nose_ and gulped it down.. Not too bad. By the third glass_ with 15 minutes in between_ was starting to get difficult. 5th glass_ started to gag.felt nauseous and bloated_ was getting cold chills. Took a few baths and then started the bowel movements. ..No pain or cramps_ due to starting the day earlier with my concoction I named above..So_ I didn't have that much to move through intestines...

18, 1, Colonoscopy,It was the worst experience ever still dealing with the side effects. Had taken it 5 days ago and can not stop the diarrhea it caused. Going to try activia yogurt to replace some of the good bacteria and hopefully that'll stop the diarrhea. It made me feel sick and disoriented which is hard to take care of three young children when you just feel like you're dying. I will never in my life do this again.

19, 1, colonoscopy,Most God awful taste ever imaginable to expect to consume 4 liters in 3 hours. Do what u gotta do I suppose. The lemon pack that came with it possibly made it worse... I've had this before but was given the 2 liter not 4. Plus 6 hours to drink it in and a pill before hand that started bowel movements then drank the drink which offered 4 flavors. No problem worked like a charm. Whereas this 4 liters of poison only made my stomach look to be 6 months pregnant_ bloat_ severe cramping_ dizzy and 3 hours into the drink and all but 2 8 oz left to go. When I could not bare the pain any longer and had to lay down. Leaving me having to plan on cancelling the appointment all together since not one bowel movement. I then prayed nothing happened as I passed out and woke up 530 covered in my own filth. Yuck.... seriously not feeling well at all making for an extremely very poopy day. With having to reschedule and after mother traveled 3 hours to help me out with getting me to n from and sitting with me 6 hours after.

Only a little nausea from taste but I didn't use any flavoring.,On the container it said for best results_ no solid food should be consumed for the 3 to4 hour period before drinking solution. Not sure if I should say this but but ate a full meal and finished it at 4:30pm and started drinking the solution at 8:40pm finished at 2am. Drinking 12-18oz at a time.  Started having to go to the bathroom at about 10:45pm. My stool cleared up at about 1:15am drank a little more to make sure my colon was clear. Doctor said I was cleaned out.I had to lie to doctors cause I know they wouldn't have approved.

Would not repeat it.I took the pineapple (was not given a choice- pre-mixed - no option provided).The sicky-sweet odor along with the thickness of the liquid were barely tolerable.I was nauseated from the first sip.Yes it was well-chilled.  Tried Crystal Light but it could not overcome the pineapple flavor & scent.  Finally figured out that for me all that worked was holding my nose & gulping_ then gulping soda before letting go of my nose (used diet Canada Dry ginger ale) followed by a cup of peppermint tea for each cup ingested.Did not get dehydrated due to the one-for-one liquids_ plus plenty of liquid throughout the day_ so no headache.Started split prep at 5:30 yesterday_ and completed first half at about 9:00.Off & on in bathroom till midnight.Got up at 3:00 & completed second round at 5:30.Appt at 9.Was clear & 8 (!) polyps found_ so clearly needed the colonoscopy_ but asked the nurses for advice for the next one & they agreed that they would use prepopik.Said that there are always options if you ask- I should have- now I know.,F,54,1  days4 l 1X D,12/31/2015Email,Golytely

I used 3 of the single serving packs for 2 liters and it did the job.  (2) I packed my drink on ice inside of a cooler bag.

(8) I woke feeling hungover.  (9) The second round was similar to the first_ but I felt more tired_ cold and hungover at the end.           Honestly_ it was not that bad.  The Crystal Ice and the Desitin were the two most critical parts of the prep.  I caught up on some Law and Order reruns and paged through some magazines.

68, 5, Colonoscopy following CDiff,I read all the reviews in the days leading up to my colonscopy prep and was terrified. I am kind of a wimp and was worried about choking it down. I got the unflavored kind (because I can't have fake lemon due to my interstitial cystitis). The advice to use chicken broth is the BEST ADVICE EVER!! Thank you to all the people who posted about that. I had no nausea (though I took zofran before_ just in case)_ no dizziness_ very little abdominal cramping! Recipe: 8 oz of golytely +1/3 cup of homemade chicken broth (made it the night before and separated all the fat from it_ so it was just very clear_ somewhat concentrated broth). I had absolutely no problem getting the whole 4L down. It took about 4 hours but I did it. I probably didn't need to drink it all but I definitely wanted to make sure I was cleaned out. I pre-measured the 8 oz in little kids sippy cups and then my husband would pour it into a mug_ add the chicken broth_ heat for 75 seconds_ and it was a tasty treat!OTHER ADVICE,My procedure was on a Tuesday morning. I started eating soft foods on Saturday_ then switched to liquids on Sunday afternoon_ then clear liquids (including jello and the occasional green gummy bear) all day Monday. I think it helped the prep go a bit more smoothly. I drank all 4L anyway just in case_ and then the next morning I went and it was a bit cloudy_ but my MD said it was fine and that he had good visibility and the prep had worked really well. If you get a colonscopy with twilight sedation_ expect to be out of it for the rest of the day! I don't remember ANYTHING my doctor told me right after the procedure. Also_ I recommend getting anti-nausea meds if you have anesthesia- I was quite nauseated from the demerol the next day and zofran really helped.,F,33,1  days 1X D,8/28/2014Email,Golytely

Nothing happened until 9pm ....  Then started the other half at 1:30am - been in the bathroom ever since (3:30am now). I may have a permanent ring from the seat on my backside.

Yesterday (2 days before procedure)_ I was told to drink 10 ounces of Magnesium Citrate. That was horrible. It was like drinking lemon flavored acid.So I was naturally extremely worried about having to drink 4 liters of the Golytely tonight. Many of the comments made me even more worried! However_ I didn't find the experience bad.I mixed in Crystal Light Lemonade with each individual glass like many people suggest. After each drink I took_ I would take a swig of Sierra Mist_ swish it around my mouth_ and spit it out. The hardest part is drinking as much as you need to. The taste wasn't nearly as bad as stomaching such a large amount of liquid.Two hours and only six 8 ounce glasses later_ I am passing clear bowel movements and am done!Just stay calm and approach it with a positive attitude. If you're feeling sick_ take a break.,F,22,1  days4 liters 1X D,2/2/2012,Golytely
107, 1, ,Gag_ Vomit.,Just like everyone else I followed the directions and put it in the fridge.  The next morning I grabbed the bottle and my measuring cup and headed to the living-room.  I thought I'd watch a little tv while drinking Golytely. But alas_ it just wasn't meant to be.  After the first swallow it came back up just like that scene in the Exorcist.  I waited twenty minutes and tried giving it another go...and ended up retching over the kitchen sink.  I was shocked because I have a very good gag reflex...and vomiting is a rarity for me.  I called the Dr...she advised me to drink two bottles of Magnesium Citrate. That did the job...I'll never try Golytely again.  ,F,53,  1X D,12/11/2011Email,Golytely
108, 3, colonoscopy,,After reading this site and others_ I was scared to DEATH of golytely. People were describing it as poison_ chalk and deadly. So when I took it out of the fridge and mixed it with some ginger ale_ as per my doctor's instructions_ I could not believe how normal it tasted. First of all_ there is no smell. Second of all_ there is no awful aftertaste whereby you will need a straw and a noseclip. It tastes like flat ginger ale -- ok_ not delicious_ but big deal. who hasnt had flat pop in their lifetimes? I also did not eat solid foods for three days -- drank ensure and water -- and I did not gulp the whole thing down like a maniac. They suggest pounding it down but it is not necessary. Sip it. From a glass. You will survive. On a scale of one to ten_ ten being the hardest_ this was a 2. Mostly_ it is boring.,F,47,  1X D,12/6/2011,Golytely

It mad me tired.(16) at 14 i was hospitalized from 6:30 am to 6:30 pm and had a tube in my nose pumping 3 bags of golytley . I would say it being in my nose was great bc there was no taste. When i left i was brand new i felt great even as days went on . The sencend time (16) however there was a different case i was drinking it at first and it was awful so i asked for a tube which they at first would not accomidate me  they later on realized a tube was necessary ... After wards i dont feel the same as before feel like im not all the way clear which is my fault for switching doctors but never the less i still 4 days latter have pain_loss of appittie_and feel irregular still. I feel like the second time was less sucessful bc i did not have enough i recommebd this but also i recommend not to leave until its crystal clear!

I had the option of adding a lemon flavor packet_ but elected not to use it.  I had to drink 8 oz every 10 minutes.  I bought some minute maid cran/apple/raspberry juice and just took a sip before and after the golytely.  worked fine.  I started to go to the bathroom about 40 minutes after I started the solution and very consisently since it's onset.  At the point that I am typing this I have consumed 136 oz of the solution and am definitely running clear.  I have about 3 more glasses to go.  I found that NOT wiping_ but rather patting_ was very helpful.  Also staying on the toilet for a few rounds rather than trying to wipe get up just to sit down again was very helpful.  I did not experience any nausea.  At first I felt very waterlogged... kind of like a full feeling_ but now I'm hungry!  Don't go into this with any pre-conceived notions about it.  Stay positive and you will fair well.

I added lemon flavor pack_ plus a lemonade Crystal lite.  Cut up a lime to numb my tastebuds.  I limed_ drank 10 swallows_ limed_ finished the glass_ limed_ each time.  It is an electrolyte_ therefore salty_ liquid_ which draws fluid into your gut to flush them.  Started working at 40 minutes_ and every 10 minutes after.  YES YOU CAN PEE OUT YOUR BUTT.  The brown stopped after three or so times_ then it turns to yellow/orange liquid.  I used petroleum jelly to protect around the exit_ but it BURNS the exit point nonetheless.  I advise rinsing off with water after every elimination...bidet_ shower_ sink rinse_ whatever.  I hour after finishing_ I had to drink one bottle of Magnesium Citrate_ a weird lemon lime.  Then proceeded to go even more for the next five hours(2 am got a break).  It was blessed when I took a shower(the stuff foams in the shower).  That's when I discovered that rinsing the area was wonderful.  No nausea or cramping... you can hear your bowels moving and RUN DON'T WALK to the loo 'cause its-a-coming!  I stopped being hungry around 11 am_ drank a bottle of clear juice and then a bottle of Cream Soda in between the prep_ had a bowl of boullion for ""dinner"" which tasted good_ then drank a ton of water all the way until midnight.

117, 5, Prep for colonoscopy,Very slight pressure in head.,I have read a lot of negative comments about Golytely but I think that's probably due to lack of preparation on the part of the individual. The day before I started my prep_ I only drank freshly juiced fruits and vegetables_ so that made it easier to transition to clear liquids only. As for the taste of the Golytely itself_ I had that covered because before I committed to taking the whole 4L of Golytely_ I tried one teaspoon in 8 oz of hot water and drank that first. It tasted like salt water. What also helped me is that_ each morning I usually drink the juice of a whole lemon in a glass of hot water. This morning I did the same thing_ and after that the Golytely had hardly any taste at all. Thereafter_ I was able to drink the whole 4L without any flavoring. However_ I strongly advise that before and after each dose of Golytely_ you drink some Gatorade (not the pink lemonade or any red liquid) to keep your electrolytes balanced_ that way you won't pass out or get dizzy. Also drink some water or juice after each bowel movement. Don't be too picky about following the directions exactly on time. If you can't chug it_ don't. If you can't drink 8oz every 15 minutes_ do it every 20 or longer. In my case_ once I'd tried it in an 8oz glass and it was fine_ I switched to 16oz every half hour. Pace yourself. Do what is comfortable for you. If you don't like it cold_ drink it at room temperature. Coming out the other end_ blot_ don't wipe. Good luck!,M,48,1  days4L 1X D,7/25/2011Email,Golytely

Each doctor is different in there orders and recommendations.  I also had to take two biscodyl pills 4 hours prior. (which_ I believe to be the worst feeling pre-prep ever!  Intense cramping_ dizziness_ feeling of fainting etc_ but after the first bowel movement(BM)_ no problems.)  This time was by far the best experience I have had!

This time I stopped eating Friday afternoon (my appt was Monday)_ so by the time I came to Sunday to start the pills_ I had one Major BM and after that it was all diarrhea.  Now_ its really important to set up your prep: prepare 4 liter the day before and put it in the fridge_ make sure you have TP_ mixing packet_ and Lemons and Limes.  So_ I chose lemon/lime crystal light (I had used the lemonade one before and really didn't like it) and cut up my lemons/limes.  I had an 8oz glass and one decent sized shot glass.  I put a small amount of mix and added the Golytely.  I poured the mixture into the shot glass_ took my lime or lemon(although I think the lime was better)_ sucked on it_ took the shot and then sucked on the lime some more_ until I finished that cup_ then repeated again in 10-15 minutes.

Very mild feeling of forehead pain at the end of the 3-4 a.m._ half gallon_ 16 Oz series. The 16 Oz dosage was my own idea to go through the half gallons fast.  Both the day-before colonoscopy and early morning I had easy dumping of liquid with no discomfort on or around anus despite of a known fissure in annal sphincter.,This is a kind of mild salty solution; since I like salty foods_ it was a breeze to drink the stuff. Golytely did not leave a bad aftertaste however_ I would not drink it for pleasure_ I rather drink red wine for pleasure (no dark or red-colored foods before the procedure doctor said_ only clear stuff).

133, 5, colonoscopy prep,None,I get a colonoscopy almost every year due to a benign tumor that was removed from my colon in 2006_ so I am now a Pro at taking golytely and almost never gag or puke when taking this vile solution. 1. It must be chilled--the colder_ the better.  2. I always add the lemon-lime packet when making it up.  3. On the night of the prep_ get a bendable straw and insert it into the glass_ then put the straw as far back in your throat as you can and still be able to suck. 4. Position yourself in front of the sink (in case you gag)_ pinch your nose and then start sucking on the straw and don't stop until the glass of golytely is gone. Do not stop pinching the nose yet! 5. Insert a lemon drop hard candy into your mouth and start rolling it all around the tongue. 6. As you unpinch your nose_ breath out hard forcing the smell out of your nostrils! 7. Take a small drink of cold water to mix with the lemon drop in your mouth.  Additional info: my doctor gave me permission to mix some ginger ale with each glass that I drink of the golytely_ but you must get permission from your doctor before doing so. Tonight I am prepping for colonoscopy #8 since 2006 so I fully understand the gagging and vomiting problem.  The straw/lemon-drop/nose pinch routine has enabled to go without vomiting since procedure prep #2.

I was told to drink 8 oz. of the Golytely every 15 minutes until it was all gone and to take the anti-nausea drugs they gave me (Reglan) if I felt any nausea. I can assure you that I would have been miserable if I had done that. Instead I took the Reglan 30 minutes before I started the prep. I mixed the Golytely early in the day so it would be super cold. I mixed in lemonade flavored Crystal Light with the Golytely that I poured in empty water bottles. I drank about 5 oz. (Dixie cup) every 20 minutes. If I started feeling too bloated I slowed it down to every 25 or 30 minutes. I was told that it was okay to stop once I had only clear liquid coming out. I went about 20 ounces past that just to make sure. Actually you want what is coming out to match what is going in so if you are adding lemonade Crystal Light then it will be pale yellow.  I had no nausea which is unusual for me as I get nauseous at the drop of a hat. I also had no cramping at all and next to no bloating. I used lots of Vaseline and Tucks to keep the soreness manageable. My way takes longer than the suggested instructions do_ but it was so much easier. The only change I would make would be to start earlier in the day so I would get more sleep at night. I started at 4:00 pm and finished about 11,F,53,1  days4 liters 4X H,1/18/2011Email,Golytely
137, 5, Colonoscopy,None really_ some discomfort_ bloat.,This is my third colonoscopy because I had colon cancer.Pharmacist have me the generic which is Polyethylene glycol(PEG).To me it has very little taste_ maybe a little salty.The one thing my nurse told me is that I didn't have to drink 8oz every 15 minutes. I could drink more_ faster if I wanted. So I used a 16oz class and drank half the jug in an hour. I started at 6pm and was off the toilet by 8:30pm. NOTE-Bring jug of PEG and glass into the bathroom_ there isn't much opportunity to go to the kitchen for refills :-) This worked a whole lot better than spending 3-4 hours on the throne.Next morning I repeated with the last half of the jug 5 hours before I left for the clinic. That is a new way to do it they told me. Split prep - Drink half the jug the night before_ and the other half 4-5 hours before you leave home. ,M,53,2  days4 liters 4X D,1/11/2011,Golytely
138, 5, Colonoscopy,"other than screaming diarrhea which is the ""desired"" effect_ had quite a bit of nausea.",I was so terrified of what it was going to taste like since I will get sick even at the mere mention of something gross.  However_ my dad told me it tastes like a bad margarita_ and you know what? It did.  I used a LOT of Crystal Light.  Four of their big packages to be honest_ and the water was very cold.  The taste was the least of my worries.  My butt must have looked like one of those red-butted baboons judging by how it felt by the third hour of toilet bonding.  If there were ever a good reason for having a bidet_ Golytely would be it.  Bottom line_ the taste was tolerable for 3/4 of the jug_ then you need divine intervention to get you through the rest.

I found from my fasting with low fiber_ mainly white food for 4 days made this whole experience so much better. By the time I consumed 7_ 8 oz of golytely_ I was running clear bowel movements. I read all the other advices and prepared myself and it really paid off. Make sure to have vasoline in the bathroom and use it after every bowel movement. Don't rub_ just blot when wiping. Keep hydrated and warm. It's 7pm the night before_ and I am feeling fine. Still running to the bathroom_ but all is clear. I highly recommend cutting your food consumption down before this procedure.

Like others mentioned_ be sure to make the gallon mixture the day before so it has time to chill. I prepoured it into 8 oz. bottles ready to chug down. The key_ really_ is to properly and adequately plan a few days ahead by printing out these pages_ highlight what you need to gather up for the designated bathroom and what you need to buy_ and make your grocery run_ then lastly set up one bathroom with all the necessary items and let nature take its course. My husband used half a jar of vaseline throughout the prep process to defray soreness from excessive wiping_ he wiped with Prep H cloths_ I put a small spare heater to keep him warm_ set up a beverage tub in the bathroom with 10 or so prepoured 8oz bottles of GoLyte plus numerous other beverages to chase it down with if necessary (it was not)_ 5 different types of Crystal Light flavor packets_ a blanket_ ample reading material_ etc. Everything I did is contained herein.

I can' t quit shivering with every swallow_ (although I'm sure this is due to the fact that it's cold. I would probably do this with any cold beverage.)

Reduces prep amount.   2 day with no flavorings.  8 glasses 1 every ten min. No problem drinking.  Make it cold like they say. Drink an 8 oz glass non-stop. Mild salt taste and clear. I guess the Polyethlene glycol is what people complain about. You can stop and then start again. I did experiment with maple syrup but didn't need it.  Will start to work in about a 1/2 hour with normal feelings. It is NOT hold your cheeks so it will not come out. You still have full control. You should go in the bathroom after you feel it. If you wait it gets absorbed and you will need more.  This is why you never get full. Has electrolytes so no hunger. Output not clear yet and had a good night sleep. The 2 day prep is good to get used to it. At 5AM the next day I went more aggressively. Clear yellow after 5th glass. 2 more glasses to make sure then finished the last poop. Showered and got to hospital on time. In summary: You are in control and you want a good prep. There is no smell and no mess. Just follow procedure and set up a system.  Only drank about 80% and would have been fine with less. I am normal with no particular aversions. I bet some people are wimps but there may also be valid medical reasons for problems.

151, 4, Colonoscopy Screening,None,I want to thank everyone for their tips and suggestions as many helped me through my first colonoscopy experience.  I decided to come back to this site now that I've completed the procedure to tell those of you who are awaiting your first colonoscopy not to be frightened by some of the comments left on here.  I respect that some people did have adverse reactions to the Golytely_ but I wanted to offer some reassurance that I did not find the laxative to be too bad.  It mostly tastes like salt water with an aftertaste.  The tips that worked the best for me were to mix up the drink the night before and refrigerate it overnight.  Then measure out the required 8 oz. cups and gulp quickly_ trying to think about something else.  Have a lemon wedge handy_ and immediately after gulping_ suck on the lemon wedge.  This helped me a great deal with the aftertaste.  My nurse told me I could mix Crystal Lite flavoring with the glasses of Golytely once it was poured into the glasses (don't mix directly into the jug); however_ I just drank the stuff plain.  I also highly recommend eating lightly a few days before_ sticking to healthy food/bland food.  Remember_ what you put into your body must come out_ so best to get regular bowel movements before beginning the laxatives.  If you are worried about the actual colonoscopy_ don't be...I slept through the whole thing!

Please remember as I tell my story that a colonoscopy is one of the most important thing you can do for yourself. But take precautions. I almost died.,I began to vomit after the 5th cup. By day 4 it still  hadn't worked. I was getting sicker and sicker. I could not hold down food. The only thing coming out of me was blood and golytely.By day five I dehydrated. I could not even hold up my head. I needed an IV and the ER. Of course the doctors say it was not the golytely. I have since learned that if you are severely constipated YOU SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE GOLYTELY. It can cause death. And they are not kidding. Please if you are constipated do not under any circumstances take this. It is on all the warnings. I copied the following from Golytely's own website CONTRAINDICATIONS GoLYTELY is contraindicated in patients withgastrointestinal obstruction_ gastric retention_ bowel perforation_ toxic colitis_ toxic megacolon or ileus.For those of you who do not know what contraindicated means (like me) I copied this from medicinenet.comContraindication: A condition which makes a particular treatment or procedure inadvisable. A contraindication may be absolute or relative. I love the way they say that. I needed a dictionary to look up the warning. Save yourself or a loved one. Research_ you can verify everything I said at Mayo_ Drug.com and I am sure a lot more. Take care and remember the good does outway the bad but we should have better warning.

I didn't need any other flavorings_ hard candy_ Popsicles_ etc. although I had them on hand just in case. I was hungry but_ again_ that didn't even bother me that much.  Maybe it was because I was so apprehensive after reading all the comments but the whole thing wasn't that bad.

I have Idiopathic Gastroparesis now for almost 7 years that shut down my colon function so to stay from being toxic I had to drink this stuff until a week ago when I had a horrible allergic reaction that effected the meninges in my head-lining/brain. I would NOT recommend this medication to anyone even those doing it for a surgery or a colonoscopy because there are many other preps with no hidden or long term side effects of Poly Glycol overdose. I suggest mag-citrate over the counter or Miralax and Gatorade. Most hospitals and doctors are backing off of using this toxic stuff. If you ever feel the salt sensation in your head please stop drinking it asap and call your doctor. You too could be having a severe allergic reaction. If your pulse rises and blood pressure drops you too could be having a severe allergic reaction.

Used MoviPrep for my colonoscopy last month_ and it was much worse that Golytely_ so I guess I'm thankful the Golytely isn't as bad.....because I'm having major surgery tomorrow and I HAVE to get cleaned out! My tips: Use a LARGE/FAT straw. If you don't have one_ go shopping and find one before you start your jug! It helps a great deal! I did plug my nose and that helped hide the taste. My hospital recommended getting my tongue cold with a popscicle_ then drinking then putting the popscicle back on my tongue. That helped through several cups. Tried the cinnamon discs & hard candy for several cups.  The Crystal Lite Raspberry Lemonade flavor also helped for a few cups. What I found that worked best of all was swishing some real maple syrup around in my mouth (it's quite thick & stayed on my gums & sides of my mouth) then drank the solution_ and when I was done with the cup_ there was still some of the syrup in mouth so I didn't taste the solution and the only aftertaste was the maple syrup!

169, 2, colonoscopy,weird stomach gurgling_ i felt cold_ shaky_ small pains in stomach,First of all I want to thank you for all of your comments because they all really helped me as I prepared for my colonoscopy.This stuff tastes absolutely awful and there is no getting around it. Mine was unflavored_ but I assume that the flavor packets would just add an artificial flavor that would still make this stuff unpalatable.  So_ some tips:1) Make sure its cold cold cold. Chill it for as long as you can.2) Use a straw. Put it sort of far back in your throat and gulp3) Plug your nose and never let yourself really 'taste' this stuff...I know for a fact that if I allowed myself to taste it_ it would have been game over4) Have hard lemon candy nearby and after a gulping session stick one in your mouth for a few seconds. This way you never really get the full taste of the medicine in your mouth5) Put on a tv show/music you really like during the process to take your mind off everythingI hope these tips help. ,F,29,2  days3L 2X D,7/1/2010,Golytely

I have only made it through 40 ounces of this salty horsespit flavored with some Godawful pineapple taste and a bizarre poison aftertaste.  I already vomited once. I am going to try the straw thing...holding my nose definitely does not work.  My husband has been attempting to coach me through. It has been an hour so far and nothing yet (bowels)....I may not know what I am in for_ but I would sure rather be on the pot than feel like wretching like I do right now. Gagger!!!

171, 4, colonscopy,mild nausea and bloating and a sore bum.,I was dreading this big time because of the taste of Golytely and what I was reading about it.  It wasn't fun but it wasn't as bad as I thought (and I'm a big baby about being nauseated). I did find biting into a lemon after each drink or rinsing with some lemonade kept that yucky taste out of my mouth.  I then put a lemon drop in my mouth till the next drink.  In between my drinks I decided to clean my house so I wasn't sitting around thinking and thought it would move things thru faster. I think that helped also with the nausea and to keep from getting bloated.  (along with the lemon drops)  I strongly recommend baby wipes or anything to keep your bum from getting sore.,M,45,1  days2.5 liters 1X O,6/27/2010,Golytely

My DH_ the colonoscpyee_ is a very slow drinker_ and I was concerned tht I would not be able to get him to drink all that 4 liters.  We got some plastic cups_ (Walmart) with straws attached_ and carefully measured and marked out 8 ounce levels.  I filled the cups with the Golytely_ and put them all back in the fridge.  Every 15/20 minutes_ I would bring him the cup.  He had some really stupid_ funny CD's to watch_ and when required_ he would just suck it down.  The cinnamon hard candy helped as a chaser_ or some other liquid. It took him about 5 hours_ and he finished all but the last cup_ but was running clear by then.  A little cramping_ but not much. The procedure was a success_ and they did not find anything significant.  He is 81!,,M,81, 4 liters 1X D,6/23/2010,Golytely

I was instructed to take 2 dulcolax pills_ then wait 30 minutes before starting to drink the GoLytely.  The first hour went well (1 glassful every 10-15 minutes).  I started to get headachy and sick to my stomache but went on into the 2nd hour.  Had to pee every 30 minutes or so and had a lot of indigestion and belching.  Managed to get 3 or 4 more glasses down but felt very sick.  During the 3rd hour I started salivating every time I looked at the glass and couldn't seem to get any more down.  Still did not have a bowel movement. I started to get a little worried -- it had been almost 4 hours since the Dulcolax and I had drank half of the GoLytely with no urge to ""go"".  I called the on-call doctor to find out what I should do and was advised that my situation was very unusual -- I should take the last 2 Dulcolax pills and continue to drink the GoLytely but if I started to have severe belly pain to call him back and prepare to go to the emergency room.  I took the Dulcolax and tried to drink more GoLytely but as soon as it hit my stomache_ I vomited everything up (about 3 glasses worth).  I wasn't in severe pain_ but I could not drink any more.

Another good tip was to mix it the morning before you're supposed to begin and mix it with Crystal Light Lemonade (4 packs to 4 liters). It was cold and while salty_ really no where near as bad as everyone said. I chugged it as quickly as possible quaffing the first 2 liters last night in 40 minutes and the second this morning in 30. It acts very quickly and your stomach will let you know when to head to the bathroom. Surprisingly there was no straining and the actual discharge was primarily water. I blotted with toilet paper and used petroleum jelly between rounds.

(It will also reduce your risk of colon cancer.),F,51,1  days,10/12/2009,Golytely
210, 5, Colonoscopy,Very minor bloating and discomfort several times just before I had to evacuate.  Otherwise no real side effects noticed.,This product made my colonoscopy not be such a negative undesirable examination.  It is the best laxative preparation I have ever used. The electrolyte solution made a lot of difference compared to other laxatives that were prescribed in the past.  I did not go through the brain dead_ sapped physical feeling that I always get when using other products.  Another really good thing_ I recovered very well without having a ravenous appetite.  The electrolyte really made a difference. I did not mind the taste_ but it did become a little more difficult to get it down after the 3rd hour of drinking it at 15 minute intervals.  It worked rather quickly.  The next time I have to cleans my bowl I want to use this product.,M,63,1  days,10/3/2009Email,Golytely

I drank it for 2 1/2 hours trying to get the stool clear_ but then saw on the internet that it could be watery and yellow_ so I quit. I am still going even though I quit drinking it almost an hour ago.  The taste wasn't as bad as last time I remember. I wish I had remembered about having a sore anus and done something before it got to this point.  I'm going to go take a hot bath and see if that helps.,F,48, ,9/10/2009,Golytely
218, 4, Colonoscopy Prep,None_ really.,GoLytely tastes like salt water.  I didn't add anything_ but here's what  worked pretty well for me: I poured it into an 8-oz glass_ held my nose and drank it with a straw which was positioned fairly far back in my mouth.  I gulped it down because I didn't want to taste it.  Don't let go of your nose or you WILL gag.  I drank 16 glasses and felt that was plenty.  There was still enough for about another glass-and-a-half left; OH WELL.  No results for about an hour - 8 glasses worth.  Then_ I had about 3 trips where I thought I was going to fill the entire toilet.  After that_ trips were frequent but more clear.  My butt surely did get sore.  I would advise just dabbing the area gently - I didn't use any vaseline_ but that is probably an excellent idea.  I had some broth and white wine for dinner_ Jello for dessert_ and will be retiring to bed shortly so I don't have to think about how hungry I am.,F,51,1  days,9/8/2009Email,Golytely

The taste is more of a salt water solution_ which while not the best thing to drink_ was not too unpleasant.  I drank it with a straw_ eight ounces at a time_ every 10 min.  It seams as fast as you drank it you were on the toilet.  I rinsed my mouth out with a small amout of water with a little lemon juice mixed in which did away with any after taste.

I figure I'm still getting the required amount of liquid_ but only half of the vile taste each time. However_ even with this adaptation_ about 2/3 of the way through_ my mouth simply wants to reject this stuff and it begins to run out of my mouth as I try and drink it. I'd really like some opinions on what flavor helps make this more palatable. I don't think my dr. will allow adding the lemonade_ but I do have cherry_ lemon-lime_ pineapple and orange packets.

229, 1, colonoscopy prep,I didn't even get to take the Golytely portion of the prep.  My instructions were to take 4 Dulcolax tablets at the outset.  Well within 90 minutes of that dosing_ I began to feel faint_ crampy and passed out.  When I came to I was shaky_ had palpitations and my husband called 911.  I was in the hospital for four days.  I was given the antibiotic Flagyl in the hospital (don't ask me why) and I suffered from severe vertigo.  Prior to the Golytely attempted prep_ I used to take Fleet Phosphosoda with absolutely no adverse reaction.  Talk about an unpleasant experience.  Well I must say the Dulcolax worked.

Luckily_ being the raging alcoholic that I am_ I was able to pound the large amount of horrible tasting liquid.  It did leave my stomach feeling nauseous though.  Somewhere around the 571st trip to the bathroom_ my anus felt like I had been raped by an elephant and I did not know if I could stand to go again_ but this lovely medicine does not give you the choice.

I made a mess because I was hoping I wouldn't lose what I worked so hard to swallow.,My Doctor allowed us to drink half the jug at 6 pm and the rest at 6am for an afternoon colonoscopy.  I think if you are a slow eater and drinker_ perhaps drinking 6 oz instead of 8oz might help you get through it better if you start to get too full of it in your stomach like I did.  The second half jug in the morning went so much easier than the first half drinking_ but I hadn't followed the suggestion of putting vaseline on my anus so I was in damage control mode just slathering it on my soreness and aggravated previously dormant hemorrhoids.  Get a fresh tub of vaseline and just slather it on from the first bowel movement and it should be fine.  The colonoscopy people were nice.  It wasn't embarrassing as I thought at all.  I took the suggested pain and relaxer drugs in smaller amounts and got to go home quicker.  When the gas did start to pass it made me vomit a little when it first passed_ but then it all came out and I drifted off to sleep.

After 105 minutes_ the preparation began to have the desired effect. I was a little concerned about that ""delay_"" but the worry was misplaced. Golytely does not taste good_ but please follow the advice of other visitors to this site: Mix the preparation with lukewarm water (say_ 96 ounces of cold tap water or chilled bottled water and 28 ounces of boiling water)_ shake thoroughly_ and chill overnight. Pour out eight-ounce portions as you need them (that is to say_ fill a measuring cup_ drink the contents through a straw immediately and quickly_ and then fill the cup again) and then place the jug back in the fridge; this way_ you take the jug from the fridge every half hour and keep its contents well chilled. I didn't mix Golytely with anything; I sipped tonic water now and again over the course of the four hours. Knock on wood_ I didn't find taking this preparation to be a horrible experience at all. For those who wish to avoid a sore anus: Coat the anus liberally with Vaseline before wiping_ and wipe less vigorously. Indeed_ you should blot rather than wipe. The copious amounts of liquid that emerge_ often with tremendous force_ from your bowels cannnot soil you.

255, 1, prep fpr colonoscopy,a bit of stomach cramps so far.  to be expected I guess.,I just finished with my first 8ozs.  I have the rest of that huge bottle to go. It took me almost 2 hours to get the 8 ozs down! I have to drink it slowly and spread the prep over 2 days as I had gastric bypass surgery and can't drink large quantities too quickly. Worse yet - I will have to do this EVERY year as I have Lynch Syndrome and have to have a colonoscopy every year!  LS is a genetic condition which carries a VERY high risk (up to 80%) of getting colon cancer. I was just diagnosed so this is my first colonoscopy. There has to be a better way to get cleaned out.  I think I'll ask the doc to put in a naso-gastric tube and pump the stuff directly in my stomach next time!  You'd think if we can put a man on the moon_ a better tasting drink could be made!,F,51, ,2/22/2009,Golytely
256, 5, Prep for Colonoscopy,None other then bloating for the first hour before I started running to the bathroom.,I take this stuff every 3 years as a prep for my colonoscopy.  Had Colon Cancer 32 years ago.I found that if you mix the mixture up the evening before you have to start drinking it the following day and refrigerate it so it gets very cold it's better.  You must keep it refrigerated with each glass you pour out.  This is what I do_ pour out 8 ozs in a glass_ mix 1/4 teaspoon of Crystal Lite Lemonade powder to each glass as you get ready to drink it_ put a straw in your glass_ take a deep breath_ let out the air_ and while holding your breath_ drink it down without coming up for air through the straw_ it gets past your taste buds that way.  When you finish drinking the glass full_ immediately pop a piece of lemon or pineapple hard candy in your mouth_ suck on it a couple seconds and then save it for the next glass.  I can drink a glass every ten minutes doing it this way.  Hope it helps_ it's made it a lot easier for me.  My husband just had one done a couple days ago_ he followed my method,F,65,30  years,2/15/2009,Golytely
257, 4, colonscopy prep,sore anus about the time of finishing the golytely,This is the second time I have taken this med and it tasted so much better this time because I used LUKEWARM water to mix it up  (then refrigerated for 6 hours before using).  Using LUKEWARM water dissolved the chemicals and made it taste MUCH better this go round.  Last time used cold water to mix it up and it tasted horrible!,F,50,1  days,2/9/2009,Golytely
258, 3, colonoscopy,gagging_ cramping,golytely tastes like you're drinking your tears.  it's disgusting!  it wasn't so bad to start off_ but after the 2nd glass_ you don't wanna drink it anymore.  i actually had a chaser while i drank it (gingerale)_ since i could not keep the stuff down without it.  i was supposed to drink an 8 oz glass every 15 minutes_ but i couldn't drink it that fast.  as soon as i was done_ it felt like i had to drink another.  so the time i was drinking it spanned a lot more hours than it should have.  it definitely did the trick for me as far as cleaning me out though.,F,30,1  days,2/2/2009,Golytely

260, 1, colonoscopy prep,The only side effect was total disgust at the flavor_(something like liquid laundry detergent)_  and quantity I had to ingest.,This product is_ without doubt_ the most vile and disgusting thing I have ever been forced to drink. Unfortunately_ I have to go through this ordeal again next week. I have informed my doctor that I will never again_ after next week_ go through this_ no matter the consequences.,M,65,1  days,1/15/2009,Golytely
261, 3, Colonopsy,chills_a little like I'm going to barf_ but not too bad_ little stomach pain on and off,I'm on my last glass of Golytely for the day and praying it starts to clean me out cause I don't want to go through this again.  I have to get up at 3am and drink 1 litter more.  This is my second time having a Colonopsy done and from what I recall 3 years ago_ the fleet worked better for me.  Good luck to you all!!,F,37,2  days,11/17/2008,Golytely
262, 1, capsule endoscopy and colonoscpy,Chills_ nausea_ weakness,I have had to take this twice now. The first time I was in the hospital from internal bleeding and they wanted to do a colonoscopy on me. It did not clear me out and I had to take another medication to finish the job.The most recent time I took it for preparation of a capsule endoscopy. My side effects were so strong I nearly went in the ER_ and only stayed out so I did not have to cancel the test. Again I did not get totally flushed out and am hopeful that it was good enough for what was done.I will never take this again after the side effects I experienced. I can handle most things_ but nearly being sent to the hospital because of how my vitals were getting all screwed up is not worth it.,M,50,1  days,7/31/2008,Golytely
263, 1, Colonoscopy (4 years).,After drinking 3/4 of this_ I began to vomit.  Called surgeon and he said to not drink additional as he would do procedure anyway.,This is the recommended pre-surgical preparation as Fleet is damaging to the kidneys but_ think I'd rather forego having another colonoscopy than be required to go this route.  I quit after glass no. 6.,F,70, ,6/10/2008,Golytely
264, 1, 5-year routine colonoscopy,Within two hours_ started feel really weird in my head after drinking this awful stuff.  Actually had a mild stroke_ so they could not do the colonoscopy.  Never again will I put myself through this.  I really believe I had a bad reaction to this stuff resulting in a mild stroke.  I was fine until I drank this gallon_ and had actually requested the smaller bottle_ but was refused this.  No one can or want to say this caused the stroke_ but I will go to my grave believing this.  Of course_ the doctors rule it as a coincidence...bull!! My life has changed because of the stroke even though mild. Chances of having another stroke are greater.,Never again will I drink this awful stuff.  Drank it over a four hour period as told by the doctor to do. Was told by doctors that people need a routine colonoscopy every five years. I have changed doctors and he is now telling me every ten years.,F,68,1  days,4/9/2008,Golytely
265, 1, Dr's orders,I am responding for my mother who was given golytely along with antibiotics for pneumonia. This was in Aug she is now in her fourth hospital since then She has had diaherra for six months with as many as 17 bouts of diaherra a day. She is losing the ability to keep herself hydrated. Also I feel this has escalated her into dementia.I would seriously think twice before taking this garbage,With all the adverse effects this has had on people there must be some legal action that can be taken but no lawyer here in Las Vegas Nevada will talk to me about it,F,83,1  days,1/14/2008Email,Golytely
266, 1, preparing for colonoscopy,Nausea,I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy- I gagged at every swallow.There was no amount of sweetener that you could've put in it to make that sickening sea water taste normal_ IT'S NOT! It is one of those things in life that you just have to do_ it is NOT pleasant but it does do it's job if you can keep it down!,F,35,4  times,9/17/2007,Golytely
267, 1, Prep for Colonosocopy,I had edema in the colon tissues from Golytely making it impossible to even do the colonosocopy. It did not clear my bowels_ the swelling inside almost closed the colon completely. After about 2 days_ the swelling starting going down and I began to pass a lot of mucus.,I would love to hear if anyone else had a reaction like this.,F,53,1  days,4/22/2007Email,Golytely
268, 5, colonoscopy for anemia,brief bloating solved by waiting then continuing.  there was no cramping at all.  I also happen to like jello.,forget the flavor packets they give you -  too weak.  use crystal light orange flavor powder packets (two to the jug_ then adjust for taste._ it's just like sipping juice - albeit alot of juice.........,F,48,1  days,3/13/2007Email,Golytely
269, 4, prep for colonoscopy,Nausea about the 7th glass.,"Golytely is a pre-colonoscopy prep fluid_ I was asked to drink about twelve glasses of it_ one glass every 15 minutes.  Five ""flavor packs"" are included_ the general consensus of the folks in the GI department I talked to was that orange was the ""least obnoxious"".  The first few glasses went down pretty easily_ not delightfully flavored_ sort of a mix of four parts water to one part fruit-scented dishwasher soap.  Around the sixth glass I started to feel a bit of nausea_ I (according to instructions) took a break for a half an hour before resuming.  This helped quite a bit.  It got more unpalatable as time went on_ the last glasses were just hard to get down.  I blogged this in more detail at http://colonoscopyblog.blogspot.comI did not experience cramping or other pain_ just the bit of nausea.  Golytely was quite effective_ I was throughly... flushed.",M,45,1  days,12/21/2006,Golytely

271, 5, preparation for colonoscopy,This tastes like sea water_ but_ other than that_ worked just like it was supposed to with bloating but no nausea_ cramping or problems.Had to drink 8 oz every 15 minutes over 4 hrs (1 gal. total).... got half to 3/4 of the stuff in me before it started working so was bloated.  Others had scared me with their experiences_ but it worked fine for me.,Not the most fun time I've had_ but it works.,F,56, ,12/5/2005,Golytely
272, 1, prepare for colonoscopy,He had only one more quart to go when my husband's stomach pains became unbearable. The pain had been increasing in area above intestine.  Now_ two days later_ he has experienced off and on hiccupping lasting for hours at a time_ stomach pains for two days.  We took him for medical care this morning; they performed X-ray_ blood tests_ urinalysis; gave him Phenergan for hiccups and Donnatal for bloating & gas.  Seeing what he went through_ I never want to take Golytely.  Forget it!!!  One last bit of information--the stuff didn't even work.  My husband had to take Fleet enemas the next morning before the colonocopy.,,M,82,1  days,10/8/2005,Golytely
