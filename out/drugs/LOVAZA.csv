1, 5, High Tryglycerides,Mild burping.,Lowered Tryglycerides from 750 to 300.  Lowered Cholesterol from 265 to 230.  This drug definitely works_ but it is expensive.  This stuff is literally Rx fish oil and I wonder whether over the counter fish oil would be equally beneficial.  A benefit of this drug is has no adverse effects on liver function.  I had to add lipitor to my treatment.,M,42,90  days2 gm. 2X D,5/23/2011,Lovaza
2, 5, BiPolar and Rheumatoid Arthritis,gas - but my body is adjusting_very high copay compared to other scripts - shiny hair and good skin,,F,42,4  weeks1 GM 2X D,2/20/2011,Lovaza
3, 5, Triglyceride,Burping!!!,My triglyceride level is @ 94.,M,50,3  years1 gm 4X D,9/8/2010,Lovaza
4, 5, triglycerides,none,reduced triglycerides from 300 to 136 in a two month period.,M,51,2  months,12/29/2009,Lovaza
5, 5, high triglycerides (565),No side effects at all.,Extrememly expensive and I don't have any insurance whatsoever. No way I can afford $150 every month for it. I'm taking just one a day but it'll have to do. In under 2 months it brought my trigs from 565 down to 200. But I was/am also on Crestor so I'm sure it was the combination of both. I tried taking an OTC fish oil and had gas real bad so went back to Lavaza. At least I smell better lol,F,50,6  months,10/21/2009,Lovaza
6, 5, high triglycerides,brought my triglycerides down considerably and to within normal range,,F,45,2  years,12/14/2008,Lovaza
7, 3, triglycerides,nothing overt,exceedingly expensive.  going to a medical plan that does NOT pay anything for this drug.  Have cut back to 1 cap night and 1 day.  Will taper down.  Began modest NIACIN at night_ helpful.,M,67,2  years,11/24/2008,Lovaza
8, 2, Abnormal lipid panel,None,Cholesterol dropped 16 points in about 5 months_ but triglycerides rose 100 points. My doctor is very confused_ as am I. These capsules are not small - I also took flaxseed oil_ Co-Q-10 and while the drop in cholesterol is good_ the rise in triglycerides is not. I am a severe high risk_ but cannot take statins so have to rely on other means to control familial hypercholesterolemia.,F,56,5  months,9/29/2008,Lovaza
9, 1, High triglycerides,Emptying of wallet,My insurance didn't cover this medication_ and at $120 per month out of pocket_ I can't afford it.  My pharmacist advised me to take a fish oil dietary supplement instead.  So far my triglycerides have come down over 100 points using the dietary supplemnt.  Don't waste your money on this overpriced fish oil.,M,38,2  months,9/26/2008,Lovaza
