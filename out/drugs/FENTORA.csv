4, 5, sarcoidosis_ chronic pericarditis_,My gums get a little sore,This is an amazing drug. I have been in such severe pain and this is the only thing that has been able to REALLY REALLY work and FAST_ especially for when my heart is involved. Too bad my damn insurance co. BCBS after two years of me taking fentora_ they have decided that since I don't have cancer_ I can't have it anymore_ unless I want to pay out of pocket $5500 a month. Which I don't have. I am appealling as we speak_ but it doesn't look good. Does anyone have any suggestions_ to help me fight them_ I really need to have this approved. I have every other narcotic you can name_ they don't come close to the releif the fentora offers! (oxycontin_ dilaudid_ fentanyl patch_ MS contin_ methadone_ neurontin_ etc) please contact me if you can help me!! Thanks Tee,F,42,28  months,7/20/2009Email,Fentora

6, 5, pain_ failed spinal surgeries,sore bleeding gums_ mild headache_ occasional dizziness with nausea and vomiting( only if taken without food),Fentora is a Godsend! I have chronic intractable pain with a spinal cord injury and Fentora is the only med that makes the pain tolerable. I only use Fentora now for my pain_ I take 800mcg qid. I was able to stop taking oxycontin_methadone_and dilaudid. This med really helps! I used Actiq 1600mcg prior to Fentora and this form of Fentanyl is much stronger. Plus_ it is sugar free_ so even though my gums get sore_ my teeth are safe. On Actiq I had 6 cavities in the first year. I just went to the dentist and I have zero with Fentora.,F,27,1  days,12/8/2007,Fentora
7, 4, pain,sleepiness,Fentora works extremely fast and is effective since it is absorbed throught the gums and cheek.  When my pain is at its worst I can not keep a pill down. Fentora is a life saver.,F,25,4  months,11/30/2007,Fentora
