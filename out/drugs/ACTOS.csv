1, 1, Type 2 diabetes,Gross weight gain_ constant tiredness_ swelling in ankles,I told my endocrinologist I am going off Actos and will never touch it again. It's horrible. It's banned in Europe although my doctor pooh-poohed that. I gained weight steadily_ a pound a month without relief_ even with lots of exercise and good diet. I already take glimeperide (about 3 mg per day average) and will go on Byetta if necessary. But after just three weeks off Actos_ I am starting to feel better_ have way more energy_ and am starting to slowly lose a little weight. I think I can get back to normal weight in a few months (faster if I go on Byetta). Actos is evil incarnate. How can gross weight gain possibly be good for anyone let alone a diabetic? My doctor could care less so now I do the research and tell him what I want to take.,M,67,18  months45mg 1X D,5/23/2016,Actos

59, 1, Type II Diabetes,Experienced horrible leg pain_ especially behind knees down the back of my lower legs.  Doctor had no answers for me.  Could hardly get up from seated position_ in and out of a car_ and in and out of the shower.  Once coming to a standing position from being seated_ I would have to stand for up to 30 sec. before I could walk.  The first 5 min. of walking was very uncoordinated and then finally I could walk normally.  So grateful to come across this site to see that others have experienced the same side effects.,This has been so frustrating.  I thought I was getting ovarian cancer with all the bloating or MS with the leg issues.  Stopped the drug 6 days ago and have seen some relief.  Have been able to get up from a seated position and start to walk without having to wait several seconds. Still a bit uncoordinated for the first few steps. Weight has increased while on this drug so I am hoping that I will have good results from having stopped the medication.  Since I started with the bad pain back in February of 2010_ and never attributed it to this drug_ I am hoping it has not caused irreparable damage.  I see that others have had good results after stopping Actos so that was very encouraging to read.  I didn't see my symptoms listed as common side effects with Actos so I never suspected the drug as the cause of my problems.,F,61,2  years45 mg 1X D,7/31/2011Email,Actos

I did not have tooth problems_ but found something interesting,At the time of my problem_ I contacted Takeda and asked what specific problems people have had with teeth (a side effect listed on the drug label). They had no idea. BUT I recently learned that there are tiny ligaments which help hold your teeth in_ and it dawned on me that if this hell-drug damages ligaments and tendons in other parts of your body_ why not teeth? We will NEVER get an answer from the FDA or Takeda_ so we must keep sharing and searching on our own. Everyone_ PLEASE file a report with the FDA. It's easy and you can do it on-line.

It has been almost a week since I got off the drug and I am drinking 80 oz of water and urinating between 130 and 150 oz.  I know I have lost a lot of weight but I don't want to step on the scales until the urinating gets down to at least 80 oz.  What I couldn't understand was why I was gaining weight and eating very good.  I had originally had been on Avandia but about 2 years ago the doctor put me on 45MG Actos.  About 6 months ago he reduced it to 1/2 of 45MG.  My last blood work showed that I was Anemic and my blood pressure which had been great was out of control.  It wasn't until I developed swelling in the ankles that my doctor became concerned.  He had me take an Ultrasound on the legs which turned out fine.  There is absolutely no doubt that Actos was the cause and I really think this drug was KILLING ME.,M,65,2  years1/2 of 45 1X D,2/2/2011,Actos

110, 1, Blood Sugar Control,After my mother has been on Actos for about 5 years_ the last six months she is experiencing significant abdominal swelling edema primarily of the legs and feet.,How long after stopping Actos does water retention improve?  When my mother first started using Actos I liked it because it effectively helped manage her blood sugar levels.  Her Drs. (cardio/kidney) recently took her off Metformin (kidney impact)_ Actos (swelling/edema)_ and Avapro (too low blood pressure).  We are using Glipizide since to manage her sugar control_ so far that is working well.  It is too soon to tell if the Actos is the culprit with the swelling but that is my main concern right now.  My mother is very winded just walking around within the house short distances.  I've seen questions on this site about how long it takes after stopping Actos for the swelling/edema to start to improve but there seems to be no clear answer.  Today is day four and so far no significant improvement.   I would love to hear from others on this topic about when we might see edema problems subsiding.,F,85,5  years15 MG 1X D,4/27/2010Email,Actos

Tooth pain.,My endrocrinologist took me off Actos and within a week I had lost 13 pounds without changing my eating or exercise habits_ all the other pains_ edema_ etc_ have resolved. This clearly was the Actos and I will never take it again.  I can't even imagine what this was doing to the inside of me.  I reported these symptoms to multiple doctors who told me to watch my sodium intake.  Sodium had nothing to do with this and that was a huge cop out from these doctors who I will be looking to replace.  Very sad doctors don't support their patients when they report these symptoms. I feel so much better now since I stopped taking this even though my blood sugar has had an increase it just isn't worth the horrible pain and impact on my quality of life these last 5 years.

117, 4, A1C 8.0_ Type II,None so far,Controls my sugar very well. To start_ my A1C was 8.0_ Cholestrol 325 and liver values slightly out of range as well. After starting Actos for a year_ in combination with Lipitor (20mg) my A1C went down to 6.0_ and my Liver values came back into normal ranges (ALT & AST) You can't beat that !!!! Initially some muscle pain_ but that went away_ as excerize and diet helped eliminate muscle issues. Weight went down as well from 337 lbs to 285 lbs. Dr says if I keep this up_ I may come off the Actos in another year. This is a great drug to help manage your sugar_ then you get off of it once you cure the basic cause (Over-weight). It does a great job of helping to manage your Type II as long as you make an effort to control your appetite_ excerize_ and do what it takes to get off the drug after a period of time.,M,58,1  years15mg 1X D,3/13/2010,Actos

They sent a form for my doctor to fill out and return. When I asked what kind of tooth problems_ they did not have any answers. I did not get a drug information sheet from my pharmacist_ but it would have been helpful. I continue to have intermittent pain in arms/shoulders_ fingers (one finger still has excruciating pain). The pain is less severe_ but it still interferes with my life. I believe my doctor thinks I am delusional_ or at best_ that this is an unusual reaction.

I broke a thumb at Thanksgiving and a tooth below the gum line after New Years.  I didn't think anything about it until I got a drug reaction sheet from my pharmacy.  It seems actos causes women to have hand and finger fractures and teeth issues.  I took both Byetta and Actos for about 6 months and have since stopped both drugs,I stopped they Actos because I had a hand fracture and lost a tooth.

I started with 15 mg and started to gain weight with some muscle pain that went away in about two weeks.  After my doctor bumped me up to 30 mg my weight gain has almost leveled off (14 pounds total) but I believe it is due to the fact that my upper body muscle mass is shrinking while I am still adding fat cells to my thighs_ hips and butt.  At the same time I started to get muscle pain (trigger points) in my shoulder_ chest and upper back area.But Actos has controled my blood sugar levels very nicely and I seem to be getting rid of my muscle pain again.

130, 1, Type 2 Diabetes,I began taking 15mg of pioglitazone in May of '09 and experienced progressive constant pain_ sore throats_ a throat infection and earache_ some ankle swelling_ and moderate weight gain (5-7 lbs). The whole summer was miserable due to the generalized pain and malaise. My blood sugars were still high_ so I saw an endocrinologist on July 25th_ who put me on 45 mg of pioglitazone. At the time I did not realize my symptoms were related to this hell drug_ so I took the larger dose until September 11th. My pain was constant_ level 10/10_ I couldn't walk more than 20 ft without shortness of breath_ I had continuous throat irritation_ difficulty swallowing_ headaches_ and icy cold hands and feet. In my sleep I even dreamed I was in pain. The pain was all over_ but particularly bad in my shoulders and arms.One finger was swollen and constantly throbbed with excruciating pain. Four days after stopping this hell drug_ my pain decreased about 40% and continues to decrease_ as have all the other s,"My symptoms started on the 15mg dose and progressed to a critical point after taking the 45mg dose for 2 weeks. I did not realize all my symptoms were related to this drug until I did some on-line research. After reporting this to my doctor_ he saw me in the office 2.5 weeks later.  He should have seen me right away and checked my CK level (an enzyme release with muscle damage which could cause renal failure). He didn't seem too concerned and assured me this is a safe drug which only causes side effects in a very few patients. There is an FDA Black Box Warning on this hell drug which addresses heart failure_ but in my opinion_ these other side effects are also life-threatening. By the way_ at the time I was also taking long-acting insulin_ metformin_ and was very compliant with my diet. I an an RN and should have known better. It grieves me that very few health care providers listen or pay attention to patient reports (we in the profession call them ""complaints_"" as if they have no validity).

138, 1, Type II diabetes,Initially actos seemed wonderful. Then the weight gain started. I had recently lost 50 lbs and was dismayed to be gaining weight after improving my diet and exercising regularly. I noticed achy muscles and fatigue but attributed it to the weight gain (40lbs in 6 months). with the muscle pain came slight joint pain (ankles/knees some shoulder pain) but recently that has turned severe. It is to the point that just walking is a hardship_ exercising is out of the question and getting down on the floor to play with my granddaughter(2) and son(10) is completely out of the question. I have lost coordination sometimes feeling as if I have to actually concentrate on the process of walking as my body won't do it naturally. I am even waking at night in pain. I have an extremely high tolerance for pain and I don't whine about minor aches and pains. My family knows if I am complaining this is something serious. My most recent symptom has been the swelling feet ankles and hands. I have been up 30 mi,I am relatively young and have no desire to walk like an ancient old woman.I want my life back. I am seeing the Dr in just a few hours and I won't be taking actos again. This is not the medication for me.  My mother_ father and brother all take it without the extreme side effects that I have experienced. All have had some weight gain and muscle/joint pain but none to the extreme that walking is a chore and that breathing causes weight gain.  As for the people who think the weight gain is from twinkies and stuffing my face let me just say that is not the case.  I am eating far better now than I ever have and until the extreme pain was exercising regularly. I am being far more proactive than I was when I lost 50 lbs shortly before starting the actos. I am happy you didn't experience what I and several others have. That means you are lucky not that we are lazy pigs_ try a little compassion and understanding. Some day you might need it yourself.,F,43,6  months,8/31/2009,Actos

At my doctor's request I stayed on the drugs. That all passed gradually over the next day_ or two. Over the following weeks I developed a slightly bloated and extra-sensitive feeling which was easy to ignore. However_ impossible to ignore was ringing in my ears so loud it was keeping me awake. After stopping both drugs at the same time the ringing mostly subsided and the bloated/sensitive feeling was completley gone after another 2 or 3 weeks.,Stopping both drugs after 3 weeks to my doctor's dismay_ I'm not sure if the Actos helped with blood sugars because it was my first line drug while I was making major diet and excercise changes.

159, 1, Diabetes II,It is difficult to list all the side effects I have been suffering as some things could be related to other causes/drugs. I have been taking Actos for about 2 years now and last year when I went to visit my daughter and flew up north I experienced leg swelling for the first time in my entire life. Never has ANYTHING swollen on me unless I had a direct injury form a blow or fall. And until I came home and the swelling did not go away_ I thought it could just be from the flying_ I then began to notice that my breathing was labored when I would exert myself. And I don't mean extreme exertion either_ I mean just bringing a bag in from the store!! Then I began to notice other things. Like a lack of energy_ extreme tiredness_ a rattle in my throat/chest_ and feeling like my stomach was going to explode if I bent to put on shoes. I even had to buy velcro sneaks because I couldn't tie reg ones anymore!!! I attributed my weight gain to quitting smoking 2years ago but I have to say it was way to,I was also taking Crestor and a generic Statin drug for cholestrol lowering and so some symptoms I attributed to them. I stopped them by the way as the side effects were life threatening. But the lethargy_ weight gain_swelling_ difficulty breathing etc. has me stumped. I think I am going to stop the Actos for a while and see if I see any changes in those effects and if so_ I will go to the Doc and say_ sorry let's try somthing else. If I have to go on full insulin_ so be it. But continuing this med may not be the right thing for me. As for those of you that insist_ all of us complaining about this med think we are all just lazy slobs that pig out on food all the time and that is our problem? Where did you get your medical degree? and how dare you assume you know me! I stick to my diet faithfully and had a great A1c in Feb of 5.9 so I know I am eating correctly.

165, 3, ,A1C was at 8.4 on metformin (1500 mg) and glyburide (5 mg) when doctor added 15 mg Actos to the mix. Weight was 225. Within 6 months I gained 10 pounds and could not determine why. A1C went to 10.0_ so doctor put me on 20 units of insulin nightly.,I did not have any of the muscle aches_ but I was at a loss as to why the weight gain - I have been at 225 for years. For the last three months on Actos_ I had also increased cardio activity considerably_ so I was expecting to lose weight_ not gain.Since adding the insulin_ going to diabetes education_ and monitoring carb portions_ I have dropped 7 lbs. A few low (for me) glucose readings have me concerned_ so I have unofficially laid off the Actos for a week. If the glucose levels stay where I want them_ I'm going to ditch the Actos entirely.  My biggest problem was for years I did not want to follow any rules.  Now that I am following the dietary guidelines and testing my blood_ I know I can get this to a much more manageable state.  I can't blame the Actos entirely for the weight gain_ but I do think it is the culprit.,M,41,6  months,5/28/2009,Actos
166, 1, Type 2 Diabetes,fibromyalgic type generalized muscle pain.  Was 160 lbs when I started Actos.  Gained 40 lbs. within 4 months.  No edema_ but experienced chronic bloating even after eating a small meal.  Was seen at emergency room twice for horrific stomach pain.  Went through two colonoscopies and two endoscopies_ and a nuclear test to find out if my stomach was empting too slowly.  I was always tired to the point of lethargy.  On my worst days I stayed in bed flat on my back because that was the only way I could find any relief for the stomach bloating.  Yes_ it dropped my A1C from 8.9 to 6.1.  But I quit Actos_ restarted metformin and I got my life back.

169, 1, Type 2 Diabetes,Weight gain (28 lbs in 8 weeks). Trouble breathing_panic attacks_skin blisters_ hip pain_ sinus infections_ nose bleeds_ anxiety.,I started taking Actos because my insurance company would no longer pay for my Avandia and told me I had to switch to Actos.  Within days_ I developed a sinus infection in conjunction with nose bleeds. Then within 2 weeks I started having trouble taking a deep breath.  It was like my lungs could not expand. This began causing me severe anxiety_ as I felt like I was slowly suffocating to death.  As it got worse I began experiencing panic attacks every time I would try to go to bed_ because when I was in a prone position I could not breathe.  It got so bad that I was afraid to have anybody near my face for fear they would take my breath away from me.  It caused my poor wife to think that I didn't find her attractive any more because I wouldn't kiss her.  When I finally fessed up as to what was going on_ she went on line and found this website and discovered that all of the things I was experiencing had been experienced by other people who had taken the Actos.  I quit taking the Actos and with in 2 days my symptoms began to disappear and by 4 days they were gone. Do not take this drug. THIS IS POISON!,M,55,8  weeks,5/11/2009Email,Actos
170, 5, metabolic disorder syndrome,Slight water retention when I eat way too much salt.,I have/had metabolic syndrome and mild to moderate insulin resistance.  I put on a lot of belly fat over the past 18-24 months going from a size 34 waist to a size 42 duing that time.  I asked my doctor to put me on Actos 15.  I have been taking 1 per day for about 5 weeks now.  I went from 225 pounds down to 217.  I lost 4.5 inches from my waist.  My waist looks much smaller even though I didn't lose all that much weight.  I went to the health dept. yesterday and they did a glucose fasting blood test (finger stick) and three hours after eating three cream sticks doughnuts my blood sugar level was 115.To be fair_ I have really watched my diet going on a low carb diet except for those cream sticks yeasterday.  I have also been exercising very hard at the gym  4-5 days a week.  I tried both diet and exercise together prior to ACTOS but I made very little progress then.  I also didn't seem to have much energy then and I always had a huge hunger when I got done exercising.  That is not the case now. I'm very satisfied with ACTOs but want to get off ACTOS as soon as I can and stick with the diet and exercise.,M,56,1  months,4/18/2009,Actos

I have been following a very low carbohydrate program for 4 weeks and have not dropped an ounce.  I have been taking glipizide and metformin for many years and my A1C was not as low as it needed to be so it was thought Actos would help.  Unfortunately_ that has not been the case.  I also have a family history of heart disease and realizing that Actos can cause congestive heart failure_ I could not figure out why a doctor would prescribe this medication to me. It makes no medical sense at all.  The quality of my life has been extremely unsatisfactory and I only hope that what damage Actos has done to my body can be reversed.,F,54,2  years,3/5/2009,Actos

To the person who commented below_ if you read the ProActive study_ Actos decreased to risk of heart attack and stroke. Byetta is helpful in losing weight because it makes you feel full so you stop eating... What a novel idea_ you quit stuffing you face and you actually lose weight?  Wow. Just better hope you don't develop pancreatitis.  The last patients who developed necrotizing and hemorrhagic pancreatitis from Byetta had a nearly 100% mortality rate. The whole name of the game is controlling your sugars. Wouldn't you rather gain 5lbs and not have a heart attack in 5-10 years.

Actos does a great job controlling your sugar_ but that doesn't mean you can start eating whatever you want.  I want to laugh at you people who say you've gained 50-100lbs because of the drug. Quit shoveling Twinkies_ 3 plates of pasta and a stick of butter into your mouths daily and you probably will stop ballooning. This comment section just gives obese people something other to blame their obesity on besides themselves. Honestly_ how did 99% of you become diabetic anyway???,And Actos doesn't cause heart attacks. I've done a ton of research in the area. Avandia causes heart attacks_ Actos actually decreases the risk of having one. Januvia is weight neutral_ and doesn't control your blood sugar (might as well take Tylenol). Byetta will make you lose weight_ but then you have an increased risk of pancreatitis.  Glimipiride_ glyburide_ glicizide can all lead to your beta cells burning out quicker and hypoglycemia. Actos is the best drug on the market to treat the disease we have_ pharmacologically speaking.

I couldn't even get out of a chair without being in tears because I hurt so bad. The doc thought my arthritis was flaring up and that I might have fibrmyalgia so he increased my Ibuprophen to 2400 mg per day and added pain pills for breakthroughs.  My chest started hurting more so I thought it was my esophogus because of all of the Ibuprophen.  When I couldn't breathe and my chest was pounding so hard that I could take my pulse without even touching myself_ I went back to the doc.  EKG was fine and am waiting on the stress test results.

Didn't start to feel these side effects until after being on actos 45mg about 9 mths_ probably because I'm also on metformin_ metoprolol_ lisinopril & hctz and was introduced to those drugs at about the same time and was dealing with the side effects from those as well (I was diagnosed in 11/06 as diabetic and hypertensive).  I 'adjusted' to the other drugs after 6 mths and have not felt too many side effects from them in the last year but started feeling more of the actos side effects by winter 2007.,My understanding of how actos works is that it helps your stem cells to make more fat cells to 'soak' up the extra glucose floating around in your blood after you have eaten-this helps to keeps your blood glucose (BG) levels within acceptable limits when you test your BG with a monitor.  Now_ this is just MY opinion_ not a medical fact_ but because you have those extra fat cells floating around in your body_ you also get increased appetite (the carb cravings)_ thus a vicious cycle emerges...you crave more food_ then actos responds by making more fat cells to soak up the extra glucose from the extra food_ thus producing even more craving for food_ etc_ etc_ etc.  You see my point...the other problem is that since actos is 'tying' up all of your stem cells' time into making more fat cells_ the stem cells don't have as much time to make more muscle cells to help keep your body toned_ so you start to feel more 'flabby' over time even if you do maintain a regular exercise routine.

Better control did occur with A1C levels well below 7.  I was trying to ignore the weight gain_ but finally I couldn't ignore it any longer as I was obese to begin with.

There is no reason why they can't find a CURE and stop beating around with symptoms only.  Too much money to be made?  And food companies are as much to blame by adding canola_ synthetic fats_ frutose and sugars to everything.  And while I'm at being ticked off_ I'm not fat_ so diabetes can strike anyone.  As soon as companies switched from coconut oil in the 50s to all this other nonsense oils_ diabetes took a leap in cases.
