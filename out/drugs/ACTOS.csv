1, 1, Type 2 diabetes,Gross weight gain_ constant tiredness_ swelling in ankles,I told my endocrinologist I am going off Actos and will never touch it again. It's horrible. It's banned in Europe although my doctor pooh-poohed that. I gained weight steadily_ a pound a month without relief_ even with lots of exercise and good diet. I already take glimeperide (about 3 mg per day average) and will go on Byetta if necessary. But after just three weeks off Actos_ I am starting to feel better_ have way more energy_ and am starting to slowly lose a little weight. I think I can get back to normal weight in a few months (faster if I go on Byetta). Actos is evil incarnate. How can gross weight gain possibly be good for anyone let alone a diabetic? My doctor could care less so now I do the research and tell him what I want to take.,M,67,18  months45mg 1X D,5/23/2016,Actos

59, 1, Type II Diabetes,Experienced horrible leg pain_ especially behind knees down the back of my lower legs.  Doctor had no answers for me.  Could hardly get up from seated position_ in and out of a car_ and in and out of the shower.  Once coming to a standing position from being seated_ I would have to stand for up to 30 sec. before I could walk.  The first 5 min. of walking was very uncoordinated and then finally I could walk normally.  So grateful to come across this site to see that others have experienced the same side effects.,This has been so frustrating.  I thought I was getting ovarian cancer with all the bloating or MS with the leg issues.  Stopped the drug 6 days ago and have seen some relief.  Have been able to get up from a seated position and start to walk without having to wait several seconds. Still a bit uncoordinated for the first few steps. Weight has increased while on this drug so I am hoping that I will have good results from having stopped the medication.  Since I started with the bad pain back in February of 2010_ and never attributed it to this drug_ I am hoping it has not caused irreparable damage.  I see that others have had good results after stopping Actos so that was very encouraging to read.  I didn't see my symptoms listed as common side effects with Actos so I never suspected the drug as the cause of my problems.,F,61,2  years45 mg 1X D,7/31/2011Email,Actos
