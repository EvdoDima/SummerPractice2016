0, 1, pneumonia,Severe non-stop vomiting after taking1 pill,Son became severely dehydrated after hours of non-stop vomiting and was admitted to PICU with kidney failure and extremely low blood pressure.  Veins would not accept IV_ had to have IV through groin.  Three day stay in PICU.  Doctors thought this was sepsis due to pneumonia_ would not consider might be a reaction to Cefzil.  They convinced me that it was not the medication.  A year later he was prescribed the same drug for a sinus infection.  After 1 pill the vomiting began again luckily this time we knew what to do and immediately rushed him to ER and began treatment.,M,14,1  days 2X D,5/19/2016,Cefzil

13, 1, respiratory infection,Severe hives after day 7 on the med.hives from head to toes eyes lips with difficulty to swallow. Almost end up at ER. my doctor gave me total of 3 shots of adrenalin within 48 hours to control the hives. it has been 4 days since my last dos of CEFZIL_ i still have hives but it is more manageable at this point,,F,53,14  days500mg 2X D,10/22/2014,Cefzil
14, 1, sinus infection and gastroentritis,"I took cefzil on two occasions_ the first one sent me to the ER uncontrollable vomiting; I have never been in that much pain and they gave me Benadryl by IV and Rocephen and said I had gastroenteritis....so I take myself off of all meds and go on a good probiotic with recommendations from a great health food store here where I live_ as they commented how much weight I lost and I looked_ and felt like I was dieing_ as I was vomiting and having diarrhea every day with high frequency.  So I ignored all docs and did the probiotic....it saved my life.  All symptoms went away.  I was on several antibiotics before this and did not know it was specifically cefzil causing the ""reactions"".  I was prescribed cefzil again for sinus/throat issues and took one dose of 500mg....with a probiotic.  I stayed up all night vomiting uncontrolably and had the most horrible case of diarrhea_ then I realized_ it was the cefzil all along that was causing everything.  My best advice:  don't take it_ the side effects are not worth it_ there are other drugs out there to get the job done without completely making you horrifically sick.  The docs missed the diagnosis at the ER...I was having an allergic reaction to cefzil_ not gastroenteritis.  If you ever start having symptoms that are difficult to deal with when taking a medication don't weather through it...discontinue it and ask your doc for something else.  Both situations have taught me to never take this drug again.  Hope this helps someo",,F,40,1  days500mg,10/17/2014,Cefzil

41, 1, sinus infection,Within the first few days of taking the medication I had some small bumps (what I now know were hives) on my lower scalp. I did not realize that I was having a small allergic reaction to the medicine when I noticed these so I continued taking cefzil. I had skipped a few doses by accident and when I finished taking the medicine my lip had a huge hive on it and so did my right arm. I took my prescribed allegra and they went away within a few hours. Later that night it returned and I had hives all over my body. Less than a day and a half later the hives merged into huge patches covering my whole back_ stomach_ chest and neck. They also covered my whole scalp and spots on my face. My eyes became extremely puffy and then my lips became so swollen they were numb. The doc recommended benadryl and allegra. I took it and a few days later the hives subsided but my hands and feet became swollen and itchy which later subsided.,If you feel anything unusual happening when you take this medicine stop taking it IMMEDIATELY.
