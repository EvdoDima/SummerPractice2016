0, 2, High blood pressure,"After about a week on this_ I developed an itchy throat which turned into a dry hacking cough.  It was as though I was trying to get something out of my lungs but couldn't.  This only got worse the longer I was on it.  I also had trouble breathing and was very short of breath.  I developed bad gas and stomach upset after about two weeks on it and had to use the restroom at odd times of the day (not my ""normal"" time).",I knew my blood pressure was high before going in to the doctor.  It was 171/110.  I get white coat syndrome BAD so I knew this was part of it.  After being on this for 30 days my BP only went down to 148/97.  I took this at night before bed and would wake up with a hangover type feeling which seemed to be getting worse as time went on.  I certainly did not feel like myself.  I have been off of this medication two days now and I am still coughing and gagging on what seems to be phlegm.  Hoping that this goes away soon_ can't take much more coughing and stomach upset.,M,52,30  days5 MG 1X D,12/12/2015Email,Vasotec
1, 2, CHF/Hypertension,1) Dry hacking night cough2) Constant clearing of throat(mucus production)3) Ineffective - required second anti-hypertensive,"Enalapril/Vasotec comes with a nasty_ dry night cough even plain water alone_ cannot suppress. The ONLY remedy_ is a Guaifanesin-based expectorant. If you are_ or were a former smoker - forget about this drug. You will be constantly clearing your throat_ every 2-5 minutes. And_ I don't mean by a subtle_ ""ahem"" either. It's more like a loud_ forceful_ ""grrrrr!"" This annoying ""habit"" is simply not acceptable in public engagements like Seminars_ Movies or Libraries. My BP was not lowered enough and required an additional medication(Norvasc) to get my levels down. Get a scrip for Losartan HCT instead!",M,51,6  years10MG 1X D,6/15/2015Email,Vasotec

3, 4, Enalapril,Dizzy. After the first couple of days when my body was adjusting to the medication all side effects went away but after 6 weeks_ I woke up one morning and was dizzy. It did not go away and so I went to see my Dr. He prescribe some antibiotics and then something else thinking it was just an inner ear infection but it did not go away. Went for MRI and it came back clean (thank God!!). After that_ my Dr. was willing to believe me that it was the Enalapril and it was not going to go away so we changed to 25mg of Losartan. TBD on how this goes.,Let me start by saying that I am one of those that somehow got bad genes when it comes to BP. I am not overweight_ 148 pounds_ and run 30-40 miles a week. Eating right does not help my BP either. I was actually taking 10mg in the morning and 5mg at night but there was no way to enter this. The Enalapril controlled my BP great!! Without medicine_ I am 150/100 person and it took me to 118/72 or lower. I really wish I had not developed the dizziness b/c this medicine was doing really well for me. I would recommend it for sure. Also_ we have to keep in mind that the majority of people who rate the medicine on the web are the people who are having side effects. There are hundreds of people that experience no side effects but when you do experience them_ your doctor should be understanding!!,M,39,10  weeks15 mg 1X D,2/17/2012Email,Vasotec
4, 1, High Blood Pressure (Hypertension),I was on 10mg once a day of Enalapril for half a year. Then my doctor upped it to 10mg TWICE a day. I had no problems. BUT_ when it was upped to >> 20mg ,If you do take it_ I would be aware that a higher dose INCREASES the likelihood of more side effects_ so be careful.,M,32,1  years20 2X D,3/19/2011,Vasotec

6, 1, Hypertension,Intolerable_ life disrupting dry cough somewhat like a post nasal drip cough but nonproductive. A very strange sensation in the back of my throat on the right side would bring on the cough - almost like I was going to vomit. A few sneezes would also accompay the coughing fits. I did not learn that this was a possible side effect of Vasotec until the third Rx refill when they finally put that informative sticker on the container! It was NEVER mentioned by my perscribing Dr.,I just missed two doses while on vacation and the coughing has stopped entirely! Right now my blood pressure is not being treated_ but I will speak to my Dr. on my next appointment date.,M,55,9  months5 MG 1X D,2/9/2010Email,Vasotec

11, 2, high blood pressure,I developed Erythema Multiforme after taking Vasotec for several years. It continually got worse starting as a cold sore on lip and spreading to face_ neck_ arms_ hands_ then knees and back. Very scary to look at and took 3 weeks to completely go away until it started all over again!,It took 3 doctors (allergist_ dermitologist_ and internal medicine dr.) to finally pinpoint that the EM trigger was enalapril (Vasotec). I'm now off of it now and EM is under control.,F,51, ,5/3/2008,Vasotec

14, 2, Hypertension,I took it the first time for 2 weeks and I felt slower.  Later on I had trouble breathing_ especially after climbing steps.  I also developed pains in my legs.  Went off it and tried it a second time.  My chest seized up after one dose and I had to quit.,It lowered my blood pressure_ but not being able breathing is impossible.,F,40,1  days,11/15/2007,Vasotec

16, 2, high blood pressure,I've been taking 5 mg of Enaparil for over 2 months and have a terrible_ dry_ barking cough that keeps me up most the night and I'm exhausted.  The cough seems better during the day_ but that could be because I take the med at night and perhaps it's worn off by late morning.  It did reduce my BP_ now at 120/77_ but what good is that if you're a walking Zombie during the day? Prior to taking Enaparil I took Atenonol--which made me dizzy_ lethargic_ tired and consequently depressed.  I just called the doc and he suggested I cut my dose of Enaparil in half.  Anyway to reduce high BP without these meds????,,F,59,10  weeks,9/11/2007,Vasotec
17, 3, Hypertension,Abdominal swelling and pain.,I was proscribed 5mg of Norvasc and 15mg of Vasotec per day.  The Vasotec at that dosage caused severe abdominal swelling.  I couldn't button my pants.  Any abdominal pressure caused pain.  Symptoms went away within 3 days after I stopped taking it.  I found I can tolerate 5mg per day with no symtoms and believe it helps me even at that low dosage.,M,46,10  months,4/26/2007Email,Vasotec

After starting vasotec experienced slight change (for the worse) in erectile hardness and response to things that usually triggered erections.,High blood pressure used to made me irritable_ nervous and caused insomnia.  I know the Drs say this cannot be but I know my body and KNOW this for a fact.  Lower blood pressure since vasotec changed m personality for the better and my quality of life improved.
