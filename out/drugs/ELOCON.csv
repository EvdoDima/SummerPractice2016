0, 1, Eczema and Mystery dermatitis,Full blown topical steroid addiction_ progressively worsening mystery rash that presented as red spots over most of body surface.-insomnia-extreme pain-dysfunctional skin-oozing skin-extreme daily skin shedding-suicidal thoughts-worsening rash-isolation and embarrassment-anxiety-loss of job-extreme mental distress,"This drug is dangerous if you use it for more than one week(doctor never told me that). I used it for a few months because it was the only thing that helped my rash. After learning about topical steroid addiction I now know that the rash was kicked off by OTC hydrocortisone and then worsened x10 when I started using this. In essence it caused me a horrible iatrogenic skin condition know as ""topical steroid withdrawal"" and it's a million times worse than the eczema I was trying to manage. NEVER use this drug for rashes! It has caused me to become essentially disabled for the next two years and I am in horrible pain every day. I will never trust a doctor again because of this.",M,26,5  months0.1% 1X D,4/8/2016,Elocon

2, 1, Eczema,Difficult to identify whether the problems I encountered were associated with the Elocon or the underlying condition.,The systemic addiction problems associated with this drug are not publicised. The withdrawal process is HORRIFIC. Read itsan.org if you are using it or thinking of doing so for more detail.,F,52,10  years 1X D,7/4/2012,Elocon
3, 1, eczema,I developed an itchy stinging rash that would keep me awake a night_ and experieced upsetting mood changes. The lack of sleep had a unfortunate effect on my ability to do my job.,I would never use this again,F,43,1  weeks 1X D,7/12/2011Email,Elocon
4, 5, Psoriasis,none,Used sparingly and correctly Elocon is wonderful for reducing redness and swelling associated with psoriasis. It isn't a 'cure'_ more a management tool to be used with other medications such as Daivonex.,M,30,5  years,9/12/2008,Elocon
5, 1, tick eczema,pustules_ hives_ rash spread all over my body_ increased and  debilitating itching leading to bleeding_ small haemorrhages under skin due to skin thinning .....,Neither my dermatologist or pharmacist warned me about the side effects - I had to research myself after the rash got worse and hadn't cleared up after 6 months & 4 visits to the dermatologist. I could have stopped it 6 mths ago had the doctor realised the pustules were a side-effect - instead he sent me for pathology of the pus filled lesions. Then he was going to do a biopsy of a lesion on my back. All these have cleared up since I stopped using elocon. The side-effects can be debilitating. Just be warned & informed!,F,54,6  months,7/18/2008Email,Elocon
6, 5, eczema,not seen yet_ other than knowing it is a steriod which might have bad side effect if use for long time.,Elocon is very effective in clearing away my two-year-old son's eczema around his lips and knee/wrist creases. Normally the flare-up will go away in a day or two. The skin will be smooth for a few days before next round coming back. So i would classify it as temporary relief for eczema. We are still looking for permanent cure.,M,40,12  months,4/30/2008,Elocon
7, 1, Rash on fingers,I developed Perioral Dermatitis as a direct result from using Elocon.,I would NEVER recommend using Elocon for anything!  Elocon has many nasty side effects_ one of which is Perioral Dermatitis.,F,49,1  months,3/19/2008Email,Elocon
8, 5, Allergic Rashes,None.,It is a life saver. I have unexplained itchy rashes that break out and this takes care of them right away!,F,42,10  years,12/27/2007,Elocon
9, 4, contact dermatitis,skin changes_ thinning of the skin_ darkened areas,I have used Elocon for over 9 years (since i was a child). I regret that I didn't use it with much caution as would be expected with steroids as i didn't understand the implications but overall i have had good control with it. It hasn't cured my dermatitis though. I dont know how much longer i will need to use it but i am concerned about the long term side effects i.e. the amount of steroids entering my bloodstream causing complications such as diabetes mellitus.,F,23,9  years,10/3/2007,Elocon
10, 5, eczema,,This is the best steroid medication I've used and I have had eczema  since I was born. It stops the break outs so they don't spread and it's not a heavy duty steroid so you can use it on your face. I have not had one negative side effect with it_ not even burning on open cuts.,F,27,6  years,2/6/2007Email,Elocon
11, 4, Eczema,Burning sensation at site of application.,I use it for my son when his eczema flares up.  It gets rid of any flare-up within a day or two.  My son complains that it burns_ but I notice that it only burns in areas that he's scratched_ not in areas that he hasn't.  I only use it when necessary_ and only in affected areas.  Elocon keeps his eczema under control for weeks in certain areas and months in others_ and it works almost right away.  It has never taken more than twice a day for two days for the Elocon to make the rash go away.  My son has had eczema since he was a couple of weeks old_ so we've tried everything... Elocon is the best!!!  I even use it around his mouth_ he used to break out there the worst... but he hasn't had a flare up there since last summer!,M,3,1.5  years,4/25/2006,Elocon
12, 5, Excema all over,Got acne like pimples all over which contained pus.  However_ it cleared up the excema in 3 days_ and then had to take anti-biotics to clear up spots!,It's great for a quick fix_ and I have tried everything!,F,32,4  days,2/28/2006,Elocon
13, 5, Eczema,None.,This is the best cream to stop eczema break outs. I've had eczema since I was born and this is the only thing that really works.,F,26,8  years,2/18/2006,Elocon
