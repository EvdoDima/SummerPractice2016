0, 5, Anxiety,Very mild sleepiness ... no other side effects what so ever.  After multiple visits to the ER _ ekg's_ blood work and a ct scan of heart and lungs.  My primary care physician determined my condition was anxiety... finally prescribed Serax and after only one pill I finally feel normal again. The past two weeks has been a living nightmare and thank to Serax I feel like I have my life back! This medicine is amazing!,,F,42,1  days10mg,5/29/2013Email,Serax
1, 3, insomnia,good sleep for about 3 to 4 days then the insomnia got worse and couldn't sleep even with taking 30mg before bedtime.,I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had surgery. I was looking up the web for answers for the cause of this cancer since there is no cancer history in my family. Serax (oxazepam) is a carcinogen and is very hard on the liver. It has caused cancer in mice (lab tests). My family doctor does not believe Serax does but my friend who is a pharmacist had recommended that it can be habit forming and that maximum 3 times per week should be maximum for sleeping and yes it is carcinogenic (meaning that it can cause cancer).,F,50,3  years,1/31/2010,Serax
2, 1, Tinnitus_ inability to sleep,Following day results in unbearable depression.,"Occasional Ativan for the condition is okay.  This ""pam"" works great as a sleeping pill_ but the following day's cost in mental negativity isn't worth it.  There's got to be something better.",M,60,999  days,6/2/2009,Serax

5, 1, anxiety,very very many. I got dependent on 30mg/day for two years and developed alot of symptoms without lower the dose. the worst were depersonalization derealisation_ panic attacks_ very severe anxiety. I was only leaving my bed to eat and go to the toilet for over a month and it took a year(in hell) from the moment i started taper to the time i could return to work at part time. Now i so much better.,Dont use benzo regulary! It is not worth the risk! The first time i was on them i could quit without problems_ the second time the problems came after about a year but it took another 6 months for someone to realise that it was the drugs that made me worse! in my opinion this drugs shall only be used in very acute situations and never for longer time than a coulple of weeks!,M,27,2  years,9/24/2006,Serax
6, 5, Sudden anxiety attacks since child.,Mild tiredness for first few weeks.,Has stopped anxiety attacks almost completely. They come back still if I quit taking the medication.  Obviously there is a withdrawl period for a week or two after stopping.  Have tried many other medications and none have worked_ so I return to Serax.  No change in effectiveness after many years.  I take 30 mg 4 times a day. Same dose for 36 years.,M,67,36  years,5/31/2006Email,Serax
7, 3, sleepnesses,general moodiness_ very grouchy; stopped when I stopped taking it.incontenence; also stopped when i stopped taking serax.very diminished libido; also stopped when I quit taking the drug,did help me sleep better. 30mg nightly as needed. I took it about 4-5 nights a week for about 2 months. I don't feel its worth the side effects.,F,51,2  months,2/16/2006,Serax
8, 4, Anxiety,relaxed me_no side affects that hurt me that i know of,,F,41,1  days,1/22/2006,Serax
9, 4, Anxiety,dizziness_ vertigo_ stomach pains,My anxiety has decrease since I started taking this. Use to take 15mg daily and 45mg at night. Now I only take it (25mg)when needed or when my other sleeping meds (rivotril & desyrel) aren't enough to help me sleep.,F,20,1  years,10/15/2005,Serax
10, 4, anxiety over husband's Alzheimer's,none_ other than slight drowsiness at times.,I wasn't told it might be habit forming until I had been taking two pills per day for about a year.  I stopped cold turkey with no problems.  Now I only take it as needed_ but to my surprise_ I found it helps my Restless Legs problem.  When I feel it coming on_ I take a Serax and a Flexerel and I go to sleep and the problem ends.  I only take one during the day if I feel myself becoming anxious_ and it helps me to stay calm.,F,67,2  days,8/22/2005,Serax
11, 4, sleep aid,I do seem to have headaches the day after I take a serax.  Not sure if it is related to serax tho.,I try to only take them 3 times a week because of the addiction possibility.  I take one 15 mg capsule. They help me to get a great night's sleep.,F,52,4  years,5/17/2005,Serax
12, 1, Stress_ sleep aid,none,this stuff is weak and worthless.,M,37,7  days,12/9/2004,Serax
13, 5, Help me sleep.,none.,I take 3 15mg capsules before bedtime to sleep. My sleep disturbance is caused by Effexor. Serax works. I've stopped the drug abruptly for over a week with no side effects.,M,55,5  years,8/13/2004,Serax
14, 3, To sleep,Marginal effectiveness.I have Migraines and Prostate problems (BPH and difficulty urinating) and I do NOT know if Serax has been a contributing factor as I found out only today_ looking for info on the medication.,I have decided to seek broader information on the product as I feel it is not meeting my objectives; sleeping and a normal sleeping pattern. (I sleep days and cannot sleep nights).Also_ I believe that I am encountering a tolerance problem_ requiring more to obtain the previous effect.Also_ I am deeply concerned about developing a dependence_ both physical and psychological. I tried to wean myself from the medication and found sleep very difficult to impossible. I maintained a 'no Serax' regime for nearly a month. Things did not improve. If anything_ they worsened.,M,67,4  years,7/23/2004Email,Serax
