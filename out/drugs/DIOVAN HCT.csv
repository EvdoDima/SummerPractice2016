Instead of changing it_ she suggests adding something else_ which will undoubtedly have more side effects - no way. As time goes on_ side effects seem to become more extreme and more of them. Guess I should have changed my Dr. long before now. Would like someone to heal me instead of causing new problems with bad drugs. Her response is that most people tolerate it well. One of the known side effects is elevated blood sugar but she denies that - says it is because of my weight gain.

Very disappointing given that Diovan is quite expensive.,"I'm wondering if the generic ""equivalent""  made by Ohm Labs is actually a different chemistry which is suddenly causing the severe headaches.

20, 2, HBP,I began taking Diovan in 2006 after going into the office with an elevated reading. First of all_ I hate it when the med asst takes your b/p after walking in_ checking in_ weighing_ and as soon as you sit gown_ they call you back to the exam room. It was also days after the unexpected death of my mother. 140's/90's. After reading the comments from others_ I have several. Thinning hair_ hair loss_ hip pain_ heart palpations_ achy joints_ and  at times lightheadedness. I have an autoimmune disorder and experience chronic pain. So_ naturally_ I am very quick to blame everything on that. I asked for a change in meds after recent loss of job/insurance because the cost is over $300/mo. My MD prescribed Hyzaar.

Had three migraines while taking Diovan.,My doctor upped my dosage to 160 MG and that was just ridiculous because it was in the 130/70-80 range.  I felt much worse and could hardly walk.

37, 3, HBP,I'm so glad I found this site.  I have been on Diovan HCT for a little over a year now and the first 6 months were fine.  However_ after the first 6 months_ I began to have severe headaches that lasted all day long.  No type of headache medication would stop the pain. I also began to feel very tired and dizzy. The dizziness_ fatigue_ and headaches would start about an hour after taking Diovan in the mornings and lasted all day. I began taking naps everyday after work and would still go to bed rather early at night.  I just didn't feel like myself anymore.  I stopped exercising and going to visit friends because I was too tired to leave my house.  Today is the first day that I began to think that the Diovan may be causing these symptoms.

I went through the cold turkey_ I mean bad cold turkey and thought I would die but it was worth going through it to get this demon out of me.,In the last few weeks that i threw the diovan into the bin_ I have better skin_ less swelling_ I can walk_ I can breathe much better and I am no longer a zombie. It was not easy and I am only eating lettuce and salads to cleanse my body_ but I would do anything to get this out of me. I am taking Potassium supplements_ chromium_ multi vit_ Q10 and I will never go back to any medicine ever again in my life.

53, 3, blood pressure,Worked great for my blood pressure (none other had) with almost no side effects until recently.  About a month ago my feet started swelling - not bad - but some.  Then I noticed something else -that since I am retired I wear flip flops lots and walk  outdoors lots.  My feet were becoming brown around my toes and tops of the feet.  I would normally think this is just tanning except I am extremely fair skinned - never tanned in my life!  Have developed also really itchy skin.  Hate to say anything as it has worked for my BP - but will have to it seems.

I get the occasional muscle pains - especially at night but overall I feel much better.  I had to get the dosage adjusted several times - including the HCT part.  Weight has always been a challenge even before taking Diocan - but I am only about 20 lbs over weight.

Felt compression in spine and joints when exercising which made me feel and act lethargic. Weight gain (10% of body weight),Diovan HCT did lower my blood pressure in the past but I recently tried Diovan (half dosage without the HydroChlorothiazide) for a few days and found similar effects.

It's best to find another medication that would satisfy the same function without the horrible side effects.  For me I went back to 10mg norvasc plus 12.5mg of triamterine_ which worked just fine to control my blood pressure.  I'm now augmenting the medication routine with short walks in the morning and in the afternoon.  I'm now beginning to feel better after I had changed my medication 3 days ago.  The lightheadedness and all of the other bad sideeffects are beginning to subside after 3 days.  It may take a few more days before all of the bad sideeffects of the diovan is completely wiped out of my system.  All I can say is that each passing day I'm feeling a little better. Thanks to everyone who submitted the sideeffects of this medication.  It has helped me understand not to completely put your entire trust on your doctor and pharmacist.

63, 2, high blood pressure,This is the first medicine that I have been on for high blood pressure.  Since taking it_ I have steadily gained weight_ even though I've been dieting and reducing salt intake.  I have had constant itchy skin_ severe joint pains_ headaches_ and lack of sex drive.  I thought it was age related.  After reading other comments_ I think it might be these meds.  I've mentioned it to my doctor_ but she is asking me to wait a couple of more weeks to see if my blood pressure improves.  (It has gone down_ but not to where it should be.)  I can honestly say that I have not had a feeling of wellness since taking this medicine_ and I do feel worse than before finding out I had high blood pressure.  I feel like I have arthritis_ or something.  Now I need to address more of these symptoms with my doctor.

My PCP put me on lotrel 10/20. After being on the lotrel for less than a week_ I'm ready to go back to the Diovan - I'll figure out a way to pay for it.  For me this drug works great.

Developed a constant cramp below heart and lung/diaphragm region. I Could not walk up more than 2 flights of stairs w/o being winded completely. Sleepy state of being within an hour of taking Diovan HCT. I never felt in a well state. I will say my BP was down to never realized numbers. But the margins were not worth the constant ill state of being.,I have been off the Diovan HCT for 3.7 months now. The negative symptoms I described have now gone. I have been given a script for Triam/HCTZ 37.5-25 and have had incredible success. My Doctor did not question or hesitate to remove me from Diovan HCT. The doctor was not a big fan of it either. From what I understand_ the drug company campaigned heavily to urge health insurers to push the product in lieu of tier one drugs_ touting a lower cost. The drug I am now on is only $10.00(ten) for a 90 day supply. Understand everyone has a different situation medically.

70, 4, High blood pressure,Diarreha_ pain in legs while sleeping_ occasional dizziness and shortness of breath (only when drinking carbonated! Caffeinated soda),I take Diovan HCT 320-25 along with Atenolol 50mg and have been for almost 2 years. The most persistant side effects I have had are diarreha pain in my legs while sleeping and cold extremeties. There have been times when I have been tempted to ask my Dr. to change meds but I have learned to deal with most of the effects. I always take the meds at least 2 hours before I eat and that has cleared up my intestinal distress. I dress warm or have warm clothes available year round. There isn't anything I can do about the pain in my legs but I suspect that will go away eventually. When I first started on Diovan I was dizzy_ depressed and confused. After a couple of months that all went away. I still may ask my Dr. To look into another medicine but Diovan has gotten my BP problem under control. I still live the same lifestyle I did before which includes: gardening_ hiking_ canoeing_ fishing_ riding my 4 wheeler etc...  I think that anyone that has severe reactions such as hairloss_ severe skin disorders_ shortness of breath or chest pain should get right back to the Dr. and get off of Diovan. Anyone that has minor discomforts associated with taking Diovan should give it a chance and see if it works for you.

Weight gain (about 10 pounds per year)_ hair loss (thinning)and mild Erectile Dysfunction symptoms_ dry skin on outside of calves caused severe itching and scratching. I could draw blood through the excess itching and scratching.  Tried everything...Best help was lotrimin over the counter at any drug store and change socks couple times a day.  It takes about 2 to 3 weeks but dryness will be helped and the itching stopped for the most part.,Changed lifestyle... Worked out with light weights 2 to 3 times per week and walked or did stretches and aerobics the other days of the week.  Stayed out of the mid day sun.  Went on diet and lost 50 pounds.  Cholestrol dropped to 136_ BP dropped to avg of 100/62 with 63 beats per minute average.  Doctor took me off of Diovan HCT_ increased from low dose aspirin to 162.5 mg.  Blood pressure is now staying at around 110/66 with 65 beats per minute average seated. All side effects with the exception of the hair loss are completely gone.  Although my hair has gotten just a little darker and I think it's a little thicker but don't really care at this point. Have no intention of ever going back on Diovan HCT.   I quit without any problems.  After about 3 weeks I really started to feel great...better than I had in years.

Have had to be on pain medication for it because I cannot tolerate the pain if I don't have something to take the edge off.  Have not been able to walk like I was doing - hurts too much.  Have not been able to enjoy my spring and summer because of this medication! Did not have knee pain before this medication_ started 4-5 months after beginning it. Took myself off of it for 1 week and was starting to feel some relief - went to see doctor - she puts me on a new medication.  I just learned it has Diovan in it_ so she put me back on it.  I feel betrayed.  I am so tired of doctor's playing God with my health and life!  They do not always know what is best for me - they have proven that time after time.,Former doctor tells me there are no such side effects from this medication_ scolded me for going online for information and tells me that I should read only information given to me with the drug samples or from my pharmacist.  The Mayo Clinic site I searched states this drug has a side effect of pain in joints_ aching_ swelling_ redness_ stiffness_ and muscle aches/cramps_ even though it is a less common one.  Why would the Mayo Clinic site list it if it were not so?  New physician I went to see did x-rays - came back with very mild arthritis and states it's not the reason for the severe pain I am having.  This med might work for some people_ but it is not working for me. I wouldn't advise this medication for anyone - it is not worth what I have been through.  I remain hopeful I will improve once I have been off of it for a while.  I just wish doctor's would listen to their patient's and not make them feel they have no idea what they are talking about.

Three subsequent series of lab results over 3 months showed a continuing decline in kidney function to a GFR of 47 ( Stage 3 kindey failure) and a lowering of BP to 100/68.  Went to a Nephrologist and_ after extensive testing_ he identified the Diovan HCT 160 as the culprit.  He took me off the Diovan and monitored my BP over a 30 day period and my BP returned to normal range 119/74 without any BP medication.  My kidney function has also returned to a normal range for my age.,M,59,3  years160 1X D,6/19/2010,Diovan hct

I would sugest that every person who experiences sun sensitivity and rashes go to a dermatologist regularly. I always had checkups since the age of 25 so was well aware of my body. My skin cancer did not look like anything doctors  had seen it looked non malignant.  sometimes cancer can be that rash that wont go away. If your on diovan get a yearly skin check and know your skin. I had mohs surgery on my nose I got lucky it is a very small spot caught early. I may have had it all along but I'm 100% sure diovan helped speed up the cancer process. Wear sunscreen at all times when taking diovan and reapply it if your a sun person you need to change your lifestyle while taking this drug. They don't advertise that diovan can cause skin cancer due to the sun sensitivity it causes.,M,45,5  years160 1X D,6/15/2010Email,Diovan hct

I have been looking for a solution to my chronic pain for years.  it has recently escalated to dehabilitating and just figured out it coincides with the upping of my bp medicine. Talking to my doc this morning to get off and see if my pain goes away.  it's not all in your head and can be dehabilitating and depressing when no one can tell you whats causing the pain.  I have been diagnosed with arthritis_ fibromyalgia_ depression and I don't remember what else...maybe its all because of the side effects of this drug????

Thirsty sometimes and dry itchy skin and have to use lotion now. After taking in morning for the first couple of hrs feel dizzy and heart palpitates than feel ok. Every one of my bones and joints hurt especially at the end of the day. I was told it was all in my mind. Hmmmm Was fine before taking. It did bring blood pressure to normal tho but with pain elsewhere. Wondering if its worth it. And no libido which stinks unless you are to old to care. I am a young 50.,It may work for some people but be careful. No one believes me that since I have started taking it I feel awful. But I had no choice was allergic to the first one I took.

These symptoms increased in severity until I ended up in the hospital with extreme anxiety and palpitations. They did a blood workup and found that the diuretic component (HCTZ) had caused low potassium levels in my blood which caused PVC's. I am back on straight Diovan without the diuretic and am feeling fine. If you are on a non-potassium sparing diuretic get you blood potassium levels checked regularly!,,M,49,14  days160 1X D,4/8/2010,Diovan hct

After the second year on Diovan HCT_ I noticed some sensitivity to sunlight.  Over the past year_ I have had increased skin dryness_ especially around my eyes/eyelids and on legs and arms.  I am now covered with a severe_ itchy rash on both arms where they were exposed to the sun;  this is the second time I have experienced this during the past week.

I was on it for 8 years (for the last several I had only been on the 80 mg without the diuretic) since I was 24 and it kept my bp down to around an average of 120/70_ and then was switched to Labetalol around a month and a half ago because that is safer for pregnancy--but my bp crept up to 178/120 within a week and a half.  I went back on Diovan HCT 160/25 and within days was back to 118/80.  I'm hoping to be able to wean back off of the diuretic part of the drug over time because_ as someone else had mentioned_ messing with my electrolytes makes me feel a little drained at times.,M,32,8  years160/25 1X D,3/27/2010,Diovan hct

147, 2, High Blood Pressure,Back pain (tingling sensation in upper back); weight gain; severe cramps in legs and feet; elevated Creatine in recent blood test and aching joints.,"I am so happy for the feedback that others have provided. I have been miserable for the past two months and my system is totally in shambles.  I am now seeing a nephrologist because my Creatine levels have increased dramatically within one month.  My joints ache like they never have before and I couldn't believe that I felt so old and tired seemingly overnight. I am anemic and overweight. Now I have a reason to go back to my primary care physician to discuss a new medication.  I am shocked that I was not warned regarding the terrible side effects of this drug. I have been on a roller coaster ride first taking 80mg._ then 160mg. then 320mg with 25...all the while my blood pressure has been in the range of 110/73 and when I go to the doctor's office it is 150/80.  I have ALWAYS had ""white coat syndrome"" so I really wonder if I need the drug in the first place_ and so much of it.  I have put myself on a diet due to the weight gain experienced (more than 20lbs since taking the drug). Thanks again to all for sharing your issues with this drug as I now know that I am not imagining the problems that I have experienced.",F,62,2  months,11/4/2009,Diovan hct

I used to play golf 2-3 days a week. 2 yrs ago (aug 2006) Dr. changed from lisinopril to Diovan Hct 80. Started to have lower back pain and spasms. Only able to play golf once or twice more that year. Went to ER in Dec 2006 with blood pressure 218 over something. Dr. Increased dosage to 160. Back spasms got worse. Have played golf less than 5 or 6 times in 2 yrs. Went back to DR. last month. He wanted to up meds a little. I told him I am retired military and have Tri-care insurance and I pay $32 a month for Diovan. Found Atacand on the list at $3 per month. I asked him to change over to Atacand. Within 2 weeks back pain going away_ Hit golf balls last week and played over weekend no spasms. Feel less tired.

After 4 weeks BP still was a little on the high side_ so Dr. prescribed lexapro for my anxiety.  4 weeks later BP was down significantly.  Some days I am extremely tired.  But no other side effects.,Seems to be working.

I hope there are no Elderly people taking this deadly drug because so many of the symptoms are those one would expect their elderly parents to have by age. Diovan is taking away from the quality of life. I called my doctor last month and told unless I come into the office the medicine would not be changed even after telling them about the evils of this drug. So_ do I take this drug to keep from having a massive heart attach will affecting other organs or do I simply wing it? I have palpitations and headaches I can,Let's truly be sure our elderly isn't taking this drug because Diovan 160 mg will cause you to age quickly in every aspect of your life from socializing_ arts and crafts_ good vision and strong bones.

This feeling only got worse and I started feeling so very tired_ cold_and depressed. In April I hit a low! I was hit with severe fatigue and nausea. I had the dry heaves_ could hardly move_ dizziness_heart palpitations_ and heaviness of my arms and legs. I have always gone to the YMCA 3 times a week to excerise and had to stop that. I lost 19 pounds in 3 months and could not eat without getting very sick. I went to the doctor and he took me off the Diovan HCT but told me it would take 2 to 3 weeks to get this medicine out of my system. I am starting to feel better after 2 weeks but I still could care less if I eat anything and have to force myself to drink liquids.,I have been on blood pressure medicines for years_ I took Avalide and Norvasc but when I changed doctors the first of the year he put me on Diovan 160/12.5 (because it was cheaper) and Norvasc.

My symptoms during the initial 3 to 4 weeks of each medication included fatigue_ sleeplessness_ anxiety_ slight depression_ and loss of appetite. After this initial period_ however_ I felt like my normal self again. I would encourage people to eat well_ exercise_ get enough sleep_ and give yourself a month to adjust to the new medication.

About $30_000 worth of test to find nothing wrong except a minor atrial fibrillation that I think was caused by the DIOVAN .  Only on Diovan about 9 weeks_ as soon as I went off the Diovan my thumb healed and have not had it happen again.  The doctors say it was not the DIOVAN_ they think I had a blood clot but it's a funny things to me it happened every two weeks for four weeks to the same thumb and as soon as I went off the DIOVAN it stopped.  It is still tender at times_ I would never take it again.  Now they put me on coumandin for the atrial fibrillation that I have had only one episode that I know of_ the doctor says I can have atrial fibrillation without knowing it.

I took it along with a 20mg Paxil every night.  In October I decided to wean off the Paxil.  Took 5 months.  I was feeling ok but then stressful situations arose and instead of going back on Paxil decided to see cardiologist to check heart to start exercise regime.  Doctor decided to put me on Diovan HCT 160/12.5 since I pointed out mild edema in my right ankle. Almost immediately_ within the second day_ I was hit with severe fatigue_ restlessness_ sleeplessness_ cold feelings in my feet and panic. I starting taking the Paxil again and am going off the diuretic right away.  I am going back to the regular Diovan 160.  I was so grateful to find this site.  I was getting really scared and not knowing what was happening to me was adding to the panic.,I can assume that the spike in blood pressure came from being off the Paxil and not being able to cope with the stress.

This med seemed to increase the effects of FM greatly.,Like others_ it made me pee frequently. Told the doctors of the severe side effects_ one didn't care and said I needed the Diovan (end of conversation). The other gave me a beta blocker since he was fairly sure my high BP was due to my high adrenaline. Diovan barely dropped my BP_ small result (from 170/125 to 160/115). Beta blocker (Nadolol) dropped my BP to 115/75. The two together just knocked me out_ gained 30lbs in the last 3 months. The second doctor told me I can try going off Diovan as long as I check my BP every day. That starts today.Not everyone reacts the same way to these meds.

Starting about mid december_ I started having severe pain in my left leg and a resurgence of my low back pain.  Could there be a connection?

244, 1, High Blood Pressure,Palpitation/irregular heart beats,After my previous medication for high blood pressure (Benicar) that I was taking for 6 years stopped working I was given Diovan HCT (160/25) and Coreg CR in April 2007. The blood pressure came down somewhat but in September I started to experience irregular heart beats and palpitation. I asked my doctor to try something completely different and he switched me to inexpensive generic beta blocker_ ace inhibitor and diuretic. Within one week my pulse became normal_ my blood pressure and pulse dropped to completely normal.

292, 2, ,To start with_ I have been taking Diovan HCT 80/12.5mg for 2 weeks and this is the first BP medication that has lowered my BP to accetable levels: 118/80. However toward the end of the first week_ I noticed that I was having excessive joint pains especially in the knees and hips. I had knumbness in my fingers. Simple tasks like washing car tires became quite painful  when I had to stand up from a crotching position. I can't get up from a short drive in the car without some joint discomfort.  I also have lower back and flank pains_ which worry me because I think the pain is coming from my kidneys. I have also been having great discomfort and pains in my ascending colon_ accompanied with never ending flatulence and diarrhea.  I feel nauseous and weak whenever I exert myself_ especially in the sun. Simply said I am concerned about all these side effects.  I wonder if the benefit of lowereing my BP with Diovan HCT from 145/83 down to 118/80 is worth all this discomfort.,,M,51,2  weeks,6/16/2007Email,Diovan hct

319, 3, HBP,Though Diovan 80/12.5 did reduce my BP_ the side effects finally took their toll after 1.5 years. From tingling fingertips to fatigue to hair loss to ED_ I decided to try something new. It's interesting to note that doctors tend to not believe their patients when legimate complaints are expressed--just look at all of the entries regarding this one med. Drug company trials are for a fixed period of time and surely can't cover every possible long-term side effect so if you are a reasonable human being with a real concern perhaps they should take notice. To them_ if a side effect is not in the PDR it doesn't exist. And drug company reps have their influence as well.  At the end of the day_ it's your body.  Stand your ground if you want to try something else.,I do believe in ARB's. I'm now on Atacand.

343, 5, Blood pressure @155/85,Well_ after reading around_ i noticed that my insomia has come from some where.  Tired_ fatigued.  Wow_ talk about increased sweating in the arm pits.  I'm on over the counter max 20% alum.  Have to put it in all gernal areas of the arm pit.  Just drips like a mother.  I go to the bathroom better than i have ever have.  Easy going_ once a day_ timed exactly to the hour.  No decreased in libido_ actually noticed an increase.  Dropped my bp down to 130/65,Love it.  Sometime when i have a drink or two I can feel a funny feeling in my neck.  Also_ when i don't take it_ i notice that feeling in my neck is 10x.  I have tried different medicines since I guess I can be considered an anxiety risk.  I have tried anti anxiety/depressants and let me tell you_ no way do they work.  Just make you sit in a zone and not think about anything else.  This stuff worked wonders.  My doctor told me to take the diovan 60_ and nothing changed.  THen told me to try diovan 120 and nothing changed.  Then told me to try diovan 120 w/ hct to help w/ blood flow and wha la!  Drop in BP!  P.S.  I am an avid red wine drinker.  I also work for a rather large wine company. So yes_ red wine is in my diet.  So_ drink up!  help Support my salary!,M,24,2  months,5/18/2006Email,Diovan hct

Of course_ I am also walking regularly now at the doctor's suggestion and that may have helped in this area_ too.,It's interesting that many people have commented that Diovan HCT has made them feel fatigued. I've had the opposite reaction. Before taking Diovan HCT_ I was so fatigued by midday that I felt like going to sleep until the bext morning.

I also have varicose veins and shortly after starting to take Diovan HCT_ a blood clot formed in a superficial leg vein. My doctor said that was not related_ but I have have varicose veins for at least 5 years with no pain nor problem at all. The coincidence was too strong to me to ignore. So those with varicose veins_ be careful and monitor.

So the purpose of the pill does seem to be working well.,M,61,24  days,12/24/2004Email,Diovan hct
396, 4, high blood pressure,For the first three days in taking this medication I noticed an increase in urinary frequence. But after that it is back to normal. And I still feel a little light-headed in standing up after sitting for a couple of hours. But nothing major as it quickly goes away. I also have varicose veins and shortly after starting to take Diovan HCT_ a blood clot formed in a superficial leg vein. My doctor said that was not related_ but I have have varicose veins for at least 5 years with no pain nor problem at all. The coincidence was too strong to me to ignore. So those with varicose veins_ be careful and monitor.
