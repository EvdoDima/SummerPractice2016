0, 1, Genital Herpes,Devastating Depression,Most horrible drug I have ever taken. Within a few day I started to experience extreme depression. When I stopped the drug the depression has lasted for years. While I have no proof it affects or causes long term depression_ I am positive it was the cause of my initial depression. Please so not take this drug!,M,61,5  days1 g 1X D,7/25/2016Email,Valtrex
1, 1, Suspected Genital Herpes,Started medication at 1230pm yesterday and wiithin two hours of first dose severe tingling/stinging started in exterior vaginal area (inner labia majora - the totality of the soft tissue burns/tingles/stings). After second dose last night the soft tissue inside my mouth had exactly the same symptoms and the symptoms in my genitals worsened significantly. Hershey's milk chocolate actually BURNED my mouth like it was a jalapenÌƒo.... I Havent eaten a single thing since --it's the next day_ now.  I will NOT be continuing this medication!,I had zero herpes symptoms/diagnosis and went to doc yesterday for BV test which was positive. At that time the doc noticed a lesion and took a sample with a swab and it Hurt like hell. That was the only time I was aware it was there and the pain stopped immediately.  I didn't start my Rx until 4 hours after the swab and had zero symptoms until two hours AFTER taking it.. During my research many people have denied Valtrex has this effect_ I assure you_ IT DOES!  The blood work and swab results haven't come back yet but I'm giving the doc the benefit of the doubt.  I have no idea which type I have (HSV1 or 2) or how long I've had it since I had lesions that didn't itch or hurt until she sampled it. My only symptoms were bacterial infection or yeast infection related.  My husband has HSV1 so I suspect I got it from him. We have been together for 15 years.  I will let this virus run its course naturally_ I can barely sit down because the burning/stinging is SO SEVERE,F,42,7  days1000MG 2X D,4/29/2016,Valtrex

7, 5, HSVI/II,Periodic GI disruption.,"I am a healthcare practitioner and am writing to encourage patients to try Valtrex if recommended.  It is a very safe and effective drug.  Understand that replies to forums such as this are often only submitted by those who are dissatisfied.  Most of the negative reactions I've read are those of the virus_ not necessarily the drug.  Find out for yourself!  I have many patients who never knew suppression therapy existed for ""cold sores_"" HSVI. It can be life changing!  Though you can still infect others on suppression therapy_ with Valtrex I have no outbreaks and my partner remains HSV free!

25, 1, Suppressive therapy for cold sores,This an update to my original post on 12/30/13. All of my many symptoms resolved within approximately 1 month of discontinuing; however_ I have permanent joint damage in my right foot_ which still causes pain. About a year ago_ I attempted taking a dose to clear a cold sore and the return of symptoms was immediate. I haven't taken them since and won't. I've found that_ once my body no longer was dependent on this drug_ my own natural immunity strengthened. It took a few months. Now_ I take 1000 mg of Lysine twice daily. I just happened to think of updating my original post today. I hope it is helpful to someone and saves you the frightening experience I went through.,,F,43,2  years,8/16/2015Email,Valtrex

27, 3, shingles,I experienced swelling of my stomach after the 3rd pill on the first day.  Awful stomach ache and terrible gas pains that were stuck in my stomach continued to get worse.  Mild Nausea_ diarrhea in the a.m. and constipation in the p.m. with an urgency to go_ fatigue_ muscle twitching which was mild after the first day.  I made it through day 6 and only took one pill on day seven.  Doc. told me to the just toss the final two pills.  It has been 48 hours and the pain and gas is there but subsiding and I hope it continues to get better because these were awful side effects!,The Valtrex did reduce the shingles outbreak significantly so I guess it did its job but not without creating another problem...Both my shingles pain and my rash were tolerable on the drug but my stomach was out of control!,F,33,7  days1GM 3X D,6/12/2015,Valtrex

31, 4, HSV2,Never had side effects before. Always take one pill when I first start to feel funny like an OB coming on. Then another about 8 hours later then another 8 hours later. Those 3 usually nip it in the bud and prevent an OB from ever coming to fruition. This time however I started getting a spotty rash on my chest. It doesn't itch. Just very blotchy. Took one in PM 2 days ago and one in AM and one in PM yesterday (my usual 3) and both today and yesterday I woke up with these splotches. I don't recommend taking this or any other medication directly before bed.,Other than that to prevent an OB it works really well. I just try to use it as a last resort and keep my immune system up so I don't let the virus in. Smoking is the number one OB causer for me as well as around the time of my period. Don't smoke around the time of your period or you're asking for it. Lots of sleep and vitamins and hopefully you won't have to take Valtrex at all. Last resort ONLY.,F,26,4  years500MG 1X O,4/9/2015,Valtrex

I took one that night and one on Tuesday morning and have been nonfunctional since. I cannot stand light or any noise_ I can feel my heart pounding in my head_ and I have barely eaten because I can't keep anything down (thrown up twice with constant nausea). This is the worst headache I could ever imagine_ and for awhile the pain was so bad that I was sure I was having an aneurism_ and that just gives me anxiety. I skipped my Tuesday night dose and I will probably skip Wednesday morning. I plan on calling my doctor and hopefully trying something else_ otherwise I might have have to just not finish the prescription because I cannot deal with these side effects_ they have been much worse than my first break out.,F,22,1  days500mg 2X D,10/8/2014,Valtrex

I started getting them at the age of 32 after my historectomy.  My doctor told me that I was exposed as a child - and much like shingles - a stressful situation is what brought the virus out.  I am still on the fence about that idea ( since the nurse at the time of my historectomy had a cold sore ) he assures me that it was just a coincidence. I am not so sure about that.  At any rate_ Valtrex has been a life saver for me - in the past 2 yrs I have only had about 4 outbreaks which were almost unnoticeable and gone in just a few days.,F,47,2  years500 MG 1X D,4/8/2014Email,Valtrex

I took Valtrex for 30 days straight at 1gm per day then used it only as needed. I had a physical done and found out my kidney function has declined significantly due to Valtrex. 5 months earlier my kidneys were normal on an earlier physical.  I also experienced irritation of my eyes_ fatigue_ lower back aches(kidneys) _and numbness in my limbs. The product works_ but be very cautious when you do use it.

This medication initially seemed to be a God-send for preventing my frequent (premenstrual) breakouts but symptoms came on fast and without warning after almost two years (most of that time as suppressive therapy). I went from being in the best shape of my life (very fit_ active_ recently took up jogging) to dreading the walk to my car at the end of the workday; this happened almost overnight. It took a while to put the pieces together and it has been a scary experience.

57, 4, Genital Herpes,Nausea_ Severe stomach cramps_ dizziness_ headaches_ fever_ fatigue_ and mild hallucinations,A month ago I found out I had genital herpes (And screw the bastard that gave me this damn thing). It's a very mild case_ but still a pain in the arse (literally ha-ha) I was first told to go on the cold sore cream_ but it would take forever to go away_ and then come back as soon as I stopped using the cream. 2 days ago the doctor prescribed me Valtrex_ and told me to take 500mg twice daily. Can I just say holy crap this stuff is expensive - Love uni Student Dilemmas. Anyway_ it's given me bad nausea_ a bit of dizziness_ bad headaches_ a bit of a fever and every now and then I'll see random bright spots of light that quickly disappear_ and that screws with my head. Those side effects don't bother me so much though_ it's the ridiculously sharp stomach cramps that it gives me that are pissing me off. The best way to describe it would be super super super scary period cramps_ but 10x more painful. (And yes_ I'm sure it's not actually period cramps). Seeing as severe cramps aren't listed as an official side effect_ I was wondering if anyone else got this also?Despite these side effects_ I'll continue using it in future as it's cleared up the break out really quick. Although I'm not sure about suppressive therapy yet.,F,19,2  days500MG 2X D,9/21/2013Email,Valtrex

I gained 7 lbs in 10 days (I only weighed 110 to begin with)  I'm going to try a cleanse to try to get this nasty drug out of my system.  Also_ I don't know for sure if it helped speed up the recovery from shingles.  It took 3 weeks for my shingles to finally clear up_ which probably would have happened on its own.

Knock on wood_ I haven't had a full sore break out in 2+ years. Seldom_ a tiny tingle will come about_ then looks like a tiny white pimple. As long as I don't touch it_ they disappear within 2 days thout any pain or nastiness. I practically don't have any break outs anymore.

64, 1, Hsv-1 (I think),I've been taking it since Sunday morning_ I took 2 doses Sunday_ Monday_ one on Tuesday and by Tues evening had red spots all over_ itching everywhere. In addition to the burning with urination and ongoing pain to my genital region. This entire thing started on Friday/Saturday -1 week after having unprotected oral/vaginal sex with my boyfriend for the first time. He's had cold sores in his lifetime but none recently. I've never had a single problem ever. I went to the walk-in_ they took swabs of some of the lesions and a urine sample. It's now Wednesday morning and I still don't know for sure what I have. I was also put on Doxycycline as an antibiotic which caused me to vomit. So now I can't take anything to try and rid myself of this horrible pain. And I'm getting no answers. And my doctor's office wasn't able to get me an appointment until tomorrow. I am miserable and angry and upset. What's worse is he also has spots around the base of the shaft and is on the Valtrex too. Hoping he doesn't have any allergic reactions. Ready to throw in the towel on my life. I don't know anything_ I can't take anything for what we think this is_ I'm in pain.... Seriously. Any ideas or help.

After first episode I had a long break before next outbreak...maybe close to a year.  Then I began getting a cold sore on one spot of lip every other month it seemed.  Then it jumped to inside my mouth where most of my primary infection had occurred.  Recurrence was often so went on 1 500 a day of Valtrex for about 10 years.  Would still have occasional episodes but less severe.  Eventually I stopped it because of pregnancy.  The first outbreak was very bad after stopped.  Then became less sever but still frequent..about once every two months on average.  I didn't take anything for 3 years for episodes but after having my son coldsores were occurring very frequently_ once every 3 weeks or more.  I began taking for each episode2 grams twice for one day then 1 500 for a few days.  Works well to shorten but since I don't know I'm getting one until it really is forming it does not usually prevent.  Thinking of going on once daily again but unsure.  Want to protect my kids most of all but I seem to be getting them a little less now_ can go 5 to 8 weeks between.  Menstruation seems to be my trigger.  Anything hormonal.

135, 5, Genital Herpes,Fatigue_ muscle pain in lower back and thighs_ eye muscle pain,I was diagnosed with GH after I went to the doctor for flu-like symptoms. I thought I had a coincidental yeast infection. She confirmed I had GH (dishonest boyfriend.) I went on Valtrex (1 gram) 1x/day. She said after 6 months_ try to stop taking it and see if I have another outbreak. Had an outbreak wihtin days and felt like I had the flu. Went back on it and figured I would try again in another 6 months. Never had an outbreak while on it. Don't feel any of the side effects anyone on here is talking about. In fact_ I had no problem losing weight when I went on the Atkins diet around the same time I started taking the medication. I was a few days behind in refilling my meds_ and within 2 days of not taking it_ I felt flu-like again. Filled the meds and immediately started up. Again_ everything was good again. Just recently my prescription lapsed. WHile waiting for doctor to refill and call in to pharmacy_ three days passed. Immediately I had a fever_ pain in my lower back and thighs. My eyes even hurt to move them. I had a low-grade fever and was fatigued. Went back on the medicine. Within three days_ almost all the sypmtoms disappeared.

I am just grateful I have figured out that it was the Valtrex. Thank god my insurance lapsed or I might have not ever figured it out. I am sure a few more months of this would have made me suicidal.

That was it_ no treatment no follow up. 29 years later I get a weird pain and go see my GYN who says ""you have herpes"" and gives me a one year RX for Valtrex. And so life goes on. She could have said ""you have cancer"" or ""you have HIV"".  It's only herpes.  Physically it's a pain in the ass_ emotionally oh well.  I've been clueless for 29 years_ it's obviously not life threatening.  I've been married for 23 years and thank God for my husband who is amazing.

158, 5, HSV-2 (Genital Herpes),No Side Effects (I do not do dosing as prescribed) - If I have any side effect_ the only one I experience is a bit of a dehydrated skin appearance and maybe a little tired feeling at the end of the day - it actually seems to help me sleep.,Prior to having an outbreak_ at least 9 out of 10 times_ I start to feel a dull pain in the very lower part of my spine; almost in the pelvis and usually to the left (in my case). Like the lowest part of my back needs to be cracked. This is when I take the Acyclovir (generic).  I do not keep taking it. I only take it as much as to keep the outbreak at bay. (I absolutely wear a condom or I just don't have sex when this is happening.) I have trained my body to fight this virus and now usually have only a couple of potential outbreaks a year (if that). One thing I have come to realize it that HSV-2 causes constipation (or actually_ I do not have daily movements). When the outbreak starts to happen I have excess gas_ bloating and general intestinal discomfort like irritable bowel syndrome. The Acyclovir has greatly improved/retained my quality of life. Just remember that I do not take this daily like everyone else. I just take it to knock down the symptoms... I should note that I eat Activia daily and it has proved to be essential in this formula. I am not exactly Mr. Macrobiotic but I try to eat low glycemic_ low saturates_ ample raw veg's_ fruits_ nuts & grains_ with 30% of my diet coming from healthy fats (with fish oil supplements)_ and 30% from proteins.

It has seemed to really help the healing process without side effects. Aloe vera is very good_ too.I have a plant and just clip off a leaf and squeeze out the gel;it helps take away some of the pain and discomfort.

I do have genital herpes so the feeling alarmed me being on my face even more considering its not something i can hide having to work and go to school and such. Now_ 2 days in i feel tinges of pain throught my body which i didnt have before and have developed a rash on my left shoulder. Burning pain_ and deep tinges of pain. I looked over and saw some redness and within half an hour noticed small little bumps_ maybe 5 and did some research right away and its most likely shingles. I have never had this before and if im already on Valtrex why would i accumulate something new that is usually cured with valtrex?,F,22,2  days500MG 2X D,8/17/2010Email,Valtrex

Others who report depression are probably so_ just from the stress of having herpes_ and the fear of rejection from telling someone you like (or love) about it.,I acquire genital herpes when I was 17. I am now 47. I suffered the outbreack_ 6-8 per year until around 2003. That is when I began to take generic acyclovir. In 7 years I had only 2 or 3 outbreacks. But this year (2010) I began to have outbreaks again. About once a month. I stopped taking acyc. When I was ready to start new medication_ because I could now afford the name brnad_ I asked my DR for a Rx for Valtrex. I have been on it for 4 months. I thought that Valrex would work better than asyc. I WAS WRONG. It seems like I have nothing but constant outbreaks every WEEK. The sores apear on Sunday_ and are gone by Wednesday. But then the very next Sunday_ new sores appear. It almost seems like Valtrex has INCREASED my outbreaks. I have decided to stop taking Valtrex for a month.

164, 3, HSV-2,Fatigue_ irritable_ neck pain,I started taking Valtrex when I was diagnosed with HSV-2. Before I began supressive therapy_ I had about 10 outbreaks a year(for 1 year)_ right before I would start my period. I could always feel when I was about to have an outbreak_ my thigh_ buttocks_ or pubic area would become very sensitive and even painful. My outbreaks would typically last 5-8 days and were usually quite painful. Since starting treatment 1 year ago_ although I have not remained outbreak free_ I have had only 5 outbreaks which last no more than 3 days and usually are not too painful or bothersome. I also do not have the sensitivity and pain that I used to feel before an outbreak would occur.I am thinking of asking my HCP to increase my intake to 1 gram daily to see if it may eliminate outbreaks all together. For me_ the side effects I experience from Valtrex do not outweigh the symptoms I experience from HSV-2 and will continue to take this medication.,M,28,1  years500mg 1X D,7/19/2010,Valtrex

I had a lot of sun exposure in May (daughter's softball season) and started getting fever blisters.  Tried Valtrex for suppression therapy.  Noticed again how good I felt.  Like a fog was lifted from my brain.  I do not have depression or anything like that_ but Valtrex made me feel good (not high).  As soon as I stopped Valtrex (end of June) fog came over me again.

I took it about 3 yrs. ago for 7 days for shingles and did not experience any joint pain and the medicine helped the blisters then also.  Just wanted to let people know when you stop the medicine the joint pain will go away.,The medicine does it's job in drying up the blisters.  It does not help with the pain from shingles.  I would use it again for shingles but not past 7 days.  I also used aloe vera gel on my skin where it hurt and for some reason it helped. Try it!

However_ the day after my last dose_ I began feeling really lousy -- bummed out_ worthless_ overwhelmed and too tired to deal with anything. This has been going on for 4 days. It didn't occur to me until just this morning_ while I asking myself_ ""What in the heck is going on here?"" that I remembered reading that depression is one of the rare side effects of Valtrex. Because these feelings are not at all the norm for me_ and there's nothing new in my life circumstances to explain the sudden arrival of these feelings_ I am strongly inclined to attribute this to Valtrex. Hope it's short-lived_ because it's fairly incapacitating. On the bright side_ the Valtrex stopped the newer of my 2 shingles rashes dead in its tracks_ and is probably responsible for the dramatic improvement in my symptoms (awful pain & sensitivity) after just 2 days on the Valtrex.",F,52,7  days1000 mg 3X D,6/1/2010Email,Valtrex

176, 4, Genital Herpes,dizziness_ headache_ smelly urine and fatigue,I started taking Valtrex when I was tested positive for genital herpes. I had herpes for more than 10 years but never took any mediction til I tested positive and had more often outbreaks until I moved to another country. I think cold climate affect the outbreak. I started taking Valtrex about 2 years ago and at first the medicine did the job until now. It started when the season change from summer to fall. My last outbreak was 12 days ago and I took Valtrex 500mg. twice daily. The blisters disappeared in 3 days_ the burning sensation in 5 days but I still feel tender around the affected area so I'm still taking Valtrex but after 14 Days of taking Valtrex I still feel tender and I'm afraid if I stop taking Valtrex now I'll have the reoccuring outbreak. I have 2 tablets for tomorrow but I think I have to continue taking Valtrex to prevent another outbreak because I don't think taking Valtrex twice daily for 5 days does the trick for me this time.,F,36,15  days500mg. 2X D,5/6/2010,Valtrex
177, 3, Genital Herpes,No side effects at all.,I have had genital herpes for about 10 years and have taken Valtrex for almost as long.  In the beginning I would take it when I had an outbreak to shorten the duration.  I switched to a daily dose about 7 years ago as the outbreaks got worse. (2-4 outbreaks/year)   Steadily_ year after year_ the outbreaks have gotten more and more frequent and MUCH more intense.  As I type this I am having the worst breakout in all 10 years.  2 months -> going on 3 of constant blistering.  It will begin to heal and then breakout again. ... You would think after 10 years that I could tell you if Valtrex works or not.  There are times when I've sworn by it and thought it really worked_ and there are times_ like now_ that it seems to be doing nothing.

Took Valtrex for first outbreak and it went away in about 2 weeks. After a year of almost constant outbreaks I decided to start daily Valtrex. Not only did my outbreaks clear up but they went away completely for over 6 years. I started to skip dosage occassionally the past year_ may have been a mistake. I am currently experiencing the fun of passing a kidney stone. Feeling terrible I did miss 2 doses in a 3 day period and what happens 1st outbreak in 6 years. I doubled up my 500 mg to twice daily to clear it up. I am still having a super mild 1 bump outbreak i believe due to the kidney stone. I would like to say during the 6 outbreak free years I ate what I wanted_ chocolate_ oat based products_ way too much coffee_ fast food_ deep fried everything and Valtrex let me live life outbreak free. I can also confirm Valtrex does stop viral shedding. I was outbreak free for over a year before I started to date again and not one of the women I have been with has contracted HSV2 from me. While protection and condom use is preached we all know its not practiced. My last girlfriend was tested after we split up and after 2 years of unprotected sex she was NOT infected.

Two wks. later I discontinued the Zovirax due to constant prickling throughout my genitals that lasted for years! My BO became so frequent that my Dr. put me on Valtrex in 4/04.

203, 5, shingles,After 7 days on Valtrex - 3 x per day. I was anxious to start after being diagnosed with shingles effecting the V2 nerve line. So panicked about it involving my optical nerve that would not have hesitated to take this medicine! Breakout involved my eye so that was enough of a scare for me. Also prescribed were pain meds and hydrox for itching (itching was intense for me) I took advil in place of prescript pain med and did use the hydrox for 3 days as prescribed. Afraid I would scratch my eye in sleep. Haven't quite determined if side affects were from the virus or the meds.  Meaning still had swollen nodes and my inner ear was tender. Valtrex didn't make me sick to my stomach - tried both with and without food. I am usually sensitive to most meds but tried to ignore that fact.,I have a weakened immune system from thyroid cancer 15 years ago. My age is 49 & it is harder to heal without a thyroid. I was past the 72 hour mark and thought it was a cold - thought I had an inner ear infection (swollen nodes around my ear). More then likely kept @ bay possibly because I was doing several alternative remedies prior to taking the Valtrex. Had the rash for over a week before I started the meds. Personally it helped me to be disciplined and stay on a raw juice diet (carrot celery apple & parsley) also fresh orange juice the following week. If you read about helping yourself_ studies show vitamin C is huge in the healing process for shingles. I didn't have much of an appetite and slept for the 1st three days trying to keep my eye closed and rest. I recommend drinking a lot of water and any extra fluids with valtrex. You are in the bathroom a lot which seemed to help me mentally thinking I was pushing everything thru. I was conscious about my diet at all costs and convinced this help me heal faster. Rash is not completely gone and I understand it is not instant gratification. So will try to be patient and continue healing. Personally I could not have lived without Valtrex. Healing time cut in 1/2 by at least a week. It was a challenge although much better then the other outcome! Hope this helps. Wishing you a fast healing process.,F,49,7  days,1/1/2010,Valtrex

Really apprieicate the feedback and apoligize for my poor spelling!!!,i have been taking it for 2 months for suppressive therapy but have taken it for 3 years jsut for outbreaks.  I think I might just go back to just as needed but I worry about spreading it to my partner even with safe sex practices but the iching is really keeping me awake at night.

208, 4, genital herpes,Initially_ no deleterious effects were noted.  Over the course of a fews days I experienced headaches and nausea at the 1000 mg dosing which was greatly relieved with reduction to 500 mg.,Valtrex is a drug which works for me but not without problems.  I understand many people have had more difficulty than me with it_ but it has been a good ride.  The idea of lifelong suppressive therapy is something I still have to wrap my mind around...I wish I had the foresight to avoid this situation in the first place.  Having a limited relationship with a seemingly trustworty African American lead me to a lifetime of dealing with herpes.,F,22,45  days,11/9/2009Email,Valtrex
209, 4, Genital Herpes,Constipation,This was very bad when I first started taking it at high doses due to a severe outbreak. Then I went down to 500 mg/day and it seemed better. But later I added an antihistamine due to allergies and then an antidepressant and it has been off the wall. I eat at least 30 grams of fiber/day but that doesn't do much.

I take 500 mg a day; if I skip even one dose_ I get a minor outbreak. It's not as bad as a major outbreak_ but I'm concerned it isn't as dependable as I would like.

I took Valtrex immediately after first outbreak_ very minor_ one noticeable bump. Took a month dosage_ stopped completely. 9 months later_ I took Valtrex for a 2-4 days. A day or two after taking Valtrex for first time after going off it I noticed a bump appear. I got the feeling that taking the Valtrex had somehow stimulated the virus. Now_ I took a Valtrex pill yesterday (after 6 months without it) and today I feel my nerves jangling. It really feels like the few times that I've taken the drug it somehow stimulates the virus to react. Not sure if this is a reaction that others have had.

I'm on 500mg/day_ but would like to cut that in half and see if I'll still be OB free.  I can't find any substantial information on weight gain as a side effect but in my case there's absolutely a correlation.  Please comment if you have had a similar side effect.  I also believe that the manufacturer has the technology to cure this disease but won't take those steps because it will compromise the HUGE revenue stream they're currently enjoying.  It will be interesting to see what happens when the patent expires.,F,49,5  months,9/7/2009,Valtrex
220, 1, Shingles,I was taking Valtrex 3 times per day (1 GM Tabs). On the fourth day I awoke feeling very disoriented and fatiqued.  The fifth day was worse. I made the decision to stop taking the medication and even though several days have passed I still feel out of it. My shingles were not very painful and I feel my own body would have handled them without this medication. I am so sorry I took it and worry that this disorientation will not end.,If you have a mild case of shingles_ let your body take care of itself without taking this medication.

I stop taking Valtrex and started taking Acyclovir as a preventive therapy. Then I wanted to take Valtrex again to see if it was all in my mind. NO it wasn't after taking the first pill the yeast infection was their the next day. I can't handle the yeast infection. It probably will work but after one pill I get an yeast infection.,I will continue to take my Acyclovir 200mg twice a day_ taking four pills a day can be bothersome_ but no outbreak since 3/09_ maybe some tingling_ but it goes away instantly.The pamplet does not say yeast infection but I do agree with another lady that wrote on this website_ yes I got one also.,F,41,1  days,8/30/2009,Valtrex

225, 5, HHV-6_ EBV & HSV-1,In the first few weeks_ headaches_ mild dizziness.,Valtrex_ I believe_ has really helped keep my markers down for the variety of viruses I've got.  I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome due to these viruses.  I started on 500mg per day and am gradually working my way up to 1g.  I graduate slowly due to viral shed off and the flu like symptoms.  Note: these are not side effects of the drug_ but effects of the virus cells dying off in my system.

228, 2, genital herpes,My head felt weird (almost like blood pressure was up) after taking the first dose.  Also felt tingling down my right leg (along the inner thigh area).  I skipped the 2nd dose_ and woke up the following morning with this weird area that popped up on my right thigh - looked like a blister/rash/allergic reaction.  The doctor thinks it's weird that I had this reaction_ but from what I have researched_ this really isn't all that uncommon.  I did additional research and have found that red marine algae and Lysine are good healthy alternatives that help keep outbreaks at bay.  so far so good!,No way I will ever take this stuff again!!,F,32,1  days,8/3/2009,Valtrex

Or was this because I had received vaccine a year earlier?   I don't know if Valtrex did any good and am going to either stop it or half the dosage for the last two days.  The side effects are frankly worse than the shingles blisters' pain which I have dealt with fairly well with only OTC pain meds_ cool damp cloths and the distraction of duties I could not ignore.

231, 5, Genital herpes (type 2),possibly dizziness_ headaches_ GI upset_ and fatigue,I've had genital herpes for over 25 years_ since I was 21. I've taken Valtrex for so long I can't remember when I started_ but I began on Zovirax_ the first version of the drug. It's been at least 15 years_ so I must be one of the people who have taken it the longest. I take 500 mg daily with no major side effects_ or at least side effects that I can definitely attribute to Valtex. I love that it keeps me breakout-free and can also reduce the chances of transmitting it to others. I rarely get a breakout_ except if I miss or skip a dose and am sick or stressed. Sometimes sexual activity can irritate the area and trigger a breakout. Even if I get a breakout_ it's now so minor I don't always know if it's a herpes sore_ and it doesn't really hurt_ I just have the sensation that there's a little spot of irritated skin. But I would much rather take the drug than have to deal with even minor breakouts_ so I continue with daily suppressive therapy. If I get a sore_ I double the dose for several days. I get bloodwork done every year to make sure my liver function is fine_ and so far it has been. My only concern is that your body may become dependent on Valtrex and if you go off the suppressive regimen_ it may take your body a while to build up its own antiviral defenses_ so you might have to endure a series of breakouts before they subside. Then again_ that might not be the case. I will continue taking Valtrex indefinitely. I'm hoping the generic version will be just as effective.,F,48,15  years,7/15/2009,Valtrex
232, 3, shingles,bad gas pain_ couldn't get to sleep for hours last night. I usually never have gas pain_ so I looked at side effects of valtrex since that's the only thing that's changed from my regular routine.,"If I have to go through another night like that_ I'll fight through it. The symptoms of shingles aren't as bad as that. Since Valtrex doesn't really ""cure"" you_ I might stop taking them.",M,33,3  days,7/9/2009,Valtrex
233, 5, Genital Herpes,None.,Aside from the initial outbreak_ I had just one other one three months later. Both times I took Valtrex episodically and both outbreaks were fairly mild.

I try to do everything Homopathically but somnetime the virus--particularly in summer heat get aggressive so I take the daily dose of Valtrex for about 6 months to calm it down.   BEST REMEDY FOR OUTBREAKS that I have found VERY SUCCESSFUL in stopping if not quickly healing is to spray the area of the sore or thingling with DMSO (70% DMSO & aloe vera)just before an outbreak and during.  I have been amazed that the sores just disappear! Good luck fellow sufferers!,,F,56, ,6/29/2009,Valtrex

I had been taking 3g a day for about a month and then went down to 2g a day for another month and now Im just taking 1g a day. I did here from a friend that the Valtrex can depleate the Iron in your body. Maybe thats why everyone is feeling fatigued?

242, 4, HSV 1 & 2,This is only my second full week on this medication so I have to keep on eye on things. Nevertheless_ so far... Week 1: Within the first 3 days I had: fatigue_ headaches_ my eyes were red and painful_ had a mild sore throat_ overall feeling of dehydration. Also_ for about a day_ I felt tingling in every area that I had ever had an ob. Week 2: The symptoms from Week 1 are gone with the exception on the dehydrated feeling. (the prescription information does state that drinking extra fluids is recommended) I'm usually very sensitive to medication_ so I think I'm doing pretty well so far. From what I've read here_ things could be a lot worse,I've had HSV1 affecting my lips for about 21 yrs. After a VERY bad ob about 12 years ago_ after an extended period in the sun_ my lip obÂ’s have diminished greatly and have been very few and far between. 4 years ago_ I was diagnosed with HSV2 genital herpes. I had a horribly painful initial ob that lasted 3 weeks! After that_ my obÂ’s have been tolerable_ until a year and a half ago_ when my ob's dramatically increased to about once a month_ which prompted me to consider and finally ask for a prescription. Stress_ my period_ and being overly tired all trigger my obÂ’s. I've also noticed that when I have a lot of sugar or just don't drink enough water_ I'll have an ob. Now_ I'm on 500mg once a day for suppression of my GH. When I started the medicine_ I had an 8-day-old outbreak that cleared up after the second dose. Not sure if it was the meds or if it cleared on its own_ but I'm hoping that I won't have anymore ob's and from what I've read here_ my system won't come to depend on the meds. Yesterday_ I was rushing out for work and forgot to take a pill. I could swear I felt tingles off and on all day. Maybe_ it was all in my head_ but I took the missed dose right when I got home and all seems to be okay. I know that there are no studies beyond 1 year_ but the thought of having a pain-free_ outbreak-free_ normal life again and the possibility of reducing my chances to passing this on to someone else_ for me_ far outweighs any of the side effects IÂ’ve exper,F,34,2  weeks,5/24/2009,Valtrex

244, 4, HSV-1 (spreaded to genital region),fatigue_ dizziness_ sleepiness,I have been taking Valtrex on and off since I was 16 yrs. old. I caught the HSV-1 herpes through oral sex_ so it is now on my genital region unfortuantely. I take 500 mg. It does work for me_ but it causes me to be extremely sleepy. It does take about three to five days for the symptoms to go away for me with Valtrex. I pray they find a cure for this awful virus soon! I'm wondering if they are already working on a cure or if they even already have one and they just haven't put it out yet because of the money. Did anyone else on here happen to contract herpes the same way I did? I need to know if there is a group of people with herpes that I could communicate with.

Since I've been on suppressive therapy I have not had an outbreak. The only side effect I've had is the photosensitivity. I'm not much of a sun bather_ but I've noticed over the years that when I get the tiniest bit of sun this pimply red rash occurs and it takes several weeks for it to go away.

249, 4, hsv,Currently I take 1 gm daily for suppressive. I upped the dosage about 6 months ago from 500 mg daily. I'm very paranoid about an outbreak and also take lysine daily.  Recently I ordered somehting on-line called Herpaflor which has Lysine and some other herbal supplements in it.  I'm hoping it is ok to use both.  I do feel like my stomach gets upset and have occassional headaches.  I also have a lysine lip balm because there is a spot on my upper lip that could turn into an OB.  To me anything is better than an OB.  I am a bit nervous now because I noticed my fingernails seem to have horizontal ridges on them and I just had blood work done.  My dr. said I seem to have low potassium.  Does anyone if any of these medications affect potassium.  Also does anyone seem to feel like their glands under arms sometimes throb.  I also seem to notice that the bottom of my back and top of my next seem sore. I'm wondering if that is HSV related or medication related.  Thoughts anyone?,,F,37,2  years,4/3/2009,Valtrex

During the time I was on it I had one outbreak. I tried again a year later_ and went off after a week because of the same side effects. I tried taking famcyclovir for about a year_ but was still having 8-10 outbreaks a year. I went on valtrex for the third time about 1 year ago_ and this time have not experienced noticeable side effects.

Since my first two pills I have not had an outbreak_ and that was just over a year ago.  I tried many_ many remedies over the years_ including changing my diet_ hypnosis_ exercise but the only thing that has worked well is valtrex.  I too was concerned about side effects_ but am pleased to see that some users have been free of outbreaks for up to 11 years on the same dosage I am on.  Expensive_ yes_ but certainly better than the alternative.  I have been happily married for 20 plus years and have a great daughter_ and not having to worry about when the next outbreak is has made my life better.

Good luck to all_ maybe a cure is in our future... However_ I guess their is no money in that for the drug companies,M,39,8  years,3/15/2009,Valtrex
256, 1, HSV-2,None,I don't see the point in taking Valtrex but maybe I'm a special case. I was diagnosed with genital herpes right before my 21st bithday and I had 3 terrible outbreaks... all while taking Valtrex. They lasted about 3 weeks each. After the last one I stopped taking Valtrex and since then I've had extremely minor outbreaks lasting a day or 2. So what's the point of taking it? It doesn't keep me from passing the virus to someone else_ and it doesn't treat outbreaks so really to me its useless. I might just be a conspiracy theorist but I feel like with all the technology and research_ there has to be a no BS CURE that can treat the virus. It really upsets me that drug manufacturers and doctors push this drug on ppl affected by this virus_ and it only makes ppl sick and makes the ppl who make it rich. I bet if everyone stopped taking valtrex_ and made these ppl lose all their money_ they would find a cure real fast.,M,21,3  months,3/14/2009,Valtrex

258, 5, Herpes,None that I can drastically notice,Thank goodness I only have gotten outbreaks sporadically; 2 or 3 times per year is a lot for me. I have had G.H. for nine years and my last outbreak was over a year ago. I just got a prescription for Valtrex today! I tried to endure through an outbreak once and it was a nightmare! I let my pride go and went to a Dr.; was prescribed 500mg/twice per day for 7 days. My outbreaks go away after the third or fourth day and I'm back to being okay. Valtrex is a wonder drug for me. The place where I get my prescription from also has a drug program where I get 28 500mg-pills for starters and then a year's supply for free! Can't beat that at all!

259, 2, genital herpes,none other than increased outbreaks if I do not take it daily.,GH for 18 yrs. Initially_ ob's were so infrequent(1-2/yr)that I took no meds & endured the ob's.Then a doc urged me to take Acyclovir during ob's to shorten duration. It did shorten duration & discomfort_ but outbreaks increased to 5-6/yr. Decided to take daily Valtrex the past 3 yrs to prevent outbreaks so my hsb and I could safely try to conceive. Since then_ I now get an outbreak if I don't take the med for 1-2 days.  I hate this.  The med has made my body more dependent on it. My doc doesn't believe me_ but 2+2=4!  I see others have said this too.  I too have thought that this is the intention of the drug maker. As soon as we give up on conceiving_ I will go off Valtrex & try to let my body build back its virus-fighting abilities_ maybe try alternative medicine route.

261, 4, herpes in sacral area,Dizziness,I've been taking a suppressive dose (1/2 pill) for 6 months and never had any side effects until yesterday. I am still getting an occasional small outbreak so the doctor said to up the dose to one pill twice a day X2 days if I get a flareup. After taking the last pill yesterday_ I got quite dizzy although not enough to make me ill. I'm hoping this is not going to continue because this drug has helped me very much even though I'm not cured. Obviously there's no cure for herpes but reducing the outbreaks is very important to me. I get a secondary skin condition as a result of herpes that's much worse than herpes_ believe me.,F,50,6  months,2/7/2009,Valtrex

264, 3, herpes,Severe headaches the first few days . I am on 1 a day for recurrent outbreaks.,I am an herbalist and I am aware that the virus attacks because of a compromised or lowered immune reactions in the body. I have been taking a combination of remedies: Tea tree oil is a must for any outbreak of herpes. The oil is a strong essence of the plant I recomend using another base oil to thin out the oil if sensitivities occur. Apply directly to wound or at first sign of an out break. Also one of the best anti-viral herbs is Oregeno. Use it in extract (alcohol or oil) form. Thin out the oil if that extract is used. It will tingle or sting if directly applied but if thinned out a bit is an excellant remedy for sores. If the sore is inside or near any muccose membranes- use a strong tea (or alcohol extract) of echinacea and goldenseal- drink it three or more times a day. Women can put this tea inside (put in warm water to remove alcohol if extract is used) the vagina or anywhere it is internal.  Take L-lysine internally and repeat the tea dose until synptoms subside or continue t,F,32,4  days,1/30/2009Email,Valtrex
265, 1, Herpes,I developed hives 8 months ago. They would come and go and it was very uncomfortable_ sometimes even miserable.  Over the months it got more severe.  Then in December I developed blistering and rashes all over my body in addition to the hives.  I have so much itching and discomfort at this point_ it's interfering with my life.  I've been to the dermatologist multiple times and had biopsies.  Results are nonspecific_ inflammation possibly due to contact dermatitis or a reaction to a medication.  I've done so much detective work and experimenting trying to find out what's causing this.  I think I have pinpointed it to Valtrex.  I took Valtrex occasionally when I'd have an ob. Each time I would take it I believe my skin condition got worse.

I would rather go for a more natural treatment but it does work wonders when I have an outbreak and it usualy goes away pretty quickly.,F,23,10  years,9/3/2008,Valtrex
306, 4, genital herpes,Extremely bad gas on day 3 and the day after stopped taking. Bloating &  diarrhea. Abdominal pain.  Dry skin_ acne break out and irritable.,I did take it for the 3 days to stop an oncoming ob.  For me its worth it_ I can't stand the outbreaks_ to me they are worse than the side effects. Don't think I would do the one a day by the sounds of the other ratings.  I only get 2 - 3 a year and for me its usually stress than can bring them on_ will use it again for sure.,F,34,3  days,8/31/2008,Valtrex

I have a body that just simply crashes.. I only recently found out the sores were herpes_ genital and also on my back if I were in hosp.. yet I am aware i have had these rashes for about 30 years or more.. I had serious chicken pox as a child and at 15 had shingles so bad it covered half my body.. when I had an outbreak and then my husband  got it I checked again.. and yep.. g h and shingles.. the pain on my skin is horrendous. and is constant.. yet the outbreaks were infrequent until I got cancer_ for the second time now the outbreaks are never ending.. but my main concern is am I tired because of this medication?. I am literally falling asleep.. I am an active person_ even with complications of lupus and thyroid cancer.. yet since starting this treatment one month ago daily I am a wreck..

308, 5, shingles,sleepiness and lack of appetite,I have almost finished my course of valtrex_ 7 days-3xday-1gm caplets.  It has stopped the spread of the blisters but not the pain.  I am taking Motrin to take the edge off.  I have read that people have had both sleeplessnes and sleepiness as side effects.  I will take either over the shingles.

309, 4, Genital Herpes,None really other than feeling tired and looking worn out.  I look like crap after I take my medication_ so I usually take them before bedtime_ unless I have an outbreak.,I have had GH for 20 yrs - started taking Zovirax worked well - was switched to Valtrex about 8 yrs ago.  Started taking 500mg. outbreaks increased so dosage was increased to 1000 mg 1 x daily. However_ if I miss taking my daily dose an outbreak is imminent. Along with tingling in my legs and buttocks area_ I have severe pain in my hip joint area.  The pain is so bad that I cannot walk.  To help alleviate the pain I take Valtrex every 6 hours around the clock for roughly 2 weeks in order to get rid of the pain in my hip area.  Sometimes I wonder if I am taking too much but eventually the pain/outbreak subsides.  I noticed that the herpes virus travels through out the body. So I have to make sure I don't miss my daily dosage and I drink lots of water because I read that kidney damage is potentially a long term side effect.,F,53,20  years,8/26/2008,Valtrex

I have taken Valtrex off and on over the past 15 years both as suppressive therapy and just during outbreaks.  I now realize the pain I have experienced in the upper left of my back just below my left shoulder bone is from the Valtrex.  The pain makes it difficult for me to turn and use my left arm.

I suffered with this since I was 17 & caught it in Beautician's School! Went to so many DR. & they had no idea what was wrong. It works so well for outbreaks & now taking daily.

I have had cold sores for about 10 years and this is the only thing that clears them up. i hadn't had an outbreak for maybe a year_ and then i got an outbreak.

315, 3, Genital Herpes,None that have really stood out_ perhaps some stomach discomfort at first. I take it before bed so perhaps that has helped. However_ after reading these posts_ I am wondering if itching on stomach and top of legs that accompanies each outbreak is related to Valtrex or herpes.,Have had GH for 20 years but with such infrequent outbreaks that it wasn't even diagnosed until a year ago. Now I get so many outbreaks that they overlap. I think it's due to stress. Valtrex has not cut down on the number of outbreaks_ only the severity. I no longer get shooting pains down legs and only get a bad lesion every four months or so. I take 1 gram per day as suppression therapy. Am considering stopping just to see what would happen as the number of outbreaks continues to be high_ and would love to get rid of the itching! I started taking 1500 gm Lysine per day_ plus vitamin C_ E and D_ and Lysine in particular has helped with number of outbreaks. I wonder if it would help with severity as well.

I immediately went to the doctor and he prescribed Valtrex and an ointment to relieve the pain from the open sores.  My sores are now almost gone_ however I do experience back pains and pain at the top of my thigh.  It almost feels as though my by begins to cramp up.  However I'll keep you guys posted on any other side effects.

I had difficulty telling when an OB was actually starting so I constantly missed the three-day window when you're supposed to start taking it. Because I was having frequent outbreaks (1x month) I decided to go on the 1x day regular maintenance dose. I haven't had a single OB since I started taking it full time_ and I no longer stress about ""Am I having one? Should I start taking it?""

For some reason I have been getting them like crazy and the severity is increasing every time since the last year and a half. I got fed up and finally asked my doctor for Valtrex. I've had this for about 10 years or so and it seems like every time I go out in the sun I have OB. Sucks.,I initially wanted the Valtrex 1 a day but my doctor felt like prescribing me 1gr/2x every 12 hours. So far I still feel the tingle on my lips but they seem to be going away already.

I switched to Valtrex brand after that and would take 1 pill (500mg) about every other day or so up until about 3 years ago. I began experiencing severe stomach pains right after I got out of college which was about the time I began taking Valtrex. At the time I didn't correlate the two but after seeing a few doctors and nobody finding out what was wrong with me I started questioning them about Valtrex since that was the only medicine I had ever taken on a consistent basis. They assured me the medicine in no way could be behind it. My symptoms got worse and I noticed I starting having anxiety problems. At one point it got so bad that I couldn't sleep at night. At that point I got serious about finding out what was wrong and I realized that if I took a Valtrex that evening  I would have the horrible anxiety symptoms that night and I would have stomach problems a day or so after.

First off_ shingles is horrible_ so anything they could give me to help clear it up I would have taken. Second_ Valtrex seems to work pretty well at clearing up the rash/blisters_ but with some noticeable side effects. The first day I took it after the 2nd pill I felt very uneasy. Sometime in the night I woke up and spent a good amount of the early morning vomiting. Same thing with the next day.

Constantly lethargic which is odd as I am generally a very active person.  Because I'm tired all the time_ the rest of my body hurts.  I don't think that's a direct cause of Valtrex.

It helped some.

346, 5, genital herpes,Absolutely none,I have had genital herpes for about 30 years and always came down with a breakout whenever I used to travel and other stressful times. I tried St. Johns wort for about a year on advice from my naturopath but it did not help in any way. About a year ago I decided to try Valtrex which my regular doctor had prescribed earlier but I had initially resisted. It is fantastic. I only take it 3 x a day for 3 days as soon as I feel an outbreak coming on. It stops it right in its track every time. I also actually took a trip this winter and did not have any outbreak_ a welcome change to my travel adventures. I would recommend it in the dosage I take but would not want to have to use it daily or weekly as a suppression. It has made my life much better_ especially the lack of frequent pain and discomfort in the panty zone. I used to have about an outbreak a month but that has also lessened_ but then my stressload in life has also improved which i am sure contributed to my outbreaks.,F,51,1.5  years,4/21/2008,Valtrex
347, 4, Genital Herpes 2,I feel really tired. I take it before bed to keep from feeling dizzy. Headaches more often now. I look like I've aged five years in one month. I look like the crypt woman. Very rough_dry_ facial skin and more wrinkles than I've ever seen! Body skin is itchy too. I'm not vain but I don't want to look way older than I really am. I am very worried about long term effects. I agree with the other lady. I think the drug companies could cure this today but they're making too much money off of your daily suppressive therapy!,Valtrex made my outbreak go away. I am now on 1000 mg of suppressive drug therapy every day. Haven't had another outbreak since. So_ in that aspect_ the drug works. I take Valtrex to keep my fiance' from getting genital herpes. We also use a condom every time_ which we hate to do_ but no choice I guess. If it wern't for fear of giving it to my fiance' I'd probably stop taking it (unless I got more outbreaks).,F,48,35  days,4/18/2008,Valtrex

Within the past three years I have experienced genital ulcerations. I have never had sex_ so I knew it wasnt Herpes II_ so my doctor assumed it was Herpes I and prescribed me Valtrex. It did not work_ so we biopsied an oral ulcer and a genital ulcer that I had and they both were completely negative for any herpes whatsover. It turns out that I have Behcet's Disease which is an autoimmune defficiency where you have too much inflammation in your body which can be expressed through ulcers in the mouth and on the genitals.

I do know that the crashing fatigue_ dizziness_ and migraine frequency coincide with my beginning daily valtrex for suppressive therapy. Doctors have assured me that Valtrex has nothing to do with the increase in frequency of migraines_ but I remain uncertain... the only test will be to stop the drug and see what happens. The upside is that it has been highly effective in reducing the number of outbreaks. I went from having them so infrequently that I barely remembered I had the disease to having them about once a month after having children. On valtrex_ I rarely have outbreaks.

352, 3, shingles,on my 2nd day of valtrex and i have not been able to sleep one wink... hope that goes away.  drinking tons of water_ and peeing often...  total loss of appetite_ some nausea_ ears ring when i try to sleep... heart rate up a bit_ but might be a little anxiety from thinking about having this crazy shingles thing... dry cough_ but i had a cold prior_ so thats prob it.  fatigue but cant sleep...,i think the valtrex stopped the spreading of the shingles_ and i am hoping they dry up soon and leave... not a big fan of my first shingles experience.  I didnt experience much pain yet_ but the fact i am semi-quarentined to my couch is a big depressing...  will post again when things improve_ hopefully,M,30,2  days,3/30/2008Email,Valtrex
353, 3, Herpes Simplex 1 (lip),Bad headaches_ fatigue_ mild nausea_ foggy head_ sort of feverish,I take 2000mg when I feel an outbreak coming on and 2000mg 12 hours later. (Dr.'s orders) Outbreaks are so quick the drug doesn't seem to be able to counteract them. Now I usually take the drug when I believe I may be at risk for an outbreak. (sick_ fatigued or stressed) 2000 mgLysine and 2000mg Vitamin C per day have reduced the frequency of the outbreaks significantly. Only recently realized the drug itself is making me feel like crap. Going to try more Lysine + Vit. C and skip the Valtrex altogether.,M,44,2  years,3/28/2008Email,Valtrex
354, 3, HSV 2,After 2 months of suppressive therapy I have started to notice memory loss_ blurred vision_ and a very itchy rash that started on my back_ arms and chest.,I was diagnosed with HSV 2 12 years ago_ I have only had a few outbreaks over the last 12 years_ and have taken Valtrex to treat the outbreaks as they occurred.  Started suppressive theray for a very mild outbreak 2 months ago_ since I have had another outbreak and all the symptoms I mentioned.  I will no longer use for suppressive therapy and will talk to my doctor about other medications or only taking when I feel an outbreak coming on.,,,2  months,3/25/2008,Valtrex

I work with the public and had constant outbreaks on my lower lip_ sometimes up to 5 cold sores at once. First tried a one-time rx_ then another massive outbreak a week later. Rx for 1000mg/day has left me outbreak-free for months. It is about $10/day_ thank goodness for my health plan! I so have a slight concern about a recurring pain_ am going for blood tests next week to see if there is a correlation.

356, 4, genital herpes,Initially I got mild headaches and sudden sharp nerve pain in head.  Also noticed the red spots on my trunk that others have mentioned.  Dizziness on lying down and getting up_ but am learning to live with it.  Most annoying side effect has been tachycardia_ but I cured that by taking 1/4 of a 90 mg tablet of potassium with the Valtrex.  Can Valtrex cause potassium depletion?  Have definitely noticed a loss of energy and an inclination to nap after lunch_ something I had not done before.  Will try taking the pill before sleeping instead of in the morning and see if that helps.,Have had GH for almost 20 years.  Very infrequent breakouts at first_ but outbreaks increased after age 60.  Was happy to find a doctor who prescribed Valtrex suppressive therapy_ one 500 mg tablet a day.  It works like a charm_ but if I forget for just one day I get a tingle in the sole of my foot that tells me a breakout is imminent.  I also worry about long term side effects but my doctor says Valtrex has been used for many years and at one point the maker was considering making it available over the counter since it was so safe.  Hard to imagine since it's so expensive.,F,64,8  months,3/10/2008,Valtrex
357, 3, genital herpes,Severe joint (hip&knee) pain_ back pain_ vision blurriness_ headaches and muscle stiffness.,I started taking valtrex 1 year ago 1/day. I take it at night so I don't notice the sleepiness. I thought all was well but in the last 9 months_ I've been chronically injured. My muscles hurt all the time_ I've been in physical therapy for over 3 months and they can't figure out why I'm always injure or in pain. Plus I've been to my eye doctor a couple of times because my vision has been blurry and we've been trying different types of lenses.  PT recently asked me about my meds_ but I didn't mention the valtrex. After reading these posts I'm starting to think it is the valtrex. I found some relief in the number of outbreaks_ but not noticeably better than before.  Especially not worth it if it is causing these other problems.,F,38,1  years,3/7/2008,Valtrex

These symptoms started 9 months into suppressive treatment_ so I assume it is the Valtrex not nerve damage. Can still 'sense' when outbreak is taking place_ no pain or blisters but aware of nerves jangling_ no pain though.  Have been given Gabapentin_ a nerve calmer_ to address possible side effects of Valtrex_ not taking it as no doubt the Gabbapentin will also have side effects!

I'm not sure whether what I'm feeling is symptoms of the medication_ or whether it's the virus of herpes causing these things in me. I was diagnosed with herpes 4 months ago_ and have been taking the medication as a suppressent since then. The migranes are full on_ sharp and heavy_ and cause me to be home. The rest of the time I've got a medium kind of headache constantly. I've become alot more tired also. I get the tingiling alot of the time_ but this doesn't end in an outbreak. I've only had the sores once_ but I get tingiling in the genital area_ and also around my body_ mostly in my legs and in my back quite often. My period pain has increased_ I've never had such strong cramps. I'm sceptical about this medication_ and intend on searching for natural ways in which to suppress the herpes.

By day 7 (2 days after I ended my 10 pills (twice a day)) I saw zero symptoms.  I have chosen_ at this time_ not to take daily but will consider if I'm with a partner for preventive.

Recently_ through blood tests_ I learned that I had a high creatinine level.  So_ I had my kidney function checked (GFR) and learned my kidney function is way down.  This may be a possible side effect of Valtrex; however_ there are really no long term studies on the drug.,I have searched many websites about Valtrex; however_ none really have information about the long term effects.  Many sites talk about high creatinine levels and not to use Valtrex if kidney problems exist.  But_ nothing specific if daily long term use of Valtrex causes kidney problems.

Musculoskeletal effects include joint ache_ muscle soreness_ muscle fatigue and increased soreness after muscle exertion. Tendency to develop tendonitis and ligamentous discomfort in the fingers_ toes_ wrists_ and ankles (tendons especially). Occasional spaced out feeling with visual blurring_ light sensitivity_ easy eye fatigue. Vertigo symptoms will develop with some medications and especially with concomitant use of alcohol. I have noticed increased irritability and behavioral changes while on a higher dosing of valtrex.,For twenty years I have taken acyclovir or valtrex (valtrex is more effective for me). The genital herpes outbreaks are minimal to none while taking valtrex 500mg once to twice daily. Occaional tingling and lancinating pains in the genital region warn me of an impending outbreak. A gram twice daily for a day or two followed by 500mg twice daily thereafter for 5 days stops the symptoms/outbreak from developing or minimizes them. I feel the valtrex is making my muscles_ ligaments_ and tendons more vulnerable to feel discomfort.

I still had outbreaks whilst on Acyclovir_ and was aware of the symptoms 'rumbling' away. February 08 was put on Valtrex and what a difference_ it has suppressed the symptoms and reduced the pain more. For me_ it is much more effective and has improved matters considerably. It also means I take less medication on a daily basis_ two tablets a day_ 500mg morning and night. The higher dose is due to the frequency and severity of my outbreaks. Maybe after a year I can cut the dose down to 250mg twice a day_ but it has worked for me and with no side effects that cause concern.,F,47,6  months,8/27/2007Email,Valtrex

More rash-like than anything. But it kept me from wearing short skirts and showing my arms. Now I am going to stop the medicine and go to the alternative route.
