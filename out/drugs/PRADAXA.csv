0, 1, Atrial Fibrillation,Worsening stomach pain that would not be healed by PPI Losec. Initially family doctor who prescribed it said that I have to live with the pain. After nearly 3 years Heart specialist said that pradaxa Causes stomach ulcers_ and changed to Eliquis_ which I have using for only one month with lesser pain.,Does these medications serves any purpose to the patient other than  benefiting the CEO'S of these Billion dollar pharmaceutical Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) Ltd_ and for the doctors medical research where the patient is nothing more than a guinea pig.Human life is not worth living with these severe side effects _ far better to be dead and free from these torturous side effects,M,62,4  years150 MG 2X D,5/11/2016,Pradaxa
1, 1, Afib,I had a brief 2 seconds of blindness_ feeling like I was seriously going to pass out_ and right before that the left eye had sensations of flashing lights. I was only on half the dose at the time. Good thing I had just parked my car and had gone into a store.,I ended up in the er. I even found people online with the same exact description of the eye issues as I had_ some were much worse_ one woman went blind for 2 weeks. WTF? May work out for some but I cant take it.,F,51,3  days 1X D,1/6/2016,Pradaxa

4, 1, A-Fib,Death_ Congestive Heart Failure,My dad died after taking Pradaxa for 6 months. Because they don't test for the effectiveness_ when he started having weakness_ ankle swelling_ bloating_ indigestion and a cough_ his doctor sent him to one specialist after another - never realizing he'd gone into congestive heart failure. He was put on Pradaxa for A-Fib_ and his heart was operating at 100% prior to Pradaxa. After 6 months_ and numerous doctor's appointments_ he was hospitalized with heart failure and we were told his heart was operating at only 20%. They put him on Coumadin but it was too late. He died within a month. This medicine should be taken off the market.,M,71,6  monthsn/a 1X D,2/10/2012Email,Pradaxa
