0, 5, Reflex Sympathic Dystrophy,At this point I really don't have any side effects.,the exact dose is 275 every 72hrs. The fentanyl patch saved my quality of life_ such as it is.  I was in excrutiating pain for 2 years while trying all those oxy___whatever pills on the market until the patches were introduced to me and finally some relief.  The only problem I problem I have with them_ honestly_ is that over the  years I have been titrated up on the dose so much_ because the disease I have is a progressive one_ that there really is not much further to go without stopping my breathing.  And when I need surgery to change the battery in my neuro stimulator_ what pain medicine do they give me?? Fentyal is the top of the line.  I've been given dillaudid before and it takes the edge off.  But that's the problem with this medicine...its fantastic for major and long term pain_ but be careful.....there is a limit....I know I've reached mine and now I'm in a predicament and I still have more and more pain_ as well as break thru pain.,F,47,18  years275 3X W,2/8/2016Email,Duragesic-100
1, 3, degenerative discs failed fusions,No appetite whatsoever Severe weight lossDry mouthDifficulty passing urinePalpationdifficulties falling and staying asleepLack of energyI started on 25mcg patches 8 years ago but after a while your body gets used to it_ so it doesn't have the same pain killing effect which necessitates you going onto a bigger dose. I'm now on the largest patch and have been for nearly 4 years and I still find the pain to much to bare even with taking oral morphine on top for breakthrough pain.,,M,,8  years100mcg,10/1/2015Email,Duragesic-100
2, 4, DDD spinal stenosis arthritis L2-5,No real side effects other than adhesive giving a rash.,Im not taking Duragesic but the generic. There was no listing for it. Its from the company Apotec. Ibe read on other sites it doesnt work as well as other patches but simce this is the only patch Ive used so far I cant complain. Seems to be working just fine to me. Havent had this much pain relief in years. I have two issues with this patch. #1. Its too thin. Its like a mylar ballon and feels like one too. Its so thin it crinkles on your own and so it doesnt lay flat on the skin. Ive used a breathable bandage to keep it flat. I must me somewhat allergic to the adhesive because when I take the patch off on third day the skin is irritated and red and itchy but doesnt hurt. I thought Id give it a month and in a few days I'll get a refill and will try a different brand. Hopefully it wont cause the irritation.,M,44,4  weeks100mcg,7/13/2015Email,Duragesic-100
3, 5, MCTD,Little nausea,I'm only taking 50 mcg every 72 hrs.  A total life changer for me.  I live with chronic pain over my whole body.

4, 3, degenerative disc disease,Takes 12 hours to work_ then only works for 24 hours. Maybe if there were a higher dose it would work better. Works good when it actually works_ but 72hrs..NO WAY!,,F,30,1  months100mcg/h,7/11/2014Email,Duragesic-100
5, 5, degenerated disc's,"Minor itching morning after applying. Occasional night sweats_ I think related to time of applying. Never had one remain usable for more than 48 hrs. But_ I have a somewhat normal life now_ & side effects would have to get much_ much worse for me to switch from them. Best pain management I've had_ & while I'm not pain free_ I am able to lead a functional_ productive life_ & not spend my days back and forth from sofa to bed trying to find a comfortable position.

9, 1, Back pain following back surgery,I was prescribed a 50mgs Fentanyl patch. I had placed my first Fentanyl patch on my back on Friday_ July 12_ 2013 and placed my second patch on a different area of my back on Monday_ July 15_ 2013.The first 3 days of usage caused me to become very tired and to have much increased pain_ not only in my lower back_ (sacroiliac area)_ but_ also in my shoulders_ neck and upper back. Additionally_ I developed severe constipation. (At the time of this writing_ Wednesday_ July 17_ 2013 shortly after midnight_ I have not had a bowel movement for four days_ despite having used stool softeners).My second patch resulted in my falling asleep at my computer; sleeping with my head on my computer (laptop) from 7:45am to 6:30pm_ Tuesday_ July 16_ 2013 and waking up with acute edema and excruciating pain. I kept waking up and then nodding off_ (with my head falling onto my laptop). I became unconscious_ disoriented to time_ and incoherent. I was_ as well_ off-balanced and exceptionally woozy!,"A friend stopped over just when I needed for someone to help me. His coming over was incredibly fortuitous. He had a very difficult time waking me_ with my continuing to nod off with my head lying on my computer. He left after both us believed that I was fully conscious. I wasn't. I kept nodding off_ repeatedly_ finding myself with an unlit cigarette in my hand. I_ in time_ woke up enough to be able to call my insurance company's 24-Hour ""Call a Nurse"". We agreed that I needed to call my pain management doctor. He was reached by his answering service. The answering service relayed information from my pain management doctor to me. I was informed to_ immediately_ remove the patch. I did so.I_ at this time_ (almost 12:30am_ Wednesday_ July 17_ 2013)_ am becoming more alert and oriented. I still am having pain; but_ the severity is decreasing. I remain very tired and shall_ soon_ go to bed.This is PRECISELY what happened for me when I was in a SNF and had been prescribed a 50mg Fentanyl patch. The poor nurse who found me in an unconscious state was very frightened telling me_ a day later_ that I could have died. The insurance company RN told me the same thing and said that I was very lucky to have had my friend come over at the time that he did.  I call him_ ""my angel"". Maybe he really is!I have got to inform every doctor with whom I am presently working_ (and all future doctors)_ that I simply cannot take any opiate/opioid medication. Phew!

10, 3, Chronic pain from disc fractures,Has helped but have horrendous brain fog. Tiredness which is threatening my job security. I had to choose this drug_ morphine continuous release__ or methadone for my pain relief after major mess in Florida. I was taking oxycodone & perfectly fine_ but had to change to one of 3 I mentioned. This drug saved me from oxycodone withdrawals_ but now I am forever it's prisoner.

17, 5, Fractured spine - burst L4,Reduced appetite_ occasional insomnia upon initial application_ reduced effectiveness upon day 3 of patch life,After a 35 foot/5 storey fall upon concrete_ I smashed myself up pretty badly and was initially given IV morphine while in hospital (1 month) and then Oxycontin the first 3 months of my 6 month stay at a rehab' centre before moving onto Duragesic 50 mcg_ which was a MASSIVE improvement by the 2nd day..best thing the Doc's ever did for me!! I could never expect life to be perfect after smashing myself so terribly but Duragesic is FAR better than any other analgesic I've tried. Over time_ I've progressed to 75_ and recently 100 mcg as one of the discs has worsened and more pain relief has been required but no increase in side effects!!,M,38,3.5  years100 1X D,1/18/2012Email,Duragesic-100
18, 5, Generalized internal chronic RSD,Nausea_ vomiting_ tiredness,I tried over 60 various medications to control the intense chronic pain caused by my generalized internal chronic RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy). Only strong extended release narcotic painkillers work for me. The one that works best for me is Duragesic (brand name fentanyl patches made by Janssen Pharmaceutica). Generic fentanyl patches do not work as well for me_ if at all_ and cause me much worse side effects. I can say without the shadow of a doubt that Duragesic patches gave me back my life_ that is_ they gave me a life worth being called a life. Thanks to the Duragesic patches_ I can now work. I can also do the activities I enjoy most: sky diving_ horseback riding (especially circus type)_ water skiing_ rock climbing_ mountain hiking_ etc. I can never thank Janssen Pharmaceutica enough for making these wonderful fentanyl patches. The only negative point is the very high cost of the patches_ for patients whose medical insurance will not cover fentanyl patches and for uninsured patients.,F,37,9  years125 mcg 1X O,11/25/2011Email,Duragesic-100
19, 4, Lupus pain_ Fibromyalgia,Reduced appetite_ sweating_ mild nausea,I use the generic_ mylan brand fentanyl patch. I prefer this to the duragesic patch which gave me some skin irritation. Mylan sticks better and does not irritate my skin. I am so glad for this long lasting patch that gives me continuous relief for several days. I prefer it to popping oxicodone every few hours. Other pain meds caused way more ups and downs and fatigue than the patch. I feel almost normal_ pain is not gone_ but much reduced. Without this_ its was excruciating. I can lead an active life as opposed to being bedridden with pain. Just wish it wasn't so expensive. Fortunately my insurance has been covering the cost. I would give it 5 stars if sweating wasn't an issue and if it didn't cost so much_ and if it was easier to get off of. Once you start this drug_ it is extremely hard to get off of because the withdrawals are so severe. So I try to stay on the lowest dose I can tolerate.,F,53,8  years175mcg 1X O,9/7/2011Email,Duragesic-100
20, 4, Failed back surgeries,I also am suffering from severe nerve pain and have been given methadone for that.  Duragesic is the only medication that works for me and I like it due in part to a past addiction to codeine. With a patch and the fear of ODing on Duragesic it is the best method for me.,I change patches every 48hrs and I have now been on the 75mgc for so long on the second day I am feeling withdrawal symptoms of constant tiredness.,M,59,7  years75mg 1X D,8/7/2011Email,Duragesic-100

I have had 5 back surgeries-laminectomy (failed)_ spinal chord stimulator implanted_ battery changed_ stimulator removed and a spinal fusion/stabalization.  Nothing has worked!!!  I have of course tried every narcotic and non-narcotic pain med out there!

23, 5, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,dry mouth_ occasional withdrawal symptoms_ fatigue_ constipation_ initial skin rashes on application site,Has the potential to move you from constant intense pain and hopelessness to managed pain levels that are livable. I don't know if it is possible to get to a zero level of pain with it_ perhaps because I am resistant to take more than I do. The patches do not last for 3 days for me. I take them every 2 days and try to alternate changing (sets of) patches so that I change one or more patches each day. This means: at a dose of 200 ug/h_ use 100 patches. Put on patch A - 100 on day 1; put on B - 100 on day 2. On day 3 replace A with a new patch C - 100. This keeps the dosage more consistent. At 175 it works fine with A-75 and B-100_ etc. Variation of temperature can cause withdrawal symptoms for me_ which is frustrating. The initial skin irritation was addressed by spraying a corticosteroid inhaler on the skin in the application area_ then letting it dry before applying the patch_ for the first several months of use. Dental issues are a problem for long-term use_ as is constipation.,F,34,6  years125-225 1X O,12/31/2010,Duragesic-100
24, 5, Broken back. spinal cysts_ CPS,"Skin irritation (esp. w/ new SANDOZ patches)_ constipation_ occasional mood swings_ occasional nausea_ slight ""loopy"" sensation rarely",The SANDOZ branded fentanyl patches are now made by ALBA (a division of Johnson & Johnson)_ and as of March 2009 (the copyright date on the packaging)_ stopped using a gel reservoir with a porous membrane covering the reservoir in its high-dose patches (by 2010_ SANDOZ eliminated gel reservoirs in ALL of its fentanyl patches). Instead_ SANDOZ (like competitor Mylan) uses a matrix of Fentanyl in strands that melt with body heat. The matrix is covered with polyacrylate adhesive and backed with a VERY thin polyester/ethyl vinyl acetate covering  My body does not react well to these new patches; I get nausea (not uncommon; some studies show that up to 10% of people on ANY high-dose narcotics will develop nausea during product use) and my skin gets so irritated I can watch it pinken through the semi-opaque covering.  Pain doc is attempting to reduce my overall fentanyl usage (thus_ adding a box of 50 mcg/h in with the regular 75 mcg/h to facilitate switching from high to low).  I'm still having great success w/ the patch_ though--nothing keeps pain at bay like it.,F,47,3  years50-75 mcg 1X O,10/31/2010Email,Duragesic-100

Battled pain from severe fibromyalgia_ rheumaoid arthritis_ 3 herniated discs_ lups-I had just about had it with doctors and medications prescribed. I was in so much pain_ my quality of life was nil. This gave me my life back_ yes_ with a few changes_ but all I could handle. I did end up having all my teeth extracted and was told the patch was a factor in that but hey_ I got dentures and all is well. If you take this drug as directed it is a life save.

Cut back to 75mcg and I think clearly now but some pain has returned.,I was on morphine sulfate for a couple of years_ total of 90mg a day. This did little to help_ made me a little nauseous. Doc switch me to duragesic patch starting at 50 mcg for 6 days then to 100mcg. The 100mcg along with 15mg morphine sulfate for break through pain. This got rid of 80% of pain and did not even need morphine. Two weeks ago I cut back to 75mcg patch_ I could not  think clearly. Ok on 75mcg although I'm getting about 50% reduction in pain.,M,59,3  months 1X O,5/4/2010,Duragesic-100
27, 5, Chronic pain from nerve damage,A little tiredness and I have noticed my memory is not as sharp as it was sometimes-these side effects are NOTHING compared to other narcotic meds I have tried through the yrs and I have tried them all!!,This medicine has been a miracle for me and I am amazed that it is not prescribed more often for people who have severe and chronic pain. It is so amazing not to deal w/ the constant withdrawal/ups and downs of oxycontin_vicodin_and other more commonly presribed meds. Morphine gave me terrible migraines and restless legs as it would wear off and it made me sooo tired. These patches give a steady stream of med. that if used properly_prevent you from ever having to deal with all that agony. It also gives me better pain relief than any other med w/o any real side effects besides a little memory issue which could have more to do w/ my insomnia which is unrelated to this med.I have also only had to up my dose once in 4 yrs and that was because my condition worsened not because the drug became less effective. So_ talk to your dr. if you have chronic pain....people who have died or od'ed from Fentanyl have misused it - people don't die from using it correctly.,F,46,4  years50mg 1X O,4/6/2010,Duragesic-100

Been on Loritab 10 mg x4_ Lyrica_75mg x3 Demerol 50 mg x4_ Norco 10mg x 4_and now Percedan 4.35x6 and tinazidine 4mg x9 and now the 25mg patch. So far its only been 72 hours but I feel 0 relief from the patch. It's on my forarm and I keep it in place with bandages in an X over the patch. I am hoping my doctor will bump me up to 50mg tomorrow....I am sooooo sick of the pain. My quality of life sucks. I was working full time and walking 3 miles a day before this happened. It was supposed to be a simple surgery and back to work the next day.....that was in August 09. Do the 50's work without doping you up? I have a 10yr old to take care of. As for that person drinking the medicine...good luck and God be with you cause one of these times you are not gonna come out of it. This stuff is no game.

29, 5, chronic pain_ spinal tumors,mild constipation_ skin irritation from patch adhesive_ mood swings,This medication is a lifesaver_ literally.  I was ready to commit suicide because I could not stop the pain I was having from tumors on my spine and severe fibromyalgia.  I was first given it after a car accident_ and within an hour after the patch was put on_ I felt something I hadn't felt in YEARS:  Pain-Free.  It's not a perfect drug--it does cause constipation_ the adhesive is a skin irritant_ and my moods tend to swing up as the medicine gets absorbed and down as the dose runs out--and if you stop taking it suddenly_ you WILL go into opiate withdrawal_ no question.  But if you're a chronic pain sufferer who can't get relief no matter how many high-dose narcotic pills you take_ ask your doctor about the fentanyl 3-day patch (the generic name for Duragesic).  One patch can change your life...at least_ it did for me.,F,47,2  years50 mcg 1X O,3/7/2010Email,Duragesic-100
30, 5, Fibro_ herniated discs_ neuralgias,mild constipation_ skin irritation with Duragesic brand when worn above waist,This medicine literally saved my life.  Before it I was in such severe_ constant pain that I was actually seriously considering suicide.  I had zero quality of life.  This medication allowed me to be functional again and although I am far from being pain-free_ my quality of life is pretty good.  I am on disability but am able to have a life now.  I would highly recommend this medication to anyone with long-term_ severe chronic pain not getting relief from other pain meds.  I change my patch every 48 hours because on the third day it seemed like the drug was wearing off and I was needing lots of breakthrough pain meds. (Many Medicare Part D plans pay for up to 15 or 16 patches a month so ask your insurance carrier if you have the same issue).  I am now on minimal breakthrough pain meds.  I have been at the same dose for 6 1/2 years and have been able to avoid increasing the dosage by using alternative therapies along with the patch.  I have found that the Mylan brand_ being a smaller patch_ causes less skin irritation than Duragesic_ especially when worn on the very lower back/top of buttock area where less pulling occurs with movement.  Although the manufacturer tells you that you should wear it above the waist_ this is only because they only studied it there_ but I had no decrease in effectiveness wearing it on my lower back or upper buttock area.  The patches also stay on much better for me there_ with no need for tape or overlays.,F,34,7  years75 mcg 1X O,2/26/2010Email,Duragesic-100

Vivid nasty nightmares_ couldn't sleep_ was then tired in the day_ felt really sick.

I also was about at the stage of suicide from intractable pain_ ( back_ and chest ) for 5 months. If you can imagine how horrible and disconserting it is to have chest pain 24/7 for months_ and literally not be able to do for yourself.  Oral opiates just were awful_ made me sick_ didn't last_ or just didn't work.  At first I was very leery of starting the patch_ ( I am an RN ) but it got to a point where I was desperate for relief. Best thing I ever did.  It gave me back my life.  I have also just had my second cervical epidural with some relief but not enough_ unfortunately.,F,62,2  months,1/26/2010Email,Duragesic-100
34, 4, DDD_ L5_ perm nerve dmg in one leg,Nausea_ constipation_ tiredness,I have been on 50 mcg for at least 5 yrs. Without it I'd be on disability. Drug enables me to work and have a life most of the time. Some patch change days I am very nauseous to the point of having to stay in bed all day. Next day I'm fine. I have 5 mg oxycodone for breakthrough but seldom use. Also taking Lyrica_ helps w/ the nerve pain in the leg & arm but gained too much weight! I lost weight on Duragesic. The Mylan generic is best_ the name brand or the other generic increase the nausea. I can swim_ but have to watch exposure to sun & heat or too much medicine will be released @ one time. This medicine made me able to walk on my own w/o using a cane constantly. (Bc of nerve dmg in leg/foot still have to look down & walk carefully). All in all a good drug_ if one must be on an opioid.,F,50,5  years,9/15/2009,Duragesic-100
35, 5, Severe spinal pain after car crash,Addictive.  Constipation.  Difficulty reading (weird eye strain feeling).  Mild insomnia.  Get help with the withdrawal when/if you discontinue use.  Except for the withdrawal issues all the side effects while using were totally manageable.,"This drug was a miracle for me.  After a bad car accident I tried to avoid spine surgery for 3 years.  The patch was life saving for me.  My pain was so bad I was suicidal and none of the ""traditional"" painkillers worked for me.  I had to change the patch after 48 hours -- I could not go for 3 days as it would wear off too quickly and the third day was agony.  Tell your doctor if you think this is happening to you.  When I did finally stop using the patch I went off cold turkey_ on my own_ and I do not recommend that.  The withdrawal was awful and like torture so I highly recommend asking for your doctor's help.  The best part about the Duragesic patch was that it doesn't make you feel high.  You can function and think and have emotions_ etc...  And at the correct dose_ it will take away your pain to a manageable level.  I'm very petite and could never tolerate more than 50 mcg so I needed to take other meds for break through pain -- but so what?  The patch_ while I needed it_ gave me back my life.",F,34,3  years,3/19/2009,Duragesic-100
36, 2, Chronic Pain L4-5 surgery_ DDD_ OA,Somewhat severe constipation. Anxiousness that at a higher dose became unbearable. Uneven release of the drug from the patch.,I've been on this drug two different times. The first time we went up to 75mg and that is where I experienced the horrible anxiety. The second time_ a different MD due to a temporary move_ prescribed it incorrectly and I finally asked him to take me off of it. At that time I found that the generic patch stayed on better and the drug released more evenly. I never_ either time_ could go three days with one patch_ always only two. I also found that certain conditions such as warmer weather_ physical exertion_ caused the drug to release faster. Like most of this type of drug you really should decrease slowly but I found it difficult to go from 25mg to nothing without feeling quite sick. The first time I was on this drug was for 9 months. The second time was less than 2 months. The second time the MD incorrectly prescribed it along with MS Contin and as he increased it I had depressed breathing and heavy sleepiness and I KNEW something was very wrong.,F,51,2  times,2/8/2009,Duragesic-100

38, 1, Chronic abdominal pain,After 6 surgeries and many pain meds_ I ended up on Fentanyl Patch. 75mcg/hr down to 12.5mcg all had horrible side effects - on me.  I missed weeks of my life_ seizures_ possible unconscious at times_ slurred speech_ unable to walk_ constantly falling and getting hurt/cut_ unable to sit-up at times_ stayed awake for 2-3 days then slept for same_ very vivid dreams/nightmares_ and even severe cigarette burns everywhere (including on my body) which I dont remember.,"Not even after all my surgeries was I given Fentanyl.  Being a ""widower"" and living alone_ I do not feel that this drug is safe_ at least for me_ to use without having someone around.  For me and my body it was just a horrible_ horrible drug and I will never use it again unless it is in the hospital under the direct supervision of a physician and/or nurse to monitor me!",M,45,8  months,11/10/2008Email,Duragesic-100
39, 5, Disc pain and rotatory scoliosis,None that I've noticed. I used it a few years ago when I was obese_ and it made me sleep a lot. But now it doesn't.,"I used it years ago and started again recently. I believe this is the best long-acting pain reliever that exists. It was one of three options offered to me: Morphine_ Oxycontin or Fentanyl.  I tried the first two and didn't like them. Fentanyl is wonderful. There's no ""high"" like oxycontin. No side-effects like morphine. My breakthrough pain med use has gone down remarkably. I have to change patches every 48 hours_ as the 72 hour schedule didn't give me enough pain relief or consistent relief.  ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO LET YOU TRY THIS. It is WONDERFUL! However_ when you go off it you may have to use the Suboxone program. I did years ago and it worked to get me off the 75 mcg. dose I was on at the time. I'm only on 25 mcg now_ but I weigh half as much as I did then so I figure that's why less works now.",M,,4  years,10/16/2008,Duragesic-100
40, 4, Fibromyalgia,Constipation_ insomnia on first day of applying patch,Duragesic has been a God send for me. I was on Lorcet 10/650 4x a day and Ultram 50 4x a day_ but it caused a lot of stomach upset and wore off too soon and it seemed I was constantly popping pills. With Duragesic I get constant pain relief. I've been on 50mcg for 4 years. There is no 'high' feeling_ just relief from my chronic pain for 3 days without having to worry about having pills with me at all times. I do occasionally still get breakthrough pain(usually on the 3rd day) which I take Ultram 50 up to 4x a day to help control. I take a fiber supplement to help control the constipation_ which works as long as I am consistant in taking it. I tried the generic patches for a couple months but they only lasted 2 days for me. The first day I felt 'high' on them_ then_ not much pain relief and sort of a'withdrawal feeling' on the 3rd day. So I went back to the brand_ this medicine has given me more freedom in my daily life; I don't know how I ever existed without it.,F,34,4  days,9/5/2008,Duragesic-100

I suffered supremely coming off all that morphine_ but I would do it again in a heart beat.

I think it can be helpful to a great many people but I am very hypersensitive to meds.  The biggest complaint I have was the non stop sweating which was supposed to abate and didn't.  I also absorbed it very quickly so by the 72 hour mark I was in withdrawals.  I did try to go to 48 hours but it knocked me for a loop.  And the most pain relief I had was probably for one MAYBE two days.  I just don't see the point of cycling like this and STILL having to take BT meds.,,51,1  months,5/8/2008,Duragesic-100

Tried every other narcotic on the market for years ending with oxycontin 80mg.  I was gagging taking so many pills.  Though the patches must be used at 2 day intervals.   3 is just an uphill battle fighting to get it back under control.  Most will need Tegaderm or overlay from Jannsen.  Takes a month or two to get used to but when you get at the right dose you can live virtually pain free.  Don't come off it and don't run out by abusing them.  Major withdrawl_ near seizure-like on high doses.  I am on 400mcg every 48hrs and have not seen anyone here even close.  Read that the highest you can go was 300.  Wrong!

46, 3, severe hip pain due to OA,extreme sleepiness_ severe nausea/vomiting at higher dose.,I started on the 25 mcg patch for severe hip pain (I am getting hip replacement in June '08) and found it worked fairly well but I still needed 6-8 percocets (5mg) daily for BT pain. My doctor put me up to the 37.5 mcg patch (adding a 12.5 mcg to my 25 mcg) and within 30 hrs after application I developed a searing headache and intractable vomiting. I pulled thepatches off and started over the next day with the 25mcg. I tried the 37.5 two times_ approximately 3 weeks apart_ and had this same horrible result. Even with the 25mcg_ I am so stoned when I sit down to relax that my eyes cross and I nod out. I can't read a book or watch tv b/c of this. Very annoying! I am seeing my PM doctor this week and will tell him I really can't take the 37.5 patch b/c of the N/V_ and even wonder about the 25mcg making me impaired in general (I work in health care).

I am on the 75 patch every other day.  Every third day I cry uncontrollably for about 2 hours then I'm fine.  The Mylan brand works much better than the Duragesic or the Sandoz.  Sandoz do not stick.  You have tape everywhere.  I woudld try anything first before resorting to this medication.  You are a prisoner to it.  Very bad side effects if you try to come off on your own.  I wish I had never started.  However_ if your pain is so bad you can't walk some days then you have to make a decision.  It does consistently work well for pain.,Make sure on any good days that you are able to save a couple back for an emergency.  I had a steroid shot and one got accidentally removed.  Once the adhesive was not on there at all and it washed down the shower drain and once it just did not work.  My crazy doctor's office told me to take it off and stick it to a piece of paper and get the pharmacy to swap it.  What a joke?  I was stupid and believed them.  So_ try to get a few ahead if you can and if you up the dosage save the old ones for these types of emergencies.  Always have a backup plan and make your appointments for your return RX a few days before you will actually run out.  I prefer the Mylan generic.  It works much better is less messy and noticable than the other ones.  Sticks better_ too.  I don't have to use any tape with the Mylan brand.

On pills_ the best I got was 4 hours of relief_ 2 hours of pain_ 4 more of relief_ 2 more of pain_ etc_ etc. Even when I was out of pain while on pills_ I was dealing with stomach pains_ etc. This has given me my life back for the most part and_ along with exercise_ allowed me to avoid surgery for now. Don't get me wrong_ I am not pain free_ but I am damn close to it. Lastly_ regarding my comments on the side effects_ my doctor told me its common,F,37,4  years,8/2/2006,Duragesic-100
74, 5, Herniated Disk L4-L5,Continued...,Lastly_ regarding my comments on the side effects_ my doctor told me its common for patients to experience the muscular withdrawal effects because over time_ your body becomes tolerant of the drug and it doesn't last as long. He also mentioned that increasing the dosage wouldn't make a difference_ I would still experience the third-day problems. My overall opinion is that if I get 28 great days a month and two bad days (which only consist of a few bad hours)_ that far outweighs any pill I have ever tried. I absolutely recommend this med for my condition. It really changed my life for the better. Prior to it_ I was suffering a considerable amount of pain that went all the way down my leg_ I became depressed and very inactive. Now_ I am happy and active again and I almost never feel pain in my leg (maybe 3 times a year) which is a huge plus.

All you have to do is see the number of class action law suits against the makers of this patch to realize many people have had severe trouble and even died because these patches are well known to deliver the full 3 days of powereful drug into your system in 12-24 hours.  I had widely varying symptoms_ even after I thought I was fully acommodated to the drug.  A Board Certified Pain Management Physiatrist told me to ""TAKE THAT PATCH OFF!!!"" based on experience with the poor delivery system and my symptoms.  Also apparently the withdrawal effects can be very bad.  I switched to Kadian and have MUCH BETTER PAIN RELIEF WITH LESS DRUG_ and none of the bad side effects.

I use this medication for a couple of years and then switch to methadone for a couple of years (have done this for roughly 8 years now). This time I have been using the Mylan generic which seems to be much less irritating to my skin than the brand name Duragesic (and much cheaper too). Note: length of time at the right is for this current use of the med.  I have successfully used it twice before for roughly 2 and a half years each time (this med is also much easier for me to wean off of than the methadone but everybody is different).

When I say ""constant"" I do mean ""constant"". I don'tthink I can stress that enough. I don't mean ""constant"" as in""it hurts only sometimes_ but it hurts everyday."" I mean that once itstarted_ it never stopped or let up. Not one hour_ not one minute_ not onesecond_ not one instant. I was not able to stay in school or hold a job.Everyday I wanted to kill myself. I spent a little over a year going to doctors: 2 GP's_ aninternist_ 2 orthopedic surgeons_ 2 rheumatologists(oneat the University of Alabama Medical Center at Birmingham)_  and Ive been to 2 pain clinics (includingJohns Hopkins in Baltimore).  Because of my age and the lack of anyidentifiable damage to my lower back_ I was never prescribed anything strongerthan Ultram. About 8 months into this long quest_ I changed my familydoctor due to insurance reasons. This doctor wrote me a scripfor 45 hydrocodone 10/500s. This was the first time I was able to get ANYrelief and any meaningful sleep. Almost as importantly_ I felt like someonefinally believed me. That Dr. moved me to 7.5s after about 2 weeks of the 5sbeing ineffective_ and he changed the quantity to 60 per month. About that timehe referred me to a pain clinic. I went there and went through numerous tests.More X-rays of course_ another CT scan_ a Bone Scan_ several steroid and otherinjections to test for facet joint problems and such things. Throughout allthis my pain doctor was still only writing the 60 7.5/500 hydrosthat my GP had. Then I had a discogram. After that_ my pain doctor informed me that he hadgotten a pain response in each of the 3 discs tested. He said this basicallymeant (based on all the other tests ruling everything else out) that my painwas caused by nerves giving pain signals for no real reason. Further_ there wasno surgical option or any procedure to fix the problem_ and it probably wouldnever go away. He then put me on 50mg Kadian (SRMorphine). I stayed on this for probably 6 months or so. It gave meabout 30-40% relief. I changed pain doctors_ again for insurance reasons_ andalso was referred to Johns Hopkins. Based on all my records and my severeconstipation_ they recommended that my Dr. put me on Duragesic. I started on the 75ug/hr patches. The pain relief on the 2ndday was breathtaking. I had entered a new world_ a new life. However_ the sideeffects were terrible: severe sedation_ almost passing out when I closed myeyes_ not being able to focus my eyes. So the following day I had my Dr. move me down to the 50ug/hr patches. It has been 15 days since then; I went in to get my refilltoday and asked to move back to the 75s_ as the pain relief with the 50s wasnot quite what Id hoped.

111, 5, Chonic LBP from HNP x 3 x 8 years,Only N&V at high doses.  A little skin irritation.,This is a very potent opiate.  The fatal dose is 1.036 mg for a 150 pound person.  The patches have between 2.5 and 10.0 mg - many times a fatal dose.  It's wise to recognize that you're wearing enough fentanyl to kill several people.  So DON'T PLAY WITH THIS DRUG.  It's analogs are even more potent_ some of them thousands of times more potent_ so don't try to alter the gel in any way or allow the patch to get too hot or too cold.  If you play around with this drug_ you might alter it and turn it into something that will kill you before you even know you're in trouble.  At 20ng/mL_ someone could crack your chest open and you wouldn't feel it.  This was originally used as a surgical anesthetic.  Just don't play with it.  That said_ this is the most effective narcotic I've ever taken (and I've taken just about all of them).  It can be very frustrating_ trying to get them to stick well_ getting them fouled up and ruined.  They can't be reapplied once they come off unless you have Tegaderm or Bioclusive.  Janssen will ship you either one if you ask.  Both of these are adhesives that cover the whole patch.  Ask for the Tegaderm.  Bioclusive is VERY STICKY and will take off skin when you remove it.  The Tegaderm is easier to work with and that makes it less likely you'll get the patch folded up and stuck to itself.  Cut the Tegaderm and just cover the edges of the patch.  The Duragesic seems to be less effective when it's covered.  There are no reinforcing side effects with transdermal fentanyl_ so it might not be obvious to you that it's doing anything.  There's no euphoria at any dose and no anxiolysis or feeling of relaxation.  So be patient and just focus on your pain and whether or not it's better.  If it's not_ tell your doctor.  A higher dose if preferable to changing to something else_ in my experience_ because I've found nothing that works as well.  And I didn't realize how effective the fentanyl was until I changed it to something else.  And realizing my mistake_ I went back to fentanyl_ got frustrated with it again_ and changed to something else again.  But the pain's back and I'll be changing back to fentanyl next week_ God willing.If you have any intellectual curiosity (which by itself means you're smarter than our President) about the history of Duragesic - it's development and clinical trials_ read:http://www.vtd.uscourts.gov/Supporting%20Files/Cases/02cv20.pdfFacinating reading.,M,40,5  months,11/4/2004,Duragesic-100

I cannot be more blatant than that. Over 2 years I slowly titrated up to the 100 patch every 2 days and I have been there for more than a year (sometime in the next few months we'll probably go to 125)_ and I have Vicoprofen for breakthrough pain (up to 5 a day if I need to but usually I only take 1 or 2_ some days none at all!). I love that I do not get the ups and downs in pain level as I do with oral medications_ nor the severe constipation_ nausea/vomiting_ and mood swings. I changed over to this from methadone and the difference has been astounding. I am not pain free by a long shot but instead of lying in bed crying and considering suicide to escape the pain I have 4 hours up and around on an average day and another 4-6 hours I can read or use the Internet in bed with a laptop. It allows me to have something resembling a life and that life being worth living. I have been sick for 10 years and the last 3 have been better than the previous 7 were before that all put together!

114, 5, Chromnic pain after multiple spine,The only side effect I have had is mild constipation which resolved itself once I added more fiber at breakfast.,The Duragesic Patches are truly worth their weight in gold IF the Doctor who puts you on it increases the dose until the pain is mostly resolved. I do on occasion take break-through pain medication_Dilaudid_ which is inexpensive. The lower the doseage you can deal with on the patches the better off you are as the longer you are on them you do build up to a tolerance to the drug. I have been on Duragesic Patches for nine years and am still only at 150ugh. Three hundred is the maximun dose but you definitely want to save those higher doses for critical life threatening complications down the road_ ie. cancer. Duragesic Patches did not work for pain control after surgery for me and methdone had to be used_ then down-graded to morphine and finally the Fentinal after the severe pain had resolved. If you are not getting good coverage in the hospital after surgery because the nurses cut back on your meds without the Doctors approval when you still need heavy pain control call in the pain doctors who work at the hospital_ some nurses are relentless at not caring about your comfort level. It's dufficult being a chronic pain patient physically. Keep your resolve strong_ your mind focused_ and strive for a better life in the future.,F,62,9  years,10/22/2004,Duragesic-100
115, 5, Severe Spinal Pain/Fibromyalgia,See note below,The only comments I wanted to add regarding the Durgesic Patches are: 1. Duragesic Patches have given me the power to lead a somewhat normal life when my last three spine surgeries failed to give me any permanent relief and the pain became intolerable. 2. The ONLY MAJOR downside to the Duragesic Patches is the cost which is prohibitive when one does not have insurance coverage. This is tragic because some people who desperately need the Patches are totally out of luck. It is a drug that you can not just stop taking you must be weaned off of it and withdrawal is doable but very difficult. We chronic pain patients need to have to have some plan we can fall back on if we have lost jobs or insurance. No human deserves to sufferhorribly just because they don't have the money to pay for this drug. PLEASE NOTE: If you are over 55 you can get a discount at K-Mart on the Patches which makes a huge difference.

117, 4, Endometriosis,Very itchy_ dizzy_ queasy_ loss of appetite_ woozy_ VERY SLEEPY,Really has helped me. I started on 25 mg but I guess became tolerant so now I'm taking 50 mg every 2 days. I do have breakthrough pain_ but it's been much better than before. Only thing is_ the itchign was driving me insane so I ripped off the 50 mg pain patch and went to sleep. The next morning my whole body was a wreck - it hurt to move_ I was sick and confused and totally disoriented. Had to put on the patch again_ go back to sleep for an entire 2 days. So be warned of serious withdrawl symptoms!!! No one warned me about that. Besides that_ if used correctly_ I found the drug to be good.,F,26,3  weeks,10/21/2004,Duragesic-100
118, 3, Pelvic adhesions severe pain,Extreme nausea. I had to go on a high-carb (pancakes in the morning)diet to keep my stomach calm otherwise I would throw-up profusely!!! Also had itchiness and irritation on the site of the patch. No rashes though...,I didn't go through an awful withdrawal so that was a plus but I did notice now that this drug was recalled in April 2004. (No one advised me of that)!!!,F,39,3.5  months,10/6/2004,Duragesic-100
119, 4, Migraines,Some bloating_ almost like water retention. Also some anxiety when trying to go to sleep. During waking hours it really helps me a lot_ I never have any pain anymore and find that I don't need to take hardly any other oral narcotic pain meds. Overall I feel that it works very well for the pain_ I just had my doctor prescribe me an anti-anxiety medication to combat the anxiety I seem to feel when trying to fall asleep.,I do think it works well. I just get so much anxiety when falling asleep for some reason. But a good anti-anxiety medication helps with that. It has relieved all my pain. I'm on 25mgs right now_ but have been on doses as high as the 75mg.,F,29,1  years,9/25/2004Email,Duragesic-100

I also have noticed that bitter or sweet foods taste more bitter or sweet_ particulary bitterness.,I think it works great for the first two 36-48 hours. After that I have to add Norco 10/325 to it. I've have noticed that when I remove the patch after 72 hours there's still some medication left in the reservoir.I've found that Ban-Aid brand Flexible Fabric_ Extra-Large bandages work great on holding the patch on_ even in the shower or when I sweat. They're just the right size to cover the patch completely,M,45,2  months,9/22/2004,Duragesic-100

I have been to 4 hospitals in Kentucky_ and i was also sent to the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago_ which was a joke. I have probably been admitted 15 times in the last 7 months. The I.V pain meds. didn't help_ or the ones they sent me home on. I've had 2 CSF leak repairs_ and a Shunt placed in my head. Finally_ I saw a Doctor that put me on the Duragesic patch_ started with 25mg_ then50mg_ now I'm on 75mg _ And I'm finally getting some relief.,F,31,2  months,9/14/2004,Duragesic-100

127, 5, Chronic Pain,Sleepy_ constipation.  Most bothersome side effect is itching under the patch.  After 48 hours I get a rash and the patch starts to come off.,I started on 75mcg and over the course of a year titrated up to 175mcg.  This med works so well that sometimes I forget what the pain feels like or where it is.  I get 100% pain relief.  But if I forget to change the patches_ by 12 hours past the change time_ the pain comes roaring back.  This drug has given me my life back.,F,44,2  years,7/23/2004,Duragesic-100
128, 4, chronic low back pain,extreme loss of appetite.  Lost nearly 30lbs since starting this drug,after 11 months of use it seems like when I apply a patch_ it releases too much of the medicine at once and then after the 1st 1.5 days the drug starts to wear off...  during the 1st day and 1st night of applying a new patch_ I sleep real good and real late_ but after the 1st night the patch starts to wear off...  I am now on 50mcg & 25mcg.  I apply the 25mcg on the 2nd day of applying the 50mcg...  this seems to work a little better_ but I think my skin is worn out due to few places on my body I can apply them...,M,25,13  months,7/11/2004,Duragesic-100
129, 4, Arthritis/Fibro/Degenerative Discs,Dry mouth_ mild fatigue,I have lived with pain for MANY years now and lost interest in about everything I used to do athletically.  I was turned on to Duragesic recently after I spent endless hours researching LONG LASTING pain treatment instead of the pills I was prescribed to pop for a few hours of relief.  I am on the 25 patch which worked extremely well at start.  I noticed next to immediate results int he first 24 hours of use.  It worked well for a week. Here I am on my 4th dose and I am feeling that dull ache coming back.  I am currently sitting at work (barely) and the discomfort has be bouncing around in my chair trying to find a comfortable position.  The weather is cool and rainy which doesnt help in the least!  I must admit that this IS a good medicine for pain and am happy that I got it prescribed but now I am afraid of what might happen if I up the dose.  I KNOW that I will need to do it so I guess I will see what happens and HOPEFULLY will do me some good.,M,29,9  days,7/7/2004,Duragesic-100
130, 4, Severe Neuropathic Pain/Joint Disea,The first side effect was sleepiness and then constipation which has not gone away. The initial dry mouth_ however_  passed after a few days.,Duragesic is a life saver.  I was literally at my wit's end and cried from pain every day_ no physical treatment or medical treatment (Vicadin_ Neurontin_ Percocet) gave enough relief so I could still function somewhat.  Duragesic works straight through_ although some days I feel better than others_ but still considerably improved. I have been taking it under the supervision of a Pain Management Specialist along with my first of three epidural lumbar medial nerve injections.,F,64,12  days,6/28/2004Email,Duragesic-100
131, 5, chronic pain_ fibromyalgia_ RA,Constipation_ which for me was more like normal bowel movent returned. I have IBS with chronic dirrea normally. Prob with patch sticking after 2 days or going into bath/pool/hottub. Slight rash in area where patch is removed.,This medicine has given me back my life. I have been in so much pain for the past 4 years and never had it controlled. Could never get prescribed enough lorcet/vicoprofen/percocet etc at one time to control pain so I would end up with a 1 - 2 weeks of little pain and 2-3 weeks with no medication till next doc visit. With the patch I have no more up and downs from pain medication. This keeps me settled_ helped my depression and I am looking forward to working full time and maintaining a job for the first time in 4 years. MORE DOCTORS NEED TO BE WILLING TO PRESCRIBE THIS MEDICINE FOR PEOPLE IN CHORNIC PAIN THAT IS NOT TERMINAL! I find it has less of an abuse rating. Thanks to God and my Doc for finally putting me on the patch!! Thanks also to my family who supported me through this.,F,33,1  months,5/20/2004Email,Duragesic-100
132, 3, cronic back pain & buldging disc,Sedation,Works ok for awhile.  Pain is still there just seems like my brain does not know the feeling of pain anymore.  Weird sensation.  Still painful though.  Constipating.,F,32,40  days,4/4/2004,Duragesic-100
133, 3, To get high,dizziness_ slight nausea,do to it's long acting effects and heat sensitive absorbsion it was not something recreational that I would recommend. I took the 25 strength patch off the next day. Not a good high and if you shoot this stuff or eat it you may die. Fentanyl is about 20 times more potent than heroin.,M,28,1  days,4/3/2004,Duragesic-100

135, 5, chronic neurological pain,For first few days_ I had some nausea.  Some degree of constipation on ongoing basis.,I initially started with 25mg patch_ but over course of six months_ did not receive the relief of pain that I expected_ namely to get my pain to the point that it was only really bad one or two days a week.  Subsequently_ I've begun using 2x25mg patches.  I've found this works better than 1x50mg patch_ as there seems to be variability between patches.  When I was using a single patch_ sometimes the pain relief would go away before the 3-day use was completed.  On other ocassions_ pain relief would still be adequate after 3 days.  I blame this on patch variability rather than my normally-variable rates of pain because of the constipation issue -- namely_ when the patch quits working_ my stool gets looser.  However_ overall_ Duragesic_ despite its high cost_ is significantly better than pain meds I've used in the past_ which have not been satisfactory.  Previous medications included stadol and vicodin_ with their attendant cycles of on-oagain/off-again relief and the,M,59,10  months,2/7/2004,Duragesic-100

140, 4, Crohns Disease/ Rhabdomylosis,No bad side effects_ relieves the pain of Crohns flairs as well as the cronic pain in leg from the muscular atrophy. I supplement the patch with daily doses of Percocet_ 5mg every 4 hours_ PRN. If pain is not controlled_ I use Roxanol(morphine) 10mg/5ml in place of the Percocet.,Started with the 25ug/h patch_ gradually increased to the 100ug/h_ with increases 1x per week. Have had 6 surgeries for the Crohns_ along with the leg pain_ so pain reief was/is a major concern. Took some time to find a doctor willing to prescribe these meds for the length of time I've used them_ but finally found a doc with some compassion. Only problem is keeping patch on for the 72 hours_ need to use tape after 2nd day. Cost is very high_ my insurance pays all but $3.00_ otherwise cost would be close to $500 per month.,M,44,2  years,5/4/2003Email,Duragesic-100
141, 1, post surgery analgesia,none_ except the patch kept falling off,I was underdosed as it took a lot of fentanyl pre-op to put me out and post-op it just was not effective.
