0, 4, pseudotumor cerebri,i have had the weightloss surgery and as i have lost weight i need less med. if you can call that a side effect thats the only one!!  and maybe sometimes i feel like my head is top heavy,i was diagnosed with PTC that means i have to much fluid on my brain. the neptazane helps to drain the fluid. for a year and a half i had a headache that no meds would stop. it has a lot to do with being over weight. i have seen 5 different Neurolagest and it took the last one to figure it out. if you happen to be having headaches and you cant control then and no meds work you might want to look into it dont wait and let it take up almost 2 years of you life!,F,21,4  months,8/24/2007Email,Neptazane
