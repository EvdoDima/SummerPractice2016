0, 1, Yeast overgrowth,Hives_ rash_ itching. Nauseous,Check this one off my list!,,55,10  days1 x's 2,3/22/2016,Nystatin
1, 5, Yeast over growth in the intestines,Craving for sugar because it is killing the yeast over growth in the body and by eating sugar_high carbs and alcohol the yeast feeds off it. So fight that craving and it will go away in about seven days...eat healthy.,If your problem is yeast over growth and you feel sick all over that could be your health problems. Most doctors still do  not acknowledge this on going serious health problems from antibiotics and or poor diet. I was treated when I was 21. I am 54 now. I need treatment again because I was having chronic bladder infections every month for 2 years. I finally stopped getting the bladder infection but have the over growth of yeast again. I take a good digestive enzyme to help break down my food. That isn't always needed unless you see undigested food in your stool. That is how you will get the food allergies. I have notice that doctors are taking some notice in it by telling you to take probiotics. But they still aren't acknowledging or treating patients with Nystatin or telling them they have an over growth of yeast? They would lose money because this simple treatment is a cure for so many many heath problems.,F,54,4  months,8/14/2015Email,Nystatin
2, 2, Oral Thrush w Systemic Candidiasis,I had some shortness of breath during the first two days_ and should have stopped then_ and then severe fatigue after about 5 days. I stopped it after 8 days and continued to suffer side effects_ with flu symptoms two days later_ and then every 3-4 days for 1.5 weeks so far_ including occasional skin redness and neck rash at night_ sensitivity to cold liquids in the AM_ and continued fatigue_ which is slowly improving.,"The 8 day oral course did not appear to fully address my oral thrush nor my systemic candidiasis. I was taking the oral liquid ""swish and swallow"" version.",M,44,8  days500k U Ora 1X D,4/3/2015,Nystatin

4, 5, IBSD,Stopped my diarrhea_ no adverse effects,"Self doctoring since gastroenterologist and primary care physician won't listen to a thing I say.  Dentist saw yeast in my mouth and I have IBSD.  I started taking 1/2 prescribed dose of oral suspension Nystatin (instead of 4 tsp a day I take 2) and within two days diarrhea reduced substantially and now bowels are back to normal.  They tell you this is all ""anecdotal""_ all that means is no one has been paid a quarter of a million dollars to study its use for IBSD.  I actually know someone else who does the same thing!  If you have IBSD_ take 2 tsp oral suspension Nystatin (morning and evening)_ avoid dairy (use lactaid) and I'll bet your IBSD will subside.",F,65,10  days5 ML 2X D,9/13/2012Email,Nystatin
5, 5, high intestinal yeast  count,Nausea_ pain in stomach_ vomitting_ bad breath_ discolored BM; midnight sugar and carb cravings;and at first it caused increased yeast symptoms and anal itching,I take mid-meal to prevent stomach problems_ and have to force myself not to eat candy in the middle of the night. That said_ this drug changed my life from small things like fewer vaginal yeast infections and less gum swelling_ to relief from severe joint pain and chronic fatigue and frequent sore throats and other opportunistic illnesses. Some quirks: no longer get red splotches on my cheeks and chest when I'm hot_ cold_ or nervous_ and an unexplained redness and mild pain in my fingertips_ gum tissue_ and labia that would come and go before Nystatin has not happened since I started taking this. Honestly_ it CHANGED MY LIFE and with a few diet changes to lower simple carb intake_ it 'cured' what had been alternately been called chronic fatigue_ fibromyalgia_ depression_ or EpsteinBarre syndrome by previous doctors for over 15 years.,F,46,4  years,11/11/2008,Nystatin

9, 1, fungal infection,allergic reaction.  difficulty breathing.,took for 3 days.  after each day became more difficult to breathe.  on 3rd day almost called 911.  doctor told me allergic reaction and to stop.  HOWEVER_ for each pill you have taken_ you have to wait 6 hours.  So_ I had taken 7 pills_ and it took about 42 hours (roughly 2 days) to be able to breathe normally again.  VERY SCARY!  especially cuz I have asthma and it was smog season (July).,M,,3  days,3/18/2006,Nystatin
