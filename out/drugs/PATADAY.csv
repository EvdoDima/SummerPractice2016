1, 4, Allergies,Mild stinging for the first few days,These drops did seem to help the intense itching I get during certain allergy seasons.  It takes a few days to really work well but it does work.  It stings a tiny bit but not anything compared to over the counter allergy eye drops.,F,28,2  months1 drop 2X D,6/30/2010,Pataday
