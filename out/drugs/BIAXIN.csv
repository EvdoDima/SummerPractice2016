3, 2, Bronchitis,Psychotic mood_ vommitting_ fatigue.This was in the high dose but before I this none. I took this 3 times within a year for chest infections then was given again for stomach infection but didn't get to end of that course due to near heart attack with it. Why read on...very important information following,WARNING: This drug DEPLETES POTASSIUM by 3 points each time you take fine if you take once but no more. I took 3 times without knowing this n my potassium bottomed out n had alot of heart issues. You do not wanna mess around with potassium. I'm still trying to bring levels up 7 months on n iv just dropped under range again due to Sun stroke. Iv literally been house bound n in torture making sure nothing interferes n I get fucking heat stroke which affects potassium from sitting on my balcony for one hr.The reason its gone on so long is coz it was missed on bloods which I now know can be easily falsely elevated as there is only a tiny amount in bloodstream rest is in cells. It's unbelievable. I was written off as psychological when I'd severe hypokalemia ...the first symptom of low potassium is leg cramps be warned people. My life is in shams n its a fight to survive,F,31,7  days,5/26/2016Email,Biaxin
4, 2, Ulcer,Anxiety_ panic attacks_ severe depression_ insomnia_ nausea_ spells of crying.,"I took this as a part of the triple therapy for ulcers. It included Amoxicillian and a proton pump inhibitor. The psychological effects were severe. I became a different person and my personality changed. I sought a psychiatrist to help because I was on the brink of insanity. They gave me haldol and zoloft. I never took the zoloft but stayed on the haldol to stave off the insanity. I had what I referred to as ""thoughtless anxiety"" or ""random depression"". This is because I had severe forms of depression and anxiety for no reason and with nothing attached to them.",M,33,8  days500 2X D,5/24/2016,Biaxin
5, 1, h pylori,I only took this medication for 2 and 1/2 days. I thought i was losing my mind. Couldn't fall asleep_ my mind was racing_ my heart was racing_ my forehead felt tight and my eye lids heavy. Awful sour metallic taste in mouth. The worst part was not being able to focus at work_ and the irrational thoughts that were running through my head! Never again.

8, 1, Pneumonia,I was prescribed this hellish drug January 2005. Immediately suffered psychological distress: paranoia_ suicidal thoughts_ delusions_ could not perform daily routines at all and did not leave the bed until Midday_ and the bed had to be in the middle of the living room. It affected my cognitive reasoning and my thoughts were irrational. I would either whisper when spoken to or not respond at all_ all the while looking the person in the eye. At midday I became hyper and frenetic; talkative and interruptive; unabashed and rude.,"It is 11 years later and although my symptoms have lessened they have not reversed. I have irrational thoughts everyday. I cannot keep track of time no matter how many reminder alerts I set on my devices. I am not mindful of present tasks. I resigned a well paying job in lieu of being terminated and collecting unemployment to avoid embarrassment. I put no effort to finding a new job. Having spent 2/3 of my retirement accounts on cosmetic surgery I am in danger of becoming homeless. My attitude toward  life choices is cavalier. I have been transformed from a responsible adult to a dreamer. Where I would never use rude language I now have no issues using vulgarity unless someone monitors my behavior. 11 years ago I begged my PCP to switch me to another antibiotic. Her rationale for not doing so destroyed my life. She asked ""Did I really want to start a new 10-day regimen when I was more than half way through this one."" I wept and said Yes. She said ""Well_ try and hang in there."" My brother_ a psychologist was horrified at my deterioration. I wish I had begged him to call my PCP. I wish I had the bravado to just stop taking it.",F,,10  days30 MG 1X D,3/25/2016Email,Biaxin

65, 1, Pneumonia,Doc put me on this Clarithromycin (Biaxin) for a really bad bacterial pneumonia. It worked within the first 48 hrs. Felt like the virus was making it's last stand within me_ before to lost to the drug. Remember it getting a lot worse fast_ then_ slowly started to feel better.During the 10 days on this drug. Had the typical mild diarrhea a lot of people were talking about and also excessive gas. And I mean bad. Also_ no sleep_ none_ like 10 minutes for 4 days total. I remember thinking_ why am I not falling over after 2-3 days of no sleep. After 4- 4 1/2 days_ finally could get some sleep.,After the 10 days_ the doc wanted to do a 3rd_ 5 day run with it. I said no way_ and she gave me something else for 5 more days_ Z-pack_ I want to say. The side effects_ made no change_ or slightly got better.Now_ this was August 21_ 2014. The first day of this Biaxin. And I still to this day_ (Feb 4_ 2015) have not felt right. All of the following starting happening while on Biaxin and have stayed the same since.Tired_ no energy_ Aches / shooting pain in both shoulders and arms_ down to left hand with numbness in small and ring finger. Every joint cracks_ knees_ shoulders_ arms/elbows_ neck.Weight gain_ anger/short temper_ internal emotional turmoil. Fogginess in thinking at times. Blurred vision when reading close up_ small print. (But could be that time in life at 45 yrs old when glasses come into play. But didn't need before.) Morning (how shall I say) 'bathroom schedule' has never been the same. Prior to this_ within 1/2-hr of waking_ the morning routine of shave_ shower and 'potty' was done. Never to be repeated until tomorrow. Now_ 2_ 3_ 4 times a day_ this 'process' will be repeated. Aside from these things_ I don't feel 'sick' per say_ more like something is going on internally.Truly considering going for a doc visit and getting some blood work to see if something else is going on or it is just the long term effects of this drug.,M,45,10  days500 1X D,2/4/2015Email,Biaxin

143, 1, Pneumonia,The warning label on the medicine said that it may cause diarrhea for weeks up to months.  So two weeks now I lost 8 pounds and went to get some more tests why the diarrhea never stopped and I have now c-diff.  I researched the drug and found out that c-diff is a common reported occurrence.  So I am now going about to report that c-diff should be put on the label as a possible side effect instead of that diarrhea may  occur weeks up to months.,Biaxin had a side effect of diarrhea on the label.  When I started with the diarrhea I didn't think anything of it.  Two weeks of diarrhea I went for testing and was positive for c-diff which is a common reported occurrence of the drug.  So bec the label misled that the diarrhea can last up to months as a common side effect I had possibly spread the c-diff to all staff at the nursing home where I work.

One month on the symptoms were no better (except for the duration  of the benzo) and doc prescribed an antipsychotic_ which I could not tolerate.  Then went on to Diazapam (supposedly to withdraw more easily) and five months later stuck on it!As I withdraw so the original symptoms get worse.Not able to return to work due to diagnosis of severe depression/ anxiety due I know to my extreme stress reaction to everything.

I have had mood swings and crying but I cannot say for sure they were related to this medicine_ although after reading the other comments I am wondering.,I am at the end of my treatment with this drug and I only feel about 50% better.

181, 1, Sinus Infection,I experience very little side effects until half way through the treatment.  I then had insomnia_ heart was beating fast_ restlessness_ unable to think clearly_ and dizziness.  I also started to get ringing in my ears and a horrible taste in my mouth. It has been 5 days since I stopped the medication and I still have the ringing in my ears_ dizziness and weakness in my arms and legs.  It took almost 4 days until the horrible taste in my mouth went away from this medication.  I am unable to work_ think or function now.  I cannot walk properly because of the weakness in my legs_ I am dizzy and have the horrible ringing in my ears.  I went to the doctor today to get some bloodwork done to see if there is any other horrible effects to this med.  I am worried that I have permanent damage to my hearing.  Has anyone out there experience hearing symptoms (tinnitus) and did they ever go away.a  Also has anyone experience more side effects after the medication was stopped.  Please email me at Se,I will never_ ever take this drug again_ nor will I ever allow it to be given to my children....EVER!!!,F,51, 500 1X D,8/7/2012EmailHistory,Biaxin
182, 2, sinus infection,my mouth tasting like what i invision rancid_ rotted_ poisoned meat would taste like,I want to THANK YOU all for your comments!!! I went yesterday to a walk in clinic because I had the worst taste in the back of my throat_ major nausea_ and exhaustion_ I was diagnosed with a bad sinus infection; started the biaxin yesterday_ took 2 doses with food_ and woke up twice last night with this taste in my mouth_ to the point where I was sure I was decomposing from the inside out!!! I was actually thinking of going to the emergency this morning because I was so scared_ but after reading your comments_ I have calmed myself down (especially the comment about the taste being like that of a sinus infection).  I have never experienced a sinus infection before_ so the combination of the bad taste from that_ and add the biaxin_ I was TERRIFIED.  So thank you all for calming me down; I will try to continue the medication_ and I'll make sure i DONT talk to anyone with the rancid breath!!!,F,47,1  days500 mg 2X D,7/25/2012Email,Biaxin
183, 1, Sinus infection,The most god awful drug ever invented and/or prescribed for anyone with depression and/or anxiety. I take low dose Celexa and the occasional immitrex for migraines_ and after 4 days on Biaxin I was diagnosed with serotonin syndrome because of the effect Biaxin has on metabolizing other drugs. I had to take a month long medical leave of absence from work to cope with the physical and psychological side effects of this drug. Major side effects for me included: severe stomach pain_ nausea_ metallic taste in mouth_ heart palpitations_ increase in blood pressure_ headache_ depersonalization_ anxiety_ severe depression_ feeling like I was going crazy_ panic attacks. If you experience any of these scary symptoms_ please know you are not crazy and there are others who have been through what you are going through. Get a psychologist on board to sort it all out- I believe it is what truly hastened my recovery.,I take 20mg celexa for depression- I have taken the same dose for 8 years and have NEVER had a major depressive episode since. I took Biaxin for 4 days before having to go to the doctor. I experienced blood pressure fluctuations to160/105 several times a day_ even if I was just watching TV. My heart would race/beat funny. I have never had anxiety_ but on day 4 I had a full blown panic attack. I felt completely disconnected from the world- people looked strange_ my own reflection looked strange_ my pets looked strange. I felt like I was in a terrible dream and couldn't wake up. At one point I contemplated stabbing myself with a pen to prove once and for all if I was awake or not. THESE SIDE EFFECTS ARE NOT OK. It has now been 7 days since I took my last Biaxin and I am just now starting to feel like my normal self_ but I still have lingering side effects. DO NOT take this medicine if you have a history of depression and/or anxiety... treated or not. After reading so many reviews_ it's obvious this drug can wreak havoc on your brain even if you're not taking antidepressants.  I am reporting this the drug company and filing a complaint with my idiot primary care doctor who gave me a contraindicated drug combination.,F,26,10  days500mg 2X D,7/9/2012Email,Biaxin
184, 2, Throat infection with fever,metallic taste_ mild/moderate anxiety on 3rd day with increased heart rate and felt my heart was pumping harder than usual,As a pharmacist_ the clarithromycin may or may not have caused the anxiety. Only 3% of patients experience psychological problems with clarithromycin so it is rare. I'm normally a very relaxed_ laid back person but I really did not feel myself after the 3rd day of treatment so I stopped taking the tablets.Anxiety may have also been due to being unwell for longer than expected causing some stress.,F,24,3  days500 2X D,7/1/2012Email,Biaxin

When my body comes down with a chest cold the liklihood of developing bronchitis is very high regardless of what I do to curb the sickness.  My body seems to produce an uncommonly high amount of mucus making my lungs feel as though they are heavy filled with glue.  I've taken Biaxin XL twice for bronchitis and experienced positive results with no side effects.  On a side note the doctor also prescribed 'liquid expectorant' to help clear my stubborn mucus.,M,26,7  days500 2X D,6/1/2012Email,Biaxin

I was taking a genaric form of BIAXIN (CLARITHROMYCIN 500) the side effects are horrendous_ feel worse than before I started taking medication. Its been more then 24 hours when I took the 4th pill ( last one I will take) I am still having most of these side affects. NEVER EVER EVER will I take this medicine again!  $75 to poisin myself.

192, 5, Tonsillitis_ Pharyngitis.,Metallic taste,I was so sick when I went to the doctor that to be honest_ no side effect could be worse than that. I'm pretty hardy when it comes to illnesses because I catch things easily- symptoms don't usually get to me_  I usually just stick it out and I don't bother going to the doctor. This time was different_ though. I was on the verge of tears;  I had headache_ I couldn't sleep due to the feeling of drowning on mucus_ my throat was so sore I couldn't drink anything_ and I kept throwing up. I started taking this yesterday_ and am now on my 3rd dose. I've not thrown up since the medication has been in my system and the levels of mucus have dropped significantly. I would take this medication again_ because even if I had experienced the hallucinations/dreams and symptoms that others have mentioned- It's making my infection go away. Nothing that's good for you tastes good_ and if you're taking this you'll probably get worse before you get better- but you'll get better. Which is the whole point.Also_ I noticed that the pill itself smells like vanilla milkshake- the pill tastes of nothing but then leaves the aftertaste. However_ it's nothing unbearable .,F,19,7  days500mg 2X D,4/18/2012Email,Biaxin

After 2 days_ my infection is gone_ however due to the concerning side-effects (are they worth going BACK to the 5-hour wait clinic??)_ I will try to take 1 pill 2 x per day. I think the impact of the 1000MG in the morning may be too much for me.  I eat alot of yogurt to address the potential of this killing all the good bacteria in my digestive system.

195, 4, MAC,Slight trembling_ some dizziness for about 2-4 hours after taking_ drowsiness,Several years ago when I took this for the first time_ I took it on an empty stomach and ended up in the ER with horrible abdominal pain. But since then_ when it has been prescribed_ I've taken it with food and sometimes with an antacid and have had no problems. Now I am taking it as part of a long-term treatment for a lung infection and am thankful not to have the side effects others have suffered. I don't like the way it makes me sleepy in the daytime_ but_ hey_ it makes me sleepy at night_ too_ and I'm sleeping better than I have in years. I just pray that I won't develop any bad side effects and have to break in a different antibiotic. BTW_ I rated this as a 4_ not a 5_ because it has already made me feel better but it will be a year before I'll know whether I'm cured.,F,79,8  days500 2X D,3/8/2012,Biaxin

I'm not even sure how to describe it_ but it actually hurts to breathe_ like my lungs are putting pressure on my stomach when I breathe or something.,First of all_ after reading comments on this site_ I was a bit surprised. Some people are bashing the drug for what are clearly allergic reactions on their part. I am allergic to NSAIDs_ but I don't go around telling people they should immediately stop taking their Aleve. In either case_ after 5 days_ my sinus infection is better_ but it's like the pain transferred from my head to my abdomen_ and I'm not sure which is worse. I can live with the bad taste--it's almost the same bad taste you get with a sinus infection--but I will report the stomach pains to my doctor. I am taking a probiotic_ so I'm not sure why my stomach would hurt. In either case_ this drug works where the augmentic failed (it didn't clear up my infection; that's why I'm on the Biaxin)_ so on the curing side_ it works; however_ I never experience side effects with drugs_ so that part is a little scary.,F,26,10  days500MG 2X D,1/27/2012,Biaxin

LOL,severe allergies_ i'm on stuff most of the year and have terrible sinuses that don't drain and rarely breathe through one nostril - that's a luxury for me. biaxin had the infection clearning up quickly in a day and a half - all he jaw/tooth pain_ severe headache had subsided and stuff was starting to come out of my nose if i took a long hot shower.Side effects vary per person and are *anecdotal* - that one person had side effects_ while very difficult_ does not mean no one should use it.  If that were the case we would loose 99% of the drugs keeping people alive_ that doesn't make sense - because they ALL have side effects to *some* people.

Day five brought on crying spells and night sweats. Meant to begin day seven today_ but current side effects drove me online (at 4am_ thanks insomnia) to see if this was normal.

I also experienced cramps_ gas_ diarrhea.,I absolutely don't recommend this medication. My body is covered entirely with hives and itch like crazy.,F,35,  1X D,11/27/2011Email,Biaxin

226, 5, Chonic illness and recurrent infect,diarehia_ gas_ possibly others bu UI attribute them to th eillness I have lots of experience with_ not the only drug that helps the infections in my scarred lungs; I have found.,This works. Some of what people are claimimg to be side effects are yuor body fighting a serious infection.They are not neccisarily the drug. It does have some side effects_ yes. I have had  in some instances very bad diareha from it and other drugs I must take. The alternative for me is death or hospitalization(which has a high percentage of fatal risk itself).This drup is great for serious infections. Especially if you must also take Prednisone regularly_ although  that magnifies the gastro side effects. But comfort is not what it is for.,M,44,  1X D,10/18/2011,Biaxin

Also felt like my heart was racing.  Very bad drug.  It is a month after I stopped take the full dosage and for the past week my hair has been falling out in clumps every time I brush it (I am not on any other medications_ nor am I sick)_ anxiety still sets in at night causing insominia and even after probiotics daily the nausea is still there.  My eyes feel gummy and dry every morning also.  I hope these post-pill symptoms go away soon,NEVER_ NEVER_ NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!

231, 4, Bronchitis,Metallic taste;Nausea and overall feeling of rawness in stomach;Extreme fatigue;Possible migraine flare-up.,Definitely cured my ailment but when first taking the drug noticed the metallic taste sits in the throat like acidic vomit (constantly cleared my throat) and medication itself made me nauseated (subsided after a few days of use). The worst side effect was intense drowsiness (was completely useless for several hours after). Also_ I have a history of having classic migraines (with aura) and experienced first one in over two years while on this medication (though I cannot say with conviction that it was necessarily due to the drug or mere coincidence). Though the medication helped_ I'd recommend taking this medication only if there are no alternatives.,F,26,10  days500mg 2X D,9/29/2011,Biaxin

It's hard to believe doctors are prescribing this to people as the sore throat itself was far better than the experience of taking this drug. Called the doctor and was prescribed something else.,F,33,1  days500mg 2X D,9/22/2011,Biaxin
235, 5, Bronchial_ asthma infection,A little harder to sleep. No nightmares!,I actually want to warn people about what they read on here. I understand some may have had bad side effects_ but for that reason_ I myself put off taking this med because of some of these posts! I finally got so bad that I had to take it and man I am glad! Yeah_ metal taste_ but only for two hours max. Don't let people freak you out. I was so OCD about it_ I  took 250 mg at first to see how it would effect me and I was fine.

I am admittedly sensitive to antibiotics but never anything like this. First day_ horrible taste in mouth_ jittery_ hot flashes (kept taking my temp and it was normal)_ nightmares about killing myself_ insomnia. Second day_ continued bad taste_ hot flashes_ horrible nightmare which set off massive panic attack and insomnia_ couldn't stop crying this morning.

240, 1, Sinus Infection,Anxiety/panic attacks_ mood swings_ depression_ heart palpitations_ suicidal thoughts.,I previously posted about my experiences with this drug in January. I know a few like me have posted that they had long-term problems. I never had severe anxiety/depression issues until I took this drug. I was sure something was terribly wrong with me - I also suffered long-term physical problems - jaw pain_ dizziness_ insomnia_ muscle spasms_ heart pain/twinges/racing_ shortness of breath. Just wanted to post that if you are having the same problems_ please hang in there. 8 months later I am starting to feel almost normal. The worst was the first 2-3 months. The anxiety became less and less and went away eventually_ for the most part. I wish someone had told me it was going to be alright when I was suffering - it was confused and scared. I was sure I had some horrible disease and was tested for everything. Things that helped me included magnesium and probiotics. I was prescribed anti-depressants but didn't take them (afraid to take any medication after this) and I got through - it was hard but I did it. Do what you have to do. But don't rush it - takes time to heal. Good luck. Looking back_ I truly regret the day I took this stupid drug - I feel like I lost a whole year of my life.,F,30,9  days500 2X D,8/16/2011,Biaxin

242, 1, h. pylori,immediate severe tinnitus_ pain in both ears_ pain in the muscle of my face_ jaw and neck.  woke to the sound of someone playing a flute...so not just tinnitus_ but weird tones as well.,I took this medication as part of a triple therapy along with amoxicillan and prevacid to treat h. pylori in my stomach. I stopped taking the medication as soon as I noticed I was having side effects. The side effects were pretty immediate (within the first hour my ears started feeling strange). A few hours after taking the first pill_ I started taking activated charcoal (I wish I had done it sooner)...I took Biaxin on Thursday and today is Saturday.  I was up all night Thursday night with ringing in both ears and pain in my ears and jaw areas (also back of my neck).  Friday night_ I slept much better_ and this morning I can tell a difference_ but it's not all gone. but I feel like I am getting better.  I think that the activated charcoal  helped & I recommend stopping this medication  if you have any sort of weird feeling in your ears.,M,41,1  days500 mg 1X D,7/30/2011,Biaxin
243, 5, strep throat,Involuntary muscle twitches in upper arms_ irritability,I had strep throat twice within a 5 week period_ the first time I was given amoxicillin and I was sick for 2 & 1/2 weeks_ long after the medicine was gone. I took the Biaxin and the next day not even 24 hrs later I was feeling so much better! Before I took it I was thinking of ways to knock myself unconscious the pain was so bad! This medicine worked so quickly I am almost completely better 3 days later ( I will continue to take the full dose) I had diarrhea for 3 weeks after the amoxicillin_ nausea headaches bloating yeast infection... I think this is a great medicine because I skipped the harsh side effects and got better so much faster! Thumbs up I am very happy with this drug!!,F,31,10  days500mg 2X D,7/21/2011Email,Biaxin

246, 4, Pneumonia,Bad taste in mouth (started on day four)worse the first twelve hours after taking the meds. Occasionnal stomach cramps relieved by Tums.,Bulldozer medication for nasty infections. Really helped the pneumonia. Couldn't sleep much_ but I can't attribute it to the Biaxin because the bacteria from my lungs got into my bloodstream and attacked my shoulder_ causing septic arthiritis and severe pain. Am on high doses of codeine to help with the pain_ so no diarrhea (codeine is a constipant). Am currently on day 6_ and will stick this through because if you stop an antibiotic in the middle of the treatment_ the infection can come back resistant to drugs!,F,30,6  days1000 mg 1X D,6/26/2011,Biaxin

I also feel very tired during the day. I am going to continue taking this because the stomach pain that was caused by the infection is getting better.,The bad taste can be tolerated if you know It's getting you well drink plenty of water and try think positive. This is my fourth day taking it and I still have the bad taste but I am going to wing it because I want to get better_  it beats the bad infection with sickening feelings every day not knowing what it's like to feel normal anymore.

251, 5, Sinus Infections,This is an excellent drug for sinus infections in my opinion.  It worked very quickly and gave me a great deal of relief_ however it must be noted that in some cases BIAXIN reacts with CELEXA and other SSRI's.  I began to experience nightmares and panic as well as an increase in my overall anxiety during the day and after talking with a pharmacist I found out the the BIAXIN binds to your liver and affects the breakdown of the SSRI_ leading to an increase of Serotonin in your system (thus the psychological effects).   I won't be able to take it again for my sinuses while I am on antidepressants_ however I would highly recommend it for those who are in need of an effective drug.,,F,32,14  days 1X D,5/27/2011,Biaxin

I do take it with food and lots of water.,This will not be my go to antibiotic anymore.

I was better within a week_ even though I had to take it for 2 weeks. Remember that sometimes it's your condition that causes  side effects and not the meds. Some of the comments here list side effects that aren't even acknowledged by the drug manufacturer. Not that the manufacturer is to be completely trusted_ but an antibiotic shouldn't cause any mental issues. It may be your infection causing those terrible side effects. I was a teenager_ underweight from being ill and took high doses of the meds and felt fine.,F,24,2  weeks500MG 2X D,5/15/2011Email,Biaxin
256, 5, Pneumonia,Somewhat of an aftertaste in my mouth_ but for me that's easy to overcome by taking it with orange juice/lemondade/milk etc.  It's certainly not worth complaining about.,"Seems to have gotten rid of my pneumonia quickly. Shocks me to see people that it has helped talking about a ""lawsuit"" when possible side effects are clearly noted.  This type of drug needs to remain available. I was out of options with my pneumonia at this point_ and it could have saved my life.",M,31,10  days1000 1X D,5/12/2011,Biaxin
257, 5, Sinus infection_bronchitis_ strep,Metallic taste in mouth_ some fatigue_ headaches_ mood swings_ depression_ anxiety attacks,I guess it seems strange to rate this drug so highly when I've experienced such side effects.  I was sick for 6 weeks straight before taking this drug. It started with strep throat_ then I had bronchitis and at the end I got a sinus infection...I suffered with all 3 at the same time.   I did 7 days of an alternate antibiotic and two different inhalers...with no cure.  I started taking this drug and 4 days later felt improvement.  I got the metallic taste the first day.  It is horrible_ but so is a sinus infection and all my other ailments and I felt it was the lesser of two evils. The headaches were not constant and treated with pain relievers.   The depression_ anxiety and mood swings came after 7 days of taking the drug.  I knew it was out of the ordinary for me to feel that way so I knew it was the drugs.  Again_ although it was difficult I had good support around me and kept going with it. After being sick for so long_ I was glad to be finally feeling better.  You have to weigh the options and go with what works for you.  This cured me well and I felt it was worth it.,F,42,15  days1000mg 1X D,5/10/2011Email,Biaxin

263, 5, sinus infection,First two doses - mild diarrhea and even nausea -  third day some chest tightness and anxiety - then i seemed to acclimate to it and have no side effects. I am very sensitve ti all meds.  Drug is helping - on day four_ but I am still stuffy and have clear mucus and can only breathe on one side which keeps alternating.,"I am taking the TEVA generic which does NOT have a bad taste - if anything it has a sweet vanilla powdery coating. I also added a daily probiotic (capsules with ""friendly"" bacteria to help maintain the normal flora of the intestinal tract and prevent diarrhea and C dif and other related issues). Not sure why all doctors do not tell all patients to do this while on an antibiotic. You can buy this at any pharmacy. I bought a brand called ""Sustenex"" (check expiration date to ensure freshness). I had a cold for a about a week_ then got worse for another week - doctors don't like to give antibiotics adn i don't like taking them - within HOURS of starting this med i started to have relief of the really sick and awful weak feeling I had been suffering with for weeks. Every couple of years or so I seem to get a cold (always in March or April for some reason) that morphs into a sinus problem - wish I knew how to prevent. Tried nasal wash_ nose spray_ oral decongestants_ steam_ saline drops_ nothing helps. I think saline rinses (NeilMed or neti pot)  WHILE you are sick actually makes it worse and can spread bacteria around.",F,58,5  days500 2X D,4/20/2011Email,Biaxin

Was diagnosed with bronchitis and put on a z-pack and Teasslon Perles (because prescription cough syrup makes me really sick). Mid March: Still very sick and back to see my PCP. Still had bronchitis and was given Biaxin (for the first time ever)_ Prednisone_ Albuterol_ Flonase and Cheratussin (was so sick that I actually took this stuff). I'm not sure if all of the effects I am feeling are from Biaxin alone or also caused by a combination of the Prednisone (20mg x 2 daily)_ Albuterol_ Flonase and/or Cheratussin.Have taken 7 days worth and have 7 more days left to take Biaxin. It seems to be the antibiotic that is kicking this mess out of my system so side effects aside_ I'm actually going to finish the entire prescription. I have to say that given the choice of taking Biaxin or dealing with bronchitis for over a month...I'd for sure go with the Biaxin again.,F,37,7  days500 MG 2X D,3/25/2011Email,Biaxin
270, 4, Sinus Infection/Bronchitis,I'm taking the Generic form of this medicine. Maybe it's just Biaxin_ but I honestly haven't been experiencing any real side affects. Since I've been taking this medicine_ I've noticed I've been a little more irritable than usual_ but nothing I can't control. No weird taste etc_ actually the coating tastes kind of sweet. I'd say the biggest side effect (really only to me) is the frequent_ and really BAD smelling gas I've been having_ Other than that_ not much and I've been on it 4 days. Although I usually just remember to take 1 a day_ vs 2_ My advice to everyone is to take the generic_ clarithromycin. I'm sure you would get less side affects_ because I am VERY sensitive to side affects with many medicines usually. Depo made me crazy_ and even nyquil makes me feel like I'm on crack.

Bad taste at the back of my throat. Diarrhea at work all day today.  Tonight_ I just started feeling so down about absolutely nothing and began crying.

I am half way there and_ although the sinus infection is much better the meds are killing me. I have NEVER taken amore foul medication. Wish I had read this site first.

Anxiety_ weak_ low energy_ constantly tired from lack of sleep.,Yes_ i would agree with most posts in here that this is a pretty nasty drug but so is a fungal sinusitus. I am taking this day by day and dredding each day i take this drug and cant wait for the remainder of the prescription.

275, 4, lyme disease,metallic taste,Severe metallic taste the first week of taking it. It was soooo bad I had to constantly suck on jolly ranchers. Even then the taste stuck in my mouth. It seemed to subside about 2-3 weeks into treatment. The pill itself smells really good like a vanilla milk shake so its so odd that it would have such a bad taste!!  No other issues besides that.,F,29,3  months500 2X D,3/18/2011,Biaxin

I was on cipro at first but that didnt work so the doctor prescribed me biaxin. i was very scared to take it after reading the reviews but since i was so frustrated about being sick for so long i decided to go for it.

Z-pacs are a joke_ and with allergy induced asthma_ I have been extremely sick from sinus inf in the past.  When I went in with this one_ my SpO2 was around 88%.This is not your grandmas antibiotic.  This is a real drug that will carpet bomb the crap out of your system_ and yes...it will fix the problem_ but don't think it's a walk in the park.Mouthwash and mint gum for the bad taste.  Tea with ginger helps too.  Eat your probiotic yogurt at least 3 hours after you take the pill to help it repopulate your gut.  Take this stuff with REAL food - bread_ potatoes_ oatmeal_ pasta.  Add milk or ice cream to help with the nausea.  Drink water until you think you're going to explode_ and at least one cup of Gatorade per day for electrolytes.I hate taking antibiotics_ but recognize when they are needed.

I guess in VERY RARE cases they can interact and that is what the Doc believe happened with me. That or I have a sensitivity to it. I took 2 Biaxin pills and @ Prednisone pills last night and 1 Biaxin and 2 Prednisones this morning.

She has been unable to sleep_ and has bad tummy pains.  It tastes so bad that she has an extremely hard time taking the drug_ and she vomits during it because she is gagging so hard (liquid medication).  I know have to take my extremely sick child_ back again to the doctor tomorrow_ which is traumatizing for her_ to try and get a different prescription.

Some insomnia_ but quickly remedied taking a OTC sleep aid at night.  I find that any weakness or lethargy I've been feeling is quickly remedied by exercise.  It sounds like a lot of people have had a bad experience with Biaxin_ but I'm keeping a positive attitude_ taking my probiotics and exercising daily to get through this.,I'm taking this medication with 1000mg of Amoxicillin twice a day.

286, 5, Sinus and ear infections,The only negative side effect I had was the heavy metal taste.,I have struggled with ear infections my entire life and have taken so many antibiotics! There was a six year time period in my late thirties that no sooner than I would get rid of an ear infection_ I would get another. I later found out I was highly allergic to the horses I worked with on a daily basis. Apparently I was  NOT allergic to Biaxin as it seems others may have been_ as for me it was the best antibiotic I have ever taken. Many of the other antibiotics had a tendency to depress me_ especially when taken with sinus drainage medicines. I actually felt relatively good while taking Biaxin and it always was the most effective for my ear and sinus infections. The only problem I have today is that having taken it so many times_ it has become less effective. As for the negative side effects listed on this site for Biaxin_ they pail in comparison to Cipro and some of the other antibiotics out there. I have just found out the hard way the many side effects of Cipro / Ciprofloxacin_ etc._ and they are scary! As for my experience_ Biaxin is the best I have takin for effectiveness. You just have to live with the taste.,M,55,  1X D,2/13/2011,Biaxin

I had no clue this was a side affect until I looked here and on the internet.  I am stopping this now.  I do have a history of some anxiety and mild depression issues (not sure this matters_ but thought I would mention).  I knew about the bad taste and can deal with that.  But NOT these dreams.  My husband even said I was wimpering in my sleep (I was actually trying to scream in my dream and most of the time I could not).,I am quitting this now.

Erythromycin had worked for her in the past but we were informed that the pharmacy could not get the syrup anymore so the doctor switched the prescription to Pediatric Biaxin. This experience was absolutely horrible for our whole family. She was vomiting every night. We quit taking it on day three and will never take it again.

Woke up in the middle of the night with the most horrible taste in my mouth which made me want to vomit and gag.  It was so bitter as if I had eaten 20 white grapefruits in 10 minutes.  Still the following day being tired as hell from not getting any sleep there was a sour taste in my mouth.  I warned people at work.

297, 1, Sinus infection,I have a history of depression and my current medication had it well controlled_ that was until I took Biaxin. I started crying on day 4 and got worse every day.  I thought I was having another breakdown_ until I read this site.  I have stopped the medication on day 6.  Hopefully I will be back to normal soon.  As far as the sinus infection it is mostly gone just a little sniffle left.,If you have and history of depression I would not advise taking this medication.,F,43,10  days500mg 2X D,1/23/2011,Biaxin
298, 3, throat infection,Some mitral flutter (primarily upon resting)_ unpleasant taste in the back of the throat.,I have a mitral prolapse_ so I am pretty aware of what is going on with my heart_ and the only hard flutters I noticed came at night when I would lay down to go to sleep (I shot bolt upright in bed last night).  There is a distinctive metallic taste emanating from the back of my throat as well.  My advice to those whose opinion of the medication will be swayed by the reviews on this site: proceed with caution whenever taking a review to heart.  Different medications do different things for different people_ and what may hurt you may not hurt me in the least.  If you suffer from a documented heart condition_ I would recommend that you consult with your physician regarding any anxieties you may feel about taking Biaxin.  Also_ remember to introduce plenty of probiotics into your system (i.e. yogurt or probiotic supplements)_ as clarithromycin kills even the good bacteria in your body.  I am surprised that for all of the complaining I have encountered on this site_ nobody has offered that piece of advice.,M,28,10  days500 2X D,1/22/2011,Biaxin

300, 1, Flu/throat infection,I started taking this medication 3 days ago and did not have a reaction until now. I was taking Gravol for the nausea so I think that is what was making me fall asleep. This is the first night I have taken this medicine without Gravol and can NOT sleep. I tried to fall asleep but was sort of half asleep and half awake. I had extremely weird dreams_ had very weird crazy thoughts_ and hallucinations. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack_ I started thinking I was going to die. I have NEVER felt this was and can NOT believe what this drug has done to me physically and mentally. Not to mention the sleep deprivation is driving me insane!! The illness has gone_ but I think that the fact I was already on another antibiotic prior to this one plus time is what has healed it.,NEVER EVER EVER will I take this medicine again! I will make sure that my son also never has this medication prescribed to him as I could never imagine someone I love (even my worst enemy) to feel this way.,F,25,7  days 2X D,1/18/2011Email,Biaxin
301, 2, Sinus Infection,Always tired_ not feeling all there_ poor sleep with panic attacks_ anxiety and racing heart or simply like my heart was pounding harder (which someone else checked my pulse and noticed it was). Feeling like I was losing a grasp on reality and I was going crazy. Feeling hopeless like I would never improve. Afraid to go out and do things for fear of a panic attack in public. Wanted to stay close to home. Mood swings (felt very bipolar - either too happy or inconsolably miserable).,I had the physical side effects the first night - stomach pains_ cramps_ and bad taste but I was prepared to deal with it. They subsided. Around the 4th or 5th day I started to feel more and more out of sorts. I wanted desperately to stop but having had a sinus infection for over a month I thought what's 5 more days? Now I'm at Day 9 and my mind feels out of my control. Can't stop worrying. So I've decided to ease my anxiety by promising myself to never take another dose again. Sinus infection feels like it might be clear but one more day won't cure it if it isn't. It could however make me go crazy and that's worse than a sinus infection. Horrible drug.,F,30,9  days500 2X D,1/15/2011,Biaxin

They were not nightmares_ but still strange. It took me about 2 hours to fall asleep and each time I woke up from a dream it took another hour or so to get to sleep.

306, 5, sinus infection,The only side effects I've noticed are tiredness come drowsiness_ a slight loss of mental alertness_ and a slight decrease in apetite...plus the inevitable mild oral and intestinal side effects (the latter of which I'm trying to counter by eating yoghurt). Maybe if I was flying an aeroplane or driving a train the tiredenss/drowsiness might be an issue_ and in my case I've decided not to drive a car until I finish taking the course of tablets. I'm surprised and interested to learn that people have such significant reactions to antibiotics. I haven't taken antibiotics in over 20 years and have forgotten what they're like_ so they're sort of new territory for me. So far they're doing a great job on the sinus infection. I no longer feel in its grip_ as if it were sucking away my vitality like a malevolent (non-medical) leech.

I knew Biaxin had a reputation of having bad effects on your digestive system_ so I took Acidophilus to ward anything off_ but I still wound up having bloody stools after 5 days.

It took over 18 hours for the pain to subside.  The ER doctor could not find anything else wrong and said that Biaxin can be very hard on the stomach.

Like other writers have said if your infection is bad enough to be on this drug you should deal with the side effects but if you have A mild infection and were prescribed this it seems to be almost criminal.

After 5 days on these meds my back is smooth as a babies bottom and for the first time no itching. When you have been itching for 20 years these detrimental side effects are more than acceptable in my case.TIPS.Do not take meds at night.Start your regiment in the morning with breakfast. This way you avoid the crazy ass night tremors... although there is no escaping the insomnia it seams.Take with Yogurt to avoid the runs. The med destroys all bacteria.. even the good one that promote healthy digestion. You need to replace those good bacterial. I recommend Yoptimal with dual probiotics.other than that... remember.. this med is the equivalent of a Bacterial NUCLEAR attack!!If your doc put you these very strong meds.. you probably need to suck it up get it done.Finish your meds.

I have RSL_ fibro and a history of stomach ulcers but never had a problem with Biaxin at 250MG and I will continue to ask my doctor for the lower dose each time I get a sinus infection_ which is every year.

I am not sure I was diagnosed correctly.  Before seeing the doctor I had a 24/7 headache for 5 days and a hacking cough. The day after starting this drug my headache finally went away_ but the cough got worse every day. I saw no reason to continue to take a drug that was having no positive effect. I felt shaky and weak and a couple times I suddenly lost my balance.  I was particularly annoyed with my husband and I think this might have been from the drug.  From the beginning I took an acidophilus capsule every time I took the drug_ and I ate 2 containers of yogurt (without artificial sweeteners) every day_ so I did not have any digestive symptoms other than one day when I accidentally ate yogurt with Splenda_ and that day I had horrible attacks of bloating and gas.

Wanted to know if anyone else had felt the latter effects. I have chronic infections due to rheumatoid arthritis & fibromyalgia.

I will continue taking biaxin as it does kill the infection with the first dosing and I can go at least 5 -6 mos before another infection starts somewhere else.

Day 3 - repulsive bitter taste in my mouth (what I can only compare to possibly sucking on an aspirin all night). Also an awful headache.,I also thought I had taken this antibiotic for a previous infection_ but now I know for sure I haven't.  The side-effects are the worst I've ever experienced from any drug.  The bitter taste in my mouth woke me up during the night - I thought I had accidentally put my fingers near my mouth while sleeping (I had nail polish residue on my fingertips).

I kept my BP monitor near me. Severe Stomach Pains_ Chest Pains_ Difficulty Breathing_ Depression_ Crying for no reason_ I wanted to kill myself because of the pain it caused.,April 2010_ I was prescribed Biaxin for an H Pylori infection which I did not have.  I was misdiagnosed.  I had to take 2 500mg pills twice a day for 10 days.  After day 5 days on this pill I was rushed to the Emergency room 2 times and missed work everyday I was on the pills.  The bad side effects of the pills incapacitated me to where I couldnt work.  My doctor took me off the pills and placed me on another regimen of pills.  Which 2 days later I was told to discontinue because I did not have H Pylori. Within 3 days of being off Biaxin_ I couldnt breath right and my throat was closing up on me with swelling.  Biaxin killed all the good bacteria in my body and now I had to deal with Thrush a yeast infection in my mouth and lungs.  Im still fighting it with probiotics_ yogurt_ garlic_ organic cranberry juice and it is helping me out.  But I thought I was going to die.

384, 1, acne/rosacea,Painful speech_ swallowing_ choking off upon speaking.  Incapacitated now because of symptoms.,First_ it was an inappropriate drug choice for my condition.  I took it with probiotics for several years without a problem_ right before going to bed.  When I ran out of the probitotics_ I delayed buying more.  I'm not sure how much time passed; maybe a couple of months.  After singing a bit out of my range one night_ (I'm a performer_) I developed serious pain upon any kind of vocalization_ far longer than should have occured.  Months went by without change.  My ENT was confused_ but said that voice strain couldn't have caused so much damage.  (I saw a voice coach who couldn't understand it either.)  The doctor tentatively diagnosed acid relux_ which I'd never had before.  I spent three months on Kapidex (now renamed Dexellent_) and was greatly improved.  Then I sang out of range again and totally relapsed.  Was improving on Dexellent when I was placed on doxycline for something else_ and now my voice is worse than ever.  That was several months ago.  I haven't spoken in over 10 days; it's just too painful.  Can't socialize with friends or go anywhere.  I suspect Biaxin either burned my throat or created reflux or yeast problems.  I just hope I can heal again_ or my life is pretty much over.  Never take any antibiotic without acidophilus/probiotics_ and never take them before bed.  Always drink a full glass of water.,F,58,3  years250 mg. 1X D,5/2/2010Email,Biaxin

I had a very congested chest_ heavy and very irritable cough_ was started on amoxicillin by my doc but after 3 days my chest was getting worse so went back and was prescribed Claricid.  Started feeling some improvement after 2nd day on claricid_ and quite a lot better by day 5_ still have 2 days left in course.  Have still got some irritable cough but my chest much better than a few days ago.  I've been eating one or two kingsize pots of live yoghurt each day throughout the course_ I've had no diarrhea.

391, 4, H pylori infection,Dizziness/disorientation_ metallic taste in mouth_ poor sleep_ racing heart_ chronic headache.,I have been on this medicine previously for sinus infections so I knew what I was getting into--thought very strange that an antibiotic could cause these types of reactions--particularly to my mental state/sleep.However_ the cure FAR outways the illness--was vomiting non-stop for three weeks prior to this and lost 20 pounds in three weeks.  Have been on short-term diability for a month due to H pylori....so fortunately_ I do not have to work while dealing with these symptomsAs mentioned before_ probiotics and lots of yogurt have kept the GI symptoms mostly at bay.,F,47,14  days500 mg 2X D,4/12/2010,Biaxin

Biaxin has helped a little bit with my sinus infection and post-nasal drip_ but the side effects are making me just as miserable_ if not more_ as I was when my sinus infection was at its worst.,I'm only on day 3 out of the prescribed 15 days.

394, 1, Bronchitis,Nausea.  Unease.  Panic attack.  Extreme fatigue.Would NOT recommend.,Horrible_ very potent antibiotic. If you absolutely need to take BIAXIN (I was on Biaxin XL_ 2 pills once daily) please buy a probiotic like BIO-K to replenish the flora in your intestines and lessen the side effects.  This is suggested for all antibiotics_ but for Biaxin I think its absolutely necessary. Very good probiotics are expensive but it will lessen the side effects and mitigate the fact that the antibiotic is killing every bit of good bacteria in your body_ which can result in some of the very scary side effects. If you can_ do what I did and ask your doctor for something else - there is always an alternative antibiotic.  I dont know why they continue to prescribe this_ I suppose it is effective at killing bad bacteria_ but it seems to be too strong.  No other antibiotic that i've researched (amoxycillin_ penicillin_ cefprozil_ Azithromycin aka Zithromax or z-pack) has nearly as many horrendous reviews- 3 people have actually died and about 30 were hospitalized in the recent past. Biaxin XL seems better than regular Biaxin_ and the generic sounds like POISON. Do your research_ but with my experience and readings_ I would go with something else right away_ DO NOT WAIT for more intense side effects_ and NEVER GIVE BIAXIN TO A CHILD_ NEVER.  Please take probiotics if you are on antibiotics_ if you cant afford them_ buy yogurt and eat it constantly - starting about 3 hours after your antibiotic Good luck and warmest wishes for good health.,F,38,1  days1000 1X D,4/9/2010,Biaxin

The metallic taste likely contributed to my nausea.  I tried masking it in numerous ways_ none of which helped longer than a few minutes: mints_ cinnamon gum_ fireballs (super strong cinnamon candies)_ citrus candies_ pretzels_ lemonade_ lemon in water_ pomegranate juice_ and salt water mouth rinse.  I slept one night with cinnamon gum under my tongue.

At first she didnt know she was doing it and now she cries and says she ""has to_ I cant stop doing it"". It seems to be more frequent while doing homework & watching TV.

As with any antibiotic_ it will kill all the good bacteria in the gut_ so you need to suppliment with probiotics either in pill form or yogurt. Do this every day to rid the stomach cramps or diahrea. I'd rather suffer a few days myself with a few side effects than be admitted to the ER. I still cough at night and during the morning when it's hard to wake up. I find I drink a lot of fluids during the day too. And I still have my appetite. Everyone is different_ we all have reactions as our systems are not the same.

Not normal for me although I have had anxiety and depression before. This was like the same horrible feelings... all I could do to just stay there... but onset suddenly and with no real triggering factor. I also had a feeling of unreality probably because I was spending so much energy keeping my emotions in check. My cough is gone_ so it did work_ thus my rating of 2_ but you'd think that with all the prescriptions doctors write for depression and anxiety meds_ which myself_ I don't take_ they might think to ask when you go to a clinic_ if this might be a problem??

So_ the doc put me on Biaxin because of its ability to go intracellular (Lyme hides insides your cells)_ and I've been feeling much_ much better.  It seems to be doing the job without causing me any side effects other than the aftertaste_ which is so minor that it's totally worth dealing with it if I'm feeling so much better.And I've had the pleasant side effect of not having had a sinus infection in months (I usually have at least four a year).,F,29,5  months,10/11/2009,Biaxin
465, 3, Sinus infection,Severe headache that will not subside. Lethargy. Chest pressure.,I was prescribed this for the first time instead of Zithromax and I still don't understand why. I paid $70 for a 10 day supply and I am stopping on day 5. I cannot handle these headaches-debilitating. Spoke to a different doctor who told me to stop ASAP.,F,38,5  days,9/24/2009,Biaxin
466, 2, upper respiratory infection,worked at first; then progressively became allergic,started with metallic taste in my mouth (which the doctor said was a rarity); helped stop the coughing and take away the infection; but the longer I stayed on it the worse some of my symptoms got.  I ended up gasping for breath with my chest muscles tight squeezing my lungs and my throat closing up.  The doctor refused to believe an allergic reaction; but I took some antihistamine and all of it went away; when I took the next dose after feeling normal - my throat started to close up within 10 minutes of taking it and my breathing was labored.  Definitely not something to mess with.  I won't be finishing it and am including it on my allergy list.  This was a sneaky one so it almost seemed as if my symptoms were being caused by what I had_ thankfully I had some perscription antihistamine on hand to counter it_ OTC Benadryl didn't help.,F,37,5  days,9/23/2009Email,Biaxin

Dangerous lack of appetite In the week I think I may have consumed about 2_000 calories and lost 10 Lb.,This medication was not cheap 50$ Canadian for 14 pillsThe first 2 days I experienced headaches_ dizziness and fatigue as well but that very well may be due to the infection more than the medication.,F,26,14  days,9/20/2009,Biaxin

Today after the second dose I have severe diarrhea with blood in the stool and the stomach pains are worse.,I plan to just see the urgent care doc who prescribed tomorrow to get a different medicine. IF ANYONE ELSE HAS THESE SYMPTOMS PLEASE STOP TAKING THE MEDICINE & CALL YOUR DOC FOR AN ALTERNATIVE.

479, 3, Bronchitis,Metallic_ gross taste in my mouth on the last day I took it (7th day). I felt as though I had minor diarrhea throughout the week_ but I wasn't eating much while I was sick so it could have been worse. 3 days after I stopped taking Biaxin XL_ I started to get mini pimples all over my chest_ shoulders neck and face. I don't have an acne problem so I'm 99% sure it's due to Biaxin as nothing else in my routine/diet has changed.,It seems to have cleared up the bronchitis_ but the side effects are quite uncomfortable.

Not even a bad taste in my mouth besides what the infection was causing.,I was checking on the drug to see if it was also used to treat an ear infection because I think I might have one as well. Found this website with mostly bad reviews and figured I should add a positive one for potential uses of this drug. 3 days ago I could hardly stand up due to severe pain in the back of my head_ jaw and throat. Doctor prescribed this and within 8 hours was up doing house work and on day 2 was out of the house feeling 80% better.

Not everyone has a bad reaction to a medication and I caution anyone that comes on here and warns people not to take a certain drug.

Nurse at drs' office said it was an allergic reaction to it.  Guess I will add it to the ones I can not take (like any form of penicillin) Took about a week to fully clear the stuff from my system (this was not the generic form either) I just wonder if I would have had hives from it too if I had not been taking my Zyrtec for my allergies too.,F,39,7  days,5/6/2009,Biaxin

I suppose it helped prevent a secondary pneumonia_ but these lasting side effects are difficult to deal with.

I started noticing I was getting better after the 2nd day. The side effects started immediately after I took the first pill. I could deal with the metallic taste and even the mild abdominal cramps. What I hate is the insomnia (which started on Day 3)and the nervous feeling at night. If you have to take this pill_ then I suggest taking it with food (it won't give you an upset stomach with food). Will I take it again??? I would probably try it again.,F,28,7  days,3/31/2009,Biaxin

I see that for some it seemed to go away rather quickly while with others it persisted.  I will never take this drug again.

Blurry vision and tiredness.  Sticky sweat at night and have to get up and eat yogurt to rid the nasty taste in my mouth.  It kind of cracked my tongue down the middle and then it had a whitish coating.  I don't like this med.  It makes me feel tired and grouchy and sad and nothing tastes right even coffee which I don't even enjoy drinking and I love coffee.  I took 2x a day 500 mg. twice daily.,F,34,10  days,3/14/2009,Biaxin

Pounding head_ heart felt like it was beating in my head_ felt extremely anxious_ antsy after taking it and then feeling like I couldn't move_ hearing things_ loss of appetite_ red_ flushed face_ tingling hands_ major insomnia.,I have missed a whole week of work with just the side effects. I am sure this is helpful for some people_ but I am never taking it again. I have never had such a reaction_ I thought I was going crazy. I was so glad to see others experienced similar problems and that I was not imagining it.,F,36,4  days,3/13/2009,Biaxin
524, 2, Sinus Infection,Really really horrible taste in mouth_ extreme hunger_ and terrible gas pains,Taste was so bad after three days that I got another prescription for Keflex_ but it didn't do anything for the infection so now I'm back on the generic clarythromycin. The hunger is awful too because I can be extremly full and still have strong hunger pains. Wouldn't recommend it unless you really have to have it.,F,19,7  days,3/13/2009,Biaxin

526, 5, Sinus Infection,Thanks for this website. I believe I discovered why I had a great experience with Biaxin 3 years ago and why I am having a horrible taste in my mouth_ coated tongue and just unpleasantness this time. I'm using the generic! I'm going back to the pharmacy to exchange--I don't care if it costs more money. Biaxin is the only antibiotic that knocks out a bad sinus infection for me.,Try to avoid generic if you can. I think this is a very good antibiotic_ so put up with the effects if you can. They are temporary!,F,54,1.5  days,3/8/2009,Biaxin
527, 1, Chest infection,Biaxin was prescribed to my mother in June of 2002.  While on the medication she experienced sleeplessness_ paranoia_ anxiety_ confused thinking_ and a horrible taste in her mouth.  She also lost her sense of smell.  After she had finished taking it_ the side effects continued.  We went on a weekend trip in October of 2002 and while travelling she became very ill with severe nausea.  She began to vomit_ and it was pure bile.  When this began_ instead of going to our original destination I took her to the nearest hospital -- I didn't think she was going to make it there.  She was admitted_ bloodwork was done (which showed impaired liver function) and diagnosed with several large cysts on her liver_ three of which had burst and caused her symptoms.  She still_ at this point_ had the awful taste in her mouth that had started when she was taking Biaxin.  When the doctor asked me to list any recent_ new medications she had been taking_ I mentioned the Biaxin she had taken several months,I would never_ ever recommend that anyone take this drug.  Yes_ some people may not experience side effects_ but it seems as though those who do experience severe and lasting side effects that impact their lives_ and health_ in a majorly negative way.,F,57,10  days,3/8/2009,Biaxin
528, 3, Pneumonia_ ear and sinus infection,Largely psychological:  Anxiety_ depression_ paranoia_ hopelessness_ negative rumnations.  Possible loss of hearing_ though I cannot attribute to biaxin at this point.  My ear infection had reduced my hearing_ possible I'm just not well yet.,"I am so relieved to find I am not the only one who had emotional issues while on Biaxin.  I started searching today because I was feeling really hopeless.  I just couldn't get myself ""up"".  Even though I have some negative thoughts_ at least I can comfort in knowing they are probably due to medication and will resolve upon cessation.  I actually started the search to see if hearing loss was a possible side effect.  My wife lost most of her hearing due to aminoglycoside antibiotics (neomycin) and I was concerned that my hearing is not improving.  I found the emotional sides by accident and am relieved.  i thought I was going to need an antidepressant or antipsychotic.  While I certainly cannot say 100% it's due to the medication_ it's amazing an antibiotic could have this sort of effect.",M,38,9  days,3/6/2009,Biaxin

Slight insomnia,I am going to stop taking Biaxin mostly because of the horrible taste. the only reason I was put on this medication is because i broke out in hives last time i was put on Amoxicillin.

I liked the drug because it worked right away.  I had no clue that this medication was contributing to the symptoms i was having_ but now i realize the pattern.

Began to become paranoid_ hallucinate and had extreme anxiety and delusions.  I saw visions of myself dying and was having suicidal thoughts and desires to rage. I cried for 3-4 hours straight and felt complete insane.  I am a strong person and never expected a medicine to have such a negative effect.  The Kaiser doctor tried to say that suicidal thoughts were typically not a symptom but I have seen it on many sights!!!,I ended up in a pysch ward for the first time in my life.  I completely lost my sense of reality and admitted myself because I was worried I was a danger to myself or society.  This drug was HORRIBLE and we need to gather for a class action suit!!!

Sooo_ I filled the prescription_ took my first dose_ felt nauseous and went to bed.  Woke up with watery mouth and metallic taste.  No biggie_ I'm used the the metallic taste as I've taken Zyban before.  BUT_ I decided to check here and sure enough_ this drug is the one!  My old post is still here from when I took it in 2007 and felt so hungry I absolutely HAD to eat_ but I made myself sick eating too much_ yet I physically had hunger pains WHILE I was eating!  As I mentioned_ took Zyban a few times before and had diff side effects each time_ except the metallic taste always stuck.  Hoping this time around with Biaxin is different.  I'm a little worried since last time around 2 out of the 4 side effects I listed previously have already hit!

She was spitting constantly to get rid of the foul taste.  I stopped the medication after approx. 6 days but it tooks WEEKS to get over the bad taste in her mouth.

I'm on day three of 2 pills (500 mg each pill) daily for ten days and am able to breathe a lot easier. I had almost forgotten what it was like to breathe without restriction! My cough is productive now_ and my chest and diaphragm area no longer hurt. Like all meds_ they are prescribed because the doctor feels it is more beneficial to you than its side effects. As for the mental health issues_ I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety_ was medicated for it over a year ago_ and this med has done nothing to bring that out. If anything_ I'm happier that I'm actually getting better and am not too bothered with the bad taste in my mouth. That bad taste lasts only for a few hours after the dose.

A couple hours after taking the medication I started vomiting_ experiencing horrible diarrhea_ an enormous headache that lasted all day.  I slept all day just to recover from the medication.  The symptoms were worse than my original ailment_ so I was urged by family and friends not to take it again.  I feel better without it.

568, 4, Chronic sinus infections,Funny taste in mouth_ seemed to make my blood sugar drop significantly (I am hypoglycemic),I had been on two doses of augmentin but my sinus infections kept coming back over the course of several months.  This actually cleared the infection almost immediately although my doctor prescribed Biaxin for 4 weeks.  A warning to all_ steroids and z-packs that I had previously been prescribed actually leech your bones and make them brittle.  If your side effects are just moderately troublesome on this drug_ it is certainly a better alternative to steroids which are the only other thing that has worked for me in the past.,F,26,4  weeks,1/20/2009,Biaxin

Day 1 I had no side effects at all. Day 2 mild metallic taste in mouth but bearable_ very sleepy all day and spacey feeling.  Day 3 HORRIBLE matallic taste_ unbearable_and was worse when coughing_ was constantly snacking and drinking trying to get rid of taste. I found that peanut butter and crackers help alot with this. Also when I would blow my nose_ it would smell like an ashtray_ coming from that taste I believe. Day 3 very nauseated_ wanting to gag but never vomited. Metallic taste still very bad but as the day went it got better. No appetite all day.  The rest of course of medicine was bearable. No more nausea after day 3. Metallic taste persisted but not as  bad as day 3.  Biaxin did clear bronchitis(and I had a very bad case) and it cleared the sinusitis too. I would reccomend this drug_ the side effects are tough but not as bad as the bronchitis I had.,F,26,10  days,1/15/2009Email,Biaxin

But this time in addition to taste and stomach I got severe severe severe insomnia and night sweats. I'd finally fall asleep around 5am despite taking Xanax_ Ambien_ and Codeine_ all of which should have knocked me out!! I would wake up a few hours later soaking_ drenched wet with sweat from night sweats. Had to change clothes_ sheets_ etc. Got so dehydrated I picked up another infection...I stopped the Biaxin and the insomnia/night sweats went away.

Tightness in chest along with chest and back pain. Bleeding gums and constant nasal drip down throat during sleep. Loss of sex drive which returned towards the end of the perscription.,I noticed that after the 7th day if taking this drug_ I actually felt better like myself again_ however_ it was short felt as in the evening I experienced a most terrible pain in my stomach and the feeling of needing to burp but couldn't - this lasted almost 30 minutes then with a huge burp along with acid reflux my stomach settled. This is the first time I have taken this drug_ usually my doctor perscribes Amoxcillin to fight the infection caused by sinusitis/bronchitis_ however_ this time my doctor was away so I went to a clinic in my area where a doctor told me that this drug would help.

574, 1, Chest Infection,I am working on a website to help people who have been damaged by this drug.  Biaxin ruined my life.  It caused me to go crazy.  My heart was screwed up.  It ravaged my body.  It almost destroyed my family.  It took an entire year to shake off the mental effects of this drug.  Words cannot describe.,Do not take this drug.  Report your side effects if you do!

577, 3, Sinus infection/bronchitis,Dizziness_ stomache cramps_ pelvic (testicular) discomfort_ mentally hazy and distant_ diarrhea_ depression_ sadness_ helplessness_ constant cigarette smell and taste_ headache (maybe from lack of coffee).,I was given 24 days of Biaxin with 7 days of prednisone. I started getting shaky and pelvic discomfort immediately. My wife and I thought it was the prednisone because of how strong it is. I finished the prednisone and symptoms persisted and grew more severe. Relationship with wife suffered because infection cleared but was mentally absent. We researched and came across this site. This site made me feel less of a horrible husband. I stopped taking Biaxin after 12 days. Will never go back to it. It's a relationship crusher!,M,29,12  days,1/2/2009,Biaxin

I took it for ten days_ and my doctor should have given me something less strong. From day one I started taking the pills I knew something was wrong_ but my mother told me to take them anyway. My boyfriend noticed I would gte cranky_ and then I realized I was only like this after I had taken the pills. The last day I didn't take them with food_ I woke up in the middle of the night sweating_ feverish and had a lot of discomfort in my stomach. Since antibiotics mess with birth control_ I thought I was pregnant_ because after one and a half days I still had the nausea. I looked up this medicine just to see if my symptoms could be lasting_ and I found all these horror stories. I would advise someone to take an alternative other than this medicine!

580, 1, ,Extremely bad metal tasste in my mouth,The metallic taste is unbearable. I called doctor and she said to eat peanut butter or potatoe chips with the med. Surprisingly_ this worked. It is very difficult to plan potatoe chips or peanut butter into my pill regimine but anything is better than that taste. I am now worried about other side effect since reading these ratings. I already have the crying and will be monitoring myself closely for other side effects. If peanut butter won't fix those then I'm calling to get something else.,F,26,2  days,12/20/2008,Biaxin

582, 5, Sinus infection,Briefly: Abdominal pain (unusual for me)_ thirst_ some urinary hesitation. The abdominal pain resolved after the first four doses_ and none of these side effects returned the second time I took a course of Biaxin. I also experienced some CNS symptoms (panic_ crying_ and euphoria) on the first round_ but this could well be the effects of being sick so long_ which always throws a wrench into the emotional works.,Biaxin is a kick-ass antibiotic. I can't get over the extreme_ negative descriptions for this antibiotic here. Ordinarily_ I have a hard time tolerating antibiotics (sulfa and amoxicylin are out). Biaxin is probably the second-best antibiotic I've tolerated (Zithromax wins for this)_ and I'm on my second course_ 21 days this time. I did notice the metallic taste of ill repute that so many complain about. For god's sakes_ what's the big deal? You want a bad_ metallic taste? Try Zopiclone. Don't like the metallic taste? Suck on lemons or eat oranges. But stop complaining. All antibiotics have side effects--there's no such thing as a free lunch. Be glad you have something to treat your bacterial infection--before it becomes life-threatening.,F,44,6  days,12/12/2008,Biaxin
583, 1, lung infection (unspecified),I was fine for the first 3 days; I drank 12-20 glasses of water/day to try to mitigate the side effects_ and other than the horrible taste_ I was fine. On the 4th day_ I started to experience anxiety_ panic attacks_ and depression. As the day went on_ I also started to have racing thoughts_ manic behavior_ and verbal and physical tics (repetitive noises and motions_ i.e. violenty shaking my head back and forth_ slapping my hand on the desktop in a fast rhythm_ making nonsense sounds with my mouth or tongue_ etc) - very Tourettes.  I have not taken the drug for 48 hours now_ and most of it has gone away_ but I am still occassionally experiencing vertigo when I move my head too fast_ which is causing dizziness and mild nausea.,"The really bad part: 14 years ago I was given this drug (it was brand new on the market) and had a very similar reaction after 3 days (hysteria_ uncontrollable crying_ severe anxiety_ thoughts of suicide)_ but the doctor told me the medication could not be the cause of the side effects_ because it's an antibiotic and antibiotics ""don't do that.""  I'm glad to find out it's a documented problem_ and not just in my head.",F,35,3.5  days,12/12/2008,Biaxin
584, 3, Sinusitis,Update to my original post of 7/20/2007.  Additional side effect:  Phantom Smell.,"Approximately 1 month after completing my 14-day Rx of Biaxin_ I started smelling a cigarette-type smoke.  It drove me_ my husband_ and my co-workers crazy for the 2+ months it lasted.  I was constantly complaining of the smell and obsessed with finding where it was coming from.  I literally spent hours searching everywhere for the smell.  I went to see my Primary Care Physician_ who referred me immediately to an ENT Physician.  The ENT scoped my nasal sinuses and thankfully found nothing (no infection_ tumor_ etc.).  Through further discussion of my history_ the ENT said it was highly possible the phantom smell was caused by the Biaxan since I had also experienced the bad metallic taste in my mouth.  Within a couple of weeks of my ENT appointment (11/15/2007)_ the ""phantom cigarette smell"" started getting weaker and went away.  Prior to this incident_ I had never experienced phantom smells.  I also never had nor currently have any type of mental issues.",F,44,14  days,12/10/2008,Biaxin

I've had barely any sleep.. it feels like my mind is just racing constantly yet my body is exhausted.",I'm hoping to God that I can stop taking this medicine.  I've been fighting this sinus infection since around August_ having about 5-6 so far. I've taken other prescriptions for this and they have worked_ but I've only had to take them for only 10 days. I don't think I can stand this medicine (500mg x twice a day) for another 17 days (21 total) It really helped cure the sinus infection_ but the side effects are worse.,F,16,4  days,12/4/2008,Biaxin
586, 1, whooping cough,Severe wind_ hunger pains_ fatigue (sleepy).,I switched to clarithromycin from erythromycin after 1 day  because of bad side effects with the latter. With the clarithromycin I had read the warnings on here so did the following_ which has helped:Took the 2 daily doses with big meals (breakfast and evening meal)Took a supplement of acidophilus capsules (from Holland & Barrett)to replace the good bacteria antiobiotics kill off.Ate some bio yogurts such as Activia and Muller Vitality.There hasn't been much I can do about the tiredness but the gastric problems have been tolerable thanks to the precautions I've taken.

Foul taste in my mouth kinda like hairspray you know the smell of hairspray and how it clings to your nose and taste buds? Exactly like that. Unusual gas some sharp stomach pains,It helped the first time I took it I was on it for 5 days I have chronic bronchitis but not severe enough to get an inhaler it worked the first time like I said but my bronchitis came back 3 weeks later more harsh than before and I am now on day 5 of 10 yes they made Me take it longer hopefully it helps more than before but so far it has only made my coughing go to a minimum and I can now breathe although my voice still sounds like my nose is plugged when it clearly isn't and I still have coughing spells just not as much as before so it is working and isn't? All I wanna know is last time it was gone by now and I still have another 5 days to take it... If it doesn't go away I think I'd rather have the inhaler and sinus meds? This taste is horrible oh btw for people who can't get rid of the taste for long...don't brush mouth wash or anything it hasn't helped GUM is your savior with this drug haha it has gotten Me through it so far although after you stop chewing the taste will come back,F,19,5  days,11/14/2008Email,Biaxin

604, 3, STOMACH BUG AND CHEST COLD,I am on day three of a seven day course of 2x500mg of Clarithomycin tablets. From first tablet - nasty foul taste in mouth all the time. Waking up about four times a night. Not sure if it is effect of tablets themselves or foul taste waking me up - but the taste cannot be ignored. Constantly snacking on anything which will mask the taste. So far nothing seems to help. Mouthwash seems to make it even worse. Toothpaste doesn't even help. Actually requested alternative from Doctor_ but now am wondering if the alternative might be as bad as these tablets. Not yet experienced any of the other side-effects other than a craving for milk and cheese - not that they mask the taste for long.Some-one on this site mentioned the same craving. I am trying peanut butter tonight - as someone on the site suggested. Even though I don't think I will ever take these foul tablets ever again - they do seem to be really powerful and have cleared my chest and tummy bug.,I explained the side-effects of these tablets to my Doctor_ but she hadn't heard of these problemsalthough they are mentioned in the literature which comes in the packet!She tried to convince me that it might be the ailments causing a bad taste.

620, 2, Bronchitis,For the first few days it was only diarrhea and metallic taste. Then I had difficulty breathing_ chest tightness and panic attacks.

I have taken Biaxin XL in the past and do not recall having any problems.  Sometimes a generic is just very different than the brand name drug.

In E.R._ shallow breath_ low BP_ vomiting_ diarrhea_ stomach pain and cramping_ dehydration (I  couldn't keep water down).,I will never take this drug again. I truly believe had I taken a second dose I may well have died.  I've always tolerated antibiotics well_ but not this.  Also avoid Zithromx (Azithromycin) and other drugs in that family  (it did the same thing to me after a physician failed to listen to me in the ER regarding the Biaxin - I ended up back in the E.R. within 30 hours after taking the Zithromax).

The biaxin made me very_ very light-headed constantly_ made it hard to do schoolwork_ constantly out of breath. However_ it has made my cough become shallow and dry. Legs and hands constantly want to move (i.e. Jittery) and the smallest change in environment makes me feel sick. Also_ chest feels light and inverted. I would recommend Azithromycin.

632, 1, Sore throat,Started out as a small case of sore throat. First day I took it my mouth tasted like I was eating metal. I had a very bad metal drip in the back of my throst. I was always feeling faint. Didnt sleep for 41 hours finally when I did fall asleep I slept for 5 hours. On the third day of taking it I expericed extreme dry mouth even after drinking tons of water. I felt very weak and out of it. The metal taste was so bad in my mouth that I could not eat anything and I wasnt hungry. My ears became clogged up bad. I had developed all the symptoms of a cold (runny nose_ chest cold_ deep cough_ sneezing) That night I was in so much pelvic pain it made me fall to the floor and cry for thirty minutes till the pains gradually went away.. My left abdomen was sore to the touch and had sharp pains. I started noticing the symptoms of a yeast infection and I had almost orange colored urine. Biaxin made me so shaky that I could not hold my pen still.,"So finally the forth day of being on it I couldnt take it. Went to a different doctor because my syptoms were so bad. The doctor checked me out and diagonosed me with two major ear infections_ yeast infection_ gastritis(inflamation of stomache lining)_ and all the major common cold syptoms. The doctor told me that all of what I was feeling was because of Biaxin and that he never perscribes that because the side affects outweigh the problem. He told me that Biaxin will ""eat"" up your stomache and put you in alot of severe pain and sickness. Now I am out of work for three days and I have to get a lot of rest.It seems like me with Biaxin that if you are treated for a condition like an ear infection you will have all the side affects except ear infections. And I was treating a sore throat and yeah the sore throat went away and I ended up with about every other symptom you could have.

Never heard of an antibiotic causing such syptoms.  I only took it for 2 days.  I did help with sinus infection_ but not worth dealing with the other issues.  I have never experienced a reaction like this before.  Symptoms started to improve about 15 hours after I took the last dose.

This medication began to work the day after I took it. I mean_ I had minimal symptoms of a sinus infection left! It is very powerful! I had sinus surgery in April 2007 due to chronic sinusitis and this is my first sinus infection since. I had taken regular Biaxin in January 2007 but it did not cure my sinusitis.

I have sleep apnea and this drug made it worse. All I could do was to concentrate on ""breath in breath out"" if I tryed to think of anything else_ I would stop breathing. The night went by in 45 min cycles of five minutes awake and 40 minutes of an unconscious trance. I would drink water and alternate to a family room recliner for my next session of zombie land. It became a real possibility that if I did not concentrate on breath in breath out_ I might die. I could not focus on objects or words.",The side effects of Biaxin were worse than the Sinus Infection. After one day I was switched to Amox-Clav. It turned the infection to liquid gunk and drained it into my stomach which caused me to through-up three times during the night_ but I understood why I was throwing-up because my brain was fully functional again. I take my pill with plain yogurt to help protect the lining of my intestines as good bacteria is killed off. My appetite is back.,,,1  days,11/27/2007,Biaxin

She said it was likely bronchitis and the antibiotics were likely to do the trick. If they did not work I was to come back in. I told her several times that I had VIRAL pneumonia the last time.  I understand the logic of trying antibiotics first to see if that wipes things out and then going from there - but not with this medication!

Also felt sort of out-of-it at times_ but that may have been from the lack of sleep more than anything else.,"It worked fast to clear up my infection_ but the side effects are really unpleasant and completely unexpected (I wasn't warned about ANYTHING except the possible GI upset).  I would have preferred to take something else_ even if it might have taken longer to resolve my illness--I think I'm going to have my doctor add this on my ""allergies"" list.",F,35,10  days,7/11/2007,Biaxin

Did not cure the infection.,I was on Biaxin for about 5 days (out of 7) and just couldn't take it anymore.  I never experienced such a rancid taste and smell in my life.  Total insomnia.  I did not sleep even one wink for all 5 days plus 2 more nights because it was still in my system. On the 5th day I experienced horrible hallusinations of pigs & a piano flying into the living room.  All the curtains flew around.  My husband had to convince me the house wasn't haunted.  I tell everyone including the dentist that I cannot take Biaxin.,F,36,5  days,7/11/2007,Biaxin

Has Abbott possibly changed formulation or manufacturing process on Biaxin in recent years? This stuff has been around since 1991 and should be proven and stable_ but the quantity and nature of comments here are scary. The drug sheet talks of the typical few percent having side effects_ this site suggests a possibly much higher incidence. I know this ""ain't statistics"" but look at say Doxycycline and the number of patient comments vs the comments on Biaxin_  relative to the official reported incidence of side effects. I've been off Biaxin for two weeks now and this may be coincidence. But for about a week I have had a weird numbness_ feels odd to the touch_ on the skin of my left arm above the wrist.

But not enough to stop.This time has been very different.  I was on a 7 day course I stopped with 1 1/2 days left to take.  Everything started after the third day. All symptoms have gotten progressively more severe with each dose. Symptoms have been a lot like other peoples.  Sever lack of appetite_ I have lost 10 pounds in a week (not a diet I would recommend)_ decrease saliva_ metallic taste_ chest tightness_ shortness of breath_ night sweats_ abdominal pains (I have IBS so I can not be sure which one is causing that)_ upper back pain and lower back pain_ strange itching/burning sensations on skin_ sleeplessness_ increase in depression and anxiety.

775, 1, False positive pertussis test,This medication ruined the first month of my summer when I got home from freshman year of college.  I came home feeling not like myself_ sinus headaches at night_ swollen glands.  For some reason my doctor tested for pertussis aka whooping cough and when it came back positive freaked out and placed me on this satan drug! (to this day the experience still haunts me a year later) AFter research we found out the type of test used was not accurate for whooping cough so I went on Biaxin and after two pills broke out in a full body rash that despite steroid injections in my butt and ungodly amounts of predinose lasted three weeks and messed up my skin even longer_ it was thin from all the steroids.  It took into the fall for my face and body swelling from the predinose to go back to normal.  In pictures my face made me look like I weighed approx. 190 lbs instead of 145.

I'm not too happy with the results so far because it doesn't seem to be clearing my issue up the way Bactrim or another antibiotic would. Fortunately_ I haven't had any other wierd side effects besides the bitter mouth thing.,If you're prescribed this I'd recommend insisting on something else from your doc/PCP.

But this time (500mg twice a day) I had panic/weird images at bedtime and couldn't sleep until early morning. That was the first night. Also became weak_ tired_ shaky_ weepy_ anxious and depressed. Next night still anxious and had creepy thoughts that didn't seem mine_ almost demonic.

I've had three hellish nights and didn't think it was the Biaxin until last night_ because I never had any trouble with it before.

It was extremely helpful in the beginning for my persistent sinusitis_ but over time it has become less effective due to the significant number of times I have taken it.  I know that a lot of people hate it and cannot tolerate the side effects_ but if you can get past them (it usually only lasts the first few days for me and then I'm fine for the next month or so that I'm on it)_ it's worth it because this drug works and it works FAST!

802, 4, Sinus Infection,Some mild stomach cramping and abdominal pain,Just to clarify_ alcohol does NOT inherently act badly with this drug.  We had a party last night and I had several beers with no reaction at all.  In fact_ it seemed to alleviate some of the abdominal pain.  However_ this is an antibiotic and as such alcohol will make it non-effective.  It did seem to not be working_ but that seemed to be due more to the smoking in the bar than the alcohol_ as when we switched to a bar that didn't allow smoking I was fine.  Additionally_ sleep was somewhat restless_ but not any more so than any other time I have had a reasonable amount to drink.  Not trying to disprove any of the below comments_ but for an average person that has not really experienced any side effects_ alcohol in moderation should not be an issue.  On the other hand_ this did clear up my infection shortly after taking the first dosage so it really works_ though it is strong.  My dosage is 500mg.,M,23,3  days,3/31/2007,Biaxin

I also could barely relax and close my eyes to sleep or stay asleep very well.  As well as a bad taste in my mouth.  I have never had such bad side effects from an antibiotic before - doctor's should DEFINITELY tell you about these possible side effects.  I would rather wait and see if this sinus problem will go away on its own.,WILL NEVER USE AGAIN!!!,F,32,3  days,3/19/2007,Biaxin

I WENT TO MY DOCTOR CAUSE I WAS FEELIN LIKE THIS AND SHE PUT ME ON ANTI DEPRESSANTS..

808, 5, sinus infection_ ear infection,horrible metallic taste in mouth that lasted the entire time I was on it_ some nausea_ slight fatigue_ intense dreams,I would definitely recommend Biaxin. It quickly cured my sinus infection and ear infection after I had already tried another antibiotic before being prescribed this one. The side effects are worth it!,F,21,10  days,3/17/2007,Biaxin
809, 5, sinus infection,Bad taste in mouth,Bad taste in mouth_ drinking CRANBERRY JUICE will help with this side effect.,F,39,10  days,3/16/2007,Biaxin
810, 4, Sinusitis,"Very FOUL taste in mouth throughout entire day and while sleeping.  Have tried gum_ candies_ mints_ strong juices_ even slept with a mint in my mouth to try and overcome the taste to get some sleep. Taste so bad that it induces nausea and the sensation of needing to vomit.  Additional noted side effects include anxiety_ heart palpitations_ diareha_ stomach cramps_ and loss of appetite.  Feel very ""keyed up"". Thankfully my doctor put me off work for the week due to an additonal eye infection_ don't think I would have been able to work while taking this medication.",Helped with sinus infection almost immediately_ however the side effects definitely will be a consideration if this medication is needed in the future.  They are almost intolerable_ given that there may be alternatives.  I would not allow my 3 year old to be prescribed this medication unless absolutely necessary.,F,36,4  days,3/16/2007,Biaxin
811, 1, skin infection,Anxiety_ heart palpitations_ awful trembling_ confusion_ nausea_ lack of appetite_ diarrhea.  Am currently on Xanax ER .5 mg daily for generalized anxiety.  Biaxin totally negated its effectiveness.  Went to ER last night (2:30 a.m.) and ER doctor told me there was no relation between the two_ so I should continue taking it.  NO WAY!  I wouldn't take one more of those horse pills if you paid me.  Going to try to get on another antibiotic.  Sadly_ doctors don't understand that patients who have a history of anxiety-related illnesses have a higher sensitivity to any drug that induces anxiety.  Will never take this medicine again.,,F,43,3.5  days,3/13/2007,Biaxin
812, 5, H pylori,First two days severe anxiety_ crying_ bloating_ and heart palpitations. I was ready to stop the drug.  Then on day three it all cleared up_ now I am hardly bloated (before I took this drug I looked 6 months pregnant.)  No anxiety or depression anymore_ was told by someone that the anxiety and depression in the beginning is the bacteria trying to fight the drug.  Slight metallic taste_ but its worth it. Worst side effect for me was that I had so much energy I couldn't sleep much and switched day to day from being extremely huingry to having zero appetite.  However_  Stick with it if you can.,,M,21,14  days,3/12/2007,Biaxin

Basically has kept me from my normal activities.,prescribed XL for 7 days..have 3 more doses to go! Dramatic_ fast cure of sinus infection. The side effects are horrible_ but I've not had anything clear my sinuses this quickly before. Before taking again_ I'll definitely talk to the doc about alternatives.

Doctor wants to see me today after learning about rash.,The rash is a real mess given that I work in a professional environment and look like my chin and neck are messed up. The rash feels a bit like 'prickly heat' but looks like red welts and white-heads. Gross. I feel a little feverish in the rash areas also. The medicine did seem to make my thoughts stranger than normal_ and I'm still experiencing waves of fatigue even though I'm sleeping enough at night and it's been 2 days since my last dose.,F,37,7  days,3/6/2007,Biaxin
818, 1, H Pylori Bacteria,My 9 yr old daugther was taking a triple therapy treatment which included 500 mg of Biaxin twice a day for 14 days for the h pylori bacteria that causes ulcers. After 3 days of this med she broke out in itchy hives all over her body_ her head itched and we had to give Benadryl_ she still itched though rash went away_ only to come back every night and its been 6 days since she stopped the Biaxin and Amoxicillin_ though still taking Prevacid.Previous scripts of Amoxicillin proved no allergy to it.  She had horrible cramping_ crying fits at night over her stomach and the docs have her on Levsin for the cramping which is minor now but still there. She is to see a specialist soon about the bacteria which needs to be killed in her stomach. I would never take this med! She ate all the time_ has mouth sores on the inside of her bottom lip and felt very weak also. This is a scary med for sure.,,F,9,3  days,3/6/2007,Biaxin

822, 1, Upper respiratory infection,I thought the horrible gas was bad enough. But then the depression started and then I started having Nightmares_ terrifying_ I have never had nightmares as frightening as these!  I am afraid to go to sleep. I cant imagine giving this medication to a child and having them go thru what I have been thru for 3 nights in a row.,I would not take it ever again.  Just because you dont get the side effects on the first day doesnt mean anything mine started after I was on it for 4 days.,F,44,7  days,2/28/2007,Biaxin
823, 4, bronchitis,I did notice some loose stools (solvable_ see comments) and that weird taste people mentioned_ but both were mild and tolerable. Had trouble sleeping....I'm on day 3 of a 10-day dose,"Okay_ so read the site--very helpful and I have more info for you. I couldn't sleep so i'd been taken tequila shots as part of my OTC ""medication"" (along with mucinex_ lozenges_ etc). My mom mentioned it might be counteracting the drug so I called the pharmacist. She said it DIDN'T have problems with alcohol but it DID have a problem with grapefruit juice. I hate grapefruit juice_ so I don't care_ but I'm sure a lot of people down the stuff while they're sick for the vitamin C. Also_ I read someplace else that eating yogurt while on Biaxin can help with the diahrrea--I started eating yogurt and it has_ indeed_ helped.",F,37,3  days,2/24/2007Email,Biaxin

828, 1, asthma/flu - possible infection,I have been on Biaxin for 6 days now (1000mg)- with one more to go.  I am NOT taking the last day.  After finding this website I almost cried (still may) - I honestly thought I was losing my mind.  I have experienced the awful taste in my mouth - that I could live with.  It was feeling like I am on the edge that has bothered me the most.  My BP sky rocketed to 165/90 - not normal for me.  I feel shaky and panicky all day - worse at night and I've been taking the biaxin at night.  I have been worrying that I would never be able to manage my life again - so I am hopeful after what I read here.  I am not normally like this and I really just have this feeling like I need to be admitted to a hospital where I can be by myself and get a grip!!!  I am so grateful for the input of others and to see that I have those exact symptoms.  I've never reacted to a drug like this - and it is subtle so you think it's you - not the meds. I will never take it again.,,F,36,6  days,2/22/2007,Biaxin
829, 5, Bronchitis / Ear Infection,Diminished sleep_ tightness in the stomach,Generic_ 1000MG daily (X 10days).  Felt significantly better after first 24 hours_ no metallic taste_ slight sleep disturbance_ overall seems very effective so far.,M,57,2  days,2/21/2007Email,Biaxin

831, 4, Bronchial Infection,I'm taking 500mg twice a day. Terrible taste in my mouth when I wake up but goes away with gum and tooth brushing (glad I found this site and am not alone - I thought I had a tooth issue or something!); vertigo & dizziness when I lie down or first wake up; crazy dreams and nightmares (I don't mind that though). I haven't had the insomnia everyone mentions but I am also taking a cough syrup with codeine and I finally don't wake up every hour coughing. I am normally moody and anxious and haven't noticed an increase in that! I take it with large meals to avoid the stomach trauma (which I am prone to).,I am on Day 4 of 10 and noticed after Day 1 or 2 that my cough was diminishing significantly_ so despite the bad taste and dizziness_ it's working.,F,33,10  days,2/21/2007,Biaxin
832, 5, Pneumonitis/bronchitis,"I started taking this drug 1000 mg/day and didnt read any of the info on it or the side effects.  In the beginning I was so sick I didnt care what I took but then noticed day 2 that my mouth was getting sore_ and had a terrible ""lick the floor"" taste in my mouth.  By the time I was finished taking the meds the top layer in my mouth was completely gone and I had thrush...so I really didnt notice that I was getting well from my pneumonitis/bronchitis quickly because I was in agony from having a sore mouth.",Read instructions that come with the drug...very important.  It does have a bad taste shortly after taking the drug and acid reflux.  I thought that the drug was causing severe acid reflux that it was coming up my neck and burning my tongue off!  Turns out that it is very hard on your mouth and tongue....so..my advice is to take with food_ rinse your mouth_ and eat foods that soothe your mouth...bottom line...if you can survive the harsh treatment that this drug does to your mouth_ it does great for other infections and you should recover quickly.....after finishing the drug for more than a week_ my mouth is still sore.....but I survived the pneumonitis/bronchits....which I didnt think that I would.,F,40,7  days,2/19/2007Email,Biaxin

Postive thoughts.,People if the pennies in mouth taste bothers you_ cinnamon_ choclate_ lemon_ and sour are all flavours that help mask it. My dreams were very vivid_ happy_ and very revealing. I belive that the drug does effect dreams_ however I think the tone of the dreams might have to do with the individual and their circumstances rather then the drug itelf.,M,29,5  days,2/13/2007Email,Biaxin
834, 1, Ear infection,I am a mental health counselor_ who has never experienced clinical depression. After taking this medication for 7 days_ I actually had true suicidal thoughts.  I was more anxious and depressed than I ever thought possible!!! I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG AGAIN! It should be a crime for any doctor or Physician's Assistant to prescribe this medication without clearly warning patients about this possible side affect!  I thought I was going crazy; had I realized it was from this medication_ I would've discontinued it immediately...who would think an antibiotic could do this to you???,Yes_ as everyone else has said_ terrible metalic taste and crazy vivid dreams!  However_ compared to the other aweful reaction_ that was nothing.,F,33,10  days,2/5/2007,Biaxin

836, 5, sinus infection,metallic taste_ nausea_ lethargy,For the metallic taste just drink something or chew some gum. It's not permanent_ people.  To forego this medicine b/c of that taste is pretty weak.  Nausea is fleeting..again_ test it and see:  does eating make it better?  find the food that works for you or refrain from food that adds to this feeling.  Sleep is a little disturbed_ I'll sleep soundly for a few hours at a time.  AGAIN_ Biaxin is only prescribed for short periods of time_ disturbed sleep won't last forever. If you are prone to yeast infections-talk to your dr. before being prescribed ANYTHING as penicillin_ and variants_ are ALL blamed for yeast infections.  Biaxin is effective_ it does it's job..end of story.,F,32,4  days,2/2/2007,Biaxin
837, 2, sinus infection,Had no side effects except slight metallic taste. After the 10 day treatment (Biaxin XL 500 mg : 2 tabs every morning WITH breakfast) I had no relief at all...EVEN WORSE...it turned into a very bad bronchitis. As a retired pharmacist (age 71) I conclude that I did not give any chance to the product_ since my breafast consists of : cereals & 1 heaping tablespoonful of ground linseed or flaxseed_ plus one toast_ often with 1 or 2 tsp of that ground seed sprinkled on it. Conclusion : ground linseed aborbs the Biaxin and prevents it's normal absorption by the system and the product cannot do its job. I have to see my doctor to discuss about this fact. Medecine users should beware of ground seeds taken with medication. Please note that this is a personnal opinion.,Biaxin XL is a great product when used properly...,M,71,10  days,2/2/2007Email,Biaxin
838, 5, Sinusitis & Strept throat,Truly AWFUL taste in mouth_ like metal; headache; occasional nausea; fatigue; difficulty concentrating; trouble sleeping; many nightmares; very painful yeast infection,Although this medication (1000 mg/day) did get rid of my initial infections_ the side effects affected my daily life and habits. I found relief from the bad taste by constantly chewing cinamon gum (IT HELPS!). If you are prone to yeast infections with antibiotics_ this medication will give you very painful ones. Sleepless nights were hard to take after a few days. Lack of concentration_ and fatigue (although I was tiered when I was sick as well). In essence_ this medication is a very effective antibiotic_ but there is room for improvement from the side effects!,F,19,7  days,2/1/2007,Biaxin

840, 4, Bronchitis/possible whooping cough,Terrible bitter taste from the pills.  Much worse at night; to the point that its waking me up 3_ 4_ 5 times a night.  Don't know about insomnia but I have not been sleeping well since the taste keeps waking me up.  Sugarfree gum seems to help during the day.  Other effects: slight nagging headache and very slight abdomonal discomfort with the first dose.  The most unbearable side effect is definitely the foul taste during the night.,It seems to be working.  I kind of think that my doctor may have been a bit too aggressive prescribing such a strong drug.  My husband who is a med student said it may have been but he understood why the dr. prescribed this rather than a milder antibiotic due to an outbreak of whooping cough in the area.  Makes sense.  I feel great; my chest is clearing and the painful coughing is subsiding. Just got to grit my teeth and deal with the taste.,F,27,5  days,1/30/2007,Biaxin
841, 1, Pneumonia,I took this medecine for a pneumonia I had in march 2003 (was 21 yo)_ the day after I started the cure with Biaxin Bid I had inflamation all over my face. Oddly_ the pharmacist was not preoccupied by this matter since it got better even if I continued to take it. In fact_ these where the symptoms of a glomerulonephritis obviously triggered by the drugs. Then I was hospitalized for 3 weeks and I had to take Procytox and Apo-Prednisone for 6 months to help me pass over all this mess.,Really_ do yourself a favor and ask for something else.,M,24,3  days,1/30/2007Email,Biaxin
842, 1, pneumonia,The biggest problem for me is the buzzing in my head and the pounding in my ears.  I do have stomach pains_ anxiety_ crying spells.  The pnuemonia is gone_ but I would try another antibiotic.  Fatigue and muscle pain.,I would not take it again.,F,63,7  days,1/30/2007Email,Biaxin
843, 1, Chest Infection,3 days in my only side affect was insomnia.  The medication was working and my chest infection was clearing up.  In fact I felt better almost the next day apart from the insomnia.  On the 3rd day (today) I had a tequila shooter.  I know... stupid but a friend was over and I wasn't thinking.  30 minutes after that one shot my system felt like it was doing a polar reversal.  I told my wife I had to lie down.  I never suffer from anxiety but now i know how it feels.  I dosed off and woke up 30 minutes later.  I actually though I might die today.  Throughout the rest of the day I've been very out of sorts.  It's now 1AM and I thought I might check the internet for info on Biaxin and alcohol and I found this site.  Now I know I'm not alone.,Hopefully tomorrow the anxiety_ insomnia and the feeling that my heart is racing will subside.  If not I'm going off this drug.  Moral of the story DO NOT MIX BIAXIN WITH ALCOHOL OR YOU'LL REGRET IT!,M,43,3  days,1/30/2007,Biaxin
844, 2, sinusitis,Severe insomnia leading to anxiety/depression.  I endured the entire 10 day course; had trouble sleeping with first dose but blamed it on sudafed.  Stopped the sudafed but the insomnia worsened and my mood plummeted.  Didn't mind metallic taste but the insomnia/depression were devastating.,It knocked out the sinus infection but I will have to be a very sick person to ever take this again.  Wondering how long before the unwelcome side effects of anxiety_ insomnia and depression will last.  Rating this a 2 only because it cured my sinusitis.,M,52,10  days,1/15/2007,Biaxin

Thank goodness it is the weekend_ as I can sleep as much as I want.  It does make me feel tired but worth it.  One thing the posters should think about is the generic form.

Thought I'd just been overdoing it this Christmas_ but after reading the entries here_ it seems not.,This really needs higher profile when presribed.

I also feel detached from my body and teary.  I came to work today_ but didn't feel like coming at all.  Thank God I'm off tomorrow and can spend the weekend feeling terrible.  The side effects are extreme but cleared up my bronchitis symptoms within 24 hours.,Despite the terrible side effects_ the quick relief from my bronichitis symptoms has so far been worth it.,F,43,2  days,1/4/2007,Biaxin

Went off thinking i was ok and felt totally weird_ bad headache in back of neck_ sweating and just out of it..wondering if when you go off you get worse side effects,Very strong_ does work_ you need a strong stomach or a will to keep taking it AND you better just wait for those yeast infections..probably the worst ever had...

854, 3, Pneumonia,I_ too_ have the bitter taste in my mouth but that is nothing compared to the disorientation I am experiencing.  I am spacey_ off balance and I am having a terrible time trying to concentrate enough to put this in writing.Not only the above but I have been awake all night long and it is now 9:00 am and I don't feel the least bit tired.  With pneumonia_ I should be getting as much sleep as possible but I was unable to even get 5 minutes of sleep.To top it off_ my left jaw has started locking since I started this prescription yesterday.  My ear is horribly sore_ even though my doctor took a good look at it yesterday_ he saw nothing.  I was fine until I started the medication.  It makes me wonder if I should be continuing.  I'm putting a call into my doctor's office to find out for sure.This is the second prescription I have taken because I was not getting better on the other antibiotic.  As a matter of fact_ I was worse after a full week than when I started.  I don't want to,By the way_ I have taken it before with absolutely no side effects other than the bitter taste in my mouth.,F,57,2  days,1/3/2007Email,Biaxin
855, 1, bronchitis,The horrible taste by itself would be tolerable - it's the other nasty side effects that make this drug so awful. I'm on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen and I'm more miserable now than I was with the bronchitis. I have a constant dull throbbing migraine headache_ terrible pain in my neck that makes it hard to turn my head_ night sweats_ insomnia_ fatigue and the mother of all yeast infections. On the bright side it cleared up my cough/etc in about 2 days; unfortunately now I have to deal with the problems the Biaxin caused...,I DEFINITELY do not recommend taking this drug - if you have ANY other option take that instead. Also - my doctor and pharmacist NEVER mentioned the mental health side effects - I have been treated for depression for years_ and if I'd have had any idea about the possible serious mental side effects I never would have taken it.,F,34,5  days,1/3/2007,Biaxin
856, 5, Severe recurrent sinus infections,HORRIBLE bitter_ metallic taste in mouth within 8 hours of the first dose.  Some upset stomach but just make sure you eat plenty when taking it and that solves the problem.,The drug really works_ and helped me when nothing else did_ but the bitter taste is really annoying.  I notice it all day long and during the night.  It is really bad in the morning.  Even mints and gum taste different due to the taste change and don't help for long.  If I wasn't seeing great results with the drug I would stop it due to the taste thing but I'm going to stick it out - I need relief from the severe sinus symptoms.  Most importantly_ I didn't find the bitter taste listed as a side effect on anything I was given or on any of the drug websites...it should be just so people will know they aren't imagining things!,F,41,5  days,1/1/2007,Biaxin
857, 5, couph_ chest pain_ horseness,Awful bitter taste worse during first couple of nights_ but I decided to stick with the medicine and got used to the unpleasant taste.,I was suffering from voice hoarseness_ post nasal drip_ and later couph_ chest pain and shortness of breath for over 6 months. The doctors first treated me for GERD_ then for allergies_ but the symptoms persisted in spite of the treatments. Finally_ I was prescribed Biaxin 500mg twice a day for 10 days. I started feeling better after 3 days on the medication_ but my symptoms cleared completely two weeks later. It was a miracle drug for me_ since I almost lost hope that I could be cured.,F,54,10  days,12/26/2006,Biaxin

859, 5, Yes,Weird taste in mouth,I had an awful sinus infection. Really painful and exhuasted.  Started taking Biaxin on Monday morning and by Tues AM was feeling alot better.  By Tuesday night felt almost 100% and Wed energy was back to normal and congestion/sinus pain was gone.  Don't usually like taking anti-b's but these really did the trick.,F,34,14  days,12/24/2006,Biaxin
860, 1, Sinusitis,I have already posted once to this rating a couple of days ago_ but I am now getting more of the side effects others have described. I have been taking BIAXIN for 5 days. The muscles in the tops of my legs are aching and seem stiff when I walk. I have virtually 100% insomnia_ and I now get sweaty with the slightest exertion. I have had anxiety so badly at times that it felt like an out-of-body experience_ abolutely surreal and above all frightening.,My sinusitis has not cleared up at all yet and my chest has worsened. Simply put these are the worst side effects I have ever experienced in my life from medicine. I saw another post saying never again - I echo that_ NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!!!,M,42,5  days,12/24/2006,Biaxin
861, 4, sinus infection/bronchitis,A terrible metallic taste especially when I woke up (so much so that I checked out this website to see if anybody else had).  Also_ remembering dreams in vivid details every night.  I must say it did clear up my bad bronchial symptoms and did the job.,I guess I recommend it.  It definitely knocked the infection out.  I wonder if there's a drug that does the same thing without the bad taste_ but of course that's a minor price to pay for 7 days to get better.,F,43,7  days,12/23/2006,Biaxin
862, 4, Sinusitis,I have been taking this now for 2 to 3 days. The side effects are terrible for me. I have no stomach problems_ yet_ but I am am having anxiety attacks_ feel depressed_ almost tearful_ disorientated and dizzy. I do not fee like driving. Frankly_ I feel compeltely out of it. It may eventually get rid of my sinus infection_ but I am not sure the side effects are worth it!,,M,42,3  days,12/23/2006,Biaxin
863, 1, severe sinusitis,Any and all!!!  Anxiety_ bitter metallic taste in my mouth_ felt like I had ants in my veins_ upset stomach after eating_ constant hunger pain_ mild to moderate diahhrea_ extreme thirst_ fatigue_ not wanting to do anything_ sleepiness_ isolated dizzy spells... I thought I must have some horrible disease!  I was beginning to think that maybe I had leukemia or a panic/anxiety disorder or something!  Took me a while to figure out it was the Biaxin_ but trust me_ I will never take it again. The feeling of not knowing what is wrong with you when you are on medication that is supposed to be helping you feel better is absolutely frightening.,,F,45,14  days,12/23/2006,Biaxin
864, 1, Possible respiratory infection,Terrible taste_ upper body pain_ vertigo.  I have now been offthe medication for almost three weeks and still have a bad tastein my mouth.

865, 1, Bronchial Infection,Terrible Metallic taste (could hardly get it off anything) 4 days after suspending use flavor still remained_ in a lesser degree. Constant urge to urinate_ this subsided one day after suspending intake.

868, 4, bronchitis sinusitus earache,Minimal stomach pain on ingestion even with food.  Was prescribed 2 pills once a day with food so took them 1/2 hr apart which solved that problem for the most part.,Have had better results with this medication than any of the penicillin group.  Within 48 hrs felt 100% better.  Would use again.  Noticed a few here listed 10 day programs.  My doctor has me on 14 days.,F,40,3  days,12/19/2006,Biaxin
869, 4, whooping cough,Very bad metallic taste but after 12 days my coughing is finally improved. Wierd postnasal drip after the 9th day accompanied by a very sore throat (I think from whatever makes that nasty taste). Mouth taste is almost unbearable in the am. Also gagging/ nausea when brushing teeth in the am. I thought it was just from the taste_ but it sounds like others have experienced this too. No probs with drinking wine with this_ as other writer stated. No nightmares_etc. I also think that if you're sick enough to take this_ that's probably why some people are feeling so tired.,After reading the posts on this site_ I'm calling my dr to see if I can stop this.  I must admit I am almost well_ but why not try some other antibiotic w/o the awful side effects?,F,45,12  days,12/16/2006,Biaxin

871, 2, suspected bronchitis,the same as everyone else.  metallic taste was horrible.  couldn't sleep.  I think Biaxin may have been responsible for increasing my fever as well.,I don't know if this had anything to do with biaxin_ but I started taking it because I had a constant low-grade fever.  After I started taking the drug_ the fever spiked higher more often_ and became much more difficult to control.  Of course_ it didn't help that I couldn't get a good night's sleep while taking this stuff_ so my immune system was shot.  Stopped after 3 days (against doctor's orders) and feel much better for having done so.,M,32,3  days,12/8/2006,Biaxin
872, 5, Sinus Infection. Bronchitus,Metalic taste _ some stomach upset if I have an empty stomach_ fine if I eat_ sleeplessness_ fatigue,I am allergic to all antibiotics except this one. It is a very strong medicine_ and the tste of metal can be annoying...and you can also get a yeast infection from the drug..BUT after the first few days of almost feeling like the infection is being killed in my body _ making me feel a bit worse_ I feel a heck of a lot better..also if I have a yogurt every day_ and keep food on my stomach I feel much better. Biaxin XL is esier on my stomach than the twice a day pills.,F,26,10  days,12/7/2006,Biaxin

I think it definitely helped but I've also used a saline sinus rinse twice daily for the last eight days plus I've increased my water intake so probably a combination of all these things has helped me to get better.,F,27,8  days,12/6/2006,Biaxin
874, 3, Bronchitis,Cramps in stomach_ metallic taste in mouth_ total insomia -- they should say on the warning label to not take it at night!  Loose stools and ok_ this is embarassing -- the most foul smelling gas.  have a general feeling of unease.,Ive been taking the 2 tablets of the 500mg XL version for 3 days now and still have chest congestion_ but my lungs dont hurt nearly as badly as they did.  Although the stomach cramping is taking the place of that pain.,F,39,3  days,12/6/2006,Biaxin
875, 2, sinus infection,yeeeOUCH!!!! Worst yeast infection ever on these drugs! regardless of taking the probiotic yogurt everyday_ and the one time pill for curing yeast infection. Horrible taste in mouth all day_ all night - only time it subsided was when stomache was digesting a meal. Yes_ it is helping sinusitis...but can't something else do the job with out these effects?,On top of side effects_ I forked out at least $100.00 CAD for this discomfort between yeast treatments and Biaxin cost.  Standard erythromyacin (sp?) is worth about 50 cents!!! Argh. Broke and in pain...,F,36,10  days,12/5/2006,Biaxin
876, 1, Sinus & flu Symptoms,Felt dizzy and disoriented_ light-headed_ jumpy_ shakey_ and disconnected from all around me.  I experienced sweats and increases pulse rate. My speech quicken and I weaved when I walked. Counter to most others on this site I lost my appetite. However_ I did experience the same metal taste discussed by others. It felt like I was on a hallucinagentic where eveything was moving around me_ I was distracted by anything_ and my interactions with others felt alien.,Went to my doctor after 2 days to switch antibiotics.  Though my doctor did not disclose these side effects_ I contacted Medco and the pharmacist was able to validate that dizzyness_ disorentation_ vertigo and shakes are documented side effect of the drug.  I am sure it kills bacteria_ but at what price?! FYI_ this is the first time I have had an adverse reaction to antibiotics so I am clear it was due to the Biaxin and not just a general reaction.,F,47,2  days,12/5/2006,Biaxin

I am on two 500mg doses per day_ this sinus infection has been around for two months and did not respond to other antibiotics. Went to my niece's wedding and relatives asked if I had been in a fight!

Instead of briefly mentioning this in the ""rare with no incidence reports"" section_ they should move the warning up and state that you should seek medical attention immediately if you feel depressed! My son was very close to suicide.

The toilet and I have become close friends but that seems to come and go. I also seem to have slight pain in my legs but not sure if it is from the Biaxin. I am taking 2 500 mg tablets a day for 14 days,I had constant mucas in my throat the doctor said it was post nasal drip. We tried allergy medicine and a couple different antibiotics done worked. He then prescribed Biaxin after about 3 days I did notice some improvment and now after 6 days things seem to be getting better but not gone. We will see. Also I do have an apointment with a specialist just in case there is another problem that we may not be aware of.,M,54,6  days,11/25/2006,Biaxin
882, 2, Throat Infection,Very odd sensation of numbness throughout my body. If someone touches you_ 'desensitized' is the best way to describe it. You feel pressure_ but nothing on the surface. Dizzyness of varying frequency and duration_ fear (irrational or not) of stopping breathing or heart failure should I sleep.,Works as an antibiotic_ but the side effects are somewhat frightening and I wouldn't suggest taking it where other options exist.,M,32,10  days,11/25/2006Email,Biaxin

YUCK! I knew that was a side effect so that was fine ..I just drank lots of water.I also began to experience horrible annoying headaches. Then on the 4th day I started to experience heart palpitations and anxiety attacks....very scary feeling!! I also noticed that I was becoming depressed and moody....not good at all. I then began to get some stomach upset. Heartburn and Gas. On Day 5 I decided I had had enough and called the doctor and told her I was not taking anymore and had her give me another antibiotic that I had already taken in the past. WOw...I will never take this drug again!! That was a horrible feeling and still is as I am sure it is still in my system.....just hoping all the symptoms disappear fast. Glad I found this site as I now know I am not the only one that had these side effects. I'm sure it is a po,Only got to day 5 before I just stopped the drug....too many weird and scary side effects for me. I am very sensitive to medication and this was way too much for me! I will not take this drug again!,F,36,5  days,11/24/2006Email,Biaxin

Finally stopped taking it after 5 days. PLEASE DO NOT take this antibiotic if you have a history of anxiety or depression - this risk needs to be noted more clearly in the adverse reaction info. I learned this the hard way. I am still having issues after being off of it for over a week now.

I was told to eat a LOT when taking it_ which I did_ but after I was done with my prescription_ it still affected my stomach and made it feel ""warm"".  It also affected my eyes_ in that my contact lenses became less comfortable as I was informed that the antibiotic leaves your body through your pores_ your feces and urine_ as well as through your ears_ nose and eyes - this explained my uncomfortable lenses and the deposits which had formed on them.  This antibiotic is said to affect all senses (taste_ hearing_ you name it).  I am allergic to both sulfa and pennicilin_ which is why I was prescribed Biaxin.  If my situation  had not been quite grave (swollen leg and fear of flesh-eating bacteria)_ I would definitely not have taken this aggressive medication.",,F,36,10  days,10/30/2006,Biaxin

898, 4, sinus infection,First time on this drug. Never had sinus infection before_ and this one seems nasty. I am experiencing sleep disturbance and anxiety but I'm prone to that anyways_ so not so bad. No metallic taste_ as almost all others have said. Some stomach issues_ but I'm only on day 3 (of 7days). The dreams are vivid_ as others described_  but no nightmares.,I will have to say that this drug is working. I feel that my sinus passages are clearing up (thankfully - the mucus that came out of me was DISGUSTING. Never want to experience that again). Have read this drug is used for acne. I'm prone to that too so hoping this will clear it up (for a while anyways). As for others saying that they are near-psychotic - I've witnessed someone full-psychotic_ and your side-effects aren't even close. My intention is not to diminish your side effects_ but to put your feelings into perspective. Wishing all good health.,M,40,7  days,10/22/2006,Biaxin

Called the pharmacy and they told me that those side effects were not as a result of Biaxin.  Thanks to finding this site_ I know I'm not alone.  It's amazing how many people are having side effects that are not well known... pretty scary.  Stopped the medicine on Day 4.  It is now day 5 and the pain is subsiding... tingling is still there_ but I'm hoping it will improve soon.,It really did kick the sinus infection right away_ but certainly not worth the problems it causes.   If my infection comes back_ I'll use zythromax!,F,40,3  days,9/16/2006Email,Biaxin
912, 2, Upper Resp./Bronchitis,Dizziness_ restlessness_ vivid dreams_ dry mouth,I am on my 5th day of a 10 day run and I feel like crap...I feel worse not than what I did before.  I did have a very vivid dream 2 days ago_ but it was not nightmarish.  I am very sleepy and anxious all at the same time.  Sweats here and there and just utter exhaustion.  No yeast infection_ (YET) ad hopefully I won't get one.  Last year I had bronchitis and took Keflex and it worked great without all these horrible side effects.,F,32,10  days,9/15/2006,Biaxin
913, 3, chronic bronchitis,shortly after taking biaxin_ I started feeling weak and dizzy.  Then the metallic taste came.  Sweats and shakiness all day and night.  inability to sleep and vivid dreams or nightmares.  I have been addicted to alcohol and suffered withdrawal and DT's and this is pretty much the same.  my doctor also has me on prednisolone (the dose pack) and I wonder if these 2 drugs are interacting.,I quit taking biaxin after 4 days--I've been off it now for 3 days and I still feel sick.  Am going to try the yogurt to see if it helps.  I am giving this medication a 3 rating as I am not sure if I should continue to take it.  Time will tell.....,F,50,4  days,9/13/2006,Biaxin

Very weak_ tired_ horrible metallic taste in mouth.,I have taken this before and do not remember feeling this horrible. Cost me $80.00. I do not wish to take it anymore.

916, 4, Pneumonia,Fatigue_ shortness of breath_ don't want to talk_ metallic taste a few minutes a day. By Day 4_ feeling very anxious and wanting to cry. Morning of Day 5-uncontrollable fits of crying (brief) and the urge to cry all day.,Medication worked on major sypmtoms like hot/cold sweating_ fever and incessant coughing.  At Day 5_ I'm an emotional wreck and have 5 days to go.  Cough is slowly clearing up. So glad I ran into this site. I thought I was on the verge of a break down.

917, 5, sinus infection,bitter taste especially when waking up_ one episode of vertigo that might have been from another medication - no nightmares or anything,I felt a lot better around the second day. The bitter taste is a little annoying_ but since the medication works_ it's something I don't mind dealing with. No psychological or digestive effects for me. I'd take it again.,F,19,10  days,9/1/2006,Biaxin
918, 5, strep throat,am now in day 4. i am at a loss. i am in a zombie state_ it comes and goes_ i dont want to talk_ i almost fainted_ rushed to the bathroom_ thought i would collapse any moment. in the morning i wake up and i can barely move_ can barely get off bed. then after 2-3 hours i start feeling better and then it comes again in the evening. mood swings_ fatigued_ red eyes_ i look pale_basically i look and feel like a junkie my wife tells me. i think thats it for me . never agin_ never.,never again_ NEVER!!!!!!!!,M,34,3  days,8/26/2006,Biaxin
919, 3, Extreme case of strept throat,Horrific metallic taste that gets worse as the day goes on_ heart racing_ inability to concentrate_ inability to fall asleep,I had the worst case of strept throat my doctor had seen this year_ almost to the point of having a hole through my throat. After the second day_ I was completely cured_ but my doctor encouraged me to continue. I couldn't_ the side-effects were almost as bad as the initial problem!!,F,17,5  days,8/21/2006,Biaxin
920, 1, Sinus infection,Bad taste in mouth_ increased blood pressure and heart rate_ itching_ rash_ stomach pain_ loose stools_ decreased appetite_ general crappy feeling.,Apparently I'm allergic to Biaxin_ at least that's what the ER doc said when he was giving me IV steroids to counteract it.  My doctor told me nothing about any side-effects at all.  Not only will I never take Biaxin again_ I'm going to switch doctors.,F,28,3  days,8/21/2006Email,Biaxin
921, 5, H. pylori infection,dry mouth_ weird bitter taste (sort of like sucking on alum)_ fits of anxiety_ breaking out into sweats occasionally_ slight delirium/blurry vision_ bad dreams_ horrible breath_ constant hungry feeling_ exhaustion_ shivers and tremors,I called my doctor after about 5 days of feeling like I was going to die.  My stomach was in flames and I couldn't eat or drink anything_ had horrible heartburn_ and my throat was so sore and swollen that I couldn't swallow even if I wanted to.  He prescribed this stuff.  Within 2 days I was eating solid food again and the sore throat was gone_ but the side effects never got better the entire time.  Nightmares got worse as time went on.  Same with dry mouth.  Drank gatorade constantly.  The anxiety was the worst_ I think.,M,22,10  days,8/18/2006,Biaxin

923, 5, Sinus Infection_ Bronchitis,"Dry Mouth_ Feeling ""seperated"" from the world_ Loose Stools",This is a wonder drug for me.  Take it_ suffer through 10-12 days of absolute hell on the toilet_ lose 20 pounds in the process_ drink water and still unable to talk due to dry mouth_ and feel like the last time iI smoked pot_ and feel better.  This drug does EXACTLY whatis is supoosed to do.  Given a choice of a Z-Pack (which has never worked for me_ no side effects but still...) or this_ I choose this.  This is a great medication_ FOR ME_ but I definitely know what the effects are when I do.  I get Biaxin_ I bouy stock in Proctor and Gamble_ it is that simple.

926, 3, prescribed after septum surgery,Biggest problem was the insomnia.  I haven't slept well since I started taking it. I also experienced dizziness and increased heartbeat (though that may have been a result of the vicodin pain medication I was taking a few days ago.)*I'm pretty young and don't take much medication_ so my experience may be unhelpful.,WARNING:I was really congested and thought that it would be easier to swallow if I cut it into tiny pieces. The taste was so horrible_ it didn't leave my mouth for two days.,F,14,1  weeks,8/7/2006,Biaxin
927, 5, bronchitis,"very strong bitter taste that increased in intensity over time_ extremely active & vivid dreams_ insomnia_ a bout of the runs_ and an overall restless_ ""on-edge"" feeling",got the most benefit from this antibiotic than i have with any other.  cleared severe symptoms by 80% in 24 hours_ it's not kidding around.  the side effects are very pronounced_ but i definitely would request this med again as a 'nuclear option.',M,29,7  days,8/3/2006,Biaxin
928, 3, sinus infection-chronic sinusitus,Horrible taste all day_ 24 hours a day_ starting from day 1. The taste is repulsive and no many how many times you brush your teeth and rinse you can tell your breath still reeks. I also suffered insomnia and loss of appetite. Other than that I thought I was in the clear until I woke on Day 6 and noticed swelling on my lips (down there~not the ones you put lipstick on) I started freaking out thinking I contracted Herpes or something....but I have been faithfully married 7 years and we were both STD tested before we got hitched and were STD free~ and my hubby's trust worthy....but I looked at photographs of herpes and gential warts and anything else I could find and it didnt look like that. It's really just like swelling. Today (day 7) it is worse. I am done and am hoping it will go away once the drug is out of my system. I was (in a way) glad to hear other people were suffering from bumps/swelling/rashes/ though mine sounds different. Anyone else have these issues?,After taking two ZPaks (those 5 day Zithromax packs) a 14 day round of Augmentan and then a 7 day round of Augmentan_ I still had a sinus infection. I had used Biaxin once before and it had worked (though I had started throwing up uncontrollably approx. 10 days into the 14 day prescription). But I was desperate this time....so I thought_ well maybe if I didn't take 10 days.....so I got a 7 day round and sure enough_ it worked_ but the side effects REALLY SUCK!,F,27,7  days,8/3/2006,Biaxin

931, 5, Lyme Disease,Bad taste in mouth especially first thing in the morning.,This is my 2nd round of Biaxin (6 months each time). This time it is easy and almost no side effects. The first year I took it I had a funny taste in my mouth all the time and occasional chest pain. The bad taste can be minimized by swallowing quickly and not leeting the Biaxin touch the tongue. The generic did not work as well.,F,45,6  months,7/24/2006,Biaxin
932, 1, Foliculitis,Do not take this drug. I have NO allergies and neither does anyone in my family. Biaxin within two to three hours of taking 500mg of this drug_ I could not tell up from down. Everything was spinning around me in very pretty tie-dyed colors. The only thing that saved my life is that I did not go home after going to the Dr. who was nice enough to give me samples that his pharmacuetical rep dropped off.My friends were so freaked out by my behavior that they called the Dr's emergency number - recieved NO HELP_ infact they were told this reaction wasn't possible - they then called poison control_ but they didn't have any advice either.I REMEMBER NONE OF THIS. In fact I can't remember anything until about 24 hours after taking the meds. Also for 36 hours I couldn't keep anything in my stomach_ even water and apple juice and gatoraid made be vomit. This drug put me into a coma/drug overdose state and if it hadn't been for my friends I would have fallen asleep and drowned in my own,"I have mentioned my side effects to three other ""Doctors"" and they have all told me I am crazy.Last year_ I met a woman who had the same side effects caused by this drug.",F,25,1  days,7/19/2006,Biaxin

Bad insomnia_ every time I close my eyes I would hallucinate the most awful images_ and got muscle twitches.,Would not recommend to ANYONE!!! I thought an antibiotic would be harmless_ this one has me absolutely terrified to take any future medication.,F,32,5  days,7/16/2006,Biaxin
934, 2, tonsillitis/strep throat,not much_maybe because of the low dosage i was on(250mg x2 a day) stomach pain and a hunger-like feeling and a very mild metallic taste the first few days. ,I was prescribed 500mg x2 daily_ but since i always get bad side effects from any drug i took half the dosage (250mg)instead.I know it wasn't a wise thing to do because i took it for 10 days twice in 3 month and it didn't do anything for my strep throat.I will see my dr. to prescribe a different antibiotic because i think the long use of such a low dosage made my strep resistant to it.,F,19,10  days,7/13/2006,Biaxin
935, 2, Lyme disease,Nasty metallic taste in mouth and stomache upset_ including_ pain_ nausea_ bloating_ and heartburn.  After 2-3 weeks began getting anxious and having trouble sleeping.  Almost 4 weeks in the anxiety peaked and had heart palpitations. Went to ER_ nothing found on all tests.  Told to stop taking biaxin.,I have stopped taking it and am getting some Xanax to deal with residual anxiety. Also taking armour thyroid_ do not know if that can cause palpitations.,F,34,3.5  weeks,7/13/2006,Biaxin

938, 1, Sore throat_ congestion,I did not get any sleep for 3 days. Dreams were very vivid (and I do not remember my dreams normally). A rash around my neck_ chest_ and back.,It did not seem to help ANYTHING. My sore throat went away after a little over a week_ which I believe is just natural healing. The rash is an after effect and I am hoping it doesn't last long_ as it is making me rather self conscious about my appearance. I would NOT suggest taking biaxin at all.,M,19,7  days,7/5/2006,Biaxin
939, 5, Brochitis-bacterial,I had some stomach upset.  I have also had a bad taste coupled with a dry mouth. The first three days I couldn't seem to drink enough and had very concentrated urine that burned.  I've also had some headaches. **  I am concerned because I am sweating way more than normal when doing very light activity.  I am overweight and have a tendency to head sweat--but this is ridiculous.  I got home today feeling hot and wet in my clothes.  I changed into a night shirt and it was damp in about 30-45 minutes---in an airconditioned room with a fan on.  Is this my body's quirky way of dealing with an antibiotic or a possible interaction due to taking it with ritalin (taken for ADD)?,Biaxin-xl 500 mg. X 2 for 10 days.  I'm currently on day 6.  The first day I didn't eat enough food with it and was nauseated.  I was miserable.  Drinking milk didn't help (maybe because it was skim?)  String cheese didn't help.  I finally ate some bread with butter on it and instantly felt better.  I think the oil in the margarine might have been the key_ since the protein in the light cheese didn't help.  Someone else mentioned taking it with peanut butter--both oil and protein there.  I have been taking it just after dinner and been fine.  However_ my appetite during the day is definitely diminished--a plus for me_ being what Doctors would call obese.  (Usually if I don't eat very much for breakfast/lunch_ I have hypoglycemic symptoms such as sever headache_ nausea_ and feeling weak.)  So far_ I haven't had a problem with that.   My energy level is getting back to normal very quickly_ too.  (Very important_ when you work 8+ hours a day as a preschool teacher).,F,34,6  days,6/25/2006Email,Biaxin

This time it was horrible and I'll never take it again.  Others who have not had these problems are lucky.  This drug made me feel like I was losing my mind.  I just found this website and now I realize why I have felt so bad for days and days. I almost had to go to the ER to have a cat-scan and spinal tap because my neck was so stiff from not sleeping and have had a sensitivity to light and sound.

949, 1, bronchial infection,I write this to give comfort to those who may have the same experience that I did; taking this drug is the single worst thing that ever happened to me. I have NO psyche history_ no history of depression_ and am a successful_ enthusiastic professional. After taking biaxin_ I had the most devastating and crushing depression and anxiety_ including totally irrational fears that I was going crazy_ crying spells_ and an inability to perform my job. I felt certain that I was going to die_ and had a number of physical side effects_ including pounding heart_ numbness_ insomnia_ and severe GI problems.,The symptoms lasted long after I stopped taking the drug. In fact_ the depression and anxiety lasted nearly three weeks after I stopped taking it. I cried more in those three weeks than I have in my entire life_ combined. If you have had anxiety and depression as a result of this drug_hang in there_ it will go away. Email me if you need support. My thoughts and prayers are with you.

Third day felt nausea in evening and couldn't get out of bed (took Gravol to combat). Fourth day was still nauseous and had no appetite so stopped taking it.

I do however have lightheaded side effects. And some stomach aches from the Biaxin.,I must say though I am the needle in the haystack here. I am the only person on here taking biaxin for a non pulmonary problem.

I did not experience the terrible taste in my mouth I was warned by my doctor about. I would also recommend not taking this drug unless you are very sick.

Brush/floss/Listerine three times a day_ keep your mouth clean and free of yeast. Take your pills at the same times each day and take them mid-meal_ not before or after. Take Acidophilus and Bifidus between 45 and 60 billion a day_ aids in maintaining a healthy ""gut"" and overall immunity_ and prevents opportunistic bad bacteria from taking up residence (candida_ etc.)  And one last thing_ dont read all the negative side effects_ your mind is a powerful thing and can send you into believing you have them all!

I thought there was something terrible wrong. Palpitations_ heart racing_ very anxious. Scary !! Sleep was not good - would suddenly wakeup with pounding heart.

In 48 hours_ I am feeling better than the day before_ but am just very tired from my illness.  Yes the side effects kind of freaked me out_ but taking Biaxin is 10 times better than the week I had with no medicine at all.

Drinking orange juice to control the metallic taste_ and eating a couple of active-culture yogurts a day.  So far_ the metallic taste is the only side effect.

My sore throat improved but I felt very nauseous and then started having episodes of sweating profusely_ then feeling nauseous_ then okay for about an hour_ just to start it all over again.  I couldn't understand why I felt so exhausted and weak_ like my legs would give out.  I had no energy for anything.  I had vivid dreams and nightmares.  I didn't connect any of this to Biaxin until on Day 6 when I woke up with a painful red rash all over my body.  I've never had allergies before_ but once I took some Niacin caplets and got the ""niacin flush"" which is kind of like this Biaxin reaction_ only the niacin rash goes away shortly_ not like this.  All day I have been sweating_ feeling like I am burning up all over_ yet I don't have a fever when I check with my thermometer.  It has started forming tiny pus-filled pimple like bumps on my neck and chest and face_ they hurt horribly and the rash also stings.",Taking this drug has resulted in my missing 4 days of work (so far)and feeling like I am literally in hell from the burning and stinging rash. Once I looked up Biaxin side effects_ I immediately stopped taking it and tried to vomit up my last dose this morning.  However_ my rash is getting worse by the minute and the only thing that MINORLY helps is having cold_ wet towels put on my face_ neck and chest.  I will absolutely NEVER recommend this medication to anyone and I am alarmed that many of the pharmacy info sites make it sound like Biaxin has minimal side effects and like the rash it can cause isn't that severe.

I took huge doses for a bad pneumonia for 6 weeks in spring 2004_ and shortly thereafter developed a heart arrhythmia (no history_ none in family).  It went away after 45 days or so_ then came back this fall_ right after taking Biaxin for 2 weeks.  I ended up in the emergency room this time_ where they could find no heart problems_ but discovered my blood potassium was a bit low--after getting potassium_ no more arrhythmia.  But it came back very strongly 2 days after starting Biaxin this week for bronchitis.  After another two days_ I finally made the connection and checked the web.  I quit taking it yesterday and took some more potassium  (only about 400 mgs)_ and the arrhythmia quit by this morning!

I've got to stick it out with this med.  It seems many docs (including mine) prescribe Biaxin XL to be taken once a day.  My doc told me to take it at night because it tends to leave a nasty taste in the mouth (don't know if that actually works!)

There are lots of other drugs out there that can do the job with few(er) side effects.  Check out Ketec_ a new antibiotic for respiratory infections--it's a 5 day dose_ relatively few side effects (I had blurry vision for a few days)_ and much more tolerable than Biaxin. Obviously_ Ketec didn't work for me_ but then again_ I've had upper and lower respiratory infections for about a year now and due to some immunological problems need a really long dose of strong antibiotics.

1010, 3, sinus infection,Apart from the bad taste left in my mouth_ I have experienced medium to severe upset stomach/cramping_ mild nausea_ indigestion (ie gas...sorry to be so blunt) and diarrhea/loose stool....it's wreaking havoc with my digestive system! Although the infection already seems to be disapating_ this drug is not worth the side effects (always feel slightly to very sick).  Going to doc tomorrow to see if I can switch to something milder.  Thankfully have a plan to cover the very expensive price tag too!,Would not recommend it unless suffering from chronic infections...for a rare sufferer such as me it is not worth the agonizing of the side effects.,F,30,2  days,1/19/2006,Biaxin

I'm even a nurse and have never heard of such a reaction.  ER doc thought I broke a fever and was having anxiety.  Anxiety and Tachycardia was definately related to medication.  I have had mild anxiety moments that were rational in the past.  This was far more real.  I feel better that I'm not the only one.,,F,30,1  days,1/17/2006Email,Biaxin

Other than that nothing_ no anxiety_ no headaches or diarrea or anything like that_ perhaps its because i'm one of the youngest people posting on this board?????,The stuff works.

1043, 5, sinusitis,Thanks for the helpful comments_ because I thought I was going crazy. The metallic taste was nasty_ but nothing compared with dizziness_ nausea_ utter exhaustion. One bout of heartburn early on_ then dissipated. But the other things were even scarier: a couple of uncontrollable crying spells_ a couple of nights of vivid nightmares_ fears at one point that I was having a nervous breakdown. Had to take a week off work because of the drug_ not the sinusitis. blurry vision for several days after ending medication and a feeling that my vision was following my head a few seconds later.,I stuck with the drug because I was desperate to get rid of the sinusitis_ which two weeks of Augmentin had not touched. And it worked. It kicked the infection's butt--though it kicked mine as well. I did not feel better right away_ but a CT scan after finishing the two weeks showed the infection gone. Had to get away from the side effects of this and the other medications (Allegra_ Sudafed_ Mucinex and Flonase) several days before I started feeling normal.,F,51,14  days,11/10/2005,Biaxin

Ugh.   I am allergic to -cillins and related drugs so my options are limited when it comes to antibx_ but I won't be taking this again if there's any other option - Zithromax may not be as strong_ but it also doesn't make me near-psychotic.

Fortunately been taking acidophilis pills and lactobaccilus chewables_ (the good bacteria in yoghurt.) Think its saving me from total meltdown. Biaxin cannot be good for you to feel like this. My body is saying you're poisoning yourself. I am STOPPING this antibiotic IMMEDIATELY. Regret taking pill this evening. Almost took myself to hospital tonight for them to pump this stuff out of me and make sure my heart is okay. I reckon it's not long before it's withdrawn!,CDC.gov says antibiotics no good for bronchitis as it is viral not bacterial. Maybe I had bacterial infection not bronchitis as Doctor had diagnosed because it did quickly clear up terrible infected green mucus I had been coughing. Not worth these side effects.

I would either wake up from a muscle twitching or from a sudden jolt tingling or a wave of numbness traveling from the back of my head through my arms.

Day 3:  Was depressed all morning.  Time seemed to be moving at a slow pace.  It was like living in a dream.  I was extremely hungry and I had an appetite_ but when I started eating_ I couldn't finish.  I took the third dose with lunch.  The rest of my day fell into this pattern:  stomach growl_ eat_ experience stomach discomfort and nausea_ vomit_ stomach growling again.  I finally went to sleep on an empty stomach because I couldn't stand it anymore.  I will not finish the rest of the pack.  I don't care if the infection comes back worse than before.

I woke up in the middle of the night with the classic METALLIC taste and a bone-dry mouth_ had to get up and get a drink and then eat something.  Taste and dryness was back in the morning.

I wish I had read these comments before taking my last dose--I don't think I would have taken it_ and instead of being up_ walking the floor at 2:15am_ I would hopefully be nicely asleep.  This taste is making me sicker than I was before.  Quite impressive diarrhea.  And_ obviously_ sleeplessness_ which is partially because of the overwhelming taste problem.  Also_ it doesn't really seem to be working at anything close to lightning speed.  Some very slight improvement_ but it makes a body wonder if the same improvement would have been accomplished WITHOUT the drug.  I'll NEVER take this again if there is any alternative in the universe.,,F,61,5  days,2/9/2005,Biaxin

My head didn't feel like exploding anymore.  When I awoke the next morning_ the left side of my face was swollen.  I thought maybe it might have been part of the healing process_ but the next morning the swelling had spread close to my eye.  I also was feeling the pain coming back to my head by that evening.

I had irrational_ racing_ disorganized_ and paranoid thoughts; I could not communicate very coherantly and was speaking quite fast. Reality became something very sensational and scary.

1134, 4, Upper respiratory/Sinus infection,Today is Feb 2_ 2005 and I've been taking Biaxin XL for three days now.  I have never had the metallic taste that many others have experienced.  I have had bad nightmares on a regular basis since taking Biaxin.  I'm drinking more water than normal to combat the dry mouth_ but don't have any strong desire to eat.  On my first night I experienced a mild headache and cough making it very difficult to sleep.  I've noticed that my short-term memory does not appear to be as sharp while on Biaxin.  I've also been experiencing some slight discomfort in my upper right jam for some unknown reason.  Other than all these side-effect the Biaxin has cleared up most of my respiratory/sinus infection.  Only four more days to go....,Appreciate all the comments that others have made pertaining to Biaxin.  Sort of a comfort to know that others have some of the same side-effects.,M,56,7  days,2/2/2005Email,Biaxin

I am still on Biaxin_ a 14 day maximum dose with 5 days left_ and I have contemplated stopping since day two because I feel so horrible. During the day I feel dizzy_ and when i make quick movements_ or turn my head_ it's almost like my vision follows later_ which doesn't help the dizziness. Thankfully all of the vomiting I've been doing takes place at least 5 hours after I take the pills_ so I feel they are pretty much disolved in my system by then_ hopefully. ,After only 4 days my infection was going away_ so it definetly works_ it is just unfortunate that the cure is worse then the sickness.,F,20,14  days,2/2/2005,Biaxin

1141, 5, Bronchitis,I've never suffered from any allergic reactions or side effects from any medications before so I was concerned when I started feeling this burning_ clenching sensation in the upper part of my abdomen. Of course it didn't take me long to figure out it was the Biaxin.  The problem was that I wasn't eating enough with the pills.  Today I ate a huge lunch with the pills to hopefully avoid that constant uncomfortable feeling. Wish me luck.,I'd take this again because I felt better immediately_ but then again_ I liked Zythromax just as well - no uncomfortable side effects.,F,36,4  days,1/22/2005,Biaxin

It happened after the first dose.,After reading the product insert_ I decided to call my doctor tomorrow to find something else.

The only way to get rid of it was to replace it with another taste (peppermint gum was my life-saver). Complete loss of appetite; I ate like a bird for two weeks_ which wasn't too great on my already thin frame. I never felt hungry_ and within two bites I felt completely stuffed. The worst part came about a week in when I was hit with some deathly frightening nightmares. I could barely sleep and felt like I was wading through water in the daytime. Sometimes I would start to get a little crazy and paranoid_ and at one point when I couldn't contact my parents_ I ended up calling 911.

I'll hang in there but it's almost not worth it.,I took Biaxin 5 years ago for the same thing and don't remember having any of these symptoms.  Probably because I was so miserable from the H.
