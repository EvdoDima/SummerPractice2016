2, 1, H pylori,"I was on Biaxin and Amoxicllin. I felt very off balance and my hands and feet were really itchy. I stopped taking them a week ago and I am still off balance and dizzy.

3, 2, Bronchitis,Psychotic mood_ vommitting_ fatigue.This was in the high dose but before I this none. I took this 3 times within a year for chest infections then was given again for stomach infection but didn't get to end of that course due to near heart attack with it. Why read on...very important information following,WARNING: This drug DEPLETES POTASSIUM by 3 points each time you take fine if you take once but no more. I took 3 times without knowing this n my potassium bottomed out n had alot of heart issues. You do not wanna mess around with potassium. I'm still trying to bring levels up 7 months on n iv just dropped under range again due to Sun stroke. Iv literally been house bound n in torture making sure nothing interferes n I get fucking heat stroke which affects potassium from sitting on my balcony for one hr.The reason its gone on so long is coz it was missed on bloods which I now know can be easily falsely elevated as there is only a tiny amount in bloodstream rest is in cells. It's unbelievable. I was written off as psychological when I'd severe hypokalemia ...the first symptom of low potassium is leg cramps be warned people. My life is in shams n its a fight to survive,F,31,7  days,5/26/2016Email,Biaxin
4, 2, Ulcer,Anxiety_ panic attacks_ severe depression_ insomnia_ nausea_ spells of crying.,"I took this as a part of the triple therapy for ulcers. It included Amoxicillian and a proton pump inhibitor. The psychological effects were severe. I became a different person and my personality changed. I sought a psychiatrist to help because I was on the brink of insanity. They gave me haldol and zoloft. I never took the zoloft but stayed on the haldol to stave off the insanity. I had what I referred to as ""thoughtless anxiety"" or ""random depression"". This is because I had severe forms of depression and anxiety for no reason and with nothing attached to them.",M,33,8  days500 2X D,5/24/2016,Biaxin
5, 1, h pylori,I only took this medication for 2 and 1/2 days. I thought i was losing my mind. Couldn't fall asleep_ my mind was racing_ my heart was racing_ my forehead felt tight and my eye lids heavy. Awful sour metallic taste in mouth. The worst part was not being able to focus at work_ and the irrational thoughts that were running through my head! Never again. Like someone else on here said_ the side effects were worse than the reason for taking this medication.,Would not recommend.,F,35,3  days500 mg 2X D,5/6/2016,Biaxin

8, 1, Pneumonia,I was prescribed this hellish drug January 2005. Immediately suffered psychological distress: paranoia_ suicidal thoughts_ delusions_ could not perform daily routines at all and did not leave the bed until Midday_ and the bed had to be in the middle of the living room. It affected my cognitive reasoning and my thoughts were irrational. I would either whisper when spoken to or not respond at all_ all the while looking the person in the eye. At midday I became hyper and frenetic; talkative and interruptive; unabashed and rude.,"It is 11 years later and although my symptoms have lessened they have not reversed. I have irrational thoughts everyday. I cannot keep track of time no matter how many reminder alerts I set on my devices. I am not mindful of present tasks. I resigned a well paying job in lieu of being terminated and collecting unemployment to avoid embarrassment. I put no effort to finding a new job. Having spent 2/3 of my retirement accounts on cosmetic surgery I am in danger of becoming homeless. My attitude toward  life choices is cavalier. I have been transformed from a responsible adult to a dreamer. Where I would never use rude language I now have no issues using vulgarity unless someone monitors my behavior. 11 years ago I begged my PCP to switch me to another antibiotic. Her rationale for not doing so destroyed my life. She asked ""Did I really want to start a new 10-day regimen when I was more than half way through this one."" I wept and said Yes. She said ""Well_ try and hang in there."" My brother_ a psychologist was horrified at my deterioration. I wish I had begged him to call my PCP. I wish I had the bravado to just stop taking it.",F,,10  days30 MG 1X D,3/25/2016Email,Biaxin
