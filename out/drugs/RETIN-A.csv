0, 2, Acne and anti-aging reasons,I was prescribed both Retin A cream and gel versions in 0.025% strengths by a General Practioner to use towards getting and keeping my face clear. Initially_ I was excited about using it because it is supposed to have anti-aging benefits to it_ but that later changed. The gel version has alcohol in it_ and gave me worse side effects than the cream version_ which is why_ I eventually asked to only be prescribed the cream version. I did get my acne under control and it stayed that way for an extended period of time_ before Retin A stopped working well for my skin at all. During the entire time that I was on Retin A my skin stayed very sensitive_ parched_ red_ very irritated on both my face and around my eyes_ and sometimes extremely sore. I ended up going to see a dermatologist so that I could be switched over to using something else. My skin had started showing signs of hyperpigmentation_ increased occurrences of acne That had started popping up_ my pores began to look clogged_ and even,Retin A is very harsh on the skin (even when used at the lowest strength). My skin remained very irritated and sore the whole time I was on it. It worked for getting and keeping my skin clear for an extended period of time_ until it came a time in which it didn't appear to really be doing anything good for my skin anymore. Which is why_ I decided to get off of it. Plus_ it is very expensive both with and without insurance. It is definitely not worth the money or use (in my opinion) in the long run.,F,,7  years45g 1X D,2/22/2015Email,Retin-a

2, 5, Moderate adult acne,Dry patches on U-zone of skin (chin and jawline) that became red_ scaly_ and covered with weird red bumps that were not pimples (hyrocortisone cream helped get rid of them). Some dry skin_ peeling_ flaking_ and burning.,As a teen I never had an acne problem_ but after going off the BC pill my face exploded with a constant stream of pimples_ both painful deep and surface. Mostly they were in my T-zone but also some in my U-zone that were leaving nasty purple scars. I washed with salicylic acid 2x a day_ used astringent once/day_ washed my hair daily_ changed my pillow cases often_ stopped touching my face_ stopped wearing foundation_ etc. Nothing helped. Finally the Dr gave me generic Retin-A and it has done the trick. It gave me some nasty dry patches on my chin_ but I stopped putting the cream there and hydrocortisone cream helped it clear. My forehead has never looked better! The cream tends to make me have small_ unnoticeable blackheads instead of huge nasty pimples_ and that's fine by me since they're small_ discrete_ and easier to pop. I use the cream at night on my forehead/nose after washing with Noxzema anti-bacterial cleanser and applying .5% salicylic acid astringent. I also use Noxzema cold cream in the afternoon daily as it really helps draw out the blackheads and dries out the rare whiteheads I encounter on my chin.,F,22,1  years.05% 1X D,8/29/2011,Retin-a
3, 2, severe adult acne,My doctor prescribed a low dose of Retain A gel...that did nothing except make my skin Horribly dry. About 3 months later I was bumped up to a higher dosage_ in creme form_ the strongest one available shy of Accutane_ and it's been 3 months_ I'm not impressed at all.,,F,25,6  months 1X D,6/23/2010,Retin-a

7, 2, acne,severe peeling_ redness_ burning_ irritation_ even left raw spots on my face_ kind of like blisters,i was prescribed retin-a along with a benzoyl peroxide wash and wasnt very satisfied. after just one night_ my skin was severely peeling and my face was getting painful raw spots everywhere. my doctor said the peeling would go away after 2 weeks but it hasnt for me. i was taking it for 5 months and during that time_ my acne seemed to get worse instead of better and i dont like how long it takes to show improvement(about 3 months) when there are plenty of faster working medications out there. i wouldnt recommend retin-a to anyone.,F,15,5  months,6/11/2009,Retin-a
8, 3, Acne,"None_ clearing up a bit...even age spots!  Looking forward to the next couple months eliminating all my acne!  If you just use the pea size at night_ I can't imagine anyone is ""peeling & dry""...perhaps heed the phrase_ ""more is not better!""",Liking it after a month...looking forward to achieving more results!  Remember_ a Pea size pearl a day.  Apply to gently cleansed face befor bedtime.,F,44,4  weeks,3/23/2008,Retin-a

10, 3, acne,"First used this for acne as a teenager_ and had wonderful results within a couple of weeks of nightly treatment.  Tried to go back on it as an adult some 10 years later for mild adult acne (very bad blackheads)_ and had lots of side effects in flaking and redness.  The first 5 weeks or so on it caused a lot of breakouts as it ""pulls out"" all the problems in your skin at once.","I do not think this should be used if you have rosacea_ as I now do.   It would periodically cause a profound red ""rash"" all over the face_ I suppose because it exfoliates so much.  However_ on normal skin types I think it will work fine.  It did help a lot for the blackheads_ but was not worth it in the long run due to the redness and tons of flaking.   I did not have rosacea when I was a teenager_ and Retin A worked very well then.    It is expensive_ though... about $50 a tube.  But if you have basic acne_ it's worth it for the treatment!",F,28,4  months,11/19/2005,Retin-a
