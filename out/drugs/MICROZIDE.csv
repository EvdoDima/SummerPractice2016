2, 1, Blood pressure,This is the WORST medicine I have EVER taken in my life!!I thought it worked ok for the BP but it was wrecking havoc with my potassium levels so I was taking potassium pills.  Then after a year or so_ started getting a rash that spread over arms_ torso_ legs_ etc.  Itching so severe that my dermatologist exhausted all the creams and lotions that she could come up with....ended up taking a biopsy of rash and found that it was caused by this medicine.  I stopped it  right then!  I never suffered so much from one medicine.  They ought to take this OFF the market now!!!!I have a friend who said he took it about 30 years ago and it caused his gout that he has now.  He had only taken it for 2 months when he was diagnosed with gout.,,F,51,2  years25 mg 1X D,9/11/2011,Microzide

6, 1, Hypertension,After 6 weeks I felt flush_ my legs were weak_ I could'nt concentrate and had rectal bleeding. This lasted for 10 days. I stopped taking it for 2 weeks and the symptoms went away. I started on it again because my BP was real high and because my Doctor said HCTZ dos'nt cause those symptoms and within 2 weeks all the smyptoms came back.,For some reason Doctors don't like to admit that certain drugs can cause certain symptoms. This drug really had me messed up for 12 weeks off and on. I was sent to 2 Neurologists who did an MRI_ MRA and several other tests but found nothing. I was finally put on Depakote for seizures but when I started taking HCTZ again all the symptoms came back. I'll never take it again!!,M,52,3  months,11/29/2006Email,Microzide
