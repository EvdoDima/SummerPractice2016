0, 4, Depression,Extremely dry mouth_ constipation_ hot flushes_ disjointed speech,DREPRESSION:  little effect or relive but it did stop the crying and the suicidal thoughts. SMOKING.  This drug is excellent for those who want to stop smoking!!  After the first week I noticed that I didn't crave for a cigarette for 6 hours.  It just never enter my mind. The more I took the drug the more I didn't want to smoke. If I did it felt like I was licking an ashtray. It took only 2 months give or take to give them up. Tip: whilst you are busy you ever even get a craving. NB I found that I had to take 100mg before this worked but as I reduced to 50 and 25mg it was still effective.,F,56,3  months25-125 1X D,4/5/2016,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
1, 1, Anxiety/Mood Disorder,This drug caused Unbelievable Aggressive behaviour I was easily irritated and Very short tempered_ which for me was very strange as I'm usually a very calm and easy going person even with my mood disorder I have never felt the way I did while taking this medication. This drug made me want to physically harm other people to the point I'd fantasize about what I would do to someone who had irritated me earlier_ or people who in all reality didn't do anything at all. It caused me to yell at people while driving_ caused me to say things I normally wouldn't say_ caused extremely scary nightmares.When I wasn't feeling like assaulting someone this drug only elevated my anxiety and panic attacks_ did not help it one bit!! TERRIBLE medication.,If you want to be an a**hole to everyone about anything then this drug is for you otherwise I would NOT recommend it to anyone_ the aggression is not worth it.,M,27,4  weeks30 MG 1X D,3/21/2016,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

Had to stop taking the drug due to side effects and ended up having a nightmarish time coming off of the drug. The withdrawal symptoms were so severe I ended up in ER 3 times!!!,I was put on nortriptyline for daily headaches caused by a lumbar puncture procedure. Though it helped decreased the intensity of the headaches it did not get rid of them. I was also having major heart issues while on the drug. My heart would race all of a sudden for no reason. The muscle spasms were becoming a concern as I was getting them more frequently and all over my body! I tapered the drug off over a one week period. Although I only took it for 6 weeks on a very low dosage I ended up having a nightmarish time coming off of the drug! My were withdrawal symptoms were so sever: Racing heart_ feverish body temperature_ sweating_ labored breathing_ GI problems_ skin itchiness_ worsening of tinnitus_ extreme dry throat_ vertigo_ dizziness_ imbalance_ fatigue and of course worsening of headaches.

18, 4, Migraine-Associated Vertigo/Dizzy,Drowsiness after taking med- I take it at night because of this. I also think it may contribute to my chronic dry eyes.,I had migraine-associated vertigo/dizziness almost constantly for over a year when I finally decided to try this medication. I also had other migraine symptoms like photophobia and phonophobia. I had full-blown migraines with visual aura and hand numbness 3-6 times a year. I tried verapamil before this med with no help. I experienced improvements in my symptoms within a month or two but I actually improved even more over the following 6-12 months. The dizziness is now so much better. I even have days where I don't notice it at all (I used to spend entire days in bed because I felt so bad). The main time I notice dizziness now is post-menstrual (estrogen rising?). The photophobia and phonophobia are mostly gone but I still get 3-5 full-blown migraines a year. This drug has helped give me my life back. I experienced little side effects. I rate 4 instead of 5 because the dizziness is not 100% resolved.,F,33,2  years10-30mg 1X D,3/11/2015,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

22, 3, Neuropathy after muscle injury,Extreme dry mouth and throat_ racing heart_ persistent tachycardia_ difficulty finding words_ using different words than intended_ foggy_ very forgetful_ surreal feeling when awake_ jittery_ extreme anxiety. Sleeplessness_,I started on 25mg and noticed above symtoms around day 3 to a mild degree. I increased to 50mg on day 7 and the symptoms became way worse to the point that my pulse remained in the 120s at rest and I ended up in the ER. I decreased to one pill but continued to have tachycardia_ and extreme anxiety_ could barely function. I also lost weight because I could barely eat and became nauseated if I ate too much_ it acted like a stimulant and appetite suppressant for me which I hated and without much weight to lose it was also alarming as I lost over 3 pounds in 10 days. It really helped my pain though. I had no pain with this drug during the day and only had to take my ultram at night before bed. This med works by increasing norepinephrine the precursor to adrenaline that can be too much for some people. Unfortunately the side effects were so extreme I had to get off the med. Being a nurse the confusion and forgetfulness also made me feel unsafe to  return to work on this med. Am now trying gabapentin which I hear is not as good but at least no racing heart!.,F,36,10  weeks25 -->50,12/22/2014,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

I have also noticed dark urine and have some very vivid nightmares that affect my sleep.,Now that I've been on it for a month and a half I have not had a migraine for 26 days which is a huge and positive change.

Plus constipation and sleepless nights with vivid dreams. No REM sleep at all. Absolutely NO effect on my nerve pain. Stopped taking after 2 weeks - not worth it dealing with side effects and NO pain relief.,F,74,2  weeks20 mg 1X D,6/14/2013,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
42, 4, Chronic migraine/daily headaches,Sleeplessness (waking up every few hours)_ depression_ dark diarrhea_ loss of appetite_,I used to get chronic_ painful headaches almost every day. Since taking Nortriptline_ my headaches have almost stopped. I still get sharp pains all over my head (as though someone was using a pin and pricking me). I had a few downsides to this medication though. I have insomnia_ so it is hard for me to fall asleep to begin with. With this medication it takes a few hours for me to fall to sleep and when I finally do_ I keep waking up in the middle of the night. I have been depressed and extremely irritated with everything and everyone. Overall_ it did the job of getting rid of my headaches but I am not sure that it is worth being depressed and upset.,F,22,4  weeks10MG 1X D,5/20/2013Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

Before I was in such pain I could not function_ walk or stand still. If I need to wait in line for a long time I prefer to sit after a while_ the same with longer walks (sit & rest for a moment ) but I drive and do everything I could not do before. Even if I'll became bold I'll still will take it. The other option is surgery. Gabapentin is also taken for that but per my neurologist it is not as effective - for about 50% of people who have such pain- Nortriptyline's effectiveness is much higher then Gabapentin's. .,F,50,5  years50 mg 1X D,5/11/2013Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
44, 1, Sleeplessness from provigil,I am absolutely horrified to continue this drug. I don't understand why my dr. Perscribed it. I was taking mirtazapine 15 mg for sleep & after 6-weeks I was still having demonic dreams about all of my family who has passed away. My mother & grandmother were angels in my life_ but NOT on either of the drugs I mentioned. I constantly dream they are green demons crawling on my ceiling_ & speaking in Linda Blair exorcist type voices. Vomiting at me & I'm trapped in the room with them. If its not them in the dream_ just insert a star from a show on tv I watched that night. I dreamt all the singers on American idol were green_ peeling flesh_ & would spit vomit @ me in the audience when they sang. AWFUL!So_ after reading all of these nightmares people are having_ I dont know why dr. Perscribed it for me. I'm afraid to sleep!!!!,,M,49,10  days50mg,5/9/2013Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

With 20mg the first two weeks there was quite a bit of anxiety but it has settled to barely any now.  I seem to have lost interest in food and that is okay.  I am still eating but making healthy choices.  Oh and another thing is about passing urine_ I have to consciously think about it to trigger release.  I think the worst thing is the dry mouth.  Having mints (sugar free) helps.  I am just about ready to increase to 30mg.

I've noticed a bit of a dependency on the medication and minor loss of appetite. I take two pills before bed and will probably be on the medication for numerous years. I usually sleep very deeply and have vivid dreams. It has a horrid aftertaste that I've gotten used to and I am constantly thirsty. It does the job but I may  need to have the dosage increased...

64, 3, Anxiety_ Migraines,Rapid Heart Beat (for 12 years)Heart Palpatation (just recently_ ~2 weeks),I originally thought that Nortyiptyline was a great drug_ better than SSRIs at releiving anxiety and also helped with migraine prevention.  After a few weeks I developed tachychardia (rapid heart rate; a known side effect) and dropped the dose from 80 mg to 40 mg.  This helped_ although heart rate is still rapid.  However_ very recently I've developed persistant heart palatations that I belibve are drug related (when I skip a few days they go away).  Strange to develop this after 12 years.  I've tried every other medication and nothing else has helped me_ so not sure what I will do_ but I can't handle the heart problems.  For those with meidcal backgrounds teh drug is also known to cause QTc prolongation (which is why an overdose can be deadly).,M,38,12  years40-80 mg 1X D,7/6/2012Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
65, 1, Migraines,psychosis_ schizophrenic like symptoms,On August 11th_ 2011_ I jumped from a moving vehicle with my daughter in my arms. The story doesn't start there however. A month and a half prior_ I began taking nortriptyline for migraines as prescribed by my family physician. Within one week's time_ I began to experience insomnia and obsessive thinking. Within mere weeks_ I was convinced an elaborate_ high ranking child sex ring was after my only daughter. I went from a healthy_ vibrant_ mentally stable mother to one reeling in a world of schizophrenic delusions. Thinking a helicopter had been sent to find us_ I left a car_ cradling my three year old daughter in my arms. My family had noticed a change in my behaviour_ but could not begin to imagine things had gotten so out of hand. My physician refilled my medication without seeing me and I was too far gone to realize that I was beginning to experience psychotic delusions of persecution. I am writing about this because I want to reach out to anyone else who is currently taking Nortriptyline and perhaps experiencing any of the symptoms I experienced.

Slowly my migraine frequency started creeping back up_ and my Dr increased the dose from 25mg to 50mg.

Tried Trazodone for 3 months which didn't help much and left me feeling very zoned out during the day. Did not like the side effects. Doctor switched me to Nortriptylene_ 50 mgs. with the clorazepate ( Tranxene ) and it helped me sleep some better but not enough_ then we increased dosage to 7.5 mg. X 3 with Tranxene and that worked_ for 7 to 8 eight hours sleep. Wonderful!A great side effect of this medicine is that I am not having any musculo-skeletal pain_ from sports repetitive injuries that I had been living with_ but wasn't terrible. There is no daytime drowiness_ as with Trazodone_ even if you don't sleep well_ on occasion. I *heart* this medicine_ combined with Tranxene. ( clorazepate 7.5 mg. ) I have lost 5 pounds.

I take Maxalt for the migraines when they occur_ within two days I could feel a difference_ almost as if my body was trying to start a headache but couldnt quite muster one up.  This was fascinating to me_ as I had been told to take the migraine capsules as soon as a Migraine headache signs began. When I described this sensation to my Doctor_ she said that she had heard similar descriptions from other patients taking simpler dosages for a migraine condition.  I still had a premenstrual headache and was given an increased dosage of 20 mg at bedtime. It has only been a month since the increase to 20mg has been prescribed_ but I have yet to need the Maxalt tablet for a Migraine.  It would have had at minimum fifteen or more migraines by this date if I were not taking the Nortriptyline.

With the 100mg dose was increased for some extra relief from breakthrough pain  I was having from a hysterectomy.  I sleep a full 8 hours solid_ wake up  feeling refreshed!  Helps me fall asleep fast!  This also has helped greatly with headaches. I rarely even get a headache anymore!  Also has  been helpful with the depression.  Probably because I am getting a good night sleep now_ and not having to wake up with  pounding headaches anymore! I currently have been on the new 100mg dose now for 1 week and already have noticed the difference!  Sounds like those that were put on the very low doses to start with had problems with sleepiness during the day.  Never had a problem with the numbness or heart from this med.  I started at 50mg 7 months ago. Also helped me with that morning gagging that someone else commented about.  I didn't realize that until  I read that review.

114, 5, Prevention of headaches; depression,Only side effects that I have noticed are all good. Seem to be a bit of a dry mouth_ but I figure I need to be drinking more water anyhow.  For years_ I had a problem of severe gagging problem and upon taking this medicine that problem has vanished.,This medication was originally prescribed for me to prevent headaches. About a year ago_ I suffered from a headache that would not go away. Doctors gave me this medication and after about a month of taking it I didn't have the headache anymore.  I stopped taking the medication because it was very difficult to remember to take the medication.Then 2 weeks ago doctors doctors suggested this medication for depression after failed attempts of taking prozac (which made me extremely nauseous) and paxil (which made me light headed and dizziness which in turn made me nauseous). I would have to rate this a wonder drug for me because it took care of a chronic gagging problem in the mornings & I actually feel like doing things again.,F,40,2  weeks,10/27/2008Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
115, 3, fibromyalgia_migraines_ depression_,Dry mouth_ lump in throat_irregular heart beat_ blurry vision_ speed-like feeling (diet pill feeling)_ some sexual problems_ loss of appetite_ continued migraines.,Nortriptyline worked great for my depression and anxiety. Even gave me motivation to start doing things again; however_ I had to quit taking it due to the side affects. The racing heart and lump in my throat were the worst and have not gone away yet as of 5 days off the drug. Felt like I had too much caffine_ but this made me motivated. Never had any anxiety or depression_ even during a difficult family crisis. I had some blurry vision and loss of appetite. I actually lost 9 pounds while on this only 3 weeks. Achieving an orgasm took way too long.Also had 1 migraine after 2 weeks of treatment. I was taking 10 mg and had too many side affects for such a low dose. I can see how Nortrptyline can be effective for someone who is not as senitive as I am. Shame I had to quit.,F,44,4  weeks,10/8/2008,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
116, 3, nerve pain in shoulder and arm,The only thing I have noticed is that it has caused numbness and tingling in my left arm. But this works out perfectly for me since I am taking it for the nerve pain in that arm!,,F,37,12  days,10/7/2008,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
117, 4, Daily Headache,Sleepiness during the day.,Taking 50mg every night at bedtime.  This is the only treatment I found that works after 1-1/2 years of going to the doctor and trying alot of different things.  If I forget to take this medicine the headache comes back within 1-2 days every time.  Then I have to get the medicine built back up in my system for the headache to go away again_ usually after 1-2 days.  The biggest problem is remembering to take the medicine EVERY NIGHT before bed_ otherwise if I take it in the morning or during the day_ I get very sleepy. This medicine does the job.  I would rather be a little sleepy_ than go back to having the headaches every day again.,M,35,6  months,6/5/2008,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
118, 4, low backpain and could not sleep,I cannot trace any side effects to this Rx.,I have been taking 50mg for about 2 years at bedtime_ I usually take it about 2 hours before I go to sleep_ as soon as i get to bed I'm sleepy_ no trouble waking up at 6 a.m. for work each day.  They only drug that has been able to keep by back pain in check and keep me from turning over 10-20 times per night due to the back pain.  I would recommend it.,,53,2  years,3/15/2008,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
119, 4, Stomach spasms and depression,No negative side effects.  Started at 50mg before bed and the stomach spasms began to improve in just a few days.,I had stomach spasms several times a day_ that felt like a very fast heartbeat_ which initially made me think I was having a panic attack. The spasms would last from seconds to hours at a time and often was followed with diarrhea and vomiting.  Because I tolerated the Nortriptyline well_ after 6 weeks_ my dosage was increased to 75mg_ then 100mg to help with depression.  It has been 4 months and I feel better every day_ physically and mentally.,F,31,4  months,2/19/2008,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

121, 3, Low Grade Migraine,Dry Mouth.  Chest pain a couple of times_ the first time I went to the hospital and stayed two days. I suspect the two are related.,I felt better_ migraine is gone. Mood is positive.  I suspect this is the cause of my chest pain.  I have the pain if I don't exercise for a couple of days.  I will ask to get off this medication.  I am on 10 MG.,M,45,31  days,12/24/2007,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
122, 4, chronic shoulder/neck pain,SEVER drowsiness in the AM. I take 100mg at bedtime and allows me to sleep through the night more often then not. I take a variety of daytime medicines during day and at night_ but had excellent success with this as a aid for pain relief at night. I know this is a bit of a progressive use for this drug_ but it worked for me.,Causes extreme drowsiness in the AM_ I could not drive until hours later. Wife says makes me talk in my sleep sometimes very loud_ which is something I have never done. I am greatful to the nightime relief it brings so that I can get some sleep.,M,36,10  months,11/26/2007,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

My pain is mitigated_ my anxiety is gone.  I am very sensitive to drugs and can feel a difference already.,Chronic neck pain for 2 years_ sleeplessness_ due to side whiplash.  Hit from side by 50mph truck.  Have tried everything_ new dr wants to wean me off all pain meds by putting me on this one.  I admit_ I am sleeping sooooo well_ and pain is better.  But I feel so out of it and sleepy all the time.  I have children and a huge house to take care of_ it's impossible.  Will give it two weeks before I make a decision about continuing.,F,43,3  days,9/12/2007Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

Does not leave me drowsy in the morning even if I only get 5 hours sleep.,M,35,35  days,5/17/2007Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
127, 1, Migraine headaches,My Neurologist prescribed Pamelor for my Migraines and it works wonderfully well. However_ I looked for a generic when it became so expensive. I now use the Watson Labs Nortriptyline and it works just like the brand Pamelor.  When a drugstore CVS used the Nortriptyline HCI_ I had unbelievable headaches.  I get the Watson Labs version at Brunos Pharmacy.  I cannot tell the difference between that and the brand Pamelor except it only costs $5.00,I do not like the weight gain (20 lbs. in 10 years) and have to be very careful about my diet.  But the good part-- I have only 2 or 3 migraines per year instead of 15 plus.,F,63,10  years,5/3/2007,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
128, 4, Migraine,racing heart_ tingling and numbness in my arms and hands_ difficulty concentrating_ dry mouth,This drug has helped with my migraines. My headaches have decreased from daily to about once every two weeks. However after the first week I started waking up at night with a racing heart rate and numbness in my left arm and hand. The second week I started getting numbness in my right arm too. After the first week I started noticing that I was very tired during the day and had difficulty concentrating. I will need to switch to something else for my headaches because my heart starts to beat so fast that it wakes my up at night.,M,51,21  days,4/17/2007,Nortriptyline hydrochloride

130, 1, migraines,Be careful!  After 4 weeks on a low dose I developed an apartently common side effect- a ventricular arrythmia.  I stopped the drug over a year ago and still have the arrythmia.  my cardiologist cays I probably will forever and that most likely the drug triggered it..The good news is that the Toprol I now have to take for my arrythmia helps with the migraines..some way to find out!,,F,34,30  days,4/20/2006,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
131, 4, Classic Migraines,couldn't sleep the first week_ but that went it away_ which is interesting since it treats insomnia sometimes.  Decreased sexual libido_ that never got better..,I was taking it as a preventative for migraines_ It worked great..I would only have 1 maybe every 4-6 months down from 1-2/week that last about 8 hours each_ and leave me unable to function.  However_ During the last 6 months I've had to keep uping the dosage_ and now my primary doesn't want me on it any longer due to the fact that it is worsening a heart issue_ so I'm going to have to get off of it..it worked so good for so long_ but the risks of my heart supposedly outweigh the benefits for the migraines (so says the dr) i'll see what my cardiologist says.,M,19,2  years,4/15/2006Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
132, 1, Cheapert than brand- didn't work!,When I changed from the name brand Pamelor my panic attacks came back. Dosage was adjusted and it didnt help. I don't want to spend an extra $500 per month and my insurance no longer pays.  Hoping to find something else.,Took Pamelor with great results.,M,64,1  years,12/15/2005Email,Nortriptyline hydrochloride
133, 5, Prevent migraines,This has been a miracle drug for me.  Besides effectively preventing migraines (except for one that slips through only very occasionally)_ it also helps me fall asleep and decreases nerve pain in my lower back.
