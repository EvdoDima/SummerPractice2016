0, 1, strep,Started with painful stomach cramps the first day.  The second day_ the cramps continued and turned into a severe burning sensation in my stomach.  Vomited lots of bile_ and very nauseous in between.  Could not get comfortable no matter how I layed down.  Severe burning sensation lasted 12 hours and made sleeping almost impossible!  (And I've slept through labor contractions!)  Worst meds ever!,,F,32,2  days333 MG 3X D,6/25/2015,Ery-tab

2, 1, staph infection/impetigo,stomach pain; vomiting bile; heart murmur_ near heart attack,At first_ the pills just gave me a terrible stomach ache_ which turned slowly into a full-blown ulcer and diverticulitis.  Then_ when given it again_ it nearly killed me.  I vomited up bile_ my joints swelled up: my ankles and knees were the same size.,F,39,3  weeks,12/5/2007,Ery-tab
3, 1, Sore throat/ strep throat,I have abdominal cramping. Lots of air in my stomach making it hurt. It only stops when I eat. Very sharp and sever pain_ although it is helping the infection...,I think that if you have an alternative medicine method you should take it. I have to take two of these pills twice a day_ and I hate it..,F,17,10  days,9/17/2007,Ery-tab
