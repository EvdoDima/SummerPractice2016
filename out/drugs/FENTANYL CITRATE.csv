0, 5, post surgery epidural,Itching_ unusual dreams/nightmares_ out of it twilight sleep/nod feeling_ extreme numbness waist down_ urinary retention_ hypnagogic hallucinations,Worked pretty well for pain in an epidural_ but man_ it was WEIRD. It seemed to cast me in that Comfortably Numb Pink Floyd video_ but then again_ I just had surgery and the pain was TERRIBLE. I would reccomend it_ but after surgery_ you dont have much choice in what they put in your IV. Probably about interchangeable with other strong opioids.,M,27,4  days20 microG 2X H,2/11/2010,Fentanyl citrate
