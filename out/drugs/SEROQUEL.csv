4, 3, Misdiagnosed bipolar,Gained thirty pounds,It's good short term (3-6 months) until a proper longer term plan is developed.  It's been described as a 'dirty drug' because it affects so many neurotransmitters.  Should only be used with psychosis.  The benefits of this drug would only outweigh the most extreme cases of mental illness_ I believe.,F,39,1  years150,6/25/2016,Seroquel
5, 1," What my doctor calls ""hypomania.""",I HATE the way this stuff makes me feel. It's terrible. It makes me feel groggy and drowsy_ but it doesn't help me sleep. It makes my restless leg syndrome worse_ just like antihistamines do. I also feel sick_ kind of like a bad hangover. There's also kind of a jitteriness in the way I feel. It's like my muscles have been sedated but my nervous system hasn't. There's just as much anxiety as before taking the drug_ but you feel so groggy and letharic that you can't do anything to ease the jitters. This is a terrible drug. My doctor prescribed it for a condition she calls hypomania_ but after taking just half of a 50 mg pill I can tell that this is not what I need. The grogginess and lethargy might be okay if the drug actually helped me sleep_ but it doesn't. It's like it both sedates and excites my nervous system at the same time_ so my body and my mind are confused as hell. I couldn't wait for the effects of that 1/2 pill to wear off.,My doctor said that she has had patients who take a 600 mg dose of this drug. I think 600 mg would kill me_ seriously. The effect from just 25 mgs was almost too much for me to bear. If you decide to try this drug_ be very careful. Better yet_ don't take it.,M,48,1  days25  mg,6/24/2016Email,Seroquel

I was told that I could never get off of this stuff_ but 16 months ago_ I quit cold turkey. Weening off was not an option for me_ as it made me feel more anxiety_ and more 'crazy'.  I went through 3 months of withdrawal from taking seroquel. I would never recommend that anyone take it..ever.

Fatigue_ lethargy & apathy.,I have been on this medication for around 15 years now. I have tried going off it many_ many times. I even slowly tapered it down to 6.5 mg_ but always ended up back on it because without it - I wouldn't sleep at all for days_ until I would usually start hallucinating and feeling like I was coming apart at the seams. Nothing else seems to work for my insomnia. I am fed up with constantly feeling tired all day and am sick of being so overweight. I went cold turkey 7 nights ago & have only managed 8 hours of sleep TOTAL since. I'm exhausted_ but OK mentally_ in part thanks to being on Prozac & in part to being so determined to get off of it for once and for all.

24, 3, Insomnia,"First few days I slept extremely well. But I went through a long weekend (3 days) unaware of time or place and avoiding social contact unconsciously.  The effect was very strong_ a zombie like effect.  Forgot to exercise_ ate a lot of ice cream_ both bad for me.  Especially bad since I have high TG anyway and should stay away from carbs.  Somehow it seemed not to matter if I ate a tub of ice cream a day.  Nothing mattered.  I tried to take it only some days_ but then couldn't sleep.  In the end I went back to just not sleeping at night.  I sleep during the day_ have an evening job which is ""morning"" for my body.  Hey whatever_ I learned to adjust.",Lots of people are saying headache.  I think I understand why.  I have migraines and they are affected most by my blood pressure which needs to stay low.  Somehow this was pushing my blood pressure up_ giving me a constant headache and tinnitus.  It did have some great side effects like_ my gut calmed down and stopped constipating by being uptight.

I was 105 lbs when I started taking this and was up to 120lbs in just 3 months. My hunger would not cease. Round the clock I was so hungry. It was terrible. I'm not sure if it worked for my bipolar as I only took it for 3 months_ but it wasn't worth it. The withdrawal symptoms were hell. Not as hellish as Effexor withdrawal but really bad.

Now I am paranoid and not sure the medication has done anything to slow or stop the paranoia.    I think my doctor is experimenting on me.  Has me on klonopin_ Seroquel_ Temazepam. Now she has added additional 200 mg of Seroquel during the day.  Only in the morning for a short time can I seem to think a little of my own thoughts in the fog of Seroquel hangover.  I read somewhere these are brain disabling drugs_ a chemical lobotomy in a pill form.  I hope this is not permanent but the strange part is I don't seem to care anymore if it is.

Sore joints_ legs hurt to walk_ severe abdominal problems_ black hard stools_ when I can because my stomach is so painful I feel horrible.

56, 5, Unable to sleep,"Every now and then it is like I have taken a sugar pill. I joke that for every bottle they put 5 or 6 sugar pills in just for fun. I have to take Restoril with it or I don't fall all the way asleep. It's like I am asleep sort of but I can remember all of my dreams and I kind of turn into a movie director.  I finally got to the point where if this continued on for too long I could say in my dream ""ENOUGH.""  I had to think about it and tell myself this is what I was going to do for several weeks before my brain remembered to to say that while I was in that state. As long as I take the Restoril with it I actually fall asleep and have at least at short period of time where I am completely ""unaware.""",Something happened to me 9 years ago where I can't fall asleep on my own. I also probably had a nervous break down at the same time. The dr never really knew what happened to me. Before that I never had any problem sleeping. I don't know what I would do without Seroquel. Probably go crazy. I am very grateful to have it. I will say this. I am off all medication for depression an anxiety.  I take a calcium/magnesium supplement and it takes the edge off and actually works better than the Zoloft of Wellbutrin that I took. When I was taking the Zoloft I had what they call vivid dreams. It was worse than what I described above.  I've read about people who try to have vivid dreams. I think they are nuts.  I also sweated a lot at night. Once I was finally off the Zoloft the night sweating and vivid dreams went away. Just saying that to say I knew then it wasn't the Seruquel doing it. If anyone has questions about the use of the Restoril along with the Seroquel you may email me.,F,44,9  years200 mg,5/14/2015Email,Seroquel

W/ every last ounce of sanity left while in a psychotic bipolar state I stayed on the med. My thoughts became organized within a few weeks but took a good 2-3 full months for the med to really shine (in a positive way). My moods however wouldn't stay stable in the evening so doc started XR. Mood is now stable throughout the day. Many complain about fogginess or being tired. XR makes me drowsy only when taken at bedtime_ but unlike most people's opinions I've read_ I LOVE this about Seroquel. When I want to sleep_ I get good_ solid sleep on a regular pattern. Much easier to get up in the morning. There is no generic equivalent of the XR_ it is very expensive. Like any medication it is a risk versus benefit.

82, 5, Bi Polar Disorder,I love Seroquel. Seroquel helps me sleep. BUT_ there are some side effects that i have noticed that are...more hit or miss. And by that i mean i have the effect or i dont. i noticed that i have an adverse side effect that feels like suffocation. My nasal passages feel as if they are completely dried out...and when i touch them (yes stick my finger up m nose) they are dry. The sensation then feels like my nose is stuffed up really bad. to the point where i cant breathe correctly. This usually comes along about 30 mins after taking my dose. I take 400 mg at night. So_ along with the drunken stupor i get settled into_ i then feel as if i cant breathe. Understand that i am losing all function and just want to sleep_ and the stupor im in is dizzying and im slurring and my eyes are half closed; now add in the fact that you feel as though you cant breathe. Its terrifying. This is where the fun part comes in. Panic sets in...and a mini or large panic attack *depending how sever your terror is_,Other than the night and morning affects: morning stupor fine after 7am...This medication is a life saver. I could have been really sick by now. MY bipolar disorder was hell. I was sick of having to deal with it_ and tired of nothing working_ tired of my moodswings. Terrified i was going to break. I have a 4yr son_ and the last thing i wanted was for him to see me like this or worse_ lashing out toward him.

Does not improve depression at all_ makes it worse! The XR version will make you completely incapacitated the following morning to the point where you can't even move your body; literally. Completely halts the effect of stimulants like Vyvanse used for major depression and enabling you to get out of bed in the morning. Worst sleep aid on the market and no patient assistance programs exist. Also terribly expensive. Consider another antipsychotic such as Abilify or Saphris_ you'll be glad you did.

97, 5, Bipolar,One hour after taking_  it puts you into a heavy drowsiness_   almost into a stupor.  You simply have to go to bed;   I can't imagine anyone doing anything waking/active at all once the drug kicks in.   Causes the profoundest sleep you've ever had;   a godsend to those of us with hyperactive minds.  Often it seems to make the night fly by instantly:  One minute you're lying down_  the next minute you're waking up 6-8 hours later_  with no memory of having slept.     Surprisingly_  you awaken with little or no grogginess;  the fog lifts within 30-40 minutes.   I do find I need 2 cups of coffee_  though  to get me into the swing of active thinking.  Seroquel's most disagreeable side-effect for me was_  as the drug takes effect_   it causes your nasal passages to swell up and shut tighter than a drum;   on one occasion_  very alarmingly_   I felt I could barely breathe through my mouth_  either.   Nose spray (oxymetazoline) totally relieve this_   however.   Seroquel really feels like a p,"It's a life-saver for those with manic_  hyperactive_   ""monkey-minded"" minds_  and those of us recovering from substance abuse;     It reins in paranoia.

98, 5, Bipolar (both phases) insomnia,"One has to weigh the benefits vs. side effects and risks. Seroquel has contributed to significant weight gain and produces a significant ""spacy"" feeling which is unsettling if I try to ""fight"" this side effect. Of course_ that's not a problem if I go to bed within 20 minutes of taking it. Should I wake up in the middle of the nite_ I'm disoriented and have walked into walls_ etc. Also if I get up too quickly upon waking_ I sometimes feel dizzy and have some breathing problems. I sometimes have problems climaxing if I wait to long after I take my dose.  On the positive side_ Seroquel has been very effective in drastically reducing my depressive phases and_ on the manic side_ slows my racing thoughts & brings clarity when my thoughts start to deteriorate into mild paranoia & delusions. Seroquel dramatically CALMS me down both mentally & physically. Sure this drug has a lot of side effects (and can contribute to metabolic syndrome & cataracts) but it keeps me out of the hospital and the morgue for that matter!

107, 5, Major depressive disorder_ generali,After the first few days out of the psyche ward I was prescribed this: 300 mg twice a day. I did not know how I would ever take this drug during the day as it made me extremely tired.  It was wonderful at night for the insomnia_ but the grogginess at the time my alarm went off in the morning was immense.  I felt like crying for no reason.  I had suicidal thoughts_ an empty lethargic feeling and an appetite like a bear.  I persevered_ and allowed my body to build up a resistance.  Eventually the extreme tiredness during the day eased off and the negative effects dissipated..I sometimes get this tight feeling or a pain in my chest_ above my heart.  Sometimes it feels like there is a piece if ice stuck in my heart as crazy as it sounds.  My herat beats fast sometimes.I have gained 15Kgs but this may also be from the Remron_ I am not sure.I feel very lazy at times_ battling to do basic home chores.  This drug has the potential to diminish ambition_ or creative expression,Second to Zyprexa_ this is a miracle drug for me.  I am more stable in my moods_ my anxiety is lowered and my depression is relieved.  I highly recommend that anyone taking Seroquel persevere for the first two weeks until the really horrible tiredness goes way.  Then see if it works for you.,M,47,6  months300 2X D,9/4/2013Email,Seroquel
108, 3, insomnia,weight gain.  pounding heart at night_ which is now permanent. Makes you want to sleep  all the time.,I started taking this medication for insomnia. Which_ it works great for. but_ I would not recommend  long term as getting off of it it a nightmare. This medication stopped putting me to sleep when I started taking lithium bicarbonate for anxiety. I stopped sleeping. I went to a sleep Dr. for some new medication and she told me to stopped it cold Turkey_ which nearly killed me. She thought I would just go back to sleep in 24 hours which didn't happen. This medication destroyed my ability to be able to fall asleep on own. It putting me in a hyper state of arousal many weeks not sleeping at all sometimes_ maybe only getting a few hours a sleep a night if that. Going off cold turkey also messed my brain up making me puck every time I get anxious. I  just wanted everyone to know that this is a very dangerous medication. Do the research yourself_ many people who get off this medication loose the ability to fall back sleep and have to go back on seroquel with a whole bunch of other drugs.,F,33,3  years200 1X D,8/25/2013Email,Seroquel
109, 2, Depression/Anxiety,Dry mouth_ forgetfulness_ clumsiness_ and intense sleepiness were the only side effects at first. Over time the sleepiness (which I needed to get to sleep at night) dissipated_ and coupled with my anxiety would make bedtime like a bad trip. Everything looks weird_ makes me panicky.,It never did seem to help my depression_ though it did help me sleep at first. The dose was constantly upped after the effects would wane. The cons outweigh the pros_ I would not recommend this. Maybe it would work better for someone else but after the first few months the positive effects went away and now I just take it because my doctor tells me to.,F,25,2  years400MG 1X D,8/13/2013,Seroquel

The last night I took it I had eaten powdered laundry detergent and passed out on the floor_ I don't remember doing that but the evidence was encrusted on my face and in my nose.,Withdrawal was a 6 week ordeal it was not fun_ but nothing in comparison with SSRI withdrawal. 2 years earlier Paxil kicked off my psychotic symptoms about 30 minutes after the first pill and it has been permanent ever since_ for something that was just suppose to take the edge off with no risk of side effects it has cost me everything.,M,35,75  days800mg 1X D,6/11/2013,Seroquel

Unless you are schizophrenic not worth the risk.   Had insomnia when I had to discontinue for a period. Felt weird joint pain_ slightly sweaty palms and forgot tons of stuff.

119, 5, Depression,First two weeks approximately: Severe drownsiness_ impaired mental function (poorer memorisation of new information_ worse ability to recall memories_ less effective at problem solving)_ continuing extensive fantasies about self-mutilation and suicide. THESE SIDE EFFECTS TAPERED OFF OVER THE FIRST TWO WEEKS_ after which I experienced some lethergy in the mornings compared to normal (but much lighter than the first fortnight)_ apparently normal brain function re: memories and doing tasks_ significant reduction in the frequency of suicidal fantasies_ no fantasies of self-mutilation_ and the feeling that when my mood tried to crash it could only fall to a certain point.,SUMMARY: In exchange for two difficult weeks and the need to be strict about my bedtime_ I am now free from debilitating bouts of depression and largely free from my fantasies. Worth it_ for me. I can feel upset_ emotionally hurt_ and angry_ but never seemed able to fall into the full_ black horror of depression_ even though my brain is clearly trying to fire me down that path. No fantasies of self-mutilation_ and suicidal thoughts decreased from ~4 fantasies a day to less than 1 a week.I would suggest informing your boss if you start on Seroquel while working. I started my prescription over a weekend_ set my alarm for the early bus to work_ and still crawled through my morning routine and arrived late. It is a good job that I take the bus to work_ as I would not have driven! Throw in a likely increase in errors due to tiredness and the fuzzy-thinking as the brain adapts to the drug_ and you have a potential reciped for a Friday 'performance management' meeting.After the first fortnight I experienced no problems at work that were caused by my Seroquel prescription - error rate and productivity normal. However_ if I miss a couple of hours sleep for 2+ consecutive nights I find that I am over-tired and need to sleep for longer to 'catch up' compared to normal.I am not taking any other medication.,M,30,7  months150MG 1X D,5/19/2013Email,Seroquel

It was embarrassing to be honest.,Yes. The side-effects were bad_ but not the worst of any drug I have been on.

Well_ the first night I took it_ it knocked my butt out like a light. But whenever I'd wake up briefly during the night_ I'd notice my heart was beating extremely fast and heavy and my mouth felt so parched that it was actually painful to swallow. These side effects happened every time I took a dose_ which was as-needed. Sometimes the rapid heartbeat would scare me and I would just try to ignore it and fall asleep_ which I always would. The dry mouth I learned to just deal with. If I didn't go to bed within two hours of taking it_ I would walk around the house very disoriented. I am grateful it put me to sleep_ but eventually the side effects were just too much of a hassle and I quit using it. I still have some_ but now I'd only take it in an emergency.

So when 50 didn't work_ I would lower it_ and then higher it. After a year on this crappy drug I gave up. I had started to smoke and drink coffee every morning since I couldn't seem to get up.

The first night I took it_ I fell asleep quickly and woke up hours later with a pounding heart. It wasn't enough to make me call 911 or anything_ just a little scary. I laid back down and fell right back to sleep with no problem. In the morning_ my mouth felt incredibly dry and my throat was raw_ like I'd slept with a powerful fan pointed at me. I was also so parched that I had to run for a glass of water right away. I asked my doctor about this_ specifically the pounding heart_ and he says it is known to do that sometimes but he wouldn't be concerned. With continued use_ all of these side effects other than the pounding heart upon waking in the middle of the night disappeared. I would only notice it when I would wake up_ but if I went right back to sleep_ I was fine. I stopped taking it after a month because I wanted to try something that didn't have this side effect_ even though it wasn't unbearable.

Worst drug reaction I've ever had_ even worse than an antibiotic that made my face swell.  I now list this among my allergies.

157, 5, Insomnia,No side effects.,The doctor prescribed this medication for me to help me sleep after other methods and drugs failed.  I don't have a problem falling asleep but I have a problem staying asleep because I have a very active mind. I started out with 25 MG taken at bedtime but the doctor had to increase the dose every few weeks as my body got used to the medication.  My maintenance dose finally came out to 300 MG and I have been taking this for 7 years now.  I do feel groggy in the morning especially when I don't get my 8 hours of sleep but it's a small price to pay for restful sleep. I did find that taking the medication on a full stomach lessens the sedating effect of the drug. I am a bit worried about getting tardive dyskinesia in the future though the chances are slim as this is an atypical antipsychotic. Nevertheless_ the risk is worth it.,M,47,7  years300 MG 1X D,8/18/2012,Seroquel
158, 5, Bad reaction to Paxil,,"This medicine saved my life!  I was diagnosed with major depression and panic disorder back in 1999 at age 16 and was placed on Paxil by my psychiatrist.  I experienced SEVERE mood swings (euphoria and rage)_ hallucinations_ night terrors_ and blackout periods.  The final straw was suicidal thoughts.  My mom called the doctor and he immediately took me off the Paxil ""cold turkey"" and put me on Seroquel for 2 weeks while the Paxil got out of my system.  It calmed my mood swings and made me tolerable to be around again.  I also stopped experiencing suicidal thoughts.  I am not bipolar_ but this saved me when I experienced a chemical reaction very similar to bipolar disorder.",F,16,14  days60mg 1X D,8/17/2012,Seroquel
159, 1, Insomnia,Horrible nightmares. I wake up feeling like I am coming out of a terrifying situation every morning but have no real memories of what the situation is. It's just the worst experience I've ever been through. Except for not sleeping for nights at a time. Also I have no memory and am drugged feeling all day. After I take it at night it makes me higher than a kite. I am sure some people would pay for such a high. I can't stress how horrific I feel waking up after this drug. Also I sweat and the smell is awful. And my muscles are so tight in my neck all the way down my back that I can't move my head.b,Before this drug I was complaining that I never ever dreamed. I would love to never dream again after this experience. I was on about a year ago and went off of it because of the horrible dreams and terrors upon waking. They never went away after quitting for at least a year. So I decided to try it again for sleep. Biggest mistake. 25 mgs were pretty hard to get off of. I don't know how I'll get off of 50 mgs. It seems certain that the drug has already affected my brain chemistry and the effects are permanent. That is disturbing to me. Seroquel has totally changed my life for the worse. I don't mean to seem dramatic but sometimes I'd rather die than go to sleep knowing the way I'm going to feel when I wake up in the morning. I'm so doped at all times that it's even hard for me to write this. I keep losing my thoughts. I have a business to run and this state of mind is not ok. I know that everybody is different but I can't imagine what it must be like to be taking a high dose of the stuff. Also_ my body has built a tolerance to it fast. I started on 25 mg a month ago and am already up to 50 mg. I wish that when I went off the 25 mg a year ago I would have never touched the stuff again. It was pretty hard coming off 25 mg. another concern I have is that doctors are pushing this drug like crazy. I know a lot of people who have taken it or are taking it for various_ mostly off label reasons. In my opinion seroquel is a nightmare. Literally.,F,43,4  weeks50mg 1X D,8/15/2012Email,Seroquel

I still have the hallucinations_ but they are not as intrusive as they were.  I also take abilify and venlafaxine_ so at the moment I'm on two anti psychotics_ which is not recommended in the long term.  I'll come off the quetiapine when I'm a bit better_ but having read the posts_ I'll do it slowly.

Sometimes I go outside or stand over ac vent place a wash cloth on my head and try to wait for the feeling to subside. sometimes its over 15 minutes. 2 days ago got 45minutes of sleep and was miserable.  At first the med didn't do this to me_ with the exception of dry mouth. I went on generic from Canada of SR and don't remember the palpatations and sweats.

I am weak_ shaky and totally agitated_ as I can barely function I was unable to reach the Dr. who Rx them and so went to e.r with anafalaxis type shock. I feel way sicker than I ever have and I have had 2 recent total hip replacements_ which was a walk in the park compared to this. I am not getting better and am afraid of convulsion and if I can't get the swelling sharp pain of neck_ lips mouth and throat. I feel so bad that I reviewed ""Final Exit"" and if you don't know what that is about_ lease do not look into it. It gets etched in your brain and seems like a logical solution. I am taking benedryl and have no relief. I would encourage anyone to do extensive research on any pharmacy drugs before jumping off that cliff. I will never take another Rx. I will be surprised if I even live through the night.I have never felt such severe pain. I suppose this is what it feels like for someone who is allergic to seafood feels after a seafood cocktail. Speaking of cocktails....I am going to have one because the Spurs lost last night and they are my team. Blessings on anyone having health issues. I also would suggest before making appoints with any doctor...to go online and be sure she/he is boarded by the state (geographically) in_ and I hope everyone has a better state of mind.

When I was first started on seroquel in 2007 at 600mg 1x/day_ I was Extremely manic which included having delusions and hallucinations. It took some time for it to kick in. I remember still having delusions when first starting the  medication.  For some reason though I kept taking it even though I've always hated taking psych meds and have stopped and started them soo many times.  In about a month is when I started to become ""normal"" again.   After the delusions and mania stopped I felt very lethargic and depressed  since I was on such a high dose. Long story short_ over the past 5-6 years_ my dose has been decreased to 50mg_ which is what I am taking now.  This med has been a lifesaver for me and although it sucked putting weight on_ it's better then being mentally sick. Also take lamictal 200mg/day_ wellbutrin 75mg 2x/day_ vistaril 25mg prn anxiety.

God is with me so I am okay_ I am a believing lies about myself but I am asking God to continue to show me the Truth and how He sees me.

I am concerned about long term impact and wonder if this has made permanent changes to my brain.  I am complacent about things that used to bother me in the past.  I know and remember but don't care about them.  I am not a good medicine taking person and I think this may be why my doctor gave this to me.  I am definitely compliant now and don't care.  I have mixed feelings about this but seems that the drug wins out in the end.  It is good to be able to relax but this drug at least for me takes away most of your emotions and zombie would be an exaggeration but since i am now very compliant and accepting person with little interest in or desire to resist anything.  I guess I would say that it makes me more pliable and just happy to be and let the world go by.  Since I remember how I was_ wonder sometimes if this is a good think long term.

The side effects of this drug are awful_ truly life-changing in a negative way. After about half an hour of taking it you become very sleepy and must go to bed. You get off to sleep very quickly. In the morning it is very hard to get up and wake up even. My mum was waking me up several times - I would sleep through alarms and would just go back to sleep without even knowing. I would get up late_ I missed a lot of college. I could not cry and wasn't laughing as much on this drug - surpressed emotions. I could not concentrate on work and my memory was bad. Hard to read large chunks of text. On coming off this drug I have become more alert_ my emotions have returned and I am no longer tired.

Certainly I am as forgetful as patients with Alzheimer's.,"Avoid this medication at all costs.  Trazedone would be a better choice for a sleep aid.  It's an antidepressant with sedating potential.  Another problem with Seroquel is that is potentiates any other medications you may be taking.  This means that Seroquel literally strengthens these meds.

It helped me fall asleep and stay asleep_ though it left me very foggy brained in the morning and while trying to fall asleep_ my legs would feel restless.  Gradually_ I have lowered the dose over the years_ so I now take 300-400 mg nightly.  I think this drug has been very helpful for me.  At times_ I have tried to wean myself off of it and find it very difficult.  I don't sleep very well_ if at all and I experience nausea and diarreah.  And so I continue to take it.  Have not experienced weight gain from this drug.I would like to know if anyone succesfully quit this drug.  I am worried about long term side effects.  I have improved my diet over the year by eating whole foods and taking supplements.  I've eliminated most processed foods and alcohol.  I also exercize regularly and practice yoga.

239, 4, Initially as sleeping aid.,The seroquel barely gives me any side effects_ except for constipation_ but no excessive sedation in spite of 900 mg a day_ in fact no sedation at all.,While reading about people's experiences regarding seroquel withdrawal i got scared shitless_ because my p doc said its not addictive_ which is true for not having to take more and more for the same effect_ but which is untrue for how you feel after you stop taking it behind a more or less longer period. I also take methadone and the seroquel strengthens that medication this as a side note so you can count on strengthening of other meds who act on the central nerve system like for example benzodiazepines. What my 900 mg dose does to me is basically flatlining my emotions so that means i dont feel grief as bad as it would be without seroquel_ but i also dont feel pleasures. I take my last 300 mg before sleep and since taking the seroquel i found that in the nights it would give me vivid dreams. I live in the NL so a script worth 700 euros a month comes for free. So far and best luck to all who like to discontinue seroquel_. because that seems to be hard and when my time comes i will stop the seroquel trough a slow taper.

256, 1, Doctor forced me to try it.,"I'm a 72 year old grandmother with a history of major depression since age 19.  I was basically manipulated into taking this drug at the Kaiser Permanente clinic. I had a very severe cognitive breakdown that was absolutely terrifying. I could not think of the simple first names of three people in my neighborhood. I felt as if I could not organize the words as they flowed out of my mouth.  This was absolutely the worst reaction to any medication that I had ever taken. My ""prescribing"" psychiatrist has been on me to try different drugs for years. My original diagnosis was clinical depression_ and I was taking Pamelor. One day_ he changed my diagnosis from ""mood disorder"" to ""Bipolar 1 Disorder"" and basically railroaded me into the hospital. It was breathtaking. Two other psychiatrists tried to commit me_ but the court officer dismissed the case. This case will go down in my history as I try to amend_ redact or even SEAL the whole experience because of mistak",This drug will be added to my allergies. As a matter of fact_ I have decided that most of my life is working quite well_ and I do not plan to try any other drugs until I figure out how I can make behavior therapy work better for me.,F,72,1  days90 mg 1X D,7/17/2011Email,Seroquel

In my opinion the pros outweighed the cons- even though i hated how depressed and tired i sometimes felt while first on seroquel_ i still think i needed the intervention and it was probably a life saver. i see it as first aid rather than a long term solution because of its side-effects though.,F,30,1  years300-25 1X D,7/6/2011Email,Seroquel

Fortunately I regained 'feeling' down there after a week or so. With those side effects_ I was about to give up until I got a new doc who recommended Seroquel. I started off taking 50mg each night and I spoke with my doc about the extreme sedating effect and lack of energy so they dropped it to 25mg. DON'T ask me how some of these other individuals managed to function on 100-800mg each day?! That is absurd! I would be a bed ridden zombie if that was the dosage for me!

Over the course of the six months that I took 100mg per day_ I had gained over 20 pounds.

My levels were that dangerously high.  I immediately contact my prescribing doctor and told her I wanted off the medication asap.  I weaned off it over a three week period.  It's been about a year since I'm off it.  Some of the weight has come off and I'm not as 'puffy' as I was.  My blood work is still not great but is slowly going back to normal.

Neuroleptic drugs slowly kill you and it is harder and harder to withdraw (sleep):1) never start antipsychotics or antidepressants 2) people typically die in 10 years or so3) brain damage and its harder and harder to sleep without quetiapine4) if you have used seroquel for longer periods DO NOT ABRUPTLY STOPIf you have recently started and you are using it for mild symptoms (insomnia?) => go to neurologist specialized for sleep ASAPUse benzos for sleep or maybe certain antidepressants but use a GOOD doctor you can trust because there are pitfalls in many medications used for sleep. (in general you cannot use anything for longer periods for sleep without serious side-effects.)Use natural methods for sleep: aerobic exercise_ glycine 3-5g_ tryptophan_ magnesium_ l-arginine_ beetroot_ colostrum_ good bed and sleeping place etc.,M,30,999  years400 MG 1X D,1/10/2011,Seroquel

It allows me to sleep_ but not too much and keeps me at a fairly normal state of being all day. I havn't gained weight or felt like I was out of phase which is what Zyprexa did. I have tried several meds before the most effective being Zyprexa(Olanzapine) The side effects on that were brutal. Seroquel is 10 times more effective for me. I just checked my blood pressure and it has dropped quite a bit since the last time i checked before taking Seroquel. Another side effect which is beneficial for me is it reduces the craving for alchohol. I'm in sales and it has diminished my motivation somewhat.

I can relate as when I am taking_ nothing phases me.  Fear seems to melt away. Eat more_ slight weight gain_ three - five pounds.,Very effective for sleep.  I have taken on and off for three years.  I take when needed and will stop when I am getting lost.  Hard to describe but this medicine is very strong for me and seems to change my personality. When I feel like I am going past the point of no return I stop the medicine.  It takes a month or more for the real me to return.  I would sum it up like this. I am normaly a very intuitive fast learner who is interested in all aspects of life and living.  After a few days on Seroquel I become very complacent and pliable.  I remember the movie the Stepford Wives and I guess you could say that I am the Stepford Husband when taking this medicine.  I see why they give it for Bi-Polar as it certainly removes the highs and levels me out. Also it is the only medicine that I have ever taken that gives me a sense of peace and calm.  The only problem with that is it does not stop at that point_ wish it would.  After giving the sense of calm continues to numb mind and thinking ability.  I have not taken for two months and I am having difficulty sleeping again so will start tonight again.  Wanted to write this before as I will  not have initiative to write this after I take it.

I don't even think I have bipolar disorder and was diagnosed with it within a 20 minute intake interview before the doc even knew anything about me. (Pill pusher).

330, 1, Bipolar,Loss of muscle control and loss of memory,This shit is dangerous!!  After taking my bedtime dose_ I could not control my muscles.  I was unable to lift my legs and arms to get into bed.  All I could do was pull a pillow to the floor and then sleep next to my bed until a few hours later when it wore off.  Also_ I would wake up in the morning and walk into my kitchen to discover that I had been up during the night cooking/frying food_ which  I had no memory of whatsoever.  I was shocked when I saw the mess_ not to mention that I could have burned my house down! I gained 15 pounds and haven't been able to lose it since.  Worst of all_ I went out of town to visit an old friend.  I took my pill and have no memory after that.  In the morning_ my friend told me she had to carry me to bed because I couldn't walk.  She thought I was on some kind of illegal drug (I don't do drugs)_ or I was drunk (I don't drink).  I tried to explain the side effects I was having with Seroquel_ but apparently she didn't believe me because she hasn't talked to me ever since.  Very sad.  My doctor said he had never heard of this reaction from his other patients.  Seroquel was my worst nightmare.,F,63,12  months? 1X D,9/1/2010Email,Seroquel
331, 1, Insomnia,Went from about 130 to 200 pounds in about.. 4 months. Worst medication possible for sleeping_ it helped me sleep sure. I had realistic dreams of killing people_ nightmares_ I'd eat 3 meals a day which several servings_ I stopped dreaming after I stopped taking it for almost a year_ I don't care for life anymore_ anti-social_ feeling as if you can't relate to anyone. Zombie/sluggish to the point where you're an observer of life as it passes by each day.,This shit's horrible_ I strongly suggest you stop taking it_ or any other medication. There's a reason most of them CAUSE suicidal thoughts_ help sleeping or whatever they intend to help_ but in the end come back to bite you in the ass with their side effects_ some short and others long that cripple your life_ socially/personally/ and mentally. I use to love life_ now I can't get motivated to do anything. You could put a gun to my head and threaten me_ I'd take the bullet.,M,18,8  months250 1X D,8/30/2010,Seroquel
332, 4, Major depression - psychotic,Very heavy sedation for first few days_ not many side effects after that.,I found Seroquel to be very helpful. It greatly improved my mood_ and also made me feel calm and less agitated - stable. I did find it increadibly sedating for the first few days_ to the point where I almost slept non-stop for several days. This quickly wore off_ and I found myself able to function normally (though I was always reluctant to drive as I did feel that my spatial awareness was still affected even though I did not feel drowsy).I didn't have any sexual side effects_ though soon after taking a tablet the sedative affect would probably mean your libido would be lower for a few hours.I did find that when I was first put on a high dose that it can have a temporary paralysing effect_ in that for the first time at a high dose you may find yourself paralysed and unable to move_ walk etc. This only occured on my first night at high dosage_ and didn't recur again.Overall_ I have found this drug to be very effective_ and with very few side effects_ and it does also help with getting a good night sleep as many have said.,M,35,4  months100 2X D,8/29/2010,Seroquel

I don't think seroquel agrees with me even on 25mg a day I still get the side effects I listed. No where near as severe as when I was taking 200mg but it still messes with my cognitive functioning.That having been said given my previous experiences with other anti psychotics seroquel's side effects are mild.

It's a strenuous job but I've been doing it for years_ and never had fatigue problems like this. I started Seroquel for sleep and anxiety when it was still cold and overcast outside. Around mid-April_ when it started to get hot_ my muscles would fatigue seemingly out of nowhere when I was outside_ muscles I wasn't even using. My body temp spikes out of nowhere. The rest of the time I cant concentrate_ and it's a strain to do anything. I've taken it_ fallen asleep_ then bolted upright in bed like someone had shocked me. There are other effects_ but I'll stop there. Bottom line_ I wouldn't recommend this med to anyone. Yikes.,M,28,8  months100 1X D,8/22/2010Email,Seroquel

I did sleep and have very vivid dreams (terror dreams) but did not touch the depression. eating like crazy at night_ restless legs start 20 minutes after taking.

All of a sudden_ I felt a strong_ electric-shock like sensation_ like I was being tased or something and my trunk area of my body began to convulse. I have never experienced anything like this ever before. Then_ as I was falling asleep I had a few extreme_ random movements of my limbs; including my arm shooting into the air_ jerking my upper body violently. I'm not exaggerating any of this.

Sometimes_ I have to get dressed and run around the block a couple of times. In six years my weight has gone from 145lbs to 206lbs. Currently_ I weigh 188. I work in a laboratory. I have noticed that my fasting blood sugars have been creeping up a little higher than I like. For the last several months_ I have been very manic_ and filled with anxiety. I am taking myself off this drug.,In the beginning_ Seroquel mad me sleep like a baby.The first night I took it_ I fell a sleep on my dinner plate. I have been thinking of quitting seroquel for the last couple of years. I have not been sleeping for the last two years_ so the medication is no longer working for the reason it was prescribed. Tonight_ I'm going to cut my dose from 200mg to 150mg. I will do this for a week.

After my brother was brutally murdered in a home robbery I basically went nuts. I lost it completely_ could not hang on_ yelled and cried_ cut myself_ grinder my fists into concrete_ bad shit. Seroquel stopped it. It stopped the visions of my dead brother_ it stopped the auditory hallucinations of the phone call from my mom telling me that my brother had been shot dead.

343, 3, Bipolar NOS,I was first prescribed 100 mg seroquel to lift the depressive part of the bipolar. It had the opposite effect_ my depression became far worse_ I was drousy all the time and in a fog. Later when  the dose was changed to 300 mg XR I noticed the mood lifted. However this was shortlived and the depression returned within 2 months. Now since I'm taking so many drugs I don't know which one is doing what_ except I think the seroquel is perhaps responsible for treating the insomnia. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal_ 20 mg of abilify_ 30 mg Buspar_ and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

I am also on Risperdal Consta Injections and taking this medicine helps keep me from noticing when the Injections wear off. I feel great all the time. The increased appetite was helped by the doctor adding Topamax to my medications (also helps with my mood). Seroquel helps me sleep at night and doesn't make me tired the next day.

Seroquel ex: on 50mg I get manic on 100mg I cycle low. It takes a good 4-5 hours for it to kick in. If I take it too late i'm screwed the next day cause I will be drowsy until like mid day",I love the immediate release. I slept great_ felt fantastic_ and didn't really cycle. The only problem was the weight gain. The ex seroquel isn't great. I have to time it perfectly to get a good nights sleep and its still not the deep sleep that I enjoyed before. I've had to play with my dosage because it's had quite a different effect on how I cycle. If I take 100mg then I get depressed_ if I take 50mg then I get hardcore manic. I've been taking 50 one day and 100 the next to see if that helps. The only reason why I take this is because I have had any weight gain_ I pretty much lost all of my weight_ I'm nt hungry like I was before.

347, 1, anxiety_ stress_ some insomnia,No many side-effects during use. After withdrawal I CANNOT sleep and this causes major mental health problems. Seroquel had either changed my sleep architecture or permanently damaged my serotonin receptors/systems.,Using doses (<200mg/day) seem to cause brain damage/insomnia as well as using only a high single dose per day (instant release).Taking BCAA supplements before bedtime (after discontinuation) seem to help with insomnia symptoms (BCAA reduces dopamine and serotonin).,M,29,3  years400 1X D,7/19/2010,Seroquel
348, 3, Bipolar Disorder for Mania,Weight gain_ sleeping too much_ bad dreams,I have been prescribed Seroquel for about two years.  The plus of this medication is that it is the only anti-psychotic I have taken that doesn't give me a serious physical reaction.  Another good thing about this medication is that it made it possible for me to quit taking anti-anxiety medication.  It is a sleepy enough medication to take care of any anxiety as well.  It can actually take care of mania too. But_ I want to quit because the dreams I have on this medication are pretty bad.  They are extremely vivid.  At first_ I got kind of a kick out of how real the dreams were but now they become bad nightmares at times.  My psychiatrist has suggested that maybe it is becoming a little to concentrated in my system_ so I break the pill into a smaller piece and that seems to help.  My problem is that if I try to stop taking it_ even after staggering it into smaller doses for awhile_ I can't quit it.  I can't sleep if I try to make it through the night without it.  I hate it now_ because sometimes I can't wake up on time_ and my other doctors keep warning me that it could cause diabetes and I have a bad family history of diabetes.  But_ I can't quit_ it keeps me from Mania and my doctor is against me quitting.  Think twice if you can stay away from this medication.,F,41,2  years150 mg. 1X D,7/14/2010,Seroquel

350, 3, Bipolar Disorder,Massive weight gain_ possibly addictive? Far too sedating too quickly.,I am currently being weaned off Seroquel. My dose over five years has ranged from 50mg twice daily to 500mg a day. It hasn't really worked for my mania or anxiety_ but I do now get a decent night's sleep for the first time in my life. However_ as my Psych Doc pointed out_ sleeping tablets would do the same thing so I'm being taken off it. I gained five stone (70 lbs) on this stuff_ but have gotten that off now and am being placed on Lamictal. What pains me is that I knew it wasn't working for me for five years and told the doctors this and they argued with me until last year_ when suddenly the reports about Seroquel started to filter through and they realised that we_ the patients_ were right. I accept that for some people it's wonderful and like all meds_ it's a lottery as to which works for each of us_ but the doctors need to listen when we say something isn't doing the job. We inhabit our skulls_ and we know when something is amiss.,F,36,5  years250mg 1X D,7/4/2010,Seroquel
351, 5, Bipolar Depression/Sleep,It causes my nose and sinuses to close up tighter than a drum_    sometimes creating an alarming sensation of choking or suffocating.  I think it also causes swelling of the prostate_  making it difficult to pee when you want to.,"I generally have been pleased with SEROQUEL.     Starting in my middle-age_  I have been plagued with insomnia...   racing thoughts very much a part of that.     I had tried ""baby"" sleep aids like RESTORIL and AMBIEN_   but they were just pi$$-in-the-ocean:   Basically I am like an elephant in the wild who needs to be brought down with a dart of elephant tranquilizer!   So I needed a more ""heavy duty"" sleep aid like SEROQUEL.  A relative of mine takes about 700mg daily for schizo-affective disorder...   There is no way in hell I could take a dosage like that_  because 100mg alone is enough to knock me out cold for hours_   swell up my nasal passages completely and dry up my mouth.SEROQUEL does indeed allow me to sleep like a baby for about 8--12 hours_  and get plenty of refreshing REM sleep_  too.    In fact_   it is the first good sleep I have had in all my adult years.   I am just naturally ""wired"" by nature_  and SEROQUEL eases that.Interestingly_  once you awaken_  you are not groggy at all...     10 minutes_  say_  for the fog to lift...  and you're good.I have in fact_  gained much weight since I've been on psych meds (ten years now)  and have developed Type 2 Diabetes as well...     but I attribute these developments more to DEPAKOTE...   which I'll ""diss"" on a different page...As a diabetic_  I probably should not be taking a drug which metabolizes in the liver (as SEROQUEL does)...

It's not helping with the OCD part_ if anything it's made it worse. But I no longer freak out in situations I can't control. I'm just more organized if anything. It helps with my lack of sleep_ it's easy for me to get 8+ hours a night when before I started taking Seroquel I slept maybe three hours a night if that. It does take me awhile to actually get up and function in the morning when usually I'd be up and fully alert within a minute. No weight gain as I'm good at managing my weight_ but I do feel hungry ALL THE TIME. But self control helps_ lol.,F,16,6  weeks100mg 1X D,6/29/2010,Seroquel

I also lost my ability to communicate and express how I felt which made things worse with the friendships I had with people_ which eventually destroyed those relationships and made me more depressed.  I now know how people feel when they say these drugs turn you into zombies.  I have vowed to never again take this drug ever again to let big pharma get a hold of my life.  I have never been more lonely than  I have been after taking this drug_ I started to develop mild schizophrenia during and after it; not to mention severe withdrawal and ""brain zaps"".  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this drug_ oh by the way I use to like smoking bud from time to time but I can't even do that now because it worsens my anxiety and panic attacks. I think the worst part was not being able to just be myself_ I felt as if I was desperate most of the time when at social functions and the uncontrollable eye movement only made things worse with the opposite sex.

Seroquel for me did have a huge therapeutic tendency when I took it at the right time but the day after was a completely different story. I would constantly be agitated and fatigued and had a lot of difficulties functioning in the real world. But once I got used to juggling my social life with the side effects things somehow worked out especially when I was taking an anti-convulsant  with the seroquel. About a year ago I was taken off of this drug because I had gone from 120 pounds to 160 and was severely anxious and depressed_ I then got a balance disorder shortly afterwards and was put back on it and eventually taken off of it again when I noticed that It was making me really moody and depressed.,M,21,7  years25 MG 1X D,6/9/2010,Seroquel

Terrible wind and stomach pains_ and possibly the worst side effect_ which I had no idea was a side effect until I weaned myself off them - urinary leakage/incontinence.  Gross. I am only 47_ and that really killed my confidence.

I have 4 left in the bottle b/c I refuse to take them. I only took 1 tiny pill at a time-cannot remember the dosage but I think it was 25?  This pill knocked me on my ass.  It would put me out for 12 hours at a time-wake up-stumble to the bathroom_ attempt to shower or get dressed_ and would end up collapsing back onto the bed for another 4 hours.  After I'd finally be able to wake up (which was HARD) I was in a fog for the rest of the day.  No drug has ever gripped me the way this one has_ it is completely overpowering and I have not a small woman.

My legs ache continually_ when I am at church I have to leave because of the sweating.  I now can add high blood pressure_ anemia_ canker sores and again the list goes on.  What really upsets me is I have been compaining of these side effects for 6 months without anyone helping me.  My Dr. is soo pleased with my progress_ I am actually stable for the first time in years that he is not listening to me.  At what expense is it worth it????

371, 5, Skitzo Effective Bipolar 1,weight gain....I gained about a hundred pounds over the years but that was not all seroquels fault. Seroquel has helped me live a normal life. I was on 11 psychiatric medications at one point_ trying to stop hallucinations_ voices_ mania and depression as well as mixed episodes and paranoia.... as soon as I started taking seroquel... I started evening out. Its been 7 years since I was in the mental hospital. I now own my own small business and  have been doing very well. It did not cure me... but it sure came damn close... especially when it was added with trileptal. The combination was a miracle for me.....but the minute Im off of them all hell breaks loose. 1 down side.... seroquel messes with my blood sugar levels... makes me crave starch very badly_ and also messes with my vision. I think it may also screw with my cognition sometimes If I dont get a full 8 hours sleep i can wake up confused. I suggest taking the XR because its much more easily tolerated (for me it was) and it will,Good medication. Helped me a great great deal.

But it corrected itself_ or I wouldn't be on it.,"Though there are side effects_ seroquel has helped me like no other pill has before. I went through so many pills trying to find one to ""fix"" me.

Though there are major withdraw symptoms if my perscription is late_ it dosen't take but two days and things are normal. I keep a regular check on my sugar because diabetes are in my family. But have had no problems yet. The only problem Is the weight gain. If it levels out and dosen't get to drastic_ then I don't care. I would recomend seroquel to anyone needing help with depression_bi-polar_anxiety_OCD. It effects everyone differently_ and I think it's worth a try.

386, 1, For sleep and to calm behavior,Trembling_ shaking_ rigid arms_ muscles constantly moving in calves_ weakness in muscles_ difficulty walking_ body jerks,"My husband was being treated by dr. for dementia_ unable to sleep_ wandering at night_ so was given Seroquel to help him sleep and calm his behavior.  He immediately began sleeping at least 10 hours_ wetting the bed because he didn't wake up.  Then he was in a zombie-like daze most of the time_ stopped knowing or being aware of what was going on.  Staring spells.  After 6 months_ he began having ""body jerks"" where he would be sitting holding a cup of coffee and involuntarily threw the coffee everywhere.  I spoke to the dr. who asked if I wanted him to sleep or have these jerking spells_ he seemed to get angry that I was questioning the use of Seroquel.  3 months later_ my husband began taking little bitty steps_ having to be assisted_ 3 months ago_ he began shaking as if he were shivering_ he would shake the whole bed.  Two weeks ago his neurologist (who prescribed Seroquel) saw him for a routine visit and was shocked at how he had deteriorated and said IT WAS THE SEROQUEL!   DUH!  He said it could cause rigidity and trembling.  He advised me to cut back the dosage to 25 mg once every other day.  Guess what!  I stopped it.  After 3 days the shaking stopped_ but he still has the muscle movement in his legs and difficulty walking_ not quite as bad_ but it's still there.  My advice:  Don't take this crap_ it can affect you in ways you never dreamed of_ maybe long term_ I will have to wait and see.

I did not feel well on venlafaxine (up to 400 mg daily)_ nor lots of other meds_ mainly due to constantly feeling tired & unable to cope. Nothing has helped me to get my life back together after initially being diagnosed with Post Natal Depression over 8 years ago. Have recently tried bipolar meds - lithium (Priadel 800 mg) with & without venlafaxine_ then Lamotrigine (Mogine 50mg twice daily +37.5 mg venlafaxine) but felt that these meds just dulled my senses & made my really apathetic (not happy or sad_ just kinda zombified).I have lots of sinus problems (dust mite allergy + food intolerances (salicylates & dairy)) which got worse post-natal / worse with depression.  I take sinus meds (loratidine 10mg twice daily + butacort 100 aqueous nasal spray 2 puffs twice daily).I have just (after reading comments on this website) convinced Dr (4th psychiatrist I've been to) to prescribing an alternate = zopliclone_ even thou I have experienced similar 'hangover' effects with it in past_ now she says to just try taking 1/2 x 7.5 mg tablet.Has anyone found anything better to take?

I passed out for about 4 hours during which my 6 week old was screaming right next to me. According to my husband I did not even stir. When I awoke after a few hours on my own I continued to become aggressive and extreme anger set in. This is all according to my husband as I do not remember anything that happened that night or the next 24 hours. I said cruel and horrible things to my husband to the extent that he was going to have me committed and file for a divorce. I was appalled to hear everything I said to him that night. I would never_ never_ never take this drug again as it almost ruined my marriage after one dose. It took about 24 hours to fully get out of my system during which I gave my newborn a bath and did not even remember doing it. It was almost like I missed an entire day. Very_ very_ very bad drug!!!

After the hangover side effect wore off_ I know I'll get 7 hours of sleep every night (important for stability). I haven't had a bipolar episode in over a year & I think it has a great deal to do with seroquel(plus my tegretol & intermittant prozac...and staying med complaint for once in my life). Depending on where my mood is going_ I take between 200-400mg nightly. I do have to stop using it for 1 & 1/2 months a year due to being on call for work b/c I will not wake up if I have taken it.

I was scared about taking an anti-psychotic. I wonder if my impaired cognitive abilities has something do with it_ etc. So I didn't take it for two weeks. Last night I was desperate and took 25 mg along with some other anti-psychotic (melperone hydrochloride). I had the worst night ever: really terrifying dreams and had to sleep very long into the day in order to calm down and get some proper rest. I admit_ I did take benzos at the same time_ so maybe it was all too much... however this makes me seriously doubt that seroquel is good for you.,F,43,1  days,2/3/2010Email,Seroquel
402, 5, Panic Disorder/Anxiety,Dry Mouth_ Sleepiness_ memory is effected badly_ I burned my hand because of it_ don't do anything dangerous on the drug_ even driving until you get used to it.,This is pretty much an excellent drug.  I've never gone passed 50mgs_ I don't know how some people can go that high as it knocks me flat on my ass.  Even 10 mgs will put me to sleep.  I had problems with panic attacks and obsessive thinking_ this drug will shut down invasive thoughts and allow me to enjoy life around me.   I've been off and on the drug.  Worst part about leaving the drug is you're guaranteed insomnia and it'll be hard to find anything to replace it.,M,27,3  years,2/2/2010Email,Seroquel
403, 1, Anxiety/Misdiagnosed bipolar,This drug sucked the life out of me - there is no other way to say it. I couldn't function; I couldn't remember if I had eaten a meal. I was a zombie. Waking me each morning was a task for friends. It did long term cognitive damage. Please_ please don't take this,The bipolar was misdiagnosed - actually anxiety disorder,F,23,6  months,1/31/2010,Seroquel
404, 5, Bipolar 2 - fibromyalgia,Weight gain_ sleepiness,I was on this medication before_ during another med induced mania. It was a life saver_ but long term_ I was not pleased with the rapid weight gain. This time_ however_ my doctor is having me take pepcid ac with it to control the weight gain which seems to work.I ended up in a med induced mania while trying cymbalta for fibromyalgia. I had the worst pain and wanted to try anything to get out. The cymbalta did not work and put me in a mania. Immediately_ I went on seroquel to combat this_ as we knew it worked. Within days_ the pain was gone. I stopped taking it for a few days_ the pain came back. Started taking it again_ pain is gone. I am now experimenting with lower doses to try to get what works best for pain management with the lest side effects. I feel I stumbled into a life saver_ and it's something I'd like to share for others who may be having issues controlling fibro pain that nothing is working for. Worth talking to your doc about giving it a try.,F,33,1  months,1/28/2010,Seroquel

410, 4, I am Bipolar who does not sleep,I was perfectly happy with taking seroquel until my eye dr. told me that I now have cararacts,I like so many others I do not sleep. I can't go to sleep. I lay there for hours on end. I have been known to stay awake and alert for 2 weeks at a time. My Psyc. put me on seroquel. we played with dosage_ tweaked and added trazodone. I sleep better but still have nights where I only reach lala land. Yet I feel rested when I get up. Now I find out that I have caratacts caused by seroquel. I will have surgery to replace the lenses in my eyes. But what other drugs are out there to cause me to go to sleep? I've used lunesta and ambien with no effect.

I was prescribed this medication for insomnia. It did not put me to sleep but caused very wierd_ vivid dreams. I gained 20 pounds in 4 weeks! Craved food-mainly sugars and carbs. Felt lazy_ groggy_ and couldn't concentrate on anything during the day. Have taken myself off of it and have already lost 5 pounds in 1 week!

Eventually started taking way to much over 900mg a day n had to quit my job coz i was too tired n too hungrey to work . One thing i remember about seroquel was my life revolved around food and sleep. i would take the tablet _ eat but still be starving even though i ate heaps_ fall asleep for way to long _ then do it all again . I had no life SEROQUEL took over my life.... stopped COLD TURKEY _ was sick in bed for over two weeks_ never forgot how much pain n effort it was but was well worth it _ SEROQUEL is addictive  you crave that feeling it gives u even after you stop taking it.I have no idea y doctors prescribe this medicine when it only creates another problem.,F,23,9  months,1/13/2010,Seroquel

Take it past 9pm and you're definitely going to be groggy the next day.,6 months ago I couldn't go out. I would go to a restaurant or out shopping and have to leave because of how strong my panic attacks were. I also have a history of syncopy episodes related to severe attacks. But with seroquel_ along with effexor and topamax I feel like I got a huge chunk of my life back. I can drive_ go out_ I'm actually a semi-normal human being. My body does react badly to any change in doseage_ esp. lowering_ but it's beyond worth it to me. My new psychiatrist just lowered my dose and it made my anxiety regress so I have to call him in the AM to tell him to give me my old seroquel dose back...it truly was a life saver.,F,19,5  months,1/12/2010Email,Seroquel

I also suffer from insomnia; and Seroquel_ along with the Depakote puts me into a nice REM sleep. I'm easily affected by even the slightest change in dose though_ which can throw off my sleeping pattern. Just make sure you don't take it too late or are taking too high of a mg at night time because it will knock you out.,F,19,4  months,1/9/2010Email,Seroquel
416, 5, Bipolar,Drowsiness the next day for the first month_ this subsided the longer I was on the medication.  Constipation. Weight gain (20 plus pounds)My doctor has just prescribed Topiramate 25mg to help with weight gain,Dose:  325mg  Before taking this medication I went through about 4 manic and depressive cycles per year sometimes winding up hospitalized.  I also had mixed episodes and alot of anxiety and racing thoughts.  I also had trouble falling and staying asleep. Serequel ended all these symptoms.  I was VERY afraid to try this medication.  I was unresponsive to lithium.  Before being diagnosed as bipolar I was diagnosed as having post partum depression (on effexor 225 mg).  Previous to post partum I was diagnosed as depressive with parnoid characteristics (prescribed paxil_ prozac).  None of these medications worked.  Serequel has been a gift from God.  I feel like a whole person that can deal with the world as a normal person.

I feel more normal than I have in YEARS when taking this drug.  It has been a godsend- I have been through so many drugs that gave me incredible problems so severe I was disabled from the side effects.  Seroquel has helped my anxiety_ my insomnia_ my mania and mixed state episodes and also my depression.  I was on Risperdal and became so anxious I had constant long lasting panic attacks I was rehospitalized.  It also made me very very fidgety.  They gave me Seroquel to counteract it and it worked like a dream and I have been on it ever since.  I know the risks of weight gain and diabetes. But my weight gain hasn't been as bad as most people's on it_ my blood sugar has been normal so far but I keep an eye on it and even though some of the side effects are annoying_ it is much better than the hell I went through before I found this drug!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,F,32,3  years,12/19/2009,Seroquel

I will admit that I DEFINITELY slept while taking Seroquel.  I originally started this drug at 25 mg_ and have taken as much as 300 mg.  For the last six months I have taken 100 mg (less than this is not effective for me for sleep) combined with a cocktail of other drugs for bipolar disorder.  Taking this drug_ but after a year the hangover and oversleeping had to stop. I gained a significant amount of weight (I exercise about 4 to 5 times a week in hopes to off-set the weight gain from increase from the icreased appetitie- not successful).

Have some excessive muscle movements_ and difficulty swallowing at night_ which my doctor tells me could be a pre-cursor to Tardive Dyskenesia.  I fear that_ but am not ready to experiment with any of the newer classes of drugs for this disorder. I have Hyper-lipidemia have decided to take Niaspan (RX Niacin)in liew of statins. Not presently diagnosed with Diabetes_ thankfully.,I am a 62 year old female who has suffered with the symptoms of Bipolar Disorder for 40 years.  I have a very strong family history of this disorder.  The initial manifestation was about 4 months after the birth of my first child.  It was in 1970 and was treated as Post Partum Depression.  After moving about the country for the first 8 years of the onset of this disorder_ I was formally diagnosed as having Bipolar Disorder.  I was originally treated with major tranqualizors and was started on lithium in combo with antipsychotics and deseryl.  In 2005 I moved to another state and my new doctor and I experimented with most of the usual antipsychotic drugs_ all with disheartening side effects.  About two years ago I was put on Seroquel and have taken as much as 600 mg in combo with smaller doses of lithium.  I have recently decreased the dose of Seroquel to 450 mg and 300 mg of lithium.  This combination seems to be working well for me and I am grateful for living in a time when these meds are so helpful. Hopefully_ one day there will be a cure.,F,62,2  years,10/23/2009,Seroquel

Diet change and exercise have not helped.,After several years of uncontrollable anxiety and borderline dissociative episodes ( I felt like I was being possessed by a child-like part of myself_ completely debilitating anxiety)_ and trying several different meds_ having to detox off of addiction to benzos_ which didnt completely cure me. then I was offered Seroquel_ and I have felt better than I ever have in entire life. Have suffered low grade and sometimes more severe depression since a teen. This problem is genetic_ at least 4 generations now. Unfortunately_ it appears that the side effects are seriously dangerous to my health_ with the possiblity of diabetes. I hope that I can find some alternative that works as well. I still recommend this medicine to anyone suffering severe uncontrollable anxiety and depression. It works different than other anti-depressants.

I do not know why I did it... I dont remember doing it at all... I only remember having a feeling of ""waking up"" and wondering where my children were and wondering where all the blood came from and why everyone was cut up???

Everything I read_ not published by the maker or someone associated with the maker_ seemed to be negative. There are certainly some concerning side effects_ but I was bound and determined to try to make it through the adjustment period of this medicine. I have had lots of bad experiences with SSRI type AD's and expected the worst with Seroquel. In fact_ I started not to take the first dose because of all the negative publicity and feedback. I kept wanting to stop during the first 5 days_ but didn't. I am really glad I didn't. I made it to the target dose of 300 mg per day and am almost side effect free.

This stuff is actually working and I am only a week in. Because optimal results are not seen until 2-6 weeks out_ I am excited about what's to come. I may actually start to feel better. Bottom line_ try this medicine if your pdoc thinks it might work for you. Don't be scared by the hype. Be cautious_ but remember that these are new generation drugs that have less side effects than the older ones did.

478, 1, Bipolar I,Extreme hunger_ spent LOTS of time sleeping.   I've had type 1 diabetes for over 26 years_ Seroquel caused me severe insulin resistance so I had to take very_ very large amounts of insulin.,When I took Seroquel I'd have a period of good calm and then I'd become extremely angry.  I'd get a dose increase and the same process would occur again.  I ended up taking 800mg in the morning and 800mg at night.  My diabetes was so screwed up.  I ate cookies_ candy_ ice cream_ cake_ doughnuts_ and just about every high fat high sugar food out there in HUGE amounts.  I was compelled to eat huge meals/snacks and then eat again an hour later.  I ended up at 256lbs then enough was enough.  I now weigh 145lbs after quitting Seroquel.  Seroquel is a tremendously horrible drug.  Please be careful - the great sleep is deceptively delicious_ but the other effects are horrible.,M,38,8  years,8/2/2009,Seroquel

I had horrible_ severe dreams & nightmares.  The dreams felt very real & often put me in a state-of-mind when I awoke that nothing was real.  I also during my 8 months_ experienced ""visual disturbances"".  I lost 30lbs at the most & had no appetite.  Being petite_ I looked sickly skinny.  On the brighter side_ I did feel that I was a ""better"" person on medication as my mood swings have ruined friendships & relationships.  Currently_ I am not on any medication but will be seeking the advise of a therapist soon.  I just don't want to feel like a robot or zombie anymore.  It wasn't very pleasant.  Another side-effect that I did not see posted_ for those of you who paint_ write_ draw or are otherwise considered creative_ while on medication...I could NOT for the life of me write_ draw or paint.

I dont think the FDA gave this antipsychotic much thought when trying to gain its approval_ they just pushed it along like most drugs.  The drugs Zyprexa and Seroquel are notorius for weight gain_ more for Zyprexa.  This drugs where approved in the late 90's when the U.S. economy was very healthy_ and the drug companies needed another drug to uphold there revenues.  So the FDA would just push these drugs through the approval decision like there nothing.  SEROQUEL AND ZYPREXA ARE NICKNAMED THE FATBOY DRUGS BY THE PATIENCE WHO ARE PRESCRIBED THEM.  The doctors around the world deny that these drugs give you side effects such as weight gain or akathisia.,There are three new antipsychotics currently under review by the FDA.  The drugs are Invega Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate)long acting injection.  New approved Fanapt (iloperidone).  Saphris (asenapine).

When I was on these pills_ I was EXTREMELY violent_ for absolutely no reason at all. One time_ I had a bad day at school_ and I kicked down the front door out of rage. When my father got mad at me for it_ I shoved him. Little did I know that was only the beginning of it for me. My mother and I got into an argument that lasted several days_ and then I eventually snapped in a rage and assaulted her. I know I was a horribly violent_ pathetic_ psychopathic individual. I also know that the pills did this to me. But then_ a couple of weeks later_ something happened that REALLY made me see how horrible these drugs are. I got into a fight with Dad about something stupid_ and before I knew it_ I pushed him down the stairs_ and I fell with him_ and then I stomped on him_ and then somewhere along the line_ I realized that these pills were doing this to me. I realized that I needed to get off these horrible drugs before I REALLY ended up killing somebody and/or going to prison for the rest of my life. All of this happened over the span of a little over two months_ from March 2004 to May 2004. Today_ I look back and can't believe I ever trusted any of my former psychiatrists.

Seroquel  added to my Sertraline and Klonopin made a big difference.  Noticed immediate stabilization that I had never experience before.  The ability to relax for the first time in a long time.  The problem with these drugs is that they do work but they take away your personality and motivation.  I still fight this at times and stop or reduce meds.  Probably not the right thing to do but I think it is like drowning.  No emotions_ inability to experience psychical or emotional love.  Just composing this paragraph is taking forever and I need to keep reading back.  My guess is the P docs prescribe Seroquel because in makes their patients compliant.  I used to fight taking antidepressants constantly and they would not seem to last or be effective.  With Seroquel I have taken the same AD for almost two years.

I cannot sleep without taking this drug.  I have not had natural sleep in over 15 months now. Even when I am taking the drug_ I no longer feel drowsy and it is taking longer for me to get to sleep.  Worst of all_ I have been slowly been inching up the dosage past 150mg again just to get even minimal sleep. I do not want to go above 150mg again because of the zombie-like affect it has on me (which is bad enough below 150mg)I only average about five hours sleep even with taking the drug.  It has been almost three months since I have had a night of 7 hours of sleep or more. My worst fear is that the longer I take this expensive drug_ the harder it will be to ever get natural sleep again. Cleary_ taking this drug is clearly not sustainable.Anyone with advice on an inexpensive_ relatively safe drug that helped them get off Seroquel? ",M,44,11  months,5/4/2009Email,Seroquel

525, 1, Bi Polar 2,I took this medication on a Friday night and proceeded to sleep for 12.5 hours solid.  I woke up for 2 hours_ and ate everything in sight.  I then was so exhausted and dopey that I took a 5 hour nap.  I woke up_ feeling like my limbs were encased in concrete.  I couldn't walk straight or talk clearly.,I only took this medication one night at 50mg.  I will never take it again.,F,21,1  days,5/3/2009,Seroquel
526, 1, for sleeping,i just took it for one night.... I was in the hospital for diabetes and a blood infection and had not slept good for months... they gave me 100 mgs around 9:00 pm and then another 50 mgs around two ol clock in the morning,when i given the 100 mgs i went to sleep and slept for about four and a half hours then they gave me 50 more mgs and i felt extrememly wierd!!! I felt like i caould do any thing i wanted and i would have no consquences. i felt like a super hero or something. I had a pic line in my arm and still had a blood infection but i decide that i was going home at about two thirty that morning. So_ i stole my moms keys out of her purse un-hooked my iv and left the hospital... Just to make the story shorter i just tell youu what the outcome was i ended up having a head on collision and totaled the car. I had to be cut out of the car and when i woke up i couldn'tmove. I was rushed to Baptist hospital and the feeling came back into my body. I was then put back into the hospital and i was never given that medication again.,F,21,1  days,4/30/2009Email,Seroquel

Also taking Ativan when needed for anxiety attacks.,I have been on Seroquel for 3 weeks_ this medicine has been a life saver for me! I started out on just 25 mg a night before bed_ then moved up to 50 mg's. I have actually LOST weight_ 5 lbs so far (I put on 15 when my depressive episode returned). For so long I thought Dr's just didnt understand what I was going through_ they continued to try me on different anti depressants_ all of which made me more anxious and freaked out_ to the point I wanted to hurt myself and others! Finally with my Therapist and new Dr_ came to my Bipolar diagnosis. Seroquel has helped me want to be productive and actually LEAVE my house again_ it has mellowed out my severe mood swings_ its helped with my anxiety attacks_ but we are still working on that. Im not saying its for everyone_ but for a person like me who kept getting the typical depression diagnosis over and over again_ I cant say enough good things!!!,F,33,3  weeks,4/28/2009,Seroquel

537, 4, to control bi-polar upswing,Normally I take 50mg_ but when the daylight increases_ I go through a tremendous high. In March '09_ I increased it 25mg at a time 'til I got to 175mg! I am down to 150_ but recognize that I am still in a danger zone so haven't reduced it any further yet. I can't take more than 50mg at a time because I get leg tremors when in bed. I've been stretching out taking the doses starting in the early evening. I am wondering if I took them throughout the day (morning noon and night)_ if would help curb the eating binges I seem to go through at night. I am not sure if my inability to focus is because of the Seroquel or because of the mania of the upswing. I suspect the latter.,"At night_ I take Seroquel_ 300mg gabapentin (Neuronton_ for mood stabilizer) and for depression_ 75mg Effexor XR (because of its cost_ sometimes venaflexine_ the generic_ a pill that has to be split and taken a.m. and p.m. because of the ""half life""). In the morning_ I take 300mg lamotrogine (FINALLY the generic of Lamictal is available_ MUCH less expensive) for mood stabilization. I know how bad my bi-polar upswing can get (I was hospitalized_ involuntarily_ for more than 2 wks in 3/03)_ so I realize that I MUST take the Seroquel when weathering one of these episodes.

At that time it saved my life. It only worked for about 5 weeks then just pooped out_ but my psychiatrist wanted me to stay on it. Living on Seroquel is tough. You sleep all day_ are drowsy and useless the next day_ gain a lot of weight (40 pounds in 4 months for me_ despite diet & exercise). I had terrible nasal congestion at night & not being able to breathe sent me into panic attacks. I eventually got tardive dyskinesia from it (manifesting in involuntary tongue movements_ lip smacking & head twitches). Withdrawal is hell. Anxiety_ agitation_ hallucinations_ headache_ vomiting.

(both eyes had to be operated on) (drug company recognizes this major side effect for humans but won't publicly confirm it)Interferes with memory and cognitive processes. Drowsiness. Caused aching in legs. Headaches (mild to moderate but occur daily; however_ may be aggravated by Lamictal which I take and can cause headaches.,I take the medicine reluctantly because it has helped stabilize my bipolar condition. I feel strongly that it causes problems with clear thinking_ coming up with ideas (no problem before) and memory loss. Major problem with cataracts needs to be publicizing. Manufacturer's PDR entry mentions (actually highlights) that dogs had gotten cataracts with this medicine. Former doctor said she believes it causes cataracts_ but my cataracts were the price I had to pay for seroquel's positive effect on bipolar. I also take Lamictal (200 mg. a day); wellbutrin 300 mg.; Clonazepam (5 mg. a day),M,59,5  years,2/27/2009,Seroquel

My pdoc took me off of lithobid and trileptal_ and put me on lamictal. After about 10 months she increased my lamictal_ added lexapro_ and upped the seroquel to 200 mg at night. I started having these side effects_ and she thought it was the lamictal. Told me to go off and she'd see me in a month! I don't think so! I didn't stop the lamictal_ but ran into a snafu with insurance over seroquel. It's the best thing that could have happened. Within a week the cravings stopped and I could see a difference in my scalp! Not getting up in the night for drinks anymore_ either. I just figured all this out today.

I was not satisfied with this drug.  If taken in the proper dosage_ preferably smaller doses_ in can be helpful but I don't think it is wise to take it for prolonged periods of time.  I gained a significant amount of weight.  For the first few months I took it it was very helpful.  It helped with my mood and rumination in conjunction with prozac.  I have found that it is overprescribed and that it should only be taken if absolutely necessary to avoid these side effects.

The leg twitches are very irritating and I have found that alcohol causes this effect with me. I no longer drink. If you are having these type of side effects or other kind_ talk to your doc because I think it is a good drug but docs can easily over medicate you.

It has almost completely gotten rid of my mood swings and I feel like one person at peace instead of two halves at war.  Now that I can sleep through the night_ I can actually get things done during the day_ my attention span has increased and I no longer experience regular intervals restlessness or panic.  It took a while to figure out the correct dose; I started with 12.5mg then 25 then 50 then 100 then 150 back to 100 then 75 and finally back to 50.  This was a mix of my doctor giving me a starter pack and me using a pill cutter to alter the dosage.  I would try the dose for 2 weeks and then alter it as I saw fit so it took a few months to perfect the amount.  It doesn't take much of this stuff to do the trick; its seriously potent.

596, 1, as an adjunct for major depression,Since I was also taking other meds it is difficult to determine the effects from seroquel alone. I think this drug is over prescribed in treating depression and insomnia.,When I first starting taking seroquel it was at 50mg_ it was sedating and while it may have helped with depression it made me feel mentally fuzzy. The drug was titrated up to 150mg from 50 to 100_ 125 then 150. At 150mg it seemed to cause some insomnia but it is difficult to know for sure. I have been titrating down 25 mg every 4-5 days and have not experienced any withdrawal symptoms. I have only been taking the drug for about 1.5 months. I don't like this drug because of the potential side effects shakiness (which I do experience)_ diabetes_ tardive dyskinesia_ and others.I also experienced a few nights where I would awaken with cold sweats. If you are stopping the drug and have been taking it for a long time make sure you discuss a tapering plan with your doctor.

It gives me the munchies after 1-2 hours of taking it so I have gained some weight_ however it is something that can be controlled with exercise and a diet free from junk food; the same applies to the constipation.  I think the 'munchies' are worse with higher doses so it is important for the doctor to give the lowest effective dose.  I am taking 75mg before bedtime and I am happy.

615, 1, Insomnia-PTSD,First month was fine. No severe side effects_ however did not really help my sleep or constant awakening. By month 3_ this drug combined with Lexapro put me in drug induced diabetes and I had gained 40 lbs!,For some this works great. Mentally wise_ I have no complaints. But be wary if you have weight problems (easily gain weight_ overweight or are on other drugs that slow your metabolism). It is only one month I have been OFF seroquel and even though I have been following a medically prescribed diet to the letter my blood sugar is still very high. Have your labwork done monthly! The weight gain and diabetes was not worth it to me.,F,44,4  months,12/20/2008,Seroquel
616, 3, sleep,hangover (at first); dehydrating; need to increase dose over time,I began taking 25mg with 10mg of ambien (ambien made me hyper_ binge_ etc. and seroquel calmed the side effects of ambien) with hopes of quitting ambien. Initially knocked me out like a charm when taken 1 hour before bedtime_ but now that i am quitting ambien (after 10 years) it doesnt seem to work as dramatically without it. Gave me a horrible hangover in the beginning that lasted all day_ but seems better now (just hung over for 10 minutes). I eat less on seroquel alone than i did on ambien and seroquel combined. 50 mg will still knock me out but the hang over sucks and I dont want to get fat.,F,31,1  years,12/18/2008,Seroquel
617, 2, sleep/manic depression,I felt like a zombie. I was extremely tired all day_ had a terrible time waking up in the morning. Hypomania made me say and do embarrassing things... like leaping onto chairs and beds in the hospital dancing and giggling like an idiot. I said embarrassing things I had to apologize for later.,I'd fall asleep right away when I was on it_ which was nice. It takes me forever to fall asleep_ usually. However the sleep wasn't restful_ even though I'd sleep all night. Started taking it in the psych hospital_ so I only spent five (miserable) days on it.,F,14,5  days,12/5/2008Email,Seroquel
618, 4, Depression_ anxiety_ rumination,Only been on it for five days; started taking it in detox (alcohol). A week ago I felt like killing myself; now I'm a bit manic but basically in a good mood. I find it very speedy and can't take it at bedtime without sacrificing a night's sleep. May need to take a sleeping pill tonight. Don't know if it's a coincidence but my sex drive is off the charts. Don't know if I want it to be a coincidence either. I'm 45 and 17 was never as bad as this. Oh the other thing: I've gone from a pack-a-week smoking habit to a half pack a day. It makes cigarettes very satisfying. Makes my head a bit big and zoomy. I'm on 100mg a day--no way would I want a higher dose. OCD/Tourettic muttering rituals are down like the stock market. I like that.,I'm cautiously optimistic.,M,45,5  days,12/3/2008,Seroquel
619, 4, bi-polar 2_ insomnia,extremely sedating (the reason I use it)_ hangover with significant irritability attached_ carb cravings,I have used seroquel very infrequently over the last 6 years until recently.  I normally would only use it when I would start ramping up manic-wise which always results from sleep deprivation (more than 2 nights consecutively getting less than 2-4 hours each night) and would only require 25-50 mg to knock me out for a solid 8+ hours.  I didn't like the side-effects so I'd rarely take it more than one night.  Recently I've been battling depression insomnia_ so I started taking very small amounts (10-15 mg) which seems to help me get a solid 5-8 hours so I'm keeping that up.  I was previously taking temazepam but was concerned about addiction/rebound.  Does anyone have any comments? (please email) ... specifically - a poster on here said that smaller amounts are known to cause greater sedative effects so to get less sedation but better positive effect take larger doses???  Sounds backwards to me and I could find no credible source information to support that statement.,M,43,6  years,12/1/2008Email,Seroquel
620, 5, Bipolar,Excessive sleeping. Nasal congestion 90 mins after taking it. Some carbohydrate cravings but they are manageable compared to some other meds.,The ONLY thing that has worked for my bipolar. Within 2 days (and at only 100mg heading up to 400mg) I was taken out of a horrible mixed state. I feel like my old self_ although admittedly a bit sleepier & dopier. The tradeoff is so worth it. I didn't feel safe before. I'm hoping that the side effects will go away with time as most people find.,F,37,2  weeks,11/25/2008,Seroquel
621, 4, bi-polar,I sleep much better but I don't like some of the side effects the worst of which is the weight gain. I also experience dry mouth and my sinus's get blocked up_ usually about an hr. after taking the medication. My mood has been much better since taking this medication.,I am on a fairly high dose (600 mg.at bedtime) and I have recently had my dose reduced which has helped with the stuffy nose and dry mouth. Over all I believe the benefits outweigh the side effects.,M,51,4  years,11/23/2008,Seroquel
622, 4, bipolar_ insomonia,bottomless pit for stomach_ craving of carbs and sweets_ eating in sleep_ waking up and finding food wrappers and food particles in mouth_ 20 lb. wgt gain in 3 weeks of taking meds. sedation upon taking pm med.,I take 200 mg of at night and 50 mg in the morning. I do get restful sleep at night and am able to maintain alertness during the day. My dreams are vivid but sometimes so vivid that I wake up from them shouting_ screaming_ yelping or yelling. I don't feel groggy when I wake up in the morning and I am glad to be on the med cuz this is the first time in years that I have felt like I had some good_ restful sleep. I do not like the weight gain.,F,37,3  weeks,11/23/2008,Seroquel
623, 4, Bipolar 1 Disorder,tiredness at first _ vivid dreams,Seroquel has been recently added on to my medication cocktail for bipolar disorder after suffering from another manic episode. I started at 50mg for the first six days. At 50mg I was very tired during the day as well as at night when I took the pill_ however after going up to 100mg and taking it a little bit earlier I have been able to get a good nights sleep and not be excessively tired through out the day. However_ I am also on other medications (invega_ trileptal and xanax) so the effects could be different as they usually are with others. Sure the side effects on the box can be scary_ and there are horror stories_ but quite honestly sometimes they are better than the current affliction that may be bothering you. So I have to say so far so good with seroquel.,F,23,2  weeks,11/22/2008Email,Seroquel

It had to be done because i simply could not function on the higher doses.  Would sleep for 10-12 hrs and still have a really hard time getting out of bed and leaving my house.

630, 4, Bi-polar II,Restless legs and the first night I had a panic attack_ but I think it was from reading too many bad side effect reviews.  I psyched myself right into a fright-fest.,This forum has so many horror stories and this drug has been great for me. This has truly helped me balance out my emotions and my life.  I do have some grogginess_ but after about 3 weeks_ it lessened. I sleep great now and before seroquel_ I didn't sleep_ which was leading me into a world of mania (it was still happy mania_ but that's a slippery slope).  This may not be for everybody_ but for some of us_ it is great. I am only on 100 mg_ which is low.

632, 5, schizophrenia + mood disorder,"On the very low dosages_ I experienced extreme groggines throughout the day_ which was just terrible (my grades suffered a lot_ and being literally too tired to do anything forced a total change of lifestyle). It made a highly effective sleep aid at night_ and required a LOT of sleep.  On higher doses and the dose I am now (which is less than the ""average"" dose)_ there are no significant effects I can think of. Nothing negative at least. The weirdest minor effect I experience: crying really easy at anything remotely sappy (i.e. commercials_ certain episodes of Oprah_ corny human interest news story...). And no weight gain either!",For me_ Seroquel has been an amazing drug.  I still experience some anxiety_ and I can get really down sometimes_ but relative to how I used to be (which was REALLY messed up- just take my word for it) there is no way I would be alive today if it weren't for this drug. And more than just being alive_ I truly FEEL alive_ and that I am LIVING for the first time in so very long.  Taking this drug_ in combination with a more positive outlook toward life_ has led me to a place I always hoped_ but never thought I could be.

I've been given a second shot at life - I hate to think of it just passing by without me having the ability to appreciate it. Docs say the Seroquel has less severe side effects than other meds they could give me - it's all a balancing act: the horrors of PTSD or the side effects of the meds. I'll definitely take the sides!",M,25,3  months,11/8/2008,Seroquel

I have suffered for 26 years with debilitating anxiety_ poor self-esteem_ and agoraphobia. Seroquel gave me the life I have always dreamed of. I no longer smoke_ or stress endlessly. I was able to leave a distructive relationship in part because Seroquel has worked to make me calmer and more rational. Of course every drug works differently for the person taking it_ but please don't be scared off because of the weight gain side-effect. I have only gained 10 pounds in the year and a half I've been on this drug. I think that can be attributed to the fact that I no longer smoke. Thank God for Seroquel!,F,26,1  years,11/7/2008,Seroquel

I think it has potential to help as I was on it before with 600mg lithium and low low dose lamictal.  I've read others on here and it really is important to take this med and go right to bed.  I timed it and it starts to work for me in like 20 minutes so I have to be in bed or I'll start eating non-stop.  Interestly I have very little appetite during the day.  (maybe all the food I ate the day before!)  See what happens this time as I'm on 900mg lithium now and starting lamictal currently at 25mg.  On 150mg Seroquel currenly.

I do not eat after taking this med_ and it works well for a good sleep. I usually eat very healthy_ low fat foods. I recently turned the 5 mg time release Melatonin back on with the 50 mg Seroquel. Good sleep_ but groggy in the morning for about 15 minutes. I intend to cut the Seroquel back to 25 mg and see how that works.

Now it is very difficult to get off--I'm down to 75 mg from 300_ but getting lower is proving to be pretty tough_ because I'm pretty sleep dependent on it.

It did bring me down from horrible mixed mania so that my problems were more within a tolerable level_ did NOT make them go away_ though. My pdoc actually wants me to get off of it and just stay on Lamictal and Focalin. The main problem_ I think_ is that Seroquel and Focalin sometimes play nice_ and sometimes FIGHT with each other. They really do opposite things_ one being a dopamine agonist and one an antagonist. Apparently Seroquel isn't *always* a dopamine antagonist_ so I think the difficult times are when it's doing that more for whatever reason. Overall_ not bad_ but I've been on it long enough and I'm getting off with my pdoc's blessing.,F,39,7  months,9/30/2008Email,Seroquel

Not sure if I have given this med enough time its not been a week. I do have very pleasant dreams at night when I do get to sleep but am awaken from 1am til I get up every hour on the hour with muscle aches from my knee's down to my feet. Unsure why this is a side-effect. I too am drinking approx. 80-110 oz's of water daily and my keeping my caloric intake at approx. 1_200 calories. I am loosing weight_ but just could be water retention being depleted. I feel like im ""High"" and also feel like im floating on a cloud but want to sleep. Will try this medicine for another week to see if side effects subside. Sex drive the same. Not effected. I am also taking Klonipin .5mgs in the am and at night.

I am on 100 mg; and within 15-20 minutes of taking this drug_ I literally pass out.  I'm not just saying it makes me groggy/sleepy.  I mean_ pass out and loose the ability to do anything_ and I am not able to be woken from this coma like sleep for hours.  That scares me.  Also_ this medication leaves me extremely 'spaced out' the following day.  So while it does provide me sleep... its the kind of sleep that wouldn't alow me to be woken_ even if my house is on fire.,F,27,4  days,9/17/2008,Seroquel

Main concern is the knocked out feeling at night...I'm afraid I'll sleep through a tornado!  No weight gain...possible weight loss?  I'm not sure since I also quit drinking large amounts of alcohol.  Dry mouth right after I take it and restless legs occasionally.,Seroquel has definitely helped with racing thoughts_ irritability and anger.  I'm on Cipralex for depression_ but I believe the Seroquel is giving a boost in this area as well.  If I miss a dose_ I can feel the negative emotions quite quickly.  I am able to organize my thoughts and doings much better than before the meds.  I must add that I was on 25 mg and slowly progressed to 400 mg.  I still didn't feel that it wasn't quite right yet_ so now I'm up to 500 mg.  Along with 200 mg of Cipralex_ I'm coping much better.,F,42,10  months,9/15/2008,Seroquel

Helped me sleep and wake up rested and calm.  No panic attacks at all!!!  But_ due to side effects and possibly worse ones coming on_ I do not wish to take this regularly any more.

Went back down to 300mg...everything fine with the side effects....and have started to once again increase dose.

Helped me sleep through the night_ but if I didn't get a full 8-10 hours of sleep I could not function during the day. Even when I did sleep my 10 hours at night_ I was groggy and out of it during the day_ then get hyper at night. Had no motivation to do anything_ When I woke up in the morning I was starving for Junk Food_ but that wore off and I lost my desire for food. Lost a couple pounds not even trying_ (& I'm already pretty small). Sometimes made me so passive_ I would hardly react to anything. The WORST part was the intense amount of RAGE this medicine gave me_ I got angry and aggressive_ and pissed off very easily_ it was very scary to experience.

I felt strangely all morning after taking it once--I had a hard time talking_ I was dizzy_ tremors_ disoriented.  Went to breakfast w/friend_ and tried to sleep upon return.  Had FRIGHTENING anxiety_ felt like I was going back into mixed state that I had earlier in the summer.  (Depression hasn't lifted_ hence the ECT.)

In addition_ w/ 50-100mg at night it is the first drug I have ever taken for sleep that didn't stop working after two weeks.  I feel like I have much more control in my life.  My only complaint is that it doesn't work completely consistently_ but I gather that that is because I am more stressed some nights than others.

However the one time I went off of it was HORRIBLE! I was vividly hallucinating. I had experienced hallucinations before but I could always tell that they were just that_ these withdrawal hallucinations were too real...and frightening too.I've also noticed that if I don't get enough sleep I get extreme heaviness in my leg the following day.

The only bothersome side effect has been dry mouth_ and that is taken care of by drinking lots of water. Seroquel helps me get to sleep at night_ but in a very subtle way as I seem to very gently fall asleep. Unlike other users_ I have actually lost quite a bit of weight. My prescription is for 25-400 mg depending on how badly I need sleep. I took 400 mg once and felt stoned out of my mind and incredibly dizzy the next day. Personally_ I have found this medication to be a life-saver in a small dose as it allows me to sleep a full night and feel rested the next day.

Once asleep nothing can wake me up- I once woke up to find my water glass shattered on the hardwood floor around my bed and had no recollection of it breaking. The cravings start about 1 hour after taking it (100mg) and I will eat ANYTHING and not even remember it the next day (I have to look for clues: crumbs in the sheets_ empty ice cream cartons in the trash_ candy wrappers strewn about my bed-side table). I've gained about 40 pounds in the past two years_ and am now on a strict diet.

I had never even heard of it but I'd estimate at least 50-60% of people in there were on a certain dose. I knew this from when it was med time at night. It helped for schizophrenia_ schizotypal_ hallucinations_ wasn't that great for the biplor patients but helped for the manic states_ insomniacs (who were often depressed and tended to amplify depression but they were often put on other meds to combat it)_ extremely high BP that beta blockers alone couldn't lower_ stopping seizures from withdrawal and psychosis. Most people gained weight while on it. Most people were in a perpetual sedated state. But the bad ones were the ones above 600-1200mg ed. In the ward is great for many reasons.

My psych told me recently that I seemed the most normal and ""well"" he's ever seen me - after a 100 mg. increase.  This drug at this dose has calmed my nerves and helped me focus.  I'm also much less irritable and angry.  I have tried a number of other mood-stabilizers in combination with Wellbutrin_ and this is the only combination that has worked without major_ horrible side-effects.  My only issue is that I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I have read others' testimonies and I am concerned that the side-effects I experience now (esp. the weight gain and ravenous cravings) are only going to get worse (my dose went up a lot recently).

It has caused me to have GERD (gastro-esophogeal reflux disease) where I've had to have two operations where they've put a camera and a scope down my throat.  Acid reflux was causing erosions in my esophagus (all because of the weight gain due to the Seroquel).  And then I developed severe sleep apnea_ once again due to the horrific weight gain due to the Seroquel.  I had two polysomnographies and I would stop breathing 1_000 times a night.  I now have to breathe with a CPAP machine forcing air down my airway at night so that I don't stop breathing or have a heart attack.  I can barely move now-- getting up and down from bed or a chair and even walking a few steps is very difficult.  I can't clip my own toenails or shave my legs or put on my shoes because of the terrible weight gain due to the Seroquel.

The weight gain is a problem_ but drink a lot of water and excercise regularly and you can at least stop the weight gain.  The XR does not give you as large of a rush when you first take it at night_ works throughout the day to help with your disorders_ and I recommend it over taking multiple doses throughout the day to avoid the up and down feeling.  I definitely feel the benfits heavily outweigh the side effects once you are accustomed to how the medication affects you.  Everyone around me has noticed how my behavior has greatly improved and I feel human,M,33,3  months,1/28/2008Email,Seroquel

I for sure do not want more weight gain and these awful side effects. But can anyone tell me what has worked better for insomnia due to anxiety? I took 100 mg of the Seroquel the first night - was way too hung over next day_ then 35-50 mg the next 3 nights - 1 of those nights did not sleep well at all. Last night was better but today am quite groggy. I also take Lamotrigne 200 mg and Lithium 900 mg/day.

I then gradually went up to 195 and I can not lose it no matter what I try.  My Psychiatrist reduced my dose from 800mg to 600 mg at bedtime.  I do crave sweet foods late at night.,I hate the weight gain but it helps me sleep when I don't take it I just don't sleep at all and become paranoid and suffer horrible child sexual abuse flashbacks.

Awesome sleep continued after the sleepiness stopped.,"Antidepressants or benzos work by ""compensating"" (for depression or anxiety or mania). Seroquel works by ""normalizing.""  So at a low dose it works for insomnia and at a high dose_ it works for schizophrenia.  For me_ Seroquel really helped stop suicidal thinking.  Since it's great for PTSD_ it got me to finally acknowledge and deal with having been an abused child.  I never realized how much supressed memories were messing me up every day.  I have to credit Seroquel(100mg 2x/day) for giving me the strength to deal with this -- something that years of SSRIs couldn't do.  After being on Seroquel for 6 months_ I downgraded to benzos for a year and then to nothing.  Hopefully I'll continue to stay well.  The two biggest problems with Seroquel (my opinion) are:  1) It ""turns off"" your ability to feel hungry or full_ which means that you overeat -- and gain 30 pounds in the process.

792, 1, Bipolar Disorder/Paranoia,This is one of many addictive drugs that are in circulation today with which the effects are completely counterproductive to the problem that you would be attempting to solve by prescribing them.  NEVER let anyone tell you that being bipolar is a disorder because it is a GIFT.  Mediocre minds work on a scale of good and bad_ great minds work on a scale of great and horrible.  However difficult this may be for some of you to understand I promise that for every time you feel negative there will be an equal and opposing feeling of positivity if you would just be patient.  The purpose of these drugs is not to help you_ more so to trap you.  In my opinion taking this medecine is just as_ if not more damaging to a persons mentality than getting heroin off some street corner_ it offers a short term escape route but in the long term it knocks you off track.,I assure you that through a careful recognition of the root of your problems_ exercise_ healthy diet_ vitamin B12_ and eliminating from your life people like your psychiatrist will provide for a much more suitable and tolerable approach to a solution.  Seroquel much like heroin will only make you even more miserable in the long term and thats if its side effects dont kill you first.  DO NOT USE THIS DRUG FOR BIPOLAR.,M,19,2  days,12/9/2007,Seroquel

My psychiatrist and I have a 20 year relationship and so he gave me quiet of bit of latitude as to how much I increase the dose. Whether to increase by 75 mg or 200 mg. I chose 200 mg increase to 250 mg. Within the first day I was feeling better. By one week I felt like a new man.Obviously this is the best treatment for me.

856, 5, Bi-Polar Disorder,I am currently taking seroquel 1000mg_ trazodone 50mg_ zoloft 400mg_ and xanax or ativan(?) when I need it for panic attacks.  I followed my doc's advice and split the dosage between morning and bedtime.  I COULD NOT take this approach because I was a walking zombie; and actually this regimen made me even more irritable_ agitated_ frustrated because all I wanted to do was sleep.  The drugs began to severely limit my activities.  I have always been an extremely physically active person.  I then took it upon myself to try and take everything at once at bedtime_ thinking things could not get any worse. I cannot begin to tell you how it changed my life.  After a few days of doing this_ my thought process COMPLETELY changed.  I went directly to sleep_(no dreaming).  I was GLAD to be alive_ and I found myself not taking myself and others so seriously.  I am experiencing a slight difficulty in waking up in the morning; however_ I drink one Red Bull when I get up and then it only takes about 3,"I am 42 years old_ and I have been diagnosed with BP since 1991_ at age 27_ I have been on life support twice in my adult life after attempting suicide.  This disease cost me 3 marriages_ countless relationships_ financially broken twice_ going from job to job_ embarassing myself because I could not control my emotions_ and more importantly how my negative words and actions affected other people's lives_ an out of control sex life_ allowing my personal hygiene to lapse for days_ obsessing about revenge_ and the list goes on and on.  I am not completely cured_ nor will I ever be.  My new problem was that I thought all I had to do was take a few pills and I would be ""normal"". Since taking my meds on the schedule above_ I can honestly say that I am responsible in controlling my situation: Thinking about saying things versus voicing whatever comes to my mind; putting others first before me_ having my mind not racing so much that I can make intelligent decisions in my life_ rather",M,42,3  years,7/14/2007Email,Seroquel

872, 1, bipolar - mania,The first year on Seroquel I was a total zombie.  When I visited family for a holiday dinner I was terrified.  How can I possibly stay awake for 4 or 5 hours during the dinner?  My energy level went to zero and I felt exhausted after less than an hour out of bed.  I went from a muscular (benching 275) 195 pounds to a flabby 245 the first year and let my gym membership lapse.  After 5 years the side effects started getting much worse.  No erections and crappy orgasms led to a complete loss of interest in sex.  I just couldn't stop eating_ and would wake up starving in the middle of the night and devoured an entire box of cereal.  Of course I was too doped up to go to a restaurant or store_ and the cereal for the next morning was the only carb fix around.  If chips_ cookies or Ice cream were around I cant't imagine how much I would have eaten.  2 weeks after quitting seroquel my glucose was 98_ and along with the other symptoms_ it appears that I was getting diabetic.

By engaging in demanding activities in an attempt to feel better and control weight_ I was driven into mania but the Seroquel hid the mania.I ended up being hospitalized with a mixed episode after 4 months of mania in 2004.  The Seroquel dosage was increased _ and I gained 10 pounds in 2 weeks in the hospital.  2 months later_ unable to lose the 10 pounds_ I became extremely depressed and spent a month planning suicide.  The same pattern repeated in 2005 (the cognitive decline side effects of Seroquel prevented me from seeing what happened in 2004) and culminated in a mixed episode where I had a tremendous urge to kill people.  Another increase in Seroquel really zonked me out for a few months.  The side effects began to worsen rapidly in late 2006 and by early 2007 a horrible event made the decision clear - one of three changes was to discontinue Seroquel immediately - I forget the other 2.

874, 4, Depression/Anxiety/Bipolar/PTSD,When I first sought psychiatric care in 2002 I was a wreck. I will tell you that a Psychiatrist has to be advised of all goings on while taking the meds prescribed. I had my doses adjusted and the type of meds changed all based upon the results I experienced. Understand that sometimes I felt terrible only to have the meds stabilize after taking them for a while. Sometimes they stopped providing the desired results my Psychiatrist wanted. I am more stable now and remain so after all the adjustments. I take 100mg of Seroquel for sleep and to help organize my thoughts. It works for me. I agree that Seroquel gives me cravings but this is after about 30 min to an hour so I go to bed within that time frame to keep from eating. I also take 2mg of Gabitril 4 times a day for anxiety_ mood swings and headaches. Twice a day I take 30mg of Cymbalta for depression and 200mg of Provigil twice a day for wakefulness. A .5mg Klonopin wafer 4 times a day helps to suppress my anxiety. I praise my Psychia,At the direction of my Psychiatrist I went off of the Seroquel and tried lower levels than 100mg. With no Seroquel I could not fall asleep and I would lay in bed with all kind of thoughts racing through my head. With less than 100mg those symptoms went away but I would wake up and go back to sleep through out the night. It seems that 100mg is the magic number for me.,M,58,5  years,6/24/2007Email,Seroquel

I imagine in the next day or two I will totally stop seroquel. Wish I never tried it. Never had the slightest weight problem before.,Heart pounding and skipping beats. Can see my heart beat in my chest. Jumpy legs and little interest in doing anything. I feel my energy level returning and my desire to do things. Was given it after ex husband abandoned us. I care for our 4 year old daughter with DS. I will try and report back if weight changes with not taking seroquel. I am not expecting major changes but gradual decreases as I hope my metabolism returns to normal. I eat very healthfully.,F,44,9  months,5/23/2007Email,Seroquel

903, 3, mood disorder/OCD,"I've been on seroquel for about a month.  I've already gained 7 pounds_ which is not a good thing.  I was up to 150 mg at night_ which helped me sleep all night_ but made me feel like a zombie all day.  I crave junk food constantly and eat all the time.  I have little energy.  I'm also on 20 mg. of Lexapro and 200 mg. of Lamictal and 200 mg of Wellbutrin. I'm lowering my dose gradually of seroquel so I can be done with this weight gain.  I think I'll go back to Trazadone to help me sleep and hopefully that'll work.  My main issue is that during times of stress (most of the time) I have a lot of ""noise"" in my head.  Music mostly.  Loud and annoying and I grind and tap my teeth along with it.  I'm doing this all while maintaining a ""normal"" life as a stay-home soccer Mom.  I can't make it stop and sometimes I beg myself to make it stop.  Weird_ I know.  What else might work for that besides Seroquel? I feel like a science experiment right now.

At 45 years of age_ with no history of seizures in me or my extended family_ after just a couple of weeks on this drug I began having grand mal seizures. I had a total of eight grand mal seizures before I made the connection between seroquel and my newly developed epilepsy. I woke up in the hospital with a catheter up my penis and realized that if I had gone into a seizure while waiting for the subway I could have fallen on the tracks and be quite dead. I was very lucky that didn't happen. I stopped taking seroquel and started epival (an anti-seizure medication) and have not had another seizure in a year and a half.,If you value your life DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.

It's important for me to exercise_ don't smoke_ take omega 3_ eat well etc. By doing this stuff_ it minimises the unwanted side effects of this drug i.e. too much drowsiness_ weight gain etc. At the same time i get the good effects like; lessen anxiety_ slower thought processes_ definite balanced mood etc. No drug is perfect_ but I believe if you throw enough at something_ the greater chance of overcoming it.,M,29,12  months,5/16/2007,Seroquel

It has helped tremendously_ stopping the episodes that i had been frequently experiencing at about four times a week. It has also helped me sleep through the entire night. However_ I noticed that about 20 minutes after I take it at night_ I get extremely hungry_ and usually eat more than I normally would. This always happens right before bedtime_ and while I'm eating_ I also noticed that my entire body slows down_ making it really hard to finish chewing or swallowing my food_ so I think to anyone out there taking this_ I would warn you that this could be a choking hazard_ and if you eat_ you should do so with someone nearby. Also_ during the day time_ I have greatly decreased concentration and speech coordination_ so I'm not as verbally quick as I am accustomed to. I don't know,F,20,8  months,5/16/2007,Seroquel
909, 3, panic disorder and anxiety,none so far,I dont expect to take that drug for long since it is only something I take to calm my anxiety until I start getting an effect from the antidepressant. I have to say I was prescribed 25 mg 2 times a day. 12_5 mg is enough to put me to sleep for 10 hours and if I try taking 12.5 mg during the day I can not stay awake without many coffees so I just dont understand how somebody could take 100mg of this stuff and not be in a coma! I am 125 pounds so I am not that small...

Not that I lost interest_ but I just couldn't cum.  That made me angry and sad.  Cure or cause...,I have just read that it can increase my risk of having an epileptic seizure_ which I also suffer (taking tegretol).  I like taking it at night_ after any passion has been fulfilled_ but now have to take more in the morning to stop me going off.  This is a real grief for good daytime loving_ and like I'm saying_ can easily offset any benefit.  I can still get excited_ no problems there_ just can't lose the load.  I get so close and then_ nothing.  Why don't these quacks want us to have sex?  Don't they understand that is enough to make you depressed and angry?  Sheesh.

I stated that the medicine conflicts with my schedule seeing as how I work full-time (starting at 5 am) and I attend school at night. I told her that I fall asleep at the wheel and I can't complete my tasks at work_ and forget about studying for school.

948, 5, Anxiety,After I took it I began to feel extremely tired and lifeless.  That feeling kicked in around 20-30 minutes of taking my pill.  I know that I wouldn't be able to stay awake if someone paid me serious money.  I don't suggest driving after taking it.  You will be sleep behind the wheel in no time.,I had issues with my mind racing all of the time_ and had a hard time going to sleep.  I had already been prescribed Xanax_ but for some reason it didn't stop the severe twilight zone feelings that I was having.  I remember thinking that I was losing it at times.  My doctor prscribed me 50mg of Seroquel_ which helped out tremendously.  I was able to sleep_ and found myself not being worked up about small things.  I also lost the being in the twilight zone feeling that I was experiencing.  I think that Seroquel was a life saver.  I am no longer taking it because I am pregnant_ but for some reason I am doing alright.  I think it is because I am happy and very focused on my baby.,F,32,1  months,4/6/2007,Seroquel
949, 4, schizoaffective_ bipolar type,EXTREME sedation. I've been an insomniac since I was 12_ so the fact that this helps me sleep VERY well would normally be a good thing. But it makes me sleep ALL DAY_ which has often made me decide not to take it for several days at a time (bad idea_ of course).,Because this is_ apparently_ the only AP I can physically tolerate_ I have little choice but to stay on it. I've found that dividing the doses throughout the day really helps. (I'm on 100_ so I take 25 in the morning and afternoon_ and the other 50 before bed.) That way_ I get enough sedation to help me sleep through the night (about 7-9 hours_ depending on how much I need)_ but I'm not bombarding my system with so much at one time that I sleep all day. Aside from the sleeping problem_ this has worked surprisingly well in controlling my symptoms. (After very bad experiences with other APs_ I was very skeptical that it would work.) When I manage to take it as prescribed_ it's like I never even HAD them.,F,28,1.5  years,4/5/2007Email,Seroquel

At first it seemed great. I took it at night and it just knocked me out cold each night ( even thou I had no sleep problems at the time) and it gave a weird high sensation about 45 minutes after taking it.In the morning thou I would have a very hard time getting up_ often staying in bed for hours ( sleeping 12 -15 hours a day) and if one want s to participate in the world by school or working this makes it extremely difficult.I also gained 40 lbs over the 6 years which is not good. I have liver problems and was given this anyway. M y blood sugar and pressure were not affected_ but my heart rate was high ( 80 per minute before seroquel under 75) I eat a vegan diet so that probably helped_ but my heart is working harder from the weight gain.I did not find that it helped with any of my low esteem problems_ ( that is for counsling) but just sedated me and put me to sleep thus avoiding life and becoming zombiefied.three months agi I deci,F,46,6  years,4/5/2007,Seroquel

(I did my research on AS for 2 months and tryed to tell him that I had it). He didn't listen to me. He prescribed 25mg of Seroquel to me last Feb. Last time_ he prescribed 100mg to me in 2005. I told my doctor that it raised trigliceride levels and HE is the one that wants to me lower those trigliceride levels to 150. (Mine was 188 in 2005). My doctor just doesn't get it. He thinks Seroquel is the answer to everyone's problem. It's not. I am not psychotic or how ever you spell that word. Aspergers Syndrome can appear to be Bi Polar.

No side effects. You don't need an anti-phychotic medication. Just take Zolfot + Klonopin. Oh and Seroquel will make you sleep for about 10 hours a night. When you work for a living_ most get 6-8 hours a sleep a night. Due to my work schedule in '05_ I couldn't take any Seroquel-not even a lick since I had to be at work at 5:45am.

I couldn't understand anything I read or any verbal instructions people gave me_ constantly made mistakes at work_ couldn't remember anything. I also had horrid bad dreams that repeated over and over again all night_ something I never had before this med. It got to the point I didn't even want to go to bed because I knew it would just be an all-night horror show. I walked around all day in a stupor--I'm not sure I was ever in fact awake the whole time I was on the medication. The only way I can say it helped my mania is because I was too tripped out to care that I was manic. Then the rage set in. I would lose control and go berserk about everything--when my purse fell over the seat of my car_ I threw it across the car 12 times and broke a bunch of CD's before I even realized how insane I'd become.

Positives:  Seroquel made me very sleepy in a nice_ cozy way. It also left me calmer by day and enhanced the effect of my antidepressant (Effexor) adding another ""layer of protection"" against depression and anxiety. I was on the lowest dosage (25 mg) but even so_ 2 or 3 months in I begain to gain weight.  I had lost 31 lbs over the past year (on purpose) and was very pleased about that. And then WHAM! A delayed but very pronounced gain of about 5 lbs per month until I had regained ALL of that weight and more.  Had I known wt.gain was such a big risk I NEVER would have touched the stuff.

Can't fall back a aleep without eating_ a lot.  Sometimes if I have food near_ I find myself waking up already eating.  Kind of strange.  But I have to admit that I get much more sleep than I did before taking Seroquel.  Also_ in the past_ I did not remember any of my dreams when I woke up_ for a long time and now I often remember them and they have actually been somewhat pleasant_ not like I remember in the past.,M,50,10  months,2/20/2007Email,Seroquel

Although getting off this medicine has been hard_ I'm glad I'm doing it.  My doctor said I should have it out of my system by next week.  Right now_ we're sticking with the Cymbalta at same dose until we see how being off Seroquel for awhile does.  I've managed the withdrawal side affects with xanax to help curb panic and anxiety and taken Benadryl to help with the itchiness.  Still_ stopping this medication is NOT PLEASANT!

Yes_ it helps with sleep but as a higher dose was needed as my toleration to it increased_ it has caused nothing but problems.

Eyes hurting and tension from lack of decent_ deep sleep. Even with sleepingpills the quality is better.,I forgot to mention in my earlier statement that I used to be on Zopiclone as wELL as amitripyline on the same time that I was taking Seroquel in the night time to help me slepp. So when I tapered off all the others expect Seroquel the bad quality ofsleep showed up. I went off amitriptyline because a doc wanted I try cymbalta_ but it was poison to me so I went back on amitriptyline and doubled the dose. It's supposed to better the quality of sleep and reduce pain a bit_ so I suggest you take that rather than seroquel! I know the docs say a lot of bullshit about the safety of seroquel but I'm sure it's more slyer than any of the straightforward and maybe old and proven sedatives!,F,40,8  months,12/26/2006Email,Seroquel

I was taking Seroquel at night 25 mg and then 25 mg on waking up after five hours. I wasn't sure it was reducing my anxious feelings but I did get a sleepy feeling from it. I was_ HOWEVER_ also taking other medicines to help me sleep (zopiclone_ a cousin of benzoes_ at first and then tematsepam_ a benzo_ and Somadril_ a muscle relaxant_ for a while because the zopiclone didn't seem to work effectively anymore). After 7 months I had to taper off on the strong sedatives as I had grown tolerant to them. That's when I noticed that Seroquel actually produced really bad quality sleep! No matter how many hours I slept I kept feeling underslept. The situation was only stabilized when I cut down on Seroquel and started on zopiclone again. Now I use about 25 mg per night only. I wouldn't recommend more than that.,F,40,8  months,12/26/2006Email,Seroquel

If everyone took it_ there'd be no wars because everyone would be sleeping or eatting all the time. I think scientists should try to geneticaly engineer this molecule into the human body permanently.

Been on it for about a month_ if I gain anymore_ I will cut back even more than the 100mg/day the doctor initially prescribed. More diet and excercise will be the rule for the time being - we'll see,"I can't say how much this medication has brought me back down to earth. I'm also on 100mg Lamicatal. Lamictal took me out of depression - but also took me too high. (especially with coffee...turned me into the great corn-holio). Seroqel ""quelled"" the racing thoughts and gave me a good nights sleep. Why does there always have to be a trade-off with medications?

1050, 2, bipolar 1_ rapid cycling,Strange_ I read through everyones' responses and found only a few people who had stuffy noses.  I had the weight gain_ slight hair loss_ the lower doses cause more daytime lethargy_ higer doses work better strangly enough.  My problem was stuffy nose and sleep apnea.  It started off as a mild side effect and ended up seriously affecting my breathing.  I would wake up gasping for breath. I felt my nasal passages closing and my throat constricting.  Could not sleep for the first couple of hours even though I was exhausted because I was trying to remember to take breaths.  It seems to be a cumulative effect that gets worse over time.  I went up to 300mg at night a month ago- I just had to use some nasal spray at night for the stuffiness_ but it got worse- almost like a panic.  I HATE that this happend because nothing worked as well as Seroquel for my anxiety and obsessions.  I am sad and worried what symptoms of mine will return.

Maybe loose stools and a bad appetite is due to Seroquel?,I had a problem with increased greasiness of the skin while I was taking Remeron (an anti-depressant) for 8 months_ so I'm quite sure this problem is due to my present use of Seroquel. I fall asleep around 3 am and sleep until 1-2 pm_ and have a hung over feeling for most of the day until I get more energetic at bedtime. Seroquel 2 x 25 mg alone doesn't help me sleep_ I need benzos as well. My life is more on track now because I've had more capacity to deal with it.

My god I've gained 30 lbs. I've also noticed I get a heat sensation in the small of my back. For no apparent reason my back will feel like im leaning on a heating pad. It's nothing serious enough for me to discontinue use of Seroquel but it is odd.,I do think Seroquel is a miracle pill. It is rather expensive when you start taking high doses_ for example I take 500 mg per day. However you cannot put a price on your health and happiness.

1093, 2, Sleep & Mood,Seroquel is very addictive. Youâll need lots of sleeping pills when coming off this med because what it does for dependency for sleep (replacing brain chemicals). If you know the history of drugs used for epilepsy (BP patients have a chance of having an epileptic episode while people with epilepsy may have BP symptoms with sudden discontinuation) never go on and of this kind of drug suddenly. Concentration is another issue when on this drug.,If you need a drug because youâre just too antsy it will definitely chill you out (maybe too chilled because youâll feel tired all day). This drug will affect how you feel in the morning (drowsy) and how long you sleep. I would not recommend this drug. Avoid it if youâre just taking it for sleep since it will give you side effects that you have never dealt with before_ particularly during discontinuation.,M,28,5  years,9/4/2006,Seroquel

Abnormal vivid dreams_ agitation/irritation towards others. Trouble with memory and some incoherence. Slight hallucination (Bug flying around where the was none) and at times increased Paranoia_ slight arthritis. Increased appetite after I take_ but haven't seen weight gain as of yet.,So far Seroquel has been helping my mood but at some expense. My fuse is alot shorter now_ and I tend to be snippy and easily annoyed by almost everything around me_ alot of the time in the daytime. When I first took it while using Marijuana_ It skyrocketed my paranoia to a level where I could no longer function in society. I was scared for my life from some unseen threat for 3 months until I calmed down_ and I had only taken the Seroquel for a week before I crashed. I still haven't recovered from that 6 months after taking_ but It's almost there. Taking it again to help my mood.

He pigs out at night about 1 hour after taking it and then falls completely asleep and will not wake up for anything.  He is very hungry in the morning too for sugary-type things.  The 9 year old is not affected at all by the over eating side effect.  Overall_ I think it is a great drug.,My sons take it_ one is 9 years old and is usually hyperactive/manic all day -1/2 of a 25 mg 2X a day calms him down to where is is not climbing the walls and seems to be able to think a little straighter and seems much happier and more at peace. He actually seems to concentrate a little better with small doses spread out throught the day.  Sometimes the 1/2 in the day makes him to sleepy though_ so we have even cut it into 1/4 2x a day and that seems to really do the trick.  He also takes 250 mg of depakote at night and another 50 mg of seroquel at bedtime. He is not groggy in the morning.  He is so much more loving and kind when he takes it.  You can tell when he did not take it.  It is very obvious.       I also give them both vitamins and fish oil.

1184, 4, Bipolar disorder,Well...My BIG belly!  Seroquel has worked really well for me over the last 6 years (off and on).  But I can't take the weight gain part any longer.  I've sorta gotten used to the drowsiness in the morning_ but I never fully regained my energy_ and it seemed to cause some muscle stiffness.  Recently I've noticed some aggitation (bitchiness).  Oh_ and my libido went down a bit.,I was able to notice the side effects of seroquel when I would get off the meds.  I started to lose weight_ I had more energy_ I was able to stretch easier (at workout).  I've started to notice some aggitation from taking seroquel_ like right after I take it_ or the next morning.  In the last several months I've been trying to find an alternative for my seroquel.  I used to take 100 mg_ while I was hospitalized_ a few years ago_ the doc was giving me 400 mg/day.  I remeber I slept for 3 days!  Now I'm down to 25mg_ which helps me sleep_ but I've developed a major dependence on it. Without it I'd stay awake for days_ then I'd probably get manic again.  This drug has definitely helped me through some bad times_ but trying to lose weight on it is like shoveling snow in a snow storm.  If I don't maintain my excersice routine within 3 weeks I'll gain the weight back and then some.  I've gained over 50lbs. 6 years ago.  I'm tired of being overweight_ it sucks!  I'm ready for a change.,F,29,6  years,2/3/2006Email,Seroquel
1185, 5, Insomnia,Increased Appetite,Yes_ I've been taking Seroquel for a little over 5 years_ and it is the best sleep-inducing drug I've ever tried.

It works very well for me.,F,20,5  years,2/2/2006,Seroquel

At night I layed in bed and obsessively thought about my mortality and death in general...not fun.,The first night I took the reccommended 25 mg starting dosage and took a shower and began to have weird thoughts like I have never had before.  Memories of a long time ago_ mixed with thoughts_ mixed with an eerie depression.  The next couple nights I increased the dosage and the thoughts increased_ including thinking about death every night.  I have thought about death every night since being on the medicine_ not about suicide_ but about mortality.  Racing heartbeat evertime I took it at night_ trying to fall asleep_ I would also not be able to breath out of my nose_ but that is becuase of the Depakote I'm also on...the doc said it's the combo of the two causing that.  I felt great during the day_ but at night_ every time I took Seroquel_ I would lay in bed trying to fall asleep and not be able to breath through my nose and think about my mortality until I nodded off.  Not fun_ let me tell you.  Now_ i'm trying to get off it_ and I have never had insomnia before_ until now.  I couldn',M,24,3  months,2/2/2006,Seroquel

I've found that its best to take at night and you might be asleep within an hour.,My moods don't swing nearly as much and I can hold a job better. I might be psychologically addicted to it already because I awake agitated when I sleep without it.  This drug is very good at calming.  I've only experienced normal 20mg dose.In comparison to Zyprexa_ which I took religeously for 2 years a few years back: Seroquel is a better (more moderate) dose for me.  I still have access to the full range of natural emotions where when on Zyprexa I was just constantly in a state of void and not at full productivity. I compliment these meds with vitamins B complex (anti-depressant)_ C_Garlic(heart) & fish oil (mood swings (hard to judge its effectiveness))_ and marijuana.  I believe I function well under marijuana (when on zyprexa I often felt like additionally smoking weed would inflict physical pain on my brain).

It is affecting my job and home life ..because I'm so damn cranky on it.  I called my doctor about this.. he said to continue taking it..it may kick in about 3 weeks..the thing is I can't wait that long because I won't have a job or a family by then.  I just stopped.. I only take 100mg at bedtime..it does help for sleep..but I never had a problem sleeping.  It didn't work for me and I don't plan to take it anymore.,I was wondering if other people had these type of effects from taking seroquel.

Since stabilising my eating_ I no longer have this problem_ especially if I eat something right before taking it.,Regarding insomnia_ it's either totally uneffective at 25mg or I find myself not only sleeping at night but sleeping the whole day at 50+mg.  I'll purposefully miss activities because I cannot keep from sleeping.  Thus_ I look at it as a helpful but not so helpful drug.  At least I'm sleeping_ but the excessive sleeping is keeping me from being productive.  I can't even begin to hold down a job_ go to school_ etc!,F,25,2  years,1/9/2006,Seroquel
1199, 1, anxiety_ depression_ insomnia,Weight gain (35 pounds)_ unusual and sometimes disturbing dreams,I was prescribed this medication by a psychiatrist at an outpatient program I was in for one day. This doctor did not explain to me what the drug was for or what the side effects were_ and it was not until I started seeing a more responsible psychiatrist that I learned about this drug. It was a highly innappropriate drug to be prescribed for my symptoms_ and the side effects (weight gain in the short term_ and tardive dyskinesia in the long term) were absolutely not worth it for me_ and not for most people. It did let me sleep_ which was why I continued taking it for so long and even started again after quitting. It didn't help my anxiety or depression.,F,24,2  years,1/9/2006,Seroquel

I have been an extreme insomnia for the last 5 years_ 30mg of Stilnox would only knock me out for 4 hours that was until I was prescribed seroquel now I can sleep for 8 hours straight_ sometimes more.

I didn't dream normally on this drug & woke up extremely groggy and miserable after a while. Going from 25mg to 50mg actually made this worse_ so I went back to 25mg. But the poor sleep eventually made me stop cold turkey.,I actually like this drug_ because it levels off symptoms of schizophrenia/neurosis so very well_ without any weird side effects (like zyprexa). I was less reactive and could go out and do things without much concern_ while still being 'connected' enough to relate to people half decently. It's just that it created a lack of quality sleep_ which started to negate all the positives after a while.

1204, 4, Bipolar Disorder/O.C.D.,Extreme weight gain (of about 30 pounds) and this weight has not dropped a single ounce since I stopped taking this medicine about five months ago. Back when taking it_ I had uncontrollable facial twitching at night while I laid in bed. My nose and mouth would involuntarily draw up tight like a puppet on strings. Horrible nightmares about things like Hell_ fire_ brimstone_etc. Had to be taken about thirty minutes before bed because it made me so drowsy I could not hold my head up.,I was diagnosed with O.C.D at age 19_ then a few years ago a different doc said Bipolar_ I am still not sure which one. While this drug helped a HUGE amount with my unwanted obsessive thoughts_it also made ME huge_ LOL_ and gave me side effects that remain with me to this day_ five months after stopping the medication.

I would like to know how to get my normal weight back and my metabolism corrected again.

I started this medication at a size 4 with a 24 inch waist_ now_ two years later I am a size 10/12 with a 32 inch waist. No matter what I do or how healthy I eat I simply can not drop the weight. I was put on Seroquel as the anti-epilectic medication I take (Lamotrigine) has a rare side effect that unfortunately has affected me. It makes it impossible for me to sleep_ so my doctor gave me Seroquel and yes_ it does make you sleep like a baby. But it is really not worth it when there are other medications out there.I am now seeing the Dr. to switch medications and discontinue Seroquel. I will wait for three months (after being off of it) and then come back and post my results. In other words_ I will let you know how long it took to lose weight after discontinuing Seroquel.,,F,32,2  years,12/8/2005,Seroquel

Intense hungover feeling every day_ takes several hours for this effect to leave each day_ which means I sleep for 10 hours +_ and am hungover for 4 or 5. Most of each day wasted.

I am somewhat concerned about the memory loss. as far as being hungry constant_ I am trying to control this myself as i feel the meds can only do so much_ the rest is up to me. Ihave suffered bipolar from the age of 13 and have had severe depression on top for 5 years as a result of my sons death. But in my adult life this is the first meds that have eased the swings_ suicidal thoughts and given me a full nights sleep_although night terrors are at times a problem.I do find it really does slow up the racing thoughts in the brain enabling me to relax and not worry so much_ most of the time anyway.

Dry mouth_ difficulty thinking and talking shortly after dosage but the body gets used it at low dosages in particular.  Large dosages will put me to sleep unless I am higher than a kite.  Long term use has not had any real side effects except for the traditional weight gain with an anti-psychotic.,My immediate world credits this drug for turning me into a relatively sane and functioning individual (BP rapid cycler_ anxiety_ severe insomnia.  It put me to sleep at night (with  200 mg) and awake in the morning since it has a short half life.  A small dose in the am of 25 mg kept me mellow but not drugged during the day.  IT is increased of times when I crack apart and willing to give up the remainder of my life to the drug=I guess it is a balance.  It is tauted as a mood stablizer which I cannot necessarily vouch for given that this is only one drug in my arsenal of 6 RX of a rapid cycler.  After over 3 years on this drug_ I am trying Zyprexa as a new avenue to gain greater sanity since there seem to be few options left and I still could use a bit more...At this moment_ I much prefer Seraquel over Zyprexa in terms of sleep and mental clarity but Zyprexa for mood elevation.,F,35,3  years,11/21/2005,Seroquel

When I don't take seroquel_ I often wake up 10-15 times a night if I'm lucky enough to fall asleep in the first place.  I take an extremely low dose since I'm sensitive to medication (12.5 mg).  At first_ I had no problems with the med.  After a couple of weeks on it_ I began to feel anxiety and weakness as my dose would wear off.  I'm sure my body has become acustomed to the med_ so I'm going to try taking a morning and an evening dose.

Terrible nightmares the first few nights and that has stopped.  I did feel like a zombie_ but I can tell I'm getting used to it.  I have been having stomach cramps for an entire day and I'm not sure if it's drug related at all.  It feels like it.  I've been on other medications that cause me to feel the same way_ but again_ I'm not certain.,No racing thoughts.  I can go to bed and relax.  My overall mood is better.

Slight sexual side-effects. I take 2x25 mg before bedtime.,It's a great anxiety and insomnia killer. However_ my depression stayed firmly in place. I'm hoping to lift this by adding 150 mg Wellbutrin SR which I now feel (day 11) is increasing the anxiety again. May be this is only a side effect of Wellbutrin which will pass??

In the last 3 months I have gained 20 pounds and didn't know why because my Topamax is suppose to keep my weight down. I just recently realized it was from my recent increase in my Seroquel. For 18 months i took 12.5 MG or 25MG and had no weight gains_ actually had wonderful weight loss.  Now I cannot loose weight and I am working out 5 times a week and barely eating. Since I use to be anorexic this is a horrible problem and is completely depressing me. So I am going to the Doctor on Monday.

My RX was for 25mg in a.m. 50mg in p.m. The following morning the pain lessened some but never went away and I was forced to hobble when I walked. After a week of this I call the pharm. and she said that I probably needed to find another med. and then I called the emergency psych. and she told me to take one more the next night and then quit. She emailed my psych. and told him she'd taken me off. He nor his nurse think that the seroquel was the problem and that maybe the ""heat"" or low potassium was the issue. I asked then shouldn't I get my levels tested. And she said no_ just wait a few days and start again. Screw that_ I wasn't playing lab rat! I called my m.d.'s nurse & she put in a blood work order for me. All my electrolites ect. were just fine. It's been over a month and I still have a rock solid calf. I limp all the time and it's thrown all the rest o","I waited a week after this ""new"" diagnois'was made to make sure that I really needed it and that I understood all the side effects.

I have tried to wean off the drug_ but it seems that I was worse off than before starting it_ my advice it you is not to get on this drug except for as a last resort_ if you thought sleep was impossible before the drug_ try to live without it_ it seems to alter your body chemistry. I have tried to go back to some of my old drugs as an desperate attempt to live without the seroquel and its side affects_ but have found that I am actually more sensitive to former drugs now than before taking seroquel_ and I am convinced its because of the seroquel.,I know some of you have a weight gain complaint and some of you don't after taking the drug_ but I'll will tell you this_ I am a serious hiker_and am always active.

You know_ you get a little frustrated when you're killing yourself on a grueling routine and get NOWHERE.

I do have some memory and concentration problems_ but these could be related to 25 years with depression and bipolar disorder_  or to the other meds I take (Wellbutrin 400mg_ depakene 400 mg),I began with a small dose of seroquel (50 mg) during a hospitalization 15 months ago_ dose was increased to 125 mg about a year ago.  Six months ago (another hospitaliztion!) seeroquel increased to 50 mg am 5o mg pm and 200 mg at bedtime.  This dose let me quit Klonpin COMPLETELY and has really been holding my mood swings.  I had had bad reactions to Topamax and Lamictal (increased/debilitating depression)-Seroquel has literally been a lifesaver.,F,52,15  months,5/3/2005,Seroquel

I recently started up again in October 2005_ and have gained a little weight_ but what concerns me is that this medication can cause increased triglycerides_ and cholesterol_ it did me at 200mg_ but so far so good currently a second time at only 100mg at night. I really like Seroquel_ but do worry about the side effects of the above I mentioned_ it is fantastic for sleep_ and if you can find the right dose for you_ you don't wake up too groggy either. Best wishes to all.,I have been on Seroquel 2 times in my life_ first time_ 200mg at bedtime_ presently I take 100mg at bedtime. It is the only med that gets me to sleep from my racing thoughts. It gives me a full night's sleep_ and the side effects are 50/50. Seroquel just really calms me down_ and sometimes more than the benzo I take.,F,34,5  months,3/11/2005Email,Seroquel

1294, 4, Post-traumatic stress disorder,Sleepiness at first_ rapid heartbeat after night-time dose (200mg),Seroquel is really helping with the flashbacks and intrusive memories. I take 50mg at 6pm and 200mg at 10-11pm. I sleep for about 12 hours but I don't work so it's not a problem.

Since I'm back to work I discontinued the AM dose because of the drowisness.  It has helped with my mood disorder and the compulsive feelings.  I question if it is addictive a couple of times I didn't take my evening dose and couldn't sleep.  In order to function and keep sane I need sleep without the Seroquel I can't sleep.

I was having a major anxiety attack and took 3 Ativans (lorazepam)_ and it wasn't doing anything.  My psychiatrist told me to take 4 Seroquels (@ 25mg each) and go to bed.  Unfortunately_ I had a guy friend over and I started babbling about who-knows-what and then found out in the morning from my roommate that I had sex with him.  The scary part is that I was to blacked out from the Seroquel I wasn't even aware that I had sex.  From now on_ I'm not going to hang out with anybody when I take a higher dosage.,F,21,1  months,2/22/2005,Seroquel

Take entire dose at night because of sedation_ when I am up anyway I just must be careful rising and walking around. Very vivid dreams_ but not nightmares I was having. Terrible heartburn. Constipation counteracts my lithium runs_ so happy ending there. THIRSTY.,My mood seemed depressed at first- I was sleeping 12 hours or more on 25 mg. I quickly adjusted and soon needed 100 to sleep at all. More cycling raised the dose again_ and I was dropping dosage of Topomax due to side effects so Seroquel was counterbalancing. Just up for 2 days_ time to call the doc but I am not sure what next...also gained 5 pounds in 2 days- essentially without eating. This is an issue for me.,F,43,7  months,2/22/2005Email,Seroquel

I don't know how long I can stand to be like this because I feel as though my whole body is trembling. I will take the additional 200mg of Seroquel to see if it helps. I feel as though I want to jump out of my skin. I cannot cope this way. Have started taking more Klonopin to kill some of the anxiety but it comes back after 3 hours. I am very frightened. Still have panic attacks after 400mg. Hope the addition of the other 200mg. Still works_ but I may be couch bound.,I am scared about the side effects from this drug; I get so many spots in front of my eyes that I feel as though I am going to black out.

With my anxiety condition and problems with arthritis_ I was a mess during the day without taking the Seroquel cause I was always tired from lack of sleep.  My doctor and I agreed that not sleeping during the night was causing much stress on my joints and that's why we decided on the Seroquel.  When I was taking Ambien for sleep_ it wasn't working near as well_ and that's why I was changed to Seroquel.  It's nice to be able to actually get a full nights sleep for a change.

This drug is scaring me.  I want to get off of it. I have very little motivation and thoughts of suicide. I'm extremely depressed.,This drug helps you sleep but the side effects are devastating. I've been on it for about a year now.  My nightmares are vivid and make the mornings scary. Makes you groggy in the A.M. as well.  My doctor wanted me to take 100 mg. three times a day.  I couldn't even move at that point I was so sedated.  Now_ I've tapered to 50 mg. at night_ but my hair comes out in clumps every time I comb or wash it. This has increased my anxiety tremendously.  I feel like I am falling apart.  These doctors have no idea what experiencing these side effects is like. They read what the drug companies print and subscribe accordingly. I am very sorry I started taking this medication.  The first night I tried going without it_ I didn't get one minute of sleep. Now_ I think my body is addicted to it.

However NO WEIGHT GAIN like Lithum_ Depakote_ & Tegretol.,I have recently started having severe memory problems_ disoriented_ unable to judge distance_ etc. but I do not know if it is because of Seroquel or a combination of the other 5 drugs (Lamictal_ Strattera_ Adderall_ Prozac_ & Cymbalta) I am taking.  Overall Seroquel and the other 5 drugs have greatly helped me.  I am once again having sleep problems_ I get about 3 hours and I am unable to go back to sleep.  However_ my doctor said that I can safely take up to 800 mg and I am currently at 400 mg.  I have told several friends and family members about Seroquel and they all love it.  I have been on Seroquel for 18 months and I doubt my doctor will ever take me off of it_ so I am learning to deal with the negative_ so that I can make my life positive.

I got on the scale tonight_ and surprise...another 5 pounds gained.  This is my first time ever going online to research a medication.  I feel compelled to let you know_ because I KNOW FOR A FACT that my eating habits have been healthier_ I have been exercising more than I have ever in my life and I am gaining too much.  It's unbelievable.  I cannot believe that this side effect is merely at 5% clinically.  This medication should be discontinued or not even prescribed for anyone because the effects of looking and having to struggle to lose the Seroquel weight is 100 times more depressing than being my regular depressed self.  I will take my manic skinny days back if I could over my now fat (big gut_ skinny legs_ looking like I have a belly tumor) self.  I HATE IT.
