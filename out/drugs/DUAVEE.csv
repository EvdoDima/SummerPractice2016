0, 4, Migraines_hot flashes_ insomnia,Headache for a day or two then no side effects. I just feel more like myself than I have in a long time.,I am very glad my gyro was willing to prescribe hormone therapy. My regular Dr has a fear of it even though I have very low BP and get yearly mammograms. I think if a patient needs them it's a quality of life issue.,F,51,1  months20mg,4/22/2015Email,Duavee
