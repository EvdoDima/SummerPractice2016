0, 5, Brutal migraine headaches,I get dizzy and flush within an hour of taking a pill. Worse side effects if I am active. Doesn't matter; it is so worth it. Nothing ever worked until I took Imitrex.,Works within 30 minutes for me.,M,45,6  months100mg,7/29/2016,Imitrex

5, 1, Migraine,Horrible heavy feeling on my shoulders and neck_ this intense burning sensation all over my head and down my neck and shoulders_ extreme anxiety and the feeling like i was having a heart attack.,I worked out after I took an imitrex because the migraine felt better and I hadn't worked out yet today_ and after I finished I started getting these horrible burning sensations and my heart rate sky rocketed_ it still hasn't gone away and I took the imitrex almost three hours ago. It's weird because the nasal spray imitrex works great for me but I always have these nasty side effects from the pill.,M,19,4  weeks,2/22/2016,Imitrex
6, 1, Migraine x 5 days.,Tightness and squeezing in chest_ shoulders_ neck and jaw that was unbearable and seemed to last forever. Also had itchy face_ irritability_ flushing and could not sit still. Only experienced mild relief if any.,It was not for me!,F,32,1  times100mg,2/18/2016,Imitrex
7, 5, Migraines,None,I read other reviews after being prescribed Imitrex by my doctor.  I was pretty worried to take it.  But after dealing with a migraine for 4+ days_ I was ready to try anything.  Within 40 minutes of taking the 100 MG pill_ my migraine was completely gone.  The best part is that I didn't experience any of the side effects that others have reported.  Lifesaver medicine!,F,31,1  days100 MG 1X W,2/9/2016,Imitrex
8, 1, Migraine,Dizzy_ hot_ heavy_ sleepy_ unbalanced_ loss of consciousness_ extremely low blood pressure.,I don't remember the dosage I had since it was long time ago_ but this medication almost killed me. I remember my body feeling hot and very heavy. I was very dizzy and tired and didn't have the energy to keep myself standing or sitting up.  I laid down and my roommate called an ambulance when she couldn't wake me up. I woke up just before the ambulance pulled into the hospital drive feeling disoriented and confused. If I remember right I was only treated with oxygen but  I was told that I was very lucky to be alive. Apparently the pill I took was in milligrams but the shot that was on order was in grams. I was told by the doctor that when the paramedics first checked me my blood pressure was almost non existent and that if I had taken the shot I would be dead.  This experience has made me nervous of taking any new medication_ so I always make sure someone is with me the first time I take a new medication.,F,46,1  days 1X D,2/4/2016,Imitrex
9, 5, Chronic debilitating migraines,burning sensation throughout the body as the medication spreads_ followed by flushing.  Nausea.,Imitrex really is a life saver.  Instead of spending several days down & immobile in a dark_ quiet room_ a 1ml injection and 10-15 minutes of burning and nausea (mitigated by Zofran/Ondansetron) clears me right up.  I have a standing supply of Imitrex/Sumatriptan tablets as well_ but the injections are so much faster-acting.  However_ the side effects of the injections are much more potent_ as well...  The same side effects are present with tablets_ but come on much slower (45-60 minutes for onset & lasting another hour as opposed to starting within 1-2 minutes for the injection and lasting 10-15 mins) and less intense.  For immediate relief_ I can't recommend Imitrex highly enough.,M,34,2  years100mg 1X AN,1/26/2016Email,Imitrex
10, 1, Migraine,I took one pill for a migraine. Within a half hour I became very dizzy and lightheaded. I soon began to have neck pressure as if my neck would explode! My head was still pounding and along with the neck pressure I could hardly function. I also felt like I was going to vomit_ but never did. This drug seemed to make my vision even worse. It took slung two hours for this terrible feeling to wear off and the headache finally subsided. It was back within a few hours. The worst part is that this drug made my heart arrhythmia go insane. I've had an ablation done on my heart and my arrhythmia was pretty much u der control until I took imitrex. It made my heart skip every their beat for about an hour and made me short of breath and dizzy. I definitely do not recommend this drug.,I am never taking this horrible drug again. It is deadly.,F,50,1  days100 mg,1/18/2016,Imitrex
11, 3, Migraine Headache,My entire body_ especially my arms_ neck_ head_ shoulders and upper back felt HEAVY. I could barely hold my head up. I was doing everything I could to hold my head up_ but I wasn't doing a very good job at that. I was pretty much slouching forward as I attempted to watch tv. The pressure that I felt in my head and jaws was almost identical to what it feels like when you're upside down for an extended period of time. It feels like all the blood has rushed to my head_ and there's absolutely nothing I can do to make it any better. I tried walking around_ but it didn't help. My skin also has the sensation you get when you put on the type of tanning lotion that brings all the blood to the surface of your skin and makes you have a tingling sensation all over. That's the only way I know how to explain what I'm feeling. Due to the pressure and tightening in my check_ I've literally had to keep reminding myself that I'm going to be okay_ and kept praying that my heart wouldn't stop beating. The side effects from this medication are not fun at all. The Tightening in my Head_ Jaw_ Neck_ Throat_ and Chest are unbelievable_ and I wouldn't recommend this medication. Please be careful if you do decide to take it!!,,F,34,5  weeks50 MG,1/7/2016Email,Imitrex
12, 1, Migraine,Severe head pain_ spine and shoulder pain_  elevated BP_ jaw pain_ facial numbness_ possible  hallucination_  and dizziness,Felt like my head was going to EXPLODE for at least 30 minutes.  And for the next couple hours my headache was worse than it started. BP went up to 130/90 (normal 110/80). I took the second pill and the headache  only thing that got better was light and sound sensitivity. The head throbbing was still there. Then a few hours later the headache was back full force. And I  Felt like my spine and shoulders were being ripped from my body. That was probably a hallucination but that's how it felt.,F,39,1  weeks100mg,1/5/2016Email,Imitrex
13, 1, Migraines,High blood pressure_ dizzy_ nasea_ rapid heart beat,I know people who take this and love it. Unfortunately_ it didn't help my headache and made me very sick.

But when I had sex with my boyfriend I thought I was going to die_ like I couldn't breathe and I thought I was going to throw up after I had to lay down and drink water and focus on not dying ha.. It was scary I felt as light as a feather and was shaking it was hard to walk and no it wasn't the good feeling after sex,Takes away my migraines just be careful if your planning on getting the d lmao,F,19,3  days25,10/12/2015Email,Imitrex
19, 5, severe migraines with N/V,tiredness_ frequent urination_ when I take the injectable it seems like it may get a little more intense but only last for a couple minutes then it is gone.  I love this medication.  It saved my life!,I have been on Imitrex since it first came out in the early 90's.  There was only the injectable then.  Now I can get the injectable in vials_ which I prefer 100% more than the loader.  I just buy the diabetic syringes & inject it in my butt_ towards the side.  I only take the injectable when I wake up with a migraine.  It will wake me up out of a dead sleep and then I start vomiting due to the pain of the migraine.  The injectable works for me 100% of the time.  Before Imitrex came out I was always in the hospital getting shots of Demerol or Morphine.  I even wrote a letter to the pharmaceutical company praising them.  I do have to admit I am sad that now I have to get the generic.  I Love this medication.  It is a medical miracle.,F,54,23  years50 1X D,10/1/2015Email,Imitrex
20, 5, Migraines,Hard to describe vertigo and a general bad feeling. Just sick,Thank God for immitrex it works great but sometimes need narcotic for rescue.

22, 3, Migraine headache,Nausea_ dizziness_ weakness_ malaise_ closed-eye hallucinations,I don't like Imitrex as much as Amerge because it has some weird neurological side effects_ such as seeing patterns and colors (I know: this sounds like a fun side effect_ but it's really not).  Similar to Amerge_ it seems to make me feel worse for a while before I feel better.,F,38,50  times50 mg 1X D,7/5/2015Email,Imitrex
23, 1, Migraines,I could feel the individual chambers of my heart beating and had a general awareness of the flow of my blood flowing through all of my veins and arteries. I could literally feel the blood flow through my body up my arms and legs to my heart and from my heart back to my arms and legs. It was a terrifying sensation accompanied with extreme anxiety. I was worried that I was dying. I could feel and hear my blood flowing. Eventually I fell asleep for 10 hours and woke without the migrane but with a generally groggy and stunted mental awareness and extreme physical exhaustion that lasted several days.,I would NEVER recommend taking this medication. The side effects were just too frightening. I was switched to Frova which had no side effects for me.,F,40,3  times25 MG,7/2/2015Email,Imitrex
24, 4, Chronic Migraine headaches,Strange burning that goes directly into my sinuses_ my nostrils are on fire too!!! It's like someone poured rubbing alcohol straight in there!!!

26, 1, Chronic Migraines,Thought at first it was great because my migraines stopped. One hour in my neck_ shoulders_ and jaw were causing so much pain I thought I had meningitis again. Can't bend my neck after immatrex. Worth trying if you have migraines. You may be one of the fortunate ones that experience no side effects.,,F,30,4  days100mg,4/26/2015Email,Imitrex
27, 2, Migraine,First time using injection. Only side effect I had was feeling a more severe headache from the base of my skull that spread up my entire head. I then went to sleep and awoke with the migraine I had at the start.,,F,45,1  days,4/22/2015,Imitrex
28, 5, Migraines for 25 years,Tightness / heaviness in chest_ sometimes hard to breath_ like a giant squeeze in my chest. Rapid heartbeat sometimes_ but I think that may be me panicking. This happens mostly with the sumatriptan shot or Sumavel shot rather than the 100 mg pill dose. Tightening in throat. Extreme fatigue after 30 min or so_ again much more intense with shot vs pill.,I have had migraines since I was about 11. I have lost days and weeks at a time from them and have tried numerous medications. Imatrex has really saved my life! There have been countless times that my husband has had to pick me up from work because I couldn't see to drive from the pain. When they hit me hard and fast like that I go straight to the shot form. You feel an immediate rush of the medicine and very intense tightening of chest and tingling in your forehead and scalp. But 10 minutes and your migraine is gone! Very sleepy and sometimes you get a recourse migraine and have to repeat the meds_ but the pain be be gone. Absolutely hands down worth the side effects!,F,36,5  years100 mg 2X D,4/18/2015,Imitrex
29, 3, Migraine,"This is only the 4th time I've taken this medication I am hoping the side effects wear off since it does work.   Shortly after taking I feel a little ""odd""_ jittery and light headed (wears off within an hour).  I also get what I consider a pseudo hot flash (1st time it happened I thought the heat in the office was too high) and am a little flushed.   Later on my skin becomes very sensitive (feels almost bruised to the touch) and I am aware of every seam on my clothing (annoying not painful)  I also learned that I cannot take this on an empty stomach (I think it was the medication_ but it could have been the headache_ though I have never thrown up from a migraine before ) as I was sick about 15minute to 1/2 hour after taking when I woke up in the middle of the night with a migraine.  Felt awful the rest of the day.","I will sometimes require a second dose 2 hours later.  No change in side effects.   I've suffered migraine's for 10 years.  This has been the most effective medication I tried and does not leave me with a ""migraine hangover"" I do get a bit chatty though.",F,39,3  months100mg 1X D,4/9/2015Email,Imitrex
30, 4, yrs of migraine 16+ days per month,"After taking_ I feel a little nauseous (not as bad as migraine nausea though) then hot_ sometimes my heart races a little_ then have to urinate a lot for a few hours_ feel ""bruisy"" all over_ tightness in jaw and neck_ especially if I eat or drink something (like biting lemon no matter what it is). I usually try to sleep after taking one_ skips my noticing the side effects_ but sometimes it is a work day or time for work and I have to function. All this is better than my migraines_ which last up to four days if I do not take the medication.",This has helped me function. I do worry about long term use since I am at the highest dosage and see no end to these migraines. I only have to take them twice or three times a month_ so I am hoping that helps. The 50 mg tablets worked_ but I always had to take a second one within hours of the first and the migraines were still lasting many days in a row_ so I was taking more mgs than I am now. Now I take the 100 and the migraine is gone_ usually for over a week. Rarely it comes back two days in a row.,F,42,3  years100 1X AN,3/21/2015,Imitrex
31, 4, Migraine,Feeling of intense heaviness in upper body...so much that I struggle to stay upright_ followed by a lot of urination....6-7X in first hour. After the first 30 mins of heaviness_ I can go about my day and usually half the dose will help migraine without the intense heaviness_ but I sleep it off when I can. After first hour or so_ my entire body is extremely sore. My throat hurts_ I'm stiff_ weak_ uncoordinated_ etc for about 4 or so hours. Better than a migraine hangover though.,I prob need to be on a prophylactic med but honestly these symptoms are bearable to me compared to migraines and the side effects I've had with prophylactic meds so I'm extremely satisfied. Id rather treat when it happens than be on a med all the time. Doc may force another med on me though because I'm having around 10/month.,F,24,1  years100mg,3/8/2015,Imitrex

33, 5, Migraine,When it is taking out a migraine_ I literally feel it push out the headache_ if that makes any sense. I get hot and have this weird sensation that's not tingly or makes me feel floaty_ but makes me just feel strange. Dr said that I could take it and continue on about my day_ which is true_ but I am almost completely out of it. I don't mind though because it sure beats a migraine.,Miracle drug. Side effects are bearable. (cutting off an appendage is better than having a full blown migraine.) My migraines usually make me nauseous so I have to take it w a Phenergan. The combination usually sends me into a drooling_ word-slurring coma_but I feel I've been pretty clear about what I will deal with to get rid of a migraine.,F,28,3  years100mg,2/6/2015Email,Imitrex
34, 5, Severe Ocular Migraines,I had no side effects.,I suffer from Migraines. I originally was put on a 25 MG dose and it did nothing_ when my doctor changed me to 50 MG it worked amazing.,F,29,30  days50 MG 2X D,1/15/2015Email,Imitrex

36, 5, cluster headaches,I use the injectable form.

37, 5, Chronic migraines lasting 4-5 days,Severe body aches_ tight muscles and stiffness in joints. In the rare times I needed a second dose_ I felt some tightness in the chest/ shortness of breath (this never lasted long or seemed bad enough to be alarmed),I have had migraines that last 4-5 days at a time at least once a month_ if not 2 or 3 times a month_ since I was 10 years old. My menstrual cycle is one of my triggers but the weather changes and my allergies are also constant triggers for me. Before I had this medication_ I was taking so many OTC pain relievers just to TRY to put a dent in the pain that I should honestly be dead....and they NEVER helped. Not even a little bit. By the time I made it to day 5 of a nonstop migraine_ I felt like I was going to die from the pain and felt like I might just be crazy enough to smash my own head against a wall until I passed out and that it might actually make me feel better.  I was never able to get Imitrex or any other migraine medication before the last year because I didn't have insurance and couldn't afford it_ so I suffered. I suffered a lot_ for a very long time. This drug has been a miracle for me. I get relief within 15 minutes about 95% of the time I take it and rarely have to take another dose the same day. My only complaint is the severe muscle aches and joint pain I suffer when I do have to take it. Still_ I would much rather suffer those than suffer the migraine pain that I've been dealing with most of my life with no relief.,F,33,1  years50 1X AN,12/17/2014Email,Imitrex

Occasionally a heart burn feeling. All lasting about 2 hours after administering. Then sudden energy and trouble sleeping that night. Next day kinda groggy.,I think most sensations can be attributed to the surge of oxygen in the body that is cut off during my migraines. I take it about 3-5 times a week. Cuts the migraine off and i am able to function normally.,F,25,4  years50,11/24/2014,Imitrex

Took Rx for 1 year before figuring out that these symptoms occur when I take the rx.  They increased slowly in intensity over the course of the year.,Don' take it.  Fibromalagyia type symptoms.  I don't have this but I thought I did before I began testing this product to see if the symptoms would arise_ and they certainly did.  I cut my pill in half to 25 mg to see if the symptoms subsided_ but they didn't.

Also_ for about the whole day_ warm water will feel like it burns my skin. Taking a shower is interesting. I try not to take the pill when I'm alone because who knows what that arm this is all about...,I'm keeping an eye out for a better med because this one makes it really is difficult to do things other than sit there after I take it.

I am also on Effexor which doesn't always play nice with triptans but I have not had any ill effects (thank goodness)  I would highly recommend this medication for anyone with migraines.

52, 1, Migraines,I've had two heart attacks from Imitrex_ the first one was while I was driving to the vet_ I had taken 25mgs of Imitrex ten mins. before I started driving and then experienced extreme pain in my chest and ended up in ER.  My blood pressure went up to 200 over 90 and the ambulance driver said you are having a heart attack.  By the time I got to hospital I was feeling a bit better but they kept me for 5 hours and then released me.  i followed up with additional tests but the the doctor never gave me a definite diagnosis why this happened.  Five years later I was seeing a neurologist and had taken a prescribed cocktail of 50 mgs. of Imitrex and a nausea medication and I had a massive heart attack and ended up in the ER and Cardiac unit for four days.  This happened withing 10-15 mins. of taking the drug.  I had extreme pain in my chest _ trouble breathing and a strange feeling in my arms.  I had every test and scan  possible and my arteries are completely clean_ in other words no plaque.,Please don't take this drug_ why it is still on the market is a mystery to me.

56, 5, Severe migrane,Almost no side effects. Slightly lightheaded sometimes for the first 60 to 90 minutes.  Relieves attack every time.

Made my migraine pain go away very quickly_ but I experienced terrifying side effects. I almost considered calling 911_ I thought I might have been going into cardiac arrest despite my young age. Most side effects lasted for ~2 hours after taking the spray. It is worth noting that heart attacks and abnormal levels of blood pressure run in my family.

58, 5, Menstrual/hormonal migraines,1st time taking it_ I had no side effects & migraine was gone in 15 mins. Migraines had lasted exactly 48 hours for the past 8 years & NOTHING otc had worked (didn't know it was a migraine as it moved from side to side sometimes_ light didn't bother me_ it worsened with bending over_ yet some relief came by laying down & holding my head in odd positions). I was in elated disbelief that it was gone_ yet afraid to move_ worried that it would come back with a vengeance. It didn't. Subsequent months it makes me feel...weird (can't even describe it) as it's working_ but the migraine is always gone in 45 minutes. I can deal with that feeling rather than the incapacitating 2 day migraine. Good riddance!,,F,42,5  months25 mg,3/13/2014,Imitrex

About 40 minutes after taking the pill the side effects hit_ I swore it was the worst drug ever_ said I would never take it again_ threatened to destroy the rest of the pills (if I could ever walk again)_ cried_ panicked_ finally realized that I wasn't dying and calmed down.  But then...within 10-15 minutes_ side effects-gone_ headache-GONE!! First relief I have had in many weeks. So_ I have to say_ the relief was well worth 15 minutes of hell and I will gladly take it again_ but next time I will at least know what to expect. :),,F,34,1  weeks100mg,3/4/2014,Imitrex

The pressure in my chest was like a boulder and my throat closed off_ I was left gasping like a fish out of water.  The beginnings of a migraine intensified by 100 percent.  There was a painful stiffness in my shoulders and  nausea dizzyness with my body having slight tremors.  It took 30 minutes for the effects to start and over two hours to lessen enough to sit up and contemplate taking the second dose.  It was horrible worse than any migraine medicine I have ever had...

62, 4, Severe migraines (average 2x wkly.),It makes me feel a little nauseated_ fatigued mild chest tightness and hot flashes come and go,I do cut them in half and take only 50 mg. when the headache is just coming on but if I wake up with a full blown blinding migraine_ I take 100 mg.  It almost always helps.  If not_ it can be taken with Aleve and that should help as a last resort.

63, 5, migraine,If I take the full 100 mgs I get a tight feeling in my chest and my throat constricts a little making it hard to swallow food.  But normally I can get by with cutting the pill in half and only taking 50 mgs which doesn't cause these side effects.  Also_ the drug acts as a vasoconstrictor_ so it makes it hard to get an erection for about a day afterward.,Takes about an hour to kick in_ but it's the only thing that works for my headaches.,M,41,5  years100 mg 1X D,12/11/2013,Imitrex
64, 4, Migraine,Lightheaded_ fatigue_ weak_ chest/ throat tightness_ clammy_ cold.,I've suffered from terrible migraines for years and thought nothing would ever help. Imitrex is the ONLY thing that will make a migraine go away for me_ the downsides...I would say are the side effects_ I don't feel comfortable driving or going to work and sometimes for days after I remain dizzy/lightheaded and unable to focus. I also regularly take Topomax which I highly recommend if you suffer from migraines because it has really reduced my migraine count from a couple times a week to about 2 times or less a month. My last suggestion maybe take half a pill at a time if you are prescribed 100MG Imitrex_ and take the other half if needed to help reduce some of those side effects.

65, 4, migraine,At first I took 100 mg and I got super rapid heartbeat_ flushed_ felt like I was really high_ weird tingly sensation in limbs_ but headache went away! I have since started cutting them in half_ which lessened these side effects almost all the way_ but still takes care of the migraine.,I didn't like the effects of the full dosage as I felt as incapacitated as I did with the migraine (although in a different and pain-free way). I could not function at work or feel safe driving.  Since I started splitting the pill in half_ these side effects have almost all but gone away_ but still gets rid of the headache. I do sometimes get a recurring migraine 8-12 hrs later_ but I treat it with another half_ which seems to work well.  it also acts as a diuretic_ I pee like a racehorse when on it!,F,38,6  months50 mg 1X AN,11/9/2013Email,Imitrex

Makes headache a little worse till it goes away about 3 hours later.,People who experience a severe worsening of headache do not have a dilated headache to start with and should not be taking sumatriptan.  They may have a vascular spasm migraine.  It feels the same_ but is made better by getting the arteries to relax instead of tighten up as imitrex causes.  I get both kinds of migraine_ have to determine which kind of headache I have_ then if a spasm one_ I take the herb and seasoning_ Rosemary.  It will dilate your arteries_ is anti-inflammatory.

71, 5, migraine,Flushed feeling from head to toe. Especially in head and chest. If you have ever taken niacin_ it is similar to the flushing felt by it. I'm feeling the flushing right now. Can't drink coffee because the heat burns my throat. A little nausea. I took probably closer to 75mg because the pills are hard to break in half. Prescribed 100 mg tabs. If I take over 50 mg_ the side effects are more intense. Lower the dose and it should relieve the migraine while lessening the tingling_ tightness_ flushing etc. It usually passes within 30 minutes(side effects). The headache is gone within 10 minutes. Very efffective medicine. I should probably invest in a pill slicer to make the dosage more accurate.,Very effective.

About 30 minutes after that_ the pain began to lessen dramatically.  Within minutes_ I was sound asleep and slept until 3 PM.  When I woke up_ the pain was still gone_ but side effects had arrived.  I have a thick tongue and when I talk_ I sound like I have had a stroke.  Everything else works properly_ so I am guessing it's just a side effect.  I am dizzy and having hot flashes. I feel short-of-breath.  My mood is unstable and I am depressed and anxious.  (I also take meds for depression and thyroid.)  I think that I will try this drug at least one more time_ but I will cut the tablet and see if a half dose works.  I can always take the other half later.

First my arms or legs and then everywhere_ which intensifies the pain spots in my head... but I don't mind because I know relief is just around the corner. I usually take it with an antacid to help the nausea_ so I don't throw it up. Aprox 20-40 mins later the instant relief_ and I can open my eyes again and actually see. I have a 4yr old and twin infants_ so I can't be out of commission for too long... (Thank God for my husband who is very simpathetic of my suffering.) Then the post migraine hangover begins which I think is easily mistaken for side effects of the Imitrex... Such as the brain fog and delayed reactions... Eye constantly tearing (and cluster headache usually happens with the tearing_ which looks kinda like Bells palsy) Hot flashes_ perspiration_ and loss of appetite. If you are a true migraine sufferer_ this drug is a miracle for relief.  Main side effect is def the muscular tightening_ hence everyone's experiencing of throat and chest tightness...

113, 5, Migraines,None,I am prescribed 100mg they are cheaper to purchase. I split them in half_ and use when needed. My first migrain was when I was 12 years old I am now 50. Imitrex has been a life saver for me. I never leave home without it. Best and most effective if used at first onset of migrain. I also take ibuprofen for pain.  Within 15/20 minutes I am migrain symtom free_ but possibly at times still feel the after effects of the onset_ but because I also take ibuprofen that heads off any pain.  I do not always have the luxury of lying down in a dark room_ but just a small mini rest with eyes closed really helps.

To this day I am still using either the tablets or the injection_ and I still am having a problem trying to load the pen. Sometimes it will load real easy but that is on rare days! Or it will get partially loaded and then when I pull the pen out the medication box it goes shooting across the room and the last but not least the syringe will load into the pen but it isn't plunged down enough and the syringe will just be in the pen.There has to be some other way to load this. It is bad enough when I have a migraine and I can't see my head is pounding and then I have to fight trying to get the damn thing loaded!The medication is great for getting rid of my migraines.

116, 5, migraines,tight jaw_ weakness in arms_ fatigue_ slowed reaction time_ dazed feeling.,Imitrex is the only medication that has worked for me.  I started getting migraines in the second grade and was finally prescribed this three years ago. The only down side is that the side effects hit me kinda hard_ so I only trust taking the medication at home and I do not drive after taking it.  Also_ Imitrex does not really help my nausea so at times I have to take 25 mg of promethazine to keep the imitrex down_ which greatly contributes to the fatigue side effect.  However_ it works and gets rid of my headache quickly.,F,26,3  years100 mg 6X M,12/9/2011,Imitrex

The worst side effect is that it makes my thoat feel like its swelling_ and like I can't swallow (but I can).   I use it in pill form and it takes about 10 minutes to feel the side effects_ they last about 15 minutes_ then my headache goes away very quickly (almost momentarily - not a gradual relief) and I get a_ kind of euphoric feeling.

Tightness in chest.,Before the cost of Maxalt was reduced my dr. gave me a few Imitrex to try.  Worst experience I've ever had with a migraine medication.  My body felt like it was squeezed in a vice_ or I was covered in plastic wrap that was shrinking.  The migraine got worse.  My back hurt for days and my joints were very sore.  The migraine was still there after a few days so I coughed up the $100 for a Maxalt refill and finally got relief.

It is very expensive: I have to pay $80.00 for 9 pills (even the generic version)_ but it's worth it!  My headaches are definitely related to my menstrual cycle_ always strongest just before_ during_ and after my period but also coming on during ovulation too_ which pretty much covers the whole month.  I usually wake up with a migraine but they can also come on at random times throughout the day.  I don't believe they are stress-related as some doctors claim.  My 20 year old daughter has just started getting regular migraines_ and Imitrex works for her as well. My 13 year old son also gets migraines_ but the doc says boys sometimes grow out of them at puberty_ which I'm praying for so he doesn't have to suffer all his life. Pain starts in my shoulders with full-body aches and flu-like symptoms growing_ and the pain in my head getting stronger.  If a full-blown migraine sets in_ Imitrex can take up to an hour or two to work_ but it cures my migraine almost every single time I take it.

As with all drugs_ this may work for some people_ and in other people not at all. If you are desperate for relief_ at least try it and see if it works for you.

The migraine did not subside after 2 hrs and some had recommended taking a second dose_ so I took another 50 mg.  I was quite nauseated_ but kept it down.  Difficult to say whether intensity of migraine and nausea at this point was due to imitrex or was my typical ramping up...very typical for my migraines to get worse a few hours they start and for me to start vomiting at this point.  I went to bed for another 4 hrs and nausea subsided-headache got a bit better_ but not entirely. I usually take ibuprofen_ so I asked pharmacist if I could take it after taking Imitrex.  He said yes_ and some meds are coming out with both.  I took 400 mg of ibuprofen and 2 hrs later the migraine was pretty much gone (I always have a dull ached for rest of day..)!  Hmmm.

If the Imitrex doesn't work right away for you (and you didn't wait); then you probably do not have a migraine.  You need to take Imitrex right when you know you are getting a migraine so DO NOT WAIT thinking the pain will go away_ it won't!

I've been getting cluster headaches since I was 19 or 20 years old serving in the US Army. Each cluster headache cycle comes back every 1.5 to 2 years like clockwork and they last from 3 to 6 weeks. I used to scream_ cry_ be in a total state of desperation_ rolled on floor holding my head and back of my neck_ take a fetal position in a hot shower while kicking and humming_ jump to a cool pool after the hot shower and then go back to the shower...its not called suicide headaches for anything. I get 3 to 4 episodes a day during a cycle. My neurologist allows me to take up to 3 a day. I start counting in my mind as soon as I take the shot and sometimes I have not reached 60 and feel the cluster going away...sometimes I make it to 200 or 300...but I feel almost immediate relief. Against my neurologist indications I have frequently taken that extra shot when I have had 4-episodes days. The pain is just unbearable so I take my chances.

I have often been convinced I was minutes from death because the pain was so awful.  I have several headaches a month and sometimes several in a week.  I thank God for the researchers who discovered sumatriptan.  I also thank God for Costco_ who charges less for my entire prescription than my grocery pharmacy charges for a single pill.,F,50,8  years100mg 1X AN,2/27/2010,Imitrex
201, 3, migraines,Full almost tingling in back of neck_ very thirsty_ tired_ difficulty swallowing.,Took away my migraine_ but almost not worth the side effects. This is the second time I've tried it. I usually take maxalt_ but as my husband just got laid off I no longer have insurance.I can't afford 9 maxalt for $200. I CAN afford 9 imitrex (generic version) for $40. Luckily since I've been taking nortriptilene for almost a year_ I'm down to about one migraine a month. So I'll take the side effects over the pain.

The side effects (for me) are severe.  I have read other posters saying that people ""exaggerate"" about this medication's side effects; I just think the medicine is different for everyone.  Everyone responds to it differetly.  For me_ I have symptoms resembling a heart attack/panic attack for several hours after taking the medication.  The side effects tend to interfere with my daily life_ but to a much lesser extent than the migraine did.  The medicine is worth it for me_ but only sparingly.",F,23,5  months 1X AN,2/9/2010,Imitrex

The only symptom that remains after that is a flu-like fatigue that can last for a day.",I used to go to the ER for demerol and/or took narcotic painkillers.  Or I would just suffer through 2-3 days of packing my head in ice and avoiding light and sound.  I can usually catch my symptoms early enough that the Imitrex actually stops the migraine.

If you have true-blue migraines_ it will work_ and it feels like a warm blanket covering your head and taking the pain away.  Before Imitrex I had to go to the ER for morphine or demerol.  I can control it myself with Imitrex.  I have tried all the triptans_ and they all work--but Imitrex seems to work best for me with the least side effects.  I sure wish the insurance companies will someday realize that 9 pills a month just isn't enough for some of us w/migraines_ and a trip to the ER is going to cost them alot more than extra Imitrex pills a month!,F,37,4  years,1/15/2010,Imitrex

Sometimes I feel groggy for a few hours after the headache quits. I need to wait 1 hour after eating or drinking in order to prevent vomitting immediately after injection. The pills and nasal spray do not work for me_ but the 6mg injection is like magic. Cost is a factor_ but worth every penny.,F,65,6  years,1/13/2010,Imitrex

I have to take at least 50 mg. 3-5 times a week_ since I have chronic migraines.  I don't understand why these meds are rationed to people who suffer with migraines.

210, 5, Migraines,Sensitive fingertips_ drowsiness_ achiness,Like many here_ I started taking Imitrex when it first came out and it gave me my life back.  Prior to Imitrex_ I would try anything to get rid of a migraine... megadoses of aspirin worked best (13 ultra-buffered tablets seemed to be my lucky number) but the ringing in my ears told me this was not a good thing really.  After I bought my first Imitrex kit but before using it_ the first death associated with Imitrex was reported and my mom kindly mailed the news story to me... :]  Thanks_ mom.  I worked in a hospital_ so at the next migraine I took my kit up to the ER and injected myself there_ *just in case.*  I didn't die_ the migraine melted away in 10 minutes or so (!!!!)_ and I was well pleased.  I have tried the inhaler... *** hated it. ***  Injections work the fastest.  Tablets work best if I catch the headache early_ but if one doesn't work I will use an injection to save my day.  Also my insurance company has switched to generic which is working for me just as well as brand name.  Rarely do the migraines come back after a shot (only happens the day before period begins on some cycles).  Did get to the point where headaches were nearly daily_ and have been on generic Topamax daily so the headaches are less than a few a week now on average.  I am hopeful that menopause will shut them down_ as happened with my mom.,F,48,18  years,12/29/2009,Imitrex
211, 5, Migraines,No side effects.,Worked like a miracle drug for fifteen years_ until about a year ago_ when it seemed to take more and more of the drug to actually work. For example_ a half a pill used to do it. Now_ it takes a whole pill. Also_ my headaches have increased in frequency_ up to as many as 12 a month. My Doctor recently put me on Topamax as a preventative measure_ but I still take Imitrex as needed. It always works.,F,42,15  years,12/26/2009,Imitrex
212, 3, migranes,I went to the hospital with heart palpitations. I never had a single heart problem before I started taking the medication. It's the meds fault. And my doctor's for not warning me of the side effects.,The medicine works FANTASTIC for headaches. I get headaches that last for three or four days three or four times a month. They only prescribe you fifteen of these at a time. I always wondered about that. Then something got me researching the drug and I came across this website. I couldn't believe it when I read that other people are having these heart problems. I'm 37 years old and I smoke. I blamed it on the cigarettes. I'm sure they don't help_ but I NEVER had the heart problems before. Then the doctors blamed it on the stress when I went to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack. I've been stressed my whole life. I got married and had a baby when I was 19. So yeah. It's not the stress. By now I've learned how to deal with stress in a very healthy way.It's the imitrex.It caused me to have heart palpitations.,F,37,6  months,12/22/2009Email,Imitrex
213, 4, chronic migraines,burning_ nausea_ tingling_ dizziness,50mg dosage. After the first 15 to 30 minutes I experience an intense burning in the arteries in my chest_ neck_ and arms. This can be accompanied by nausea_ tingling_ and dizziness. The sensations subside after at least an hour. My migraine will usually also disappear after an hour and a half. Occasionally I will have to repeat the dose and I will have a 'hangover' from the medication the next day. It's certainly preferable to the migraine. Two other family members took this medication for several years and never had these problems with it_ but took it in much higher doses. The medication also never fully stopped their migraines.,M,26,8  years,12/21/2009,Imitrex
214, 4, menstrual migranes,I started out using the 50mg rate and it sort of worked_ sometimes.  My doctor upped the rate to 100mg_ and it worked great. I have a migraine for about 2 weeks around my cycle.  When I stopped taking the meds the other two weeks I have  noticed my thoughts are not connecting in my head and I am more confused.  I have stopped taking it and hope my head comes around_ because right now I find it hard to concentrate.  I will not take Imitrex again.,,F,39,5  months,12/19/2009,Imitrex
215, 5, migraine,lightheadedness_ sleepiness,Imitrex has been a lifesaver for me.  I've suffered with migraines for 45 years.  For many of those years_ my headaches were frequent and severe_ sometimes lasting 3 days and resulting in vomiting and the lack of ability to do much_  other than stay in bed in a dark_ quiet room. About 15 years ago_ I heard of the newly-approved Imitrex and started using it whenever I get a migraine.   I've had very good success with it as migraine relief_ although every so often I have to take two pills.  Also_ there are some times that the headache simply will not go away_ but that's rare.  The frequency of my headaches has not changed_ however.  I still get them 4-8 times per month.  Imitrex is not a preventative_ but it is not advertized as such.,F,66,15  years,11/28/2009Email,Imitrex

A year ago - I started taking 60mg of Inderal LA (usually prescribed for blood pressure) daily... It has helped me TREMENDOUSLY!!!  Only rare migraine pain now.

I got kind of flushed and my head felt weird and I fell asleep for about 15-20 min and I woke up and my migraine was gone.  I was almost in tears I was so happy!  I could not believe it.  My migraines usually last between 1-4 days.  I'd go to the ER and get something that would ""manage"" the pain_ but nothing would actually get rid of it.  A doctor came into my room and asked me a bunch of questions and sent me home with some Imitrex auto-injectors.  I've used the auto-injectors for a long time and they never fail to alleviate my migraine within 15-20 min.  Whoever developed this medicine is truly amazing.",F,37,16  years,11/8/2009,Imitrex

222, 5, Common Migraine,Tingly feeling all over_ headache intensifies for a brief time before it gets better_ sore throat_ jittery.,This is really a 'miracle drug.'  I've been getting migraines since about 1989 and took Midrin before Imitrex became available.  Midrin worked_ but it knocked me out for the whole day.  I was in college when the Imitrex injections came out and I'm terrified of needles_ but the injection was amazing_ so the needle didn't bother me anymore.  I often feel like I need to eat something after I've had the Imitrex because my throat hurts_ but then it sort of hurts to swallow.  While the headache goes away and all of the symptoms in about 30 minutes or so_ I still feel so wiped out from the headache.  I do have to say_ however_ that I am VERY nervous about trying anything BUT Imitrex because I know it works for me and I don't want to risk having to endure a wicked migraine.,M,37,17  years,10/16/2009,Imitrex
223, 4, Migraine headache for 15 years,very interesting.  mostly sensitivity to heat on hands.  sleepiness if taken at night-sleep longer and deeper.  very bad reaction if taken with alcohol_ or if there is alcohol in my system.,"My first injection of Imitrex was in the 90's_ shortly after it was introduce.  I had a friend who had bad migraines.  She would end up in the hospital.  She was the person who convinced me that that was what was going on with me.  I just called them my ""spells"" and would pop Tylenol in huge quantities for days.  The injection took the pain (and all the other stuff one has with migraine) right away.  It was a miracle.  I used the injections until the pills came out_ and have been fine-tuning their use ever since.  One of the most important things I've learned is what triggers my migraines.  That took a VERY long time.  My very worst trigger is MSG_ or any of the other flavor enhancing chemicals added to most processed food nowadays.  I don't know what I would do if I hadn't figured that out.  Alcohol is also a factor_ but only in certain amounts and at certain times of the month.  Those times are hard to predict as I am 60 years old and left menopause years ago.  It has taken many years to figure out how to take Imitrex without it actually making my headache worse_ which will happen if any of the substance which triggers it is still in my system.  It's a tough life_ not being able to eat at restaurants (most of them_ anyway).  My advice to people is to look at what they eat.  And research the other names for MSG on the internet.",F,60,15  years,10/13/2009Email,Imitrex

While in hospital doctor put me on Imitrex. Been on imitrex for 8 years now. I really believe that I am experiencing rebound headaches caused by the imitrex. I'm back in the same situation I was in before with asprin. Doctor did not inform me of this side effect. I have been so depressed having to deal with these everyday rebound headaches.

229, 5, Migraine headaches,None at first. But the last year or so I experience a tightness in the chest and some difficulty breathing after taking 3-4 injections in a short period of time.,I have been taking Imitrex 6mg injections since 1997. For the first several years I only needed one or two shots per year. The injections worked great_ relieved even the worst migraine in about 20 minutes_ and I had virtually no side effects. However_ for the past 3 years or so_ I have needed more and more to keep the headaches from coming back. The initial injection normally works_ but the headaches come back_ sometimes for 3 or 4 days_ and I need to take more to keep them away. In fact_ between Aug 1_ 2008 and July 31_ 2009_ I took 39 injections. I worry because I have read of potential damage to your heart from this drug. But I also feel that it is worth the risk during the horrendous pain of a migraine attack. My doctor - a migraine specialist - says that there is really nothing stronger that I can take. I am wondering if there is any research indicating that people can become immune to this drug.,F,44,12  years,8/1/2009Email,Imitrex

Cognitive difficulties - difficulty concentrating_ reduction of inhibitions_ difficulty with complex analysis.Note: some side effects are hard to differentiate from migraine effects.  I have found ANY aborted migraine has physical and cognitive effects the following day_ even if a different treatment is utilized.,For migraine sufferers_ triptans (like Imitrex_ Maxalt_ etc.) are an almost certain cure.  I prefer to deal with ANY medication side effects_ rather than a set-in migraine_ which is the worst pain I've ever experienced - even worse than 32 hours of unmedicated back labor.NOTE: serotonin levels typically decrease before a migraine; triptans increase serotonin.  Here's another abortive that has worked for me:  2 Aleve and two 5-HTP (tryptophan_ an amino acid).  Tryptophan is found in poultry and is what makes us sleepy from eating turkey.  Tryptophan is also a chemical precursor to serotonin_ passes the blood-brain barrier_ and increases serotonin levels in the brain.  This combination of Aleve and 5-HTP has aborted 3 migraines for me_ with no side effects the following day.,F,34,6  years,7/24/2009,Imitrex

Tho I'm getting older and a couple of doctors have suggested I shouldn't take it_ I'm fortunate enough to have a doctor now who suggests no limits for me.  I have daily (on average) headaches_ mostly tension-headaches leading soon to migraine.  Imitrex always works.  I've told everyone if they kill me_ I'd rather die than suffer for the rest of my life with migraines.  I've come to this site just to check out prevalence of sleep after Imitrex.  Common!  Perhaps more so with age?   It contributes (along with other drugs) to dopeyness for some hours.

For a mild migraine_ I can take 25 mg of Imitrex and one Aleve_ lose the migraine within 30 minutes_ and never have any side effects.  If I have to take as much as 100 mg of imitrex_ I still feel sleepy and intoxicated_ but have none of the other symptoms.  I've heard that Treximet and Maxalt have the same medicine in them as Aleve_ but now that Imitrex comes in generic form_ it's cheaper for me to buy a bottle of Aleve than try one of those new meds.

242, 5, Cluster Headache,The only side effect I experienced was with the imitrex injections. I was having 5 clusters a day and was using to many injections. The imitrex injections was causing more headaches from using too much. I have had no side effects of the imitrex pills. However because it is cluster headaches the pills only work if I take them before I go to sleep. That way I prevent the headache before it comes on. The cluster becomes full blown in ten minutes but it takes the pill twenty minutes to work so the only way for the pill to work is to take it before I go to sleep.,I have had cluster headaches since I was a teenager. They come along every year and a half to two years. They last three weeks to six months. During the cluster period I have them every night and sometimes during the day. My insurance will only cover the imitrex injections or the pills every twenty four days. I get two shots or nine pills every twenty four days. The rest of the time I have to deal with the pain. Any suggestions are welcome.,F,53,20  years,6/3/2009Email,Imitrex
243, 1, Cluster headaches/migraines,I took it once and it relieved the headache_ but the side effects have been HORRIFYING!!! I could not walk_ my tongue was swollen_ couldn't swallow_ dry mouth_ felt like collar bone was broken_ entire body ached severely- joints & muscles_ worst of all.. my forearms hurt so badly I can't even pick up our 1 yr old. I have no feeling in my fingertips and cannot hold a pencil or a fork. It has been 4 days and only 1 50mg dose. I have been totally debilitated. I am worried the damage could be permanent.,It's just not natural or normal to treat your body this way. I would NOT receommend this to my worst enemy.,M,40,1  days,5/31/2009Email,Imitrex
244, 5, Cluster Headaches,The injection experience is one with a set group of sensations. First_ within 3 minutes of the injection_ there is an additional_ short ramping up of the pain level of the cluster headache. This is followed by a gradual_ with each breath_ alleviation of all symptoms of the intense pain. The only time I had a side effect was taking it once while overheated in the sun. I developed a large welt around the injection site that ceded within 30-45 minutes.,Imitrex injections are incredibly effective for me and as a cluster headache sufferer have changed my life.,M,47,3  years,5/27/2009,Imitrex
245, 5, Migraines,After I first take it_ I feel strange.  It's a feeling similar to an adrenaline rush that_ when over_ leaves me feeling weak_ tired_ and shaky. I also get an unpleasant tingling sensation in my jaws when I bite into food_ but this only lasts through the first several bites.  The good news is that once the side effects are gone (within an hour) the headache is too.  Sometimes the headache comes back; I don't know if that would be classified as a rebound headache_ or if it's a particularly stubborn headache that would have lasted a few days anyway.,I take this medicine 1-4 times a month for mild to moderate migraines_ and it's been quite effective.  I could do without the side effects_ but I don't take the pill unless I'm already suffering_ and I'd rather suffer a few additional symptoms for an hour or so than drag around with a migraine for 1-3 days.,F,39,15  years,5/10/2009,Imitrex
246, 1, migraine doctor gave me this,i took the pill. when to eat with my husband. then with my first bite of food my jaw started to lock up_ I stopped_ perplexed_ tried again_ this time burning sensations through my gums/jaw and face.

247, 4, Migraines,Tightness_ tingling_ burning_ slightly uncomfortable_ didn't want to eat,I am new to taking Imitrex and my doctor had told me about the side effects. I didn't realize what he really meant until I took it for a migraine I felt coming on (7:30 PM). I was watching a movie with my son and we were eating popcorn. All of a sudden I felt really uncomfortable. I had a sunburn on my arms and the back of my neck and it started burning like someone had a hot pan on it and it almost felt like it was going to bleed. My chest became tight and I had a tingling in my head. The uncomfortableness lasted until I went to bed (10 PM). By that time the headache was gone. Yes this medicine works and I can deal with the side effects.,F,27,3  weeks,5/4/2009,Imitrex
248, 5, Migraine,I generally feel a slight heaviness in shoulders within the first 30 minutes after taking pill. I have also noticed a stinging_ tingling sensation in my jaw off and on during the first few hours after taking the pill (noticeable_ but not painful per se).  Other than that_ just moderate drowsiness.,The side effects I mentioned are mostly mild_ and are very much worth the payoff -- no migraine headache!  This medicine has made my quality of life so much better.,F,31,1  years,4/8/2009,Imitrex

I wouldn't take another one of these pills if you gave me a million dollars.If you are having neck and sholder pain after taking it STOP NOW.  There is a good chance that will get worse and not go away.,This stuff is crap.  My own dr. wondered how my healthy heart would be effected after being on it.

They peak about 30 minutes after taking the pill_ then gradually fade away over the next twenty minutes or so.  When they are gone_ so is my headache!  Usually.  Occasionally the imitrex does not work.  I have realized that I only experience the side effects when the drug is working.

Feel like a can't breath well at times,The side effects do scare me for fear of a heart attack.  I have been taking alot of imitrex lately.  I do not like the side effects but this has seemed to be the only thing to get rid of my migraine.  I have taken everything possible over the counter and nothing will touch my headache.

The side effects while using this medicine were mild and included; injection site left a whelp (temporary)_ skin sensitive to hot water and sunburn_ mild tighness in the chest.  I had no history of heart disease and no heart conditions prior to this heart attack!!!  Be aware!!,I loved this medicine until it almost killed me with two heart attacks at age 39!!!  It was nearly always effective and it made my life  wonderful.  I used it for 15 years!!!  Trust me when I tell you that I wouldn't have stopped taking it except for the fact that it caused me to have a spasm in my heart resulting in two heart attacks!  The only reason it did not actually kill me was the location of the damage on my heart.  I have three small children_ you can imagine how horrible it would have been if I had not been so blessed to survive.

I have taken it for years_ haven't heard of or noticed any long term side effects_ hopefully there won't be any.,Have taken the pill for many years. Works better than Relpax. And better than the new Treximet_ which I think is a gimmick to make up for loss of patent. Sometimes 50 mg would work if I took it early enough_ but usually had to take 100 mg. The 4 mg injection works much better and faster with less side effects. The pain of injection is nothing compared to migraine.

I believe the 2nd or 3rd migraine I get is rebound. I have a migraine as I write and am going to try with Extra Strength Execedrin today instead of the Imitrex.

260, 5, migraine-severe,rapid heartbeat- nervousness- anxiety- tingling hands -feet- swallowing problems ect.,You have to take the SAMLLEST amount of this drug that you can tolerate- you cannot take the whole pill- it is too much for anyone's system.  Try cutting the pills in half and then again in half- This pill causes alot of cardiac-related problems - start out taking a VERY small amount FIRST- then increase if you need to - do not take the whole 50 mgs- and the sprays are to dangerous- they are not adjustable to your body- ask for the pills only- that way you have control over your own medication.I've suffered for 15 yrs with them- you have to see what workd for you and NOT let the docs talk you out of what works for you or what doesn't work- you are in control of you- ,F,48,15  years,1/24/2009,Imitrex

On rare occasions (most often when I take it too late_ or when the migraine is particularly bad) it does not do anything...but most of the time_ it works within 1-2 hours. The worst part is the extreme drowsiness- if I have to go to work_ I wait until I get there and then take it_ so that I don't have to drive. I can't concentrate as well_ however my level of concentration would be much worse with a migraine instead. I find that the side effects are typically worse during the first few hours_ and then gradually subside. Still_ I am very careful when driving and try to drink coffee if I must drive. I have suffered from migraines since I was four years old_ and this medicine has changed my life. I no longer spend 2-3 days per month in bed in a darkened room.

It did nothing for my migraines and I was hoping for something that would make it at least bearable to get through the day.  I'm not looking for a miracle here.

I do think the menstrual cramps can be worse for a short time_ but that's nothing compared to good migraine relief.  Take it when you first suspect a migraine_ don't wait.  Why wait when you can be over and done with it?  But if you wait_ it will still work in most cases.  I may take a nap with it at the beginning or I may take a walk.

The Dr. said I have sinus allergies that triger the migrains_ but I think they are hereditary_ my mother had them_ also my brother_ and my oldest son_ and a granddaughter. I am so thankful someone discovered Imitrex.,F,73,10  years,9/19/2008,Imitrex
291, 1, cluster headaches,shortly after taking 1 100mg tablet I experienced crushing chest pain_ chest wall tightness radiating to my shoulders and jaw. I had nausea and sweating as well as a sore throat. I was sicker than the actual headache.,I was given Imitrex by my primary MD.  I will not be taking again until my neurologist sees me.,F,43,1  days,9/14/2008,Imitrex
292, 2, severe headaches,profuse sweating_ nausea_ chest tightness_ chest heaviness_ shortness of breath_ arm tingling (basically_ a heart attack),"I just had a 5 day hospital stay for ""severe adverse reaction"" to Imitrex.  It was the first and last time I will ever take it.  100mg.  I am allergic to sulfa drugs_ and I just found out that some who are allergic to sulfa are also allergic to Imitrex.",F,42,1  days,9/5/2008,Imitrex
293, 3, Migraine,With 100mg pills tightness in chest and neck for 45 minutes then relief. With injection_ sometimes no reaction_ sometimes pain immediately intensifies for 20 minutes_ then feel relief.,Although I get relief_ I do not like either the pills or injectable. I prefer the injectable_ but hate that sometimes my head feels like it's going to explode after injecting it. I lay down for 20-30 minutes_ and then feel human again. I use to get several migraines a month and have figured out what most of my migraine triggers are_ food preservatives/additives_ toxic chemicals like household cleaning products_ paint_ gasoline_ etc_ also purfume/air fresheners_ cheese_ vinegar_ onions_spicy spices_ alcohol (any)_ and soybeans. In the last 8 months I've only had 3 migraines due to avoiding things that cause them. It took a long time to figure it out_ and did it through a process of elimination.,F,51,3  years,8/21/2008,Imitrex
294, 4, Migraines,Tightness and pain in neck region,I switched from Relpax to Imitrex about 3 months ago - due to having the same symptoms on Relpax. I believe that the Imitrex takes longer to work and is only effective 75% of the time for me. Could be because sometimes I wait too long to take it. The Relpax seemed to work quicker but did make me more lethargic shortly after taking it. I take the 100mg tablets. I have suffered from migraines for about 20 years - and they are becoming worse.,F,33,3  months,8/6/2008,Imitrex
295, 5, Migraines,Tightness in jaw and neck_ warm sensation throughout body(mostly my face)_ sleepiness,Works so great! I would take the side effects any day to an actual migraine.  It usually takes about 20-30 minutes and works the same if I take it at onset or during.  Switched from Zomig because the side effects were too much like an allergic reaction.,F,24,6  months,7/31/2008,Imitrex
296, 4, increasingly debilitating migraines,Hangover feeling - puffy tingling fingers (like too much beer or shrimp) - fuzzy brain_ thirsty_ achy neck and shoulders.,I always debate whether or not to take it; have to decide if the oncoming headache or the side effects will be best at the time.  With a completely debilitating migraine that I let go too long_ I got my first shot of Imitrex - a little sleep and I was human again.  Now I use the pills.,F,48,7  months,7/31/2008Email,Imitrex
297, 5, Migraines,Tingling_ Fatigue_ and if taken too often rebound headaches,my biggest complaint with Imitrex is that it makes my skin hypersensitive.

298, 5, Severe migraines,"Relief from debilitating migraine pain.  Best side effect ever.  There does seem to be a momentary warm ""washing"" feeling the moment the pill takes affect_ but it's not a bad feeling.",This is my miracle drug.  I want to find the researcher that discovered this and bow down and kiss their feet.  My migraines would last anywhere from 4 to 10 days and were so severe_ the ends of my hair would shoot bolts of pain through me if touched.  The longer I'm on it_ the less often and less severe my migraines are.  The wonderful part of this medicine is that it's not only non-habit-forming_ my body never gets used to it so I never have to increase my dosage_ and I only have to take it when I have a migraine or feel one coming on.  I've been taking the Imitrex tablets now for 8 years.  I've had migraines for 51 years.  Too bad there wasn't something for migraines before.,F,59,8  years,7/19/2008,Imitrex

300, 5, migraines,none,This drug has been nothing short of a godsend for me.  I never_ ever leave my home without it.  However_ I've tried to limit my usage of it_ after reading about the side effects others have experienced.  That said_ after 4 years on 25mg_ I did have to up the dosage recently_ to 50mg.  For those who suffer debilitating migraines_ this drug is truly heaven-sent.,F,31,4  years,6/28/2008,Imitrex
301, 4, severe migraines,Tightness in throat_ sleepiness,I started taking this drug the minute it became available to me in 1993(injectable form). It saved my life_ allowed me to be a Mom and have a career. After years of migraines_ they have slowed significantly with menopause_ which is good_ since you aren't supposed to take it post menopause. I had to use injectable form for years because of nausea_ but most recently had taken tables.,F,52,15  years,6/27/2008,Imitrex
302, 5, Severe Migraines,Imitrex makes me feel a little strange shortly after taking it. Sometimes I like to take a breif nap to sleep through the fuzzy feeling.  I also noticed that taking a hot shower soon after the imitrex pill makes the water feel like needles on my skin.  Oh ya_ it makes me have to go pee like every 10 minutes.,LIFE SAVER!! I have been on several daily medications to prevent migraines and several on the spot pills like imitrex (including frova for menstrual migraines which did nothing).  Imitrex works great. Sometimes for terrible migraines I will take one pill and a second a few hours later.,F,26,2  years,6/20/2008,Imitrex
303, 1, Migraines,Imitrex put me in the hospital. I had no previous heart issues. Once it gave me severe chest pains_ another fluttering of the heart_ so I informed my doctor who told me to half the dose. I did so. I experienced a serious heart issue which caused me to faint. I injured myself pretty bad... lacerations to the face_ head_ black eye_ and split lip. The cardiology team believes my heart stopped pumping blood momentarily.,This drug is not safe. I am lucky to be alive after taking it.,F,29,6  months,6/16/2008,Imitrex
304, 2, Cluster Headaches/Migranes,Loss of balance_ slow moving--drugged out feeling like I had taken a bunch of Vicodin.  Chest pain and burning...

305, 4, sever migraines,tingling in the mouth and throat,God bless the makers of Imitrex..before the creation of this there was NOTHING that helped me. I might have to repeat it every four hours BUT it does give me amazing help!  Sometimes it does not completely wipe out the headache but it makes it so I can stand it...often it will wipe out the pain for 4 hours..I may need it every 4 hours for three days_ but it is WELL worth it.  I am now taking Topomax as well.  I have had severe chronic migraines for over half of my life. This drug is such a blessing,F,51,10  years,6/7/2008Email,Imitrex
306, 5, migraine,i take the injections.  I take them at least once a week and have done for many years.  i have to lie down_ or if at my desk at work put my head down for a few very drowsy moments.  Pins and needles in scalp and back of throat.  but have come to welcome these feelings_ as I know relief is very soon to come.  Same with the pain of injection - it is nothing once you get used to it_ and relief comes within 10 minutes.,This drug has greatly_ greatly enhanced my life.  The injections work far_ far better then the pills.  My neurologist explained that by the time you take the pills_ your stomach has shut down_ and this may interfere with absorption.  I sometimes take the pills as a preventative measure for a situation I know will cause a migraine_ like an overseas flight.  I do worry_ very much_ about the long term impacts of taking this drug_ but have made the personal decision that it is worth it_ because_ bottom line_ it allows me to function almost like a normal person.,F,54,10  years,5/31/2008,Imitrex
307, 4, Recurring Migraines,Started w/ Esophygal spasms. Now have muscle weakness & pain.,It gets rid of the migraine_ but gives me severe indigestion. The more I use it_ the more muscle pain I seem to have. Especially if I need a second dose (100 mg tablets)_ my feet ache_ calves and knees get involved. Some days can't walk without limping for hours_ but the migraine does stop. It tends to come back in 24-30 hours and does the same over about 3-3 1/2 days.,F,45,3  years,5/27/2008Email,Imitrex
308, 4, Migrane,I have taken this medication 4 times_ and the side effects lesened with time. The first time_ however_ was horrible: It felt like someone spread wasabi in between the skin and muscle on my face and down my throat. It hurt to smile and swallow_ so I drooled with a dumb look on my face for an hour or so. I did try the medication a second time when I was stuck for a solution (weekend migrane & didn't feel like going to the ER) and the side effects were similar but MUCH lower in severity.,It is OK - I honestly much prefer the 3 drug butalbital cocktail that is falling out of favor due to it's addictive properties_ but this is an OK substitute. It does get rid of the migrane_ and I am back to normal within anhour or two.,F,29,2  months,5/23/2008,Imitrex
309, 2, Migraine,Feeling very hot_ nausea and vomiting_ sleepiness.,I started on the 50mg sample tablets that my DR. gave me 2 years ago.  It was a miracle drug.  Headache was gone within 30 minutes_ maybe a bit sleepy for a while.  My prescription is for the 100mg tablets.  Both times I've taken it_ the headache disappears very quickly_ but then I become VERY nauseous.  The first time (last month) I felt very hot and nauseous.  I actually thought I had a virus since the headache never went away.  Yesterday I tried again with a 100mg tablet.  The headache went away quickly_ but the nausea and vomiting was unbearable.  I will ask my DR. for a smaller dose or something else.,F,38,2  years,5/11/2008,Imitrex
310, 5, Severe Migraines,Side effects of both 50-100mg. tabs. and inj. are fatigue and dry mouth. But_ hey_ so-o-o much better than debilitating migraine!!,I have SUFFERED miserably w/migraines since 17. So I went through years w/out meds that worked. Imitrex tabs and injections are truly a Godsend to me as I know life before! My daughter also takes Imitrex but a lower dose according to weight_ which might make the difference for some of these people on these posts with adverse reactions. Only hope for a generic soon!,F,59,15  years,4/29/2008,Imitrex
311, 3, Migraines,Have taken 50mg Imitrex approximately 5 times in the past with only positive results. After working a 12hr shift in Emergency and on my way home from work felt that a migraine was coming on as I began to lose my vision (aura).-- Approximately 20min after taking the med I felt palpitations and then heavy pressure centered in my sternum. I then started feeling extreme tightness in my throat/neck with radiating pain from chest through my neck to my right jaw. I began sweating and had left shoulder pain. I was also experiencing tingling and headache related to the migraine.I took myself to a different ER than I had worked and found my blood pressure was 220/108 and I am normally 115/70. The heavy mid-sternal chest pressure and radiating jaw pain started to subside after 1/2hr from taking the medication_but I remained with background pain mostly in my throat and shoulder blade for a few hours.I remained in hospital due to abnormalities in my ECG (flipped t-waves) probably not associat,I have had very rare migraines for 30 years_ with approximately 12 episodes over that time. When I was given Imitrex 100mg for the first time approx 7-8 yrs ago it worked very well but left me extremely tired and lethargic for >24hrs. I then used 50 mg (1/2 tab) with good effect and less lethargy. I still have a low grade headache when I use the drug that lasts up to 12 hours_ but it is very manageable.This was my 6th time taking the drug and hopefully this wont happen again as I plan to stay with the drug for migraines. Options are limited for effective treatment for migraines. I am lucky I only have a migraine every 2-3 yrs. Before Imitrex I was disabled by the symptoms which would leave me with facial_ arm and some torso parasthesia (numbness and tingling) vomiting and a headache that would last 2 days.,M,45,7  years,4/29/2008,Imitrex
312, 5, severe migraines,"my side effects pale in comparison to my migraine. I actually get a warm fuzzy feeling throughout my body_ it's as if I feel my blood running through my veins (in a good way). It works very quickly as long as I will just be still for a short time after taking it to let it work. It's almost like a high that I experience_ but that could be the relief of my migraine being relieved. :) If I take the pill form at the onset_ it works within 20 minutes or so. If I wake up with a full blown migraine_ I take the shot. The shot is instant. I feel the ""magic"" as soon as it enters my bloodstream. AMAZING!",Imitrex is a medication that I swear by but I do believe everyone has to at least try it for themselves. It either works for you or it doesn't. If it doesn't_ good luck finding one that does. If it does_ you'll understand that any side effect way outweighs the misery of the migraine. I honestly called it a miracle drug. My life would not have been the same the last 4 years without it.,F,33,4  years,4/26/2008,Imitrex
313, 4, ,Tight throat_ tingling leg_ funny taste in the mouth,A magic bullet. I started getting migraines over the last year and have used this for 1-3 headaches per month. I didn't have the throat and leg side effects until my refill accidentally bumped the dose to 50mg. I'd been fine on 25mg. I see many people here are on 100mg and having side effects. Maybe try a lower dose. I'm going to try going back to 25mg to see if it will eliminate the side effects. Experience has taught me that taking Imitrex immediately when you sense just a hint of an impending headache gives the best results.,F,38,8  months,4/22/2008,Imitrex
314, 5, Migraines,Next day my face and skin is very warm/hot. Thats the only side effect I have noticed.,I take the injections. Best thing I have ever taken for migraines. Works in under 30 mins. This is a miracle drug_ have been using it for about 5 years now.,M,30,5  years,4/21/2008,Imitrex
315, 3, Migraine,Extreme tightness/heaviness in neck and shoulders within around 30 minutes after the second dose.  Neck and shoulders completely locked up.,First dose worked somewhat_ but only briefly.  Headache returned_ so took second dose around 2.5 hours after first.  Both doses 50 milligrams.  Three hours after second dose_ headache MUCH better_ actually nearly gone_ but neck and shoulder pain pretty brutal.  Don't think I will take it again_ since this side effect is pretty scary.  I have a long history of back and neck pain and do not wanna go there!  This is only the second Migraine medication I've tried_ so would like to try something else to see if I can't get better overall results.  Takes care of the headache a little better than the Fiorinal.,F,46,2  times,4/21/2008,Imitrex
316, 3, Migraine,fatigue_ numbness and tingling in hands and legs;  rebound headaches,Imitrex does provide relief when migraine is most severe but for me_ it causes more headaches when used more than once a month.  I am also concerned about the damage it may be doing to my cardiovascular system.  I have found the shot to be more effective than the nasal spray or the tablets.,F,42,5  years,4/20/2008,Imitrex

318, 2, Migraines - new onset,tightening in throat_ lethargy,The first time I tried the medication it did not work because my migraine had been going on too long.  Tried it today as soon as I felt symptoms coming on.  The first 100mg dose didnt do anything_ second dose still hasnt broken the migraine_ but I feel very lethargic_ which is not a good thing because I'm at work and my mind feels very clouded.,F,29,2  months,4/16/2008,Imitrex
319, 1, Severe headaches twice a month,After 15 min of taking it_ I felt like my arms weighed a hundred pounds. My neck was stiff and my jaw ached. I took the 100 mg. sample my doctor gave me. I rested for 30 min. and still have a mild headache. My whole body feels like it's been jarred in an accident. I did not get any info. about side effects since it was a sample and was not expecting to feel worse. I'm sticking with Aleve.,,F,41,1  days,4/15/2008,Imitrex
320, 1, Severe frequent migraines,I took it twice. Both times I felt sick to my stomach_ very out of it_ and worst of all- I had a horrible tightness in my neck that spread to the shoulders and face. It was unbearable. Maybe an hour later the all pain_ including the migraine_ was gone. Unfortunately it wasn't worth it to me.,Only worth it if I was willing to bear an hour of severe discomfort.,F,24,2  days,4/15/2008,Imitrex
321, 5, migraines,very slight feeling of tightness in my neck_ almost imperceptible,Imitrex has been a miracle drug for me.  Started getting migraines in early 20s_ and by the time I was 40 years old I had 2-3 a week - severe pain in head/neck_ nausea.  Tried everything_ finally a doctor prescribed Imitrex.  Wow - relief within an hour!  I use it sparingly because I worry about potential heart problems_ though I don't have any.  NOTE:  I have the 50-mg prescription and my dr. has me cut those in half_ so I'm only taking 25 mg (I only weigh about 110 lbs).  I wonder if some people's initial bad reactions were due to taking 100 mg - too high a dose?  I honestly don't know what I'd do without this drug.,F,48,8  years,4/13/2008,Imitrex
322, 5, Migraines,The most notable side effect I almost always experience after taking Imitrex is fatigue/lethargy/weakness.  Also_ oddly enough_ I always get extremely hungry after taking it--feel as though I will pass out if I don't eat right away.  Often get flushed_ too.  My shoulders/neck hurt also_ but that may be from the migraine_ not the Imitrex.  The weakness is the most disruptive side effect (sometimes lasts a day or two)_ but for me the benefits definitely outweigh the side effects.,Imitrex has been a life-saver for me.  I've been getting migraines since I was 6 years old.  Until Imitrex_ I would have no choice but to lay in bed for a day or more until the awful pain passed.  Imitrex allows me to continue to function when I have a migraine.  Takes most migraines away within about 30-45 minutes.   Leaves me feeling very weak and with pain in my shoulders/neck but_ again_ for me this is nothing in comparison to the awfulness of a migraine.  I am very grateful for the migraine relief this drug gives me--it has changed my life.,F,28,12  years,4/5/2008,Imitrex

When I am in full blown headache mode I take a shot and I within 5 minutes there is a tingling or warmth feeling.  But thats it.,Unless you are a fellow headache sufferer_ you have know idea how great it is to stop a headache on a dime.  Its the only thing that has allowed me to function normally.  I hate to sound like a commercial_ but it has truly been a wonder drug for me.  I just wish it was a little cheaper in that insurance companies try to ration my usage.  I actualy pay for it myself when I run over my monthly allotment if needed.  That is how critcial this drug has become to my well being.,M,53,15  years,3/31/2008,Imitrex
325, 5, Horrible migraines,I have been on the shots for about 3 years now and I have never experienced any side effects until just one time.

327, 4, Migraines,Feels like I'm on a cloud nine high when it kicks in.  The migraine goes away_ I get a little loopy and zoned_ sometimes get pretty sleepy and can't stay awake while I'm at work.  I sometimes get a tightness in my throat.,I try not to take this medicine when I don't have to_ but it works the best when you take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming on_ so I also can't delay in taking it too much.  The reason I try not to take it is because it makes me forgetful.  But it works like a charm most of the time.  It is most effective if I take it with Tylenol.  Once in awhile_ 1 out of 20 times or so_ it will make the headache go away but my headache will come back within 24 hours.  But that is just a bad migraine_ not the fault of Imitrex.If you get bad migraines_ make sure your doctor gives you a cardiac health test before taking the drug for the first time.  But this is really a miracle drug for migraine sufferers.  I've also taken the injection type.  I think it works faster_ but the pill is more convenient to stash everywhere....at work_ in all of my bags_ and in the car.The key to taking Imitrex is to just take it and take a nap.

331, 3, Migraines,I've taken this medication twice. The first time I felt my heart racing and the light headedness. I was afraid to fall asleep because I wasn't sure what was going on with my body. Amazingly though_ it took away my migraine. The second time I took it though_ I experienced the intense burning sensation through out my body. Sudden rush of heat_ sweats and then being cold only to feel another wave of sudden heat. Along with this I got very sick to my stomach along with vomiting. Again_ it did take away my migraine_ but for the rest of the day I felt like I couldn't catch my breath.,I did appreciate someone's comment with regards to changing the dosage_ and this is something I will pursue with my doctor. It is great to have a medicine that will elivate my migrains that I would usually have for 3 days at a time.

First time EVER I have been able to function normally the same day...used to be 1-2 days out of it_ severe headache_ aura_ numbness in arm_ etc.  Migraines suck_ and with them apparently back in my life_ it helps to know that I have something to lessen the severity as you start to think everytime there is some spot before your eyes it's the aura and beginning of that dreaded process of bedrest_ darkness_ silence and several days to really feel better.

I need a minimum hour of sleep before resuming daily activities or driving.,Before I found Imitrex (the INJECTION...both the oral and nasal spray tended to worsen my nausea symptoms) my migraines could be debilitating.

After 8 years of pain_ hospital visits_ and terrible side effects to other medications_ Imitrex finally gave me a light at the end of the tunnel.  I do worry about possible heart problems.  (a tip: A neurologist once told me to NEVER take over-the-counter pain meds other than Motrin because they made rebound headaches more frequent.  This advice has worked very well for me.),F,22,2  years,3/2/2008,Imitrex
340, 1, migraine,HEART ATTACK,Within three hours of taking Imitrex for only the second time_ I began to develop severe pain in my left shoulder blade area.  As the night progressed_ I had all the classic heart attack symptoms but delayed seeking medical help until the next morning as I was a healthy 51 yr old_ ideal weight_ controlled high blood pressure with mildly elevated lipids.  Luckily the heart attack was a mild one caused by a spasm brought on by the Imitrex.  Unfortunately I am now taking 9 pills a day as the artery involved in the heart attack was too small to stent so I have to take medication to prevent a recurrence.  Needless to say I highly recommend caution when considering taking this medication.,F,52,2  weeks,2/29/2008,Imitrex
341, 5, migraines,I have taken Imitrex for years - since it first came out. It amazes me to read about its side effects for some people. I have NEVER had any side effects_ just blessed relief 95% of the time.,Because I never have side effect and because Imitrex works so well for me_ I think I might over-take it.

That seemed to be a much safer route not only have my migraines cut down by 90% I rarely have to take the Imitrex and have that uncomfortable feeling. My family_ Mom_ Aunt & Cousin have done the Magnesium route and it has helped all of them as well. I must say when I get a migraine Imitrex does work.

I've taken them long enough to where I only have a slight ""hangover"" feeling after the shots. No side effects from the tablets.  Initially_ the shots gave me the warm feeling and tingling/tightness in my chest and head which made me scared.  I hardly ever get these symptoms anymore. If so_ they are mild. I take the tablets for the less severe migraines and take it when I feel a migraine coming on_ especially if it is a migraine-prone time for me (PMS_ extreme stress_ etc.)  I take the shots for severe migraines which I wake up with or ones that escalate in severity very quickly.",Imitrex has virtually SAVED MY LIFE.  I used to be in bed throwing up for days at a time.  Not only was it extremely painful and unpleasant_ but I missed a lot of work and had to get help with child care.  It interrupted every phase of my life and got worse after giving birth_ even with Imitrex.  I've tried the other triptans and Imitrex still works best for me.  Maxalt is the only other one that helps_ but doesn't last long.  I've tried just about every prevetive med out there and have only had moderate relief.  I at least feel like I have more control over the migraines when I get them.  Be sure to lay down and rest after taking a shot/tablet to give it time to work.

They always affect the left side of my head_ and produce a dull_ constant_ throbbing pain that doesn't go away for days. I would go to sleep and be woken up by the pain in the middle of the night. People thought I was crazy_ saying ""just take some advil"" - not understanding what type of pain I was in. NOTHING worked_ not over the counter_ not sleep_ not cold_ not heat_ no other presciption_ not caffeine_ NOTHING. On average_ the migraines last 3-4 days with zero relief (made grad school a nightmare!!!)Cost prevented me from ever having imitrex before. Once I started working full time with decent insurance_ I immediately got a script for this drug. I took my first imitrex shortly after_ and miraculously within 20 minutes my headache was GONE.

I have never had a migraine go away so quickly before. Nausea did not start until about 3 hours after taking the dose so unsure if related to drug.

I think I would have to be pretty desperate to take this medication again.  I had quit taking anything asprin/ibrophen related because it caused gastritis in my stomach_ but after today I think I'd rather risk having no stomach.,M,25,1  days,11/13/2007,Imitrex
387, 5, migraines,woozy feeling but happy... i FEEL drugged up! sore muscles like i fell down a hill_ but it's not painful.. just sore. sore throat and tingly feet,i absolutely adore imitrex. i am 20 and have gotten migraines since i was 7 years old. i could never find anything that worked until i got imitrex. usually after i take it_ i still need to lay down for about 20minutes in a quiet room for it to work quickly and to its full potential. if im at work or school_ in a noisy area it will usually still work_ but it will take much longer. the side effects are not bad at all_ i dont mind them! i usually feel really woozy like i am drugged up and it is sort of a good feeling! i take the 100mg beacuse that is what i need. it really relaxes you and makes you feel better_ but you will probably still want a nap after you take it_ as it makes you sleepy.,F,20,1  years,11/10/2007Email,Imitrex
388, 4, Migraines,Side effects are very strange and I don't like the feeling.  Tightness in jaw_ neck and shoulders.  Skin sensitive to heat or cold. But_ these all go away within an hour or more and they are definitely better than having the migraine.,The side effects are a bit scary but I have decided it is worth it.  I stopped taking the 100mg tablets because the side effects were a bit much but the 50mg tablets are much better. The only issue with the 50mg tablets is that the migraine tends to come back quicker (5 or 6 hours later) and another dose is needed.,F,35,1  years,10/29/2007,Imitrex
389, 4, Migranes with onset of menstruation,Stiffness and pain in jaw_ neck_ shoulders_ arm_ and thigh muscles. Slight dizzy/spacey feeling.,The side effects are a little strange and uncomfortable but honestly_ they are nothing compared to losing a day of work/sanity to a migrane.  I used to have to count on losing one or two days a month to a migrane but since talking with my Gynecologist and being put on Imitrex I can take it when I feel a migrane onset or even during a migrane and I can go to work.  It's probably best taken at night for me but unfortunately I can't control when I get these headaches.,F,33,7  months,10/12/2007,Imitrex
390, 1, Migraine,Violent throwing up!  Didn't help the headache at all,"I have had migraines all my life.  I have tried every ""new"" drug and found Fiorinal worked best (other than a rebound headache during one severe episode). The last trip to the doctor I had run  out of Fiorinal and he gave me samples of Imitrex nose spray for the next headache.  He said Fiorinal was addictive and didn't want his patients on it. And that Imitrex was a miracle - instant relief_ no side effects_ and not addictive.  I tried the nose spray this morning as a new severe migrain was coming on - immediatly I began throwing up_ like I had taken some sort of poinsin my body was trying to get rid of.  The violent throwing up sure didn't help my head!! I have no other side effects_ still throwing up_ stillhave a head ache which is now worse.  I'm glad it works for some. But_ I wish the doc had told me of the possible side effects and I am going back to DEMAND Fiorinal - at least it works and I don't care if he worries about addiction - my head hurts!",F,40,1  days,10/9/2007,Imitrex
391, 4, Migarine,"A full feeling in my chest. Very sensitive skin. Even a warm shower hurts my skin. Breathing slightly labored. Heart seems to be working harder. Since it ""squeezes"" everything in your body (like your blood vessels to stop that nasty surge of blood in  your brain that's causing the pain) including other internal organs_ it causes me to pee soon after I take it. Yep_ even the kidneys see some affects. All this usually peaks after about 45 minutes after I take it.","I've been taking Imitrex for about 10 years. Once all the side affects peak and the drug meets the migraine pain_ I can actually feel the pain back off. Of course I would rather have relief than go through vomiting and hiding in a dark room for days_ but it scares the heck out of me that this drug affects the rest of my organs so much. I just read a book titled ""The Migraine Cure"". I had my hormones checked because of this book. I mean it was a HUGE blood draw. I had my DHEA level checked because of that book. At 56 years I should hardly have any DHEA. I was found to have triple the amount. That causes vascular complications! This will cause huge migraines!! I will be working with my doctor to lower my DHEA levels. Run_ don't walk and insist on having a thorough blood test that checks ALL your hormones and adrenal hormones.

After the Doc. performed an angiogram_ he came back to tell me that my vascular system is very clean and that I have no blockages. That my heart muscle suffered damage due to the chemicals in Imitrex which is a known side affect.  After leaving the hospital another woman got in touch with me that suffered a stroke. I know first hand how painful migraines are and I know that the tendency when reading ""side effects"" is ""it will never happen to me"".

I take the Imitrex and wait for it to kick in_ within 20 minutes....wham it hits in the space of 5 seconds_ the migrain is gone and I am back to normal. This drug is the only thing that works _ all the others take forever to kick in and only provide minor relief. they could charge $1000 a pill and I would buy it.,I have scaled my doses back_ start with 100MG then 50MG and have found that lately if I catch it early enough_ I can cut a 50MG in half and only use half of it.

394, 5, Migraines,Some tingling in extremities due to the vasoconstriction effects.  Worse when I take the full 100mg tab.  I try not to exercise after use. This seems to keep any effects to a minimum.  I have not heard of imitrex causing heart problems but it could exacerbate existing conditions.,Splitting the 100 mg tab works great for me.  Glad to see I am not the only one.  The only problem with the oral med is when I have a migraine with severe nausea. This drug either works great for you or doesn't work at all.

There have been times where I have a headache 20 days a month_ but mostly I use about 10 injections.  I have tried many preventatives without much help and the side affects are so sever I don't like them.  Imitrex injections do hurt_ I don't like to take them but they have saved my life and my sanity.  I don' know what I'd do without them.,F,52,10  years,9/28/2007,Imitrex

Usually_ it works within 30 minutes_ but at times takes up to 3 hours.  I've been taking it for about 3 years.  Prior to that_ I suffered for 35 years.  I always make sure I have it with me.

I had been set up for brain surgery_ however the surgeon suggested getting a 2nd opinion _ which led to the use of imitrex_ and trying other medications.,I take two shots  a day - and percodan when I cannot use another shot.  I've recently found out that as a result of all the prednazone I've taken over the past 31 years_ I now have osteoporosis - I am somewhat concerned about the long term effects of the imitrex - however at this point - the relief of pain takes priority.,M,58,2  days,9/21/2007Email,Imitrex

I am on 3 doses (50 mg_ 100 mg_ and injection) and depending on my migraine (speed of onset_ severity of pain_ etc.) I know what dose to take.  I have heard many good things and many bad things about Imitrex.  If you are reading this and considering this medication_ it is worth a shot.  You never know how it will react with YOUR body chemistry and while others don't like it_ you might.  It works for me and I am SO glad it is out there as an option to treat my migraines!  The only complaint about it is the new triangle shape...I used to be able to break the 100mg in half I only needed a smaller dose...AND THE STUPID PACKAGING!!!

401, 4, migraine,Side effects minimal and can be managed.  Mostly prickly feeling in mouth and throat.  Never had migraines until about 3 years ago_ after menopause.  Didn't know what it was----thought I was dying.  A trip to the ER and many tests later revealed migraines.  Still haven't figured out what triggers them.  Imitrex---100mg. at onset really helps.  I can function at work and at home.  My advice is don't wait until it gets unbearable.  You know the difference between a regular 2 Tylenol headache and a migraine.  Take it soon and you won't suffer.,,F,57,1  years,9/14/2007,Imitrex
402, 4, Migraines,My hands ache for several hours after I have taken a dose.  Neck and shoulder stiffness if common also.,Many of the side effects I am reading in these ratings are the feelings I had after my migraines_ so side effects like stiffness in my neck and shoulders seem like nothing if I don't have to have a migraine.  After suffering occasional migraines since I was a teenager_and being treated with demerol and phenegran_ my life was turned upside down last summer when I started having several a week and then a chronic migraine that lasted six days_ resulting in hospitalization.  Propholactic drugs did not work_ but taking 100mg of Immitrex when I feel a migraine coming on will_ on most occasions_ effectually stop the migraine.  When a whopper hits_ I take another 100mg.  Stormy weather and hormones seem to be my triggers.  I often follow up_ after a bout of fighting migraines with a theraputic massage.,F,49,1  years,9/7/2007,Imitrex

405, 4, Migraine,I have a few side effects and they're all tolerable. Heavy feeling in my arms and neck. Prickling sensation up neck and back of the head. Imitrex usually leaves me tired_ but usually quite capable of functioning.,Imitrex works a lot more effectively for me than Advil or Fiorinal (what I took for almost 40 years previous). Most of the time when I take Imitrex (usually about three or four times a month)_ I can still work_ drive_ etc.  The medication works much better if it is taken at the headache's onset_ but with two 100 mg doses (I take the pills)_ the medication mostly works even if I take it in the middle of a pounding headache. A mild headache (or one that I catch when I feel it coming on) is generally gone within an hour.

I used to constantly be plagued by impending headache advancing to migraine about three times a week. 20mg nasal spray works great;  100 mg pill works ok_ but takes too long to kick in.  Seems as though I am building up tolerance to it-- I often now have to take two nasal sprays to work (sometimes I think this is because I have had the medication with me in the heat or sunlight-- it is very sensitive to heat-- and so I think the dosage has been rendered bad by the heat).  Once I had taken 20 mg spray with no relief when I was in remote Mexican village. After 2 hours_ the only thing I had left was 100 mg tablet.  I cut it in half to get 50mg and took it.  DON'T DO THIS!!!! My neck spasmd very stiff and I could not move my head for an hour. I thought I had done myself in.  Thank God my neck came back after three or four hours.

At 50 my side effects were hardly noticeable.  Also_ if you take it after the headache is already off and running_ you will not get the proper benefit_ and maybe thats why higher dose is needed_ and then more side effects??

Back then I had the sensitivity to light/sound/noise and nausea but that has diminished over the years_ except I now get migraines that are sinus in nature behind my left eye that are accompanied by those problems.  Anyway_ Imitrex quit working about 3 or 4 years later and then I switched to Zomig.  A co-worker gave me a tab of her Imitrex recently and it worked_ so it is my #2 pain reliever.  I like to have an arsenal of relievers because I believe our bodies become immune to them_ at least mine does.  I do notice Imitrex tends to cause more rebounds than Zomig (when rebounds occur).,F,34,6  years,4/20/2007Email,Imitrex

But in the last few months I have noticed a rapid increase in the frequency and intensity of my migraines--back up to where it was (or maybe even worse) before I started the meds.  I have read on other forums that some people develop a tolerance for Imitrex.  I think that is what has been happening for me.  Now_ I try to only take it once or twice a month--and just suffer through the rest of the time.  This way_ I am finding that it has the potency it used to_ and does a great job at an acute moment.

They take longer to work but are portable and not painful. None of the other triptans work for me. This medication has improved/saved my quality of life. I am mildly concerned about the long term effects on my circulatory system but really have no other option to get rid of my headaches.,F,29,9  years,5/9/2006,Imitrex
483, 5, migraines,Very few and minor.  First started with injections--the effect was miraculous--some soreness at injection site.  Later switched to pills_ which took longer to work but were less expensive and more portable. Neurologist had me try newer triptans over the years but Imitrex works best for me.  For the past year I have been receiving Botox injections from the neuro_ in my forehead and back over my skull and neck.  I have now had four treatments (every three months) and the cumulative effect of the Botox is very  beneficial_ which is something his other patients are also reporting.  I have only used Imitrex twice in the last eight weeks.  My insurance is paying for most of the Botox treatment.  It is worth checking out.,,F,59,12  years,5/4/2006,Imitrex

Once one started_ my day was over - spent in bed with someone vigoursly massaging my neck and shoulders and me rubbing my temples_ eye lids and wanting to bang my head into the wall over and over.Had heard about Imitrex but not enough ""good"" insurance to cover it. Once I changed jobs I immediately went to the doctor and they prescribed the 100MG tablet.One table - no more than 30 minutes_ 100% gone. Truly amazing.

485, 5, Migraine,flushing_ fluttery heart_ diuresis_ some muscular discomfort,This drug has changed my life. I have been taking it since 1992 or so (I was tracking when it would go to market. I thought it was around 1992. I am an early adopter by any measure). I suffer from a cluster/common migraine and can get them 2-8 times a month. My twenties were filled with days with a cold cloth_ darkened windows and useless OTC drugs. I looked into all other medicines/remedies that never worked. I tried the first 'gun' style injector and then the epi-pen style and now am on tablets (50 mg). The injections are quicker but less mobile. I keep a tablet in my wallet for security. Tablets are slower but still do the trick. My mother gets little relief from imitrex but it has been an unbelievable godsend for me.Most or all of the symptoms I had I no longer have except for needing to urinate or move my bowels some time after taking it (10-50 mins). no big deal at all.,M,42,14  years,4/17/2006,Imitrex
486, 5, migraines,A slight 'medicine head' feeling. Migraine would resurface the following day after taking the drug if not taken with something else.,Works very well when taken in conjunction with Ibuprofen. I take approximately 50 mg in pill form along with anywhere from 200-400 mg (1-2 pills) of Ibuprofen at the outset of the headache. This cuts down tremendously on the reccurence of a headache the next day. My neurologist recommended this and it has been great.,M,36,4  years,4/5/2006,Imitrex

Forehead felt tight_ and my head just felt weird for a few hours_ but when that feeling subsided_ it took the headache with it.  It's no wonder though_ of course it would feel strange when a medication works on your nerves and blood vessels...,It started taking effect in the first 30 minutes; and about two hours after taking it my headache was gone.

489, 1, Migraines,I took imitrex for a few months about 5 years ago.  I didn't like the side effects at all (rapid heart beat_ burning in chest_ neck and face_ difficulty breathing) and it didn't help my migraines all that much_ so I stopped taking it.  Unfortunately_ the damage had been done.  Ever since then_ I get dizzy and out of breath easily_ and I have heart palpitations almost daily.  I can actually feel it skip beats.  This never happened until I took imitrex.  My old boss actually had open-heart surgery years back_ and they said it was in part due to her taking imitrex for migraines.  It seems the potential dangers outweigh the pros of imitrex.,Be careful!,F,25,2  months,3/9/2006Email,Imitrex

It usually takes my headache away with the first pill with little side effects.,F,29,3  weeks,2/24/2006,Imitrex

Anyone who understands the pain of cluster headaches knows how desperate you get for relief.  After trying various other meds prescribed by my neurologist_ and several trips to an ER for injections of Demerol to help me ""sleep it off""_ an ER physician said ""Demerol is an addictive narcotic; I'd like to try something else_ and if it works_ I can write you a prescription and you can inject yourself at home.""  With these shots_ my cluster headaches completely disappear within 10 minutes.  The only problem is that on RARE occasions_ I have more than 2 headaches within a 24-hour period.

Very tired and lethargic_ I don't open my mouth after I take it because air on my tongue makes the taste worse.  Swallowing makes the taste resurface.  This taste issue is pretty bad.  But the fast acting anti-nausea is nice.,It helps with the nausea_ but the taste is terrible.  IT makes me gag for a little while.

496, 5, Migraines/Sometimes Clusters,I feel a bit of flushing throughout my body. Mild to severe nasuea depending on the severity of the headache when I take it (very little nausea at the aura stage_ significant nausea for a full-blown migraine).,Have suffered from migraines since age 12. Family history of migraines (great-grandfather_ grandmother_ father_ 2 brothers). I was debilitated in my early 20's when the only treatment was heavy narcotics_suffered for weeks at a time_ and was hospitalized several times. Severe symptoms - vomiting_ diahrrea_ sensitivity to light and sound. Tried EVERYTHING including bio-feedback therapy and prophylactic meds with limited results. Prescribed Imitrex in 1991 - use the injections because they are faster and more effective. This has been a wonder drug and works 85% of the time with the first dose. I found the auto injector was a bit painful so I learned to give myself the injection using a needle so I could inject it more slowly which is less painful. Even the headaches that don't subside are less severe and I have not visited an ER with a migraine since 1991. This drug is a miracle and I am so grateful for it.

I have to eat before taking it_ as on an empty stomach_ it can make me sick.,I LOVE this medication.   Before I figured out that these debilitating headaches were migraines_ I would suffer for 3 days with each side of my head.   When the pain started getting so intense it was making me nauseous as well_ I couldn't take it anymore.  I have no idea how people have survived migraines in the past.  It is a horrible chronic disease.   But then I found the triptans.  I was saved.  They all work_ though Imitrex makes me least nauseous_ when on an empty stomach.    I hope it keeps working forever...  I'm afraid of one day popping one and the magic not working anymore.   This is truly a life-altering drug.   I'm glad to see that there are people out there who have taken it for a decade or more.  :),F,40,2  years,11/9/2005,Imitrex

Every time I take imitrex my hand cramps into a ball and I cannot pull my thumb from my palm.  My hands_ arms_ and neck are numb and tingly and this last for days but I can deal with it because it is the only thing that helps my migraines.  However_  I took a 100mg pill 24 hrs ago and I am still feeling heart palpitations and tightness in my chest.  Also_ I feel as if my brain is only functioning at half capacity. Everything is hazy.

I would have them for the week of my period_ and the following week.  I felt like I only enjoyed 50% of my life. My doctor and I had even discussed a hysterectomy. The only thing that kept me from throwing up from the pain was a shot of Demoral and Phenergan.  The quality of life on that stuff is no better than having a migraine_ as you sleep your life away.

It makes me a little nauseous also.,I started having migraines at age 61 which is consider out of the ordinary.  My symtoms seem to be the onset of severe fatigue_ following bouts of several hours of sleep.  Then usually a migraine will come after these symtoms.  Imitrex helps if I take it as soon as these symtoms occur or if I take it after the migraine has begun.  However_ the fatigue and frequent sleeping occurs after taking the Imitrex as well as before the onset of the migraine.

But when it is damp and cold_ I take about 3 or more Imitrex (50 mg each) a month. Have not noticed side-affects. I take Topamax (75 mg) to help lessen intensity of migraines_ which works; however_ I am concerned about those side effects. Imitrex appears to be a lifesaver. Am hoping I am not surprised by problems later!,F,51,3  years,1/7/2005,Imitrex

535, 1, migraines,I had a vaso-spasm heart attack in Nov. 2003 thirty five minutes after taking a 50mg. Imitrex.  I was never a smoker_ not overweight_ did take BP meds but my pressure was controlled.  Doctors had no problem prescribing Imitrex.  Took it intermittently over a 10 year period.  Then_ suddenly_ had a heart attack.  Literature says it can do that but of course_ you never think it will be you.,,F,56,10  years,12/28/2004,Imitrex
536, 5, Treat Headaches,I really seem to only be a bit tired.  I do/did have tingling down my arms that seems to be sustained over several days. I don't know whether this is Imitrex-induced or some other problems with stress.  Regardless_ I have nearly 100 percent efficacy response once I take one tablet (or two after 2 hours) of 50 mg.  Excellent drug and I'm not a drug user. I really hope in the future that I don't experience heart-related problems with it since cardiac arrest is prominent in my family history.,,M,44,4  years,12/23/2004,Imitrex

538, 1, migraines,45 minutes after taking Imitrex I suffered a heart attack.  Since all other factors were eliminated_ doctors feel Imitrex caused a piece of plack to dislodge and move to the Left Anterior Descending artery and cause a blockage.  Had STENT placed.  Very scary experience.,,F,60,4  years,12/19/2004,Imitrex
539, 5, Migraine Headaches,Rapid heart palpitations_ tingling throughout my body.,Imitrex is the only medication that has every taken my migraines away_ and in the shortest amount of time.

544, 4, Migraines,Tightness in the chest and throat_ also rapid heart beat sometimes feels irregular.,I won't give it a 5_ because I really dislike the sideffects.  I have migraines usually with vomiting_ but the post nasal drip (the taste is god aweful and makes me gag) from the nasal verson is more taxing on my constitution than just my nausea alone.  The 50mg tabs are good_ but again the side effects are not easy to deal with while the migraine is slowly going away.  I was taking midrin for the past 3 years and that was hit or miss_ not with Imitrex though.  Has worked every time I have taken it. Unfortunately_ I get migraines almost every other day and my doc only allows me to use it 2 times a week_ which I try to abide by and use benadryl and promethazine in large ammounts the rest of the week.  Only sure fire for me is mag drip and DHE via IV_ but usually only get that if a migraine lasts more than 24hrs at the same intensity (8+).,M,26,2  months,10/25/2004,Imitrex

546, 5, migraines,It has worked well for years - like a miracle.  Now when I take it_ I have concerns about my heart because of palpitations_ etc.  These sensations don't last long so I will still take Imitrex for migraines.  Will also alert my doctor to the side effects I am experiencing.  Fortunately I'm having much fewer headaches than ever before (an actual benefit of getting older?),CAFERGOT: very bad reaction when taken with Imitrex - thought my head was going to explode (and I'm used to severe migraines!).BIAXIN_ an antibiotic: I had an allergic reaction (shallow breathing_ rapid heartbeat) when taken with Imitrex.
