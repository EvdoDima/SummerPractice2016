0, 4, C. Difficile,Mouth sores_ rapid weight gain_ insomnia_ depression _ but this could have been coupled with my c.difficile.,I was given IV for 6 days then oral liquid 4 times a day with home recovery. Very expensive drug. Terrible side effects but I got better slowly.,F,58,4  weeks,4/17/2016,Vancomycin hcl
1, 2, MRSA,After 2 weeks of HIGH dosage one day started itching from head to toe_ was told to take benadryl. Extreme headache_ hives_ rash_ dizziness_ nausea_ fever_ chills_ uncontrollable shaking_ low blood pressure (at times)_ and worst of all was the extreme pain in my arms neck and shoulders_ which I am still feeling a week later_ I can hardly move my left arm which is also numb_ but the dr said I will regain use within 3 weeks.,It cleared the MRSA but I had terrible reaction to it! I recommend the drug because it will eat MRSA for breakfast lunch and dinner but PLEASE PLEASE don't be afraid to let the nurse know IMMEDIATELY if you start to feel any of the above symptoms especially the itching. Redman syndrom is not too big of a deal I guess but in my case it was pretty extreme.,M,28,2  weeks1700 2X D,6/29/2012,Vancomycin hcl

The dr. suspected CDiff_ which I later found out I did NOT have.,F,31,5  days 1X D,3/30/2011,Vancomycin hcl
4, 4, MSRA or whatever its called xD,Felt very weird_ instant ichiness_ that's about it.,This worked very well for me_ I had a horride staph infection that i let get out of hand and thank goodness they had this big bad boy antibiotic to kick its tail around.  My wounds healed up nicely and im now on bactrim to finish up.,M,20,7  days,7/4/2009,Vancomycin hcl
5, 2, MRSA,It seems to have handled the MRSA_ but caused a rash over most of my body.  Feet_ hands_ and groin especially.  2 weeks since coming off of the Vancomycin and still peeling in areas_ feet and hands are still sensitive.,"I only give this a ""2"" because the MRSA seems to have been cured.  A ""1"" would probably be more appropriate_ but since the MRSA is as dangerous as it is_ I will leave the rating a ""2"".  The skin reaction has definitely extended my recovery.",M,38,7  days,4/12/2009,Vancomycin hcl
6, 1, high white blood cell count,My mother developed a whole body rash with severe huge blistering from vancomycin. Her blood pressure dropped significantly and never made it out of the ICU.
