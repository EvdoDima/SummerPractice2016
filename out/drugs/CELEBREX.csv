0, 5, Joint pain,For 6 mths I've suffered chronic pain in the morning woken from sleep in pain in my joints. It started in my knees_ then elbows & wrists. But 2 mths ago it started in my hips & lower back_ & as my sleep was interrupted DAILY_ so was my life. As soon I get up the pain would go_ but the other day it wouldn't. So I went to my Dr who gave me Celebrex. I was scared to take it reading bad reviews. So I rang my Dr & he said take it & let me know how you feel tomorrow. I took it last night & can't believe I waited THIS long to try it. For the 1st time in 6 mths I woke with NO pain & it made me drowsy_ which was a bonus. Celebrex WORKED for me so I want to write a POSITIVE review for people out there who are scared off by bad reviews I read HERE. I'm pain free_ so I hope it works for others as it has me. I am PAIN FREE!!!,The only side effect I had was drowsiness_ which was a good one_ as I haven't had a good nights sleep in 6 months!,F,36,1  days200mg 1X D,7/27/2016Email,Celebrex

10, 1, joint pain,About 30 minutes after taking Celebrex with milk_ I felt an explosion in my chest_ broke out in an itchy allergic rash accompanied by dysphoria_ heart palpitations_ and closing of the throat.  That was 8 weeks ago.  Since then_ I've had one episode of nausea accompanied by cold sweats_ heart palpitation and dysphoria to the point of almost passing out.  In fact_ I had all of the symptoms of a heart attack.  I choose to go to the emergency room.  My heart passed with flying colors but the symptoms haven't gone away.  When I told the Doctor at the ER what I had taken_ along with my history since_ he shook his head and said I was lucky.  My real problem is gastrointestinal.  Right now_ I suffer from gurd_ accompanied by pain in upper left_ middle and left sections of the abdomen.  I have never suffered gastrointestinal problems in my life!  At this point_ I can't even eat a couple of tablespoons of tuna without experiencing heart burn and worse.   I will be going to a regular doct,"I would not recommend Celebrex to anyone for anything_ not because it doesn't work to alleviate the pain associated with arthritis or joint pain but because the side effects are devastating.  It simply isn't worth it.  If I can stop one person from taking this and ruining their gastrointestinal tract_ believe me this is painful and could very well be chronic and life threatening_ I will have done my job.  DON""T TAKE THIS!",F,59,1  days200mg 1X D,1/11/2016,Celebrex
11, 1, Arthritis,Thank God I did not take this drug. I'm only reviewing to warn people that if you have a life threatening sulfa allergy like I do_ do not take this medicine.,My doctor prescribed this to me well aware of my sulfa allergy. My allergy is so severe and I'm so sensitive to sulfa that I cannot ingest anything with sulfates in it either. While the sulfate reaction isn't life threatening_ it has sent me to the ER before with severe heart palpitations and feeling as though I was having a heart attack. I went to fill the prescription & my pharmacy alerted me Celebrex contains sulfa. I called my doctor's office and ask why they would prescribe me a medication with sulfa & they shrugged it off stating it's just a trace amount. A trace amount is all it would take to close my throat. Needless to say I got a new doctor within the week.,F,49,1  days,1/7/2016Email,Celebrex

27, 3, Rheumatoid Arthritis,I am 10 days into taking Celebrex. Days 1-8 were great... No side effects  and it helped with the severe pain_ stiffness and swelling in my hands and wrists. I went from not being able to use my hands to gaining full use of them. However yesterday_ day 9_ I began to have horrendous stomach which has not stopped. I have been lying in bed_ in the fetal position with a heating pad on my stomach. Even the morphine I take for my back (failed back syndrome) won't get this pain under control. I've decided to stop taking the Celebrex for few days to see if the stomach pain stops. If it does I'm going to try it one more time along with a PPI. If that doesn't work then I guess I'm back to not using my hands again.  It totally stinks because Celebrex has been the only medication which has helped my RA pain_ but I just can't take this stomach pain. It is like I have to choose the lesser of two evils... Excruciating RA pain or severe stomach pain. I wish there was something that worked as well as Celebrex without the side effects.,,F,36,10  days200,3/5/2015Email,Celebrex

Took first dose before bed_ upon waking the next morning I could hardly move my injured hand (the one the medicine was supposed to be helping)_ all of my joints hurt. Worse part was when I sat down on the couch every bone in my spine popped in secession_ moved again a couple minutes later and the same thing happened. I have never had a problem with my back before.

First thought it was asthma having been recently diagnosed but found that was not the case.,Was surprised to have had problems with this medication as I had taken it 3 years ago when I underwent knee replacement.

Called dr and told him of my side effects he said that Celebrex was not the cause but to stop taking until my appointment with in in 3 days. I've read that this medicine can cause blood cloth and stoke. I don't want to take this med,This medicine aggravated my gastritis and I specifically asked the dr if this will flare up my gastritis and he reassured me it won't.

The symptoms came on suddenly...generally feeling ill_ like I had the flu.  I chilled_ had terrible muscle pain and achiness_ and my joint pain was 3x worse than before I started taking Celebrex.  Within an hour of taking a Celebrex_ the symptoms let up significantly both times and completely disappeared after several hours.  I have found testimony from a few others with similar symptoms.

46, 1, Osteoarthritis,It certainly relieved my arthritis symptoms and I was always extremely diligent about taking it on a full breakfast to avoid gastrointestinal side effects but......18 months ago I had a routine gastroscope and it found some small cellular changes in the lining of my stomach. I was commenced on Nexium and reduced my Celebrex to alternate mornings. Just had my second gastroscope and I have pre-malignant Barrett's plus pre-malignant changes in my gastric lining from reflux and heartburn. And I had no symptoms since taking Nexium. I was advised by the gastroenterologist to NEVER take Celebrex again due to the potentially life-threatening changes in pathology. And yes_ I have been almost teetotal for 32 years and a non-smoker for 35 years.,If you have ANY symptoms of heartburn_ reflux_ GORD.....get a gastroscopy as soon as possible.

This is a wonderful medication. NO ONE knows my pain with every step I take. Celebrex has not made all the pain go away_ because I am a paramedic and work 16-24 hour shifts_ but it makes a considerable difference. I can either take it and walk or not take it and not walk or play with my grandchild. Every body is different to any drug.

I've been on two other medications: Lyrica (broke out in two rashes within the first two days of taking it) and Voltaren (extreme upset stomach to the point I couldn't eat or drink only after three days). So doc's trying me on Celebrex. I've noticed right away that I'm very moody with my family and pets. I don't get angry that often so when I do get irritable_ I think back to what was new. I've also had very real and intense dreams. So much so that I wake up feeling tired and rung out. (My husband was worried this morning because I quit breathing a few times longer than 10 seconds. That's definitely worrisome.) I have trouble getting to sleep as it is and this makes it worse. I take two 3mg tablets of Melatonin a night which work very well. But since starting the Celebrex_ I can't seem to get a good night's rest. I'm not sure if I want to continue. I'm going to go off of it for a few days and see if that relieves my symptoms. If it does_ off the med I go. I will not live in misery for anyone. Doc's not going to be happy with me. Oh well_ my body_ not his.,F,47,5  days200 mg 1X D,2/19/2010,Celebrex
124, 1, Hip flexor tendinitis,Heart palpitations_ increase in blood pressure,Both my general practitioner and (my new) cardiologist have basically pooh-poohed my supposition that Celebrex is the cause of my heart palpitations because it's not a common side effect.  Wish I had referenced this board PRIOR to taking Celebrex.  I would have stuck with my tried and true Advil.  Started on a blood pressure medication yesterday that already seems to be helping.  In my opinion_ I think Celebrex needs to do a recount on the possibility of heart palpitations as a side efect.,F,49,30  days200 1X D,2/12/2010,Celebrex
125, 5, fibromyalgia,none that I know of,I suffered from horrific pain for over 20 years/ started taking celebrex...literally changed my life with a 90% reduction on pain.  Unfortunately_ my HMO will not cover it (claims advil is just as effective for most people) so I have to go out of network for the script and order the meds from a Canadian pharmacy. I am willing to assume the risk of complications in exchange for the pain reduction as I have not found any med to be even half as effective. I worked with my OON doc for almost 3 years to find other alternatives to pain relief/ nothing came close to celebrex (or its generic counterpart) for me. My HMO makes me feel like a drug seeker by their refusal to prescribe/cover celebrex  :(,F,49,5  years200mg 1X D,2/6/2010,Celebrex
126, 5, rheumatoid arthritis,acid reflux and stomach irritation in general,"I was diagnosed with RA in 1991. My life came to a virtual standstill shrouded in excrutiating pain. I tried all of the nsaids_ with no relief. Prednisone was my only relief (you want some side effects_ take take stuff for 11 or 12 years).  I began taking Celebrex when it first came on the market and it worked wonderfully.  I was taken off the med for two weeks to check liver enzyme elevation and the RA pain returned with a vengance.  Everything is a trade off.  No pain/potential death.  I've been able to live a very active life for many years thanks to Celebrex and Enbrel (another ""dangerous"" drug).  I believe it to be a fair trade off.",M,61,9  years,2/3/2010,Celebrex

I have been off it for a about a week and if my knee arthritis flares up again_ I will ask my doctor for more.The intense dreams have stopped so I really think it was the Celebrex.

Nausea and a couple episodes of all night vomiting.  Yeah_ that's fun..It took a while to actually figure out that it was the celbrex.

But I've been feeling off_ disconnected_ disinterested in others and sometimes_ irrationally angry.  I also take meds for high blood pressure (told my doc) and I haven't checked my bp since starting_ but I have noticed a few occasions where I was either light-headed or having that heart fluttering feeling that largely went away when I went on the micardis.  I've never experienced side effects from a medication before and I'm not allergic to anything medically_ but I do have a high tolerance and quick metabolization rate for pain meds (I take 4 ibuprofen for the mildest pain relief_ the only thing that will kill pain for more than 3 consecutive doses at the expected pacing is 5-10mg of percocet--vicodin_ tramadol_ and oxy do very little.  Looks like this stuff falls in the sam,I will continue to take this stuff for the initial 30 days prescribed just to show due diligence_ but it's pretty weak and not worth a permanently salty mood for the weak pain relief and possible bp conflicts.,F,33,7  days,12/14/2009Email,Celebrex

I was at work and could not type anymore and I slurred my words. It was very scary and I vowed to never take it again. My cramps are very painful but now I take a Vicodin instead_ a narcotic that works and doesn't make me feel crazy and tired.

Will monitor.,I was on Celebrex for approximately 5 years for joint pain associated with osteoarthritis. I do not recall ever feeling that I was experiencing any negative side effects from Celebrex. Due to change of insurance and Celebrex being classed in the highest co-pay category_ I asked my doctor to switch to something less costly. Switched to Mobic_ which is like taking a placebo. I took Mobic for a full year before finally giving up and asking for Celebrex again_ despite the cost. With Mobic I could barely get up out of my chair_ didn't sleep well at night due to joint pain; therefore_ I was always extremely tired. One dose of 200 mg Celebrex and I slept for four hours straight (which is a record for this lifetime insomniac) and am able to get up and move around with little to no pain.However_ 3 days after starting back on Celebrex_ I either contracted a 24-hour virus or experienced some severe side effects from starting back on Celebrex. I have switched myself to one day on/one day off b,F,53,7  days,12/24/2008,Celebrex

I am going to give the sulfasalazine a little while longer. The celebrex decreased the joint pain/stiffness better but didnt last as long_ I took it right before bed and woke up stiff. The sulfasalazine must build up differently b/c I can miss a dose and still cant tell with stiffness_ but the joint pain is a little worse than it was with celebrex...cant decide which is worse....,F,26,3  years,12/18/2008,Celebrex
181, 2, knee and ankle trauma_ arthritis,Since taking celebrex I had noticed a lot of fatigue.  Doctor that prescribed indicated likely not related to the Celebrex_ but after doing my own reading up on this product_ I have my doubts.  Also_ noticing some water retention with this product.,It definitely seems to help with inflammation_ which is a huge issue for me.  The trade off however isnt worth it_ Id rather be in a little more pain and have my energy back.  After reading about more patients reporting fatigue_ I will be stopping use of this product to see if theres any difference.,M,47,10  months,12/15/2008,Celebrex

I am allergic to sulfa antibiotic. Stopped the Celebrex_ took a 7-day course of Protonics and abdominal pain resolved. Pain had become concerning enough that Dr. made me have a stress echo to r/o cardiac origin_ results were fine. I am totally convinced that the problem was due to the sulpha correlation (even though not supported by the literature).

The medication has left me with reactive airways and since taking it_ I have not been able to get rid of reactive asthma. My airways have been left allergic and I have asthma that I never had before.  This is seemingly not written up in the side effects regarding celebrex_ but I'm living proof that it happened.  On a side note_ it did not work for pain either.,This drug seemingly is different from sulfa containing drugs and therefore if you have a sulfa allergy_ it is supposed to be safe.

Slight stomach pain_ very low almost like menstrual pain_ but I had a hysterectomy so it's not that. I think I am going to call my Dr. first thing Monday morning.

I am so glad I found this page!,I took Vioxx for several years_ then it was pulled and I was put on Bextra.

222, 1, arthritis in hip & feet (heel spurs,Blood in stool; yellowing of skin & eyes (damages the liver).,When heel spurs were diagnosed in 2000_ my dr instructed me to take Celebrex every day for the rest of my life.  That was in 2000.  If I don't take it_ must constantly grind heels against a hard surface to relieve instense pain.  If I do take it_ there's no pain.  BUT new md (8 yrs into taking this med) now tells me she wants me to gradually wean myself away from this.  She insists they now know that this medicine should NOT be taken daily by ANYONE_ because of potentially fatal_  dangerous side effects (heart attacks_ strokes_ liver damage_ ulcers_ intestinal bleeding_ etc.).  She encouraged me to only take it if and when I need it.  Now new problems with back have arisen.  The DC is offering alternative approaches and says drugs only mask the pain.  They do not solve or heal the problem causing the pain_ and the meds often make new problems of their own.

I skipped my 4th dosage last night and today I feel great.  No anxiety whatsoever.  But it was REAL scary because the anxiety lasted for nearly 1 1/2 days after the 3rd dose.  It took that long to get out of my system.  I must be hyper-sensitive to this version of an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) because I've used NSAID's before without much problem.  The only problem similar to this I've had is when I was on prescription strength Naproxen for a month_ followed by a couple weeks of ibuprofen (2-4 tables a day).  That was about 2 months ago_ and I after I stopped taking those drugs my heart settled down and the anxiety went away.  But the anxiety at that time was nothing like what I experienced with Celebrex.  Hopefully someone else who has the same reaction with Celebrex will read my comments here and it will help them.

288, 2, myofascial pain in shoulder,extreme anxiety_ nausea_ rapid heart,My mom has taken Celebrex safely for a long time_ so I was glad when my orthopedic docter prescribed it for the pains in my back because I thought it was the safest thing to take (I normally avoid taking any pills if I can).  It cut the pain in about 1/2 after the first 200 mg dose (I'm taking one 200 mg tablet a day)_ then after the 2nd dose the pain was all gone!  But I noticed some moderate anxiety after the 2nd dose_ and after the 3rd dose the anxiety was so bad I was up all night with the feelings of impending doom just like the other guy who posted here.  It was TERRIBLE.  And I have no history of anxiety disorders either.  I don't think I can dare take another dose.  It works great for me on the pain_ but I'd rather have moderate pain than feelings like I don't want to live.,M,46,3  days,9/10/2005,Celebrex

I find it works better if I take it at least 2 hours before the pain starts at all_ which is hard to anticipate.  Overall I think it's not as good as the other Cox 2s_ but then there is little that really works well on menstrual pain.   Celebrex is better than OTCs of course_ but there is a constant need to supplement it with actual pain meds.  I would say this drug knocks the pain down by about 50%.,F,27,2  days,7/17/2005Email,Celebrex

However_ starting with day 3_ I started feeling the most profound anxiety of my life and it was becoming progressively worse till day 7 when I finally stopped taking it.  The feeling of impending doom was just unbearable.  Second morning    after the last dose_ aches in my arm_ shoulder and neck returned (so celebrex did help with that) but the anxiety subsided almost immediately.

339, 2, Broken leg&neck+fractures,none,Iliked it better than Vioxx_ it did help a little but had to increase the dosage and it eventually stopped helping me at all. Also after the I seen the recent studies show that there are good possibilities that vioxx and celebrex can slow down bone union and strength(overall make it take longer to heal) it makes since to me becouse docs say my leg is healing slower than normal(i dont smoke) and they dont really know why my neck isnt healing.so im quitting celebrex. _i also have taken vicoden and percocet which is the only thing that gets me out of pain.,M,24,6  weeks,5/27/2002Email,Celebrex
