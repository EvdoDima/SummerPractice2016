0, 3, Short luteal phase/ttc,Dizziness and drowsiness which wasn't a big deal since it was taken at bedtime. Minor mood swings which could also be related to impending period.,I was put on it to lengthen my luteal phase. I would start spotting 6-7 days past ovulation. The only thing progesterone supplements did was lengthen it by two days. On 9 days past ovulation_ I began spotting again anyways.,F,36,9  days200mg/day,8/7/2016,Prometrium

4, 4, Heavy_ irregular bleeding_perimenopause,Day1: very tiredDay 2: fatigue_ headache_ drowsy_ VERY vivid odd dreams_ nauseaDay 3: I debated whether or not to stop - read all reviews here and decided to try it one more night since it's a weekend and I only have 5 total pills.  I changed what I did based on what one other user reported and took it with an entire glass of water.  I don't know if that is what did the trick_ but I woke up feeling AMAZING!!  I still had the vivid dreams and also now have some breast tenderness_ but no drowsy_ fatigue_ headache or nausea.  I feel almost euphoric and at total peace.  I will take it again tonight and should I need to update this review_ I will.,,F,43,3  days100mg 1X D,2/21/2016,Prometrium
5, 1, Not menstruating/Not menopausal,Had no side effects for first 6 days_ then had stroke-like (TIA) symptoms. Blurred-vision_ loss of balance_ muscle weakness_ inability to walk or talk_ complete fog. Didn't know why. Took Prometrium on day 7-nothing. Day 8-same stroke-like symptoms. Stopped taking med_ haven't had any other episodes.,Unfortunately_ those symptoms are listed as an severe allergic reaction. ,F,47,8  days200mg,2/6/2016Email,Prometrium
6, 4, My uterine lining is too thick,Extreme drunk like feeling_ dizzy...take it before bed time. Got up to use the bathroom and walked straight into our bookcase. This medication should have a warning on the label to not drive or operate heavy machinery.,Take it before bedtime.,F,40,10  days400mg 1X D,1/27/2016,Prometrium
7, 5, Regulate cycles,The drug make me feel a little fuzzy. I also have some bloating and other gi discomfort.,I take this medication on days 17-28 of my cycle. For the first time in my life I have a regular cycle. My periods are also not as heavy. This medication has worked well for me.,F,35,10  days200,1/13/2016,Prometrium
8, 5, for migraine headaches,I would have  a migraine 24 hours before my period would start... clearly hormonal.  My naturopath put me on this and it makes all the difference!  No more migraines!,,F,47,12  years100 1X D,1/3/2016Email,Prometrium
9, 5, Perimenopause,Indigestion_ drowsiness_ leg pain.,Was prescribed 200mg but started off taking half that dose (100mg). I was getting maybe 4-6 hours of broken sleep every night_ horrible night sweats_ insomnia_ irritability_ foggy brain. Since taking Prometrium I am sleeping like a baby! It's AMAZING! I take it 30 min before bed and I'm up in the morning feeling refreshed and energetic. Hot flashes are gone. I was 3-5 lbs overweight (I am 5'3 and weighed 126 which was heavy for my frame) and I'm down 4 lbs in 2 months. No bloating. Hair is nice and thick. I swear this medication is a Godsend for me. I had a tubal ligature after my 3rd child at 32 and I haven't felt this good since before I had kids. Seems like the issue is really hitting the right dose. Taking 200 mg gave me bad indigestion and leg cramps. Since I lowered the dose it seems to be perfect. Also I think you need to give your body time to get used to it.,F,40,2  months200,12/22/2015Email,Prometrium
10, 3, Hrt,I start spotting every time I begin the 10 day cycle for the progesterone part. I thought cycling would help clear the thicker lining.I don't know what the best dosage is for me.Can I use prometrium capsules intravaginally? Would I absorb it better?,I am wondering if I am absorbing it. I have had endometrial hyperplasia with Vivelle dot.075 patch and have also been on continuous prometrium. My osteoarthritis in feet_ hands and back have increased over the last 2 yrs.I am so frustrated.,F,68,10  years100,10/17/2015Email,Prometrium
11, 1, Pre-menopausal,Dizziness_ sleepiness every day_ felt overly emotional_ unfocused.,Shortly after taking nightly dose_ I noticed my heart racing.  It was in the 130-140 bpm range and would not return to normal.  Finally had to go to ER for an intravenous dose of Lopressor to slow down the heart rate.,F,53,30  days200 mg 1X D,9/11/2015,Prometrium
12, 5, Extremely heavy bleeding_ anemia,Occasionally slightly dizzy after taking it.,I take it every few days to keep it in my system. Periods now heavy but not hemorrhaging. I cannot control it with any type of estrogen/progesterone birth control pill because of severe emotional side effects. I'm using the prometrium to try to avoid a surgery. In addition_ avoiding soy products helps.,F,50,1  years100 mg,9/7/2015,Prometrium

14, 5, Estrogen Dominance_ PMDD,1st & 2nd day dizziness_ increased ability to fall asleep(take night) Very calming_ helped quickly during the day with irritability & pmdd symptoms.,I have searched for interventions for PMDD. I found that I had very similar symptoms to estrogen dominance day 12-28. It was as if my pms started way early and my period took forever to relieve it. I would be extremely hungry_ angry_anxious_short with everyone_ gain weight_ extreme fatigue. I even thought I was Bipolar. Nope...it's balancing that good ol estrogen. Prometrium isn't able to lower current estrogen but cam help balance and that's the key. My husband and I agree it's already changed my life.,F,30,2  weeks200mg,5/5/2015Email,Prometrium
15, 1, to reestablish menstrual cycle,Fatigue_ dizziness_ feeling as if I'm drunk,Feeling lasts well beyond stopping the drugs,F,30,7  days400 mg,4/10/2015,Prometrium
16, 4, PMS/heavy period/estrogen dominance,-helps me fall asleep fast-morning wake up very groggy -during day sometimes feel very tired-minor cramping/tenderness in the uterus area at first_ since subsided,I take 25mg on days 6-14_ then 50mg days 15 to start of period before bedtime.I feel like I sleep deeper but then I wake up around 5am for some reason_ I normally can sleep through the night.  Sometimes I do feel very tired during the day_ but I think this happens when I increase to 50mg and take my dose too late the night before.No breast tenderness_ I have found it actually has helped my breast pain just before my period.  I started taking Prometrium just before my last period_ so I'm waiting for my next period to see if any changes w/ my flow_ PMS_ etc.  But overall_ I feel good on it so far.  Just notice more fatigue when I increase to 50mg and if I take it too late at night.I'm going to try to take it earlier at night_ maybe around 9pm.,M,35,1  months25mg 1X D,2/27/2015,Prometrium
17, 1, insomnia,Stroke like symptoms: unable to focus_ unable to walk.  Also expereinced painful breasts_ pain on right leg_ dizziness_ heart palpitations_ anxiety.,Warning--take upmost caution and do all research before considering this drug.  This was recommended to me by a Naturopath Doctor.  I made the mistake of not researching this drug before I took it_ and so thankful I did not start on a higher dose. I question that this drug is even on the market_ as in my opinion it should not be.,F,57,14  days100 mg 1X D,9/25/2014,Prometrium
18, 5, Menopause,Less muscle pain_ brain fog_ and improved fine motor skills / cognative function; some abdominal weight gain_ other weight gain (which I can live with since the pain and fine motor skills / cognative function have improved). I already take something to sleep (trazadone) so_ it really hasn't affected my sleep.,"Vivelle dot .50 mgs 2 X a week didn't help me very much by itself; doctor added Prometrium (100 mgs); no joy. Per ""The Estrogen Alternative: Natural Hormone Therapy with Botanical Progesterone"" [Raquel Martin]_ Progesterone ratio needs to be 125% to 1% for estrogen to be effective. Applied Prometrium topically 2 X and rotated location to areas of skin that is thin (forearm_ wrist_ tops of hands_ back of knees). Also_ now I just ""forget"" to use it; naturally cycle myself off. Interval between mood going to &^$# is getting longer and  intensity of  mood swings are less. Other things to also consider (as previously mentioned) is bio-identical thyroid medication (like Armour); and adrenal support (like Relora) and cortisol precursors like 7-keto DHEA and Pregnenolone. Yes_ I have gained weight_ but_ was not active nor eating a ""clean diet"" (craved carbs - sure sign of weak adrenals); sodium / potassium not balanced? Water retention less severe since eating 2 blended potassium rich meals every day (lots of resources for blended meals on web). And exercise has helped with burning fat. (It takes a lot more energy to burn fat after menopause -- see ""THE COMPLETE FIT or FAT"" by Covert Bailey (great section of menopause) or one of ""Zone"" exercise books / websites. You are NOT exercising as efficiently as you think you are because some exercises are not effective for burning fat as you might think!",F,55,180  days100 2X D,10/22/2013Email,Prometrium
19, 4, night sweats/peri-menopause,Drowsiness_ mild stomach cramps_ lethargy_ somewhat depressed_ mild headaches.  Had a period (I was told by my doctor that I shouldn't but it was at the beginning therefore waiting a while before worrying too much about this),I am hoping the drowsiness goes away as I am finding it hard to function. Unfortunately for me I had just started a new position and my head is in the fog.  When I first began taking it I couldn't wait to go home to go to bed.  I stopped going to the gym_ had no energy.  I have since gained weight_ mostly in the stomach area. On the upside_ since taking prometrium in combination with Estrogel_ my night sweats have all but disappeared.  I hadn't slept a full night in years.  Now I pass out before being able to count to 10.  I feel much better because I am getting some much needed sleep.  Will be taking HRT for the shortest possible length of time.  Just trying to get me through the rough spot I experienced.  Before taking HRT_ I was coping with acupuncture and homeopathic meds but in April_ the floodgates opened and my entire system just went crazy on me.  Night sweats were the worse (that and not sleeping a wink and trying to work full time).  I am going to continue taking it and hope that the negative side effects disappear after a while because the pros are better than the cons for me right now,F,52,30  days100 mg 1X D,6/20/2013Email,Prometrium
20, 4, Perimenopause,Side effects only when dosage is off. Initially I had some irritability and urinary/bladder irritation and not much help with insomnia and fatigue I was hoping for. Now that my dosage is right_ I dont have the side effects and it has helped with sleep_ bloating and fatigue.,I suggest anyone starting progesterone/prometrium start off at a low dose from compounding pharmacy. My first doctor put me on 100mg since that is the only dosage available unless you get it from compounding pharmacy. This was too high a dose and caused bad bladder irritation. I went to another doctor that prescribed progesterone in 25 mg dose so I could start out low and adjust as needed. I started on 50mg and didnt have side effects and it started helping with the bloating_ skin itching/dryness_ insomnia issues. When it started to lose efficacy_ I increased to 75mg_ and it worked well again. I am now taking 75-100 mg nightly with good results.  Helps a lot with bloating/PMS symptoms. I cant believe some doctors are starting people on 200mg -- no wonder the terrible side effects! You have to ramp up slowing with HRT as the body needs to get used to it. If you had a bad experience_ as I did initially_ I would suggest trying again starting on a low dose. It takes a good 30 days at least with all the bioidential hormone replacement for the body to adjust and it takes some tweaking. Its worth experimenting to get it right if you are having extreme perimenopausal issues as I am having. BHRT has helped my quality of life_ but it has required patience to get dosage right. Everyone is different and starting on lowest dose is best. You have to be your own doctor for the most part. Most doctors are ignorant and not very good at dealing with this issue...,F,44,6  months75-100mg 1X D,4/7/2013Email,Prometrium
21, 2, Menoupause symptoms,Racing heart_ numerous hot flashes_ insomnia_ jittery feeling into the next morning.,Tried this in combination with Divigel (estradiol) for mild menopause symptoms_ the worst of which is insomnia.  The very first night I took this I noticed side effects. It made my heart pound all night long and caused numerous hot flashes that woke me up every hour.  During the night_ I felt exausted_ dizzy and loopy yet I could not sleep.  I still felt jittery the next morning. Too afraid to feel that way another night_ so it's going right in the trash. Too bad_ because it's expensive! ,F,49,1  days100mg 1X D,2/8/2013,Prometrium
22, 3, Post menopausal symptoms,If you have side effects_ you may have high levels of progesterone due to drug-drug or drug-food interactions. DO NOT CONSUME GRAPEFRUIT PRODUCTS!,The CYP3A4 enzyme clears most of prescribed drugs (substrates) from your system. Check to see if any of your meds or supplements are CYP3A4 substrates and or if they are inhibitors of CYP3A4. Grapefruit stops the action of CYP3A4 gut enzymes completely in 30 minutes_ permanently and irreversibly. You renew the enzyme in over 24 hours_ so taking grapefruit products separately from your drugs does not help. When you can not clear substrates_ levels of them get too high and side effects_ even fatalities_ may occur. Many herbal supplements are CYP3A4 inhibitors as well. Do not take them. Ginkgo_ garlic_ turmeric_ for example. Research every substance for CYP3A4 interactions. Be well!,F,57, 100-200mg 1X D,1/27/2013Email,Prometrium
23, 1, Perimenopausal,OMG! I thought I was having a heart attack.  200mg Oral. Resting heart rate over 140 for 6-8 hours while sleeping_ over 100 the next day. Vomitting all night_ Sweating_ so weak had to be carried to bathroom. Headaches.Stopped taking immediately. Cannot imagine taking for 14 days.  Maybe it should have been a suppository at 200mg? on Estridot but goal was to create period.,,F,47,1  days200 mg 1X D,1/8/2013Email,Prometrium
24, 5, menopause,No adverse side effects observed,Sleep_ glorious sleep! I'm fairly certain this is the first time I have experienced a full night of uninterrupted sleep in over a year. I also have a greater sense of well-being. Very pleased indeed and hope I can take it forever!,F,51,7  days100 1X D,8/31/2012,Prometrium
25, 3, PCOS,"Extreme dizziness_ ""drunk"" feeling_ constant headache_ lethargy_ uncontrollable crying_ difficulty concentrating",I hate having to take it_ but it works in terms of helping me have a period. The first 2-3 days are the absolute worst. I can barely get out of bed and when I do_ I walk around in a daze and anything will make me cry. I tried the 100 mg dosage which had less severe side effects_ but I had to take them for a longer period of time (which I didn't like). So_ I sucked it up and went for the 200mg. I take it before bed to help with the dizziness_ but it still lingers the following day.,F,32,12  days200mg 1X D,8/31/2012Email,Prometrium

28, 1, menopauase with premarin,Nausea every day_ stomach irritation_ constipation_ HEADACHE_ pain in calves_ blurred vision_ sore _enlarged breasts.,It is hard to know for sure which drug is causing all these problems_ but I think it is the prometrium_ for the nausea and headache. It helped my depression_ but I can't tolerate the side effects at this time.  Will quit both and start to get rid of the side effects/,F,50,60  days100mg 1X D,8/7/2012Email,Prometrium

30, 3, Low Progesterone/TTC,Have to drink with a lot of water or it feels like it is sitting in my throat.  Then I start to feel jumpy and tingly_ eyes feel puffy- I just feel off after taking it.  Heart flutters also.  I do not feel sleepy after taking it_ but dr. told me to take it before bed.  Lay awake for a while.  Then I have really weird and vivid dreams of people_ places or thoughts from the day before.  Wake up after 5 hours in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. Do not feel tired in the morning.  I think it has opposite effect on me- makes me hyper.  Not loving this but taking it to higher progesterone levels and in case I do concieve.  I take it starting the third day after ovulation through day 12_ and I assume will cont. if get a PPT.,,F,28,4  days200 1X D,7/19/2012,Prometrium
31, 4, Panhypopituitarism,Strange dreams.  In this 3rd  week of taking_ I'm watching my stomach distend like a basketball.  I am hoping this is temporary.,Since becoming panhypopituitary (due to surgeries) in my 30's I lost all my hormones.  I had to replace and balance so many other hormones and vitamin deficiencies that the doctors were not ready to deal with the female hormones until everythign else was balanced.  That took almost seven years... seven years I would not wish on my worst enemy.  In my first week on this 100mg of Progesterone and an estrogen patch I felt like myself for the first time in years.  I slept without waking up 6 or 8 times like I had been doing and I could THINK clearly.  All the awful night sweats stopped and all the uncharacteristic despair and crying went away.  I no longer felt cold_ old and tired 24/7 and wan't getting flustered over stupid little things.  I even got a sense that my libido was returning.  All was wondeful but now it's the third week and I can no longer get into any of my pants.  If I see myself sideways in a mirror it looks like I swallowed a basketball.  I also could not sleep at all last night with those old aches and pains and woke up to two pimples and I haven't had a pimple since I was a teen.  I REALLY hope this is a temporary glitch because those 15 days/nights of feeling like my normal self again were the best gift I've ever received.,F,45,17  days100mg 1X D,6/29/2012,Prometrium
32, 5, perimenopause_ bleeding_ anxiety,In the beginning - lethargy_ depression_ drowsiness_ breast tenderness,The side effects were in the 1st month only. Now I take Prometrium 100 mg 12-14 days a month_ vaginally_ before going to bed. In the beginning I had to use some Estrogel to get out of the depression_ However using Estrogel led to extra bleeding/ spotting and anxiety_ so now I am using Prometrium only.Lack of progesterone in the perimenopause is the reason women get anxious because of estrogen fluctuations_ (Natural) progesterone down-regulates estrogen receptors thus reducing this sensitivity and diminishing anxiety.One more comment: progesterone creams and gels did not help me at all_ since progesterone_ unlike Estrogel_ is not absorbed by my skin. Vaginal way is the best way to take it_ also for endometrium protection.,F,49,3  months100 1X D,5/4/2012,Prometrium
33, 1, insomnia,Put on this by my naturopath so I assumed it was safe.  Foolish me!  Slept terrible and woke up with a raging headache_ nauseated and just feeling very strange.  Decided that since I don't tolerate meds well_ it isn't worth feeling awful 24/7 just to try to sleep better.  Threw it away and will never try HRT again--will go back to using my natural progesterone cream that doesn't have any side-effects.,,F,56,1  days100 mg 1X D,4/11/2012Email,Prometrium

My symptoms with irritability and emotional lability at a #10. All gone now.   the severe hot flashes are gone. (I think that is the patch and not the Prometrium that took the hot flashes away???)  The wakening at night from the hot flashes is gone.  The vaginal dryness and dry skin are not.  Lots of lubs on the market though.  The one thing that continues is the awakening at night.  I also have difficulty falling asleep immediately now it takes up to one hour to fall asleep.  stopped all caffeine for 30 days and the problems with sleep still continue.

The first day was ok but after 3 days (thanksgiving)I ended up on the emergency room. The doctors did all sorts of invasive tests trying to figure out what was wrong. I was put on iv and felt better. Now it's been 6 days and I feel even worst. Just read these comments and I am going to stop right now.,F,46,10  days100 1X D,11/29/2010,Prometrium

Hair & skin also better_ along w/mood adjustment.,Previously was on 200mg for 10days/mo_ but then somehow I began bleeding thru out. Hoping the 100mg will work_ but I do still have monthly periods & may have to adjust dosage (wondering if 200mg for part of the month & then 100mg per symptoms might work-?). I do also use the vivelle patch 2x wk. For the yoga instructor who had problems w/200mg_ perhaps her dosage is too high & should ask her doc about 100mg?

104, 4, sustain pregnancy,VERY tired_ dizzy_ nauseated_ headaches,My first pregnancy ended in miscarriage at about 7 weeks. For my second pregnancy_ my Dr. put me on progesterone (vaginal) 50 mg once per day due to low progesterone and I delivered a healthy boy. I did not have side effects. For my third pregnancy_ I was on progesterone (vaginal) 50 mg twice a day and again_ no side effects. I delivered a healthy girl. This time around_ I had to go up to 200 mg twice a day orally. I'm at 10 weeks now with my pregnancy and hoping my OB takes me off of this soon. I am EXTREMELY tired all the time_ have a hard time functioning at work. Also quite nauseated. I am thankful that we have this drug though and that my Dr. believes in using it to sustain early pregnancy.

Stomach pain and indigestion too,I was instructed to take this medicine at bedtime for the 1st 10 days of the month and then after that I was told I would get my period and I'm supposed to take it for 3 months.  In addition to the side effects_ I got my period before I was done taking the medicine_ which defeats the purpose of trying to regulate my periods.

Then I looked up possible side effects and it says ""can cause viral infection""...so I know this drug was the culprit.  I'm just glad I looked up side effects and got off it.  Side effects are also depression and worry.  I do not typically suffer from either_ and I was paranoid and crying a LOT.

119, 4," to stop ""hot flashes""",Elevated blood pressure_ dizziness (especially after sleep)_ bloating_ lack of energy_ mild headaches_ leg cramps at night,After complaining about the more frequent severe night sweats (hysterectomy in 2007)_ I took a saliva test that showed my progesterone level was low.  Already wearing a low dose estrogen patch_ my doctor prescribed Prometrium to balance out my hormone levels.  The night sweats ended almost immediately_ but gradually the other symptoms began.  Until today while having a procedure at a Surgical Center did I suspect this drug as causing the problems I am encountering.  My BP has always been 115-120/75-80.  I had not had my BP checked since I began taking Prometrium until 4 or 5 weeks ago.  I was shocked at the readings.  Most days now_ it's anywhere from 134-155/80-85.  The other effects began about 2-3 weeks after I began Prometrium but I just didn't make the connection until today.  I did forget to take the Prometrium last night and will certainly FORGET it from now on.

The texture of my hair has improved_ but I still notice hair loss. I'm wondering if the progesterone has a slow buildup and I need to be patient?

121, 4, IVF treatment_ trying to concieve,At first I believe this made me feel a little tired and spaced out. As time has gone on_ it has subsided. (I am still on the same dosage taken vaginally) Based on all of the reviews that I have read_ I believe that some women taking this for trying to conceive could have some of the symptoms confused with an early pregnancy that hasn't been detected. For example_ sore breasts shouldnt come from progesterone but from estrogen. I am now 5 weeks pregnant_ and I am not even sure if those are the true side effects that I was feeling from the prometrium. I am also on a intra-muscular shot of progesterone oil_ every other day. All in all_ I think side effects have been mild_ if at all.,I ordered some additional prometrium from an online Canandian pharmacy_ that did require a prescription. It was alot less expensive. They had told me that the only 200mg capsule was only manufactured in the US and India. My shipment came from India_(which I was aware of)and its name is Naturogest on the label_ with prometrium also in smaller print on it. I did some online research and it does say the it is the same medication but with a different name. It is also packaged differently and the pill is shaped a little different. It says that you can take it orally or vaginally_ which I thought was strange. I don't think the prometrium that I bought here can be taken orally. Any feedback would be appreciated if you know about this. I still feel a little uneasy about it. Slighlty off topic_ but relevant_ I read that taking prometrium orally isnt as effective or as good for you. Your liver filters out most of the benefits?,F,34,23  days400mg 2X D,9/23/2010Email,Prometrium

I could feel the effects just one day after taking the pill: my breasts were no longer heavy and tender.  My water retention went down significantly and no more discharge.  My husband told me that my mood improved. I took Prometrium at night and I could stay up for an hour afterward without feeling drowsy or extremely tired. I finished the 14-day prescription Thursday night and thought I would wait a week to discuss with my doctor about my Prometrium experience.  Not sure if it's psychological or not_ I began to feel anxious and moody by Saturday morning_ just 24 hours off Prometrium.  This is now Sunday evening and I have been feeling depressed and I don't feel like doing anything_ not event spending time with our 8-year-old son.I know I will be at my doctor's office first thing Tuesday morning_ after the long weekend_ to talk to him about the possibility of getting refills.

I cannot take this drug during the day_ it makes me too sleepy. It seems to have increased the bleeding instead of stopping it. I have been a sleepwalker all of my life_ but I've had 2 episodes in 14 days. This side effect was not even mentioned by the dr_ I had to read about it on the net.

No dizziness or ANY side effects. It works and I am not taking estrogen with it_ so it is safer. I am taking 14 days on_ 14 days off and period starts within that first week that I am off.

It came on slowly but then when it hit it was hard.  Quit taking it Saturday and I am still down and it is Monday,Stopped the bleeding I was continuously having but would have rather had that than the emotional side effects.

I do not like the discharge from and wear pantyliners doc said it is the unabsorbed portion of the capsule that is why it is yellowish.

Before taking this I had two heavy periods in a month followed by none for 2 months_ then spot thru bleeding for a month_ followed by constant period for weeks.

151, 5, Horrible PMS symptoms,None whatsoever,I was really wary of even taking this medication after I had read so many negative reactions to the med but I was willing to try anything to relieve my symptoms and I am sure glad I took a chance and have been taking it from Day 16-22 from the first day of my period. I felt the effects right away and while I usually suffered extreme headaches_ brain fog_ body aches and felt completely miserable for a week prior to my period_ after taking the med I slept very well_ felt very calm which was a huge relief since I usually get very depressed_ my mood was better_ i was more energetic (a good thing considering I could barely get out of bed for days prior to my period. I did get my period sooner taking this med and it was a little heavy the first day but I had my period for a shorter duration of time (2-3 days) I usually get crazy cravings for sweets and carbs and I found that the med suppressed my appetite for those things..I experienced no weight gain. I love it and will continue to take it. I feel badly for those who had negative experiences with this medication but I would encourage anyone to at least try it to see how it works for you because you may have a a very positive result with it.

I would fall asleep quickly_ but wake up agitated and irritated.  At 12 weeks pregnant (and I spent a great amount of money to get pregnant) I walked into an abortion clinic and had an abortion.

So far_ the only side effect I seem to have is that I wake up with a mild headache which seems to go away by mid-morning.

I was having hot flashes at least 3 times per hour that would induce sweat on my chest which was very uncomfortable. I might have 1 or 2 hot flashes per day now_ but not even sure as they are so mild. It was felt that I was estrogen dominant which was causing the hot flashes_ so I am not taking with any estrogen replacement.

Haven't seen anyone saying that.,I went to a GYN specialist as my pain and bleeding were so bad.  I sometimes couldn't leave the house for fear of bleeding all over.  Thought I was going to have to have lazer surgery to clean out inside.  However_ since being on prometrium these symptoms have gone away.  I haven't had any of the other symptoms that people are talking about and now am post-menopausal.  I still have at least one or two hot flashes in the middle of the night_ but so much better than every hour and full blown sweats.  Moodiness is better although i still have it.

175, 5, induce a period,minimal side effects...some bloating,Wow...reading this page sure freaked me out about this drug_ especially since I am drug-sensitive and tend to get side effects when I take most medications.  I took 200mg of this at night.  I didn't notice any sleepyness but since I went right to bed_ it wouldn't have mattered.  If anything_ I'd say the progesterone has a nice_ calming effect which aids in sleep.  I had some bloating right away (good for my breasts_ bad for my stomach_ lol).  I haven't finished my 10 days_ so I don't know if this will make me get my period (I haven't had one for 5 months now--eeks!)  Even if it doesn't_ I haven't had bad side effects from this drug_ and it's going to help me figure out another line of treatment if it doesn't end up working (inducing a period).I realize some of the reviews on this page can be scary_ but everyone is different and you never know--you could get lucky like me. :),F,27,10  days200mg 1X D,2/25/2010Email,Prometrium

Many of my symptoms were confusing b/c they are similar to my pregnancy symptoms.,I started taking Prometrim the day I was ovulating;they put me on 200 mg. once a day. I was prescribed it due to two miscarriages and a low progesterone level. I've had cramping that felt like I was going to start_ but I never would start. I started when I was supposed to start_ the 28th day of my cycle. When I got my period_ I spotted for 2 days_ had heavy flow for 2 days and now I've had 4 days of additional spotting.

Some months are more successful than others for side effects and flow.  I started on 100mg days 14-28 of my cycle_ but this was not enough to ease the flow on the third cycle.  Then took 400mg days 14-28 for two cycles.  That was great_ eased the flow very well. Now am down to 200mg with cycles coming closer together by 3 days each cycle.

183, 4, To sustain a pregnancy,Tired_ vaginal dryness_ increase in BBT and thirsty are the main side effects. I'm not experiencing any of the severe ones_ thank goodness.,I had 2 miscarriages (one in Feb 09 and the second Nov 09). Both were unexplained and since my insurance won't pay for tests until there are 3 miscarriages_ I wanted to try to avoid another m/c if I could possibly do so. Taking prometrium (400mg a night) was an option that could possibly help_ so I am trying it this go-around. I'm taking it day 14-28 or so...take a hpt and if positive stay on it_ if negative stop taking until day 14 again. I'm in the 2-week wait window_ so I'm a little nervous (or A LOT nervous is more like it). I do think that given my age (38) and my thyroid condition (hypo-thyroid/hashimotos) I am definately lacking the progesterone I need to carry out a pregnancy. I feel it in my gut! I'm guessing I have enough to get pregnant because I have been able to get preg right away...which is great news for a 38 year old! Baby dust to me & DH!

It would have been very helpful for the Dr. to tell me to take this before bed rather than morning_ or for it to be listed on the bottle.

I took first capsule at 13 weeks pregnant_ and have now been on prometrium 3 weeks with no noticeable side effects other than relaxed_ sleepy feeling after my first two evening doses.

It all started when I stopped using the Nuvaring. I had very regular periods before I used birth control and while on it. We have been trying to conceive.  I finished my last dose 2 weeks ago_ and still no period_ so I called my doctor and am waiting to see what she recommends to do.

He's 11 mos now and I am 4 wks preg now and on Prometrium again. The listed side effects could be preg related I just pray they hear a heartbeat at my next appt as the drug could delay a miscarriage if one in fact already occured. I have full faith in this drug and hope I NEVER have to go down that dark road again of miscarriage.The only poss side effects in my son are he has red hair and noone in the family does and a bit of a drama queen!!!But is walking and using words already!,M,30,12  weeks,11/9/2009Email,Prometrium
196, 5, Menopause,No side effects,I was suffering severe night sweats_ anxiety_ restless leg_ extremely poor sleep_ headaches_ depression_ hair loss_ carb cravings_ poor diet cravings...comfort food.I have hypothyroid as well.  Have been miserable for 7 years...period stopped and obgyn suggested prometrium and menest.  AMAZING!  That is all I can say.  I have not felt this good in at least 7 years.  I sleep like a rock and am functioning better in every way.,F,49,60  days,11/7/2009Email,Prometrium
197, 3, PMDD/PMS,HEADACHES,HOPING THIS WILL WORK HAVE TIRED EVERTHING FOR PMS_ I AM HUNGRY/GRAVING FOR FOODS BUT HAVE ALOT OF FRUIT IN THE HOUSE REFUSE TO GAIN WEIGHT_ I THINK ONCE YOU KEEP IN MIND ITS THE PIL THAT IS MAKING YOU HUNGRY DO NOT GIVE IN TO IT AND WORKOUT I HOPW WITH ALL THIS THE PIL WORKS FOR ME ALOT OF FINGERS CROSSED,F,43,8  days,11/1/2009,Prometrium
198, 2, Period Regulation,First day I was extremely tired all day. Moderate irritability throughout and since I finished taking it (aware of it and it has been pretty bad_ but I don't snap at every little thing). I didn't notice an increase in appetite while I was on it_ but I have definitely experienced an increase since I finished taking it (over 2 weeks ago).,I took Prometrium because I have never been regular and after I tried Depo and stopped using it_ I was even more irregular with different colors and consistencies to boot!The Prometrium was supposed to make me have a period 2 weeks after I finished it so that I would start being regular_ but it failed at that and things have stayed pretty much the same.One positive mark though: side-effects much milder than with Loestrin24.,F,20,12  days,10/29/2009Email,Prometrium
199, 4, symptoms of perimenopause,,I have terrible night sweats & occas. hot flashes but my biggest complaints were mental fogginess and irritability.  After reading other comments on the site about Prometriun and dosages_ I decided to start at 100mg.  It reduced the frequency of my night sweats 60-70%_ hot flashes 50%.  Mental clarity improved 50%_ but the biggest improvement was my mood.  Irritability gone!! So I upped the dose to 200mg to see if I could get more relief from the other symptoms.  After 1 month at 200mg there was no further improvement and my mood went to hell!!  I dropped back to 100mg and mood greatly improved again.  Best way I can describe it is_ Prometrium gives me a much longer fuse and my husband is thankful.  100mg is the right dose for me.,F,40,3  months,10/23/2009,Prometrium
200, 1, Eliminate Period (cramps_ PMS),Extremely painful nipples_ neck/shoulder pain_ increased anxiety and irritability to the point of rage_ gut pain and bloating_ severe fatigue_ inability to focus_ but the worst: food cravings!,Doctors don't have a clear picture of all the effects Prometrium causes.  This should never be prescribed to middle aged women who have struggled with weight gain!  I've been on this for 1 month and have gained 4 lbs; I was weight stable and losing before this prescription. The side effects are far worse than what the drug was prescribed for.  I'm going to start taking Omega 3 Fatty Acids (12_000 mg/day) since I understand it gets rid of severe cramps w/in 3 months.,F,47,1  months,10/18/2009,Prometrium
201, 5, PMS_ Postpartum Depression,Tiredness_ some bloating,Be careful about what you read on the Internet.  This medication has also saved me numerous times.  I have low progesterone in my cycles from PCOS.  Had severe postpartum depression with 2nd child_ a bout of it over 2 years ago and now with 3rd.  Couldn't sleep hardly at all_ not even with sleep medications.   The prometrium each month_ while makes me tired_ helps me to feel very calm and sleepy.  I love it.  I've tried compounded shots and oral prog. but none work as good as Prometrium for me - it is the only FDA approved natural progesterone.  Everyone is different so I guess you just have to see for yourself.,F,31,2  years,10/13/2009,Prometrium
202, 2, postmenopause,Was taking 200mg prometrium in combination with 2mg of estradiol daily.  The good news: after 7 days_ the intensity of hot flashes was greatly reduced.  Bad news:  after 14 days_ started developing severe muscle pain on one side of my body and especially bad in the calf of my leg.  Decided to quit.,,F,52,16  days,10/3/2009Email,Prometrium
203, 1, maintain pregnancy (1st trimester),VERY dizzy_ headaches_ coughing_ blurred vision_ weakness,I began taking this drug at 6 weeks during my last pregnancy which ended in miscarriage.  I began taking it this time at 1 day past ovulation.,F,33,5  days,9/24/2009,Prometrium
204, 3, sustain pregnancy,dizziness_ lightheadedness_ extreme fatigue_ no energy_ moodiness,I didn't know what was wrong with me until I read this website and saw all of the same symptoms I had with the others that have taken Prometrium.  I have been unable to do anything and barely function for the last week.  My doctor confirmed that my symptoms are probably from being 8 wks pregnant and being on 200 mg/day.  I have had low progesterone with a couple other pregnancies that resulted in miscarriages_ so I'm going to keep on it for another 2-3 weeks_ perhaps cut the dosage - hoping to feel better soon_ but mainly want the pregnancy to continue.,F,41,12  days,9/21/2009,Prometrium
205, 5, irregular periods,I had some insomnia the first cycle.  I'm on my 2nd cycle  and haven't had the insomnia but last night I had the strangest feeling.  I was off balance and the out-of-body experience others mentioned is probably the best description.  It was the first time I had taken it and not gone straight to bed.  It was probably an hour or so after taking the 200mg nightly dose that this occurred.  I also had diarrhea just before these other symptoms and I had eaten something after taking the dose.,I'm on my 2nd cycle of 3 cycles.  12 pills every 30 days for 3 months.  I've taken 2 pills in this 2nd cycle.,F,42,1  months,9/20/2009,Prometrium
206, 4, prevent miscarriage,Sore nipples. Cramps. Bit tired. Bloated. Whitish discharge.,Taking Prometrium X2 a day 200mg vaginally. I'm 42years old and wasn't very optimistic because of my age and statistics. I had 1 previous miscarriage a few years ago at 38. My uterine lining was just ok then. I wasn't taking Prometrium at the time. I had an IUI 17days ago and just confirmed that I'm indeed pregnant. I am choosing to stay on it until my 1st trimester is over. It's not a very comfortable to take but i really feel like it's helping. My nipples were sore but that is a side effect of Prometrium. I just found out I'm pregnant. A small clue of pregnancy was that my breast were showing signs of being fuller. No bleeding at implantation but a bit stronger cramps at the time. (used Chlomid n Gonal pre-IUI) I pray this is for real. There's hope_ Hang in there!,F,42,17  days,9/16/2009,Prometrium
207, 5, progesterone hormone replacement,None- I feel great on it. I take 100 bid.,This is reportedly bioidentical progesterone. I take 100 mg bid_ a continuous therapy regimen. My estrogen replacement is vivelle dot .050. Both are great and I feel terrific on them.  I personally wanted to stay clear of the synthetic progestins and their side effects.,F,50,3  years,9/13/2009,Prometrium
208, 4, Sustain pregnancy,Drowsy after taking the dosage at night. Helps me fall asleep quickly but then after 3-4 hours I am spending sleepless nights.  I feel depressed and dizzy most of the time. I don't like the drug but it has saved my two pregnancy and I am hopeful it will work this time too.,I had 2 miscarriages due to lack of progesterone in my first trimester. My new high risk pregnancy doctor prescribed me prometrium 200 mgs for the entire first trimester. I had two viable pregnancies since. I am pregnant again and taking the prometrium again. However_ I spotted recently due to a tear in my placenta so doctor has increased the dosage to 200mgs of prometrium twice a day.,F,35,3  months,9/1/2009,Prometrium
209, 5, irregular periods,tender breasts_ abdominal cramping and bloating,Well my side effects have been minimal in comparison to the benefits it has delivered. I have irregular periods (possibly 3 - 4 annually)and we are trying to conceive. I have a very stressful career and home can be hectic most of the time due to various schedules_ children activites and volunteer activities to boot! My stress level has decreased tremendously! I wake up with more energy and ready to take on the day. I was prescribed 200mg once a day taken at bedtime for 10 days. My outlook on life is optimistic and my co-workers have commented on my energy and smile :). Not necessarily a draw back but it knocks me out cold within 20 minutes and I sleep soundly. Sore breasts and the first five days_ cramps felt like contractions (days 7 - 10). Finished 10 days as prescribed yet 14 days later still no period. I was told my period should start within 14 days of the last dosage. So_ I am back to the lab for more blood work. If it was not for the fact we are trying to have a baby_ I could take this medication every day!,F,39,10  days,8/25/2009,Prometrium
210, 5, Pmdd_ heavy and painful periods,Breast swelling_ headaches,"I love this drug.  It saved my life.  They put me on head meds for two years trying to""fix "" me. I kept telling them it was hormones_ not head problems_ that were causing the paranoia_ stress_ anxiety and phobias that were developing so that I could not leave my house for two weeks out of the month.  I was such a mess and out of hope before I flew to maine (from the west coast) to see a doctor that specialized in female probs).  I was suicidal from trying so many meds that just made everything worse.  The prometrium changed my life.  I can function normally and realize when the mood shift happens (ovulation) it's time to start taking two pills in the morning and two at night.  Amazing.  I can live with the sore breast (I had to invest in some serious bras though) and the head aches (suboxicipital tension).  A little physical discomfort is well worth the internal relief.  I've been taking it over a year and love it.",F,39,1.5  years,8/21/2009,Prometrium
211, 3, irregular_ heavy bleeding,Severe weepiness/moodiness_ constant pain in back and sharp pain under ribs on right side (more severe at night after taking my pill). My inability to fall asleep increased and tossing/turning increased.,It did straighten out my irregular bleeding and lessened the heaviness of the bleeding_ but not sure if the trade off of wanting to do bodily harm to others is worth it. Will be looking for other treatment options.,F,38,28  days,8/11/2009,Prometrium
212, 2, Difficult_ Irregular Periods,Extraordinary leg pain_ monster cramps_ weepy_ clingy_ zero energy_ increased appetite.,"I was told to take it at night because it was supposed to make me sleepy_ but I didn't notice that it did. It seemed to me that my insomnia was worse. I had increased appetite_ but nothing I would eat seemed to satisfy my - it was never the ""right"" thing. I would cry at the drop of a hat and the next moment be so angry I wanted to throw something. I was under the impression that hormone therapy was supposed to make these issues BETTER not worse.  Not impressed. I am taking it for 10 days beginning 10 days after the first day of my period.  I have only been through one cycle of it_ but if this time around is no better_ I'll be asking for something different.",F,39,10  days,8/10/2009,Prometrium
213, 3, To induce periods,worry/anxious_crying/deppressed_moody_ Tippsy feeling_ bloated_ headaches,I Take 200 mg at night days 1-15.

217, 4, peri-menopausal moodiness,I have been taking 100mg of prometrium at bedtime for last two weeks of my cycle since April 2009.I have noticed( and my family has noticed) a big improvement in my premenstrual moodiness. I sleep well at night and feel calm and focused in the day.,Not sure how long I will take but as my physician says during the perimenopausal phase_ you try something_ if it works...great.If not_ try something new because your hormones are changing and nothing is constant during this time.,F,46,4  months,7/16/2009,Prometrium
218, 5, to increase progesterone in preg,COMFORTABLE! So relaxed! Hot and cold on and off_ but that could just be the pregnancy. Overall_ just want to sleep. It is a nice_ relaxing feeling.,I appreciate what this drug has done so far. We were in fear of a 5th miscarriage_ and next week I will start my second trimester.,F,28,1  months,7/15/2009,Prometrium
219, 4, to induce ovulation;  TTC,a little bit of tiredness after taking_ mild cramping_ nothing very serious,I am currently on my second month of prometrium.  I had failed to ovulate or have a period from Feb. to May (my periods have always been sporadic) so my doc suspected I was low in progesterone. I ovulated and had a period in June and I have ovulated in July so hopefully this will help us concieve.  I take 200mg at night for days 1 thru 10 of each month and go to sleep soon after. I wanted to post to ease some minds that not everyone has horrible side effects ( I was a little nervous before I started taking it).  Please let me know if anyone has had success concieving with only prometrium.,F,28,2  months,7/9/2009,Prometrium
220, 5, Luteal Phase Defect- Infertility,Dizziness_ tiredness_ laid-back feeling_ euphoria_ drunk feeling_ totally mellow,I love this stuff!!!!  I look forward to the time after I ovulate and can take my pink pills.  I am on 100mg 2x per day (I take mine morning and evening) and I feel terrific!  I've been on it 2 cycles and it has increased my luteal phase from 11 days to 13 or 14 (which is normal).  I love this stuff and feel silly and giddy after I take some of the doses-- like a good buzz only without all the side effects the next day!,F,38,2  months,7/6/2009,Prometrium
221, 3, To stop my period,Extreme exhaustion_ irritability_ possible weight gain,I am taking 200mg 2x/day. My period was still happening after 18 days. Since I am having an HSG my next cycle_ it was imparative to stop the bleeding so that I would know when my next cycle started. The first couple of days I felt fine_ but about 3 days into it_ I started to feel extremely tired to the point that I can barely function at work and I'm falling asleep by 5pm. Since I have to take it twice a day_ I have to take a dose in the morning and in the evening--I imagine the exhaustion wouldn't be so bad if I could only take it before bed. I would have rated it higher if not for the side effects--my bleeding stopped within two days.,F,25,10  days,7/6/2009,Prometrium
222, 4, IVF-ICSI between ER and ET,Slight cramping and a little bit tender breasts.,I'm only taking this drug for 3 days between my egg retrieval and my egg transfer. I take 200mg 3x per day vaginally. I also have 3 Climara (Estradiol) patches on_ so they might influence the whole thing too. The day after the egg transfer I will not take preometrium any more but will switch to a progesterone gel  (Crinone 8%).,F,29,3  days,6/5/2009,Prometrium

I hope this works and makes my period come_ I can't imagine having to take this over & over again.,F,28,10  days,6/1/2009,Prometrium
224, 3, Induce period,VERY BAD diarrhea_ vomiting_ severe cramping_ extremely tired. Dosage was 200 mg 2x per night,I took this med this time last year (May) to induce my period. I took it for 3 days and started. I had a period every month until Dec. Then I had 2 days of spotting while on vacation in Feb and nothing since. I had the left over meds and took them 2 days ago. The first day was fine. Took it at bedtime with no food. Last night I took it with some cereal before bed and I have NEVER experienced worse diarrhea nausea or cramping. And as gross as it sounds_ I had a jelly-like clear anal discharge. I am not going to take it tonight and just keep my fingers crossed that what I did take_ works.,F,32,2  days,5/30/2009,Prometrium
225, 1, menstrual problems,Extreme irritability_ very tender breasts_ acne_bloated_ not able to sleep longer than 5 hours a night_constipation_lethargic,My doctor prescribed prometrium 200 mg for 12 days due to my periods being heavy for years to just spotting a few days a month and I told her I am very irritable for PMS and was needing something to help with that.Anyhow_ I am not one to ever experience side effects and am a very happy go lucky person_but the first thing I noticed in the first few days was_ the pills did help with going to sleep but that has never been an issue for me_but I was not able to get my full 8 hours of sleep. I would wake up wide awake after 5 hours of sleep and be exhausted all day. I then had very tender breasts and even after being off the pills a few days_ they're very tender still. Wow_ my irritability on these pills got so bad_ my husband thought I turned into such a nasty person that he left me after a few days of being on prometrium. It finally took coming off the medication to make him realize the pills completely changed my personality. So I would consider very hard before taking these medications because it is 10 times worse than PMS and that's no exaggeration and is not worth a marriage. It did help my face to be much smoother but I did break out with acne and I have never been one to break out. I wish my doctor would've tried a different medicine than this. It's definitely not worth all of the side effects_ especially the extreme irritability that can cause someone to act like a crazy woman and completely change their personality. I still have yet to get my period but  my doctor says to,F,30,12  days,5/30/2009Email,Prometrium

227, 4, PCOS and TTC,Extreme tiredness_ abdominal cramping_ diarrhea_ irritability_ body aches,My doctor put me on 200mg once a day for 7 days to induce my period since I do not ovulate regularly due to PCOS.  I am to start Clomid on day 3 of my cycle for 5 days.

228, 1, post menopausal estrogen dominance,EXTREME blaoting_ insomnia_ irritability_painful shoulders and arms_ shortness of breath_ chest heaviness_ anxiety_ panic_ headaches,the side effects happened to me about 10 days in to taking prometrium.  I have been on bioidentical progesterone for 3 years and did wonderfully. My doctor wanted to try Prometrium with me because of the higher dosage.  It was a disturbing change for me-I was so uncomfortable and felt so sick. I barely was able to perform my work becuase of headaches and severe bloating.,F,40,14  days,5/13/2009,Prometrium
229, 5, perimenopause symptoms,It made me feel dizzy. However_ this is a side effect that is clearly exlained in writing so I knew what I was getting into. My Endocrinologist told me to take it before bedtime to help me sleep through the night. I have the greatest sleeps now.,Love the stuff. I take it 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off and feel horrible when I'm off it. I was constantly exhausted_ no energy_ hot flashes_ bad adult acne and absolutely no sleep at all.

My period has lasted 18 days!  After being on the 200 mg_ my flow slowed to spotting_ but came back heavier after 5 days_ so I was put on 400 mg_ and it seems to be stopping the bleeding and cramping.  I am very tired on it though_ and thankfully my husband is home during the night to take care of the children_ because I don't hear them when they wake since I have been on this stuff.,F,39,7  days,4/7/2009,Prometrium

I have been cramping like my body was trying to start but nothings happened so far. This is the second time I have not had my periods after being diagnosed with PCOS a few years back. When I have my period its normal for like a long time and always on time.. and then all of a sudden I will just quit haveing my period for like months on end. This is the first time for me taking prometrium though. Before when I went without a period I took glucophage for a few months and then I started my period again. So I am wondering if I should go back on the glucophage? Hopefully I will start soon and hopefully get back to normal for a while.,F,34,10  days,3/20/2009Email,Prometrium

241, 3, Help pregnancy through In-Vitro,I take 2 200mg pills orally at night for 10 days. I started on day 3 of my cycle per Doc. The first morning_ I could barely get out of bed and experienced a headache like a migraine all day - went to bed early and slept it off - the next 9 days have shown no headaches or sleepyness during the day. I sleep really well at night.  Side effect is that I have been spotting every other day - I never really ended my period.,My usual periods are 4-6 days. Taking Prometrium has made period continue until day 14. Doc says that this will help flush my lining so my next ovulation and IVF will be a success. My natural periods occur every 45-48 days but Clomid has helped get them to 28-30 days. We are on our 9th try at IVF so hopefully this will work.,F,31,14  days,2/21/2009,Prometrium

There's only one thing I like about this horrid drug_ and that is that I sleep great. The problem is I feel like sleeping all the time. I'm functioning at about 20% of my usual capacity. I was so desperate by the 2nd week that I went to a highly recommended Chinese acupuncturist-herbalist. I've gone every week for 5 weeks and it has helped ease the symptoms_ most significantly the depression. Sadly_ acupuncture is prohibitively expensive but there's no question it works. Highly recommended_ but it will empty your wallet. I'm also taking vitamins and green drinks and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. All that helps_ but this drug is hardcore.

My bloating is gone and I feel thinner. I am not so moody in the daytime. Although if I start to cry_ I cry more_ but I am aware. I experienced smoother stools and gassiness_ but from my previous constipation. This has been helpful. I did notice hemorrhoids last night. So I will watch this a bit more. I am also a bit more hyperactive personality so this drug has helped me slow down. I like it overall....we will see after a few more months. Then I will have another blood test during ovulation and see if it is doing it's job. I seem to see a trend here in these posts; most women taking 200 mg see heavier side effects. I wonder if decreasing the mg would help or splitting it up in the day would help. Good luck.,F,35,7  days,11/6/2008,Prometrium

Of course_ you and your doctor know what is best for you_ but you know your body better than anyone else_ so be in tune with your symptoms.  It does make me a bit dizzy once I get into the second week of it._ but I take it at night_ so therefore_ I get some much needed sleep....MENOPAUSE SUX.....AND I HATE EVE.....I am loving not having anymore bleeding_ I think I was almost ready for a transfusion.  I had switched doctors and my new doctor gave me this before scheduling a hysterectomy for me._ which i think i will not have to undergo now_ since my bleeding has stopped and not returned.

I've spent huge amounts of time and money trying to resolve these problems_ but both stopped almost immediately when a GYN started me on Prometrium 100mg before bed.  Her premise was that the estrogen I take for severe hot flashes (I use a Femring) was overstimulating me and that it needed to be balanced by the calming effects of progesterone.  I stopped the Prometrium for a couple of weeks because of cost and side effects (actually very tolerable relative to panic and insomnia!)_ but the original problems returned with a vengeance.

My progesterone was never tested before I miscarried_ but I know in my heart that low progesterone was the cause. So when I got pregnant again_ my Dr. actually tested my progesterone and it was 10 -- it should be AT LEAST 15 (preferably 20) to sustain a pregnancy. He immediately put me on Prometrium (I had started to spot bleed again - first sign of miscarriage)_ and after ONE dose the bleeding stopped and my level went up to 21. It's hard to know whether it was the Prometrium making me feel bad the first trimester_ or just generally being pregnant.

I liked that dosage because I got my period just as they said_ a day or two after my last dose. My periods were heavier than on YAZ_ but they removed me from that due to high blood pressure. At a checkup_ my Dr. was concerned about the dose amount so put me on 200 mgs. I had break through bleeding so she bumped it back up. I had about 6 great months and my theory is that as the YAZ got out of my system_ my period went wack-a-do again. I am getting my period later and later the last few months. One month I waited 5 days and got it after the last dose_ the next month I waited 7 days_ the one after that 11 days. I am now on day 9 and have not gotten my period.

293, 4, To Supplement Estrogen therapy,On Day 2 my period started with a flood. (1 tampon + 1 pad every 1-2 hours).  I figured the drug was doing it's job.  My period finally stopped on day 9.  Around day 11_ I woke up with my left ear feeling wet.  To my surprise it was blood.  I immediately suspected the prometrium and did not take day 11-14.  (Also_ since the goal of the drug was to get a period and it had already completed that job very well).  On day 13 I became very confused and had trouble staying awake.  I don't remember much that day. I missed a few appointments and couldn't even unlock doors with the key in my hand.   I suspect that the prometrium treatment eliminated so much blood from my system that I now have an iron deficiency causing the confusion.,My prescription is for 100mg for 14 days on a quarterly basis as a supplement to the Vivelle estrogen patch.  I take it in the morning because I didn't even know you could take it at night until I read this blog.

My male hormones are at a normal level and I am not diabetic.  So I am wondering if I really have this?!  I am pregnant now and the gestational age is almost 8 weeks.  But last week I had an ultrasound and the sac measured only 4.5 weeks.  I hope that this is because I ovulated late.  In any case_ they checked my hormone levels and it seems that they are rising but not doubling as they should be so they gave me a script for Prometrium (100MG two time/day).  I see the Dr. tomorrow.  My biggest concern is that taking this supplement will harm the baby_ particularly if it is a boy.

I know everyone is different but I want to reassure other women taking the drug that the side effects should go away after a few weeks. I felt like I was on my threshold for putting up with them around day 10-12 and since I have to take them for 3 months I asked my doctor about the unpleasant side effects. He told me to give it another week.  Well I did_ and the side effects finally ceased.  Now I just pop a pill right before bed_ it puts me to sleep and that's it.

My skin and the whites of my eyes were visibly red. Weird!,I would rather just let nature takes it course_ than have to experience this. I am 48 years old....I am asking myself why would my doctor want me to have a period so bad?  Maybe I am entering menopause. I will never take this drug or any other hormone again. I might have to find another GYN if she isn't on the same page as me. After all everyone...it is YOUR body. I have found that I listen to doctor's_ but then research it myself.

He prescribed me 200mg_ once a day for 10 days but I ended up getting my period on day 5 of the pills.  The nurse instructed me to only take two more days after that so I didn't take my last three pills since I already got my period.  The only thing different about my period is that it is lighter and lasting about a week (before it only lasted 2-3 days). Now I will be starting Clomid.,F,27,7  days,10/15/2007Email,Prometrium

Really created new places of pain and after 3-4 weeks and the shots_ nausea_ shaking hands_ couldn't do anything felt so bad_ felt irritable toward people who talked too long. I am disappointed that it didn't help_ wonder how long will take to wear off. I also was prescribed Estratest_ so could be some of that_ too. But when I took hormones at age 50_ estrogen didn't bother_ only progesterone. This did not give me headaches which I had with the progesterone I took alone when I was 50 and the doses were divided to mimic your period.  I don't know why they now combine the two hormones. This med did not work to my satisfaction and I became worse and worse. Thanks for this website and the info_ it was very helpful to me. I don't know what will help my pelvic pain and other problems but hysterectomy_ which I don't want.,F,64,28  days,10/13/2007Email,Prometrium

I was on 100 mg x2 a day for two weeks after trying to get pregnant.  Now Dr. #2 is using it to fix things by starting my period with it.  I take 200 mg before bed.

It is a very potent hormone_ with alot of side effects_ but if it will help in allowing to carry my babies full-term_ then I'm all for it.  I thank God for my great female friends right now though because_ sorry guys_ but most of my male co-workers seem to be driving me around the bend!!!  I would be interested to know if anyone else found swollen lymph nodes_ that is the only symptom I have not yet come across with someone else.

Seven weeks after D&C no period but crippling cramps - diffcult to even roll over or get out of bed.  Doctor put me on 200mg 2X/day for 10 days.  Still no period.  Had an ultrasound and everything was normal.  No blockage_ no cysts.  Just a very thick uterine lining so can't figure why no period.  Not sure if being put on a higher dose will induce a period or simply let nature take it's own course.  Don't want to go on birth control because I do not want to mess with my hormones more than is necessary.,F,35,10  days,9/4/2007,Prometrium

366, 1, Menopause HRT,Diarrhea_ cramps,I posted below about getting cramps and diarrhea from Prometrium.  One of my physicians acted like this was either in my head_ or I needed a bunch of expensive GI function tests.  He suggested I try a compounded progesterone capsule from a compounding pharmacy.  I said I would try it.  When I asked how they compounded it_ I found out that they use lactose.  Ding-dong.  I am lactose intolerant.  The symptoms I got from taking Prometrium were the exact same symptoms I get from drinking milk.  I don't know for sure that Prometrium is manufactured with lactose_ but it is quite possible given that the compounding pharmacy was going to make a progesterone capsule with lactose.  I wanted to post this for anyone who may be lactose intolerant.,F,52,8  days,8/25/2007,Prometrium

I take two 200mg capsules before bedtime.  My RE suggested that I take them before bed because they make you tired.  I take them as I am literally crawling into bed.

380, 3, regulate irregular/heavy bleeding,drowsiness/sleepiness/some dizziness. This medicine is best taken at bedtime. It improves my sleep.,My body doesn't metabolize this drug well. It thinks its candy_ or at best a sleeping pill. I've been taking it to regulate irregular bleeding (200 mg) but sometimes I bleed in the middle of taking it and sometimes I bleed 3 weeks after I finish the 12 day course. Doesn't make sense. Also sometimes I ovulate right after I finish the last dose!  The only thing it helped with is the heavy bleeding_ the bleeding is lighter now.,F,55,3  years,6/18/2007,Prometrium

382, 1, Progesterone replacement,Chest Pains_ extreme fatigue_ felt like I was very very drunk.,In 2000 I was diagnosed with PCOS. Took prempro to reduce cysts and re-establish cycle after many years of two or less per year. After 3 months had to have both ovaries removed due to benign tumors. Continued on Prempro for a few years. Developed Hypothyroidism and began taking Synthroid for that.  The estrogens in Prempro counteract the thyroid meds so I asked Gyn to reduce dosage. Seemed to be working but on last sonogram had thickening of uterine lining so was taken off of Prempro(with the thyroid meds working my body started making its own Estrogen and that's why I needed more progesterone than was in the lowest dose of Prempro that I took) and told to take Provera 10mg. Took one dose and it knocked me out for 2 days. Doc changed scrip to Prometrium 200mg and took one dose at 6pm. At 8pm same day had 3 rapid chest pains and felt dizzy and disoriented.

384, 1, secondary ammenorhea,Only took prometrium (200 mg 1x/day) for 10 days and my life has never been the same. I gained 12 lbs in the 10 days and continued gaining. It's 3 months after taking prometrium and I've gained 30+ lbs even though I exercise 5 days/wk and eat very healthfully (sports Dietician approved). Have gone to many Drs_ done blood & urine tests to see what is going on. What I've learned is that 10% of girls of average weight gain 20+ lbs after taking prometrium (progesterone) and if you are either under weight or extremely overweight_ there is an 80% chance of a 20+ lb weight gain as a side effect of prometrium. I was borderline underweight or at the low end of normal and I gained 30 lbs. I now have endocrine problems and was told that taking progesterone when there's not a shortage of progesterone in the body can change the endrocrine system_ which can take 18-24 months to get back to normal.,I was not told any of this before taking the medication.  I can no longer do my sport_ I have no energy_ I am overweight and never have been before and am miserable.  yes_ this is from the endocrine problem that the excessive progesterone caused_ but I should have been warned.  To top it off_ I didn't even start my period from the prometrium_ I started on my own 1 1/2 months later.DON'T GO ON PROMETRIUM OR PROGESTERONE UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU NEED IT!!!!

I was wondering if anyone has taken Prometrium and off it now that experienced nausea even after 4 days off the medication.  I am hoping it's due to the residual of the medicine_ not because of its damage to my liver or something.  I haven't had nauseous feeling since pregnancy started until taking the medication.

Taking 200 mg 3x a day vaginally along with estrace 2mg 2x a day until pregnacy test. Both are used to help build up uterine lining_ aid implantaion & prevent miscarriage. Seems to be standard protocol at the fertility clinic I went to. Also on Baby aspirin. I'm assuming cause prometrium increses blood clotting/stroke potential and the baby aspirin  helps thin the blood. I was not told of any of the side effects of this drug (found info on my own - internet) and beacuse many side effects are also pregnancy symptoms had a false sense of hope for the first week.

I started suffering severe heatburn and digestive problems shortly after and have been working with doctors_ medications and diet since. It's been so bad_ I've had to sleep upright the whole time. I was assured by Doctors that it couldn't be the prometrium_ but last month I thought I should experiment (no options left)and switched to a progesterone cream. The heartburn was completely gone within 3 days! The diarrhea is much better as well.

Although_ it is not pleasant stuff: my brown spotting completely went away after 2 days of treatment_ so you can bet I will stay on it. I hear that pregnant women should stay on it until week 14.

403, 5, to regulate long/abnormal bleeding,Some bloating and mild cramping_ more restful sleep_ some crazy mood swings.,My natural dr. prescribed this to me (200 mg) to shorten my 3 wk. long periods. I take it days 15-30 of my cycle. My periods have shortened to 9-10 days now. Not perfect_ but much better than before. I've done lots of reading and think I (as well as many women) have a hormone imbalance. Natural Hormones are the way to go. Get your levels checked (estrogen_ progesterone and testosterone). Even if the tests come out fine and you still don't feel fine (normal these days) try some natural hormones. Communication with your dr. is so very important. The tests they have to check you_ from what I have read_ aren't accurate for every woman. Women's hormone levels are very precise to THEIR own bodies. What works for her_ may not work for you. The side effects I have experienced are mild compared to the misery I faced with my cycles being so off. I am only 26. Many women don't think they even have to worry about regulating their hormones until they are around the menopause stage. But if your body,F,26,10  months,3/13/2007Email,Prometrium
404, 5, PCOS,I got dry mouth_ but that's it!,I was told by my doctor and pharmacist to take this med at night since it can cause drowsiness_ so this side effect wasn't negative for me at all. 200mg for 14 days. I would wake up in the am with a nasty case of dry mouth_ but that was easily cured with a sip of water.  I was also told to take it on an empty stomach because food can mess with the absorption.  It was a little tricky since I also take metformin 100mg tid.  I just had to be conscience of when I was eating.  Worked great at starting my periods.  Hopefully I won't have to keep taking it though because the metformin is supposed to kick my hormones in to gear and get me menstruating and ovulating regularly.  I've been taking metformin for 2.5 mos._ and just finished my first round of prometrium.  Very satisfied with the results!,F,25,14  days,3/13/2007,Prometrium

I have never experienced all of these on one dose though just pretty much over the course of 9 months.,I take a 400mg dose at bedtime for 12 nights every other month if I don't have my period on my own.  I have always got my period from prometrium ranging anywhere from 2 days before I finish my last pill to 4 days after I finish my last pill.  The side effects would usually kick in anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours after I take the pills and every night the side effects would be different.  I have learned from trial and error and research on how to avoid some of the more unpleasent side effects.  I don't eat or snack on anything before or after I take the pills.  Always take them with a glass of water and right when you are ready to go to bed.  This medication worked great for me.

The 2nd time they let me go home after the symptoms receded_ no hospital stay.,Took it for short time__ (2 weeks? I forget) and this was in 2003 and no doctors  knew anything about this side effect.  I went online and found it documented as a rare side effect in a European pharmacist site.(sorry don't know where now)Cause is (if I remember terminology) a basalar artery migraine...the artery clamps down and shuts off to a significant degree blood to the brain...mimicing a stroke).  Afetr release from hospital where I had not been given my hormones or vitamins I went home and took them...with the same results.  Stopped them and never had any repeat of symptoms.  As I guess it can't be proved by MRI and CATscans or anything a connection doctors will not say there is a connection.  The literature from Europe did say it though.,F,54,2  weeks,8/24/2006,Prometrium

Goes away in about an hour and severity isn't the same each time I take the 200 mg pill.,I am taking 200 mg twice a day after ovulation is confirmed (3-4 days post ovulation).  Takes about an hour for side effects to kick in and then the side effects usually last an hour after that.  But my luteal phase (number of days after ovulation and before period) has increased to 13-14 days which is normal range).  So the medicine has definitely helped.  I still get my period while on the prometrium then I stop taking when i get my period.,F,33,5  months,6/17/2006,Prometrium

First time after I finished my 10 pills... I got my period almost 2 weeks later.  It is expected that you get your period within 1 week's time.

So then I took another 10 pills... this time getting my period within 4 days.  Both periods directly after taking this drug have been extremely painful.  So painful that Tylenol didn't work.
