0, 5, Chronic allergies and sinusitis,I have not experienced any negative side effects and this is the 2nd month (not consecutive) I've used Nasacort daily.,"I suffer from allergies- cats_ molds_ grasses and pollens. Living in Florida_ allergy ""season"" is year around. I'm also an asthma sufferer. Using Nasacort has let me stop using other allergy meds daily such as Zyrtec_ Claritin_ etc. I even use my albuterol inhaler less often. At the time of writing this review_ I was dealing with a great amount of sinus drainage_ stuffiness and pressure. Was even feeling dizzy from it. I decided to try Nasacort after about a week of feeling miserable. I used it and it helped_ not cured_ but definitely helped the sinus problems I was having. My main concern was the dizziness from the sinus congestion and only after 2 days of using it_ it went away and my allergy and sinus symptoms were greatly reduced. I said in the side effects section that I'm having none_ however_ I cannot be 100% certain of that because I'm feeling a little lethargic. To be fair_ I'm also on another (unrelated) medication that has lethargy listed as a side effect so I can't rule out one or the other.I recommend Nasacort to family and friends but stress to them that I don't take it for more than 3-4 weeks at a time.",F,36,1  months.1mg,1/12/2016Email,Nasacort aq
1, 4, Sinus congestion & Dust & Mold Allergy,None so far.,As soon as I use it I can breathe easier.  I have more energy during the day because I can breathe clearly at night.  I swap off_ this for 2 weeks and Sudafed for 2 weeks_ so my body doesn't get used to either.,F,33,3  weeks2 sprays,5/12/2015,Nasacort aq
2, 1, For Seasonal allergies.,Extremely high blood pressure.  Took it for a month didn't realize it was because of the Nasacort.   Talked to allergy doctor before and the pharmacist they assured me it was ok to take it.  BP today was 186/104 am in ER right now.  This started on 24 February 2015.  Some days ok then starts up again.  Feeling like I'm going to die when it spikes.  How long wil this continue.,If you have high blood pressure please do not use nasal sprays.  I'll never use them again_ ever!!!!!,F,61,1  months,5/5/2015Email,Nasacort aq

8, 4, allergies,This seemed to give me great energy and increased appetite (gained weight over this last month). Felt better than I have for many springs_ but then I decided I should get off of it as I didn't know it was a steroid. My side effects of taking myself off are terrible. Allergies are back and a terrible rebound headaches. So now_ I am slowly weaning myself off and am now dizzy and nauseous. Is this from being on it or taking myself off? I don't know.,,F,50,40  days2 sprays 1X D,6/7/2014,Nasacort aq
9, 1, asthma,My asthma and allergy doctor instructed that my son who is 8 and I take this daily since we had been using albuterol too much and our asthma was not under control. The Nasacort worked but I started to get dizzy/lightheaded after standing up from something simple like watering plants or putting my shoes on. I had an upset stomach: as if I had food poisoning for about 2 weeks and I became extremely fatigued. My blood pressure had dropped to 103/63 with a 75 pulse which is not normal for me. I figured that my son's spaciness was from being tired with the end of the school year and his new phase of extreme annoyance was something that happens to those who are about to turn 9. I have stopped taking it for 3 days and am no longer extremely fatigued or dizzy. Now that I have figured out how it affects me_ I will stop having my son take it.,,F,,1  months 1X D,6/3/2014,Nasacort aq

13, 5, Nasal Congestion & Polyps,Nasacort effectively controls my nasal inflammation without adverse side effects. To save $$_ I try to use the least possible_ but not less than one spray (per nostril) per day. Nasacort is not fast-acting and must be used regularly to be effective.,Before Nasacort_ I had two surgeries (10 yrs apart) for nasal polyps. It was so bad that I had no sense of smell for several years. Nasacort (for the last 10+ years) has kept me out of the OR and smelling the roses. And bread! I worked next to a bakery for a few years and never smelled a thing.,M,56,10  years1 spray 2X D,4/12/2010,Nasacort aq

15, 2, allergies,Worked great the first night_ but I caught a cold on second day of use - sneezing_ mucus_ sore throat - my first cold in years.  Mild headaches for the first week_ but then went away.  Bloody noses started after one week_ but subsided after a little more than a month.  Feelings of lethargy_ lack of concentration and slightly blurry vision continue.,I wouldn't recommend against trying the product - it seems to work for some people_ and some of the side effects seem to be temporary.  That said_ keep in mind that the side effects may negate the benefits_ as I have decided.,M,29,1.5  months,1/27/2010,Nasacort aq

18, 1, Allergies,Weight loss_ lightheaded_ cloudy vision_ lack of concentration_ sweating_ mild chest pains_ and mild shortness of breath followed by anxiety and panic attacks.,Research this drug before you use it. Check with you doctor at the first signs of any side effects. After an ER visit thinking I was having a heart attack my doctor told me to immediatly stop using Nasacort AQ. This brought on a whole different set of even more severe  symptoms causing another visit to the ER followed by an overnight stay in the cardio unit in which my heart was found to be in good shape. My doctor does not believe nasacort AQ could cause such symptoms since it is an inhaled steroid. I did not have any of these symptoms prior to using nasacort AQ.,M,43,1  months,6/21/2009Email,Nasacort aq

21, 1, allergies/acute sinusitis,At first no side effects_ then my ENT doc increased dosage because of sinusitis and I began experiencing horrible pain behind my eyes_ headaches and dizziness.  This went on for 6 months.  I decided to quit taking it and for a few days felt dazed and had the sweats but now feel normal.  I went to 3 different doctors for these symptoms and none of them said it could be from Nasacort AQ!!!!  I put 2 and 2 together and quit on my own.,,F,50,5  years,1/6/2009,Nasacort aq

25, 1, allergies,I have taken this product (or similar) for several years.  I have recently had orbital eye pain and puffy eyes_ especially the left one.  Further_ I have been dizzy as well.  Could this be the cause?  My docs don't know what is wrong.  The pressure is so great around my eye_ it feels like a sinus infection_ but a CAT scan revealed nothing.

29, 2, severe seasonal allergies,Spaced out_ lethargic_ and short of breath.  Definitely can't drive or operate machinery while on this. Good thing I tried this on a Saturday.,Took for first time today.  Will not take again.  Side effects aren't worth marginal benefits.  Also on Clarinex (desloratadine) and Advair 250/50. Think that the combination of Nasacort and Advair is too high a dose of steroids for my body.,F,44,1  days,6/9/2007,Nasacort aq
30, 1, Seasonal allergy_ nasel congestion,I experienced nosebleed after using just once or twice.  I didn't fully appreciate the connection and continued to use this product several more times and the nosebleeds rapidly progressed to the point I couldn't stop the bleeding.  I wound up in the emergency room and then spent 5 nights in the hospital with a nasal tampon inserted into one side of my nose.  This was the only way to stop the bleeding and I ultimately had to have surgery to correct the damage this product did to my sinuses.  This product was a nighmare for me and I would warn others to STOP USING AT THE FIRST SIGN OF BLEEDING!,Apparently it works for some_ but the nosebleed issue is very real and you must take this warning seriously!,M,52,3  days,3/10/2007,Nasacort aq

32, 5, Allergies/congestion,None,I was on others sprays for a long time and I just found out about Nasacort AQ last year. This stuff has been great! It cleared my congestion almost immediately and it doesn't stink or burn like the other ones did. It also doesn't seem to run down the back of my throat as much.
