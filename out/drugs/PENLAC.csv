0, 1, nail fungus,none,Tried it for a year with no results. Very expensive medicine with pitiful success rate. Don't waste your time or money.,M,36,1  years 1X D,5/8/2012Email,Penlac
1, 3, toenail fungus,none that i can point out,i had lost about 15% of my both big toenails on the inner corners and no topical would help it grow back. My podiatrist suggested this and I tried it. Nails grew back after more than one year of every day application but they looked still weak and kinda cracked at the top which is why i had to keep applying it for another year or so...The fungus never went away. It just helped make them look more normal so i can wear sandals without being embarrassed. Once i stopped it_ the fungus came all back and attacked my nail underneath...Ughh! You just have to keep applying topicals forever if you don't wanna bother with pills. :(,F,38,2  years 1X D,4/27/2012Email,Penlac
2, 3, toenail fungus,redness of skin it touchedsock fuzz sticks to it,I was given a sample bottle which I have just finished with. Fungus affected only the lateral (left) quarter of myleft big toe.  I excised/removed all the nail that was separated myself and filed/ground off with a battery powered manicure thing everything that wasn't living and was in the affected area. I did the weekly remove with alcohol and restart the layiering. I was extremely compliant and regular about the daily applications. Every time I removed the weekly build up_ I would remove any nail that had grown out that look diseased.  There has not been any progression of the fungus.  'That in itself is great. I do not expect a cure after one sample bottle.  I read the abyssmally low success rate.  Since the options are to let it do its thing and my nail will fall off completely and it will spread to other nails if I do nothing_ take a harsh pill or comply with an extended regimen of nail care and polishing...Iwill give this a good try.I believe the key to having any success at all,F,45,8  months,10/21/2005,Penlac

4, 1, Nail Fungus,No side effects_ no improvement.  This is a modern day snake oil!  I don't know of anyone who had any positive results.,Was the FDC asleep on this one?,M,57,1  years,8/14/2005,Penlac
5, 2, Toe Fungus,No side effects. It just didn't work,You apply this laquer over the nail_ but I felt that it never penetrated the nail.  I would open up the nail in order to apply it directly but it worked just the same.  I did this for over a year.  I will admit that I would forget to apply on weekends frequently.. but at no point did my toenail get better.,M,27,1.25  years,5/16/2005,Penlac
