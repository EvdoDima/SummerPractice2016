0, 4, Chronic Athletes Foot/Jock Itch,Not sure yet.  Been on it for 3 days.  I seemed to have gotten a bad taste in my mouth but I also had some patch on my foot for anti-inflammatory.  I have had chronic itch on feet and up my legs wherever my socks touch.  Drives me crazy.  Cannot sleep and always itching!  Have not had any itch in those areas since using medicine.  I have tried all the otc religously.  Tinactin_ Desinex_ Lamisil_ Lotrimine.  No help.,I have not encountered the same itching as before using.  I am mixing it with 1% hydorcortizone.  I will give an update next week.,M,37,3  days,7/31/2009,Spectazole
