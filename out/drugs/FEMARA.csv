It was a new lease on life. Tamoxifen comes with some of its own side effects (some hot flashes)_ but I walk and kayak and laugh on a daily basis_ and love life again. This may not be the answer for everyone_ but it's worth asking your onco to see about the possibility of a positive change.

Femara would only change the odds of recurrence to 4% Asked about side effects.  ""Few---maybe hand joint pain."" said oncologist.   Wrong!  Almost immediately had screaming pains in knees_ hips_ back of neck_ nausea_ total sleepiness between pain bursts of about 10 hours a day.  Quit four weeks ago and nothing has improvedl  Two baby aspirin at 12 hour intervals gives me about two hours a day of relative painless movement.  I will now take nothing prescribed for cancer ever again.  Went to a Chinese MD and he has given me capsules of mushrooms extract which he thinks will soon relieve the pain.  No help so far_ but has only been three days.  I am not a fan of doctors----I really get the feeling that patients are an industry to be exploited and profited from.

I underwent radiation after surgery and was blessed not to have chemo.  I also has a hysterectomy within 5 months of cancer surgery to add an additional layer of help.  I am now 59 years old.  I feel that my worst side effect is that my family and husband do not understand that some days I just do not feel well!

114, 2, Breast Ca/Stage 1_ lumpectomy,I woke up during the night to excessive urination.  It came out in buckets. I've  never  experienced anything like it ( except to  compare  it to  my water breaking!) I couldn't function without sleep as I was going to have to drive to see my grandson. I stopped taking it.  Doc said to wait a week & try Arimidex. I stiffened up to the point of being unable to walk_ my joints swelled & I developed painful  trigger finger.   My blood  pressure went dangerously high_  even after 3 doses  of Inderal. After 3 wks_  took a short break. All symptoms went away. Blood pressure  came down to normal.  Dr. tried Tamoxifen.  To my dismay_ the trigger finger came back_ with very severe joint pains & stiffness in my hands/ feet_  knees.  I cannot make a fist without fingers getting stuck.   So discouraged.  Will try the supplement one lady mentioned for lubrication. I just can't function like this for 5 yrs. I have a home to take care of &  no one here to help me.  There must be something else that doesn't cause such suffering.  No one is guaranteed no recurrence of cancer_ but mine was only 1.2cm & I really blame the Estrace.

I've always been very thin_ but noticeable weight gain in the abdominal area.  I decided to stop taking Femara for a week to see if I felt any different.

I immediately felt fantastic but I noticed after several months of using it seemed to have had sort of a plateau effect. That being said_ I had also became very inconsistent in using it as directed...on an empty stomach at the same time every day and sometimes forgetting to take for several days in a row. My bad. I still felt better but ""stuck"". It got worse when I purchased a different brand and just became miserable all over again. Fast forward and I re-invested in the NeoCell brand. This time I re-researched and purchased the Type 2 Collagen. This is specifically for bones and joint lubrication and contains hyaluronic acid. I've been on it two weeks and feel even better than the type 1 & 3 made me feel. I am also very diligent to take it as directed_ on an empty stomach_ immediately upon awakening every single day. After approximately 30 minutes_ you are then able to take type 1 & 3. They are not to be taken together! I am using type 2 till I run out to gauge the results at which point I plan on taking the two together at the specified time intervals. The pains that I do feel now are more in line with what I felt before femara and for a woman my age and weight (I'm a big girl!). I feel ""normal"" again.

My boyfriend is a doctor & he did a ton of research to come up with two things to help me naturally (I refuse to take another drug to fix the original drug).  Vitamin b has helped with my energy & a Tumeric supplement with black pepper (for easier absorption) has done wonders for me with literally everything else.  Look up the benefits online & you will be floored that you didn't know about it sooner.  Pharmaceutical companies are coming up with a synthetic form of tumeric for cancer patients very soon...they don't want you to know what a miracle herb it is in its natural form. I feel like I'm getting my life back ...and I've only been on it one week and seeing improvement with ALL of my problems.  I am floored that no one told me about this. Please do yourself a favor & look into it...via Internet...your doctor...other patients.  I hate to see anyone suffer another day when relief can be so simple.

158, 3, Metastatic Breast Cancer (Bone),The first week I began taking this drug I experienced hot flashes_ depression_ loss of appetite and unbelievable aching plus stiffness in my joints and muscles. My hips being the worse. This drug was worse than the 12 weeks of chemo. But I found help.,I came upon this forum and read a couple of suggestions of taking collagen_ specifically NeoCell Collagen+C from Costco and Glucosamine. I had relief within 24 hours. My nutritional oncologist suggested HMC Hesperidin for the hot flashes. Rhodiola Rosea for mental clarity and depression. I feel so much better. Yes I still have hot flashes but nearly as many. She also suggested Phenylalanine-D for the pain. All of this has helped. Also_ keep moving. Yes it's difficult especially in the morning or after sitting for a while_ but my dr. agreed it's important to force yourself. I had good response to the chemo and my oncologist feels this drug can keep the cancer at bay. I gave this a 3 rating based on the short time I have taken this.,F,57,45  days2.5 1X D,6/19/2012Email,Femara

160, 1, post breast cancer chemo/radiation,"My comment regarding this drug is posted in April of 2010.  At that time I was going to tell my Oncologist that I was going to discontinue taking Femara as ""quality of life"" was as important_ if not more so_ than living with extreme pain this drug was giving me that virtually gave me no productive life. Since that time_ after discontinuing Femara_ my joint pain has gradually disappeared_ though I still have hip pain that radiates into my legs which is a combination of degenerative changes and I firmly believe_ as a result of this medication.  Prior to taking Femara and even after chemo and radiation_ I did not experience pain until Femara came into my life.  So far_ by the Grace of God_ I am still ""cancer free"" and feeling like I have a life once more. I still read comments about this drug and my heart goes out to those of you who are experiencing the debilitating effects of this drug.",,F,64,3  months20 mg. 1X D,6/5/2012,Femara

Was told it was a side effect of the meds the first time_ second time I was told to take ibuprophen. I have a high tolerance for pain_ but this was bad enough to seek some outside help. In the 18 months that I've been taking Femara_ I developed some pretty bad osteoartheritis in both feet_ along with spurs_ something I never had before.  This stuff DESTROYS YOUR JOINTS_ except no one wants to tell you that. Prior to taking this medication_ the most I had was some mild artheritis in my fingers...now I'm half-crippled in my feet. I also have high cholesterol now_ as well as borderline high BP_ vein inflammation in my feet (seeing a vein guy about that in 2 wks) gained 35 lbs in a matter of months_ heavy-feeling tired legs and general fatique.  Overall_ I feel un-well a good deal of the time.  They want me on this for 10 years.  If this kind of damage ocurred in 18 months_ what is going to happen to me after 8.5 years?!  I have a decision to make regarding quality of life issues vs. the inevitable should I stop taking Femara. And you know what?  I feel I've been duped.

What I'm told is Vemma doesn't cure you_ but it makes your cells healthier to help heal. I have dranked Vemma for 5 years now_ and the pains are at a minimum in my toes.  This is not a gimmick_ because I don't sell Vemma.  I do buy it for my entire family. In addition_ I also bought a foot/calf massager from Brookstone for circulation_ which I use every evening.  I have a second chance at life.  I stand on my feet all day with my job and as soon as I get home_ I'm using my massager. The first thing I do in the morning is drink 2 oz. of Vemma.  I now have started my own business and I do all the traveling and marketing for my business. On Friday evenings_ I'm loading my trailer for my marketing trip.  Some of my friends can't believe where I get the energy.  I truly believe Vemma gave me a second chance...along with prayers.  I ask you to just commit yourself to drinking Vemma for at least 3 months and get a massager that helps your calves and feet.

I quit smoking after 49 years so realize that part of the weight gain is due metabolic changes.,I trust my onc with my life so will continue to take Femara for four more years.,F,67,365  days2.5 mg 1X D,10/13/2011Email,Femara
201, 5, Stage IIB BC; 9 years later in lung,joint aches_ tendonitis_ pain in thumbs,"Here is what has helped me based on my Onc's recommendations and from reading forums like these:I take Schiff Move Free pills every day.  (Gluscosimine and Chondroiton  sp?) That brand is the first that I tried and it works so well that I have not tried anything else!  It eliminated the joint pain completely for me.  I definitely had the early morning aches!  My fingers and feet felt crunchy!""After a couple years I started getting severe tendonitis in my feet and shoulder.  My primary care Dr x-rayed it or MRI'd it and was considering surgery!  I read on a forum that I should try taking femara with food.  (I take it before I go to bed and so my stomach was always empty.)  I started taking it with food and literally within 2 days I felt better!I urge you all to try things before giving up - especially those who have had advanced stage BC.I do need more sleep than before - I mean like 7 or 8 hours instead or 4 or 5.  But really_ shouldn't I need more sleep anyway?Oh_ I was getting very ""bitchy"" and now I take Lexapro and feel like myself again.  My husband says it is a world of difference.  I do have things like a little less focus_ a little less motivation_ but I can manage all that with more effort.Right now I am looking for a remedy for my hands - my thumbs are both really bothering me.  Very arthritic feeling.  Any suggestions??My history in brief:At the age of 28_ I was diagnosed with stage IIb BC and had a bilateral mastectomy",F,44,5.5  years2.5 mg 1X D,10/12/2011Email,Femara
202, 4, BC_ stage 2,Hair loss_ thinning_ and texture change.  Some joint aches but mostly minor discomfort. Severe sleeplessness.  A few hot flashes but mostly minor compared to when I first went through menopause.   Onc is taking me  off Femara now.  Am having EXTREME itchy/crawly skin_ day and night.  Didn't experience this while taking it at all. Has anyone experienced this or have any suggestions?,Take Femara first thing in the morning if you are having a hard time sleeping.  Took it about dinner time for 4 years and spent most of that time trying different sleeping pills to help me get through the night.  ONC had no suggestion when best to take the pill.  Noticed that one of the documented side effects is sleeplessness and immediately started taking pill in morning.  Within a few days_ I started sleeping better and stopped taking sleeping aids.I tried Arimidex for 5 months before getting on Femara.  Although list of side effects appear similar_ they are NOT the same drug and you may do better on one than the other. Biggest issue with Arimidex was heavy/sad mental spirit.  ONC had never heard of it. Went off of it for 2 weeks and felt so much better and then started FEMARA.,F,57,5  years2.5 _ 1X D,10/4/2011,Femara

I am going to call my primary nurse tomorrow to start this process.  I would rather have quality of life than quantity of life and it is my life I am talking about so I should have the last word about this.

204, 4, Stage 1 bc,I went on the drug at 66 and was already experiencing joint pain and stiffness_ fatigue_ and memory loss -- these have continued.  Femara did seem to bring back the hot flushes of menopause_ but not as intensely.  I had some depression and my onco started me on Paxil.  I continued this for six months and it helped.  I'm not sure about brain fog_ but I probably do have some of that -- it's harder to concentrate.,I'm noticing that many people are experiencing pretty severe bone and joint problems_ and I'm wondering if you are getting prophylactic treatment to protect your bones.  When I started Femara_ my oncologist also started me on Zometa infusions every six months and Calcium with vitamin D three times a day_ both to counteract the effects of Femara on bones.

I'm tired_ bitchy(er) and I shuffle around like I'm 100! It's awful. I literally have been crying in pain_ frustration & scared to death my quality of life was gone. But I FINALLY found relief!Read below...,Desperate for relief_ I would try almost anything. Yesterday at Costco I found NeoCell Super Collagen+C_ Type 1&3. Holy Cow! And I mean bovine! I have only taken two pills and I feel as if I can do cartwheels! I've changed absolutely nothing...just added this supplement (and I'm very skeptical I might add). I've called everyone I know & decided to post on this forum because I finally have something to say that maybe we all haven't heard before. I have no idea of drug interactions or safety but I do know I can get up out of a sitting position without bracing myself for several minutes before walking. My knees_ my feet_ my arches and my fingers feel AMAZING. And to think I've only taken two so far! It's insane! Give this a try...you'll thank me! lol!  :))  Please check w/ your onc first though because I am no medical professional and I'd hate for anyone to have more problems than they already do.

My dr wanted me on it for the rest of my life because my cancer was aggressive. My dr retired and I now have a young female ono doc. First thing she did was take me off Femera.  She said that there are studies of long term effects of bone loss.  I have been having alot of hip pain and just chalked it up to being arthritus.  My body has arthritus all thru it thanks to chemo and radiation.  After my annual scans_  the doc found a spot on my lower spine. Not sure what it is.  I have to go for an MRI to find out what it is. What ever it is I think that I am going to have to deal with this pain forever.  I didn't know side effects to femara was bone loss.,I think femara did what it was suppose to do in the beginning.  I am 9 years out and I think that Femara had something to  do with it.  I'm alittle upset because my original doc never said that long term could cause bone loss. I read about the person that is 44 and can't work anymore because of femara.  I feel sorry for her. I am a very active person_ and I don't know how things are going to turn out.

213, 1, breast cancer,I was on tamoxafin for 5 years and at the end of the fifth year I ended up with blood clots.  Tamoxafin was a very bad medication and i took it because I didn't want my bc to return.  But_ it did come back in the last week of the end of my 5 years.   I was put of warfarin and femara 2.5mg.  I had already gained weight taking the tamaxafin_ my legs and feet swelled up so bad that I couldn't walk or even put shoes on.  The pain in my bones and the swelling of my body was outrageous.   The femara didn't make my quality of life better_ it just got worse.  I stopped taking it after 2 years and a few months of it being in my system.  My oncologist then wanted me to take arimidex and I declined because I just want my mind back.  I haven't been on any hrt since feb. 2011 and I am feeling a little better.  At least I can concentrate a bit better and although I am still trying to lose weight I have a smile on my face because I am not hurting as bad as I was before.

I am only 45 and feel horrible.  I fell asleep while at a stop light driving home from work the other day.  I feel this is a medication that is simply not do-able if you are a person who has to go to work and take care of teen-agers as I do.  But_ I also want to be alive to do these things.

I stopped Femara after one year.  I had joint pain on tamoxifen_ but the pain became crippling when I started Femara.  The most recent effect was that my hands became useless and I developed four trigger fingers.  Also_ Novartis misrepresents the improved protection Femara supposedly gives women regarding a recurrence of their cancer.  The actual improvement for most women is only 2.9% (from 4.9% to 2%).

They have all subsided except the hot flashes which seem to be better but I have only been on it for 5 days.  I am quite stunned at some of the dosage levels.  30mg?  Really?  Perhaps that is part of the problem?  For brain fog - I started taking wellbutrin after the oophorectomy - took about 6 months but I feel more myself again.

I know all of this has been said before_ but it really feels good to hear I am not alone!,I took Tamoxafin for 3.5 years and then switched to Femara. Have been on the Femara for 3.5 years. Really looking forward to stopping in 1.5 years. For the lady who asked about frozen shoulder. I experienced frozen shoulder about 3 years ago. Came on suddenly and was the most painful thing I had. It took a full year of stretching and exercising the arm and shoulder to be able to reach behind my back again. Now it is ok_ I can reach my bra again. I don't know if I can blame it on the medication_ I was on the Femara only a few months at that time. The stiffness and pain is something else. I have trouble getting up_ have given up trying to get up off the floor. My sand chair is in the garage unused now. It seems my legs are getting worse. I do exercise_ I am walking at least 3 miles a day_ sometimes more. I work two part time jobs_ so am not used to sitting much.

244, 1, Avoid BC Recurrence,Joint pain_ muscle aches_ vaginal dryness_ fatigue_ insomnia.,"This is an update to my post of 8/2/2010. I saw my onc who fortunately told me we could switch to another drug. Unfortunately_ it was another Aromatase inhibitor_ Aromasin_ which gave me the same side affects in addition to symptoms of Lyme's Disease. After 2 weeks on the Aromasin_ I begged to be switched to Tamoxifen_ even though I am post-menopausal. My recurrence rate is 7% based on 5 years of Tamoxifen or Femara_ so why not let me take it? My onc agreed and in Sept 2010_ I began taking Tamoxifen 20mg/daily. I found immediate relief of the joint pain and other symptoms. After crying to my GYN that the vaginal dryness from Femara was a ""deal breaker"" for me_ I can honestly say that I feel like a woman again. Tamoxifen is tried-and-true and has been the drug of choice for decades. The fact that I can produce my own Estrogen (albeit not much since I'm post-menopausal) is a huge benefit. I don't understand why Femara is being promoted as the best if it includes so many destructive side affects -- is it because it is so expensive and the drug companies are pushing it? It has been 7 months since I started Tamoxifen and 1 year since my diagnosis and lumpectomy. I recently had reconstruction to repair my lumpectomy defect and am back to living a normal_ active and healthy life. I'm so glad I am not taking Femara. Good luck to all.",F,52,6  months2.5mg 1X D,4/12/2011Email,Femara

Was on Tamoxifen for 5 yrs and then Femara for 6 years.  I took my last one a couple of days ago after finding this site.  I want to believe Femara helped because_ yes_ I have been cancer free since 1999.  I initially experienced hair thinning after a few months on it. I started using men's Rogaine which helped.  I discontinued that after a couple of years.  Now_ my hair has really started thinning and my scalp tingles like when I lost my hair on chemo. (I did start back on the Rogaine which takes a few months to start really working.)  So_ I hit the internet and after perusing this sight decided my almost 6 years on Femara was enough.  What a tough decision_ though.  I used to joke that I ""lost my grip"" after cancer because taking off jar lids_ etc. is almost impossible.  At 47 I had arthritis in my fingers and general soreness.  I also noticed my heart having a ""hard"" heartbeat a few months ago and even went to a cardiologis after my general practitioner heard it skip a beat after I told him about how I could feel my heart beat funny.  They are both just watching it for now.  But I feel like I am in a 70 year old body.  Always been healthy_ exercise_ non-smoker and keep weight down.  Can't imagine how I would feel if I hadn't gone into this journey already very healthy.  Hope I feel some relief and my hair stops falling out now that I've stopped the drug.

Options I researched that may help: I have 6-12%? better chance of cancer not returning in same breast with Femara or Arimidex. Compare this to: Moderate exercise 5x week = 50% increase in survival. Adequate levels vitamin D3 = increase of 60-77%. Aspirin = increase of 50%_ natural anti-inflammatories are even better. Anti-estrogens:'Chrysin' works as well as the aromatase inhibitors. 'DIM'_ iodine and melatonin act as anti-estrogens. Women who have BC often have lower levels of Iodine_ C_ E_ Selenium_ D_ Melatonin_ and Omega 3's. All are vital. There is help out there_ you don't have to suffer and you can still keep yourself healthy. No doctor could tell me what was causing the pain. My theory_'Osteomalacia' (basically_rickets)-loss of estrogen may interfere with production of D leading to softening of the bones and pain. Try D3_ Omega 3's_ natural anti-inflammatories.,F,68,8.5  weeks2.5mg 1X D,11/9/2010Email,Femara

Every person I have spoken to who has taken this drug has severe side effects so why does the manufacturer claim that it is well tolerated?  and why doesn't the manufacturer make it more clear just how much of a survivability increase the patient actually gets by taking femara?,F,58,7  weeks2.5 mg 1X D,11/9/2010Email,Femara

Feel like I have the flu arms and shoulders also ache. Oncologist has put me back on Tamoxifen have not taken Femara for 6 weeks but still having terrible leg pain.  Take fish oil and Glucosamine find this helps with joint pain.  Hope never to go back on this drug seriously effects quality of life.,,F,52,12  months2.5mg 1X D,11/7/2010,Femara
292, 1, BC 2_ grd 3 vascular invasion,Hot flashes_nausea_loss libido_ vaginal dryness - can deal with these. At 5 weeks pain developed hip and all down bones in leg. Worsened until could not walk without excruciating pain. No sleep because of pain_ impossible to exercise. Stopped at 8.5 weeks. Began herbal complex for inflammation and pain. 'Herbs of Gold - Pain Eaze' (Devil's Claw_ Boswelia_Ginger_Tumeric_ Black Pepper).  Worked immediately_ within 1 week walking regularly and doing weights. Agreed to try Arimidex - big mistake! Pain back immediately_ stopped after 2 weeks and more than 2 months later still have pain. This time_ hips_ bones in legs plus toes.Now switched to 'Totally Natural Pain No More' as it also has MSM and Glucosomine to repair damage done by drugs - improving_ walked today with minimal pain. Warning! Pain is our bodies way of saying something is seriously wrong. I couldn't get out of a chair! Make your own decision but do your homework. Femara/Arimidex was supposed to give me 6-12% better survival,I will not take any more Aromatase Inhibitors and will keep on with my research and experimentation.  I just had my 12 month breast check - Ultra sound as I refused a mammogram and all is clear.  I had a very poor prognosis originally and took responsibility to change what was out of balance.I researched and started some natural interventions before I had surgery (over 1/2 kilo and 22cm removed + 22 nodes)_ reluctantly had radiation_ refused chemo. My surgeon said I was 'unbelievably fortunate' when he read the results after surgery (he expected the worse as my tumor had doubled in two weeks) - I agree but credit some of that to the protocols I had already started. For me Femara and Arimidex are not worth it. Check out Iodine supplementation on 'Breast Cancer Choices.org'.

295, 1, post breast cancer treatment,bone_ joint & muscle pain_ cough_ shortness of breath_ extreme vaginal dryness_ nights sweats_ hot flashes_ palpitations_ can't sleep due to pain.,I was a healthy 65 year old that worked out daily including walking 2-5 miles. Been like this for over 40 years. Pain started within a few weeks after starting Femara and continued to increase. My oncologist told me at about 6 weeks to stay on it and it may subside in 6 months to a year. So I continued in pain. By 3 months I stopped on my own against her wishes. She wanted to come in right away to discuss my decision. It was 2 weeks after I stopped Femara that I saw her and the pain was still going strong. Gave me a new prescription for Aromasin_ which stops estrogen also. So I told her I may try it after my pain goes away_ according to her was 3 weeks for it to stop. Well_ I'm now out 5 weeks and the pain is still here. My quality of life sucks! I now believe this does not go away totally. There aren't any studies showing it doesn't cause permanent damage_ because these drugs have not been around long enough to finish a study (10 years) My understanding now is that if you stop ALL the estrogen in your body_ it causes bad bone damage_ plus harms anything else in you body that depends on estrogen. I can't even imagine what 5 years will do_ if 3 months caused all this damage to me. I won't go back on any estrogen inhibitors. I would rather take on the surgery_ chemo_ and radiation again if the cancer returns.

I read the posts of those who stop taking Femara temporarily_ and this is so dangerous. Instead_ I would suggest talking to your oncologist or primary physician_ and doing all you can to minimize the side effects_ and to make yourself as comfortable as possible. Time does pass  more quickly than expected in the end_ and eventually you will stop taking Femara_ and the side effects will subside.

For past 2-3 months_ major joint pain after sitting or lying for a while. Pain is less when I'm active_ but motivating myself is hard. Previously very athletic_ tennis/golf/running/hiking_ but now scared of injury. Still play a lot of golf without any pain and planning to see personal trainer for a fitness program. Have not noticed any hair loss_ skin dryness or insommnia yet_ but these posts do scare me.,"I had OncoType DX testing on my actual tumor and my recurrence risk within 10 years was assessed at 7% but that assessment was based on 5 years of Tamoxifen or Femara. I have to say that I am very worried about becoming inactive and dealing with this joint/muscle pain for the next 5 years. Prior to my diagnosis 8 months ago_ I was an extremely young and active 50-year-old_ really in the prime of my life. Playing competitive tennis_ golf_ biking and hiking with my husband_ traveling and basically not letting anything stand in my way. My diet and weight was stable_ I worked out regularly and people were shocked at my true age. I don't want to give up everything for 5 years when I consider these the best years of my life. I'm scared to take nothing_ but am very worried I'll begin to feel as badly as most of the people posting. I see my Med Onc in 2 days for just the 2nd appt_ and I hope to get some information to help me decide what to do. To think that I was so excited that all I needed was to ""take a pill"" instead of having chemo. I take Calcium and Vitamin D_ both OTC and prescription_ my bone density was normal prior to starting. I eat a diet high in anti-oxidants and also take Vit B complex with Folic Acid.

344, 1, My sister has stage 1 breast cancer,So far she has not experienced any side effects but I am very worried about her after reading the comments on this web-site.  Her doctors prescribed Femara to block the estrogen that is feeding the tumor_ thus hopefully shrinking the tumor.,"A natural product called DIM is what I am taking to balance my estrogen.  I was diagnosed with uterine cancer which the doctors say came from too much ""bad estrogen"". As a result I had a complete hysterectomy- all my female organs were removed even though I had the tumor just in the uterus. I have been cancer free since 2007 but began taking a natural product called DIM two months ago.  Health Resources in Hueytown_ Alabama offers this product.  Here is the DIM information from that website. ""DIM(short for Di-Indole Methane)is the key ingredient in this all-natural product. A unique phytonutrient_ DIM is found in cruciferous vegetables like cabbage_ broccoli_ cauliflower_ kale_ mustard_ turnip_ bok choy_ Brussels sprouts_ kohlrabi and rutabaga. Effective for both men and women_ DIM helps naturally support balanced estrogen levels. Numerous scientific studies have shown this single natural ingredient can greatly improve your estrogen metabolism and overall health. You would have to eat at least 2.5 pounds of cruciferous vegetables every day to get the amount of DIM in each daily serving of this product.""         Some of you may want to investigate this natural product because it does not wreck you bones or joints like Femara seems to do for some women.  I am not connected in any way to this company and only share this information to educate others about alternative possibilities.

The physical therapist says that my muscles and tendons were like leather - very stiff. My oncologist warned me about the joint & muscle pain_ but since I was used to arthritis he said I probably wouldn't notice the side effects too much - wrong! My feet hurt when I first get up of bed & when I get up from a chair - my achille's heel just started hurting too. My hips_ knees & lower back also but pain tends to go away when I start moving around. I take an occasional Aleve but that really doesn't help much. Think I'll try MSM_ Glucosomine & condroitin for relief. I'm so glad I stumbled on this webpage.

I am finally in an exercise routine again. I think the body is put through so much with surgery and treatment (as well as mental anguish) that it takes longer to recover then we realize. I will continue the acupuncture as long as I am on the drug. My oncologist said that one theory for the joint pain is that woman are more flexible then men because they have estrogen in the joints.

I have been exercising daily since going onto Femara_ 8 months ago and I have had very few side affects and feel quite well on it.  I do have occasional hot flashes and night sweats and some times a little knee and hip pain  but that is probably caused by being over enthusiastic with the exercise.

My oncologist just looks at me when I tell her what I am going through; my GP has admitted that doctors prescribe meds.  That's their job.  I am going to stop taking this drug.  I agree with so many who commented before me_ there has to be quality of life.  Look at the holistic alternatives_ seek advice.  God Bless.,F,57,19  months2.5 1X D,2/21/2010Email,Femara

Femara is suppose to have a better rating.  I have had more problems with Femara.  Swollen hands in the beginning...then_ locking fingers (some call it trigger fingers).  They lock down if I grip something.  They lock down when I sleep and I have to pull them up with my other hand.  I feel the pain in my elbows and shoulders now.  I feel very weak.  It is depressing to feel like this at my age.  I feel so old.  It is hard on a marriage too.  No one likes to hear me complain so I try to keep quiet.  I don't want the cancer to come back of course_ but I don't know if I can keep this up.  I see my Dr in Dallas in February.  I don't know what he can do though.,If anyone else has had the locking fingers or trigger fingers_ please email me.  I just think there are things about this drug that we don't know.

453, 3, Treatment for Endometriosis,Horrible joint paint in almost every joint_ especially the tops of my feet_ elbows_ knees and shoulders_ hot flashes_ sudden break out in hives/acne on my neck_ chest and shoulders (never EVER had acne in these places ever in my life)_ mood swings_ and fatigue,I took Femara for about 8 months and just literally took my last pill tonight. I took it for a treatment as a result of stage IV very bad Endometreosis. From what my doctor has said the surgery I had and the pills_ coupled with a Lupron shot once a month for 6 months have done the job. However this is not without the nasty side effects. I can deal with the hot flashes_ mood swings_ and even the horrible acne that showed up_ but the joint pain was the worst. I used to run about 3-4 times a week and now when I get home from work I do can barely anything. I am so tired and my joints are so achy I usually just go to bed. I am 24 years old so I hope after taking this last shot I will be back to normal and I hope the joint pain isn't permanent because it has been pretty miserable the past 3 months,F,24,8  months,12/10/2009Email,Femara
454, 2, BC Stg.1_ node neg.,Living in a fog_ frightening short-term memory_ every joint in my body stiff and aching_ especially fingers and knees. Plantar heel pain such that upon rising from sitting or laying down may need crutches soon if this gets any worse? Everything hurts.,Before I began it last week_ I asked the onco-doc 4X to tell me what the common side effects were. At first I thought he'd not heard me but then I realized he was deliberately avoiding the discussion. Then_ with a heavy sigh_ he began this sort of tirade about how_ having already gone through breast surgery_ axillary node disection_ taxotere/cytoxin chemo_ radiation and then a bilateral oophorectomy_ this drug would be_ by far_ the easiest. He told me he doesn't like to be switching BC patients from A.I. to A.I._ and told me with a chuckle that he did NOT want to be hearing any joint complaints. He said this was the most important aspect of my 'fight'_ reiterated the great successes this drug could boast_ and sent me on my way. WITHOUT a script_ btw.....but with a 30 day supply from the sample cabinet_ and_ I have excellent insurance_ so this sounds like he wasn't ready to prescribe it. So_ as I said_ it is day 7 and I am searching the net here for other people's symptoms with Femara. Three days into it_ and I found myself crying while trying to explain to someone how I suddenly feel as though I am 90 years old! I hadn't cried all year_ even at my diagnosis! And now_ what to do? I don't know if I can do this much longer_ am sort of afraid to tell the onco doc this! This is worse than any of my above treatments because THOSE things had an end in sight. Also_ (in my mind?)everyone expects that I am all better now_ that I am cured and should be feeling great any day now.,F,54,7  days,12/9/2009Email,Femara

The Gerd has been horrific this year but I'm getting it under control_ however_ now that hives have developed which could be chronic and caused by autoimmune disease_ I'm very concerned that Femara could have brought it on.,I took Tamoxifen for 5 years and tolerated that well enough but I'm very concerned that Femara could be causing more of my symptoms which are not listed as a major side effect but I wanted to post this due to the possibility that more people could be experiencing these symptoms without knowing they may be related.

I was first taking Arimidex_ another aromatase inhibitor but after about a year I had bad joint pains_ lack of energy_ felt like 100_ etc.  I talked to my oncologist and she changed me to Femara_ which I feel better on.  Another woman in my breast cancer support group had problems with Femara and now takes Arimidex -- and likes it.  We are all different_ talk to your doctor and find an alternative drug.  I will tolerate some discomfort to enjoy my first grandchild.  I also exercise and do yoga.  I think Arimidex did hasten my joint problems originally caused by an old injury and arthritis.

I just happened upon this site today and was so happy to know that I'm not the only one who is disgusted with this treatment. In additon to the side effects which are making life miserable_ this drug is so expensive that I was forced to ask my doctor to put me on something else. He reluctantly chose Tamoxifen. If the quality of my life doesn't improve with that_ then I would rather trust my life to God's will_ than to spend the rest of it like this.

At the same time it has made my life miserable_ that is_ if it is truly the cause of all of these problems. Most are simply the inevitable result of menopause_ but I do attribute the severity of the problems to the use of Femara (along with Zometa).

Quite frankly they don't even seem to realize that Femara is the cause of many of these symptoms_ which is clear to me even more now that I read all your posts!

I can't walk without shoes - and look 100. I have walked 5-7 miles a day for the past 27 years - and can't anymore. I have to say it did make me feel better to see that I'm not alone. For the expense and the side effects_ is this really a better option? I was lucky (?) - I had stage 0_ but opted for a mastectomy - and required no other treatment except tamoxifen - and then femara - because it was to have fewer side effects.. I'm also lucky that I have health insurance that makes this affordable for me. The cost is outrageous. I thought maybe I was just getting old- btw - since this is October_ everything is pink_ and it's breast cancer awareness month - shouldn't we have a cure?

Memory is weak most days. Last evening I was searching my pocket for vitamins when my friend reminded me I had just taken them! Honestly_ I had no recollection! Also my vision has seemed more blurry. I have been successfully dealing w/fibromyalgia for past 20 years so always wonder if symptoms are from fibro acting up [there are many similarities]. Today I decided to look up side effects of Femara. It was so reassuring to learn many others are experiencing similar symptoms. My breast cancer was estrogen driven involving both ductal & lobular area in right breast only. Shrunk tumor with chemo prior to surgery_ followed by lumpectomy [2 lymph nodes removed] then radiation. So far my numbers are good & I will continue Femara in hopes of keeping them that way.

Although I'm very grateful that a drug is available_ this very long haul is really getting me down.  I'm past the halfway mark_ but sometimes I really don't know if I can keep this up for the next 22 months.",F,59,2  months,9/19/2009Email,Femara

I have been doing yoga which has helped and try to exercise every day. Recently I have had vaginal bleeding which is scary. They have done all the tests and supposedly I do not have uterine cancer. However_ the bleeding continues and it seems the drugs to fix it are the hormones I am trying to avoid! Has anyone else experience vaginal bleeding? As much as the side effects are difficult_ I want to stay on this drug because it works!,M,59,8  months,9/16/2009,Femara
490, 1, Breast cancer in both breasts,Carpel tunnel and arthritis in my hands were very painful.  I couldn't do hardly anything.  Joints in my legs hurt every time I got up.  Depression too.,I started taking Femara 3-17-09.  I explained to my doctor all my symptoms.  He had me quit for one week_ and then he put me on Arimidex.  After a week of being off of Femara_ my carpel tunnel improved tremendously.  The pain in my joints went away.  My depression was gone.  LADIES_ TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.  There's no reason to suffer like that.  Medicines work different on different people.  I've been on Arimidex since 6-25-09_ and so far_ the only symptom I have is a tiny bit of carpel tunnel in one finger!,F,57,3  months,9/16/2009Email,Femara
491, 3, stage 1_ estrog rec + breast cancer,My hair was getting thinner and_ after 1 full year_ 2 months ago I started to feel the leg pain and understand what others here have said about feeling like a 90 year old. It started with being very stiff when I stood up from sitting but has gotten worse.,I went to the dermatologist about my hair. She gave me a special biotin_ zinc piccolinate and suggested I use Rogaine. Something worked because my hair has stopped falling out and looks thick again. The zinc piccolinate interfered with my synthroid (throid cancer 9 years ago) so I now take it at a different time than I take the synthroid and that has worked out fine. I also find that if I take 2 motrin in the morning_ my legs are much better. Sometimes I take 2 more later in the day. It has made all the difference in the world.Obviously_ everyone is different and it's important to ask your doctor about all of this_ but I wanted to post some hope. Having survived (I hope) cancer twice_ I'll stay on Femara if it keeps me cancer-free. With this symptom relief_ it will be easier.,F,62,1  years,9/12/2009Email,Femara

Couldn't stand the incredible pain. Lower legs felt like they had been skinned and a cement block had been dropped on my feet. Told dr I was quitting. Put me on Femara instead. 3 days later most of pain was gone. I had hope until about 6-8 weeks later when side effects got worse. Felt like 80-yr-old. So tired_ so depressed_ so fat. Can't stand to exercise or hardly walk so just got fatter (250#) which caused more pain in my knees in addition to the other stuff. Sat in a chair that broke and injured my tailbone. Afraid it will never heal. Can't sit on a bike seat.I'd had it. Went off Femara Sept 6. Next night pain was at 10. 2nd nite about 7. Last night I could actually lay on my right side without crying. Had 9 experimental chemos_ 32 radiations_ and surgery. I'm done! Femara affected my cousin the same way. They switched her to Tamoxifin and she was fine. We all react differently to the same meds_ so although I would give it a zero_ that doesn't mean it might not work for you.,F,59,7  months,9/10/2009Email,Femara

494, 3, breast cancer,Hot flashes_ bone and joint pain_ insomnia_ depression_ weight gain,I have been taking Femara for 5 months. I started right after radiation was finished. Doing pretty well the first few weeks. I was walking a lot and climbing 3 flights of stairs several times a day at work. I thought now that the chemo and radiation were over I could get back in shape (can you believe I gained 20 lbs during treatment? Who does that?) Suddenly one day_ my knees felt like they were breaking in half. The foot pain came after that. I walk like an old woman first thing in the morning and after sitting for a bit. I feel like my neck needs to be stretched. The worst is my fingers. I now have 5 fingers that pop out of joint continually. It is very painful. I was not sleeping well and now it is almost impossible because of my fingers. After 6 hours I can hardly type. My oncol. says this will all go away and everything returns to normal_ but I don't know how these crooked hands can be normal again. I have lymphedema and have done that therapy and pt for shoulder and arm pain. I too am grateful to be alive and will keep it up_ but it is difficult. I cried when I read all these comments. May God bless all of us. This is really hard.,F,60,5  months,9/8/2009,Femara

Now my internist finds I have a mitrial valve problem in my heart which was never discovered before chemo and femara.  Ecocardiagram to determine if I have to have surgery.

I also have very restless sleep_ and anxiety.  I get occassional blurred vision_ sometimes memory blocks_ and dizziness.  I actually fainted recently...first time in my life.,I started taking Femara about 3 months before I had the lumpectomy.  It reduced my tumor almost half it's size.  I am told that since my cancer was hormonal driven_ that Femara is the best treatment to prevent the cancer from returning.  But_ my pain is getting worse with time although it is intermittent.  Some days I don't notice it that much_ other days it is almost intolerable.  My Dr says he wants me to stay on Femara at least another year or so.  It will be 5 years in Sept 2009.  He is aware of the pain but feels it is too risky to go off the Famara.  My concern is the long term affects of this drug.  Is it damaging my muscles_ nerves_ bones_ eyes?  Will this pain go away when I stop taking the drug or is it permanent.  I sometimes fear the cancer has moved to my bones since they hurt so much.  I tell the Doctors this but they don't order tests to find out.,F,55,5  years,7/22/2009,Femara
517, 2, Breast Cancer,Joint pain_ hair loss_ indigestion and reflux_ weight gain_ and blurred vision_ and being hot most of the time.,This is my second breast cancer.  My first was in 1986_ when I had lumpectomy and radiotherapy treatment.  At that time I had auxiliary clearance from the armpit (removing 17 nodes) none of which were effected.  Later I developed lymphoedema.  It was a shock to discover cancer yet again and in the same breast_ but a different type of cancer and in no way associated with the first.  I really had little choice but to have a mastectomy (no one could feel the cancer) it was picked up by regular mammography.  I decided to have a transflap reconstruction_ but ended up 20 days in hospital having 3 operations.  Just a few problems along the way!  My concern with Femora is the blurred vision is causing me problems at work_ trying to see the computer screen - I can more or less live with the other symptoms_ but I do wonder about the weight gain_ if I continue taking the drug at the end of 5 years just how much weight will be gained.  I have always lived a healthy lifestyle_ careful of food and eaten good healthy food_ never junk food_ and never smoked.  I will talk to the breast surgeon soon.  I already have bone density loss since 1988_ and he was concerned that Femora would cause problems.  My bone scan showed no further loss since 1988 - so it was a wait and see.  I am not sure what % better chance I have for survival on Femara_ I wonder is it going to be worth all the side effects.,F,65,4  months,7/17/2009Email,Femara

I called my oncologist and told her I refused to take this drug anymore_ the depression and anxiety are just over the top.  I'll take my chances with the reacurrance of cancer.  I think the drug companies use us all as part of their testing process_ and the long term effects of this drug is not known.  The cost is unbelievable_ no generics available.

I've been on it for a year. I was recently told that I will probably have to stay on it the rest of my life (vs. 5 years). I had bilateral mastectomy with 5 bad nodes. I was ErPr+ and had lobular on one side and ductal on the other. I try not to think about all the bad side effects I'm having & just hope it's working.  I won't know that for sure unless I get a recurrence. I'm on a trial for testosterone cream - it helps the vaginal dryness and bleeding a lot - doesn't do anything for the lack of libido.

So we made a pact: 2 more months of Femara every night to see if I return to the way I was in December.  I'm keeping a journal to document my progress.

Weight gain is a big problem.,For the person who asked how long the side effects take to wear off_ I was on this drug before my mets to my lungs and went off of it because of the inability to walk upright after 6-8 months. I was afraid the damage was permanent. It took just about 2-3 months before I felt like my old self again_ but I did return to normal. That being said_ this time_ after the mets to my lungs_ I had one surgically removed and we have been watching the others. I have one in each lob of each lung and one in the middle. The one in the middle was 3 cm! That's huge. It is now gone. My PET scan on Monday showed no evidence of malignancy anywhere in my body. YES! So_ I have to find ways to stay on this drug. My oncologist advised me to take Glucosamine and Condrointin 3x daily from the beginning and it has helped so much it is hard to describe. I also take fish oil. I am glad to read that exercise helps. Need to do that. Also_ I switched my diet to all organic animal products_ especially dairy. Why take a pill to remove the estrogens and eat someone elses.

567, 1, Breast Cancer,I was on tamoxifen for 3 and a half years. My doctor switch me to femara because of the type to tumors that I had. Tamoxifen had some side effects but nothing like femara. As soon as I took the pills I had severe hip and knee joint pain.  Also I was having to have my glasses changed every six months.  I thought for a while that I was losing my mind. My doctor told me that what I was experiencing was all in my head and that femara did not have any major side effects. I could not even walk up the stairs in my home or read the papers that I had to grade. I would not take this med. again.,,F,57,18  months,4/2/2009,Femara

But i haven't had a reoccurance so I can't complain! I was on about my 3rd yr of taking Tamoxifen when the Femara trials proved so outstanding that my oncologist started me on it instead. The hot flashes have been as bad or worse than w/Tamoxifen and I swear they get worse each year! The weight gain seems to have hit a plateau. I started taking Pilates 4 years ago and it has helped enormously w/joint pain. I started taking Paxil w/Tamoxifen to help with the hot flashes and now take Effexor. I can't say that it helps the flashes that much_ but probably helps me deal with them better. With Effexor_ i never have trouble sleeping  unless i miss a does    and i'm sure it helps with any depression. Overall_ i'm very thankful that this drug is available!

Do have some feeling of depression_ but I'm been trying to counteract that with taking Kava when needed.  Also_ just before I was diagnosed I starting taking Graviola_ Selenium and Vitamin E.  That was the end of November last year (2007).  At that time_ my tumor was measured as 7mm in diameter. When I was operated on early February this year and had a lumpectomy_ the Graviola had shrunk the tumor to just 3mm in diameter.  Once the tumor was examined_ half of it was dead cancer cells and only the other half contained active cancer cells. My surgeon was surprised with the results of the Graviola.,I'll continue to take the Femara as a precautionary measure only_ but the Graviola seemed to kill the cancer cells and did not harm healthy cells and I had NO side effects from the Graviola.

At first the symptoms were subtle but at about 7 months I started noticing that my legs were so stiff after sitting that I could hardly walk when I stood up. This got progressively worse. Also my endurance decreased during exercise at the gym. Finally I started experiencing the strangest sensations of a skin sensitivity on the right side of my body. The way your skin hurts to the touch when you have a fever with the flu_ my upper thigh and groin area and lower right side of my abdomen felt so weird_ it got worse everyday.I went to the oncologist and he told me to go off for 1 month.,I started feeling better within days of going off the Femara. Within one week I was almost back to myself. In 10 days I was absolutely fine_ no more symptoms and I feel great!!I tolerated tomoxifin perfectly for 5 years and I was so pleased that this was going well too_ until the symptoms started. I'm at low risk for reoccurance _ but I must admit that I'm nervous about stopping what can be a benefical treatment.I looked at the Femara as insurance that would keep me a little safer.

However_ in the last month i've become a terrible insomniac and feel like I'm down in the dumps all the time.  Not sure if it's because i only get a few hours of sleep each night or due to the Femara or a combination of both.  I can only fall asleep with the aid of prescription sleeping pills but cannot stay asleep. I'm just miserable with lack of sleep.  I stopped taking the Femara 2 days ago to see if my insomnia and depression improves. Does anyone have any suggestions??

643, 2, Breast Cancer,I had been taking Tamoxifen for 3 years with NO problems_ then they switched me to Arimidex- what I like to call the DARK years.  I thought that chemo was bad but I felt MUCH worse on the Arimidex. It plunged me into severe depression and horrible joint pains but then my tendons started becoming inflamed and I could hardly walk.  I finally had to have surgery as I got a tear in my Achilles tendon_ and then broke the leg in two places after having my cast from the surgery off for a month.  Not a good time_ especially with the sweats and the depression and the feeling that I had cotton for brains.  I found it very difficult to concentrate and used to joke that the only good thing about taking Arimidex was that I was alive to complain about it.  My doctor finally switched me to Femara after two years as I refused to take the Arimidex anymore. I have been more pleased with the Femara as I haven't been depressed or had as much pain but I am going to go off of it now as I am having all kinds,We are alive to be miserable a lot of the time.

It is hard to know if they help or not.,I am trying to complete the five year protocol for Femara_ but my quality of life is not as good as before I took this drug. The problems are a result of not having any Estrogen because this drug keeps your body from producing any Estrogen. The thinning of bones and the high cholesterol counts are a result of no Estrogen. I am worried that after we have taken this drug for 5 years_ later_ it will be discovered that this drug was bad for us just like taking Estrogen turned out to be a bad thing.,F,68,4  years,10/26/2008Email,Femara
645, 2, to prevent breast cancer recurrence,Started off with generalized soreness at 2 months. By 2.5 months knee pain with associated muscle soreness in thighs. Eventually spread to hip_ elbow_ shoulder_ neck/upper back pain. All were bilateral and identical in intensity and on both sides. All involved the general joint and muscle area.  The knees and hips were far worse than anywhere else.Feet swelled a lot by the end of the day--shoes began not to fit even by the next morning. Fatigue/malaise and some days just exhaustion--even driving to work in the morning! I knew something was wrong when I actually thought about resting my head on the steering wheel. Some days I was smarter and just went back to bed.I have no idea if it's related but I got a very nasty respiratory flu each time I took Femara. I haven't had the flu in many years and I get flu shots.,I wanted to take this medication because of my Dr.'s recommendation and the good results in the trials. I took Tamoxifen 5 years with no problems.What a dilemma.  I tried it twice_ about 2.5 months each time_ with 5 weeks in between to get back to normal.I have no allergies and never before had such strong medication side effects.  It became too difficult to work and do normal activities because of the erosion of my stamina and the chronic pain/soreness. I took 2 Aleve at a time_ mostly twice a day. Getting out of a chair and getting in and out of a car were the most painful movements. A short walk helped_ but often getting back was painful! I tried support hose and a low salt diet. I had to take intermittent leave to reduce my work day and to cover me on the exhaustion days. I'm still trying to catch up at work.The best I felt on Femara was when I was in the pool.

I have always had arthritis in my knees and carpal tunnel syndrome_ so I am somewhat used to pain in these areas.  The pain fortunately is not constant.  Usually worse in the am_ but I exercise in the morning_ as well as in the evening.  That definitely helps.  I figure_ if this is what I have to deal with to keep the cancer away_ I will take it.

I try not to take medications for pain_ but find it wakes me up if I don't. I have been taking OPC3 which is a natural mixture of grape seed extract_ wine extract_ pine bark extract_ a very high antioxident and anti-inflammatory and I have had some improvement. Thankfully after seeing this website_ I plan to discontinue Femara to see if these side effects begin to improve_ then I will know for sure that these effects are from that particular medication. I also have been diagnosed with an auto-immune disorder that is causing my lips to swell.

However_ after reading some of the comments I decided to write this for all the young women who may be considering the pros and cons of taking this medication.

So_ be careful about the side effects and even if they aren't listed make a big deal out of it and get your doctors to pay attention.

Once the 5 years is up - I'm in year 4 - then hopefully some of the joys of life that I have been missing for the past while will return.,I feel that if there is a drug that can help reducing the risk of recurrence of a potentially fatal disease then we should at least try.

But you can notice differences after taking the drugs over time.   Hot flashes_ weight gain_ depression were all there with the tamoxifen. Most everything else has either appeared or worsened with Femara.  The Femara has drastically increased my loss of bone mass and added to the GERD which is now affecting my lower esophagus.

I decided to stop Femara and continue with the Mistletoe-Therapie that has helped me through 8 Chemos and 28 radiations.,F,72,2  months,2/3/2008Email,Femara
743, 4, Stage 1 Breast Cancer 2001,Have gained 10 lbs. since starting 1 Year ago.  Walk like Frankenstein after getting out of bed or sitting a long time.  If I have more than 2 glasses of wine_ the next morning I wake extremely ill.  Unbelievable headache_ nausea_ chills.,Following my diagnosis_ I had a lumpectomy_ chemo and radiation.  I took Tamoxifin for 5 Years followed by 1 Year on Femara. My Oncologist said I could go off Femara_ but I am a little nervous to do so because of the fear of recurrance even though it is his belief that I have received the maximum benefits.  If anyone has any comments on this_ I would appreciate hearing from you.  Also_ has anyone had the same issues drinking wine?  That's a real drag!,F,59,1  years,1/29/2008,Femara
744, 3, Breast Cancer,"very sore joint pain.  At first I felt like I was 90 years old.  I have been on it now for almost 4 years.  I'm too afraid to go off of it. Really bad ""brain Fog"" to the point I stoped talking to people because I don't want them thinking I'm crazy.  I was told the reason we have this problem is a lack of estrogen.  This helps us think clearly.  I may be in pain_ but at least I'm alive and watching my children grow up.  I would hate to chose the other option.  You know what I mean.",I have a question for all of you.  I was first diagnosed when I was 37.  Radical masectomy followed with 6 months Chemo.  I was placed on Femara because I tested Positive.  Every where I read it say's not to take Femara if we are Pre-menopausal.  This drug is only for Post-menopausal women.  I'm a little concerned with this information.  My doctor say's it is better for me than Tamoxafin due to the blood clots and all.  I would just like to know if it's dangerous for women who are not yet menopusal like myself.  I also just had a bone scan done and I showed up very dark in all of my joints. My Endro. Doctor say's I look like I have severe arthritis. I would like to hear from anyone who is on this drug and still pre-menpausal and what their doctor had to say about it.  The fact that I also had thyroid cancer has me a little worried about stopping this drug.  Yea I feel like crap half the time_ but I'm alive.  I just want to know if I will be in a wheelchair by the time I'm 60?  Oh yea a,F,41,4  days,1/25/2008,Femara

752, 1, Breast Cancer,Weight gain_ headaches_ joint and muscle pain.,I have been going crazy trying to determine why I am in such pain.  I keep attributing all this pain to my age_ even though at this age I shouldn't feel like this.  I get concerned when I know I have to walk long distances_ I can't take my shirt off over my head because I can't raise my arm_ my ankles_ elbows_ ribs are in constant pain.  I have gone to my doctor and they attribute it to my weight gain (30lbs over weight) and 'in my head'.  I also began to think it was me......FINALLY I realized that the only change in my life for 2 years has been the Femara.  Am stopping taking it TODAY.

755, 3, BC was Stage IIC Invasive,Took Tamoxifen for 2 yrs with side effects that included extreme hot flushes_ nausea (like morning sickness)_ horrible insomnia & headaches.  Switched to Aromasin for next 2 yrs and it was tolerable for the first 6 months with same side effects as Tamoxifen.  Then the bone & joint pain in the outer extremities started. Couldn't get out of a bed or a seated position or do stairs without feeling like a cripple.  Mornings were worse & I too had the 'claw' effect with terrible weakness in my hands. Ankles felt fragile_ as though the bones would break with the slightest pressure.  Once healthy libido disappeared_ urogenital system dried up & cholesterol levels tripled_ although no change in exercise & diet. Doctor switched me to Femara 2 months ago.  After the 1st week_ I actually slept for two whole nights & felt awesome! Then the side effects of the Femara kicked in & it's starting to feel the same as with the Aromasin.,I'm so thankful to have found this website! Over the last few years_ I've so often thought that I was the only one experiencing these awful side effects. Until diagnosis_ I was very fit & worked out 5x/week - weights & cardio. I continued to work & work-out even through chemo cycles. Now I feel like a 90yr old asexual being. Chemo-induced menopause presented its own challenges but these Aromatase-Inhibitor side effects continue to affect the quality of my life.  Doctors are quick to offer Rx for side effects but each Rx has its own risks & side effects. It's a domino effect & I just want to feel 'normal' again & get on with my life.  It would be so different if we were dealing with a broken arm.  An X-ray would show the break_ time would heal the fracture & then it would be nothing but a memory.  Nobody knows if these AI drugs even work on something we don't even know is or isn't there.  Quality vs Quantity of life should be addressed by somebody!,F,50,2  months,1/3/2008Email,Femara

773, 1, Breast Cancer,Im so pissed  what a huge disappointment.  Even it is a good drug for breast cancer the patients have the right to know. The drug companies are so anxious and greedy to get their drugs on the market so they can make money; they intentionally neglect to make an issue about the horrific side effects Femara may cause.  We dont even know the long term affects from this drug.I was also insufficiently warned about the horrible side effects of Femara.  It would have made a world of difference if I was aware of what to expect. More patients may have stayed on it if they were warned because when the side effects start its like hitting a brick wall. I thought I was dying or losing my mind and spent so much time and money with rheumatologists and internists doing tests for over a year only to find that this is a result of the Femara.  At one point they thought I had Leukemia!  The doctors have my complete medical history including all the medications Im,Novartus shows unethical greed!Please email me for the rest of the story or just email me if you find yourself in the same situation.,F,42,2  years,11/20/2007Email,Femara

781, 4, Metastatic Breast Cancer,I was diagnosed with Metastatic Breast Cancer in June of 2006.  The cancer spread to my Colon (primary was never found in my breast).  I'm a rare bird.  The first year I was put on Tomaxifen and my tumor markers continued to rise.  About three months ago I was put on Femara because the tumor came back again in my colon.  Since then I've had very noticeable joint_ bone and muscle pain (even in feet).  I also have chest pain_ palpitations.  Even though I have a mitral valve I think the medication offsets these symtoms.  I wear glasses but my vision seems somewhat more blurred. I even seem to get short term memory losses.  I get off the bus everyday and can't see to remember where I parked my car.  I'm very fatigued and can't sleep so I have to take a sleeping pill every night (Ambien CR) which usually makes you binge.  In the beginning I was getting very bad hot flashes and night sweats but those have gotten better now. Vaginal dryness is the other symptom I have. That something a little,Even though I have majority of the symtoms I'm happier with the fact that my markers have come down alot in just three months.  The joint pain was so bad I could hardly walk sometimes and I felt like I was 90 instead of 46.  But I have some really good news to spread with all of you.  (1) stay as active as you can becuase I find that has been helping me.  I used to be an avid rollerskater and I had not been since surgery.  I recently went back about 1 month ago and can feel a difference.  Not only that_ but I suggest this for all of your out there.  Just ask your doctors_ I did.  (2) PHYSICAL THERAPY - I started going two days a week and it has been working wonders.  I feel like a new person.  My Physical Therapist has decided to JUST do physical therapy for women with Breast Cancer!  I was so happy to hear that.

784, 4, Breast Cancer,I had aching joints_ particularly fingers_ knees_ hips after being on Femara for about three months. Could hardly stand up straight when I got out of bed in the mornings.  Found there were days that were worse than others.  Eventually found that if I ate any of the nightshade family of vegetables (ie: potatoes_ tomatoes_ capsciums_ eggplant_ cayenne pepper and paprika) that the aches were worse and took from three days to a week to subside.  Had a lower level of pain when I did not eat any of the nightshade family of vegetables.  Also found that taking Femara in the morning after I got out of bed meant less stiffness.  Then I sprained my wrist and had to take anti-flamatory tablets for a couple of weeks and all the aches went away.  I then got a low level anti-flamatory (Nurofen)and took two tablets a day (morning with Femara tablet and one before going to bed) for six weeks.  Since I have stopped taking the anti-flamatories I have been pain free.  Recently had a bone scan that showed,,F,59,1  days,10/30/2007Email,Femara

After surgery (partial mast) and radiation I have gone on doctor-recommended fruit-vegetable diet_ exercising 30 mins day at least 5 days a week. Vit D-3 (also doctor-rec) and doing Eastern methods to boost immune system (acupuncture_ Qigong_ Reiki). I've lost 15 pounds (wasn't heavy anyway) just about given up alcohol and look and feel better than past 10 years.I read Ralph Moss ""Questioning Chemotherapy"" prior to my decsion to decline that and am now reading what everyone here is saying about A/I. As a biologist I also appreciate the seriousness of totally upsetting the balance of the endocrine system It seems counter-intuitive to go on a drug that will age me and make me fat and crippled when the NCI itself says exercise and weight magement are key to prevention.

Seven year survivor.,"I took tamoxifen for 4 years -- hot flashes_ gained weight_ cognitive function decline -- not sure all can be attributed to that drug_ or combination of TMX and chemo/radiation.  Switched to Femara 3 years ago.  Stiffness/swelling in right hand began about one year ago.  Had my ovaries removed in Nov. '06 after testing positive for BRCA-2 and have experienced unremitting mid-section weight gain ever since -- no amount of exercise/dieting helps.  Almost as annoying is scalp ezcema and GERD_ for which I now use topical steroids and Prilosec.  Has anyone else experienced these two weird side effects from  Femara?  Could they be from the oopherectomy?  Or is the whole damn thing cumulative?  I highly recommend 15 mg. Adderall XR for ""chemo brain""/memory loss.

The pain and cramping in my legs when walking is horrific.  I have  pain in my hands and fingers. In general my whole body aches.  The oncologist stopped it for 3 weeks in July_ and I got some relief.  I went back on it in August_ and the side effects are back at the same level and perhaps worse. I see the oncologist again in November.  I really don't know if this drug is worth living this way. I am 65 and work as a typist for an answering service.  If this keeps up I will be forced to quit_ and then who pays for this drug????  Medicare is a joke with part D_ when you have this and Diabetes.  I have always been active and a workaholic.  Don't want to sit on my fanny and rot.  I would like to try taking this drug every other day to see if the side effects lessen.  Has anyone else done this?  I would like to hear from you.

Just wanted to be an encouragement to those starting out on the drug - not everyone has the awful side-effects mentioned. I did have minor hot-flashes - perhaps the Effexor helped?,I lost a lot of aspects of my life due to the cancer.

I am looking for a lawyer for a class action suit requiring Novartis to put a black box warning on the enclosure advising patients to have  baseline orthopedic consultation before taking the drug.,Novartis lies to us on the drug.

I don't think I want to feel this way for the next four plus years and it only looks as if it will get worse if I continue the drug.  Quality of life is very important.

I thought it was just me_ but after reading all the comments I know I am not crazy.,After Chemo and taking Femara I developed Congestive Heart Failure_ High Cholesterol and high blood pressure_ my feet began hurting_ joints hurt. Felt like an eighty year old woman. My Mother at 90 got around better than me. I then developed type 2 Diabetes. Now I have terrible neuropothy in my feet. My scalp is dry and ichy and what is SEX?I have forgotten what it is. I have also gained weight_ and of course all the Doctors - Loose weight you will feel better.

Then it mainly was the joint soreness and stiffness with a lot of fatigue.  Today_ the joint soreness continues_ the neuropathy in my feet is now reached just above my ankles. The fatigue is still there. I have a strange feeling like a bruise in my left leg_ but tests have not shown there is anything there.

829, 3, breast cancer,I have had joint pain and muscle pain. I also have burning nerve pain in my elbow and knee. I was tested for bone density and it was low (Osteopenia). My LD cholesterol numbers were high even though I completely changed my diet and exerised a lot. I read that high cholesterol and Osteopenia are also side effects of Femara. I refuse to take drugs for those problems as they have their own side effects. I take Femara to avoid metastases and therefore will continue with it in spite of the side effects. My sister died a year ago of breast cancer metastases; however_ her cancer was Estrogen receptor negative.,I took Tamoxifen for about three years and then my oncologist switched me to Femara. I lost 10# after I stopped Tamoxifen and have since lost 5 more pounds. The odd thing though is that my waist and abdomen size have not changed at all. My waist is 32 inches and my abdomen is 39 inches and that is way too large. I weigh 135 and am 6 feet 7 inches tall. I have read that a lack of Estrogen causes weight gain in the abdomen and waist. Since Femara causes almost a complete lack of Estrogen_ perhaps this is the problem. I wish that I knew.,F,66,3  years,7/5/2007,Femara

836, 3, est+/Her2-/Stg.3 BC/Mdfd Rdcl Maste,I have been taking FEMARA for 5 months in conjunction with a Xolodex shot every 3 mos. and I am experiencing many of the side effects mentioned here. Most espicially swollen joints in my knees_ fatigue_ body aches all over but mainly in my thighs_ unbelievable weight gain that is really hard to get off_ increased appetite yet decreased energy. I used to be extremely active_ work-out at least an hour everyday and now I can't even stand to workout for more than 20 mins maybe 3x/wk. the most i can do is walk. after sitting for lengthy times_ my knees and ankles get tight and walking is difficult for a few mins. i'm not in a serious relationship so no isseus with libido but who knows what lies ahead. overall_ i'm mostly irritated with not being able to work-out or play with my neices because aunty's knees hurt or b/c aunty can't run that fast anymore. it's really heart-breaking and my will is being chipped at little by little. i didn't bargain for this at all_ but at this point_ my options,One patient noted that she uses yoga to excercise_ stretches quite often and gets body massages. I believe this will help with tightness. Also_ does anyone have any suggestions on how to curb appetite? It's crazy_ but if I skip a meal_ my whole body begins to quiver. Even though I know I'm not really hungry_ my body acts as if I haven't eaten in days. To aid with insomnia_ my nurse suggested taking a couple of benadryl's each night since the active ingridient is found in sleep aides. That has helped a lot. Overall_ I'm not happy with the effects I'm experiencing. Does anyone have any natural remedies and does anyone have any idea if this will affect my chances of having children in the future?

846, 2, Infertility,I didn't feel any side effects at all while taking this medication.  However_ a few weeks later_ I found out that I developed an ovarian cyst_ which may be a side effect of this medication.  Unfortunately_ this means that I will have to wait on the sidelines for approx. 3 weeks in hope that the cyst resolves before starting another treatment cycle.,This medication is used off label for ovarian stimulation.  Its use for this indication is controversial.  A Canadian study suggested there is an increased risk of congenital malformations among infants born to mothers who used this medication for ovulation induction. However_ there are criticisms of this study ( in particular_ the control group was comprised of normal healthy women who had infants naturally with no medical assistance; also_ the half life of femara is fairly short so at least theoretically harm to a developing fetus would seem unlikely). A subsequent study comparing Femara and clomid showed no significant difference in the rate of congenital anomalies.  The main benefit of Femara (vs. Clomid) seems to be fewer side effects.  Whether or not you think its worth the risk of potential harm to a developing embryo is up to you to decide.,F,35,5  days,5/18/2007,Femara

Have had headaches_ huge weight gain_ memory loss_ dry eyes_ unbearable vaginal dryness_ five bladder infections_ slight incontinence and depression. I saw my Oncologist yesterday and he agreed with me. I'm done. Did five years of Tamoxifin and that is it. It is very hard to say no to what sounds like an insurance policy against b/c. However_ I'm wondering if the pharmaceutical company's aren't pushing Femera for those extra years because of the cash. They did it with HRT. Luckily I didn't bite.

My oncologist switched me to Femara at that time.  I feel like either of these drugs is an ""insurance"" against a recurrance and would be scared to death not to take anything.  I never realized that insomnia could be due to the Femara.  I do exercise and have been taking violin for the past 4 years_ which surprisingly makes my hands feel a bit better.

If there is memory and cognitive loss_ then I would have to think about long term effects_ both for brain health and cancer treatment outcome. When I mentioned hair loss and memory_ my doctors stated that they were not aware of these as side effects. Voiced that they did not know of any cross brain barrier effect with Femara.  Some times I think the doctors are comparing Femara to Tomoxafine and saying_ look you don't have stroke or blood clots_ etc._ or there just isn't an adequate tracking system set in place regarding side effects.
