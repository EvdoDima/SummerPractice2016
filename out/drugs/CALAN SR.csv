2, 4, premature ventricular beats,nil side effects,before taking Isoptin I was experiencing frequent disturbing symptoms of the premature ventricular beats (anxiety_ lightheadedness) which resulted in my going to the outpatient department of my local hospital on quite a few occasions. Since being on Isoptin SR 120mm once per day for the last six years the symptoms have virtually disappeared.,M,64,6  years,8/17/2007Email,Calan sr
