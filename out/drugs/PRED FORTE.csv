0, 1, ,Cushingoid symptoms_ weight gain,Used this long-term at high doses_ then tapered. Was told this could not be absorbed systemically.  However there are a few case reports in the literature of systemic effects_ and I appear to be another. Based on moon facies_ Cushingoid appearance_ geneticist took me off the med and advised me not to use it in the future.,,,20  years 6X D,5/26/2015,Pred forte
1, 3, after eye surgery,Mild stinging in eye; unpleasant bitter taste drips down into back of mouth; ears ringing; probabably also related to cold/allergy symptoms (scratcy throat_ congestion_ post-nasal drip).,I don't know what would happen if I didn't use this after DSEK surgery - maybe nothing_ or maybe the graft would have failed by now.  I am also using Xibrom anti-inflammatory.  I will stop the Xibrom soon but unfortunately I'm supposed to use the Pred Forte indefinitely_ eventually at 1 drop per day.  Both of these can cause worse problems than I have so far.,M,66,13  days1 drop 4X D,10/5/2010,Pred forte
