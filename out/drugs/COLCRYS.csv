3, 1, Behcet's,I did not have any gastrointestinal problems at all like others experience.  I did_ however_ have a lot of hair loss.

4, 5, gout,diarrhea,I was taking colcrys only when I had a gout attack. Those attacks started coming every 5 to 10 days. I talked with my Dr. and told him why not take colcrys as a maintenance drug. I started taking colcrys 1 every day. The attacks stoped. I am now taking colcrys every other day and have not had gout since January 2012. I gave the drug 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do for me. One more thing for gout suffers. I know this will not be true for all of you but I was taking meds for high blood preasure a number of those meds put some people at a far higher risk for gout. I believe this happened to me.,M,60, 0.6MG 1X O,7/3/2012Email,Colcrys
5, 5, suspected gout,The first day i felt a little nauseas but after that it's been fine.,"I started taking colcrys 10 days ago after a month long series of unexplainable severe joint pains in my ankle_ knee and then elbow. I plan to stay on it.  I have not had a gout flare in 10 days. i haven't felt really good like this in about 3 months. I've tried to avoid red meat_ beer_ shellfish but still drink red wine. i think i began having gout flares years ago when I tried to lose weight on the atkins diet and was eating a lot of red meat. I'm 6'0"" and 240 lbs. keeping my fingers crossed that I have no more pain.",M,47,10  days.6 mg 2X D,12/16/2011,Colcrys
6, 1, Gout,Swollen lips_ milk-white slime on tongue and in mouth_ raspy voice.,Colchicine was removed from distribution in September of 2010_ even though it had been used for gout_ in a variety of forms_ since 500 AD.  Now_ Colcrys is the only replacement.  Obviously_ I am allergic to Colcrys which worries me greatly as I used Colchicine to thwart off gout attacks.  Without Colchicine I anticipate unnecessary pain and suffering.,F,64,1  days.6 mg 1X AN,6/27/2011Email,Colcrys
7, 5, PERICARDITIS   COLCHICINE ONLY!,NONE that I was aware of.  Please know that I was taking COLCHICINE by Westwari ... and I could not find that listing in RATE THIS MEDICINE.,I TOOK COLCHICINE NOT COLCRYS .. by Westwari .. not able to locate plain old Colchicine!Normally_ colchicine was prescribed for Gout.  I had INFLAMMATION OF THE PERICARDIAL SAC ... and Pericarditis!I was originally on DIGOXIN... but there were so many side effects from that_ they had to take me off of it and substituted COLCHICINE!It seemed to take care of the problem along with LOTS OF IBUPROFEN/400mg/tab_ 2 tabs 3x's per day!! for two months. Very scary when you take that along with Aspirin also.  I was waiting for a bleed to occur!,M,71,6  weeks0.6mg 1X D,10/29/2010Email,Colcrys
