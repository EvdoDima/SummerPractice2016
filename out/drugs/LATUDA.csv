0, 1, Bi polar,Anxiety especially 1to 2 hrs after taken. Dr. Kept upping dose to 80mg. Involuntary muscle jaw movement @ 80. Reduced dose with continued anxiety slight tremor noticed by internal med. psych said stop it. Fortunately I had read patient responses to taper & it was still difficult to get off. Off 1 month no panic attacks which were not a problem pre Latuda. Thank God tremor not permanent,Some reviews say miracle drug which is fantastic. I post worse drug I've ever been on because it was patient reviews that made me connect the dots on how terrible this drug was for me & to taper off,F,56,1  yearsUp to 80mg,8/14/2016,Latuda
1, 3, Severe anxiety_ psychotic features,I was very tired after taking this after dinner. I was shaky and trembling  on it_ and I my leg muscles felt weak_ like I almost couldn't or didn't want to walk to places. It helped in some ways with my anxiety and social withdrawal. I felt faint on it_ and I had my blood pressure checked and it was low_ which isn't normal for me- I always have normal or high blood pressure and I take high blood pressure pills. Always sleepy_ and just wanting to stay in bed and sleep. I noticed people would get red around me_ like being around me on this med increased their blood pressure.,It helped me in ways with my anxiety (I was able to walk across a crowded shopping center to get a Smoothie- this I would normally never do). I only took it for 1 week_ as per the directions of my psychiatrist_ and I wonder if I should have taken it longer_ for at least 2 weeks_ to see if my body and mind adjusted better to the side effects. I also didn't like always feeling weak and faint on it; I would be walking somewhere and feel faint and a little nauseaus_ almost like I was going to pass out_ but this could have also been due to my anxiety_ which it also heightened in some ways. I'm unsure if these side effects would have gone away if I gave it more time.,F,33,7  days20 mg 1X D,7/23/2016Email,Latuda

3, 1, anxiety or ?? who knows?,1/2 hours of feeling good_ perhaps an hour_ and that night I ended up in the emergency room,Expensive. A brief window of experience that made me think this was finally a good drug to help me. Then_ a few hours later_ cardiology symptoms that made it necessary to go to the emergency room.

5, 2, Bipolar Disorder Type 1,Latuda made my heart beat pretty fast it made me feel like I was overheating it is always cold in our flat yet my neck and back would be so sweaty they stated it makes you feel drowsy until your body gets used to it but that's not the case with me it made me yawn and feel drowsy constantly no matter the time I'd take it do you know how annoying it is when your body isn't tired but your mind thinks it is? Also it caused me to shiver constantly my teeth were always chattering that's annoying as heck too I'd have to take the medicine my psychologist prescribed me for anxiety_tremors and shivers to help get rid of the teeth chattering I'd have to walk or take a shower or read a book to occupy my mind it made my anxiety worse and don't get me started on the akathisia it got so bad once that the ambulance had to come get me and the hospital had to help me get some sleep they thought I was trying to harm myself again I've recently flushed it down the loo cause I can't take the horrible side effects any more. I would rather deal with my bipolar disorder the way I was before I got on latuda.,If your doctor suggests this to do not accept ask them is there anything else they can give you the medication sucks and should have been approved by the FDA.,M,23,2  months20 MG,6/24/2016,Latuda

Cold chills and hot flashes.,I am very sensitive to medicines but I thought I would give it a try. After day 2 of taking the medicine all of my side effects became extremely worse and I had to go to the e.r. The muscle pains_ nasea_ and vomiting were so bad I didn't know what to do except cry. I am now taking medicine for the nasea and pain until that subsides.,F,25,2  days20 mg,6/18/2016Email,Latuda
7, 1, Bipolar I and PTSD,Extreme diarrhea!! I read a ton of reviews_ I had really high hopes for this medication. It has been a nightmare. Jittery_ on edge_ ringing in ears_ restless legs_ and diarrhea. I finally gave up after 3 days and switched back to Seraquel. I'm still feeling the side effects of Latuda. I read it takes four days for the medication to be completely out of your system. Please be careful when talking this. Talk to your doctor about all of the side effects.,,F,27,3  days25MG,6/14/2016,Latuda
8, 3, PTSD AND PREGNANCY,Weird feeling in my legs and feet _ restlessness_ sometimes racing breathing like I wanna go for a run,Huge help only safe one for me to take in my pregnancy_ only reason why I give this a less rating is because the leg thing is unbearable. Seems to get worse as the dose increases. I can't tell if the crying spells are Latuda or pregnancy but it's for no good reason it doesn't make me more depressed just makes me cry,F,20,3  weeks40 mg,5/23/2016,Latuda

10, 2, to help with depression,I've been off and on this since last fall about. 20mg at dinner_ then it takes forever to sleep_ next day I feel sedated and drugged_ a hangover feeling and all I want to do is sleep_ this is not good to enjoy life_ and its the lowest dose. I'm cutting it in half tonite to see. I only take cymbalta at am. So what is my problem and what should I do? Maybe its not for me.,Any comments would be appreciated,F,58,5  months20 mg,5/7/2016Email,Latuda
11, 2, Bipolar 1,Extreme nausea_ trouble sleeping,I take it at night and within the hour it makes me sleepy but I wake up during the night a lot feeling restless_ and I am constantly waking up at 5 unable to go back to sleep. The nausea is terrible_ I mean I slept in the bathroom last night so I could have easy access to the toilet. I haven't been taking it very long but the nausea is unbearable.,F,21,5  days20 MG,5/5/2016,Latuda
12, 5, PTSD,First few days horrible side effects and felt way worse depressed after the 6 th day noticed a huge difference. No longer on 6 pills. Just one.

13, 4, Bipolar depressive + anxiety,Sleepiness within about an hour and a half to where I literally have to find a bed or I'll just curl up wherever I am and fall asleep_ sometimes nausea,This medication has helped me emotionally an incredible amount. The first night I took it I was very nauseous and thought I had the flu. Since then I find that as long as I eat at least 300-500 solid calories right before taking it_ I'm fine. The sleepiness is a problem in that I'm a college student and need to be able to stay up late to do homework_ so if I am forced into bed by my medication right after dinner it's quite difficult to get everything done. But the fact remains that this medication has helped me feel better than I have in years and I finally feel like a human being - reminds me of when I got my glasses and thought to myself_ is this how everyone else can see? This good feeling is what I've been missing out on! Latuda has helped me a lot and I'm okay with the side effects for that reason.,F,19,3  weeks40mg,4/1/2016,Latuda

15, 1, Bipolar II,Immediately nauseous on first taking it. Also a bit dizzy and very unsteady on feet. This eased after a few hours. However after second dose I was same all day. After third dose I had severe out of body feelings and nightmares. Still nauseous. When I woke up next morning I still did not feel well and as morning went on I got much worse. Had feeling of tongue swelling_ trouble speaking and trouble breathing. Luckily husband was with me and took me to hospital emergency ward where I had to be given adrenalin. They were not certain what happened but assumed allergic reaction to Latuda_ but thought strange as had taken it 14 hours before. Nothing else had changed in what I was taking or eating though.,Beware. I have tried just about all the available drugs to treat Bipolar II over the last 10 years and never had anything like this experience.,F,46,3  days20 mg 1X D,3/28/2016,Latuda

17, 2, Bipolar type 1,Confused_ weight gain_ sleeping_ no energy,The first two weeks on this I felt great it helped a lot with sucidal thoughts and psychosis. Then I had no energy and motivation to do anything. I was tired all the time and tried to sleep but couldn't. I was also confused a lot. Like I couldn't remember any thing. I gained a good 25 pounds while on this mainly because I craved carbs while taking it. I recently decided to quit cold turkey and while its only been a couple of days I have so much energy now and I am not craving carbs. This medicine sucks. I hope one day they will have better options for bipolar disorder.,F,28,3  months20 mg,2/14/2016,Latuda

19, 5, BiPolar Disorder,I have trouble getting going in the morning. It's almost noon before I feel awake.,It's made a huge difference in my life.

20, 1, Bipolar 1,Horrible akanesia! Tried it a year ago during a bad depression. It bumped me at the 40 mg but the akanesia was a new kind of torture so I was forced to stop. Began it again a year later for another bout of depression with psychotic features. 20 mg with 25 mg of  benydril and I did well but again when I titrated to the 40 mg I experienced extreme stomach upset and unbearable akanesia_ even accompanied by 2 doses of 50 mg benydril.,It's worth a try if you're desperate but for me_ it's one of the most hellish drugs out there.,F,40,2  weeks20-40 mg,1/12/2016,Latuda
21, 2, Mood Disorder NOS_ Depression,Nausea_ diaharrea  Increased anxiety_ manic like state_ agitation shakiness_ restlessness_ basically feeling like I had too much caffeine times 10.,This medication made me feel like I had 10 cups of coffee or something_ and I have a major caffeine sensitivity. It made me feel sick_ anxious and basically put me in an agitated and manic state. It did help with my depression a bit_ but it made my anxiety and mood problems worse. I don't remember what dosage I was on_ but it was a low one_ since my doctor always starts me on the lowest dose then usually has me cut it in half because I'm so sensitive to medication. It was also a f***ing pricey medication because I got perscribed it when it first hit the market. I was so disappointed that I paid like $70 for something that didn't even work.,F,20,1  monthsDon't Know 1X D,12/29/2015,Latuda
22, 4, Schizophrenia/Bipolar,Since my previous post I am still taking Latuda and haven't had anything to drink at all.  I have also been hospitalized twice since my last post.  I will probably be taking medication for the rest of my life.  I used to work full-time in the medical field and owned a  house before I became sick so a lot has changed.  Now I have my life centered around God_ going to church groups_ and being active in my church.  My weight is still higher than it was without taking it.

Prescribed sleeping aids don't work for me. Also couldn't deal with the nausea and stomach issues induced by this drug. Luckily_ I haven't had any of the more severe symptoms.

29, 1, Depression and mild bipolar,"I was sitting in my husbands hospital room ( he had cancer surgery) and I took morning dose with my coffee.  In about 15-20 minutes I began bobbing my head uncontrollably and my husband rang for a nurse.  I became non responsive by the time she ran in the room and she immediately called for ""rapid response team"".  I don't recall anything after my head started bobbing_ all I know is I came to about 4 hours later in the ER. I was admitted and tested for stroke.  I basically went in to a ""temporary coma"".  All test results were negative_ thus ruling out any other cause than a severe allergic reaction to the drug.  I do suffer depression but am now terrified to take anything at all.  I am trying to find a lawyer that will take my case.  The hospital filed my insurance with the diagnosis of ""severe and highly potential threat to loss of life"".",Had I been home alone or anywhere else for that matter_ I would have died.

31, 3, psychosis,I'm currently taking this medication for over 2 years for treating my psychosis episode i had two years ago. I would have to say it absolutely made me lose weight significantly (around 20 pounds) because if I didn't have a full stomach or meal properly digested_ I would vomit it all out instantly. I did have slight dizziness if I took it with my other medications and there were times I would wake up confused or a headache. Other than that_ it helped with my psychosis and enables me to fall asleep (which I so desperately need on a regular basis being a full time student and working full time).,I would suggest taking this with meals (350 calories or more) and fully digested before taking this medication to prevent nausea and vomiting,F,19,2  years20 mg,11/14/2015,Latuda

I am severely paranoid as well as annoyed with everyone I work with. Things that I would simply let go or ignore_ I'm harboring rage and paranoia about. I have tried every bi-polar med you can name and absolutely nothing worked. I was looking forward to being ""fixed"" as just another over-represented statistic of females diagnosed with depression. I'm sticking with my mood-stabilizer and getting off this crap. Expect the FDA to be shady and don't question why they allow this stuff. The FDA turns a blind eye to a lot of things including human testing in developing countries on the poor and desperate...and everyone is so concerned about the poor animals. I have a close friend that works for a pharmecutucal company. You'd be disgusted. I can't give this drug another minute of my being.

Because of my experience on it_ I have developed traumatic shock. I would never ever recommend this horrifying drug to anyone. It was a life changer for me in that I know have less trust in any medication. Everyone around me noticed the changes and I almost went to the emergency room before getting in contact with my doctor and driving in the middle of the night to a pharmacy to get benztropin and sleeping pills. I got off the drugBut the worst part was all of this happened around my 26th birthday and I was completely not myself. I can't stress enough how traumatic this was for me. My whole body was shaking_ my teeth chattering_ I could barely speak_ I couldn't stop walking around_ and that was immediately after taking the meds every night. The doctor said maybe try a lower does but I said NO I will never take this drug again.

50, 3, Bipolar depression,"I've been on latuda for 3 weeks and two days now. The first week 20 mg_ second 40 mg and now 60 mg. I have been experiencing extreme fatigue and muscle weakness an hour or so after taking the medication (around 6-7pm) which makes me want to crawl Into bed. Once I crawl Into bed I start to feel that inner restlessness feeling_ or ""akathisia"". I think its uncommon to feel it while feeling extremely fatigued at the same time but I do. I feel extremely anxious and I want to crawl out of my skin and my legs won't stop moving but I'm too tired to actually get up. I payed no mind to any of this until recently. I thought the reasons behind my symptoms were that I had been waking up at 4am or 7am for work and for school without taking naps during the day so I figured that's why I'm so tired. But I read the latuda medication guide and came across the word akathisia and saw that muscle weakness was another side effects of the drug and I began to worry. I'm still on the medication.

51, 5, Depression_  Bipolararity,Slight akathesia (feelings of inner restlessness) for an hour after taking the pill,"I'm on week two of Latuda and it has been the best med for sure so far. I have severe OCD_ anxiety disorder(s)_ ADHD_ and what the psychiatrist calls ""bipolararity"" (racing thoughts_ irritability_ moodiness) - which could just be symptoms of severe anxiety or something different on there own. After trying just about every psych med made_ Latuda has been the best. I take this in combination with 300mg Luvox and 40mg Vyvanse. Within a week the ""impending doom"" depressed feeling lifted and I felt more motivated to do things that needed to be done (versus feeling overwhelmed by the thoughts and OCD). Often times I felt so overwhelmed I would just go to bed but I now feel optimistic about things and am doing things that would normally send me to bed depressed and overwhelmed_ I find it easier to talk to people also as I feel my generalized anxiety has been significantly reduced. I use to have ""Sunday dread"" fearing the upcoming week but that has since become much more tolerable.

57, 1, Bipolar depression,From the very least dosage I was on_ I had severe nausea. Even though I would eat more than 350 calories. We added a nausea medication for me to take twice a day and I still experienced severe nausea that resulted in me throwing up every single night. I did experience some gains from the medication such as elevated mood and a more stable mood.

61, 4, Bipolar depression,I haven't noticed any side effects I can directly attribute to Latuda.,I'm having night sweats and hot flashes/sweating_ but I also recently stopped HRT for menopausal symptoms (as a trial to see whether I still needed it)_ so it's impossible to know which is causing the symptoms;  however_ I'm pretty sure it's stopping the HRT_ as I wasn't having a problem until then.  It took a few weeks_ but Latuda brought me out of a long term depressive episode.  I felt like myself for the first time in years!  But...the past few days I've felt depressed again_ so I'm wondering whether increasing the dose may help since I only take 20 mg.,F,57,60  days20 mg 1X D,4/2/2015Email,Latuda
62, 3, Depression / Anxiety,Chest pain like a major panic attack,For a few days_ I thought I'd finally found a drug that did the things all the others were supposed to do. OCD thoughts about stressful events receded into the background and no longer dominated_ painfully_ my daily life. But on the 7th day I had relentless chest pain and my blood pressure skyrocketed to 177/120 with a pulse of 51. I foolishly did NOT call paramedics_ thinking this was anxiety related...or something. I reported it my doc who said_ stop taking it. A few days later the chest pains subsided completely. We tried using 10 mg and within six hours_ the chest pains were back. It was really a big disappointment to have that side effect because the drug had plugged me into exactly the right place. I had a much needed distance and relief from all the stressful_ painful thinking that had plagued me for the last two years. At one point I felt this wonderful sense of internal pleasure. I couldn't believe it. It was a taste of what could be possible but the heart palpitations and chest pain became such a big risk_ even with just 10 mg._ that I had to stop using it. Someday they'll have a med like this that works only on the brain and doesn't have the side effects. When that day comes_ people with GAD/Depression_ and others with even more difficult problems_ will finally get real relief. I hope others find the really good feelings I did but without any bad side effects.,M,68,8  days20 mg 1X D,4/2/2015,Latuda

All of these side effects dissipated after two weeks of taking the medication (I started out at 20mg and then moved to 40mg after 2 weeks). At first_ Latuda seemed to pull me out of a depressive episode. It gave me the energy to get off of my couch and live my life. A few months later_ suicidal thoughts began. They increased in severity so much that I attempted suicide three times during the time I spent on Latuda. Latuda made me feel panicky like I had never felt before. I was so panicked at night that I would hide under my covers and shut my eyes. I couldn't handle stimuli when I felt like that (which_ when I went up to 80 mg_ was every night). That being said_ I had no weight gain with this drug.,After going off of Latuda_ I feel so much better. I no longer feel so anxious that I want to die.

77, 1, Bipolar 1 Disorder,For the first three weeks_ I didn't have any side effects_ but maybe I just couldn't tell. I was prescribed Latuda during a depressed episode_ so I wasn't really getting out of bed. Finally my mood picked right up_ I felt amazing_ but not TOO amazing_ just good in a normal way. That lasted for maybe five days_ and then I could hardly get out of bed in the morning. It wasn't my mood_ I wanted to get up_ but I was so exhausted. It would take me about three hours to finally wake up. Then I developed two horrible side-effects - panic attacks like I've never had before_ and paralyzing exhaustion. Soon my parents and I realized that it occurred about two hours after I took the med (at 4 pm). I was going to bed for the night at around 6:30 every day after serious panic attacks.,Yesterday_ as per my doctor's instructions_ I didn't take the medication. No panic attacks_ stayed up until 11 that night_ no naps. I was totally fine. It's too early to tell the long term impact of stopping the med_ but at the same time we're raising my lithium_ so we'll see how that goes. There is also this hot-cold problem going on with this medication - it would give me fits (I was also hypo-manic after the depression a bit ago) because I couldn't get comfortable at night. I did gain some weight_ about 10 pounds_ but for a lot of the time I was on this med I was sleeping all day_ except to get up and eat_ so this is expected I suppose.,F,18,6  weeks30 mg 1X D,1/14/2015,Latuda

127, 1, Mood disorder,I was always exhausted_ to the point of drinking multiple cups of coffee a day and taking hour long naps before going to bed early.

128, 1, bipolar/major depressive disorder,Was not sure why the doctor chose to switch me to this med from Effexor XR which I had been on for years and it was working well.  Because I was in the hospital I chose not to fight the system & took the med.  Within 1 week I noticed the worst of my personal side effects....weight gain....Within 3 weeks I had gained almost 20 lbs!!  I discontinued the med & returned to Effexor.  My understanding is that weight gain is not a big side effect_ I disagree.  Since the med stays in your system for a week or so after you discontinue I continued to gain weight.  I gained almost 30 lbs before it stopped.  As with all weight gain med or otherwise gained; I haven't been able to lose it yet.  I really didn't notice any mental problems.,I know all meds are different for each person.  My suggestion to people that easily gain weight would be to really discuss with your MD before just blindly taking.  Side effects are hard to manage; always discuss with your Doctor & don't be afraid to ask a million questions so you really understand the medications.,F,49,30  days80 1X D,4/14/2014,Latuda

I think that is good_ as I noticed the great awakening.  If you are having issues son did at first_ it took 30 days and close attention to find that the FOOD was his problem_ not the med.  We have awesome results when he takes the food with medication.  I will post back after we get the routine better.  He has had mixed results though because what seemed to be too low of a dose  and possible too much activation was in fact him not getting any medicine so illness back with a vengence and or a partial dose which was too activiating.  The same result we got from geodon.,Like I said_ I will post back later_ but this medication has promising results with 0 side effects for son.  I think we have hit the one which can be difficult.  Everyone is different.  And like with Geodon_ too low of a dose can be activating_ nervousness & all the other bad stuff.

They helped_ but the grogginess and blahness sucked.  I feel normal with no side effects.  Lots of people get akisthisia which I avoided by cutting the smallest pill size in half to start slowlly.  Surprisingly_ it is all I need.  I also take Lamictal 50mg_ Lithium 600mg_ Zoloft 200mg.

183, 3, Bipolar I w/psychosis,I noticed an almost immediate improvement in the Latuda healing the symptoms of auditory and visual hallucinations. It also quickly improved my feelings of extreme rage_ and irritability.  However_ I have developed severe problems with low blood sugar since I've been on the Latuda treatment. This isn't suppose to be a side affect of the Latuda_ however_ metabolic changes_ hypergylcemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes are side affect risk affects.  My Psychiatrist just switched me from 40 mg to 20 mg_ I'll start the new dosage tonight.  I also have a scheduled appointment with an endocrinologist in August to further research the low blood sugar problem.  Has anyone else out there noticed a problem with low blood sugar. Blurry vision_ shakiness_ sweating/feeling faint_ dizzy_ etc.  I had a fasting glucose tolerance test in the early part of May and it confirmed my blood sugar level was at that time_ 45_ and I was diagnosed as hypoglycemia.

THEY WARN YOU ABOUT IT,"I was prescribed Latuda and noticed positive results almost immediately.  I had much more energy and could think more clearly.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this drug! Taking a lot less other psych meds.CHECK OUT YOUR PSYCHIATRISTMy ""Psychpharmacologist"". Had me on 9 psch meds and 4supplements at the same time. I cold barely walk and talk. After having TD so bad I had entire body spasms and could not sleep. I researched the interaction between Latuda and Diltiazam and I  IMMEDITELY went back to this quack and and told him about it_ and All he did was reduce the Latuda from 80mg to 40mg_ added 2 drugs and 3 supplements Two days later I was in the hospital with cardiac arrhythmia. I called him and asked if any of these meds would cause this heart condition_ less than  his RECEPTIONIST came back and said no.  While I has hospitalized THEY TOOK ME OFF THE DILTIAZAM and the TD DISAPPEARED BY 99% I took AP's for 35 yrs When I came home Ilooked all the interactions of all meds I take. Most of the psych meds he had prescribed psych meds can cause arrythmias! The only psych meds I take now are LATUDA! Lamictal and Nuvigil. No recurrence of symptoms_ no more arrythmia.  Drastic improvement in all areas. I have been able to think to the level I used to ( I have an IQ of 142).  I have so much more energy that I have been able to clean my house_ enjoy hobbiesand talk.I am confident that I will continue to have positive results with Latuda",F,65,1  years40 1X D,5/25/2012Email,Latuda
185, 5, Bipolar I,"I've been through the mill_ and this is the best drug I've come across to meet my mood stability_ sleep_ weight_ and mental clarity needs.  At the beginning_ there was some definite ""jelly legs_"" but that was one year ago and it went away.","I have not been this mentally lucid since my original diagnosis 10 years ago.  This drug allowed me to get about 7 hours of sleep/night and my cholesterol went from 252 to 193 in just 7 1/2 weeks.  This drug's effectiveness has allowed me to work a full-time job for the first time in a decade!!!  My psychiatrist_ therapist_ family_ and friends have ALL noticed this.  All I can say is that it worked for me.  I don't know about how it'll work for other people.  FYI_ I was usually on the more hypomanic side of things.  I would go to the hospital for rapid cycling.  Major depression_ then mania.  When I was on Geodon_ I literally gagged or vomited daily.  I slept 10-11 hours/day and thought that was supposed to be normal.  It took me changing doctors to find this drug.  It had only been on the market for a few months_ but I decided_ ""Well_ why not?  Geodon's killing me financially and I'm tired of the vomiting and sleep problems.""  My old MD actually told me that she thought my Master's degree might ""come to nothing"" and that I might have to ""be on Social Security Disability.""  I have been told by an even older MD that I ""cannot have a baby.""  An MD before that said that I had to make a choice between being fat and stable and thin and unstable.  What?  Guess what?  They were all wrong!  My current MD said_ ""Are you kidding?  Of course you can have a baby!  All I'd do would be to put you off the clonazepam.

Never had problem with this anxiety this severe before -- it may lead to my choosing another antipsychotic (although I think I've tried most of them.)  I am not a zombie like I was on Zyprexa.

Abilify and Geodon were no good because of adverse effects. Risperdal was wonderful for a long time_ but then I developed involuntary muscle twitches_ and I was depressed on a lower dose. I've been on Latuda for almost four weeks (with the risperdal for first 2 weeks)_ though initially there were some sleep problems_ I find I have more energy and have lost some of the weight gained on the risperdal. My mood is back up as well. So far so good! Oh also_ I take it at night with about a 100 calorie snack_ and my stomach has been fine.,F,21,4  weeks40 MG 1X D,4/14/2012,Latuda
189, 2, Bipolar 2 with psychosis,"Groggy at first and kind of like sitting on a cloud ""out of it"" as I transitioned off yet ANOTHER antidepressant that didn't work and made things worse. Finally grabbed BP2 diagnosis and tried this med to busy up major depressive state. After a few days I thought I was getting better only now the energy is not manic_ but angry/ragey/pissy/extremely agitated. Feel paranoid and blowing things out of proportion again. Very self deprecating. Hopelessness starting to set in that_ once again_ no med works for my crazy backwards brain. I'm itching and restless and almost agoraphobic in fear of losing it with uncontrollable outbursts of rage or tears to some presumed affront. Want and need stabilization so I'm trying to figure out why I'm on an anti psychotic for schizophrenia?! Weight gain is creeping in so it's a matter if time before I call the dic and say lets try something else. I'm not feeling the benefits other than I'm not hypo manic up all night detached from reality taking like I'm high and elated and full of unhealthy energy that crashes without a moments notice. Thought that was why latuda was working--seemed to have some mood stabilization and not as many freak outs but now it feels like its spiraling back to square one.

Besides taking away paranoia_ voices_ and delusions with negative symptoms as well_ it's stopped me from overreacting about everything and having racing thoughts.

193, 1, Bipolar II,HORRIBLE agitation,Latuda is a terrible drug. I cannot believe people don't slit their own throats while on this. I felt like bugs were crawling all over my bones. I couldn't sit still. I would go into these intense mini-manias every night where I would be agitated_ crying hysterically_ walking in circles. I felt like tearing my hair out and screaming and running down the street all at the same time. Uncontrollable physical and mental agitation. My doctor failed to mention this relatively common side effect. When I brough it up_ she totally knew the name for this side effect and how it feels. I can't remember the exact word she used_ but she said the bugs crawling on your bones is a known side effect. Ugh it was just awful! This agitation went away within 2 days of stopping the med.
