1, 3, depression overwhelmed anxiety,Anger outbursts worse than before. I'm screaming and little things are setting me off horribly. I feel like i now have less control over my rage and am vocalizing it wayyyyy more than before med. Crying for no apparent reason or at the thought of going to work tomorrow. Ringing in my ears. Weird feeling in my head when I first take pill. Very vivid dreams (not bad ones). Clenching my jaw.,I was told it can take 2-4weeks for benefits to show so I am trying to fight through it. Hoping to get out of my negative mindset_ have more energy_not get anxiety in social situations_ have more self worth_ do activities I once enjoyed_ keep my house clean_ you know just go be a part of society and enjoy life. First 3 days were doable because it was better than the weeks before I started taking med.Today was horrendous. I am angry and lashing out even at my poor kid and my eyes keep leaking tears all day off an on. Overall today is crappy. Ringing in ears all day! If it lasts through tomorrow I probably will lose my job so hoping tomorrow is bearable. (not meds fault about job that is my personal issue) just wish it was instant relief from anger outburst and crying.,F,33,4  days150x2,6/20/2016,Bupropion hcl

I had energy_ a will to live_ and my depression was much better. This garbage they replaced it with is unreal...I believe it's manufactured in India and seems like there are a host of unpleasant_ foreign ingredients in this new mix. I don't care what any pharmacist or doctor says about generic being the same as brand ( same active ingredients) that's a complete lie. Your patients are not crazy_ they are depressed.

I was a complete zombie from the moment I took the first dose.  One hour after my first dose I couldn't remember anything and if I had taken my meds or not.  Took a second dose of all meds because I didnt remember. Day 2 I woke up in a fog that never lifted.  By that night I was so confused and uncoordinated I fell out of bed and had to crawl to the bathroom.  Day 3 the depression was so out of control and again had issues making it to the bathroom.  Ran straight into the wall and slid down like a cartoon and had to crawl into the bathroom.  Day 4  my family was concerned because my speech was impaired and super slow and I wasn't making any sense when I could string a few words together. I couldnt make a complete thought.  Depression through the roof and thoughts of suicide entered. Confused fog all day sat and stared at wall for the entire day_ felt like it wasnt me.  Day 5 I woke up in a fog felt like I was a marionette and someone else was pulling the strings swallow pilld by the handful all the while I was watching myself doing it not actually feeling like I was doing it.  Was completely detached like an out of body experience.  Woke up 3 days later in ICU on life support_  Apparently my roommate found me unresponsive and no pulse I had no idea what had happened and only vaguely remember anything after I stuffed the pills down my gullet.

Read it many years ago but I guess I didn't pay attention. I've been on some dose of it and different labs (all generic) over the course of 3-4 years. I also took it in mid 20's but only vaguely recall nausea_ dry mouth_ and sweats. Recently increas my dose  from 150-300mg and I feel terrible. So this is why I feel sick all the time? Imagine having the flu EVERY DAY and then toss in weight loss and dehydration. Constantly feel hungry but when foods is in front of me I have a loss of appetite. Oh heap on some paranoia! I'm stopping it completely and just going to be on Prozac. My mother also has Dysthymia and she now uses Prozac. That seemed to work for me when I was in the hospital last month.

I want to stop but my doc is making me wean down.  I did stop taking for three days but the muscle pain was unbearable.  Makes me think the ""medicine"" is addictive.

After over ten years of success on the Mylan Lab generic_ my insurance switched me to the Eon Lab generic to save costs. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck. Allegedly the exact same medication_ but with disastrous results: vivid nightmares_ getting up in the morning felt like I was coming out of a coma_ bloating_ terrible sugar cravings that prompted bingeing. I was on it for four days and my life ground to a halt. Literally couldn't function. I'll pay the additional $20 for the Mylan generic.

However_ I gained 20 lbs while I was taking the generic_ and I had HORRIBLE food and refined carbohydrate cravings the entire time I took this. The generic also made my chest breakout in tons of whiteheads. I've been off the generic for 3 weeks now. The cravings subsided about 72 hours after I stopped it_ and my skin is finally getting back to normal. The cravings were really surprising because I've never had that problem on Glaxo Wellbutrin.

The weight loss/slight lack of appetite was nice but the sweating was unbearable. Before this drug_ I RARELY sweated_ even in hot weather or when working out hard. Now_ walking around in 40 degree weather leaves my sweaty. I'm not heavy_ so weight is not the reason for the sweating. Here's the thing - Ive been 100% OFF this horrible medication for about 10 months and the sweating seems to be permanent_ which is awful! HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS?!?

I experience this gross metal taste off and on_ at random moments_ maybe once or twice a month. Other than that_ please refer to my other comment.,***I am the same person who complained of muscle soreness in my legs while taking Bupropion. I wanted to add that that symptom has gone away_ and my psychiatrist tells me that Bupropion is linked to muscle soreness/tightness in small muscle groups_ such as the jaw/neck_ but not in the larger muscle groups in the legs. So the muscle soreness may not be caused by Bupropion_ and I have consequently changed my rating of this medication from a 3 to a 4.,F,27,2  months,10/29/2009,Bupropion hcl

49, 3, Depression,I just left a rating on the Wellbutrin XL site and gave it a rating of 4. The great effects far outweighed any slight_ rare side effects I experienced. After 2 years of taking Wellbutrin_ I was put on Bupropion about a month ago (the generic version_ same dosage of 150mg)_ and I've experienced jaw tension 1 time_ increased anxiety_ some heart palpitations_ and weird muscle pain in my legs and buttocks for the last five days. (It may have helped me lose a little weight_ and it may have decreased my libido.) I'm not sure how Wellbutrin and Bupropion are different or if my recent problems resulted from the switch to this generic form. I do know that the non-generic form was perfect for me_ and I'd still be on it if my insurance would permit it. Bupropion has helped with my depression the way Wellbutrin did_ but this muscle soreness has freaked me out. I feel like I ran a marathon_ and I've gone from being a super-flexible person to straining to touch my toes and walking around like an eld,I am going to have to reconsider how I will handle my depression. I might stop taking Bupropion_ but I'm a little afraid to.,F,27,1  months,10/13/2009,Bupropion hcl

I just left my comments in the Wellbutrin list because I thought I selected the generic!   I've been feeling so crappy ALLTHETIME.  I want to smack everyone upside the head_ road rage_ binge eating of sweets then salt has resulted in an 8 pound weight gain in 2 months.  I got online to look up what withdrawals I could expect by stopping cold turkey.  Then I found a few sites where many people have noticed a difference between Wellbutrin and Bupropion.

I am more depressed because of the weight gain. And I am as irritable as I was when I wasn't on medication. I can't afford $100 a month for the real Wellbutrin_ and I have insurance!!!
