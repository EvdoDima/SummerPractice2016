0, 5, RLS makes it hard to fall asleep,None. Sometimes I don't stay in bed / sleep as long as recommended so I'm a little out of it for a couple hours when I wake up_ and that's my fault. But that feeling is very mild.,Doc prescribed ambien first. When I told him I had to take two for it to work he prescribed Edluar. Pretty powerful. Echo previous poster: be laying in bed ready to sleep when you take it.  I don't take it every night. I'm not sure that'd be a good idea. Like previous poster_ I have good insurance_ otherwise I wouldn't buy it. I believe it's a couple hundo for 30 before ins. I pay $35.  Thanks_ Obama!,M,40,3  years10 MG 1X D,2/15/2015,Edluar
1, 5, Difficulty falling asleep,None. Taste isn't great but I don't really care...,Edluar is sublingual Zolpidem (Ambien). It works quickly and reliably. Like it a lot. Make sure you are already lying in bed when you take it - it kicks in within 10 minutes. Sometimes I wake up at night because I am lying on my iPad. Please only take it when you are ready to sleep. Great medication but expensive. There is no generic yet. Glad I have good health insurance.,F,42,3  months10mg 1X D,2/29/2012,Edluar
