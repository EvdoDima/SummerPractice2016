0, 1, osteoporosis,black_ tarry stools_ dizziness_ weakness_ hair loss_left hip pain,I was admitted to ER with low hemogloban score of 6 after losing blood through tarry stools.  After endoscopy and colonoscopy they found no cause.  I know that the alendronate was the cause as for weeks I felt terrible_ with dizzy spells _ headaches_ weakness and leg pains_ especially at night. Will never take it again!!   Just hope it leaves my system ASAP.,F,79,3  months70mg 1X W,2/6/2016,Alendronate sodium

2, 1, osteoporosis of spine,I followed doctor's instructions closely.  Took first dose on Dec. 19TH_ before breakfast.  On Dec. 20TH_ very early in the morning about 3:00 am_ I felt pain all over my body.  I could not turn on my sides.  The following morning_ I was completely disabled.  I could not get out of bed without help. My husband helped me sit up by pushing my back up.  Walking was impossible without a cane.  Even with the aid of a cane_ all I could managed was walking in a very small steps_ in a very slow manner.  We knew that I did not suffer a stroke because my voice was not weak.  I could not sit down without help.  My whole body was in pain.  I would never touch FOSAMAX OR ITS GENERIC FORM ever again.My experience was such that I am even scared of trying any kind of osteoporosis medecines.  I will just take calcium with vitamin D everyday_ exercise_ drink plenty of milk_ eat yogurt.,This ALENDRONATE from COBALT is a poison to my body.It is maybe a good thing that I suffered this serious side effect in just one dose.  Some people that I read from the internet mentioned that they had this bad side effect after taking the med for one month and some after one year.,F,65,1  days70 mg 1X W,12/24/2010,Alendronate sodium
