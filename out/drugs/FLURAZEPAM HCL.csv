0, 4, insomnia,I felt tired most of the next day.,I was prescribed 30 mg as required at night 1/2 hour before bed.  The pharmacy only has 15mg capsules in stock so he filled the prescription with twice as many pills and therefore I would take 2 when needed.  This allowed me to experiment and try one 15 mg pill. When I took one 15 mg pill I never slept well and would lay awake from 3am until morning. With the 30 mg dose I sleep like a log_ but feel tired all day long.,M,51,2  weeks,3/20/2007,Flurazepam hcl
