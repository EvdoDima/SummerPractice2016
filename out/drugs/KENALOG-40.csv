0, 4, Ecezema,Fluid in the ear_ back stiffness,I was given Kenalog 10 by dermatologist to treat eczema that developed due to premenopause. It clear my skin but as a bonus cleared my hot flashes. I started going once every 3-4 months but I switched physicians and was given Kenalog but went back 4 months later due to hot flashes and sporadic eczema breakouts but this time she advised not to take Kenalog due possible bad side effects for osteoporosis and Hip dysplasia due to the steroid attacks the hip bone. I agreed not to receive it but now I want it!!! I rather deal with other issues than hot flashes!!! Somebody PLEASE hurry up and find a cure for menopause and it's symptoms.,F,45,1  years40mg 1X AN,7/21/2016Email,Kenalog-40

6, 1, Misdiagnosed with allergies itching,I was given kenlog injection due to itching in which later I find out was scabies. After 2 months of having the shot I noticed a sharp pain in my butt when I looked it was a small dent. I thought maybe I laid on something wrong. After time it got bigger and pain worse.

7, 1, kenalog 10 for foot numbness,"Kenalog 10 ruined my foot. Had bunionectomy year prior_ then strange sporadic numb feeling and hyper-sensitivity in foot underneath. Went to see 2nd physician at same office where 1st surgeon perfomed bunionectomy a year prior. I told him that I felt strange numb feeling that went away when I rode my bike or pressed under the arch of my foot_ and that I couldn't wear heels without pain. I was told that I would be able to wear heels painfree following bunionectomy. I had two screws in my foot though. 2nd doctor had me have CT scan that came back positive as Morton's neuroma_ yet I had no pain in my foot_ just hyper-sensitivity when barefoot outside and when wearing socks with hard plastic bumps/spa socks. I was pressured by the doctor to get corticosteroid injection. I said I didn't want any tissue damage and I knew that steroids cause tissue damage. He said ""there would be no tissue damage""_ I asked if he thought the injection would help so that my foot felt ""normal""",REMOVE THIS AND HELP US SUE!,F,56,1  days10 1X O,5/20/2016Email,Kenalog-40

Told her about the shot and side effects. I use a cup for my periods and it was empty after work and this morning empty. I suggest any women having same side effect to go to a GOOD acupuncture treatment. So far it's only been a day_ wish I could keep you posted but I'd try accupunture instead of more pharmas like birth control to control cycles. Birth control was always a guinea pig routine for me too. This shot is making me turn to more and more natural cures.

ZERO RELIEF W/ ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS.,"I should of said_ No to the shot but I trust my doctor as I've been seen her for years. I'm just wondering if these amazing side effects will go away. It has affected my life via my ability to work and care for my son. I'm calling doctors office as this is now going on the 6th week of all the symptoms I listed.

16, 1, Seasonal allergies,This shot created havoc on my system. I started my period a week early and had continous bleeding on and off for 3 months. The bleeding would vary from bright red to dark and from heavy flow to spotting. I had major hormonal imbalance leading to anxiety_ depression and nervousness. I wasted 6 months of my life trying to figure out what was wrong with me until I came across many websites with people sayig they had similar experience. If you are a woman and experiencing these symptoms_ dont panic. Wait till the shot clears from your system. I made rounds of many obgyns and doctors and went through extreme testings to be told nothing is wrong but also it could not be the shot. But I know it was the shot that caused my menstrual irregularity.

Was healthy until the day I received that horrible injection_ had pain in si joint but now my health has gone downhill fast.

It is has been one year since the injection and I am still feeling ill. Every doctor I saw in an effort to understand what was happening to me said_ ""Oh it could not possibly be the Kenalog"" even though I presented them with the adverse reaction report which makes false claims_ along with the false claims on Bristol Meyers web site_ that the potential for adrenal suppression can happen but only for 30 days. The FDA then made them change that language to a few months which they did not do on their web site. It turned out I was  suffering from a total shut down of my adrenals or HPA access meaning I had ""temporary adrenal insufficiency"" for over 6 months technically but I can tell you that I still feel sick. I felt like I had the flu_ was unable to men",Bristol Meyers and the FDA have underplayed the risks of this medication and I agree there should be a class action lawsuit here.

This has eliminated the need for regular use of nasal corticosteroid Tx with minimal - actually no - side effects to speak of.,M,33,1  days1cc (40mg),5/5/2015,Kenalog-40

59, 1, Eye injection for Iritis,On 7/3/13_ I let them put an injection of Kenalog in my eye for iritis_ a decision that I'll forever regret!   Since than I have had ongoing eye pressure issues and been diagnosed with glaucoma.  Before this injection my eye pressures were never an issue_ even with steroid drops.  I was put on every coarse of anti-glaucoma drops and even got started on Diamox pills_ which gave me major anxiety and depression.  I eventually had a tube shunt surgery done on the affected eye_ which ultimately failed after 8 months and had to have an additional surgery to take the tube out.  Both of these surgeries and healing times have taken a major toll on me personally and financially. Last year alone I had 52 eye doctor appointments.....and I'm 31 years old.  Now I'm left with an eye with high eye pressure_ half a shunt tube device in my eye (because it was scarred in too much to remove the whole device)_ I'm back on eye drops_ and oral pills.   If this had been a natural process to my eye than I would have no problem coping and dealing with this the rest of my life.  It's the fact that I put my eye in the hands of medical professionals and ever since that day they decided and I let them put a Kenalog injection in my eye_ my eyes health and personal life has taken a downward spiral.,Should not be allowed to be injected into someone's eye for any reason because the side effects out way the benefits greatly.,M,31,1  days,3/18/2015Email,Kenalog-40

Don't know what to do and can't get an appt at my doctors for 2 weeks!! I did go a couple of weeks ago and was told by the doctor that it was very very unlikely that any of symptoms could be caused by Kenalog. This seems to be an all too familiar response from what I've seen on here. It is clear that the doctors are completely wrong. I am furious as I was not told about any of the side effects (or even the name of the drug I was being injected with) until after the injection had been done and they handed me a leaflet about Kenalog. I feel like I have been damaged in some way as I have had absolutely no pain relief whatsoever - in fact quite the opposite!!

Spent 4.5 hours in ER with tests all around heart issues.  My heart was FINE.  It was the Kenalog and when I told the doctor that he wrote me off.  I called my own doctor who had given me the shot and spoke with his assistant who also wrote me off and said to see my PCP because collapsing was not caused by Kenalog.  I beg to differ.

In fact_ many premier textbooks allocate only a couple of pages to exploring glucocorticoid mechanism of action and then only briefly mention potential side effects. This lack of understanding has led many practitioners to naïvely view steroids as benign drugs without fully comprehending the broad scope of potential side effects that can occur when steroids are injected into the epidural space . . . To understand the full scope of complications that can arise from epidural administration of glucocorticoids_ it is necessary not only to understand the technical/mechanical complications that occur with needle placement_ but also to grasp the role of pharmacokinetics_ steroid particulate size_ and_ most importantly_ how glucocorticoids affect every organ system.,F,44,6  weeks200 4X O,8/7/2012,Kenalog-40

Apparently_ saline infiltration which is easy to do_ works to fix the indentation (but good luck finding a doctor who has heard of this); you should be able to find the abstract for the article online and the paper at a medical school library. A good dermatologist should know about this technique or be willing to investigate it for you.

151, 4, asthma related breathing problems,Heavy vaginal bleeding; severe muscle cramps in my calves in both legs; itchy_ red rash that doctor says is eczema (yeah right); fatigue; burning_ itching in body; dizziness; blood sugar levels affected,I received a shot of kenalog for asthma related breathing problems and was told that I had a wet sound in my lungs.  I was having extreme amounts of wheezing_ breathing problems_ and counghing fits.  The Kenalog injection my doctor gave did help with these problems.  Normally_ this would have been greatly appreciated.  Of course_ I began to experience light bleeding and spotted with my monthly period then stopped.  Several days later I began to have heavy vaginal bleeding.  This has continued.  My calves have both began having severe muscle cramps.  I have an itchy_ red rash on my elbows_ around my ankles_ and on one knee cap.  The doctor that gave the shot said that I have eczema (yeah_ right) and prescribed a cream for me. He gave me a sample of this cream to use for two days so the cost would not be so great.  I was to use the steroid cream for two weeks only.  I found out this is also the trima.... whatever the spelling is that is a steroid so this continues the bleeding and things because even once the kenalog leaves my body_ there will still be some steroid from the rash in my system.  I was told by the ob/gyn office not to be greatly worried that kenalog does this_ but they are seeing me in their office to err on the side of caution.  I have had bouts of dizziness and fatigue.

Heart problems_ including stroke and heart failure_ could result_ depending on the dosage. Heart irregularity and steroids are the focus of a significant new study.High doses of corticosteroids_ such as prednisone_ often are used to bring down inflammation quickly in people with arthritis_ asthma or allergies. A 2006 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine indicates they also may bring on changes in heartbeat. The study showed taking corticosteroids_ such as prednisone_ increased the likelihood of developing new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF)  the most common type of irregular heartbeat.Irregular beating means blood is not being pumped efficiently_ causing heart palpitations or flutters_ fatigue_ shortness of breath or difficulty exercising_ as well as possibly causing blood to pool_ clot and lead to a stroke or heart failure. AF increases the risk of stroke fivefold  a concern for those with inflammatory forms of arthritis_ who already have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease_ including stroke_ heart attack and heart failure.In the study_ researchers followed 7_983 adults who were part of the Rotterdam study in the Netherlands for 10 years.

The whole episode with the urination_ weakness_ cramping_ etc. lasted a few days and I thought it was behind me_ then here I am six weeks later and it's started all over again.

I havent experienced any of the side effects described by some others_ and I  wonder if they maybe have other reasons for what they are experiencing?

There seems to be a complete difference in the effect of the drug between patients with Allergies and those with other problems - the allergy sufferers don't appear to have side effects. Maybe that is something to be noted by medics. Here in the UK it is very_ very difficult to get the injection for hayfever_ and you really have to have an extremely understanding GP who will log it as a shot in the shoulder. Anyone who hasn't suffered the debilitating state that continual bouts of violent sneezing - up to 25-30 in one go_ that leaves you totally exhausted_ and the sleepless nights with itching eyes and throat that leave you incapable of thinking straight and working_ can't possibly understand the totally amazing feeling of being normal again.

185, 5, Severe Seasonal Allergies,No side effects at all. Not even the indention in my butt cheek that many peeps report.  I take a rather large dose blended with lidocaine.,Frankly I'm kinda surprised by all the comments where people say this is an evil poison that should be outlawed.  It makes me wonder if their side effects were caused by something other than the kenalog 40. After a lifetime of crippling seasonal allergies_ a country doctor in west texas introduced me to kenelog40. I've been taking a yearly rump injection of it for 6 or 7 yrs now and it has literally given me my life back. I have no side effects_ no rump indention_ no weight gain or loss_ no pain or other issues related to its use. I spent years having to medicate myself with OTC meds or prescription meds. I had to drug myself up until nearly zombie-like to get allergy relief and breathe freely prior to using kenalog40. It is a lifesaver and a blessing. One shot every year in April and my allergies are a thing of the past. I recommend it to peeps all the time who have severe allergies. Those that were able to talk their Dr into trying it on them have also had success. It's a miracle drug and I will use it for the rest of my life.,M,45,7  years 1X O,4/20/2011Email,Kenalog-40

188, 5, severe swelling in throat/infection,headache,The first time I was given Kenalog was in an Urgent Care due to severe swelling on left side of the back of mouth/throat. The injection calmed the excruciating swelling within 8 hours. I recently had the same infection (only on left side/rear of mouth/throat area. The inflammation was so severe the sides of my throat were touching my uvula. The first Dr. I saw refused the shot; so I went elsewhere where I was given the injection. I had a bad headache the night of the injection_ but woke the next day to find the swelling reduced considerably more than halfway_ and the pain gone. I also have severe allergies; and it helped me there too. My theory is steroids are intended to reduce inflammation; I really do not think it matters where the inflammation is. It has worked twice wonderfully for me for inflammation from a throat infection-so why was that Dr. refusing to give it to me? It worked and now I feel much better.,F,38,2  times1 1X AN,4/6/2011Email,Kenalog-40

This continued for over six months. I went to my obgyn_ I had cat scans and mri's of my head and everything came back normal. I had also had a Dysport (like botox)procedure around the same time and I thought that's what all the symptoms were from. I had another two shots  over two week period in January 2011 and immediately gained back the ten pounds I had lost over the fall. I finally realized it must be the injections. I am back to feeling all the horrrible side effects again.  I feel so ignorant for never asking what was actually being injected into my neck.  I have always been in great shape and now I am embarressed to see people because I look so bloated_ which just adds to the depression.  I try to stay upbeat and work out but it is so difficult.

This has changed my life! My allergies have completely disappeared and I have my life back. I can sleep_ exercise_ socialize and do all of the things that those pesky allergies were preventing me from doing. This drug certainly does agree with me and I have had no negative side effects whatsoever. Maybe its because I dont take any other medications_ I dont know.

205, 3, SEVERE ALLERGY,I like the fact that Kenalog took my allergies away but I can do without the dent in my buttock_ not to mention it hurts sometime. I did talk to the nurse and she said apply a hot rag as hot as you can take it or take hot baths and it will fill back in but it takes 3 months or so. I did find that the hot towels made it feel better so now I'm watching to see if it will grow back. She seemed to be confident and let me know that she had one as well. I read somewhere that what happens is the medicine will crystallize an start to burn the fat away. So it does make sense to try and dissolve them with the hot water (not a heating pad). The crystals need heat and steam that will penetrate under the skin. Hopefully this helps cause I'm also a victim.

I was hesitant because I have anxiety/panic attacks but I can tolerate oral steroids fairly well and was desperate.  The shot worked wonders and got me through cotton harvest season in the far east valley here in Phoenix.  I just got another one 48 hours ago because I'd been trying to ""ignore"" my allergies this fall and ended up with a sinus infection and hoarseness from drainage issues related to my nasal allergies.   Literally within 3 hours of the Kenalog shot my nose opened up and stopped running for the first time in over a month.  The little bit of tightness/wheeziness in my chest (which had been triggering recurrent panic attacks for a month) and red/itchy/runny eyes stopped too.  I know some people don't tolerate some drugs-I am one of the 3% of people who cannot tolerate Metformin.  But on sites like this_ people are more likely to leave a review when they have a negative experience and I'd hate to see someone discount Kenalog without talking to a doctor and weighing the pros and cons.

I am not 100% back to normal but may never be due to the car accident 7 months ago.

219, 5, muscle pain,Really no side effects for me.  My wife has had some agitation from 2 injections of Kenalog.,Some of the side effects reported here are fairly predictable and others I question the causal relationship.  The drug typically doesn't last more than several months to six months at the most.  Fat atrophy is very common when the injection is given in the subcutaneous area.  The drug needs to be injected intramuscularly - not in the fat in your buttocks.  This is a big problem for women who carry more fat there than men and therefore women can have more problems with this side effect.  The other thing to consider is diluting the medication with marcaine or other injectable anesthetics - at a lower concentration you may be at less risk for fat atrophy.  For me_ the medication has been a miracle drug.  I have had a number of trigger points injected and it has cured me of terrible pain.,M,50,10  times10 to 40mg 1X AN,10/21/2010,Kenalog-40

I was in so much pain I could not walk AT ALL. I took 3 advil and called the doctors office (prompters etc.) and finally spoke to a nurse who told me to elevate my leg above my heart.  The pain level was at a 10.  It felt like I tore something.  I could not move the leg at all and was crying _ asking what happened.  They called in pain meds (Vicodin ) which I refused to take because it was too strong. I had to wait for the advil to work a little so that I could use crutches to get to a bed. I was in excruciation pain all night.  I took darvoct and advil_ kept my leg elevated with ice on it.  The next day the pain had subsided quite a bit and I was able to walk on it without crutches. Later that day my face started to turn red and on the third day my face and neck were beet red.,,F,58,3  days40 mg 1X AN,9/24/2010,Kenalog-40

230, 3, Herniated Disc Lower Back,Heart Irregularities--heart skipping beats_ fast pulse; flushing and hot flashes; increased sweating; more 'fuzz' than usual on cheeks,On 7/14/2010 I was given the first shots (in muscles on right side of lower back) by my pain doctor who said there would be really 'no side effects'--to be fair_ I did not challenge this.  The pain relief on right side was actually amazing. It took away my pain for first time in 3 years. However_ I noticed that since right side had no pain_ how much pain was still in left side. So went back for a second set of shots 8/11/2010 on BOTH sides of lower back. For first week was great_ but as soon as activity started up again (tried other activities instead of running)_ the pain crept back in. I also thought I was having heart issues because I felt this 'flip-flop' in my chest multiple times a day. I kept checking my pulse and finally realized my heart was skipping a beat. Went to urgent care and they said EKG was fine. Didn't realize until doing more research online that heart irregularities could be a side effect. Also_ I kept getting so hot! I was having hot flashes/flushing/sweating and wasn't sure what it was about considering I am only 35. Again_ found out this could also be a side effect. Not sure if I am going to get any future Kenalog shots. The initial pain relief was fantastic_ but the side effects and the short length of keeping pain away may not be worth it. I hope these side effects go away soon. Good luck to everyone.,F,35,2  monthsUnk 1X M,8/26/2010,Kenalog-40

246, 1, Debilitating Allergies,I have taken Kenalog injections each Spring since I was a teenager for severe allergies.  I have always had menstrual disruption - from missing periods to additional periods and heavy bleeding.  I too have experienced the 'Kenalog Dent' in my buttocks but am happy to say in time the dent does return to normal (took mine about two years to do so.)I suffer from chronic daily headache with migraine which has been my 'cross to bear' for most of my life.  I have never until this Spring had my Kenalog shot affect my migraines_ but since this 2010 injection_ I will NEVER again get a Kenalog shot.  For the first 10 to 15 days after the shot I was feeling great relief from my allergy symptoms_ but noticed my migraines increasing in intensity and duration.  Three weeks after the shot I was having DAILY MIGRAINES and when not in the throws of a migraine I have been having tension-type gripping pain 24/7.  I am a fit_ active_ healthy 51 year-old woman who normally leads a normal_ happy lif,As I write this entry on 5/21/2010 I have just had a sudden-onset migraine in the night that I thought may send me to the E.R.  I take Treximet and Maxalt (alternating the two) for my 'normal' migraines and am quickly exhausting my supply of both.  I am miserable - far more so than any allergic symptoms could cause.  In my own pain_ I would caution ANYONE who suffers from MIGRAINE to NOT receive a Kenalog Injection.  The risk of increased migraines is not worth any amount of relief the shot may offer.God bless all of you who are searching for answers - I hope my first ever 'blog entry' helps someone.,F,51,30  yearsInjection 1X AN,5/21/2010,Kenalog-40

Oh_ and lets not forget to mention that I've had a staph infection for nearly 3 years now. Its on again off again but it can't be good for my immune system or quality of life in general to be on different antibiotics or steroids every few months.,I can't honestly say if my side effects are from the Kenalog shot itself or from my antibiotics....or if I'm just dying from continued illness caused by stress along with the seasonal allergies I was born with.

265, 1, allergies,Menstrual irregularities_ acid reflux_ continued allergy symptoms_ headache,I got a shot 2 years ago (Jan 2008) hoping for allergy relief. My doctor said he gives them to his mother in law every 5-6 months. I had my period for almost 3 months. Eventually felt better but it didn't help my allergies. January 3_ 2010 my 8 year old daughter and I both received the shot for allergic reaction to bug bites_ not being told what it was exactly. I was okay at first_ but then I got my period for 8 days instead of the usual 4 a month later_ it stopped and started again 5 days later and I'm still bleeding. Also I have experienced over the past two weeks what appears to be all the symptoms of acid reflux. The symptoms change up but I have a weird taste in my mouth_ burning sensation in my chest and abdominal region_ some pain_ bloating AND my allergies are acting up. My doctor denies its the drug and doesnt remember me going to my OB GYN 2 years ago with her saying its a rare but it IS a side effect to have your menstrual cycle screwed up. My doctor was more concerned about my eyes being red (from allergies) in spite of the shot? I am scheduled for a physical on March 1st and he recommended over the counter Acid Reflux meds. Its hard to tell if the varied symptoms I have are from my ever flowing period_ acid reflux or whatever_ but I never had any of these issues and never had problems with my period except after the two isolated times two years apart of receiving this shot.,F,43,1  daysnot sure 2X O,2/20/2010,Kenalog-40
266, 1, sinus infection,One week after my shot my mentrual cycle became all messed up. I bleed one week_and off one week_ and bleed the next this has gone on for two months and I was regular  my period was 30 days apart. I do not EVER want this again. The worst part was we were ttc and we can't now because I am not ovulating.,,F,29,1  times,1/30/2010,Kenalog-40

268, 1, spasm in neck and thoracic spine,A flare of severe nerve pain and spasm that lasted more than a week.  Flushing and burning on my face and chest_ followed by a strange rash.  Heart palpitations.  Insomnia. A white coating on my tongue_ probably thrush.  I am worried about additional  or continuing symptoms_ as it's only been two weeks since the shot; and the damned stuff stays in your system a long time. I still get some facial flushing and burning after taking a hot shower.,The doctor injected me with Kenalog without telling me he planned to do so first.  I would not have let him do it if he'd asked me.  Part of the the problem in my spine is weakness and atrophy following a spine surgery that resulted in post-laminectomy kyphosis.  Obviously_ these problems will be exacerbated by introducing a drug that is known to cause atrophy and osteoporosis.I have always had these reactions.  The first time I had Kenalog was an injection in my foot for a nerve impingement.  The foot atrophied and withered; the nerve pain flared to my kneeand never stopped until I had surgery more than a year later.  All the capillaries in that area became visible; my physical therapist feared the shot had started a regional pain syndrome.I have had these injections a number of times_ always with the same side effects_ and NEVER with any improvement.  The docs have always denied that the shot could have caused the reaction.,M,64, ,1/2/2010,Kenalog-40
269, 3, Lumbar stenosis,Hot flashes_ palpitations_ rapid weight gain_ post menopausal bleeding_ abdominal cramps_ indigestion_ sleeplessness_ severe migraine headaches_ elevated blood pressure,I had my first injection 10/8 and noticed mild migraine headaches_ slight increase in blood pressure and some sleeplessness.  I had the second injection Nov. 30th.  No one mentioned any side effects or problems to anticipate. This time_ my blood pressure shot up.  Had problems sleeping_ gained about 7 pounds in the first two weeks.  After not having periods for 6 years_ stared out with cramping and have been bleeding bright blood for 4 days.  Am to start hormones and an ultrasound is scheduled in 2 weeks to rule out tumor.  If the Kenalog has caused an overgrowth of the uterine wall_ I'll have to have a D&C.  Do the orthopedic doctors and the FDA know what is going on?  My gynocologist had never heard of this.  However_ any bleeding at my age has to be investigated...and it can be painful.  My back pain has been replaced by migraines_  cramps_ bloating and discomfort.,F,59,2  times,12/21/2009,Kenalog-40
270, 3, Post Sinus Surgery Inflamation,I received my first injection postoperatively but prior to waking up from anesthesia when I had my sinuses operated on. The only symptom I noticed at first that I would not have attributed directly to just having had surgery was an insatiable appetite.,At my one week follow-up appointment I was in severe pain the pressure had increased and I should've been feeling a little better.  The Dr looked and said I was swelling again.  He said I needed more steroids and I would feel better. I asked the nurse after the shot what I was it was. She said Kenalog but no more. I went home_ within 24 hours started to feel normal again but had difficulty sleeping. My menstral cycle was to start on the 18th of the month_ it started on the 20th which was a little strange because I can set a clock to my cycle it is very predictable. I braced myself for the hell that I experience while on my period (severe pain_ horrible clotting_ bleeding to the point I feel I am hemmorhaging). Usually the worst of it starts 8 to 12 hours after my cycle begins and generally last for 2 to 3 of my 5 day cycle. I can always count on these horrible occurences and have been told I need a hysterectomy to fix them. It has been six days today since I started. The first 4 days where great for me_ I had mild bloating and mild cramping and very (almost inexistent) mild bleeding. Towards the end of the 4th day I am normally back to the mild bleeding instead_ I started bleeding more heavily. It seems like my menstration is increasing as the days go on instead of going away. It is still not as bad as normal but I am starting to wonder if it is ever going to go away after reading some of the posts here. Also have high blood pressure_ sugar_ and frequent urination,F,31,2  times,11/25/2009,Kenalog-40
271, 1, shoulder pain,Abnormal uterine bleeding,I was told there were no side effects excpet for possible skin discoloring.  Hah!  A week after the injection I started bleeding as though I had my period but I knew it wasn't.  That was almost three weeks ago and it's been pretty constant_ with a few days of no bleeding and many days of just some brown discharge.  I would NEVER get this injection again.  It didn't work to help ease pain on my shoulder and I never would have gotten it if my orthopedist had mentioned this possible side effect - but of course he said nothing!,F,45,1  times,11/15/2009,Kenalog-40

Other symptoms include severe lethargy_exhaustion_depression(lack of motivation to do anything),"Are they waiting until someone commits suicide on this drug before they take it of the market!I DO NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I received only one injection On Aug 29th and cannot escape these awful life altering symptoms. I was never told of side effects although I questioned my Dr. Until that injection I did not have a period for 10 years and have been on HRT for 5 years. I started bleeding after the Kenalog injection. That is not a coincidence!I had a ""Type A Personality"" before that injection and now I can barely get out of bed in the morning.I have since had every possible exam_ x-ray_ CT_ and complete bloodwork testing for just about everything with perfect reports. The only explanation was that I must have a hyper-sensitivity to kenalog. Obviously_I am not alone. I'm going to support any class action suit out there. This drug is dangerous!",F,56, ,10/24/2009Email,Kenalog-40

276, 3, Severe Allergies,I had the shot about 3 months ago for a severe seasonal allergy attack that Allegra couldn't help with_ and noticed some side effects such as anxiety_ feeling spacey_ touchy and slight depression. I didn't realize until I just had to get another shot that the side effects increase the second time around_ with severe anxiety_ depression_ exhaustion_ feeling light headed_ tingly in hands and arms_ and a huge appetite. I suppose i'd still take this over the misery of severe allergies_ although i wish there was an easier option!,The shot is a saving grace from a severe allergy attack if you know how bad and debilitating they can be_ hence why I opted for a second shot only 3 months later. I do however doubt I will get another one considering the higher level of side effects im feeling the second time around_ as well as the long term side effect possibilities. I would move to another climate first before I chose to feel this edgy!,M,27,3  months,8/28/2009,Kenalog-40
277, 5, severe allergies and hay fever,No side affects.,We operate a 14_000 acre farm and grow many types of crops plus live in the intermountain west where there are numerous varieties of weeds. I have suffered from childhood with hay fever and am allergic to pet dander_ mold and numerous other pollens.  But this past spring we had more rain than usual and life with these symptoms was more miserable than at any time in the 50 years of my life. All the allergy pills I was taking just were not affective. I took my first Kenilog 40 shot in April 09 and second one in first part of August. It has changed my daily living. I can be around grain harvest_ pollen from cottonwood trees_ dusty farm house plus go out in the fields again without even a sneeze. It is a miracle drug as far as I am concerned. My husband and sons are amazed at the change in my temperment because I sleep better and just plain feel better. I would even put up with a few side affects to get this kind of relief. The doc recommended I take one and try to go 6 months before having another. I made it 5 and he does not believe I will need another since winter will be upon us when 5 more months has past. I am smiling right now just thinking of all the things I can go out and do because of Kenilog 40. IT WAS WELL WORTH THE $80 and I highly recommend it but suggest you have a doctor talk to you first about frequency and possible side affects. Cheryl in  Idaho,F,53,5  months,8/25/2009,Kenalog-40

Hopefully_ this will work. It's been very frustrating.",I needed help with the poison ivy_ it went all through my body_ and didn't even know where or how I got it other than it was airborn. I received my first dose of kenalog along with Medroyl_ and had no relief at all_ I was still itching all over_ so I went back to my dr. and he doubled the dose of each injection_ so in all_ I received 120mg of each drug_ after the 2nd injection_ I did finally get some relief from the poison ivy_ then the other side effects started_ my dr. didn't tell me about any of the side effects before giving me the injections.

281, 5, contact dermatitis,I recieved an injection every 4 - 6 weeks for 15 years.  One year I had an injection every two weeks for a total of 24 in one year.  I probably had alot of side effects_ but I think some people sit around and try to come up with them.  I don't think that I would have even put it together with the injection. Yes_ my periods were and are irregular - but better than the itching and bleeding and cracked skin on my hands. Some people just have too much time to sit and think.  After 15 years my doctor told me he could not give them to me except for 1 or 2 a year.  I since have found a new doctor and he will give them to me when I need them.  I only need one now about every 3-4 months.,The one side effect that I know of is that my pressure in my eyes is very high.,F,47,20  years,7/28/2009,Kenalog-40

284, 1, bulging discs at L4 and L5,rapid weight gain_ depression_ acid reflux_ fatique_ hair growth_ menstruation stopped_ swelling of the body especially the face,"9 years ago - Had 3 apointments for injections_ each one 1 month apart. The injections were done on each side of my spine for a total of 8 ""pokes"" on each appointment. I was never told I was getting a steriod or that there were side effects. The first side effects were swelling of my face and lots of extra ""peach fuss"" on my face and back. Then came the fatigue and depression. I asked the neurologist and he said it was normal and put me on antidepressants. I was gaining weight so rapidly that my skin literal stretched overnight. I still have 1 inch wide stretch marks that cover my hips_ thighs and even my calf. I gained 70lbs in one year. I saw another doctor who freaked out when he saw me and my records and said I had a bad reaction and that the injections should not have been continued. I had major acid reflux and was put on meds for that. My period stopped for a solid year. I feel this drug has caused permanent issues. I've tried to get off antidepressants a few times and have been unsuccessful b/c of THOSE side effects. If I had never had the injections I don't think I'd have ever been ""hooked"" on antidepressants. I've also suffered from constant fatigue for 9 years. It may be related to the extra weight I never got rid of_ but I don't know for sure. Please ask questions and understand this drug and how much you are being given.

It did help a bit with inflamation of my nose_ sinus_ ears_ chest_ throught but prednisone works way better and is shorter.,I wouldnt recommend it. Also my joint ache in the hip where I had the shot.

This time I began irregular periods.  My period is very normal 35 day cycle. Received shot around May 7 and then my period was late_ but once it came it was not normal and lasted 10 days.  I have had steady cramps the entire time.  Then got it again_ this time it came halfway through my cycle and I knew something was wrong so got a pap smear_ exam_ and pregnancy test_ but nothing was wrong.  I suspect it is this shot.  I posted previously on this website indicating no side affects_ but now I have one.  Not sure if I'll take this again_ depends on how long this lasts.,F,33,5  times,6/23/2009,Kenalog-40
289, 5, Fungal Sinusitis,Moderate itching,Began taking Kenalog 40 2-years ago in lieu of nasal surgery for fungal sinusitis. It was my last resort. It worked immediately and the shots last about 4+ months before I go back for another - trying to stretch them out to 6+ months if I can. No real side effects to speak of other than sporadic itching which I tolerate_ but it surely improves my nasal congestion and life. My only concern is my Internal Med. Dr. does not recommend this shot more than a couple of times as he says it can make bones more brittle. MY ENT says with proper intervals of the shot_ he has never had any such side effects. So far_ I'm following my ENT's advice as without the shot I'm miserable and I don't want to undergo surgery as I don't believe it will be that helpful.,M,59,2  years,6/12/2009,Kenalog-40

They sent me for a pelvic sonogram and blood tests and all came out fine. they sent me to my Gyno. and he did different labs for various hormones and all came back fine. I am not going to let them keep treating me like a guinea pig after I saw this web site. I just want to know how much time Im going to be bleeding because Im sick of it already. I guess that side affects are more on women because we ovulate.  This medication should be examined by the labs and investigated.  If there is an alternative medication please use it.

299, 4, Subdermal scar tissue around chin,"Following an accident I had a lot of excessive scar tissue for years that changed the shape of my face by leaving a lot of scarring around my chin and ""hiding"" my chin and squaring my face more or less. I had previously had a kenalog injection in the scar under my chin which was hypertrophic and it was a huge worry. It took two years for a discoloration and dimple to fill in. That said_ it is not a perfect drug and I do tend to feel sick a day or two after the shots even if they are sub-dermal. I also must say that the use is off-label as kenalog 40 is considered too strong for subdermal use with a high risk of subcutaneous atrophy (under skin atrophy of fat or dimpling as described above). That said my scar has been very resistant and though I have experienced some dimpling it has tended to fill in quick and the treatment is ongoing and frankly better than nothing. Short of this opening me up and trying to scrape out scar tissue is the only option and not very effective",People tend to overreact to the negatives.

Once I was able_ and after no docters would listen_ I've found that many other people have had side effects and that they are listed on FDA warnings. I seriously thought that it would never go away.

EXTENDED menstrual periods and abdominal pain!,BEWARE!!I received TOTAL of 3 Kenalog shots through butt (1 shot every 4 months).  On the third shot_ Nov 2008_ my period lasted 10 days with heavy clotting.  I couldn't wear a tampon due to the extreme loss of clots through vaginal area.  Had my period December 20th and still  bleeding with excessive blood clotting and abdominal pain.  WORST MISTAKE I made was allowing my doctor to administer w/o providing side effects.Resorted to take 3 birthcontrol pills daily to control my period and still bleeding.  Will have to undergo a microscopic vaginal procedure in few weeks as a PAP did not reveal issues_ nor did the internal and external ultra sounds I had to undergo.  My advise is DO NOT TAKE Kenalog.  My first shot was Feb 2008 and it took almost 1 year for these issues to appear.,F,32,1  years,2/7/2009Email,Kenalog-40
312, 3, torn meniscus in R knee,Poor sleep and some headache first night after.  Then fatigue started to increase three days after_ slept 12 hours last night.  Anxiety increasing_ easily upset_ and worry-worry all the time.  Had two previous shots that also had this effect about 5 days after being given the shot and this fatigue and anxiety lasted about 1 or two weeks_ gradually disappeared after that time.  I had this shot because I hurts so_ and so tired of hurting for six weeks now.,was told the side effect was infection about 1 in 20_000_ nothing else.,F,66, ,2/5/2009,Kenalog-40
313, 5, allergy induced chronic rhinitis,I have no side effects.,I have been suffering from allergy induced chronic rhinitis my whole life.  Usually at one point in the Spring it gets so bad_ I feel like I have mono and the fatigue puts me in bed and not able to function.  The migraines kick in and I am done for.  The only thing that helps me kick this terrible sinus infection is a Kenalog shot.  I have been getting them once a year for 4 years and they are a miracle.  I only get one when I get this bad though to make sure they work when I need them.  Within 24 hours I feel 80% better.,F,33,4  years,2/3/2009,Kenalog-40

316, 3, chronic sinusitis/allergies,increased appetite for a week after shot (Thanksgiving week of all weeks!)_ some menstrual spotting,It has been 2 months since my shot.  The allergist who recommended it made it clear that there could be a divot at the injection site that should only last 6 months_ and that menstrual side effects were very possible.  The nurse who administered the shot reiterated these points and asked again for my consent.  At the time I was so miserable with allergies and chronic sinus issues_ I nearly would've promised my first-born as well if they asked.My allergies flared up again only 4 days after the shot_ but my sinus infection cleared up_ in combination with Bactrim antibiotics for 3 weeks.  I have experienced some annoying menstrual spotting for a couple of weeks before each period_ which has run a normal course for me.  I do not yet have a dent at the injection site.However_ after reading all the reviews_ I would probably not be so quick to agree to the shot next time_ as I understand the side effects can be much worse.,F,33,1  times,1/5/2009Email,Kenalog-40
317, 4, asthma,increased appetite had to beaware what I was eating not just eating because I felt like it. More energy able to breath much better.,I do not like taking any medications but I was miserable_ coughing_ wheezing not resting_ unable to work  and this medication gave me a boost back to my normal daily activities. Have had shots in the past as needed with same results. Have never taken over extended period of time. Occasionally pill form for 7-10 days. I believe if not for the medication I would have been hospitalized.,F,50,1  days,12/5/2008Email,Kenalog-40

As a child_ I recall being house bound watching_ through our house window_ my siblings play slip and slide on our front lawn.  My allergies were year round and I resorted to Kenalog after battling with running nose_ itchy and swollen eyes_ loss of taste_ itchy mouth and throat and ear drainage from allergies.  I obtain Kenalog injections once every four months and it has been a heaven sent!,F,32,2  years,11/30/2008Email,Kenalog-40

Menstrual cycle problems for two months.",Was not told about ANY side effects of this drug.  Commented to the physician that I was losing sleep over past couple of months because I could not breathe well at night and was not getting relief from nasal sprays or Claritin-D.  Physician just ordered the shot.  I had NO idea that it was a steroid because she didn't tell me ANYTHING at all about the drug - just had the nurse administer the injection.

I recieved the Kenalog 40 injection without being advised on any potential side effects.  Within 36 hours I started having severe anxiety attacks with spikes in my blood pressure and vision problems (spotty_ increased sensitivity to light).  These attacks continued for 4-8 weeks during which time I underwent an MRI (head)_ stress test_ and blood work to make sure nothing else was causing my symptoms.....conclusion:  everything normal.  My doctor prescribed me Xanax to help with the out of control anxiety.  Started feeling more normal 60-90 days later.  I started trying to run on my treadmill to get back in shape at the 90 day mark_ and once again....symptoms returned.  It's been a couple of weeks and I'm getting closer to being back to ""normal""_ but I have no idea how long it will be before the Kenalog has completely metabolized out of my system_ and I can get on with li",M,34,1  times,11/2/2008Email,Kenalog-40

I have went through so many advil and tampons it's scary. It didn't even occur to me until tonight that the kenalog shot 80 mg. was causing this. I'm 46 so I thought it was a symtom of perimenopause.It has made me feel so weak and depressed probally due to so much blood loss and pain from cramps.

325, 5, allergies,NONE- I have been taking a Kenalog injection for 7 years. I have had allergies since I was a child_ and was miserable from March to September. At 46 my doctor suggested I try Kenalog because I had to take prescription medication to get thru the day and was still miserable. It has been my salvation_ and I will take it until a cure is found.,,F,54,7  years,9/4/2008,Kenalog-40

I've had maybe 7 days of no bleeding since early July.  My period have always been reasonably regular_ and my doctor agrees that it's the steroids and that it may be 3-5 months before things go back to normal.  My anxiety is also much higher than usual.

Also_ my heart beat become so erratic_ I had to have anesthesia for a procedure to check for heart problems. Still having problems after 15 months. I have had repeated anxiety attacks. I was never told anything about the possibility of such side effects. It took me some time to figure it all out and visits to a dermatologist_ a lung specialist who referred me to a heart specialist who felt I needed a diagnostic procedure_and an OB/Gyn. I would not recommend this drug to ANYONE! My life will never be the same and I wonder if I will ever have a day when I feel good and healthy again. I was athletic_ active_and happy before Kenalog.,F,30,1  times,8/6/2008,Kenalog-40
329, 5, Seasonal Allergies/Bronchitas,Severe sweating the first day after I get the shot.,I have been receiving this shot for almost 5 years at least twice a year.  If it weren't for this particular medication_ I would suffer badly with breathing through my nose.  The membranes in my nose swell very badly;therefore the reason why I request this shot so often.  Now that I am 44 years old_ I get this shot 3-times a year.  The only bad side affect is the sweating I do the first day of the shot.  My heart races as well because this is a steroid. I recommend this shot to anyone who suffers with allergies and have a hard time breathing during this time.,F,44,5  years,8/1/2008,Kenalog-40
330, 4, Allergies/Infection,Flushing_ severe and debilitating muscle and joint pain_ increased blood pressure_ headache_ increased appetite_ insomnia,I suffer from severe inflammation as my body over-reacts to allergens_ infections_ and other stimuli.  Although I experience severe pain after the injections_ this is the only medication that has proven effective at reducing the inflammation in my body.  I've taken these injections for several years and after the pain is gone (usually 24-28 hours) I feel much better.  My doctor switched injection sites from butt to arm after news started circulating about atrophy_ but I have not had that problem.  I am prepared for the pain and will continue to take the shots since they have helped me tremendously.,F,45,6  years,7/1/2008,Kenalog-40

334, 5, Severe allergies,None,The relief from the seasonal ragweed is so fantastic_ I wish it could be that good all year.  It does only last for about 6 weeks and the Doctors are reluctant to give more than one shot_ although I can have a second shot if I feel I need it.  I get a shot the first or second week of August evey year and it last until mid to late September.  It may not be for everyone_ but it has sure been a life saver for a chronic ragweed sufferer.,M,54,18  times,6/2/2008,Kenalog-40

I still need to take the additional allergy medications which I had to take before. I still don't dare open the door until a half hour after taking the meds._ but the symptoms are much better this year.  In addition to the Kenalog shot I started an online free Tools for Life program that deals with depression.  I was taking anti depression medicine (Prozac) at the time. I am no longer on antidepression medicine. I have not had any more suicidal thoughts.  I change the program to include self talk that aligns with my own beliefs.  This includes being thankful for all the medication including the Kenalog.,F,54,2  months,5/31/2008Email,Kenalog-40

To date_ pain level has not diminished_ so I am apparently not one of the lucky 50% that has good results from Kenalog. If you are in moderate to severe pain_ Kenalog may be worth trying_ but proceed with caution if you are a pre-menopausal female...due to the potential for significant menstrual changes.,F,45,7  weeks,5/28/2008,Kenalog-40
337, 4, seasonal allergies/asthma,none,I have had this shot each year for 4 years (once per year in May) for severe seasonal allergies and asthma due to birch pollen.  I basically cannot go outside during birch pollen season unless I get this shot.  I had no side effects.  However_ I am concerned about some of the side effects I am reading_ so I didn't get it this year_ I might do it every other year instead to decrease the risks of side effects.  I wonder what the long-term side effects are going to be.,F,32,4  times,5/24/2008,Kenalog-40

I went to the doctor on a Friday and by Monday I was feeling fabulous.  I have suffered from allergies forever_ so I am glad I found something that might do the trick when allergy season hits every year. I am so glad I didn't get any side effects.,F,43, ,5/5/2008,Kenalog-40
340, 1, Contact Dermatitis,Anxiety_ depression_ joint and muscle pain_ back and neck stiffness_ indentation at injection site,This drug has given me side effects for the past eight months. As soon as one symptom goes away_ another one surfaces. I've heard that it can stay in your system for up to a year.

I am now seeking psychiatric help to treat the effects of the drug.  Those treatments come with their own side effects.  The whole thing is a slippery slope.  I would not take this injection again_ and I don't recommend it to people whose diognostic situation isn't severe.,F,45,2  weeks,4/22/2008,Kenalog-40

The first 4 days my head hurt so bad my vision was blurry. The tested me for everything in the book and oviously that was not it because I was having a reaction to the shots. I recieved two shots in my forhead_ one in each cheek and one in my chin. I was unable to go to work for 3 weeks. Today is the first day that I have be feeling 100% functional.,F,20,1  days,4/9/2008Email,Kenalog-40
345, 5, Allergies,No side effects.,I have taken this shot four times over two years for my allergies and have only experienced what summers are like without allergies.  This is supposed to be administered DEEP in the muscle to avoid fatrophy.  I take it in the shoulder where I have very little fat tissue and have had no problem with dents in my body.  Like all things_ you must measure risk based on the rewards you seek; unfortunately_ doctors are more about the reward than the risk.  If OTC will work for your allergies don't take this shot.  If you are female_ don't take this shot (reproductive havoc).  For me_ last ditch effort that it was_ the shot is wonderful.,M,31,2  years,3/28/2008,Kenalog-40
346, 2, Allergies/Sinus pain/pressure,Flushing_ increased anxiety and one panic attack about 2 hours after injection_ irregular menstrual cycle (having a period every other week that lasts 10 days for the past 6 weeks). Hormonal changes_ mild depression_ increased acne and hair growth.,I got the Kenalog 40 shot 01/25/08 for sinus congestion/pressure and pain. I also had a sinus infection at the time. About two hours after getting the injection I started flushing very easily..this lasted about two weeks. I also had a panic attack about two hours after the injection and horrible anxiety_ fortunately that only happened once (the panic attack). on 02/02/08 I started my period and it lasted ten days (not normal for me). Then on 02/16/08 I started my period again (another long one). Then on 03/01/08 I started my period AGAIN. They all last about ten days. So I don't know if it's the shot that is making me feel slightly depressed or just the fact that I have a period that won't go away. My OB/GYN and allergist both agreed that this menstrual abnormality is due to the shot and that I should never receive it again. She said it can stay in my system for up to three months. That means I might be like this up until the end of April. Great. At least I have learned that I will nev,F,28,1  days,3/6/2008Email,Kenalog-40

It was given as an injection sapposedly between three levels of ribs. I think the doctor missed a bit and spilled some medicine in the tissue beneath the skin and the tissue has dissolved.

352, 1, allergies,Suicidal thoughts,I took this drug seasonally for 2 years.This drug works absolutely wonderful on the allergies I suffered from; however_ it is a silent killer. It can bring about suicidal thoughts within 2 days of injection. The drug will stay in your system for up to 90 days. You may understand that you do not want to kill yourself but the drug causes such an urge that you really need to be on suicide watch for a good week. My psychiarist help me put the connection together after another business executive patient of hers went off the deep end in 2 days after receiving the drug from his MD. Be careful. This drug is silently killing people and leaving grieving familes behind with a bunch of unanswered questions. Most doctors do not make the connection.

Next came the bone-deep fatigue and debilitating weakness_ the crazy eye pain_ the severe headache_ the out-of schedule period_ the dizziness_ the body aches_ the depressive state_ the general malaise... What a nightmare really -- I can barely hold myself up on this chair...""  As someone completely fit who does one hour of strenuous Ashtanga yoga every day_ I had to endure this intollerable state for nearly one month.",I called the pharmacist about a week after the injection to report these side effects and was told that since triamcinolone was injected as opposed to taken via the oral route_ there should only be local irritation and that the symptoms I was describing were most like unrelated to the drug! I told hime that this had been the second time out of three that this had happended -- each time I had the severe reaction was when the doctor's technique was less than stellar and the potent steroid got to escape into my system through the bloodstream (e.g._ I was bleeding each time I got sick). I was shocked by how little this guy seemed to know about the drug or its associated side effects. Most disturbing to me was the fact that he tried to talk me out of my symptoms!

I know after seeing a few sites that this has happened to far to many women to not be noticed.,F,31,1  times,6/15/2007,Kenalog-40
362, 5, Seasonal Allergies,I had a dent in the area where it was injected once_ but it went away and I never have had tghat problem since.,I have really bad seasonal allergies.  They keep me awake at night and during the day I am constantly sneezing_ itchy throat_ watery itchy eyes.  When I take the shot my sypmtoms disappear and I feel 100% better.  I guess everyone is different and react to drugs different.  But for me this drug has changed my life for the better.,F,31,7  years,5/29/2007,Kenalog-40

364, 5, year round allergies,Absolutely none.I was prepared for them though as I research any drug I might take thoroughly so I know what I'm letting myself in for. I would have done anything at the time.,Seriously_ Kenalog has completely changed my life_ and my partner's. I used to get hayfever/allergy effects so bad that my eyes would stream every day_ I coughed 24/7 and went through about 2 toilet rolls a day from incessant rhinitis. It was vile. I never looked healthy. Now everyone comments on the change.,F,35,2  years,4/25/2007,Kenalog-40
365, 1, Joint Inflammation,Period every two weeks since February.,,F,30, ,4/9/2007,Kenalog-40
366, 3, Seasonal allergies,This drug immediately stopped my allergies... Hurray!  But I did/do have side effects.  The afternoon/eve that I had the shot_ I had a horrible headache and muscle spasms in my neck.  Also a feeling of pressure in my head.  Also_ I have noticed that since the shot (1wk ago)_ I have had a marked worsening of my premature ventricular contractions (PVC's)_ otherwise known as heart palpitations.  I am still searching to see if this is a common side effect or not.  But this did knock out my allergies_ which had become completely disabling.,This was a one-time injection.,F,39, ,4/6/2007,Kenalog-40
367, 1, anti-inflammatory,flushing/burning feeling in face and neck immediately and for 24 hours afterwards; menstrual irregularities - bleeding every two weeks still; fatigue; depression,Had I known that these side effects would occur I would have never agreed to try this injection.  Dealing with the pain would have been much better and plus my husband and I probably could have conceived by now.  But how can you when you're bleeding all the time and not ovulating?  Unbelievable.  Never again will I try steroids for pain.  I wish my doctor would have explained the possible side effects to me.  Do your research if you're thinking about this shot.  It's been over 2 months since I had one injection and my cycle is so screwed up!,F,28,1  times,3/28/2007,Kenalog-40
368, 4, Herniated disc L4 L5,heart palpatations_ anxiety_ leg cramps in both calves_ menstrual cycle - so far for 4 weeks nonstop.,Helped the pain in my sciatica go away; just wish my doctor had informed me of the side effects so that I would be aware of it beforehand.,F,39,2  times,3/16/2007,Kenalog-40
369, 1, Large Bulging Disc L5-S1 Back Pain,If I would have known about the severe side effects I would have never taken this. I have had my first period after taking the injection. I have had my period for 16 days straight! Its not even close to a normal period either. I have now felt very weak and I have had to start taking iron pills to help give me a boost. I called the anesthesiologist and told him about my problem and he said he never heard of that happening before and that I needed to see my OB/GYN. Well_ now that I found this web site I see I am not the only one who ever had this problem. I am going to my OB/GYN tomorrow just to make sure everything else is ok and to see what he thinks about it. I am furious! I never in my life want to have another period again after having this one!,I had this injection as a steroid epidural that was quite painful to get. I was told that it could last anywhere from 1 month to one year and the success rate that it actually works in patients is about 50/50. Well_ I was just about ready to do anything because of my back pain and my family doctor wants to avoid surgery at all costs if we can. He told me if this didnt work my next step would be to see a surgeon. Well_ after the shot that night I had horrible pain_ so bad I called the doctor back because I felt it wasnt normal. After about of month of some back pain but not bad_ its back. It's been one month yesterday to the day and I have back pain again_ sciatic nerve problems (which I had before) and my leg is now going numb and tingling again. I guess I was one of the 50% that it doesnt work. So I'm going back to my family doctor on the 16th of the month for a referal to a surgeon. I will NOT try this injection ever again!,F,26,1  months,11/5/2006Email,Kenalog-40
370, 3, Back pain (Sacroilliac joint tear),Depression_ anxiety_ mild paranoia_ insomnia_ bloating_ acne.,I had 3 Kenalog shots within a 6 month period. The first two shots only eased my back pain for a couple of weeks; so my doctor tripled the dose on my 3rd shot. That's when I experienced alarming side effects (especially depression).,F,47,3  times,10/25/2006,Kenalog-40
371, 5, seasonal allergies,The first time I got the shot_ it was administered in my gluteus muscle and within a few days I noticed a dent where the injection had been given.  It didn't cause any discomfort_ and it filled in after about six months.  I got another shot a year later and didn't get a dent from it.  I haven't had any problems with menstrual spotting because I'm on Depo Provera and haven't menstruated in two years anyway.,This drug is a miracle!  Prior to my first injection_ I had tried every prescription and OTC allergy drug out there.  When my Dr. decided to try Kenalog on me_ I was on three meds and still suffering.  After the shot_ it's like I don't even have allergies at all.  The only side effect I've suffered is the temporary dent I got from the first injection_ and I'd take that any day over speniding 6 months of the year being made miserable by allergies.,F,26,2  years,9/28/2006,Kenalog-40
372, 1, Back Problems,Had the shot one time on the day that I started my period....well_ that was over two weeks ago and I have not stopped. I usually have a cycle of three days but since the shot it has been about 16 DAYS!!!!!! I wish my Dr. had told me. I would of tried to deal with the back pain before dealing with the pain of going to the drug store all the time to buy tampons!!!,,F,32,1  days,9/20/2006,Kenalog-40
373, 3, seasonal allergies,Bleeding for 3 months,I got the injection 6/20 and started my period about 3 weeks later and have only stopped bleeding for about 1 week since then!,F,28,3  months,9/18/2006,Kenalog-40
374, 5, Seasonal Allergies,I have experienced no side effects,I have had terrible seasonal allegies for most of my life_ age 42 now. Began taking Kenalog shots about 10 years ago off and on but more recently since I've moved back to the upper midwest. I get 2 shots a year_ 1 in April and 1 in August and that's it. Kenalog is the only drug that relieves my symtoms that sometimes overwhelm me. I have tried every other product on there and not have worked including immunotherapy. The only thing that did work at one time was chiropractic work believe it or not but it relieved most of my symtoms_ unfortunately it's to costly for me.,M,42,8  years,8/27/2006,Kenalog-40
375, 3, allergies,I received the Kenalog shot for my seasonal allergies and yes it did help but now I have had a period for 2 months. Will it ever end?,I am never getting this shot again.

377, 1, diagnostically_ plugged ear,Menstrual irregularities. Period every 2 weeks since taking the shot.,Did not help my ears. Should not use for diagnostic purposes.

378, 1, asthma,Subcutaneous fat atrophy of my arm at the injection site (inappropriate at that) which_ after a year_ is still rather deep and has been starting to hurt lately.  Was told by a doc that it will never heal.  Also_ soon after the injection I had a menstrual period that lasted 41 days.,I WOULD NEVER EVER TAKE THIS DRUG AGAIN! (and wouldn't in the first place had I been informed of the side effects.),F,34,1  times,1/1/2006,Kenalog-40

I could feel my heart dropping beats_ then I would become diaphoretic and light-headed. Sad part is that it takes 6 months for this stuff to metabolize out of my system. The sinus infetions and severe allergies were a cake walk compared to this feeling like you're going to drop dead.,M,40,1  times,7/30/2005,Kenalog-40
