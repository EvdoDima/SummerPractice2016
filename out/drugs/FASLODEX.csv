0, 5, metastatic breast cancerr,some pain and swelling at injection site for a day or so. We taped on small ice packs immediately which were helpful.,I'm off Faslodex today and trying Arimidex because I can't justify the expense to the taxpayers...I'm on Medicare & Medicaid with a terminal diagnosis.
