0, 4, Motivation_ energy,minor headaches_ fatigue_ unmotivated,Firstly_ please dont be scared off by the neg reviewers here. YES you should definitely take them into consideration_ but most of them act as if these neg affects are guaranteed for everybody. I dont need to get scientific because I can tell you my own experience. I have been taking adderall since I was 19. (Ill be 30 next month.) I started in college like a lot of people bc I needed to be focused. For me_ once I was done with finals_ or even during summer break_ I would stop taking it since I didnt need it. I was perfectly fine. This cont. for a couple years. After I was done with college I stopped taking it for about a year. My entire life_ I was an insomniac and also naturally very lazy in general. Then I got my first job as a Paralegal at a Law Firm. I decided to get back on adderall so that I would start off kicking butt. I took it regularly (One 20 mg a day) for about a year or so. BC I was safe in my position I decided to get off of it. About 6 mo. after THAT_ I switched jobs to another law firm_ so I got BACK on it. Currently_ I am still at my job and I have been on it regularly since then. What I do_ is break my 20 mg pill in half and take 10 mg in the morning_ and then if I need it again later after work_ which I usually will in order to not nap when I get home_ Ill take the other half. Then_ I crash from the adderall around 10 PM or so_ so its easy for me to go to sleep! I take it every day (incl wknds),F,29,9  years20MG 2X D,8/8/2016Email,Adderall 10
1, 4, Motivation_ energy,minor headaches_ fatigue_ unmotivated,(cont from prev box) the actual effects of adderall will wear off after consistently using it. When this happens_ I have to stop taking it for a week or so and then when I take it again_ the effects come back. Another neg effect I sometimes get is a minor headache when I get home from work. But I either just ride it out or take a small dose of buffered aspirin. Or smoke some weed. (Its 2016 and it DOES help without adding more chemicals to my body.) I will also get dry mouth a lot but I am AWFUL about drinking water anyway! The pos effects are being extremely motivated. It ensures that I dont mess ANYTHING up for a client and get everything done in a timely manner. There are many days I do not take it (bc I forgot it_ or my boss wont be in all week and its an easy week_ etc.) and I def notice that I will goof off more instead of getting prepared like I do when Im on adderall. I also have a tendency to overlook errors when Im not on it. When Im on it_ I literally think of everything_ double check anything I do_ am more than prepared_ and think outside the box. I consider myself a pretty intelligent person to begin with_ but its as if adderall makes me even smarter. I am normally a very shy introvert. When Im on adderall_ I am much livelier_ not afraid to make conversation_ and I am very assertive and quick. After almost 10 yrs of taking it pretty regularly_ I do not experience any of the side effects other people h,F,29,9  years20 MG 1X D,8/8/2016Email,Adderall 10

5, 5, ADHD_ MOOD DO NOS,No side effects I can tell. Perhaps mild nervousness or impatience,Adderall has helped me greatly with my focus at work and energy levels in running errands. It gives me a lot of get-up-and-go. I was on Vyvanse_ which though it worked somewhat_ can't hold a candle to Adderall. I read of a way to jumpstart my Adderall and get more out of it_ and ran this idea past my doctor_ who said biologically it makes sense: Take 2-3 Tums tablets with your Adderall and it will last longer and you will feel its effects stronger. I do not know the exact science_ but a more basic stomach environment helps the drug be better absorbed. And this makes sense given people are told not to drink citrus juices with their Adderall -- they dampen its effects. When the penny drops_  Adderall has it all over many other ADHD medications (Vyvanse_ dextroamphetamine)_ because it contains two amphetamine salts: dex for mental focus_ and lev for physical energy. With many drugs_ I say the oldie but goodies are better than the new fangled ones put on the market to pump up drug makers' profits. Adderall is a classic. Ritalin is a classic_ too_ but my week on that made me want to become a hermit. For my buck (and sanity)_ it's ADDERALL.,F,38,60  days20 2X D,6/18/2016Email,Adderall 10

9, 1, ADHD,Chronic fatigue_ autoimmune disease (RA). Fibromyalgia. Adderall induced depression.,There is a reason there are no long-term studies on this drug. After 5-6 years of taking Adderall XR 30 mg and 10 mg later in the day_ taking days off from Adderall was not an option. Because on my 'days off' I never moved from the couch_ had zero energy and slept like I hadn't slept in years_ so I basically 'needed' it everyday for energy. Soon I started not being able to get out of bed without it. I worked full time_ went to college_ and raised my kids_ bought my own home_ etc. After Twenty + years of Adderall_ one morning after laying in bed waiting for the Adderall to kick in_ nothing happened_ but I decided to get up anyway. Only when I got up_ I could not even move my leg to walk. I knew all the years of taking this artificial energy my body could not produce one ounce on its own. I was done. The gig was up. I laid in bed for a year. Lost my job_ lost my house. I slept and slept and slept. This drug is working with your body to give it energy_ in excess. Don't for one minute think there won't be a price to pay_ because there is. It robs your immune system. The reason there are no long term studies on this drug is because when adverse reactions began appearing_ the study ended. There is no profit in bad drugs. Don't fool yourself into believing there is no harm in this drug_ for this drug to give you energy_ it is taking the energy from your reserves. When the stimulant receptors can no longer respond to the drug_ disease sets in and your body gives out.,F,51,25  years30 1X D,4/22/2016Email,Adderall 10

If I was closer to my ""normal"" weight_ the total weight loss would be on the order of 20-25 pounds_ and this weight loss occurred over the span of a year. Another ""side effect"" is that the drug has had a positive effect on my depression.

18, 1, ADD and mild depression,"This drug ruined my life. I don't know if it was only the adderall or toxicity coming from me combining it with Luvox and glutamic acid. Adderall has bene proven to be highly and permanently neurotoxic in both animals and humans at dosages similiar to those used ""medically"". It slowly sucks the personality and soul out of you and turns you into a horrible_ paranoid person. Adderall_ Vyvanse and Dexedrine are all just fancy names for Speed/Amphetamine. They are extremely similar to and equally potent to Methamphetamine. Please everyone get this in your head people. Meth differs from Adderall by one Methyl group. It has identical mechanism of action and side effects as Meth. You see all those faces of Meth warnings? Yeah....that can happen to you if you use too much Amphetamine (Adderall) too. I study Public Health and feel oblidged to inform people that Big Pharma is evil. They somehow manage to market neurotoxic street drugs and give them to millions of kids across the U.S. T",If you have ADHD I recommend you smoke Medical Cannabis. It has a positive effect on concentration for those with ADHD_ especially strains high in CBD and doesn't wreak havoc on your body/mind like this legal Speed does. It is not only neuroprotective (protects the brain)_ but it also has anti inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. If we never resorted to poisoning a majority of the population with toxic chemicals made by Pharma companies and the FDA actually did its job properly_ by outlawing all of the toxic chemicals_ 'medicines' and genetically modified foods that have been proven in both preclinical and human studies to cause harm_ then we would all be far more happy and healthy. By the way_ the U.S. is the only country that legitimately prescribes Amphetamine to its population. Amphetamine is outlawed in practically all countries due to the well known toxic effects the drug has on the brain and its ability to cause paranoid psychosis in previously healthy individuals.,M,21,2  months30 4X D,11/22/2015,Adderall 10
19, 1, ADD,This drug ruined my life. Apathy- I get no pleasure from anything anymore due to this drug frying the dopamine receptors in the brain. I have developed an anxiety disorder and paranoia directly because of this drug. In animals administering this drug only a few times permanently destroys 50-60% of your dopamine receptors. It also causes brain changes reminiscent of schizophrenia. Read the below articles if your interested. I can only recommend suing your doctor because Adderall is amphetamine/aka speed and should not be given to uninformed patients. http://www.jneurosci.org/content/19/21/9579.full.pdfhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23142493 http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/315/1/91.fullhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486243Psychiatry and the government are evil.

22, 1, ADHD,This drug will make you feel great the first few days you take it. Then you start building a tolerance. What almost nobidy realizes is that this drug is highly neurotoxic to your brain_ with your dopamine neurons being destroyed the most rapidly. Most of the people reviewing this drug are too addicted to this poison to realize that it has permanently damaged their brains natural capacity to feel pleasure.,"I dare anyone who has used used this drug for more than a month to go off it and see if they can still feel the same amount of pleasure in life that they could before taking this neurotoxin. This is the primary substance used in animal models to create a permanent brain change reminiscent of paranoid schizophrenia. In monkeys given adderall for 3 weeks_ 40-60% of their dopamine nerons are destroyed and this damage has shown to be irreversible. Adderall creates a plain_ hollow shell of a human being who is productive yet lacks the other attributes of being human_ such as strong emotions_ empathy and creativity. Hence why its FDA approved for ADHD. I have a masters in Public Health so trust me when I tell you to keep away from adderall. Methylphenidate and Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) are far safer alternatives as they dont cause any lasting damage to your brain when used for  up to a year. If your interested in reading more then type in on Google: ""neurotoxicty of amphetamine ADHD"" or if you want to see human studies then ""amphetamine and parkinsons disease risk"" or ""Dopaminergic dysfunction in dextroamphetmine users"". The neurotoxicity caused by amphetamine containing drugs is the reason they aren't approved for use in Europe_ with Methylphenidate containing drugs being the only ones available.

I got prescribed 20 mg twice a day for concentration and fatigue. I take one every morning before work (around 6:30) and one late in the morning or afternoon (10-12).

I am now able to sit down and focus long enough to get things done (coursework_ the dreaded reconciling-of-the-checking-account_ bill-paying_ etc.).  I am less impulsive and less hyperkinetic.  I can easily make plans and execute them.  Returning to a task after an interruption takes much_ much less time.  These are huge_ huge things for me.There *are* side-effects: my appetite is definitely reduced.  I manage this by eating before_ between_ and after my doses. I feel quite fatigued by bedtime.  For me_ this is a plus -- I have had serious insomnia for my entire life; the fatigue allows me to sleep.  I had dry mouth and constipation for a few days_ but those resolved quickly.  If your doc prescribes Adderall_ don't let the bad reviews scare you off without a trial.  Remember that people are more likely to report bad experiences than good ones.  There are plenty of us out there for whom Adderall makes the difference between barely functioning (if that) and brilliantly succeeding.",M,27,21  days10mg 2X D,3/20/2015Email,Adderall 10

NO ONE should take this stuff. It will make you nuts. Before I started taking Adderal 20mg 2x a day_ I was a vibrant_ happy go lucky chick. I started taking it because of chronic day sleepiness associated with a sleep disorder.  But honestly my life was much better before I ever took this stupid medicine.  Now mind you_ I've never taken more then prescribed... If anything_ I'd take less the prescribed because then I'd get my refills every other month instead of every month. Pretty much when one starts taking Adderall you feel great! Lots of energy_ lots of interest in doing every mundane thing you've never wanted to do... And you do it happily!  Great concentration and focus on everything you do. Plus_ you really start doing things to the BEST of your ability (cleaning_ organizing_ laundry_ cooking etc) so you feel like you've hit the jackpot.  Until you start getting depressed like I did.  I was taking adderal for 1 year when I noticed that I had to set my adderal right next to me on my nightstand so I could take it as soon as my alarm went off_ otherwise I would not be able to get myself out of bed.  Shortly after_ I found myself not being able to do anything if I had forgotten to take my medication or something. But t really hit me when I went on vacation and forgot my meds.

I get irritable or uncomfortable around people. I get very paranoid. I have a hellish sleep schedule. I was always lean_ but I've lost about 20 lbs. I have to force myself to eat. And I crave liquids_ especially sweet things like soda and energy drinks. I've become reckless. And it's addictive as all get out. There are many days I find myself taking twice my dose. If I run out early_ I count down the days to my refill_ finding myself incapacitated otherwise. But - I'm a junior at a prestigious college and I have straight As.

After taking two doses on day one_ I woke up in the middle of the night with my heart racing_ I was nauseous_ felt extremely weak like I was going to pass out_ and was super dizzy. I honestly felt like I was going to die. I stopped taking it since then. That was almost 2 years ago. Now_ ever since then_ I have random anxiety attacks and episodes where my heart will start racing for no reason and I feel like I'm going to pass out_ which I never had before taking this.

In the begininh of the 80's & late 80's adderrall or ritalin then was considered a ""boys"" medication & I was going to grow out of my jittery ""talks too much in class"" & ""distraction of peers "" comments on my report cards...I was a chatty girl that's all theysaid even after the diagnosis ..""lets see how she handles a class room with less of her friends "" and avoid the ritalin/adderrall. So my parents & doctors did just that. I struggled and made it through. I went to college and never ever used it for recreationalreasons and it was hard . Once the panic attacks hit & the anxiety hit I tried to mellow it all out with becoming a personal trainer in woman's weight lifting for the local gym. It worked ..took my mind off my anxiety & I was a gym nut 7 days a week...until I got injured at work in 2003 & ruptured 8 discs _ dislocated & seperated my shoulder & eventually lost my high profile career as a manager just 2 days before christmas 2011. While home my anxiety became overwhelming _ to the point of dry heaving before any appointments or events. My drive for projects were never completed & my attention span was shot..I never finished any project and to sit through a movie was hard to focus on & do.

Then I tried Adderall IR. My mind was more at peace than with Xanax. I time my last dose to wear off before bed_ so I use the ""crash"" to go to sleep_ although it's not really a crash_ and sleep like a rock. I'm much more calm_ more pleasant to be around.

This medication almost ruined my life.,"Adderall was amazing_ for the first 6 months. My migraines went away_ I started working out_ lost 30lbs_ became very productive at work and home - it was a miracle. However the longer I took it the more I wanted and sought and the worse my life got. I started sleeping only every other night_ I became so obsessed with all the things I ""needed"" to get done that I stopped hanging out with friends or family because I didn't have time for them. I would obsessive over certain things_ like cleaning or organizing my house_ but then other things I wouldn't do at all_ like pay bills because_ in my crazy-obsessive mind_ they weren't as important as having a clean floor. Adderall changed my entire personality_ I began seeking more and more of the medication because I needed more energy for all the things I ""needed"" to get done. I became a liar and cheater_ lost touch with friends and alienated family_ most especially my husband. If my doctor hadn't finally realized that I was also getting Adderall from another doctor and they both refused to give it to me anymore I think I would have lost my husband_ my family_ my house - my whole life.

103, 5, adhd,I  have been on this for 10 years and I will tell you this. If you have these feelings your dose was too high. Any good doctor will start you on a low doseage  (about 10mg) and then slowly bump you up depending on your response to a question sheet. This is something that is slow and about once every 30 days. The other reason for those feelings is that you are taking the instant release. Those are horrid. The xr (extended release) is what is usually given by a docs now. It is taken once. It goes all day and gradually leaves your system so you do not get a crash. If you have bad feelings on a dose smaller than 20mg you should_d know within a month. That means it is not for you or you can try a non stimulant. If your doctor is not doing these things before prescribing  this_ and your first dose is more than 20mg_ get a new doc. Side note..take at least 10hours before you go to sleep. If still bad_  you are either not adhd or you just cant do stimulants. Also_ ADHD should be diagnosed by a,It took me a year to get up to 60mg(which is really the limit.)_and I know most people won't ever got to 60mg but my case is a little different because I have an unusually aggressive adhd (yes that exists).the average dose is from 20-30mg.

Combined with the stresses of going to grad school full-time_ working nearly full-time and thinking I could keep up a part-time drinking schedule_ i upped my dosage to 70 mg throughout the day unintentionally just to 'keep up.'  Started buying benzo's like klonopin or xanax just to have them on hand for days that the come-down was bad so that i could still socially interact with people & be able to chill out/fall asleep. Eventually started getting panic attacks at night lying in bed or waking up with them.

This is my fourth day on the drug in about 3 years. I used to take it all the time when I was 16 but stopped because of the weight loss (I weighed about 105 pounds my junior year..dropped to 95) and the social problems it gave me. I used to be very irritated by everyone and anti-social. HOWEVER_ I was also taking a 40mg dose and being very thin as it was and susceptible to the side effects_ it is no wonder why everything was so difficult for me. Now I am 20 years old_ in college_ and struggling with my ADD more than ever before. I decided to give the drug another go but now with a lower dose. I weigh more than I did in high school and with the smaller dose I don't seem to be getting any of the harsh side effects(So far). I have been very focused without the social anxiety and feel MUCH better on it. Overall_ I'm happy with my decision to go back on the drug but please take caution when using Adderall. 1.) Take it in the MORNING_ otherwise you'll have insomnia.2.) Do NOT over-exceed your dosage. If you're around 120lbs and taking a 60MG dose..consider getting a lower dose_ please.3.) Also_ do NOT take it unless you are doing something that requires your focus. My doctor told me to take it like you would take Tylenol for a headache. If you don't have a headache_ don't take tylenol..if you aren't doing any focus needing activities..don't take adderall.With the right precautions you CAN be safe using this,F,20,4  days20MG 1X D,10/25/2011Email,Adderall 10

The fogginess was gone_ my legacy of procrastination came to an end_ and as a bonus_ I dropped some of the useless extra weight picked up during my boredom binges.

I always tested off the charts but was not interested in school_ doing homework_ or putting the time into completing anything. I could barely remember to take the garbage out as a kid. Throughout my life I have constantly been on the hook with everyone for forgetting things I said I'd do. It wasn't until college that I got in a groove of doing something I loved that I really excelled with stellar grades. After college I found myself in the doldrums  of working for corporate clients as a creative in an extremely competitive and abusive field. I was miserable and unable to keep up with anything that I didn't care passionately about.  A psychology major girlfriend of mine at the time suggested that I go on ADD medication as she was never happy with who I was or my energy level. So I did. At first things seemed great but over the years Adderal robbed me of my personality and made me more intense and defensive than I normally am. Most importantly_ I believe being on Adderall contributed to the downfall of several work relationships_ including emotionally turning the back on people that loved me deeply because I was not able to reciprocate their feelings while I was medicated.

157, 4, ADHD,Aside from very dry mouth_ I was more energetic and able to have mental focus but for only short bursts of a few hours. I opted for this as an alternative to Vyvanse which is the superior medication except Vyvanse is prohibitively expensive. I only take the 15mg in the morning because this med is hard on the cardiovascular system and tough out the crash at middday. Its better than nothing and there are benefits to it_ but my intent is to eventually go back to the Vyvanse.,It is certainly better than nothing for extreme ADHD_ but is very harsh on the cardiovascular system.

I've struggled with fatigue_ absentmindedness_ procrastination_ guilt_ inability to finish projects.  I was always waiting for my employer or coworkers to ""discover"" what a half-ass I was at work.Anyway_ the Adderall is making such a difference in my life.  About an hour after I take it_ I feel it kick in:  Normally I am jittery_ irritable_ stressed_ and my mind races constantly from topic to topic_ and I have a hard time getting started on anything.  Once it kicks in_ I am calmer.  I feel like the world is an okay place and all the things I worry about are going to be just fine.  The lack of anxiety and absence of racing thoughts really helps me concentrate_ and I can get a normal amount of work done in a day.  I am less irritable_ more focused_ and generally happier. The effect lasts about 4 hours_ then it wears off. I know others experience a significant comedown.  I just feel kind of tired_ like you might after a long day of working.  As long as I take my last dose before 2PM_ I have no problems sleeping.  So far_ so great.  I feel like such a burden has been lifted from me.",F,43,5  weeks10 2X D,4/8/2011Email,Adderall 10

Adderall is an amphetamine and it shares many of the same characteristics of meth-amphetamine. while in high school_ i relied on adderall for every single project i ever handed in. this was especially true in my senior year.

My physicians  have increased the dosage throughout the years. Tried time release for a long time_ was not as effective as full strength. Don't know why I even stayed on it. In response to other users_ adderall is not for everyone_  they have not been diagnosed right.  It might be better for ADD than ADHD. In my adult life starting in college I felt always fatigue_ I can describe myself as a  dead person while living on this earth. Adderall not only gave me to live a normal life_ it took a lot of my muscular pains  away_ my congested dry nose  away_ my low blood pressure_ water retention away_ my fatigue away.

He explained to me_ that there is a part in the brain that is responsible for waking you up in the morning and being alert and sharp and focused_ if that site is not functioning properly_ you will get all the symptoms you have_ so you are taking the right med. For those who are curious_ there has been more research going on on this part of the brain that produces the neurotransmitter_  orexin_ which is also the area of the brain that controls our weight.

Now break the 10 mg Aderall tab into quarters and this was. It helped me focus and organize my thoughts_ I did not suffer the previous side effects mentioned. An added and unexpected benefit was an increase in my sex drive that was/is off the chart. Seriously decreased inhibitions (none left). Extremely heightened sensations.

I was dianogsed ADHD 20 years ago. As the concept of methylphenidate and ritalin first came out_ I got to be one of the generation X kids who spent the majority of their childhood in a fog of stimulant induced social isolation commonly refered to as ""Zombied out."" I have taken almost every drug you can think of_ at a ridiculous variety of doses (at 10 years old and barely 80lbs I was taking 25mg x2 daily). I can say_ without absolute assurity_ that my diagnosis of ADHD (by the way_ as adults the H drops off and becomes Adult ADD in reponse to differences in an adults brain then) is from a child) is 100% accurate. Now_ I say this because of what I'm about to say next. Adderal_ a drug I've recently started trying because of the side effects of ritalin and concerta preps of methylphenidate_ initially made my feel Euphoric and Energeized (even at low doses). So right off the bat as a reponse to some of these posts_ euphoria is a listed side effect of Adderal and IS NOT an indicator that you need to be on a different medication... Further_ Adderal is a desxtro amphetmine salt prep.. meaning_ guess what_ its amphetmines. Regardless what your reason for taking them is_ if you are taking MASSIVE quantities.. then you WILL experience panic attacks_ insomnia_ hair loss_ ED_ erratic mood swings_ rapid weight loss_ depression_ suicidal ideation_ etc... etc.._ the list goes on.

I used adderall a few times for sports during high school but did'nt get prescribed until after I graduated.  I went to college part time and worked full time and the adderall made me organized attentive in class even after an 8 hour work day.  I did physical labor for work and the adderall helped but eventually I wasn't paying attention to how hard I was working my body.  I would work my back muscles into knots everywhere and would'nt be able to releive the pain.  I would take 20mg on monday and by friday I would be taking 30-35mg.  I think the adderall helps but I definately started relying on it to pick me up first thing in the morning.

A positive and unexpected side effect that is not at all usual for this drug is that it seems to have cured my phobias and the panic attacks related to them.,I started seeing a psychiatrist in 2001 for post partum depression.  I had dealt with bouts of depression from my teen years on through my adult life but never sought medical treatment.  However_ after my third child my postpartum was so severe that I decided to see the psychiatrist.  He precribed Paxil at first and it worked but for whatever reason he switched me to Celexa.  Celexa worked as well but unfortunately I had no sex drive whatsoever so that was a new problem.  To solve that problem_ the psychiatrist decided I should try Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin solved the problems and worked very well for me plus it seemed like my attention and concentration became noticably better.  In fact_ that was when I first realized how scatterbrained I had always been.  Tasks that I use to start and never finish_ were suddenly completed after years of procrastination.  It was a strange side effect of Wellbutrin that I liked but never mentioned to my psychaitrist at that time.  Anyway_ after being on Wellbutrin for 9 months_ my psychiatrist weaned me off and I did ok except my scatterbrained issues came back.  But_ I didn't ask for the medication back and just figured I was weird.  However_ from the time I was 3 years old I have had these very weird phobias.  I never told anyone about them_ not even the psychiatrist that I saw for the postpartum.  Well by the time I was 37_ the phobias were so bad that they were affecting my everyday life.

It is very easily to become dependent on this drug so if you really do not need it_ do not take it. Plus_ I personally feel it isn't fair to those who truly do need it and now have to pick up their script in person every month or those who need it to do as well as everyone else in school when those who do not need it - take it to do better than everyone else in school. I feel this is almost like cheating...well_ actually it is cheating because if it is wrong to do in sports why isn't it wrong to do in school?  You should not feel euphoria or this great burst of energy. You should feel focused on the task at hand and distractions no longer get in the way like they once used to. Any little noise used to prevent me from doing what I needed to get done and now I notice I tune out the noises. It's nice because I am no longer jumping from one idea to the next to the next and constantly needing to get up and do something else. I personally do not take it every day because I do not want to get dependent on it. Even if you do not have an addictive personality or plan to abuse it_ your body is what needs it and becomes used to having it. So not taking it after taking it every day isn't going to feel so good.

Adderall worked great throughout college and while getting my Master's degree. Sometimes I would increase my dosage to 30mg/day because 20 started to not effect me. The BIGGEST problem with Adderall for me is anxiety/panic attacks. While on adderall_ I had a severe panic attack (while driving) where I had to pull over on the side of the road. It was really scary. I felt like I was going to die and my heart rate increased significantly. I couldn't breath well and felt like I was going to go into cardiac arrest. After this_ I threw my whole bottle away. I was done with it and knew long-term I didn't want to be on it. 2 months AFTER I got off adderall_ I had another panic attack (again while driving). I've never had any problems with anxiety in the past and I consider myself a very laid back person. Now_ I am going back to the doctor to get on xanax because my anxiety is become a problem in every day life. I'm positive that adderall (after being on it so long) has changed the amount of serotonin in my brian. The drug defintely changes you. Now that I look back on it_ I was very emotionally unstable on it as well. I cried a lot and always blew things out of proportion. That has resolved now that I am off of it.

This is the only medication in combination with Lexapro (10mg) and HRT that has worked on my depression.  I was previously on Wellbutrin (150mg/d)and Lexapro 20mg/day.  Prior to that: Celexa for a short time_ Cymbalta (60 mg/day -- that was a train wreck!) and previous to that Prozac -- lost a lot of weight on Prozac and developed a tremor.  Always though_ even with the Wellbutrin/Lexapro combo_ had to take multiple naps a day and had very little motivation_ but a lot of internal restlessness.  The Cymbalta was probably the worst in terms of side effects for me -- made me not care at all and very loopy...difficult to work.Adderall has really given me my patience_ motivation_ desire_ happiness and sense of positive well being back.  I would also recommend any woman with depression get their hormone levels checked -- Estrogen balance is key to serotonin balance.  As with any drug like Adderall_ communicating with your physician is essential as is taking care of yourself with exercise_ nutrition and good sleep habits.

Usually within an hour it is peaking_ and last about 4-5 I'd say. I often take another 10mg after lunch. This drug WILL affect your appetite. Specifically_ it is a stimulant that elevated your blood sugar. Because of this_ your body suppresses hunger naturally. There is not really anything inherently 'bad' about weight loss on this medication_ however_ people should be aware of it; especially in younger children. I find that there is a 'crash' to this drug. It is not a very hard depression_ it is more like apathy. The good news is_ the medication seems to work longer than the excitement period wears off. I really love this stuff. It does work.

I take 1 10MG pill per day that I need to study_ I take it no later than 4 in the afternoon so that I can go to bed by 10pm_ and I feel fine. No psychosis_ no suicidal thoughts_ and no crazy rantings on here about punching cats and cussing at my boss. Its called moderation folks.,M,35,5  years10 MG 1X D,8/24/2010,Adderall 10

219, 3, ADD,At first mainly just insomnia_ grinding teeth_ and loss of appetite but as time progressed I became addicted to the drug and once when I didnt refilly my prescription after being on it for 4 months I was depressed and fatigured until I went to refill my adderall.,"I see how a lot of people on here with less than a year of taking adderall are talking about how wonderful it is.  If you have ADD/ADHD adderall shouldnt make you ""motivated""_ it should help increase focus. If adderall is making you motivated or bringing feelings of euphoria then you should immediately change to a non stimulant ADHD drug.  This drug is extremely addicting and after being on it for after a year my doctor continued to up my dosage from 40mg a day to an eventual100mg a day.  Once you start upping your dose you soon realize your a slave to this drug.  Seriously after taking this drug for 6 months see if you can go a few days without it and see how you feel. Adderall(dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine) is a combination of amphetamine salts and this drug is a Class II narcotic. Other drugs falling under Class II in the US include morphine_ phencyclidine (PCP)_ cocaine_ methadone_ and methamphetamine. Drugs are put under Class II only if the drugs have high potential for abuse and dependency.  After a little bit of a year on adderall I started experiencing some alarming side effects. I starting having very bad anxiety(never had this before in my life) and just happened to get an EKG done because I was complaing of hear palpations and my EKG was not right.

I feel okay for a while and I am able to complete some tasks and actually spend time with my son (two years old). Before Adderall_ we just watched tv pretty much all the time. I had no drive to do anything else. Ive definitely interacted with him a lot more the past three days. But at the end of the day_ I dread taking it the next day because I know that I'm going to feel good for a few hours then feel really bad the rest of the day.  I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I have insomnia_ but have always had this so it's not different than before. Any physical transformation so far is from my increased focus on yoga and pilates classes as opposed to decreased appetite. I've always eaten healthily_ and appetite loss is only minimal.,"I researched this drug both online_ and in informal conversations with friends. I'm well aware I'll probably develop some kind of tolerance_ so I'm trying to delay this by taking only during the weekdays. One of my best friends started taking this months ago_ and I've noticed incredibly positive changes in her habits and personality. We have been similarly diagnosed_ so my psychiatrist prescribed it after I inquired about the possibility. Not unlike desipramine (which I took previously for about 6 months) but more intensely_ I feel that for the first time in my life I'm capable of what I saw naturally in so many others_ the ability to finish a task. I used to think I was just undisciplined_ and watched how people around me turned into responsible adults with successful careers while I flailed. I'm echoing other patients in that I'm able to perform a block of work without jumping up every 5 minutes_ and efficiently organize my thoughts (the same goes with the improved condition of my apartment!). Listening to people has been a great pleasure. All in all_ I finally feel like I'm transforming into a ""grown-up"" at the age of 38! I was always a ""big idea"" person sans follow-through. If I'd taken this 10-20 years ago_ I can only imagine what I could have achieved. However_ it's better late than never.

My desk_ tables_ and shelves stayed emmaculate all year. I have come home this summer and my house looks like someone with OCD lives here.

This past year i was diagnosed with AD/HD  Inattentive Type.  The way it is explained to me and from the way i understand it from my own experiences_ the inattentive type is harder to spot_ as the overflow of sensory and emotional stimulus is internalized continuously (as opposed to externalized with the hyperactive type) - commonly leading to things like anxiety and/or depression.  Adderall is there to speed you up_ and grant you the capability of taking in this overflow of information and being able to sort through it_ making everything from big life events to small everyday happenings easier to manage.  It is NOT a cure... it is a treatment - and it's important to note the difference.  But for people like me_ it changes lives and sometimes saves them.  That being said_ it is worth any negative that I have come across so far_ and it seems to me that most of the mental side effects that are mentioned above and below should and can be handled by the person.  Adderall is there to help_ but you have to adjust your own mindset as well if you plan to continue taking it.  Also_ someone above said that AD/HD isn't real.  That makes me a sad panda.

Started taking it (a little too late in my high school career) and started to get my life on track. My grades were good but I felt like I was starting to get addicted and felt like a zombie more normally after taking it. So I decided to take a break from it for a month_ and in that month I was more depressed and irritable than I had been in my whole life.

Twitches around my eyes and an increase in Blood Pressure.  Some loss of appetite. Anxiety.,I have to say that I really like the effects when first taking adderall.  I felt like it was a huge help for my impulsivity and lack of focus.  I stopped taking it a few times because I did not like all the side effects and it seemed not to work as well.  I learned that it worked well with exercise and caffeine seemed to boost the positive effects.  HOWEVER!  I was at work and about an hour after taking it when I normally would feel it kick it I started having pain in my back.  It radiated out and down my left arm and jaw.  I began feeling tightness in my chest and some pain.  I nearly passed out.  Needles to say I went to the hospital and 3 days later after lots of test and being transported to another city I was diagnosed with having Spasms of the Arteries (Heart Attack).  I was shocked and the Drs all agreed that it was because of the Adderall.  I do not have high cholesterol; no know clots_ no family history.  I was in good shape and ate well.

Kinda like popping the neck carefully to the left and then back to the right. (Dont recommend this) it was only helpful to me at times. Experiencing the chest pressure was concerning but working in a healthcare setting I was able to get follow up care from staff just to be on the safe side. BP was always good as well as pulse.

I try not to take it on weekends as a tolerance builds quickly giving weakend results. Do not take close to evening time. I DO NOT experience teeth grinding/insomnia/headache like others have. I usually have to make myself want to eat to stay healthy_ but do not eat large portions of food. I always carry gum around as dry mouth is predominatly persistant. Judge for yourself whether you honestly need it to sufficiently function properly. Hope this helped_ being completely honest so others may have accurate information from a patients perspective.

281, 5, few reasons,insomnia_ increased productivity & capability_ mood lift_ appetite suppression_ euphoria_ increased energy_ increased heart rate,Additional comments are definitely necessary in my case. I initially began taking Adderall during a low point in my life when I was a kid coming off of steady cocaine use involuntarily_ to replace it with. I was getting it from a friend who was over-prescribed drugs that she didn't want or need_ and each of her pills were 60mg. Being in the mindset that I was in_ I simply took two pills as my daily dose. I had no idea how much that was at the time; I didn't give it any thought. I thought it was the greatest thing though (despite the amount_ considering my position)_ because I was getting all the homework I'd ever gotten done (when I was already out of school anyway...). The thing was_ I was doing my homework nonstop until 6am_ all through the night. I ended up turning pretty neurotic and getting violent fairly quickly into this regimen. However_ now that I'm in my right mind_ it helps me tremendously (and definitely in normal doses_ e.g._ 20mg). I've had ADD for years and years and struggled with it severely_ as well as other compulsive behaviors_ and Adderall seems to level me out while also lifting me up. I sort of feel like I'm cheating_ rather than privileged or compensated for... but really it's a great help. If I ever notice that I'm starting to build a tolerance I go taper my dosage down a bit and hold off for a while before going back up_ to ensure that I don't ever end up dealing with that 120mg/day crap again.,F,17,3  years,1/14/2010,Adderall 10

283, 5, Adult ADHD,Euphoria_increased sex drive_ frequent urination_ increased heart rate_ elevated blood pressure,Before adderall_ I was a brilliant but lousy student_ mediocre employee who never seemed to really live up to my potential.  I was diagnosed with ADHD at 30 although I was a classic ADHD kid but no one noticed as it wasn't a known dx at the time.  I started out at 10mg. The only way I can explain it is to say that before it was like having a ferrari but only able to use 1st and 2nd gear.  On adderall_ I had full use of the entire machine. I'm freaking brilliant now. I only take 30 mgs a day but never needed more. I think most people who experience really bad side fx is taking too much. When I take too much_ I do get sleepy. One glass of Ice T will keep me up all night though. I don't know what I'd do without it_ but I do wonder the affects it has on the addrenal system. I don't eat much but have gained quite a bit of weight.,F,39,9  years,1/10/2010Email,Adderall 10
284, 2, ADD,chest pain/weight loss/loss of appetit,I took adderall for about 6 weeks initially. I immediately noticed increased HR/palps etc and some SOB. I thought I was nuts.  My MD thought maybe it was b/c I had gotten the generic and decided to try me on brand.  I continued to have CP.MD then gave me nitroglycerin to take if I got the chest pain again_ which I did. Nitro worked to relieve the CP.Went to cardiologist.BP good_ chol good_ active person forever (run marathons/do triathlons)-no reason to have ANY cardiac issues. Cardiologist decided to do EKG resting while not on adderall. EKG normal.  Cardiologist then instructed me to take the adderall while hooked up to EKG. After about 10-15 minutes_ I got the usual chest pain. Cardiologist came back into room and I knew he was concerned. He immediately gave me nitro and I asked him what was up and he informed me that he was really surprised that I had and elevated ST segment on my EKG. I am also a RN_ so I knew what that meant....an elevated ST segment is what you see on an EKG when someone is having an MI (heart attack). It went away as soon as I got Nitro. I went on to be worked up stem to stern including coronary artery CT scan. My heart was beyond better that average. There was absolutely NO disease in my heart. The cardiologist felt that the adderall had probably given my some vasospasm in one of the coronary arteries. He obviously recommended that I not take the drug.  That being said_ for when I did take it....it workde so well at keeping me focused and organized.,F,37,3  months,12/28/2009Email,Adderall 10
285, 5, ADULT ADHD,*Dry mouth*_ insomnia_ tightness around neck (anxiety)_ weight loss_ increased concentration_ insomnia (mild with benzo)_ better quality of life.,I think people who are not happy with the results of this medication are people who have been wrongly diagnosed.  This medication if taken correctly as well as monitored correctly is amazing.  I take 20mg twice a day_ overall I feel like a new person.  I can focus_ study for the first time in my life_ get good grades yeah_ but actually not memorize what im being tested on_ actually grasp the concept.  I have subsequently lost weight which is nice_ however_ although weight loss was a big issue for me my whole life_ the risks of taking this medication for weight loss well over power the benefits by far.  I am in a tug of war with my self_ because although the medication is a stimulatant which is dangerous_ it does alter my life dramatically. Its a toss up besides take it and be happy and sucessfull_ or dont take it and who knows? Right now I am satisfied.,F,25,3  months,12/26/2009,Adderall 10
286, 2, Studying/Alertness,Increased pulse_ Euphoria_ Sweating_ Loss of Appetite_ Dry Mouth_ Teeth Grinding_ Insomnia_ Intense Focus_ bad breath_ Headache_ Depression and Emotional Instability_ Anti-social behavior,This drug worked like charm the first few times i took it and helped me to pull all-nighters while dealing with my college workload. Kept me awake and focused me like nothing i've ever felt. But after 3 years of occasional(but steadily increasing) use_ I have to say this drug is evil.  I have finally become aware of the depressive and anti-social effects this drug has caused and I am fully dissatisfied with the person I have become. It has changed the way I interact with other people and dulled my social skills and natural wit. I was one of those people who always had an immediate response to any comment and now_ unless I am on the drug_ my brain is slow and foggy during social interaction and I have trouble making eye contact with people. These effects fade over the summer when I am not taking the drug for the academic boost but reappear once i resume use. Since realizing the effect it was having on me_ i only use it now on the rare occasions when i have to pull consecutive all-nighters because caffeine wont cut it. when i graduate ill never touch the stuff again. You are better off never trying it.,M,21,3  years,12/17/2009,Adderall 10
287, 3, Recreation,Euphoria_ Anticipation_ Restlessness_ Concentration_ Mood Swings_ Irritability_ Depression_ Fidgety,I tried adderall here and there for the first few years in college.  Then I started buying more of it the past few years.  I'll take about 20 mg every coupe of days On/Off.  I take it mainly to get motivated and stay up for college classes_ etc..  Some days it's great.  I remain happy throughout the day_ sociable_ motivated_ and focused.  Unfortunately_ it seems lately that I've been experiencing social withdrawal_ zombie like thoughts_ depression_ irritability_ and trouble concentrating.  I take it because sometimes the benefits are so great_ but the negatives are outright terrible.  It's quite a strange drug b/c there are days where I experience no bad feelings_ then there are times when the drug acts against me.  I will probably quit soon.,M,23,2  years,12/14/2009,Adderall 10
288, 3, Anxiety/ADD,Loss of Appetite (for first few months)_ Teeth Grinding_ Irritability_ Mood Swings_ Dry Mouth,The drug is extremely effective at the beginning and still effective now (although somewhat less) after taking for 3 months.  I'm currently taking around 75 mg a day.  I used to get incredibly tired at all times during the day at work regardless of how much I slept but now I'm completely awake all day.  I do believe that it makes me a lot more emotional about things that before hand wouldn't really phase me.  For example this girl that I used to date and broke up with because I just got kind of tired and annoyed with her recently got a new boyfriend and I was unbelieveably upset_ including crying (first time in probably 2 years) and an inability to get her out of my head.  Some of it may have been real but it was definitely exascerbated by the drug. If I drink to much coffee with it I can get incredibly nervous and have a difficult time keeping one thought in my head at once.  I think someone mentioned it before but it does sometimes feel like I can't concentrate on just one thing although all of the things that I'm thinking about I am concentrating on_ if that makes sense.  For instance I will do work for 15 minutes then go on the internet for a few minutes and keep switching back and forth.  The difference on the meds however is that I can switch back to my work without trying to remember what I was doing.  Overall I would say that the benefits outweigh any side effects.,M,25,3  months,12/14/2009Email,Adderall 10
289, 2, Adult ADD,No side effects but no benefits either.,I was diagnosed with adult ADD about 2 months ago. My Dr. first started me on Strattera. I took it for a month in increasing doses. It was working well for my ADD symptoms_ but I was experiencing strange vivid dreams every night while taking the drug. My Dr. took me off the Strattera because of the dreams and started me on Adderall generic 10mg twice a day. I saw no improvement at all_ so he increased my dosage to 20mg twice a day. Still no real improvement. The only difference I can really detect is that I am a little less irritable_ other than that I have seen no benefit from this drug. I even tried increasing my initial dose in the morning to 30mg and still nothing. My Dr. said I should be able to tell a difference at 20mg. I can see it works for many people but has little effect on me. I saw my Dr. again yesterday and he was going to have me try Effexor XR_ which is a reuptake inhibitor somewhat similar to Stratter. Effexor is an antidepressant but has been used to treat ADD in adults. After reading all the scary stories on the net about sever withdrawal symptoms when going off Effexor I don't think I want to try this drug. Not sure what my Dr. will have me try next. I would like to know if anyone else has used Adderall and found it ineffective_ and if they found something else that worked for them.,M,38,30  days,12/10/2009Email,Adderall 10

I just want natural energy_ exercise doesn't give me that unfortunately_ cant tolerate antidepressants. i know i'm addicted to that energy it gives me to do daily tasks. without it i only want to sleep.,F,34,3  years,12/6/2009,Adderall 10
292, 3, For anxiety and scattered thoughts,The most noticeable side effect for me is dry mouth (especially swollen tongue)_ teeth grinding and very little desire to eat.,Does anyone else feel like they become somewhat obsessive on this med?  For example I was taking at one point 90mg over the course of a day and I was preparing for the LSATs and became really into studying for it and always doing a ton of work_ which is a good thing maybe.  However_Then I found out that a girl I had previously been dating (who I actually broke up with because I was kindof over it) got a new boyfriend.  For some reason I have been completely overwhelmed about not being together with her.  I have cried a number of times_ which I almost never do and can't stop thinking about her.  I do think that part of it is a bit of regret for breaking it off but I also think its being exascerbated by the adderall.  I hadn't cried in like 2 years. I feel like the higher dosage of adderall can cause some really serious depression.  Some of it could be sparked by the stress of my life but I've been really feeling crappy.  Has anyone else had similar effects?,M,25,2  months,12/3/2009Email,Adderall 10
293, 5, ADHD,"A good drug for me. My doctor first tried Wellbutrin on me. I told him I felt much better about still being incompetent.

On Adderall_ I get 4 or 5 hours of high-quality productivity every day. With coffee breaks_ socializing_ etc._ this is more than most professionals get. Notice I said ""high quality"" productivity . . . I would like longer duration but am grateful for what I get.","Reading the comments in this website_ I note quite a difference between ""geezers"" using Adderall and others using the same drug. Self-awareness is critical to using Adderall responsibly. Best advice is to 1) combine Adderall with as much exercise (even stretching) as possible and to 2) take a day or two off now and then.

294, 4, prescribed,Everything everyone else said has been experienced. some frequently_ some not as frequently_ depending on my body condition.,"Ive been prescribed since 6th grade. Didn't think too much about it back then but all through high school_ this ""adderall"" prescribed to me attracted alot of attention in high school as well as college. This was because people were using it for its SIDE EFFECTS. ladies were using it as a weight loss program while guys would use it cause it helped them drink more. some even used it to study overnight for one night of the weekend and party for the rest of the weekend( a way to cram-study when you don't need to).. these kind of use give adderal a dangerous reputation when it's not even that dangerous. i was exposed to it in 6th grade and my parents regulated all my prescribed medicine (from prescribed cold medicine to these adderall for safety) and my parents and i had to learn all about adderall. so i learned the right way to take it_ when to take it and when not to take it.. my intentions were never for the dumb reasons why a teen may want it for.. so all i'm saying is that_ if you abuse any drugs (prescribed medicine or over-the-counter medicine)_it could cause problems. and that is what people are doing with adderall_ taking it for the side effects and becoming addicts. so for those that are thinking about getting prescribed to help with what adderalls are made to do_ get it and take it.. BUT don't abuse it_ because if you do you will develop dependency on these and sooner or later you will be an addict.. just like any other medication..

296, 4, Suspected Narcalepsy,Dry mouth_ lip biteing_,I was perscribed Adderall for exessive sleepiness and suspected narcalepsy. Often I would head out for work after having two cups of coffee and end up pulled over on the side of the road for a short nap after 30 min. The first few days after taking the drug I found something else that quite startled me. Not only my tiredness go away_ but I found my brain was working at a much higher level. In my youth I was always an underacheiver and not highly motivated. I always suspected I was much more intelligent than I appeared_ but couldn't get my thoughts into actions in a timley manner. This positive mental affect has backslid somewhat and I would like to get it back_ but after my first meeting with my Dr he indicated it would not be a good idea to do so. I think this is probably the addictive properties of the drug. This will not present a problem for me as I am happy with what I have and I think in the long run it would be a mistake to try. I highly recommend this for those who need it. It has changed my life for the better as before I was in a fog most times compared to now. I expect my business and familly life will benefit from the dramatic change.From looking at the other posts it is very important to respect this drug as if misused it can take more than it will give.

I've had doctors ask about symptoms_ and they have changed me from drug to drug before a doctor that I trust completely put me back on it.  My body reacts very badly to the XR formula- it used to make me vomit so much that eventually just the slight taste of the pill in my mouth would set it off.

I have to watch my mood while on it as the drug levels fluctuate_ and this gives me an indication on when I should (if needed) take my next pill (I take 10mg at a time)_ and NEVER after 3pm.  I always experience dry mouth_ but it encourages me to drink plenty of water which I never did before.

The active ingredients are known to constrict the vessels in extremities( I definitely noticed my veins more constricted when i was on this ). Joints and connective tissue have a naturally poor blood supply and I believe this drug only compounded the problem. Im quite surprised that many more people have not come to the same conclusion.Second Major side effect= The day after I take this drug_ I feel a bit more emotional and depressed than usual.  Please be advised that all of the preceding side effects improved significantly once the following factors were optimized.

The doctor told me this happens very rarely but it happens. Wish I would have known that before I took it. Had to get a mouth gard and take muscle relaxers now to help with it. The drug did_ however_ help me immensely. I just need my teeth.,F,41,6  months,10/18/2009,Adderall 10

311, 5, ,Euphoria_ wakefulness_ increased aggression,This product is brilliant_ however you have to learn to manage it just like everything else. As soon as you start taking it_ start taking magnesium supplements as well. This will cut down tolerance build up (Google it_ too much to explain in one comment box). You will most likely get some increased aggression_ you need to learn how to manage this. Overall_ a great medication if used wisely.,M,18,180  days,10/6/2009,Adderall 10
312, 5, ADD,Works well. Can concentrate better_ more focused. Dont need it in the rec. dosage my doctor prescribed 10mg_ if I only use it as needed. Plus this keeps your tolerance lower. Railing it seems to work better.,The worst part is the crash you get after using this. I can do under 10mg railed and get a full 8-10 hrs of study/hmrk time in and get good quality work done. Once I start to crash I get very depressed and need to take klonopin to ward of the anxiety and go to sleep. Just use as needed_ not everyday.

313, 5, ADD,Dry Mouth_ No appetite.,I've been diagnosed since I was 16. I used to take Vyvanse_ but switched to Adderall. I like it so much better. I take it every morning before school and sometimes half of one right before dinner so I can sneak a quick meal in and then go finish homework. College classes are easy peasy. I am focused and organized. I always have my work completed and mostly correct. Adderall makes it easier for me to reach my goals without the struggle of not being able to concentrate in my classes and on my major. I used to daydream in class k-10th grade. Now I'm doing well in college! I'm happy. And my excessive eating is controlled and I've lost 11lbs so far :],F,19,2  months,10/3/2009,Adderall 10
314, 4, School,I put a 4 for Adderall because it certainly does its job. Not only does it help you focus INTENSELY_ but it keeps you wide awake and makes you excited to do things you would otherwise put off. However_ with that said_ this drug is very dangerous. I do not have ADD_ and I started taking it to study harder and do better at school. I never had problems concentrating_ but it made me concentrate even more_ which was great (at first). It lifted my GPA from a 3.5 to a 3.8 after only two semesters. But my body quickly developed a tolerance to it_ so I had to take more and more to get the same effect. Eventually_ it felt like it was doing nothing_ until I was literally OD'ing on it and ended up having panic attacks while on it. I was also picking at my skin constantly_ lost a ton of weight until I looked sickly_ and was getting no sleep. After a few months of this hell_ I flushed all the pills down the toilet.

He was angry ALL the time and thought the whole world was against him. He_ normally an easy-going_ compassionate man_  betrayed friends and ruined his reputation in the community.  Of course_ he told his doctor that he felt great_ because he did not see the affects until he went on a business trip for two weeks and forgot to take his prescription.

I felt very happy_ social and extremely focused and really productive. I have never cleaned my house like that ever! It's like your brain takes over all the decision making and the figuring out things and everything becomes easy. I only took it a couple of times but I could see how this drug could become really addictive. I felt happier on this than I had in years_ nothing bothered me and everything rolled off my back. Definately not reality can see it being really dangerous for someone who is running away from their problems. I think for someone with ADHD it may give them the focus they need but they should be strictly monitored for addiction.,F,39,3  days,9/24/2009,Adderall 10

I usually chill in those clouds when I'm on it_ before dropping back straight into the world where I am not as mentally or physically agile (at least_ I don't act as agile when I'm not on it.)I feel Adderall is appropriately named_ perhaps after the ""adder""_ a venomous snake_ and should be regarded equally as dangerous_ or as tempting (should biblical interpretations of the snake be keen) solely because one can die of an adderall overdose AND adderall can be a tempting drug to abuse.Adderall is useful. It increases my focus. It allows me to get good grades. It allows me to finish my homework. It allows me to study *effectively*_ something I have never been able to do without it since I was a wee little boy. Adderall makes me feel ""awake"" and ""in control of myself"".

Although; I had known and was diagnosed as a child_ I waited until I was able to understand/acknowledge ADHD/as well as the treatments involved. I will; and might be the only one it seems! Say; that I have had no problem's with Adderall. I had been diagnosed to take 30 mg (3 twice daily)=60.. (However; I was content with 20mg; often times 10mg in the morning as well in the evening. I did not notice any difference in my eating habits; loss of weight; and CERTAINLY NOT A DIFFERENCE IN SKIN!. HOWEVER; I did get my prescriptin filled about two months ago (Not realizing that the distributer had changed)-And took one pill; ended up in bed for the best of the day. Downward spiral. Adderall prior; was not an addictive substance in my life_ rather helped me cope and manage every day life. Now; I take it and feel worse/depressed/unfocussed/sick to my stomach/dizzy at times/and I also feel as if I have taken a sedative drug rat,I rated Adderall A 3; only due to the fact that BARR (Adderall's new distribution company) Has CHANGED the actual components in the drug; an the sad part; the FDA approved it!! Since the change; It has been a struggle_ and now have to change medication's.(Which I'm sure Barr is happy about!) Not sure how they have the ability to change the components in a drug such as this?!

However_ what ISN'T tolerable is the HORRIFIC ACNE this pill gave me! I have always had crystal clear skin my whole life. I have done every single thing known to man to fix this acne_ and NOTHING has gotten rid of it. Right now I want to cry because I have never in my life had such terrible skin. I'm going off of Adderall..at least until my skin clears up. I like the drug_ but NOTHING is worth this horrible skin side effect.,F,22,9  months,9/10/2009,Adderall 10

My home is organized_ my bank account is not overdrawn_ I've kept a job for more than 1.5 years_ & best thing I am engaged to be married! Adderall 20mg 2x per day keeps me calm_ cool_ & collected. Have been on it for 4 yrs now and have not had a speeding ticket_ have been in a stable relationship for 3 years_ & have money in savings!

I was awake and focused_ with no more short term memory loss. I also did not suffer any crashes like I did with ritalin.  The downside came with an increase in muscle tension and joint aches.  My extremities constantly felt like I was fighting rubber bands to move them_ and I had very uncomfortable pain in my joints.

On Adderall I experience an elevated mood..partially because ADD/depression makes my mood low. Also because it is a side effect of it.  On it I feel positive_ focused_ talkative and pleasant. When it's wearing off I feel chronically depressed. I can totally understand why this drug is prone for abuse. I've experienced some skin problems a few months after I started taking it. I believe it's due to the Adderall. It's somewhat minor and I'm working on fixing it. Overall I love/hate Adderall. It's help in so many ways_ but it has done some bad in other ways. I don't like crying every night because of my depressive crash. & I'm already on 60 mg a day and I feel  tolerance building..already after 8 months.,F,21,8  months,8/14/2009,Adderall 10

I have bouts of insomnia_ but again_ I had them before the drug.,I wish I'd been able to admit my focus and concentration problems were serious years ago. I have been more productive in the past three months than in the past three years. My main fear was a loss of creativity (I am a writer as well as a programmer)_ but I seem to be sharper and more creative. My professional and hobby work has both benefited greatly from this. I see no signs of addiction -- I am not yet done with my June supply_ despite using it mostly-daily. It's very easy for me to not take if I know I won't need to focus on work -- I don't take it unless I have work planned.,M,44,90  days,7/29/2009Email,Adderall 10
327, 5, ADHD,The major side effect is loss of appetite.  Minor side effects I have experienced include increase in mood and headaches (although rare and easily cured by a couple Advils).,How could you not expect side effects with a drug that increases cognitive performance and makes it easy to lose weight?  In reality the side effects are minimal at best.  Actually_ I prefer the side effects as I enjoy the reduced appetite.  For me_ it makes it easier to not eat crap like french fries_ pizza_ ice cream_ etc--all of which are 100 times harder for me to resist when I am really hungry.In addition_ I have not ever experienced any signs of addiction and/or dependence with Adderall.  I am prescribed approx. 40 mg a day_ and I have gone through periods where I have taken it every day for several weeks at a time.  However_ never once has it been difficult to stop taking it.  In fact_ I do it every week--I typically do not take it on the weekends.  One thing I will say is that Adderall is very similar to  of other drugs in that you can build up a tolerance.  However_ if this bothers you_ then you are likely taking it for the wrong reasons--in my opinion.,M,29,3  years,7/17/2009,Adderall 10

I do feel irritable at some points later on in the day and sometimes get dizzy standing up. First thing in the morning when I take the pill i feel very ""bubbly"" and enjoy talking alot..this wears off as the day goes on.

331, 1, To make the Pharmaceuticals richer?,Once you start taking any psychotropic drug_ you are hooked_ and with Adderall 10_ 20...whatever..addiction becomes a REAL issue because Adderall is plain old street speed. The reason your doctor prescribes these meds is because HE/SHE makes $$$ and the Big pharma's make LOTS of $$$. They're premise is: if we keep people sick_ they will continue to take our dangerous_ addictive drugs_ and we will make LOTS of $$$. Psyche docs make LOTS of $$$ by telling people you have this disorder or that disorder and lets put you on this. Do your own research people!,Adderall is possibly THE most dangerously addictive drug on the market. Antidepressants are a close second. Let me re-iterate: MONEY_ MONEY_ MONEY for the Pharmaceuticals. let me tell you folks this is BIG BUSINESS and the Psyche docs will continue to make up *disorders* just as fast as Big Pharma can produce more lethal drugs.Again.......DO YOUR RESEARCH on the FDA & Pharmaceuticals.

I had no idea it wasn't normal to constantly walk around with a maelstrom of thoughts in one's head. This drug also saved my job-was told by my boss that I was the most intelligent person in my dept but had the highest error rate...since taking the med (4+ years) have not had one error. I take an occasional 'vacation' to purge it from my system which can be mildly unpleasant but not immensely. This med can cause issues w/ bp-so if you're older_ you need to be aware of that and if you have blood pressure issues_ probably don't want to take it. If you are getting high from this drug_ then you are most likely misdiagnosed. One good thing about this med is its action is highly manageable...if you know you are going to be doing something needing concentration_ you can take the med maybe 1/2 hr before and are good to go...,F,43,4  days,6/14/2009,Adderall 10
333, 5, ADD College Student,The Bad: I have trouble sleeping while on the 30mg Adderal quick release (take it early in the morning not after lunch). Appetitie suppressed_ I need to eat alot before I take the pill. Extreme dry mouth_ must have water all the time if I take more then a third of the 30mg pill.  It may give me depression at times... but maybe thats just the alcohol abuse.  Sometimes I feel like im a different person and its abit scary. The Good: Extreme Focus_ can study all day_ multitasking and motivation is huge. GPA improved from a 2.86 to a 3.16 and I was taking harder classes!,I've struggled with paying attention my whole life.  Adderall has given me an opportunity to succeed in school.  I'm currently taking radiology courses and this drug was the reason I recieved a B in anatomy.

336, 4, Adult ADHD,thirst_ initial weight loss_ initial increased aggression_ huge appetite on days off (bigger than normal appetite from before I started taking it)_ feeling warm/sweaty but hands and feet are cold to the touch_ faster heartbeat,"It helps me focus_ but I still have to have the willpower to focus on the right things. However_ it does get me up and going when I feel like moping around. The XR works for about 7 hours for me_ with lingering effects for about 4 more hours. I take 25mg XR in the morning_ and then in the afternoon either take another 25mg XR or a 20mg regular_ depending on how much longer I have to work. I do not usually experience insomnia. When I was a student_ I lost weight on the medicine because I had no appetite. Now that I have graduated but have no job_ I have gained it back and then some because I don't have the structure of needing to go to bed at a certain time_ so I stay up and eat after the ""crash"". My doctor recommended skipping one day a week to prevent dependency and toleration_ and I always want to eat so much on that day! On the medicine_ I have no appetite even though my stomach is growling. On my day off_ I want to keep eating even though I'm stuffed. I once took 2 weeks off just to ""reset"" my body_ because I was afraid the medicine was losing its effect. It took about 3-4 days off before my appetite normalized_ and I had no other lingering side effects. It works very well_ but it's not a cure-all: I can easily take it and still waste a day ""hyper-focusing"" on things I don't need to be doing. Use it wisely and focus on the right things_ because once you're focused on one thing_ it's hard to want to shift your focus to something else. Another time_ I took Adderall to stay up all night for several nights working on a final paper. This was a bad idea! During this time_ I experienced hallucinations_ extreme paranoia_ and distractingly high libido. After that_ I never again wanted to deviate from taking the medicine as prescribed",F,24,2  years,5/29/2009,Adderall 10

Then_ when I stopped taking it after my Senior year_ my weight ballooned up to 175 at the highest_ due to the dramatic slowing of my metabolism combined with how I thought I could eat & not gain weight since I could when I was on the drug in high school. When I started Adderall again in August 2008_ I lost 15 lbs within the first month. I have now been back on Adderall for nearly 11 months_ and weigh 120 lbs...I went from a size 14 to a size 6 in less than a year_ and have had the motivation to exercise & pay attention to my diet; all thanks to Adderall. I also used to have trouble with classes and flunked out of my first college not due to inability to do work_ but because I often slept through classes or lacked motivation. Needless to say_ I am no longer constantly fatigued and have more motivation in everything I do_ so at my new school my current GPA is a 3.85. I am also a very serious writer_ and I can now sit down and finish writing a story without getting distracted & I also have had a lot of creative inspiration.

Also_ ironically I find it very hard to sit still (and I'm not normally fidgety) and relax and read a book or do anything that would normally be calming while the drug is in high gear.

The side effects with the 20mgXR were MUCH less pronounced and overall was a lot more pleasant. However_ I have definitely noticed that I can complete projects and stay on task at work.

Two relatives of mine are no longer a part of my life due to Adderall abuse.  These individuals have become easily agitated and outright belligerent on a regular basis.   Why do we pay so much attention to alcohol addiction_ but pay no mind to the thousands (perhaps millions)  of individuals that are adversely effected by Adderall?  Where are the support groups?

It completely changed her.  Stole her soul.  If you do actaully need to take it_ from what I've read_ it seems to be a wonderful therapy and changes life for the better.  But in my experience_ people who are prone to addiction should not take this drug.  It changed her permentaly and she is a complete stranger.  The worst part of it all is that when abused_ the person feels like everyone is out to get them and they will not listen to anyone about how it changed thier personality.  Everyone else is the problem.  Anyone can get this drug if you do some reasearch on the uses.  Dr's should spend way more time getting to know their patients.  I actually went to a Dr and she wrote me a script after a 15 min converstaion and test she gave me.  I don't need it.  I did it to prove a point to my now ex-friend.

Adderall should be carefully monitored. If you excercise more and find yourself loosing weight you may need to adjust the dose downwards. Diet is important (I'm a vegetarian so low  protein intake could be an issue) because without the right amount of nutrients and vitamins you will be running on empty and side effects become more pronounced.

I told my psychiatrist about the troubles I had in school (lack of motivation_ inability to pay attention and focus on work). She decided I take a test for ADD and I scored off the charts. Now I am on 10 mg of Adderall daily and have never felt so focused_ involved_ energetic_ etc. My appetite is only slightly decreased and I can easily eat if I am really hungry. The only side effect I'm unsure of is the intense cravings to smoke and have sex--I don't like smoking more than 3/4 pack a day and I can't have sex with my wife whenever I want to. Sex on Adderall is pretty terrific_ but it's rather inconvenient being horny all the time.,M,27,7  days,1/4/2009,Adderall 10

Unfortunately_ I developed this mentality that ""something was wrong with me_"" and that I needed the drug to stay sane and normal. Without it_ I was never sure what I might do.

However_ I've always been prone to racing thoughts_ talking too much...chalked it up to being creative. But after years of treatment_ trial and error_ etc._ we came to realize that maybe ADD was to blame. Where was I going with this? (Er_ must be time to take the meds). Oh yeah_ hallelujah!

My depression and lethargy decreased more with this rx than any other I've been prescribed over the last 3 years (20mg XR_ usually don't take on the weekends).

I have had insomnia in the past and did not attribute it_ at first_ to the adderall becuase it had not affected me in such a manner previously. Becuase adderall also makes me super sensitive to noises (it's a psychological)_ any noise I would hear when I would try to sleep would become extremely bothersome and I thus began wearing ear plugs to bed. I thought I could hear things through the ear plugs so I invested in over the head ear protection (in addition to the ear plugs) for maximum sound dapening. This was not the worst of the problem. I began to believe that it was impossible for me to sleep more than 3 hours and I one night remember feeling like I could not keep my eyelids closed. THey just would not stay shut.

It affects those with ADD/ADHD much differently than those who do not have it. It sort of has the opposite effect. I have taken dosages ranging from 20mg-80mg_ and have found that the proper dosage is the key. Try to use as low a dose as possible that allows you to concentrate best without severe side effects. If you smoke marijuana while taking adderall the dizziness/temp. vision loss/blackouts become MUCH more frequent_ though this can happen anyway.

I have been able to get good benefits with a much smaller dosage. This is important because it provides the raw materials for your body to make Dopamine and Adderall will deplete you Dopamine levels with a quickness. I also noticed increased fat loss (I'm into bodybuilding so this is a plus). I used to use Ephedrine and I would be able to focus_ but I never put two and two together and never thought I might have ADD. I am on a low dose_ which I feel is fine.

No more sore_ tense shoulders_ neck or back that tend to come with anxiety.,have set reminders on my BB to ensure I take the doses at the right time. 10mg tw daily. 2nd no later than 2:30PM.

Caffiene & alocohol must be extremely limited. 1 cup caffiene_ 6-8ozs/day NO MORE or trouble sleeping will occur. Alocohol in excess completely x's out the Adderall effects. Social anxiety will always be a prob w/out behavioral therapy. Find myself more receptive to conversations_ more tolerant of others_ can focus on & retain what I read. Has done wonders for my focus on artwork! But I have to make sure I focus on the right things or I'll end up spending 4 hrs obsessed with a crossword puzzle.

I am more focused_ but it doesn't do it all for you. You have to have some motivation and discipline to get started. For the first week_ I would be careful and not take the side effects too seriously as it takes your system a bit to get used to. It also helps with my shyness as well as my lack of interest in school. It is important to remember to take as directed and never more than.

After taking this med_ I am more social_ active_ motivated and able to organize and concentrate.  I am not depressed or nearly as anxious while taking it.  I take breaks for a day or two at a time from the med just to ensure my body is getting enough rest since adderall seems to decrease my quality of sleep_ and I also supplement with many vitamins/minerals and take a formula with 5HTP at night to counteract the possibility of the drug depleting chemicals in the body.,M,26,3  months,10/30/2008Email,Adderall 10
424, 5, College,Intense focus on otherwise boring subjects which allows great grades in classes that were never my forte. Adderal_ within the first 45 minutes of taking it causes intense awakeness and focus. The first few hours of mine_ adderal 20 mg. immediate release causes intense awareness_ focus and jittery feeling being extremely social/unsocial depending on activity at hand_ Dry mouth and intense thirst with constant bathroom trips from this_ It supresses appettite which is my least favorite part of the medicine besides the awful hour or two of come downs (until you eat and let your brain relax) I am now struggling to keep weight on_ dropping from 123 to 118 and being 5'6_ does not look natural/healthy. The restlessness fades a bit after the medicine has been in your system for awhile_ 2 weeks for me_ but still as something simple as a coke later at night with my evening dose for homework can make you stay up much longer and make you fill out ratings of the medicine at 5 a.m :),Adderall and I have a love/hate relationship. I am not as fun or spontaneous as I normally am when I am on the medicine but my grades have consistentally been raised atleast 1 to 2 letter grades by the implication of the medicine. Trying to maintain a healthy weight and sleep cycle has been my only problem with the drug. Also_ in response to some other ratings in regards to fast heart beats_ I've had my heart rate taken at the Dr's office while I've been on it and my results were perfect_ even when it felt like my heart was beating at the speed of light.,F,21,2  years,10/28/2008,Adderall 10

Overall I love the happy effects of it_ the 1000x caffeine feeling_ and the impossible-to-be-bored feeling.       I suggest to never smoke pot while abusing even a little extra aderall.

I ended up gaining more weight than I started with.  Also I would be extremely mean when it would start wearing off at around 5 in the afternoon.

Needless to say_ a week later and I had seen incredible results.  Thanks to Adderall_ I am now able to hold down a job and complete tasks and my marriage is much better.  What I can't stand is people who obtain prescriptions for this drug to help with studies.  You people are the reason my therapist waited 2 years before putting me on this drug.  So many people are abusing this medication which results in doctors not prescribing this to people who truly need it.  To the girl going to grad school...I can't believe you made it that far.

After I explain how many different meds I have tried and this is the only one that works_ they dont really care.  They all say for what you deal with_ it only makes you worse.  But I can actually accomplish things when I take it_ concentrate a little better than normal and I am usually in a good mood with it.  Sometimes not afraid to leave the house_ deal with people or just see people where when I dont take it_ I cant do any of those things.  I take Xanax at night to help me sleep.I am prescribed 20/mg BID_ the people on 120/mg a day blows my mind on how they can actually sleep or not stop going.

457, 1, adhd,This medication was Rx'd for my son (along with Adderall XR) who was diagnosed with ADHD.  Initially_ it seemed like a miracle as he was able to focus in class and get work done.  He tolerated it for about a year and then his personality began to change in grade 5.  He became moody and experienced severe mood swings.  Counselors_ MD's_ all saw him and said it was behavioral-no one once mentioned it could be his medication or suggested taking a break from it.  In 7th grade he had a psychotic episode_ attempted suicide_ and was hospitalized for several months.  He was put on anti-psychotics_ which did not help him.  After a second attempt while hospitalized_ he *finally* got a physician who took him off everything.  It was a rough week.  However_ it was more than worth it.  Within 3 weeks I had my son back.  Anger_ depression_ mood swings_ all gone.  He has been medication free for 4 years.  He graduated 2 years early from high school.  Yes_ he has to work harder to stay focused.  Yes_ h,Parents: Be VERY cautious about allowing your child to take this medication.  The extra time & energy needed to work with an ADHD kid not taking meds is tough...I KNOW!

It allows me to finally just be able to sit down_ study_ and retain information. It makes me a happier and more positive person. I used to stay up all night_ sleep all day_ and have a hard time getting out of bed and going to class_ now with Adderall I hop out of bed awake and alert in the morning_ and don't need to nap all day. It completely surpresses my appetite and also speeds up my metabolism. I must have lost at least 10 lbs in the two weeks I've been on it. I may think I'm hungry_ but then only be able to get a few bites of food in.

459, 5, Adult ADD,Loss of appetite is the only side effect I've experienced. The personality related side effects some people are discussing_ such as being unsocial_ are things I actually suffered from prior to starting Adderall XR. Only on my initial dose on the first day did I experience any type of chest tightness. Usually when it kicks in after a few hours I can feel my heart rate increase_ but it doesn't last. I think my sex drive may have increase somewhat also.,So far so good. My doctor initially started me out on 5 mg a day_ which had no affect on me at all. I guess she just wanted to gauge it. A week later she increased it to 20 mg a day. I don't get a euphoric feeling like some people describe. It just simply helps me focus longer_ and improved my concentration. It also improved my memory. I no longer put a load on laundry in the washer_ forget it for 2 day_ have to wash it again_ forget it again_ wash it again_ then finally dry it...lol. I was also notorious for not answering the phone_ I would rather avoid people_ losing my keys_ credit cards_ etc. Just a better quality of life in general. I take my dose when I awake in the morning_ and sleep like a baby at night. I'm not sure why some people experience these dramatic side effects_ and some don't. I'm just lucky I guess. I have to make myself eat sometimes. I get worried that my body will dehydrate. I've lost weight_ not sure how much_ I don't own a scale. That's about it.

My ADHD went undiagnosed for 18 years and school was an absolute nightmare for both me and my parents. Now that I am taking Adderall I actually want to attend school( most of the time :) ) and it is easier for me to stay organized and more focussed but I still have to use the skills that I built from dealing with it while going through elementary_junior high and high  school because the medication alone is not enough for me. The only negative experiences that I have had with this medication is having it stolen by ""friends""_ which has happened more times than I would like to admit. Adderall is VERY popular with college students and with people that do not have ADHD and I had to find that out the hard way.  So if you do take Adderall I would HIGHLY suggest putting a lock on your door and/or getting yourself a lock box that cannot be picked or broken in to.",F,22,4  years,7/24/2008,Adderall 10

Also I take this only monday through Friday while I'm at work. I never have any side effect when I'm not taking the meds (except ADD ;)). There is never a problem with withdrawls or dependancy.

I had been a light smoker before_ but had a marked increase in my urge to smoke as a reaction to the stimulant effect.  I began making irrational decisions because I think it made me ""hyper-emotional"" meaning that if I was happy_ I was now VERY happy and if I was remotely sad_ I would cry or tear up at the drop of a hat.

Talked with my psychiatrist about this_ and he suggested while there was no physiological reason for this_ likely my anxiety was being fed by my lack of focus and the repercussions of that_ trying to keep everything together.

I was diagnosed with ADHD around 8 months ago but my parents and teachers had always suspected it but never bothered to get me tested. Since being on adderall_ my focus is unbelievable and my impulsivity has subsided a ton. The only downside is its potential abuse- I have had an issue with eating disorders in the past_ and while it has helped with bulemia_ I feel like I HAVE to take it so I don't over indulge. But then upon taking it_ I don't eat for the rest of the day. I'm 5'11 and 130 lbs now_ and at one point I was 113lbs. During my highschool years I was steady around 150.

You shouldn't be having a lot of euphoria and shouldn't be taking it to get a buzz. If you have ADD_ it helps you concentrate and focus. I'm not sure if it pushes you to bipolar d/o or not. But when I first took it_ I had a huge decrease in anxiety and felt calm for the first time in  many years. Now I take it only when I feel I have to concentrate.

I have taken 30mg XR for 3 or 4 years and never felt euphoric or anxious.  It just gives me the ability to focus and it's calming.  Honestly_ it saved my job.  I had taken anti-depresants for years and stopped taking them because the depression was gone.  What I didn't know is that anti-depressants can help ADD.  So when I stopped the anti-depressants_ I couldn't focus_ and you could ask me a question... and I would know the answer... but not be able to access it.  Weird and horrible.  Adderall addressed the problem instantly.,The only issue I am having currently is loss of sexual appetite_ which I hate.

I am able to more easily overcome things that would cause me much stress before_ like approaching someone to discuss a work issue.  I am also able to more easily motivate myself to do cumbersome (boring) tasks.  Things that I would previously stress about or avoid I am now able to do.  I am getting things done at home that have been on hold for a long time.  I guess I would now say that Adderall is actually better than I expected.  Physically I don't feel any different on Adderall_ but am finally able to make decisions and get on with whatever task is at hand.

Like I'm full of energy and ready to use it.,Adderall worked really well for me for about a year and a half. I took 30mg because at 6'2 and 240lbs the XR (extended release)_ and smaller doses had little effect. I took it at first because of my ADHD but then dropped off of it for about six months. I noticed a dramatic change: from quiet_ reserved_ and focused_ back to my normal self. I agree it's a members only drug and you can't use it forever. Your body will build up tolerance. Detoxing with Adderall can be a bit of a pain but the only side effects I've noticed are headaches; just a mild pain in my head in the background - more annoyance than anything. I've found_ personally_ for Adderall to be truly effecrive is to only take it when you need it. Weekends_ days off_ or nothing serious going on: don't take it. If you go for more than three or four days without it the headaches will start but when you take it again the long term benefits will last much longer.,M,25,2  years,12/13/2006,Adderall 10

Of course_ my 'mild' ADD had some fairly negative effects on my life_ so I found a doctor who was more understanding. After trying Concerta_ which made me agressive and generally angry_ I switched to regular-formula Adderall. It has certainly helped with my ability to concentrate_ and I'm more likely to finish boring tasks_ but medication is not a cure-all treatment.

I see now that my brain/lobe problem is an organic thing_ born in me it seems.  But I'm not ashamed about it anymore.  I have a disorder_ and I feel fortunate that there's something to remedy it.

I will never increase the dose again because insomnia was harsh. If I take the 15mg XR in the early morning usually at the same time each day_ I can sleep like a baby that evening.

I will say that I never really knew what ""organized"" meant until I started taking this drug. It is not a miracle drug_ although you may think it is for a small while when you take it for your first time.

No mater how much I tried_ I couldn't sit still and pay attention in meetings or complete long tern tasks.  I told the doctor about it and he started me on Adderall.  What a difference it has made.  I can sit through entire days of meetings without making a fool of myself.  If I had started taking this years ago_ I would have been much farther in my career.  I don't take it on weekends_ since I don't need to pay attention to much.  I have tried the immediate and extended release (XR).

There's a huge difference between when I do and don't use it. I'm more motivated to do things when I've taken it (even things like cleaning my room I don't need to be told to do). ADD drugs are fickle though so what works for one person may  not for another. Doesn't mean you should give up though if this one fails there are others out there.

I take it every day as recommended at the same time_ and i only take the pre. dosage.  I dont feel that i have to take it everyday_ but my grades have increased dramatically_ and the only depression that i have experienced is the depression facing the countless years i struggled with school work prior to Adderall.  To bad im just now making the deans list_ and i hate to think of how much better i would have done.

Well_ despite what your shrink says...your not_ yea really.  Ive been on these types of med s since I was a child_ and it wasnt much longer after I was put on ritalin that I diagnosed by polar as well.  Here is why you are getting diagnosed as by polar.  Upon taking adderall you get a high_ and feel pretty confident and are in a very good mood and slowly through a 4 hour period of time you will become down and feel pretty crummy about your self and bee depressed.  take note_ its the medication_ not you_ that are bi-polar.

For the past year have been times of confusion lasting a week or two_ not sure if that is from the drug but that's about all I can think of that could cause it. The most irritating thing is some short term menial task related memory loss_ like not remebering if I showered_ fortunately I shave when I shower so I often have to touch my face to see if I have or not_ not as disgusting as it sounds I manage to check my face every day (LOL).

So I'm not sure if it's the Adderall or just how normal people feel during the day.  I definitely notice more sleepiness after taking it though.  It sucks_ being so sleepy.  But the benefits outweigh the losses.  Without it_ my scatterbrained self would get absolutely nothing done_ and I'd be driving myself crazy.

I have a very fast mind and a terrible time focusing_ which I thought was because of anxiety.  As each day progressed i would develop real physical discomfort from the stress of trying to concentrate and think ( I have a very intellectually and mentally challenging job).  I would wake up great and then it would just get worse and worse throughout the day.  We kept trying to fix the anxiety.  Over the last 3 years_ I took all kinds of anti-anxiety meds (lexapro_ klonapin_ xanax_ buspar...) and nothing worked.  Turns out it that Adderall XR focuses me_ calms me down enormously and helps me sit still.  20mg every morning_ Sundays off.

I was on 30 mg. at that point. I also saw a gigantic change in my grades- for the better. I was able to sit down and do homework for hours on end. In many ways that was good_ but the Adderall XR really took a toll on my heart and I ended up in the ER with chest pains. They told me I had tachycardia and it was most likely caused by the medicine. So I was forced to go through the process of finding a different dosage all over again and ended up at 20 mg. It doesn't work quite as well for me and I've gained some weight_ but I guess that's the best I can do right now. There might be a possible lower sex drive.,I say take it if you need it_ but if you don't- don't bother. I get frustrated here at college because people are always talking about how they are using Adderall all the time and blah_ blah_ blah...

Nothing I have EVER tried (except for addictive benzos) has helped at all for anxiety/depression.  And out of the half dozen or so ADHD meds I've tried_ it's a close call between short-acting Dexedrine and (time-release Adderall).  The XR takes about 90 minutes to kick in...and come down varies wildly between 6 and 12 hours for me!  XR loses effectiveness quickly.  Short-acting adderall works about as short time as Ritalin for me...I'd might be in my system for several more hours_ but the initial high is mitigated extremely quickly by come down after an hour or two.  Proper dosage hard to determine (unlike XR).,M,22,3  years,1/8/2006,Adderall 10

I first used it when I was 21_ and it worked wonders. I started making  straight A's & my paintings became phenonmenal. I lsot weight and looked great.BUT.... after a couple years_ my body didn't react the same to it. It started to make me hyperfocus...not sleep and feel awful. I wouldn't get sleep...so then I couldn't concentrate in the morning anyway! I recommend accepting yourself for who you are. Yes_ people look down on us_ don't understand_ and we get depressed. But at the same time_ i am so proud to be me. I encourage you to find your old personality_ your quirks. I think we were made like this for a reason...maybe we wont be rocket scientists. BUT you will be happier in the end. and well rested!,F,26,4  years,7/13/2005,Adderall 10
739, 4, ADD, Loss of appetite - initially severe_ but decreased over months Weight fluctuation - barely ate for first 6 months and dropped from 255 lbs. to 175 lbs. However_ now my appetite decreases for an hour after taking it_ but then I'm very hungry for the next 3 hours until my next dose so I already am back up to 200 lbs. 4 months later.    Reduced sex drive - used to want it 3-4x per week_ now once per week.  Also_ if I have sex shortly after taking adderall_ I have reduced firmness in my erection.  Everything is still functional but takes a bit more effort. Shorter fuse - more easily angered than usual but not severe,On the plus side_ I am able to focus much better and am considerably more task conscious.  Makes me a better listener and less distracted IF I TRY TO.  That was the biggest lesson - this is not a magic pill that will make you more focused.  It will allow you to be more focused if you TRY TO.  I still have to make decisions to be more responsible_ the adderall just helps to allow me to focus on a given task more than I could before.,M,26,10  months,5/31/2005,Adderall 10
740, 5, to get my life in order,ocd_ addiction_ moody_ bad taste_ dry mouth_ small appetite_ insomnia,adderall is the best thing man has created.  i dont mind the side effects in comparison to the benefits of the drug.  it helps me be more motivated and focused.  i multitask now and am more creative. i write poetry and am constantly thinking of new ways to improve my life through organization though sometimes obsessive.  i have used it recreationally for a long period of time and had a good time until my prescription ran out.  now i take it as prescribed and suceed one day at a time.  there is a substantial change in the way i think when on this med.  it is definatly a more rational way to think and through all the bullshit i deal with in my life(id rather not get into it)i somehow continue to strive to increase my quality of life and always try to optimize the situation. adderall is a miracle and i would give it to everyone if i could.  i honestly think everyone can benefit from the experiences on adderall.  ive done a lot of researching and a lot of experimenting with high doses for days till the point of confusion_ psycosis_ paranoia_ and hallucinations of psychedelic nature.  and still i say this drug has wonderful theraputic properties.  try them today ask your doctor about a trial.  its your life and you can take control but watch addiction it will be there waiting.  40 mgs per day reguardless of when i take them gets me through any day.,F,21,7  years,5/30/2005Email,Adderall 10
741, 5, ADD,read next paragraph,I first started off taking 10mg when I was about ten years old. My inital response to it wasnt very positive because I couldnt think about one thing at a time I had to do a hundred things at once. So my mother decided to get ritalin prescribed for me to see if that drug would work better. Ritalin only made me go to sleep and feel very slugish. So I discontinued taking all of those meds for about 3 years. When I was 13 i started to take them on and off until i was in college. My freshman year I started to take them a little bit more_ once i was in my sophmore year i was taking them every day. I would stay awake for 3 days at a time with no difficulty what so ever. After about a year of that I got very burned out I was taking up 160mg XR a day. I never sorted my adderall I always opened up the caps and empty them into my mouth. I then would follow it with five caps of Stacker 2's to ENHANCE THE rush. Then I started to use smokeless tobacco which really got me going because the nicotine and adderall used in conjuction are some how complemented by each other. So when ever i took adderall I would chew about maybe two cans on of kodiak wintergreen in a givin day. Now I am 23 years old and i am back on the recomended dosage 60mg a day. I have to say adderall is a drug that should be watched very carefully because if its abused than you will have so many problems to deal with. The only problem with adderall i have to say is that i dont remember what my personality was like when i didnt take it. I forgot who i used to be?? My life is centered around that drug because i wouldnt have any idea who i was if i didnt take it any more. Don't get me wrong I love the drug because it has helped me get a 3.2 GPA with a bachelors degree. But if i didnt have that drug tomorrow i would nt be able to get out of bed! Its very hard to explain!,M,23,15  years,5/27/2005Email,Adderall 10
742, 3, ADD,loss of weight (no appetite)_ dry mouth_ horrible taste_ insomnia_ loss of personality_ nervousness_ extremely self conscious,(25 mg) I raised my grades from D's to A+'s but now i noticed im loosing weight (started off as 102 pounds now i weight 91 pounds) and my personality just went away. I used to enjoy hanging out or talking with friends but now i focus on grades too much rather than friends. Also_ im extremely self-conscious and nervous about everything.something that i also experience is a horrible (and i mean extremely nasty) taste in my mouth_ followed by drymouth. The last thing is insomnia_ when im up_ im tired and i want to go to bed_ but when im in my bed i cant fall asleep until 1:30ish AM. Overall: Adderall is good gradewise but i'd rather have my old personality back so i'd want to be with friends as opposed to getting A's...my doctor wont change the drug so ill quit_ having friends_ good health_ and a personality is better than getting good grades. if anyone has any of these symptoms and got over them (or didnt) email me at (badger_958@hotmail.com) thanks.,M,13,3  months,5/20/2005Email,Adderall 10

Increase in energy_ concentration_ and motivation are awesome_ but when it interferes with sleep it sucks. Sometimes I become fixated on things that are unimportant_ and this keeps from getting important things done. For the most part_ I love the drug_ but I'm afraid to try taking a break from it because I might discover that I'm addicted to it. The high probability for dependency scares me a lot.

Lexapo increases the effectiveness of Adderall for me and has the fewest sexual side effects.  You will find any reason to take more.  But isn't always worth it_ instead find ways to improve yourself w/o more.  Adderal has intensified_ so many fights and makes you feel invincible and naked at the same time.  Most drugs are either up or down this is both.  I am able to accept myself_ because I am no longer restrained by slow mental processing.  Please don't ruin the reputation of this pharmacuatical.  It was used in wars for a reason_ I think even JFK took it to fight the side effects of Addisons disease.  Don't take more if you are sad or angry or you will hurt everyone you love_ including yourself.
