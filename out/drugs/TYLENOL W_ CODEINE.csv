7, 3, migraine headaches,-Itchy skin and scalp-irritable-addictive-variating effectiveness-difficulty concentrating-nausea-after headaches *I have been taking them on and off for many years. If I take two at the first sign of a migraine it dulls it down to tolerable but does not rid them completely. I have also found that one day it will help my headache and another occasion it won't do anything. Then on another occasion it makes me very intoxicated when its begining to work. So much that ive had to stop everything to just lay there like a teenage stoner. It also takes 30 mins to work and weara off well before 4hrs. Highly addictive as well. It takes a reaponsible person to realize this when using them. I also experience a lot of itchy skin and scalp.,,F,26,10  years,3/18/2013Email,Tylenol w/ codeine

11, 3, Infected Wisdom Tooth,mild itching. Cotton mouth after day 1. White tongue,Not for anyone in real pain. Unless you go over the recommended amount_ your not going to be seeing a very good result of complete pain removal. I'm taking the correct amount_ take about 30 min to kick in and the peak only lasts about 20 min. Just using it when the pain is to much to mentally deal with.,M,22,4  dayst3 4X D,7/16/2011,Tylenol w/ codeine
12, 2, Sore throat due to mono,Itchy_ itchy scalp,This medication didn't relieve my sore throat. Sugar pills would givin me the mind power to fight the pain.

21, 3, back surgery_ foot pain,Blurry vision at times_ sometimes itchy all over_ drowsiness,This is a pain drug with fewer negative side effects than most_ and it helps with moderate pain_ especially initially. I feel relief within about a half hour of taking a dose. However_ I am noticing that the effect_ after taking for 30 days (2-4 tablets a day) is lessening_ meaning that relief isn't lasting as long in between doses. It was about 8 hours of relief_ then 6_ now_ only about 4 hours. I am supposed to be weaning off_ and was just taking 2 a day. . .now I am up to the max of 4. So now what?,F,50,30  days,9/18/2008,Tylenol w/ codeine
22, 5, Shoulder tendonitus,Drowsiness.  Dry mouth_ although that may have been caused by the Naprosyn and Flexeril I was also taking.,"It seemed to work really fast and well for my severe pain.  In order to do the home exercises_ along with physical therapy_ I had to take these medications to get through the pain.  If I didn't do the exercises_ I'd have lost some range of motion in my shoulder.  This seemed better than Vicodin_ which gives me some queasiness and dizziness.    I think I took it about 2 weeks_ but I don't remember the dosage.  It wasn't daily_ but on a ""as needed"" basis.  Sometimes the pain was moderate_ and in that case_ the Naprosyn worked.  I was taking that daily.",F,46,2  weeks,5/24/2008,Tylenol w/ codeine

24, 2, Lower Back Pain,Dizzyness_ nausea_ Itchy Nose (doctor said not a side effect. Hah.) Dry Mouth_  Sucks the moisture out of your body_ Constipation.  Sleeplessness,No noticeable major relief_ possible that it took the edge off.  You need to drink major amounts of water when taking this med and carry a water bottle with you or you could get dizzy and or have nausea.  This is not for headaches or minor pain.  Only for deep pain I think.  I only took it when pain became unbearable.  Needed to take valium to get to sleep when taken late in the day.,M,41,6  years,4/25/2007,Tylenol w/ codeine

26, 3, IT band injury from running,The medication worked excellent for my knee pain. It was a big relief from my pain.  But the side effects were not worth it.

My stomache has bee extremly bloated every since ( a lot of trips to the bathroom ) very tired_ I slept for pretty much the first two days. Every musle in my body still completly aches.
