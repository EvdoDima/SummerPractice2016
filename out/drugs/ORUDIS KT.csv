0, 4, Fibromyalgia,constipation_ acid reflux,All in all_ Orudis (ketoprofen) seems to help with chronic pain_ but as another patient mentioned_ it seems to be less effective the longer you take it.  The only real problems I've had with it are bouts of being painfully constipated & acid reflux if I don't remain completely upright for 30 minutes (no bending over allowed).,F,31,3  years,11/30/2005,Orudis kt
