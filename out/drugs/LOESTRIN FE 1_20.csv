0, 1, Birth control,Huge mood swings_ nausea_ digestive problems_ exhaustion_ breakthrough bleeding_ increased heart rate_ problems sleeping and anxiety.,I went on this pill as I have a copper coil which has dislodged and I am currently waiting for safe removal and possible re-insertion.On day 2 of taking this pill I started experiencing side effects - mood swings and irritability much like PMS but intensified and much harder to regulate. I am usually very stable_ happy_ and positive but building across the 6 days of taking this pill I experienced huge periods of anxiety_ irrational panic and stomach/throat-clenching fear in response to usually normal and day to day issues. On top of this I have felt a massive dip in my sex drive.I was amazed that I could have had such a strong reaction to it in just 6 days but reading all of these comments have made me feel a million times better. My partner has been amazingly supportive and I'm just going to come off it right away - I am just hoping it doesn't take too long for the hormones to leave my system. This has been really scary for me - I haven't felt like myself for a week_ and struggled with moments of total terror and an inability to relax or feel normal. I have never had mental health problems before but I have felt like I've been sharing headspace with a completely different person for the last few days. It's been horrible.,F,25,6  days 1X D,8/10/2016,Loestrin fe 1/20
1, 1, Period regulation,Depression_ extreme mood swings_ Suicidal thoughts,I have taken loestrin for 1 month and I have had suicidal thoughts and depression after the first week.

My period was very irregular before I started loesterin fe (3 weeks straight_ cramping the whole time). It stopped when I started taking loestrin. When it was time for my period again_ it came back as expected. Although this time it came back for 8 weeks. Along with this_ I didn't want to have sex_ or even be touched. I had mood swings. I've been off of this medicine for 3 months and everything is backnowledge to normal other than having stretch marks.,F,19,2  months,6/12/2016,Loestrin fe 1/20

But since i started this pill_  I've felt so depressed_  weepy and been having suicidal thoughts.  I asked my sister if she thought I'd been more depressed in the last month and she said ""definitely - you're not yourself at all - this isn't you"".

5, 1, ease cramps and lighten period.,I had to be put on blood pressure medication as a result of high blood pressure from this pill. I also have spells where my vision will turn to like a strobe light_ flashing lights with flashing lines and dots_ which ends up causing a migraine. I went to 3 different doctors and had 2 friends I talked with_ who had similar side effects from this pill. I have been on the pill for a little over a year and have gained 15 lbs since starting this pill due to increased appetite and lack of motivation. I also have spells of depression.,I called my doctor and will be switching to IUD next week at my appointment_ the side effects of this pill are too much to handle for me.

9, 1, Birth control,I wouldn't recommend this pill to anyone. It made me gain weight_ lose my sex drive and become depressed. After I stopped taking it my menstrual cycle wasn't the same.

10, 1, birth control,Dry scalp_ dry eyes_ hair loss_ weight gain,Ugh this pill is awful! I have almost bald patches in my scalp_ fortunately my hair is curly and I can disguise them but I can't wear my hair up because the right side of my head is almost bald. About a month into taking the pill my scalp became very dry_itchy and it burned! There were huge flakes and scales I was literally making my scalp bleed from scratching it. Then I noticed that my eyes were really dry and eye drops didn't help_ woke up with red puffy eyes and they had started to scale. It was awful! Went thru a dose of prednisone and my eyes cleared up but the scalp itch persisted. At the time I didn't realize it was the pill causing all of this (dummy me)_ but after doing some good ole Googling I've read so many similar experiences with this pill. I've stopped taking it mid July and I'm feeling better now_ this is the first day my scalp feels normal (my doc prescribed Ketoconazole 2%_ 2x per week and I'm on my 5th week using it) and I am thrilled.

The only thing this pill helped was make it where my period lasts about 2-3 days. But_ they are even more painful than before! My breasts have been swollen and hurt like they've been punched over and over. Hurts for my bra to even press against them. I have became a nervous wreck with insane moods swings. I can get easily angered into a rage! I also will cry so hard for no reason. I'm severely depressed and so sad. I don't even wanna get out of bed. I've had suicidal thoughts which is just not normal for me! This pill has messed me up!! I don't recommend it but everyone's does react differently.

17, 2, BC,PROS: lighter period; I normally have completely debilitating cramps the first day of my period_ and I will admit that this pill reduced it significantly. My period length also went from 6 days to barely 3. The first month of use_ I also felt an increase in energy and overall good mood.CONS: Once I began the second pack_ everything was the complete opposite.- Anxiety - Panic attacks in the middle of the night and waking up- Constant self-doubt- Either feeling extremely lethargic or extremely emotional- Uncontrollable/Inexplicable crying almost every day- Feeling a complete loss of control - Blotchy skin- Breast tenderness,My doctor did recommend that I use it for 3-4 months before making a decision_ but between school_ work_ and everything else_ I cannot ignore the severe emotional side effects of this pill. Of course_ everyone's body may react differently. After a couple tries_ I don't believe that hormonal birth control is for me_ and am not intent on experimenting with it.,F,19,2  months1x/Day,2/22/2015Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

That went away after first month.  After a few weeks_ I was always hungry and by the second month I was very tired all of the time.  I also got headaches which are not normal for me.  The final straw was two days of heavy_ uncontrolled bleeding.  Came out of nowhere.  Left a puddle of blood on a chair!,,F,47,60  days 1X D,2/21/2015,Loestrin fe 1/20
20, 1, endometriosis issues,anxiety_ strange thoughts_ depression_ overwhelming sense of despair & hopelessness_ empty_ alone_ sad_ discouraged_ disheartened_ mild heart pain_ trouble sleeping,"I feel compelled to include my experience & comments.  I have taken this pill for exactly a month and I stopped because the negative side effects are severe enough for me to cease.  I would jump out of bed in the middle of the night (which is anxiety)_ have bizarre vivid dreams_ night sweats.  And that's just nighttime.  As far as the days went_ they were were worse.  I felt hopeless_ sad_ simply lethargic and even anxious.  I would not write here on this website not to take this pill because I truly believe every woman's body will react differently to almost any medication.  Unfortunately_ we all have to give things a try because we may have a better quality of life.  This pill does not work well for me_ there is no doubt in my mind that it played ""tricks"" on my mental well being. I am generally a very outgoing_ happy Mom and teacher and wife.  I found it hard to get out of bed_ almost daily_ it killed sex drive and did ""dry"" me out.  I felt foggy and sad_ very uncharacteristic for me.  I am so happy to be done with this pill.  Anyone reading this_ I wish you well in your search for relief_ birth control and/or pain management.  Keep your patience and faith that something will work_ you just have to jump through some hoops sometimes as much as it sucks_ it's true.  This pill doesn't work for me and so many others_ but some people have had positive experiences.  But if you or your loved ones notice a distinct change in you_ reevaluate your situation.",F,43,30  days 1X D,1/25/2015,Loestrin fe 1/20

Starting the 3rd month i started getting anxiety and pmsig very bad. I would cry for no reason right before my period and got terrible cramps which i normally never get. And now_ on month 4_ i can honestly say im depressed. As a 19year old i have a pretty damn good life but i feel so low now all the time. Its a feeling i cant describe_ its not me and so scary to think im depressed. I cry for no reason all night and cant sleep. I lash out at everyone and the thought of getting out of bed and seeing friends feels overwhelming and not enjoyable. I cant stay on this any more. I want my old self back.

24, 1, Change in cycle_ hormonal issues,Non-stop bleeding!  Anger_ irritability_ anxiety_ depression. Cystic acne.,I have 1 more pill to take and I'm calling my doctor tomorrow.  I have been bleeding non-stop_ with a brief halt for about 24 hours for the entire month!  My fiance passed away about 21 months ago and my body and monthly cycle have been affected due to my depression and the lack of taking care of myself properly.  I have been in therapy for a year now and have generally been feeling better about life once again and decided to start to taking care of myself once again.  My skin has had issues since he passed and my cycle became irregular so I decided to try the pill once again....also hopeful that the hormones would help my mood as well.   This has been an awful month.....non-stop bleeding_ my skin has broken out into cystic acne and I thought I was going crazy until I read other reviews_ but my mood has worsened dramatically.  I have become very argumentative_ irritable_ angry.  I actually thought about quiting my job (the same one I've been at for 7+ years and actually enjoy) had  a panic attack while at work as well.  I've been dealing with my depression through therapy and have never taken anti-depressants and have been doing well for some time now and the past few weeks I feel like I'm back to the beginning again.  Crying hysterically to point where I have to talk myself into calming down so that I can get ready for work_ or walk the dog even!

28, 1, Contraception,Uncontrollable anger_ severe mood swings_ anxiety_ paranoia_ vaginal dryness_ loss of sex drive,This is the worst pill ever! I started taking Loestrin for contraception after having my second child. I became easily agitated and as soon as I started stressing it would feel as though my blood was boiling and I couldn't calm down. With a two year old and a newborn I was often stressed trying to get other things done but It was the utter rage I felt about everything that frightened me. If 2yo asked for something I would get angry and shout at her to wait_ then my heart would beat so fast and the only way I could get a release was to punch something or swear profusely. This happened all day long. I would also b ratty with my husband and constantly snap for every little thing_ i had no interest in sex_ and still dont_ and began to get paranoid that he and all my friends didnt actually care about me. I became so depressed and anxious I lost all my confidence and felt I was rubbish as a wife and mum_ I wanted to run away and leave them all. I thought I had post natal depression but was too scared to go to my doctors incase they feared for the safety of my children - in turn I never went to get my next prescription for Loestrin. I am so thankful for this. I instantly started feeling better. Within a week my husband said I was like a different person. I began to sing to myself while bathing my baby (something I hadn't done before) and felt I could cope better when things weren't going to plan.

32, 1, for dysmenorrhea,Almost immediately after taking lo estrin_ my libido started to decline_ after about a year and a half_ I completely lost my libido and ability to orgasm. A few months later I switched to lo loestrin and stayed on that for 3 months. I saw no difference in my sex drive or ability to orgasm so I decided to stop birth control pulls altogether. It's been 10 months since I stopped_ and I still have no libido and anorgasmia. I have a super healthy relationship with my husband - we are crazy about each other and he is very supportive and understanding. I have no unusual stresses in my life_ I eat healthy and get enough sleep. I also want to note that I have not been hard on myself for this_ I've really tried to stay positive and tell myself that it will take time to come back. I know stressing over my lack of sex drive will do no good! I spoke to my gyn and she said it is not from loestrin and recommended I see a sex therapist to find out what's going on. I am extremely frustrated that she would write off birth control's responsibility for this so quickly. I will take her advice and see the therapist because I will do anything at this point to fix it_ however I have a hard time believing loestrin did not cause the problem. To say I regret taking loestrin is an understatement. I would take the worst cases of dysmenorrhea any day over a long term anorgasmia & loss of libido. Before loestrin_ I used to be able to orgasm doing sit-ups! Please think twice about taking loestrin,,F,26,2  years,10/25/2014,Loestrin fe 1/20

I have an appointment with my doctor this week and I can't wait to have her get me off of this drug. From reading the other reviews_ it all makes complete sense to me.

I started at 17_ it was the first birth control that I was put on and for an entire year it was the worst experience ever. The worst thing was the fact that my period was on 20/30 days of the month. It would come on the second week of the pills and last all the way to the end of the brown pills. I was moody_ depressed_ anxious and bloated A LOT. I don't know if the emotional issues was due to the birth control or PMS since I was bleeding all the time due to the pills. The period's were very painful too_ and heavy. The only thing that it helped with was acne. Now I'm on Trinessa (generic for ortho tri cyclen-lo) and I'm hoping it'll be better.,F,18,1  years 1X D,5/22/2014,Loestrin fe 1/20

The first side effect I noticed was the vaginal dryness. Sex became uncomfortable immediately. This worsened until sometimes it was just unprovoked pain. Thenthe boobs. As a B cup I though ""oh wow nice."" I went up to a full C in weeks and they look super perky. Unfortunately this was accompanied by a 15 lb increase in weight and a huge belly. I did not change my diet or fitness routine and yet my body completely changed. I honestly look like I AM pregnant. On month three I went from having perfect skin to having the worst acne imaginable. The cystic acne is flakey and persistant. ALL OVER MY CHIN. All of those symptoms made me miserable. 1 week afar stopping everything started to go back to normal.

52, 5, Birgh control,OKAY_ GILDESS FE IS NOT THR SAME AS LOESTRIN! no matter what the stupid companies tell you. I was on loestrin_ switched to godless when it was discontinued. My body freaked out right away. Bad. I got cystic acne all over my chinn and forehead. From the moment I took it I never had a clear face. One pimple would leave and two more giants would appear. I was so moody and hated the world. Mostly my boyfriend. I went to a new doctor and she said it was NOT me and 100% the pill. She said she had heard this from multiple women and to stop taking it. She switched me to yaz and my skin stopped breaking out within a week. I am waiting to have an iud put in to end all this shit. IUDs are becoming more known as a safe and NORMAL option for women who haven't had kids yet. They are safe effective and release so little hormone that they don't make you a lunatic.

(have to order 34g Wacoal bras from macys online). Also went from a size 4 to a size 8 jean_ but I only gained 4 pounds. Feel hungry all the time.

It did exactly the opposite. I have a history of depression and have been taking Prozac since I was 8. Overall though_ I am normally a very bright_ awake_ optimistic and grounded person. This pill has brought out the person I was when I was 8. I go to sleep so early at night (which is incredibly rare for me) and wake up feeling worse than when I went to sleep. I'm constantly tired_ constantly dizzy_ and always feeling ill. My arm will go numb at random points in the day and my mood swings are out of this world. I cry at least once a day_ have on average three panic attacks a week and cannot focus at all_ which has also produced anxiety. My school work has dropped considerably and I've missed more school in the past month than ever before. I  My friends are seriously worried about me and have noticed the change in me. I do not recommend this pill for anyone who has a history of depression or anxiety. I am stopping this pill in the next two days because that's when this month's dosage will end and I'm counting down the seconds. This has been one of the worst months ever.

Granted_ I am going through a stressful time in my life and would consider myself somewhat prone to anxiety pre-pill but NOT LIKE THIS. since starting this I have fallen into uncontrollable anxiety_ fear and depression. I feel down all the time_ in the past my anxiety was limited to things that well_ make sense (health issues_ work_ etc.) but on a beautiful sunny day I feel like I am LOSING MY MIND. seriously_ earlier today I was practically convincing myself I was going to become schizophrenic and lose my family and boyfriend until I found this stuff. Omg. I think I am going to wait it out the one week I have left of active pills so I don't mess up my cycle too badly but that is it. This stuff is the devil. I have been resorting to xanax the past week because I have hardly been able to function..just crying for no reason and plagued by massive 'worst case scenario' routines running through my mind.  Honestly_ unlike some of you I do have a history of worry and anxiety but not to this extent. Honestly_ I have never felt worse..and I have to say..about hormonal birth control in general..it makes sense that this stuff occurs...synthetic hormones inhibiting your body's ability to make its own..no wonder we're all such a wreck and divorce rate is so high.

I was pretty happy with YAZ until my doctor heard about some of the increased risk for blood clots and refused to prescribe it any longer. The minute I switched to Loestrin FE_ my period disappeared and I lost weight rapidly. I went to the doctor for a full checkup because I didn't immediately connect that with the new pill. After realizing I was healthy_ I stayed on the pill for two years until the complete absence of a period began to make me and my husband nervous. So.... my doctor was going to switch me back to Ortho-Tricyclin Lo_ but there's no generic_ so I had to take Trinessa (regular ortho generic instead). And Trinessa has been miserable. My insane mood swings_ depression_ and anxiety as returned_ my periods are all over the place. I gained weight and retain water. I want to go back to Loestrin.

On top of that I am usually a really upbeat person but a few days after starting this BCP I wanted to kill myself and everyone around me.  I was crying at least 3 times a day and when I wasn't crying I was cussing my fiance out over the stupidest things and my kids were barely around me because I was afraid of what I might do to them.  Then I was always paranoid_ at the slightest sound I thought someone had broken in and was about to kill me.  A bad trait for an armed security guard to have because I could have accidently shot an employee who came into the building over night to redecorate their office. (That actually almost happened because I was so paranoid.  Finally_ I was having vaginal dryness and I had a period basically all month long (I went through 3 boxes of tampons and 2 boxes of pads in one month). The only time the bleeding stopped was the week I was supposed to have a period!  How ironic is that?  Plus I had the worst cramps I had ever experienced everyday while on the pill.

After that she started saying her eyes felt weird_ and her arm felt weird (kinda numb).  Then it was heart palpitations_ insomnia_ and high anxiety.  Of course the doctor told us probably not from the pill because she tolerated it for 6 months but I think it took that long for her body to adjust to the drug.  A trip to emergency_ countless calls to doctors_ visit to an opthomologist_ cardiologist_ and a psychologist_ I am just so thankful that we found this website.

Within the few days I started taking it I had rapid heart beat and achy legs. The next week I was depressed and crying. They took me off of that pill and switched me to Loestrin FE 1/20 thinking that the higher dose would balance it all out. The rapid heart beat stopped and so did the achy legs...but I have never been so down and depressed in all my life. I am currently planning my wedding to the man of my dreams and love of my life and I have been unhappy the whole time and have cried ever since I have taken this pill. I have not been able to enjoy all the little things I have planned for my wedding because of the depression. A feeling of hopelessness that never ends. The depression is so deep that I have even had thoughts of suicide. I am currently 4 days off of the pill and am already feeling myself again. For the first time in 3 months I haven't cried.

I went from 160 lbs (which I was on Mircette before for 10 years) to 200 lbs in a year and a half. I craved everything. My husband was ready to kill me because I had ZERO sex drive. Even though I had the cravings I was able to eat the correct amount of calories....AND IT DIDN'T MATTER. The pill messed me up so bad I stopped having periods until I would show up at my gyno exam!!!! I didn't realize the pill was making me depressed but it was. I feel 10000000% better and the doctor will have to pay me before I go an ANY Birth control ever again. This drug needs to be checked again. Too many issues just not worth it!!!

120, 1, To help regulate period,The first month that I took this medicine_ I felt very sick to my stomach. Cramping all the time_ bleeding for 2 weeks before my period which was very intense. I was told by my OB that the first 3 months would be the worst...He was right_ however it was bad months after that! I felt sick all the time_ Nausea all the time...I would have food and it would smell like cow poop. Severe mood swings. Feeling anxtious all the time. Feeling like someone was sitting on my chest because it felt so heavy. I gained almost 10 pounds in the 5 months I was on this pill...,I stopped taking this medicine 3 days ago. I was starting to feel these little flutters in my heart when I would do activities. I am now worried about everything_ thinking I am going to die...thinking that my family members are going to die...I had to get off of this medicine and I would NEVER recommend this meds to anyone! It did nothing but mess me up! I am so glad to see that some other people are having the same things going on that I did. I just hope that I will soon feel better_ Im starting to feel less anxtious but cant wait to feel like ME again! Is anyone else experiancing the flutter thing? My OB said no_ this couldn't be a side affect but I didnt have them before I started taking this meds. My blood pressure went sky high. It was 160/90 and pulse rate was high...Now after being off of it_ It is only high after doing an activity. But back to a resting number of 124/88.

I got off of Yasmin once my periods became too heavy and messy. I was put on Loestrin 24 for a few months until I realized I would have to pay $25 month compared to paying $0 a month while on Yasmin. I then switched to Loestrin fe 1/20 two months ago. I now have stretch marks under my breasts_ severe anxiety_ panic attacks_ depression_ headaches_ dizziness. The mental issues are so unlike me and it scared the living crap out of me because I've never had these issues before. The dizziness started just last week_ the week before my period. I'm now in the week of my period and it has pretty much been non existent. The headaches often consist of a sense of fogginess/cloudiness in my head. I don't know how else to describe it.

I am so on edge and am so tired all the time. I have the most wonderfully wonderful boyfriend and he has been walking on eggshells cause I have been so moody. Probably the worse and most noticeable side effect is loss of libido. My sex drive was very healthy until the last few weeks and now its completely gone. I will not take another one of these pills and I hope that things get back to normal really soon. It's horrible not feeling like myself and feeling like I have no control.

151, 1, birth control,The very first week or two I took loestrin I had some side effects. Random cramps and really long periods. I also felt really tired all of the time but I blamed it on my very active and stressful lifestyle. I knew there would probably be side effects for the first 2-3 weeks just because my body needed to get used to it. The cramping stopped after 2 weeks but I noticed that all of the sudden my view on life was very negative. I've always been known for my bubbly and happy personlaity. I am an optimist by nature. Over the past 2 months_ I began to hate my job_ my school_ the people I hung out with and on top of that felt extremely depressed all of the time. I once again blamed it on stress. Maybe I had finally hit the breaking point of what I could handle mentally and physically. I work 40 hrs a wk plus full time job and other activities. Well_ let's just say the last 2 months have been close to the worst ever in my life. Everyone I've talked to swears that bc should not have such a toll on you. Whether or not it should. I have no idea. But I do know that the very next day after I stopped taking the loestrin. I was able to function again. I would never reccomend this to anyone.,,F,22,2  months,11/28/2011,Loestrin fe 1/20

As the days went by I had horrible headaches daily_ felt like I was waking up with a hangover (would try to vomit and couldn't_ felt so sick)_ extreme depression - crying_ anger_ very bad thoughts_ mood swings (snapping at some of the nicest people in my life for no reason; very easily annoyed over things that would never annoy me normally)_ bad cramps (never had cramps on ortho).

We NEVER fought before married_ I was happy and carefree...ITS the BC! I started plotting on a calendar when we fought and when I was blue and when I cried and sure enough_ theres a monthly ongoing pattern. Maybe my hormones have changed now that Im close to 39 and its just no longer useful.. but I sit here at work_ unable to concentrate_ crying about nothing and obsessing over my relationship.

162, 1, As a contraceptive.,I started taking this drug in Sep of 2009. I recently stopped on Oct 16_ 2011. This pill created abdominal pain that has come and gone over the past two years. I did no think that the birth control could be a cause of the pain_ but after reading the comments I believe it was definitely a contributing factor. I had yeast infections an UTIs that were very painful. I have now switched to another birth control.,I would not recommend this birth control.

Over the last several days I have completely unraveled.

THIS PILL IS RUINING MY LIFE!!!  It has made me EXTREMLY depressed.  It has given me the inability to feel joy or happy_ It has given me anxiety_ constant bladder infections_ headaches_ mood swings_ makes me cry over dumb stuff_ I cant focus_ It has made me feel very needy and just constant unhappiness.

Then_ after my period happened_ she instructed me to take Loestrin. I asked her about depression side effects of the medroxypr_ because I had just started college and was feeling especially lonely and isolated. She said that depression side effects don't happen on it_ so I thought it was just me. I started taking the Loestrin_ and my depression worsened. I would wake up crying for no reason_ break down and cry during the day for no reason_ feel isolated and alone_ had suicidal thoughts_ especially in the morning. I could not concentrate on any of my schoolwork and all of the things that made me happy did nothing for me. It was just a blur of constant sadness and perpetual incurable boredom; I constantly had thoughts about hurting myself or killing myself. Complete loss of appetite as well.

I feel like a completely different person. No depression_ no UTIs_ my libido is back & have not had the hair loss. My coloring in my face has even returned to normal. Its like this pill sucked the life right out of me. Honestly I have had issues with a lot of pills_ but this one was the worst. I really believe that I would have been better off getting pregnant or using condoms! Suicidal thoughts_ my mental & physical health are more important to me. Im sure a lot of perscription drugs cause more problems that they do good. You shouldnt have to take something to counter act something else you are taking. Very sad.

It has made it shorter and instead instead of suffering for a month or more on one period....it lasted a week and a half. I have lost a significant amount of weight in the 2 months on the BC without trying!(more than 30 lbs!)

I have been on it for three months knowing that birth control takes at least that long to begin to regulate and am glad to see everyone else's comments and know that I am not the only one.  I also have never missed a period before and only got a little very light spotting when I should have had my last one which did not help my already anxious state.  I also have been having paralyzing panic attacks which never happened before and especially for little to no reason.  It is regulating my period and keeping me from bleeding all the time but the other extreme_ never bleeding_ is almost worse when all the other symptoms are added in.

Now for the bad stuff..ive never had bad acne 1 or 2 pimples every so often thats it..now im starting to have horrible acne. I have also gained some weight..i have always maintained my weight. I have been having some sharp pains in my abdomin area. My back_ shoulders an legs have been killing me. I feel like a completly different person!!!

176, 1, birth control,Dramatic weight gain_ edema_ depression/anger_ swollen breasts_ hair loss_ loss of sex drive_ breakthrough bleeding,After 10 years with no side effects on Ortho Tri cyclen I stopped to have another baby.  After she was born I attempted to go back on the pill and tried about three before giving up; all made me angry_ even my old reliable Ortho Tri.  But now it's been four years_ of condoms_ and I thought I'd try the pill once more.  I'm so glad I found all of your comments because it definitely confirmed that I need to stop taking this pill.  My doctor recommended it because of my age_ but it really seems much more detrimental than a higher estrogen variety.   The weight gain alone is incredibly discouraging.  I'm usually very careful about what I eat and not often hungry_ but I've been ravenous and unable to talk myself out of eating everything in sight.  I've (no lie) gained 12 pounds in 3 weeks.  I think much of this is water_ but I blame the pill for that too.  I'm also irritated by every thing my husband and kids say or do.  I'm shedding hair everywhere and my skin is breaking out.  All in all I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this pill except that having larger breasts is nice and at least I'm not pregnant (although I've also not had sex since I started on the pill because I have zero sex drive and frequent breakthrough bleeding).

I was able to tolerate the drug for about 5 days_ but then stopped them immediately when I became inconsolable. It's almost like my body went into a physical state of grief: I was crying uncontrollably (sobbing)_ I had numerous panic attacks and severe paranoia.

By the end of the first week I called my Dr to complain_ he said my symptoms were normal and would go away after 2weeks. Bull. The dizziness got so bad it was if I was permanently drunk_ it was difficult standing_ walking_ pretty much any movement was difficult. I was very faint_ in pain_ couldn't breathe_ and overall just very ill. Not to mention the psychotic mood swings. After 2months I said stuff it.

It didn't help much. The thing is_ my feet have been hurting more and more each day_ and today when I woke up they hurt worse than when I had gone to bed. This is not normal. I threw the pills away! I refuse to live like this. I'd rather have a monthly heavy period than go through daily pain like this. I've also been feeling lower back pain as if I had a kidney infection_ and fatigue and slight depression. This pill is the only thing that I can account for the sudden physical changes in my body. I'm not a big fan of taking pills anyway_ but I thought it would be great if I could stop the heavy cramping and bleeding. I'm still bleeding_ too_ by the way_ so that hasn't even let up. I think I'll stick with the natural way.,F,46,5  days1 mg 1X D,4/14/2011Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

But the side effects from these BCP's is really making me have second thoughts. Right now I am in the exploritory stage to treat the pain.  The last resort is lap surgery. The pain can be so bad that I wish someone would just put me out of my misery.  The treatments I have undergone have helped with the pain_ but it has come at price.  I previously tried these BCP's two years ago_ and they didn't affect me the way they are now_ actually they did nothing for me. I gained 12 pounds after having Lupron injections. Then lost 30 pounds two months after the shot left my system.  my appetite decreased tremendously and I had loads of energy to work out_ grant it_ while the shot was in my system_ I was pain free_ but the price I paid was sever weight gain and in such a short amount of time and some bone loss.  I am now back on the Loestrin and it has really reaked havoc on my body.  I have gained nearly 20 pound in the first two months of using it.  I work out_ but it seems as if it isn't helping.

209, 1, BC,"Women should be aware there are 3 generic formulations of Loestrin FE 1/20.  They are made by three different pharma's.  They are NOT alike.  I used the Microgestin version for years without major issues.  Recently I was forced to use mail-order Medco.  They sell the Gildess FE brand.   I'm also an insulin-dependent diabetic of >34 years.  I am very tightly controlled.  So ... when I started having uncontrollable insulin resistance at night (very contrary to the Microgestin version which causes a few hours of MILD insulin resistance mid-day but only for the first few days)_ I did a test.  Don't take it one night (this past Saturday).  What happened?  Normal insulin sensitivity returned.  Start pill again yesterday - nighttime major nighttime insulin resistance.  I called Medco. I have to get a ""do not substitute"" prescription to get the Microgestin version again.

This pill has caused me to become a fragile person that I have never been before. I have gained ten pounds_ I have had anxiety attacks_ I have been depressed. Microgestin has stolen 7 months from me_ and I will not stop speaking out against it. I have fibrous tissue in my breasts_ genetically_ and the condition has been aggravated by this pill. My breasts are sore and FILLED with tumors. This pill does react differently within different people_ but it amazes me that the FDA would allow such a poisonous drug to be sold to people who have no idea the extent that they will suffer for it.

How I wish I'd thought that some of my problems years ago may have been pill related... I have been absolutely AWFUL to my boyfriend this month. It just seems to affect how I react to things.. Things that may bother me a little but I usually let go have now been blown out of all proportion culminating in me being very down and behaving like a spoilt brat but I just CAN'T drag myself out of it... Fine with everyone else - just my boyfriend... At this rate I won't need contraception because he'll have buggered off anyway! (thankfully_ he has been seriously understanding) I have stopped taking this - after my boyfriend threw them away - and the RELIEF I feel is unbelieveable. It's not great but we'll just have to think of another way to deal with contraception. I'm sure I'll still experience normal moods but I will be able to deal with them and keep them in perspective.

My sex drive is gone which seems so crazy to me since the reason to be on this is to have lots of sex! I guess I am going to try another brand of pill though during my research today I have little hope there is any out there that's any better.

237, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,I am taking the generic microgestin. I thought I was going crazy until I read all of these side effects others were dealing with also. I was finding myself crying all the time_ freaking out and being irratated by everyone. I remember being completely fine and telling my boyfriend I just felt like crying and continously apologizing for how I was acting and saying this just wasn't me. I am 20yr old and constantly feel anxiety and even thoughts of wanting to kill myself. I told my mom about this and how I was feeling. My moods would change like that and I would being yelling at anyone. I've never been this hateful to people and would always be apologizing.

I tried to stick with it_ but in the last 4 days_ I have been in such an exhausted_ zombie- like state that I have ENDED this HORRIFIC MEDICATION!  I have stayed in bed the last 2 days due to utter exhaustion. I have alternating moments of being totally spaced out and then wanting to cry.

241, 1, birth control,Severe migraine headaches_ mood swings_ anxiety_ frustration_ vision problems.,"I took this medicine for about a year I started to have really bad  headaches and were told that they were migraine but did not associate it with the pills. My attitude changed where you could say ""hi"" and get your head bitten off. Eventually I started to have vision problems along with the headaches. I became pregnant while on the pill and was unaware. I was 6 weeks pregnant when I got a positive. At eight weeks I had a stroke due to blood clots. I was told the blood clots were probably the cause of the headaches and the pregnancy caused things to go haywire. I am recovering from the stroke which fortunately was a venous stroke instead of arterial and in my 23 week of pregnancy.

All the other symptoms jumped on. And the fatigue went from ok maybe another hour of sleep will do it to OMG i can sleep for a month and still be tired-i even had a sleep study done! When i called my OB he did a full internal exam and the cyst was back and i had all these nasty symptoms. He determined that i had to come off this pill and infact did not put me on a  new one because he felt my body needed to fix itself after this ordeal.

During the first month and a half I had horrible anger and felt horribly irritable for no reason. I also developed a lump in my breast_ had irregular bleeding and awful stomach pain. I started taking this pill at the end of June and from July through September I felt okay. But about the second week in October I began to get very depressed. I would start thinking about my boyfriend's past relationships and it would emotionally kill me_ but I just can't get those thoughts out of my head_ no matter how hard I try. It has gotten progessively worse because now I can't sleep_ I cry all the time for no reason_ I can't think rationally anymore_ and this just isn't me!! I DON'T FEEL LIKE MYSELF!

Mid-cycle each month_ got a silent migraine (visual disturbance) that scared the crap out of me. Thought there was something horribly wrong; would obsess over any anxious thought and cry endlessly.

My mom came to visit from out of state for my b-day and I wasn't even that happy to see her. This was the first week. By the second week I had SEVERE ANXIETY_ I thought I was going to die. I cried all week and called the dr's office_ my primary_ and talked to the pharmacist; they all said that the anxiety and depression was NOT a side-effect from Loestrin. How can they say that?!! Look at all these women experiencing the same things. It takes effort to log on the computer_ do our research and type out our messages. I would not be doing this if it weren't real and true. It's been so bad that I've had to take a week off of work! The medical professionals told me to stay on and finish the pack but I'm taking charge and stopping today.

This past week I was rewarded with unexplained psychotic breakdowns (and everything in my life is wonderful_ honest)_ trying to explain myself but making no sense_ having out of body experiences_ taking everything way too seriously_ and an overall complete personality change. I used to be mellow_ and was able to roll with the punches. Now I can't handle anything the least bit bad. The worst part of this is_ is that I'm conscious that I'm being crazy and irrational_ but I really FEEL like I can't control my emotions.

It was the worst decision I have ever made...I have always been a happy and very positive person...I was only on Loestrin for a little over 2 months and experienced severe mood swings_ as well as depression. I knew something wasn't right inside my body..I felt like I was losing my mind.. I was uncomfortable in my own skin..I had never been so low...I flat out FELT crazy...I destroyed a relationship with my ex_ my friends said I was acting wierd.....I even sought counsel before realizing that Loestrin 24 was the cause of many of my issues. On top of that_ I experienced extreme weight loss due to the depression because I had no desire to eat. I also had headaches_ insomnia_ and anxiety...I can't explain the relief_ but also sadness I felt when I found all of these websites and realized I am not alone in this. No one should have to go through such a drastic experience. I feel for every woman out there who has gone through this same nightmare.

I started getting really bad migraines and went to the Dr for them_ they did a CT and put me on meds for migraines.  The migraines led to me being a bit depressed and not wanting to do my normal routine_ b/c I never knew when they were going to hit.  Next I started to feel flushed in my face and I would have low blood sugar attacks_ and of course that made me have anxiety bc my sugar would drop at random times..... as soon as I read the comments from other ppl I asked my Dr if it could be my birth control causing everything and he said yes_ its very possible.  Now ONE month after being off of Loestrin Fe_ I have not had a single migraine_ and no problems with my blood sugar_ my face is clearing up and I'm getting back to my cheery self!,F,28,5  months 1X D,10/25/2010Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

I have been on probably about 4 birth controls over the past 7 years and had much more severe side effects with other pills/nuva ring.

I take the pill at the same time each day. I like it and hopefully my opinion will not change.,F,28,20  days30 1X D,9/28/2010Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

286, 5, prevent ovarian cysts,I started Loestrin in April 2009 and everything was great-I had lighter periods_ hardly any menstrual cramps_ and no more ovarian cysts.  After taking the pill about 6-7 months_ I noticed my anxiety had increased.  I become depressed and sad_ developed migraines-and one minute I would be happy_ then next upset or irritable_ and sometimes would get dizzy. I also became really emotional to the point where I would cry over anything. I didn't suspect that the pill would cause any of these symptoms_ so I kept taking it. In May 2010 I had some panic attacks and was determined that the pill was the cause of this as well as my anxiety_ mood changes_ migraines_ and dizziness. I stopped the pill later that month after taking it a full year.  Once_ I stopped the pill_ my migraines went away-and only had them occasionally.  I did get my heavier periods back and painful menstrual cramps_ but I began getting hot flashes every period cycle and only felt like my anxiety had worsened.  I feel like I am,I do not recommend this pill.,F,21,1  years24 1X D,9/14/2010,Loestrin fe 1/20
287, 1, Contraception,I am a medical student_ so I know that my experience may or may not be relevant to anyone else.  I researched this pill before deciding to take it since my previous pill Nordette gave me migraines when I started taking Strattera.  Otherwise_ I had NO problems with it.  I also took Demulen 1/35 for about 17 years with NO problems.  However_ with Loestrin_ I had an insatiable appetite and felt extremely tired right away.  I also gained about 10 pounds quickly.  After about 2 weeks_ my left leg fell asleep while I was in class. I also noticed my legs and feet would go to sleep while I was lying down sleeping.  What scared me was when my right arm fell asleep for several hours.  I stopped Loestrin that day.  I started bleeding in about 2 days_ which didn't stop for about 10 days.  It was like my body went back to what it was like BEFORE I was on the pill - heavy_ painful_ long periods.,The BCP does not affect everyone in the same way since body chemistry differs from person to person_ as do predisposing factors_ etc.  Frankly_ choosing a pill seems to be a crapshoot - all you can do is research_ educate yourself and try it and see how it works for you.  I can say with OrthoNovum 1/35_ I had migraines and I was sooo hungry on Triphasil...but Demulen 1/35 and Nordette worked for me.  My last stop is Belara_ which isn't approved for use in the US yet_ but since I live abroad_ I can try it. Right now it is only approved in Europe and Mexico.,F,39,17  days 1X D,9/10/2010,Loestrin fe 1/20
288, 5, birth control_ menstrual regulation,minimal weight gain_ back pain for first 3 months,I really think this is a fabulous birth control.  It's the first one I tried and it worked extremely well.  No pregnancies_ easy medication to take_ my periods were regulated within the first cycle or two.  The only thing I noticed was a dull aching pain in one particular spot in my back for the first 3 months I was on it.  After three months_ it went away.  Not even sure it was related to the birth control.  I maybe gained 5lbs when I first started this pill but that could easily have been more directly related to my activity level at the time.  Generally speaking_ I've been taking this pill for 9 years and have never had an issue.  My periods last three and a half quick 'n easy days_ I take my pill at approximately the same time every day so generally I have my periods timed down to the hour.  Minimal cramping_ definitely lighter flow_ very easy to manage.  Before bc I had periods that lasted 5-7 days with significantly heavy flow.  I am switching to a new birth control starting this month because in the past year I have noticed a decrease in my libido_ however I am skeptical that my birth control is involved because I've been on loestrin so long without any issues.  We shall see.  I still give this a top rating because it has served me so well without side effects for so long.,F,27,9  years 1X D,9/9/2010,Loestrin fe 1/20

My mood swings are everywhere. I go from happy to annoyed in the drop of a hat. I feel foggy and dazed all the time like I can't get with it.

Aside from the side effects I listed_ Loestrin has been great.  Instead of gaining weight_ I've actually lost four pounds after being on the pill for a month_ which_ being a 19 year old girl_ was my biggest concern.

After I started Loestrin with a combination of 300 mg of wellbutrin and 200 mg of Lamictal_ I feel great and noticable changes have been expressed to me by several people.  I would recommend this pill to any woman who suffers from major depression such as bi-polar_ or women who have mood swings often.

YEAH RIGHT. the first year i was on this pill i though i was pregnant (which probably did not help with my anxiety haha). for some reason my body just did not like the structure of when my period was supposed to be. when not on the pill i do have irregular BUT consistent periods.,F,21,1.5  years 1X D,5/7/2010,Loestrin fe 1/20

My sister has even commented on the change in me and how it is ""like clock work""  ever third week_ when I just start crying for no reason.  I feel anxious and obsessive.  I sometimes feel like I am in a fog_ and everything kind of feels surreal.  I used to be on Yasmin_ with no negative effects_ taking that for about 3-4 years.  I hope it is the birth control because I am not used to feel like this-it is really awful!  I can't wait to get off of this medication.

I wonder if people are settling for the generic version - which in my opinion is a total waste of time.  I've been taking Loestrin for years and it's been the best thing for me EVER!  I've tried them all - Yasmin_ YAZ_ Depovera_ and Ortho to name a few.  I think the worst for me was the initial adjustment where I was a little jittery_ but after that I was fine.  Never gained a pound.  All I can say is good luck finding that magical pill that works for you ladies.,F,31,5  years1/20 1X D,4/22/2010Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

330, 1, Help w/mood swings and cramping,Breast tenderness_ occasional headaches_ missed periods and BLOOD CLOT!!!,I started taking this pill when I was 21 to help with mood swings and cramping before and during periods. I was always very reluctant to take any kind of bcp because of the risk of severe side effects. I eventually started taking this one after talking with my gyno and friends of mine who have been on birth control pills for years with no problems. I figured that because of my age and being a nonsmoker I wouldn't experience any severe side effects_ but I was wrong. At first this pill was amazing!!! I had shorter periods with little to no cramping_ and I knew when my periods were going to start. Mood swings vanished (no irritability_ sadness_ fatigue_ etc.). I was myself the entire month_ and it felt great. After a couple months_ I experienced breast tenderness_ headaches (different type of pain than what I am used to) and missed periods_ but these side effects didn't bother me. I was diagnosed with a very extensive blood clot on 9/30/09. I had a sharp pain in my right side off/on for a couple of weeks. I thought it was my appendix and went to see my dr who ordered a cat scan_ and it turned out that my appendix was fine but there's a blood clot. I was told to stop taking this pill. I had to start on lovenox then switched over to coumadin for 3 months. Blood clot resolved in 12/09_ but I can never go on birth control pills again which sucks... There is no history of blood clots in my family. With any bcp be careful because your life can depend on it!!!,F,23,11  months20 1X D,4/6/2010Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
331, 3, contraceptive,Fatigue_ occasional moodiness_ yeast infections_ some anxiety_ lower sex drive_ vaginal dryness.,Most of the time Loestrin works fine for me. It is the first and only birth control I have been on and compared to most people_ I don't have many side effects. However_ some months my PMS is much worse than normal but other months it is okay. I have noticed that recently my moodiness has been a lot worse (about one year after starting the pill) but it is difficult to determine if stress from school is contributing more to that than I think. I am more anxious and tired most of the time and my sex drive has decreased. I do have constant yeast infections that can be attributed to Loestrin_ which may be a determining factor in making me switch pills. However_ I basically never have a period_ which really makes up for some of the minor side effects. Also_ I had no weight gain at all and actually unintentionally lost about 10 pounds while on this pill. I know a lot of people are dissatisfied with Loestrin but I would suggest trying it out for yourself_ at least for a couple months to see if you can handle it. My gyno did tell me that not many people she sees are able to handle it_ but those who can are all very satisfied.,F,24,1.5  years 1X D,4/4/2010,Loestrin fe 1/20

I have gained 40 POUNDS in less than a year despite diet and regular exercise.  I have never_ ever gained this amount of weight in a year.  I cry almost every night_ and until now I just attributed it to my acute anxiety getting magically worse after 19 years.  I feel guilty all the time because I have almost completely lost my sex drive.  I started getting concerned when I missed 4 periods_ and googled it to see if this was a normal side effect.  Wow_ I had no idea this many women were having the same problems and that some of mine may be linked to this pill.

Ive been off the pill for a month now and the pain in my breast comes and goes especially around the time when im about to start and through my period.

Over the past few months the intensity of the symptoms have greatly increased_ to the point I felt like I was going crazy and was considering going to get treatment for depression.  Today I finally put it all together and realized it's this pill.  I wish I had kept a journal of symptoms from the time I began taking it so I could have made the connection sooner!

My sex drive was still there_ but it was a little more painful because of the dryness.  It completely got rid of my cramps_ and any slight acne that I had (which wasn't much to begin with).  I went off of it because I missed a couple periods and was worried I might be pregnant. I took pregnancy tests to make sure that I wasn't_ but this scared me into getting on another pill.  I had taken yaz once before and decided to switch to this pill_ but my cramps came back double what they were before to the point where I had to stay home from school and my periods were very heavy and long. Even heavier and longer than they were before I got on the pill altogether.  So I made the choice to switch back to microgestin because not having a period was way better than my other side effects.

I thought this pill was great at first because it gave me light and short periods.  However_ this winter I have had about 4 colds_ sinus infections_ etc....  I am rarely sick_ I might get one cold a winter and sometimes none at all.  I was wondering what was wrong with my immune system until I started reading about the side effects and realized that sinus infections was one of them!  I've also noticed that I am so inpatient and super quick to get flaming angry_ which I never used to have a problem with!  This sucks and I am now realizing that it may be due to the pill.  I have also been struggling with fatigue and depression_ and feelings of hopelessness on and off.   I have been wondering all along if it may be connected to the pill and I truly believe that it is.  I often wake up in the night and am in a pool of sweat_ plus I wake up more than I ever used to.  I cannot remember the last time I actually slept thru an entire night_ it has been over 6 months probably.

For the past few months_ I have found myself barely making it through the workday and just going home to hang out by myself. I googled the side effects and went to this link and was astonished as to what other women reported.  I can truly relate to the some of the same complaints and I am very dissappointed that my doctor discarded my concerns.  Although the effects differ in each woman_ there are still some and only time can truly tell what will appear.  My experience with this medication was very negative and I would advise any women to stop taking this if you feel any depression_ weight gain_ emotional mood swings and random numbness.

Before the pill_ I had no acne whatsoever but would get a pimple every now and then but now nothing! Ive noticed my skin become so amazingly clear.. I love it! The first day I took the pill (9PM) I experienced extree nausea and ended up puking. I then decided to take it at 4PM everyday with a meal. The only side effect I have seen is swollen breast and they can be very tender at times. I have had an increase in apetite_ and from that have gained a pound or two_ nothing big. Although I must say Im pleased as I was a little underweight before due to a lot of stress in my life in the past month.

358, 1, Contraception,I have taken Loestrin every day for 7 months and stopped taking it today due to all of the side effects I have experienced. I developed severe acne all over my face_ chest_ neck_ and back which has been untreatable. My mood fluctuates erratically from very irritable to sad to angry. I feel constant fatigue_ and experience terrible cramping_ but have not had a period in 3 months. I panic every month when I don't have a period_ and have to run to get a pregnancy test. I have gained 5 lbs_ and completely lost interest in sex. I literally have not had the desire to have sex for 6 months.This pill is more trouble than it is worth. I have terrible side effects and no relief.,This pill is the worst I have tried; even worse than Yaz.

I was right i have put on no weight however im experiencing serious itching and my legs are blue_ all my veins have come up and every night im in severe pain of my kidneys after reading the leaflet of the pill i discovered that thrombosis could be a side effect.,F,17,17  days30 1X D,2/4/2010Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
360, 3, birth control_ lighter periods,breakouts_ spotting_ nausea,I have been on Loestrin for almost one month now_ just started the brown pills but have not gotten my period yet. I just switched from yaz because I was concerned about all of the health problems it has been linked to_ and because it made my breasts very sore. On the up side_ my breasts don't hurt as much on Loestrin. But on the down side_ the first two to three weeks on it I was getting very nauseous. I was taking the pill at night but switched to the morning and it seemed to make the nausea go away. I also has some brownish spotting for a few weeks but that also subsided. In addition my face has been breaking out SO bad! Normally I break out a little bit around my period_ but nothing terrible. But since starting loestrin I've got severe acne. I'm hoping after a few months I will adjust to the new hormone and it will go away. It's strange though because Yaz has the same dose of estrogen and it never made me breakout. If the breakouts don't stop though I'll definitely be switching to a new pill again_ no way am I putting up with this!,F,22,26  days,2/1/2010,Loestrin fe 1/20
361, 4, Birth Control,Irregular spotting between periods_ mild nausea if taken without food.,No serious side effects.  The irregular spotting was a bit annoying_ but easy to deal with.

I also have severe migranes to the point where I throw up. I'm not myself anymore and I cry for no reason. I feel depressed and am just sitting in my room for most of the time I'm home. I get massize mood swings too.,I would NOT recommend this pill. I feel like a different person now(not in a good way either). I started off on Yaz and got headaches on a daily basis but compared to Loestrin it's worth it. I'm switching back to Yaz after this month is over,F,16,3  months,1/10/2010,Loestrin fe 1/20
367, 3, Prevent pregnancy.,Cramps a few days before period. In consistant periods. No change in sex drive. My gyn recommended this to help lessen the strength of my period cramps which I experienced on yaz,I previously took Yasmin for about three years then switched to yaz for about two years and now am on this. For me_ Cramps are not as bad as previous birth controls but I have had periods ranging from 5 to 7 days some months and only 2 days other months.  For example_ the past two months I have had somewhat heavy long periods_ but this month my period seemed like a little spotting one day only so I am freaking out that I am pregnant. I have not taken a test yet and don't feel any different so I don't know if this is common for loestrin or not. Any advice from experienced users would be appreciated.,F,21,7  months,1/6/2010Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
368, 4, birth control,nausea,I am taking Microgestin FE 120 for a month now. I took the first pill and then decided to just read up on it. I was scared out of my mind after reading reviews. I tried to calm myself down by saying that people usually only give reviews with a bad occurence. Raily do people seek out these sites to give a positive one. Nevertheless I was scared. I thought I was going to gain weight_ be an emotional crazy person_ suffer from bad eye sight_ etc etc. I was especially scared because I would take the pill at noon and at 5 pm everyday I would feel nauseous. I changed my time to 5pm_ and hey problem solved. I am usually in bed by the time the nausea would start.Other than that_ no weight gain_ no headaches_ no lose of sexual interest_ and no breast tenderness. Everyone is different and their bodies react differently. I would say I am very satisfied with this birth control.,F,27,1  months,12/30/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

When I first started taking Loestrin I went into a depression for a couple of months.  I quit taking the pill last week when the almost non existent sex drive continued becoming a major issue between my husband and me.  I have been off the pill 7 days and I can already see a major difference - so can he!  We'll see if I can lose some of that weight now.  No major adverse physical side effects that i can tell.,F,30,2  years,12/14/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

Is it bad that I didn't finish the pack? I also have yet to start my period but it feels as if I have cramps from now and then plus my breasts ache horribly like they did on the pill. It's been 2 weeks since I've stopped the pill (I only took it for 3 weeks) and my question is could it have stopped my period? I already took 2 pregnancy tests last week and both were negative_ should I take another? Or could it stop my period for this month? thank you!,F,22,3  weeks,12/11/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

For the first pack I would feel a little nauseated in the mornings right after I woke up_ but it didn't happen again after having my period and starting the second pack.,On this pill I was able to protect myself from having babies when I didn't want them and was also delighted by having noticeably shorter_ lighter periods! I didn't notice any skin benefits nor did I gain any weight. If anything I've lost a bit of weight since I started taking this pill. Maybe it's because I can carelessly have sex with my boyfriend whenever I want.,F,19,6  months,12/10/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
376, 1, Contraception,Severe bloating_ anxiety_ IBS flare up_ yeast infection_ tiredness_ tearful one minute then angry the next_ resistance to contact lenses.,This pill is horrible! It is the 4th pill I've tried in the last year and I hate it! After changing from Yasmin; which gave me awful migranes constantly but with no other side effects. I have been taking it now continuously (tricycling because if I don't I get really bad migranes) and it was fine for the first 3 packets (some spotting in the first packet) but after I had a break with no period it's all gone downhill. I've been really bloated_ feeling sick and had lots of stomach cramps. Along with massive anxiety attacks mainly due to worrying about being pregnant despite 3 negative pregnancy tests all well after when my period is due. I look 4 months pregnant by the end of everyday. I have gained 6Ibs due to huge sugar cravings. My contact lenses now annoy the hell out of me. My IBS has flared up; I think mainly due to all the anxiety to do with no periods and possibly being pregnant. I have been crying at the smallest things and getting annoyed really easily. I had a yeast infection for about a month when I started this pill then followed by cystitis for 2 weeks. Now that I have typed all this I'm beginning to wonder why I'm still on this pill! So I can guarantee I will be switching as soon as possible.,F,23,4  months,12/8/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
377, 1, ,Acne_ tiredness_ hair loss_ rashes on my hands and neck_ headaches_ missed periods_ lack of sex drive_ dryness_ sadness_ tender breasts.,The first three months of this pill were great. All the previous (5) pill brands had given me terrible headaches and mood swings_ so my doctor decided to try me out with a lower dose. After three months I started to break out on my chin_ but I figured I could deal with it once a month in return for a 2 day period and clear head_ but from then it only got worse. It's now been six months and I'm constantly tired_ have reoccuring headaches and the spots have spread from my chin to my whole face_ huge_ red and painful spots that linger for weeks at a time. It's getting me so down_ but I thought I'd give my body the change to adjust_ which is why I've waited so long. I'm now missing periods_ suffering from incredibly sore breasts and a lack of sex drive and am truly worried about the amount of hair that I'm losing every day. I'm going to the doctor as soon as I possibly can to get this changed. I'm just worried that the side effects will take months to disappear now. I'm so miserable.,F,22,6  months,12/6/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
378, 5, good effects,No negative side effects_ all positive_ i lost weight =),First off i would like to tell you my history with two other BC_ First birth control i ever took was Yaz/Yasmin= mood swings_ weight gain especially in breast. After taking that for a year i switched to the nuva ring_ and i had no negative side effects except for low sex drive and dryness and was using that method for about 2 years. I recently have started taking Loestrin and let me tell you what i todl the doctor_ i had told her how the nuva ring made me dry down there and not able to have a sex drive. and my doctor said i should try loestrin since it is suppose to have less symptoms than the rest_ although it really depends on how your body chemicals react to loestrin's chemicals. So far_ i havent had any bad side effects and ive only been on this method for 7 days_ some good things is that i have lower appeotite and ive actually lost 2 1/2 pounds. i havent had any negative side effects so im super happy. I wonder if anyone else is in this position =) Also im curious is people who have had taken yaz/yasmin and experienced bad side effects like i did and if they switched to loestrin and notice no bad side effects. That would be interesting for all of us to know. I hope this helps!!,F,20,7  days,11/30/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

380, 1, Dr recommended lower estrogren pill,After taking it for 3 days_ I had horrible all over body itching and burning skin - but nothing visible to the eye. It was awful. Subsided about 2 after I stopped taking. I am posting this so other women know this is possible - as there was very little about itching posted online.  It is listed on the meds as one of the unlikely but severe side effects.,My dr had been pushing me to try this pill for a few years. I was doing fine on Yasmin. I finally said sure_ I will try a lower dose and this is what happened. I called his office 3 days in a row and did not get a call back! I wonder if he has some financial interest in this drug... I am no longer going back to his practice.,F,45,3  days,11/27/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
381, 4, heavy periods_ acne_ birth control,I really haven't had too many side effects on this drug.  Vaginal dryness and decreased lubrication_ some negative effect on sex drive (but not as bad as some other pills).  My biggest complaint is that I am having a LOT of trouble with hair loss but I'm not sure that I can totally blame this pill.  I had pneumonia (and was sick for 2 months_ went through multiple rounds of antibiotics and steroids) and then a job loss (talk about stress) around the time I started taking this medication.  Both of those things could have been the cause.  I'm still under a great deal of stress_ so I could still be having hair loss effects from that.  If it doesn't let up soon I'm going to get my hormones and thyroid tested.  I do suspect there may be a connection since it's lasting this long.  If that's the case_ I may have to stop the drug.,I have taken a lot of birth control pills.  This one has been one of the best for my acne_ even though the androgen level is supposedly very high.  I love the light periods...they are only 2-3 days and that's it.  Although they don't seem to come until I'm almost done w/ the sugar pills.,F,29,4  months,11/25/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
382, 1, control irregular periods,depression_ acne_ constant bleeding_ anxiety.,To say I HATE this pill would be an understatement.  It made me depressed_ filled with anxiety_ mad and unable to think clearly. It made me dizzy_ something I did not feel prior to taking this medication. Then my OBGY said you need an EKG...please I was not suffering dizzy spells until this pill. I bled 3 weeks non stop and she told me to stick with it and it would improve_ it did not.  Now I am suffering from Bacterial Vaginosus  (BV) which I believe was caused from this pill. BV is caused by an over growth of bad bacteria in the womb_ i really think this was caused by the constant bleeding and this pill.  I know i am not a doctor but I just blame it on this pill.   I would advise NO ONE to try this pill from hell.,F,47,3  months,11/25/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
383, 2, Acne_ PMDD_ irregular periods,Headaches_ tiredness_ dizziness_ loss of appetite_ migraines_ sensitivity to light_ loss of motivation and concetration_ strange dreams_ vocalization in sleep_ heavy period,The first two months taking this pill were really beneficial. I had a regular period_ though off-schedule_ and a significant reduction in acne. My chest acne and most of my back had cleared up_ which was a huge relief. The third month was also off-schedule_ but when my period started_ it lasted for nearly 12 days. I had cramps_ which I had rarely had before_ and as soon as I went on the placebos I felt terribly tired. I had mild headaches_ slept for nearly 15 hours_ and lost all motivation to do schoolwork or just about anything else. Standing and walking made me dizzy. Going back on the pill for the next cycle helped_ but once again_ my period was a week early and very heavy. The headaches were constant and almost migraine-like with sensitivity to light. I've had to take naps once to three times daily.Also while on the third cycle's placebos_ I began to vocalize in my sleep_ waking myself and my boyfriend up. My dreams became nightmares_ and I often woke up sweating. This same thing happened on my fourth cycle of the pills. This pill has caused me to fail a class_ and is pushing me behind in my other classes due to my inability to concentrate and stay awake. Not worth taking...,F,19,4  months,11/18/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

Then I started the pill again on Sunday.  The 3rd cycle I just spotted when I wiped myself_ brown blood almost unnoticable. The 3rd and 4th cycle_ I never even got my period.  I don't know if I'm pregnant or if due to the fact that my period is so light to begin with_ Loestrin made it disappear  completely.,F,45,5  months,11/7/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

I also kept worrying about every little thing and dwelling on my problems excessively. I never have or have had any acne and got a little bit on my face. I also felt sad a lot of the time for no reason and felt a lack of control of my life.

389, 3, birth control,Unexplained anxiety_ mood swings_ irritability_ spotting,I have been of the pill for over 2 years and was very happy with that. Following unplanned pregnancy and termination I decide to go back on the pill. After some research I thought that Loestrin could work. First few month were OK apart from very irregular and very frequent short (1-3 days) light periods or rather spotting or weird (dark red/brown) discharge. Over a last month I have started experiencing mood swings_ I am irritable and get upset about things I would normally laugh about but it didnt click it could be the pill. Than I switched to Loestrin 30 in order to regulate the period and my mood and irritability got even worse. Its like I am a different person-needy_ teary and easily upset-that is not me! So after one week of taking the Loestrin 30 (higher dose than 20) I decided to stop completely. It has only been two days but the spotting stopped and I am starting to feel a bit better! Not sure I will ever go on a pill again-if so definitely not Loestrin.,F,26,7  months,10/30/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

Waited a couple months and started again in Sept. and have been on a roller coaster ride ever since....2nd month without period_ can't keep buying pregnancy tests_ hormones feel completely out of whack and I just feel ""icky""_ and ugly.

I haven't been on anything since we got married almost 8 years ago and I thought the side effects were just my body getting used to the medicine_ but now I am not so sure.  I am going to continue this pack and perhaps 2 more packs that my Dr. gave me becuase the nurse said it may take 2-3 cycles before my body is adjusted.  After reading other's posts I hope that my acne does not get any worse!  I will not be able to stand that and the other day I did get scared at the mall and immediately left with my 2 children.

I am nausious to the point of throwing up_ I have headaches (I get the often and I never used to get them at all).  Also_ I tried this 3 mos ago and after 1 wk on it_ I ended up in the hospital for 2 days getting an mri and cat scan of my head because I had developed left sided numbness.  I hadn't put that together with this pill and started taking it again about 1.5 mos ago only to have these side effects now.

396, 4, contraception_ no periods,low sex drive,I've been taking Loestrin for over 2 years now and my only gripe with it is that i have a low sex drive.  Not having my period is fantastic (i have stopped for 2 months at one point_ but that was because i moved overseas and had trouble getting it here).  I have never had any other side effects (and to the girl that commented on having a history of panic attacks_ i have panic disorder_ but it hasn't made it worse at all in my case). BC pills affect every body differently_ i have been on other pills in the past (probably since i was 20?)_ and the only other side effect i've ever had was slight nausea (but that wasn't with loestrin).  Good luck!,F,26,2  years,10/21/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
397, 1, To lighten heavy periods,Leg cramps_ chest pain_ rapid heart beat_ & numbness on left side.,I was put on Loestrin one month ago to lighten my heavy periods.  I am a healthy mom of 3 kids.  Within a few days_ I started having leg cramps at night.   I also was having difficulty sleeping and waking up frequently (didn't realize it was connected)   Last night I woke up in the middle of the night and thought I was having a heart attack.  My heart was beating out of my chest_ I had a hard time catching my breath and my left arm started tingling.  I have never experienced anything so scary in my life. I take no other medications other than these BC pills.  I immediately stopped and have an apt at my OBGYN tomorrow.  Be careful - these are dangerous meds.

398, 1, fibroids,acne/cysts_ moodiness,i was on this medicine last year for birth control for 3 months and felt weird so decided to go off since my husband had a vasectomy.  i felt so much better off the pill.  i then developed fibroids 3 months later and my doctor recommended i go back on loestrin.  i was unsure whether to do it but decided to start again to try and resolve the bleeding caused by the fibroid.  i hate this pill..3-4 months after starting again all my symptoms came back with a vengeance.  cysts on my chin and back_ horrible moodiness and temper and generally miserable.,F,36,4  months,10/15/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
399, 1, Contraception,Extreme breast tenderness and swelling_ bloating_ fatigue_ unusual mental effects_ feels like PMS all the time.,I_ too_ am glad I found this site.  I know that I am not crazy_ and that I am not imagining what is happening to me.  I am 38 years old.  Generally happy_ healthy and horny.  I am dissatisfied with birth control options out there.  After trying to get an IUD (the midwife could not measure my uterus_ hence_ could not insert the device and talked me into this pill as an alternative).  I cannot stand this pill.  I have a very hard time dragging myself out of bed in the morning.  I am normally a very active_ energetic person and I have been sluggish since being on this pill.  I've had suicidal thoughts (!) which is very weird.  I want to jump out of my skin!  My breasts are swollen_ heavy and painful to the touch.  I'm bloated and feel like I'm already gaining weight after 1 1/2 weeks on this pill.  Hard to feel sexy with all this going on.  I am going to finish out this pack and I am saying good-bye to artificial hormones forever!,F,38,17  days,10/14/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
400, 5, contraception_ alleviate PMS,Mild nausea during the first week immediately after taking pill_ minor bloating/water retention_ cyst-like pimple on chin (but that could be due to variety of reasons including diet) and yeast infection for 3 days which cleared up without any need for treatment.,This is the first time I've taken any kind of BC and so far_ the experience has been generally positive.  Despite the handful of side effects mentioned_ they are really not anything serious and are easily dealt with.  Not sure if the yeast infection is even related_ but I have seen it mentioned as a possible side effect somewhere.  On the upside_ since taking the pill_ I have actually been in a better mood and feel much more balanced_ have not experienced any changes in sex drive_ and my breasts seem to be getting bigger (going from a size A to almost B_ hoping to cross that threshold soon)! Additionally_ the pill seemed to have alleviated most of my IBS symptoms as well - stomach feels better than it had for years.  Overall_ I would recommend Loestrin (fe 24) based on my experiences - however_ it does vary by person.,F,25,14  days,10/13/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
401, 5, Contraceptive,Nausea_ mood swings,Loestrin is the first pill I have taken and so far it has been wonderful. The first month I did experience some nausea and mood swings but by the third pack all of the side effects had gone away. It is true that this pill will make your period practically non-existent but that's a good thing in my book. I have no cramps_ a very light 1-2 day period_ and haven't gained more than a pound or two.,F,21,4  months,10/12/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
402, 2, To help with mood swings,complete loss of sex drive_ fatigue (sleeping for about 10-11 hours per day and still feeling tired)_ acne (on face and body).,I switched from Ortho Novum 777 to this pill to maybe help calm my mood swings. I didn't do much in that department (I think I am a naturally moody person) and it just made me not ever want to have sex (which was making me feel depressed since it was effecting my relationship. It also made me feel tired constantly_ no matter how much I slept the night before. It also made my skin explode with pimples. The ortho novum 777 combined with my skin care regime was making my skin look great_ but LoEstrin made me break out so badly on my face_ back (which hasn't happened since I was a young teen) and chest. I switched back to Ortho Novum 777 just 2 days ago_ hopefully there is an improvement.,F,21,5  months,10/12/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
403, 1, contraceptive,nausea_ depression_ suicidal_ bloatedness_ weight-gain_ confusion_ blacking out,This pill completely screwed me up. I was sick constantly_ I was always depressed_ I was having suicidal thoughts_ frequent uncontrollable episodes of anger_ blacking out and forgetting where I was. These things are completely abnormal for me. I thought I was going to slip into a psychiatric episode or something. I felt I was losing my grip on reality_ on myself_ losing complete control. I had an uncontrollable outburst in public_ which is something so outlandish for me to do. I was hysterically crying all the time. This stuff  really messed with my head_ my emotions_ my body. I got two busted veins in my legs and was having chest pains and rapid heartbeat. I was dizzy. I felt like I had no idea who I was or what I was becoming. It was terrifying. I called my doctor_ who said_ though it would be a good idea to finish the pack out.  (well_ the NP said so_ my doctor later told me this was not the right idea) I still wasn't right for a month or two but began to feel like myself again. Looking back on that three month span (I thought I should give my body a chance to adjust)  I am still appalled at the things I thought/felt/said/did. I was completely suicidal. I'm not sure what it is with this pill. I was on Yaz before that_ and another kind a few years back. These only gave me painful stomach cramps. I would rather suffer through that than to totally feel as if I had lost all grip on reality. My doctor told me he was getting similar complaints from other patients_ and I read onl,F,20,3  months,10/11/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

The first 2 months I completely missed my period (thought I was pregnat for 3 months but I wasn't) and really strange discharge those first 2 months. I get random cramps and bloating. I've been on probably 10 different pills over the last 4-5 years because they all make my feel horrible! Loestrin isn't the worse I'd say.. However it's starting to occur to me that my extreme mood swings and inability to make decisions_ and feeling numb and empty are quite possibly from the pill. I'd like to hear from someone who knows what I mean! Ugh the pill is totally a win/lose situation!!!!! It's so annoying trying to find the ""right"" pill.",F,21,4  months,10/6/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
406, 2, Heavy periods,Nausea_ Migraines_ fatigue_ depression_ anger_ lack of concentration and numbness in my legs_ difficulty breathing,I wish I had found this site sooner.  I could not put into words how this pill made me feel until after I heard other ladies describe their symptoms.  I literally thougth I was going to die. The first month I was spotting after the first week so I did not feel like being intimate. After taking them for 1 more week and realizing I was TOTALLY OUT OF IT; I was shaking and being rude to my family...I just stopped.  I feel 90% better_ I am now exercising trying to get back to my old self. I would advise IF you do take this pill keep a journal of how you are feeling because obviously it is for SOME and NOT for OTHERS.,F,40,35  days,10/5/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
407, 5, Birth Control,,I have been on loestrin for 4 months and it is great_ it is my first birth control pill and I was really nervous to take it due to all the negative comments_ but it has worked great for me.  The only side effect was the spotting the first month_ and headaches the first month_ but other than that it has been great.  I highly recommend it_ especially if you are new to taking the pill,F,23,4  months,9/30/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

I had myself convinced I might be pregnant because me stomach is constantly upset and my mouth is always watering like I'm going to puke. After I started crying for no reason tonight I decided to search reviews and came across this site. I had a complete breakdown for nothing-which is not usual! Think I'm going to stop taking it...*Every body reacts different to medications so I'm sure it works great for some.,F,30,2  months,9/29/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

411, 4, birth control_ heavy/irreg periods,Experienced typical side effects I get from all birth control: increased breast size & tenderness_ slight water retention.,This pill is the best one I've ever tried.  So far I've been on Ortho-Lo_ Seasonale_ Yasmin.  All of them have given me side effects_ especially with mood swings.  However I love Loestrin because I am not experiencing any mood swings!!!!  Would highly recommend this_ as it is very low dose hormone_ doesn't vary week by week_ and is a pretty standard pill.,F,24,6  months,9/23/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

My acne which i have been fighting forever began coming back again_ horrble. My hubby told me am acting very weird crying over nothing and anything.He told me tonight to throw it away. Not a big fan of birth control becos of all the side effects but am definitely not taking it anymore. Scared to try anything else.,F,29,10  days,9/23/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
413, 2, Ovarian cysts_ endometriosis,Increased appetite (really - CONSTANT hunger)_ acne_ increased sex drive_ panic attacks & anxiety_ mood swings.,I've only been on this pill for 2 weeks_ but I have to stop it already because I just can't handle the side effects. I switched to Loestrin after two years on Seasonique/Seasonale because of spotting_ but that was NOTHING to deal with compared to this. I have NEVER had acne like this_ not even as a teenager. My libido is INSANE (weird_ right? for most it's the opposite) and I'm VERY single_ so it's distracting & inconvenient. I've been eating so much that several co-workers have asked me if I'm pregnant_ and I've been going WAY over my budget for food. Lots of mood swings and crying_ too (and I NEVER cry!!!) - but the worst part is the anxiety. Granted_ I have a history of panic disorder and other anxiety issues_ but I hadn't had a panic attack in over two years until I started taking this pill; now for two weeks I've had at least one almost every single day_ sometimes several_ and it's only been getting progressively worse. I didn't even know this pill could have anything to do with that until tonight; now that I know_ I'm stopping the pill immediately. Otherwise_ I probably would have stuck it out a little longer to see if the other symptoms subside. Overall_ I can't say that I wouldn't recommend this medication to others_ because the side effects seem to be really different for everyone. However_ if you have a history of any anxiety disorder_ or even just occasional panic attacks_ I would definitely stay far_ far away from this pill.,F,29,2  weeks,9/19/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
414, 2, Birth Control,Negative Side Effects: headaches_ dizziness_ irritability_ depression_ mood swings_ nervousness,I switched to this prescription from Yaz since Yaz was giving me severe headaches (I usually never got headaches)_ only to find that the generic of this drug also gives me headaches_ though not as bad. Also_ I have unexplainable sadness/anxiety randomly while taking this pill. I get panic attacks over the smallest things and start crying_ which is very unusual for me.,F,20,1  months,9/17/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

Very tired all the time (im 28 i should not feel this drained constantly) having cramps like i am getting my period but im not_ and an overall sense of just not feeling well at all.,this pill is scary i have never felt any of these symptoms and have been on many diff brands. i cannot believe my doc recommended it so highly which makes me think about switching physicians.,F,28,4  days,9/17/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

417, 1, Stop heavy bleeding during cycles,Day 1- Bleeding stopped. Light headache felt extremly drowsy_ passed out for 2 hours during mid-day which is unlike me. Day 2- Started to feel bloated_ signs of yeast infection that I could only contribute to taking the pill.Day 3 -Very bloated_ a little queasy_ very uncomfortable   Day 4 -I'm a joyful person_ but I became very depressed with feelings of heavy dreadfullness_ and I didn't want to talk to anyone. I felt sad and like I was suffocating. I had to reframe myself from jumping out the car on the expressway. I was very anxious_ impatient_ nervous. The yeast infection was getting worse and then I became consipated. My stomach looked 4 months pregant. I started getting bad leg cramps at night.Day 5 - I stopped taking the pill. Immediate change in mood_ I felt myself again. Two days later_ everything was back to normal.        ,I'm very disappointed. I wanted this to work. It was my last resort. I read the side effects and reviews of others_ but felt very positive about taking the pill. This low dosage is very powerful. I took birth control pills years ago in my twenties. I don't recall side effects such as this. I gained weight then lost. Maybe I did have side effects_ but handled them better then.  The side effects are too much for me! However_ I can't say I wouldn't recommend it for someone else because everyone is different.I also can't say I'm dissatisfied because_ unfortionately_ I could not give it the full 3 months trial period the product suggests. I'm really disappointed I couldn't continue the product do to the side effects.,F,49,4  days,9/14/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
418, 3, Control Mood Swings_ Birth Control,I had been prescribed this to take 21 days continuously to try to help my PMDD.  The first pack_ I spotted the entire time but I felt amazing!!  The emotional ups and downs did stop for me.  Unfortunately_ then came the loss of sex drive.  Then_ the depression.  I couldn't get motivated to do anything or even want to get up in the morning.  I know it takes time to get use to a pill_ so I gave it another pack.  Then_ the chest tightness began at night.  I would lay down to sleep and suddenly feel like I couldn't breath even though I could draw deep breaths.  I also had changes in my sleep cycle and massive anxiety attacks (mainly during by the chest tightness).,I hope this works for you!,F,23,2.5  months,9/13/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

421, 1, PCOS,Loestrin raised my blood pressure to dangerous levels (160/110)_ I gained approximately 12 pounds_ my facial acne was out of control_ I was tired constantly and did not have a period for the entire time I was taking this medicine (over 4 months).,I am using birth control medicine to control symptoms of PCOS_ and was diagnosed nearly 10 years ago.  Due to my complications described in the side effects column_ I have stopped taking this pill and am now awaiting the results of blood testing to determine if another kind will be beneficial.  Prior to being on Loestrin_ I was on Yasmin_ and only changed because I was looking to have a shorter period.  I would suggest to anyone looking to change medications (or to start one) that they stay in contact with their physician and keep them apprised of any and all changes_ no matter how small.  I ignored my symptoms and did not think that my problems were tied to the pill.  I've now spent more time and money to fix everything than I'd like to admit_ so please listen to your body.

Other then that... just crazy crazy dreams and SPOTTING,ok i am going on only my SECOND week of Loestrin24 and so far its not that bad. I read all these other negative comments and it freaks me out!!! Hopefully_ these terrible things dont happen to me. How long did it take for sex drive to decrease with you guys? So far im fine. Im a little more moody then normal_ like_ my boyfriend has been bugging me lately (more then usual i think cuz of pill). the only TRUE side effect ive noticed is spotting.

Decreased appetite_ but I'm not going to complain about that. :),I'm not ready to throw a 5 rating out there yet_ because I'm in my second week. But so far_ I am SUPER pleased at the results compared to other BC pills I've been on. Don't freak out about the negative comments - all bodies are different_ and most pills I've been on take 2-3 months to iron themselves out.I am really excited to have a pill with the iron supplement in it. I feel a lot stronger_ have more energy_ and am SO glad I am not a crazy psycho b****_ like I have been even in the first week of other pills I've been on.

Have been put on the ""mini-pill""_ Mirena IUD_ and now this pill to regulate my periods. The side effects from this pill have driven me CRAZY. My moodiness and irritability were so severe on this pill that my poor husband BEGGED me to throw them out. He said he'd rather deal with one week of PMS instead of four weeks every month. The horrible side effects from this pill just aren't worth it. I'm considering the endometrial abblation_ at this point. No more sythetic hormones for me!",F,42,5  months,9/3/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

It has been a few months now and I have gained weight and have crazy mood swings and depression now. Sooooo not like me! I am thinking it has to be hormonal_ has to be from the Pill.

428, 1, Period Pain,Extremely emotional_ morning nausea_ constant crying_ nervousness_ headaches_ mixed up feelings_ unexplainable sadness/depression,I have been on this for 4 months and things were going great with it. Then I start getting sad for no reason. I cry uncontrollably just simply thinking of things or even looking at my dog. One minute I'm fine with everything; parents_ friends_ boyfriend_ etc. Then the next minute I don't want to see my friends_ can't stand hearing my parents speak_ and want to end my relationship with the sweetest guy. I wake up feeling nauseas and with a headache which eventually leads to me puking at least once. I asked my OBGYN about it and they said it was a virus and I would be fine in a week. It's been a month and it all just came on so quickly. Viruses have stuffy noses_ coughing_ some sore throats. Not extreme mood swings and depression. Plus it didn't even help the pain for my period. I have 2 day long periods which are nice but the pain lasts for those 2 days. I'm stopping this pill.,F,17,4  months,8/27/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

By the end of the week I was uncontrollably crying at everything and anything_ yet couldn't understand why. I was taken to a doctor after parents thought I was suicidal. She suggested anti-depressants! However_ I had researched other patients problems with this pill_ and decided to take myself off it. Within a few days I was back to my 'usual' self.

I have been on several different brands of the pill_ and this had the worst acne side effect of any of the others i have tried (Estrostep Fe_ Desogen_ Ortho Novum 7/7/7_ and Ortho-TriCyclen).

For the first year or so I had/or didn't realize any negative side effects. My face couldn't look any better_ not that I had bad acne in the first place. I had my period the same time every month (during the brown pill) so my period was predicable_ small flow_ and lasted only 2-3 days. It was great. Until I realized a year later...I was probably in denial. I gained almost 15-20lbs. I was always moody and I didn't know why. I would get depressed easily and I had no more sex drive at all! I am now getting off the pill (yesterday) and already my body is reacting. I started my period and got incredible cramps. I guess this is the way your body is suppose to ""heal"" after being on the pill so long. I can only hope for positive outcomes of throwing my pills in the garbage. Keep your head up girls.",F,22,20  months,7/30/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
442, 5, Pregnancy Prevention,NONE,I have just finished my first pack...I don't know what all these other ladies are talking about_ I got on this pill because Yaz killed my sex drive but Loestrin brought it right back.  The tender breasts happen with all BC's I have tried as well as with this one_ but not as bad with this one.  Also_ I have never had trouble with any birth controls as far as spotting UNLESS I didn't take it the same time everyday.  That is crucial.  Also_ my period was hardly noticeable and even though barely having one can freak some people out about wondering if they're pregnant or not_ that is an inner thing.  Just take the pill at the same time every day.  if you miss one_ use a condom!  Other wise_ there is a 1 in 100 chance you could get  preggo by correctly taking the pill and the way I see it_ if you happen to be that stat_ it was meant to be!  Also_ some women are talking about depression due to this pill...it may be true for some_ but I strongly feel that is an inner thing as well and has nothing to do with the pill...I've taken quite a few different kinds and have never experienced a change in my moods...maybe I am just even tempered but I don't like to blame the pill for my feelings.  I am sure some of ya'll won't appreciate my comments_ but that is fine.  This pill ROCKS.,F,26,1  months,7/17/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
443, 2, to shorten periods,extreme fatigue_ sore breasts_ nausea,"I started taking this 4 weeks ago; just got my period today_ during the ""inactive"" iron pill phase. I started taking this because my periods are excessive in length; my doctor thought this would straighten them out. Well_ I'd rather have longer periods than the complete and utter exhaustion I've been feeling for the past few weeks. I need a nap every day and I'm cranky because I'm so tired all. the. time. I was nauseous the first few days but not terribly. Sadly I'll have to figure something else out_ this is not worth it!",F,39,27  days,7/17/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
444, 2, hormone balance,nausea_ headache_ basically no period- more light brown discharge with some red_ dizziness,I am going to get off this pill.  I've had two periods on it- one was HORRIBLY HEAVY and the one I'm having now barely exists.  I took two pregnancy tests to be sure and both were negative.  I'm on the generic of this pill.,F,20,3  months,7/15/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
445, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain_ depression_ abdominal pain_ lower back pain_ joint pain_ irritability,I ended up taking the generic form of this medication_ Microgestin_ due to my other bc pill going up significantly in price. Worst mistake I ever made. I had hosts of problems for 3 years after taking this pill_ and come to find out it's because this pill dropped my progesterone levels down very low. I've recently started using some progesterone cream_ and all of my troubling symptoms have gone away. I recommend Estrostep FE_ if anyone is looking to switch to another pill (don't get the generic kind_ either). Have your GYN or an endocrinologist check your hormone levels if you are still having side effects after taking this pill. They may be able to prescribe something to help you.,F,30,2  months,7/15/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
446, 2, Pregnancy Prevention,Swollen and painful breasts_ loss of sex drive_ bleeding and cramps after sex_ acne,I take the generic_ Junel. I have taken the brand name Loestrin in the past and didn't have as many side effects_ just the loss of sex drive. The positive thing is that I have not had my period_ as I was taking this continuously due to painful and extended periods. Even so_ I plan to go off this pill.,F,29,3  months,7/11/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
447, 4, Birth Control,Breast Tenderness But This is good as i have small breasts anyway and it made them look Alot bigger :) .. mood swings not very good .. i tend to get angry alot,i do recommend this pill,F,17,1  months,7/1/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
448, 2, birth control,weight gain_ bloating_ increased acne_ breast tenderness_ signs of depression_ NO sex drive_ + was little period,As I'm reading ALL of these comments I can't believe so many other women have gone through the same things...I was only on this pill for maybe 6mos. - I began looking up signs of depression and then linked it to the pill...been off of it for about 3 weeks now and feel like a cloud has been lifted I am SOOO glad I took myself off! If youre feeling these things just try 1 week off - I felt better in 1 week!!!!!,F,30,5  months,6/28/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
449, 1, birth control,slight wieght gain_ acne,horrible acne!!! and i never get acne!!!,F,37,1  months,6/26/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
450, 3, ,I have noticed weight gain and i feel so bloated in the stomach area. Also I am tired a lot_ moody and always hungry. On the days I should have had a period_ if it came.. it was way light. Almost more discharge with a tint of red_ than blood. This last week my boobs are way bigger than normal and more full. They are very tender too. All these symptoms made me think i was pregnant. So i went and took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. Im so far not liking this pill...,,F,23,2  months,6/24/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
451, 1, Prevent pregnancy & improve acne,Hives_ throat swelling_ the thought of intimacy made me want to puke (loss of libido)_ vaginal irritation_ feelings of panic/impending doom_ depression_ mild bloating.,I believe I had an allergic reaction to this pill. My throat swelled shut and I broke out in small hives all over my face_ chest_ and back. I lost interest in any form of intimacy. I also had these weird feelings of panic.. you know_ like the kind of feeling you get whenever you realize you've lost your car keys. I thought that weird feeling would go away if I kept taking the pill_ but it only became worse with time. I've also tried Yaz & Ortricyclen lo and both made me an emotional train wreck. On the bright side_ this pill made me have those panic-y feelings_ but it didn't make me an emotional trainwreck like the other pills did.,F,18,2  weeks,6/23/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
452, 5, Birth Control/Hormone Balance,No side effects on brand name (many side effects when tried the generic - cramps_ mood swings_ emotional_ heavy bleeding),I have been very happy with this pill as long as I take the brand name.  Light periods_ no cramps_ helps keep hormone levels in check. The generic is NOT the same. If you are taking a generic version_ you are taking a different pill.  I have been on this pill for at least 8 years and the ONLY time I had any side effects and they were awful_ cramping_ mood swings_ very emotional was the one month I tried a generic. Brand is much more expensive but for me was worth every penny.,F,50,8  years,6/20/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
453, 1, DOCTOR RECOMMENDED.,IRREGULAR PERIODS_ WEIGHT GAIN_ SEVERE DIZZYNESS_ NAUSIA_ HOT FLASHES_ FATIGUE_ ACNE.,I HATE THIS BIRTH CONTROL!!!  FIRST OF ALL---IVE ALWAYS HAD REGULAR PERIODS_ NO CRAMPING_ AND NO ACNE PROBLEMS. NOW WITH THIS BIRTH CONTROL_ IN THE FIRST 3 MONTHS-I STARTED GETTING ACNE ON MY NECK_ BACK_ AND FACE..AND I WOULD HAVE TWO PARIODS: ONE IN THE MIDDLE AND ONE AT THE END. (I JUST FIGURED MY BODY NEEDED TO GET USED TO THIS BC_ AND IGNORED THIS ISSUE.  THEN_ THE PAST 2 MONTHS I HAVE HAD NO PERIOD AT ALL.  I TOOK TWO PREGNANCY TESTS RIGHT AWAY AND BOTH CAME UP NEGATIVE. (THIS ALONE IS FREAKING ME OUT BECAUSE I'VE NEVER MISSED A PERIOD EVER...AND THIS IS A BIT UNNERVING). ALSO_ I'VE GAINED TEN POUNDS IN TWO MONTHS!!!  BUT THE WORST THING IS THE DIZZYNESS_ FATIGUE_ AND HOTFALSHES.  AT RANDOM TIMES MY EYES WILL START GETTING FUZZY_ I WILL FEEL NAUSIOUS_ GET VERY DIZZY_ GET DISORIENTED_ AND GET BAD HOT FLASHES AS IF I HAD JUST JUMPED INTO A HOT TUB.  IT IS HORRIBLE...AND RECENTLY HAS GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE.  ITS TO THE POINT THAT I HAD TO CALL OFF OF WORK.   NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM THROWING THESE PILLS AWAY---I GAE THEM ALMOST 6 MONTHS AND THESE PAST SIX MONTHS HAVE BEEN THE WORST EVER PHYSICALLY. IM GETTING BACK ON YASMIN 28I WAS ON THAT FOR A WHILE AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY.   	,F,24,5  months,6/17/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
454, 5, to prevent pregnancy and cramps,No side effects,PLEASE READ!!!!!Female age 20 95lbs This is the first pill i was perscribed from my doctor due to the fact I have a tiny frame 5'2 and low weight. I took the trial packets and LOVED THEM!!!!!!Unfortunatly I switched to Microgestin 1/20 which is a lesser dosage than Loestrin 1/20... Switching was easier on the budget but the worst on my side effects.1) I rarely have a sex drive2) I missed one pill and my cycle started again3) longer heavier period4) bloating and cramps.Im my opinion spending a little more money on Loestrin 1/20 is worth it to me.I never worried about getting prego when I took it_ and now because I'm so irregular I worry about it all the time.There are alot of bad reviews here but honestly I have had a good experience with it =),F,20,5  months,6/11/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
455, 3, birth control,extreme irritability_ depression_ acne (and I don't get acne)_ unable to sleep through night,I took this in my 20s and was fine. Now that I've started again I'm getting a whole new batch of side effects. Will stick with it for 2 months to see if mood problems and depression go away. I won't be able to continue if it affects me like this.,F,38,3  weeks,6/11/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
456, 1, Birth Control,yeast infection_ moodiness_ breakout of skin,Only been on it for a week and I'm throwing the rest away.  I was perfectly fine for 9 years on OrthoCyclen. Been years since I had a yeast infection_ I'm normally an annoyingly happy person and I have nothing else to attribute moodiness to other than this stupid pill.  I hate it_ I'd rather be pregnant.,F,29,8  days,6/9/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
457, 5, Heavy periods and birth control,I have been on it for yr and I spot from time to time (not too often) I have been very pleased up until recently. I am not sure if it is the pill or just life_ I feel sad/depressed and have been getting some add'l break thru bleeding and cramping. I am going to continue for one more month.,My dr said to try to incorporate a few addition vitamins while taking this bc pill_ 2000mg of vitamin C for break thru bleeding and complex B for mood swings. I hope this helps. But I am overall happy with this pill,F,29,1  years,6/8/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
458, 5, no babies!,No periods_ weight loss aid_ thinning hair,I like this pill; I've been on over a dozen in the last 15 years - the last several gave me such horrible breast tenderness that it's become my sign to change pills. I don't like that my hair is thinning - but I have no idea if it's from this pill. I also joined Weight Watchers_ and have lost 15 lbs - and I've been trying to do that FOREVER. There is very little effort involved for some reason! Again_ no idea if it's a side effect of this pill.,F,33,6  months,6/8/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
459, 3, Ovarian polyps_ irregular bleeding,Extreme fatigue_ lack of concentration_ no sex drive_ hair loss_ first no periods at all and now they are completely irregular.,I noticed the extreme fatigue and lack of concentration within a week of taking Loestrin.  I pushed through since I wanted to give it a chance and eventually it got a little better - although I never really felt like myself.  After about 9 or 10 months I started to have very irregular periods.  My Dr. said to go off the pill for one month and go back on.  The month I was off was fabulous!  After 3 weeks back on I was back to irregularity and absolutely no energy.  I made an appointment to get my pill changed.,F,33,1.5  years,6/8/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

461, 2, Birth control,fatigue_ depression_ weight gain_ swelling in feet and ankles_ breast tenderness_ ZERO sex drive,I took it for about six months_ and even though my period was much lighter_ I felt bloated_ fat_ and could practically never reach climax with my boyfriend.  My breasts constantly hurt_ and my ankles and feet would swell up as though I had sprained them.,F,27,6  months,6/3/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

463, 1, ovarian cysts,headaches_ dizziness_ nausea_vomiting_general malaise_unclear thinking_backache_overall felt terrible and unable to function.,symptoms began at day 10 of taking loestrin fe 1/20 and continue to persist. I have not been able to go to school because the dizziness and headaches are so bad. No one seems to believe that this pill could cause me to feel so terrible. I am tired of feeling this way and being told that they don't know why I am so sick. I hope that someone can help me. I am 14 years old and my life sucks.,F,14,15  days,6/2/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
464, 4, acne,moodiness and emotional_ spotting_ breast enlargement and tenderness_ lighter periods_ hungry all the time,i love the pill so far i havent seen any difference in the acne but the periods are so light and short and i keep thinking im pregnant with all the symptoms but its great,F,16,6  weeks,6/1/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
465, 3, avoid pregnancy,So far_ headaches throughout the day_ extremely tired_ lack of appetite_ acne_ tingling in the legs_ spotting.,I have only started taking this pill for 3 weeks now_ and am hoping that most of these side affects will go away. I got it to avoid pregnancy and also for my extremely bad cramps. However Im already feeling cramps early...I'm going to give it at least a 3 month trial.,F,25,3  weeks,6/1/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
466, 3, birth control,hardly any sex drive_ EXTREME mood swings_ breast tenderness_ weight gain_ acne,I've been taking this for over a year now_ and at first it was great. One thing I can't complain about are the periods... hardly worth calling a period_ without any cramps. However_ it's definitely causing some problems with my relationship with my boyfriend as I get upset at him for absolutely no reason it seems like_ and I'm so emotional_ I cry at just about everything! I've been feeling depressed_ and have NO SEX DRIVE... that really gets me. I don't want my boyfriend feeling like I'm not interested in him. I also started breaking out about 4 months into starting it and havn't been able to stop it. I'm switching to ortho tricyclen or desogen next month.,F,19,1  years,5/29/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

468, 3, Endometriosis,extreme breast tenderness_ complete loss of libido,I started taking this because I have horribly painful_ heavy periods due to endometriosis.  I am skipping over the placebos (the brown pills) for three months and in the fourth month I will take them.  The goal is for me to eventually have only three periods a year.  I have had some mild spotting.  Within two weeks of beginning this pill my breast size increased significantly_ which I love_ but they are very sore all the time.  The only big problem I am experiencing is that I have NO sex drive.  At all.  I have struggled with depression in the past and was very nervous when I started reading up on side effects - many women reported suicidal depression.  I have not noticed any feelings of sadness - I'm just ANNOYED because my boyfriend and I used to have a very healthy sex life and now I have no desire to have sex!,F,30,6  weeks,5/26/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
469, 4, irregular periods_ birth control..,I was on it for about a year_ maybe a little more. At first I gained a little weight_ was really moody and then it actually got a lot better. I got up to about 140 pounds_ I am 5'5 and only 18 years old_ so for me it was heavy. (small boned) around jan. of 09 I started losing weight for no reason because of loss of appetite. I am now down to 115 and feel so good. I also lost the moodiness after a little bit. I just got off it though because my periods began really irregular again! I am now on nuva ring and I indeed have my appetite back. SO I know it was the pill that made me lose 25 pounds! overall I liked this pill! You erally have to try it for a little for your body to get used to it. I do know that with loestrin you get the same dose of hormone everday so as far as irritabilty_ fatigue_ crankiness_ that should all not really happen with this pill.I dont know you have to try it for yourself!! EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT OBVIOUSLY!!,,M,18,1.5  years,5/20/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
470, 5, ,a little bit of breast tenderness,I haven't experienced any negative side effects from Loestrin.

I also even GAINED a little bit of weight. On Loestrin_ however_ my skin has always been clear_ my periods short and light_ my sex drive/mood/weight stable_ etc.,F,19,6  years,5/17/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
471, 4, Birth Control,Slight weight gain.. just water retention. Mild headaches,I've tried YAZ_ Otho Tri-Lo_ Yasmin... all gave me serious mood swings and migranes. So far nothing like that has happened on this pill. No major weight gain. I just gave birth 5 months ago and am down below my pre preg weight.,F,22,90  days,5/13/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
472, 2, Heaving Bleeding,Moodiness_ Depression_ diarrhea_ heavy bleeding still_ bloating and fatigue.,I have been taking this pill now for almost 4 months and still I have not seen any improvement.  My period is still heavy when I am on the brown pills.  Isn't the pill suppose to stop the bleeding.  I think that I need a BC with higher estrogen even if I am petrified of taking a pill with a higher dose of estrogen.  If my period is still rushing heavy for this month while i'm on the brown pills i'm off the pills!!! It's not worth it especially if it's not working!!,F,27,4  months,5/11/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

All of the aforementioned symptoms were severe and effected my DAILY activities.,"I have been diagnosed with endometriosis at age 15 and have tried so many different treatments_ with no relief.  This medication did have one good outcome:  periods that were light and lasted 3 days or less.  However_ the side effects that I have experienced have been severe and affected me every day.  The worst side effect was the decreased libido.  Not only did I not respond to any stimulation_ I was also unable to have an orgasm.  The mood swings affected my job performance and relationships.  I felt like I had the flu so many times.  The nausea forced me to change my eating habits.  Yet_ my body is swollen all over_ and I have gained weight very quickly.  The main reason my doctor prescribed this medication was to treat severe pain from endometriosis.  My pain has NOT decreased at all.  And the side effects from this medication is NOT worth a shorter period.  The ""remedy"" is worse than the disease.",F,30,3  months,5/9/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

Regular break through bleeding but very weak periods. Nightmares_ trouble sleeping. I've gone physically and mentaly downhill since I started this pill. It never occured to me that I could be having side effects until I came to this site. I almost cried thinking that perhaps I'm not losing my mind. I've thrown the pills in the garbage. Now I just want to know how long it will take to get out of my system. My husband kept saying_ what's happening to you_ your not yourself these days. I've had bursts of anger and severe crashes in the afternoons. It's been a horrible few months!!!,,F,40,6  months,5/8/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

477, 2, Excrutiating Monthly Cramps,Moodiness_ weight gain_ trouble sleeping.,"Second time I've been on Loestrin.  The first time I was on for 3 months and stopped taking it because of EXTREME moodiness_ including mood swings_ raging anger and intense depression (think crying while driving for no reason).  That was over 2 years ago and I let my gyno convince me that those symptoms weren't Loestrin-related.  My monthly cramps are so horrible_ I tried it again.  6 weeks in and I'm quitting them.  Weight gain_ despite eating very healthy and working out daily.  Acne_ worse than usual.  Wild moodiness - so ""down"" that I want to sleep through the day.

478, 2, pregnancy prevention,breast tenderness_ decreased sex drive_ missed periods,I took this bcp for so long that I did not realize it was the cause of my decreased sex drive.  I thought I had just changed emotionally over time_ until I read that loestrin can cause decreased sex drive. Three months ago I quit taking it and now I am back to normal.  The breast tenderness went away after a couple of months_ and I actually didn't mind the missed periods very much! The decreased (almost non-existent) sex drive_ though_ is not acceptable.,F,23,18  months,5/3/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
479, 1, birth control,dizziness_ extreme fatigue_ anxiety_and an all-around ill feeling similar to the first few months of pregnancy_ including spotting and menstrual-like cramps.,I actually spent money on a few trips to the doctor thinking I was pregnant or ill_ but it was never brought to my attention that it may be side effects of my birth control.  They set in about 2 weeks after being prescribed the medicine and never got better.,F,24,2  months,5/3/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

I have gained 7 lbs in a little less than a month_ am depressed_ more anxious (got to admit I always was a little anxious)_ irritable_ decreased sex drive.  I haven't felt this horrible in years.  I actually went to the dr to discuss going back on an antidepressant and just randomly started searching online about loestrin fe side effects while I was waiting and now I'm waiting to see if I'll feel normal soon. I threw this pill in the garbage. Thanks so much for all the comments.  Hope I feel better soon.,,M,27,4  weeks,4/30/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

My periods were short and very light and I had no more moodiness or PMS symptoms. I then stopped taking it about 6 months ago in order to go through natural menopause. That was a mistake! I was not in menopause yet and started having very heavy_ painful_ irregular periods.

After being suicidal for reasons I cannot even fathom_ I woke up one morning and it occured to me that these feelings started right about the time I went on this stupid BCP.  I stopped taking it immediately.  My periods have always been miserable but I'm just going to spend my money on Midol and take my life back.  This is VERY dangerous medication.",F,40,90  days,4/22/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
487, 4, Mood swings,I've had a little nausea and break-through bleeding (very light). Acne has been bad_ but I expect it to clear up.  Only been on it for three weeks now_ so I'm hoping the acne and nausea go away!  Had my tubes tied_ so not worried about the break-through bleeding.,All pills work differently for people_ so give it a chance.  I don't like being nauseous once a week_ and I definitely don't like the acne_ but I know it's just my body trying to adjust after not being on pills for over a year.,F,37,14  days,4/21/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
488, 1, Regulate periods,Mood swings intensified. Anxiety.  Headaches. Weight gain.  The only thing it did was stop my periods.,My periods have always been regular & mood swings were pretty normal. My periods became irregular & I had some bouts of crying just prior to being prescribed this pill.  I've had anxiety issues so I was prescribed Cymbalta at the same time.  My anxiety went away but I became depressed_ had wild dreams_ felt like I never got any sleep.  Since I've been off the cymbalta_ my anxiety has returned and my mood swings are really intense.  I also get headaches now.  I went OB/GYN @  4 mo check-up and she said I need a Shrink. Slap in the face. I wish I found this sight earlier because maybe I should have quit the BCP and stayed on the cymbalta.  I am seeing my regular family practitioner tomorrow & will update.  I am going off this BCP today!!!  I can deal with having a period - not all the other issues.,F,45,4  months,4/16/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

About 8 months ago started a rigorous workout routine and would getting spotting almost everyday of the week. The first 1 1/2yrs were okay with no spotting and light periods_ the last 6mths I've need estrogen pills to stop the bleeding. I went off Loestrin last month to start trying for another child.

I'm starting it tomorrow and I almost cried after reading all these reviews! Some of my friends are on this pill and their skin has cleared up_ they've LOST weight_ and they are doing fine. I'm hoping that's what happens to me too. I think it's important to remember that most people who take the time to write a detailed review of a medication have something NEGATIVE to say - there are plenty of women out there that are content with their BCP_ and don't feel the need to write an encouraging review about it. Keep the faith_ girls ;).,F,21,0  days,4/11/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

No weight gain and my sex drive is just fine.,I was actually ready to go out and get a pregnancy test and go to my GYN because for the second month my period has been practically nonexistent. It's more like a light discharge for two or three days than a period. I may still get one just to put my mind at ease_ but after reading some of the comments here it sounds like it is pretty normal.

Once I stopped the pills_ it took about 2 months to get them out of my system.  I read this website BEFORE taking them_ and gave them a try anyway.  Now I'm back to say they didn't work for me.  And to warn anyone taking them...and feeling really bad...to call your doctor and change to a different type of pill.  Each person's body reacts differently to different hormone combinations_ so something else might better suit you.

I can't live like this. The first month wasn't bad as I remember. I had a little nausea and spotted a little at first_ but I didn't feel too bad. The second full month I had severe breast tenderness that got to the point where I couldn't lay on my stomach to sleep! I noticed my weight beginning to change a litte_ and had a few mood swings but continued taking it. By the third month_ my stomach was swelling and my clothes didn't fit right. I took 2 pregnancy tests and wasn't pregnant. Then the mood swings_ obsession_ and depression kicked in and it took a while for me to connect the dots. Then I started my 4th month_ and got a period 2 weeks later and gained more weight_ localized in my stomach_ very strange. I have been exhausted this last pack_ all the time_ and my moods are so unpredictable_ it finally scared me into stopping today- mid pack.

So I kept taking it and started drinking a lot of water throughout the day. The nausea is getting so bad and I think I want to stop taking it. It's worse than the morning sickness I got when I was pregnant. In addition_ I am always tired. I am fighting extreme fatigue. It's affecting my work.

Spend more money on pregnancy tests than i do on the birth control itself.  Good if you don't want a period every month.  Bad if you don't like being an emotional wreck because you think you're pregnant.  It works great when taken corretly_ ultimately i'm never pregnant_ but i like re-assurance every month of a cyle.,F,26,10  months,3/11/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

For the past 3 days now I'm experiencing very low abdominal pain (just above the pubic bone region) and pain in the same area during sex. My sex drive is nonexistant but it was that way before when I was on Trivora. My face is breaking out horribly. I breakout at ovulation time and at period time. I still broke out last week even though I didn't get my period. And breakouts last for weeks_ the zits just won't go away. I'm very moody the week before my cycle is due as well.

I do take Loestrin 24Fe.I was put on this by my doctor after he and I became fully aware that the lower does of estrogen make my body feel terrible.

I don't ""break"" for my period as my OBGYN said it is not needed and I never experience a problem with bleeding.The only amazing thing Lo FE is that in the 3 weeks I have been taking it I have not had a single migraine - which is shocking since I have 3-6 migraines a month. Has anyone tried Seasonale? Anyone taken Ortho 777?",F,40,3  weeks,2/5/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
531, 5, menorrhagia_ dysmenorrhia,Nothing major. I think I may hold 2 lbs of water weight_ but it's hard to tell.,After about 6 months_ my period dramatically decreased in frequency and flow. I have been on the pill for 9 years now. My breasts are a little larger_ and I almost never get a period. Keep in mind that every women is different. This pill works great for me and some women_ and not so well for others. You really have to give it a try for yourself.,M,25,9  years,1/29/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

533, 4, Birth Control,Breast size increased_ quit getting my period,I really like this pill. I have been on different forms of the pill for about 10 years and this is the best I have tried. It didn't make me gain weight or feel constantly bloated like some_ and I don't get crazy PMS either. After 6 months of taking this_ I quit getting my period. Freaked out at first_ but after a pregnancy test and my doctor confirmed that this was normal_ no more period is fine by me!,F,25,8  months,1/26/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
534, 4, Cramping_ prevent pregnancy.,Stomach cramping accompanied by symptoms alternating between diarrhea and constipation at the rate of perhaps once every two months_ vaginal dryness_ decreased sex drive.,This is the only pill I've ever taken and I haven't had any major problems with it. I've experienced shorter_ noticeably lighter periods with no spotting or irregular bleeding. The only problems I've had are minor in comparison to what I used to go through with my cramps every month. Now_ once in a while_ I feel a little sick to my stomach a few days before my period_ and whatever I eat goes right through me_ but that is the worst that I experience. These symptoms are infrequent and easy to handle. I have noticed that it takes a little longer to become aroused and to reach orgasm_ if at all. But as far as alleviating the cramping symptoms for which I take the pill_ I am satisfied.,F,19,1  years,1/23/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20

Everything was great except for the breakthrough bleeding_ and 3 weeks of that each month_ even though it was fairly light_ was just too much.  Called the doctor and switched brands.  We'll see how that one goes.,F,15,3  months,1/15/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
537, 1, Prevent pregnacy;regulate periods,Migranes_ nausea_ mood swings_ vaginal dryness_ severe leg pains,Stopped using orth-tricyclen because gyno said loestrin was lower in hormones but side effects were bad. Unbearable headaches during periods so I stopped taking it. After I stop taking it_I had severe leg pains off and on for 3 weeks. Since then my mood swings have stopped_ no more headaches_ and the pain in my legs have finally stopped.

541, 3, prevent pregnancy,bloating_ light periods_ breakthrough bleeding_ fatigue_ increased vaginal moisture,I was happy with ortho-tri-lo_ but this pill is free under my health insurance. So I switched and since then I have yet to have a normal cycle. I start my period sometimes a full week before I should_ and then it lasts the full time. Just recently It started two weeks early_ and then when I was supposed to get it my period (if you can call it that) lasted hardly a day. I'm always tired and feel like I've gained weight. However I seem to have an increased libido which doesn't help since I never know when I'm going to be spotting! I haven't had problems with nausea unlike some other pills I've taken. I still want to go back to problem free ortho-tri-lo_ but I can't really afford it now.,F,24,3  months,1/8/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
542, 2, Birth Control,break through bleeding started on the 7th pill. Nausea usually a couple of hours from taking the pill. Lots of breast tenderness,The Pros are; my breast size increasesd_ increase in sexual desire_ clear skin_ and no effect on my mental make-up..I will continue to take the pills including the second pack..Hopefuly my breakthrough bleeding will disapper..But I do keep this in mind.I started taking these pills at 5 weeks post partum without starting my period. so maybe thats where the breakthrough bleeding is coming from..,F,25,16  days,1/7/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
543, 2, Endometriosis_ bad pms symptoms,severe headaches_ dizziness_ nauseu_ severe stomach cramping and diarrhea_,This medication did regulate my period and it gave me very light periods.

And I can not stand it_ I would tell anyone to stay away from it. My first full cycle on the pill I bled constantly and now here in almost month three I have had no period for almost a month_ I still insist on using back up birth control because what this stuff has done to me I do not trust it one bit_ and first thing Monday I am going to get my Nuva Ring and throw this stuff in the garbage.,F,22,2  months,1/1/2009,Loestrin fe 1/20
545, 4, Birth control,Breast tenderness_ slight weight gain after starting_ light or no period,I've been taking the generic Microgestin FE for the last 3 years. Prior to this_ I took Mircette for two years. Due to frequent spotting_ my doctor suggested Loestrin. Having light/no period is great!,F,36,3  years,12/31/2008,Loestrin fe 1/20
546, 5, Painful periods,VERY light periord_,I am taking the real brand microgestion.  I only pay 8 dollars a month.  They are awesome.  This is the only birthcontrol pill I have ever taken.  I was worried about weight gain but had none.  I have VERY light periods. Usually a pantyliner will do.  GREAT.  I Have no perior pains at all.  I would recondmend to everyone.,F,22,1  years,12/29/2008Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
547, 3, bc and to balance low hormones,I thought the only side effects were larger_ more sensitive breasts... which was kind of weird. Not bad_ but not necessarily good_ either. It raised my blood pressure into a normal range_ and meant I could stop the progesterone cream I was taking.,HOWEVER: I've recently had almost a month of life-threatening despair and depression. Really_ the most horrible ever. Suicidal. Only tonight did I remember that it could be from this drug. I was only going to try it for three months then go off it to compare_ but other stressors and trauma made my gyn and I decide to stay on for a bit longer. It's been six months now. I'm stopping this tomorrow to see if the depression is being caused or increased by this pill.

548, 4, birth control and regulate periods,mild breast growth_ semi-random spotting/bleeding_ slightly slimier feeling in the vaginal region_ increased blood pressure (95/60 to about 118/77)_ less painful/disruptive periods_ more emotional,After a lot of frustration with irregular periods that interfered with school (bad cramping_ nausea_ heavy bleeding) and eliminating all other possible causes_ I started this... plus this would make for an excellent back-up to the condom in case something went wrong there.  Overall it's been pretty good to me by making my periods a lot more tolerable -- I'd rather take the 5 day light/moderate period than the 8-9 day mega-period.  I do get some spotting when I'm under a lot of stress and/or take my pill more than a few hours late but having to keep pantiliners around beats the dreaded week of pain and depression.  I haven't had any of the major problems many others have reported but I'll admit it's not perfect either.,F,29,1  years,12/23/2008,Loestrin fe 1/20

Having a period TWICE a month and using an ENTIRE box of tampons and pads is not normal. This last month was the worst_ I bled for 17 days during the ACTIVE pills with no end in sight. I couldn't stand the cramping and the bleeding so I stopped taking the medication. My period is still going strong (day 19) and I am begining to wonder if it will ever stop.,F,30,3  months,12/23/2008,Loestrin fe 1/20

I always had this sense of a ""white noise"" in my head - hard to explain - but as soon as I quit the pill_ I have such a sense of peace in my head - MUCH calmer - no migraines either.  With the migraines_ I would lose my vision and feeling in my arms and hands.  Also_ my legs hurt so badly_ I was always yelling at my husband and daughter (who is now 4) if they touched my legs or ankles.  When I quit the pill_ I was in the bathroom 1-to-2 time per hour for 2 days (not exaggerating either) because of the amount of water retention.  This pill almost pushed me over the edge.  Thank GOD I took myself off of it.  I will NEVER go back on this pill again.  Did I mention NO sex drive - none.  Now. . . much better!",F,34,4  years,12/22/2008,Loestrin fe 1/20

I thought that it was just a temporary thing_ so I continued to take this pill.  After 2 months of taking it_  the acne went away_ my weight gain was all lost_ I was my usual happy self again.  My periods were extremely light though.  I always wore light tampons because it was so light!  Kind of annoying.  Other than that_ I enjoy this pill.

It's definitely taking a toll on my social life_ so I'm no longer taking it.,,F,18,2  months,10/13/2008,Loestrin fe 1/20

582, 4, contraception,Maybe a bit more acne (or just didn't help acne_ as I had hoped); light or no periods (which I like!).,Loestrin does have a slightly high progestin level compared to Tri-Cyclen and some others(increased progestin can cause depression)_ but I switched to it after trying Yasmin (about 4x higher in progestin - made me cry at random over tiny things!) so it was great for me. I've been on it for 3 years now and am pretty happy with it. My moods have been normal_ my periods are super-light_ no noticeable effects on libido_ no changes in appetite/GI function.

Other than that...Some mood swings_ irregular period_ nothing major otherwise.,I was on this pill for about 7-8 months and had irregular periods and some minor side effects. I kept hearing that this pill might stop my period all together so when I didn't get a period I didn't flinch. I was taking my pills faithfully and had been on b.c for many years without any issues. Then my reg physician suggested I take a preg test and I said_ 'what for?' anyway_ found out I was pregnant with 3rd child at age 39!! My OBGYN said no b.c. pill is 100% but that these low dose ones are even less protective. So now she tells me!

It made me very moody_ severely depressed and had constant suicidal thoughts_ which I never used to have.  I also had headaches for several days_ and low sex drive.  I didn't always get my period on the day I was supposed and one time my period lasted 8 days_ and it really didn't help with my cramps.  I used to take Ovcon-35 and the only complaint I had with that birth control was migrane headaches and weight gain (due to always being hungry)_ other than that Ovcon-35 was great.,,F,39,6  months,9/25/2008,Loestrin fe 1/20

Decreased libido.  I used to take Logynon and had no major side effects.  Going back on Logynon.

I would give any pills 3 months to kick in.,Great generic pill! I would recommend it to anyone but everyone's body is different and responds to different pills differently. The best thing is the hardly no period_ not much of a weight gain which I was afraid of and the cost is only  around $18.00 a month instead of $50.00.,F,44,180  days,9/19/2008,Loestrin fe 1/20

Since then I have been EXTREMELY bloated_ want to eat everything in sight_ have NO sex drive whatsoever_ have had headaches_ and the most SEVERE mood swings I've seen since my Ortho-Tri Cyclen Lo days. I have hated MYSELF these past few months. It's THAT bad. Even my Wellbutrin couldn't level my emotions/depression and anger out. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who has been used to taking a higher level of estrogen birth control pill. I am an 8 year Ortho Tri Cyclen user and loved it. I then started taking the generic Tri-Sprintec and had the worst migraines ever. I will never take generic birth control again. I will pay full price before I do that again. Nor can I take Orth-Tri Cyclen Lo. I had the same symptoms I'm experiencing with Loestrin due to the low dose of estrogen. I'm going back to Yaz_ I had no weight gain_ and felt great on it!

I've woken up with headaches every morning since I started taking it (I take it at 9pm) and I'm always tired. I've noteiced I don't sleep well unless I go to bed near midnight_ and theat gets me five or six hours instead of eight or nine_ which my life demands. I forgot to take it one night_ and took it the next morning--it was the worst day ever. I was exhausted_ my mind was foggy_ my head hurt_ nuasea_ you name it_ i had it. I noticed my boobs started to hurt and had gotten harder yesterday. I've also gotten my first ""breakthrough"" bleed which is basically a regular period with bad cramps (thankfully_ not the worst I've ever had). The one night I forgot to take it_ I slept SO GOOD that night. I had no fatigue the next day_ and before I took the pill (a whole thirty minutes) I could think clearly.

I feel better about taking a low-dose birth control_ even though it is much more expensive than my prior birth control. My weight and sex drive haven't been affected at all -- in fact_ I'm having daily sex for the first time in my life.

Blurred vision_ migraine headaches.  Worst side effect was that my internal monitor that would normally make me realize something was wrong wasn't working. It wasn't until I read this site that I realized I was actually experiencing side effects - I had been blaming myself for being lazy and thought my relationships just weren't working. It is scary thinking one can lose one's sense of reality so quickly.,Stopped after four months and the week after had terrible PMS and hormone fluctuations/uncontrollable mood swings.

After getting on this pill_ I began to lose weight_ and my periods became almost non existent. While I am very emotional and anxious_ I don't believe it is due to the pill because I remember being like this long before.

Nausea. Missed period.,After two weeks_ I went to see a pharmacist who recommended washing my skin with an oil free soap and moisterising with E45.

Then following the birth of my children in 1994 and 1996 I turned into a screaming shouting monster_ my husband and children could not do anything right_ I have a 20 year history of depression anyway and I thought I was going completely mad. I attended a PMT clinic as I only had 2 days per month without PMT!! over the next 2 years they tried allsorts including HRT_ antidepressants etc but nothing worked_ finally my GP suggested Losetrin 20 due to its low levels of hormones as each time I had an Oestrogen test it was either on the floor or up to the sky.  At that point I would have tried anything.

I do get a yeast infection every month as a side effect of the pill and take over the counter oral herbs (AZO Yeast) to prevent them from being bad.

I'm totally not myself. I'm glad I found this site because I thought something was wrong with me_ but after reading the other's comments I can see that I'm experiencing the same side effects they have.

I was on the generic microgestrin for almost a year during which time I experienced constant headaches_ EXTREME mood swings (depression to EXTREME RAGE)_ as well as INSANE FOOD CRAVINGS(followed by weight gain) but chalked it up to my stressful job_ lack of sleep_ coupled with raising 2 active little boys.  Then I read the reviews that the generic was NOT the same. I'm on my third pack of Loestrin FE 1/20 and so far I love it.

OF COURSE YOU WILL HAVE SIDE-EFFECTS IN THE FIRST 3 MONTHS_ but you need to wait those first 3 to pass until your body can become balanced again. My body stabilized itself again completely during my fourth month on Loestrin.  Those months were hell sometimes_ but it has definitely been worth it.

However_ within the end of the 2nd through the 4th weeks of taking Loestrin I began waking up with intense pressure on my temples and it felt like I had a huge hole in my heart. I mean I was really feeling uneasy on a consistent basis. I really thought I was undergoing depression. I became worried about everything and I didn't know where it was all coming from. 2 days ago I had a severe breakdown in the shower with INTENSE bawling and shaking. Within the last week and a half I began questioning my relationship with my boyfriend! something I hadn't done before. I feel like dying to get rid of this anguish and dread. I thought it was me! But then I came across this site and I have to say I'm a bit relieved. I know that the docs say to take the pill for at least a month and side effects will diminish.

This depression actually cost me my job.  This isn't worth it.  I only wish I would have figured it out sooner.  I put stress on my relationships with loved ones_ and my toddler son suffered.  Within 2 days of stopping the medication I felt a difference_ after 1 week I was a brand new person.  Now_ 1 month later I feel good as new.  Please be careful.  Surely_ these side effects don't occur with everyone_ but be aware.  If you find yourself feeling this way....STOP!!  In a mere 27 days my life was turned upside down for this drug.

Im not as cranky and depressed_ and as for my Libido_ lets just say much better:).  So_ I came to the conclusion that each pill reacts differently with every women.  All my girlfriends on the pill complained of weight_ but me nothing.  And for that I am grateful.  So as of right now I have no complaints about this pill.,F,22,30  days,8/20/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

I was on it for about 18 months.  After 2/3 months my mood had completely changed and I thought I had depression (I had it before and had recently come off Anti-D's) so went to the doc.  I questioned whether it could be the pill and was assured Loestrin 20 was the mildest dose of pill you could take and that he didn't think it could be that_ so I stayed on it because I needed birth control and stupidly believed the doctor.  So on I went from September to February until I couldn't take it any more.  I could not function_ I was always crying_ getting upset_ irrationaly angry_ I was completly insecure in my relationship and myself and  thought I was going insane.  I came off the pill.

Although it did both of those things_ it certainly wasnt worth the additional side effects of weight gain_ larger breasts (they were big enough!) and awful mood swings that made me wondering what the hell was going on. I am SO glad I've read the comments on this site_ now I dont feel like its just me since my doc raved about Loestrin.

The one benefit_ my sex drive is through the roof!,I was on loestrin fe 1.5/30 for 12 years to control a cyst that made my periods heavy and irregular. My doctor retired and my new OB thought at 43 and because I take 5m norvasc for hereditary HBP  I should switch to the low dose loestrin 1/20. I had my doubts as my other OB  said the loestrin 1.5 would be consistant with keeping the cyst away  my periods regulated and he said that the lower dose often doesn't help cysts and that I might have spotting issues too. Well 9 months later I still have spotting and now pain I suspect the cyst is back. This dose makes me crave sweets which I don't eat I am vegan so I control my weight just fine.  I'm very moody and thank god my family has been understanding. I was never moody on the higher dose so I will be switching back to loestrin fe 1.5,F,43,9  months,8/14/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

My emotions are flying off the hook. I assumed a lot of my feeling sick was because of the flu I had in January or the staph infection I had last August_ but now that I can see everyone else is in the same boat as me. Loestrin FE was pretty good to me_ excluding a few head aches or stomach aches. My Microgestin has me climbing walls. I had to get off the pill because for 6 months I only got my period 4 times_ and my body is usually on the clock and I had NEVER missed a period in all my life. Then I missed 2-3 in a row_ so I got off it for a month_ just to make sure. Sure enough my body was back on schedule. Then I got back on and I've been a mess.

My hair is falling out at an intense rate_ my breasts have gone up a cup size_ I have breakthrough bleeding-bleeding on week two and week four every month.  I have absolutely NO sex drive.  I know I just had a baby_ but there is more to it than that.  But the main side effect that I just cannot deal with is the INTENSE HEADACHES!!!  I have to go home from work at least once a week because the headaches are so intense.  They are like migraines_ when light and sound are just too painful to be around.

Thank you all for this information_ because I am never taking another one of these pills. One question - has anyone else had severe gas as a result of Loestrin FE? I am not making a joke. I fart constantly (for the first time in my life) and it just occurred to me that it might be these pills. I haven't seen anyone say this_ but maybe it's not just me. I'm stopping either way - the 15 pounds I've gained in the last 4 months is reason enough. That and the very irregular periods (I used to be able to set a clock by my 4-day periods; now I never know when they'll stop or start). I also would like to start being interested in sex with my husband again and stop snapping his head off over every little thing (which I never did before). He'd like that_ too.

Weight gain and leg swelling is one thing - looking bald on top of my head is not! If someone has had the same effect_ PLEASE post back and let me know if your hair grew back! I told my OBGYN and she claimed Loestrin will not have that side effect and advised me to stay on it but I'm getting concerned waking up with hair all over my pillow!,F,28,3  months,8/2/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

I feel bloated most of the time which is hard for me to tolerate becaue I am a very active and athletic female. Along with bloating I haven't had a period which is very unsettling.  I've been with my boyfriend for almost a year and not having a period is stressful and worriesome.  I have gone to the doctor to have a pregnancy test which was negative.

The ONE and ONLY reason I stopped taking this pill was due to breakthrough bleeding like clockwork the first pill of week 2 every month_ then obviously on the placebo week 4. I suffered NO mood swings/depression_ NO loss of sex drive_ NO bloating. I felt completely ""normal""_ as if I wasn't even taking the pill.

It has since been one year and I now weigh around 140 lbs. I should also mention that during this year on Loestrin_ I have been a college cheerleader which requires me to work out daily and maintain a regular_ healthy diet.

I really don't get this new pill though. As soon as I switched pills I have been bleeding contstantly... that was a week ago and it still shows no sign of stopping. Apart from that I have had some annoying headaches_ but otherwise it's OK. I just want the bleeding to stop.

THen spotting for the next 3 months which stopped after that. But then at about 6 months had no physical desires.  I got anxious and depressed and would have night wakings and early wakings. I got severely sleep deprived and anxious. I had to stop taking it. I had panic attacks and thought I was sick and dying. Then I realized it was probably the hormones and lack of testosterone in my body. Back to feeling like myself in about 6 weeks after stopping it. I feel mentally better now and I am sleeping all night. What a relief to stop taking it. Glad I didn't get meds for the anxiety when all I needed was to stop taking this pill.And it is possible these can increase cancer risk - not studied enough yet.,F,36,10  months,7/10/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

837, 3, Birth Control/Lighter Periods,Hair loss_ slight upset stomach,Overall this pill agreed with me because I used to have very heavy long periods. It decreased the bleeding A LOT and shortened my periods so that was great. After taking it for 5 months I noticed my hair is considerably thinner. I did some research and found out this pill is highly androgenic which means it can cause hair loss and acne in people prone to it. So now I have to find another pill. Otherwise_ I really liked it because of the low estrogen. I hate to stop taking it_ but thinning hair just isn't acceptable to me.,F,37,5  months,7/9/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

I was on Lo/Ovral 28 since I was 18 (almost 9 years)to control my heavy & irregular bleeding_ which it did.  However_ in the last year I started having wierd changes in moods that I could only identify as being hormonal. My OBGYN said I had grown a resistance to my old bc and switched me to this one. I am very concerned.  I have hardly been able to eat; I get nauseous every time after I eat.  There has been abdominal cramping; my varicose veins have been more prominent_ and I have skin irritations (red bumps_ not pimples) all over my chest and arms.  the loss of appetite and nausea are what are most alarming_ now even moreso_ because I noticed a few posts on here of women having nausea as a side effect as well.,F,26,1  months,7/6/2007Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
842, 2, contraceptive,disconnect from world_ sadness_ no libido (at all!)_ two periods a month_ easily irritated_ food cravings,I started taking this pill in January and I have had two periods a month every month_ except April.  My irritation_ separation for the world and lack of a sex drive are effecting my marriage.  This pill made it seem like I was PMSing all the time instead of helping!  I also had weird cravings as if I was pregnant!,F,25,7  months,7/6/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

After the third day I started feeling the side effects.  I feel like throwing up all the time.  I'm always either hungry_ nauseated_ or sleepy.  All I want to do is eat or lay around and I'm not as happy as I was before.  I've been feeling low and acting like a jerk.  I thought I could wait a little while to see if the side effects would seize_ but I don't want to feel like this every day and I'm afraid of gaining weight.

I went on this after having my daughter looking for something other than what I was on before just to change things up.  While on this pill my sex drive continually diminished until I was no longer interested at all.  I didnt feel like doing anything ever and was just tired all the time.

849, 1, Birth Control & PMS,HORRIBLE!  I have had the worst 2 1/2 weeks of my life since I started this pill: continual headaches alternating between regular headaches and migraines_ hard to see with the pain behind my eyes_ sinus pressure_ extreme fatigue to the point where I couldn't lift my arms and I ended up sleeping 3 days straight with being up for maybe 4 hours each day. I was confused_ also had insomnia_ horrible painful cystic acne.,All of this became so bad_ I went to the hospital because I got scared.  I had bloodwork done and do not have any illness that would cause such extreme fatigue_ such as mono or epstein barr or other problems with my general blood workup including white cell counts_ red cell counts_ the testing of all of my vitamin levels -- everything was fine!  I even had an MRI of my brain and an eye exam.  Everything is fine.  I even went to a neurologist.  Everything is fine except none of the medications to make the migraines and headaches go away are really working.  I am off the Loestrin 24 Fe now but the headaches haven't stopped.  Now I have to go on Topomax to attempt to prevent the headaches and migraines from starting in the first place.  Joy_ another chemical to put in my body.  This whole thing really really scares me.Then I find this site and listen to all of you other women victims of god knows what!!!

For someone who is sextually active_ the uncertainty of NOT getting your periods is not worth being on this pill.

I went from having very heavy periods lasting a full 5 to 7 days to practically having no period after just the first month of use.  With such a drastic change_ I called the doctor's office.  I'm at the end of my second pack and no period yet.  I took bc (Ortho Novum 777) years ago and didn't have any problems and periods were regular.  I never had spotting when I was on the pill then nor when I was off the pill and it was always on time.  I missed just one of these pills and had spotting a few days later.  Lately_ I have experienced  problems with catching my breath and noticed the difference in my heartbeat.  I didn't consider this as a side effect of the bc until I read another post about someone experiencing heart palpitations.  For me_ the disadvantages far out weigh the advantages and I'm not going to continue taking this pill.,F,33,2  months,6/20/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

I don't believe I will continue on with this to see if things get better.  This is the 10th BC pill I have tried and I think it will be my last.

My past birth control pills made me hungry all the time_ so I gained 20 pds_ some of it is water weight. My gyno put me on Loestrin as it helps keep weight off & even loose it. I have to say_ I finally do feel like I can control my eating. I'm actually loosing weight now_ so I'm very happy to be on my way to my ""normal"" weight.I have had no periods so far_ which is a scare_ but my sister is on it & she has the same thing. I'm just going to have to get comfortable that I may not have a period. I take it at the same time every day b/c it is such a low dose pill.

This one is the only one that I have been able to take thus far. I take it at noon every day and usually for a few hours after I tend to feel more moody so I have to try and control myself_ it's very minor thank God. I've noticed minor nausea but nothing major to interfere with my day. I don't get food cravings like others seem to experience and the best of all_ I went from a B to a C. Oh and I used to have cystic acne that I got rid of with medication 2 years ago and Loestrin brought it back which sucks because I'm getting married in 4 weeks.

But second week things were fine in terms of mood and period stopping. Third week slight cramps and spotting here and there.,I am actually taking Loestrin 1/24. I used to be on Yasmin but after 3 months I became extremely irritable_ moody and depressed - the boyfriend at that time thought I was a different person! Switched immediately after I realized it was because of Yasmin and felt much normal afterwords.Overall Loestrin is fine for me because it doesn't alter my mood as much as Yasmin did. The random spotting/bleeding here and there are tad annoying but again_ I would prefer that then severe mood swings that scare my loved ones away!,F,28,3  weeks,6/5/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

Within the first three months_ I gained 10 lbs_ then three months after_ I gained 12 lbs (22 lbs total) until I figured out the Loestrin Fe is to blame. I always had an active sex drive before_ but now I only want to have sex once every few months. Since this pill_ I've also had severe anxiety (borderline panic attacks) and depression.

Once I started this medication I bled for six-weeks straight_ with continuous and intense cramping 24/7.  I gained weight and was very depressed and emotional_ feeling that I had little control of my life.

If I watch the news and see something bad I immediatley think that it is going to happen to someone I love.  I can't take this anymore.  I have taken off work for three days.  I went to the doctor and was prescribed Celexa (lets hope it helps soon) because I am having panic attacks daily.  I am stopping this pill today.

I took this to help regulate my periods so that I did not have them as often and they weren't for as long.  It hasn't helped much. I have spotting to actual bleeding every other week. So far I haven't become pregnant which is the point I guess but I still have abnormal periods and weight gain.

888, 1, Very heavy periods before,Weight Gain_ terrible bloating,I was on loestrin 24 for 2 months and stopped it because I was training for a half marathon so I was exercising like a maniac and I still gained 8 pounds!  Since I stopped it 5 weeks ago_ I have lost the weight_ but I have yet to have had my time of the month and it's been 36 days since I stopped it.  I did a pregnancy test and it came back negative_ so maybe I am not going to have a period again this month even though I am not on it anymore.  The 2 months I was on it_ I barely had it at all but now that I am off_ I am surprised I haven't had one yet.  Anyone else had problems with it taking a while to start having a period again?  Light periods are nice_ but it's stressful thinking each month you might be pregnant when you barely have one or don't have one at all.,F,36,2  months,5/25/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
889, 3, contraceptive,many missed periods_ extremely light periods_ early periods_ cramps more often,ive been on this pill for about 10 months and im a little frustrated with it because (like many other women on this website) it seems liike i rarely get my period_ sometimes it wont come for 2 or 3 months and when it does its barely there. now i'm starting to get my period 2 weeks early. and i feel like i get cramps more often and at very strange times now. if you dont mind not getting your period this could be for you_ but i am not okay with missing a period and being paranoid for an entire month.,F,18,10  months,5/22/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

It hasn't even made me that moody.  I've just gain a LOT of weight - and considering that I took almost 50lbs of weight OFF_ this makes me want to cray all the time.

ABSOLUTELY NO mood effects_ which is the #1 priority for me since i have a history of severe depression and bipolar and eating disorders (though now in recovery for over 1 year.) i LOVE loestrin.,i was on ortho-novum for about 5 months_ i had daily awful vomiting spells.  usually when i woke up.  couldn't stop throwing up.  that was the first birth control i was ever on_ and it was a BAD experience.  oh_ also i usually had at least 2 weeks of periods each month. sometimes consecutive_ sometimes non-consecutive_ and with pretty bad cramps non-stop which i usually do not experience.  this caused me to sleep a LOT.  with the loestrin_ i had the spotting i mentioned but it was minimal_ no cramps_ no problem.  my mood feels 100% a-ok_ which it did not always with the ortho-novum.  (i had mood swings.) i have not reached the end of my first month yet_ but so far things are EXCELLENT.  i was worried i would have a worse experience if i switched pills_ but i'm so glad i did.  life was miserable on ortho-novum for me.  now i feel normal_ if not better.,F,23,15  days,5/7/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

I have been on this pill for just over a month_ so I've been trying to stick it out to see if the side effects go away_ but my boyfriend and I are about to break up because of my insane behavior (and I can't blame him). Within a couple days of starting this pill I started overreacting to and getting very emotional about the stupidest little things. Soon I started having the strongest and most random food cravings I've ever had (everything from brownies to tuna melts to onion rings_ and I don't even like onion rings). I actually thought I might be pregnant. I've gained 5 pounds because of the cravings and because I've been paralyzingly tired almost constantly. Then I started breaking out. Not badly_ just a couple of zits_ but I usually have completely clear skin. I've never had these kind of symptoms with other pills. I watch my behavior and know I'm acting crazy and not like myself but still feel irritable_,F,21,5  weeks,5/5/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

If my boyfriend is 2 hours late calling I feel like he hates me and get really sad. And I'm usually a really laid back person! I'm constantly tired and craving weird foods. now I'm starting to break out... basically I'm completely miserable. I know side effects often go away after a couple months but if I don't get off it now my relationship is going to end and that's the reason I started on it in the first place!,F,20,1  months,5/5/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

911, 1, Birth Control,Prescribed Loestrin 24 recently_ but after doing some research about it_ I've decided to stay with Ortho Tri-Cyclen.,People who take Loestrin should really read this website:http://www.wdxcyber.com/ncontr13.htm.The progestin (levongestrel) in this pill is VERY androgenic (meaning it acts like male hormones - testosterone).  Combine the progestin with the very low estrogen content in this pill and it's very likely you may have trouble with acne and possibly excess body hair.  Acne and body hair don't sound very attractive to me.,F,28,0  days,5/3/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

913, 4, Endometriosis,Acne break out_ some irritability_ headaches,I've never taken birth control before but due to my endometriosis my doctor put me on this one. She said it would help shrink the nodules in my uterus. At any rate_ aside from the daily headaches_ I have no complaints. I am not supposed to get my periods at all (or the nodules will grow)so I do not stop for the placebo pills. I continue with a new pack. I had breakthrough bleeding for almost a month before it finally stopped. And if I don't take the pill at 6 pm everyday regularly_ I get some bleeding the following day. I don't think it has increased my hunger or made me gain weight. It does help me to feel less crazy since I'm not PMSing at all.,F,28,90  days,5/2/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
914, 5, birth control,high blood pressure and some mood swings,I started this rx after I had my youngest son for a method of birth control and to regulate my cycles. I have had periods that are very light and come like clock work every month. I switched to Yasmin and had bad migraines from day one. The day I switched back they instantly went away. Not all birth controls are for everyone_ but this one is good for me.I have no complaints at all.,F,26,7  months,5/1/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
915, 4, exremely heavy bleeding 7 days,The first week...I had break through bleeding the first week. You have to take the pill at the same time everyday because you will have break through bleeding. When I first start taking a new birth control_ I experience nausea_ almost like morning sickness. I did not have any with this pill_ my cycle came and I only had to wear a pantyliner_ not a tampon. It was so light_ almost like spotting. My period only last 3 days_ and it is usually 7 days of heavy bleeding. I have not gained any weight_ nor have I had any of the other side effects.  It's great after_ I haven't had a pill like this since taking Ortho-Novum 7/7/7.,I think it is worth a try...I have no problems.,F,28,2  months,5/1/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
916, 3, Ovarian cysts,The pain I experienced from my ovarian cysts returned after two or three months_ plus I'm incredibly prone to moodiness and cry a lot more than usual. I also have break-through bleeding and I'm now beginning to have mild hallucinations and random bursts of pain in my arm_ but those might be from something else entirely.,The short periods were great_ I guess_ but my regular periods were normally pretty short to begin with. It was nice until I started to have break-through bleeding. I don't know if I would recommend this for_ if anyone_ especially someone my age.,F,16,5  months,4/30/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
917, 3, Heavy bleeding/hot & cold flashes,I have been taking Loestrin for 7 months now.  My doctor is making me come off it because: 1) huge weight gain (40 pounds); 2) uncontrollable high blood pressure; 3) slight depression since taking pill and just general bad press about hormones.,I loved the short (3 day) periods and no cramping.  Like others_ my face has broken out repeatedly where I normally have very nice skin.  I will miss the light periods but all the other side effects were too much to handle (especially @ my age),F,47,7  months,4/30/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
918, 5, Ovarian Cysts,When I started this pill I had nausea_ moodiness (overly sensitive) and stomach issues.  My hair has been thinning a little but I do not know if this is from the pill or the fact that I don't eat properly.,I had painful ovarian cysts (one on each ovary).  My doctor recommended this pill. I think this pill is great.  My cysts went away.  My period is very light now.  I no longer have pain.  I had side effects for the first three months.  Most of the negative comments are from people who wasn't on it for a while.  The inserts tell u about the side effects for the first three months.Your body has to adjust.  All of my initial side effects have disappeared. I am doing great with this pill.  I would recommend it.  Also_ while reading these comments...I think people should remember that every woman is different.  Some problems mentioned might be from other medical conditions and not the pill.  Also_ it could be the pill mixed with other medications.  People tend to notice things more when starting a new medication.  They could have had some of these problems the whole time.  If you try this pill_ reserve judgement until you make it through the fourth month.  Everyone's body is different.  What,F,30,7  months,4/27/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

So far_ I feel pretty normal on loestrin (microgestin_ generically) -more than I have in years_ as I have not been on any bc pills regularly. I'm a little concerned about the negative feedback_ but already feel this is working for me - I sure hope I am one of the minority.

I went to see the doctor and he said I was probably experiencing post partem depression eventhough by baby was 1 year old.  He even gave me some anti depressant medication which I didn't take because I have never been diagnosed with depression in all my life.  I now realize that it was a side effect from taking Loestrin.

I have had a little weight gain_ but it is only the 2nd week so I hope it will balance out and take the acne with it. I did well on Alesse for 3yrs and then had break through bleeding my Dr put me through hell switching brands for a year_ always suffering from extreme side effects I quit for a yr and a half and after much research thought to try loestrin1/20.,While I was on break from taking the pill I had an ovarian cyst rupture(agonizingly painful experience)I am certain the cyst formed while I was switching brands repeatedly.

I was determined to get the weight off when I stopped taking the pill and it wouldn't budge until that cyst ruptured then 8lbs fell off in a wk.

My obgyn had given me different ones but they all had adverse reactions(breakthough bleeding_ mood swings_ decreased libido_ heavy periods_ weight gain etc.) so I decided that I wouldn't take it again.I am guessing that I still had more horomonal developement to go through even at 17.  Now at 23_ I felt it was time to give it another go. Well_ I  started using loestrin 24 fe. I am really benefitting from the side effects at the moment.

969, 1, Avoiding Pregnancy,Basically it has all been said numerous times before on this site_ but it began with acne on my jaw and chin (I usually do not have break outs) that would not heal_ then the headaches ( I had never experienced migraines before - horriable)_ severe mood swings (mostly anger particularly the week before my scheduled period_ then the wierd spotting -  felt like I had to wear a pad all the time just in case_ I became very lethargic and unmotivated_ incrediably strong cravings for unhealthy foods_ my breast were extremely tender and enlarged the entire 8 months that I took this_ I also experienced weight gain and more interesting by the 8th month I actually appeared as if I was pregnant - weight gain in the lower abdomen and nowhere else_ no period_ nausea_ etc.  But due to the physical changes in my body my feelings toward myself had become very dangerous as my body image created depression for me.,Please be careful - I have seen these side effects repeated several times in this site with very few exceptions.  The depression alone is the single most dangerous aspect and weither triggered directly by the pill or due to the side effects from the pill it is a concern.  I have been off of the Loestrin FE 1/20 for a little over two weeks and  I still have not had a period but I have seen a stop to my weight gain but I won't feel any relief until I have my first period.I wish I had seen this earlier.

971, 1, PCOS/BC,I am soooo glad that I found this website.  I have been sick to my stomach for almost the entire 20 days that I have been on this pill.  I eliminated every other option of why I was feeling sooooo bad_ then I realized after talking to my sister that pills can cause all kinds of trouble.  More troubling than the nausea is the fact that this med makes me feel ike the world is coming to an end and there is no hope... That is so not me and the way I think.  Just called doc today and asked to switch_ she said this is not uncommon and is switching me to YAZ_ a little nervous about that.  I don't think anything can make me feel as bad as this pill!

Overall_ the symptoms I am having are comparable to first trimester pregnancy and the flu at the same time! Oh_ yeah_ gained a decent 7 pounds!,I called the doctor after the first week_ he said to take motrin every 6 hours to help decrease the bleeding and that you have to give it 2 months_ at least a month.  I seriously can't feel like this on a daily basis_ I have 2 children to take care of and 2 weeks of feeling pregnant and flu-like is taking a toll on my emotional well being...good luck to everyone else!,F,35,2  weeks,3/24/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

Loss of sex drive_ mild hair loss_ sensitive skin..,DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL! I have used many pills  over a 10 year span and NEVER EVER had a reaction like this! It was not mild symptoms_ they were VERY strong_ and in the 3 months Ive been taking this nightmare pill_ they have not lessened or subsided. The SECOND I finish this pack_ Im off it. Im going back to Yasmin_ or marvelon_ or Diane _ or Triphasil_ Or Ortho Tri Cyclen..ANYTHING is better than this! Feel free to email me if you have had same symptoms_ or have questions.

The day after I started Loestrin_ my period had stopped.  I haven't had any side effects_ no nausia_ bloading_ acne_ or anything of the sort.  Haven't gotten to the nn active pills so im not sure what my period will be like.  But I absolutely love this pill so far and think its the best one for me!,F,20,3  weeks,3/16/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

The very first month I was very emotional_ but after the 2nd month it got a little better.  My acne started to clear up.  I loved the short periods.  However lately my acne has come back_ I'm more easily stressed out_ and I can't sleep anymore.  I've also gained weight even though I'm eating more healthy than ever.  I started doing a lot of reading about side effects and talked to some friends who had discontinued using the pill and were much happier.  I honestly had never known about the potential side effects except for weight gain.  My husband and I just recently decided to stop using hormonal contraceptives altogether.,F,22,1  years,3/15/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
997, 1, prevent pregnancy,I'm taking the Microgestrin FE 1/20 generic for Loestrin FE 1/20_ and I am very dissatisfied with it.  I was taking Yasmin and I liked that a lot more_ it's just more expensive.  With the Microgestrin my period starts a week before it should and my periods last for at least 7 days and they are very heavy.  I've been on it for 4 months and I'm am switching back to Yasmin.,,F,39,4  months,3/15/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

1000, 1, Reduce period flow,This pill caused me migraines (the worst happened after the first pack)_ insomnia_ breast enlargement and tenderness_ and a very aggressive form of acne which I am still fighting even after 2 months of stopping this pill. Also_ I did not a have a period whatsoever and that did not feel very natural.,I did give this pill a chance for 4 months hoping that my body was going to get used to it but it did not happened. Now I am on Solia_ mainly to get my skin as it was before Loestrin_ and I feel MUCH better. ALL the terrible side effects are gone_ and my skin is improving little by little. I would suggest people with acne-prone skin to avoid taking this bcp because it may cause you troubles (it is highly androgenic).,F,30,4  months,3/13/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

1006, 5, birth control,headache,I've been on Loestrin for a year now and my doctor has switched me to Microgestin. I'm a little weary to make the switch. Loestrin has worked so well for me. I love the 2-3 day period and I rarely feel bloated. I'm worried about the Microgestin giving me a longer period since there are not as many active pills as the Loestrin. Has anyone else made this switch and how's it been?,F,23,1  days,3/2/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

I have tried to allow my body to adjust but the acne continues to be a bother.  Also_ I experienced a early period during the first month and a missed period the second (took a pregnancy test to make sure it was working).  Random vomiting during the first two months. I have never taken the brand name Loestrin_ so I cannot compare it.  I have heard some people say that Junel affected them differently.

Told my NP that I had a problem with depression and feel she should have known better about this one on some level. Time to go back to maybe Desogen_ which I don't remember nearly as bad on. I have Biplar disorder as it is_ and this has amplified my symptoms by 10. I would rather keep the cysts and hope they just go away or do whatever they will than deal with this.

I have tired so hard to stick wtih this_ but am officially throwing in the towel and can't wait to feel better soon.,F,40,16  days,2/27/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

Some moodiness (anger_ sadness) but nothing I can't live with. Some vaginal dryness with sex_ but that may also be due to perimenopause. I notice I get a little dizzy/lightheaded at times_ but it's not as bad now as when I first went on this pill. I notice some anxiety_ but that may be from guzzling so much coffee during the day to try to perk myself up!!","NOTE: I'm unsure of my rating (far left); haven't been on med that long!Although I'm not crazy about the side effects_ I'm going to stick it out and stay on this med until I see if the ""payoff"" (shorter_ lighter period) is worth it.

1040, 2, reduce period cramps/length,mild depression_ mild insomnia_ mild bloating_ mild nausea_ mild dehydration_ mild moodiness_ mild constipation_ decreased libido,That's just it. All of my side effects were so mild on their own_ that I didn't realize they could all be attributed to one unified cause. My camps were decreased and shorter in length_ but it just isn't worth the rest of it. Honestly_ go with condoms and pamprin_ at least you won't get fat and crazy.,F,24,24  days,1/31/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1041, 4, birth control,The side effects I experienced were severe migraine headaches at least twice a month for the first three months. Yet after the start of the fourth month - not a single headache to report. I have had mild acne on my jaw and chin_ cheeks. No weight gain_ very light periods_ if one at all.,I really like this form of bc compared to Ortho and the NuevaRing.,F,28,5  months,1/30/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1042, 1, to avoid pregnancy,irritability_ extreme anger_ aggression_ inability to concentrate_ some headaches_ feeling numb_ inability to smile - overall this pill sucks - get off of it. I'm getting off of it tomorrow and will allow my body about 3-6 months before trying another more estrogen-heavy pill.,I was on Loestrin FE 24 for 3 months only when the dr. jekyl and mr hyde behavior started and it was starting to affect how I treated others and saw the world. I have been depressed - feeling just numb in general and have felt unable to smile and have had difficulty concentrating. This drug is horrible and mimics the effects of menopause - it has less estrogen so that is what causes the anger and aggression I think. OUr bodies can't handle these drops in hormones Sometimes it takes a while to show up_ for others it happens in a few days. It was especially bad for me during the typical pms time (a week before my period).,F,31,3  months,1/30/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1043, 1, Birth Control,First 2 months were fine. Started 3rd month_ bleeding daily. Mood swings_ depressed_ no sex drive at all_ cramping.,Went on it to try and reduce length of periods. Absolutely regret doing so. This pill is awful and I am going to switch as soon as I possibly can!!!!,F,24,3  months,1/28/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1044, 3, bc_ control bad cramps,mild nausea_ moodiness_ depression_ short or nonexistant period_ absolutely zero cramps,I was put on Microgestin FE (low doses) and noticed that I was INCREDIBLY moody (my roomates were scared of me!). But_ since I am notorious for having heavy_ PAINFUL periods when not on the pill_ I really liked the fact that this one gave me nearly no period. You can only imagine the money I saved on feminine products. However_ I noticed that the moodiness morphed into depression (esp. in the winter or during finals/high stress times). Granted_ I was a college student at the time and did not exercise as much as I should have....possibly contributing to my state. However_ the moodiness and depression just ruined me. I was anxious constantly and would freak out at a drop of a hat. Mostly_ I just did not feel like myself...ususally I am a very positive and motivated person. Just felt like staying home and sleeping. Eventually_ I got off the meds and gradually have gotten WORLDS BETTER! Yay!,F,22,1.5  years,1/27/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1045, 3, Contraception,Spotting_ missing period,I'm actually on Microgestin (the generic) and I'm so relieved to see that it is common to miss periods. I was on Ortho Tri Cyclen for 1 year and Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for 2_ both of which gave me spotting_ but I always still had a period. I've been on Microgestin for 6 months now and my periods were very light and very short (to be expected with this drug.) However_ I'm concerned to learn that you can miss your period all together. This month there was spotting on the last week of my active pills_ but my regular period hasn't come (4 days late.) I like the monthly assurance of NOT being pregnant_ and like others have said_ someone should have told me that this can happen with this pill. I'm going to have to take a pregnancy test just to be sure.   What a bother!,F,22,6  months,1/23/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

1050, 3, b/c history of ovarian cysts,weight gain (15 lbs) though may have been due to other medical issues. Acne breakouts severe-cyst like acne. still have painful cramps,It's nice to not have a period but this is the ONLY birthcontrol I have ever been on that has ever NOT given me a period.  I've taken Lo/estrin FE 1.5/30 and Lo/Oval and Mircette and always had a period. It's nice to not have mood swings but I can't get over the acne. The acne started about a month or two after starting this pill. I have never in my LIFE had acne... this bad: Not even as a teenager.,F,27,8  months,1/18/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1051, 3, birth control,I have been on this pill since 2001.  At first it was great.  Lighter periods_ less acne_ no cramps & of course I never got pregnant & didn't gain a lot of weight & a great sex drive.  I stopped taking the pill in 2005 to have a baby.  I started back when my son was about 6 months (due to breast feeding).  Every since I've been back on the pill it's like a nightmare.  I went from a high sex drive to just about none.  My husband is demanding an answer.  I've been to the Dr. twice b/c of these problems & my OBGYN examined me & said...there's nothing wrong w/ me_ but I know there is!  I just happened to come across this web site & wow...THANKS this really answered my questions & concerns.  They are all connected.  No sex drive_ extreme vaginal dryness_ skipped periods (which I really don't mind I just need to know I'm not pregnant)I am soooo irratable.  The smallest things drive me crazy!  I was trying to figure out why I just felt OFF.  I guess you could call,,F,28,6  years,1/18/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1052, 5, BC_ cramps_ heavy bleeding,tiredness_ PMS mood swings_ loss of appetite_ increased libido,This pill is great. I lost 35 lbs I put on while on Depo_ and my periods last 2 days and are very light. The only problem is that if I forget to take a pill - even by a few hours - my period starts up. Other than that - WAY better than Desogen and Depo!,F,25,7  months,1/13/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1053, 3, To stop heavy_ long periods,First week_ moody_ severe nausa and bloating. After three months experienced loss of libido and severe vaginal dryness. Other consistent side effects included larger breasts (almost full cup size_ not complaining) and bloating.  Bloating was really annoying since I work out and usually have a flat stomach.,This drug did serve its purpose - controlled my periods.  I would have stayed on it despite bloating and libido_ the vaginal dryness is what caused me to switch.,F,28,6  months,1/13/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

The low libido_ 2 periods a month and lack of memory where nothing compaired to the terrible mood swings I would get.  Feelings of wanting to hurt people I completely withdrew from everyone.  I wish I would have looked for this site before thinking there was something wrong with me.,F,47,9  months,1/10/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20
1058, 1, Birth Control,Mood swings_ mild depression_ devoid of any emotion_ increased appetite_ increased cravings for sweets_ irregular period_ breakthrough bleeding_ severe breast tenderness_ bloating_ anxiety_ vaginal dryness_ complete loss of libido_ increased acne_ night sweats_ nightmares,This particular bcp was horrible for me. I've been on the pill for 8 months_ and will be stopping it immediately. I have been to my doctor several time regarding negative side effects_ but_ rather than opting to switch me to a different pill_ the doctor has only suggested other medications to help with said symptoms. I am a firm believer that it is completely wrong to treat the symptoms of medication with more medication. I never suffered from depression_ anxiety_ or severe mood swings before starting this medication. I am starving all day long ... if I didn't stop myself I could eat from the time I got up to the time I went to sleep. I am a newlywed_ and the loss of libido is probably the hardest thing to deal with. I'm not saying that this bcp is horrible for everyone because not every person has the same result. I mainly wanted to write this comment for others out there who are suffering from the same side effects_ and who may think it's all in their head and not really the medicine,F,24,8  months,1/10/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

1063, 4, Birth Control,Spotting daily for the first pack.  Heavy mood swings right before my period.  Breast enlargement in second month.,"I actually have grown to love this BC.  I was on the Nuvaring for about a year and my new boyfriend is a bit larger in that area and it actually made sex uncomfortable b/c I could feel the ring so I switched back to a daily pill.  At first the spotting was so annoying...too little for a tampon but too much for panty liner.  Then the mood swings right before my period were crazy...I was psyco_ then normal on and off for about 3-5 days before my period.  I didn't get my period at all in the second cycle_ but my breasts were larger...that's a plus (not painful either).  The best part is...my sex drive is back along with my ""natural lubrication"".  I lost both of those with the Nuvaring.  Now I am about to start my 4th month and things seem to be ok.  I got my period this month_ but it is light.  Still have the larger breasts :)_ mood swings are gone...I hope for good.  My skin was never a problem_ but seems to be a little better.

1065, 1, Possible endometriosis,Weight gain_ intense migraines_ sleep disturbances_ painful swollen breasts_ never-ending period_ loss of libido,My doctor gave me this medication (without explaining the side effects_ I may add) because I may have endometriosis and my ultrasound showed that my right ovary is enlarged. I've tried BCP before and suffered horrible side effects_ so I was skeptical about this one. I wanted to give it a fair shot but I can't take the side effects any more. Some women can't take oral contraception_ and I am one of them.,F,24,13  days,1/8/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

I was bleeding so heavily and irregularly I had weeks of not being able to leave the house.  This has slowed everything down_ so I can go out and feel like a normal person again!  Unfortunately I was doing well losing weight before starting this and I've gained back_ in areas where I didn't have before... it's frustrating.  I know that it's recommended to give it up to 6 months before you see results_ it's been 4 packs now- I'm still having spotting everyday.,F,40,4  months,1/6/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

Well_ I've been on this pill exactly one month and the week after I started taking it_ I bled for 4 days. Now I have taken my last ""brown"" pill and still no period.  I am one that likes to be on schedule_ so this is troubling to me. I feel all my regular period symptoms_ but no bleeding. I'm afraid I'm messing up my body-but by the looks of this messge board_ many others are skipping periods also.

On the other hand_ I'm praying that these acne break outs on my face_ neck_ and back go away because I never break out and it really sucks. Also_ it upsets me that I can't get as wet for sex as I used to... Lube has become a staple in our sex life_ and I hate that. Hopefully that will subside within time as well.... Anyone else break out at first or have decreased libido? Does that go away within time? Please let me know....,F,25,3  weeks,1/3/2007Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

I've felt this way for 2 weeks.  My doctor told me to take Emetrol for the nausea_ but I'm beginning to wonder if it's worth it cause I spend more on that than the pill prescription.  I've gained weight_ still have breakthrough bleeding after 2 months_ felt moody at first and my breasts are much larger (which is probably the only positive effect.)  I think I have every minor side effect you can get.  I'm going to try to wait out the next month (my dr. claims side effect generally go away by then_) or get an IUD if not.,F,22,2  months,1/3/2007,Loestrin fe 1/20

While this pill has helped with my periods_ the price I pay with the migraines for three or four days straight a month is not worth it.  I feel like I am always exhausted too_ and that is not something I am used to.  I just feel like I have had zero energy since I started taking this.  One more thing: I have always had perfect skin_ never any problems.  However_ since I started on this crappy pill I am constantly breaking out and it is driving me crazy!

The first couple of days were great - my first period after starting Loestrin FE was much_ much lighter than usual_ but now I've started experiencing daily headaches/migraines_ nausea_ moodiness and anxiety.  I've also had break-through bleeding_ cramps and sore_ swollen breasts after forgetting to take 1 dose (even though I doubled up the next morning).  I'm trying to avoid having a hysterectomy to solve the problems and pain caused by the endo/adenomyosis_ so I'll try it a bit longer to see if the side effects get any better_ but if I continue to have these symptoms its definitely not worth it and I'll have to reconsider having surgery.,F,41,3  weeks,12/27/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

During the first month I had a lot of cramping and bleeding (went through whole box of 24 tampons that month alone!)  I gained about five pounds.  I feel anxious and moody sometimes as well.  I've tried four different pills in the last five years_ so I suppose I'd rather experience physical than mental effects from them.  I'm really sensitive to hormones I guess.

I thought it was just me but now I see that these side effects are common. I wanted to give my body adjustment time to get used to these pills but I can not get used to these side effects. I think I would rather have heavy_ 7 day periods than deal with all of this.,These pills work great for making your period less heavy and much shorter_ HOWEVER_ they cause extreme mood swings_ lower sex drive_ and acne.,F,27,6  months,10/17/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

I got freaked out when I didn't get my period_ but realized I haven't had sex in 3 months_ so no way of being pregnant.  Loestrin is great. Fortunately_ I haven't had to pay for it yet.

I started taking the pills the first day of my period. To my surprise my period lasted a total of 12 days opposed to my regular 5. I thought that was just my bodys' reaction to the pill so i continued. 5 days later i experienced bleeding again and I'm pretty sure it's my period again!

I've just finished the fourth pack and started the fifth with no period at all.  I know I'm not pregnant and am relieved to hear that this is normal.  A little more emotional and the cramping has been slightly worse but figured that was par for the course with a new pill.

I am a little frustrated because I got my period the first 2 months and missed it the 3rd and thought I was going to miss the 4th month but finally got it onthe 4th day of the brown iron pill. Flow is very light/ lasted 1-3 days. The thought of being pregnant was very scary for me at this time and having to buy the tests/spend $ was annoying.Overall - I do like this pill.

Some breast tenderness and anxiety (though the anxiety may have been because I was bleeding all the time!),I used to be on Yasmin_ which was great_ but I was beginning to have about a 12 day period because of break-through bleeding.  My doctor said this happens when your body gets used to the hormone.  She said I could stop taking pills for awhile_ or go on a different one.  So_ we went with Loestrin.  A few days into it_ I started heavy period-like bleeding.  It has lasted the entire month!  It's driving me crazy!  I am going to wait another month or two to see if it stops_ but then I will take the other option and forget about the pill for awhile.,F,24,1  months,9/24/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

One moment happy_ the next moment my life was falling apart. I thought it was due to other changes in my life_ but I've never felt this bad before.,I don't feel myself & was about to go see a counselor & get on medication before I saw this website.

I've broken out some but I'm hoping that will stop_ and I've easily lost 5or6 pounds. No other side affects_ but I'm nervous about no periods. Do I have to take a pregnancy test every month? I'm going to stick with this pill because I love the light periods_ and I strongly believe changing pills too often isn't healthy.

I remember telling someone I feel like I'm tired and mad at everything except I had no idea why & no control over it (which is tough b/c I'm usually happy).  I'm sensitive to the pill_ but it's never been this bad.  I would strongly recommend you look out for the symptoms if you start this.  I quit today_ I put a new relationship in jeopardy (and men don't swallow the pill reason easily - pardon the pun) and it's just not worth it.

Mild headaches cured by Advil.,I'm on my 2nd week of Loestrin 24Fe (supposedly the same as 1/20). It was prescribed for me immediately after having a non-surgucal abortion_ which may have contributed to the crying and mood swings I experienced. However_ this week I feel normal_ and the same things plaguing me pre- loestrin are still going on (severe cystic acne on face_ some diarrhea).

I could not function on this pill.  I could not concentrate which made me feel very anxious.  I was even screaming at my kids_ which I hardly ever do.  It took all the energy I had to just feed my kids_ not to mention all the other tasks a mother does.  It even made me throw up and I usually have a strong stomach.  I will not ever take this pill again.  My body does not like it!  My suggestion for anyone beginning this pill is to make sure that you have someone around to help you get through your everyday tasks if you have a bad reaction.

Three days latter_ I still have the headache_ but it is now almost gone_ and I am beginning to feel happy_ but at the same time I am suffering from bleeding and cramps! Worst of all my doctor will not believe me and says it is an accident that I had this terrible headache the same day I took the pill...Honestly_ just because some people are highly sensitive to drugs_ which I am_ doctors dismiss your problems.

I'm very health conscious_ in excellent physical condition_ and have always been very ""in-tune"" with my body. I was horrified when i first started noticing headaches and dizzy spells (~3wks in)... and didn't make the association with the loestrin. Once i started monitoring my symptoms more closely_ i realized that a day after i started the sugar pills_ the headaches almost dissapeared!  some nausea (but that's expected wth BC_ and can be prevented by taking pill at right time of day. Also_ I've also had VERY regular periods. 1st month_ i got my period 5days early. 2nd month i got (what appeared to be) a full period 1.5wks early_ and then didn't get period when was on sugar pills.

The second pack the side effects got even worse.  To be honest they were frightening they were that bad.  I thought I was going crazy.  The agitation and headaches were horrifying.  Also_ the ""foggy mind"" made me think I was actually cracking up.  I was relieved to read this page.  I am on day 11 of the second pack but am stopping them now after reading this page.  I was worried about stopping mid pack but after reading this page and seeing that other people have stopped mid pack I have made the decision to to do this.

I was getting ready to send myself to a counselor thinking I had serious emotional issues when it turns out it's all just side effects of the pill.  Sex...yeah that's a joke.  That is the last thing on my mind and to think I tried this pill to reduce the length of time of my period was so I didn't have to wait 7 days to have sex again.  Would rather wait the 7 days.

I've gained some wait but will accept it if my bustline remains slightly enlarged!  My acne hasn't improved and seems to be worse if I'm in the sun. Periods last 2-3 days. Mid cycle cramping and SEVERE depression/moodiness (day 14 or so) that lasts about 2 days.  Been on many pills_ so this one isn't that different in my experience.,It's worth giving it a try but KNOW that depression/moodiness is either a side effect or just what happens as we age and our hormones go haywire!,F,40,3  months,7/24/2006Email,Loestrin fe 1/20
1216, 4, Birth Control,More frequent mood swings_ breast enlargement_ severe cramping in the first 14 days.,This pill is great_ but I am on the lowest dosage so will that make it much less effective?  I'm a little worried because I haven't gotten a real period in over a month_ only spotting.  Is that a normal reaction?  I also experienced severe mood swings for the first month I was on the pill_ but those calmed down somewhat since then.

No other side effects.,"Because I have been taking this pill for such a long time (with only a 2 year break to have my child) I recently asked by GP if it was still OK for me to take it - he said that as long as I was happy_ my blood pressure remained normal and because I have never smoked there was no problem at all.

1227, 5, To regulate my period,The first couple of weeks I felt nausea right after I took the pill_ but then I started eating food when I took it and that eliminated the nausea. then the first couple of months I started getting pimples on my back_ usually one at a time.,After my body got used to the pill_ I haven't had any side effects. People don't realize that they need to let their body get use to a new perscription. My periods only last a couple of days and I hardly ever get cramps or bloating. This is the first birth control pill I've ever been on and I love it. The only downside is the price. It seems to be very expensive especially since I'm used to having the military give it to me for free. It's great!! Give Loestrin a try for at least a couple of months bc it gets better.,F,20,10  months,7/6/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

No nausea or breast tenderness.  Also_ my skin is not clear (i have acne). First week acne became much much worse... However_ now (second week) it improves every day and now my skin looks better and better. So_ if you want to take it for acne (and you are about my age)- give it some time_ it will work.,F,28,14  days,7/3/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

However_ i have put on weight_ I feel sick all day if i take the pill in the morning_ not at night. I also have no sex drive which is a downside.

I was supposed to get my period two days ago and still haven't gotten it_ so I'm not sure if it's late or if I won't get it at all.  I've noticed a bit more mood swings_ but I'm moody as it is so who knows if the pill's causing it_ :D.  After being on about four different birth control pills before this_ I'm actually pretty satisfied with Loestrin.,F,16,3  months,6/23/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

1236, 3, birth control_ spotting issues,some bloating and breast tenderness_ hair loss??,Comparing Loestrin to other pills_ there is less estrogen and as a result less moodiness by far. In regards to yeast infections_ I had them before so I have no idea if this is making it worse or not. I don't get cramps and bloating like I did when I wasn't on the pill.  And the spotting has stopped.  I am just concerned because my hair has thinned a great deal and I had a full head of long blonde hair about a year ago.  It seems to continue to thin...and looks horrible.  I have heard that this can be a side effect for younger women and I can't help but think that Loestrin 1/20 is the cause.  It is actually quite devastating to go from a full head of thick hair to looking like a wet dog! Mixed feelings on this pill.,F,27,6  months,6/14/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

I'm gutted because I was 1 year trying different pills till I found this one that I have now been very happy with 12 years. They don't sell Loestrin or anything similar here in Spain. A friend suggested that I look for Loestrin on the internet_ does anyone know here I can buy this?

I checked with my doctor and she said_ I should consider myself lucky_ and that it has no influence on my future childbearing and my health.,No weight gain_ no mood swings_ not like on other medications like on Nuvaring (horrible depression and breast tenderness) or on Loestrin 1.5 and higher.,F,30,6  years,5/21/2006Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

I am naturally slim and have never had a problem with weight_ but since starting this and similarly my more healthy life I have put on about a stone_ got a bit of a tummy and wobbly bits on places i'd rather they were not!!!  It has helped somewhat towards easing my horrendous period pains I get every month (not as good as microgynon though).,I am going to stick with this pill for a while yet because things can settle down with some more time.

1246, 3, bad periods_possible endometriosis,nausea_ acne_ extreme fatigue_ moodiness...,I held out hope for this pill_ especially after hearing how many women it did help_ though I know all pills work differently. This one was definitely not for me.  Though the severe pain I'd been experiencing before had subdued a little_ it wasn't worth it for me.  After seven days of being exhausted_ I crashed:  I had a day where all I could do was sleep_ and didn't have any strength to walk or talk much--terrifying especially since I was alone.  When I went to use the bathroom_ I collapsed and had to crawl there. I stopped the pill yesterday and this morning I got my period_ two weeks after my real one.  I must say_ though_ it is the best period I've had in YEARS!,F,22,7  days,5/9/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

After taking it for a couple of years_ I decided to give my body a rest for several months.....i couldn't WAIT to get back on it.  I had forgotten what cramps felt like!  Not to mention having to wear the largest tampons available for the heavy flow.  My doctor (who has only daughters) originally prescribed this because I was afraid of gaining weight on the pill.  I never want to switch.,F,28,3  years,3/22/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

1264, 4, to reduce size of uterine fibroids,Diarrhea for the first four months. Light menstrual periods the first four months_ completely skipped the last two periods. I was scared until today I found this site and read that the majority of women on this pill have experienced the same. The great aspect is that the mood swings I have always had in the week of my period (depression_ sadness_ apathy_ agressiveness) are gone. My husband and I are very happy about that!!,Regarding the objective for which I was prescribed this_ which was to reduce the size of the fibroids_ I still need a new ultrasound test to see what happened.,F,35,6  months,2/28/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20
1265, 4, Contraception_ heavy periods,No periods ever.  No bleeding.  Which is a bit scary_ but my doctor says this is normal on this particular pill..

Would go back to normal on off days.",Started taking after Ortho Novum started making me crazy and Loestrin worked for several years.  Now that I'm 41 I think I need to stop before everyone_ including myself hates me!

1270, 5, birth control_ heavy/painful period,Possibly makes me feel more tired_ may have gained a little weight but can't be certain that it's not my lack of will-power! Light/no periods.,Have been taking various forms of the pill since I was 16 (Microgynon/Celest) both made me gain weight and gave me mood swings and nausea. Loestrin does NOT make me depressed although I can get a little teary coming up to my period and it certainly doesn't make me ill. I have not experienced any hair loss. I have much milder & shorter periods with little/no pain. I have experienced NO period on occasion. I did also have a time where I had a continuous period for over 6 months - I continued taking Loestrin and don't attribute the issue with the pill. I would recommend it to reduce period pains. I've not had any experience to suggest that this pill is at all harmful to your health_ however I have given myself a rest from it for a couple of months every year or so just in case.,F,23,5  years,1/3/2006,Loestrin fe 1/20

I missed three periods when i began loestrin 20 and was extremely scared that i was pregnant! Severe cramps in the first week of pills.,Would recommend it as an anti-depressant and it's not great to control irregular periods as it can tend to stop periods all-together.,F,15,6  months,1/2/2006Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

1278, 3, Severe cramps_ birth control,Light periods_ no cramps_ vaginal dryness_ extreme yest infection_ sore breasts,At first I was extremely satisfied with this birth control.  I have taken Ortho and it caused me to have massive mood swings.  It was great (though a little scary the first time) to have a light period and little to no cramping_ since I also have Intercystal Cystitus of the bladder and cramping makes that worse.  However_ into the second month of taking the pills_ I started experiencing extremely dry and sensitive vaginal skin.  About a day before my period started_ I got the worst yest infection of my life and had to treat it for 4 days.  I love that I have lighter cramps and periods_ however I'm not sure if the other side effects are worth continueing to take this birth control.,F,23,2  days,11/14/2005Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

1280, 4, endometriosis_ birth control,missed period_ some cramps,I haven't noticed any major side effects. The only negative is that a missed period is scary_ even though common. My mood is great though. I was on Seasonale earlier this year and it made me extremely depressed.,F,28,3  months,10/4/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20
1281, 2, birth control,I am 36 years old was taking Modicon 28 and decided to switch to Loestrin to see if it would improve my sex drive.  The one bad side effect that I experienced was an increase in joint pain.  Everywhere that I have arthritis the pain seemed to increase_ particularly my left foot.  I took Loestrin for 2 years and stopped to become pregnant.,Some positive side effects were less breast tenderness.  I also felt less PMS.,F,36,2  years,9/27/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20
1282, 5, BCP_ Anemia_ Von Willebrand's Disea,My period has all but disappeard_ which is amazing because I have a bleeding disorder. I have required BTP to make the bleeding take a break ever since I was 13. I was on numerous other BCP's before I tried Loestrin Fe and the shortest period was 8-9 days and HEAVY.  Now_ I'm lucky if it shows at all. :> And brought my Iron levels to almost normal_ without any extra iron pills.,Before I took this pill_ I had to take Iron_ DDAVP(clotting meds) and had to take BCP's that gave me moodiness_ bad cramps_ weight gain and still had incredibly long heavy periods. Not to mention constipation from the iron. Each pill effects everyone different_ because we are all different. This one fits me perfectly. I'll never change.,F,27,7  years,9/26/2005Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

1287, 5, menstrual regulation,I only experienced GREAT side effects.  This is the only pill that I have ever had positive side effects from.  I feel like it stabilized my mood_ my weight_ NEVER bloated_ my period was regular_ had no cramps_ no headaches.  I won't even take the generic brand... even though they say that they are identical_ my body knows differently.  I tried it and it's not the same.  Loestrin is a great bcp to take for this reason.,,F,32,8  years,8/5/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20

I am off of it now but only by 2-3 days.  I think having such a decline in libido is not worth staying on this pill.,F,31,8  months,7/18/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20

No appatite at all...headaches_ breakthrough bleeding for the whole first month!!,Asked doctor to put me back on Triphasil 28 which I took for 15 years with NO problem....When I wanted to get back on the pill_ after a 3 year break_ the doctor thought that leostin fe 1/20 would be better for me because of my age (35).... NO THANK YOU!!  I started Triphal 28 again...,F,35,28  days,7/2/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20
1291, 5, Birth control_ severe cramps,None. I do have to say that Loestrin is much better than the generic Microgetsin I took for 3 out of the last 5 years (because of insurance issues); that did have some side effects like cramps_ and a little bloating.,Before Loestrin_ I had tried several different oral contraceptives and each had terrible side effects - extreme moodines_ dizziness_ breast pain so intense I couldn't put on a bra_ etc. Loestrin was completely different.,F,33,5  years,6/22/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20
1292, 4, Birth Control,I've been on this medication (switched to Microgestin about 3 years ago) for at least 5 years.  Have had few periods in this time.  Some breast tenderness (goes through waves_ really bad for a few months_ then disappears for a few months).  No hair loss.  No weight gain (that I know of_ but it's been awhile).  Possible mood swings.  Decreased libido.,At one point my doctor accidentally prescribed the Loestrin at a higher dosage (1.5/30).  Within a month I put on five pounds and felt incredibly bloated.  I was amazed at the difference in the two pills.,F,28,5  years,6/21/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20
1293, 3, hormone imbalance,moodiness_ acne_ facial hair growth_ bloating,VERY light periods_ almost no cramps. Had breakthrough bleeding more so the longer I took it. I am switching to yasmin because of the acne and breakthrough bleeding.,F,27,9  years,6/21/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20
1294, 5, Menapouse Stages,So far (about 5 years already) No side effects ever occured.,It really works! to control my hormone in my menapousal stage. Before taking this pill_ I had a heavy_ irregular bleeding_ that are continously (sometimes) until 3 weeks bleeding. On and off. After taking this_ it went back to normal period_ 5 days and very regular (every month) -- my note is: Be Extra CAREFUL when your insurance company want to substitute this drug with generic brand such as: Microgestin FE. I recently not noticed that mistakes (bought via mail prescription) and effecting my body immediately. Like back to my old days with heavy irregular bleeding. I immediately switched back to Loestrin and all back to normal.,F,52,5  years,6/20/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20
1295, 4, Contraceptive_ severe cramps,Most of the side effects did not effect me. Some moodiness and depression_ but dealt with that prior to taking this medication. Seems worse after taking reminder pills then going back to active. Random cramps during cycle_ not painful though. Very few headaches but very bad when they happened. No acne_ no breakthrough bleeding_ periods were lighter and hardly any cramps. Last month period was almost nothing which made me think I was pregnant. No weight gain. Didn't know anything about hairloss - kind of scary.,Started taking this when I met my future husband last year_ so maybe being so happy outweighed the depression. This is the first BCP I've taken and didn't really know what to expect but I am overall very happy with the results.,F,23,9  months,6/17/2005Email,Loestrin fe 1/20

I have been on this for three months now & my face has cleared up for the most part. I have yet to have a period - it scared me to death till I found out it was common. Now it is rather nice. It was supposed to help with my sex drive (I am lacking testosterone & estrogen due to 4 years of chronic pain) - I have yet to see a difference. Vaginal dryness almost the whole month. No depression per say but lack of feeling all together. I don't know how much longer I should give this medication...,,F,26,3  months,5/2/2005,Loestrin fe 1/20
