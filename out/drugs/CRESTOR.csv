Improved immediately I stopped the 40mg does the Dr put me on. On a 10mg dose for 18 months before symptoms returned and even worse. Have just taken myself off and immediately much improved. Not more organ spasms but still dull pain throughout upper stomach area. Seeing the Dr. tomorrow to request tests to see what this poison has done to me.,For years my symptoms of memory loss and muscle issues were dismissed as signs of ageing.

9, 1, High cholesterol,After being on Crestor for 5 weeks I broke out in urticaria. Insanely itchy skin and lumps which started like a mosquito bite but over time spread into welts. Also the muscles in my legs started to lose their muscle tone. After three weeks working with the doctor trying to control the rash which he thought was eczema I lay awake one itchy night and read the patient leaflet about Crestor and it said a known but uncommon side effect was extremely itchy skin with raised red lumps_ said it's an ellergic reaction and stop taking immediately.,I continued with this medication for three weeks before realising I was allergic to it. I now feel like I've poisoned myself. It's only two days since I stopped taking Crestor and I'm much improved. No more feeling like hoards of ravenous ants are racing under my skin at night and the rash is diminishing. In a few more days it should hopefully be all gone.

Actually_ one reason not to prescribe Crestor is an adverse reaction to another drug in the same class. GP said pain in joints not a side affect but he is wrong.

41, 1, reduce cholesterol levels,From the get-go I experienced leg weakness_ cramping _numbness and pain. Initially was on 20 mg then after several months my cardiologist bumped up the daily dose to 40mg.....symptoms magnified greatly.....my compaints fell on deaf ears and he insisted I maintain the dose which I stupidly adhered to. Muscle mass became highly evident from a once athletic frame. CK levels of 1200 substantiated loss of muscle mass and myopathy. Family practioner through a recent blood test picked up on the high level of CK and attributed loss of muscle as related to the symptoms was most likely caused by Crestor. Next stop is to get the cardiologist to prescribe another statin and abandon Crestor  ...... and also monitor blood levels lest I drop the cardiologist and seek cardio expertise elsewhere.,I need to get off this disabling drug and recapture life as it was before using this dreaded crippling drug.,M,72,3  years40mg 1X D,6/17/2015,Crestor

Some day medications will be tailored to your DNA not one size fits all!,It does drasticly lower your cholesterol.  The results are not worth the long term side effect and serious muscle damage_ plus possible heart damage. Additionally for a diabetic to take one medicine to make your muscles use sugar it is counter productive to take Crestor that inhibits the muscles form operating normally.

Until 2 yrs ago I could barely walk because my right hip and thigh hurt so badly it felt like it was broken ; could barely put any weight on that foot or the pain would shoot from the hip all the down to my calf. The same pain was present when I sat or tried to lie on the right side. Also found myself becoming very forgetful and having pain in my right side. The doc at that time told me I could not stop the Crestor ; to make this long story short I've been off the Crestor now for 6 days! Yes! I stopped this nasty drug pain still in right leg but nowhere near as bad as it is while taking this drug I can't say what will happen but my mind seems a bit clearer I'll see what happens. I have a new doc now and I will let her know next week that I stopped taking the Crestor _ I still don't like this feeling I have in my right side _ hopefully it hasn't destroyed my liver or kidney.,I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS DRUG FOR ANYONE_ the manufactures should be ashamed for putting this dangerous drug on the market just to make big bucks!,F,60,6  years10mg,2/28/2015Email,Crestor

61, 1, To lower LDL,About 6 weeks ago_ I began having pain in my right outer thigh.  It was most noticeable when I tried to sleep on that side.  The discomfort soon spread to my left thigh as well.  After a week of not being able to sleep with pain_ I called my doctors office (Cholesterol Specialist group) and was told to stop taking the drug for 3 weeks and call them back with the results.  It has been a little over two weeks without the drug and now the pain has lessened and I am able to sleep at night.  When I press my outer thighs_ I can still feel discomfort that is not present in other large muscles of my body.  After reading all of the testimonials_  I am shocked at how much people have suffered with this drug and their doctors not supporting the fact the symptoms could be related to Crestor.  I do not want to resume this medication.,,F,66,18  months40 1X D,2/24/2015,Crestor

81, 3, Result of heart attack,I started out on Lipitor after having a minor heart attack in 1998 at age 50.  Several years later in 2002 my doctor enrolled me in the test study for a new statin drug that eventually became Crestor.  My initial results were impressive and my cholesterol dropped to levels that pleased the doctor.  Once he tried to raise my dosage from 10mg to 20mg and almost immediately I experience sever muscle pains in my abdomen and legs.  I cut the pills in half and the pain went away.  I then demanded to be returned to the 10mg dose.  I have been using 10mg dose daily since I have been the brand name of Crestor after the study concluded.  Over the past several years I have noticed an increase in leg muscle pain and joint pain in hips_ knees_ hands_ and shoulders.  I initially believe this to be aging.  I also have numbness in both of my feet behind the toes.  Thinking it may be related to diabetes I had blood tests conducted and that is not the case.  I talked to my doctor about stopping Crestor,"Consult your doctor before stopping Crestor as you run the high risk of creating an cardiac event.  Use common sense on how you disengage from this drug.  Stopping cold turkey can cause your blood ""stickiness"" to increase dramatically above the levels that cause a person to initially take Crestor.  I think all our bodies handle this drug a little different and we all run the risk of stroke or heart attack if we are not careful in how we stopped taking a statin.",M,67,12  years10mg 1X D,11/17/2014Email,Crestor

92, 1, Hi Cholesterol,Confusion and memory loss_ unable to function especially at work,"I took Crestor for 3 years not knowing that all my problems were due to this drug.  It lowered my cholesterol quickly but I lost my ability to think_ to concentrate_ to remember things that I knew all my life especially at work.  I became the village idiot at work after 22 years of dedicated service to my employer - no one ever came to me anymore for information.  I knew the information but I could not retrieve it/remember it.  It was thanks to PBS_ CNN_ and FOX that I found out that Crestor can cause these problems.  I stopped taking it and it took about 6 months to finally find my old self again_ who I was 3 1/2 years before.  What is criminal is that my doctor and my pharmacist did not know Crestor had these side effects.  I recently asked my pharmacist again_ he looked in his computer and said ""no Crestor does not cause confusion and memory loss"".  My doctor accused me of making it up.  I went to the Crestor_com and sure enough memory loss and confusion are listed but at the bottom.  I suffered for 3 years for nothing!  I am grateful I didn't lose my job and am off this medication.

Cardiologist convinced me statins would reduce my risk of heart problems (although I have no apparent heart issues and am very fit) since LDL / Apo B levels were elevated.

I do suffer from the usual joint problems and tiredness associated with taking Statins_ bad pains in hands_ knees and back. However_ the worse issues are the memory loss_ and mood swings. Sometimes I feel like the incredible hulk as you can go from a normal/happy to enraged over the least little thing. Can be truly worrying.      My doctor upped my dose to 20Mg once and I came off after a week as I was a zombie with an anger issue. However_ a relation of mine takes 20mg and seems to suffer no side effects. ,Consult with your doctor about the side effects and tell them strongly you believe they are Crestor/Statin related.

I believed at first that i had perfected some exercises and maybe i was getting better results. when the knees and shoulder got really bad i just thought i was overdoing the routine. it was more like biometrics (body weight).  I slowed down and went back to the old weights for a couple weeks. i was having trouble with 50% of the old weights.  I was hitting max at half the weight.  I stopped taking it when it started to feel like i was in a car crash every morning.  the odd thing was that my thought process was so poor that i think that is why i couldnt put 2 and 2 together.  I got off of it for a month and read a lot.  i found this was common.  i decided to test it again just to confirm. 5 days ago i took the pills and cut them into quarters.  I wa,i cant say enough just how much damage i believe this drug did.  I feel i have aged decades in just months.  i will not take again and will inform as many people as possible,M,39,80  days10 mg 1X D,8/29/2011Email,Crestor

I went and had an eye exam nothing wrong_ but i told him on crestor_ he was surprised as very few have eye muscle problems_ my left eye was constantly contracting. Since stopping crestor (35 days) my eye problem has gone_ but i still have great trouble going up stairs_ i hope it will subside.I am now taking krill oil tablets and watching diet_ my doctor said go back in 6 wks for a review.

314, 1, HIGH CRP LEVEL,After only being on Crestor x 3 wks_ I had begun to develop what felt like brain fog and fatigue...just could not think clearly at all and all I wanted to do was lay on the couch.  Meanwhile_ my ankles began to be extremely painful_  and  swelling to the point of not being able to see my ankle bone_ then came the hip_ knee and wrist pain and stiffness.  Somehow through all the brain fog_ I realized this all came on me since I had been taking the Crestor.  After the 3rd week I stopped taking it.

Then learned a friend was on Lipitor for 18 months before he realized a problem (couldn't walk up a flight of stairs)_ stopped taking it and took another 18 months to recover.

As a statin_ isn't it just a milder version of Baycol_ and we all know the story there. When people are falling over dead because of a drug (Baycol)_ the FDA may act; if it's just a more gradual poisoning (Crestor) they are blind_ following (with the medical profession) the Pied Piper band of Pfizer_ AstraZeneca_ Bayer_ etc. Money rules all.My plan is good diet_ lots of exercise_ and periodic carotid artery sonoscans. BTW_ I have a PhD in physics and consider myself to be rational and good at evaluating data. The data/literature base related to Crestor and other statins_ cholesterol_ CRP_ inflammation and atherosclerosis is a real can of worms_ making a causal analysis very difficult.

462, 1, high cholesterol,overall feeling of being 90 years old when getting out of bed. EXTREMELY painful cramps in my calves and hamstrings to the point that I felt that the muscles would rip_ tear or snap. I felt that I would have to go to the hospital. The cramps literally made me scream in pain. I never in my life have experienced such pain from cramps. I also had extreme pain in both shoulders and because of all these issues I found myself doing less and less. Also would wake up with a swollen feeling in my ankles and fingers/hands/wrists. Nothing was ever just on one side.,after 5-6 years of apparently no side affects (or I just got used to them) I finally have developed issues that I just can't possibly deal with anymore and have decided that a better quality of life is more important than living miserable for a few extra years. To Crestor's credit it was the best statin to lower my cholesterol from 310 to 160 after going to the highest dosage of 40mg. However_ I have developed an overall feeling of being old before my time. I was seeing many different doctor's to see what was wrong. Thought I might have Lyme disease since I live in New Hampshire which has the highest incidence of this disease. Saw a rheumatoligist because I thought arthritis could be the culprit. Saw an orthopedic because of the back pain caused by the muscle cramps. None of the doctor's ever thought that Crestor was the problem. I feel extremely confident that Crestor in fact is the cause_ because after 2 weeks of being completely off the Crestor_ I have never felt better. Each day I feel better and better and the cramps are gradually subsiding. I did my own test and went back on the Crestor 5 times. Each time I started the Crestor_ the cramps came back the very next day without fail. I thank each and every person who added their own comments_ because it gave me the courage to take my own action by stopping the Crestor.,M,59,5  years40 mg 1X D,8/19/2010Email,Crestor

Well_ after reading the posts_ I understand it all. I am going to start taking CO Q 10_ it helped when I was on Lipitor.

I am optimistic for the first time since my doctor's have tried to treat my high cholesterol.,From what I have read_ Crestor is the strongest statin.

Before Crestor_ I was 100% healthy_ didn't have a sick day at work for 25 years!  I walked 2 miles a day almost everyday.  I did 30 minutes weight lifting 2 times a week_ and stretched daily.  This was my routine for 12 years.  After taking Crestor for 7 months_ I stopped my daily walking and other exercise workouts.  I was too tired to do any of it.  I became a couch potato.  Walking steps was becoming impossible.  The last straw was a severe lung infection that turned into pneumonia in April 2010.  I'm still battling with that even after 4 weeks.  If I had stayed on Crestor_ I would have become completely sedentary and probably become wheel chair bound.  All the benefits of lower cholesterol would be negated by a sedenary lifestyle and I would probably have died from inactivity which contributes to heart diesease and stroke.  I have many female family members who are living way into their 90s and who take zero  prescriptions.  I told my Doctor I will no longer take any prescriptions and hope to resume my exercise routine.  I will take high doses of vitamins_ drink lots of water and move everyday.  I hope this will help me to resume living a more active and pain free lifestyle and make it to age 100.  Cholesterol drugs are very dangerous and should not be used by anyone.

I origonally started with 40 mg of simvastatin then lovastatin and eventually 60mg to lower my cholesterol. That kept me about 206 for total cholesterol. 10mg of Crestor got my total down to 167... from 313. Then I started getting severe hand and foot pain. So painfull I couldn't use my hand to open a door or button a shirt. I was unable to walk normally due to pain on the top of my feet. I had to shuffle. The pain typically lasted a few hrs - a couple days and came and went. I am down to 5mg now and still experience this pain. I have experimented and found that if you exercise EVERY day and eat HEALTHY ie oatmeal for breakfast_ salad for lunch and something baked/grilled for dinner this too will keep my cholesterol under 189 without taking Crestor.

But with Crestor I could barely walk.  I had told my doctor that the Lipitor was making my knees hurt and he told me he did not think it would cause the knee pain.  This drug is poison.  It worries me to think how many people are having the same side effects as I have.  Doctors are probably not even considering the possibility that these are being caused by the Crestor.

I've played contact sports my whole life (football_ rugby_ etc)_ had numerous injuries & never experienced these kinds of reactions to what felt like minor injuries. Within a few days of taking Crestor I began experiencing constant muscle tightness and fatigue_ things I normally associate with dehydration & extreme stress. I felt hot flashes plus aches_ especially in my neck_ shoulders_ hands and oddly my shins. I ascribed this to tension (lots of work pressure)_ too much coffee_ as well as Holiday misbehavior (too much drinking _eating_ etc.) I began to feel ""brittle"" like my muscles were stretched too thin as well as a loss of strength & stamina. Playing soccer I kicked a ball and felt a searing tearing sensation in my ankle_ which has turned out to be damage to the sheathing which covers my tendons in that area. I whacked my palm during the same period. The traumatized area has swollen and a large pea sized thickening of the fascia has developed. My doctor says they are permanent. Clearly my muscle tissue was being affected by Crestor and I don't believe I would have damaged either of these areas if my muscles had not been so oddly stressed.

I quit it and within a month I was waking up in the morning without the pain and lugging cement blocks in the garden again.It is hard to associate muscle pain with a cholesterol medication_ so many people are probably suffering with the same problem without connecting it to the Crestor (further research told me that it is NOT ""extremely rare"" that about 15% of users get the pain and weakness that is the first sign of a serious kidney problem).

628, 1, Lower cholesterol,"I took Crestor for about 3 years.  After several months I began experiencing pain in both feet_ ankles_ and lower legs. I blamed it on exercise and aging.  Over the past several years the pain increased to extreme.  I felt like my ankles and feet were broken and the calf pain was as if the tissue were ripping from my bones.  After cutting back on exercise I noticed that the pain didn't seem to be associated with exercise.  Finally I stopped the Crestor and the relief was almost immediate.  The pain never went away completely but instead of being agonizing_ it was just dull_ like a bruise.  After 6 weeks off Crestor I only have bad pain in my left foot and calf.  It is constant and at times severe.  I limp now almost constantly.  Still have the feeling of ""broken bones"".  MRI_ Doppler study_ and x-rays show nothing.  I am very frustrated.

The only change was the Crestor so I went to look for side effects and found this site.  I am quiting today.  I took fish oil for a year and lowered it almost 200 points.  I will stick with that.  The pain associated with the Crestor is not worth it.  I was sure I was getting arthritis at an extremely rapid rate.  Glad to hear I am not imagining this.  Will check back when been off a couple of weeks and let you know if the pain is gone and I can use my hands without severe pain.,STAY AWAY FROM IT!!  I have been a RN for 31 yrs and never dreamed it took a website like this one to help me figure out where all this joint pain was coming from.,F,54,4  weeks,11/18/2009Email,Crestor

653, 1, To raise my HDL,Initially there were no noticeable side effects_ then almost from nowhere I started feeling leg pain and joint pain.  The pain got worse after about 3 weeks to the point where it was very difficult if not impossible to walk comfortably.  I use to walk about 3 miles every evening_ and now I can no longer do that.  Finally stopped taking Crestor after almost four (4) weeks_ realizing that the only change that could have caused this discomfort was taking Crestor.  Within 24 hours much of the muscle pain seemed to diapear.  The joint paint in my left knee continues to be problematic even after being off of this medication for nearly four weeks.,This medication should be taken off the market.  After nearly four weeks of being off the medication the joint pain is still almost unbearable.  Trying to walk on a knee that keeps on popping is extremely painful and disconcerting.  NEVER take this medication !!,M,56,28  days,11/5/2009Email,Crestor
654, 1, High Cholestrol (Bad),Headaches_ severe weakness in arms and legs_ chronic exhaustion_back _neck shoulder pain. nausea_ severe chest pains_ muscle spasms.,Ive been taking 5mg of crestor for roughly 3 months. I spoken to my doctor with regards to the above symptoms. He assures me its not the crestor causing these. Until i started taking this medication I was active energetic and happy.Now It takes energy just to get outta bed and go to work.After reading these postings its pretty obvious to me whats causing me to feel this way . Ive had Heart Stress test done  -no fault found_ Ultra sounds on my heart spleen pancreas and intestine -no faults found Ive had MRI's cat scans all clean yet it still amazes me my doctor doesn't think its the crestor. Im stopping this drug immediately after reading about these side effects. Funny how the crestor site fails to mention how often it seems these occur. Statins are a scary drug and seems one with many side effects.,M,40,3  months,11/5/2009,Crestor

Trigs went from 565 to 202 in that time. I need to get in for current bloodwork but I was very impressed with the results. I've had carpal tunnel in both arms_ shoulders & elbows for 15 yrs and have a pretty high tolerance for pain (50 yr old female). I don't know that I'd even notice a bit more joint pain_ although I haven't had any to my knowledge. I'll probably cut back to 5 mg/day to see if the results stay good. I have no insurance or health care of any kind so all medication & bloodwork costs are out of pocket (& expensive). So if I can get by on 1/2 the dose that'd be great.,F,50,6  months,10/21/2009Email,Crestor

Cause of hip distruction..unknown...I know why everything change after starting Crestor 5mg..Take this drug with much caution! for hrs.,My rehab Dr. told me to stop it and said sometimes the jointcomplications are irreversible. I'm now experiencing rt hip painI've had enough replacement..I haven't worked for 15 monthes due to surgeries and rehab.

660, 2, Cholesterol was between 240 and 260,I was prescribed 5mg Crestor and I took 1/2 pill every other day. After one month my cholesterol went from 236 to 116. After about three months I began to notice that I was breathing through my mouth.  In a couple of days I began to experience a feeling of fullnes  - as though my food was not digesting.  After a few days of this I had a violent episode of vomiting.  I cannot overstate how dramatic this was; I have vomited about five times in my almost 7 decades.,I stopped taking Crestor for about 10 days and after all the symptoms went away_ I took 1/2 of a pill.  The next day the fullness began to reappear.  I stopped for another ten days and once again took 1/2 pill.  After two days I once again began breathing through my mouth.  I have not been able to tolerate any of the statin drugs and I desperately want to find a way to take this. Other than cholesterol I am in excellent health.,F,66,3  months,10/8/2009Email,Crestor
661, 1, high cholesterol level,I have suffered from mid-thoracic back pain (bone) and muscle pain in the back for 5 years_ about the time I was started on cholesterol lowering drugs.  I thought this pain was work related and have had to retire early. I have had many treatments to relieve my pain such as steroid injections and even a very expensive Radio-frequency Neurotomy proceedure performed in six areas of my back. I am taking strong daily analgesics and Naproxen to help me cope. This can't be good for me! My concern though is that this has set up a viscous cycle that will be hard to reverse.  I had gone off Crestor for a few weeks with only marginal relief.  However my MD told me to go back on it at my last visit and things have gotten much worse. I exercise at a gym each day followed by a hot tub to maintain sanity.I would rather have a shorter life and higher lipid levels than  fight with daily pain affecting all areas of my life.Sound familiar to anyone?,,M,63,12  months,10/5/2009Email,Crestor
662, 1, High cholesterol,Heart pounding_ difficulty sleeping_ itching and some constipation.,I was hoping that I would be able to take Crestor after finding that Zocor and Zetia would not work for me because of the vast side effects.  Both Zocor and Zetia caused such weakness in my muscles and legs that I discontinued them last year.  I have a small frame_ have always weighed approximately the same (125 lbs) and cannot imagine why I am being given the same dosage as people twice my size.  I metabolize food and drink very quickly and generally take only half the dosage given to me_ unless it is an antibiotic.  This .10 milligram tablet affected me very negatively as soon as I began taking it.  Am wondering if anyone ever starts with lower doses rather than what the drug company recommends at .10 milligrams???  I do not mind taking something for my high cholesterol although I don't have a family history of heart disease or any other indicators that I will develop that - do have more calcium in my arteries than I should have and that is why the doctor recommended it.  I eat correctly and can't adjust there and exercise daily so can't adjust there.......what a puzzle?  I cut back today and am taking only 1/4 of the tablet - .025 dosage - to see if that helps but I want to be able to sleep soundly as I did before I began taking this drug.,F,68,8  days,10/2/2009,Crestor
663, 1, high cholesterol,extreme left shoulder pain and fatigue,i took 5 mg about a month_ but it didnt lower my cholesterol so doctor increased me to l0 mg.  after a week or so i had extreme left shoulder pain.  thought it was from being on the computer too long.  i was taking 2 extra strength tylenol every 4 hours and laying on a heating pad to survive. i finally couldnt stand it any more so i went to urgent care.  doctor there gave me steroids for inflammation because i have bad kidneys and couldnt take motrin.  steroids helped but after i had taken all of them_ the pain came back.  i went back to urgent care and same doctor gave me stronger steroids.  after i finished this steroid pack_ the pain came back.  the only thing i had done differently in the past 2 months was start the crestor so i went online to see about the side effects.  i found this website and immediately stopped taking it.  within a day or two my shoulder pain was completely gone.  i am still more tired than i was before_ but i'm hoping i'll eventually be completely back to normal.  it did lower my cholesterol 40 points but it wasnt worth it.  i am taking fish oil now and walking.  if anyone has any other suggestions on how to lower cholesterol without taking a statin_ please let me know. ,F,54,2  months,10/2/2009Email,Crestor

Constipation on 5 mg_ no constipation on 2.5 mg.,My cardiologist_ knowing my penchant for side effects_ has started me out on 5 mg per day but says 2.5 mg can produce good results.  Just read a book by Dr. Jay Cohen who wrote that the average percent of lower cholesterol with Crestor is 46%-52% taking 10 mg_ 45% taking 5 mg_ 41% taking 2.5 mg_ and 34% taking 1.25 mg.  Whether I lower my numbers by 46% or 34% is of no consequence.  I'll take whatever I can get.  I felt lousy after a few days on 5 mg_ and have been splitting the pill in half for over two weeks now.  The side effects are still there but much more tolerable.  I'll know on October 12 how well the drug has worked when I get my next bloodwork.  Meanwhile_ my doc says he's okay with 2.5 mg per day if it produces results.  And if need be_ I'll go down to 1.25 mg and see how that works.,M,60,3  weeks,9/10/2009,Crestor

The pain near my rib cage sort of reminded me of a gall bladder attack I had experienced 5 years earlier_ but not quite as sharp. It hurt to take deep breaths. I have Atrial fibrillation so I knew it wasn't heart pain_ it was more of a gaseous pain.

Well_ they did after about a month. Stopped taking the Crestor 3 weeks ago but still have serious muscle aches in my shoulders_ arms and upper chest.

734, 1, Cholestorol,Rhabdomyolysis is a serious disorder that causes kidney damage resulting from toxic effects of the contents of muscle cells. Myoglobin is an iron-containing pigment found in the skeletal muscle. When the skeletal muscle is damaged_ the myoglobin is released into the bloodstream. It is filtered out of the bloodstream by the kidneys. Myoglobin may obstruct the structures of the kidney_ causing damage such as acute tubular necrosis or kidney failure. Myoglobin breaks down into potentially toxic compounds_ which will also cause kidney failure. It is important to treat Rhabdomyolysis quickly. Early and aggressive hydration may prevent complications by rapidly eliminating the myoglobin out of the kidneys. The hydration needs with muscle necrosis may approximate the massive fluid volume needs of a severely burned patient. This may involve intravenous administration of several liters of fluid until the condition stabilizes. Diuretic medications such as mannitol or furosemide may,I expeirenced all of the side effects listed in the previous column. Please use caution when taking this drug! I stopped after 7 days.

739, 1, Family History - High Cholestral,Debililating side effects after only six doses as noted in my prior post about a week ago. After one week off medication I have returned to feeling normal again aside from an acute Sciatic nerve condition on my left side that was brought BACK after several years by the medication. I am going to my Chiropractor today. Hell I can deal with the Sciatica and I am sure it will pass. Small amount to pay in terms of what this drug would have certainly did to me over the long run. Worst week of my life!Summary: My BERKLEE bloodwork numbers must have been skewed and abnormal the first time and showed higher numbers. Maybe I ate something a day before that caused this who knows? Anyway I am off Crestor or any other statin for sure and will continue the flaxseed_ Pomegranate concentrate with a dose of red yeast rice each night before bed. Just to keep an advantage over any PREDISPOSITION to a heart attack because of family history. I never want to experience the pain that I did while on Crestor,"Went back to my Cardiologist and explained the problems. He summized to my complete amazement that the muscle pains could be caused by my profession as a fitness trainer. I laughed and told him ""first off"" I could not find the energy to move let alone exercise while on Crestor. Not to mention the pain I was experiencing at the time. Addmittedly I told him that I may not have been so in tune with my diet_ but am very in tune with my body and how it is SUPPOSED to feel without any exercise. He went on to say that my charts all looked good _ cholestral borderline_ EKG_ Heart Scan_ Calcium score 0 etc. He went on to explain that he was being cautius because of family history. I defended that by telling him that my father never exercised_ was overweight_ had high blood pressure and ate a fatty diet. I did not think I fit that mold at all. As it turns out he orders another blood test and I get the results: Total cholestral 158 HDL 56 LDL 65 surely 6 doses of this drug could not bring down my numbers this much!

After 6 weeks_ LDL was down from 149 to 85; overall cholesterol down from 239 to 162. HDL & triglycerides stayed at about same levels (they were never an issue). After about 3 mos._ I noticed a big increase in anxiety & then some depression. It took me a while to ask if there was a relationship between these symptoms & Crestor.  I went off of it for about 6 mos. Anx./deprs. got noticeably better. Started taking again; after a couple of months_ same issue.  Kept on it for about 6 mos._ then off again.  Went back on at 5 mg. & have been faithful for 6 mos. Same issue has returned.  However_ my numbers are about the same with 5 mg. as with 10.

752, 1, high cholesterol,,Started at 10 mg then increased to 20 mg. Little things started happening to me that I did not associate with Crestor. Pain in right hip when walking. Pain down back of leg after driving. Temporal headaches. Mild shoulder pain at bedtime. All these symptoms came and went over a period of time and I could find something to blame them on. Car seat position or to much red wine or I lifted something heavy or I when exercising I walked to far or fast. At 71 you expect some things to hurt once in awhile. What I think was happening these minor pains were getting ready to combine and attack at the same time. The day after driving home from Florida at the end of March (1400 miles in 2 days) I was racked with pain in my shoulders_ hips and legs. Blamed it on the drive and went to my chiropractor. After too many visits without enough improvement I went to my doctor. He said I have Polymyalgia Rheumatica and prescibed 20 mg Prednisone. At this point I would take anything to relieve the pain. I have been on it for six weeks now and finally started thinking about Crestor side affects after watching one of their commercials on TV. Started searching the net and I'm convinced my problems are from Crestor. I stopped taking it last night and am not taking it again until the pain is gone or unchanged. I have a feeling its going to take awhile to find out because of the length of time I have taken Crestor and the 20mg dose.If you have any new shoulder joint pain at all after going on Crestor GE,M,71,12  months,5/11/2009Email,Crestor

754, 1, to reduce LDL to optimal guideline,"Left ankle tendonitis (""sprain"") pain preventing walking.  Possibly left plantar fascia (sole) pain/fatigue discouraging walking after a few blocks.  Possibly also pain in right calf muscle after few blocks.  Possibly also pain in right hip after few blocks.",I want to skip your 1-5 satisfaction report as my impression is way more complicated.  Crestor DOES reduce LDL very well.  But it also causes side effects (pain and fatigue in joints_ muscles_ ligaments_ tendons) much more often than most doctors realize.  Further complicating these effects is that they may become evident only after years of usage.  Some people_ for unknown reasons_ are hardly affected at all--especially at low doses for limited periods.  (Remember_ FDA trials can't go on for years.)  Further_ these symptoms are easily confused with those of common problems like arthritis and peripheral artery disease.  (Worsening this confusion is modern imaging that shows clearly that cartilage_ for example_ is worn away.  Or that there are artery blockages.  These are common_ but they doesn't necessarily mean the cause of one's pain has been found!)  A personal note: because of a bad family history_ I took Zocor 10mg_ then Lipitor 10mg for years.  (I now suspect that unrecognized discomfort and fatigue gradually caused me to give up walking_ my main exercise_ during that time.  Result:  weakness and weight gain--bad for the heart in themselves.)  After a disastrous experience_ I resolved never to take ANY statin drug again.  But later I foolishly let my internist talk me into Crestor.  Again_ to be cautious_ I took only 2.5mg (I cut tablets in half) which_ since there seemed to be no side effects_ I eventually increased to 5mg.  Years later I have tendonitis--no walking.,M,89,30  years,5/8/2009,Crestor
755, 1, elevated ldh,severe nausea_ nightmares_ shoulder pain_ right kidney pain. After 6 weeks only of Crestor 5 mg_ pain in the calves and hamstrings was severe and my legs would not hold me up. The Crestor  was stopped_ and even in 24 hours I had improved. In another 6 weeks_ I was well again.,I had been put on several of the other statins_ with milder_ but significant side effects. Crestor had the most severe side effects. I am now trying Moduchol 500mg AM and PM (hard to find_ available on Amazon.com) and PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE NICOTINIC ACID 500mg three times a day_ by doctor's orders. It's amazing how many pharmacists and doctors don't understand the difference. Plain Niacin over the counter is just a vitamin_ and shouldn't be mixed up with the nicotinic acid properly used for lipid therapy. I also became wise too late about reading labels for fat and salt_ and eliminating food habits that are not good for me. I only weigh 120#_ so weight is no problem.

756, 2, I have very high cholesterol,I have been experiencing leg and foot cramps and a sore shoulder since I started taking the drug in 1/09. Initially_ I had some gastro side effects which eventually went away.,I have had muscle issues with Lipitor so was taken off of that several years ago after a short time of usage. My doctor recommended I have a heart scan and I got a score of zero which seemed to indicate that though I had high cholesterol my arteries were clear of plaque. But a recent carotid scan showed a very minimal buildup of plaque so again my doctor said let's try Crestor which is water soluable instead of fat soluable like the other statins. He has now taken me off of the drug to see if my muscle spasms and cramping go away and we can blame the drug. I also have hypothroidism and the information about Crestor says the drug should be administered very carefully to people with this condition. I as a general rule am very anti-drug. I know for every benefit their is a downside...a side effect and maybe a few years from now they come out and tell you how unsafe it actually is. The drug companies want all of us on statins.

757, 1, high cholestreol,Pravastatin lowered my cholesterol 60 points in 9 months_ without any noticeable side effects_ but my primary thought we could do better_ especially with the HDL. So...10 days on 80 mg of Zocor rendered me profoundly tired and fighting with myself to do things that only require normal amounts of activity.Crestor had the same effect as the Zocor in only 5 days! After 5 days on 20 mg Crestor_ I once again experienced extreme tiredness and general malaise. After 5 days off of the drug I did a small roofing job that required 7 hours of moderate varied activities and after a 30 minute ride home got out of my van and felt nearly crippled. I have never had this experience before.Crestor and Zocor also gave me late evening acid stomach which I controlled with Rolaids.,I will never know if Crestor can effectively lower my colesterol_ since I will not tolerate the side effects long enough to find out. After a one month statin hiatis I will try the Pravastatin again. After all_ significant improvement is just that.,M,67,5  days,5/1/2009,Crestor

760, 1, For high cholesterol_ high LDL,Mainly muscle twitches and spasms_ but also being 'excited' like drinking too much coffee,I tried Crestor first for three weeks_ then experienced the side effects and stopped taking it.  Then the side effects disappeared after about one week.  After a few weeks I decided to try again and took Crestor for two months.  Side effects started to appear_ and I stopped taking it_ again.  This time_ the side effects lasted for more than one month.  After reading on the Internet about possible solutions_ I decided to try Coenzyme Q10 (100 mg twice daily)_ and after this treatment_ the twitches and spasms are almost gone!

761, 1, inherited hi cholesterol,,This is a follow-up to my post yesterday.  Today I went off Crestor.  After my crashing fatigue at work yesterday and growing lethargy over the past 2 months along with growing chest/back pain and joint pain_ I decided that I just cannot function with these symptoms.  I could possibly live with the pain but I cannot live with fatigue so severe that I cannot physically stay awake.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do now.  I tried Zocor about 2 years ago and had the same effects although not as much fatigue_ just mainly joint pain.  I had tried Cholestoff_ the natural supplement for the past 2 years and originally it had helped by lowering my cholesterol 30 points in 3 months but after 2 years_ my cholesterol is right back up where it was so it stopped working at some point.  So right now I'm feeling very defeated because it looks like statins just don't agree with me but yet at my high cholesterol level (250) and with family history dictating that_ I cannot afford NOT to be on something either.,F,46,2  months,4/28/2009,Crestor

Well_ it was - the side effects came on FASTER!  Tingling the first night_ joint and muscle pains within a week and the mental fog and aggression after only two weeks.  This is a nasty drug and the side effects can mimic those of aging. And on pravacol_ my LDL actually went UP!

I was never told when to take this med but talking to others I was told night time is the best. When I mentioned this to my doctor she said Crestor is active for 24 hours so it really shouldn't matter when but the body produces more cholestrol at night. After 7 weeks my cholestrol dropped to 189 but I'm convinced that has more to do with the fact I started walking on a indoor track for 40 minutes 5 times a week.It is proven that excerise reduces cholesterol levels.

A very small dose with food seems to work best for me.,I found that this med helped me right after my heart attack.  I had two stents placed in my right coronary artery_ but since it was over three hours from the start of the ahHA_ I had a dead area on my heart.  I was having problems with Vytorin.  Zetia didn't do anything for me.  Crestor gives me stamina and energy I wouldn't have otherwise.  As of February 2009_ My TC is 189_ my LDL is 108_ my TGL is 281_ and my HDL is 24.  I will say_ Dr. Esselstyn's book_ Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease_ has made a huge difference in my continuing angina.

772, 1, Total cholesterol level 238,I had difficulty sleeping that night after taking 5mg of Crestor for the first time. Actually_ when I saw the doctor's precription I was glad that I was started at a low dose because I know someone on 20mg of the drug. That said_ I was surprised to experience the side effects that I did on only 5mg: difficulty sleeping that first night_ slight nausea the following day_ some light-headedness_ slight chest discomfort (a very slight but noticeable dull discomfort--not pain)_ an acid-reflux type experience_ and tiredness. I actually thought twice about driving to get new tires for my car because I did not feel quite right. It kind of reminded me of the time I started smoking at age 17: I coughed my head off. But after a while_ I didn't have those symtoms. That should have been a warning. (P.S. I smoked for ten years and gave it up 33 years ago.) I thought_ maybe this Crestor is telling me something on the first day of use.,I was prescribed Lipitor last year for the same high cholesterol issue: it's been regularly higher than 200_ averaging about 220 for ten years now. My HDL and tri- are ok. I stopped taking Lipitor because of the cramps_ nightmares_ and terrible feeling. But last year I did something different_ other than having a pretty good diet: I walked about two miles every day. It must have helped because last year my number was 190--without medication. I got lazy_ stopped the walking_ and when I had my annual physical recently_ it shot back up to 238. Needless to say_ I'm off the Crestor and back to walking. This med may help others who are at especially high risk--but not me. Every case is different. The problem is that we live in an easy-fix world.,M,66,1  days,4/3/2009,Crestor

(I got a stronger glasses prescription a couple of months after starting Crestor and now another few months later_ cannot see... again.)  Tired_ burning eyes.  Fatigue so bad I feel 98 instead of 58.  Gained about 10 lbs. in a flash when beginning this drug.  Have NOT been able to get these pounds off.  Depression.  Fuzzy memory.  Hard to concentrate.  Loss of strength and greatly reduced stamina.  Arthritis has been much worse since I started it.,When I started Crestor I was having a run of upper respiratory viruses and felt bad anyway_ so I think that masked the fact that Crestor was making me feel lousy.  The viruses finally stopped but the feeling lousy didn't and I just didn't put two and two together for nearly a year.  Then to add to my misery_ I started on Lisinopril last November_ which has some of the same side effects as Crestor_ notably swelling in the hands.  (Since on both drugs I am now at the point where I often cannot close my left hand enough to make a fist_ it is so swollen.)  I stopped them both  cold-turkey  two days ago.  I hope my body will heal from these nasty symptoms and I can begin to feel like myself again.  I will NEVER let my doctor talk me into another statin or hypertension drug.

802, 1, Lipator not fast enough for Dr.,This is a update to my post of 1/16/09.  The doctor redid my blood test to see if the kidney function elevation was a fluke in the first test and it was still high.  They also discovered that my Potassium levels are very high.  High Potassium is evidence that Crestor has been breaking down my muscles_ which is why they felt sore.  This condition can lead to Hyperkalemia which is deadly.From what I have been able to research on my own_ Crestor muscle pain and rhabdomyolosis are the result of toxic levels of potassium and myoglobin release into the blood stream. This causes a decrease in the amount of blood that is circulating in the body (called hypovolemia). This can lead to the inability of the kidneys to function properly.The symptoms of Crestor muscle pain may indicate this condition so if you have it...my advice is to stop taking it and alert your doctor...I stopped taking it two days ago and feel better already.  I am going to drink plenty of water then go for new blood,This medicine has problems and I will never take it again.,M,62,90  days,2/18/2009,Crestor

Cardiologist got me on to 40 mg Crestor since along with Lipidil. Lipidil works on my lower intestine enzime and Crestor on my Liver to reduce my Liver from producing too much of the Bad Cholesterol LDL.This combination worked great and my Cholesterol is now down to a correct level.

Over past 3 years_ joint pain in shoulders_ hips_ and back is increasing.  Last year_ I developed muscle pain in my neck; woke up one morning with what felt like a couple of pinched nerves in my neck; the pain was so severe I could not get out of bed_ but after about 20 minutes the pain subsided enough for me to move around.  The neck pain has stayed with me over the last year_ along with slightly increase joint pain in hips_ back and shoulders.  The neck pain is the worst.  After x-rays and MRI_ doctors attribute pain to arthritis onset conditions; so much for small-town medicine.  Use an ice-wrap around neck to eleviate pain; chiropratic really did no good.  I have choosen to go off of Crestor completely for about 3 to 6 months to see if pain condition subside.

They just got worse and worse and it turns out that they are hives.  They burn and itch_ and usually go away after ~3 hrs.

I'm going to seek natural methods to lower my cholesterol.  Thanks Crestor manufacturer for hiding & downplaying the effects of this DANGEROUS drug.,"I'm certain that Crestor (10 mg / day) is causing the hives and diminished desire.  I took an antihistamine today to counter the effects and the reaction after doing extensive research.

My lipid profile was getting better_ LDL 3.7mmo/L (143mg/dL)_ HDL 1mmo/L (39mg/dL)_ but I noticed what I thought was a continous continous acid reflux (but wider_ not just in the center of the chest)_ and occassionally woke up gasping for air. My Cardioligist then increased the dose to 20mg. During the days that followed I found it difficult to breath_ and after 3 days woke up unable to get enough air. I walked to the hospital and noticed I could regain my breath whilst active_ but when I relaxed in the waiting room it returned. Chest X-Ray_ ECG and blood tests later_ it seemed I was not short on oxygen in the blood_ and it wasn't a heart attack. They couldn't say what was causing it_ but suggested I sleep with two pillows under my head. Switched back to 10mg the next day and it hasn't returned. I'm thinking now that the continious stomache ache is actually a lung ache!,I had my bypass in 1997. And have in the past tried Lipitor_ Pravocol_ Simvahexal and Zocor. Think I'll switch to 5mg Crestor + Ezetrol 10mg (as well as Plavix 10mg + 4g Salmon Oil which I'm on now)_ and see how that goes.

Ive never smoked or drunk alcohol excessively.I've tried Lipitor_ and two other statins (simvastatin and some other I don't remember the name of) but had terrible side effects from them (muscle pains and flu-like symptoms). I then tried fibrates; which caused nausea and didn't lower my cholesterol at all. I tried niacin - didn't work_ plant sterols - didn't work. So I forgot about my cholesterol seeing as there wasn't anything I could do about it.

970, 1, to lower cholesterol levels,I developed headaches after 8 weeks and more frequently after that_ at times very severe especially after even just 1/2 glass of wine.In addition to the headaches_ I develop pins and needles in my feet during week 20 of taking the drug.  Since I stopped taking Crestor 10_ the headaches have subsided and there is still a mild reminder of the pins and needles in both feet.,My doctor prescribed Crestor 10 after several other products on the market had very little effect lowering my cholesterol levels over a 3 year period.  Crestor 10 did indeed bring my cholesterol level down from 6.8 to 4.3 after a 6 month trial period_ but the frequent headaches were a concern.I had flue and colds more often than before and I suspect that the use of the drug suppresses the immune system (Cyclosporine)?  I also developed shingles for the first time ever during week 25 of taking Crestor 10  maybe as a result of a low immune system (for the records_ I am NOT HIV positive_ and do NOT suffer from cancer and I am NOT a diabetic).  ,M,42,180  days,1/3/2008,Crestor

1006, 1, Slightly elevated cholesterol,Within a week of starting my prescription for 5 mg Crestor_ I began to experience muscle aches in both upper arms.  When I told the doctor_ he said to cut the 5 mg pills in half.  He also admitted he had the same problems taking Crestor_ and said he had cut the pills in half also.  The arm aches seemed to go away after I cut the dosage to 2.5 mg_ but gradually other problems have appeared.  Both knees ache (the left knee is worse) after a short walk or mowing the lawn.  My pre-existing carpal tunnel problems in both wrists has worsened.  I also gradually became aware of frequent numbness in both hands when driving the car.  But what's worst is the leg cramps.  I remember now that I've had lots of leg cramps when sleeping since starting Crestor_ although I didn't initially associate them with taking Crestor.  Three days ago_ I had a particularly violent cramp in my left leg that woke me out of a sound sleep and took several very painful minutes to dissipate.,I only started this drug because of family medical history:  My father had several heart attacks and eventually succombed to one.  I have stopped taking this drug because I never had problems like this before.  The additional aches and pains this drug has caused me have prevented me from exercising as much as I know I should.

I have also been having difficulty sleeping_ frequent bouts of diarrea_ and the worst of all Panic Attacks. At first_ I thought I developed a food allergy but the more we put everything together it all started 6 days after starting Crestor. I have had difficulty thinking clearly_ memory loss and have felt a general sense of anxiety. My throat feels thick and constricted and I feel like a small child is sitting on my chest at the collar bone. I have visited the ER twice in the last 10 days for what I thought was an food allergic reaction.

1024, 1, to lower my colesterol,Over a few months(no problem in the beginning)_ I slowly developed a lot of severe joint and muscle pain in my legs. My legs felt like lead weights_ and going up a couple of flights of stairs left me breathing extremely hard_ it felt like my heart was going to bust.The pain in my knees was so extreme_I was afraid of falling on my face with every step. I was having a hard time going to the bathroom(#2) and became a gas factory. I saw the orthopaedic surgeon about the joint pain and he was thinking back or arhtritis. Quiting the drug has cleared most of my problems up.I still have a limp in my left leg and some pain in the joints and muscles of both legs. It has only been a week and I hope the rest of the pain goes away soon.,This drug is dangerous for some people_ extremely so because the problems appear late and are confused with another problem in the body. Especially when the prescribing doctor is not doing proper monitoring and is not educated enough on the effects of these statin drugs.,M,54,4  months,7/28/2007Email,Crestor

1032, 1, High Colesterol,Extreme pain in right thigh and calf.,After taking Crestor a few weeks I experienced extreme pain and weakness in my right leg; painful to climb stairs and painful to walk while playing golf.  After reading that Crestor can cause muscle damage I decided to stop taking it. In just a few days the pain was gone. At the next doctor's appt I told him what I had experienced and that I was not taking the drug.  He was skeptical that the drug caused the pain because it was only in one leg.  He suggested trying Lipitor and I reluctantly agreed.  After leaving his office with samples I took one pill.  By that night I was in extreme pain again so I have not had another.  I do think there was permanent damage in that leg.  It is weaker and aches after walking for long periods. I think there are a lot of people experiencing the same symptoms and do not realize it is the statins they are taking.

My test came back at 387_ with an amazing HDL level and very low triglycerides_ proving that what I do is great and what my body does on it's own is not!  I tried to improve my levels naturally with tons of supplements and whatnot and got no improvement.  At age 21_ I gave in and started a medication.  My doctor put me on 5 mg of Crestor and I was tested 1 month later.  My number went from 387 to 118.  They told me they'd never seen such a drastic improvement.

It all came along with beginning of taking this drug and the docs say I am fine from a health standpoint.  I have seen several since as I was really spooked anf paranoid.

I also felt heavy anxiety_ tiredness_ a do not care attitude.,I was taking 10 mg and it did reduce my cholesterol and the tests showed no damge to my liver_ kidneys and muscles.  But I felt/feel horrible.  I hope I can control my chol. through diet and excercise (although since popping the first pill I haven't seen a gym)_ if not I may try another brand or take my chances living a great feeling life.  Prior to I made the gym about 3 times a week.  I am curious how long it may take to get the statin out of my body after I stop taking it.

1071, 4, High Cholesterol,Acute Anxiety,The 10mg a day of Crestor that my Doctor put me on has reduced my bad Cholesterol by nearly 80%_ but my good cholesterol is still a few points below where it needs to be.  After having been on it for 10 months without any complaints I had a pretty severe anxiety attack and went to the ER thinking I was having problems with my heart.  The ER doc said the only abnormal thing was the blood in my artery was too high in Oxygen and too low in CO2_ which = hyperventilation. They found nothing abnormal in any of the other blood work or the x-rays_ everything was fine I am told.  What is odd for me about having had the anxiety attack is that I work in a very high stress atmosphere where I cope and excel better than most any of my peers.  So for me to have a problem of that nature is very disconcerting.  I am seeing my regular doctor for a follow up in a few days and plan to inquire about what a friend of mine in the medical field suggested: I may finally be having a reaction to the Crestor.,M,32,10  months,3/28/2007,Crestor

I had been taking Crestor for about 8 months and the doctor nor I even suspected the drug. After various testing_ he said it was stress. But the symptoms kept getting worse and eventually it got so bad I became a semi-invalid. Finally_ when searching online for a possible connection to the drug because of my continuing unexplained weight gain_ I came across a site where people complained of similar problems while taking this and other statins. I stopped the drug immediately and that was 8 months ago. Slowly_ I started feeling better_ although it took about 6 months before I could return to a half-way normal life. I still get occassional brain shivers and zaps_ but that's usually when I'm feeling tired or stressed.
