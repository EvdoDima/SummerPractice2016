0, 5, Cranial Hyperhytosis,When I first started to take it I had sore eyes and a very dry mouth. Now I just get a dry mouth_ which tends to disappear after about an hour.,This medication had totally changed my life- a dry mouth is a minor side effect for the advantages it's given me. No more sweat dripping down my face and neck_ no more stares and people asking me if I'm ok instead I can go out with confidence without a scarlet face and wear make up again. I only wish I was prescribed it 20 years ago.,F,58,1  years45mg,10/3/2015,Pro-banthine

2, 5, Hyperhidrosis,Sore throat_ occasional headaches like dehydrated feeling,works straight away_ sore throat is annoying at first but once you are used to the medication_ it is easier to work out how to get rid of it - I take 1-2 a day depending on my activity and I have found that I can now perform tasks that I couldnt do before without excessively sweating even when I havent taken a tablet for a few hours.,F,18,1  years30,12/15/2014,Pro-banthine
3, 5, Excessive sweating,Very very dry mouth,This has really made a difference to my life. Excessive sweating was making everything hard to do_ from day to day work to going for a walk on a cold day... My tshirt would change colour with sweat. Doctor at first was unhelpful when they got negative test results... After research i found out about this drug_ it's made such a difference... My forehead and neck don't sweat occasional my back does_ but I have my life back. The dry mouth is awful but it's a small price to pay.,M,31,5  weeks3 per day,12/6/2014,Pro-banthine

6, 4, craniofacial hyperhidrosis,Extremely dry mouth/tongue/throat_ sometimes very red face and neck.I have to drink lots of water to ease dry mouth_ yet still have had dental problems related to dry gums.Drug works best when taken on empty stomach_ 30-40mins before meals. I take 30mg 3-4 times a day.,,F,60,7  years90-120mg,7/26/2013,Pro-banthine

8, 1, excessive sweating,very severe dry mouth_ very sore throat_ flushing_ overheating_ sunburned feeling from retaining heat,I took 1 tiny pill and it worked within about 15 minutes. On the good side_ the sweat is only just now starting to come back two days later_ but not nearly as intense. On the other hand_ I absolutely will not take this pill again. Ever. I don't know if it's the drug itself that doesn't agree with me or if I need a lower dose or what_ but it did a serious number on me. For the next couple hours_ I was absolutely miserable. My face and arms turned blood red with trapped heat. NOTHING could get rid of the very severe dry mouth -- water_ hard candy_ chewing gum_ nothing. It quickly dried out my throat and made me lose my voice. Even my nose got severely dried out_ which isn't exactly a good thing during spring allergy season. The dry mouth abated in about 6-7 hours_ but it was a day and a half before my throat completely healed. I normally tolerate medicine really well_ so I was *not* expecting the intensity of these side effects_ nor was I expecting them to hit me as quickly as they did. Bottom line: if you are certain you have hyperhidrosis *only* and you can deal with the side effects_ this drug is extremely effective. If your sweating is caused by any kind of hormone imbalance or nervous system disorder that makes you feel hot_ do yourself a favor and stay far_ far away from this medication. Otherwise_ you'll feel like you've got a terrible sunburn wherever it is that you normally feel hot and sweat (in my case_ my face) and you will be completely miserable for hours afte,F,27,1  days15 2X D,5/1/2012,Pro-banthine

10, 4, Generalised Hyperhidrosis,Dry mouth_ sore throat,My excessive sweating has decreased a great deal. I take 3 15mg tabs a day an hour before food. Tried the extended release oxybutynin tabs. It never worked for me. Pro-banthine seems to have a great impact. I did insist my GP to prescribe this. Day 5 - I'm feeling much better and my anxiety levels are falling back to normal. Will review my comments in 5 days.,M,32,5  days15mg 3X D,1/26/2011Email,Pro-banthine
11, 3, Generalized Hyperhidrosis,Dry mouth_ constipation,As for the side effects they are really not that severe_ and if you suffer from generalized excessive sweating_ you don't really care anyway; whatever helps is fine.What lower my rate of satisfaction is 1) the short time during which the drug is effective 2) the uneffectiveness when NOT eating on empty stomach. I usually take some 60 mg on empty stomach in the morning_ which keeps me dry some 5-6 hours. But after that_ my afternoon dose is almost useless_ because then I have food in my body after eating lunch. The afternoon dose will last for 2-3 hours in my case_ which is not to satisfaction.So_ there were days when I ate 100 mg of this drug but still sweated a great deal only from walking home at evening. But then my HH is severe_ so other people might have better luck with it. As for me_ the drug keeps me dry for some hours if I take it on empty stomach_ but it doesn't provide the security I was looking for. I will try Robinul asap.,M,25,3  months,9/12/2009Email,Pro-banthine
12, 2, Hyperhidrosis,When it worked; extreme dry mouth_ eyes_ nose and ears. Water was required in order to swallow food. However my hands were very dry.,Results will vary from person to person. I used this a few years ago and would not use again. Robinul (glycopyrrolate) is alternative.,M,21,1  months,6/13/2009,Pro-banthine
13, 5, Hyperhidrosis-Sweating,Dry mouth. Disorientation.Difficulty swallowing food when taken half hour before eating. Slight loss of voice at times.,This drug has worked wonders and changed my life.Sweating is normal.Very effective when taken on an empty stomach & works within 30 mins.Side effects worse for following hour_ but acceptable & getting better.Can make eating difficult within 30 mins.Less effective & less side effects when taken near meals.Like most hyperhidrosis sufferers_ I wish I had found this drug 30 years ago.This is an anticholinergic/antispasmodic/antimuscarinic drug that inhibits nerve receptors.Side effect is it stops sweating.This is the only drug GP in UK can prescibe.Although side effects not too bad_ concerned about driving & being refered to specialist to try Robinul(Glycopyrrolate).Other drug option Ditropan (Oxybutynin).Sorry_ HH sufferers have to do their own homework on drugs because doctors are not very knowledgable.,M,50,4  weeks,7/5/2007Email,Pro-banthine
