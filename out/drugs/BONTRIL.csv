0, 4, to lose weight,Increased heart rate and increased blood pressure. I need to take it even only after 6 days.,It is a GREAT appetite suppressant and gives good energy. In 6 days I lost 6 pounds.

2, 4, Weigh Loss,Sleep disturbances if taken late at night,I was using this along with phentermine.  It was prescribed to me after I started to slowly regain my appitite back once I grew a tollerance to the phentermine.  It helps somewhat when I feel a strong urge to eat sweets in the evenings_ but if I take it past noon_ I toss and turn all night. Its a very mild appetite suppresant for those who may get too jittery on other diet medications.,F,30,20  days,9/13/2007,Bontril
