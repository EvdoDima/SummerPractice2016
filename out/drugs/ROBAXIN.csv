1, 5, Sciatica & disc issues,In combination with Narco_  Robaxin makes me sleepy which has been a good thing because it relaxes me and I am able to sleep comfortably.  I have gotten 3 days of total relief from the excruciating pain.,This is an excellent med_ short term.  I'm going to try to reduce the dosage to 3 times per day as I don't want to become dependent.  I'm going to have an epidural in 2 days and hope that helps.  I know I may need more than one injection but it's worth trying. I don't want to take meds more than absolutely necessary.,F,74,4  days750mg 4X D,5/17/2016Email,Robaxin

6, 4, Cervical spine surgery,Robaxin generic brand mostly made me relaxed and sleepy when I was taking half the pill.  I was also taking this medicine in conjunction with hydrocodone 5Â–325. I never took a whole pill because I felt the dosage was a bit high.  I also noticed an increase in blood pressure roughly a little less then 150/100 on average_ and some head pains. That could've also been due to the pain after surgery and stress_ so can't guarantee that.  Overall by taking half of that pill every four hours on a routine basis over the past four days it has helped with the pain and the muscle spasm's from surgery. This medicine Rx  had replaced a 5 mg dose of Valium 2 times a day  after surgery.  I did notice this medicine at the half dose of 375 mg gave me heartburn made my Gerd worse.  I cannot verify what the entire dose of 750 mg would do because I never took one whole pill at one time.  My medicine was not a time release medicine therefore I can break mine up and have half a pill every four hours without a problem.  Total dose a day was 750 mg three times a day.,I had no major side effects from it except for maybe the heartburn_ and drowsiness was the most noted in conjunction with this medicine at 375 mg dose.  Taking this medicine within an hour of hydrocodone made the drowsiness increase.  I will be on this medication for two weeks.,F,41,4  days750,1/31/2016Email,Robaxin

33, 4, Lower back pain and sciatica,Drowsiness and dysphoria when taken on an empty stomach. When taken with food_ I did not notice any side effects.,I injured my lower back about two weeks ago_ and have had sciatic nerve pain and lower back pain ever since. Never been in so much pain! Went to the doc after one week. Doc said it's not a disc issue and that it will resolve in a few weeks. They recommended Motrin_ which I told them I had been taking without relief. They gave me Robaxin to use in conjunction with my Motrin. Noticed relief the first night I took it! It's no miracle drug but does help if you are taking it for the right reasons. For people saying it doesn't help with pain: IT'S NOT A PAIN RELIEVER! It is a muscle relaxer! It relaxes muscles by depressing your CNS. Sometimes pain relief results from the muscle relaxation_ but it is not a guarantee. In my particular case_ it worked GREAT the first night... and has worked so-so since then. However_ it is nice that I only experience the side effects when taken on an empty stomach.,M,30,6  days750 MG 3X D,11/8/2012Email,Robaxin

51, 5, Acute lumbar sprain_ L4 L5,None_ so far.,I have been Rx'd this drug (750mg strength) for two different episodes of acute lumbar sprains in the same location; I have also gone through episodes of lumbar sprains in the same location without this drug.  Each time I used Robaxin_ the length of my recovery time was shortened and the amount of pain/stiffness/decreased mobility I went through during recovery was noticeably lessened (compared to my experiences without the drug and with all other things I do during a sprain being the same such as wearing lumbar support_ icing the area to help reduce inflammation_ and getting chiropractic help).  Not sure if it is due to the drug_ but before I was ever Rx'd this drug_ my multiple episodes of lumbar trouble were very close together over a period of about 6-8 months.  After recovery from the first episode where I used Robaxin (1 pill at night for 30 days)_ it was well over a year and a half before I had another sprain.  I was given Vicodin in addition to Robaxin with my most recent sprain (the worst sprain I've had so far too)-- honestly_ I think the effects of the Robaxin are much better than anything the Vicodin was supposed to contribute to my recovery (I quit Vicodin after 2 days).   This time I used 1 Robaxin pill every 8 hours for the first 4 days_ then I dropped to 1 pill in am/1 pill before bed -- I plan to drop to 1 pill before bedtime as soon as possible...whatever it takes to avoid re-spraining that area until everything is really healed up.,F,48,9  days,9/20/2009,Robaxin
52, 5, muscle pain from ehlers danlos,none. Sometimes it makes me sleey if I take it with my antiinflammatory,I've used it for years and it never affected my daytime activities.

58, 4, c-spine stenosis -> shoulder spasms,Minor drowsiness - not nearly as bad as Flexeril or Skelaxin.  The pills taste very nasty_ and the round flat 500 mg tabs are awkward to swallow.,I have used the NSAID + muscle relaxant combo to treat periodic flare-ups of muscle spasms due to degenerative bone spurs in my neck.  The magic recipe for me seems to be 800 mg ibuprofen (Motrin) + 1000-1500 mg methocarbamol (Robaxin) three times a day.  The other relaxants work OK (also tried Flexeril and Skelaxin)_ but they make me way too sleepy.,M,47,10  years,10/6/2006Email,Robaxin

So I was a little leery of trying another muscle relaxant. I was prescribed 500 mg every 6 hours_ but started at only 250 mg and got immediate relief with no negative side effects. Maybe it would be too mild for most people_ but with the other meds i take I have to be careful.,M,45,30  days,10/4/2005,Robaxin
