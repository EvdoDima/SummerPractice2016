0, 1, celiac plexus block,"Went in to get a celiac plexus block. Was given three doses of versed. Kept telling the docs that I was fully awake_ aware_ and very anxious because what they were doing hurt considerably. I have been put under for multiple procedures_ and know the point when you are starting to go ""out."" This never occurred. They just kept repeating that I was fine and I would ""forget everything."" To which I kept reiterating that I would not and the versed wasn't working. They might as well have given me water in my IV. I ended up jumping off of the table in pain_ and had to leave.My main doctor's office that referred me to have the procedure kept telling me that there's no way I would remember anything.Wish that was the case. Would not recommend.",,F,29,1  days,8/8/2016,Versed

9, 1, For a biopsy of my liver,I woke up twice during the procedure_ screaming with pain. I kept telling them to give me more Fentanyl. Post-biopsy I had very elevated systolic blood pressure & increased heart rate.  I also had difficulty breathing & could not get a deep breath.  The night of the procedure I awoke with pain every time I took a breath_ & felt I was not getting any full breath's.  The next morning I started experiencing severe muscle cramping in my feet & calves. They were very prolonged & I had to stretch out of every one. I also felt very dizzy & lightheaded for a couple of days. The drug also caused extreme nausea & I am sure would have ended in vomiting had I not been taking Zofran.  I had also experienced waking up in excruciating pain during a previous colonoscopy.  I believe that because of the amnesiac effects_ the nurse both times gave far lower doses the f pain medication than was necessary for the procedure.  After looking up all the side effects of this drug_ & having experienced nearly all of them_ Zi will refuse to ever have this drug used on me again. It was a horrible experience both times_ & remembering the pain from the previous procedure 10 years earlier_ I should have refused the drug this time.,I will never allow Versed to be used again on myself_ nor anyone I know. The ironic thing is I am a critical care nurse & had used this drug many times for conscious sedation. In the future_ I will not participate in any procedures using Versed.,F,58,1  days?,3/27/2016Email,Versed

I can tell before the first surgery I could do numbers in my head_ Remember what I said yesterday_ Figure volumes and amount of product I needed in my head. I was a builder. Now can't remember crap_ short term memory. Versed is the only drug that could have caused my memory problems. Its coming back slowly_ It was 2 years since I have been versed. I'm telling you_ SAY NO to VERSED>,SAY NO TO VERSED_ and ask when they say this will just calm you down what is is and ask how does it work.

14, 5, Surgery,None,They gave me versed right before my surgery. It made me very calm_ when I had previously been nervous.

15, 1, Hip Replacement Surgery,I was given Versed before_ during and after my hip replacement surgery.  I remember nothing including the surgeon seeing me after surgery to discuss complications and what I could and couldn't do.  The surgeon visited me the next day and told me again and yet I couldn't remember.  It took 6 days before I could comprehend and remember the complications and not continue to hurt myself.,It's now been 17 weeks today since my surgery.  I don't know if it's a result of the Versed_ the sick feeling of being unable to remember and what may have happened or what but I am severely depressed.  I have no reason to be depressed_ I caused no damage by not remembering what I was not to do because of the complications.  I am healed and in great shape.  No more hip pain_ but I am soooo depressed that I am now seeking professional help.  I've never been like this before.  I am not suicidal at this point but I don't want to live.,M,63,1  timesunknown 1X D,3/16/2016Email,Versed

24, 5, histeroscopy D&C with spinal anesth,"Lack of balance during recovery. Mild ""hangover"" for a few days.",I feel that I owe my satisfaction with the drug almost entirely to the very considerate and sensitive treatment I received from everyone concerned; they gave me full information about all the options in a preop visit and respected my choices. I was extremely frightened about having a surgical procedure as a result of various terrible experiences_ and I chose to have a spinal because I wanted to be awake but I didn't want to feel anything. I said they could give me Versed only if I explicitly asked for it. As my lower body became numb I began to feel some anxiety that I could not move my legs. I asked for a little Versed while I listened to music on my cell phone. From there on the experience was positively pleasant. I don't think I lost consciousness and I didn't feel it as a loss of control. Recovery was fine_ although my balance was a little off and I had a bit of a hangover the next morning. But the overall experience was great. Maybe another time I would take less or none if I felt less afraid. I would never choose conscious sedation alone for a painful procedure_ I would just take it for the associated anxiety.,F,65,1  days 1X D,1/31/2016,Versed
25, 1, Cervical Epidural Steroid inj.,"Versed did not work for me at all. I felt the Doc fishing around in my neck with the needle_ heard crunching when he hit several bones_and heard the Doctor say ""God dammit I can't get at the f - ing epidural space""! Finally_ I felt a red hot pain when he stabbed a nerve so I cried out and flinched... that was when the Doc started shouting ""Give her more Versed_ give her more Versed_ give her more Versed. I should point out that I'm 5'7"" and weigh 110lb; I shouldn't have needed a dose large enough for a horse. I do not take any meds that would increase metabolism of benzos_nor am I tolerant of benzos (one 5mg Diazepam tab will make me loopy for 3 days).

26, 2, colonoscopy and endoscopy,I felt everything during the colonoscopy.  I felt as if the doctor was impatient with me and just wanted the procedure to be done.

27, 1, lumbar injections & nerve burning,No reduction in pain. Muscle spasms for 12-14hrs after each dose_ I continue to have fuzzy/foggy thinking_ struggle to find words and just space out sometimes with no memory of the current event. These things are still happening on a daily basis.,Over the last 5 yrs I have had versed for lumbar injections 3 times_ before undergoing nerve burning procedures in the lower lumbar 2 times and for the placement of a trial stimulator in the spine. Example: last procedure: I can remember everything...even the conversation the doc and nurses were having about their plans to go to Disney for the holidays. The pain was excruciating!!! I cried and screamed out during the whole procedure and had a death grip on the bed trying not to jerk...they are dinking with my spine after all_ and was literally begging the doc to stop all while being told to be still! After the trial implant I can remember all of the pain_ had muscle spasms for 14 hrs straight but I don't remember the drive home. I have not had any benefit from this drug. The problems it has caused are terrible. I wasn't told there were any long term effects with the drug what so ever. I was told I would be awake and I would not have any memory of the procedures. WHAT A LOAD OF BULL!! Oh I was awake for sure and I remember every ounce of pain.  My primary care provider expressed concern about my ever having it again due to the problems with thinking and memory it has caused. I received the drug from the pain clinic that treats my chronic pain and fatigue. Sometimes I wonder why they would ever dispense versed like it is as benign as a tic tac when it's so very dangerous!,F,40,1  days?? unsure,12/11/2015Email,Versed

30, 1, Endoscopy,Amnesia. This drug is an AMNESTIC. Not a pain killer_ and not as similar to Valium or Ativan as they'd have you believe.,"Versed is given to patients so that they become compliant and later forget the procedure. It is often used so that doctors can cut corners on pain meds_ because patients will not remember the pain they were in. It is given sneakily_ with manipulation_ against patient orders and with UNINFORMED ""consent"". For anxiety_ they could give Valium_ and for the pain_ they could give adequate amounts of Fentanyl. It's horrific_ if you read up on it. Wiping the memories of patients after you've put them in pain is immoral and deplorable.",,,  1X D,11/10/2015Email,Versed
31, 1, endoscopy procedure,Memory loss is indeed an intended result but one patients are seldom told about.  They want you to think you were asleep or unconscious_ free from pain. Not always true.

Has these symptoms for about 1/2 hour.  Then slowly regained control.  Had my Personal Care Assistant there.  If did not have some one with me would have been so very scared.

39, 1, D&C,Totally passed out when I had informed the Anesthesiologist that I did NOT want to be asleep. Was given this with spinal block. I have no memory of the operation_ only remember waking (waking? was never supposed to be asleep!) in the recovery room with a HORRIBLE headache_ dizziness_ grogginess_ shivering_ etc. It took HOURS for this to lessen to the point where I could even lift my arms and legs!,3 days later and I am still sleeping like I have been drugged. I can hardly stay awake_ have confusion_ inability to think (or remember things_ sorry for my spelling mistakes!). Tinnitus is HORRIBLE. I had informed the staff that I had problems with ALL anesthesia_ but I guess they just didnt really give a ----. I wanted to stay awake_ and my wishes were not granted_ my 'side effects' are worse than the whole reason I was having the operation in the first place!NEVER will allow this to be given to me in the future_ I will die first.,F,49,  1X D,8/14/2015,Versed

44, 1, Anesthetic used for an EGD,"I sat up after receiving versed_ pulled the endoscope hose out. Climbed over the bed railing_ said a few choice words to the people around me_ got dressed and walked out followed by security. My husband was surprised as it had been about 10 minutes since they had taken me in for the procedure. I came to at home_ asked_ ""Why am I here?"" I only barely remember the movement of pulling out the endoscope tube. The doctor tried to blame me for the reaction to this drug and I felt that it was the doctors fault that the could have given me a mild sedative (such as Valium or similar) to calm me down. Obviously I will never let them use Versed again.",I would not recommend this drug to anyone who is having surgery.

47, 1, EGD/Hospitalization,"There needs to be a -150 rating for this drug.  Memory loss - days later and recurring_ not when administered. Half-days and such would just ""disappear"". Anxiety_ panic attacks_ nightmares. flashbacks_ recurrent PTSD.  Weird memory lapses_ as in looking straight at something and unable to come up with the word. Extreme anger and ""grudge"" reactions - the day after dose 3 I basically attacked a well-liked and well-known alternative practitioner for no reason at all and still haven't completely shaken it off.",I was hospitalized for six days and had 3 EGDs - month apart. Arriving at the hospital half-bled-out was not as traumatic as how the hospital staff behaved when they thought I wouldn't remember_ or the weird and completely unpredictable memory loss and lapses. The 6mg was given legitimately and with consent for the emergency EGD - but the staff kept slipping it to me as they were constantly told not to (and for no legitimate reason). I left the hospital in BAD shape. It happens that I have long-managed PTSD and wasn't surprised that it had flared up again_ considering_ only to resume putting it back in it's place with some really good help_ just to find whole new sets of problems directly created by the Versed and the incredibly evil behaviors that it spawns in the healthcare industry.  So much for trusting hospitals or anyone in them again ... even with really good help_ it's taken six months (with bi-weekly treatment or more_ since the last dose of Versed).  A really good acupuncturist with adrenaline disorder and addiction experience who's willing to work with you and lay down a grounding cognitive framework can REALLY help - but very hard to find and prohibitively expensive if you can't get it covered under a good long-term mental health benefit.,F,50,1  months6 mg IV 1X M,7/3/2015,Versed

51, 5, Colonoscopy,I had my second colonoscopy today. The doctor combined versed with demerol. I wish they had started the demerol sooner to help me relax but they didn't. I have a real high tolerance for this drug and nitrous oxide. The first colonoscopy 9 years ago I woke up twice_ but not this time. I was mildly conscious the entire procedure which only took 20 minutes. I asked the doctor to increase dosage and he did. I was very happy with the results although I wish he would have used propofol because of the euphoria effect. Having used versed and other conscious sedation drugs over the past few years_ I recommend versed without question but still like propofol and some of the other oral conscious sedation meds too!,,M,64,1  days 1X D,6/1/2015,Versed

53, 5, EGD,I have been given this twice. Once several years ago for a colonoscopy and today for an EGD. I was completely unaware of either procedure.,From reading comments it seems that how well it works depends on what they give you with it. I had versed initially and then propofol. My throat is a little sore and they use gas to kind of blow you up while they are looking around so I've had some gas pains. Other than that I was able to eat right away and actually not struggle to swallow since they stretched my esophagus.  It was well worth going through this procedure to be able to eat normally.,F,44,1  days,5/15/2015,Versed

I was told that the combination of versed and fentanyl would keep me out of pain_ partially sedate me_ and I would have no memory of it afterwards. Well_ they were wrong. It was extremely painful_ and I remember the whole_ excruciating ordeal. It was like I had nothing. My blood pressure went up_ and I had no trouble with respirations. I did not feel sleepy at all.

56, 3, colonoscopy/endoscopy,People react differently. All 4 of us (siblings) had this procedure. One can remember the whole thing and some pain but not bad_ one thinks it was awesome. Lol. and the other one thinks the endoscopy part was horrible. I had mine done yesterday and have chaotic memories of moving my legs in pain_ screaming_ gagging_ people talking to me. I think they gave me extra during because of this. Last thing I remember is yelping in pain during the colonoscopy part and then staring at the doctor looking at a screen and then a nurse putting a really warm blanket on me after and thinking it felt so good. It's not a drug where you feel like you have any control whatsoever. When I get my next one in 3 Years_ I'll take it again but this time_ I want enough that I remember nothing. It was pretty crazy. Felt wobbly after and don't remember calling my husband or talking to my mom on the phone. Definitely have someone waiting for you as soon as you're done because you can feel pretty confused. I felt like crying when I was dressed and left in the waiting room after and my husband wasn't there for 5 minutes to get me (Apparently that's the phone call I don't remember and I was pretty irritated with him...lol) I think I felt upset because it's a vulnerable feeling. They definetely don't give you a lot of recovery time and I think they should let you stay in a bed until someone comes to get you...being in a waiting room with people stating at me and feeling totally drugged did not feel good.,,F,35,1  days,4/30/2015,Versed

When a friend called to check on me at an agreed upon time_ I was gone (had no memory of her saying she would call)_ so she called my neighbors and the sheriff to start a search for me.  Apparently this happens in up to 40% of 60years+ patients who have Versed for major surgery (I am 64).  In 17% of the cases it lasts 3 months_ and occasionally it is permanent dementia.  I also threw up all night the first night following surgery_ but that was relatively minor.  I had_ however_ asked the anesthesiologist to give me an anti-nausea drug_ and to use the same anesthetic that had been used for the first knee.....I had NOT had Versed before and therefore should NOT have had it this time.,This anesthetic is DANGEROUS and should not be allowed_ especially when other options are available.

Hitting_ kicking_ screaming_ tried to get up from chair several times (though unable to actually keep his balance or walk).  Very aggressive.  On the way home I had to stop the car several times to strap him back into this car seat_ and if it weren't for the child proof locks he would have opened the door and exited the car while it was moving!  I was not fully informed of these possible side effects_ as well as others (such as long term memory loss)_ and if I had known I never would have subjected my son to this.,M,5,1  days13 mg 1X D,12/9/2013Email,Versed

109, 1, Colonoscopy,,VERSED was administered to me before a colonoscopy. Just something to relax you_ they said. When the procedure was over_ I learned the name of it and realized that it had put me in a state where the doctor could talk to me and get my cooperation_ yet_ when I came to_ I didn't remember the pain or the fact that my mind had been manipulated. In the recovery room_ everything was spinning. Several times_ the nurse asked how I was feeling. Each time_ I asked for something to counteract the nausea. Each time_ she said_ Well just wait a little while and see how you feel. I finally told my husband to get me out of there. The ride home should have taken 45 minutes; it took 3 hours because I couldnt stand the movement of the car. That was back in 2009_ and I am still feeling the effects of the VERSED--not nausea_ but loss of memory. I am a writer_ and I find that simple words and phrases that I had always used are lost to me at times. There have been other little incidents_ too_ but nothing as drastic as Alzheimer's - yet. They say that memory loss caused by these drugs is only temporary_ but do they ever check to really find out? Is it possible that many elderly people who have medical procedures with the use of VERSED become victims of Alzheimers? I expect to see a class action suit against the manufacturer of VERSED and doctors who use it without warnings.,F,,  1X D,11/20/2013EmailHistory,Versed
110, 2, For a Colonoscopy,I had had Versed many times before for endoscopies and pre-surgical sedation.  My own father_ an anesthesiologist_ even gave it to me once before surgery while his partner was readying the OR.  I never had a problem with it_ and found it to work well as light sedation.  I could speak if necessary during a colonoscopy_ but was really mostly out of it.,THEN_ about 15 years ago_ during a routine endoscopy_ the anesthesiologist began slowly administering the drug_ while I remained conscious_ and very calm...the drug was working.  Unfortunately_ my O2 sats began to drop like crazy.  The GI Doc and the Anesthesiologist went berserk and started screaming at each other. LOL  The nurse found the syringe of Flumazenil_ the antagonist to Versed_ and injected it into my IV before I passed out from hypoxia.  Now I have LOTS of Ativan and Dilaudid and Phenergan for light sedation_ (which actually turns out to be much heavier sedation)_ and Ativan for pre-op sedation.  I will only use ONE particular anesthesiologist...they LOVE being requested by the way...and he knows all about my drug allergies_ etc.  I had a VERY atypical reaction to this drug. It has been used very safely for years.  If you have any kind of bad reaction when receiving Versed_ just tell the hospital you are allergic to it and broke out in hives at your IV site the last time you had Versed.  They will NEVER give it to you again as they would be liable for a lawsuit.  Just make sure you write Versed as a drug allergy whenever you go to ANY physician_ and list hives as the reaction.,F,,  1X D,11/12/2013,Versed

After someone drove me home I slept for maybe an hour and that was it! No ill side effects whatsoever!! I can understand why folks who are prone to anxiety might be nervous about ""losing"" 15 or so minutes (at least that's how long my procedure was) but for me_ it was no big deal.

The first time no one had any idea I would have this terrible reaction but the second time I met with my anesthesiologist and told him specifically not to give me Versed and I explained why.  He gave it to me anyway and when I filed a complaint with the state medical board it took them a year to determine the doctor had done nothing wrong.  I have suffered ever since with concentration and memory issues.  My husband has noticed a marked difference in my ability to find words during the course of normal conversation.

113, 1, Given pre-surgery,"I never made it to surgery.  Immediately began dry heaving violently.  Felt like something exploded in my head.  I could not go into surgery_ because the dry-heaving continued for hours.  I did however receive bills from the hospital_ the doctor_ and the anesthesiologist.  I had told all of them and the nurse that I react violently to the amnesia drugs.  They did not tell me what they were going to give me.  I got the usual ""something to relax you"".  NOT!  Not only did have the opposite of relaxation_ but I was unable to go to sleep until after 4am the next morning_ and then I woke up after about 2 hours from a nightmare.  I was never prone to nightmares.  The disrupted sleep continued for weeks gradually letting me sleep a bit longer each night_ but having multiple nightmares every night.  It has been more than a year now_ and I am still having nightmares more frequently than ever before.  In addition_ I have developed what feels like mild altzheimers.  I have difficulty focusing",They told me the amnesia drugs help me to not remember the surgical procedure so I don't get traumatized.  I have had about 19 surgical procedures no counting colonoscopies dating back into the 50s.  I have never been afraid of surgery or needles_ and have elected to have local anesthesia whenever possible_ so I don't traumatize that easily.  However_ I still need the surgery I never got_ but I am terrified to have it_ because the medical professionals do not take you seriously_ even when they interview you 4-6 times before the surgery and you tell them every time that YES you have had problems previously_ and please don't give me the new amnesia drugs.  I did not know what they were giving me until a nurse sneaked into my room after_ while I continued to dry-heave and wrote it on a business card.  The doctor and anesthesiologist never came in to check on me.  I was discharged and billed.  And I am still suffering from the after effects.,F,62,  1X D,10/3/2013Email,Versed

I did not remember any of this being discussed with me post-procedure but will be addressing this issue at my follow up appointment. My GI doc knew I had to receive extra meds during my procedures several years ago but this was a different doc.

We agreed that it was most important to finish the procedure and not have to go through all the prep again.  After discussing it_ I left it up to the doctor to choose what meds to administer_ if I decided I needed them_ in order to minimize side effects. The Doc explained that there might be a higher risk of side effects (such as nausea) in using Fentanyl alone_ rather than paired up with Versed_ because it might require a higher dose of the narcotic.I think it was great that the Doctor spent the time to talk with me to understand my concerns about the meds beforehand and to come to an agreement that completing the procedure was the most important thing.,M,49,1  days 1X AN,7/24/2013,Versed

I asked to speak with my doctor and my nurse said she would get him. As soon as she left my pod area_ a CRNA came over to me and said he was going to give me something to relax me. I told him that I didn't want to be given any medication since I had not signed the surgical consent and since I was waiting to speak with my doctor. As I was protesting being given the medication (Versed)_ the CRNA injected my IV. That was my last waking memory. When I woke up two hours later_ I was told by a nurse I didn't recognize that a total hysterectomy had been performed on me. All of my healthy sex organs were taken without my consent! I was 'castrated'. Versed was not a part of my pre-anesthesia plan. My doctor ordered Versed when he arrived at the hospital. (I can guess why...). He noted in my record that he ordered it for 'anxiety'. However_ my nurse noted in my record that my mood was 'calm'. I believe it's crystal clear why I was given Versed. I am disabled now due to the many consequences of Versed and surgery I did not consent to. see my site at www.hysterectomyconsequences.com,F,51, IV 1X D,11/1/2012EmailHistory,Versed

189, 5, Was having a closed MRI,I had to have an MRI of the brain_ ears_ and cervical spine so I was given Versed due to the length of time I would be in the closed MRI. Was given 1 mg at a time and received a total dose of only 4 mg which totally relaxed me.  I went in for MRI at 915 and came out at 1130_ having had the final dose at 1030 am. At 1130 am my vitals were good and I was home by 1230 pm.  I feel good_ not loopy or forgetful or weird. This medicine helped me to relax in a very confined space.,I would say whenever you are going to be given Versed you should do your research and read up on it and ask questions about any medicine you are going to receive before the day of the procedure and use as little as you need. It takes a few minutes after you get Versed in an IV so its best not to assume you need more until you give it a few minutes to take effect and see how it works before asking for more. A little dab goes a long way.,F,52,1  days4 mg 1X D,1/9/2012,Versed
190, 1, i took it for lower back injury.,I take it for my epidural injections. I have an excellent back Dr. But.... This drug was on backorder in IV form. So they gave it to me orally. 6 days later I'm still having a severe allergic reaction. Yes_ the steroid can take up to 10 days to take effect and mine is way worse for those days but then I'm out of pain (mostly) for 6 weeks. I don't know_ my guts telling me there has to be a better way. Steroids don't heal anything_ and I can get really weird. Pain killers just mask the issue and coming off those is enough to make you want To be dead. Maybe modern medicine is not as modern as we want it to be. Yet the pain is life altering.

197, 4, colonoscopy,"Drowsiness_ spinning sensation in my head_ slurred speech. First colonoscopy was done at a hospital and for whatever reason I was completely alert during the procedure_ on 6 mg of versed and 50mcg of fentanyl. Extremely painful. Second procedure was done a year later at an endoscopy clinic_ monitored by two nurses_ a tech and done by two doctors who both actually teach at the medical school. Went in with a migraine on procedure day so docs gave me 2x the dose of fentanyl and 7mg of versed and thankfully I remember nothing AND had no ""migraine hangover"" when I woke up like I normally do. I am having some diziness a few days later but could be getting an ear infection so not sure if it's the versed. Honestly anyone who has any procedure done needs to ask a million questions and not have the procedure until the doctor answers every one. You can't blame the doctor for every lack in information if you didn't bother to let them know you had questions and concerns. Obvious exception for those who were given the drug without consent and those who had legitimate allergic reactions or rare side effects.

I finally ""fell asleep"" briefly while the doc was placing the lens and when I woke up_ the surgical team had me all dressed and cozy in a warm blanket and were beaming at me as though we had all just had a wonderful time.

I could still feel oral doses_ but they didn't make me tired enough to fall asleep_ which was why I was taking it.I liked Versed a lot_ but over time I got a tolerance_ and refused to keep upping the dosage_ and just tapered off.Again_ be careful taking this drug - NEVER drive or operate heavy machinery_ or do dangerous things like climbing ladders on this medication.  And please DO NOT ""stay up through the 'high'"" because you'll just end up taking more_ and more_ then before you realize it_ you've taken 75mg through the course of a night (speaking of recreational benzo users_ not myself) .

201, 1, Wisdom teeth removal,Permanent short term memory loss,I was in my early 30's and had Versed when I had my wisdom teeth removed by an Oral Surgeon.  I was completely asleep.  When I awoke_ I started asking the same questions over and over which was to be expected with this type of drug before it was out of your system.  The problem was_ once it was out of my system_ my memory was never the same again.  I have told doctors I will never allow it to be used on me again_  You'd think by now they would have come up with something better but even new dentists with extensive training in anesthesiology still do not use newer protocols - most continue to use Versed_ Brevital and Valium - all old drugs!  I love Propofol but know it is normally only used on intubated patients inside a hospital setting.  Propofol is best because it is short acting_ and it has no memory side effects that I have ever experienced.  It's just like having a really good deep sleep and when you wake up you feel great.  Some dentists do use it_ but I am not sure of the rest of the protocols they use with it.  Anyway_ don't believe anyone that says Versed doesn't cause permanent memory loss (problems with short term memory) because it DOES.

I was given some other stuff too and I think I slept through most of it.To those who had a bad experience with the medication during the colonoscopies_ I've had a colonoscopy without any sedation at all and they do hurt...alot. This is primarily because the scope and the air they pump in to you causes the colon to cramp and spasm. Doctors will frequently continue the procedure with the patient screaming because it's generally a short procedure and it's easier to get it done with than to pull the scope out and try again with some other drug combination some other time_ when the patient might not actually remember the pain when the procedure is over.,F,31,1  days6mg 1X O,9/28/2011,Versed

I also received Fentanyl w/ the Versed_ so its hard to say which med caused what. I'm concerned b/c I feel like I'm in a fog the day after and my vision is blurry. Even my regular reading glasses are not strong enough. Feel like I can just sleep all day. I'm working tomorrow and I'm starting to feel that I won't be able to be mentally clear to return to work. I'm in the healthcare field and mental fog is obviously not a safe thing! I know my doc said that they had to give me alot more Fentanyl than what is normally given...like I had an intolerance to it....don't get it and not sure why I would have an intolerance to this narcotic since I don't take narcotics.,I've given patients Versed many many times_ but intramuscularly.

We'll just give you a little bit.  I ended up having to have another endoscopy the next day!  They gave it to me again despite my protests!  Due to this I do not take and hopefully will not take any medications.  I had my colonoscopy without anything.  It was fine_ I watched the whole procedure!  I went for 16 extremely frustrating months with very limited short term memory.  Do you know what that is like?  You are so frustrated because you spend so much time looking for things that you can't remember what you did with!  It was like there was a fog_ like my brain just couldn't work properly_ it felt like there was a cap on my head all the time.  Finally I tried acupuncture again and I was blessed with a rebirth!

No_ I did not have any ""psychological issues"" before being given this drug. To the person who doesn't understand all the ""hype"" about Versed_ you are lucky you had a good experience (Yes_ I DO believe some people do !); but Versed has been the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I was near-suicidal 3 days following my procedure (I actually had an open bottle of pills in my hand one night)_ and I am deeply offended that anyone should think that my posted experience was a ""gross exaggeration."" I also trusted my doctor ""explicitly_"" and I feel he betrayed my trust.

It gets administered then I sleep and I wake up after the proceedure is over.  I was made aware of all the side effects including the memory loss before I signed consent_ and I never woke up in the middle of a proceedure.  The doc told me ahead of time what he would be using.  I can understand many people having many different reactions to a medicine.  Some that I've read sound horrific.  In many cases it sounds like you need a new doctor who will listen to your wishes and inform you better about what he or she is doing and/or a better anesthesiologist who can get the titration correct so you aren't waking up in the middle of the proceedure-how terrible!  I also don't doubt that the med itself caused bad reactions_ and I'm very sorry.

I told both the doctor and nurse that I was unable to take Versed as it does not sedate me_ but makes me anxious.  They became angry_ but did find an anthesiologist to administer general anthesia.

I felt looped for the next 48 hours and had to be seen for vertigo on day four.,Despite my request to not be given this medication I was over ridden by the young anesthesiologist nurse as it was part of their protocol at a major teaching hospital in Seattle.

Glad we listened.,My two year old daughter was scheduled to get tubes in her ears and a friend recommended we did not use Versed.  Her daughter has had tubes in her ears a few times (due to mild deformities) and after her first trip using Versed she came out screaming_ crying and sick to her stomach.  My girlfriend asked why this was and the dr. attributed it to Versed- an OPTIONAL drug.              My experience:  I spoke with the doctor in the pre-op appointment about the drug and she said it was not normally given to children that young and said it was optional.  On the day of the procedure the anesthesiologist came in and I informed him we would like to not use Versed.  He became annoyed and started bullying me into getting it.  I asked my husband to take my daughter out of the room and I clearly explained to him my concerns_ the steps I took researching this and our decision.  His reply was that he was the medical professional and if I didn't give it to my daughter she would have nightmares because of the procedure and would cry because of separation anxiety.  I stood firm- reminding him that it was optional and I was opting out.  I also insisted that I walk with them the 20 feet from her bed to the door which he found profoundly irrational (from a parent's perspective- this is not irrational).  My daughter walked in_ did not cry when separating from us and woke up fine.

I had already convinced my self that I was going to refuse Versed.  However_ when I spoke with my physician (whom I trust explicitly)_ he assured me that I would not experience any problems.

In addition attempts were made by hospital staff to get my consent for an expensive and life threatening procedure......open heart surgery just happens to be highly profitable for hospitals.  Although I appeared to be coherent I was in a terrified partially drugged state during most of my hospital stay and certainly in no condition to make any informed decision about my care.  I experienced side effects that were clearly mental health issues but the hospital had no consultant on staff for psychiatric conditions. Why are they allowed to administer drugs they know so little about?  I am having a terrible struggle with intrusive fears and thoughts EVERY SINGLE NIGHT when I try to go to sleep.  It is more than 6 months now since I was given this drug.  I have a heart condition but am now afraid to trust any kind of medical personnel.

I actually remember most of the procedure_ however_ I do not have an exact recollection of the length of time_ in the sense of whether it was 30 minutes or 3 hours.

I remember my husband and I making my follow up appointment_ riding home_ and also walking into my house. Everyone on this page absolutely scared me into refusing Versed so I ignorantly did!! I was doubly nervous because I am a pilot and feared the worst (ie: memory loss of how to fly!) from the horrible stories that now seem to be gross exaggerations. I started the procedure (the most painful part/incisions and local anesthetic insertion!) without it; eventually I was becoming a little squirmy since the procedure did in face hurt! He asked me once again if I wanted the Versed and I told the doctor that I would not question his judgment and if he told me Versed was safe_ I would trust him since he is the professional(I mean_ he wouldn't get in the back of my aircraft and tell me how to fly!?!)In the end_ no need to be scared,F,29,1  timesunk 1X AN,11/27/2010,Versed

I was instructed not to drive_ work_ make important decisions_ so it was no secret that when one is sedated for a surgical procedure_ these things should simply not be done. Any MD or RN is required to inform you of these things prior to and after the surgery. I came home_ took a nap and felt fine afterward.  I had a colonoscopy once before and other surgeries requiring conscious sedation and never have had any untoward effects.

327, 2, Colonoscopy,Terrible headache for the rest of the day of the procedure.   Bloated feeling for the next 3 days but that could have been due to the procedure itself or the Moviprep.   Off/on nausea with slight feeling of disorientation the following 3days.  I'm on my 4th day and so far so good.  As it is now Monday_ I think work is helping to keep things off my mind.,Just prior to the administration of the drug_ I told the attending assistant to give me as little as possible as I was able to go through a colonoscopy without any medication 5yrs ago.   I told my Dr. this during the consultation session but he was adamant about the meds as to not interupt the procedure should the pain become unbearable.   Not sure how much I was actually given along with the Fentanyl.  I stayed awake and alert the whole time through and felt fine right after the procedure.  I do remember the procedure quite well so amnesia is not what I've experienced.  I had a Jamba juice and oatmeal right after since I felt so hungry and dehydrated.   I got home and fell asleep for 2hrs and then woke up with a migraine like headache and proceeded to vomit everything I ate and drank.  I tried to drink as much water throughout the day to stay hydrated because I had no appetite to eat.  I had very little dinner that night.  The headache was immense and lasted until I went to bed around 10pm.  I didn't take any Tylenol or Advil as my stomache was completely empty.  I woke up feeling fine the next day but started to get the side affects mentioned above.   Next time I will avoid the meds and go at it naturally as I've been through it before and while slightly painful_ would much rather be feeling all-together in mind_ body_ and spirit instead of dealing with the side affects.

It was like the drug FORCED me to become unstable. I do not drink or use drugs_ maybe it only works on experienced ""users"".",I had a broken wrist when I was 7.

I am one of the most anxious people I know when it comes to drugs.  I hate procedures and get myself in a right state.  But_ I can honestly say_ I've not had problems with Versed.  Yes_ you lose most of your memory for an hour or so with it and should be told this in advance.  I woke up at the end of my colonoscopy and remember the awful pain of them pulling out the tube_ to the point I was swearing and gripping the bed_ but I only had a few minutes of this and then I drifted off again.  I would rather a few minutes than an hour!  What needs to be remembered is it effects everyone differently and you don't know until you try it.  I always feel a bit low the third day after it but I suffer with depression and it certainly doesn't knock me into such a low state that I would not have it.

VERSED and a LIE.",I'd already told nurse to remove my IV but she said she needed to get the surgeon. Nurse had noted I was not wanting to go through with the surgery. Surgeon came in & said I was having a negative reaction from the antacid they gave me that creates irrational anxiety reaction in some_ & he wanted to stop the reaction first so I wasn't canceling due to it. He was going to give me something that would stop the reaction_ and calm me & when he returned in 10 MIN if I still didn't want op_ they weren't going to make me do anything I didn't want to do. I wanted to leave then but felt obligated for inconveniencing them_ felt I needed to let him see it wasn't the reaction that was causing the cancel. My last thought was_ I'm headed home in 10 min's. Nothing would change my mind. Last memory was asking the nurse if she was giving me valium_ because I didn't want to fall asleep since I was going home.  She said not Valium but it would relax me. Turns out_ I was completely awake_ talking_ happy_ and when the doctor returned_ he must have said the right things to fool my family because they thought I was there & knew what I was saying and doing & happy to have the surgery there was no way I was having.

They then proceeded to tell us it was our fault for having 3 people in there and he was stimulated to agitation.. They nurses were unreal and I will do what I can to change their policy.

This drug was never explained to me prior to procedure_ by the doctor_ nurses_ receptionist_etc._ or even on the form they mailed me in advance. Why is that ? Because it causes many patients to freak out_ actually CAUSES anxiey in some of us_ and they just hope we don't remember the intense pain we experience...but that is for their benefit_ not ours. I was TRAUMATIZED by it's use (unlike the hospital secretary)_ and will never trust a medical person again.

It was used in my case as I would have been traumatized by the pain of re-setting my dislocated knee_ along with the pain of my seriously fractured ankle. I was grateful for it.

When the hospital called for post op check up they asked how I was and then how was the anesthesia.  The doctor called several days latter to see how I was. I thought this strange.

Went ahead with the procedure. Versed and fentynal administered through IV_ positioned on left side and 30 seconds later i was out. Woke up in recovery and would do it again. Drug worked fine for me.But I don't believe that any drug works fine for everybody.

I have sensitivies to them as a result. That said_ for short term surgery IV-Versed did what it needed to and I completely recoverd after a few weeks of experiencing paradoxical side effects after surgery. The panic attacks were bad_ but I learned to manage these until they disipated. One approach to take in order to minimize the after effects is to ask the doctor to start with a pediatric dose and then work his way up as opposed to having him guess how much you need at start. This is what I did and I feel I avoided a worse experience - I took only the minimum of what was needed.

We both agreed that all of us are different and that the effects of any drug could be different for each individual.

368, 1, colonoscopy,post-procedural insomnia_ anxiety_ frustration with partial memory of the procedure,Like several others_ I wish I had read this blog before my procedure.  I was not anxious about it and knew full well what it entailed (or so I thought).  Looking back_ Im very disappointed by the lack of direct communication _ especially about the nature of the sedation  i.e._ Versed  and its effect(s).  When they gave me the injection (IV)_ I was out a good bit_ but I distinctly remember several things during the procedure. Those memories were and are very clear.  Here is the substance of my (personal) complaint with versed_ or any other drug of its kind.  Had they explained the (even 'potential') effect of PARTIAL-amnesia_ I would have requested the pain med only or neither_ if they allowed it.  I wish I could have watched the whole thing on the TV...it was quite fascinating.  The real problems (for me) started a day or two later (see side effects).  It's been a month now_ and my wife and friends have noticed the effects and ask me whats wrong.  Almost nightly_ my mind wrestles with trying to piece together the missing parts of that approximately 45-minute time span.  I've never experienced anything like this in 57 years of life.  It's quite disturbing.  I wont let it keep me from future colonoscopies_ but I will definitely  refuse Versed and explore the alternatives with my doctor(s) beforehand.  I hope my reaction to the drug goes away soon...it sucks.  Thanks to those of you that have posted honest comments...I've tried to be as candid,M,57,1  times5mg 1X D,6/2/2010Email,Versed
369, 5, Colonoscopy,I felt fine.  The nurse who attended me and administered the Versed into my IV was about 40 years old and was extremely hot.  I was flirting with her and thought I was doing well.  But as the medication began to take effect_ she told me that she was married.  That was the last thing that I remember.   I have no recollection of the doctor inserting the scope into my azzzz although I did become aware of some discomfort toward the end of the procedure as the doctor pulled the scope out of my azzzz.,The colonoscopy procedure involves the introduction of air into the colon to expand it and allow the Dr. to maneuver the endoscope.  In recovery_ the nurse told me lay on my side so that I could comfortably fart the excess gas out of my colon.  Versed has an amnesiac component that allowed me to fart and not even care if anybody could hear me.  Versed is very useful for this purpose.,M,56, IDK 1X D,6/1/2010Email,Versed

I had no immediate reactions to the medication_ however now I cannot remember much of anything prior to when I first started receiving the medication.  I was told it would have an amnesia effect that I wouldn't remember the pain or any of the problems I was going through at the time_ but no one told me or my family that it could possibly make me forget most of my life before that.  I also am not the same person I was before I was given versed.  I was never shy_ quiet or a timid person_ I am now.  I would just warn anyone to please research any medication that anyone wants you to take.  I wish I could rewind time and refuse that medication.  I will not ever use it on me again.

I remember everything until my anaesthsia was induced and did not have the nausea and vertigo that I would typically experience during induction with the same drugs.

Did not make me forget anything during my cystoscopy (basically a tiny camera going up your urinary tract).  I talked to the nurse during the procedure and she told me I was not going to remember the conversation and I said I would_  that the procedure was uncomfortable_ and I WAS RIGHT!!

The strongest effects did not last longer than 24hours but I did have paranoia for days after.,I still have nightmares to this day and think about it regularly even though it was almost eight years ago.

The next day I felt a little sick and dizzy_ which I attribute to being too deydrated and not eating after I vomited.,I am an RN_ but I was afraid just like anybody.  I was initially given 2 mg versed and 50 mcg fenanyl.  I was then given four additional doses of 1 mg versed and 25 mcg fentanyl throughout the procedure.  I was awake and talking during the procedure_ I watched the whole thing on the monitor.   At one point they wanted to reposition me_ and this part was somewhat painful and crampy_ like bad menstrual cramps_ but that stopped quickly_ either by passing the scope or the addition of more medication_ I'm not sure which.  All in all_ it was a painless procedure_ the meds worked perfectly_ and I was awake and ready to leave as soon as they took out the IV.  The bowel prep is BY FAR the worst thing about the colonoscopy.  I'd do it again without hesitation.

380, 5, Needle extract. of sperm via testes,Amnesia,"I can appreciate some of the negative comments made by others but I think Versed is an excellent drug for unique situations. It was used in combination with Morphine to get a procedure to extract my sperm through my testicles following a vasectomy. The treatment team later told me that I had ""significant difficulties"" with the procedure (I can imagine!) But the amnesia spared me any trauma by preventing me from remembering it.  This is a great drug if you have an anxiety disorder or phobia about surgery_ etc._ and/or if you are getting a procedure done without the benefit of general anesthesia. This allows you to repeat painful procedures without developing post-traumatic stress.  I just had my tonsils out today and was prepped with Versed prior to going into the operating room. What happened before they put me out could have been uncomfortable_ scary_ etc. Versed prevented me from recalling any of it and not adding to any fears about surgery. As a final note - (although this may be an urban myth) - there is a story that Versed was used by an EMT worker at the Twin Towers on 9/11 prior to amputating the limb of a victim because she was trapped and there was no way they could have given her general anesthesia in that situation.

In other words_ nothing is wrong with the drug -- only with people who criticize it.

One minute I was telling the nurse I couldn't feel the medicine and the next minute I'm waking up in the recovery room. I remember absolutely nothing about both procedures. I even questioned if they even touched me. The only trippy thing about this drug is that I kept asking the same questions over and over not having any memory of doing so. I also talked to/called people and have no memory of doing that either. I was really tired for the rest of the day so I slept.

While I am grateful that I had an honest_ caring doctor who told me the truth_ it is disconcerting to think that there are doctors out there who probably would have continued the procedure anyway_ smug in the fact that the patient would't remember it.

414, 1, colonoscomy,memory loss_ reliving the pain,Versed did nothing but try to mask the pain! It was a horrible experience!  I woke up 3 times during the procedure screaming and holding my abdomen.  I felt like the probe was coming out of my abdomen. I remember the nurse telling me to relax_ and calm down.  I believe they just uped the dose of versed to put me under and mask the pain.  The pain was unbareable. When I did wake up I don't remember anything except the pain_ and just getting dressed.  My wife is a bone marrow transplant nurse and said they usually give about 2 to 3 mgs of versed to patients_ me being 140 lbs was given 8 mgs_ which really alarmed her. I am sure I was given it to shut me up.  I was stuck in the hand for an iv that did not take_ but 3 nurses said that they could work with it. After the procedure_ I had tape on my right arm and 3 stick marks_ and tape on my left arm.  I have repeated myself over and over with conversations with my wife_ that I don't recall ever talking about. I have nightmares of the procedure_ and can relive it over and over again just thinking about it.  I am in excellent health_ run 10ks on a regular basis_ work out everyday_ never take drugs_ and am a health_ protein_ and vitamin finatic. I would not recommend this drug to anyone.

Within 2 days I was suffering flashbacks and nightmares and did not eat or sleep more than an hour or two a night for 6 nights before I finally slept 7 hours. For two months I have suffered from periodic anxiety and panic attacks. I was so relieved to find information on the Internet that others had suffered the same effects I had and that I was not alone. This side effect seems to be fairly common though not the experience most people have. At the very least_ this drug should be discussed with the patient and the possible side effects reviewed before the drug is given. It seems most patients who have a negative reaction to the drug were given the drug without any information as to what the drug would do and how it would affect the patient. Specific permission for this drug should be obtained from the patient before it is arbitrarily given to the patient. I will never be given this drug again.,F,57,1  times,12/30/2009,Versed

First subacromial decompression two years ago I remember getting the Versed IV to calm me_ then having the nerve conduction tests on the arm muscles and laughing about it with the anesthesiologist_ and being rolled into the OR where I joked with the techs before saying goodbye as the general anesthesia did its thing; then I woke up in recovery.  Last week (other arm) the Versed was started_ the nerve conduction testing was begun in preop_ and that's all I remember until I woke up in Recovery.  No joking with the anesthesiologist or techs or anything.  Oh well.  Surgeon said it all had to do with how much Versed is given and when.  I guess this time I got more_ and/or sooner.  I understand the frustration and fear of those who can't use it but insisting that it be taken off the market isn't the answer; it may be the only thing that works for some people.  I absolutely can't take codeine or codeine derivatives_ but I know it works for a lot of people so I just know to make sure my providers know not to give me that any more.,F,48,2  times,12/29/2009,Versed

God bless that nurse. I remember the doctor prepping me_ and then it was like I dozed off. The next thing I remember the nurse was saying they were all done. I had to have one reinserted a few days later because my right lung deflated_ and since I had just eaten breakfast I had the Fentanyl with no Versed. It hurt extremely bad even with the painkiller.

The dentist was floored.  On the first day of surgery I received 32 mg. of Versed and remained completely cognizant of what was happening to me.  The dentist was not prepared for this at all which was alarming to me because she was working on my teeth and I am frightened of dental work.  She could not give me more Versed for fear of shutting down my CNS_ but not having a ""back up plan"" put me in a very anxious state in the dental chair.  Time was a bit distorted (6 hours felt like 4_ maybe?  3?) but I remember all of the conversation and I remember becoming anxious when I felt pain_ and I retain memories of difficult extractions.  Yuck.  Day 2 went a little better because the dentist prescribed Valium for me to take the morning of the second surgery.  This helped improve the effectiveness of the Versed_ although it still wasn't good.  Ironically_ when the Versed didn't work_ I remembered that this was actually my second failed experience with Versed.  The first happened during a spinal tap for meningitis.

Then I saw stone statues of The Virgin Mother Mary flying in the air coming to me from the hospital doorway. There were waterfalls in the doorway. I saw a tiny midget version of the fat Elvis Presley singing the blues into a microphone next to my hospital bed. It was by far THE WEIRDEST AND COOLEST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. Again I was 11 years old when this happened to me. They gave me this crazy drug thinking that it would sedate me_ i guess_ while they removed a cast that was on my broken hand.,I'm sure this drug doesn't effect everyone the same way by any means whatsoever.

From what I've read_ most people gets about 4mg of Versed_ with a few at 5mg and a few at 3mg.I remember a few painful bits in beginning of the procedure -- no big deal_ and then next thing I remember was the nurse telling me ""We're done."" and everyone was cleaning up.I remember everything again starting at that point. No amnesia for rest of the day or anything like that. I'm sure that about 10% of the patients do have severe issues and that most others probably has some amnesia for some hours afterwards_ but none for me to report.For me_ the worst part was the prep the day before. That also left me dehydrated so I was feeling strong nausea by time of the procedure. Second worst part was the anxiety as this was the first time. In the future_ don't think I'll have the anxiety_ though I'll probably not enjoy much the prep. But if I do this again and experience strong nausea_ I'd probably push hard to have an anti-emetic injected via IV such as Phenergan (which the place had lots of according to medicine cabinet labels) while waiting.I only wish they had administered a little more of the Versed first so that I wouldn't have remembered any of it_ but considering the nasty side effects of Versed_ I'm OK with having just a bit too little than vice versa.",M,35,1  days,11/1/2009,Versed

I asked about having Valium for anxiety in addition to the Fentanyl and the doctor said Valium was in the same class as Versed_ but not an amnesiac. We decided to skip the Valium but have it available. I did not come close to ever feeling like I needed the Valium. The procedures went fine. It helped to have the nurse rub my abdomen during the difficult parts of the colonoscopy and hold my hand during the endoscopy. (I suggest people ask in advance for this physical and emotional support in case their staff is not tuned in to how this touching/rubbing helps.) I felt like I swallowed/gagged about six times during the endoscopy_ but the doctor called them burps and said try not to burp_ and then after about three he said now you can burp. It was no more difficult than some dental work I've had done. I kept thanking them for letting me have the procedures with Fentanyl only. They kept saying I was doing great.

It was_ overall_ a very traumatic experience for the whole family.,The ENT performing the surgery then came in and told us that he was having an adverse reaction to the drug and instructed me to inform his primary pediatrician of this reaction and to ensure that this was never given to him again.

I remember absolutely nothing of the procedure_ and woke up in the recovery room fairly alert.  Actually - I was delighted and amazed at how easy the entire procedure was.  The only complaint I might have is that IF they used Versed on me_ I would like to have been informed of its possible side effects.  And honestly_ it's a little disconcerting to think that I may have been awake and able to talk during the procedure and not be able to remember a thing about it.  Think about it:  2 nurses and a doctor in a closed room with a drugged patient who won't remember the procedure.  It's the 578th procedure they've done and it's beyond routine.

Four people had to hold her down to put in catheter.  6-8 hours after still hallucinating_ unable to sleep_ difficult to calm down_ anxious_ agitated_ angry and scared.  12 hours later- still moody_ confused_ but able to answer questions.   Even 36 hours later - dizzy_ manic episodes (crying uncontrollably)_ hostile_ bossing people around_ confused_ anxious.   It was horrible to watch and very concerning!,First 12 hours_ Drs. kept saying it was normal & she was fine.  Upond being discharged fromt the hospital_ we realized that she was far from normal.  All Drs we consulted with in Pediatrics and ER said there was no way that the sedatives were still in her system 36 hours later.  Yet she was still exhibiting scary mood altering behaviors.  They put her through a spinal tap & CT scan to rule out other issues and all came back negative (she successfully received propofol for those procedures).  Drs. then realized she had a paradoxical (or adverse) reaction to the Versed and should have NEVER have been given the additional dose of Ativan.  Supposedly there is something to reverse the adverse reaction_ but by the time the pediatric dr. reserached it_ it was too late to give.  We were at a well known children's hospital & they said they have never seen such a reaction.  By 48 hours the symptoms seem to have disappeared_ but am hoping we don't see any long term effects.

The room spun again and they were putting the bandage on my arm.  The nurse was asking me personal questions about my love life and I was blabbing about my new girlfriend and our sex life.  I couldn't stop talking.  I was humiliated and mad as hell.  I practically ran out of the hospital.  Later on when my head cleared I found bruises all over my body like I had been in a bar room brawl.  My girlfriend came on here and found out what the drug really is.  This drug should be illegal and I am looking for a lawyer.,M,35,1  times,6/3/2009,Versed

499, 5, Colonoscopy,Grogginess_ sleepiness_ loss of memory (short term).,I read about Versed literally for years before I had a colonoscopy_ and many of the comments people made scared me to the point that I postponed a colonoscopy for years. PLEASE take my word for it - it's not bad at all. I would absolutely take it again. One thing I was worried about was making a fool of myself or becoming violent (some others have reported this). Instead I informed the doctor that I was planning on sleeping through the procedure_ and that's exactly what I did. You won't do or say anything you'd regret after taking it (but you might ask the same question 4 times). I started with 2mg IM versed with 75mg IM demerol_ and I believe they added another 1-2mg versed via IV while I was in the endoscopy room. I didn't go crazy_ I didn't have any panic or fear - even though my heart rate was 110 before the procedure. The last thing I remember was being asked to roll over on my side before waking up in the recovery room. If you're reading these boards and the fear of Versed is keeping you from going through with a scope_ please take my word for it... just close your eyes and go to sleep. It's easier than getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.,M,25,1  days,6/1/2009,Versed

This time my wife told me I came into the den later that day totally *NAKED* while she had a girlfriend over. She tried to get me to go back to the bedroom but I was trying to start a conversation with them.

They administered the Versed (which the anesthesiologist completely explained beforehand) and I immediately began grinning from ear to ear and laughing.  It did everything it was supposed to do.

505, 1, EPS,agitation_ flashbacks_ panic_ uneasiness_ sense of dread,"While most people tolerate Versed well_ there is strong evidence that a subset of patients have adverse reactions. I had an absolutely awful experience with it in combination with Fentanyl_ so have tried to educate myself about it. Often the medical community has blamed patients for these reactions_ stating that the reaction was the result of a panicked patient_ or a patient with borderline mental illness. However_ there is now enough evidence to strongly suggest these reactions_ which are clearly very similar in nature despite the different procedures and different patients_ are a result of the drug. Luckily_ it does not occur often. Some contend that doctors like Versed as much as patients because it makes their work easier. The problem is that Versed can actually cause agitation during a procedure_ which makes things more difficult_ and it is an unreliable amnesiac so some people remember events_ or portions of events_ in a nightmarish fashion that can haunt them for days or weeks. It should be stressed that most people do well with this drug_ but if you have had a ""strange"" reaction_ do be reassured that it has happened to others and consider talking with your doctor if you need sedation for future procedures.",F,44,1  days,5/16/2009,Versed

I felt fine immediately afterwards when the torture stopped_ no grogginess_ got out of bed as soon as the nurse left the room and got dressed_ sat and read THE NEW YORKER magazine until she returned to escort me out.  I couldn't read anything serious after two glasses of wine but I felt like I'd had NO DRUGS at all_  my mind was clear.  Versed was useless on me_  despite the doctors insisting that I had the dosage for a 200 lb man and I am a 145 lb woman (5'9"" tall).  I do not use any kinds of drugs_ prescription or otherwise_ so its not like I had any tolerance towards the Versed.","I went home but felt no need for rest or a nap but felt restless and paced around the house.  The flashbacks started a few hours later_  intense memories of what went on during the colonoscopy.   I try not to think about it so much but I have this intense rage_ of how they would not give me additional meds when I asked for them and how everyone had assured me_ ""The prep is bad_ afterwards you won't remember a thing!""  I told both my regular Dr and the Dr who performed the procedure about this and they have insisted that all was normal and that in 10 years_ they will recommend that I get a CT virtual colonoscopy which is good as I will NEVER have another regular colonoscopy unless I get total sedation.  My Dr offered to send me to a counselor as she is concerned that I am developing PTSD over this.   I am in otherwise excellent health_ do spinning and weight lifting and lap swimming_ take no medications_ never taken an antidepressent_ an all around healthy woman. Reading these other posts concerns me_  I want these bad feelings to go away so I can be normal again.   I never thought I would say that until I was given Versed.

She then told me to remember to come back when everything was over :) My next memory is sitting up in the hospital bed talking with my husband.The down side to this drug_ at least for me_ is that for the first week_ I would repeat myself. I would start telling my hubby something...and it would sound vaguley familiar and I wouldn't know why_ and he would tell me that I'd already told him about it. That lasted for about a week_ I'm into my second post op week and although it still happens from time to time_ it's not nearly as bad......but in all honesty_ I'd rather not have ANY recollection about the surgery. I don't know that the Drs and nurses were being rude_ making comments about me or anything else for that matter while I was under the influence of Versed.

513, 5, Endoscopy,Wooziness_slight headache_ tiredness,"I was scared to have Versed after reading some of the reviews on here_ but then learned that it had been used on me in the past for foot surgery and two wisdom tooth extractions.  That made me feel more comfortable about using it again.  It worked just as the nurses said it would_ I remembered right up to the point when they administered the medicine_ and then hardly anything until waking up in recovery.  I did have what felt like a dream sequence (albeit it very briefly) where I was gagging on the tube as they put it down_ but even after ""waking up"" I had to think really hard to determine whether that had been real or a dream...and almost didn't remember it at all.  I still don't feel like that was anything other than a dream_ so I don't want anyone to think that it was a bad experience -- otherwise I would not have given a 5 rating.  And let me just qualify that rating by saying that I am a gagger and will do anything to not gag/puke.  So_ just going into to an endo where I knew gagging was inevitable was nerve-wracking enough for me.  It's been 5 hours since my procedure_ and while I am tired_ I feel just fine.  Oh_ and the results of the endo were ""normal.""  So_ at least now I know I'm in good health.

I'm sure there are procedures where it may be necessary and worth the risk but I have done a ton of research (during my many sleepless nights) and believe that colonoscopy is not one of them. Sedation is the standard of care in the U.S. but is not in many other countrys. This procedure may have moments of discomfort (cramping) but typically does not have pain. You can choose to have it done with just pain medication. Think carefully before accepting sedation for it.

535, 4, PreOp Anxiety,"No side effects.  Simply a calming effect prior to being wheeled into the operating room.  I don't feel as if this drug was ""pushed"" on me or that it was meant to completely wipe my memory clean.  It simply made the experience a lot less frightening.  And I feel that's the main goal of a good physician...to make the patient feel safe and secure prior to a procedure.  You do_ in fact come out of anesthesia the same way you go in.  Wouldn't you rather go in with a calm relaxed feeling?",To each his own...I have had this drug a number of times.  Side effects are no worse than general anesthesia itself.  A little sleepy and can't drive for a bit.,F,32,1  days,4/3/2009,Versed
536, 1, endoscopy,"The bottom line on midazolam (brand name: Versed) is this: Why screw around majorly with your brain chemistry_ especially when this drug is totally unnecessary? There are tons of other alternate drugs that can be used for sedation_ that have different mechanisms of action and do not produce the myriad serious side effects listed here. As regards the people below who say ""don't listen"" to anyone advising you to avoid midazolam -- such comments seem a little odd. If these were real patients_ exactly why would they care so much to say that? I mean_ when is the last time you_ as a patient_ went out of your way to post a comment on a Web site telling people TO TAKE a particular drug? A heavy sedative_ no less? Not only that_ the same people invariably seem to go out of their way to bash anyone who doesn't like midazolam_ which seems even stranger.","For the most recent instance of bashing_ see the below comment from 4/2/2009 in which anyone opposed to the use of midazolam is labeled a ""hypochondriac"" and ""drama queen."" What is even more hilarious about this particular comment is that its author actually attempts to also discredit the ENTIRE  Web site (i.e._ not just the Versed ratings page) by pointing out that elsewhere on the site_ there are complaints about Advil_ including suggestions that Advil be outlawed. This_ of course_ is meant to imply that anyone here who posts any comment that is critical of a drug_ is some kind of crackpot or other miscellaneous nutcase_ and_ as such_ should not be listened to.",M,53,1  times,4/3/2009,Versed
537, 1, (continued from above),By contrast_ I think it's pretty understandable why people who have suffered adverse effects from a drug would post comments about it -- i.e._ I'd imagine they'd want to raise other people's awareness to the drug's side effects_ so that others could be spared the same suffering. Indeed_ it seems completely logical that a person who had a bad experience with a drug would have every reason to post about it. But why would someone who had a POSITIVE experience with a drug_ care so much as to seek out a Web site and write about it? It makes no sense. I mean_ let's say you just came back from the dentist after getting a tooth pulled_ and the novocaine that the dentist used worked well for you. After leaving the dentist's office_ would it be high on your list of priorities to go on the Internet and actually write about how much you liked the novocaine? I think not.,Anyway -- go ahead and ask any doctor if there is a single medical situation in which the use of midazolam is actually NECESSARY. You'll quickly learn that the drug is quite simply NOT NECESSARY for the induction or maintenance of general anesthesia_ or for colonoscopies and endoscopies. It does_ however_ remain in frequent use for each. So_ given that midazolam is totally unnecessary_ *and* that it produces serious ongoing side effects in tons of patients_ why is the drug used at all? The likely answer is_ it makes doctors' and nurses' jobs easier -- by zonking unsuspecting patients into a compliant_ memory-devoid oblivion. Never mind that midazolam has_ in numerous scientific studies_ been shown to produce widespread neuronal apoptosis in laboratory animals. In humans_ this drug is also often the gateway to a living hell that can last months beyond the procedure for which it was administered.,M,53,1  times,4/3/2009,Versed

When I was finally able to scream_ the doctor had finally noticed that something was wrong.  Getting perforated is a  risk that I accept_ being unable to respond or cry out when I was in severe pain was unacceptable.,It's obvious that a lot of people have severe  problems with this drug; the doctor doing the exam never informed me that this drug would render me imobile and unable to communicate.

Completely painless_ no discomfort at all.,Do not let the hypochondriacs and drama queens on these websites scare you.

Not sure why she had this reaction; very unnerving to watch her.  I personally would not have this drug for myself unless my husband was present due to the loss of dignity and lack of control over circumstance.

Hundreds of people on this site and elsewhere_ however_ beg to differ. Sadly_ they know all too well the profound_ long-term cognitive impairment this drug can cause. For doctors to point to midazolam's ""ultra-short"" duration of action as somehow being an indicator of its safety_ is laughable. By the same logic_ if someone were to plunge a six-inch knife deep into my chest for one second and then remove it_ I guess it could likewise be argued that the knife's duration of action was ""ultra-short_"" too.

It is only by reading my record that I found out what caused my problems. Side effects are complete memory loss of treatment. I have PTSD. I am afraid of medical procedures and environments. I awoke scared of everything. I had a huge headache. I now have dreams and nightmares. I continue to have memory problems. I often lack the ability to have ordered thinking and often feel confused.Even though it has been two years. I almost lost my job and I had to repeat a year of graduate school.I get no sympathy from the doctors who treated me at university hospital in Syracuse N.Y. In fact they refuse to speak to me.I have tried lawyers to no avail.My life is now a living nightmare. I am a nurse who can no longer practice because the PTSD is so severe.

583, 1, Endoscopic Procedure,I remember being wheeled to the little room and the nurses asking me to switch to the table. I was a little nervous but nothing out of the ordinary. They gave me a Versed - Demerol cocktail and I remember getting sleepy and the next thing I remember was waking up in the middle of the procedure. I was choking and trying to get the endoscope out of my throat and the nurse was pushing me back down on the table. I was angry and in pain_ but the nurse and doctor just kept yelling at me to lay down. Which means they probably shot me up with more Versed. Anyway when I woke up I was confused and scared_ I couldn't be alone because I thought something was going to happen to me. I was like that for two or three days along with in and out bouts of amnesia. It took about a month for me to feel completely normal. I don't know if this is a side effect of the drug but now I can't go in a hospital because I get really bad panic attacks.,This drug made me into a nervous wreck and as far as I am concerned it should be outlawed.

I was not told that I would experience a complete memory block. I did not research this drug prior to my procedure_ so I take some responsibility for not knowing. I am grateful that I didn't have any negative side effects and am sorry for those who have. I am also grateful that I have no recollection of my procedure as I am very fearful of dentists and put this procedure off for over a year because of it.

It was given to ""relax"" me prior to having the nerve block (optional procedure designed to make the pain a bit more bearable following the surgery - I forget the name of the procedure_ but it did have one).",In reading these comments_ I had no idea that Versed had this effect on some.  I only stumbled onto this after doing some reading up on what Versed actually was_ as I'd never heard of it before.

Before they went to work the doc was chatting with me and I already said I was not nervous or particularly upset. I got the ""something to relax you"" line but I said ""no""  - I felt it wasn't necessary. You guessed it_ I got it anyway. Like many here before me_ I wanted to talk_ but could not get the words out. I'm not sure if anything came out. I was not paralyzed_ but it was difficult to move. That was bad enough_ but there were times when I felt more of my foot that I cared to but there was nothing I could do to communicate my discomfort.",The amnesia part did not work (as far as I know!)

I had a slight headache that night_ which worsened when I lay down;it continued for a while the next morning under the same circumstances. I have no memory of those 20 minutes but it felt like I'd had a dreamless nap; I felt good.  For me_ that was a plus;I avoid taking naps because I feel awful and not refreshed at all when I do. The medical staff was totally professional and I trusted them to treat me well.,My HMO provided full written disclosure of the procedure in advance_ including that I'd be given Versed and fentanyl.

598, 1, preoperative sedation,"It's worth noting that many of the recent positive Versed ratings posted here seem disingenuous_ and designed to boost Versed's average Askapatient rating. For example_ the 81-year-old male from December 23_ 2008_ who gives Versed a ""5"". Dosages of Versed like the ones he describes are contraindicated in the elderly_ so it's unlikely that any responsible medical professional would administer such dosages to an 81-year-old. Bogus comment. The endoscopy nurse from January 9_ 2009 likewise gives Versed a ""5_"" but never indicates if she has ever received Versed herself. A ""5"" rating means ""Very Satisfied: this medicine cured me or helped me a great deal."" Well_ I don't doubt that Versed indeed helps MEDICAL PERSONNEL (like an endoscopy nurse) a great deal... specifically_ by rendering patients docile and_ as a result_ more manageable. Versed does nothing_ however_ to help THE PATIENT.","More ridiculous yet is the recent ""Knee Surgery"" comment from January 10_ 2009... this ""real person"" actually THANKS THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY ""for manufacturing this product."" Gimme a break. The pharmaceutical industry has one goal: to sell as much product as possible_ just like any other business. That's why when you turn your TV on_ every two minutes you hear the phrase_ ""Ask your doctor about _____."" The pharmaceutical industry is not an industry motivated by altruism_ and it likely abhors the existence of Web sites like this_ on which people can freely make comments that are critical of its products.

I was so scared_ I almost bailed out of the pre-op room before the surgery_ fearing it would alter me forever. Not to discount the individual experiences_ as everyone is different_ but that is not at all what I experienced. Perhaps because I discussed my fears with the anesthesiologist_ or perhaps because I ultimately handed control over to professionals_ but the experience couldn't have been better.

In other words_ if you don't like Versed_ you're crazy or otherwise defective. After all_ the *drug itself* can't be defective or unsafe_ right? (Just like Vioxx wasn't unsafe.)

607, 1, ,"The endo nurse whose comment appears a few below this one seems to have conferred upon herself an honorary doctorate in psychology. Using her logic_ the effects of Versed are dependent upon patients' life experiences. Given such a poorly defined method of predicting adverse reactions to the drug_ exactly why would she then see fit to ""routinely"" administer the drug? Versed is a drug that's caused the deaths of over 40 people_ as reported in this NY Times article: http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DB113DF937A35754C0A967958260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=all  It has also caused intense_ ongoing suffering in hundreds more_ as is clear from the comments posted below. For the endo nurse to hypothesize that underlying mental problems in the patient (e.g._ PTSD) -- rather than the drug itself -- are responsible for adverse reactions_ is a predictable attempt to essentially demonize as ""psychos"" anyone who happens to object to Versed.",Concerning the endo nurse's assertion that it's the patient's responsibility to read and understand the consent form_ I'd say that a far greater responsibility rests with medical personnel like herself -- namely_ to fully explain to patients the effects of Versed_ a process which frequently does not happen. Versed is not necessary to induce or maintain general anesthesia and is used mainly to cause temporary anterograde amnesia_ which medical science has apparently deemed a benefit to the patient. Versed is also the most potent benzodiazepene currently in existence. It works mainly by impairing GABAergic neurotransmission. Given the drug's potency_ I think that it's naive for medical practitioners to assume that this effect is merely temporary_ and that permanent damage to hippocampal neurons is not possible. It is unconscionable that this drug remains in such widespread use.,M,38, ,1/11/2009,Versed

It saddens me that there are so many people who blame the medical community for being ""sadistic"" or ""giving me more drugs when I didn't ask for them"". No one is ""lying/tricking/deceiving"" you-the medication IS intended to relax and help you forget. If you appear uncomfortable during the procedure_ we DO give you more-because our goal is to make you as comfortable as possible.  The doctors and we nurses have concluded that it is mostly the patients who have experienced sexual abuse or traumatic experiences who have the reactions of 'violation' and 'something bad having happened'. Perhaps it is their own unfortunate experiences that cause PTSD_ not the Versed?",You need to sign a consent form PRIOR to being sedated (which discusses sedation and it's risks)_ which is your patient responsibility to read. If you don't understand it_ ask. You do have the option to have the procedure without sedation.

671, 5, 4 hour rhinoplasty,None. I don't want to remember pain_ cutting or anything else. I agree with other posters that having a skilled OR nurse or anesthesiologist is the key. They should be able to tell if you're not under completely and feeling pain because your blood pressure and heart rate goes way up. A proper balance of the meds is pure bliss. I actually don't mind having surgery because the drugs make it peaceful and easy. I've been under general anesthesia before and the versed/narcotic/anti-nausea combo is MUCH easier to come out of. Just voice your concerns to your doctor_ make sure he/she understands your fears and if you've reacted to anything before. I'm very surprised to hear the negative experiences because I've never had them or known anyone who has.,Bring on the drugs! I LOVE versed and fentanyl. I've had this combo multiple times for different surgeries and have never had a bum experience. I don't know why anyone would want to remember their procedure. I don't_ so versed is a wonderful drug in my opinion. Nausea is caused by narcotics. My mom can't handle demerol but does okay with fentanyl. They can also add an anti nausea drug to the cocktail so you don't vomit or feel sick. I don't know what anti-nausea drug was used on me but I never felt nauseous.

672, 4, Colonoscopy and EGD,"First experience was a combination of Versed and Demerol.  I had a colonoscopy as well as an endoscopy because I had symptoms of stomach pain and bloating. This was a pleasant experience and I remember most of my colonoscopy. I had no pain or after effects. Second experience was with an EGD to test for Celiac Sprue. This time I had a combination of Versed and Fentanyl. Remember none of the procedure but was nauseated and dizzy with a bad headache after waking. I had told my doctor that I wanted the same anesthetic mix I'd had with the Colonoscopy and he said ""we have the cocktail in your file so don't worry"". So much for that! I was very dissatisfied with the second procedure because I was sick afterwards. When I got home I slept for a few hours and awoke without the nausea and dizziness but still had a slight headache. I don't know if Fentanyl has the same side effects of Morphine ( do know Fentanyl is a synthetic form of Morphine) but my record showed extreme sensitivity to","I've been reading that Versed causes amnesia and one is conscious during procedures but remembers none of it.

I had surgery at 7:00 a.m. on Friday which lasted for 6 hrs and then was in recovery for 5 hrs.I had severe complications during surgery & almost died. I didn't know any of this until I read the operative report of my surgeon two weeks later. I have no memory of recovery onward until Sunday evening. I was in ICU on respirator and NG tube until Saturday mornign and then I talked with family coherently carrying on conversations which I no longer remember.I don't remember seeing my husband that weekend even though he was right by my side before/during/after this risky procedure that almost killed me.,I hate that I lost such memories. I've had 4 other general anesthesia surgeries in the past w/o problem (never had Versed). I am so angry to have lost essentially 3 days of my life.I'm obsessed with trying to get my memory back which is very frustrating and impossible.I'm driving my family nuts making them tell me over & over what happened during those days.Everyone tells me to 'just let it go' but I can't and I don't think I ever will. I lost 3 days with my husband of 13 yrs of marriage.,F,37,1  days,6/19/2008Email,Versed
715, 5, colonoscopy,No side effects that I know of. Versed and the fentanyl worked wonderfully to put me out while I had a colonoscopy done. Within an hour of the procedure_ my memory was reliable. I was a little out of it for a few more hours until it all wore off.,"I had 10 mg Versed and 200 mcg Fentanyl (5'7"" and 130 lbs) and loved it. No pain or awareness at all. Very little recovery time needed after the procedure.",F,46,1  days,6/17/2008Email,Versed
716, 4, Gastroendoscopy Prep,VERY pleasant reduction of anxiety_ even hours after 20-minute procedure.  Near-total amnesia for hours_ which was DISORIENTING.  Talked intelligently and then could not remember conversations_ hours after procedure.  Thought amnesia period was over before it actually was.,6 mg Versed + 100 mcg Fentanyl for endoscopy (EGD). Id read scary posts about contemporaneous suffering masked by amnesia. Id had painful local-only nasal endo before. Told dr_nurse I didnt want to FEEL pain and FORGET_ but PREVENT discomfrt. Dr gave maybe high(?)dose both meds. I insisted wife be in procedure room; she sez I slept eyes closed til tube put in_ gaggd then_ then showed no discomfrt exc a little hand mvt toward tube 2x_ prob to ask for suction. Got suction_ gave thumbs-up. Recall 0 of procedure_ exc maybe dim thumbs-up. W watched for pain signs_ saw none exc for that. Dimly recall calm while wheeld out_ dimly recall good (noncancer) results_ 0 details. Lots of rest of day blanked from memory_ DISORIENTING to the point of queasiness.  I hear I carried on lucid talks w/o drug signs but did not recall them hrs later. Kept thinkng mem-loss part was over_ but still forgot a great deal after I thought amnesia was over.

717, 1, wisdom teeth extraction,my 21 year old daughter has been in the psych ward for weeks!,"No one can tell us for sure right now_ but a few days after having her wisdom teeth extracted she became irrational and we took her to the ER.  She is a catatonic mute.  She has no history of mental illness BUT she had versed 2 years ago for a lymph node procedure and also was ""out of it"" for about 2 weeks after the procedure.  She was really in a fog BUT this is the most horrific experience_ they say she may have had a ""predisposition"" to have a dissassociative reaction.  No one knows and they are now giving her shock therapy to try to bring her back.  All I can say at this point is beware.  I just want her to come out of this!",F,21,2  times,6/12/2008,Versed
718, 2, Colonoscopy,I could not communicate with the doctor.  Although I have a family history of colon cancer and had in the past remove polyps from me he suggested waiting 5 years.  I have no memory of telling him off.,If you don't mind making a fool out of yourself take the Versed or any of its equals.,M,61,3  times,6/8/2008,Versed
719, 5, cataract surgery,No side effects.,"Versed worked for me exactly as I hoped it would. I felt no pain or discomfort or nausea. I don't recall much about the surgical experience_ but what I do remember just made the procedure seem interesting to me. Afterward_ I woke up quickly with no ""hangover"" feeling. I would not hesitate to have Versed again.",F,68,1  days,6/6/2008,Versed
720, 5, Colonoscopy,Some memory loss following the recovery period and some tiredness_ although an hour nap cured that.,I have had Versed given during 3 procedures - eyelid surgery_ hernia repair and colonoscopy. I experienced no serious problems to speak of_ aside from some disorientation and memory loss (getting dressed and getting to the car) following the colonoscopy procedure. The other two occasions were quite remarkable to me in that one moment I was on the surgical table and in the blink of an eye I was in recovery. Each time I thought the experience to be peculiar but not unpleasant. I guess I am fortunate in not having any problems with modern anesthetics. I am old enough to remember a very bad experience when ether was given to me as a boy. I am very happy that we have progressed well beyond that.,M,67,3  times,6/5/2008,Versed
721, 4, colonoscopy,It did what I hoped it would do_ which is make me sleep through the procedure.  After_ I was tired and sleepy_ but coherent. The next day was horrible.  I felt like I was hung over.  I had a severe headache_ nauseous_ exhausted and sleepy.  I was also given fentanyl_ but I had fentanyl before with no side effects.,,F,34,2  days,6/3/2008,Versed
722, 1, colonoscopy,I wasn't given enough pain medication. Versed had me powerless to scream out for help or tell them I was in pain and didn't get enough medication. It was the scariest experience of my life_ Don't EVER let anyone use this drug on you....it's a nightmsre!!!!,it should be taken off the market_ or used for midevil torture purposes!!,F,51,1  days,5/26/2008,Versed
723, 5, hysterectomy and colonoscopy/endo,No side effects. I have been given this drug for 2 procedures and it has worked just as it should.  It alleviated my anxiety and I felt no pain and felt very rested and alert upon awakening. I went home afterward and ate a big breakfast and then went to sleep for a few hours and felt fine when I awoke.,I was given versed the first time before my hysterectomy and I was very anxious before the surgery. After they gave me the versed_ I remember feeling that I did not have a care in the world and I was not frightened at all by the thought of the surgery.  So a year later when I had my colonoscopy I requested that they use versed and I was very happy with it.  If I need another surgery in the future_ I will request versed again.,F,52, ,5/25/2008,Versed
724, 1, colonoscopy,treated roughly because they relied on the amnesia that was supposed to happen,wasn't informed about the amnesia effect; I now list versed as an allergy on my chart and state that I had it years ago and it caused mehives and difficulty breathing...that way I'll never get it again.....same for droperidol..versed is an excuse for abuse,M,44,1  days,5/24/2008,Versed
725, 3, cervical facet block,I do not remember anything during the procedure_ the sedation worked fine.  I did feel very drowsy and sleepy during the day_ had partial memory loss during the day of the procedure.,For at least one week after the sedation process I have felt nauseous and have been experiencing dizziness.  I have not been able to work or drive for this past week.  When I was called by phone for follow up after the procedure I reported this and was told this was probably due to the sedation with versed.  I would cautiosly recommend this drug for sedation prior to a procedure because these symptoms I am feeling post op have slowed me down and I feel awful with this nausea and dizziness.  Please ask for all possible side effects of this drug before a procedure.  I dont think I will have this drug again for any other procedure.,F,48,1  times,5/23/2008,Versed
726, 1, Biopsy,"It did not put me out completely. I was aware of much of the procedure and I experienced sleep paralysis. I wanted to move and talk but could not. It was very distressing. A few days later I had a little ""chat"" with my surgeon and said I would never use this drug again. Also my memory was inconsistent over the following several days. It seems like the drug took a long time to finally clear my system.",I had a biopsy as a teenager under local and it was fine.

My memory was still quite fragmented from the time I left the doctors office unilt after I got home and took a nap.,I was given 7 mg of versed and 100 mcg of fentanyl(6 ft_ 185 lbs) for an endoscopy and had no adverse effects. I was very mellow and a bit loopy after the procedure and for a few hours after until the medications wore off_ but after lunch and a nap I felt fine. I'm sorry so many people seemed to have adverse/unpleasant reactions to this drug_ but for me it worked great and I have no complaints.

Dr told her to give me 1mg (not the usual 2-4mg)_ next I remember being wheeled back to recovery.  I'm very disappointed that I don't remember. For the next 3days_ I was constantly close to or actually crying.   I would not recommend this drug_ will not take it again.  Dr said I'm ultra-senstive_ especially since I dont drink or smoke.

732, 5, lumbar epidural injection,a little confusion and sleepiness the remainder of the day,I was terrified of my procedure and really worked myself into a frenzy. Of course_ I felt foolish when it was over. I would definitely agree to have it administered for future procedures. It was not in combination with another drug_ just by itself.

My cardoligist won't ever see me again because of my outbusts during the recovery period. I don't remember anything then them putting the versed in IV and eating a sandwich just before going home.

737, 4, endoscopy/colonoscopy,i am having some anxiety days later_ anger at very minor incidents_ but i have anxiety issues_ so this may be due to a delayed reaction re: the procedure itself.,i was pretty anxious until they gave me the versed_ but i definitely remember everything until i was given the propofol for general.  i remember being wheeled into the room with my doctor_ asking her how she was doing_ making bets with her about how long the procedure would take_ joking with the anesthesiologist--everything until i actually went under. when i was given the versed in the prep/recovery room_ i asked what i was being given and i was told.  my anesthesiologist was a really funny_ sweet guy and we talked about his own upcoming colonoscopy and how much he hated the fleet phospho soda you take the day before.  if i had my way i'd rather have gone the valium/demerol route for the procedure but due to the fact that i already take valium i was told it was too risky--fair enough since sometimes i can get so anxious that 100mg of valium is not enough to calm me down.  i think that it's possible that you may have a bad reaction to the drug--anyone can have a bad reaction to any,F,37, ,4/10/2008,Versed
738, 3, Pre-op medication,"I have been given Versed three times pre-op (NOT in combination with another drug)--D&C due to miscarriage_ lumpectomy_ and gall bladder removal. Twice_ I felt dizzy and disoriented (D&C_ lumpectomy); I remember the ""beginning"" of the surgery_ but not much else until it was over. Those times_ I had Fentanyl post op for pain_ and it worked well. I was very anxious about the gall bladder surgery_ so the nurse anesthetist gave me Versed in pre-op. I immediately felt nauseated and more agitated_ truly horrible--shaking and really wanting to get up and get out. I tried to explain that I felt worse_ but I was taken into OR anyway_ very queasy_ gagging. I was woken up in post-op_ literally_ by throwing up. This was exceedingly painful. I realize the Demerol used post-op for pain probably contributed_ but the Versed by itself made me nauseated.

I was calm the rest of the day.  However_ in the following days_ I experienced severe depression and still have great amounts of anxiety three days later.,I would_ with great caution_ recommend this drug to anyone that is nervous about a procedure_ but be sure to ask your doctor about dealing with the side effects I share.

I stayed awake during much of the colonoscopy and some of the endoscopy.  I forgot the end of the endoscopy but woke up easily at the end_ before I was moved to a rest area.  I felt alert_ clear-headed_ relaxed_ and hungry.  I was not excessively tired although ready to sleep that night.  No side effects or after effects.

I was relaxed as they wheeled me into surgery and I woke up in recovery fine and dandy.,After reading the comments I feel sorry for those who had this in pre-op. They gave me the shot after everything was explained and the surgeon went away to scrub. I was relaxing as they set me on the table and I said Thank you for taking good care of me. That is the last thing I remember after the shot. I remember everything before the shot from the knee shaving to the DR writing his initals on my knee.,M,39,1  days,3/31/2008,Versed
746, 4, colonoscopy,In combination with fentanyl. I only remember a few minutes of the 28 minute procedure.,I don't remeber insertion of the colonoscope. I remember a few moments of what was on the video screen. The scope would not go in the last 6 inches - even with Doc cramming it in and the nurse pushing on my gut. I was moaning so they gave me more fentanyl. They tried again_ I remember moaning again. Later the Doc told me he tried twice_ but could not get the scope all the way in. After the procedure they removed the IV_ I stood up and felt fine_ so I was able to leave. On the ride home_ I got cold sweats_ nausea and turned pale. My back was soaking wet. I laid down and rested for an hour and then felt fine. My concern now is what caused the cold sweats? Could I have had a heart attack on the way home and not felt it because of the fentanyl? Maybe PTSS? Maybe I'm paranoid.,M,54,1  days,3/28/2008,Versed
747, 5, trans esophageal echocardiogram,loss of memory of procedure,"I was given 2 or 2.5 mg of versed and 15mg of demerol_ both IV for closeup pictures of my heart taken through my esophagus.

Last thing I remember was them hooking me up to the monitors and saying my heart rate was too high_ then saying "" ok_ time to start_ give her the versed"" next thing I knew_ I (in a daze) became aware of the tube in my throat_ so tried pulling it out! they said ""oh no you don't_ we'll do that for you. we're all done anyway"" I said _"" what?

749, 5, Endoscopy,I had only brief lapses of memory during the day of my procedure but was given enough Versed along with Demoral that I don't remember any of the procedure_ endured no pain during (and only mild discomfort afterwards) and tolerated the dosage they gave me quite well. I fell asleep before the procedure and awoke feeling like I had slept for days. And after not having slept due to my nerves beforehand_ I really needed it. I was VERY concerned with having this drug from some of the stories/comments I had read_ but I am definitely someone who is satisfied with my experience and very glad that I 'slept' through it all.,,F,35,1  days,3/24/2008,Versed
750, 3, Breast Biopsy,I am confused by what happened after my biopsy. After getting an IV prior to surgery I remember nothing...I just woke up and later needed only one dose of pain medication at home. However_ in a week or so my patience was gone and I was provoked by annoyances I had previously tolerated. It evolved into a deep depression.  I felt terribly unhappy_ hopeless_ anxious and frightened. I reduced my outside activities and stayed close to home. I began to obsess about possible injury in an accident or being taken advantage of by a manipulative person. I avoided interacting with strangers and did not put myself into situations I could not control.  It took three months to feel more like myself and six months before I could tackle life with my old confidence.,I would caution people to ask their anesthesiologist whether this drug triggers depression_ particularly in anyone with loss or trauma issues in their personal history. I believe it is powerful enough to trigger suicidal thoughts. I am planning to ask my surgeon if there are any studies correlating this drug with post-surgical depression or suicide. I thank everyone who is posting--otherwise_ I might not have made the connection to the random change in my mood.,F,60,1  days,3/22/2008,Versed

It was certainly a lifesaver for me.  This was a risky and highly invasive surgery_ and for the first time before a surgery I was extremely nervous.  I awoke several hours later feeling fine_ other than the lingering effects from the general anesthesia.  YOU MUST FAST PRIOR TO THE PROCEDURE_ otherwise you can expect to have a negative experience.

I could not sit still and they ended up stopping the procedure and now I have to reschedule.,I have to rely on them to tell me what happened since I can recall only vaguely small flashes.

Upon waking up from procedure he was kicking and trashing around and they had to pull out his IV.  He would hit everyone and everything_ scream and hated everyone. He wanted a drink but would hit the cup out of our hands. We checked web on the medication and when we told the doctor we thought it was the Versed he indicated that it would not be four hours later.  Wrong!!!  NEVER GIVE TO A CHILD.",This medication turned a little 4 yr old boy who was so brave about breaking his arm into a totally uncontrollable child.

755, 5, Biopsy,Weak and a tad unable to walk for hours afterward_ very drowsy and sleepy_ unable to remember things that day,It's sad to hear all of these horrible experiences with Versed; perhaps the doctor didn't know what s/he was doing?When I had my biopsies (3 separate times)_ my doctor sat down with me_ explained I would be given Versed with some other drugs_ and what Versed will do to my memory and if I was okay with that.  I was_ and told him so and signed some paperwork.  I felt like I fell asleep and then woke up with no memory or pain at all.  I was drowsy during the day and a bit weak to walk (but I don't know if that is attributed to Versed only)_ but was thankful I didn't remember anything.  I feel very thankful I had a fine experience with it reading everyone else's bad experiences.  Wow guys_ I'm so sorry to hear that you had bad experiences and/or bad doctors.

I could hear the doctor but had no pain and was just a little woozy afterward. I did sleep a good bit the first day after I got home but felt so rested the next morning.  This was after each of the oral surgeries.    ,I have one question. Has anyone else had this experience?  The next day I felt no arthritis symptoms in my knees. I was totally pain free for 2 days.  Then the effects wore off and I had pain again. Why? Sure wish they could bottle that in a pill.,F,69,4  times,3/11/2008Email,Versed
757, 4, Colonoscopy,I asked for minimal sedation and was given a combo of demerol and versed.  I was awake for the procedure_ watched the monitor_ conversed with the Dr. and nurse and made dopey jokes. A polyp was found and clipped. I don't remember any significant discomfort ... actually I don't remember any at all.  When they were done I was alert enough to ask questions_ remember the answers and didn't need a post procedure meeting as we covered it all then.   I had a bit of vertigo for a day_ but was able to make soup soon after the procedure.  It was clear it was unsafe to drive.,Two days later I am having crying bouts that I think may be after affects the versed.  I think in the future I'd ask for maybe 20% less of whichever drug made me weepy.  I'm glad I found this site as I thought the blues had other sources.

759, 1, Insignificant surgery,Side effect is a ridicules phrase used by the medical profession_ my experience with versed is permanent. They brush me off and say its my problem....... I understand why they say that and it is a horrifying realization_ thats when it becomes permanent.........,They wont allow you to know how they treat you when under the effects of Versed_ what type of mind does  it take to stand by with indifference as human beings scream in pain? I think I know. Keep in mind that the word normal is a variable_ what is acceptable today may_ after the passing of time be view as a horrific act. It is ridicules to think that the thoughts of a society will not advance or regress greatly in a short time or over a half century.  A little over a half century ago a society  spent the day shopping_  reading the news paper that described the greatness of the societies achievements. Life was normal and good_ children played on the streets and it seamed as if the best of times.

762, 5, Upper endoscopies_ eyelift,I briefly woke up during one endoscopy_ this is because the doctor was not titrating the drugs correctly. During the eyelift I fell asleep before the procedure_ and slept through the entire thing.  I was given Fentanyl_ Versed_ and a local.  An RN was responsible for titrating my meds. In fact_ a great many plastic surgeries are done with only Versed_ Fentanyl and Marcaine!,I am myself an RN who performs conscious sedation every day. Your experience with Versed depends on the skill of the person performing it.  Versed must be titrated skillfully along with a narcotic to make your experience a pleasant one.  As far as after effects_ Versed does not cause nausea_ that is the narcotic. Versed relieves anxiety and promotes very short term memory loss. The long term effects described by many patients on this site is puzzling_ because Versed only stays in the system for 6 hours. Many of the symptoms described_ such as pain and anxiety during the procedure_ are the result of not being given enough of the meds instead of vice versa. My patients enjoy having their scopes done_ it is a dreamy experience for them.  I have never heard complaints such as I am reading on this site! Those of you who have had a bad experience with a procedure in the past should seek a new surgeon_ or inform your doctor of your past discomfort.  No  patient should suffer during any proced,F,47, ,3/2/2008Email,Versed

The staff and medication created the anxiety.,"I am extremely pragmatic and deal with reality better then the unknown.  I am not afraid of death though I dislike pain. I could have understood medication for for the two and half days on life support but for more then 11 days...why?  I was raped years ago and trust is difficult enough.  The hospital staff wrote for ""anxiety"" damn the versed and the attitudes of excluding me in my care caused anxiety. I've cared for many family members so I am prepared and not afraid I want to know not have information hidden from me.  No one discussed versed with me or prepared my family for the reactions it gives. I never want any medication like that ever again!  I am one who can and will deal with reality.

815, 3, Oral Surgery,My oral surgeon gave me Versed for a very painful tooth removal. I remember nothing but flashes of moments after receiving the IV of Versed. I was dating a new man who agreed to take me & bring me home from the procedure.  One of those memory flashes after the procedure was of being forced to preform oral sex on the man who brought me home. I thought I had had some bad dream & didn't understand why I would dream such a thing. The bloody gauze from my surgery was on my nightstand & my mouth & throat hurt in ways that had nothing to do with surgery. I never went to the police with any suspicions because I couldn't prove a thing.  It has bothered me constantly since the day it happened & I finally went to my oral surgeon's office to ask them what it was they gave me.  Part of my delay in asking them was out of humiliation & embarassment of trying to relay to them what I did remember.  I asked them if what they gave me could cause me to semi-function like I had with,The drug worked as it was supposed to but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!  make sure you trust who you are around after being given ANY amount of this drug at all.  You are putting your health_ well being & personal safety in jeopardy if you don't.  It's been a yr & I still can't recall everything. PLEASE BEWARE!!!,F,40,1  times,11/12/2007,Versed

I recall hearing the staff tell me the procedure was over and also asking the Doctor what he found in there. I have a faint recollection of him telling me that he removed a few pollips that would be sent to the lab for analysis. That's about it. If I experienced any significant pain I have no memory of it.

He told my husband that I must have been really tired because I didn't stir during the entire procedure. My husband got me dressed and brought me home.  I ate a light breakfast and a few hours later went shopping with my sister.  About 5PM I took a little nap and the next day I took a long nap.The lack of memory thing is fine.  I don't need to know or remember if and when my body is in pain.  I would definitely have that combination again.  My results from the procedure were good.

I was a normal_ happy_ well adjusted_ adult victim of child abuse.  I had no idea that a drug like this could cause me to feel the same helplessness and rage that I felt as a child.  This was much worse than the abuse however because I told the nurse that I have a severe reaction to a general anesthetic.  He should have known that if I wake up fighting_ crying and furious from a general_ that turning me into a zombie or erasing my concious memory would be just as detrimental.

I ended up with a wrenched back and the IV in my other hand ripped me up inside.Since this happened a week ago I have felt like ripping someones heart out and feeding it to them. A real rage.I'm looking for an attorney.

I have a fairly high tolerance to pain being a liver transplant patient_ I've had many procedures.

997, 2, Gen'l. anesthesia - abdominal surg.,Info provided to me by nurse following my surgery:   I awoke in Intensive care following abdominal surgery to repair an umbilical hernia.  Apparently when the anesthesiologist attempted to reverse the versed induced sleep_ my heart began an irregular function (heart attack on the table).  I was told by the nurse and later by the doctor that this kind of thing was seen from time to time in patients where VERSED is used to induce sleep (General Anesthesia).,"I was told that my being ""hypothyroid"" may also have been a contributing factor.  Secondly however._ I have heard from several people that have either had problems or know someone who has had problems during reversal attempts of VERSED induced general anesthesia.    FYI: VERSED is widely used to induce general anesthesia in most surgical processes_ including oral surgery.  The reason it is so widely used is because (I am told) it is a shorter acting drug and easier to reverse than other drugs of its type.  In addition_ because of it's memory killing ability_ it helps erase any memory of waking up during surgery or of severe pain during surgical procedures. Versed has been used on me for general anesthesia purposes eight times. Each use was roughly 2 hours in duration and only produced a heart problem once.  But then again_ humans only have one life to live and all I can say is ""buyer beware"".",M,48,8  times,11/21/2005Email,Versed

When I complained to the anestheologist all I got was a lecture about how I had to trust 'those who know what they are doing'_ this after catching him red handed misrepsenting what he was going to do! I think this drug would be fine if used to give people choices_ but it suspect it is mainly being used to speed things up.

At that point_ I was irritated because I don't like to take more meds than necessary and don't like the groggy feeling you get sometimes from demerol_ etc.A couple of minutes after he gave me the shot_ they wheeled me into the OR.  I was starting to feel a little strange; I was getting dizzy_ nauseaous and I had a really bad bitter taste in the back of my mouth.

Please note that many anesthesiologists will now try to insist on giving you propofol because nurses can now administer versed_ so insurance companies will not pay for an anesthesiologist to administer it.

1030, 1, Colonoscopy,Yesterday morning_ I experienced my first_ and possibly last_ colonoscopy.  Precisely at 7:30_ the scheduled time for my procedure_ the nurses began rolling my hospital bed to a small room where the equipment was set up and ready.  The old hospital was drafty_ so one of the nurses grabbed a heated blanket from a cabinet and spread it over me as soon as the bed was positioned in the room.  The heat felt wonderful and I was looking forward to a cozy nap after which I could feel a sense of accomplishment for finally getting this dreaded test over and done with.  After a little fussing around with equipment and greeting the doctor_ I began to taste the pungent drugs being injected into my IV tube and drifted into sleep.The next thing I remember was pain in my abdomen; the worst cramps I had ever experienced.  I repeated several times_ That hurts! but the pain kept coming.  I begged_ Stop_ stopthat hurts! but the pain kept coming.  I didnt remember I was in a hospital and I couldnt see anyone around methe space outside my own mind was totally black and devoid of any images.  I think I tried to move or push away at whatever was hurting but I sensed I was being physically restrained.  I was aware that something was present in my anal area and I associated that with the source of the pain.  No one responded to my pleas for help and I continued to feel the painful cramping.  I felt abandoned_ unloved and became very frightened.  My mind_ suspended in a groggy_ semi-conscious state_ reasoned that I was being raped and an extreme sense of despair settled over me.  I couldnt move to help myself_ no one would help meI was without hope.  I began to cry and prayed I would die.When I awoke in the recovery area_ I had a sad_ sorrowful feelingthe way you feel after awaking from a bad dream.  I remembered calling out about the pain and when I saw a familiar nurse_ I ask her if the calling out had actually happened.  She confirmed that it had.  Later_ my husband was telling me about his conversation with the doctor immediately after the procedure.  The doctor told him I was crying during the procedure.  My husband didnt even ask the doctor why I was crying.  He didnt seem alarmed by this event and that brought back the feeling of abandonment.  At this point_ the actuality of the events had been verified and I knew these memories were a living nightmare_ not a dream.,Until I began researching the medication I was given_ I thought I was losing my mind.  I wasn't particularly stressed about the test (it was only a screening--no current problems) and I am normally fairly tolerant of pain and discomfort.  I couldn't understand my feelings until I read about the expeiences of others who had taken Versed for a colonoscopy.  I'll never take this drug again.  I think I'll have a virtual colonoscopy next time.  I don't think there is any pain to deal with.,F,57,1  times,1/29/2005,Versed
1031, 2, Colonoscopy,I had this for 2 colonoscopies. I felt like the experience could be odd the first time when I was waiting to go in for a colonoscopy. A patient coming out was in the curtained area near me. I could hear him babbling utter nonsense with the thought content of someone with a >.15 BAC. Both time it was administered I had various dreamlike thoughts and no memory at all of anything that happened. I had surgery under a general anesthesia two years before and there was no difference in my memory of either procedure. I do recall having a dream of talking to the doctor_ and I later learned from my wife that some parts of the dream were apparently stated during the procedure based on the doctor's comments to her after the procedure. This is essentially a legal date rape drug used for a legitimate purpose to put a 4'+ scope up the entire length of your large intestine. My guess is because Versed is not a general anesthesia there is no need for an anesthesiologist. Insurance companies like one less bill to pay for a single procedure. Don't be surprised if you learn that you made very personal or private comments during the procedure that you would not imagine making if you were not under the influence of Versed. I would want to know the alternative before having this drug administered again. Warnings or possible adverse effects are on over the counter medications_ but no one at the doctor's office mentioned the kind of effect the drug could have.

I STILL cannot remember many things that happened or things I said during my stay at the hospital. That extremely frustrates me even to this day. I had to have a second TURP 4 months later and refused any sedation whatsoever. I just had the spinal tap as I had the first time and I made out fine. I loved being awake and able to understand my urologist_ and to be awake in recovery and talk to the nurses. I was much happier the second surgery without Versed. NEVER AGAIN! Not if I can help it.,Some of my friends love it. I have nurse friends that have had to use it and truly love it. Not me. Count me out!,M,68, ,11/28/2004Email,Versed
1034, 1, endoscopy,Memory problems for for eight months .  I am slowly getting better_ but I will never use it again_ nor can I recommend it.,,F,70, ,11/14/2004,Versed
1035, 1, prostate prosedure,briefly became sleepy but was awake within 15 minutes.  was told that I would not remember anything about the procedure_ but I remember every painful sordid detail,I continually told the dr. that I was in excrutiating pain_ but he did not believe me.  They told my son that I would not remember all this_ but I remember it all.  I thought I would have a heart attack it was so painful,M,75,1  times,11/10/2004,Versed
1036, 1, MAC before bilateral hernia repair,I can not recall anything that happened 2-3 minutes after the injection. I do not recall the trip to the OR nor anything that happened in the OR.,I was not informed of the amnesia effects and I did not appreciate being uninformed. I have had a lot of operations with little or no sedation.  I have a high tolerance for pain and surgery.  I prefer an anectdote to a memory gap.,M,43,1  times,11/3/2004Email,Versed
1037, 5, heart cath_  upper gi endoscope (2),I had no side effects that were unpleasant in any way.  The drug did exactly what the surgical staff said it would do,This drug made the procedures that I had done very easy and painless.,M,30,3  times,10/26/2004,Versed
1038, 1, Heart Cath and Stents,I told the &^%^$%^& at the heart hospital not to give me this drug as I had a reaction to this several years back during Carpal Tunnel release and they had to call in an Anesthesiolgist.I became so agitated and aggressive during the heart cath and stenting that almost ened up having to have heart bypass surgery.  I was trying to get up off the table while they were working in my heart!~!,I was yelled at during the heart cath to shut my mouth and act like an adult.  All this was unecessary if they had paid attention to me when I listed_,F,62, ,10/15/2004,Versed
1039, 2, Before surgical procedure,I was unaware of the amnesia effect of Versed and was very upset that I could not recall going into the operating room_ meeting the surgical staff_ etc.  I like to be involved with my care. I woke up mad and was hostile for days after surgery and had some permanent memory loss (banking PIN number_ for example).,If one is informed in advance that Versed will allow them to be conscious but not remember_ they can make an informed choice about using it.,F,49,1  times,9/2/2004Email,Versed
1040, 2, Given for colonoscopy sedation,Got agitated_ then hostile,Versed is an amnesiac. I remember the slight sting of the Versed and Demerol hitting my IV and then nothing until sometime later in the recovery room. The colonoscopy was incomplete due to my agitation and hostility from the Versed. Torqued my jaws that scope prep was all for nothing! It works wonderfully for most people. I'm just not one of them.,F,61,1  times,11/30/2003,Versed
