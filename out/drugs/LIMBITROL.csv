1, 5, Emotional Break Down,I really didn't have ANY side effects from this medication. All I can say is that this medication saved my life! It's an older medication but it's one that works very_ very_ well!,"I actually didn't have any side effects from taking this medication. As a matter of fact_ Limbitrol saved my life! Due to a bad marriage and other factors_ my doctor ran out of medication options_ because we tried so many different medications which I could not tolerate. He said_ ""I'm going to try you on one more medication_"" and if this doesn't work_ I'm going to admit you into the hospital. At this point I was too depressed to care. I took my first pill_ nothing! Then the next day_ I took another dose. By the third day_ I could actually feel something happening which was a good thing. By the second week_ I was feeling very hopeful! I could actually get dressed in the mornings_ and things just got better and better each day. I would recommend this medication to anyone who has severe depression and panic attacks. I can't say anything bad about it_ only good things!",F,61,8  years5-12.5 1X D,12/20/2011Email,Limbitrol
