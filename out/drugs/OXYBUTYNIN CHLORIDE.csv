0, 5, IC,none that I've noticed,I was given this medicine to help with the urgency I get with my IC. It has helped a lot_ and I find I have been going to the bathroom less often. I also like the fact that since it is a gel_ I get less side effects. I always used to get bad dry mouth with stuff like Vesicare and Detrol_ but none at all with this. The only downside is the gel is sticky after it dries and looks like a peeling sunburn by the next day_ but you can always wash off the residue after an hour and it doesn't interfere with the absorption according to the packet.,F,24,2  weeks,9/3/2009,Oxybutynin chloride
