1, 2, ADD,"When I would first take this drug after a school vacation_ I would often be sick at about noon for the first few days. This drug did help me to be successful in school along with therapy to learn coping mechanisms. This drug would cause me to have insomnia (something I do not have at all when I do not take it) and supressed appetite. While on this medication_ I noticed a significant increase in anxiety_ and I did not feel like myself. I often told my parents I felt as if this medication ""stole my soul"" because I was no longer interested in things that previously interested me. I do remember experiencing suicidal thoughts_ which is very unlike me. In the last 6 years that I have been off Ritalin_ I have not had anything near a suicidal thought and I am know as a very positive person.

2, 5, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue,Increased energy and decrease of fibromyalgia pain.  Decrease in appetite after I take it.,Initially my doctor perscribed this because I was so tired all the time_ even after 10-12 hous of sleep at night.  He wanted it to provide energy during the day for me.  It helps most days with that_ but it also decreases my fibro pain which also allows me to get more done during the day.  I love it!,F,38,5  years30mg 1X D,3/12/2011,Ritalin la

4, 5, Narcolepsy,Complete loss of appetite_ excessive cleaning_ good mood_ great drug!,"When I was diagnosed with narcolepsy I had to do the ""run around"" with all the drugs. When I got prescribed ritalin I loved it_ the only problem was that it didn't last long enough. I was switched over to ritalin LA extended release and it is a god send. I can focus on whatever. I can sit down read and do research for hours. I have to stop myself from working so hard. Weight loss is another. The idea of food makes me sick. Heart pounds_ but no discomfort.
