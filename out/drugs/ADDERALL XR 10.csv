1, 1, Adult ADD_ anxiety,dizziness_ diarrhea_ nervousness_ anxiety_ excess energy_ stomach upset_ and belching,I have family members and friends who take Adderall. They are doing so well. Their houses are clean_ they are succeeding in their work_ and in life in general. They look amazing. Since ADD runs in my family and I have always had issues with anxiety_ I decided to try it_ regrettably. The first couple of hours_ I had diarrhea_ stomach cramps_ and nervousness. I cleaned the house and didn't need to sit and break. I just cleaned for hours and didn't stop. Once I did stop cleaning_ I felt like hell. I was nervous_ anxious_ and nauseated. I am so thankful for this tired crash that I am experiencing now. I am really sad that I wasted $35 on them.. But I am thankful to be alive_ as a few times during the day_ I wondered if I was going to die.,F,31,1  days15 mg 1X D,11/22/2015,Adderall xr 10
2, 3, ADHD; Later on: Anxiety,Possibly linked to TrichotillomaniaLoss of appetite for the brand name drugCrawling feeling at night/restless leg syndromeSevere vertigo spellsIncreased/Decreased sex drive/Erectile problemsDryness/Always needing to stay hydrated,"I started taking Adderall in pill form at a early age. Off my meds_ I become very hyper and over-talkative. I developed Trichotillomania (Hair pulling) possibly from the medicine. (Also had meningitis when I was 1 which could have caused it.) which progressed to Trichophagia.(Chewing on hair) As I got older_ I was switched over to capsules. Nothing too bad until I was around 19-20 when started getting horrible vertigo spells a lot if I got up from sitting or lying down too quickly. It either cause about an 8 second rush of dizziness_ or the worst_ an almost seizure-like effect where_ for about 8 seconds I lose control of my body (the dizziness is so intense; with barely enough time to catch myself from collapsing) and start trembling throughout my body. Dryness and sex drive issues aren't to bad. At night_ I get so hungry. This seemed to have happened when I was switched over from brand to generic. Sleeping has always been a problem. Whenever I get close to sleeping_ my body does something to jolt me back awake_ like my body doesn't want me to sleep.(feels like something's crawling on me. Leg spasm_ or even a jolt to my heart like the feeling your heart feels like after a nightmare.) I wish they would put more effort in finding a cure for ADHD/ADD. With cancer_ all the mental disorders and other diseases are put on the back burner like we don't matter anymore. The pill may fix your problem but will cause other things to happen.

4, 4, Excessive fatigue_ ADD,Little bit of an upset stomach_ diaherra_ felt a little out of it for the first couple of days_ the third day was much better,The first couple of days taking Adderall I had a bit of an upset stomach.  The third day I was able to stay on task and complete a lot of things that I normally procrastinate with and that was a great feeling.  Hasn't really much with keeping me from wanting to sleep all the time.  I like that it helps me focus.  I've also noticed that things that used to cause me to become very angry or nervous_ don't really bother me anymore.  Although being all around happier was not the main reason I started taking this_ I've decided that I like other people. Before taking this I was just counting down the seconds before they annoyed the crap out of me.  I think this will work for the excessive tiredness_ but I might need to have the dosage upped.  I've been taking lexapro for depression for about 4 mos and before that I took zoloft for almost 20 years.  I imagine my life would be a lot different if one of the doctors that I was going to for all those years would've evaluated me for ADD.  Maybe a large amount of the depression and anxiety I had was mainly caused by my inability to complete tasks and projects that I started or needed to start.,F,41,3  weeks10,3/13/2015,Adderall xr 10
5, 5, ADD,Weight loss_ loosing hair_ jaw clenching,This medication has saved my life in all aspects. I was diagnosed with ADD as an adult wish it was sooner as then I would've done better in school. I started college as an adult and couldn't focus to even understand what the instructor was teaching so I decided to talk to my dr who was treating me for depression. He tried me on several different meds for add but adderall is the only one that helps. I've lost about 40 lbs in 5 mos. I do have some hair loss but as much hair as I have its not bald yet lol. I notice myself clenching my tongue piercing between my jaw teeth quite frequently which has filed down my teeth on one side. But I don't have the depression anxiety issues anymore. I can focus on whatever it needs to be and finally complete my task at hand. I was able to get my degree with a 4.0 GPA where as when I was in high school I was barely even passing my classes with a very low D. This has been heaven sent even with my mood so my relationship with my boyfriend_ family_ and friends have improved to the point of no return. I do think my medicine needs to be increased due to it not lasting til I finish my homework. I'm working on my 2nd degree.

7, 5, Adult Onset ADD,"Dry Mouth_ curbed appetite.  When I first started taking it_ I hardly took time to eat meals.  That in turn prompted headaches in the evening. I always have a small meal before taking my meds and it works great.  My life has changed for the better in so many ways.  Myself and others realize that I am extremely intelligent and quite capable.  It has helped immensely with actually following through on projects that I start and see them through until they are done in totality.  I follow up on pretty much anything that I put into action or tasks that I have relied on others to complete.  Following up takes a lot of time but makes the end result completed correctly with no ""drama""!  My neurologist_ Dr. Jon Peters in Reston_ VA is my hero.

8, 5, concentration_ memory loss_ anxiety,First of all if you say you hate this drug_ it didnt help you etc.. Then you didnt need it to begin with. I had to go through many tests before I was prescribed. Started at the lowest dosage and moved up from there to find WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR ME. If you aren't ADD then this will be a caffeine pill for you. Be careful who prescribes this to you. I saw a psychiatrist for months of testing before it was confirmed. Sure at first my appetite was off_ but other than that it has changed my life.I reccommend proper testing and diagnosis. If you take this drug to cram for a test or to study it will ruin you. It has increased my cardio while making me focus on the smallest details. Why? Because I truly am ADD. If you have any questions I can answer them all and would be happy to. Mannj0627@gmail.com is how u can reach me. I actually have controlled of my life now. I didnt intend for this to come off as rude but people who dont need this drug abuse it and then bash it online.

(20mg 2xday).,I was recently diagnosed with adult ADD. Initially_ my doctor prescribed me 20mg of Adderall XR to take every morning. I started on a Saturday and noticed that I was very hyper_ talkative_ and thirsty. I did notice that my concentration was much better_ and I was able to focus on tasks without feeling like I needed to take a break. I also felt that way on Sunday. When I was at work on Monday_ I no longer felt those effects or had the ability to focus. After talking with my doctor_ my dose was increased to 40mg a day. I was a little nervous to up my dose by 20mg; I figured that I would be bouncing of the walls on 40mg since I was so hyper on 20mg. The first time I took the higher dose I sat there waiting for my heart to start pounding out of my chest_ but I ended up feeling the exact opposite actually.I have only been taking the 40mg for a few days and I can easily say that this is the calmest I have ever felt in my ENTIRE life. Before taking Adderall my head sounded like 10 overcaffienated women in a small closet_ all taking as loudly as they could about different subjects_ all at the same time (best way I can describe it_ as odd as it sounds). Now my head is quiet. I can work on one task at a time_ and not be distracted about something I have to do the next week. The only downfall of this serenity is that I am really sleepy.

42, 5, ADHD_ DYSLEXIA,My daughter is 14 and started taking this when she was 11_ after failed attempts with other adhd drugs. Adderall was like her saving grace!!! Her grades went from all d's and f's to a's and b's and is in advanced courses. He concentration is 100 percent better and she doesn't have to fidget and talk all the the time in class now. She takes 20 xr in the am and another 5 (not xr) at noon to boost her_ as it does start to wear off. The only side effect noticeable is her loss of appetite. She has lost some weight on it_ however to fine. And she is counter act it_ she does not take it on the weekends_ so she makes up for not eating much all week. Her doc says as long as she is hydrated and eats one really good meal with her multi vitamin she will be fine. And she is. My 7 year old son with ADHD and Autism just started on it a month ago (10 xr 1 x day)_ and he is also benefiting from it. His stimming is less frequent_ and he concentrates better in class. He follows directions a lot better an,Great for people with ADHD_ only drawback is loss of appetite.,F,37,3  years20 + 5 2X D,2/2/2011Email,Adderall xr 10

44, 4, Adult ADD,Occasional headaches.sweating and dizziness (only when does was too high),"AFter reading many posts I see that I in the minority with my postitve results with Adderall XR. HOwever_ I'm obsessed with taking the same dose_ same time everyday_ NEVER MISS.  I started on 20 xr_ caused major sweating_ shakes_ headaches_ very irritable_ then dropped to 15 mg_ same problems.  Dropped to 10 mg/day _ and found the sweet spot.  It works well_ but not a cure.  I would say I have moderate add_ I have friends that are much worse and I know I'm more ""together"" than them.  This drug has helped me finish a task and focus slightly better.  My wife says it's been amazing_ she doesn't have to remind me of everything 50 times a day.  However_ I'm very aware how addicted I've become (physically).  If I miss a pill I have EXTREME fatigue_ the most tired sensation I could ever imagine.  Since I know how bad the withdrawl is_ I haven't missed a pill in years.  Now I'm a father of 2_ 35 years old and feel I must get off since I can't really be on a drug my entire life_ seems too risky.  So I'm going to reduce to 5mg/day (fight through a couple weeks of fatigue_ then I know my body will adjust. I'll stay on 5mg/day for a month or two_ then drop it.  Overall_ I think I was the perfect candidate of this drug since I have no prior-addictive habits_ don't ""like"" drugs_ and I'm very responsible (as much as an ADD person can be ha ha) but I realize everyone is very different and I can see how some people become abusive with this drug_ if you're not very very car",M,35,8  years10 mg xr 1X D,1/17/2011,Adderall xr 10
45, 4, narcolepsy,headaches_ irritability_ gas_ moodiness_ upset stomach_ little nervous at times_ hair loss_ loose stools_ weight loss_ dry mouth_ increased blood pressure_ anxiety worsened_ increased sweating_ and sometimes dizziness,Sad thing is Adderall XR has been the best medication that I have tried for my narcolepsy.  Some of my symptoms are mild others are moderate and so on.  They seem to get a little better with time.  Obviously_ the side effects were not bothersome enough for me to quit taking it_ although I think about it almost daily.

46, 3, Fatigue_ Depression_ ADHD,Anxiety_ Weightloss_ Headache,I finally had to stop taking Adderall because the anxiety crept up on me and incapacitated me. The first 4-5 months were great. Lots of energy_ able to concentrate_ but by month 6 I was having a hard time leaving the house my anxiety was so intense. I also lost about 20 pounds during this time because I wasn't hungry and was so energetic that I didn't make the time to eat.,F,24,7  months30mg 1X D,10/5/2010,Adderall xr 10

GoodSideEffects: The main thing of course is being able to concentrate on one task longer than usual_ I'm NOT experiencing mood swings (THANK GOD)_ I'm not losing weight; which for me being 130 lbs,Last week_ I got some adderall_ I decided to take a pill at 11:45pm_ even though I just finished my liter of MtnDew. The MtnDew seemed to make the adderall way more intense than normal_ idk for sure. But 5-10min after taking the pill_ I had the strong urge to be super talkative_ which isnt me. Soon after_ my hands started to tremble_ but I still was able to play Halo: Reach that night.When I finally went to bed at 3:45am_ all I could do was lay in bed and I never once felt tired nor ever really stopped thinking. While my mind was constantly reeling_ I remembered the times I'd get high before going off bed. I thought about how there are similarities and yet differences between falling asleep with weed or adderall in your system. Starting first with THC_ you definitely can't fall asleep right after getting high because your mind reels with random and unique thoughts_ kind of like adderall_ except your thoughts arent random or unique. Roughly 30-60 mins after laying down after toking up you should be able to fall asleep_ except when you fall asleep high_ maybe its just me_ you dont dream. With adderall_ my mind might also be buzzing like when it is on weed_ but my mind was always focused on one thing/idea and I never felt tired enough to fall asleep. So_ back to my first adderall night_ all I could really do was talk to myself (I am up at college and I couldnt really talk to my sleeping roommate.

49, 1, my 8 y/o son,Severe aggression_ weight loss_ depression_,My 8 year old son was prescribed this drug 14 months ago and everyday I watch the glow in his eyes fade away. He would normally go outside and play with his friends and siblings...now I just watch him sit around and crave sugar all day. Now he would be active sometimes...depends on the hour of the day. He's awoke all night_ very tired in the morning...always moody and loses more weight than I gain.

50, 5, ADHD,Terrible fatigue if I go off it for a few days. When I first started taking it_ or when I take it after days of not taking any pills_ I get very hyper_ ready to just go-go-go-go with so much energy I could run a marathon and not break a sweat. Along with that_ I get very edgy_ often to the point of rage. I now take it regularly (every week day) and I don't have that issue anymore. The only issues I have now are dry mouth/extreme thirst and increased urination due to drinking so much. I also chew the inside of my jaw and it's quite annoying because I don't realise I'm doing it unless I catch myself. The side effects are minor and at least for me_ the benefits/pros FAR outweigh the cons.,"I have very severe ADHD and this is the only thing I have ever tried that has helped. I've tried ALL the study techniques that I could find_ all the time management techniques_ work methods_ etc. and Ritalin_ which messed me up so bad I lost memory of the years I was on it. Adderall XR not only wakes me up and gives me energy_ it helps me focus. My attention span has gone from 10 seconds to potentially hours. It doesn't make me lose weight or sleep...in fact_ I can nap quite well with it and sleep through the night and not have to worry about my ribs showing because I can still eat a ton. People take for granted the ability to sit down and focus on a task for any period of time and the ability to start something and actually finish it. It's not a ""miracle"" drug because it doesn't make me want to do it or motivate me in any way_ but I do get it done when I need to. I also suffer from low BP so this drug's ""side effect"" of making your blood pressure increase has actually been a benefit to me because my normal 81/53 blood pressure will usually become a normal or near-normal BP when I take the pill.",F,22,5  months30 MG 1X D,8/19/2010Email,Adderall xr 10
51, 3, FM/ CFS,headaches_ feeling jittery_ burning out,When I started taking Adderall I thought it was the greatest drug EVER. Initially_ I started taking 15mg in the morning after breakfast. It would make me very focused_ very creative_ and very calm. I thought it was amazing_ despite the headaches I had on some days. On the weekends I didn't take it because I was afraid of getting too dependant of it. Now_ after 3 months of taking 20mg twice a day_ I am ready to quit. The calm_ focused feeling I don't get anymore; I only felt like using Nitrox in a car that was otherwise a wreck... The Adderall pushed me although my body was already burned out. I would feel extremely drained and exhausted every single day. I switched to Nuvigil which doesn't give me the highs but makes me feel like myself again...

Like I could grip my thoughts and use them_ not watch them for a split second before they went away.,I would never recommend it. It was a mistake for it to ever be put out there... I'm aware of all the dangers it's causing to me_ but I can't stop because I know I need it and I feel like without it I won't amount to anything. Ever since taking this I've gotten straight A's and had perfect attendance_ for now three full years_ but it does something. I feel locked inside myself when I'm on it. If I get sad for one moment_ it really speeds that up and I'll feel almost suicidal over the tiniest things_ or extremely excited about stupid things I hardly care about. It changed me from the irritating loud mouth to the kid in the corner who doesn't talk to anyone. It makes me second guess myself and just doubt. I'm starting to think it's the adderall_ but after always being a very sweet guy_ I've slowly felt myself turning into something else_ like a complete asshole. I feel very prude_ and would honestly call/consider a girl if she's kissed somebody. I can't eat on it_ I just don't want to_ I have lethargy. I'm right now doing this when I've told myself to get up and learn a song I have to perform for graduation tomorrow for the past 2 hours and I still am too focused to get up_ I just want to keep doing something_ I don't want that three seconds of getting up to find my guitar to end the streak_ it has to be constant.

55, 4, ADD/ADHD,Generally no appetite_ have lost 30 pounds since December 2009.  Increase in pulse and blood pressure_ headache_ and nausea.,Overall it's worked pretty well for me_ I can usually concentrate better than I was able to without taking adderall XR.  Occasionally I do get stuck on words when I can't think of what I'm trying to say_ and I can't really break the concentration that's on trying to remember the word.  I have tachycardia_ but adderall xr doesn't always increase my pulse_ when it does though_ it's not by much. (the highest pulse I've noticed when doing nothing has been 170_ but my pulse usually is between 120-135)  As for the increase in blood pressure_ that's actually been a big change since my BP was normally a perfect 120/80_ whereas now it can range from normal to pretty high.  (the highest I've noticed being 179/119).  I'm really happy with my appetite being almost completely diminished.  It's definitely helped me control my calorie intake_ and I've lost 30 pounds in 5 months.,F,21,5  months30MG 1X D,5/4/2010Email,Adderall xr 10

The GOOD: Great focus_ confidence_ i do things more easily_ and without too much thinking and hesitation as I used to.",I never really believed in psychiatry and almost gave up on my inability to achieve anything in life_ until i seeked help and was started on Addreall. Over all_ this drug has helped me tremendously and has had a positive effect on my life. I'm now able to multi task_ not as easily distracted_ and have more confidence in my self. found that the lack of sleep can be overcome by taking your dosage very early in the morning_ although you'd have to train yourself to sleep when u really don't feel like it. I didn't find it addictive as some claim; but I do believe that it has a negative impact on the heart. I used to be regular jogger and now find it pretty difficult to run a small 5k_ and sometimes find myself fatigued with no reason. Mind you I've been inactive for the last two years.
