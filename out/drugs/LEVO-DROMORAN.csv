0, 5, Cluster/migrain  neuropathic pain,none,I have used over 4000 doses of levorphanol in 27 years with out any problems. Usually 3 to 4 mg in one day as needed but not every day. Six months ago they were taken away and I was given drugs for treating Neuropathy. None of them work. So now I burn 24-7.
