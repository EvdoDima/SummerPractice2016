0, 5, Migraines,Occasional drowsiness_ possible rebound headaches.,If I take 2 at the start of a headache it goes away within 15 minutes. If taken while headache is full blown_ I'll take 3 and it still works wonders. I do think I get rebound headaches but I have a headache everyday anyways so it's hard to tell.,F,23,1  years,2/2/2016Email,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
1, 5, migranes,very mild relaxed feeling_ nothing else.,This has been a great drug for my occasional migranes triggered by food/ drink_ or stress. I take 3 pills one time to wipe out a headache that would otherwise ruin my entire day. For bad headaches_ can add aspirin or advil to boost effect.,M,59,10  years 1X D,5/22/2015,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
2, 4, Chronic tension headaches,"This is a very ""clean"" drug fro me. I have experienced minimal side effects. Sometimes it makes me drowsy_ if my headache is pretty bad.","It is the only drug that will decrease the intensity of my headaches. Although this drug has been associated with rebound headaches_ I have not had this problem. Neither have I had a tolerance problem. I pretty much take the same dosage as I have been taking for the past nine years. However_ I do not have what I call an ""addictive"" personality. I have never been drunk before; the only time that I tried I got sick and vomited. I never experimented with illegal recreational drugs_ thus I have never been ""high"". Maybe this is why I have not had problems with drug tolerance or rebound headaches.",M,58,9  years2 x 50 mg 3X D,1/9/2014Email,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
3, 1, Migraine,No side effects... it just didn't have any effect on my type of migraine.,,F,47,3  days,7/1/2012,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
4, 5, Stress and pre-migraine headaches,Initially just mildly spacey but now I am very used to them and can take them and drive and work. I often feel they make more alert and clear headed  and able to think once I got used to them.,This is a very effective drug for alot of different kinds of headaches. Stress headaches and great for heading off a migraine but_ I find only Imitrex works for completely nailing a migraine.,F,56,15  years,7/18/2009Email,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
5, 5, migraines,maybe a jolt of energy...if i take two,def works wonders! saves me trips to the ER. i take on the onset of any tension headache or migraine and it's gone! nice...,F,37,7  years,6/14/2009Email,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
6, 5, migraines,Some hyperness_ insomnia. Sandoz brand had less side effects and 30 to 50% more effective than generic; Watson brand name and generic is lousy_ more stomach pain and constipation.  Also take the fioricet and fiorinal with codeine which always works.,Been taking fiorinal 3 for 23 yearss_ 30 to 50 per month the first 13 years.  I have migraines that last 10 days/24 hours_ used to have to stay in bed in pain with aspirin poisoning on top of the migraine nausea.  Ulcers now require Fioricet instead of Fiorinal (aspirin) - unfortunately tylenol doesn't work for me for pain or fever_ so I need the codeine in Fioricet #3.  Some rebound headache_ but if taking lots of vicodin or percocet for my ruptured discs I can go 10 days without needing a fioricet without dependency or withdrawal syptoms.  Vicodin_ Fentynl_ dilaudin and oxycontin do NOT work for migraines_ only Fiorinal/Fioricet #3.  Degerateive discs in my neck cause constant headaches_ 24/7 for last 10 years_  the worst pain upon waking up. Fioricet #3 usually works for this also_ neck pain headaches in last 10 years will respond to large doses of the other opiates_ but migraines do not.  Migraines from weather fronts_ smells_ some foods_ flourescent lighting flicker_ computer moni,F,56,23  years,2/19/2009,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
7, 5, Headaches,The only medication that kills my headaches every time I use it_ about once a week. Even strong opiates do not eliminate my headaches_ but butalbital is very effective.,Excellent medication with no side effects for me.,M,68,900  days,1/16/2009,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
8, 5, headaches,no negative side effects.,"Although I've had bad headaches (tension_ migraines_ etc...) most of my life_ I started taking this drug following a severe closed head injury.  I have always believed that self medicating should be avoided if possible.  I don't want to feel like I need to be ""medicated"" to deal with life.  That being said_ I also think if you find something that works as well as this medication does for otherwise debilitating headaches_ you should take advantage of it and stop suffering.  This is by far the most effective headache medicine I've ever taken (I've tried too many others to list).  I take one or two tablets when I feel the headache increasing and can tell it's about take control and there would be nothing I could do to stop it.  Before this drug_ my headaches would take me out of commission for days at a time.  Now I can nip them in the bud before they get the best of me.  Washing them down with a caffeinated beverage helps even more (and I'm not normally a caffeine drinker).",F,33,9  years,6/6/2008,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
9, 5, The pill,sleepy_ relaxed,I have been suffering from severe headeaches for about a year due to Yazmin. Like clockwork I experience a headache 3 days after I end a pack and the day I start a new one. My doctor says its due to the drop/change in hormones. (This month I am switching to Yaz which has a lower dosage.) I am unable to take ibuprophin anymore due to an ulcer.He advised me I could get addicted and I need to only take when the headache won't go away after trying other things. (Drinking water_ hot shower_ shoulder massage_ etc)I woke up with a headache and came home today in absolute agony and after 2 showers decided I couldn't handle it anymore. I took 1 pill and within 10 minutes I was experiencing a huge relief. Within 30 minutes the headache was gone. This stuff is great!,F,36,2  days,2/28/2008,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
10, 5, Migraines,Dry mouth and euphoric fealing,Ive tried every migrane med you can pronounce...this is by far the most effective at treating my pain.  Careful...this drug makes you feel good and you want to take more.  Can be habit forming.  I take as needed and works wonders for my pain and makes me feel good at the same time,M,35,2  years,1/1/2008,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
11, 4, years of severe migraine,constipation_ dizziness_ drowsiness,Acetaminophen doesn't do anything for me_ in any form_ nor did Imitrex (despite hideous side effects).  This works well enough that if I use half a pill within a few hours of a migraine starting it can knock it back to a mere headache.  However_ nothing works after the aura starts.  Like all painkillers used for migraine (including OTC remedies)_ use sparingly to avoid the vicious cycle of rebound headaches. The only way to cure those is to use NOTHING AT ALL for a full month_ then start with very small and sparing dosages of OTC remedies.I've used this for a few years_ limiting monthly use to 2-3 at most no matter how bad or frequent my migraines because I don't want to have to do the above detox ever again!!,F,41,3  years,10/1/2007,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
12, 5, migraine headaches,Rarely_ if I haven't eaten_ heartburn.,This is the only painkiller that has been effective for my migraines_ and I haven't found it habit-forming_ but then I *only* take it when I have a migraine.  Works better_ of course_ the sooner you take it.  Migraine preventatives_ such as Wygrain (sp?) worked a for a while for me (say_ two or three months)_ but usually resulted in a more severe migraine when it finally arrived_ so I have found this to be a better fit for me.  The time refers to how long I have been taking it_ but NOT continuously_ only as needed.,F,56,43  years,7/19/2006,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
13, 5, severe tension headaches,No side effects,"Love this drug!  Have tension headaches that proceed to migraines if not stopped.  This med stops my headaches and has helped me stay at work and functional.  I do not notice any sleepiness or ""buzz"" from it at all.  I am completely functional_ which is so much better than the other meds which made me incapable of working.",F,44,1  years,1/17/2006,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
14, 2, migraines,sleepyness_ vomiting_ dizzyness,I started taking for migraines (which I have suffered from for 12 years) The first 4 worked well but the 5th didn't work and I had to go through a lot of paper work b/c I failed a drug test for work b/c of butalbital. On the 6th pill I took for instant migrain_ it did not work it made me even worse_ I vomitted for hours before my boyfriend finally took me to the E.R. where the doctor treated me and told me never to take it again!,F,20,4  months,5/26/2005,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"

17, 5, migraines,I havn't experienced any side affects that were noticable after taking 43 pills over the course of about a year. However now that I know they are addictive I will be taking them fewer and farther between.,Great migraine stopper. Cured the worst migraine I have ever had in 15 minutes flat.,M,15,1  years,1/2/2003,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
18, 5, migraines,was not told and did not realize it was addictive.  Because of this_ I got rebound headaches EVERY DAY.  I would be totally out of commission day after day.,Use only if headache gets ahead of you before you can take something else that works at the onset of headache.  If possible_ use something else.,F,60,  years,3/16/2001,"Butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine"
