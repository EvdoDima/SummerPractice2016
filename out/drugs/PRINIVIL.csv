0, 1, To lower my blood pressure.,This is my 2nd review. It has been 3.5 weeks since I went off lisinopril. Horrible going off this medication for me. I have recently  been waking up with mild chest pains. Yesterday and today they were real bad. I almost went to the emergency room. I don't think I would be having these pains if I never went on and then went off lisinopril. My BP is around 155 over 105 which is not anything that would cause chest pains. Has anyone else here had mild chest pains after going off this medicine? I have never had chest pains before going on any BP medicines. I will be really upset if this medicine cause this.,,M,48,3  months10 mg,4/24/2016Email,Prinivil
1, 2, To lower my blood pressure.,I got the cough for about a month.  So out of three months of taking it_ the cough happened in the middle month. It was really annoying but it went away. Peeing in the night was still there but not too bad. My penis will never be the same if I am on these blood pressure pills. Erections are not as hard when on this stuff. And I don't think my ejaculations are as strong. I never needed Viagra and I certainly don't wanna take another medication because of the side effects of Lisinopril. I am divorced and just looking to date now. I really don't wanna be worried about erections being there or not. What kind of 1st impression would that make. It is amazing. As soon as you stop taking the blood pressure medication_ your erections come back stronger than ever. So there is definitely that wonderful side effect.,At first this medicine did lower my blood pressure. BUT after a while it seems that my BP creeps up and the medicine is no longer effective any more. So why take a medicine that I am not responding to. I told my Primary physician that I am concerned about long term effects to kidneys_ liver_ and thyroid and they said that is why we test your blood to make sure that the medicine is not effecting them. Sorry but that does not sit well with me. I am not a lab rat. I know high BP is not something to be taken lightly but mine is not that high. I think I really have to lose weight and exercise and I will be fine. I just went off this drug...hate the withdrawals. You feel wierd. Your chest is like tight feeling. You feel like ur getting a headache. My ear hurt. I should have weeNed off it better. I stopped too abruptly. I was gonna renew but I am out of refills. They don't let u get more refills because the wanna see you and run blood tests aND maybe increase the dosage (which I will not allow). I wish there was a safe blood pressure drug.,M,48,3  months10 mg,4/3/2016Email,Prinivil

3, 2, HBP,Stomach Spasms_ Nausea_ Muscle Aches_ Headaches,Started this drug at 20mg a day after not tolerating another ACE drug Perindopril and an allergic reaction to the next drug I tried Olmesartan. Have to say it did bring down my pressure but the side effects were not great for me. So dose was cut to 10mg a day_ still the same and still worked at controlling the pressure. Then cut it down to 5mg a day and stayed on this dose for 2 weeks_ it still controlled my pressure ok_ but when I started getting incredible pain in both forearms and couldn't move them without pain in the wrists I discontinued and the muscle aches etc disappeared. I've now been put on 150mg of Avapro_ so I'll see what happens with this one. Blood pressure pills_ worse than the problem sometimes!,M,64,6  weeks 1X D,2/5/2016,Prinivil
4, 1, Type 1 Diabetes/kidney protection,Severe Angioedema of my face especially my lips. Given for kidney protection as I have severe type 1 Diabetes secondary to Total Pancrectomy with Whipple surgery 3/14. Immediately after my huge surgery my urine output decreased with beginnings of hypertension so my Dr. explained he felt it was a good idea. I had horrible dryness in my throat the first week then it subsided and controlled the HTN up until the 6th wk when I had immediate swelling of my nose and lips. Very scary!!  We switched to Cozaar and it isn't as good but I have less side effects at this time.,I've been trying to see if I need to alert this manufacture of my SE. There have been a few reported deaths from airway closure. I think it's benefit to some must outweigh the few deaths. After my reaction my friend found herself also with angioedema and knew immediately what it was!!  Happens a lot more than the companies want doctors to know.

5, 1, High blood pressure,Within an hour after taking this medication (and I am not even exaggerating) I began to feel very light headed and just plain strange. My chest was very tight and I developed a horrible cough immediately that kept me up ALL night long! It was miserable! After spending the entire night coughing_ I had to be to work @ 7am the next day - and I work in a NICU_ so coughing and hacking all day did not go over well. I was miserable. Called dr and asked to be taken off of it immediately. She said to discontinue taking it and prescribed Losartan_ so I guess I'll see how that goes. My cough was gone the very next day.,Maybe this works for some_ but that was the worst cough I've ever had. Very dry cough that would strike me randomly throughout the day and I would end up in an embarrassing coughing fit that I could not stop.

6, 3, BP control/protect kidneys for diab,I ended up in the ER and admitted to the hospital after taking this for 4 yrs. I had swollen face and mouth and couldn't swallow.

Aside from that experience I had no trouble..but beware a severe adverse reaction of this drug is angioedema.,I can never take ace inhibitor again.

9, 1, hypertension,My mother_ my significant other_ one of my best friends ALL hallucinated on lisinopril.,"My significant other was locked up and drugged to death by psychiatrists who never took him slowly off the drug for a proper diagnosis.  He was given 10 to 13 drugss per day with sudden changes until he died. I was able with doctor in agreement to take my mother slowly off that drug and she quit hallucinating.  My friend went ""off the deep end"" psychologically before she died but had other major medical problems.  I have a book that indicates that up to 6% of the patients taking ace inhibitors can have symptoms such as hallucinations.  Most patients may not have this problem but I believe that results in the doctors not being aware when the connection for some patients does develop.  If you have advanced age they will assume you have dementia and not see if it may be lisinopril or another drug causing the problems.  Psychosis a definite possible risk.",F,70,  1X D,6/28/2013Email,Prinivil

Went to Dr. - left lung full of fluid - I had been taking the Lisinopril for 5 months and advised both the GP and the ""pulmonary specialist"" of this - only other med was Lipitor which I started at the same time.  After having the fluid removed and all tests - blood_ fluid_ chest xray_ ct scan etc coming back negative the ""specialist"" advised me to wait 6 weeks for another xray to see if the fluid returned.  When I started experiencing the same symptoms I googled Lisinopril and Lung Fluid/Pleural Effusion and surprise - there it was - confirmed same with the pharmacist who printed out the list of adverse effects that included edema and pleural effusion.  The ""specialist"" advised me the he couldn' find anything on this subject.  I took myself off of the meds a month ago and altho I am feeling better I am still feeling",I do not understand why the Drs do not have a standard protocol to check symptoms agains adverse reactions to meds that have been prescribed to patients.

Pain resolved after switching back to my prior medication.,No other side effects and until the abdominal pain started_ I was pleased with the medication.  The abdominal pain was so intense that I thought I might have appedicitis.  Called my MD and they recommended I switch back to my prior prescription but they doubted that the medication was the cause and that I would likely need to be seen in office in the next day or so_ or the ER_ (this occurred over a weekend) if the pain continued to worsen.  Pain was so extreme that hydrocodone did not alleviate it.  Only felt better lying still on my back and waiting for medication to wear off as next dosing time approached.

My left hand which does have arthritis had swollen some with Crestor_ but with Lisinopril it has swelled so hugely I often cannot come close to making a fist with it.  It has been extremely painful and worrisome.  Because I have arthritis anyway it was a little hard to realize what was happening.  I have also been dieting (not perfectly but I have been eating much better in general) and... gained weight.  There has been a disgusting increase in my gag reflex_ so much that it is becoming hard to swallow pills or brush my teeth.  And a gagging cough will strike from nowhere to make me wonder if this is the time I will vomit with it  embarrassing_ to say the least.  Because the Crestor had already done me ill_ it's hard to say how much more of this is due to the Lisinopril_ but enough definitely is that I am confident I do NOT want to take this drug.

I had no idea what was going on and went to a walk-in clinic near work and got antibiotics and cough meds.  Nothing helped.  Would wake up at night choking and gagging...coughing until I vomited.  I couldn't breathe.  Had muscle pain and my chest was hurting so bad from coughing.  The coughing made no sense.  I had no fever_ no anything but a horrible cough that would come in fits.

Lisinopril did a great job on my blood pressure and is dirt cheap_ so I was sorry it didn't work for me.
