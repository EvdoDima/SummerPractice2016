0, 4, Depression,Dry Mouth_ elevated pulse_ fatigue at first_ sexual side effects.,This was a pretty good antidepressant for me. Only persistent side effect was extreme dry mouth. I had to quit because my tonsils started swelling and I had other mouth problems. Actually improved my cognitive impairment_ and started working very quickly. Got up to 75mg in less than a week and stayed at that dosage until I had to quit. Bear in mind this drug is metabolised to Desipramine_ a very strong NRI. It will take 2-3 weeks to clear your system.,M,33,5  weeks75mg 1X D,1/25/2016,Tofranil
1, 4, Depression_ anxiety_ panic attacks,Dry mouth..some weight gain..,"I've been on imipramine (generic for tofranil)for over 22 years.. Works better than other older meds! I also have OCD and panic attacks.. It has not helped much with OCD and I'm now trying to find a drug that will let me take lower doses of tofranil and add Luvox to the mix..for OCD... IM ON A HIGH DOSE....200 mg just be sure to have your blood panel every year to monitor the kidneys and liver! I'm an extreme case of depression and am afraid to take anything new for fear of it killing me or making me have high anxiety.. Tofranil doesn't take all the anxiety and that's why I was on klonopin! But now_ no other meds are used! I am afraid to try something new_ this has helped me to feel ""real"" for years!! Trust it_ I did!!!!",F,59,10  years200,1/5/2016,Tofranil

3, 2, panic attacks,periods of severe insomnia_ agitation_ anxiety_ obsessing on trivial things_ urinary retention,I took this 18 years ago for a month or two for panic attacks and tapered off with no problems.

9, 2, anxiety_ depression_ insomnia,125 mg at night: dry mouth_ mild weight gain (8 lbs)_ dizziness on standing_ cravings for sweets_ headaches_ very tough to stop taking this med.,I switched to this med for 5 years because it was only one of 2 antidepressants offered at my college health center. Previously_ I took desipramine for 1 month_ which was much more effective. Because I did not know much about antidepressants meds back then_ I was not aware of just how great the difference was between these two meds.Tofranil helped me sleep somewhat. It also helped me concentrate and focus_ and it reduced my anxiety_ but not by much.  My sex drive was fine_ I had NO sexual side effects at all_ nor did I have any memory loss that I was aware of. I have tried 3 tricylics and had no sexual side effects on any of them - so take note that not everyone has that side effect!BUT_ after 2 years of taking tofr._ it activated restless legs syndrome_ which continued until I stopped the med. I also got headaches. Stopping it was extremely difficult_ I had flu like symptoms and went through a very tough withdrawal. This drove me nuts_ as I felt like i could not stop these meds.,F,27,5  years,4/1/2007,Tofranil
