2, 4, migraines,I took this for migraines and later found it helped with palpitations_ too.  I didn't realize this caused dehydration - until I saw reviews - which I've had almost as long as I've taken this drug.  I worried it might be diabetes_ which tests always came up negative.  My doctor never suggested it was the Inderal.  Hmm.  The other side effect is impotence_ total lack of interest_ which really didn't start until my early 50's.,It definitely helped my migraines_ which were severe.  The last 10 years_ I've only had 2 when I missed a dose of Inderal.,F,63,22  years60 mg. 1X D,12/12/2014,Inderal la

6, 3, Migraine,Weight gain_ insomnia_ dreams_ tiredness_ dizzy spells_ lack of concentration.,I think it has helped in the fact that most times pain killers will now have some effect on my migraine where they were having none_ but I now cannot sleep at all without sleeping tablets. I still have chronic migraine everyday of my life so I am now considering not taking it anymore as the weight gain is so depressing. I am going to look for another solution_ the side effects are just too high a price to pay for the minimal benefit.,F,55,365  days80mg 1X D,9/26/2013Email,Inderal la
7, 3, Migraines,Excessive weight gain_ fatigue_ dizziness_ feeling feint_ pins and needles in hands,In the two years I have taken Inderal I have gained 3 stone.  I have tried every diet and I excercise a lot.  The weight gain has really got me down because I was always skinny before this even after having a child.  I was diagnosed with acute migraines by a neurologist and put on the tablets and I have not had an aura migraine since_ however_ I have had a lot of migraines where I am sick and see wavy lines regularly.  No doctor seemed to want to admit that inderal was the cause for the weight gain but finally I saw one last week who is going to prescribe me an alternative. The fatigue is also a nightmare if you lead a busy life.  I would advise anyone who is thinking about taking these tablets to take the side effects into account as they really have made my life miserable and it has taken me nearly a year to get a doctor to listen to me!,F,26,2  days80 1X D,10/14/2012Email,Inderal la

9, 3, Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia,I did not notice it initially_ but looking back_ this drug has made it impossible to lose weight.,I used to take this for migraine headaches from the age of 5 to 17 when they calmed down.  Then in my late 20's I was diagnosed with Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia.  I started the drug to slow my heart down so it wasn't always racing.  I learned that it is a non-selective beta blocker and inhibits the ability for you to burn fat.  I gained 30 pounds and I can't even lose 10 on this drug. I tried every diet and I have NEVER been overweight.  I asked my cardiologist to take me off it.  I am now weaning off at half the dosage.  Hopefully the heart rate issue is gone_ because I have tried everything to lose weight.  I eat healthy_ work out 6 days a week for an hour and the weight should be coming off. I'm only 30 years old!,F,30,3  years80 1X D,9/13/2012Email,Inderal la
10, 4, Hyperhidrosis,Have to say this drug saved me_ my condition was literally ruining me life_ I merely existed if you get me. Side effects are complete lack of energy which I'm hoping will pass in time and bowels a bit ropey as in on a vacation and need to get back to work!!! The key with this drug is taken it on an empty stomach I was taken it for 2wks before I coped this. I take 160mg about 7am back to bed for 40 winks and then get up 8.30 shower and brekkie and off for the day_ I hope everyone with the condition finds a solution that works for them it's a hideous life crippling thing that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy,,F,27,6  weeks160mg,5/31/2012Email,Inderal la
11, 3, Hypertension_ tachacardia,"SEVERE windedness. Couldn't get off the couch without breathing heavy. Complete lack of appetite. Vision ""weirdness"". Nervousness in the mornings. Feelings of chest ""congestion"" ""pressure"" resulting in claustrophobia. Discouragement. Diarrhea. Skin on trunk became scaly and flaky_ elbows cracked and peeled.

12, 5, Migraines and Daily Headaches,A little tired and trouble staying asleep at night.,This drug changed my life. It took about two weeks to work_ but then it greatly reduced my migraines. I  was having headaches about 5 days a week and now every once in awhile.,F,39,3  weeks60mg 1X D,12/6/2011,Inderal la
13, 4, Migraine,For the first 6 weeks_ I was extremely tired_ had very little energy and felt faint but was able to combat this by eating little and oftern in order to prevent my blood sugar levels from dropping and by taking the tablets at bedtime.  After the 6 weeks_ this has gone but since then I have found excercising more difficult (I can still do high impact aerobics but just find it more difficult-almost as if I am doing it with weights strapped to me) and find that I pump more_ paticularly just after taking my tablets.  The migraines are now under control and I am hoping that I can start to reduce my dose and come off inderal in the near future.,Before taking inderal_ I suffered mild migraines which lasted on average 5 days at a time. Since taking inderal and giving my body 6 weeks to get used to it_ I have had a hadful of migraines lasting 1-3 days and they are very mild to the extent that I can get away with just taking ibuprofen and I am fine. I also came off the pill and think any woman suffering from migraines should look at non-hormal contraception (I got the coil which while it was sore getting fitted_ I feel so much better since coming off the pill and think that this was the cause of my migraines). I would definately recommond inderal to migrain sufferers but would advise taking it easy for the first 6 weeks to allow your body time to get used to it.,F,26,6  months80mg 1X D,2/4/2011,Inderal la
14, 3, Severe Hyperthyroidism,"No problems with weight gain_ which is good_ but the cold legs (like frozen sides of beef up to mid-thigh) and hands - I felt I had to half the dose to get rid of those symptoms_ but I STILL have cold hands and cold feet_ just not cold LEGS.  Lethargy_ ""kind of"" depression - I am just...  indifferent to EVERYTHING - I don't care...  about anything...  Painful to walk due to frozen feet - they feel swollen when I wake up...  No additional sleep problems_ but I was already on temazepam for my long term insomnia...  I haven't had a dream in EONS_ fantastic_ scary_ intense or otherwise...  :(",It definitely helped my heart palps and flutters_ and the craziness of severe hyperthyroidism_ but the icy hands and legs has become intolerable (walking is painful and awkward...)  and so is my indifference to everything...  and I HATE not dreaming..  oh_ and it never did get rid of the mild daily headaches I get_ either... altho' I didn't have a problem with that as far as I'm concerned.

15, 5, Migraine,Vivid Dreams,Ever had a drug that changed your life? Well this certainly was a game changer for me! I wonder why I suffered for years before any Dr. thought to prescribe this for me..such a shame they hadn't done it sooner! Initially the drug made me VERY VERY tired (at probably the time in my life when I needed the most not to be any more severely exhausted than I was as a mother who works full-time and had an 8 month old and a 4 year old!) My Doctor told me to stick it out for six whole weeks and that I wouldn't be dissapointed...Those 6 weeks were really rough (and it was the full 6 weeks_ I tell ya!) and I so wanted to give up_ but I am sooooo glad I stuck it out! All of you people who give up on it after a short time...I'm here to tell you_ don't. The Dr.'s goal was to eliminate my migraines completely. While I can't say it has eliminated them_ it has hands down reduced the severity of my migraines and eliminated the naseau that I had along with it and for that alone I am greatful. I no longer live my life fearing the next migraine or cutting short a vacation in the middle of the night to go home because of a dibilitating migraine attack. So_ please give it a chance. Stick it out for a whole six weeks_ if at the end of six weeks you still don't like it_ then stop. But I'll bet you'll probably be thanking me_ instead. :),F,38,5  years160 MG 1X D,7/26/2010Email,Inderal la

18, 5, Chronic Migraine,Feeling more calm_ slightly harder to do cardio workout_ vivid funny dreams - overall negligible!,I have not had a headache for 1 week straight. This is a miracle as I am used to 2 or 3 per week. I even enjoyed a glass of RED wine and was fine. WOW that is like a another miracle. Sleep has been fine as long as I stay on my regular schedule_ which is what I find to be key to anybody's good night's sleep. As per the weight gain_ I have not had any. As a fitness nutritionist and fitness instructor I believe that if you eat calories according to your BMR and work out regularly including cardio 3-4 times a week you should not have too many problems with weight gain_ no matter what drug your on. If you are still gaining weight drop the calories! We will see how the long term effects are of Inderal LD 80mg (generic)_ but so far it has given me a better quality of life.,F,30,21  days80mg/LA 1X D,7/13/2010,Inderal la

I was supposed to be taking a higher dose (140mg per day) but I felt too tired on a low dose and thought I couldn't function to go to work etc on a higher dose. The flatulence became socially crippling and I stopped the Inderal cold turkey about three weeks ago. Although I have had the flu_ I have also had shocking_ bursting headaches at night and have to sleep upright_ intense fatigue during the day_ emotionally labile and nauseous.  The gas has stopped (hurrah!!)  but the aftermath is making me feel totally despondent!,While on the Inderal_ I did not notice a reduction in frequency of my migraine but there was lessening of their intensity.

Have been eating a lot more sugary foods than usual - cravings possibly due to lack of energy caused by drug?,Suffered from panic attacks for a few months_ the physical symptoms of which were shaking_ throat swelling causing inablitity to breathe_ sweating and headaches. I have been on the drug for eight days 80mg dose per day_ It does stop the physical symptoms of panic attacks but I have no energy whatsoever_ feel very depressed and can't concentrate. I need to find an alternative as I can barely get through the day in college.

27, 1, Migraines/MAV/High Blood Pressure,Didn't lower heart-rate as much as other beta blockers have; light headed upon standing; shortness of breath with any amount of exertion (more pronounced than with other beta blockers I've tried); extreme moodiess/sadness/depression/anxiety.,I wrote a similar review for Inderal...I also tried the LA version (since my headaches returned 3-4 hours after a dose of regular Inderal...apparently it has a very short half life).  Background: I've suffered from migraines and high BP for years.  Migraines & BP were previously under control with 50 mg of Atenolol once per day (took this for a year).  6 months ago_ had sudden dizziness and worsening migraines.  Numerous tests have concluded it's MAV (migraine associated vertigo)_ and I have been working from home for the past 6 months because I can't drive due to the dizziness. I tried Inderal LA after having some initial success with regular Inderal for a few weeks.  I took it for 2 days_ and was honestly afraid that I would hurt myself - I became so sad and depressed...like I would be cooking dinner or cleaning the house_ and I would suddenly burst into random tears for NO REASON WHATSOEVER.  Granted_ I'm a little down due to the MAV and headaches_ but I've never felt so hopeless and depressed in my life...ever.  It scared the hell out of me_ and I quit taking this drug immediately...I went back to Atenolol (it doesn't control the headaches as well and makes me a bit light-headed) until I find something better_ and I haven't had this happen since.  Many people swear by this drug_ but for me_ it was definitely a bad fit...just goes to show you that drugs affect everyone differently!,F,25,2  days,1/2/2010Email,Inderal la
28, 4, tachycardia,Well..I am not sure but I do have dry eyes and mouth and fatigue. Not sure if this all related to Inderal. When I was in the hospital in Sept. 09 they said my BP was too low and they lowered my dose from 120 mg to 80 mg,I have only had one episode since on it that landed me in the hospital and I attribute that to the FLU and being dehydrated.

No more shaking_ sweating etc just leaving me to concentrate on delivery. I started on 80mg about 1 hour before needed_ but quickly moved up to 2x80mg (taken slightly apart). Perhaps this was unnecessary_ but I originally felt one was not enough. Anyway_ the ""build up"" dread about a meeting has now gone (this was sometimes 2 weeks BEFORE the presentation!!)_ and I may only get slightly nervous 10mins before speaking. Once I get going I generally can deliver (what seems to other people) to be a confident_ self assured speech. I do worry about the long term side effects though and aim to reduce my dose soon.

Confused at times over simple things _ NO sexual desire at all_ awaken by panic attacks_ Trouble falling asleep_ I feel very sleepy and tired and then cannot go to sleep. I have gained about 30 pounds since starting this medication in 2001. Some shortness of breath.,Inderal LA 120 definately took care of the rapid heart rate. At resting rate I was around 120-130 BPM_ I felt like I was having a heart attack my heart would pound so hard. My chest just felt very weird and heavy feeling. I now stay around 80 BMP.

You need to do it very slow as it can cause stress on your heart. I tried to get to 60mg and was unable_ the miagraines wouldn't stop. I did however get to 80 mg which made me feel better and my miagraines were better. The last year my headaches have returned and sometimes miagraines that I have put my dose up to 120mg. I'm use to it now but still having headaches. I'm now searching for another drug to add to the inderal. If any one is on Inderal LA for a number of years be carefull trying to come off of it.
