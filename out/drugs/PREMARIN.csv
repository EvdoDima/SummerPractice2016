That one worries me but I seem to need it in order not to build up the endometrial lining.,First took .625 which I cut into pieces so it was about a 3/4 pill I was taking.  Maybe 7 or 8 years later went to the .3 dose.  Have been taking that for the rest of those 20 years worth.  I LOVE IT.  Only side effect is thinning hair_ but maybe that's from the Provera I take 12 days a month.  ??  I've tried a time or two to do without Premarin but life wasn't worth living.

After 5 years my GP put me on 0.625mg of Premarin (side effects of changing were very bad).  After these had settled I got on very well will Premarin_ but had doseage cut to 0.3mg 2 years ago by my GP who wants me to come off soon.  When reducing I just went from one day using 0.625mg to 0.3mg the next I had side effects of hair loss_ mouth ulcers (still get issues with my gums & ulcers)_ hair is thinner than it was but it has stopped shedding so much now.  I am about to have my first mammogram and if all well the GP will let me stay on them.  Interesting to see others have been on them for 20odd years I'm hoping I will be the same.  Am told I look 10 years younger than I am I have a younger husband who is only 44 so Im not keen to stop them as we still have an active sex life.

I also experience frequent headaches lasting 2 to 3 days at a time . my memory became so poor that it has affected my work performance to the point that I can no longer be a productive member of the work team .physically _ my vagina burns _pains and itches almost constantly . my hair is rapidly becoming so thin _ im sure I will be wearing a wig in a few months .never in my life have  I had depression . now _ I not only see nothing wrong with suicide _I now view it as the best possible remedy out of a horrible tortuous situation .,F,67,35  years0.625 mg 1X D,7/23/2015,Premarin
29, 5, Total Hysterectomy at 39,Weight gain. Gained about 30 pounds gradually since surgery.  Levelled off and just bounce up and down 10 or 15 lbs or so at a time.,"Started high dosage 1.25 right after surgery.  Lost insurance a year later and with high prices_ started cutting in half to .625.  Noticed an increase in hot flashes (never completely without the flashes).  Prices kept going up_ so I tried to stop one Summer about 4 years ago.  It was awful_ I really can't even remember that whole Summer.  Hot flashes/night sweats were almost unbearable lasting days and days at a time.  Memory got so much worse_ I truly though I was losing my mind.  Mood swings were very noticeable by others.  Leg pain and just a general tired and down feeling (depression I guess).  Insomnia was somehow the worst symptom_ probably because I have never had any problem with sleeping.  I know ""back in the day"" that menopause was considered a sickness for women and they did not work like we do now.  I am convinced Premarin is helping me with daily life and I would not be doing well without it_ or at the least taking anti-depressants which I know others who take them with lots of side effects.  I could do without the weight gain_ but will not stop taking Premarin.",F,46,7  years.625 1X D,6/26/2015Email,Premarin
30, 5, hysterectomy,Swelling in hands_ ankles_ abdomen_ legs and feet on .9mgNone on .625 feel great.,I started taking .625 afyer my surgery 2 years ago. Dr. Upped to .9 after a few months.  I took for 1 year_ had weight gain_ but fatigue was gone felt good.  My insurance changed and I found Canada Drugs so ordere from them for $60.00 rather than over $100 from pharmacy.   They didnt have .9mg but had .3 so I took 3 of the .3mg per day after 1yr decreased to 2 of the .3mg every other day and found a great balance. No swelling_ lost weight_ felt great. Only problem with mail order is it takes about 10 days to get pills_ so you need to keep up with reorder.  I went 2 weeks without and was uncomfortable_  skin broke out_ yeast infection.  I will continue to take the .625 as it really helps.  I was concerned about going on this drug_ but after reading everyone's experiences_ I made a decision to go on.  It's quality of life and drug trials are done in the interest of drug companies not the public.  The women who were on the trial were all over the age of 60 and could have had heart disease anyway.  If you don't take progesterone there is not a problem_  it's the combo for women with uteruses that have risk for cancer. Thank you to everyone who posted here_ you helped me make my decision to go on and stay on this drug.,F,49,2  years.925,5/8/2015Email,Premarin

My hot flashes are so bad all day and all night without the Premarin. Gained 10 lbs since I have been off the Premarin.

I am a retired nurse and always cared for my hands with frequent lotions etc and the use of latex free gloves.

63, 4, To stop vaginal bleeding,None!,After yrs of iron deficiency anaemia_ GP decided to start intravenous iron replacement. After 2x100mg (I required 700mg to correct my iron) infusions I proceeded to bleed vaginally & uncontrollably. I was started on high dose_5mg of Premarin twice daily for 5days & cyclokapron 1g 3x daily to arrest the bleeding as Gynae said the endometrium (lining of uterus) was too thin_ causing the bleeding. Thereafter 28days of Premarin 0.625mg. My moods changed_ depression lifted_ boobs_ hair & nails GREW!! Dry itchy skin went away. Irritability calmed down & sleep patterns back to normal. I've now had a partial hysterectomy (ovaries still in) as the bleeding persisted for 2yrs. Starting the Premarin 0.625mg tonight & CANNOT wait for normality to resume!

84, 3, Hysterectomy at 31,Going on it_ I got pretty fast relief from vaginal dryness that had ended my sex life at 31. Now at 58_ going off it has been pretty hard. I have not gained weight_ but I do have regular hot flashes/flushes and now_ after 6 months_ I can't sleep more than a few hours_ even though I am tired_ some times exhausted. I am nauseous a lot_ and the quality of vaginal dryness was shocking. I am not talking discomfort_ I mean PAIN. Stop! and I'm not doing this kind of pain.,I went onto P when I had severe vaginal pain with sex_ a year after hysterectomy_ leaving ovaries in. Doc said it is very common for ovaries to quit working after hysterectomy. I was 31_ now am 58. Premarin was great_ erase all the symptoms (for years) and I had my ovaries removed ten years ago_ staying on the same does_ which is pretty high. When the heart attack stroke correlation was made public_ I asked about going off or taking half as much and doc acted like I was silly_ saying might as well quit_ since .675 was the same risk-wise. That doesn't jive with the medical reports_ and now I am worried all my docs are under the influence of drug reps. My Mom was on it for decades_ dying at 80 after a stroke_ so when I finally read all the little tags stuck onto my Rx bottle_ I felt stupid for taking it so long. Now my doc (different place) says to do whatever I want... Geesh. I pay for her expertise and really feel no confidence in any of them any more. I also take thyroid replacement_ have for decades_ and I remember doc telling me to NEVER get the generic_ because synthroid was so much better and the amounts were so critical_ the generics weren't reliable. Then decades later_ I get notice of a class action law suit_ won by generic manufacturers_ because docs had been saying just what mine did_ and it was proven to be false. I am sure my doc believed it_ but I am also sure he got his education from the drug reps. So now I am guessing the Premarin info is probably the same. Ki,F,58,26  years1.25 1X D,4/16/2013,Premarin

At least with the Premarin I was able to play with my baby and rest and not have to worry about my sex drive.

Then about 3 years ago the doctor wanted to reduce the dosage. The dosage was reduced to .90mg which was fine. No symptoms. The following year he wanted to reduce it to the lowest dosage of .625mg. I was not happy_ starting having panic attacks_ depression_ etc. I just did not feel myself so I asked him to up the dosage back to .90mg last year. This year when I had my annual mammogram they found a suspicious spot so a biopsy was done. I was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma on December 5_ 2011 and it was estrogen receptor positive so I have to stop Premarin cold turkey. I've only been without it a week. No symptoms.

133, 5, Total hysterectomy at age 25,same as with regular menstrual cycle - increased water retention during course of the month and some tenderness in breasts with a decrease of side effects during last 5 days of month when not taking the medication,At age 50 my doctor advised that I stop taking Premarin because of the possibility of susceptibility to heart attack_ cancer and stroke. As a direct result began having hot flashes_ night sweats_ dry skin_ reduced mental acuity_ was unable to sleep_ had loss of libido_ acute joint pain and depression. I suffered miserably with these problems for 8 months and they did not diminish. After taking into consideration my reduced quality of life_ I decided that it was worth the risk to begin taking Premarin again to see if the probems would disappear. I began taking a dosage of 1.25mg every other day and was relieved to find that my symptoms began to disappear within a week or so. I am currently taking .625mg/day and have some joint aches and pains_ drier than normal skin_ occasional mood swings_ weight gain and fluid retention. Overall I think the possible risk of stroke_ cancer and heart attack does not outweigh the poor dally quality of life that I experienced while not taking Premarin. Possibly I may live a few years less_ but my quality of daily life is far superior when taking the drug; therefore I will continue to take Premarin. After having read some of the comments here_ I considering taking a higher dose to see if the joint aches and pains occasional night sweats_ loss of libido and dry skin and mood swings disappear altogether.,F,63,38  years.625 1X D,10/31/2011Email,Premarin

My doctor has wanted me to get off the Estrogen many times through the years but I have refused to do so_ at one time having to change doctors.  If someone has a stroke or heart attack_ just because they are taking estrogen_ they blame it on the drug.  Many  people have strokes and heart attacks that have never taken estrogen.  I told my doctor that I am not willing to go through a lifetime of suffering just because I may or may not one day have something happen to me_ that may or may not be the effects of the drug.

In less than a week my husband and I was able too resume having sexual intercourse with no pain whatsoever. Then the next day I started having bad mood swings and hot flashes_ my head and back hurt all the time and I had bloating so bad I looked pregnant. I didn't want to discontinue taking it so I decreased it to half a tablet and stopped using the cream altogether and I'm doing so much better on the half tablet. The odd thing is I never really had any hot flashes and mood swings before I started taking the Prempro or Premarin.

It was not cancer_ we were blessed but when I wanted to go back on my Premarin_ my Dr. suggested not doing so_because I had taken it for so long. I felt so good when I took it. I did not feel as tired_ I had energy. I have lost a very few pounds since I have been off the medication but I believe I could manage those pounds. My joints were more flexible when taking Premarin. Now_ I get no sleep_the hot flashes are unbearable_ the heart palpitations are common. I just really will talk to my Dr. at this point about a dosage every other day possibly. I have been off Premarin for over 90 days and I feel like I am older than 65_ I want it back. Recently I bought Black Cohosh to maybe help.

I have tried every diet without managing any weight loss even though before using premarin I could diet when required to lose any additional pounds. My bloatedness which at the end of the evenings make me look 9months pregnant and the terrible itchiness to my lower legs mostly at night make it difficult to sleep.  I am so glad to you all for your comments which have helped me realise that what I have gained from being on premarin has been nothing to the side effects which I did not relate to the premarin but to just getting past the 50 yr mark.

During that period_ I have felt terrible_ although my headaches lessened.  It must be noted that I also STOPPED the use of my favorite food in the world_ CHOCOLATE.  Not sure which contributed most to the headaches being less_ but the premarin cessation has caused sleeplessness_ irritabilty_ crying_ loss of memory_ depression_ sense of impending doom_sweating_ dry skin_ lack of concentration and feeling like an old lady.  Two days ago_ my doctor recommended that I go back on the Premarin_ which I did and noticed a dramatic change in all the above symptoms_ especially the horrible hot flushes throughout the day. I will stay on this medication.  Since I work in the medical profession_ I am aware of the propaganda the drug companies produce (presented as education)to sell their wares.  Do not believe everything you hear. Do research on it for YOURSELF. Everybody is different and everybody's BODY is different.  No one can reliabibly predict side effects_ since chemistry is too varied and individual. The side effects and disclaimers are simpley to protect the interest of the drug companines against laws suits.

212, 1, Total Hysterectomy,44 yr old_ normally in great health.  After 1 year on Premarin I began to have constant pain_ throbbing and swelling in my legs. I suffered for months.

My Dr. said I still wasnt in menopause -still producing estrogen at first. Tried soy and herbal remedies-they helped reduce the hot flashes a bit for a while but I still felt very nervous and like crying all the time. Finally got the courage to try Premarin-dr. said it would help and the awful hot flashes stopped. I feel somewhat better mentally. I cut .45 in half and take it daily but wonder if the full dose would be better. Cant stand the weight GAIN. always had been slim.It does keep you looking younger I think-my skin is much smoother and younger looking than a friends who never took hormones. I worry about breast cancer but quality of life is better while on Premarin so I guess its worth the risk.,F,60,3  years,2/26/2009Email,Premarin
214, 1, hysterectomy,"I had been on Premarin 1.25  for 21 months.  Everything seemed to be going well_ yes I put on 45 lbs but thought it was the hysterectomy.  In August I started having severe foot pain and unbearable leg cramps.  I bought several pairs of shoes trying to relieve the pain.  Numerous trips to the doctor_ all kinds of blood work_ and on and on.  I was in so much pain with horrible swelling the last month I could no long stand it.  I started a Chiropractor and again nothing helped.  The doctor had thought it was a blood pressure medication they had me on for high bp_ I stopped taking it but the horrible pain and edema continued.  Finally one morning I said ""I am going to stop taking the Premarin_ and you know what the swelling left_ the pain in my legs were gone_ and I felt great.  I told the Doctor I had quit the premarin and he said he didn't think it was that but it certainly worked.  He gave me HRT patches to wear but I am not starting them unless hot flashes begin.

Having suffered since my early 20's with endometriosis and adenomeyosis I feel rejuvenated.  My skin is glowing and I look and feel great.

216, 4, Total hysterectomy at age 25,none,I had to have a full hysterectomy at age 25. I dealt with some depression as a result of it. I dont feel that the pill caused the depression_ I think it was just me getting usto the idea that I will never have the possibility of having a child of my own DNA. I thought it may have ben the drug causing my depression so i quit taking it. I received sever hot flashes and mood swings. Once i started taking the pill again_ I leved out. I would like to warn younger people who have had their ovaries removed thinking of quitting hormone replacement. Please consult your Dr. before stopping_ your risk of developing osteoporosis is greatly increased. The benifits greatly outway the risks for me having to take hormone replacemnt at such a young age.

218, 4, Totaly hysterectomy on 1/29/08,Total hysterectomy due to endometriosis_ bleeding in fallopian tubes and cysts on my ovaries. After that I experienced dry skin_ aches in shoulder & knee joints_ and hot flashes. My body suddenly felt very old.  Sexual feelings/urges were completely gone.  I felt like I'd been castrated_ it was so apparent that a part of me was missing.  After 2 week follow-up appt_ the MD placed me on 0.625mg of premarin.  However_ the physical problems persisted.  In my 3 month follow-up visit_ I asked for an increase in dosage and the MD changed it to 1.25mg.  The problems went away in 2 days and I felt normal again.  But in the following 3 months after my 2nd appt_ I gained over 30 lbs!!!,I have concerns about the abuse of mares in the maufacturing of Premarin.  I'm also greatly concerned about it's risks for causing heart disease_ breast cancer_ etc.  But even though I'm fat_ I feel more normal and able-bodied with the Premarin_ than without it.  Still_ I'm thinking about asking the MD to lower the dosage one notch just to cut health risks and see how my body adjusts.

221, 5, Had a total hysterectomy,I don't believe I have had any negative side effects.  I was told I would gain weight after my hysterectomy_ and I am heavier then before the surgery and taking Premarin.  However_ I have been able to lose weight by following Jenny Craig_ so I don't believe the weight gain is from either.,At age 40_ I had a total hysterectomy (both ovaries and uterus)due to Endometreosis.  After surgery_ I was immediately given a hormone injection_ then started taking Premarin.  I often get compliments on my great skin and most think I am at least 10-yrs. younger then my 57 years.  I do not have a history of breast cancer in my family_ and watching my Mother develop a hump on her back by not taking any HRT after her menapause_ I have made the concious decision to stay on Premarin 0.625 and have a great quality of life_ unlike some of my friends who are scared to death to use it and suffering.  In the end_ it is a personal decision_ everyone's bodies react differently to meds_ and based on each individual's family history and life choice.  One more plus_ I have same libido as prior to surgery/Premarin and experience no vaginal dryness_ so no need for vaginal creams_ gels_ etc.,F,57,18  years,1/21/2009,Premarin

I felt absolutely terrible_ anxious and nervous all the time_ not wanting to go out.  So he put me back on it and now I find I have breast cancer.  Surgeon reckons Ive had it 18mths or so and the tumor was very oestragen receptive.  I did not realise this medicine was made from mares urine and doubt I would have taken it if I had known.  But the way of the internet enables me to look things up now. I didn't connect the joint pain with the premarin but now I am off it I have realised it is not so bad.

Last week_ I resumed daily use and feel much better already.  I'll probably do five days on and two off at least until I am 70.  I can find NO statistical data proving a link between estrogen-only usage and breast cancer.  The data is all linked to estrogen-progesterin (which I refused to take 22 years ago after reading how unfavorably the Europeans were to it even back then).  I think it's human nature to blame something when we get a disease.  Premarin alone may or may not cause breast cancer_ but the data just isn't there in my opinion.

Managed ok but was struggling; progressively worsened. Around 3 month mark I was in really bad shape; unable to get out of bed or perform daily functions; raging insomnia & daily weeping.  Completed hormone saliva test through ZRT Labs(again as recommended by Drs. Northrup & Lee).  I was astounded to learn I was not Estrogen Dominant; I was  estrogen deficient.  The high dosing of natural progesterone cream had raised my progesterone level to a very high imbalance. I h,Next_ I plan to try to at least switch from Premarin to an RX bio-identical product (Estradiol)and see if that works for me.  Along with many others_I hate the side negative effects and increased risks of Premarin.  But_ when estrogen deficiency makes you bedridden and unable to take care of yourself or perform basic daily functions_ it seems there may be no other choice:(  Now_ I did later read in Dr. Lee's book that when Premarin is ABRUPTLY stopped it can result in a return of raging symptoms.  Dr. Lee states that our estrogen receptors go through rage withdrawals when the Premarin is suddenly stopped.  Therefore_ he recommends a 6 month progressive step down withdrawal. At some point after I get my system stablized again_ I want to retry stopping the Premarin through the 6-month taper down process.

I found a site that was FULL of women on PREMARIN experiencing symptoms IDENTICAL to me_ and it was like finding my way home after being lost.  Today_ I can barely walk anymore_ but I will no longer take the drug after today.  Add to that_ I also learned that they harvest the hormone from PREgnant MARes urINe (PREMARINE).

He said there is little worry in women who have had hysterectomies. He also stated that he only keeps women on premarin until they are at normal menopausal age. He felt this was around age 51-55. Of course this age in nature varies. He explained that it should be used as a supplement to provide extra estrogen during the time you would naturally be producing higher levels of estrogen. I asked about the progesterone. He said if you didn't have a uterus it is not necessary nor helpful. When you talk about long term effects.
