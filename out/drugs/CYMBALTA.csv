8, 1, bipolar depression with anxiety,Weight gain was(30Lbs)_ sweating_ memory loss,I started taking it in 2004. At first I hated the sweating and weight gain. After awhile I learned to cope with it and my anxiety was about 80% gone. My depression disappeared. It seemed as though I was never bipolar and I was textbook bipolar!. I was able to cope with even with an abusive partner. The issue is you cope too well. You become desensitized to everything. Nothing  feels normal. You just go through the motions of life. I didn't think of my children's needs or emotions because I had none. I weened off after 5yrs of taking it. Stepped down from 60 to 30mg then off. I did take prozac while weening. I was off for two months and asked to be put back on it after all my bipolar symptoms resumed. I took it and was back to normal except I had anxiety. Now after being on it for almost 16yrs I weened off again with prozac. I've been off cymbalta for 3 months. Still on 40mg of prozac_ but hope to wean off that_ too. The reason I wanted off is memory loss. Forgetting words_ there meanings and how to pronounce them. Driving and not knowing where I'm headed after a few minutes. Not able to enjoy sex. Just loss of feelings. After 3 months off I'm still without memories from the past_ have issues remembering the date_ names_ recipes_ appointments_ to thaw something for dinner. It's impossible to remember my meds or appointments. I don't have signs of depression but am on 40mg of Prozac. I just want to remember.,F,40,16  years90 1X D,6/20/2016Email,Cymbalta
9, 1, PTSD Symptoms,After 4 1/2 years on Cymbalta(30mg)_ and still dealing with Depression from PTSD_ I had a 24 hr psychosis event and ended up in the emergency room. My doctor then thought it best to bump my dosage to 60 mg. That extra 30mg of Cymbalta _ almost was the last nail in my coffin. Within a few months I was always irritable and angry verbally abusive to my family. My anxiety was on full blast and I couldn't turn it off_ causing tremors and restless legs. I slept 3 to 4 days a week_ and I had extreme depression. I had migraines and lived in a fog and couldn't even comprehend basic responsibilities _ like paying my bills or working my cell phone. I showed paranoia symptoms and my blood pressure would raise or drop at any given moment_ I was often dizzy or light headed_ probably from the raising and falling of my blood pressure. My heart would beat rapidly  much of the time_ and my sleep patterns way off. Because many of these symptoms resembled extreme PTSD symptoms and my VA doctor so many mil,I am experiencing residue side effect_ after a few months without Cymbalta_ mostly in tremors and restless legs.

I've had headaches since I stopped -I am not sure if it's due to the Cymbalta withdraw or maybe its a long term side effect? but I don't know what else would be causing them_ since I eat very healthly and do a lot to avoid anything that can cause cancer.  my primary doctor said ulcers can cause headaches?-so I'm seeing a specialist to see if that gets rid of the headaches?Cymbalta definitely worked for depression_ not sure about fibro pain.

After seeing every type of doctor AND having every type of blood test/urine test/a fat biopsy about the swelling and itching rash on the inside of my knees and what started on the inside of my ankles. I have FINALLY figured out that I am having an extreme allergic reaction to Cymbalta. It also landed me into the ER as my upper lip swelled up after a nap one day. I was then put on Prednisone 20 mg a day to subdue the swelling and rash/itching. After putting on even a lot more weight because of the combination of the Cymbalta AND Prednisone_ I have plans for stomach surgery within the next 2 months. I started investigating/researching Cymbalta and I noticed a common denominator. EVERY site I went to mentioned as a ""Severe reaction to Cymbalta"" ALL of my symptoms. I had an appt today with my doctor that prescribed the Cymbalta and I tried multiple times to advise him of all of the websites I checked_ EVEN THE FDA.GOV_ they all said the same symptoms.  HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT I WAS NOT ALLERGIC TO THE ACTUAL MEDICINE_ IT WAS THE DYE IN THE CAPSULES I WAS ALLERGIC TO! After going through the entire endocrine system_ ie: do you have diabetes_ etc. He decided to change me back to Pristiq.  i quit taking the Cymbalta 3 days ago and I was able to titer myself off the Prednisone and my rash_itching and swelling is so much worse than ever!",F,47,1  years120mg 1X D,5/13/2016Email,Cymbalta

In fact I am worse because this drug_ like most serotonin dominant drugs_ saps what little motivation I have left. I just have no interest or desire to do anything and this is much worse than before starting. The drug also failed to alleviate my bad memory and other cognitive impairment problems.

More like my brain was turned into ultra fine steel wool and I could hear and feel my steps at times. I could hear my eyes blink_ or a squishy sound in my ears (like someone squeezing steel wool inside my ears). The sounds came along with the ""mild electric jolt"" feeling too_ from toes to head often. Generic form I have are 6 small white pills inside the blue and white capsule. Dropped from 60mg to 30mg for several weeks. Then began removing 3 of the small white pills to take 15mg for a few weeks.

I stopped taking Cymbalta when I had skipped a dose and was too busy to deal with the nausea.  I didn't really intend to stop taking it_ but I didn't want to deal with the nausea so I just never took it again.  Didn't notice any difference for at least a month.  But then I went through more stress_ moved again_ downsized my business_ had staffing problems_ no family or close friends nearby_ etc.  Two months after stopping med_ I had extreme memory and disorientation problems.  That is getting better because I don't have as much on my mind now_ but I can't concentrate_ am very lonely and depressed and confused.  I have a lot of bad crying jags and feelings of homelessness and fear of the future.  I might go back on it_ but when I moved 4 months ago_ I never finished unpacking and now I can't find my meds so I would need to get a new prescription_ but it is so hard to get an apt to see a Dr.  I am just generally confused and can't make decisions.

Although I had told him I had pain in my liver he told me I should not have any pain. The pain got worse. I had more test through my PCP who uncovered horses and lesions through a cat scan with contrast. Thank God I had the good sense to do some research. I called my psychiatrist who she said Cymbalta could cause those problems. I had begun to run out of the prescription_ fortunately_ so I stopped taking it all together.

I went into an out patient program for mental illness_ still nothing worked. I am now back on cymbalta and finally feeling better. I could be better so my new doctor found that I don't absorb the medication correctly so plans are to up my dose to 140 mg and add folic acid. As for all the people who have had bad experiences with this drug_ all I can say is some meds work for some people and some don't. I had simalar experiences going on and off the half a dozen other anti depressants for a year and a half.

My Dr. didn't address the issue when he prescribed this medicine and when I told him I didn't want to take it any longer_ he said only_ ""skip a day in between doses for a couple of weeks"" to discontinue.... I skipped 1 day and got so sick_ I was constantly nauseated_ gagging_ and threw up for three days which caused me to loose the capsule (in the toilet) on the days I was suppose to take it. I have very significant issues with thermo-regulation which leads to a feeling of burning_ followed by profuse sweating. I have brain zaps that feel like electrical shocks and result in jerking and spasms. The overwhelming fatigue is almost as bad as the vomiting. I have been dizzy and now as I progress into withdrawal_ I am becoming more agitated_ negative and morose.  I decided to quit trying to ""skip a day"" and now open the capsule and divide the beads in half_ assuming that I am reducing my dose to 15 MG/day. This is nasty-nasty stuff and I would not recommend it to anyone. I am so thankful that I decided to dis-continue now rather than waiting until I had been on it for over a year or taking a higher dose.

93, 4, Depression_ Anxiety_ Fybromyalgia,Upset stomach and Nausea. Stomach Pain. Loss of appetite. It does tend to make me kind of un emotional.,The 2 most important things that doctors do not tell you about Cymbalta are 1.) It is extremely addictive & if you miss a dosage or run out (or stop) you come off it hard. The withdraw is very very rough.  It makes me bed ridden and very sick.  2.) Cymbalta has extreme interactions with many other drugs so be carful what you take with Cymbalta. Always read the pamphlet the pharmacist gives you & research it on the internet when prescribed a new medicine.  A doctor didn't look into the drug reactions and put me on Depakote. I ended up deathly ill in the hospital with Serotonin Syndrome.  However_ I still take Cymbalta. I've been taking it for years_ since before there was a Generic available.  I had incredibly horrible pain throughout my body_ it would keep me up screaming night after night.  Cymbalta changed my life as far as that is concerned.  However_ the effectiveness for my depression and anxiety has decreased in the last year & I've had to be put on Xanax and Adderall to compensate.  This is often a common effect of any medication used for psychiatric disorders.  I know a lot of people have had some bad experiences with Cymbalta - but it has really helped me.,F,27,4  years90 MG 1X D,8/8/2015Email,Cymbalta

Shivers/jittery feeling throughout the day and feeling like my heart was beating out of control. Pain radiating through left arm. Other unexplained aches and pains throughout the body_ but mostly in my left arm/shoulder.The worst part of this drug is the withdrawal symptoms. Oversleeping (>10 hours) and feeling sleepy ALL THE TIME. No amount of sleep helps me feel rested. Extreme irritability. Headaches. Nausea.Though it did help my mood and lack of energy I had experienced with depression_ I regressed back to having depressed episodes and anxiety attacks within a couple months.,My doc prescribed 60 mg of Cymbalta_ but told me to start at 30 mg for a week. I experienced the described symptoms on only 30 mg. I tried 60 mg of Cymbalta for a week and felt like it was going to kill me. My doctor looked at me like I was crazy when I told her this.

I went from mild anxiety to extreme panic attacks. Could not feel normal mentally and thought I was going crazy until I realized it was the cymbalta doing it to me!

Everything tasted weird like chemicals. Electricity/tingly feeling in hands and feet. Eyes felt like someone was holding them open_ pupils super dilated. Uncomfortable feeling overall in my own skin_ couldn't move without the pain all over my body worsening...,I have had 5 Scoliosis surgeries in the past 8 years_ the last two were this April 2015_ in the same week_ Emergency surgeries_ I had rods (hardware) in my back_ one of the screws got loose and moved into my spinal canal pinching my spinal cord. I almost ended up paralyzed_ or like my surgeon said_ I could have died if it cut my spinal cord. Throughout my surgeries they have removed 3 rib bones and a piece of my hip bone to fuse my spine. Through the everyday pain and struggle_ I have suffered through severe depression_ anxiety_ and lots of pain. My doctor thought_ let's try a medication that deals with all 3 of those things. So she prescribed Cymbalta... I had high hopes_since she seemed like it was such an amazing medication that I'd probably end up all smiles_ lollipops and kittens with the sun shining out of my ass... Nope_ a whole lot of nope_ I went Through hell with this medication_ I thought I was dying_ it puts you through the worst hell imaginable_ I kept wishing i could just rush myself to the hospital and flush it all out of my system. It made everything worse_ I could not Function_ I would never recommend Cymbalta to anyone unless you have a death wish... Good luck to anyone about to take it_I know a lot of people's systems are different. I saw more negative outcomes on this medication on this page than i saw any good feedback.

103, 4, bipolar major depressive episode,weight gain_ sluggishness_ sleepiness_ restless legs_ rashes_ slow healing wounds.,"What a strange drug. I just say at the outset that it definitely helped the depression and seeing as that was making me suicidal I can offset the multiple side effects against that. But it's after the depression passed that I realised how it had wrecked my physical bod somewhat. Weight gain was appalling and by the time came when I realised it had done all it could for the depression I was feeling very ""zonked""_ a sign with me that it's time to reduce meds because the episode is gone. The thing is_ nobody should be just placed on an anti depressant forever. You are not ALWAYS depressed_ it is a reaction to something happening in your life where your mind cannot handle it. My psych was great_ we reduced it quite quickly with a few_ not many_ initial anxiety days where my biochemistry got used to being without and now_ six months down the line I feel a lot better_ am losing weight and feeling like my old self.

104, 1, Back Pain,Withdrawal symptoms are horrific. The first time I tried to withdraw which may have had something to do with the fact that my doctor wasn't aware of how to ween me off_ I experienced elevated blood pressure_ debilitating brain zaps_ severe depression_gastrointestinal distress_ sinus issues_ abnormality of gait_ lack of appetite.,Over the last year I had weened myself down to about 10mg but had not been able to go below that because I would begin to experience withdrawal symptoms. I experienced some debilitating back pain and decided maybe I needed to start it again. Once starting it again at 20 mg this past Thursday my pain has subsided but I'm experiencing some depression and a severe lack of motivation. I'm so torn about my feelings about this drug because it works for pain but I don't understand the depression causing aspect if it is a anti-depressant. I also have no appetite and am nauseated. If I recall correctly I remember this being a side effect when I originally started taking it.,F,51,9  years60mg 1X D,7/5/2015Email,Cymbalta
105, 4, Major depression,Weight gain and fluctuation,The drug works well. It does slow metabolism. You initially lose some weight.. Then if you don't watch food intake and carbs... You will gain weight over a period of years. It also fluctuates up or down even if you hardly eat but eat starch and do not sweat or excersise moderately. The long term effects_ if you do not maintain a low food intake and SOME excersise will most often cause a gain of 3 to 10 pounds,M,62,7  years60,7/3/2015Email,Cymbalta

117, 5, Depression/Fibromyalgia,Have some minor brain fog at times and short term memory issues at times_ but these could be due to age or taking Ambien for insomnia.  I couldn't honestly blame it on Cymbalta,Have had life-long low to mid grade depression (familial) and was put on antidepressant 19 years ago after a major depressive episode. I intended to take for a short time but felt the best I had in years mentally_ so didn't want to give them up.  Talk therapy wasn't effective at all.  Also developed extreme body pain/exhaustion a few years earlier and was diagnosed with fibro.  About 8 years ago my doctor asked if I would switch to Cymbalta after she said she had several fibro patients responding well to it.  It has helped with the pain and depression.  My quality of life much better and minor side effects.  I am medication averse and always go to the alternative/holistic approach before resorting to any meds.  I have a very healthy lifestyle_ exercise_ eat well_ maintain BMI 19/20_ etc.  Recently I wanted to try to go off Cymbalta to try to be medication free.  Knew about possible severe side effects with going cold turkey_ so just reduced dose to 15 mg/day for 3 or 4 weeks_ with no issues.  Then tried reducing to 10 mg.  After a few days I was back to having circuitous negative thoughts/mental stress over very minor issues.  This was what I was so relieved to have end when I started on antidepressants.  I had a sense of wellbeing for the first time I could remember.  I decided to try to stay on 15 mg.

129, 5, Depression_ anxiety,I have taken Zoloft_ Paxil_ and Effexor all with awful side effects. Cymbalta is the first antidepressant I've taken that didn't kill my sex drive_ or cause any other significant side effects. Those dark_ depressing days I used to have are just a memory. The severe anxiety I've had since I was a child_ has significantly lessened. I appreciate so much_ everyone who takes the time to comment_ good or bad_ on the medications that have been prescribed to them_ and the experiences they've had with them. We are all different_ and what may be a wonder drug to one person_ might be another person's hell on earth. (That would be one dose of Paxil for me...insomnia_ and horrible anxiety),My sister passed away suddenly of a massive stroke_ and it threw me into a depression so deep_ I no longer could see anything positive and good about life. My Dr. thought upping my dose of Cymbalta to 90mg a day would be helpful. I resisted for months_ because I don't like to be on any more medicine than absolutely necessary_ but finally relented. I didn't even relate the dosage change to my increasing jaw pain and clenching_ and constant migraines until I decided to look it up here. It also caused my prolactin levels to skyrocket_ leading my Endocrinologist to request an MRI to rule out tumors. I am now going to reduce my dose of Cymbalta back to the 60 mg a day that's has helped me thus far_ without the side effects the additional  30 mg a day caused me. I'm hoping to do that with as few side effects as possible. I'm nervous about it_ because if I ever have missed a dose of my Cymbalta_ I start to feel awful_ my face starts to feel numb_ and those electric shock feelings start in my hands. I stopped worrying about ever going through the withdrawals_ because I plan to take Cymbalta for rest of my life. But now find it necessary_ because the extra 30 mg are causing so many unwelcome side effects. I still am very happy with the results I've gotten from the 60 mg a day of The Cymbalta_ and will stick to that dose from now on.,F,48,7  years60 mg 1X D,5/5/2015,Cymbalta

Migraine,Took first dose at 9 p.m. on Sat._ started getting drowsy around 10pm_ fell asleep and had horrid nightmares and could not wake up_ finally woke up at 1am with severe nausea and dizziness_ tried to make my way to the bathroom but felt like I was out of my body_ I was clopping or high-stepping like a horse and weaving all over the place. Made it back to bed where I stayed for nearly 24 hrs unable to raise my head from the pillow. It is now Monday night and I still have the migraine as well as a wheezing sound when I breathe_ all after one pill! I will be calling my Dr. In the a.m.,F,56,1  days30MG 1X D,4/7/2015,Cymbalta
135, 1, Anxiety,I wake up nearly every morning in a fog. I feel all of my cognitive functions have been muted. I feel off balance or dizzy. I feel like my vision is different. Get drunk from one beer_ fear its from the heavy toll this medication is taking on my liver. Poor memory_ can't concentrate_ simply do not feel like myself anymore.,I tried cymbalta because I was in a constant state of panic due to health anxiety. The only good thing I have to say about cymbatla is that it does take care of anxiety_ but I would imagine that a simple SSRI would provide the same results without the unwanted side effects. I guess I can't say the way I am feeling is all due to the cymbalta_ but there is a definite correlation between how I feel and when I started taking this medication.,M,29,6  months30 MG 1X D,4/6/2015Email,Cymbalta

My body feels good_ no weight gain or change in appetite; very little menstrual pain_ which I did not expect! I just feel so happy to be alive and I enjoy all the things I used to do; does affect my abilty to sleep for extended perioda due to some night sweats and vivid dreams; some sleep talking and outburts once or twice a week at night_ but i have no sleeping partner so this is no issue for me.

My physical pain level has been on average anywhere from 5-7 on a scale of 1-10 every day for the last 12+ years. It has now become much less (2-3) and depressive feelings/mood much better as well.,I don't understand why there are so many who have had adverse reactions to Cymbalta_ I have had great results so far.,F,54,1  years60 mg 2xda,3/16/2015Email,Cymbalta

143, 5, Osteoarthritis,Before taking Cymbalta I was on so much pain medication and still had no life. I missed out seeing my son grow up because all I did was sleep and barely move because of pain. My doctor started on Cymbalta and within weeks I had my life back. I had prayed so long for an answer. Pain stole so many years of my life and cheated my son out of having a mother. Just recently I tried to reduce the amount of Cymbalta I was taking. After 3 doses at the reduced amount I could tell a difference in my pain level.

145, 1, Depression Neuropathic pain for MS,I was recomnendedI this drug by my neurologist to help with MS symptoms and found my brain could not function as it had been. Very confused and bad memory loss_ which was extreme considering I had to hold down my job.One day I felt extremely unwell and went to the doctor_ while is was there explaining how I felt I had a huge reaction. Severe pains in my head with my blood pressure so high the machine would not work. I was rushed to hospital in an abulance in which the ambo thought I was not going to survive. I was in hospital for one month with at least five episodes per day of extreme debilitating pain and put on numerous drugs_ mri scans_ lumbar puncture etc. I felt my head was going to explode with the pain and was later told I could have died through the blood vessels bursting in my head. So I agree with the comments 100% it has been the EVIL PILL for me and would not recomend it to anyone else.,,F,55,6  weeks30mg 1X D,3/11/2015,Cymbalta

Whamo! Hit with major issues kept me in bed for a week. Nausea_ vomiting_ chest pain_ nose bleeds_ headaches_ dizzy_ food made me sick looking at it_ UTIs_ 5-8 bowel movements daily_ knowing this was coming I started eating lots of veg. Fruits_ taking 7000 IUs daily Vit D3 (not D2) potassium_ magnesium_ multi Vit. Drinking lots of water with lemon to detox liver some_ and used my oxygen all day and nite 2 liters especially when going thru bad part.  As a result in one week I was thru the worse. At my worse u can do nothing_ no work_ no thinking_ no walking_ just sit or lie down. It was horrendous but hopefully over. I'm now 10 days cymbalta free and symptoms still there but not severe.  Still wouldn't be able to work but I'm up and out now. My head is clearing up_ headaches gone_ vertigo only laying back_ I can eat but still healthy diet and vitamins and drinking water. My Dr was aware I did this but wanted me to do long withdrawal. I have strong personality_ pain doesn't bother me alot as I've been in it for 15 or so yrs. and I wasn't taking this for mental issues_ just to help with pain in right hip as it prevented me from walking and caused balance issues.  So not everybody will fly through this as quick as me but being ready mentally_ eating properly_ taking Vits before hand and for me having oxygen at home helped TREMENDOUSLY!

154, 1, generalized pain,Did not do much for the pain_ but made me not care about that or anything else. Increasing the dose to 90mg caused extreme anxiety and racing heart. Caused extreme social withdrawal_ no sense of self preservation_ no emotional responses_ inability to think clearly_ and a feeling of being removed from myself and the environment. Withdrawal symptoms were unpleasant and still ongoing. Now prone to anxiety attacks and zoning out with no memory.,The pain is easier to deal with than the side effects of this drug. I would rather feel_ even pain_ than feel nothing at all. This drug creates zombies.,F,55,1  years60mg 1X D,2/15/2015,Cymbalta

156, 1, Anxiety_ conversion disorder_ pain,This drug destroyed me. It took away my pain and anxiety. The anxiety so much so_ that I had no fight or flight response. I constantly wanted to take risks which is 100% not my personality. I ended up putting  myself in a lot of danger and being raped because I could not feel unsafe on that drug. Once my doctor assured me that this was a dangerous side effect of the drug and took me off_ the withdrawal was worse than coming off of street drugs. I was violently ill_ bounced back and forth between suicidal_ manic and dissociation_ and could not function in life. The weining the doctors suggested only made withdrawal worse and drawn out.,This drug is the devil in capsule for_  in my opinion.,F,22,1  years60mg,2/13/2015,Cymbalta

168, 3, Bipolar 1_ GAD_ PTSD,I thought my psych was going to stop this back in December_ but instead he doubled the dose. And simultaneously cut the Risperidone dose in half (?due to Parkinsonian-like side fx). This has helped me to a degree. I feel less depressed at top-level cognitive functioning but no less depressed at a more deep-seated level of consciousness. There is persistent anergia++ and this is possibly worse (certainly no better). Sexual dysfunction/libido remains poor and unchanged. On the plus side_ I can converse much better at dinner parties and the bipolar babble has settled.

By day 14 pain was increasing and occasionally my mobility was stiff. Day 54  my blood pressure and heart rate were  high. Day 55 I  felt unwell and my heart rate was 148. On arrival at A\E I collapsed and was rushed into resus where my heart rate was 175 and blood pressure 174/104. I was given  oxygen_ cannulated and given diazepam for total body jerking and spasms. I was so frightened. I was diagnosed as having a severe adverse reaction to duloxetine. I was admitted and the duloxetine stopped. The jerking continued for several days and I collapsed on several occasions. Whilst in hospital I felt suddenly drained of all energy and fell onto my bed unable to move for almost an hour. The medics agreed to allow me home providing I had someone at home with me. I had further episodes of  collapse whilst remaining conscious/ losing consciousness and unable to move my legs and hold my head up. One of these occurred at the gp surgery and another I phoned for an ambulance. Neither the gp I had grown to trust  nor the ambulance crew believed me. I was shouted at and told to move. Each time I became hysterical. I had further episodes of difficulty breathing_ chest pain for which I spent hours in A\E.

Tired- had to nap every afternoon.,Everything was great til the 5th yr. Started out with what we thought was a yeast infection. That lasted for 7 mos.My family Dr. treated me 2 times for a yeast infection_ then sent me to a gynocologist. He told me he'd never seen a case like it & did a biopsy. All came back negative. There were months I didn't want to go anywhere because I couldn't just get up & sit down. The rash went down my inner thighs. The sad news was - You may have to just live with it & try to boost up your immune system. I tried everything from not using toilet paper (wipes instead) and acidophilis vitamins. There was a little more relief everyday. When I started getting the itching all over_ that was it!!! A different dr. told me I had tinnitis 4 yrs ago & live with it. I even asak the pharmacist about any yeast infections from any meds. Finally I sat down at my computer & really investigated. There it was rash & itching on the sex parts. BINGO!!!!!!

It gets depressing going to the gym and eating less while you gain weight.  I hope the weight goes off as quick as it went on.,M,61,3  years60 1X D,11/24/2014,Cymbalta
185, 3, Depression/anxiety,Very foggy_ unable to think straight_ no motivation (no matter what the motivator)_ panic attacks_ unable to respond to emotions of others_ thinning hair_ sweating (especially around head)_ suicidal thoughts daily with some planning_ no sex drive...period_ emotions feel close to surface and as if they are competing to get out_ helped depression at first_ but not now_ very poor memory_ hard to follow a task from start to finish_ hard to walk straight at times_ VERY short temper_ hostile_ aggressive behavior_ easily startled by loud noise_ have to tell myself to show emotions...feel totally dead inside.,When this drug initially helped my depression_ I was thrilled. It seemed like a Godsend. One year after taking it_ I experienced an episode of ITP (immuno-thrombocytopenia purpura) and nearly died. I had 1_000 platelets when checked into the hospital and required two transfusions. Took 6 months to recover. They later discovered that this was from a medication interaction between Cymbalta and the 800mg ibuprofen I was taking for pain from a car accident. Doctor did not take me off Cymbalta_ but did take me off pain medication...not especially helpful. When effectiveness tapered off_ my dose was doubled to 120mg/day. I began having terrible bruises_ and my fingers would get painful bruises from blood testing for diabetes. I have become more and more suicidal and am moving toward the planning stages. I can barely make it through a full day of work_ and usually have a panic attack at around 2pm each day. I'm searching for an answer_ but in the meantime...I'm scared.,F,53,8  years60 1X D,11/21/2014Email,Cymbalta

189, 1, depression and anxiety,My Doctor First Started Me On 60 Mg And That Didn't Seem To Be Having Much Success As I Was Still Very Depressed And Had A Ton Of Anxiety. So They Increased The Dose To 120 Mg Per Day. That Helped With The Anxiety And Depression.I Was Very Low Energy Though. I Had Very Vivid And Disturbing Dreams On It as Well. At 4 Months I Decided To Discontinue UsE After Becoming Aware Of Side Effects That I Was Not Okay With And That Seemed To Be Worse The Longer You Were On It. I Was Plagued With Vivid Nightmares That Were Difficult To Wake Up From And That Would Continue From Where They Left Off When I Did Fall Back Asleep. They Were Accompanied by Terrible Night Sweats (Even When The House Was 68°). I Also Had Brain Zaps_ NauseA_ Headaches_ Confusion And DifficultY Thinking. Pretty Severe Withdrawals For Such A Short Time Of Usage.,I Did Not Experience The Weight Gain That Some Did (Though Perhaps That Was Because I Tried Living A Pro-Anna LifestyleAt First Then Stopped And  Began A Healthier Lifestyle Characterized By Healthy Eating And Regular Exercise) And Was Only Aware Of The Slightest Hint of A Decrease ILibido.

However_ the other side effects severely hurt your quality of life.  The brain zaps are no joke if you happen to have this side effect - almost mini-seizures in rapid succession.

This stuff is dangerous if you quit cold turkey or miss a few pills! But for the back pain it has really helped! Thinkin I'm getting off this crap soon and see how the pain goes.

202, 5, Depression_ fatigue_ brain fog,None that I noticed,If you are having major symptoms_ do not be afraid to try this drug.  Just ramp down from your old medicine if any and ramp up slowly to this one - take a whole week.  This medication has quite literally changed my life.  I'm a professional and wasn't able to get out of bed before 8_ and then I was foggy through about noon ... not good.  I would sleep 12 hours sometimes and still have these issues.  I am now sleeping normally_ 8 hours or maybe 7 at times.  I feel wonderful in the mornings now and can immediately get up and start my day without the fog. I have energy and am enjoying my interests and activities again.  I don't know if I'm having loss of appetite or weight loss quite yet_ but I will say that previous to taking Cymbalta_ I ate to wake up or clear my head and feel better.  That's no longer happening and I'm back to riding my bike_ gardening and other activities.  So I won't be surprised to lose a few pounds due to my decreased need to consume calories and my increased caloric burn.  I'm impressed -- in my 15 years of having periodic episodes of depression_ I've never had such a drastic turnaround.  Give this drug a shot -- if it doesn't work for you_ ramp down slowly and move on. Nothing to lose and a lot to gain here.,F,43,12  days60 mg 1X D,9/1/2014,Cymbalta

After the first 2 weeks_ which any good Dr. should have warned you about_ I'm fantastic:) Celexa and Cymbalta both have a 2 week side effect allotted time_ both at the beginning and when you're quitting. Keep in mind that it metabolizes out of your system in 72 hrs. I'm finding most of the reviews are coming from people who were not given a heads up.

I had been on paxil and celexa previously and never had withdrawal side effects.  The benefits by no means outweigh the side effects.

ALL of the aforementioned side effects plus I feel like I have the flu.  I have not been able to work_ take care of my husband or daughter_ take care of my house or even make meals on a consistent basis for the past 5 weeks while I am trying to get off of this med.  I cannot think_ spell_ or follow through on simple tasks.  The first week_ I went from 60mg to 30mg - I almost divorced my husband of 8 years.  The second week_ I almost killed myself.  the 4th week I went from 30mg daily to 30mg every other day. I am currently in week 5 of my detoxing and it has not gotten better.  I cannot go shopping_ people in the store are ""too close to me"" and I become very fight or flight.  I should have been in the hospital at least twice.

214, 2, For memory problems and anxiety,Extreme tiredness_ low libido,Did not work for my memory problems nor my anxiety_ both stayed about the same. I was on 60mg/d for a full year and then to 90 for a couple months which did nothing_ so I had to wean off of it completely. Be warned that stopping Cymbalta can be very dangerous_ I missed 3 doses_ 3 days in a row and felt like I could have killed somebody. When I weaned off of 90mg I went to 60 and then to 30 over a course of 2 months but that is not long enough. A few days after stopping from 30mg I had very strong urges to kill myself for about a week. I knew I really didn't want to die but that didn't stop my brain from telling my body to do something about it. Luckily I have family and doctors that helped me through it.The only positive I can give this drug is that it helped me sleep when I trouble falling asleep before taking it_ but it made me so sleepy that I needed a nap everyday. Now that I'm off it_ I hardly ever want/need naps but my inability to fall asleep is back.,F,26,1.5  years90 1X D,6/29/2014Email,Cymbalta
215, 2, Depression and Fibromyalgia,Major difficulty having an Orgasm (this could be considered good or bad.  Good_  because one can perform Sex for a long_ long time.  Bad_  because one can never get the satisfaction of completing the act.)  I stopped Cymbalta for six months and went on Viibryd. I also began the type 2 Diabetes drug_  an injectable_  called Victoza.   I was on Victoza for a year when I read that Cymbalta was now being used for Fibromyalgia.   So I took one to see if it would help.  7 hours later I became so nauseous I had to run to my bathroom to vomit - I ended up puking for 15 minutes straight until I had the dry heaves.   I thought perhaps I had a stomach bug so I put off taking the Cymbalta for a few days.   5 daysllater I took another Cymbalta. Sure enough 7 hours later I was running to my bathroom to puke my guts up once again.   It had to be the Cymbalta /Victoza combination that made me sick.   A year passed and I went to a new Rheumatologist.   He recommended that I begin taking Cymbalt,While I was taking Cymbalta it did seem to help my depression_  but it sure did not help_ nor alleviate_ any of my Fibromyalgia symptoms.   Also_  it seemed to lose its effectiveness after I took it for some time.,M,58,2  years60 mg 1X D,6/27/2014,Cymbalta

He filled me in about Cymbalta & how it is designed to work for Depression and as a Pain Blocker & that it is only 1 of 3 drugs approved for Fibromyalgia. -After 4 weeks_ I had fantastic results to complement the Lyrica that I had already been taking.

This drug_ like all mood effecting pills_ needs time to work and also you have to give it time to settle in initially_ and that means tolerating a little discomfort.

I have now gone pretty much cold turkey after 5 years on it because I am not sure if I am still in a depressive frame of mind.Unfortunately issues causing the depression are still there.Withdrawal symptoms are headaches_ dizziness_ and crying at the drop of a hat.,M,50,5  years60 1X D,1/13/2013Email,Cymbalta

Positive side effects more than out weight the first adjusting period. I sleep like a rock_ I feel great all the time now_ I have more energy than I have had in years.,The first week is going to suck. I ended up taking a week off of work_ but it is totally worth it. I have not felt this great in a long time. I can finally sleep_ drive a car without crying_ concentrate on the future and make rational choices again. I have lost about 30 lbs (a good thing for me) and I'm finally interested in life again.

320, 5, Fibromyalgia,Weight gain_ a slight bubble personality,I was put on cymbalta to try to help with my migraines and fibromyalgia pains. It did not help at all with my numbness or problems sleeping_ but I thought I would taper off because I was still feeling numb. The first three days I was more my moody_ impatient self... but I realized it kind of kept me in this weird bubble. Within three days my double vision returned and a constant head pressure. Now_ about a week and a half off_ I am in so much pain I can barely type this because my hand hurts. I forgot how much pain I was in before. I am miserable. Cymbalta may be the worst drug made but it made me a functioning happy person and I am getting right back on it.,F,28,9  months60 2X D,11/19/2012Email,Cymbalta
321, 5, Depression/anxiety,No bad side effects what so ever...,Initially I was given Cipralex along with a Ativan to control my initial anxiety due to a horrible gambling addiction I was recovering from which caused me so much pain and suffering I was wishing I would die. I hated my life and what I had done. Although the Cipralex helped me with my anxiety at first_ I was sleepy all day_ gained almost 30 pounds + my libido was non existent. My doc then gave me Wellbutrin which made me feel better as I lost most of the weight_ then headed on 30 mg of Cymbalta gradually increasing into 60 mg. I feel great_ I'm able to work 2 jobs + able to be a better father and husband. I hear that the withdrawal symptoms a eye nasty but thus far I have no plans of getting off. I get my blood tested once a month or so to make sure my liver is ok. As matter of fact my doc said that my overall blood work has improved.I've read many horror stories about this med_ so I guess it affects people differently. I guess nobody can say if any med is good or not until you try it.,M,38,3  months60 1X D,11/18/2012Email,Cymbalta
322, 1, Chiari Malformation 2cm Herniation,My experience was horrible.  I reconnected with a childhood friend who is a pharmacist (and has been for 40 years).  He told me that Cymbalta is one of the most dangerous medications on the market that he can not believe that it was approved by the FDA. Everytime he fills it he has a very sick feeling that he has done harm.  THAT should tell you something!  Wish I had spoken to him BEFORE I took this nightmare drug and the withdrawal was unspeakable!,Vile drug!,F,65,6  months60mg 1X D,11/17/2012,Cymbalta
323, 3, Depression_ Fibro pain,Extreme nausea_ memory loss_ lack of clear thinking_ highs and lows of depression_ some help with painI'm truly confused with this medication! It helps my depression quite well_ but for some reason I get these terrible lows and have suicidal thoughts. I BARELY notice its effectiveness with my Fibro and MS pain_ so although I'm on such a high dose (120mg daily) I still have to take 800mg Ibuprofen and Oxycodone daily as well. My memory is totally shot_ which could very well be from my illnesses period. I've notice a very high increase in my sexual desires and have made some extremely terrible decisions which does not fit my personality at all. Has anyone else experienced the latter in particular? Being sick is so frustrating. You can never find the proper balance... Lots of hot sweats at night_ very unusual dreams. I'm not sure if this med truly works or not due to the crazy affects my illnesses give me in the first place_ and then add aaaall the meds I'm on. It's a never ending battle.,,F,29,2  years120mg,11/13/2012Email,Cymbalta

325, 1, RSD,Spaced out_ heart related issues_ shortness of breath_ developed sleep apnea_ among many other issues,"Horrible drug_ my doctor put me on it because of my RSD both for pain and he thought I was depressed?? We didn't share that ""depressed opinion""........probably more like ""kick back"" from the drug company but that's only my opinion!I was also taking Lyrica and other medications for pain as RSD is very painful. My opinion was TOO MUCH DRUGS........the human body couldn't handle it all...........!!They have a ""PILL"" for everything these days.........makes you wonder!!I came to a point that I decided I wasn't taking this medication any longer as I felt it served no useful purpose. That's when the good part came_ you have to initially take this medication in a very subscribed manner to get on it as well as off it. It is very indicative of Niacin.......you get the heart palpitations along with the flushing only 100 times worst..........you think you're going to die any minute!Stopped the drug_ suffer for several months from the withdrawl symptoms but totally relieved all the side effects including the apnea!!

326, 3, Fibromyalgia & depression,To be honest_ it is hard for me to distinguish the side effects of this drug since I take some other medications as well (e.g. Lyrica).  However_ I have experienced dramatic weight gain.  Also_ I am sleepy all the time.  This might be a combination of the Lyrica and Cymbalta together.  I'm not sure.,I tried to stop taking Cymbalta_ but reverted to having worse pain and very depressed.  This condition sucks regardless.  I guess it is better to take this med and not be in so much pain all the time.,F,49,2  years90 mg 1X D,10/23/2012,Cymbalta
327, 5, low back pain_ fibro_ arthritis,This drug has been a miracle for me.  Ater taking Lyrica and several anti-depressants with major side affects (also on Norco for 2 years)_ Cymbalta has allowed me to a live an almost normal life.  Started out with 30 mg once a day and six nuerontins_ slowly weaned off the nuerontin and dr upped Cymbalta to 30 mg one day/60 next day alternting every other day_ I can now exercise_ do most chores around the house.  Still have difficulty sitting for more than half an hour but will take it over previous agonizing pain.  Have noticed some Vertigo lately but no sure if related to Cymbalta or something else going on.  Didnt have this problem for past year and a half.,Felt immediate results....less pain after taking for several days and attitude change to positive instead of dreading getting up in the morning.  Started to see weight loss after lowering Nuerontin and dosage upage of Cymbalta.

I do not use Lortab very much and this was to be something that would sort of help me daily. This drug was terrible. Would NOT advise taking it. It did nothing for pain. It mostly just made me sick. Quick after giving it a solid 30 day try.  When I don't want to use the Lortab. I do much better taking Motrin or an older medication called Ketoprofen.,F,38,30  days60 1X D,10/20/2012,Cymbalta

335, 5, Depression,Mild headache_ GI upset,I am weaning from Cymbalta for two reasons: 1) I have developed GI issues and believe Cymbalta plays a role and 2) I have lost my insurance and can't afford to pay for the drug. I let my NP know how I planned to wean_ which was 10mg at a time every week and add 10mg of prozac when down to 20mg of cymbalta I have had no withdrawal symptoms; other than a mild occasional headache_ which excedrin took care of. I am currently on my last week of cymbalta_ taking 20mg of cymbalta and 10mg of prozac daily. I took 50mg of cymbalta for a week_ then 40mg_ then 30mg_ now 20mg plus 10mg of prozac. I also starting taking a natural_ whole food/green food_ multi vitamin for women as I began the weaning process and plan to continue with that. I am undecided as to whether I will continue with a therapuetic dose of prozac long term or not; thinking of going with something natural like 5htp Cymbalta worked wonders on my depression. I suffered from depression for 15 plus years_ including 3 major depressive episodes with suicide attempts_ and then dysthimia (sp?). I am worried about the depression returning... time will tell (I started taking Cymbalta in April 2011_ so I was on it for a year and a half_ daily dose: 60mg) I was very worried about withdrawal symptoms from Cymbalta because while on Cymbalta if I was even a few hours late with my dose I could feel it immediately: body aches_ fatigue_ equilibrium off_ muscles weakness_ etc. I am thankful for these discus,F,43,1.5  years60mg 1X D,9/24/2012Email,Cymbalta

339, 1, Depression/Anxiety,Just wish I had seen this site before I had started taking this hellish drug. I have been treated with Epilim for the last 3 years and now all of a sudden the dr has decided to change. The first dose_ within an hour I was violently ill_ I developed a fever_ cold sweats and the chills. My muscles were beginning to tense up and I was clenching my teeth like crazy. I've never done that_ even in the worst anxiety attack. A few hours in_ I was tired_ emotionless_ achy and developed a terrible headache. That night_ my sleep was restless and plagued by vivid_ disturbing nightmares. I still took a pill the next morning_ hoping the side effects were temporary. I slept all day_ apart from running to the toilet frequently. The muscle tension and clenched jaw continued and the fever and chills also. It was the first time I ever contemplated suicide_ but didn't pay much attention. Third day_ took another pill_ but found this website and decided I would stop. 4 days after stopping the meds_ I still had a fever and chills_ the jaw clenching and broken sleep. Stomach cramps have eased a little by day 4 off the meds_ and I'm starting to finally feel a little more human.

Took 4 months to come off it.  List of side effects during withdrawal is lengthy. Extremely unpleasant and at times frightening.  Too many to put down here.  A couple of side effects have no yet disappeared even after stopping Cymbalta over 4 months ago.,My personality changed while I was on Cymbalta but has returned to 'normal'.  Now I am embarrased over some earlier behaviour.  Also my brain has cleared (not confused as it was when doctor was warned of likely imminent death) and my memory vastly improved. I am amazed that I seem to have escaped.  However_ at night I am usually sweating around neck and down chest despite the fact that it has been winter.  I find that I can't control my environment to ensure that I am neither too hot nor too cold.  There seems to be virtually no margin_ no comfort zone.  I will either be too hot or almost immediately feeling chilly no matter what I do.  I do not have a temperature.  My husband can be wearing a coat and beanie while I am in a sleveless cotton nightdress and have the window open.  It is not menopausal.

The depression worsened to a point where I felt an internal agitation (not anxiety) that was unbearable.  I attempted suicide and almost succeeded by the 6th week on this poison.,There were 15 suicides during the drug trials of this drug_ yet the FDA approved it.

My pain became unbearable and all I was offered was Cymbalta; not even a good placebo.  After 2 months on Cymbalta I asked my Dr: do you even care about my back pain?  Do you think that Vicodin is in any way_ shape or form a ""worse"" drug than Cymbalta?  Vicodin works and has few side-effects_ the Cymbalta side-effects are terrible and it doesn't work; and stopping it is worse than stopping Vicodin.  After a little badgering_ he admitted that Cymbalta was a bad choice and I got my 6 month rx for Vicodin..that was 4 months ago_ pain pretty much gone and I only use it prn.

I wished it would last as then life would have been amazing and joyous! It didn't last so I went from euphoric and high to depressed and low. My mood plummeted and I felt worse than prior to starting it. My pupils were dilated and people thought I was high on illegal drugs. I felt alot of pressure in my eyes which was painfull. I was sensitive to light and had to wear sunglasses alot even indoors. My pupils went back to normal after a few weeks_ maybe even smaller than usual. My eyes have continued to feel pressure and hurt the entire 2 years I've been on Duloxetine. My mood is fairly good but I don't have bursts of laughter like I used to before I went on it. I'm very disappointed that it doesn't really reduce my chronic pain. I still feel anxious_ sweaty and paranoid on Duloxetine. It does give me lots of energy and keeps me awake. Initially it made me lose my appetite then when that wore off my appetite increased. I am always craving sugar. My blood pressure is normally low but it decreased my blood pressure even more.

416, 3, Bipolar depression,nausea dry mouth constipation,the only reason why i'm giving this a 3 and not a 4 or 5 is because it is not a good med for those with bipolar who are prone to mania. the pro of cymbalta is that it made everyday activities more tolerable/conquerable and even enjoyable. however_ it made me feel manic as well_ which gets old after a while because there is no balance. I felt like maybe i was being numbed and i really just think that people with bipolar shouldn't be on anti-depressants. however_ if you have clinical depression and lack motivation to get everyday things done_ then i think cymbalta could be like a breath of fresh air for your life. again_ it can make you feel manic or strung out_ so not everyone should take as high of a dose as i did.,F,24,1  years60 mg 1X D,3/27/2012Email,Cymbalta

I started to feel better- I didn't sleep much but felt more ""alert"" and awake initially. I started at 30_ eventually up to 60 and was good there_ when Dr prescribed 90 I asked to go back down. Did not like 90. felt suicidal. I exercised 4+ times a week and didn't understand why the scale didn't go down. I had a decent shape after 4 months of 4x's a week exercise but wouldn't lose weight. i am still baffled on this. When I stopped exercising because of a job switch and lack of time_ i gained 20 lbs rapidly. i am back to exercising 2x's a day_ 3 times a week and still no weight loss but no gain either. I do hate this drug and have tried to get off for a year now. If I miss a day_ i am so sick and nauseaus. That doesn't even fully describe it. i do not  think anyone should ever take this drug if another option is availabe. I was weaning off as dr ordered but still not quite there.

My doctor prescribed it for pain contro with my Osteoarthritis.  I waited till the next day to take it_ as I don't like to take a new med in the evening.  I began with a dry mouth and then dizziness.  I lay down and when my husband called to see how I was I said I was okay as long as I stayed prone.  I had to get up to talk to a client and could hardly make t to the computer room for dizziness.  I hung up on him due to feeling so bad and lay down on the floor to try and stop the dizzies.  I began throwing up and then lost control of my bowels.  Called my husband to come home and my daughter.  She stayed on the line till he got home.  I crawled to the hall as I couldn't walk and she called an ambulance as directed by the doctor's nurse.  I was dehydrated and had stage 4 blood pressure.  I don't remember the 45 minute drive to the hospital.  I would NEVER recommend this drug.  It is quite capable of killing.  Had my husband not gotten home I would have gone into a coma and possibly died.  This is a case of the cure being worse than the condition it is supposed to cure. Oh and my doctor wanted me to keep the samples to try again later.....Not a chance. I am now doubting how trustworthy he is.,F,65,1  days 1X D,3/23/2012Email,Cymbalta

Thank goodness I wasn't crazy. ALSO_ bad constipation_ I think it brought on my IBS that I am now dealing with. Previously_ I did not have very many stomach problems_ after being on Cymbalta for 2 years I have so many issues with my stomach.,The withdrawals from this medicine are even worse_ I thought I was going to die. I didn't realize it was the reason I was flipping out until a couple weeks later and I got on the internet and found out it was withdrawals of Cymbalta! I cried nonstop for 2 weeks_ and begged my pharmacist to help me_ I thought I was having a reaction to another medication_ thats when we discovered it was the Cymbalta!

When I started thinking about suicide_ I was able to reason with myself and remind myself that this was just withdrawal from that godawful stuff and that it'd be over fairly soon. I didn't notice any difference in my pain level as a result of stopping the Cymbalta. I also didn't notice any effect on my pain level when I started it. Pharmaceutical Co. are way too good at pushing their drugs_ and maybe in getting other treatments killed_ like Medical Marijuana. Just like GM did to the electric car. Medical Marijuana has helped improve my life while getting me off of meds for spasticity_ nauseau_ depression_ acid-reflux and who knows what else. I feel so much better now than when I was taking all those pills_ Which was when I was in the hosp. for 9 mon. and rehab for 5 1/2 mo.

Doctor thought it was a bug. Negative. Blood test showed increased levels of something which meant I had an allergy to something. I think it was the cymbalta. I weaned myself off over about ten days.

Then the personality change began_ since I live alone I did not realize it until road rage began.  I tried to tell my doc this but she just blew it off ( I later discovered that SHE was being paid by the drug company for a drug ""survey"") Then things began to happen such as: I would be driving and have no idea where I was going_ woke up several times in my car in my pajamas_ packages would arrive at my home from the TV shopping channels addressed to me_ I had NO MEMORY of ordering them_ I overdrew my checking account several times ( HAD NEVER DONE THAT). Then the pain slowly_ along with ""brain fog"" and ""brain zaps"".  The doc did not want to hear about the brain issues she just wanted to up the dosage to address pain issue( again the ""survey"").  So I asked a trusted pharmacist (an older man) he said off the record ""OH YES very common_ don't you know this is a legal form of Ecstacy?""

I've always self managed my own symptoms over the years and recently felt the need to trying something different in combination with possible therapy.

I felt like I needed to be hospitalised. I regret not doing some self research on this before to understand potential effects on my body and state of mind. Regardless of whether the effects are temporary_ I'd rather try and be overall healthy the natural way. I know everyone has a different experience - for some better/worse than others. Before turning to these drugs_ if any of you have even that smallest bit of motivation and zest for life- find the things which make you happy and get on those natural highs instead_ it's the best kind.. you don't know what kind of (permanent) physical_ mental and emotional damage these drugs can cause. Also not a bad idea to read experiences and weigh the goods and the bads (for me_ the negatives def outweigh the positives!) Getting on theses things could make things even worse. This experience has taught me a lesson for life. Try not to give up on hope for better days ahead!! And for those on here who have already mentioned this - I agree_ this stuff is lethal.

463, 1, depression/anxiety,brain zaps_ increased suicidal thoughts_ weight gain_ mood swings_ insomnia_ no self worth or motivation at all.,cymbalta was the worst thing to ever happen to me. i started taking  for severe depression and at first it seemed to help. for about 6 months i took 20 mgs twice a day. then it seemed to not have near the effect it did before and i attempted to kill myself. my mom thought maybe a higher dose was needed. so i went to 30 mgs twice a day. Depression symptoms improved but i was tired constantly and had started to gain weight. this started a cycle of upping my dose every six months until i was at the highest recommended dosage of 120 mgs a day. For about a year i stayed at this amount and felt increasingly awful as time past. suicidal tendencies becoming overwhelming_ brain zaps even if i missed just one pill. i lost my parents insurance and cymbalta was 250 dollars a month. i was buying 6 pills at a time for 35 dollars and only taking half my dosage and suffering the awful withdrawals. finally a solution came. i had gained 80 pounds over the 4 years i was on cymbalta and i went to a doctors weight loss clinic. the doctor told me if i wanted to take phentermine_ i had to quit cymbalta because it was like taking a double dose. so she prescribed me 60 mgs of prozac and 37.5 mgs of phentermine daily. SHE ALSO SAID STOP TAKING CYMBALTA COLD TURKEY THE NEXT DAY. i was scared to try_ but i did it_ and it worked. mild withdrawals for about a week and now i have been off of it for almost two months. i feel better than i ever have.,F,22,4  years60 MG 2X D,1/3/2012Email,Cymbalta

I am also a recovering alcoholic/drug addict (clean/sober for five years now). I suffered from major depressive disorder_ suicidal ideation and attempts_ seasonal affective disorder_ generalized anxiety_ self mutilation_ and dysthimia (sp?).I tried paxil_ welbutrin_ lexepro_ and celexa. Cymbalta has finally relieved my depression. I have been on Cymbalta for nine months. I am curious to see how I do this winter - depression is usually worse for me in winter months; this will be my first winter on Cymbalta.I attend psychotherapy and also tend to my spiritual health.The horror stories of Cymbalta kept me away from it. Out of desperation I tried it finally; so glad I did! If and when I come off of it_ I will treat it as a med that needs progressive withdrawal measures.I recently started taking clonazepam for anxiety. The combination is working well for me. I take 1/2 tab of clonazepam at nightI take 60 mg of Cymbalta at noon. I get flu like symptoms (body aches/fatigue) immediately if I skip a dose or am late with a dose. I get occasional stomach upset/burning_ which I take Tums and omeprazole to relieve. No other side effects thus far.For me_ suicidal ideation was immediately relieved within first couple weeks of taking Cymbalta.  (Life is so much easier without those pesky_ self loathing_ negative thoughts!)Cymbalta also lessens menstrual cramps and lower back pain for me; although_ I still take NSAIDS for both occasionally (even,F,42,9  months60 mg 1X D,12/18/2011Email,Cymbalta

After three months: hot spells_ last longer sexually_ don't realize how drunk or full of food you are.  If I miss a pill I have insane dreams and some withdrawal. I think going off these meds will be very difficult.,This medication has changed my life.  My depression and anxiety were at time paralyzing.  I now enjoy life!

477, 4, Depression_ prereferal neuropothy_,Racing brain_ not sleep well_ dry mouth_ sexual disfunction_ bad memory_ bad dreams_ endless energy.,All medicines have side effects!!  it is how it effects the individual in different ways.  Up until now I have been taking Endep for the pain and neuropathy and Citropalapram for depression.  These drugs both had similar side effects to Cymbalta and hard to withdraw from with bad withdrawal symptoms the only difference is the Endep knocked me out at night and I slept well_ only very drousy and tired during the day_ sexual disfunction just the same.  So I figure in my mind that having one tablet to take and only pay for just one lot of medication ($34.20Aud) has to have a plus and only one set of side effects and withdrawal symptoms to cope with is even more a plus.  By the way_ with Citropalapram had endless energy for the first year or so then just felt worn out and tired after that.  Having said that also_ it saved my life as I was so bad before taking the drugs all I wanted to do was die to stop the dark depression and pain_ so I think I have done well.,F,57,3  months30mg 1X D,12/13/2011Email,Cymbalta

Since they of the same ilk_ the transfer wasn't too bad. Actually worked okay for the first 9 months (hey_ doctors don't have a clue how all these drugs work but they dole them out to millions of us guinea pigs every day) _ then everything turned bad: I became so depressed that I wrote my goodbye letters and picked out a spot to park my car where I wouldn't be disturbed once I stuck the hose from the exhaust into the window; I had trouble concentrating on driving and had a rear-end collision; having never been a great sleeper_ I began waking up 30-50 times per night so I was constantly exhausted; lost the little that was left of my libido; experienced extreme pain in my muscles and joints... Tried changing the dosage and experienced the worst depression in years... I was looking forward to ending the pain through suicide_ I experienced fits of rage at nothing in particular (except my desperation)... it was a full on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde transformation and very_ very scary... I'm now at 120 MG A DAY OF THIS S%*T...

Couldn't stay on it as it wasn't taking the edge off pain and my BP was 160/110_ so dr wouldn't increase dosage_ infact she took me off.  Just now getting off of Effexor XR today as it is not doing the trick_ and going back to Cymbalta.  I am hoping that it will address my osteoarthritis as well as my fibro.  I liked Cymbalta and felt it managed my situation. Those in chronic pain are always looking for the new fix and I think this is the med I need to stick to.

481, 4, started for depression,None really.,Some aches and pains that I never related to fibro went awat or have gotten more mild or disappeared depending on how stressed I get. One problem right now is ready to get off because the things causing my depression are better but I am getting muscle cramps in my legs_ feet and toes real bad as I taper to every other day instead of every day. Not sure if it is the Cymbalta or not. Such a puzzle. If I have to stay on the biggest problem would be cost..but it is most important to me to feel better.  I did not have problems with sleep but take a sleep aid anyway. Did not get constipated or diarrhea but I also came up with a severe case of lymphatic colitis AT LEAST 5 months before the cymbalta was started and took meds for that with regularity. Sine I have tapered off with that maybe that is the cause of the sever cramping. God only knows. Drugs are such a pain in the ass of confusion.,F,58,6  months60mg 1X D,12/9/2011Email,Cymbalta

The rest of the side effects I still have_ but they're not bothersome. The fact that I'm not having periods has curbed my menstrual migraines. I hope that side effect continues! As for my mood_ it has never been as stable as it is now. I used to have terrible PMDD every month_ which became unpredictable mood swings/depression as my cycle became more erratic in peri-menopause. Now I feel human again.

I slept through the night right after I took it and all day the next day and all night.. It seemed like the only thing I could remember was a bunch of ppl coming in my room to check on me at one time. It was just a memory flash and was extremely vague. I was later told that it was only my mother and my granny. When I was finally able to get up my body felt really strange. I had extreme body chills_ I couldn't unclench my jaws hardly and I constanly felt the urge to yawn. Try doing that while clenching your jaws lol_ It hurts. I came to find out 8months later that I do not have fibromyalgia.. I have Lupus. Cymbalta is definately not for lupus patients. As for fibromyalgia_ cymbalta has been shown to be effective for 1:4 ppl. My mothers friend has fibro and cymbalta helped her but of course its not for everyone.,F,26,1  days30mg 1X D,10/20/2011,Cymbalta

Ill admit it can be difficult but if you work with your doctor you can find ways to make the medicine work. It is not ""poison "" and your totally ignorant to say such a thing_ doctors go to school for a lengthy period of time and are doing whats in beat interest for their ppatients_ with the exception of some doctors. Suggestion ; if your having dif difficulty with the drug then work with your doctor to fix it. No med like cymbalta will just work over night you need to give it time and make it work with you. 4 months later and I'm still working with it but I have used just about every single kind of medication and all have failed_ this has worked best with me. Another thing_ everyone is different_ everyobrs bodied function different and medicine works differently on every person. Read the warning labels if your parinoid about side effects or try herbal remedies instead which help tremendously such as teas.  Those who have suicidal thoughts and tendoncies on this drug should obviously talk to your doctor and get off immediately. I am 23 years old and its quite sad listening to people blame their doctors and medicine for lack of help and care.

525, 1, Depression and Neuropathic Pain,Increased Anxiety_ Tingling Sensations_ Muscle Twitching_ Bouncing Vision_ Ankle Clonus_ Extreme Suicidal Thoughts_ Worsening of Symptoms,My experience with this drug was awful.  I was taking Wellebutrin for depression with little side effects then was prescribed Cymbalta for neuropathic pain. I discontinued the Wellebutrin since I was told by my doctor Cymbalta was also prescribed for depression.  Little did I know the side effects would be horrendous.  I was almost convinced that I was nuts. After doing some research I found I was not the only one that had problems with it.  I  discontinued it and went back to the Wellebutrin.  The withdrawals were worse than the side effects.  I couldn't even function and was experiencing suicidal thoughts. It was quite frightening. Once the withdrawals subsided which took about 3 weeks I felt much better. Eventually all of the side effects disappeared. I think this drug is seriously detrimental and the benefit most certainly does not out way the serious side effects. I certainly did not experience any benefits.  Why doctors prescribe this medication is beyond me.  I suppose once a certain amount of patients lose their minds or lives then perhaps someone will take notice and remove it from the market. Until then they should at least put a black warning label on it indicative of the skull and cross bones sighting (WARNING take at own risk will cause severe mental disturbances and physical health problems!),F,41,5  months60 mg 1X D,9/23/2011,Cymbalta

My new doctor gave me Cymbalta to try. I took one pill!! Up all night with anxiety_ feels like my skin is crawling_ nausea_ dizzy spells_ feeling angry and no appetite!! So here's my concern. Doctors do not want to prescribe pain meds due to the side effects however they will give away this extremely expensive poison (Cymbalta) for people to try. It seems appropriate to tell all to check this med out prior to taking it. Anything with an entire page dedicated to side effects probably hasn't been tested enough. So easy to hand out a drug that causes so much stress and negative side effects shows that a doctor doesn't care or hasn't done their homework about this terrible drug!

Have a low libido and find it very hard to orgasm.  Very frustrating since I consider myself a newlywed.  I have gained about 40 pounds which is why I WANT OFF of it NOW.  Read an article in the August edition of Men's Health called My Chemical Romance.,I started my taper down on Monday.  Opened up my capsules and took out half so I assumed I was going from 60mgs to 30 mgs.  Monday was fine.  Tuesday after 30 mgs_ I experienced diarrhea all day long_ dizziness_ nausea and brain zaps.  I was able to eat a small lunch and still work out on the elliptical.  Ate eggs and toast for dinner.  Went to bed at 10.  Today_ Wednesday_ a completely different story.  Slept through my alarm.  I have never done that in 47 years.  I could not get out of bed.  Had horrifying_ vivid dreams/hallucinations that I could control.  I could keep going in and coming out.  CRAZY.  And I can remember everything about every dream.  I have horrible stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I could not get out of bed until 5 pm today with my husband's coaxing.  He finallly called my Psych doc and told her what I was doing.  She said STOP.  Take 60 mgs immediately!!  And she is forcing me to take 60 mgs tomorrow and call her at 5pm.  She said she will help me withdraw from the Cymbalta.  So for now_ my three days of tapering down is on hold.  I am angry_ crying_ dizzy_ sick.

552, 3, Chronic Daily Tension Headaches,Nausea and loss of appetite for first 3 weeks taking Cymbalta. Insomnia_ loss of sex drive_ and hot flashes during the whole time taking Cymbalta.,My doctor put me on Cymbalta 3 years ago to help with the chronic daily tension-type headaches I've been dealing with for 7 years. I started with 30 mg daily. The first 3 wks of Cymbalta made me very nauseous and I had no appetite. Cymbalta started to help with my headaches after about 2-3 months. It decreased the severity of the headaches and obviously put me in a better mood. But after about a year_ I noticed a decrease in effectiveness so my doctor bumped me up to 60 mg daily. The increase in dosage didn't provide as significant relief as when I first started the drug. During the time I was on Cymbalta_ I experienced frequent hot flashes_ insomnia_ and a complete lack of sex drive. Last month_ I talked to my doctor about switching to another antidepressant because my headaches have gotten worse again. She switched me directly over to Prozac 20 mg claiming I shouldn't have any withdrawal side effects. Unfortunately_ I have had horrible nausea that comes and goes_ worse headaches_ and mood swings and irritability for the last month. I decided to get off the Prozac 6 days ago. I stopped it cold turkey (even though that's never recommended for antidepressants) because Prozac has a longer half-life than most so it has a more natural tapering effect. So far still feeling crappy. The nausea comes and goes.

553, 1, Fibromyalgia,All over numbness_ extreme fatigue_ foul smelling flatulence_ excessive hunger_ disturbed sleep_ vertigo,I was given a free trial for 30 days by my doctor yesterday_ I took the first pill last night and did not take any of my other meds because I wanted to see its full effect solo. I woke up this morning and for the 1st time in about 4yrs I was able to get out of the bed and stand on my feet without cringing pain_ i cried with joy. Then as I walked I was dizzy_ then vertigo hit. I woke up at 5am_ never do I wake up in the middle of the night and i was so hungry but nothing tasted good so i went back to bed. I am up now and feel so exhausted and have no energy. My whole body is numb and its annoying_ my ankles still feel good tho but because my body is numb. This is unnatural to me to feel this numb and so tired. I am taking the med back to the pharmacy for them to dispose of. I read about the wean off period and I have gone thru that before with no plans to experience it again.

I have been having withdrawals and I completely stopped taking it 3 months ago.  I had to ween off of it over a period of about six mos. with the help of a holistic doctor.  I believe that the supplements that she gave me helped decrease the severity of the withdrawals.  Now after being off_ I have nightmares almost every night.  It seems to pull the hidden fears out during your sleep and turn them into nightmares.  I have never had a problem with this before and read about the night terrors that others have had.  Also_ I get angry very easily and feel irritable a lot.  I started out with Lexapro about 8 years ago for depression and that stopped working_ so my doc put me on Cymbalta.  Every time I went for my physical_ I asked him about going off of antidepressants_ and his reply was ""if it's not broken_ why fix it.""  I believe that the doctors now are getting kickbacks from the pharmaceutical industry to get people started on these addictive drugs.  They don't warn you ahead of time what a horrible experience it is when you don't want to be on drugs any longer.  My depression was mild-moderate_ and I wish that I had never gone on any drugs at all.  I see a holistic doctor now and she is able to help me with my moods with natural supplements.  I am hoping that the nightmares will eventually go away.  I feel like I have permanent brain damage from this drug.

I begrudgingly allowed my Rheumatologist prescribe it for Fibro even though I had taken it several years ago and hated it. Weaning off this med is brutal. The best way to do it is work with your physician and establish a tapering down schedule. When you get below 30mg ask your dr. to prescribe lower dosages through a compound pharmacy as they can make it into 20 mg liquid doses x 5cc. The idea is you go down to 20 then 10 then 5 and voilá. It is not painless but it is definitely  more tolerable than just reducing doses to 30mg and skipping days.

After a few short days_ my fibromyalgia flared up severely and I ended up staying on 30 mg Cymbalta to try to reduce the pain.  Fast forward to Sept 2010_ I had an appointment with a new doctor who suspected something was wrong.  He had me check with my pharmacist & it turned out that Cymbalta was SEVERELY INTERACTING with 4 of my other prescriptions.  Unfortunately_ so much damage was done by this point.  During my gradual taper_ I experienced severe debilitating symptoms_ including physical_ emotional & cognitive impairment.  I became suicidal and I overdosed.

599, 5, Severe depression,At the beginning: constipation_ always: difficulty reaching orgasm_ slight dizziness and ear ringing occasionally. Waking up relatively early in the morning.,I was prescribed Cymbalta for severe clinical depression with strong suicidal thoughts. At first I had lexapro_ which didn't help me. Additionally I got Remeron to sleep. We quickly started from 30 mg to 60_ and after another week or so when no improvement was seen to 90 mg. About 10 days later_ my condition literally changed over night. Depression lifted_ suicidal thoughts went away and I could start climbing out of the darkness. About 1 month later I ha achieved complete remission and could go back to me job and regular life. I knew again what it means to be happy and have a positive outlook. Will continue to take it for another few months_ but stopped the Remeron. The only major side effect for me has been delayed orgasm_ Libido went back to normal after remission_ but reaching orgasm during sex is really hard_ which wasn't the case before. Going at it alone with some visual or literary stimulation interestingly helps a lot_ so it's not too bad. Also_ I tend to wake up around 6 in the morning_ regardless of when I go to bed. In the past I was more of a long sleeper_ going to bed late_ but have to change that now. All in all though Cymbalta is the right drug for me and really saved my life.

606, 4, Depression/Anxiety,Almost impossible to reach orgasm.  Felt castrated by this medication.  Uplifted mood_ more positive attitude were the key benefits for me.,Cymbalta is the only antidepressant medication that ever helped me. The first three days of taking it were like hell_ so much so that I nearly quit the medication from the very beginning. My pupils were dilated and I felt nauseous. A coworker asked if I was ok and said that I looked like I was about to puke. My doctor told me that it could take 4-6 weeks before I noticed any benefits and to give it a chance so I did. Pushed on through the first few rough days and after the first week I felt ok.  It was right after the 3rd week of being on the medication that I definitely noticed a positive benefit. I found myself just being in a more positive mood all the time_ which was a great improvement because just weeks before I was always in a more negative/down mood. The only side effect that I noticed was a big one - I almost couldn't have an orgasm and this caused relationship problems for my girlfriend and I.  When I finally did reach orgasm (and it took alot of work) it would be a very little one.  Also_ the semen that came out was a very small amount and seemed almost a different color and consistency than normal. I pratically felt castrated while taking the Cymbalta. After a year of the positive benefits and uplifted mood I decided to ween off of it and have not felt the need to go back on it since.  I would recommend talking to the doctor about gradually lowering the dose over a period of a couple of months.

I am a low risk person (no smoking_ low weight_ am on birth control) but I definately believe that my PEs were a result of the rapid decline in Cymbalta.  I did have a body rash (Malasezia) and other symptoms of my body experiencing a pH or general shift.  I also had a pleural effusion and was hospitalized for over a day.  It was very very difficult to get my pain under control - they had me maxed out on narcotics.  It was determined that the withdrawal of Cymbalta was giving me additional muscle spasms/tinges and I went back on 30 mg of Cymbalta to help with my level 12 pain - and it worked...

I got really nauseous the first day...I actually dry heaved...but I have a prescription for Zofran and that seems to really help.I have basically no appetite_ but I am ok with that as my depression caused me to gain 50 lbs which I am trying to lose. The jaw clenching is beyond annoying though...I feel like I need to walk around with my mouth wide open to avoid doing it...hoping that will go away. But I do feel better_ more energy_feeling hopeful about life for the first time in a long time. For the record...seeing so many negative comments initially scared the hell out of me...I would never say that a drug was poison and no one should take it...everyones body is different and your doctor prescribed you something because he/she felt that the benefits would outweigh the side effects. All ADs take time to get used to...all drugs have side effects. I would hate for someone to second guess their doctor because of something they read online. If you don't trust your doctor_ then you probably need to see a new one.,F,29,5  days30mg 1X D,3/12/2011Email,Cymbalta

I don't get so emotional over silly things_ my thinking is clearer and I use better judgement when making decisions.

This last week I got the flu and couldn't get my prescription filled_ I didn't take it for five days. By day two I had headaches and the worst dizzy spells I have ever had. It wad like my brain and vision shook for a few seconds and then a weird tingling sensation would radiate from my chest to my finger tips. It also made me depressed again when previous to this I had been feeling good for a long time. It made me decide to and plan to leave my partner for no reason! That's when I started looking up the side effects of coming off Cymbalta and saw the horror stories...

637, 2, Neck_ shoulder pain and numbness,I started this with great expectations. After the first two days I thought I had found my cure without surgery. However_ I started having problems around day 4. Upset stomach_ GERD_  loss of appetite. Then the diarrhea started and the cramping and pain followed. I ended up in the ER after suffering for 3 days with the pain. I was diagnosed with Colitis. The diarrhea has not stopped yet_ and my pain specialists does not believe that the Cymbalta was the problem. I believe it was/is and I will not take it again.  I cannot afford to with all the new doctors and medical bills.,I thought this was going to be my answer to help me off the pain meds_ but it made me sicker and in more pain.

I have learned NOT to miss a dose when traveling of for other reasons as this causes a revisit of pain increase. If lack of meds is coupled with other fibro-triggers such as stress or lack of sleep_ I have a full fibro flare-up.

I don't want to have the withdrawals.  I read about the withdrawals and I felt that the advantages of the drug did not outweight the side effects.

640, 1, depression,nausea_ complete loss of appetite_ weight loss_ extreme anxiety_ agoraphobia_ exhaustion_ mental fog,I only took it for a short period of time because of my extremely  severe and negative reaction to the meds. It scared me from ever taking another anti depressant and made me far worse.  Take with extreme caution.  I had my first panic attack 30 mins after first pill at work (I have never had anxiety issues) and then panic attacks every 3 hours (delayed release of pill) despite taking it at night to try to sleep off the initial effects of the pill. Due to the panic attacks_ I started to disassociate because couldn't call out of work or go home. Made me completely consumed and unproductive.  Tearfulness reappeared two days in because of anxiety. Some do fine on it.  No side effects getting off of it_ just return to tearfulness and relief from any anxiety.  My brain said NO! to this one. A side note to all those who suffer from anxiety naturally_ I do not know how you do it.  I became a sleeping hermit because that was the only way I could deal with it.

I'm colder than normal. But_ I would recommend trying this when nothing else seems to work. I am happier with it than without it_ and am starting to feel better.

Had to quit or lose my job.  Even cutting capsules and taking 10 mg a day caused me to fall asleep at work.  Stopped suicidal ideation. Stopped almost all ideation of any sort hah.

I think the meds work okay_ but quite frankly_ I'm prepared to say that they aren't all that great. Since my suicide attempt in late '09 I've started using MMJ and I go in for regular shock treatments every 8 weeks. Now those two things have been very effective. I've given up alcohol (I never drank that much)_ and the benzo's the psychiatrists were prescribing_ and I don't take/need pain killers anymore I don't live in agony any more and I rarely think of suicide. I've been chronically depressed since I was a teen and it has worsened over time. I told you all of that to tell you this. I'm afraid to stop taking the anti-depressant cocktail I take even though I doubt that it is that effective. Even one day without Cymbalta brings on pretty severe depressive symptoms. Some of that may be because I'm on such a high dose although I've been on as high as 180mg a day for a few years. If I had it to do all over again_ when it seemed clear that medications were only marginally effective I would have added MMJ and if it didn't improve_ I would have gone to ECT (the PC term for shock treatments) much earlier.

The side effects all stink_ and the things such as weight gain (I've gained at least 20 pounds!) and gas really effect my self esteem. I'm thinking about trying to switch mess again...

I came to this site to find tangible_ objective side effects_ and it saddened me that this page has become a conglomeration of people's personal opinions about meds. I endured many of the same side effects from many of the drugs in this category_ but I would never say NEVER take this or that drug. People are all different_ and working closely with your personal doctor is the best recommendation. If you don't feel your doctor is knowledgeable or listening to you_ find a new doctor. I experienced potentially life threatening side effects from the recent use of Paxil_ thus my change to cymbalta (nausea_ vomiting_ decreased appetite_ syncopal episodes_ drastically decreased BP_ vomiting_ and severe fatigue) and so far during the week of my wean from paxil and start on cymbalta I have felt MUCH better.  As with ANY antidepressant_ NEVER stop cold turkey_ you WILL have terrible side effects. This is a given.

I'm currently coming off the drug which is resulting in insomnia_ vivid dreams and a bit of a lack of inhibition.

I have developed high blood pressure to the point they said I could have a stroke. I am a healthy 37 year old_ we eat good and are active. I never had this problem before but high blood pressure is a side effect. I thought my depression and moodiness was bad_ but now it's out of control. I cry sometimes for hours just because? My eye's hurt_ my eye balls..I can't find where that is a withdrawl effect but how long can withdrawl really take?  Dry mouth is terrible. The dentist is worried about what it is doing to my mouth & gums. Not to metion I could care less about sex.,Like anything else in life_ only you and your doctor can make the right choices but I really think the side effects are not worth it.

At what point are you clearly just reacting to the drug? My body clearly did NOT want this. The day started out ok. I took the Cymbalta at 9am and went to a meeting. By lunchtime_ my co-workers were making comments that I ""had too much coffee"". I was indeed hyper but couldn't control it. I was annoying to MYSELF! But_ I did feel quite happy. I was a little dizzy but nothing I couldn't handle_ and I did manage to drive myself home. By 7pm_ I started having crazy thoughts- like suicidal. I have NEVER had any sort or mental illness and I've never had any issues with clinical depression_ and here I was having suicidal thoughts and panic attacks. My husband returned home and looked at me strangely and asked me what I was ""on"". I told him I didn't feel right and he asked if I was drunk and said I was slurring. Soon after_ my hands and legs started shaking and I couldn't control it. A friend of mine brought me to the ER and they kept me for observation and said I was having a severe reaction to the Cymbalta.

The pharmacy filled the 60 mg and I took it for 4 days without noticing I was taking 60 mg. I started to feel extremely ill (nauseous_ dizzy_ confused) and looked at the bottle closer and saw it was 60 mg. I guess thats why my nausea was so extreme_ since I didnt wean myself on it. I started taking the 20 mg's and still felt the severe nausea. I stopped taking it altogether because my dizziness and nausea were so bad I almost went to the hospital a few times. It's been hard just getting through the day without having to keep laying down.

I am exercising and dieting and the pounds are still piling on.  Then there is excessive sweating.  If I am in the heat_ it is horrible.  I am totally drenched.

Felt much more uplifted and good about life.  Then severe twitching_ muscle spasms and insominia began.  Could not sleep with nerve twitching all over my body.  Also very low labido.  Am now weaning off.  Feel the general depression was easier to deal with than the jerky_ twitching_ spasms and lack of sleep....also worry whether it will ever go away!

Icing on the cake_ an unbelievably crappy withdrawal...4th week off and still getting occasional bouts of dizziness but at least the brain zap zaps spzls have stopped. Maybe not.,I have been on other SSRIs and SNRIs.  All had some side effects but none made my feeling so lousy_ in every way.  THIS IS A DIRTY DRUG.  I not recommend it to anyone.  TRY EVERYTHING before you resort to Cymbalta.  Yeah_ Depression Hurts but I never felt worse.  I couldn't really tell whether there was any effect on my depression because I felt never felt well.

725, 1, depression,Extreme overheating_ sweating_ and memory loss,This drug was originally prescribed for my depression because i also had extreme pain that could not be diagnosed.  Cymbalta did alleviate most of my depression symptoms_ but I became aware that I had NO feelings - no empathy_ sympathy_ sadness or joy.  I discontinued this drug over a year ago and I still suffer from profuse sweating and feeling overheated.  My memory is very bad.

I don't feel ""high"" or ""nervous"" with these first two doses.",I am always skeptical about new meds.  Maybe it's a way to offset any perceived placebo effect.  But_ I have not felt well in 7 days; weak_ joint pain_ extreme fatigue.  My Fibromyalgia has been in remission 2 years and it seems to have returned with a vengance!  Although_ Fibro never leaves you completely_ I do not ever remember it making my joints hurt this badly or this much fatigue.  So_ I not only saw my rheumatologist but my PCP to make certain that there is no other underlying cause for all of this.  She ordered a big blood draw and her nurse told me a lot about Cymbalta while filling the tubes.  Apparently_ patients in the practice are all responding favorably with great feedback.  I just don't want to do anything walking_ sitting_ lying are still very painful.  Since I started Salsalate at the same time_ I am not sure if the negative digestive effects are attributable to it.  Some of the side effects of Cymbalta will subside after a few weeks.  I have nothing to lose and must feel better or I will go bonkers.,F,61,2  days60 1X D,9/2/2010,Cymbalta

It has really helped with the depression and anxiety but am now finding that I feel 'flat' emotionally and am having more side effects. Find it very difficult to lose weight even on a low calorie eating plan. Intense sugar/salt cravings. Weird dreams. I want to go off the medication but my psychiatrist doesn't agree. The weight gain and exhaustion are more than I can take but I am so afraid of landing in a deep depression and becoming suicidal again.,F,59,3  years90 1X D,8/31/2010Email,Cymbalta

Worked like a truth drug telling people exactly what I thought about them and everything else but very calmly and to the point. Increased desire to consume alcohol.,No other side effects and the sex drive/performance issues leveled out to normal after a few months. The blatant honesty side effect was surprising at work_ home_ and with friends but was liberating for me personally. Way more social and easily engaged in conversation with friends and total strangers. Discontinuing this drug has been a big challenge for the past month. This is the worst side effect of all since life was really good while I was taking it.,M,47,1.5  years30 mg 1X D,8/28/2010,Cymbalta
734, 3, Depression - extremely suicidal,Inabailty to orgasm_ insomnia_ migraine headaches_ jaw clenching_ feeling 'wired' and speedy.,I found the drug very effective at lifting my mood and removing depression. I also found it made me feel more empathetic and connected to people_ something i had not felt for a very long time.I found that once the initial start up dose of 30mg was increased to 60 mg_ I suffered from migraines for a period of time. Eventually these went away. Also i found it very difficult to orgasm. This actually became worse the longer I was on the medication_ and in some ways the only way to have orgasm was to stop taking the medication for a day_ then wait till the next day to have orgasm. I also began to find it really hard to sleep_ and also felt too racy and speedy.I have recently stopped taking cymbalta -  even though the +ve on mood and disposition were very good_ I found not being able to orgasm_ sleep etc were making me want to stop taking the drug.Since stopping_ I definately am struggling again with mood_ and disposition...

737, 3, Neuropathy pain & depression,Increased depression_ lethargy_ fatigue_ sugar cravings_ night sweats,Initially_ I felt that my depression worsened- even though my nerve pain lessened.  It has been a difficult summer so I questioned how much of it was the medication vs.  situational depression.  It is always important to look at the big picture and not jump to conclusions about what may/may not be a side effect.  I was strongly encouraged to try to ride out the side effects_ as a nurse_ I know that these improve or disappate in time.  The night sweats decreased_ the fatigue continues- but I also work night shift and wonder if I am just getting burnt out.  I initially started with 60mg_ but intended to titrate off the medication_ so I slowly reduced my doseage to 30mg- where I currently remain.  I am feeling better and am beginning to feel like perhaps I should continue and see how things go.  I also am on Wellbutrin for depression.  I am not sexually active_ but think if George Clooney showed up... I might not care much.  I strongly encourage anyone trying this medication to not go off it without talking with your doctor about how to do so safely.  Also_ please give it a chance to work_ there will likely be side effects to most medications you try- but your body needs a chance to adapt to it and this can take 2-4 wks.  As I said_ I am stablizing- it has helped my nerve pain_ I am using the Neurontin I was on only once daily now for trigeminal nerve pain from a crushing blow.

When I was switched to the smallest dose possible_ I did much better.  The physical side effects were the worst the first two weeks_ but psychologically I felt a change from day one.  It's not a miracle worker and does not take away all my pain_ especially on a low dose_ but it helps me mentally balance so that I can focus on healing and managing my pain. Forgetting a dose does have side effects like nausea and dizziness and a major brain fog_ even on the lowest dose - don't forget doses and wean yourself off slowly if you're trying to quit! :),F,20,6  months20 MG 1X D,8/20/2010,Cymbalta

764, 5, Neuralgia_ Myofascial Pain Syndrome,nausea,Cymbalta is a wonder drug for me.  I feel so much better on it_ happier_ able to do activities I'd given up on.  The only side effect was nausea_ but that was mitigated when I changed to taking it at night.  I was on nortriptyline before which only took care of the shingles post herpetic neuralgia_ but didn't touch the sacroiliac joints nerve pain that came up after a 3 level lumbar fusion_ both are permanent nerve damage.  The Cymbalta took care of both excruciating types of nerve pain.  I also have myofascial fascial pain syndrome with trigger points in all major muscle groups.  The Cymbalta hasn't touched the major trigger point problems but it has resolved the smaller triggerpoints and fascial pain such as on my ribs and chest. I still have the bad dry mouth that we thought was from the nortriptyline.  But with the dry eyes and skin dryness_ we are beginning to think that's sjogren's syndrome.,F,56,5  months30 1X D,7/31/2010Email,Cymbalta

I have only been on Cymbalta for 10 days but I am already starting to feel so much better...I've gone years and years being depressed_ sometimes severe sometimes moderately. The disheartening thing is that the people who are most likely to post on sites like this are the few that have had bad side effects. However_ remember that everyone is different and out of ALL those taking this medication only 20-30% end up with severe side effects if any at all. Every person physiologically is different and processes meds such as Cymbalta differently. There is a balance...there are many who are taking this medication and have not had any side effects at all and even the ones that have_ it has been worth the side effects.

PLEASE_ if you are a male and have had similar experiences_ please contact me_ i'd like to discuss this with someone who has the same side effects as me and find out possible solutions_ etc.  overall_ i really do like cymbalta and don't see myself getting off of it any time soon.",M,41,3  months30mg 1X D,7/16/2010Email,Cymbalta

I no longer have suicidal thoughts (which i had lived with for fifteen years)_ I no longer am extremely anxious and negative. It has not helped my hypersomnia - I can still sleep for up to 14 hours a day. Am looking at changing my meds (I also take a small dose of Lamictal every day) as I am very unmotivated and slightly depressed at the moment but I think t could be to do with my life circumstances which aren't great right now.,F,34,2.5  years60 1X D,7/7/2010,Cymbalta

I experienced 3 weeks of hell going thru tests (mammogram_ ultrasound_ MRI & biopsy) to confirm it wasn't inflammatory breast cancer.

This medication not only gave me my life back but showed me what I had been missing my whole life. I have several food allergies and many of them affect my mood. I was very unsure at first but now I realize it was the best thing I could have done at the time. without it i could have hurt myself or someone else. Be very careful with taking  doses regularly because the side affects are severe. I was unable to take mine for days and was very frightened (something very wrong)the whole time without it especially when trying to sleep. This is a powerful drug and not for everyone but in my case it worked like a miracle. My family is in health care and I was raised learning about medicine. My feelings are that this drug is a double sided sword. The side affects can be controlled if you are careful and smart. If you will be gone TAKE EXTRA WITH YOU and have more just in case you run out. My lips were dry for a year after taking it.

Became extremely physically tired_ but could not fall asleep.  Severe headache that would not go away with over the counter meds.  If not for the insomnia and headache_ I feel Cymbalta would have been very beneficial to me.   Very disappointing.  I was directed by my doctor to stop taking it_ and was prescribed something else.  The headache and insomnia stopped within a day or so after I stopped taking it.

My doc prescribed Cymbalta and told me it would also help with the chronic pain.  At first the only side effect I had was the night sweats.  I had surgery for the discs and wanted off the Cymbalta because I was no longer on the pain meds.  My doctor advised against it but I weaned myself off anyway.  Did not have any problems weaning myself off although I had run out at an earlier point and had a severe anxiety attack.  I weaned myself off very slowly.  Night sweats and insomnia disappeared but my neck pain returned within days.  I had lost my insurance and could no longer affford the Cymbalta but I was able to get assistance through LilyCares and made the decision to go back on the Cymbalta for the pain.  It is worth the side effects to me.  I have found that taking fiber helps with the constipation although I take double the suggested dose.  Have not found anything to help with the night sweats.  I have tried several things to help with the insomnia but no luck so far.

When weaned off cymbalta to see if the side effects would stop and didnt these past two months I mentally crashed and so I am back on it but at the 30mg and I don't want to go higher this is a happy medium for me. Cymbalta is very expensive also and most insurances wont pay for it. I had to go thru LillyCares.com to get assistance to cover it. In addition to taking the Cymbalta again_ I discovered and my doctor agrees with me taking 1 probiotic_ 1 stool softner_ 1 colon cleanse tablet_ and digestive enzymes when eating per day immensely helps my digestive disorder and severe constipation I developed while being on Cymbalta.

I was angry_ agressive_ ready for and looking for a fight. I oozed hate. Severe night sweats_ severe daily hot flashes_ crazy 2 week + migraines_ drastic mood swings. If I wasn't pissed_ I was crying. No in between. I was diagnoised with POF (early menopause). I was given 60mg of Cymbalta by my Nurse Prac. B/c she wanted me to start slow_ I was advised to take one every OTHER day for two weeks then one a day. One every other worked so well_ I was scared to mess with it. No night sweats_ no hot flashes_ no rage_ no mood swings_ no hate_ just me_ myself and I. It was THE MIRACLE PILL. I took it for a year_ every other day with absolutely no side effects and then quit. Cold turkey without any withdrawl symptoms. So I'm kinda shocked to see how everyone here has had such a hard time getting off it. Now I'm on it for anxiety and depression.  Today was my first 30mg dose in 4 yrs and Dr. wants me to take it every day. I have suffered from severe optical migraines since I was 10 years old.

This garbage should be administered with a RED FLAG. In order to fall asleep I require additional drugs including TRAZODONE and TEMAZAPAM to help enhance sleep. I am now HOOKED on TEMAZAPAM as I am on the Cymbalta.My next order of business is to once again come off Cymbalta and hopefully the Trazodone and Temazapam later on. I will pull the devil capsules apart and take some of the time release grains out. I will carefully log each week as I do this to mark my progress and side affects. I expect this will take many months. What a shame (or is a SHAM!). If I have any problems with this I will ask for a new Dr. since the one I have now does not care what he prescribes. I notice that most people who complain about this bastard drug do not comment on what they will then take once they get off of it. This is a good indication of how the side effects of this garbage tops everything else. This almost smacks of a class action lawsuit against Lilly for their poisoning us.

If I eat much of anything in the morning while I still have the mild nausea I will get diarrhea_ otherwise I have had some mild constipation but that usually only makes me take a little longer in the bathroom so I moved some books in there for reading (reading has always been difficult because of the lack of interest_ and excessive daytime sleepiness that would cause me to fall asleep repeatedly and become disoriented). My general level of anxiety has dropped quite a bit. I still recognize some of the thoughts and feelings I had before_ but they no longer keep me from being able to do things as simple as taking a walk and it is much easier to communicate.

802, 4, Anxiety/Depression/Panic Attacks,Muscle Twitches/Spasms,I feel so much better now- I used to get anxiety/panic attacks anywhere from 5-10 times a week ever since before I was diagnosed at 11 years old.  In my life I have had 2 suicide attempts (the last one was about 14 years ago).  My anxiety manifests itself in fits of anger_ tears or total introversion.  It has also come through as mild OCD compulsions:  locking my car 7 or 8 times_ dusting Everything every single night for about 2 hours_ folding and refolding clothes etc.  Since I started taking it_ within about 2 weeks I noticed a difference.  When I explained to my husband after a month that I could not take it anymore because it was too expensive_ he INSISTED that I stay on it.  HE said that he and my boys noticed a dramatic difference and that they hoped it stayed that way.  So- I am back on and I feel better than I have in many many year....,F,32,2  months20 1X D,6/4/2010,Cymbalta

Of course we all know what we were without meds and what we are now is such a difference. I do feel more normal on meds_ not as paranoid and I dont get uptight with the kids anymore. Im way more chilled. But I have a shocking memory now_ Im warm alot - eg I dont wear alot of clothes in winter_ and every morning I am nauseas. I hate the fact that Im not interested in sex anymore as I have been sexually active my whole life. Mind you I was also self sabotaging too. I just linked my weight gain to meds_ and I realised recently my anxiety prob caused me to be super skinny. Whilst I like my new round curves_ its a bit startling after 35 years of being skinny. When I startedon Cymbalta_ I got heart burn for 3-4 days_ and then nothing up until a week ago and now severe heart burn. I have only run out twice and those days were a nightmare. Dizzyness_ nausea and other symptoms others were talking about. So I might go back to my doctor and see if I can go down to 30mg and see if the sex drive pics up and the weight gain and  heartburn slows down. But yes_ as mentioned before - not the best drug to run out of! YIKES. I used to take cypramol_ and when I ran out of that_ I didnt notice any side effects like Cymbalta.

It took me a full 12 weeks to fully realize how delusional I had become (as opposed to moderately depressed but not delusional_ before taking Cymbalta.) Hm_ what else_ yes...I was also missing meetings! My career was at an all time low! I kept getting fired. (But I was happy_ well sort of.)If you have the time and inclination to become an artist however_ this may be the drug for you. It really works great on depression.

She had given me the 50mg samples but on day 2_ I had to call the doctors office. The first day I was extremely cold (I was freezing while wearing a sweatshirt on a 85 degree day)_ felt sick to my stomach_ and couldn't eat anything. All I could do was sleep and shiver.  The second day I was still cold_ couldn't eat_ but the nausea turned into vomiting.  What really sacred me was that my heart started racing & fluttering. This sparked a panic attack & something that felt like an asthma attack.  I'd started Cymbalta at 7am Monday morning and by 3pm Tuesday I was on the phone with the doctor who lowered my dose to the smallest possible.  Then I took a 10mg pill and STILL had chills_ loss of appetite_ extreme drowsiness_ and a racing heart.

I sleep constantly and don't want to do anything. I am going to stick with it because my doctor says I need to give it a good try. Maybe I need to switch from taking it in the am to pm.

It even helped me sleep better and I actually enjoyed the vivid dreams.  In any case_ after about a week and a half_ I didn't feel all that great anymore.  Still okay_ but not great.  Weird_ because this is about the time when these types of pills are supposed to START to work.  Anyway_ it is the only pill of this type that I have stuck with_ because I actually felt better with it (at first).  By the time I visited my doc on the 7th of this month_ I just felt 'eeeengh' (oh_ and I had gained weight).  He has now placed me on 60mg_ and when I asked him for something for weight loss_ said that these pills actually help lose weight.

828, 5, CFS/FM,Excessive drowsiness the first 10 days.  Spent most of that time sleeping. No drowsiness now.  Dry mouth_ slight dizziness on occasion.,This medication has been a Godsend.  I was diagnosed with CFS in 1995 which has morphed to FM.  CFS/FM robbed me of life. I was always hesitant to commit to anything_ not knowing how I was going to feel or how the activity would affect me.  Though the FM pain was gone_ the first 10 days on this medication was rough.  I was so incredibly drowsy_ sleeping most of that time.  The day I had planned to call the doc to tell him I couldn't handle the trade off_ I felt a little bit better so I held off on making the call.  I am so glad I did. Within a few days I had my life back.  I've pushed this drug to the limit by spending the last two weeks in the yard doing much neglected landscaping (moving rock & dirt_ planting plants_ etc.) without the typical crash and burn affects. Normally an hour or two of this type of activity would wipe me out for 2-3 days. The AZ heat normally wipes me out as well. I have also noticed that my joints don't pop like rice krispies anymore and my mood is much improved.  I never realized just how much my mood was affected by my pain.  I'm smiling_ joking_ loving and laughing again.  My family and I are amazed at my energy level now.  I understand this medication is not for everyone. In fact many of the comments here almost discouraged me from continuing it_ after researching the drowsiness I was experiencing at that time.  I'm so glad I didn't stop due to others experience.

Pain has significantly reduced but this is when the sleepiness & lack of energy kicked in.  I thought maybe it was because I was taking it so late at night (10 - 11pm) & then having to get up at 6am_ so last night I took it at 8:30pm & feel much better than previously.  I've only taken one short nap at work so far today & my yawns have been normal.  Must admit most of the negative comments on here have scared me. I'm blessed that my Dr. did warn me about stopping cold turkey & to let him know if I want to stop & he'll wean me off.  He also told me the co-pay for Cymbalta is expensive.

However_ after trying two other medications_ Cymbalta had the only side effec that I could see myself coping and dealing with--so i went back on it.During this second go-around_ I only take the medication at night (versus the last time i was taking it in the morning).  I find this works so much better.  I can ejaculate at night_ but not in the morning.  Maybe the drug has worn off a bit at night_ not sure why.

I no longer feel helpless_ hopeless or like I don't want to go on.  My negative thought that race in my mind have diminished greatly.  Part of this improvement is due to I am sleeping and part may be due to the sunshine and time.  I have tried Lexapro and Wellbutrin XL first with no improvement in my mood. The depression is gone_ no more crying spells but I still have some anxiety.  I have also been on hormones as much of this may be menopause related.

851, 4, diabetic neuropathy in both feet,I was concerned Cymbalta affecting REM sleep_ actually blocking people from having REM sleep_ and that's not a good thing at all. My doctor at the time assured me that it doesn't happen to everyone_ only some people. I could not find out a straight answer on the net_ all conflicting. Before_ I had been on Lyrica and gained about 40 pounds because of it. After a few months I went off Lyrica because of the weight gain_ and started Cymbalta_ then got freaked out over the REM issue and went cold turkey. What a strange trip it's been! I have never done illegal hard drugs_ but I tell you that going off Cymbalta cold turkey is probably the closest you can come. I was having lucid dreams every night. I could control what i was doing and remembered everything _ every detail the next morning. I wrote about it in a public blog and a man from Arizona asked me to come out to Arizona_ he was researching and teaching people how to induce lucid dreams! LOL  I never took him up on it. I told him it,I didn't gain weight as with other meds for diabetic neuropathy such as Lyrica and now possibly Savella. Cymbalta allowed me to sleep because before it_ many nights my diabetic neuropathy was so bad that I could not sleep. Does it cause loss of REM sleep in all patients? I would appreciate an answer. thank you.,F,48,6  months30 MG 1X D,4/17/2010Email,Cymbalta

I was also living through an extremely difficult time with serious personal issues.  Not sure if I were depressed because I could function and quite well. I did however feel sad a lot and cried easily. I tried several anti depressents with my family doctor and my therapist_ and all make me feel brain dead.  But with Cymbalta I just felt level. No mood swings_ just level.  I would stay on it forever_ but now that I am retired I can not afford it.  Can anyone comment on ""getting off"" the pill?",F,66,5  years30 1X D,4/14/2010,Cymbalta
855, 3, Depression/Thyroid/Fibromyalgia,Anxiety; increased depression seeing grey skies (weird); paranoia; nightmares; itchy feet; disturbed menstrual cycle,I've been on SSRIs in the past but_ they've never helped.  Started on 30mg Cymbalta for 2 weeks and then up to 60mg for the last 6 months.  I feel a bit better in terms of handling my problems better and it has increased motivation (I didn't have any before).  It's also been good for my Fibromyalgia (muscle pain). But_ my menstrual cycle is lasting up to 2 weeks in which 7 days is a really heavy period!!  Mentioned this to the Psychiatrist and she said it's nothing to do with the medicine.  I've started to miss a dose to try and bring the medicine down gradually.  So far I've been alright as I'm only missing one dose a week.  I'll start to miss 2 doses a week and see what happens.  I don't know what to do and am trying so hard to be 'normal' - whatever that means!!  I wish there was more help out there.,F,38,6  months60mg 1X D,4/14/2010,Cymbalta

My hair would be drenched by the time I got to work in the morning - even with the AC on in the car. Doc put me on something for that and it worked during the day but I wake up nightly with soaked clothes. I thought I could deal with it but after 4 months_ I am feeling the exhaustion of not getting full nights' sleep.

860, 4, dysphoria_ depression,initial side effects lasted a week or so - bug eyed_ dizzy_ nausea - just like with any anti-Dep.  The lasting ones: decrease in appetite_ change in food cravings - from carbs to sugar - down 2 sizes :) this is a weird one...when i would find insects and spiders in the house_ i would kill them.  now i either leave them alone_ or take them outside to a spot i think they would like - i said it was weird! when i forget to eat_ i get the shakes - low blood sugar.  my finger pads seem wrinkly - like a person forty years older than me.,I have gone the fruit route - i will eat 4-5 apples/oranges/pears in one sitting_ no diarrhea or constipation. Takes care of the sugar craving - i used to eat vegies lots and hardly any fruit_ now it's reversed.  Also eat less meat - kind of grosses me out now - but i crave pecans_ almonds etc...Increased mood SUBSTANTIALLY - although still very reactive around menstruation.  Sometimes feel JOY - dancing around the house_ energetic_ feel good about myself_ most times just feel balanced_ calm. Much improvement from the suicidal ideation_ dysphoria_ depression..bit borderline too_ and obsessive negative self thoughts...it's the FIRST antiDep i've tried where there's a POSITIVE difference! From the sounds of the other posts_ it doesn't have this effect on everyone.  I would encourage you to speak to your doctor right away if some of those really bad side effects occur - this drug is so new_ there's no long term studies on it_ so we don't know how it reacts with different symptoms_ different physiology.  For me_ i noticed within 2 days that the rumination was all but ceased.  I've never noticed any previous AntiDep's effect until well over a month (prozac_ effexor_ celexa and wellbutrin combo)and none of them has actually made me feel GOOD about myself.,,35,9  months60mg 1X D,4/11/2010Email,Cymbalta

So far_ so good!,I was admitted to a Mental Health Clinic where the urinary retention became worse one night and I had to be taken by ambulance to a local hospital.  They did a bladder scan and had to insert a catheter to drain off over 1000ml of urine.  At 5 in the morning_ I was discharged and had to walk back to the Clinic as I had no phone or money.

I felt in control_ the panic attacks stopped_ and my worry ceased. However my depression slowly crept back in. Cymbalta did manage to keep my Anxiety under control_ and Panic attacks were Non-Existent but I was still sad. I didn't care about anything and I felt like an emotionless zombie. I wanted zero sex and that bothered me a lot. I thought more about the fact that I wasn't thinking about sex more often than I actually thought about sex. I was tired ALL the time_ I did not want to get up or do anything and I gained almost 30 lbs within that few months. HORRIBLE withdrawal now. Brain zaps ceaselessly_ I get dizzy whenever I walk_ and my limbs become weak. I can't sleep more than a few hours before waking up and I'm having nightmares. I'm praying that my brain returns to normal and this stops. Every time I move too much and the dizziness and brain zaps become too much I want to break down and cry so bad. I just want it to stop. My libido is back though_ and I don't feel like a complete zombie.. but that doesn't help me much since I'm suffering from the withdrawal like this. For SOME people it might be a godsend and I wouldn't turn your back on it based on ANY of these reviews (even mine) because if you need something to help you suffer less_ then it's worth a try_ just be prepared for the tough road to coming off of it.,F,29,3  months90 mg 1X D,4/6/2010,Cymbalta

Currently: Dry mouth_ increased appetite_ night sweats_ gas_ abnormal dreams_ confusion/difficulty waking from sleep_ and occasional stoned/numb feeling. After missing a dose: all symptoms increase severely_ and I also get extreme nausea and headaches.,Around the time of starting Cymbalta I also made many other changes in my life to try to overcome my depression and anxiety such as healthy appetite_ decreased stress_ consistently taken vitamins (Omega3_ multi-vitamins ex.) and I began taking amino acids for anxiety so I am still to this day unsure of how much the Cymbalta actually helped me. But the combination of all these changes helped me immensely to get rid of my depression and decrease my anxiety. I only side effect that has really been effecting my life is the strange vivid dreams_ because I will often wake in the morning completely confused thinking that the dream was real or thinking that my dream life was my real life or I will have difficulty waking because the dream is so fascinating that I forget I'm sleeping and think its an awesome movie. I have had dreams that go on for over 6 hours in which I can remember every little detail which really creeps me out.

There were times where it made me feel even more anxious than I already was.  The one thing I did notice is it controlled my ruminating which was a bit of a relief.  However_ I felt no better in regards to my depression.  Now I have to go through the hell of withdrawl for another two weeks.

Hard to orgasm but when I do it is earth shattering with noticeable afterglow. Everything is numbed_ not just fear. Headaches.  Focus problems. Jolty peeing (urinary incontinence). Stoned feeling. Tired. Vivid bad dreams that don't scare me much so I don't wake up. Weight gain (from eating). I seriously just stared at the floor for about 40 seconds_ see focus problems. More insecure. More lonely. Need loads of sleep.,My day before the pills went like this: I woke up afraid in general and went to the bathroom_ then sat on the computer bored of everything. Crying almost every day.Now I get up and I'm dizzy. I take a pee that takes several minutes (starting and stopping uncontrollably_ also staring at nothing when I am finished) and go back to bed. After some messed up dreams and about 12 hours later I am up and excited about the 12 things I plan to do (badly) at once. Still can't leave the house.,F,29,60  days60mg 1X D,3/13/2010Email,Cymbalta
889, 4, depression,Begining: helped immediately with my depression symptoms but felt a weird/ relaxed/ buzzed/ kind of numb yet not sad sort of feeling.   During: weight gain and very extreme loss of libido. Getting off cymbalta: headaches_ mood swings_ severe dizzy spells.,It definitely helped my depression.  No question. I was started on the 30 MG then after two weeks went up to the 60 MG.  It gave me a weird/ relaxed/ slight drunk/ numb yet happy feeling when I began taking them_ but my body adjusted rather quickly and those feelings didn't last too long.  I have now been on cymbalta for 8 months and do not feel like I need them anymore_ so I stopped taking them. Also_ I have put on a significant amount of weight but I do not know if I can fully contribute the weight gain to Cymbalta.  I tend to not be able to eat much if I am servery anxious or mentally unstable_ like during this depression I experienced.  My life has drastically changed (for the better) within the last few months and I feel that I am eating more stable.  Plus_ I changed my birth control around the same time as I got on cymbalta therefore I feel like my weight gain might be a number of contributing factors.  My weight has always fluctuated my entire life. Going off cymbalta_ I have experienced awful headaches_ sever mood swings but those have seem to pass.  I am now experiencing random dizzy spells_ some relatively severe. I run and workout and it makes me slightly concerned to continue with these dizzy spells.,F,25,8  months60 MG 1X D,3/12/2010History,Cymbalta

Some nausea in early days.  In second week_ the sweating started...unbelievable! Totally drenched at times throughout day and night_ withour rhyme or reason ie just relaxing and sweating would start...sweated through pillows_ clothes...very embarrassing at times. I had to carry paper towels in bag to dry my wet hair_ especially around neck and face. I am being weaned off cymbalts_ then doc will try something new.  Look_ I don't expect anti d's to be totally side effect free...but the excessive perspiration was unbearable.,F,60,3  months60 1X D,3/12/2010Email,Cymbalta
891, 5, Fibromylagia/ depression,The first day I had an upset stomach_ fever_ trouble sleeping. I have lost my appitite and if I eat too much I feel sick_ also I feel a little buzzed most of the time- but not enough to slow me down (worth it),I was given 30 MG to take daily but the first day I felt so over medicated that I decided to open the pills and empty out half - this has worked great for me. My depression is gone_ I can walk and drive with no pain at all- I have ben suffereing from fibro for years and NOTHING has worked as well as this medication. I was scared to take it after reading so many reviews about aweful side effects_ but I finally broke down and took it- my advice is that if you feel over medicated or super ill after the first 24hrs_ take less (Im not a Dr so I dont know if that is safe but it seems reasonable to me) I am so happy with the results so far- I really wish I had been on this years ago- it would have saved me alot of pain.,F,25,4  days15 MG 1X D,3/11/2010,Cymbalta

But it subsided to more or less back to my ""normal"" ibs symptom. Then some nausea_ dizziness_ and blurred vision_ but nothing terrible.  These effects were mild but I could feel them. If I skip a day the side effects seem to lessen.",Both my primary and GI docs want me to try this to relieve my anxiety and depression brought on by 2 plus years of ibs symptoms that will not go away_ the worst of which is chronic abdominal pain. They told me it is good for both pain and depression/anxiety.  So far no change in the ibs pain. I do notice a lower anxiety level_ but I can't deal with the abdo. pain_ I hope this helps.  I wanted to post because I saw that someone asked about 20 mg. doses -YES_ they DO make it in 20 mg.

898, 1, Depression,dry mouth_ insomnia/vivid dreaming_ anxiety_ confusion_ dramatic negative mood change ending in suicidal thoughts.,I was diagnosed with depression almost 40 years ago and have been periodically treated for it with limited success. Following a truly horrific crash_ my former psychiatrist (a horror story in its own right) prescribed Cymbalta after a series of other anti-depressants in combination with various anti-psychotics failed to make a dent in the depression. About two weeks after starting the drug_ my mood took a sharp turn for the worse. I became rapidly and progressively more anxious_ confused and depressed. My idiot doctor told me to ride it out and those symptoms would go away_ and her idiot patient believed her. Instead_ about two weeks after I started to go downhill I wound up voluntarily committing myself for three days because I became suicidal. The psychiatrist at the hospital stopped the drug and about a week later my mood began to improve somewhat_ but it took about six months for me to get back to where I was_ which wasn't all that great_ before I took the drug. Everyone's experience is different_ but that was mine. I hate the stuff.,M,55,30  days60 mg 1X D,3/5/2010,Cymbalta

We weren't made to have all of these chemicals in our bodies.  It is amazing when you get rid of this stuff_ how reduced pain can be.  I never expect to be pain free but am trying to change my life to pace differently and not have to be ""Superwoman"" any longer.  Medications can poison you and many of you sound as if this did just that.  I'm not going through that again.

Doctor wwitched to Cymbalta to help with my fibro which was causing me alot of pain. I found Cymbalta definitely helped my fibro pain. The first few days of taking it_ I felt okay. But it definitely messed with my sleep. I woke up every night at 2:00 am_ and couldn't go back to sleep for 2 hours. I did not suffer from insomnia previously. This side effect did not change for me throughout the month of being on this. Also had no libido whatsoever from day one_ cymbalta killed it. Didn't have this problem on celexa. After the second week of taking this_ I then went from feeling happy_ to feeling zombie-like. Like I was in a mental fog_ and felt out of it. I got angry at the slightest thing_ which is not normal for me. While this drug did help my fibromyalgia_ it did not help my depression. Also gave me really weird_ scary dreams every night.

905, 4, anxiety and depression,Like most drugs of this type_ there are side effects when first starting such as insomnia_ tired feeling_ sweating_ and these can be bothersome. Believe me they do go away after a week and it is definatly worth hanging in there. I was on this med for 2 years and foolishly decided to stop. Without noticing_ I fell back into a major depression. See additional comments.,I just restarted Cymbalta after being off of it for 6 months. I started using 60mg per day almost 2 years ago for anxiety and slight depression. Wow I had no idea how well it was helping me until I stopped taking it. Within a month_ I went into a severe depression. I tried starting Cymbalta again_ but developed annoying side effects. I tried 6 other SSRIs and had the same trouble. I thought I was going crazy. My Dr could not figure it out. He knows me and was shocked that I had become so severly depressed and intolorant to everything. I had always taken Xanax as needed for Panic_ and even Xanax stopped working. Anyway_ Dr prescribed Lyrica which is rather new for depression_ and although it slowly helped_ I developed a rash from it even at a low dose. He next tried Lamictal_ and after tapering up for over a month_ at 150mg per day I was feeling slightly motivated to leave the house_ but the med made me short tempered_ nasty_ did not help anxiety and the crazy side effects like acne_ weight gain_ mouth sores etc. were not worth the benefit. The worst part of Lamictal was how manic it made me. I think Lamictal is probably great for Bi-Polar disorder_ but I am not bi-polar. Anyway_ Out of desperation_ I decided to force myself to deal with the side effects of starting the Cymbalta again. The first night was hell not sleeping_ stomach ache_ dizzyness blah blah. I am so happy to report that after a couple of days telling myself_ Just deal with it_ I am starting to feel great again,M,41,5  days30 mg 1X D,2/28/2010,Cymbalta

The drug has been nothing but an inconvenience for me. I'm an extremely active individual_ and thought process at my job is critical throughout the work week. By missing one dose of this medication_ you sacrifice an entire day's worth of work_ as you're completely paralyzed from thinking critically. If that doesn't deter you from taking the drug_ tag on the inability to perform sexually. This_ along with lack of motivation to take on any responsibility whatsoever are the reasons I've decided to come off the drug. I blindly listened to my doctor without researching the consequences.

916, 1, Pain,Depressed_ angry_ lost_ personality change,My husband had Cushings which resulted in high levels of pain from neuropathy & osteoarthritis. His endocrinologist prescribed Cymbalta. At 60mgs all his pain left. It was amazing. Almost immediately he became depressed_ angry. He stopped working_ could not sleep or hardly drive. He was lethargic; he would just say_ I dont know like somebody lost. Sometimes he could not eat. His memory was all but gone. It was HORRIBLE!  So I started researching the side effects and found this website. I was totally shocked!  People were describing the same side effects he was suffering from. When I told him how it was the drug that was doing these things to him he got angry with me. I could not reason with him at all. (He was mostly unaware of what was happening to him.) To make a long story short his doctor thought I crazy_ but I was determined to keep fighting for him. A second doctor suggested he drop the dosage. Are you kidding me_ my husband has lost his mind and you want to keep him on this mind-stealing drug?  However_ the lower dosage did the trick and_ almost immediately_ he started getting his mind back. He suffered bad withdrawals but came off of it completely. It has been over a month & he is back to normal. He still suffers from pain but nothing compares to what Cymbalta put them through. The drug company has sold this horrible drug as a wonder drug to doctors. Some of them_ doctors_ believe the drug company over patients.  Don,M,51,4  months60 1X D,2/20/2010Email,Cymbalta

When I try to tell him the med is not working.That it has ALTERED HIS PERSONALITY 100%. He tells me it has changed his life for the better and nothing but good came from it. When it has not it has taken him out of depression yes. However it has stole him of his sense of responsibility_ his priorities are 100% reversed_ he has had major amnesia episodes from misplacing the car to spending sprees he did not recall doing. to this day he believes his car was stolen and i was the one who spent the money. when in fact he was the one who did these.  He refuses to talk to his doctor regarding the changes his family and friends have noticed in him.he is very confrontational with family and strangers. he says very inappropriate things. He has a strong sense of entitlement. Just the other day he was opening fire hydrants because he felt he was entitled to because he was the one who dug the out from the snow. He talks at length about nonsensical things. Other days he is so manic he can't stop moving. I believe CYMBALTA HAS STOLEN THE HUSBAND AND FATHER WE HAVE ALL GROWN TO LOVE. PLEASE RECONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS PRIOR TO TAKING THIS LIFE ALTERING DRUG!!!!!!!!!!! I JUST WANT MY HUSBAND BACK AND FOR MY DAUGHTER TO HAVE HER FATHER BACK TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

My sex drive was making me become a nymph and I ended up having sex in my office. Got caught and fired. Be cautious if you are starting this pill about the hidden side effect of thinking you can do anything.

Any thoughts of harming yourself--call 911 immediately and accept medical treatment graciously.  In withdrawal_ insist on very close medical supervision_ hang in there_ and vow not ever to take mind-altering medications ever again. I'm now presented with a second chance at living and I do not intend to throw it away.  If nothing else_ I shall be happy to be living and welcome being able to fix my mistakes and my family and best friend's forgiveness for being so bitchy and vindictive to them.,F,44,6  months60 mg 2X D,2/11/2010,Cymbalta
927, 4, depression and anxiety,I felt that this was a wonder drug. I no longer had to use so much psychic energy to pull my mood up on a regular basis. However_ I have been slowly adding weight. Exercise doesn't seem to help at all. I have always been slender_ but now weigh what I did when I was nearly full-term in my pregnancies! It is about 10-15 lbs of excess weight. I also have a greater appetite and could sleep more. No insomnia. I also have some memory issues (words_ names_ etc.) but that could be my age. Libido is an issue. I find it harder to achieve an orgasm_ sometimes can't at all. My desire has flagged. This is disturbing to me. I also have urinary incontinence issues_ which I understand can be related to the drug.,I will be talking with my doctor and also the psychiatrist who has prescribed this for me. I am on a subclinical dose_ but that has been all I've needed. It has been nice to have my life be less exhausting_ emotionally_ and I have become much more successful in leadership and work areas as a result. It is a tough call for me_ but it may be worth discontinuing cymbalta (under Doctor's supervision) to see if some of my side effects subside and my mood stays more level. Tough_ tough call!,F,61,2  years30mg 1X D,2/9/2010,Cymbalta
928, 3, Anxiety/Depressions,spaced out_ difficulty sleeping_ headaches(shocks)_ night sweats,"For the first two weeks I felt very spacey and drugged_ a feeling similar to taking extasy. But after my body adjusted_ I did notice quite a difference in my anxiety_ and length of dressions bouts. I have suffered from anxiety (anxiety attacks)_ bouts of depression_ sadness and anger since I was a young teen. I am almost 30 and have tried several other medications which had much worse side effects and no positive effects_ such as: paxil and celexa. The only current side effect I have is the night sweats and I do get ""headshocks"" as I call them_ if I forget to take my pill on time.",F,29,1  years30 MG 1X D,2/9/2010,Cymbalta

931, 1, depression,being forgetful_ ANGRY_ sleepy_ weight gain_ lack of care.,The first time I tried Cymbalta_ I thought_ this might work even though it made me sleepy; I thought that symptom would go away. Not only did it not go away_ other things started to happen. I became very 'spacey' and forgetful of very simple things_ in the middle of conversations_ I would just forget what I was saying.  The worst for me though was the anger I felt. I am normally very mellow and avoid conflict_ however_ I found myself picking at people_ becoming so angry about everything.  Finally_ some dear friends and my husband let me know the changes they were seeing and thus started the decision to stop taking the drug.   It isn't worth it to me.,F,51,3  months20mg 1X D,2/8/2010,Cymbalta

Pronounced hair loss.,I was virile until I started Cymbalta.  Erections were rock hard and hair was thinning_ but was not bad.  Two year later_ It's hard to achieve an orgasm or even become erect at times.  It's hard to ween off Cymbalta_ as well.  I take this with Lyrica to help with nerve damage.  Both work well when combined for the pain.  Sex drive is still there_ but I need to take Cialis or Viagra to be a rock star in the bedroom again.,M,43,2  years30 MG 1X D,2/6/2010Email,Cymbalta

The little things that would make me depressed or sad before doesn't phase me as much.  I've noticed that I recognize the situation_ but the drug takes the edge off.  I fall asleep easier than before.  Generally_ I feel more content with people and situations.  I don't have thoughts of death or dying like before.  Now_ the bad:  I got a bad stomach ache the first day but it didn't happen after the second day.  The same goes for the nausea_ it seems to be happening less and less the longer I am on Cymbalta.  I get occasional brain zaps_ but it isn't too bad to where I would stop taking it.  I am able to have an erection with no problems_ but not able to orgasm.  I am not sure if it is the drug that makes me not too concerned with this sexual side effect as I would consider myself a very sexual person.  I am hoping that in time I will be able to orgasm like before_ but I don't know how long that will take.  If anyone has had success or advice on this side effect please email me.

This was hard as I have 2 kids_ work_ etc. However_ it really did subside after 2 weeks. My depression lifted and I felt like myself again. Hallelujah! We increased it to 60MG when I felt it tapering off. I have to admit I'm feeling a bit fidgety all the time now. I can't sit still for a second. It's subtle_ no-one else has noticed. But I do. I'm constantly moving. I've lost about 5 lbs_ too.

Psych Doc told me to take at p.m. Worked for about a month. I normally am warm in bed at night and warm even if I get out of bed. With this I am drenched in sweat. I get out of bed and am freezing. I am 5""6"" and weigh 130 lbs so I am not a big person. Psych Doc told me it is the serotonin increase from the Cymbalta that causes it.

937, 2, neuropathic pain (back pain),Worked GREAT on eliminating the neuropathic pain_ pins and needles feeling in my feet_ sciatic nerve pain down my left leg_ BUT side effects were extreme exhaustion and sleepiness_ lack of energy_ complete loss of sex drive_ loss of motivation in general.,"What a love/hate relationship I have with this drug.  It worked great on my pain_ but sucked the life out of me in so many other ways.  Every day was like struggling through a fog just to stay awake all day.  I finally got some pain relief for my back symptoms through combo of other treatments and was able to go off Cymbalta.  It has been like reclaiming my life after a long hibernation.  It *DOES* definitely work for pain_ though.  I've got to give it that!  Be forewarned:  Do not stop taking Cymbalta cold turkey.  There are specific steps to be followed and it is important to follow them_ otherwise Cymbalta withdrawal is quite unpleasant.  My Dr. had me step down off Cymbalta by substituting low doses of Prozac for a few weeks.  Interestingly_ I found that the Prozac worked just as well (for me) as the Cymbalta for the neuropathy and without any of the horrible feelings of being ""wiped out physically and emotionally"" that Cymbalta always gave me.  Cymbalta was horrible to me.  Not bad for a short period of time_ but as a long term drug_ I almost would have rather been dead.  Sounds dramatic_ but true.  I swear it *made* me depressed.  Also_ though_ I must admit that I have checked around and seem to be one of the few it affected this way (making me completely exhausted).",F,43,2  years,1/31/2010Email,Cymbalta

The other problem was I seemed to be so ""Happy"" that I procrastinated small projects and paper work.  In the past ""Mild"" anxiety made me successful.  No anxiety really slowed me down.  I have been coming off the drug but I am getting a little panicky at times and dont want to take Clonopine either because it makes me very tired.

945, 5, Depression/Back pain,Vivid and weird (but not scary)dreamsSignificant night sweatsNausea/vomiting and headaches if I forget a dosage. ,I tried many anti-depressants. I had various side effects and minimal results. My MD was almost out of options when Cymbalta came out. And she thought it would be a good match since I also had back pain. I was on it very early. It turned out to be the only one that gave me consistant relief and let me feel too_ rather than be flat. I find the dreams interesting (almost fun). The dreams get stronger if I change dosage or forget a dose. I have missed dosages at times and I get significant nausea and headaches. I don't consider that a problem however because if I ever discontinue Cymbalta_ I'll step it down slowly to avoid symptoms. The night sweats are significant_ but I always forget it's a side effect of Cymbalta and blame it on peri-menapause_ so I just feel like it's ok to live with it. Anyway_ I recommend Cymbalta_ but after seeing the comments I guess people really have different reactions so try it; especially if you didn't have good results with other anti-depressants_ but if it's not right; talk to your MD and get off of it.

I switched to Cymbalta after the others stopped working. The side affects I experienced when I started taking Cymbalta were mild as my body was already adjusted to anti depressant medication. Many of the severe side affects such as vomitting_ nausea_ restlessness_etc that people are describing happened to me the very first time I started taking an anti depressant_ which was at the time Lexapro. This is because my body was not used to the med and I had to wean myself onto the med. Instead of taking the whole dose_ start with a quarter for about 3 days then half the dose another few until you can handle the full dose. I almost gave up on lexapro because it made me sick at first but the severe side affects did stop.

My Rx was increased and after 4 more weeks_ (approximately 2 months) taking the medication I had been categorized as SEVERELY depressed.  I became very withdrawn_ aggitated and angry. Therapy was introduced and at 3 months of taking the medication I started feeling so anxious_ aggitated and upset that I started having uncontrollable lash outs where I felt like I needed to hurt myself to make myself.  These feelings began to become more frequent and more intense and very impulsive.  Because I feel like my condition has worsened I stopped taking the medication.

959, 1, Back Pain_ Depression,Cymbalta has the same adverse side effects of the other SSRI medications and then some. In fact_ because of Cymbaltas adverse emotional reactions_ the inherent inability to get an erection or orgasm that is more the norm in other SSRI medications appears to be even worse with this one. If that werent enough_ it increases anxiety and thus has less value as an anti-depressant. Yet what was even more profound_ I found that I was in a state of emotional upset at all times but wasnt aware of it until I stopped the medication 6 days ago. Bizarre sensations of profound guilt and regret about incidents from the past (childhood to adult)_ were constantly re-lived and extremely inflated to say the least. I found myself on the verge of tears at all times. To add to the constant emotional upset_ I can now attribute Cymbalta to frustrating memory lapses and a dramatic compromise in my cognitive abilities which I had mistakenly blamed on my pain medication. This drug caused me t,I have severe and chronic lower back pain with Fibromyalgia which resulted in my developing depression. Consequently_ I was placed on anti-depressants to counteract the side effects of pain medication_ and also because the constant pain sucked the life out of me. Initially I was on Effexor (YIKES!)_ but had to stop this drug after only a few days. Subsequently I was placed on Zoloft for several years_ then Celexa for several more_ and finally Cymbalta in an effort to decrease the SSRI side effects the first two medications had. Each time I switched drugs I had to stop completely to start the other. I had no adverse withdrawal side effects from either Zoloft or Celexa; however Cymbalta was a different story. I had tried several times before to quit Cymbalta but because of the extreme withdrawal side effects_ I was forced to stay on it. The evidence for me is irrefutable; Cymbalta has absolutely no redeeming value when compared to any other type of SSRI anti-depressant. In Fact_ I believe it should either be removed from the market or be deemed a controlled substance_ not because patients would be inclined to abuse this drug_ but that physicians are in an effort to improve mood and block pain without having to dispense pain medication. Even the most innocuous of prescribed pain medication has vastly more therapeutic value_ simply because Cymbalta has none. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG_ IT IS DANGEROUS. Cymbalta is a living nightmare_ avoid it.,M,42,14  months,1/6/2010,Cymbalta
960, 1, Pain_ Fibromyalgia_ Depression,A plethora_ (especially libido suppression none of which were therapeutic. It did nothing for anxiety_ and it tended to make me much more emotional than was appropriate at any given time. Also_ I cannot really tell if it had a better effect on depression. The withdrawal side effects are absolutely mind boggling and I dont believe most physicians are aware of the extreme dizziness_ mood swings_ etc. that correspond with cessation from this drug. If they did they would think twice about dispensing it.,I was taking Zoloft and switched because it allegedly was supposed to help with pain and have fewer side effects than Zoloft. However_ the pain didnt decrease at all and the side effects were just as profound as with any other SSRI. I realize it has been a Godsend to others_ however_ I wonder if these people had tried other SSRIs first in conjunction with other forms of pain management (even the mildest of prescription pain-killers like Ultram would be a much more effective choice). I wish I hadnt started this medication_ and I also believe that the representative from the manufacturer didnt convey the real truth about this drug to my physician. I tried to go off this drug several times; however I am a technician and could not afford to make even the smallest error.  I am now taking several months off from work_ (thanks to this drug) and Im taking advantage of this time to quit this abhorrent Medication. I have spoken with several people who have taken MOA anti-depressants for years_ and who (briefly) switched to this drug only to find it much less effective and with intolerable side effects then they were used to. Be very careful with this drug_ and consider other options for pain management_ and/or depression first_ its not worth it. Personally_ I believe the sole purpose of this drug is to generate money for the manufacturer_ and that because of its side effects and lack of effectiveness its not as expensive as,M,52,3  years,1/5/2010,Cymbalta
961, 2, depression_ anxiety,inability to orgasm_ dry mouth_ weird yawning_ jaw trembling_ mild weight gain_ increased migraines_ crying at the drop of a hat_ tired after taking pills_ mild constipation_ very dark stool,i'm taking 60mg in addition to 300mg of Welbutrin.  Several of the symptoms (jaw trembling_ yawing_ and crying) have diminished somewhat_ while others have gotten worse.  I have been unable to maintain and erection or achieve orgasm with my partner which has increased my level of anxiety.  Thankfully he is in the medical profession and completely understands.  The weird yawning and jaw trembling was intense in the beginning and was VERY reminiscent of taking Ecstasy pills back in my 20s.  I've also put on about 10 pounds.  I'm going to ask my doctor to take me off of Cymbalta at my next appointment.,M,39,2  months,1/2/2010Email,Cymbalta
962, 1, fibromyalgia pain,There is not enough room on this web site to describe the side effects or how dreadful this drug can be for those that do not have a severe depressive disorder or anxiety for which it was developed.  To press the boundaries and sell more drugs they have broadened the category of illness that cymbalata helps. Read the one and two stars for side effects plus do some research and you will use this drug with caution.,The first 6 months I took this drug I got a great deal of relief from the FM pain. I slept better and felt better.  After 6 months I had to increase the dosage to 60 mg to get the same benefit...but then the dreaded side effects kicked in.  The weight gain_ crazy thinking_ memory loss_ concentration problems_ loss of libido_ pain coming back like I was on fire_ and on and on. I did not get suicidal but I sure had anger issues that were like a personality change.  In fact looking back on those two years I was a different and not entirely likable me.  The other thing to know about SSRIs is that you cannot just stop them or the side effects are mind numbing like spacial disorientation_ dizziness_ vertigo_ nausia_ blurred vision_ pain.  It took me 1 full year and two times to get off this dreadful drug.  I had to keep going back on the 30 mg just to let my system calm down from the withdrawal.  There is something called SSRI withdrawal syndrome.  Look it up and you may think twice about this drug or if you want to come off of it know that for every year you have been on it you need about half that time to come off it.  Better yet try something else although I do understand that those with severe depression and anxiey have some major brain biochemistry challenges that only a major dangerous drug like this will help.  My sympathies are with you if you have to take this drug and realize several years into it that you have to keep increasing it or you start to experience side effects,F,60,2  years,1/2/2010,Cymbalta

I am now out of my 2nd serious relationship of my life and was having a breakdown. I was shaking_ not eating_ took 2 weeks off work_ was nauseated_ and unable to get out of bed or function. Cymbalta in my system for 2 weeks gave me the energy I needed to function again_ reduced my anxiety_ stopped the shaking_ and greatly reduced muscle pain.

It has given me the least side effects of all meds I've tried; Welbutrin_ Lexapro_ Celexa_ and Zoloft. This was the first Christmas is many years that I welcomed. I have pleanty of energy_ creativity_ I can laugh_ I can cry. I take 60 mg_ and it's a comfortable amount.

I used to take Lexapro (10mg)_ and I grew an tolerance to it. So my doctor switched me to Cymbalta (30mg) with an order to continue to take the Celexa for a week then start taking the 60mg capsules of Cymbalta. After only three days of taking the drug_ my mood instantly improved. It's worth the side effects_ but I don't feel anxious or depressed as often.

It was wonderful with my worst pain and depression.  But I was still having issues with so tired and falling asleep even driving.  I hated the zombie feeling it gave me.  I wouldn't even cry hardly at all with the saddest situations.  I was taking it along with other meds: flexeril at night for sleep_ tramadol for a kick in the mornings and for pain_ lyrica for fibro and nerve pain.  I'm trying to get off of all my medicines.

Yesterday_ Christmas day began with a crying episode that I could NOT shake for several hours that included hopelessness in a major way.  I was Determined NOT to remain depressed so I first tried 1/2mg ativan followed by an additional dose of 60 mg of cymbalta.  Gradually over 3 hrs the heavy dark shroud of miserable depression began to fall away.  It has been over 24 hrs. NO DEPRESSION.  This was my miracle on Christmas day.   Uncertain about night and day sweats as that has been around for a decade due to menopause and a total hysterectomy.  I sleep at night_ no nightmares and my dreams are _ REALLY VIVID as I am a VISUAL ARTIST.  I do wake up refreshed.  A few times I have experienced theo peripheral shadows_ 1 second_ then gone but I now realize what they are and they no longer scare the hell out of me.  I will accept the annoying side affects if cymbalta continues to keep the grim reaper_ depression and anxiety_ OUT of lifejourney.  I look forward to each step where scientists take one further towards a better life for those who suffer.  Hopefully this forum of exchange will be a step forward in reaching the cure all miracle drug.  In the mean time take advantage of the progress that have been made.

I had a terrible time with it- morose_ deep depression_ etc. I started Cymbalta 15 days ago and have noticied an increase in energy_ better sleep at night_ and so far minimal help with my fibrolyalgia. I am only on 30mg at bedtime and would like to increase eventually because I have noticied a slight increase in my mood_ energy level_ and sleep. No terrible side effects so far.

Both my depression and anxiety have abated significantly_ though there is some of both left (plus the tiredness_ which I suspect could be depression-related).  I'm already at 120mg and would like to go even higher.  My sexual performance has improved greatly_ as has my concentration and even driving skills!

I have never in my life had such a hard time getting motivated (even with anxiety and depression). I am constantly forgetting words and always feel like I'm in a fog. I barely remember the last 3.5 months. I would sit down to study for class and forget what I just read.

I also found that it was difficult to urinate completely and when I tried to force a greater flow_ it would not increase.  My level of agression had greatly increased and I was very intolerant of minor irritations_ with explosive outbursts.,"I decided to stop the medication to make sure that my prostate wasn't in trouble and to make things better for those that were living with me_ and the week of withdrawl was horrible.

Loss of focus and attention (got into 2 small accidents after 35 years with clean driving record); lose stuff like keys_ pens and stuff_ loss of memory_ ideas and words; Loss of sex drive (no desire for it anymore).  Most of the loss is quite mild but does cause a concern - I don't and to be on ths forever - HOWEVER..... on the positive side_ I sleep well don't cry at the drop of a hat_ I can work full time again and my relationships are back on track again.  Cymbalta and 3 month rest have helped me greatly.,I've just dropped to 30mg per day - I can say I am feeling a lot better since being on Cymbalta - I'm not anxious and I'm able to put things behind me that would really set me off before.

989, 4, Maintenance for depression,I tolerate Cymbalta really well.  It works for anxiety much better than the SSRI's like Prozac_ Paxil_ and Zoloft.  And I don't know what everyone is talking about_ 30 days worth of the 60 milligrams is only $120_ so Cymbalta is not that expensive without insurance.  I guess I also get some mild sexual side effects_ but not bad....the molecule that Cymbalta is based on is closely related to the molecule that Prozac is based on_ and I tolerate Prozac very well so that explains why I do so well with Cymbalta.,This drug has an action like Effexor but with a much more calming_ soothing affect.  The only thing that you have to watch is the short half-life which means that if you miss just one dose you will experience withdrawal symptoms like dizziness_ nausea_ and electric-shock sensations.  But don't let these horror stories scare you...this drug is known for working quickly among the antidepressants and for working when many other medicines have failed.  Cymbalta has really improved the quality of my sleep and the quality of my life_ actually.  I'm a high-anxiety kind of person by nature and this drug has really allowed me to relax and enjoy my life a lot more.  Definately give this drug a try_ especially if you have depression with anxiety and the SSRI's like Prozac_ Paxil_ and Zoloft don't really adequately treat all of your symptoms.,M,27,2  months,12/3/2009Email,Cymbalta

I wanted to see if changing to cymbalta helped my memory. Cymbalta is great for the depression and I felt less medicated than when I took Paxil and had a little more libido_ but the memory loss problem continued and the prementioned side effects now make it necessary to try something else.

I does control my fibromyalgia. I am supposed to be at 120 mgs_ 60 twice a day. I am currently on 90 due to my insurance having limits on how many pills they will allow. 90 doesn't work as well but it's better than 60. I've tried Effexor but it affected my sleep.

It also seems to give me energy as it keeps my seasonal depression at bay.

I am now trying to wean off this medication due to weight gain and cost. Started at 30 mg. then went to 60 mg. My doc wanted me to go to 90_ but I did not want to. The doc also told me that this med was less likely to cause weight gain compared to other anti-anxiety meds - not true for me. Plus I have some muscle pain and she thought it would help that_ which it did not. Trying to wean off is aweful! I ran out and had to go a day without it and had the worst day ever - brain zaps_ dizziness and uneasiness. That was when I decided to ask about weaning off. My new doc has prescribed Prozac and wants me to try to wean off Cymbalta in about a week. I have been down to 30 mg. for about 2 weeks. I am going to take it slow weaning off especially after reading so many comments about side effects of weaning. I think it helps to add 20 mg of Prozac to the 30 mg Cymbalta while weaning. I hope this works for me and hope Prozac works without weight gain.,F,49,8  months,11/27/2009,Cymbalta
997, 3, Anxiety/Depression,Brain Zaps. Dizziness. Loss of sexual desire. Inability to orgasm. Loss of Concentration.,I started taking and immediately started suffering brain zaps. If I missed a day_ the brain zaps were almost debilitating. After about 3 months_ I was no longer interested in having sex with my wife. When I did_ i was unable to achieve orgasm. I experienced loss of concentration when speaking_ had to search hard for the necessary words. I was taking 90 mg daily and decided to wean off the drug. It took 3 months of consistently lower doses to get off. The brain zaps were severe and the mood swings were almost unbearable during the weaning period. I suffered frquent crying spells and greater depression than when I started taking the drug. I experienced severe feelings of hoplessness and occasional thoughts of suicide. These symptoms went away as the drug left my system. I still have occasional brain zaps 3 months after being off the drug but it is much better.,M,42,1  years,11/26/2009Email,Cymbalta

I do feel flat (as people stated) but to me this is an improvement over mania and being all over the place. I am peeing all the time and am very very thirsty. I have also aquired a taste for alcohol which I find very odd - I am not much of a drinker anymore and it is like I am developing a problem to the point people have noticed.,Even though I am exhausted_ I am sleeping so much better -I fall asleep much easier and I don't wake in the middle of the night anymore. I lost five pounds the first month_ which is great. I have had a increase in sex drive and my migraines have gone from 3 a week to once a month. Being flat allows me to better interact in public without the anxiety but I am still depressed while alone. I am one week into the 60's.,F,37,2  months,11/25/2009Email,Cymbalta

1000, 1, Depression/Anxiety,When I first started taking cymbalta I would wake up drenched at night from sweating.  I felt like I was in a fog the whole time I was on this medicine.  I was at 60mg and then dropped to 30mg for 2 weeks then stopped taking it.  The withdrawl from cymbalta only took about a week for the dizziness to stop.  I am still having brain zaps here and there_ and my anxiety has returned. I would rather live like this though than be in a fog.  It has only been two weeks since I stopped taking the med.,If you do not feel like this drug is working_ or any other AD please tell your Dr.  I was on this drug a little over a year and in that time I continued to get worse contemplating suicide more than once. I had taken other AD's prior to taking cymbalta_ but never experience the awful thoughts and feelings like I did with cymbalta.  I now know why there is a black box warning on these meds.  Cymbalta changed my whole thought process_ I felt like I was in some sort of hell and couldn't escape.  Now that I am no longer on this med. it is like day and night_ I finally feel good again.,F,38,13  months,11/23/2009Email,Cymbalta

I continued however because I realize that people are less likely to leave positive feedback in any situation. So_ I'm here to say that if you've just started stick with it...my worst side effects only lasted a day. And already I feel better_ have more energy and in general feel like a wait has been lifted off my shoulders. I know from experience that you must try several different meds before you find the one that works for you_ so if Cymbalta's not working for you talk to your doctor right away and try something new. Thankfully_ after several different types and combinations of meds I have finally found something that works for me.,F,28,3  days,11/22/2009Email,Cymbalta

He said his nurse is going through the same symptoms I am going through and sent her in to talk with me. She had a full hysterectomy just like me and swears cymbalta works for her. Anyone with some advise??? Oh by the way...I have no depression or any other pain problems.,F,47,1  days,10/14/2009Email,Cymbalta

1050, 5, depression anxiety_and possible FM,I felt a little nausea the first day.  I have a hot flash type of feeling the first few hours after taking it.  I sweat a little more and my sex drive has decreased somewhat.,I feel amazing on cymbalta!!!  I could tell a difference the first day.  By the second week when I went to the 60 mg I felt like a different person.  I have fewer panic attacks. I don't get mad as easily as I did at my kids.  I actually get up and do house work after dinner instead of lay on the couch.  My 8 hour work day goes by so much better.  I highly recomment it to anyone.  My side effects are/were so mild if you are depressed this drug is worth trying.  Of course I haven't had to try to get off of it yet.  That might be a different story!,F,31,1  months,10/12/2009,Cymbalta
1051, 5, Depression / Fibro Pain,The first few days were hard- nausea_ horrible headaches_ insomnia_ i just felt 'ill'. Was gonna stop taking it but decided to give it a week.Inability to climax.,My fibro was getting so painful_ but cymbalta stopped it in its tracks-i would not have belived a non opoid could be so good. Im not in that bleak depressive place either_ im 'ok'. Still get the odd headache and need a bit extra sleep. In 2 mths ive lost 17lbs_ the only 'problem' is the orgasm thing_ but ill accept the trade off. Would be very happy to lose the other 15 lbs meds have put on me with this med!,F,39,2  months,10/11/2009Email,Cymbalta
1052, 3, anxiety_ mild depression,vivid nightmares_ insomnia_  very low sex drive_ delayed orgasm,I started taking Cymbalta because I had adverse reactions to Wellbutrin. I feel like my eratic emotions are more in check but I am concerned about my low sex drive and nightmares. I had night terrors on Wellbutrin too which is one reason I made the switch to Cymbalta.

1054, 1, depression/anxiety,med helped for a while_ but I gained about 30lbs in the midsection.  I was always thin and fit before. was taking it for multiple failed fertility treatment's and devastating experience with failed IVF.,became pregnant surprisingly (by natural means). my md stopped the 60mg cymbalta cold turkey and switched me to lexapro.  I had to be hospitalized within a day for severe vomiting_ & electrolyte imbalances. I felt terribly anxious and had heart palpitations I didn't understand.  I had waited 7 years for a baby.  At 12 1/2 weeks pregnant....after all that suffering_ the baby died.  DO Not stop this medication cold turkey.  They make a 20mg capsule.  then you can open it and remove some beads.  my life will never be the same again.,F,38,2  days,10/9/2009,Cymbalta
1055, 5, anxiety_ mild depression,I did experience some night sweats while on the medication.  I did not experience a loss of sexual drive and did not lose/gain weight.  Took 20 mg a day.,Cymbalta completely changed my life.  I am 25 years old and have suffered from anxiety and depressive episodes since 16.  After much consultation with my doctor_ we decided that cymbalta would be the best choice.  I still get mildly sad sometimes or nervous but only for short periods and I am usually able to just stop thinking negative (which I could never do before).  I have  been happier in the past 2 years than I can ever remember.  I even stopped taking it for 4 months and was not a terrible experience.  I did not quit instantaneously and went for about 2 months taking less and less each week.  I don't think the medicine numbs your feelings and taking a relatively small dose may really help someone experiencing multiple side effects. I have taken 20 mg. a day the entire time.,M,25,2  years,10/7/2009,Cymbalta

Initially nearly bit my tongue off during my sleep on several occasions.,"It's dangerous stuff. You can't tell me otherwise. I took myself off after my doctor brushed off my rremarks regarding side effects I was experiencing. I never asked for this stuff. She simply put me on it because she notice that ""fibromyalgia"" was noted on my chart some years prior to seeing her. This drug robbed me of quality life for nearly two years. The leg pain was both muscle and ligament related. At times I would nearly fall down when my muscles would give out unexpectedly. At other times one leg would become rigid and I was unable to straighten it out. At times I could not turn over in bed. Eventually my entire spine became sore and stiff and I had to sleep on ice packs. My doctor blamed this on arthritis. I took myself off the drug and found a new doctor.

Easy to shrug off anything important.  Pain in my legs came back a year ago worse than ever.,I ran out of pills on Tuesday. The mail order pharmacy was too slow to get the order out. Today's Friday. Started getting a headache Wednesday_ didn't think anything of it. My ears started ringing loudly yesterday and today it hurts to look at the computer screen. Funny thing is when I got out of bed this morning the first thing I noticed was that the pain in the bottoms of my feet was gone. Funny reading about the brain zaps. I wouldn't have known to describe them that way. It's like a rush of blood being sprayed towards my ears from the inside. Colors are more vivid. More detail.

My work involves traveling with others and could not uninate for two days. Developed urinary track infection. DRUG SHOULD BE OUTLAWED. I tried to continue taking after one month of Dr samples. Guess what _Blue Cross denied prescription and had to quit cold turkey. Depression continued to worsen and am lucky to be here today. Stay away from this drug. A patent drug being pushed to Drs by phamacuticals regardless of the results. I will be suprised if you see this drug around in five years.

The decreased libido is a major problem because I truly love my husband of 14 years_ but I have a VERY difficult time being interested on an intimate level. I also cannot deal with the sweating.

I would say my depression is better_ but I am just not very nice right now.  As of today my dr. told me not to take it for about 4-5 days and then let him know how I feel.

I am supposed to go to 60mg in two days but after reading the reports of the great difficulty in getting off Cymbalta - I am going to stop taking it before it gets even worse.,F,62,5  days,8/28/2009Email,Cymbalta
1092, 3, Depression_ Anger_ SAD,I did not experience side effects_ other than maybe a lower libido. Until.....weaning!,I have never been on any medication that is worse to wean from than this one.  The buzzing in my head_ for about 6 months now.  I went to 4 doctors to find out why I was suddenly having buzzing (also called tinnitus) but no one could come up with any reasons.  Finally a psychiatrist resident told me that it was a result of weaning off some anti-depressants.  OMG_ I am so glad to know that I will not have this horrible constant buzzing for ever.  I also experienced an elevated liver function_ again my doctor did not know why_ but I have since read it is due to long term Cymbalta_ in fact that is one of the reasons I eventually stopped taking it.  Actually_ I have been on it for 4 years and I am still trying to wean off_ it's been 6 months_ slowly tapering.  I am dizzy_ very depressed and at time agitated and mean.,F,50,4  years,8/26/2009,Cymbalta

The first 4 weeks I felt great. Sadly February the side effects were beginning to take hold. By May 7th they were at their worst. May 8th I saw my doctor who took me off Cymbalta that day and was placed back on Celexa which is helping just fine now. I feel no depression.,,,4  months,8/24/2009,Cymbalta

Getting off it alone has been hellish not to mention being on it for 6 months. The longer I was on it the worse I got. On many occasions I thought I was losing my mind_ and have been unable to function. Ive missed months of work this year because of it. Im lucky I own my own business with my parents and was able to still get paid. I feel sorry for those who aren't so lucky_ as I would be without a job and friends thanks to this. THIS DRUG CAN SERIOUSLY RUIN YOUR LIFE! What really gets me is that I was taking it for general depression and anxiety_ not the end of the world stuff_ I could function fine. It completely turned my life on end and nearly sunk me!I am considering contacting an attorney to see if there are any lawsuits going on this. If not I may start my own.

Fatigue worse than before going on it.,While it has helped somewhat with my depression_ I am starting to doubt that I will be able to continue on the medication.  It has worked better for me than Zoloft did_ but I feel so ill most of the time that my quality of life has gone down_ though my depression has leveled out.  My doc added Wellbutrin_ 300 mg to see if that would help more.  I do feel that my mood swings have also leveled out_ but I just dont know that I can handle much more of the Cymbalta side effects.  Started out on 30 mg_ am now on 60 and doc wants to up it to 90.  Dont think I will do that.,F,38,6  months,8/13/2009Email,Cymbalta

I have never felt so sick_ with the exception of the worst flu I'd ever had.  Then 2 weeks_ I felt much better and then BAM_ right back to those HORRIFIC side effects.  This time_ a specialist switched me to Cymbalta_ and I really don't think I feel anything.  Just... normal.  That's what I'm supposed to feel_ right?  Not necessarily euphoric_ but NORMAL.

1106, 4, anxiety/severe depression,vertigo_ sweating_ vivid dreams(though at times quite entertaining),I wanted to add some comments that I forgot.....My weight has been the same during the entire time I have been on Cymbalta.  I have had no sexual side effects.  I feel that it IS still working for the joint pain and somewhat for the depression_ however_ not as well as it was and I'd rather not increase the dosage.  Instead my doctor has added Prozac_ 10mg.  I can't offer any feedback on that yet_ because today is the first day I have taken it.  I have been on Prozac in the past_ Lexapro---which worked great for a year then nothing_ and coming off of it was horrible.  I choose to stay on Cymbalta because of it's wonderful help with my joint pain.  I honestly could not function as I do without it.  I had no idea that it was used for fibromyalgia patients and the lack of pain was noticed before the help with the depression.  I wish it didn't make me sweat more but it's a side effect I'll live with.  To anyone that is trying it and experiencing some of the dizziness and nausea_ I encourage you to stick it out...It DOES get better!,F,44,1  years,8/9/2009Email,Cymbalta
1107, 4, depression,insomnia_ dry mouth_ teeth clenching/jaw ache,Have been on cymbalta for about three weeks now and am lucky to have not had some of the more severe side effects others have experienced.  The worst thing for me is the insomnia. I have no trouble falling asleep initially at night_ but I wake up at 2 or 3 in the morning and CANNOT fall back asleep. Hoping this goes away. Also experiencing an ache in the left side of my jaw_ and realized I've been clenching my teeth a lot_ which I noticed a few other people have experienced as well. Not unbearable_ more annoying than anything_ but I'm not sure how to stop myself from clenching when I don't even realize I'm doing it. As far as the depression goes_ it's definitely helped.

The first 2 weeks were ok_ I was on 30mg_ with only minor sleep pattern changes which I expected.  When I was upped to 60 mg_ everything started.  I began having really vivid dreams_ not scary_ just odd.  I began to have diarrhea one day and constipation the next.  I am normally a sweaty person_ but I rarely sweat at all_ but when I do_ it is profuse.  I have gained 10 pounds_ which I can deal with_ but it isn't good for my wallet by having to buy new clothes.  I now cannot sleep_ either from the dreams or just not feeling tired_ but may fall asleep during the day.  The worst thing is the electric shocks going from my head through my neck and the lack of libido.,M,24,2  months,7/27/2009,Cymbalta
1115, 1, Mild Anxiety,Extreme sweating & insomnia_ suicidal thoughts_ racing heartbeat_ panic attacks_ aggressiveness.,I went to my doctor several months ago in search of something to calm me down after my life sort of exploded with all sorts of issues at once- cut in pay (economic downturn with company)_ barely affording massive mortgage_ family member sent to prison for her drug addition/possession_ and now dealing with lawyers and massive bills in addition to everything else. I first started out on Paxil_ which ended horrifically. I became incredibly numb to emotion all the time coupled with extreme nausea and lost interest in just about everything and became depressed even though I wasn't depressed in the first place. After 2 months_ I couldn't take it anymore and went back to the doc hoping for something else. He then switched me to prozac. This is when sweating really started happening: Non-stop_ day and night_ regardless of my movement I sweated profusely. I had to stand in front of a fan in the morning with every window open in the house while getting ready for work after my shower_ even though it was 50 degrees outside in San Francisco fog. Two months after prozac_ I felt significantly more anxious_ more aggressive_ started fights with co-workers over nothing_ barely slept... basically way worse then before I took any damn pills in the first place. Finally_ I went back to the doc again and he switched me to cymbalta. Having been on this for a few weeks I am now convinced there is not a single anti-depressant my body can handle.

Better mood in general_ like a mild cocaine buzz_ but no euphoria - just good mood and awake.  Not helping with anxiety yet.,Really hard for me to sleep.  Conscience about my body odor now.  Waiting for the anit-anxiety effect to kick in.  Appetite decreased.  I read lots of reviews mentioning hair loss.  the second I see any hairloss_ I'm OFF Cymbalta and on to next antidepressant.

1117, 3, Fibromyalgia,Numbness in the head_ like brain was in a vise grip (30 mg)_ numbness in face and traveling numbness through the body (20mg),I was really bummed because the cymbalta acutally helped my fibromyalgia pain from day 1.  And unlike other people_ it cut my appetite_ which was a blessing because of weight gain from taking meds for pain.  But I oould not put up with the numbness in my head.  At the lower dosage and the numbness in the head was lessened but then I developed numbness in the face and then it started traveling throughout the body like the fibromyalgia pain did.  If it weren't for the numbness_ cymbalta would have been an answer to my fibromyalgia pain. :(,F,48,2  weeks,7/24/2009,Cymbalta

I didnt think I would ever be normal again_ but after about a month it finally let up and I started to feel normal again (depressed still but at least no brain freezes) i am not on wellbutrin and tolerate that just fine_ cymbalta to me is junk,F,34,4  months,7/23/2009,Cymbalta

1123, 5, depression/chronic pain (lupus),started on 30mg X 1 week_ and took first dose before bed_ and i felt a little bit buzzed and kinda nauseated. The next day had really no side effects except feeling a bit sweaty at night and not sleeping as well_which only lasted for about 2-3 weeks. I decided to switch the medication to the daytime and then i had no more sweating and no more sleeping difficulties. I can honestly say that i really didnt haven any major side effects with this medications_ not even the fatigue you can experience when you start the other types of antidressants/SSRI's. I do however feel a bit more figidity_ but not really bothersome and is getting less as teh weeks go by,"By week 2 on 60mg my pain has ""dramatically"" reduced.  I am a nurse and seen it work on another patient were we had tried everything for pain control with no success but this worked for her_ so i  decided to give it a try and i cant believe it. It has also helped with the depression but has not fully resolved it.

BUCK-UP and give it a real try or live with your problems. I do understand it does not work for everyone and effects everyone differently. OK_ so_ as for me it is not a magic bullet but has improved my life. Coping with work and stress has surely  improved. I do recommend trying everything else first then when you need give it a whirl be prepared to stick it out for the chance at the full benefit . It just maybe worth it.

1127, 5, Depression and anxiety,Loss of libido for first few months; excessive sweating,Started with 60mg/day_ major loss of libido.  Tried reducing to 30mg/day_ depression returned.  Combined with Wellbutrin (buproprion) 300mg/day_ slight improvement in libido.  Dropped Cymbalta back to 30mg/day + Wellbutrin 300mg/day; depression returned.  Back to Cymbalta 60mg/day and Wellbutril 300mg/day.  Libido has improved over time (maybe 9 months from starting Cymbalta to nearly-full return).  Sweating is a problem_ but I have always sweated excessively_ the Cymbalta has just increased it.  About once/month I have to sleep on a couple of towels_ otherwise I just sweat if I walk to work.  This is a *very* small price to pay for having my life back_ the joy I get from my family_ and reduced stress in my wife and kids.  With all these drugs_ YMMV.  I am happy enough with Cymbalta that I will not try switching -- I know from trying various reductions that I will get depressed and suicidal if I come off for more than a day or two.  Cymbalta has saved my life_ the side-effects are a small price to pay.  Maybe something else would have done a better job with fewer side-effects_ but I doubt it.  And I am not going to take the risk of trying to find out.,M,51,11  months,7/19/2009Email,Cymbalta

Sinking back into depression upped dose to 60_ sweat more_ body odor changed_ sank again_ upped dose to 90 mg.  Seems to be okay.  Lost 6 pounds (Yeah!)  Using mouth guard at night_ clenching jaw.,I like Cymbalta_ I have emotions again_ which I didn't have with prozac.  Also tried Lexapro for a while_ gave me horrifying nightmares.  I have better impulse control with Cymbalta_ which may be why I lost some weight.  The most startling side effect was the change in body odor.  I have a very sensitive nose_ was never able to use perfumes - I noticed soon after beginning the 60 mg regimen that my sweat smelled different_ I noticed sweat stains on my clothing that didn't wash out.  Also_ I am now able to tolerate perfumes (certain ones) without headache or sneezing.  Sense of smell is not as sensitive as it was before 60 mg.  Seems odd to me_ but that's the only change that has occurred_ so I think it must be the drug.,F,57,5  months,7/19/2009,Cymbalta

1132, 2, depression; post-traumatic stress,GOIN ON:  Insomnia_ nausea_ dizzinessSTAYING ON:  Bladder pain_ increased hunger_ sugar cravings  GOING OFF:  Mood swings_ flulike symptoms--nausea_ vomiting_ fever_ chills,I first thought this drug was a Godsend despite severe insomnia which lasted the first 3 months (I had never suffered from it before and then I was waking up around 3 AM every night). I had increased energy and a noticably more positive attitude. I even started to lose weight as the increased energy helped me to exercise more. However_ as the insomnia decreased unfortunately so did the positive changes that had initially come with taking Cymbalta. My energy started to plummet back to my previous low levels. I was getting tired_ moody_ anxious--all signs of my depression returning even though I was taking the 60 mg a day without fail (upon waking each morning). Two physical side effects worsened over time--pain in my bladder that was horrible (I thought I had a bladder infection but I didn't) and increased hunger. With the hunger came INTENSE sugar cravings.  I mean INSANE.  The candy at the checkout stand never tempted me before_ and now I was loading up on KitKat and the like.  I HAD to have a milkshake everyday or something from Dairy Queen made with chocolate and drenched with extra chocolate (the people working there thought I was nutty for all the extra fudge I requested). Not surprisingly_ I started to pack on weight from the sugary stuff and not having any energy to work out anymore. So I choose to discontinue the Cymbalta_ decreasing the amount over a period of 3 weeks.

Like many others before me have stated_ I have tried many anti-depressants over the years.  Cymbalta is the first one to TRULY change my life.  I was very irritable_ couldn't concentrate_ was always overwhelmed by work and stressed out at home.  I felt I could never find any peace.  I started out on 30mg for 30 days and then increased dosage to 60mg which I am still taking.  I noticed an IMMEDIATE improvement within the first couple of days.  I was happier_ my moods were more stable_ I could concentrate better than I had been able to in years. I am SO grateful for this medication and pray that it continues to work as well as it has for me so far.,F,43,4  months,7/16/2009,Cymbalta

My sleeping is fractured. Hard to fall and stay asleep. When I do sleep_ I'm plagued with dark_ disjointed_ ADD-like dreams that constantly change as though I were channel surfing with a remote control on some demonic TV.Oh_ and dry mouth (which seems trivial at this point).",I'm an R.N._ and as such I know that the initial period on any medication can carry significant side effects while your body is adjusting to it.

Hated this medication- I felt completely dissociated fron the world (like I was watching myself on TV)_ unable to feel any emotion whatsoever. The constipation got to me the most- I was passing only small amounts of hard stool and these meds seemed to really slow down transit time. I was always bloated_ probably due to all the poop refusing to come out in a timely fashion! Night sweats worse than with Prozac- I would wake up to find the sheets drenched with sweat. Dreams very vivid and sleep unrefreshing as a result.I withdrew this drug on my own and stupidly went cold turkey.

I should be in the ER now because the heavy sweating and all of the other symptoms.,I would not wish this drug on my worst enemy! I cannot take serotonin drugs_ so what does my doctor do_ put me on Cymbalta. After the first dose that caused me to sleep for over 18 hours_ I did feel some better. The next day I took my second dose and slept another 18 to 20 hours_ I was in such a deep sleep that my daughter banged on my house for two hours before she called the police to break in. After that fiasco_ I noticed that I was feeling dizzy and my feet began sweating_ my feet have never sweat before_ but I took another dose and and I have been completely out of it for two days. I am hot and cold_ extremely dizzy_ feverish with cold shakes to being so hot that I think I am going to burst into flames. I am most likely dieing as I write this because I am to stubborn to go to the ER and my doctor is closed now. It is a Friday evening and I am trying to wait until Monday to see my doctor. No one should take this drug_ I don't care how depressed you are_ at least you are alive! I know some people do well_ but I have seen serotonin drugs prescribed for so many things and every single person I know that has taken them have had really bad experiences.

I started taking it again and the pain ended but the diareha was back the following day.  My pain started due to disk in my neck_ I had an anterial fusion on three disc in my neck and the pain was better but then it came back at a lesser degree but still had the pain and numbness.

I was ""out of it_"" extremely sleepy_ took accidental naps during the day_ experienced horrible diarrhea_ embarrassing stomach gurgling and flatulence_ moderate nausea_ loss of appetite_ slight loss of coordination_ occasional blurred vision_ and generally felt numb both in body and in spirit.  My pain is terrible and Cymbalta dulled it significantly_ but it's side effects are not worth it.","There is no way I could live a functional life on this drug. I'm a 30 year old graduate student who was prescribed this medication for serious pain combined with a little anxiety about my situation: I dislocated my lower back and hip in a sports accident and had multiple surgeries for my injury over a year ago_ but I'm still in terrible pain and have trouble sitting for long periods of time.  As a result_ I'm extremely worried about finishing my PhD program with these limitations.  I was hoping that Cymbalta would help.  No way.  This stuff reduced my pain from an objective standpoint_ but the whole reason I want so desperately to get rid of my pain is to be a functional human being.  Cymbalta made me feel like a numbed up zombie_ in addition to making me extremely sick.  I know they tell you to stick with the medication because it doesn't work for at least a week_ but why on earth would I want to force my body to get habituated to something that effects me like poison?  It's not worth it.   Rather than targeting my pain alone_ it was like trying to kill a flea with a jackhammer.  If it works for you that's great (obviously stick with it)_ but after my experience I would caution others who are prescribed this drug for pain.

Periods of depression probably due to the tiredness.  Loss of appetite. Mild Weight Loss.  Dry Mouth.  Feeling Hot.  Sweating.,"My psych nurse switched me to Cymbalta from Lexapro about a month ago because I was a little tired on the Lexapro.  The Cymbalta was horrible for me.  The first side effects noticed were mild dizziness upon standing - the kind you get if you have low blood pressure and get up too quickly from a seated or lying down position.  I thought I could stick it out because many times the side effects will disappear as your body adjusts to the new medication.  That didn't happen.  After about two and a half weeks on Cymbalta_ the side effects began getting worse.  The extreme ""crashing"" fatigue was awful. Then the spinning type of dizziness began.  And when I began feeling depressed and hopeless_ I said that's it.  But_ of course that was on a Saturday and I had to wait until Monday to get ahold of my nurse practitioner.  Well_ I was very close to going to the ER on Saturday night because of the depressed mood.  Fortunately_ I was able to ""stick it out"" until Monday when my psych. nurse practitioner took me off of it completely and switched me back to Lexapro.  That was four days ago and I still feel horrid.  The dizziness is bad - withdrawal? - worse than before and now I feel anxious and jittery.  Ugh.  Tomorrow I am going to pick up a prescription for a medication to help with the dizziness.  Hopefully it will help.

For those not in the know this is when you stop breathing at night.  You never get into a deep REM sleep.  You brain is starved of oxygen_ you get no rest_ and you go through life exhausted.  This is a new problem for me and I suspect the cymbalta.  I have never snored in my life and my wife of 13 years now is constantly awakened by me.  After being hooked up to sensors I found out that I stop breathing up to 51 times per hour.  I cannot make it through the day without napping... which does not go over well at work.I am trying to get off cymbalta now.

Cymbalta_ I had so few side effects they're not even worth mentioning.,"My dose of Cymbalta grew to 120 mg_ stepped back to 30 mg. I HAD been on Effexor for 5 years_ very successfully_ but my dosage was already at 450 mg and I began reading about the withdrawl side effects of Effexor. I REQUESTED a medication change_ so we ramped down slowly on the Effexor and afterwards_ slowly up on the Cymbalta. It was a seamless transition. So WHY am I getting OFF Cymbalta? At 120 mg._ I don't want to keep going up_ up_ up (due to my weight of only 123 pounds). After two years_ I feel it simply has reached its peak of effectivness. I'm not getting the same ""feel good"" as I once did. I'm sleeping all the time again_ I'm nasty to everyone_ I don't want to go out of the house... the same things all over again. And it's funny_ because it happened suddenly - almost like someone threw a switch or something! So_ we're ramping down verrrry slowly on the Cymbalta_ and so far the only thing I've experienced is a couple nights of ""night sweats"" and a few ""brain flashes"" (but they weren't HORRIBLE as some people say.) The key is to step down REALLY slow. It has taken TWO AND A HALF MONTHS to ramp down_ and you DON'T start another medication while you're doing it. SLOOOOOWWWWLLLLLYYYYY.

In hindsight I now realize that I was nearing the height of menopause and was hormonally imbalanced_ not depressed. All of the side effects I have described have persisted and worsened over time.  In the last three years I have had two major surgeries and a great deal of stress.  Recently I decided to try to get off this stuff as my life has lost so much of its vitality on this drug.  All I want to do is sleep and I never feel rested.  I recently had my hormone levels tested_ and surprisingly_ my testosterone level is very high for a woman_ yet I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in sex.   Before cymbalta I was a bodybuilder and personal trainer for 20 years and always strong_ sexually functional_ and healthy.  I never used any drugs at all other than ""the pill"" in my youth.  I have been on 60 mg 2x per day of cymbalta and 2 mg per day of clonazepam for the past three years.

Still no significant change in my depression or suicidal ideation. My doctor increased me to 120mg even though there's no evidence to indicate this dosage works.

Unfortunately the side effects were so bad after 6 weeks that I had to stop using it.  What good is the relief of the neurological pain if your head is stuck over the toilet most of the day because of the nausea?  For the last week I took Cymbalta_ I had chronic diarrhea.  The other major size effect was the dizziness.  The last day I took it my world was literally spinning around me.  I was laying down trying to watch TV and it was like chasing the TV all over the wall to try and see the image.  When I first took the med I had an episode where I was crashing into the walls trying to make it to my bedroom because of how dizzy the Cymbalta made me.  It worked wonders for the pain though_ and I really feel bad that I cannot continue on it because of the side effects I experienced.

This morning the fatigue and dizziness are gone. I never felt the need to post any comments about medications before_ but this medication is absolutely BRUTAl on the mind and body. I would  prefer the weight gain of lyrica. In the past I took zoloft without any problems_ so I was hoping for pain relief and improve mental attitude.

Super increased energy_ more positive thoughts_ sleep better and able to deal with and think a lot better like I could before taking this nasty medicine. I wasn't taking this as an anti[-depressant but a pain management aid. God help anyone that takes this medication for depression. You'll probably want to go out and kill yourself afterwards and put yourself out of your misery. I had many thoughts of suicide and helplessness and being overwhelmed on this durg and thoughts I never had before taking it. I stopped exercising and socializing and became a hermit as I felt more and more paranoid. Again things I never had previously. Best advice - Don't read all this garbage about the terrible side effects of withdraw from stopping Cymbalta. Just do it and get off the stuff and see if your side effects match those of others after you have the meds out of your body for at least a week.

1215, 4, Anxiety,Slight constipation & lack of sex drive at first_ but it went away after 2-3 weeks.,So far it seems to be helping. I had a few side effects at first_ but they went away after the first couple weeks. Now I really don't have any side effects_ unless I forget to take the medicine_ otherwise I get strange brain zaps. The past couple days I have noticed a rash on my torso_ I do not know if this is from the medicine_ although I have been on the medicine almost a year now.,M,24,11  months,5/7/2009,Cymbalta
1216, 1, Depression,Night sweats_ headaches.,I never felt like this medication helped my symptoms_ but I never took anything I thougth helped. Now I question the diagnosis in the first place_ because I've been antidepressant-free for a year and a half and feel great. So I can't really testify to effectiveness. Withdrawal symptoms are horrible: migraine-type headaches_ sweats_ tremor_ nausea_ dizziness_ and a feeling of electrical shocks from my brain. I had trouble doing simple things like counting change_ and I was terrified that wouldn't change_ but my brain did heal itself! I got off Cymbalta with the assistance of my great doctor. It took me a good 4 months before I was back to normal_ working normally. I had to take narcotic pain medications to get rid of the headaches so that I was able to sleep -- not something I wanted to do_ but it was better than getting back on the Cymbalta. Feel free to contact me for moral support if you're suffering from withdrawal symptoms due to Cymbalta -- but make sure your doctor is aware of them also!,F,27,6  months,5/7/2009Email,Cymbalta

I know its too soon_ but I do not have any side effects_ I feel more alert_ focused and worry-free. I usually have very vivid dreams but I have slept well and have had calm dreams the last few nights. I do not feel ""zombie-like"" or tired_ in fact I feel like I have more  clarity and energy. I am on the low dose_ 30mg daily. I don't see any correlation to this med and diarrea and I am not worried about the effects of ""going off it"" as I plan to ""stay on it"" as long as I feel this good.  I have advice for those who still suffer:  Get some sunshine on your face_ just a few minutes will make you feel great.  Get an old dog_ not a puppy_ an old dog that Needs you_ that you can care for and that will love you back. If you can't handle a dog get a fish.  Smile at a baby! They usually smile back at you :)  Think of positive thoughts even if you have to make them up. I dare you! Buy something new even if its just a pair of underwear.  Women know this really does work wonders. Give it a fair chance_ good luck. Aloha~",F,52,5  days,5/1/2009,Cymbalta

However_ I have been on this medicine the longest and am most satisfied with the results.  I'm a very happy_ easy going person now_ whether that's from cymbalta or years of therapy.  I don't really notice the medicine unless I forget to take it_ at which point I start to feel incredibly ill.  This makes me not want to get off it so I keep putting it off.  Maybe there's a part of me that's afraid to see what I'm like without antidepressants too.  It's just been so long.,F,21,4  years,4/24/2009,Cymbalta

I weigh more than I did when I was pregnant.  Feel like I retain water.,This drug almost ruined my life.  Made me very emotional_ from a combination of exhaustion and whatever the drug was doing to my brain.  I would have outbursts some days and have terrible arguments with my boyfriend.  Other days I would be extremely quiet and just want to be alone.  I would purposely want to listen to depressing music or watch sad movies to add to my own misery.  I feel like I have been on a rollercoater.  I told my Dr. that I was feeling this way but was brushed off.  I decided today I was going to stop and deal with the withdrawl..

1223, 1, Pain,Sleepy_ shaking_ disoriented_ stupefaction,I have been on Wellbutrin for over 3 years. I started it for smoking cessation and it helped me go from nearly two packs a day to just a few a day. It also gave me energy and I had no side effects at all. No stupefaction effect that many get from drugs like Eleval and Pamlor (I took both to try to help with chronic pain  worthless. Now I wear a Fentanyl patch and the pain is well controlled and I have no side effects).I took one (1) 30mg pill and within two hours was asleep in my car because I got so tired and disoriented. I was at work at the time that I took it. Later that night_ I was still groggy and my body was shaking_ like I was having a low grade seizure or something. I slept on and off during the night_ but was unable to go to work the next day because of the shaking and feeling of being disoriented. Your experience my be different_ but if you are taking something that is working fine_ dont let a doctor recommend this. I wont take this drug again and I would seriously consider not taking it if you are about to. Try Wellbutrin if you havent tried it. ,M,47,1  days,4/23/2009,Cymbalta

My doctor finally decided to put me on cymbalta_ along with a mood stabilizer and an anitpsycotic for sleep. I can say nothing bad about the drug as long as it it TAKEN PROPERLY. The Drug worked perfect for me. The zombie like state at times and the fatigue were the only side effects i experienced. However if i missed a dose or two my world was turned up-side-down. i would go into manic episodes_ and become extremely irratic.

I started having thoughts of killing myself whenever I saw a knife or pair of sissors...then my friends and family brought to my attention that I was drinking alcohol non stop for over a month....priar to taking this medication I had never been a big drinker.

1235, 4, bipolar II - depression,Unfortunately I can't remember exactly what they were_ but I did have some. I guess they weren't too horrendous_ except it severely hinders weight loss_ so I finally decided I had to quit it. Worked very well for my depression; happy to report I had no complaints with that. You WILL need to discipline yourself and BE WISE with this med though: DONT skip any doses_ not even by an hour or so_ or you may begin to not feel very well physically. Just follow these simple rules and you should be just fine_ and in a pretty stable mood! If Im social drinking with friends_ which isnt very often - maybe once a month - I might not take the med exactly when Im supposed to_ but I stick with it daily_ and dont recall it making me feel odd_ mentally or physically as long as I'm consistent in taking it. HOWEVER_ getting off of Cymbalta altogether requires following a VERY STRICT PROTOCOL. If you dont follow it_ IT CAN GET UGLY. REAL UGLY. (Quick_ but necessary,MY GOD (I never use that phrase - I'm atheist!)_ DO NOT RISK_ UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE_ stopping this med cold turkey OR EVEN A BIT TOO QUICKLY or you may sorely regret it (no pun intended)! Husband calls it the 'heroin of antidepressants'. Make that mistake_ you'd better prepare for nausea_ dizziness_ increasingly crappy feeling overall_ & ultimately SEVERE BRAIN ZAPS. The ZAPPING is CRAZY depressing; I felt completely helpless_ always in bed_ didnt want to move so zaps wouldn't start!

I was having severe anxiety and a lot of sleepless nights. About 2months after taking it I started getting my life back together and getting some good sleep. I still feel really sick to my stomach though and thinking of coming off of it. I tried taking it @ night but it keeps me awake. My next step is to cut my dose from 60mg to 30 mg per day.

I would have rated it a '5'_ but exactly at the six weeks' mark...I started with severe diarrhea and it lasted until I finally quit taking Cymbalta a month later.  I've tried to gradually re-introduce the Cymbalta at a lower dose twice since then_ after 1 month rest for my 'gut'...but the diarrhea starts back immediately.  I would love to know if anyone else has had experience with this & if the diarrhea finally went away.

1238, 4, depression,night sweats_ dry mouth_ dizziness_ constipation (decreased over time),It's certainly not perfect_ but Cymbalta has worked pretty well for me.  Imporant to note that almost all of the side effects started off as severe_ then very gradually tapered off to a minimal or acceptable level. I was doubtful that the side effects would significantly diminish_ but_ over time_ they did.  For those who feel extremely sleepy when taking this drug_ I experienced that too--until I underwent two sleep studies and found out I have narcolepsy.  It's my understanding that often the Cymbalta lifts depression enough that people become aware of other medical and/or psych problems they may be having.One other note:  on the very first day that I took the Cymbalta I did have a brief episode of anxiety.  Nothing that caused a change in my actions_ but for three or four hours I had increased feelings of self-doubt_ anxiousness_ paranoia_ etc. However_ after the first day_ this never recurred.,M,47,9  months,4/8/2009,Cymbalta

1241, 5, Anxiety due to health problem,No real significant side effects in the beginning. Just sleep problems after 4 yrs of taking the drug. Wean myself off slowly! Long process but better outcome.,"I posted a message on 12/22/08 about weaning myself off. Well_ as of now 04/06/09 I finished my last dosage this week. Feel pretty good. Sleep problems are minimal. I sleep a deeper sleep instead of feeling disrupted. I have minimal ""brain zapping or twitching"" that you may call it and I know from the last few months that it will be gone within the week.What I did to wean off the drug is I started out with every other day for 1 month. Then I went every two days for another month. Again every 3 days for next month. And every 4 days for the last month. I did this on my own terms and decided this was the best way for me to handle it. Don't get me wrong_ in between each month or sometimes a day out of the month I had some dizziness and twitchng_ etc._ but I kept going. It got frustrating some days and I felt like I couldn't do it_ but each week and month got easier. I am so glad I did it this way. It takes alot of patience and will to tough it out. I would highly suggest doing this for anyone wishing to wean themselves off. DO NOT CUT OFF COLD_TURKEY. YOU WILL REGRET IT & HAVE A TOUGH TIME!

Very freaky!  AWFUL!  AWFUL!  AWFUL!,I was on Effexor with great success for my AD and depression_ but it made me SO sleepy all the time.  Dr. said cymbalta is closely related to Effexor but has less incidence of SE in most people - but HOLY MOLY!  My first dose almost had me calling 911 in the middle of the night!

I tried 3 other antidepressants which actually made me worse (I had severe social anxiety while on the generic form of Wellbutrin which I never had before) and Cymbalta is the only medication that has worked for me.  The night sweats can be severe but since the medication seems to be working it's a small price I am willing to pay.  Unlike some of the other medications Cymbalta worked slowly; each day I felt a little bit better.  While on the some of the others it almost felt like I was on speed as I was full of energy yet still didn't feel quite right.  After a few weeks on them I crashed and was actually more depressed than before I started taking them.  I am very thankful for Cymbalta!,F,41,5  weeks,3/28/2009,Cymbalta

Im appauld and disgusted that my doctor prescribed me this and after many times asking if theirs any other solution besides antidepressent she basicalyl yellled at me. All I can say is if your thinking about taking this drug its really not worth it ! I never thought that I would be the one to have a bad reaction to this drug I just thought the people were crazy that did_ and trust me their not !

1272, 1, Fibromyalgia,Detached Retina_ Night Sweats_ Weight Gain_ Dizziness_,This is my second post regarding Cymbalta. My first post was in early 2005 when I discovered it was very possible Cymbalta had caused me to suffer a detached retina. It was the only thing that had changed in my routine and after just having a thumbs up on my eye exam a few month's before_ I am certain it was the Cymbalta. My eyes will never be the same_ I will always have vision problems like floaters and difficulty when reading.  After reading through some of the newer posts here today_ I thought it was neccessary to update my post.Eli Lily had just added detached retina to their long list of 'infrequent side-effects' 2 months before it was prescribed to me. This tells me they knew it was happening to people. I fear that many others have had this issue but did not put the two together. Never go off cold turkey!

I am trying 30 mg's to see if i can get the same relief at a lower dose to avoid the fatigue. Had a few brain zaps cutting down to 30 mg's but not too bad. Helps the anxiety_ but not a total cure. All in all_ this drug works better than any other that I've taken for headaches and I've taken just about all of them plus tried every natural treatment there is.

The side effects crept up slowly_ at first I thought it was helping the depression and I'd noticed a lessening of my fibro pain_ but the longer I took it the worse my dizziness became_ I started getting weaker_ couldn't walk more then 50 feet without needing to rest and almost collapsing.   Then the fibro pain started getting worse and my depression worsened to the point of becoming suidicidal.,F,62,180  days,1/27/2009Email,Cymbalta
1337, 5, Depression/Anxiety,For the first 2 weeks I experienced nausea_ dizziness_ loss of appetite and dry mouth.  These slowly went away over time though and after  2 weeks they were pretty much gone. I just kept telling myself that after my body adjusts it will be worth it and I was right.  Remember to hang in there and give it a chance!,THIS MEDICATION GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK!  It took almost a month to fully kick in but the difference I notice in myself is absolutely amazing.  I can concentrate again and the dark cloud that has been constantly chocking me for the last 4 years is completely gone!  I went from someone who had turned off all her emotions to someone who can laugh and be passionate about life again.  Honestly_ give this a fair chance.  The side effects might be brutal at first but they DO go away and from then on it's all up-hill from there!  As far as I'm concerned the hardest part was going to my doctor and telling him I thought I needed help.

Irritatiability and less patience. Weight loss initially and now weight gain.,Cymbalta when first taken gave me increased energy_ relief from fibro pain and diabetes related foot numbness & tingling and weight loss so it was worth the insomia that I first experienced_ I had found the right medication finally and recommended Cymbalta to persons who suffered fibro.  After about 4-5 months the hot flashes_ sweating_ and olfactory hallucinations started. There have been pros and cons to my experience with this medication but the cons are starting to outweigh the pros so I plan to wean off of it in the coming months under my physician's care.,F,50,1  years,1/24/2009,Cymbalta

I feel more energized but it makes me feel as if I have had a bit too much caffine_ which I kicked 3 years ago (very sensitive to drugs).  I feel happy overall & have much less pain & achiness.  The drug is doing what it is supposed to so far.  My dr. warned that I could have a ""fuzzy"" feeling for a couple weeks so we will see if it gets better.  Not 100% sure about it's sexual impact_ as I may have had too much on my mind_ but I suspect it is the case after reading other comments.

It helps me with my mood swings and rage and ""grumpiness"" outbursts- I was on the verge of getting fired because I was always angry and just plain mean to talk to.I find it takes more concentration to do things and I am drawn to tasks that involve repetitious tedious type things (like sorting and counting out a bucket full of mixed nails_ for example). However with Celexa it was like my sex drive was cut off completely and I had difficulty orgasming. Cymbalta is nowhere near as bad. I do notice that orgasm is a bit delayed but also I am not 17 anymore so that's not so bad.Actually I feel like I did on Prozac however it's not as bad_ on Prozac I felt spaced out and could happily sit on the floor counting the grout lines in the tile floor all day long.

1351, 3, Dysthymia,Wellbutrin XL stopped working for me after 6 years. Cymbalta was the 2nd antidepressant my doctor had me try_ after Celexa failed to help. On 60 mg Cymbalta daily_ I had some nausea at first which went away after a few days. I also had a day or two of mild_ somewhat interesting visual alterations_ particularly at night; sometimes_ lit objects would go dim as I looked at them. This visual weirdness went away after 48 hours.  Cymbalta caused extremely dry mouth which lingered throughout the trial course. Cymbalta altered my orgasms; climax took much longer and was less intense.  The worst side effect was severe restless leg syndrome which disrupted my already crummy sleep. I had some samples of Requip and Mirapex I received from my sleep doctor_ which did help the RLS.  However_ my psychiatrist did not think it wise to add another drug to treat a side effect of this drug_ and took me off Cymbalta.,My dysthymia manifests as apathy_ cynicism_ lack of motivation_ head-to-toe body_ joint and muscle aches_ dyspepsia/IBS_ overeating_ physical and mental fatigue_ word retrieval difficulty_ 'brain fog'_ insomnia_ and a generally unsociable_ 'bah humbug/grumpy old hag' attitude. 60 mg Cymbalta daily helped my IBS a lot and modestly improved my mood_ attitude and motivation.  Cymbalta reduced my aches and pains by about 50-60% (Celexa actually worked better with a 90% reduction in pain).  Cymbalta did not worsen my insomnia and may have even helped a bit. I was able to enjoy a cocktail or glass of wine in the evening without problems. Unfortunately the negative side effects outweighed the benefits.  I was able to stop Cymbalta cold turkey with no problems_ but I also immediately started taking Pristiq and I've remained on Wellbutrin XL_ which may have minimized any withdrawal symptoms.,F,46,4  weeks,1/17/2009,Cymbalta

(especially in my waistline)  Haven't weighted this much in 23 years...literally!  Reducing calorie intake doesn't change my weight.  I don't know about other side effects because I have  symptoms similar to my fibromyalgia (and its preceding cause).,"YES!  It DOES cause weight gain...at least is has for me.  But when you are ""small"" to begin with_ no one listens.  All they say is you need to gain weight...even if it's not natural for you!!

I tried going to every other day & then every 2 days but this made the symptoms worse.  It wasn't until I saw that another man had actually removed 7 of the beads inside the capsule every day until they were gone_ that I got some relief.  You physically have to open the capsule and remove 7 beads the 1st day_ then 14 the next day then 21 the next day and so on.  It worked!  It was tedious but it worked.  It took me about a month of doing this until all of the medicine was gone.  I had minimal side effects and have now been off for 13 days and feel great!!,I would suggest that you take a vigorous walk or some form of exercise when coming off of this medicine.

I am surprised because I fully expected this drug not to work like the others. I figured Topamax was the big guns_and if that did not work_ nothing would. I also feel more positive in general_ whereas before I felt frustrated and down because of all the pain. Now I am functioning better and only think about headaches when I get them. I would have had less headaches than 7 days if I had taken my Zomig like I should have. Instead_ I took Motrin which made each headache drag on for two or three days.

1380, 5, Anxiety due to Chronic Pain (RA),Have been taking this drug for about 4 years. I have had no side effects until recently-last 3 months. Can't sleep or sleep too much. Little bit of blurred vision. Otherwise drug helped me tremendously through those rough earlier years.,I think everyone's body is different. It has a different chemistry for each drug we put into our body. I have to say that I started out with 60mg for the first 1yr and then dropped down to 30mg and this drug really helped me. I actually handled my pain better and life was more manageable for me. However_ the last 3-6 months I have noticed sleep problems that I can't relate to anything else other than this drug. I feel I am ready to wean off this drug anyways as I am dealing well with my disease alot better_ but am afraid of the side effects of withdrawls. I noticed before that if I missed a dose_ my body recognized it by the dizziness or the brain zap_ so I hope it goes well. My doctor says to try taking every other day to start with. I pray it works well!,F,42,4  years,12/22/2008,Cymbalta
1381, 4, Chronic pain; depression,I gained thirty pounds. Definitely made me sleepy while driving at first_ but that dissipated after two months. Sex drive plummeted. Super sweaty (especially my back). I read the boards and tapered very_ very slowly to get it out of my system. It took a few months to finally get back to normal.,I loved Cymbalta. It helped somewhat with my pain -- Fibromyalgia and vulvar vestibulitis -- though pain definitely still existed. More important_ it was the best antidepressant I've been on and I've tried Wellbutrin_ Prozac_ and Paxil. I was positively cheerful and unbothered while on it. No inappropriate anger. I was sorry to have to go off it.,F,41,1  years,12/22/2008,Cymbalta
1382, 4, Depression,"No side effects other than the ""zap"" feeling after skipping a dose (60mg per day) and minor sweating at night.  I did not have any of the flu-like symptoms when starting this med_ no headaches_ changes in behavior or weight changes.  Overall_ this medicine worked great for my depression.  Effexor was horrible when it came to ""zap"" feeling after skipping a dose...far worse than Cymbalta.",Everybody has a different chemical make-up when it comes to how drugs affect you.  Lexapro works great for my husband and other family members_ but only made me sleepy and cranky.  Sertraline (zoloft generic) worked great for me_ but after having my 2nd child didn't work as well as it once did.  Cymbalta works well for me.,F,33,2  months,12/21/2008,Cymbalta
1383, 2, depression,I wrote back on 11/20. Everything was good then. Things have changed.,I am quickly gaining weight now_I sit and accomplish nothing when Im not at work. My head often feels fuzzy and my memory has not gotten better. I dont want to be on this drug anymore. I am afraid of getting off so I am going to start taking my Prozac again and try to wean off Cymbalta. Prozac is the best thing to use to wean off with. My hair continues to fall out. There is no longer any benefit to it at all.,F,57, ,12/20/2008,Cymbalta
1384, 1, Anxiety and Depression,agitation_ anger_ anxiety_ panic attacks/panic disorder,This drug was great at first_ but after the first year on 60mg it seemed to not have as great an effect.  The last 6 months on the drug was when these side effects were experienced_ eventually leading to the panic disorder (which I now know was caused by interdose withdrawal.)  After a miserable experience with discontinuation syndrome_ even with slow tapering_ I would strongly encourage anyone considering this drug to do a lot of research first.  I'm not one to post my opinion on the internet but since this drug is currently being agressively advertised_ I was strongly moved to report my experience.,F,33,1.5  years,12/20/2008,Cymbalta
1385, 1, Depression-Chronic Pain,Horrible migraine_ and worst physical pain of my life. Could barely move a muscle (all of which were ridgid) after just one dose of 30 mg. All because my doctor did not read the prescribing information! Do NOT take this drug if you are using Ultram/Tramadol_ St. John's Wort_ HTP-5 or ANY Serotonin altering drug or 'natural' suppliment. You will get a Serotonin Syndrome.,This was first given to me while I was inpaitent_ even though I was on a high dose of Tramdol AND also taking an OTC suppliment called HTP...Read about Serotonin Syndrome_ it can be fatal. It is scary to think doctors do NOT always do their homework or really look at a paitents meds! (I am on 13 because I have an autoimmune disease). Cymbalta is bad news!

I take it and I get so swollen all over and the weight gain within 6 months is amazing. I wish we could get a petition to this company who said take this drug and you will feel wonderful. They should provide everyone who is having a tough time to get off this medicine with something to help you get off from it especially with the extreme side effects that effect your day to day life.,I hate it. If your doctor says to get on it please look up hypothyroidism and if you still want to take it then you have been warned.Believe me this is my second time trying to get off from it.

I stopped the prozac and immediately started on 30mg cymbalta for 1 week and now 60mg everyday.  I noticed within a few days I was sleeping better_ despite the vidid dreams.  During the day_ I feel more happy and excited.   I still have muscle and joint pain and it may actually be worse since starting the cymbalta.  The pain does slow me down_ but I feel so good mentally that I don't think about it.  Maybe after a while the pains will lessen.

Eventually increasing dose to 90.  I have actually felt more tired during day and difficulty with sleeping.  I have a tendency toward seasonal affect disorder and cymbalta  has not done anything to improve this.  In fact_ I feel worse this year as compared to last year when I was on Welbutrin and Prozac.

I was amazed at how quickly it began to lift my mood.  It also greatly lessened what I have heard called the 'Lizzy Borden' complex ( extreme anger and outbursts).  I am bi-polar_ and have also taken Lamictal 100 mg once per day on and off in the past.  In the past two weeks however_  my mood really dropped_ and I was feeling suicidal.  The doctor then put me back on Lamictal and told me to stay on it_ and raised my Cymbalta level to 120 mg.  I started taking the higher dose this past Monday (11-3-08).  Today is Sunday_ 11-9-08.  In the past three nights_ I have been experiencing insomnia.  I am really_ really shaky_ nervous_ a bit tense and I feel like I am having heart palpitations.

1417, 4, Depression & Anxiety,Some insomnia and decreased libido_ difficulty achieving erection and delayed orgasm.  Every medicine has side effects as well as benefits.,The true solution to treating depression & anxiety is to address the cause (i.e. its not always about a chemical imbalance in the brain...that's one theory).  Your brain doesn't come with a dipstick to measure the levels of neuro-transmitters!!!  Cymbalta and other anti-depressants are not the solution but a temporary band-aid to help you cope.  They won't make you miraculously feel better or happy.  In fact_ the drug companies who research and manufacture these chemicals don't really know how the 'medicine' works in the brain (its just a theory).  Seek the professional services of a Psychologist for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy at least once per week for at least 3-4 months.  Also read Eckhart Tolle's books 'The Power of Now'_ 'A New Earth' or buy his DVD titled 'Findhorn Retreat'.  Re-learn how and why your thoughts affect your mood.  Exercise (cardio) at least 4 times per week for 30 minutes each time_ and eat a healthy_ well-balanced diet.  You can cure yourself!,M,37,4  months,11/9/2008Email,Cymbalta

I was not depressed before taking it_ but now I feel down all the time and unmotivated. It is certainly not giving me the lift in mood I would think it would. Paxil helped immensely with anxiety in the past_ but caused me to gain a lot of weight. This drug at least has not caused any weight gain for me_ in fact I have lost a few pounds.

The good news -- I have lost 7 pounds in 10 days on this drug.  But I don't want to lose more than a couple more pounds and there is no sign of the weight loss slowing.  I had hives the first 4 days.  I am nauseous and have a bad taste in my mouth. I have trouble falling asleep_ staying asleep_ and then I wake up between 3:00 and 5:00 am every day.  As a result_ I am exhausted. I am wired and have severe_ frequent headaches_ along with blurred vision.  I am constipated.  I don't know how this works for pain because_ along with the headaches_ I now have back pain that wasn't there before.  To top it all off_ my depression is WORSE than it was when I was between med's.  I'm sorry I stopped taking Remeron now_ because my only real complaint with that was constant hunger.

I felt so tired but when I laid down_ I couldn't sleep_ racing thoughts_ agitation. When I was up & about_ I felt like I couldn't wake up from a bad dream. Felt like I was watching my life instead of living. Then the cramps started. White knuckle intestinal kind. I normally have severe IBS-C but ended up with D. Took days to recover. I'm sad this didn't work out. But I am glad that I only took the 30 mg tablet instead of the 60 mg the rheum. gave me. Evidently there is supposed to be a step-up period but some drs are misinformed. I think the company ought to provide much_ much lower doses to start with. (There's a 20mg but evidently that's not the standard sample handed out).,F,50,1  days,11/4/2008,Cymbalta

Consequently I'm now trying to taper off it (I'm in my 5th week) and and just can't seem to stop it w/o getting brain zaps.

However_ it gradually suppresses the 3rd_ 4th_ and 5th levels of sleep.  That's the deep_ good kind.  You will wake up feeling for sleepy than when you went to bed_ and all you'll think about all day is sleeping.  I slept through the last 3 months.  Wake up (3 alarm clocks) go to work_ come home go to sleep.  But the sleep you get is not good_ and your body will DEMAND that you go back to sleep.

The side effects that I experienced were not debilitating_ the only one that bothers me is the waking through the night but I think that's improving now. I do not get any negative effects if I take my dose a couple of hours late. This is the 4th antidepressant I've tried in the past 6 months & the first to give me any relief from my depression. I was put off by all the negative comments_ but am glad I went ahead. I think people are more inclined to post on these sites when they've had a bad time with a drug than when things are going well.

I am happy to report that after being off of it for six months_ I am back to my normal weight.  Don't let the doctors fool you-This medication will make you gain.  Getting off of it is no walk in the park either.  It took me nearly a month of very gradual tapering and still I experienced alot of dizziness_weakness and lethargy. Quite a price to pay for only a brief period of relief.  I would explore just about any other option before embarking on the cymbalta band wagon.  I have gone back to prozac.  I don't know why I ever stopped.,F,45,2  years,7/27/2008,Cymbalta
1512, 5, depression & anxiety,When first starting...Goosebumps and chills intermittently_ fatigue and sleepiness_ slight intermittent feeling of dizziness_ urinary hesitancy_ decreased appetite with slight weight loss.,"I started taking Cymbalta in March ""08"". It has been a success story for me. I feel very well and am enjoying life. My experiences with side effects are minimal and were only when first starting and adjusting to it.Goosebumps and chills intermittently_ fatigue and sleepiness_ slight intermittent feeling of dizziness_ urinary hesitancy_ decreased appetite with slight weight loss.None of these symptoms were distressing and abated after about 6-8 weeks.Now it's just a daily med I take and is no big deal. I have missed a dose occasionally and have not had any problems but I never would allow myself to miss two days doses as I know what paxil did to me with that experience.It has helped me so much that I don't contemplate going off of it. It doesn't make me feel addicted like paxil did.Why try stopping what has made such a positive difference to my health and well-being?...just to be miserable?Blessings to all of you.",F,52, ,7/25/2008,Cymbalta
1513, 4, Depression and anxiety,Initial headache_ nausea_ went away after approximately 1.5 weeks.,I was on lexapro on and off for several years with paxil (20mg) before that (20mg of lexapro at the highest and 5mg right now before I switched to Cymbalta).  Lexapro did not help with depression.  Actually_ Paxil was the BEST for anxiety but the side effects were not worth it for me - extreme fatigue and weight gain.  Lexpro had less weight gain but gradually I experienced more and more fatigue until I would lay around all the time and not want to do anything (which helped augment my depression ...).  Anyhow I'm on 30 mg of Cymbalta now and find I have ENERGY!  Without any trouble sleeping.  But I'm a bit anxious during the day - more so than I was on 5mg of lexapro.  So I take 1/2 mg of lorazepam on the jittery days.  Talking to my dr about mixing back in some lexapro for the anxiety.  But I think all around Cymbalta is the best for depression.  And other than not helping the anxiety as much as lexapro_ I have no side effects after 2 weeks.,F,26,2  weeks,7/24/2008,Cymbalta

Each person is different and may have other issues that don't apply to your situation. The best patient is one that is informed_ aware_ and communicates with their doctor. Cymbalta may not be right for you but don't stop trying to find one that is. I am sleeping better_ have more energy and decreased appetite. I have not had any bowel issues or nausea. I have not had any nightmares_ maybe even decreased dreaming which is okay because it gives my mind a chance to switch off.

I suddenly developed panic/anxiety disorder after over 30 years of being symptom-free_ and during my first month before Cymbalta I was a wreck.

A colonoscopy revealed lymphocytic colitis_ which after exhaustive research was found to be a 'rare/infrequent' side effect of Cymbalta.  My neurologist is weaning me off the Cymbalta with the hope that the colitis will resolve itself.  It's been 6 months since it began.....five of which were spent finding out what could be causing it.,I'm really disappointed in the side effect....and rather 'bummed out' that I have to stop taking it_ because it truly worked wonders on the pain aspect of the fybromyalgia.

However_ due to my ADD_ I tend to either forget to pick up my prescription or send it in on time before I run out of my Cymbalta so I have experienced the withdrawl symptoms. They are intense. The first day my brain gets foggy and I start to get more ""emotional."" The second day I started to get vertigo (intense dizziness_ almost like I'm drunk) which gets worse and worse the more days I don't take it. I've only gone up to a week without taking it because I finally figured out why I was getting so dizzy..I didn't pick up my prescription haha.

I also began having unbelievable night sweats and nightmares.At 60mg_ I couldn't wake myself up from my dreams. One night I thought that I shit myself. It was the most terrible nighttime experience I've had.

Don't believe everything that your doctor_ nurse practioner_ etc._ says about this medication or tells you about this medication. Read everything that you can about Cymbalta. Know thyself and learn as much as you can. Keep a pain journal to record your reactions_ and above all_ remember that you know your body better than anyone else does. Hindsight is 20/20_ and I'm ashamed that I didn't do more research into the side effects of Cymbalta. I never would have begun taking it. After finally getting a diagnosis_ which I was told by P&S I would probably never get and that I would need to take medication for the rest of my life_ I'm facing sugery on my hip for a torn labrum.

I came to my senses_ got dressed_ went out and found him but realized that this med was driving me to very bad decisions.  I never_ never intentionally put my dog in danger before_ or will again.

It has done wonders for me and within hours of having the baby I asked to be put back on it.  Depending on your chemical imbalance_ this may not be the drug for you.

I'm also on Wellbutrin_ and I take GHB for fibromyalgia.  With the cymbalta_ all these side effects started.  I can certainly live with all of them and the depression is so much better.  But the withdrawal symptoms I've read about are unsettling and it makes me wonder what this drug really does to your body in the long term.  If anyone has any info on this_ I'd love to hear about it.

Unfortunately cost is very high and was just laid off due to merger at my company so no insurance for now_ but think I will have to go back on in the short term as dizzyness/light-headedness is too strong to quit cold turkey.

1589, 5, depression,I take cymbalta in combination with wellbutrin. I had insomnia only when I was taking cymbalta in the evening before bed.  I later switched to mornings and then I no longer suffered from  insomnia.  After one year of cymbalta I started having regular severe constipation (5-8 days). I endured for most of a year and tried lots of things that didn't help on a consistent basis_ only temporary relief.  However_ now my family doctor suggested I try a combination of stool softener AND fiber supplement together and this combination seems to work. Taken on their own was not helping.  The only side effect that I haven't been able to change is the sexual side effect.  Orgasms just don't happen.  The desire is there but no physical arrousal.  There doesn't seem to be any engorgement of my clitoris and it doesn't care to be touched.  It's even smaller (less engorgement).  These side effects were not so present at the beginning of taking cymbalta.  It took about 8-12 months to really interfere.  How,After 5-6 months this medicine really helped my depression AND helped my other physical symptoms like muscle pain_ fatigue_ and muscle spasms/over-tightning to responses that I had suffered at different levels for many years.  I had no idea at the time that this medicine has been known to help these kinds of symptoms.  I told my doctor the big change I experienced in these symptoms and he said that it was probably because of cymbalta.  For the first 5 months or so I took cymbalta at night.  I had lots of new insomnia at that time.  My doctor then had me change and to take the cymbalta and wellbutrin in the morning.  After doing that for a 4 weeks_ that is when all the positive effects started happening.  When changing doses_ do it very gradually and don't have alot of other stressful things going on. I know this from experience.  I found it took a while to smooth things out (like a month or more) after altering.,M,40,3  years,3/20/2008Email,Cymbalta
1590, 3, depression_ anxiety_ pain,I think it is making me extremely tired during the day.  I am also on morphine_ and klonopin at night.  But I really didnt notice the extreme fatigue until I started cymbalta.  I also had no idea that it would be so difficult to taper down when/if I have to ever.  I have constipation but that is also cause from my morphine_ my vision seems to have changed to more of a blurry vision_ other that that I dont think I have any other side effects yet.  I have been on 60mg for almost 1 month but have forgotten to take it several times and I didnt feel any improvement with my depression and especially sensitivity to little things_ crying jags_ and lack of energy.  So my doc increased me to 90mg daily_ but after reading some of the other comments I am a little scared to increase it.  I am wondering if anyone has found the best time of the day to take it to avoid the daytime fatigue?  I cannot stand it_ I cant even drive when the fatigue sets in_ I cant live that way.,I am worried that this is not a safe medication.  Not sure if I should continue or not.  I am in the process of tapering down my morphine very slowly and also the klonopin slowly.  I take the klon. at night and the morphine is a smaller does in a.m. and a larger in p.m.  I am thinking maybe it is best to stay on the cymbalta to help me through the hell of withdrawal from morphine and klonopin_ and work on tapering down from cymbalta last.

I knew there would be a period of adjustment and some side effects and was prepared for the worst. I was on Lexapro a few years ago and the adjustment period was a painful 7 or 8 weeks. Within 2 weeks on Cymbalta_ I feel better than I ever really expected. The side effects were initially uncomfortable but experimenting with the time I took the dose helped tons! I don't think I'll need a stronger dose than the 30mg. I can understand why a higher dose could make you feel whacked-out. The number of people who try it for a few days and give up are suprising. I recently learned that consuming more than a a few cocktails while on it can cause some pain. Two glasses of wine are probably my maximum from this point forward.

I was very happy with the pain relief and mood elevation and decreased anxiety.  Then out of the blue_ the right eye developed a posterior vitreous detachment (floaters and tears in the retina) followed by the left eye a few weeks later. I found in the literature that retinal detachment is a rare but very serious side effect and reported it to my physician who reported it to the drug company.  This was in early 2006 and my eyesight has never improved-multiple floaters and sensitivity to light daily. The retinoligist said that there is nothing that can be done and it could progress to a retinal detachment in the future.

Decreased dosage to avoid increased side effects from abruptly discontinuing this medication. I realized that I decreased as best I could_ it was horrible.

I have tried nightime sleep aides_ and also work with .5 mg of Klonapin to try and get me to sleep and make me less anxious_ but all has failed. I have found I can concentrate on school work easier_ and except at night_ my anxiety is pretty good. I still have pretty bad mood swings_ but my depression has been cut in half from this medication. I would deffinatly recommend it.,F,18,2  months,1/20/2008Email,Cymbalta
1654, 3, pain_ anxiety and depression,Hot flashes_ sweating_ severe vertigo_ dizziness_ stomach problems (no nausea_ but other sensations like stomach flu_ diahrrea_ awful gas)_ tiredness_ spacey feeling,My Dr. prescribed Cymbalta for all the reasons stated.  It did help me.  My back pain was better_ I had no waves or flashes of anxiety_ I was happier.  But....when I had been taking it for 6 mos. at 40 mg._ the severe vertigo and dizziness started one morning.  I thought I was having a stroke.  All of these side-effects were just too much for me_ so the Dr. decreased my dosage to 20 mg.  I did okay going back down to this dosage_ no worse problems.  The vertigo stopped and the other side-effects have decreased by half_ except for the hot flashes and sweating. I am not as tired.  I will stay at the 20 mg. for the time being.  I will say that in all my years of taking prescription drugs_ I've never taken one that has so many harsh side-effects as Cymbalta.  I hope this entry will help someone as this website has helped me.  Good luck to all of you.,F,63,7  months,1/20/2008,Cymbalta
1655, 3, Depression/Anxiety,I've been on this medication for years. Major constipation; fiber does not help. Confusion is really bad_ lack of concentration is very bad.  Short term memory loss. Loss interest in doing anything.  I can sit for hours day in and day out with no interest in usual pastimes. I lost touch with all my friends because I have no interest in seeing them. However_ I have no anxiety while taking the medication.  Is it worth it?,Helped me with anxiety.  I don't think anything helps with depression.  I've taken one medication after another for 20 years.,F,61,3  years,1/19/2008,Cymbalta
1656, 5, muscle/joint pain/fibromyalgia,Lightheadedness for the first few days. Moved from 30 to 60 mg after one week. On 60 mg for 1+ months now,Very worried about comments concerning withdrawal. Until I read these_ I was thrilled to be able to get up and move in the morning without terrible pain. This is the best I've felt--MUCH less pain--than I have for years. I thought it was a godsend until reading the withdrawal symptoms. Now I'm worried.,F,49,1  months,1/16/2008,Cymbalta

I'm in the process of tapering off.  Quitting might be a bad experience_ but it can't be as bad as it was while I was on the meds.  (can it?)  Ugh.  I never would've started.  The little bit of help I got in the beginning isn't worth what I'm going through now.  Hands down this is the worst drug I've ever taken.,F,42,7  months,1/16/2008,Cymbalta

The major side effects rapidly diminish after week 1_ and are mostly gone by week 3. This is the first medication to truly work for my depression. I can actually go to class_ read and work on my hobbies_ as opposed to watching TV for hours on end. The vivid dreams were interesting to begin with_ but do get tiring. After about two months they diminish slightly. The night sweating is really annoying_ I have to change my sheets often and febreeze heavily inbetween. The loss of appetite comes and goes_ so don't buy much in the way of fresh produce because each day is up in the air as to whether or not you'l want to eat.,F,20,3  months,1/15/2008,Cymbalta

I always wondered ""what if something happens?"" I eventually became moody and would get upset with my hubby and kids for no reason at all. I was moody_ picked arguments_ was angry and just so tense_ nothing like myself at all.I started feeling relief after 3 days of taking the meds. I started on 30 mg/day and worked up to 60 mg/day. This has helped me immensely and the effects that it has had on my life were worth the side-effects for the first couple of months. Now_ I only experience cold sweats every now and then and something I can only describe as a hot flash.I am back to my old self_ which is fabulous. I'm happy and not the ""worry wart"" that drove my very optimistic husband crazy. I have much more patience with people_ especially with my kids.

I began taking it at night which caused extreme sleepiness during the day_ so I switched to taking it in the morning and all is well :),After having several MRIs and being in physical therapy for two years_ the cymbalta cured my unexplained back pain within a few days of starting it.  Switching from zoloft was an easy transition and I have more energy than with the zoloft.  It seems a lot of what people experience with this is patient-specific as it works well for some and not for others...there are also many psychosomatic issues to consider as well when reading these comments.,F,35,2  years,1/10/2008,Cymbalta

I went crazy (literally!) and came very close to harming my daughter who was pregnant with my grandson.  The withdrawal lasted more than a week and it was done with my doctor's knowledge and instructions.,I will never take this drug again NOR will I recommend it to anyone for any reason.

1673, 5, Severe depression,mild nausea_ insomnia_ lack of concentration.,Compared to the horrible darkness of deep depression_ this medication and even with the side effects is a lifesaver. I am able to get out of bed and function.  I am no longer angry and I have been able to do things around that house that only a few  months ago seemed hopeless. I still have to push myself every day to not go back to bed but I know Cymbalta has made a very significant difference and I will not stop taking it any time soon.  One other comment- this is a very potent drug. I have read postings where people state they are taking it for mild pain or stress....this strikes me as odd. why does a M.D. prescribe this for anything other than severe depression? I would advise people not to take it for anything else - it is a very potent drug.  Any side effects for me are better than the blackness of depression.,F,42,2  months,1/2/2008,Cymbalta

I didn't know i could ever feel so good again. Just days after starting the medicine_ I could tell a difference in my anxiety & patience levels.  However_ i considered getting off due to excessive yawning & sleeplessness.  After reading this website_ i decided to try to work through those side effects.  I'm SOOO glad I did.  I am happier than I have been in a long time.  I spent a lot of time in prayer over taking any type of antidepressant - i'm grateful God made people smart enough to make such a drug_ and had my dr prescribe it.  I use to go to the bathroom 15-20 times a day because of anxiety - now i can go an hour or more without having to go.  I feel like i actually have my life back!  Try to work through any side effects you are having (3-4 wks) it will be well worth it - besides i was more afraid of the side effects for coming off.  Good luck,F,35,10  weeks,1/2/2008,Cymbalta
1675, 4, Head Injury related depression,The medication works well for me but a warning to all! Do not ever stop taking the medication!,I was not able to afford it and stopped taking it and the results were DISASTER! I was not warned of the severe side effects (the Pharmacy label said...Headaches and tingling in the hands and feet..No big deal right?) Well_ I did not know the WITHDRAWL would turn in to my falling asleep at the well and then totaling my car(lucky I was the only that got hurt.) I lost my license_ my car and had to slowly get back on the medication.  I though I had a stroke. But no it was withdrawl from this medication and then it caused an overdose on my other medication (Trazadone)since they were not both in my system working together. So_ this medicine can work well but do not ever stop it because the headaches are bad and your speech turns in to salad then if you do not know this is what is happening and you drive then DEATH could be a side effect!,F,37,2  years,1/2/2008Email,Cymbalta

The feelings of chemical & withdrawl makes depression seem a better alternative.  The person perscribing it didn't describe it properly.  If I had any idea how bad the withdrawl would be_ I never would have taken this.  It's not even known if birth defects can result_ but it seems likely due to tests on animals...I feel my personality comes from the cybalta now_ not me.  I am very concerned about having a baby when I am still on this.

After awhile_ good (intended) effects started to wear off.,I do think this drug helped me for awhile_ but after several months I don't feel it is really helping anymore. I've tried lots of different antidepressants and at least in the short term_ this one helped the most. I'm now tapering off (at 90 mg dosage_ now down to 30 after 2 weeks) as I don't feel I'm getting benefits anymore and am tired of the side effects (even though overall they really aren't severe). I haven't had any bad effects going off except mild migraines every couple of days. I'm ready to find out what I am like when not taking anything -- I have had so many over the last 3 1/2 years.

I'll probably lose weight just from not drinking.)",I've been taking this for about two weeks now_ and so far so good.  I think the key is taking a very small dosage.  I actually opened up the 60mg tabs_ and just dip my finger into the beads and take about 10-15 of them (probably about 10mg).  It works great.  Sex drive is back_ orgasm is delayed and better_ no noticable weight gain/loss_ but it has made me enjoy excercise again.  Eliminated my anxiety issues when talking to people_ and I am new person at work.  Actually optimistic about my future!  It has helped me deal with ADD symptoms also.  I have been taking for a short time_ and I am worried about withdrawals_ but so far so good.  I took 60mg the first day and that was a BAD IDEA... couldn't sleep_ jittery_ upset stomach_ etc.  My advice would be to start with a very_ very low dose and work your way up.

It caused IBS and a lot of nerve damage/pain through my stomach and intestines. After 5 years_ it was the only thing that worked. I was like new in a week. In the past six months I've started feeling odd and having weird side-effects. I started on 20mg a day six months ago after being on 30mg for a year and a half.

It also made me very hungry when I first started it and whenever I increased dosage.,I have found Cymbalta to be helpful in reducing my anxiety_ but not as effective for my chronic depression.  Before_ I was starting to drink a glass or 2 of wine at night to reduce my anxiety.  Now I don't feel any need to drink to reduce anxiety anymore.  As for depression_ I took prozac years ago_ and found that much more effective in eliminating my depression. But Prozac also raised the threshold on other feelings_ which I didn't like.  Cymbalta seems to have a lower threshold in terms of blocking feelings.  So I still get the good feelings_ which I like_ but unfortunately I also still get the depression.  For perimenopause_ at first it seemed to help reduce the emotional over-reacting.  But it seems less effective in doing so lately.,F,48,4  months,12/5/2007,Cymbalta

I would like to know what other medications those who have some of the horror stories here are on. I'm no doctor_ but it seems like there are some combinations that would explain much of the issues above. Also_ it seems as though this drug isn't a great treatment for anything other than depression/axiety.

It seems that what some people are referring to as ""withdrawal symptoms_"" are really symptoms of adrenal fatigue and in the more severe cases adrenal exhaustion. Instead of just trying to ""wean"" off the drug_ I would highly recommend contacting someone who knows how to treat adrenal fatigue. One such person is Dr. Wilson. He is an N.D. who practices in Arizona. He has a great Website. Just google adrenal fatigue. He has also written a book called_ ""Adrenal Fatigue the 21st century stress syndrome.""

It is really_ really odd.  I also have MAJOR NIGHT SWEATS.  And when I say that_ I mean that I wake up with my sheets completely soaked_ my hair is soaking wet_ my clothes are completely wet_ etc.  Miserable!  My poor husband moves his leg over next to mine and it gets him wet :(I have gained 6 pounds and I am convinced it is the medicine as I have not changed my diet and have not gained 6 pounds in 4 or 5 years.The other complaint is the withdrawal.

Anyone who has ever taken Ecstasy_ it felt identical to that eaten up feeling of coming down. There is just no other way to describe it. Sort of like taking WAY too much pseudo ephedrine cold medicine_ the daytime kind. I'm also really sensitive to meds_ I have heard other people have had great experiences. Just figured I'd share.,Within hours of my first dose_ 30 mg_ I started shaking_ and I couldn't eat anything. I took it at 12:30 in the afternoon_ and by 7:00PM I was shaky and jittery and all of my muscles_ including my jaw_ were tensing up. I tried to sleep_ but I was completely wired_ like I was on speed. I didn't sleep a wink_ even after I got up and took 2 Unisom capsules. The next day I felt like I had the flu_ hot and cold and still shaky and unable to eat. I was  depressed and just stayed in bed all day. I won't be repeating that anytime soon. The side effects were ten times worse than being depressed and anxious.

Diarrhea_ which can be extremely annoying_ but I am figuring ways to minimize it (taking it on a full stomach is helping).,This medication has changed my life for the better.  I felt its positive effects within a day or two_ and pressed through the initial side effects because I was so encouraged by the anti-depressive features.  After one week on 30mg_ my MD increased my dosage to 60mg.  This did not help me!  My condition deteriorated rapidly_ at which point my doctor wanted to increase the dosage further.  I insisted that 30mg was working wonders_ and he reluctantly prescribed a 2 week course at 30mg.  Well_ that's where I've remained for 3 months now.  I'm very glad that I persisted with my opinion regarding the dosage.  The doctor still claims that 30mg is not even considered a therapeutic dose_ but I know what works.  I do continue to have digestive issues with Cymbalta_ but through trial and error_ am learning to minimize this.

I still use Xanax before I go to work to take the edge of my anxiety that leads to panic attacks. I have been diagnosed with post traumatic stress syndrome and have tried paxil_ zoloft_ celexa (gave me extreme internal cramping)_ lexapro (caused extreme weight gain) and now Cymbalta. It was within the last 6 days changed my mood to one that is upbeat and soothing to myself. I am not looking forward to the day when I have to wean myself from the medicienes however I was feeling so poorly that I felt I needed the relief I've found with the combo my doctor has prescribed.

I just didn't feel right and felt like I couldn't focus on anything_ and felt like I was in a worse fog than Fibromyalgia ever caused. It took about two days to feel ""normal"" again.

I have gained about 30 lbs.,"Started on 30 and went to 60 mg.  Dropped back to 30 mg_ because of side effects.  Just went back to 60mg/day (30mg in morn_ 30 mg after dinner).  Decided the benefits out weighed the side effects.  For myself_ there is a 2 week ""crazy time"" (named by my husband) whenever I changed dosages and when I started.  If you can get past those 2 weeks_ you will notice a fantastic change.  I actually get up and go out of the house.  I will do laundry and wash the dishes again.  My husband did notice that I tend to twitch for the first hour or so that I sleep.

1800, 4, ,Was on Paxil for 4 years and the past 3 months it hasn't helped the depression at all. My sister went from Zoloft to Cymbalta and told me to speak to my doctor.,I went in for an appointment 2 days ago. I see the doc every 6 weeks for medication mgmt. We spoke about the Cymbalta. He is weaning me off the Paxil while on 30mg of the Cymbalta. After I am totally off the Paxil_ I will take 60mg a day. I am looking forward to seeing how this medicine will help the depression_ my irritable bowel syndrome_ fibromyalgia and anxiety. As far as side effects- I already sweat and dry mouth all the time anyway. Any one of my 10 medications could be the cause. I am hoping the Cymbalta will work and the idea of losing weight_ is an answer to my prayers.  Once I start the 60mg_ I will update my comments.,F,54,3  days,8/30/2007Email,Cymbalta

I also take Depakote which causes weight ""gain"" so the Cymbalta evens out that problem.  Doc suggest I go up to 120 mg.  I dont see anyone here taking such a high dose??

Not a ""cure"" but it does help. I have been fatigued quite a bit_ however_ I am not sure if the drug is causing it or just the depression. If I miss a day_ I do have weird withdrawals though. Dizziness_ brain zaps (look this up if you don't know what I mean) and just an out of body feeling. Taking an Omega 3_ 6 supplement helps with these effects. If I didn't take this drug_ I would be in my pj's all day sleeping on the couch. Depression makes me unmotivated to do anything at all_ even socialize.

1809, 3, Depression_ Fibromyalgia,At first it was wonderful.  Fibromyalgia was much improved as was depression.  After about 3 or 4 months it stopped working on the pain and I noticed that I was having huge problems with anxiety and anger.  Similar to when I was on Prozac.  Trying to go off it has been pure hell.  I am suicidal and could kill my husband very easily. Absolutely no interest in sex or other activities.  I've been through it before with Prozac so I'm not worried_ I know it will go away.,At first I thought this drug was wonderful.  That was back in March.  After taking it 3 or 4 months it no longer helped the fibromyalgia but continued to help the depression.  I was on 30 mg twice a day.  The doctor suggested upping it to 90 mg a day but I was scared to try that after reading this site.  I get letters from my pharmacist whenever I haven't filled my RX on time warning me not to go off suddenly.  That is not a good sign.

Grrrr! I began with depression and now have another BIG reason for it!,"My doctor is usually caring and attentive_ but simply would not accept that the incredibly rapid weight gain I experienced in the months after I began taking Cymbalta was caused by the drug. Went last week to a doctor who specializes in HRT and discovered that Cymbalta does indeed cause weight gain and also learned why and how. Am now on hormone replacements and being weaned off the Cymbalta. 60 mgs every other day instead of every day. Have felt overall better and far less hungry_ though I don't yet dare step on a scale. Withdrawal symptoms: severe headaches_ nausea_ itching all over. However_ I have also learned that the hormones I am taking will ""plug into"" the receptors that were being filled by the Cymbalta. Please see your doctor if your symptoms are similar to mine and consider HRT.

I went to PT _ did Yoga and have shoe inserts_  but none of that helped with the pain.  In fact the pain seems to be getting worse.  Recently_ on my quest to find a solution I went to a neurologist  who diagnosed me w/ ""small fiber painful peripheral neuropathology. Anyway_ the doctor thought I might benefit from Cymbalta and he gave me a free 3 week course.

Taking it right before I go to bed has been helpful.  This drug has greatly reduced my depression but I feel really paranoid at work_ like others know I am taking something. The drug has also already helped me to not obsess about my ex-husband and our divorce anymore.   When I am at home I get alot more things done because I am not depressed and glued to the couch.  I have alot more energy.  The yawning is annoying_ because I am not tired.  In fact_ I feel wired.  My doctor said that the side effects will get better.

1884, 4, Depression & Pain for CTS,Oh it helped and was nice for the depression. Felt like a new person after 7 weeks but I only had minor depression (SADD) I took it at the time i was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel It helped that so much. Gained 12lbs in 30 days after 7 months out of no where. Dosed down from 60 to 30 for 3 weeks. Today is day 4 off it and I HATE IT. The withdrawls make you forget all the good,I took it for 8 months for depression initially. It turned out to help my carpal tunnel. Once I got over my seasonal depression_ which by the way I was a whole new person on it after 7 weeks. I wasnt willing to give cymbalta up because of the help with my hand_ until someone turned me on to B-6. I am writing because I decided to dose down_ what I thought was dosing down slowly.  They had me on 30 mg to start for two weeks then 60mg there after. I went to 30 mg for three almost four weeks. I went off completley this past Tuesday.

1933, 5, Depression,"Cymbalta has cured my life-long depression_ and eliminated my constant fatigue and irritability.  Prozac did nothing for me_ and I could only tolerate Wellbutrin for 1-2 weeks.  Cymbalta increases norepinephrine (along with serotonin)_ and I started having greater energy after only a day or two.  I started at 20 mg for the first 2 months_ and just increased to 30 mg 2 weeks ago. The only side effects I notice are a dry mouth (have to be more careful with dental hygene--I had 2 cavities while on Prozac)_ and that lately someone remarked (twice) that I am smiling a lot. :-)  I have felt almost ""too happy"" the last week or so.  But after a lifetime of depression_ there's nothing wrong with that.",Cymbalta has changed my life_ as my doctor and my counselor would agree_ and my best friend tells me.  I'm apparently growing new neurons in my hippocampus_ and it has given me the mental focus and clear-headedness that I so desperately needed working on my Master's degree.  I've read some negative comments about coming off of it_ but with the overwhelmingly positive changes it's made in my life_ I would be willing to stay on it for the rest of my life if I needed to.  But maybe with my lower dose (30 mg instead of 60 mg)_ it won't be as bad.  I'm not worried about it.  I hardly worry about anything anymore. ;-)  My life is going just great now_ the way it was always supposed to.,M,49,3  months,5/9/2007Email,Cymbalta

I lack the necessary enzymes to metabolize them (this is genetic_ some of us are born with low ability to metabolize many drugs).  Fortunately I found a Dr. who understands this.  He has me opening the capsule and taking only five of the tiny beads inside per day.  Sounds absurd_ but the improvement in my depression has been DRAMATIC.

I think I was retaining water because my clothes seem to fit better now that I am off the med.  Be extremely careful_ that's all I can say.  This med is truly a double-edged sword.

Not near as good as Lexapro was when I first started taking it. Saw that it was not working after a month_ just making me worse and I decided to get off it. I am on effexor now and I'm not sure I'm going to stay on it.  I heard it was making people dense_ like Lexapro started to do to me. The withdrawal I heard was also a pain.

1980, 5, Anxiety/Depression,For the first week_ I experienced extreme tremors and extreme fatigue. I was thinking about stopping the med because of the fatigue_ but I persevered. After about two weeks_ those side effects were gone. I love the way I feel.  Happy.  Way more calm. Confident. Creative. Excited about life. Motivated. I do have some strange side effects: hesitation to urinate_ yawning (big yawns)_ some insomnia_ some fatigue (due to insomnia?)_ missed period (not pregnant)_ and the craziest is very vivid dreams with many details.  Some are nightmares and some are wonderful. I compare it to the movie Jacob's Ladder Heaven and Hell mixed together....only not quite so bad. :),I have only recently began taking Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. Wellbutrin for about one year and Cymbalta for two months.  I feel like the benefits of Cymbalta are the reason I decided to try medication (I hate taking medication). The concerns I have are that I want to feel this way without medication.  Also_ I am very concerned about missing a period since I want to have kids some day.,F,32,2  months,4/10/2007,Cymbalta
1981, 5, chronic lower back pain,"The first few days were really strange - I felt happy_ but wired and a little out of sorts and not much pain relief. Now the symptoms have narrowed down to increased sweating - especially night sweats - I take 2 showers a day now (I'm a little concerned about this with the TX summer coming)_ dry mouth_ fatigue - I yawn a lot_ increased self confidence and overall sense of well being :)_ some pain relief (not as much as I'd hoped_ but it has been an improvement_ especially in my ability to cope with chronic pain); I've had a few rounds of upper respiratory crud (virus/bronchitis) - not sure if this is related to the drug as much as exposure to other people spreading ""the crud"" around work though. I'm actually coming to enjoy the fact that my brain is marinating in seratonin- it makes the side effects seem very minor_ though occasionally annoying.",The side effects really have been seeming quite minor - though I've gotten pretty hooked on having my morning cappiccino now in order to fully wake up! I posted before_ as I was really scared after reading this blog_ but my experience has been very positive. I have to stop taking the drug within the next 6 months - as we are planning on having kids next year_ but I have a goal in mind_ and can really pace myself and get off slowly (I'm feeling pretty good about this_ based on conversations with my doc and other information I've read out there on tapering off_ and nutritional supplements that can help ease withdrawal symptoms.)

Nerve pain was greatly reduced for 9 months until the med. just stopped working.  Pain began to come back. I experienced all the side effects I had read about thinking it was my ""age and hormones""_ then realized through this site that others have had it stop working.  Night sweats and vivid dreams were difficult. After worsening side effects for about a week_ they stopped_ constipation is gone_ and I have my libodo back!!!!  My doctor told me that Cymbalta can just stop working (I wish he had told me that earlier.)He has prescribed Wellbutrin XL now_ but it is not helping the pain_ only making me feel like I will fall over when I turn my head.  I don't know what else may help at this point. I also gained 20 pounds over the course of this med.  I jope it comes off now.

Only side effects now are CANNOT DRINK MORE THAN ONE OR TWO DRINKS OR WILL GET DRUNK AND BLACKOUT - also inhibited orgasm.,Was on Celexa - knocked me out and felt drugged.  Tried Lexapro with good effect but difficult getting out of bed - always tired.  Cymbalta total works on my anxiety and depression.  I have tons of energy and my mood is great!

My doctor put me on 30mg for a week then bumped me up to 60mg which I've been on for 2 months. It has worked wonders for me. The best time for me to take it is around 5pm with a good meal.

Also_ not sure if this is cymbalta_ but I have a swishy feeling in my ears (not a ringing--more of a cloudy sensation) that comes and goes.,Cymbalta was prescribed to address pain associated with fibromyalgia and vulvar vestibulitis. It hasn't really done much for the pain_ but it has affected my mood very positively. Initially_ I was euphoric_ now after 6 months_ I am starting to notice old feelings of annoyance creeping in.

I have extremely vivid_ epic dreams every night. Wild stuff!  Also_ my hair is falling out.  Not in clumps_ but after every bath the drain has 10-15 hairs in it_ and any time I run my fingers through my hair several will come out.  I am anxious about this_ don't wanna be bald.  This would depress me_ make me angry and agitated!!!",I don't want to be dependent on meds forever.  I am trying to wean off.  I have been on 60mg daily for about 5 months.  I am currently doing every-other-day dosing which is working ok_ though I am noticing my agitation returning. I missed a dose last week and boy howdy was that freaky.  Vertigo_ nausea_ did not feel like I could pull through.  That was at the beginning of my weaning_ though.  I now feel like I could skip 2 days without severely adverse effects.  Maybe.

Will this go away? Has anyone else experienced this?,Let me give you a brief history of the meds I have taken. I started having panicky attacks at the age of 18 and tried all the ssri's and was put on ativan as needed. The whole benzo road was a nightmare getting off_ so I decided to just deal with the depression. Around 2003 my Dad was dying of cancer so I was put on valium and effexor. On top of that I was doing some heavy drinking and taking a lot of opiates. I became heavily addicted to opiates and finally tapered down with my doctor and have been off for 2 weeks. Now I feel like my life is wasted. When I was on the opiates I wasn't depressed but everything around me was falling apart. My doctor has me on concerta (which helps me focus at work)_ klonopin 1mg as needed for anxiety_ bisoprolol (blood pressure) and now the cymbalta for depression. I just don't know if this is a good combo. The reason for getting off the opiates was to feel better_ and now I just don't know what I feel.

Before Cymbalta I tried Anti inflamatories_ Steroids and on occasion_ Vicodin for the pain which was severe at points. I was significantly limted for 6 months before trying Cymbalta.

2072, 3, Depression,I started out on 60mg_ which was a way too high dosage to start out on- lay on my bed for 2 days staring at the ceiling_ not being able  to move; also experienced blurred vision_ nausea_ excessive sleepiness_ yet inability to sleep ---------- Was so paranoid after this episode that I didn't take it for a month again_ but t my doctor recommended that I rather slowly get used to the drug_ taking 30 mg every second day_ and gradually increasing the dosage ----------- Second time round the side effects in the first week were minimal and even quite pleasant- had so much energy that I could get by with 4 hours sleep. This stabilised later on though ----------- As I upped my dosage_ my libido started taking strain though and I had trouble sleeping --------- At 60mg_ I started experiencing excessive sleepiness_ needing a nap at least once every afternoon. ,I tried Cymbalta at difference dosages and my general impression when I was taking 30mg and later 60mg day was that Cymbalta helped a great deal for my anxiety- I just felt in control again and stupid chores didn't seem like such a big deal anymore. At 60mg however_ my sleepiness just became unbearable. Needing a nap every afternoon just isn't OK for me. My libido also just did a disappearance act_ which I simply couldn't handle. Despite helping with anxiety_ I just didn't feel like my mood was lifted sufficiently and that I almost didn't feel like myself anymore- almost just too calm (where I like certain of my manic traits).---------- I quit Cymbalta two weeks ago and I must comment that I didn't experience the horror withdrawal symptoms that everyone talks about_ but perhaps because I slowly reduced my dosages. I'm now taking Wellbutrin SR and this seems to be doing the trick for me. I reckon that I perhaps just needed a difference class of drugs ---------- So_ in my experience_ C,F,25,60  days,2/1/2007,Cymbalta

2076, 4, Depression/ Bi Polar DO,The first month was terrible.  Nausea and loss of appetite to the point where I ate almost nothing for 3 weeks.  I slept most of the month.  Gradually things got progressively better.  This is a great medication minus the withdrawl symptoms (sweating_brain zaps_ dizzyness).  It has definitely changed my life for the better.  I was very suicidal before and now it's an almost irrelevant contemplation.  Like any medication_ it takes some getting used to.  I read some comments on this page and have had some similar side effects.  Increased sex drive_ hypomania_ vivid dreams_ increased orgasm (oh yeah!!!)_ i have become more aggressive than I was in the past.  The bad part about this drug is the lack of creativity in my work being replaced with compulsiveness_ i'm very verbally and could be physically agressive_ i have to watch my behavior a lot of the time. night sweats (actually waking up drenched some nights)_ if i miss a dose the effects are very noticable_...i missed it for three or 4,It's Jan 29th now and I'm married_ holding a steady job_ i moved across the country_ quit smoking_ no drugs_ rarely suicidal and most importantly very happy with my life and choice to stay on cymbalta.  My advice is to tough it out during the first month.  It can be hard and might be even harder for you than in my experience.  You won't regret it.,M,23,6  months,1/29/2007,Cymbalta

I take 60 mg daily.,Cymbalta has unquestionably been the best antidepressant I have ever taken (in 30+ years) - A few years ago_ I failed all other antidepressants and combinations of various psychiatric drugs.  As a last try_ my psychiatrist prescribed Cymbalta immediately after it was FDA approved. Cymbalta gave me back my life.  I still cannot believe how well it has worked for me.  Family and friends want me to continue on Cymbalta indefinitely.  However_ I have been having very severe problems with nausea_ dizziness and vomitting and I don't know if I will have to discontinue Cymbalta soon to reverse these issues_ unless another cause can be detected and treated.,F,50,2.5  years,1/28/2007,Cymbalta

2088, 3, depression / physical aches &pains,Inability to orgasm. Noticable dry mouth. Sleepy and groggy. A dramatic decrease in appetite. Frquent urge to urinate. Mild constipation,I went to the doctor complaining of lethargy and bodily aches and mild depresion. I began taking 30mg_ and then after 1 week moved up to 60mg of Cymbalta. I immediately lost ANY ability to reach orgasm. Belive me I've tried_ to the point of exhaustion. After years of a good and active sex life this was not acceptable. I've never went this long without an orgasm since I was 12 years old. Went back to the doctor and he perscribed Wellbutrin SR ( 150mg ) to take in addition to the Cymbalta to counter the side effect. This is the first time I have ever been on any kind of depression medication_ so I remain a little uncomfortable taking both of these pills. Only been on the Wellbutin a few days but am having the same ejaculatory problem_ hope with time it will come back.  I do think I feel a little less depressed overall_ and the body aches have gone away completely.

DPN not going away_ still have loss of some feeling in toes.  Gotta kick the typre 2.  Again_ I feel like road kill if I miss even one day_ two days is extremely unpleasant.  I have noticed a bit of blurred vision and a tendancy to smoke more.  Confidence is up and I'm less likely to be overly-sensitive.

Results for me were within first week. No real side effects. 60mgs daily. When I've had to go off_ nothing major...some dizziness but that's it. Nothing else had worked with me for my obsessiveness ... I wanted to write Eli Lilly a thank you letter when I first started taking it. Seemed to stop working after six months in a row not sure if that is because I had increased stress or I was drinking more than usual (never a good idea to drink to much when on a med).,F,33,2  years,1/14/2007Email,Cymbalta

But when she got on the medication_ she forgot about my warning and she completely wigged out_just like me!  She is about 40 yrs old & I am 53.  Cymbalta is a DRUG with a bunch of marketing HYPE!  Don't let a physician try to give you a sample of this poison...or you'll be sorry!  The physicians probably get a kickback from the Pharm Co to push this awful mixture of chemicals!  I think that all Physicians who prescribe this medication must first themselves take it for a minimum of 6 months! I guarantee you_ if they did_ they would no longer be practicing medicine---they would be practicing how to make tatoos in a prison cell!I sure would like to slip Cymbalta in my former doctors' coffee cup every day!

The first few days I would yawn constantly_ it was a weird fake yawn but I felt compelled to do it. Also the first couple of nights while sleeping I would clench my jaw to the point when I woke up and started with the yawning it hurt. My pupils are huge were co-workers and friends have noticed and asked ""What are you on?"" Currently I'm still very tired all the time_ I'm constantly trying to figure out how I can fit naps into my day_ or sleep in longer in the morning_ going to bed earlier. I used to be very active (anxiety) I could never sit still_ I hated to sit down and watch a TV show or Movie. Now I rather stay in on the weekends and watch TV and nap. This was kind of nice at 1st but now I'm getting worried. I'm tired all the time_ I can nap during the day but at night I wake up almost every hour tossing and turning and bad nigh",Aside from being tired all the time and conspiring to sneak in naps through out the day_ Cymbalta has helped greatly with my GAD and depression. My anxiety was on the verge of ruining my relationship with my boyfriend of 3 years but now things are great. I feel very secure_ like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm independent and free from my repetitive and negative thought process. It's very refreshing. I do have a harder time reaching orgasm but I find intercourse to feel 100 times better. I just hope the tiredness goes away and that soon I will sleep at night.,F,29,1  months,12/27/2006Email,Cymbalta

Now its easier and_ after the effort_ it lasts much longer than before and is an all over body feeling. Feels a bit tantric actually. My partner enjoys the extra length of time it takes too - though can be pretty exhausting after an hour so sex happens less then before since it needs plenty of time. Would actually really miss this now. Did stop briefly taking it because  of the sleepiness but the pain came back big time. Am just hoping the side-effects will lessen in time.

The only negative is the insomnia and constipation_ but I have found that as time goes by_ the insomnia is not as severe and I am waking up less and less in the night (going to sleep is not a problem_ the problem was that I kept waking up).  For constipation_ I have solved that problem by eating a high fiber diet:  high fiber cereal for breakfast (Fiber 1 Honey Clusters is fantastic!); peanut butter or beans and multi-grain bread for lunch; and beans and brown rice for dinner_ or a whole baked potato with skin_ lots of veggies and fruit and high fiber snack bars and nuts.  My sex drive has decreased_ and it's harder to orgasm_ but when I do orgasm it is unbelievable_ definitely not like before.  One thing about Cymbalta is that I no longer like the taste of alcohol so I don't drink anymore whereas before I started taking it I was drinking about 2-3 drinks per night.

Experienced thru-out taking drug:  dizziness_ fatigue_ head spins_ thirst_ bloating/gasiness/burping_ intermitent night sweating - waking up in drenched sheets_ increased appetite_ cravings for sweets_ and vivid dreams.Experienced when getting off drug or missing/increasing dose:  Nasea/throw-up_ sudden sleepiness_ extreme head spins.Experienced after first 2 months:  rapid weight gain (15 lbs)_ hair loss_ odd itchy acne-like bumps_ feelings of depression incresed:  unmotivated_ unsocial_ no desire or energy to do anything.,I am hypothyroid and take synthroid and cytomel.  I've gone to different docs over the last 4 yrs in search of the ideal treatment.  My new endocrinologist suggested that I was depressed because the blood tests showed that my thyroid was fine. (Symptoms of hypothyroid are similar to depression).  My GP suggested Cymbalta.  I've never been treated for depression before.  I was about to get married and along with a stressful job_ my GP felt I needed to be on this drug.  And_ initially_ it did help.  I was more calm and didn't let things stress me out.  But_ after the wedding (or about 1-2 months of being on the drug)_ I think the drug stopped working and I started gaining weight and was tired all the time.  The hard thing for me is differentiating the symptoms/side effects of Cymbalta and my Hypothyroidism.  Is anyone out there on Cymbalta AND Synthroid?I went to my GP with these complaints and she talked me into staying on it.

Sex drive was not here_ this bad bad bad side effect went away after 2-3 weeks.,Extremely impressed with cymbalta.  Doc started me out on 60mg (not sure why not 30mg since im a first time user) but after a few days of my body getting used to it I was okay.  I was also put on 10mg valium_ these two combined have taken me from wanting to stay inside the house every day to actually wanting to be productive.  I always thought everyone was staring at me_ now I really dont much care if they were or werent staring.  Also I had extreme intensified dreams.

This medicine made me feel terrific and I dropped 54 lbs.  I emotionally felt like a new person.  Finally I felt hope in my life.  It also helped with my pain from my osteoarthritis.  I would've been a spokesperson for the product.  Now_ my hair is falling out at a rapid pace.  I want to know will this ever stop_ or will I be a bald female?  Does anyone know?  Has anyone's hair come back after they stop taking it?  I'd love to have my mind eased on that question.  My doctor took me off it cold turkey to absolutely make sure this is my affliction.  I have taken Effexor and had terrible nightmares and gained weight.  I tried Welllbutrin and got a terrible case of hives.  Does anyone know if the hair loss would've eventually stopped?

Modest delay of orgasm although they seem to be more intense when achieved.  I guess that's a fair trade.  First couple weeks experienced some sleep disturbance_ which is resolving.  Doctor helped me through that rough spot with Ambien CR.,Fast acting.  For me it is the only drug in its class which has virtually obliterated my anxiety and panic attacks.  I would say 95% positive benefits vs. 5% negative side effects.  All other things being equal I will stay on it.  Celexa_ Lexapro_ Welbuterin did nothing compared to this.

Cymbalta worked well for my joint pain but getting depression was worrisome.  My mood was very one sided.  Always emotionally ""up"" no matter what. The real big problem with this drug was the withdrawal.  I had to stop taking it when I changed jobs and was out of insurance for a time.  The drug is very expensive.  It took me 5 months to withdrawal from Cymbalta and it was hell.  I had hallucinations_ horrid nightmares_ high blood pressure_ heart palpitations just to name a few side effects.

I was so scared to try anything new_ I had been on St John's Wort for two weeks when Dr gave me Cymbalta.  I NEVER take the Cymbalta without the St John's Wort too_ 'cause I was scared of the side effects.  It took about 2 weeks_ but I was the happiest person ever for the first 4 months.  Absolutely no side effects at all.  But in the last 3 months_ things have changed a bit.

I've been on the 30 mg dosage for two weeks_ and the hair loss and sexual dysfunction continue.  Although Cymbalta began to reduce my depressive symptoms within the first two or three days I started taking it_ and it has been more effective in that respect than any other antidepressant I've taken (including Trazodone_ Prozac_ Zoloft_ and Wellbutrin XL)_ I don't think I'll continue taking it.  I'm not interested in going bald_ nor do I want my sex life to evaporate altogether.  Now my biggest concern is being able to stop taking it.  From multiple comments I've read on online from many others who have taken and then stopped taking Cymbalta_ it sounds like a nightmare.

2237, 2, Anxiety_ Depression,Several sexual side effects (40 mg+),"Completely ineffective anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication_ I had to be tapered immediately down from 60 mg to about 30 mg_ very soon thereafter to almost none.  I do not intend on continuing taking cymbalta.  Other than its complete lack of effectiveness_ the sexual side effects (similar to ones experienced with Effexor XR_ also a popular ""SSNRI"") were absolutely severe and intolerable.  I've been on many SSRI's and other meds with a high chance of sexual side effects_ and only_ possibly_ effexor_ was worse than cymbalta in this area.",M,22,5  months,8/17/2006,Cymbalta

Still have everything else.,It's worked for me so far. I'm willing to deal with itchy skin and not eat if it will get rid of the depression. I was on Paxil throughout high school_ took a break from meds and then couldn't stand it anymore. On Cymbalta_ I'm more comfortable in social environments_ not as anxious about everything_ have more get up and go. I don't space out like I used to_ it's easier to pay attention to what's going on around me_ I don't stay in bed all day anymore_ I can do things like a normal person.After reading other comments_ I'd say it's definately not for everyone_ but no medicine is. Also_ stopping a medication without consulting your doctor first is dangerous_ not to mention dumb. I tried it with Paxil_ and the first day I didn't take it I passed out during a volleyball game. It wasn't the drug's fault_ it was mine.,F,21,3  weeks,8/16/2006,Cymbalta

I broke them open and counted 273 granules within one capsule_ divided them out and re-capsuled three with 91 granules each. Then I took 81 granules in a capsule on the fourth day. By the fifth day (today)I decided to just not take this anymore because I am so freaked out- absolutely frightened_ really. Even today my heart is still racing. Thank goodness I had Xanex and my husband or I'd  have surely gone to the ER of the hospital.I thought starting/stopping Effexor CR was bad- oh boy!

The side effects only lasted a while.  I tried Webutrin_ and that hadn't done anything.  However_ it's now been a year_ and suddenly_ I'm having weight gain_ NO energy_ no sex drive_ and difficulty in reaching orgasm when my sex drive DOES appear.  At the moment_ under Dr.s advice_ have reduced back to 30 mg while he also does other blood work looking for another reason (thyroid?)_ and also back in therapy.

THE DOCTOR NOR THE PHARMACY WARNED RE: A WEANING PROCESS. I quit cold-turkey and didn't know for days it was the drug withdrawals. I thought I'd die.

2245, 1, anxiety/mild depression,I have been on Cymbalta for 8 months. I have been so fatigued that standing up is too exhausting. The more exhausted I become the more depressed I became. Depression has never truly been a problem with me before. To add to my problems my blood pressure shot up during my treatment. I had been on adderal for 3 years and that didn't raise my blood pressure. Time and time again I have asked my Dr. if Cymbalta could be the cause of my problems. It really upsets me that everytime a new drug comes out the medical community basically ignores the past meds and starts writing the new drug. I wanted my Dr. to give me Luvox which has worked great for me. Reading these posts I can't believe that they are letting this RX still be written.  I have had the worst 8 months of my life. The sooner I get off this horrible drug the better.,,F,46,8  months,8/8/2006,Cymbalta

Had bad dreams and started to panic because of the way this drug made me feel.  This drug needs to be studied more. Be careful when taking this drug. I called my pain mangament doctor who gave me this drug. He said he didn't know that this drug had that many side effects. Was told by Lilly that this drug had hardly any side effects and is the best on the market.

I took my first and ONLY dose of Cymbalta (60 mg) at 8:00 AM yesterday after breakfast.  Almost immediately I started to sweat_ began to feel very ill_ and proceeded to throw up all morning and into the early afternoon.  I could barely move or get out of bed.  At one point I was certain that I was having heart failure_ because my entire body seized up and I could not move or speak.  It took me a day and a half to finally sleep_ and I couldn't eat or drink anything until around 9:00 this evening (juice and some crackers).  I still feel dizzy and nauseated_ and my hands and feet are tingling.  The only reason I'm sitting up at all is so I can warn others NOT to use Cymbalta.  This stuff is like rat poison!!!

Some slight effects of withdrawal are already happening.  If anyone out there has any suggestions or advice...I am open to anything.  I'm very scared as to what is going to happen.  It took me a year and a half to withdrawal from Peroxetene.  My doc and I concluded that I am intolerant to SSRI's.

Between exile from my sports and the chronic pain_ added to a history of major depression_ I spiraled down into a major depressive crisis.  Doctor put me on Cymbalta about 10 days ago and the positive effects were almost instantaneous.  Within three days I was able to think more clearly_ control my behavior_ concentrate on work and finish something_ and I have been walking much_ much better and in much less pain.  I'm on 60 mg and have actually never felt better in my life since I'm usually more or less depressed (though with a basically good attitude).  I plan to stay on it at least until after my hip surgery and perhaps longer.  I can imagine for some people it's not the right drug_ but it has saved my life.,F,54,10  days,8/2/2006,Cymbalta

Sweats_ nausea_ tightening of muscles for no reason_ tooth grinding resulting in horrible jaw pain_ the feeling of high blood pressure (hot headed_ restless).  I missed 4 doses in a row and began experiencing the 'zaps' -- mini zap like feeling in the head_ similar to my withdrawal from Peroxetene.

So I stopped taking it (about 8 months ago) and I'm_ well_ more alert than I was while I was on it.  I can't remember the last time I cried and I cried almost daily while taking this medicine.  I also almost can't even understand how or why I wanted to kill myself while on this medicine.  I guess it did affect my brain chemicals_ but in a rellly BAD way.

By the time I had been on 30mg for a month and went up to 60mg_ I had more energy and was noticeably more cheerful.  I was finally getting out of bed every day_ cooking sometimes_ even doing the dishes_ watering the lawn.  I even started exercising every other day.  The Bad News-- I experience very severe bloating_ especially premenstrually.  However_ having crohn's disease_ I could not yet be certain that it was from the Cymbalta.  But then we raised the dose to 60mg and the bloating has gotten even worse-- before when I got bloated_ at some point my belly would finally go back down to its normal size.  Now it never does.  This is making me feel more depressed and anxious.  Some of my depression and anxiety is due to the effects the crohn's has on my body-- I feel ugly and hopeless_ don't want to leave the house_ and obsess about it.  So being bloated is very bad news for my emotions.  I am tempted to go off of it_ but I have already been on,F,33,2.5  months,5/18/2006Email,Cymbalta

Took w/ food and at bedtime (when possible ie_ at 30mg and tried w/ 60mg instead of 30 twice a day also tried 30 twice a day). Did Work WONDERS for 1-2 mths - more energy_ less nerve and back pain. Once increased it went downhill - cannot get that same good result at the lower dose. Might try going off completely_ wait_ then go back on just at 30.  More than that and you're sleeping for life. Not sure how long good parts will last at 30 though... we'll see....  (Total took for 5 mths about). I think Neurontin might be better.

I also have a harder time reaching an orgasm.  When I first started this medication_ I heard voices while half awake(they were way too clear). Voices???? This was something I had NEVER experienced before!  It really scared me.  I told my doctor_ and was told it could be me adjusting to the medicine.,I was on Paxil_ and I did not have as many side effects.  I think I will be switching back to Paxil very soon.  My symptoms have just gotten worse over the time_ while taking Cymbalta.  It's just not doing what I expected.  I feel that this may be good for some_ and not for others.  I definitely don't think it is good for me anymore!  I will be speaking with my doctor about another medicine I can take_ during my upcoming visit.,F,36,6  months,5/2/2006Email,Cymbalta

2343, 2, depression_ nerve pain,night sweats_ nausea_ increasing apathy_ short-term memory loss. Sleep disturbances.,"Because it is a relatively new drug I did not want to take it at all.  My luck with anti-depressants has been poor. However_ my doctor (a very young family practice M.D.) swore by it and I accepted his recommendation.  Started @ 30 mg. and had sleep problems immediately.  Either too much or too little.  After almost5 months on the drug (the last 4 @60mg.) I now want OFF of it.  I have progressed from mood swings to to ONE mood --the basically ""I don't care"" mood and want to sleep all the time.  My pain level is worse because of spending so much time in bed_ but I feel exhausted all the time.  I feel as if I am living under a blanket with no real feelings.  I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.  I do not think there is enough study on it to do so_ and with my own experience being more negative_ I just could not do so in good conscience.

Have lost 16 lbs. since February which I really needed to lose after being on Neurontin_ Lamectal and Ponstel since December.  I will never go on Neurontin and Lamectal again. I'm abit more spunky than I used to be.  The Dr. increased me to 60mg. a day after about 3 weeks.  That seemed to help me alot.,Noticed after about 2 weeks that not only the pain and burning in my legs disappeared but also the pain I had been having with Cervical Spondylosis has subsided too.  I've been suffering with that since 1996.  Its nice not to get up in pain every day.

2346, 5, neuropathic pain - low back,I am a doctor and I can tell you....BE VERY VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS DANGEROUS DRUG!!!  Began on 30 mg and had insomnia_ nervousness and anxiety.  Went to the therapeutic dose of 60 mg to help my back pain AND I HAD A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE THAT ALMOST PUT ME IN THE ER.  By now I'm sure you know a college girl killed herself during the drug trials.  It can happen. This is not just an SSRI.  It alters THREE neurotransmitters and for some - that's a serious problem.  I flushed $120 worth down the toilet after one horrible night.  This is a SCARY drug and should be re-examined by the FDA.,See if your Doc knows the details of this drug before you take it.  Sure_ it may help some_ but it is dangerous with others.  Question is_ how do you find this out?  Are you willing to be test subject?  This drug should be pulled and re-studied to be safe.  When you start_ have a friend or spouse alerted to potential bizzarr behavior and perhaps the ability to get to a hospital.,M,52,5  days,4/14/2006,Cymbalta
2347, 1, Anxiety - Depression,Whoever coined the term Brain Zaps - PERFECT NAME_ as that is exactly what it feels like.  I have been weaning myself off 60MG to 30 to 20_ very quickly.  Over a week and 1/2 - All was generaly OK until I stopped taking the 20MG - BRAIN ZAP City. Dizzyness_ etc.  I am somewhat afraid to drive.  Also_ VERY difficult to wake up in the morning - I feel like have been hit by a truck. I am hopeful the zaps will subside soon - I am going to take suggestions of water_ fish oil and vitamins to see if they help. As for the male sterility - I went to a new GP as I recently moved from Atlanta to Houston - I am 36 and my wife is a very healthy_ very fit 26 years of age.  We have a beautiful 26 month old daughter and have been trying for almost a year to get pregnant again - Although I have read about the sexual sde affects......suffice it to say my new GP indicated he has heard about Cymbalta causing issues for men when trying to get their wives pregnant - I am not sure if it truly lowers,,M,36,1  years,4/13/2006Email,Cymbalta

It was an awful experience.  I was MUCH worse on it than I was before.  The withdrawal symptoms were stronger than those from taking the medication.  After 10 days of being off Cymbalta I am still having serious problems with my GI tract.  After eating the pain gets much worse.  I am shocked that a medication can cause symptoms for so long after discontinuing it.  Cymbalta is in my opinion a very harmful drug that shouldn't be taken lightly.,F,44,5  days,4/12/2006,Cymbalta

GETTING OFF THIS MESS: Dizziness to the point of being non-functional (for 2 wks) left arm/hand went numb several times per day (still happening 1 mo later) electrical shocks (brain zaps) in the head_stress urinary incontinence (they prescribe cymbalta for this-I never had it until I quit taking cymbalta-go figure) nightmares_ crying spells that lasted for hours_ earache_ flu like symptoms lasting 2 wks_ unbelievable body and muscle aches_ to name a few.  It truly felt as if I was losing my mind and my physical body as well.  It was a horror I will never subject myself to again.  I am happy to have this out of my system_ for the most part_ and will be happier when all of the withdrawal symptoms go away.  I hope they go away.,F,48,3  months,4/12/2006Email,Cymbalta

I take the lowest dose once a day (before bed) and can eat so many things that I couldn't before taking this.  The lowest dose is not strong enough to help depression_ but that wasn't my problem.  The norepinephrine that is in Cymbalta slows down the digestive tract_ but the serotonin that is in it keeps it from slowing down too much and causing severe constipation.  VERY HAPPY with Cymbalta.,F,22,4  months,4/9/2006,Cymbalta

I am hoping Effexor will calm the hair loss and not comtinue it.headache in the neck wich did become severe(migrane-like?)and eye twitching were also bothersome but the fantastic improvement in my depression and fatigue over the initial 5 months pushed me to continue on the Med.The hairloss is extreme and will most likely and sadly lead to total baldness in my case and I am hoping to warn all who see this.feel free to contact me for info.,F,36,5  weeks,3/26/2006Email,Cymbalta

2389, 1, depression,I was prescribed lithium and cytomel in addition to Cymbalta 60 mg.  I experienced increased induced depression. My physician took me off the lithium and cytomel thinking that was the problem.  Wrong! I have lived with depression for over 40 years_ but it's the lethargy_ feeling lazy_ not motivated decreased concentration_ and oh yes weight gain that I am experiencing from Cymbalta. There's nothing like weight gain to make me depressed.  25 lbs.  I told my dr. about constipation and he just dismissed my complaint.  I getting to be an expert with soap suds enemas because I am such a zombie I can't remember when my last BM was.  When I have my own familiar worst depression_ I have never gone three days without showering_ and then it took me until 9 p.m. to psych myself to take the shower.

All except for the change in appetite_ weight loss and sleep disturbance stopped after the first 2 weeks.,The very second day I took this I felt so comfortable. My fibro pain has gone and only seems to surface quite mildly when my hormones cycle one way or another. By the third day I noticed that my mood_ despite the side effects_ had evened off to a relaxed medium! What a relief_ there are no words (except maybe rebirth) to adequately describe what Cymbalta is doing for me. I FEEL YOUNG AGAIN. I had intense endometriosis pain with every cycle_ and experienced 2 cycles on Cymbalta with no abnormal pain-- quite like when I was a teenager. My relationships have started to glow again (my husband is so happy_ and I love being a mother again) and I feel more social than ever and more realistic and accepting of deep-seeded childhood trauma. The only downsides have been decreased interest in sex and the sleep disturbances. My neurotransmitters function the way they are supposed to-- when my stomach is full_ my brain actually gets the message! Also_ my Primary RAYNAUD'S disease_ a chronic condition for 9 years_ has almost completely disappeared. I lost 2 years to fibro and depression. I now have my life back.,F,32,45  days,1/15/2006,Cymbalta

They last for about two weeks but other than that there doesn't seem to be any other withdrawal effects for me (I went cold turkey to see what would happen because of all the horror stories I had heard about going off of Cymbalta).,Fluoxetine (Prozac) was the only anti-depressant I had been able to tolerate until I took Cymbalta (it doesn't mess with my norepinephrine levels like Effexor does which Cymbalta is chemically related to).  It ups my mood and I actually have a libido again_ and unlike the fluoxetine it doesn't cause me horrible dry mouth (my teeth are in bad shape from 10 years of fluoxetine).  I have tried everything out there from tricyclics to SSRI's to MAO's to trazadone for depression with disasterous results (dysphoria_ priapism_ increased depression_ paranoia_ psychosis_ etc.)  I can't even take cyclobenzaprine (flexiril) because it is too closely related to the tricyclic anti-depressants.

I decided Cymbalta was the cause of my deteriorating health_ including severe back pain_ muscle weakness_ and muscle and tissue inflammation in groin which has led to four MRI's 5 series of back injections for pain_ and 2 CT scans.  Going off of Cymbalta is a nightmare.  Be prepared to have a rough road - I had dizziness_ severe headaches_  inner ear pain_ flu like symptoms_ stomach pain_ nightmares - of which have subsided now but not completely.  I still get the flu feeling which comes on suddenly and remains for hours_ and still have some nightmares_ and some headaches.  The ear pain is gone and the dizziness.  I hate this drug.

In the past many years ago I tried Zoloft & Prozac and had the same effect.  My shrink felt maybe by switching to Cymbalta my libido would come back.  It's too early to tell I have only been on it for one week at 30 mg's along with 37.5 & 75 Effexor.  He is weening me from Effexor to Cymbalta.  I really havent had any different side effect other than the fact I feel a bit more tired_ maybe it will ease up as time goes on.  I also take 0.05 klonopin for anxiety.  When I go for my next visit I am sure he will adjust by taking more of the Effexor away not sure if he will increase the Cymbalta.  I feel like I have gained so much weight with all theses anti-depressants_ but I guess it beats having panic attacks and not wanting to go out of the house and enjoy life.

My whole family is grateful for the second chance I've been given.,F,28,3  months,10/2/2005,Cymbalta
2435, 5, anxiety/depression/pain,My doctor warned me that for the first week I will have nausea_ but she told me to take zantac 150 _1/2 hour before I eat_than take the cymbalta. Guess what I wasn't nauseous at all.,I'm not depressed no more_ my pain went away_ and I lost my appetite which is a good thing_ because I lost the weight that I needed to lose.,F,25,3  months,9/28/2005Email,Cymbalta
2436, 3, anxiety/chronic fatigue,After two weeks on this med_ I have extreme itchy hives on my legs_arms_hands_and back. I am taking benedryl and the itching just will not stop.  The hives keep spreading after I stopped the med two days ago. I always have insomnia trouble and this med did nothing to help that. However_ the biggest plus is I was dropping weight a couple pounds a day. The weight I was losing was extra pounds due to my fatigue_ so it was a blessing to lose some weight.  However two days off the med_ I'm gaining my weight back a pound a day so far.,I have chronic pain.  The first day I took this med my chronic neck and back pain disappeared. It was amazing!! If it wasn't for the hives_ I would have stayed on this medicine. Didn't notice much help with the mood swings.,F,33,17  days,9/20/2005,Cymbalta
2437, 1, bipolar depression,I've had severe and persistent constipation; insomnia_ with very vivid dreams when I did sleep; depression and increased suicidal feelings; brain 'zaps' (I can't really think of a good way to describe them_ except I feel like I've stuck my finger in a socket),This drug turned me into a zombie.  My depression worsened as I went up in dose and finally my doctor took me off of it_ when I was at the point where I couldn't function.  Going off the drug has been the worst part...I have been soooooo sick.  Nausea_ vomiting_ headaches and stomach aches--and this for weeks after the drug has been out of my system.  The brain zaps haven't stopped either and I'm really hoping I start feeling better soon.,F,37,3  months,9/20/2005,Cymbalta
2438, 4, Depression/Anxiety ADHD,"When taking at night_ Cymbalta caused insomnia something awful.  I would have heart palpitations and awake 3-4X a night.  My doctor switched my dosage time to morning and I noticed a world of change.  My only symptom now is sweating (clammy feeling).  My mood is a serious one with some laughter.  I wonder if anyone has figured out how to find the return of the ""fun and ""carefree"" side of themselves?","Great drug!  Initially I felt as if I was ""awakened.""  This seemed to subside.  Don't know if I am used to it or it is no longer effective?",F,30,3  weeks,9/17/2005Email,Cymbalta
2439, 4, Depression,Worked pretty good.  Made me rather irritable but when i combined it with tryptophan_ my irritability went away.  Only SSRI that didn't give me sexual side effects. (20-30 mg)After about 2 months on it though_ i started developing this weird feeling in my head.  Like a pressurized feeling.  Anybody else have this side effect?,I was pretty satisfied with its effectiveness and side effect profile.  It also seems to work excellenty when combined with Tryptophan.,M,21,3  months,9/12/2005,Cymbalta
2440, 3, Anxiety and Depression,Dry Mouth_ Anxiety_ Depression_ Fatigue_ Dry Skin,It took some time for my body to adjust to the medication.  I wish that my physician would had warned me of what the effects and the initial phases of the medication would be because it would have been easier to adapt.  Now_ my body is adjusting_ and like any other anti-depressant it is working.  I think I am losing weight with this though and I feel a bit less spacy.,F,22,30  days,9/12/2005,Cymbalta
2441, 3, ptsd/depression,The main side effect I have is weight gain of 25lbs. and hair loss.,Since I am sensitive to meds I started on 20mg per day_then 30_40 and 50_ giving each a week_ so that I could see how my body would react to cymbalta. I am fortunate that I did not experience what others have-except for the wt. and hair loss and lost libido. I suppose that is enough. I am going work on losing the wt. Libido will wait.:-( It is the hair thinning with which I am concerned. Does this stop before I become bald!!!!!??????,F,57,40  days,9/7/2005Email,Cymbalta
2442, 5, Depression and Anxiety,Side effects initially were loss of appetite_ increased heart rate and some nausea.  After a week I felt great.  Long term side effects were inability to orgasm and constipation and some inabilility to sleep_ sweating more than usual,Despite the side effects_ I haven't felt so grounded and deeply satisfied with life until taking Cymbalta. I am much kinder and don't have dramatic moods and uncontrollable emotions.  I have been taking life with more control and consciousness.-  Be careful when discontinuing- or decreasing doses- I went cold turkey at first and thought I was going to have a stroke- I had severe vertigo_ mood swings sharpened and a pounding headache.,F,30,6  months,9/1/2005Email,Cymbalta

2445, 4, Depression / Anxiety,Flat affect_ drowsey_ sweating often through the day and loss of libido.,I have been depressed for many years and only recently looked for help. I have been on just about every med since trying to deal with it. I am now on 90 mg of Cybalta_ 300 mg Welbutrin_ and Zanax prn. They tell me the welbutrin helps with the lidido and it seems to. I do laugh more and have more fun. I still have no interest in socializing. It has been less than 2 months_ so I will wait a couple months to see how it works.,M,49,45  days,8/21/2005Email,Cymbalta
2446, 1, depression,I have been taking Cymbalta for approximately 5 months and have not noticed any real differences from the Prozac_ regarding my mood.  However_ the differences in side effects has been very pronounced.  Since taking the Cymbalta_ I have experienced significant insomnia_ INTENSE sweating_ especially during the daytime_ constant diarrhea_ dizziness_ and arrhythmia.  I am going to reconsider going back on Prozac.   I only discontinued it because it did not seem to be as effective as it had once been.  I had been on it for many years and thought a change in meds might be warranted.,,,56,5  months,8/21/2005,Cymbalta
2447, 1, Depression/Periphial Neuropathy,I didn't really have any side effects like headaches_ or feeling sick to your stomach etc. The only thing about this medication is I never knew I was taking anything for depression. It didn't help at all. In fact it made me feel lazy_ more depressed_ not motivated_ and gave me a horrible attitude....And worse of all_ it made me feel suicidal. I have Periphal Neuropathy in my feet where they are numb with tingling etc. It didn't even help that and they claim it helps with that. I take Neurontin for my neuropathy and it is a life saver. I would NOT take Cymbalta ever again. For me Effexor 37.5mg and Wellbutrin 300mg. each morning_ has been the best I have ever tried for depression_ anxiety_ and a lack of motivation where you just lose interest in everything. I have tried just about all the SSRI's and the SSNI's etc_ they did not help_ but the Effexor/Wellbutrin combination is a life saver for me !!!! They say such horrible things about the withdrawl on Effexor and most of the SSRI's but I think it's like anything else_ you have to weigh the pro's and the con's to some extent. A lot of things might be habit forming and have withdrawl symptoms_ such as coffee_ soda_ cigarettes etc._ so if there is withdrawl symptoms_ I'd rather stay on my medication combination and live a happy_ motivated_ highly functional life taking what helps me_ rather than TRY to get off of something that works so well.,Not a drug that worked well for me at all....Will never take it again!!!! But for those of you who take it and it works_ I'm happy that it does help you!,F,54,6  months,8/14/2005,Cymbalta

2449, 2, depression partly due to thyroid,Continuing fatigue; I wake up yawning.  I feel groggy and stupid; I can't seem to get simple things done that must be done.  Inability to reach orgasm_ very frustrating.,Started with 20 mg and felt great for about 2 days; then lousy.  Dr. indicated the mfr. recommends the increased dose regardless_ but at 40 mg for 2 months now and feeling very fatigued and (?) depressed_ can't do things that need doing.  Have tried other anti-depressants in the past and this doesn't seem any better.  Feeling very discouraged about it all; I was diagnosed with a non-functioning thyroid 6 months ago and after the medications brought my thyroid levels back to normal I still felt tired and lousy so the endocrinologist said the only choice was an antidepressant.  I wonder if I will ever feel like myself again.  Does anyone out there think that sticking with this another month will change things?  Thanks.,F,51,2  months,8/9/2005,Cymbalta

If anyone has any suggestions on how to prevent the night sweats I would greatly appreciate it - thank you.,Mentally I have been a lot more relaxed and not feeling as overwhelmed or angry (seething anger).

I am now completely off and was worried the pain would increase.  There has been pain weaning back and I am hoping to start something else_ but the weight gain is getting out of hand.  I have lost a pound and 1/2 over the past two weeks coming off.  For the time I did take it_ it did work very well for the pain and than slowly stopped.
