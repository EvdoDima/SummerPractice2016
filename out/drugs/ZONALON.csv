1, 4, ITCH,KNOCKED ME OUT.  Dizziness.,"I used this ""as needed"" a few years ago for about 3-4 weeks?  Anyway_ it was a cream applied to the skin.  This was an EXPENSIVE little tube of cream_ $100.  And I had to disgard it since it expired before I could use it up.  This cream version is MUCH more potent than the pill form_ which I have also taken before.  It makes me dizzy and extremely drowsy within MINUTES.  So I could only apply it at bedtime.  And since it was so potent_ I applied it VERY sparingly_ which prevented me from actually using the whole tube and getting my money's worth.",F,46,1  months,5/25/2008,Zonalon
