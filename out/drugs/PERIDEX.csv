0, 1, Bone graft and dental implants,Burning tongue_ burning gums and lips_ receding gums and dry mouth,This product is scary. It can wreak such a havoc in your mouth that you would not know what hit you. And this applies to Perdiex and generic Peridex prescriptions. I used it for 2 weeks and let me tell you my tongue burned_ it caused geographic tongue_ dry mouth feeling and in addition to that receded gums causing slight gingivitis.  And why that happened? It was because it wiped all good bacteria leaving a room to any bad bacteria to mess with your mouth. I'm 3 months post usage and still can feel the side effects of it. FDA lists all those as side effects on the website but I could not find on the bottle. It's a mess_ it causes you to panic and thinking you have some nasty condition going on. I went to ENT and oral surgeon to see what is going on. I also found a blog of a person that developed burning tongue after using Peridex and oral thrush. It took this person a while to get rid of the burning tongue effect. What's in this stuff and why it's taking so long for the side effects to go away.,F,41,2  weeks15ml 2X D,8/16/2016,Peridex
1, 1, bleeding gums and inflamed gums,burning tongue_burning gums_weird tasting food_receeding gums,AVOID THIS CRAP AT ALL COST!!..here is my story. i started taking this medication in december of 2015_ i took it for a good week and stopped. as soon as i started taking this crap my tongue started burning_my gums started burning_i could not taste food properly anymore....anyhow i started panicking and had to go see 3 ent's and 1 mouth specialist to see what was going on with my mouth...long story short_ if some of you are panicking about those side effects_ know that now most of them are now gone..no more tongue burning_no more gum burning...and i can now taste food properly again...it took a good 8 months for everything to be back to normal.....i hope this will be the same for you guys!!,M,43,1  weeks1oz 2X D,8/4/2016Email,Peridex
2, 1, Extraction and dental implant,Bleeding gums_ receding gums_ burning tongue_ mouth and lips_ kills good bacteria_ dry tongue and weird taste.,Horrible and nasty product. Should be taken off the market or better yet those who produce that piece of garbage should take it themselves. Also_ the dentist who prescribed_ I would rate him same as this product. Not worth it. It does a lot of damage. What it treats it also damages. Causes receding and bleeding gums_ horrible taste_ white coated tongue_ messes with saliva and mucous.

4, 2, Gingivitis,Burning sensation on tongue and in mouth lasting for days_ change in taste perception_ extremely chapped lips (to the point where the sides of my mouth were bleeding). Swelling in the neck first few days.,I would suggest trying a more gentle method_ first. I don't normally react to negatively to medication_ but this is simply toxic. It dehydrates you_ and fixes the bit of inflammation in the gums_ but causes far too many additional issues. I'll keep it around as an absolute last resort_ but not a go to.,F,19,7  days15 mL,5/11/2016,Peridex
5, 1, bone graphing and titanium implant,My tongue is swollen and mostly black on the surface.  My mouth is dry.  I didn't realize Peridex was causing this problem until I started searching the internet.  I have recently had colon cancer and thought at first it has spread to my tongue so I was all set to make an appointment with my oncologist until I read about this product causing these side effects.,I would not recommend using it. I have had dental procedures in the past which were just as extensive and was not prescribed this product or anything similar.  Just told to rinse my mouth at least 3 times a day with warm water and a teaspoon of salt and I was back to normal in a couple of weeks.,F,70,15  days15 ml 2X D,5/6/2016,Peridex

8, 1, Gingivitis,DO NOT USE THIS! THIS IS BAD NEWS! My tongue and throat feel burnt. I have a sensation of a lump in my throat that won't go away. I'm tired.  I thought I had a tumor or a swollen thyroid_ but then I looked up these reviews and much to my surprise and anger_ my symptoms are here! My glands under my neck are swollen. I will be calling my dentist and reading him the riot act. Who would have thought a mouthwash could be so toxic and that people are still prescribing this with all the bad experiences reported! I'm angry!,Shame on you_ Peridex and anyone who puts Chlorahexidrine in their products.,F,51,7  days,1/11/2016,Peridex
9, 1, gum graft,by day 7-8_ mouth had metallic taste which got worse each day Thought maybe was graft rejection (Dr. out of town!) several days later_ checked internet and found similar problems so I stopped.

10, 2, Swollen Gums due to a root canal,I would not ever recommend this for any length of time. I experienced throat swelling_ burning sensation in mouth_ loss of taste_ and the worst part_ wait....BROWN stating on some of my teeth. On a good note it significantly reduced swelling in my gums and took care of that problem but added a host of others.

11, 1, Bleeding and puffy gums when brushing,Extreme dry mouth_ bitter taste_ extreme burning of tongue_ lack of taste_ dry lips,My dentist gave me Perodex and I had no idea it was only suppose to be used for only a short time. Within the period of 3 years I used 6 bottles. I've had a dry mouth now for 2 weeks where I can barely swallow. My tongue is so dry it sticks to my finger. There have been times when I was eating that I could not tell you what kind of food was in my mouth because I had no taste. The last time I used it I felt like there was acid onnmy tongue and its still burning and the buds of the tongue are raised and prominent. I am furious at my doctor because he had no idea he kept refilling this. He even gave me refills which he denied he'd ever do until I pulled out all the slips and showed him. After he gave me the first bottle how could he forget? Or even when I asked him for another bottle_ the word another means I was give one already. I use Biotene to work up saliva but that doesn't even work anymore and I can take living like this. It's difficult to talk when your tongue sticks to the roof of the mouth. I just can't believe I was given his medicine for 3 years! My lips are dry and I can't eat anything with salt or vinegar. No ketchup either. Everything has to be soft. His answer was_ its all in the past. Well not for me! He's suppose to be one of the best in his field too! Do not use this rinse. The bad effects outweigh the good by a mile!,F,29,3  years. 2X D,7/7/2015,Peridex

13, 1, Dental surgery,An hour after second use_ my face_ tongue_ and throat area started to swell. I started to feel that I was starting to have difficulty breathing. I immediately rinsed mouth out and took a Benedryl. It improved just a little. I felt another wave of the difficulty breathing and went toward the ER. I called the periodontist but he couldn't believe it was related to the rinse. I know it was as it was the only new thing after the dental surgery 2 days ago. The ER staff immediately noticed the allergic reaction and provided necessary care.,I would not use this again nor would I recommend it to anyone else. An alternative is rinsing with salt and water and I will stick to that. Doctors need to read all the info and believe patients when they say there is a problem.,F,43,1  days15 ml 2X D,6/6/2015Email,Peridex
14, 1, pregnancy related inflammation,Awful nausea and_ pardon TMI_ very frequent bathroom trips,I only was able to take this stuff for 3 days before getting so nauseous it felt like I was back in 1st trimester. Used it last night for the last time and am still nauseous at 3 pm today. Had a deep cleaning done today and won't touch this stuff with a 10 foot pole.

15, 4, Titanium implant and bone graft,Day 7 I woke up and my tongue was COMPLETELY black like I had colored it with black food coloring. Scraped as much as I could off. My teeth have also started staining in between each other. I did have a mouth sore pop out of no where on day 5 as well as a crack in my lip on the side where I swish that Ive never had before on day 3.,I dont mind the taste at all and don't experience any numbness or tingling.,F,33,7  daysa cap full 2X D,4/3/2015,Peridex

18, 1, Extraction,Bitter taste_ numbness_ stinging_ ONGOING dry mouth_ numbness_ tongue growth_ skin sloughing on cheeks,I have a very high threshold for pain and discomfort and am usually willing to either forgo medication and soldier through or deal with side effects. I wish I had NEVER used this crap! Like another person who posted_ I don't like the side effects of oral antibiotics_ so when I had an extraction I was given this rinse instead. In retrospect_ I wish I had used salt water and waited for signs of  an infection onset before starting this. But I thought I should be proactive. BIG MISTAKE! I am now SIX WEEKS since ending this product and I have dry mouth so bad I live on Act dry mouth lozenges. My tongue has an almost thrush like appearance and I can still peel away swatches of skin from my cheeks. My mouth is so dry I have difficulty speaking and the irritation of my cheeks is absolutely maddening. I constantly feel like little pieces of skin are going down my throat and today I actually swiped and discovered that yes- little dried pieces of skin are in fact to be found in my mouth! Yum. My extraction site has healed over but every few days the skin seems to get dried out and sloughs off like a callous.This stuff SUCKS _ plain and simple. I am tired of the dryness_ tired of areas of pain and tingling along the side and tip of my tongue ( feels a bit like a canker sore rubbing against teeth but nothing is visible and it moves location in my mouth ) and tired of eating my own damn cheeks.Never ever will I used this! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE.,F,51,10  days1.5 ml 2X D,3/13/2015,Peridex
19, 1, It was unnecessary use!,Horrendous reaction within an hour that continues into a 3rd day without noticeable relief along with additional symptoms.  Severe metallic taste_ sloughing of mucous membranes_ chapped lips_ loss of all taste_ swollen tongue and lips_ dry mouth_ gastrointestinal discomfort.,"This is a dangerous Rx mouthwash that the FDA must investigate and remove.  There is no antidote for a quick rid of this poison from the body. It is a sticky bonding.  I called the FDA and the agency will not investigate until there are many serious complaints. Go to http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm I called 3M since the company acquired the manufacturing and marketing rights to the PERIDEX brand in May_ 2007.  3M's ""Omni Preventative Care"" since early 2006 has been selling this poison to dentists in the USA since 2000.  Since May_ 2007_ 3M now owns all rights related to the PERIDEX business beyond their existing distribution.The dentist and 3M could not help me with an antidote.  The dentist suggested Benadryl & a steroid pack - both of which I am unable to use.  3M connected me to a 3rd private party  ""Poison Control Center."" The Center was of no help except to advise to see a medical doctor or ER hospital or ER clinic.It is 3M's responsibility to educate their dentist clients of the potentially severe side effects of PERIDEX and the importance of screening.  I am 85 lbs.- small frame - and my weight falls into children's category. I doubt that PERIDEX would be used on a child. I had asked the hygenist to use warm salt water rinse and she said that PERIDEX would be more effective.  I was a compliant patient and regret it.The FDA wrote a warning re: PERIDEX  http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryI",F,41,1  days0.12% 1X D,2/11/2015Email,Peridex
20, 1, Tooth extraction,Loss of taste_ mucous membrane shedding_ tonsil and throat irritation_ SLOWED healing of extraction site_ Paresthesia,"Because I have strong GI reactions to oral antibiotics my oral surgeon prescribed this as a post-op antibiotic. I had no infection and this was strictly to be preventative. Yes_ the tingly feeling is intense and everything had either a metallic taste or no taste ( Taste bud issues are resolved. ).I still have a discolored tongue as well. What I experienced of greatest  concern was that it seemed to slough off the skin in my cheek area_ which was awful_ and it kept the extraction site from closing.It seemed to be "" burning ""away the layers forming within the hole and I could taste that particular funky flavor of an open wound. The paresthesia  I will open-mindedly say may be from the novacaine shot hitting a nerve.That has resolved perhaps 85%. It is listed as a potential side effect however_ so who knows.By far the worst is the irritation to the back of my throat and tonsils.I don'thave tonsillitis_strep_ tonsiliths etc. I simply have a feeling of an obstruction_ grittiness ( like popcorn shells) and a choking sensation if I press on my salivary glands in the neck region. My tonsils are not swollen. I believe that it irritated the mucous and the sensation I have is from the inflammation and irritation. The only thing that helps is eating foods or drinking liquids that coat. ( I suggest the heavy syrup of canned peaches. ) My extraction went off without a hitch. Ironic!

21, 4, Wisdom Teeth Extraction,Slight burning_ and a weird aftertaste,Most of these reviews are negative_ but if you're reading these because you're anxious about having to use Peridex_ do not worry_ it isn't bad at all! It doesn't taste too bad_ and the only side effect I experienced was a slight burning if I left it in my mouth too long. But when they say to not rinse_ they mean it. It only amplifies the medicinal taste. Good luck!,F,18,2  days15ml 2X D,12/31/2014,Peridex
22, 1, Rinse after peridontal cleanings.,I was prescribed PerioRx as a rinse for 2 weeks_ after having peridontal cleanings_ has the same ingredients as Peridex. I was supposed to use it twice a day_ could only use once a day.  After the 2 weeks I noticedthat everything does not taste the same. That was 3 months ago. I told my dentist but he did not know what it could be either.  I thought the Listerine had done this_ untill I came across these post.,,F,59,2  weeks1/2 oz.,12/5/2014,Peridex
23, 1, Deep cleaning,The tip of my tongue burns constantly throughout the day and dulls only a couple of hours between uses. Also_ I feel an increase in buildup on the teeth after using it - I just got a deep cleaning and it's taking away the effects. And let's not even start on the taste buds. My sense of taste is drastically diminished. I can not taste salt - I swished with salt water and could barely tell there was any salt in it. I tried to use it for as long as possible but the side effects aren't worth it. It did help relieve bleeding and sensitivity in the gums_ but I'd much rather taste food and be comfortable throughout the day. So_ definitely going to stop using this and just going to use Listerine or something.,For your tongue's sake_ don't use this for very long if at all.,F,22,4  days15 mg 2X D,11/25/2014,Peridex

25, 1, Gingivitis,GUMS are very IRRITATING right now. UGH. Especially the bottom. I feel like biting into my own gums. I used it twice a day and sometimes once a day because I forget. It's been about a month use. My gums are red and irritating for a week now. Of course it bled because it's irritated. I want to stop using it but feel like I have to take it. Please help. Maybe it's too strong for my gums and should take it 2-3 times a week instead of daily? It wasn't like this before I started taking this. Will this irritateness go away? Sometimes the top of my tongue is white color but that comes & go. It has small red bumps towards the front and especially at the tip of my tongue. It burns when I use the the mouthwash. The other day_ lemon juice BURNED my tongue. Ow. Can't talk straight and I felt like Sylvester the Cat & Daffy Duck when I'm talking.

I had to undergo several oral surgeries and have successfully used this wash after each surgery with no side effect.  The product kept infection at bay.  I suggest that anyone who uses the product follow the instructions and if you have any of the side effects that are listed within these reviews you discontinue use and gargle with warm salt water.  If it burns after one uses the product I suggest the same.  Rinse immediately with warm salt water.  ,F,56,  2X D,9/24/2014,Peridex
