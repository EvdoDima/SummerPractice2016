0, 1, High blood pressure,I have been on benicar for 6 years and my health has deteriorated tenfold. I now have heart problems_ stomach problems_ and neuro problems. I have had stomach surgery with no relief. I finally figured out it was the Benicar. The side effects sneak up on you.,I am now having an extremely hard time weaning off Benicar. Any tips.,F,51,5  years40 1X D,8/7/2016Email,Benicar

2, 1, High blood pressure,I didn't know it was benicar that was causing my severe sun allergy for 13 years the doctors didn't help at all.  I would burn through my windows at home through my clothes.  My face would ooze from burns and the doctor told me it was my fault for not taking precautions.  I worn sunscreen_ spf sun clothing_ hats_ a mask.  I just quit all my meds starting taking herbs and supplements and this year is my first year not to burn.  My BP is fine--am taking hawthorn berries and clonidine.,,F,69,10  years5 mg 1X D,6/13/2016Email,Benicar
3, 1, Hypertension,Almost all of the negative side effects experienced by patients on this site. The longer that you take it_ you will experience more side effects and they will get worse,This is a update from from a previous post. I have been power walking 5 miles/day and calesthenics 30 min/day for 3 months and my bp went from 140/90 on meds to 116/74 off them and excercising. The combined workout takes 1hr 45 min/ day. My life is so worth that time spent and I am so healthy and VERY HAPPY.  9 years on Benicar stole a lot from my life. Please don't be scared to wean yourself off this drug if you really want to change your life. Yes there will be AWFUL withdrawls that taper off after a month or so and disappear after about 2 months with excercise. If your bp was similar to mine and your sick of letting these type of drugs hurt you then don't doubt your instincts and start weaning now. Every day you will improve with daily exercise. When you start weaning take something natural right away for constipation which can be severe and last for a couple of weeks but it will pass. Good luck .,M,46,9  years20 mg,6/11/2016,Benicar

10, 1, HTN,I had to try this drug after my health plan would not cover Diovan until I did.  I have taken brand Diovan for 8 yrs with great success.  Started on 5mg benicar and it did not control my bp after a week but caused indigestion_ sweating_ burning in chest_ ears and neck_ kidney pain and eye twitching.  Increased to 10mg to try to lower bp then started with sneezing_ ear congestion and just feeling physically exhausted.  Thankfully I have qualified with my health plan by flunking this drug to go back on my Diovan medication and can't wait to feel normal again. With all of the dissatisfied comments_ I don't know why this drug is even requied to be tried.  It's terrible ghathat our doctors can't prescribe for patiets.

19, 1, HBP,Where do I begin??  Started this drug combined with amlodipine. Its called Azor. No major side affects. Then the drug went Tier 4 and I was asked to pay 80 a month. So I started taking Benicar alone. I cannot eat after I take it. If I take it at bedtime then after whatever I eat in the morning is folliwed very shortly by stomach pain and cramps and I'm running for the bathroom. If I take it in mid morning my stool rushes down my colon to my rectum and I never know where I'll be. Sometimes I don't even know the fecal matter is there. Gas is horrible and constant. I have pains in my left side and in my right leg. Decreased urination.,I may have taken this med longer than 2 years. I am discontinuing it and getting a med that lowers my BP but doesn't cause such stomach distress and doesn't make me feel like I'm dying.,F,69,2  years40 mg,10/19/2015Email,Benicar

Went to the doctor many of times and he never found anything wrong with me. Found this site and realized all my problems could be this medicine. I have stopped taking it for about a week. Many of my problems have gone away except for the ringing in the ears and the cough. I hope in due time those will go away also. I am going to find another alternative to keep my pressure in check.

25, 1, hypertension,Had been experiencing minor side effects like leg cramps_ diarrhea_ etc. since the medicine was started but_ at that time_ could not relate it to Benicar. About four months before_ sensation of numbness_ tingling_ burning on the scalp_ face_ ear_ arm and leg_ all on the left side started. Throbbing/pulsation in the left ear also started. Edges of lips and side of forehead turned dark. Reported to doctor but he did not agree that Benicar was causing them. Consulted neurologist_ MRI was done but it was normal. He doubled the dose of Benicar to 40 mg. Symptoms worsened after that and had to face much turmoil because of excessive heat and burning on scalp and forehead. Took off Benicar about one month before but heat; burning on scalp_ forehead and throbbing in the ear is still continuing constantly. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? Can any one tell how much time does it take for Benicar to get out of the system and relieve these symptoms?,,F,62,29  months20/40 1X D,7/25/2015,Benicar

27, 3, HBP,I've been taking this medication for many years.  In the beginning_ I felt fine and the medication did it's job and lowered my BP.  Slowly and I mean SLOWLY the side effects started.  So slow that I didn't recognize what was happening or why.   I would say that being light headed and noticing that my allergies went hay wire were a couple of the first symptoms I recall.  Within the last few years I have noticed that I am gaining weight_ ZERO energy_ severe anxiety_ depression (I will start to cry for no reason)_ and I just feel sick and horrible.  Within the last year I have noticed that I can no longer catch my breath and struggle to breath at times.  For some reason I have left sided weakness that comes and goes.  My joints ache_ especially my arms and legs.,There are days that I feel that all of this nightmare isn't the Benicar and then days I am convinced that it has to be.  The only other medication I take is Zantac 150 for GERD.  All I know is that I am 52 years old and I feel like I'm 72.  This just shouldn't be!  I've been on this stuff so long that I'm unsure how long it will take to get out of my system if I stop.  What I can say is that all of my suspicions are pointing directly to the Benicar.  If you decide to start taking this medication_ please understand that it may take YEARS for the side effects to catch up to you-pray they don't!

42, 5, hypertension,"Benicar was prescribed for me after the birth of my youngest child. I must say I probably experienced most side effects others have listed. I also think I dealt with them by way of denial and the reality of daily life having two babies_ no time for illness_ a husband in law school and myself working full time at the hospital. At the time_ I felt Benicar was indeed beneficial because my numbers stayed within a normal range; this after having to test through several other HPT meds during a 2 week stay in the hospital only a week after child birth. Now_ just in the last 3 months or so_ I've been feeling awful pains from the top of the buttocks down the backs of both legs. The pain continued to grow until I was popping up to 6 Tylenol a day or more. As of 3 weeks ago_ it became so excruciating I knew I had to do something without going back to these ""Dr""s that pick you apart rather than heal you as a whole and keep you in balance. So_ after all these years_ I decided to heal myself and it started with going against Codex Alimentarius by not eating flesh and anything that has a face and runs away from you! Vegetables_ plants_ and herbs have all the healing you need. Take elementals as supplements and drink a better water; there are different ones_ you know. Stop eating white powder food and strangely concocted oils. Monsanto has corrupted soy now so really vegan and strictly vegetarian is in.

67, 1, High Blood Pressure,Doctor finally took me off the Benicar since I had been complaining about Shoulder_ Back_ Knee and ankle pain as well as weekness in my leg muscles and tingling_ and a complete feeling of being tired and fatigued all the time.  This had been going on for some time and could not figure out what was causing all the symptons_ almost got to the point I could not get out of the house or even walk through a store without being in severe pain and short of breath. Finally stopped taking it for three days and most of my symptoms started to deminish.  Doctor finally admitted that I was suffering from what he called Serum Ilness or alergic reaction to the medication.  Tried taking Micardis 40mg which I had been on previously but same symptons returned after one dose of it.  Will have to find another med. other than a ARB II receptor blocker!,Very sensitive to many drugs_ also taking Norvasc and Coreg which do not seem to cause the same side affects other than being tired and loss of sex drive.  Would not recommend this drug to anyone who starts to have the reactions I did and see their doctor.  You have to be insistant when talking to your doctor and know a little information about drugs.  I am glad I found this web site it has been almost a life saver for me!  One more comment_ had to stop taking Crestor about a year ago for the same side effects and tried other statins with the same results.

I had no idea that the nausea_ diarrhea_ muscle cramps_ joint pains_ anxiety_ weight gain_ vision_ coughing_ sleeplessness_ lightheadedness are all side effects of this drug.  I would stand up from a sitting position and would pass out in some of the most embarrassing places (yes even off the toilet). My doctor took me off this drug about a week ago because I just could not stand the coughing_ congestion and the lightheadedness any more. My doctor thinks that perhaps my BP was dropping to low accounting for the lightheadedness but none of the other symptoms and that the drug would take about 3 or 4 weeks to get out of my system. Being off this drug makes me feel very tired_ not that I had a lot on energy on it_ and I feel very jittery and full of doom and gloom. I don't know what is worse_ being on this drug or being off it.

My family doctor then switch me back to plain Benicar and palpitations stopped. After 2 or 3 weeks of no palpitations with my doctor's approval I switched back to Benicar HCT because it gave me great blood pressure readings. This was the worst mistake of my life! The palpitations came back and I can't get rid of them even after switching back to the plain Benicar. I've had them many everyday for 5 months. My family doctor said to keep taking plain Benicar but I wonder if the plain Benicar is causing them as well. I've gone to a Cardiologist and had several test done and more test to come.

When I didn't take a 2nd Gabapentin_ my blood pressure shot up in the other direction to the point my head felt like it was going to explode and I was dizzy_ hence the Benicar.  Other than the fact it didn't work the first two days_ it didn't cause much of a problem.  As I got to day 5_ however_ all heck broke loose.  Dr. Oz says Hibiscus tea is helpful for high blood pressure.  If mine goes up again when I don't take another Benicar_ I'm going to pursue that avenue (one cup 3x per day) and see if I can keep from having to take this nasty drug.,F,51,5  days20 MG 1X D,1/19/2011,Benicar

In the eight days I was in the hospital they took off 43 pounds of fluid off my body.  Doctor originally told me weight gain was not a side effect of the drug.  I asked to be taken off the drug early on but Doctor said it was doing a good job of keeping my blood pressure down.  Also I coughed constantly.  I could only sleep short periods of time before I woke up but was tired all the time.  I have been off the drug for six months and feel like I am getting stronger every day.

My BP wasn't great but it wasn't horrible at 130/70s. Within about 4 months of stopping Benicar_ my BP started to rise. So_ under my doctor's care_ I resumed taking Benicar. I take it at night to avoid feeling dizzy or confused... but WOW do I feel depressed. I've only been taking Benicar for 3 weeks and I am hoping the depression goes away over time. I can get out of bed and play with my young children_ smile and laugh with them... but then I'm weepy and pissed-off when I'm alone... or with my husband.

Almost immediately started to see an increase in appetite (I'm a health-nut 6'3"" 190lbs_ and very active)_ but that was not the concern to me. NEVER had a problem in my life with dizziness until I started this medicine. Almost every time I would stand from a seated or lying position I would get immediately dizzy_ to the point of almost passing out (called postural hypotension_ search it on Google_ common with certain bp drugs). My wife caught me a couple times. If you have ever been to the dentist and been on laughing gas the spinning and flashing was similar. Anyway_ dropped from 20mg to 10mg/q.d._ no change. Also had to clear my throat constantly_ which was annoying. Stopped medicine all-together and every side effect cleared up. Started again and all came back. Hate the side effect of my old drug_ which was frequent urination_ but better than the risk of fainting and smashing your head on something_ which could kill you.

He switched me to 40 mg and I have been off and on it for the last couple of months.  I do OK for a few days but once I am on it for about 10 days I start having problems.  I stopped today and am going to visit my doctor tomorrow.  If this is the only option for me then I won't take anything!,M,41,10  months,10/14/2009,Benicar
176, 1, High BP,Feeling faint_ dizzy_ heart palpitations_ irregular heart beat_ fatigue_ insomnia_ increased hot flashes_ hair loss_ and some kind of brief brain muddles.,I began with 20mg_ then after BP plunges causing me to nearly pass out_ the Dr. decreased it to 10mg. I felt the same. On my own_ I lowered it to 5mg_ then 2.5mg. All the bad symptoms persisted_ even on the lowest dose. Yesterday my heart pounded so irratically_ I felt like I might go into cardiac arrest_ so I didn't take the pill. Today I feel like a new person. Before I tell my DR_ I will try to eat 4000 mg of potassium a day_ absolutely no salt_ and more excercise. I am not overweight. This is the only prescription drug I take.

Was on Lisinopril Dr took away all my migraines_ but I developed a severe cough.,The drug made me feel mentally unstable. Scared me - I know they all have side affects but Benicar was the worst.  I could deal with dizzness_ but the way it affected my thinking_ was too much. I left my car in the parking lot running for over 2 hours_ because I forgot to turn it off.  I'm going to see another Dr if I can't get something better. I'm cutting salt down and dropping 20 lbs - maybe then I can get off HBP meds. This is not life.,F,63,3  days,8/30/2009Email,Benicar

179, 1, hypertension,This drug stole (7) years of my life. Only fate and persistence on my part identified this drug as the culprit in a nightmare of almost constant unrelenting pain. Finger joints were so sore I could not do anything requiring grip strength. Neck and back were constantly in pain as was my ribcage/sternum. Had an episode of vasculitis that nearly cost me my hands. I frequently suffered photophobia and dizziness. I have spent in excess of $5_000 dollars in co-pays for exotic tests and scans this year alone. I've Been put on dangerous drugs like methotrexate and prednisone to deal with the vasculitis and the swelling of my hands face and ankles. Had a constant skin rash during the bout of vasculitis that mirrored radiation burns. Skin on my ankles would itch and become red and caused me to scratch the flesh until raw and bloody. In short_ pain and discomfort had become my constant companions and made me feel like I was not living the life of other normal people in the prime of,So HOW did I finally find out that this drug was the cause of my symptoms? I fainted one day about  a month ago and wound up in the hospital. I was so hypotensive I needed intravenous fluid infusion. My Dr. suggested that my hypertension may have gone into remission for some unknown reason_ and so he instructed me to stop taking the Benicar unless my BP started to creep back up. After about a week off the drug_ BP was increasing to well above normal_ so I started taking Benicar at my 40mg daily dosage again. After all_ I had tolerated it well for the first year that I started taking it_ so it never occurred to me that that my body's immune chemistry and subsequent inflammation response had been very gradually altered to the point that these symptoms started to appear. And this is where fate comes into play. I came down with a bad cold. My Dr. who noted my higher BP decided to put me on an entirely different BP medicine. Why a different drug? Because my cheap-ass insurance company took Benicar off of its covered drug list. If not for that_ I might still be suffering with all the weird side effects. It is VITAL that people realize that Benicar is a VERY powerful drug. It can have profound detrimental effects on all kinds of immune_ inflammatory_ and biological processes. It also builds up in the tissues slowly over many months.,M,50,7  years,8/4/2009Email,Benicar

This was an off-label use and winded me up in the ER with a weird headache. This is not recommended by the pharmaceutical company_ as far as I know.,The fizzy_ scary headache went away as soon as I stopped both medications_ recommended by the Marshall Protocol.  Later it was believed that I was suffering from Lyme disease and a Western Blot test showed some reactive bands. Following CALDA's recommendations saved my life_ though the first few months were tough. ER doctors know nothing about this reaction or Lyme disease and thought I was just a crazy person.

184, 2, Moderately High Blood Pressure,I did have some success with Benicar.  Initially lowered my bp from about 140/90 down to about 120/70 (after a few months).  Was initially on Benicar HCT_ but that made me drool (embarrassing).  Switched to Benicar 20mg and blood pressure remained good.  After a time_ noticed blurred vision/eye fatigue_ muscle cramps_ feet and joint pain and higher cholesterol.  When I started Benicar_ I also increased workouts (3-5 mile running or 10+ mile biking daily_ plus circuit trainig weight program 3 X per week).  At same time started better diet.  Began cutting Benicar in 1/2 and noticed no change in bp_ but noticed decrease in side affects.  2 weeks ago_ PCP refused to refill without full physical_ so I stopped.  bp is 110/74 (max) and all side effects clearing up (especially my vision).  I am also taking 200mg of CoQ 10_ fish oil_ a multi-vitamin_ HA joint formula and 81mg aspirin daily.,I took the medication for over 6 years and never missed a daily dose.  The side affects came on so gradually_ I just attributed them to going from 30's to 40's.  There may be more side affects that I am not yet aware of_ so the longer I stay off of the medication_ I may notice more.  I monitor my bp frequently (often daily)_ so I will keep up with this and go back to the PCP if my bp goes out of control again.,M,46,6  years,6/25/2009,Benicar

I stopped taking the Lisinopril as it was causing me severe gout_ something I had never had in the past. After 2 weeks on the Benicar I noticed I was feeling wierd_ and very unconfident in my decisions. After another week I realized something was definitely wrong when I failed to reassemble a tool I had taken apart and put back together many times in the past. I immediately stopped taking Benicar and felt normal within 2-3 days. Upon reviewing this episode with my doctor_ he said my symptoms were probably unrelated to the drug and I most likely was experiencing a mild form of dementia! I am taking a new drug that seems to be working O.K. for me and looking for a new physician. I find it odd the symptoms of confusion appear nowhere in the testing reviews of this drug yet abound here where people share their experiences.

So I started taking it at night but it gave me severe headaches the next day which turns into a migraine.,Benicar was recommended by my doctor since it had fewer side effects than Norvasc/HCTZ or Lisinopril.  I was on Norvasc and HCTZ for one year and I never realized the side effects until my doctor referred me to a neurologist for migraine and dizziness.  I was then prescribed more meds to control my migraine which made me felt miserable.  After researching both medication and it's side effects_ I stopped taking Norvasc and HCTZ for 3 weeks and felt so much better.  Migraines_ dizziness and sexual disfunction all went away.  My doc prescibed Lisinopril which gave me a rash and upper respiratory problems.  I stopped taking Lisinopril for 10 days and started 10 mg of Benicar for 21 days.

My cardiologist is something that's rare:  a doctor who doesn't just say try this_ try that but one who actually knows about the drugs he prescribes_ their side effects and interactions.  He advised me to discontinue its use because it accelerates bone loss (my gums had started bleeding after years of being clean).  Of course_ my periodontist didn't believe it and disputed his claim; he was kind enough to make copies of the study so that I could present it to her--you should have seen the look on her face!

225, 3, High Blood pressure,This helped my blood pressure and had what seemed like minor side effects. It didn't make me super fatigued_ like beta blockers_ didn't give me a cough like ACE inhibitors. Worked great on my mild hypertension.,However_ I have been depressed for about 4 years. This is about the time I went on this med. I recently ran out of Benicar and noticed an increase in my mood. I ran out again this week (2 months later) and noticed an increase in my mood. So I am thinking there is a link between depression and Benicar for me. I have also gained weight since I went on this drug. Not sure if I can pin point it directly to this drug (as I am the age where you start gaining weight)_ but there is a correlation. I am going to try something new.,F,53,4  years,7/24/2008,Benicar

231, 2, High blood pressure,None,"I've had high blood pressure for at least three years_ like 175/105 and higher. I finally got some good insurance and went to the doc_ started me on lisinopril_ that was terrible. So he switched me to Atenolol_ which lowered my bp but made me tired and nearly impotent. So after 2 or 3 weeks on that I've switched to Benicar after tapering off from Atenolol. Right away I started feeling better_ but of course it was because my bp and pulse went up. On Atenolol_ my resting pulse was around 55_ when normally it's around 72. On Benicar pulse is back to normal_ bp is around 145/90 most of the time_ so that's not too good. I started with 20 mg_ when that wasn't doing much I went to 40mg. My bp is 130/80 for a long time after strenuous exercise_ but other than that it's too high. I've read a lot about these drugs here and elsewhere_ and I'm thinking it's time to get scientific about prescribing them.

Institute other measures: reduce salt intake as well as implement other dietary measures.Plan on calling my Dr. tomorrow. Never have had swollen ankles til now.

I've lowered my blood pressure from 128/98 to 108/77 and it has helped me to lose weight_ which I attribute to water loss. I'm not happy about taking medication at 38_ but I'm overall very happy with Benicar.  My advice is to get past the first six months_ taking as prescribed_ and the benefits will outweigh any of the early side effects.

I am a long time critical care RN so these problems are not a figment of my imagination. When I changed to Benicar_ instead of starting out right away with 40mg_ I started with 5mg and titrated it up over about 6 weeks_ to the full dose. I also take HCTZ but I cannot take this at the same time as the Benicar_ ( my experience with the first ARB the Diovan_ was Diovan HCL the combo pill_ which aside from the large starting out dose of that combined with the HCTZ was intolerable for my body.)

When on the Lisonipril I experienced several more severe symptoms including closing of my throat but one symptom in common with Bennicar is heart palps/prostititus digestion problems that all seem related. I eat_ become extremely bloated and intestinal spasms and heart palps occur simultaneously often related to later stages of food digestion.

Benicar also did that after a while_ but with the added problem of disappearing and reappearing hives that drove me nuts. My doctor said it's impossible to have this with Benicar. I stopped taking the med and the hives haven't reappeared in more than a year.,,M,58,6  weeks,5/22/2007,Benicar

277, 1, HBP,I have been on Benicar since 2001. I have noticed the longer that I have been on it the more tried and weaker I feel. I use to be in good shape now I seem to hurt myself every time I try to work out. I have back pain_ joint pain and congestion. A few other things that I noticed is that in the last year I keep doubting myself and have become very short tempered and now somewhat depressed. And I recently noticed an increase in hunger and its getting harder to lose weight. I am thinking about changing doctors so that I can get off of this drug.,I tried Zistril which put me into ICU because it gave me the major symptoms of a heart attack_ Diovan which gave very bad joint pain below my waist and my feet would swell up_ I also develop heel spurs while on it and still have them and I tried Avapro which gave me severe abdominal pain.So you can see I have tried a few others but there must be one that is safe_ I just need to find it.,M,50,5  years,5/15/2007,Benicar
278, 3, hbp,My side effects started out  mild with mostly nasal irritation_ nasal congestion_ and extreme ear congestion.  Then progressed to constant sinus pain. Diagnosed this evening with a Maxillary (cheek bone) sinus infection.  Three shots today_ another on tomorrow_ in attention to oral antibiotics.,Benicar was my 5th attempt at a bp med that didn't have so many terrible side effects.  My doctor really listened to me and felt this was not the drug for me. My suggestion is that you  Don't give up trying to find the one with the least amount of side effects.  Have been taken the diuretic hctz for 4 days now_ monitoring bp closely_ hoping we can manage it this way. Benicar lowered my bp_ but it just wasn't the drug for me.,F,40,4  months,5/8/2007,Benicar

280, 5, HBP,No side effects unless it's the reason I haven't had any sex drive since around the time I started taking it. I noticed that there were quite a few reports of this problem with some other angiotensin II receptor blockers. Anyone else?,Until now_ I've been really happy with Benicar because I love salty foods.,M,62,3  days,4/4/2007Email,Benicar

284, 3, elevated bp,I'm trying to find out if the 5 mg benicar I've been taking is causing the excessive saliva in my mouth which_ when I  unconscientiously constantly clear my mouth by sucking the saliva out_ has given me a most painful_ burning_irritated mouth for over a year now.,Has anyone else had this same experience ?,F,60,1  years,3/12/2007Email,Benicar
285, 3, hbp,Worked very well with lowering bp. Caused extreme sensitivity to sunlight. Got sunburned so badly that multiple basil cell carcinoma spots cropped up on my neck and had to be removed. My forearms have bright pink spots on them from sun damage.,Unless you are very dark skinned_ use sunscreen and avoid the sun.,M,40,8  months,2/9/2007,Benicar
286, 1, my 89 yr old mother took it for HBP,Total numbness in both hands_ muscle weakness in arms_ extreme fatigue_ shortness of breath.  Loss of balance. General malaise. She was the picture of health until she started on this and she has deteriorated rapidly. I just now have realized that these symptoms are probably due to the Benicar. Being elderly and hypersensitive to medications probably not the best combination for a Benicar user.,,F,89,4  months,2/6/2007,Benicar
287, 2, High blood pressure,I was tired all the time and just could not get enough sleep.  My arms and legs felt like they had heavy weights holding them down.  I also had trouble concentrating.,I blamed sinus meds until I stopped taking everything but Benicar and was still tired.  I stopped taking Benicar and felt great one week later.  Six months later my doctor is now nagging me to try Norvasc.  I just read this site's information on that one.  :::sigh:::,M,46,1.5  years,2/5/2007,Benicar

289, 2, high blood pressure,Extreme fatigue; weakness in arms; pounding heart under mild exertion (climbing stairs); loss of appetite,I took benicar for about 4 weeks and was extremely fatigued and couldn't stand up very long.  My dr. insisted that the symptoms were viral and not from this med. I asked to get off of the med.  Two months later_ my bp was reading very high so I decided to start benicar again to test my dr.'s theory.  After two days_ I had the extreme fatigue again and could barely walk a few yards before I had to lay down again.  While climbing stairs_ my upper arms ached and became limp(felt like I wasn't getting any blood to my arms).  The effects persisted even three days after last dose_ slowly improving.  My dr. said that these effects must be unique to me.  Hope this helps someone else.  I can't take this med.,F,42,4  weeks,1/3/2007,Benicar
290, 4, high blood pressure,I have been on it over a year and was also taking another bp med_ and was able to get rid of the other and only taking this now.  My bp is normal and has been in a little less than a year on this med.,,F,54,2  years,12/31/2006,Benicar
291, 3, HBP,Fatigue_muscle pain on the legs. Some joint pain and weakness when climbing stairs.,"This drug controlled my hypertension and prevented frequent headaches and migraine.  The pain on the back of my neck and shoulders was also helped by this drug.  There were no other undesirable side effects.  I thought I found my ""wonder drug"" until subsequent blood tests revealed that it was causing muscle damage.  I now switched to a different class of drug (CCB's) and the muscle aches still linger but has definitely improved. I no longer awake in the morning_ feeling sore--as though I ran all night!",F,,2  months,8/19/2006,Benicar
