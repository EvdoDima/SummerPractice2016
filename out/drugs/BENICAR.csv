0, 1, High blood pressure,I have been on benicar for 6 years and my health has deteriorated tenfold. I now have heart problems_ stomach problems_ and neuro problems. I have had stomach surgery with no relief. I finally figured out it was the Benicar. The side effects sneak up on you.,I am now having an extremely hard time weaning off Benicar. Any tips.,F,51,5  years40 1X D,8/7/2016Email,Benicar

2, 1, High blood pressure,I didn't know it was benicar that was causing my severe sun allergy for 13 years the doctors didn't help at all.  I would burn through my windows at home through my clothes.  My face would ooze from burns and the doctor told me it was my fault for not taking precautions.  I worn sunscreen_ spf sun clothing_ hats_ a mask.  I just quit all my meds starting taking herbs and supplements and this year is my first year not to burn.  My BP is fine--am taking hawthorn berries and clonidine.,,F,69,10  years5 mg 1X D,6/13/2016Email,Benicar
3, 1, Hypertension,Almost all of the negative side effects experienced by patients on this site. The longer that you take it_ you will experience more side effects and they will get worse,This is a update from from a previous post. I have been power walking 5 miles/day and calesthenics 30 min/day for 3 months and my bp went from 140/90 on meds to 116/74 off them and excercising. The combined workout takes 1hr 45 min/ day. My life is so worth that time spent and I am so healthy and VERY HAPPY.  9 years on Benicar stole a lot from my life. Please don't be scared to wean yourself off this drug if you really want to change your life. Yes there will be AWFUL withdrawls that taper off after a month or so and disappear after about 2 months with excercise. If your bp was similar to mine and your sick of letting these type of drugs hurt you then don't doubt your instincts and start weaning now. Every day you will improve with daily exercise. When you start weaning take something natural right away for constipation which can be severe and last for a couple of weeks but it will pass. Good luck .,M,46,9  years20 mg,6/11/2016,Benicar

10, 1, HTN,I had to try this drug after my health plan would not cover Diovan until I did.  I have taken brand Diovan for 8 yrs with great success.  Started on 5mg benicar and it did not control my bp after a week but caused indigestion_ sweating_ burning in chest_ ears and neck_ kidney pain and eye twitching.  Increased to 10mg to try to lower bp then started with sneezing_ ear congestion and just feeling physically exhausted.  Thankfully I have qualified with my health plan by flunking this drug to go back on my Diovan medication and can't wait to feel normal again. With all of the dissatisfied comments_ I don't know why this drug is even requied to be tried.  It's terrible ghathat our doctors can't prescribe for patiets.

19, 1, HBP,Where do I begin??  Started this drug combined with amlodipine. Its called Azor. No major side affects. Then the drug went Tier 4 and I was asked to pay 80 a month. So I started taking Benicar alone. I cannot eat after I take it. If I take it at bedtime then after whatever I eat in the morning is folliwed very shortly by stomach pain and cramps and I'm running for the bathroom. If I take it in mid morning my stool rushes down my colon to my rectum and I never know where I'll be. Sometimes I don't even know the fecal matter is there. Gas is horrible and constant. I have pains in my left side and in my right leg. Decreased urination.,I may have taken this med longer than 2 years. I am discontinuing it and getting a med that lowers my BP but doesn't cause such stomach distress and doesn't make me feel like I'm dying.,F,69,2  years40 mg,10/19/2015Email,Benicar

Went to the doctor many of times and he never found anything wrong with me. Found this site and realized all my problems could be this medicine. I have stopped taking it for about a week. Many of my problems have gone away except for the ringing in the ears and the cough. I hope in due time those will go away also. I am going to find another alternative to keep my pressure in check.

25, 1, hypertension,Had been experiencing minor side effects like leg cramps_ diarrhea_ etc. since the medicine was started but_ at that time_ could not relate it to Benicar. About four months before_ sensation of numbness_ tingling_ burning on the scalp_ face_ ear_ arm and leg_ all on the left side started. Throbbing/pulsation in the left ear also started. Edges of lips and side of forehead turned dark. Reported to doctor but he did not agree that Benicar was causing them. Consulted neurologist_ MRI was done but it was normal. He doubled the dose of Benicar to 40 mg. Symptoms worsened after that and had to face much turmoil because of excessive heat and burning on scalp and forehead. Took off Benicar about one month before but heat; burning on scalp_ forehead and throbbing in the ear is still continuing constantly. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? Can any one tell how much time does it take for Benicar to get out of the system and relieve these symptoms?,,F,62,29  months20/40 1X D,7/25/2015,Benicar

27, 3, HBP,I've been taking this medication for many years.  In the beginning_ I felt fine and the medication did it's job and lowered my BP.  Slowly and I mean SLOWLY the side effects started.  So slow that I didn't recognize what was happening or why.   I would say that being light headed and noticing that my allergies went hay wire were a couple of the first symptoms I recall.  Within the last few years I have noticed that I am gaining weight_ ZERO energy_ severe anxiety_ depression (I will start to cry for no reason)_ and I just feel sick and horrible.  Within the last year I have noticed that I can no longer catch my breath and struggle to breath at times.  For some reason I have left sided weakness that comes and goes.  My joints ache_ especially my arms and legs.,There are days that I feel that all of this nightmare isn't the Benicar and then days I am convinced that it has to be.  The only other medication I take is Zantac 150 for GERD.  All I know is that I am 52 years old and I feel like I'm 72.  This just shouldn't be!  I've been on this stuff so long that I'm unsure how long it will take to get out of my system if I stop.  What I can say is that all of my suspicions are pointing directly to the Benicar.  If you decide to start taking this medication_ please understand that it may take YEARS for the side effects to catch up to you-pray they don't!

42, 5, hypertension,"Benicar was prescribed for me after the birth of my youngest child. I must say I probably experienced most side effects others have listed. I also think I dealt with them by way of denial and the reality of daily life having two babies_ no time for illness_ a husband in law school and myself working full time at the hospital. At the time_ I felt Benicar was indeed beneficial because my numbers stayed within a normal range; this after having to test through several other HPT meds during a 2 week stay in the hospital only a week after child birth. Now_ just in the last 3 months or so_ I've been feeling awful pains from the top of the buttocks down the backs of both legs. The pain continued to grow until I was popping up to 6 Tylenol a day or more. As of 3 weeks ago_ it became so excruciating I knew I had to do something without going back to these ""Dr""s that pick you apart rather than heal you as a whole and keep you in balance. So_ after all these years_ I decided to heal myself and it started with going against Codex Alimentarius by not eating flesh and anything that has a face and runs away from you! Vegetables_ plants_ and herbs have all the healing you need. Take elementals as supplements and drink a better water; there are different ones_ you know. Stop eating white powder food and strangely concocted oils. Monsanto has corrupted soy now so really vegan and strictly vegetarian is in.
