0, 1, A-Fib5mg,Discovered A-Fib  during a sleep apnea test. Didn't want to go  on it but heart doctor scared me enough about a stroke I gave in..I felt funny after the first week _thinking was off but doctor insisted I needed this drug. Got to where I was breathless just walking across the room_ my thinking was foggy_ gained weigh_ craved carbs_ tired all the time and then started bleeding some(female) and then in urine. Finally doctor told me to stop cold turkey and get bleeding checked out. After 1 week it was like my mind woke up and I can think clearly again and my breathing is almost back to where it was before. I don't plan on going back on Eliquis I will try natural ways to thin my blood.,,F,62,14  months 2X D,7/19/2016Email,Eliquis
1, 1, small pulmonary embolism,Extreme depression,Patient leaflet doesn't mention depression but I was so depressed I couldn't do anything It is mentioned on drugs.com as a common (10%) side effect. No_ I didn't look it up first_ I just started taking the pills assuming nothing bad would happen_ I only looked it up after a couple of weeks as each pill made me feel worse. It wouldn't be possible to live a life on this stuff but fortunately my GP is willing to transfer me to warfarin_ a procedure that takes abut a week.This is certainly the worst I have felt in a long time. If I don't take the drug in the morning_ by about noon I start to improve. I thought the anti-coagulant they used in the hospital (dalteperin) was almost perfect. They should license it for home use.,M,67,3  weeks5mg 2X D,6/23/2016,Eliquis

4, 1, DVT/ PE,I was prescribed this for DVT/PE.  Tiredness_ periods shortness of breath. Can't walk for long stretches without having to stop & take a breath. Never was like this before.,Regardless what the doctor says I'm going to take myself off this medication. It's not a medicine it's a POISON.  I saw too many comments online about how bad these medication are & folks who had loved ones who died.  Going natural,M,46,2  weeks5 mg 2X D,4/12/2016Email,Eliquis

9, 1, blood thinning purpose,This pill almost killed grandfather. Ever since the doctor changed his blood thinning pill to Eliquis last year November_ he's been losing his appetite on and off. There would several days he can't eat and then his appetite will recover. Until recently his condition worsen and it lasted for month_ he would just eat few mouthful of rice or just mash potatoes. He could not even walk to the toilet by himself. At first we brought him to a gastrologist for endoscopy and this doctor found no issue in his stomach but said it was because he always consume Chinese medicine and causing his gall bladder to release some kind of weird acid causing him to lose appetite (what the hell?). Few weeks later we brought him to another hospital's gastrologist for a CT scan that this doctor suspected Eliquis might be the reason causing my grandfather to lose his appetite. Coincidently the doctor had a friend whose mother was taking Eliquis and she too lose her appetite. Sure enough after the doctor stop my grandfather's Eliquis medication_ my grandfather started to regain his appetite in a few days. He can eat half of his meal and walk around. Although he's not completely healed and had some memory confusion which might caused by lacked of food_ we believe he'll recover. We were really lucky this doctor discover that Eliquis was the real cause.,Try avoiding this pill_ it's a high price to pay for the side effects.,M,77,6  months5mg,8/25/2015,Eliquis

Also last week they found protien in my urine.   Going in next week to speak with the doctor.,Can't say any of these are due to eliquis.  It's just weird.,M,57,6  months5 mg 2 x d,7/11/2015Email,Eliquis
11, 1, ,My mother had been on Warfarin for 25 years without any ill effects. The GP changed her to Xarelto (rivaroxaban) in June 2014 and her health declined rapidly. She suffered loss of appetite_ subsequent weight loss and tiredness. Family and friends commented on her decline. She was hospitalised in September 2014 for an infection which was treated with antibiotics. After she was discharged I asked the GP to take her off Xarelto and put her back on Warfarin. Instead he changed her to Eliquis (apixaban). She continued to decline and got a serious bowel infection. She was treated for this in hospital. I asked the hospital doctors to put her back on Warfarin but they would not. She came out of hospital for a week and then the infection recurred. Despite the best of treatment and care she continues to decline. None of them think that Xarelto or Eliquis could be at fault and say the infection is causing her decline. The infection is serious but I think that my mother would have had a better chance if she had been taken off Eliquis and put back on Warfarin in October or even November when she was back in hospital. Now the hospital tells us that my mother is not responding to treatment.  I fear that I will lose my lovely mother thanks to Xarelto_ Eliquis and the medical profession's pig-headed refusal to consider that these new generation anticoagulants are contributing to her decline. They will not put her back on Warfarin and it may be too late now. Eliquis is a slow agonising death.,The medical profession  should be willing to change patients back to Warfarin if they decline noticeably after starting Eliquis (apixaban) or any other new generation anticoagulant.,F,80,5  days2.5mg,3/1/2015Email,Eliquis
12, 1, prevent stroke,My 79 yo Mother was prescribed this drug and it has been down hill ever since. She is weak and can barely walk. She reports she has no energy anymore.  I intend to see her cardiologist to get her off of this stuff. She has copd and has had for a while and was managing just fine.,,F,79,45  days30 1X D,1/21/2015,Eliquis
13, 1, DVT prophylaxis,Eliquis is the worst drug I've ever taken in my life. After only six days I developed the following side effects:1. SEVERE exhaustion. Couldn't even walk to the mailbox.2. SEVERE breathlessness.3. Hypotension (low blood pressure)4. Blurred vision.5. SEVERE cognitive failure. Felt like my head was stuffed with cotton.6. Periods of rapid heart beat.7. Insomnia.8. BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia)9. Ravenous appetite; absolutely craved carbs. Would have to get up in the middle of the night and eat.Side-effects diminished and most eventually disappeared completely several days after halting Eliquis.,It might work well for others_ but wanted to post my experiences because the PDF prescribing information lists very few of these side-effects_ and the ones it does list it claims are rare.,M,63,6  days10mg 2X D,10/19/2014Email,Eliquis
14, 1, prevention of stroke,blood in urine_ dark stools_ bruising_ itching_ constipation_ extreme tiredness and weakness.,THIS IS NOT A DRUG. IT IS A POISON. DO NOT TAKE IT. It almost killed my wife. I am a retired pharmacist. My wife is switching to Vitamin E_ Evening Primrose_ and Ginkgo Biloba for natural anticoagulant therapy. NOT RECOMMENDED!,M,69,3  months2.5mg 2X D,8/20/2014Email,Eliquis
