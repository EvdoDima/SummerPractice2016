I refused the 5th injection due to the severe joint pain and inflammation in my ankles and knees. I could barely walk and had to stop all my exercise which was helping with the endo. I am now on strong anti inflammatories which are the only things that help the pain and hopefully it will start to improve at some point. Taking painkillers for endo was way better than this_ at least I could still walk and exercise. Side effects caused me to take time off work which endo didn't.

16, 5, Prostate cancer,Not much to be honest. A few palpitations now and then and some slight therno-regulation problems when exercising hard. weight has been remarkably steady for four months now with judicious dieting and exercise. Maybe I have it all to come after such a short time but it must have had an effect as PSA dropped from 11 (it was never that high) to less than one within four weeks.   Stage T3B N0 M0 and Gleason 8.  Just happy to be alive and functioning well. Back at work and mentally good. (i believe the effect of the Zoladex had a positive effect on my mental health.)  Think of the alternative with a locally invasive aggressive tumour that is inoperable. Live every day as if it is your last as I have done for the last 40 years,I combined my Androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) with daily hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) breathing pure oxygen at 2.4 ATA for over one hour in a hyperbaric chamber. (Most tumours will thrive in hypoxic (low or lack of oxygen) conditions. I am CONVINCED that this combination has minimised any side effects that are reported in the accompanying medical reviews.

Surgery was performed 1st June 2015 and went very well. I'n in my 5th week of recovery and now waiting to see when my period will return since i would like to have a baby.

I have refused further injections_ it is just over a month and waiting for this awful medication to get out of my system.

Zoladex affects the pituitary gland and it is beyond the scope of this narrative to explain the downstream effects of that... read up on your pituitary gland.  I was told early on that exercise and a strict low cal diet_ multivitamins and supplements recommended by a physician would greatly improve not only the response of the cancer_ but the impact of the side effects.  That has been singularly my salvation_ having dealt with Leuprolide for 2 years before this Zoladex.  I really thought the Leupron was killing me faster than the cancer_ and I refuse to go back on bucalutamide.  The cancer is a cakewalk compared to the side effects of the Casodex.My point is_ this is a trade-off.  These drugs buy you a little time_ 5 maybe 6 years_ but at a cost to your quality of those years.  Our pharmacological choices are narrow for now_ but get up and out_ get away from the table_ and change your attitude.  You can do those things and suffer tolerably well_ or you can sit at the window and complain about the side effects and how you think it may not be worth the trouble. Either way_ you won't be doing it for long_  so make the best of a bad situation.,M,62,1  years 1X AN,12/13/2013Email,Zoladex

First attempt to remove it was unsuccessful due to too much bleeding during operation_ however they removed my appendix as it was infected and stapled up the fibroid as they cut into it. They said I would have lost my right side of reproductive organs and needed a full blood transfusion if they were to remove it on that attempt. Recovery time was 6 weeks before I could do anything again_ during that time I had 3x zoladex injections each month to shrink the fibroid.  the dr then successfully removed the fibroid and the injections had worked to shrink it down. I just wish I had the injections before my first operation so I didn't have to go through 2 operations.

46, 2, Severe endometriosis,Had 3rd laparoscopy in Dec 2012 after collapsing with endo pain (I sneezed and ripped a lump of it embedded in a muscle near my left hip). I had 5 sections of endo removed including on bladder which caused bladder damaged which has thankfully repaired. I started on the zoladex implant 8 weeks after surgery which I believe was far too long after and should have been given earlier. For the 1st 2 months the pain was reduced dramatically and I felt little need for any painkillers (co-codamol) but in this last 4-5 was the pain in my left is unbearable_ causing tears & major discomfort. I'm thinking of stopping the zoladex as the endo causing the pain is outside of my uterus/womb and I'm thinking is not fed by hormones therefore no making any difference. On top of the pain_ the hot flushes & night sweats are awful and I'm constantly tired. I'm just hoping that the medical profession can find some better way of controlling this disease without the need for more surgery which I'm sure I'm going to have to have,,F,36,4  months30mg,5/26/2013Email,Zoladex
47, 5, endometriosis,To begin with (first 30-40 days) absolute awful headaches and nausea to the point I couldn't do daily task and had to spend 1-2 days in bed around 1wk after the first two implants. 50+ hot flushes per day some days althoiugh annoying were bearable. But huge reduction in pain_ I'm so thankful for that_ my need for pain killers reduced by around 80%. Just about to have the 4th of 6 agreed implants and I'm finding affect on pain is reducing abit and need more pain killers again but nowhere near as many as before zoladex. Was on tramadol/morphine before zoladex now just the odd cocodomol for the pain. Find I'm in pain towards afternoon/evening -especially after a long day at work/looking after my daughter. However side effects have eased quite a bit less than 20 hot flushes per day but I am getting hot all the time and cold sweats in the night. Main issue is inability to sleep_waking throughout the night and being unable to get back to sleep despite being very tired. Also finding I'm getting a bit muddled when talking trying to recall the right words or names I'm looking to say. I have actually lost weight on zoladex_ only 4-5lbs i find not got much of an appetite and have not yet returned to regular exercise. Also found after I drank alcohol for the first time on this it seemed to completely 'switch off' the effect of the zoladex and the horrendous endo pain was back for around 3days and the side effects disappeared completely so I won't be having alcohol til its well clear of m,,F,30,6  months3.6mg,5/21/2013,Zoladex

49, 4, Treatment of Fibroids pre Surgery,,I have been on Zoladex injections for 3 months for the treatment of Fibroids pre surgery. I was supposed to have one more but i have been told by the Doctor that it isnt required as the Operation date is now set! After reading some peoples experiences i just wanted to add my own as i found other peoples reviews helpful. My side-effects arent that bad so far_ most of them are a mild inconvenience. I found that the weight gain can be controlled if you exercise regulary and dont over induge_ especially if you are feeling low or emotional. Exercise aslo made me feel alot better and helped me when i couldnt sleep. Im a person that loves my glass of wine and my daily coffee_ so i didnt cut out alcohol nor coffee_ but my side effects arent that bad still indulging on these guilty pleasures. Im not sure if the medicine has worked yet as im due for surgery in 3 weeks time. I do feel that the pressure on my bladder from the fibroid has reduced as i dont feel the need to go to the loo that often now. And no more heavy_ painfull cramping periods_ so in that respect it is working!.

Be careful before stopping Zoladex. It works. Get your disease stabilised before trying alternatives and always involve your clinicians_ even if they don't agree with your choices they can offer blood tests & imaging to check disease remission or progression as you try something else.Btw_ one month off Zoladex side effects remain even though it can take as little as 14 days to flush from system_ my guess is that it can take much longer!,,F,40,2  years3.6mg,1/4/2013Email,Zoladex

84, 3, elevated PSA,Following radiation and protstatectomy put on Zoladex.  Hot flashes (20 per day)_total loss of libido and personality changes (not for the better) and joint pain ensued.  Vowed I would rather die than do it again_ but when presented with that alternative last week when PSA rose to 5.8 have reluctantly decided to resume Zoladex injections.,Like so many others have commented_ while the PSA will go down and the metastased cancer areas will no doubt stop growing_ perhaps even shrink_ the side effects for some are very disturbing.  Having been off Zoladex for 5 years and vowing never to go on it again_ there are no other options if you  wish to keep living.  Perhaps the antidepressents I have been  prescribed will help the dreaded side effects.  As a male I certainly sympathize will all the ladies suffering from menopause and the hot flash syndrome.  20 of those attacks a day and living in perspiration at night along with the mood swings are no treat.  An alternative to this drug without so many side effects would be most welcome.  For any man reading this post_ if you need the drug and suffer afterward you are not alone_ hang in and hopefully after a few injections (I had 3) you can go off for a few years before facing the ordeal again. I must mention that I have an older (80 yr) male friend who has taken Zoladex with relatively few side effects so there is hope your personal experience will be better.,M,69,9  months10.8 1X O,2/12/2012Email,Zoladex

90, 2, Possible endometriosis,Insomnia_ nausea_ memory loss_ hot flushes,I was asked to try Zoladx injections by the gynaecologist as he suspects I have endo. I have all the symptoms however only have small adhesions on the ligaments at the bottom of the uterus. There is no other sign of the endo. I tried tri-cycling the contraceptive pill which worked for a few months as I didn't experience pain mid-cycle but then the usual pains and swelling returned and the last period was that bad that I was about to ask for a hysterectomy! I had 1 x Zoladex injection and although there was no endo pain the side effects were horrendous. I am seeing the gynaecologist privately and he had written to my GP to ask that they perform the remaining injections. GP told me that they would use Prostap instead of Zoladex and the 2nd injection was therefore Prostap. Since then I have experienced no pain whatsoever_ the insomnia and nausea have disappeared and I only occasionally have a hot flush. I saw the gynaecologist a couple of weeks after the 3rd injection (so 2nd Prostap) and he is really pleased that I am not experiencing pain and has suggested I continue for up to 18 months. I will now start to take some form of add back therapy to stop me fully going into the menopause. I am also going to take calcium vitamins.

93, 3, Stage 2/3 Endometriosis,Hot flashes_ more emotional/irritable,Ever since I was 12_ I have been having horrible periods.  After being on Depo Provera for a year_ I started bleeding for two months straight and I became severely anemic.  I was put on birth control pills along with Depo then taken off Depo and put on a pill with a higher dosage.  Long story short_ I finally saw an OB-GYN and the next day I got surgery to diagnose Endometriosis.  I am 4 shots into the 6 shot Zoladex treatment.  The only time I bled was when I first started on Zoladex due to estrogen withdrawal.  I haven't noticed a change in my endo symptoms because I'm not bleeding (I didn't bleed on high dose BC pills either).  After the 6 months are over_ I am going to go back on Depo.  If severe cramps and heavy bleeding return_ I will have another surgery to burn off the lesions.  I have hot flashes all day long and very bad ones at night as well.  I am from the heat and have sweat more in the last 3 months than I have my whole life.

I've upped my excercise to try counter this effect.I'm hoping if I'_ allowed to take this for a few more months then they'll give me something for the hot flushes - that would be ideal BUT if not it doesn't matter_ I've got most of my life back again and I'm enjoying it whilst it lasts.For anyone with Endo/Possible Endo then I recommend giving this a shot_ don't rule it out.",F,23,60  days3.6 1X M,5/12/2011Email,Zoladex

I am now experiencing severe hot flashes. It feels like I'm in a waffle maker_ hot on all sides. This wakes me up at night. As quickly as I'm hot_ I'm cold. I am nervous that I'm becoming forgetful and lack the required concentration to do my job. I'm keeping more reminder notices and to do lists on my computer. I also notice that I am having more anger issues. Even though I rationalize that there are real reasons for my anger at the moment_ this is different_ I am becoming destructive. THe other day_ I threw a bunch of things across the room. This scared me later. I use to be anxious about things but now I'm more carefree and numb.I am trying to maintain a healthy diet to keep some of these side effects at bay. I exercise regularly.  Since I need to keep my job_ I am doing all I can to check my attitude at the door. I am also experiencing pain all over especially in my abdominal area and in my lower back. Pain was severe today so much so that need to take motrin. Pain also noticeable at last injection site. My last shot will be at the end of this month. I see my gynecolgist next week. I do see the end in sight and hope to hang in there. I will post update on whether the Zoladex was worth it.,F,46,6  weeks3.6mg 1X M,11/14/2010,Zoladex
108, 4, Endometriosis,I didn't find the side effects to be too bad. I did not have hot flashes at all and only had some mild leg tingling for the first two months or so. I was prescribed estrogen add-back therapy which made me nauseous so I only used it twice. Felt much better when I didn't have the estrogen.,I was on a six month course of Zoladex for endometriosis. My last injection was 5 weeks ago. While I was on Zoladex I was still feeling a lot of pain and didn't think it was working. I did have some pain free days but not many. Now that I am off the medication_ I wish I was still on it. This last week has been terrible. I am supposed to go in for surgery soon and have adhesions removed again. I am going to ask my doctor if I can go back on Zoladex after my surgery. Not being on it is much harder than I thought it would be.,F,35,6  months3.6 mg 1X M,11/13/2010,Zoladex

I had a horrendous period 3 weeks after the 1st injection but no problems since. I take Premarin to counteract any side effects and wish I could stay on it forever! The needle isn't as bad as expected - it's nothing compared to the pain of endometriosis but you can have a local anaesthetic.  I've had it with and without local and prefer without as it's over and done with in seconds.

Very tired_ possibly due to waking up 3-4 times through the night_ which is now more like 2-3_ due to major uncontrolable hot flushes like I cant describe. Absolutely exhusted all of the time. Severe headaches from the start_ went after third injection but have now returned albeit not quite so frequent. Feel like my body is aching_ particularly around my joints.. wrists_ knees_ shoulders and feet and sometimes even my knuckles! I am usually rather laid back but now not very rational in pressing situations. Very forgetful. Possible decrease of sex-drive. Generally feel like a space cadett.,Been put on this as an attempt at shrinking my fibroids. Main one being the size of a four month term pregnancy_ in the hope that conceiving/being pregnant will be easier once Im off the drugs.. Quick examination after third injection showed signs that largest fibroid (5x6x9cm) has halved in size. In the mean time_ I cry over the smallest things_ and sometimes I dont even know why Im crying. So tired I could fall asleep during my journey both too and from work (40mile round trip.) Hot flushes that feel like my head is about to blow off. Headaches like a band is around my head. My knees and wrists ache the most to the point were I end up holding/rubbing them to feel better. I am shocked at such a short fuse I have before I become an emotional wreck.  I forget the simplest of things (so my Fiance tells me) causing understandable frustrations from all concerned.  Dont feel very sexy_ partly due to nearly a full stone of weight I have gained since starting 4 and a half months ago..therefore have noticed decrease in the want for sex.

My oncologist decided now to stop Zoladex and to start Tamoxifen_ luckily then when I do get very sick again I can stop treatment not like now I have to wait for the Zoladex to work out of my system (another 3-5 months).

I can't drive as i am so light headed and the slightest thing I panic. My husband thinks I have become possessed as I have been so moody and angry and irrational! I can't sleep properly and it has made my lower back and sciatica ( I have degenerative disc disease) so much worse I am popping so many pain killers to try to sleep. Everyone who knows me has commented on how I have turned from such a coper and bubbly person to such a wreck.

162, 4, Breast Cancer,Hot flashes and night sweats resulting in tiredness the next day but overall worth it.  Much better than the side effects of tamoxifen_ and no painful periods for first time in my life!,Strange as it may seem_ I actually found that exercise helped the tiredness - seemed to counteract it somehow_ and thus kept weight under control_ as well as helping with the flushes as heat was escaping naturally.  Am thinking of opting for another course as a possible oestrogen reducer as Tamoxifen is a definite no no for me - terrible abdominal side effects that are quite worrying.,F,47,2  years,7/15/2009,Zoladex
163, 1, breast cancer,severe hot flushes day and night - sometimes up to 2 an hour during the night and about 10 during the day_ depression_ terrible headaches_ insomnia_ totally physically exhausted_ aching all over_ weight gain but loss of appetite_,My quality of life since starting on Zoladex has deterioriated significantly - I feel physically drained and haven't slept a night since I started it. I put on nearly a stone in weight in the first couple of weeks even though I didn't feel like eating and was living on one meal a day. The hot flushes are awful - sometimes more than 24 in a day and seem to be worse at night. My husband had to move to the spare room as I wasn't sleeping at all and so our physical relationship is under pressure too although my sex drive is not so bad as when I was on Tamoxifen for a year. Overall I'd much rather take my chances without this drug than the side effects when I'm on it.  I have had other drugs prescribed to counteract the side effects but they have their own side effects which left me in a trance most of the time even though they helped the hot flushes.,F,42,3  months,7/4/2009,Zoladex

The injection itself looks scary_ but not very painful_ am happy to have it without a local. I will be relieved when the six months is up_ and I'm curious to find out the results of treatment. My doctor also prescribed Livial to counteract the side effects_ so I'm guessing that has helped as my problems don't sound as bad as some others on this site.

These side effects_ for the most part_ were not disclosed to me prior to treatment; I only learned they are directly attributable three years after treatment as a result of reading an article in the Globe and Mail.  I do not think the people prescribing this drug understand the life altering effects it can have on your health_ relationships and career.  Waking up several times_ every night_ soaked in sweat affects every aspect of your life (on the other hand_ having zero libido frees up some extra time for work_ too bad you won't give a shit).

I could deal with all of the side effects_ except for the panic/anxiety attacks_ sleeplessness and emotional changes.  The panic was the worst.  I hate it.  I always felt I was going mad and that I couldn't do anything to make it better.  It felt like I was in a living nightmare 24/7.  My heart felt fluttery for most of the day. The lack of sleep exacerbated the condition.I also felt rage for several hours at a time (about 4-6 hours).  Something minor would make me angry_ and for the next few hours_ I'd be so angry and taking it out on my partner  =(  I'd be fixated on the issue and try to provoke further rage in myself and my partner.  After the rage subsided_ I'd crash back into reality and feel really depressed and ashamed of what I've done.  The interesting thing is that I didn't feel the panic/rage until the second month of injections.  Z is a great drug for the endo symptoms_ but it's quite disruptive to your life.

200, 4, Prep for endometrial ablation,Hot flushes (worse with the second injection of the two I was prescribed); permanent bleeding for 5 weeks_ then stopped completely; spaced-out feeling at times; difficulty recalling simple words at times; the injection isn't so bad: one nurse advised me to cough as she stuck the needle in and I didn't really feel it at all; hypertension (to which I am susceptible),,F,44,2  months,4/23/2007,Zoladex
201, 4, BREAST CANCER FIBROIDS,HOT FLUSHES VERY NICE IN WINTER SAVED ON HEATING COST_ NOT SO NICE IN THE SUMMER! NO INTEREST IN SEX VERY DRY VAGINA. THIS IS NOTHING TO WHAT I HAD PUT UP WITH FOR 10 YEARS NO MORE PAIN OR BLEEDING.,After loosing so much blood and having to have an emergency blood tranfusion_ I think Zoladex a miracle_ had tried all other drugs to help stop the bleeding none worked did not want to have a hysterectomy as only 38. then at 40 breast cancer so kept on Zoladex on and off for 4 years now.  3 month course stops my periods for about 6 months which gives me a rest from the pain and bleeding then I have my periods for about 3 months_ sex drive returns_until they are to bad and cannot cope without a few days in bed. The another 3 month course have been looking at uterus removal only leaving ovaries and cervix in place but looks like you can only have it in america.,F,44,4  years,4/20/2007Email,Zoladex
202, 5, endometriosis,Mainly hot flushes. They don't last very long and I don't sweat or turn noticeably red. Sometimes I wake up at night and have to push blankets off. Vaginal dryness.  I also seem to be thirstier than usual and going to the loo more often. I don't know if this is related to the zoladex or the fact I am exercising a bit more to try to build up my bone density.,It has helped immensely with my endometriosis pain. The hot flushes are sometimes a bit annoying_ but they're nothing compared to the endo! The hot flushes can sometimes be great in cold weather! I wish I could stay on it forever but I'm worried about osteoperosis,F,34,5  months,4/14/2007,Zoladex
203, 4, Endometriosis,Very emotional exactly 4 days after taking each shot. Moody or angry exactly one week before my next shot was due. Hot flashes that went away after taking Phyto-Estrogen from GNC and drinking cold water. Loss of libido that has really interfered with my sex life. Swelling breasts sometimes. Just recently_ I've had cramps and low back pain which doesn't make sense to me.,The shot is painful and I always get nervous when I am about to get it. I think at one point you need to just decide do you want to be healthy and take care of yourself or be scared of one shot. The benefits outway the risks to me.,F,25,4  months,12/10/2006Email,Zoladex

205, 3, uterine fibroids,hot flashes; extreme mood swings; immediate and severe loss of short term memory; onset of hypertension,Many side effects were similar to those experienced during menopause and were relieved with a low dose of estrogen.  Hypertension has continued to jump and is uncontrolable even after treatment has been discontinued for many years.
