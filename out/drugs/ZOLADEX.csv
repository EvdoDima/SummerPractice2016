I refused the 5th injection due to the severe joint pain and inflammation in my ankles and knees. I could barely walk and had to stop all my exercise which was helping with the endo. I am now on strong anti inflammatories which are the only things that help the pain and hopefully it will start to improve at some point. Taking painkillers for endo was way better than this_ at least I could still walk and exercise. Side effects caused me to take time off work which endo didn't.

16, 5, Prostate cancer,Not much to be honest. A few palpitations now and then and some slight therno-regulation problems when exercising hard. weight has been remarkably steady for four months now with judicious dieting and exercise. Maybe I have it all to come after such a short time but it must have had an effect as PSA dropped from 11 (it was never that high) to less than one within four weeks.   Stage T3B N0 M0 and Gleason 8.  Just happy to be alive and functioning well. Back at work and mentally good. (i believe the effect of the Zoladex had a positive effect on my mental health.)  Think of the alternative with a locally invasive aggressive tumour that is inoperable. Live every day as if it is your last as I have done for the last 40 years,I combined my Androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) with daily hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) breathing pure oxygen at 2.4 ATA for over one hour in a hyperbaric chamber. (Most tumours will thrive in hypoxic (low or lack of oxygen) conditions. I am CONVINCED that this combination has minimised any side effects that are reported in the accompanying medical reviews.  I recommend that_ if you have access too such a facility_ to try it!

Surgery was performed 1st June 2015 and went very well. I'n in my 5th week of recovery and now waiting to see when my period will return since i would like to have a baby.

I have refused further injections_ it is just over a month and waiting for this awful medication to get out of my system.

Zoladex affects the pituitary gland and it is beyond the scope of this narrative to explain the downstream effects of that... read up on your pituitary gland.  I was told early on that exercise and a strict low cal diet_ multivitamins and supplements recommended by a physician would greatly improve not only the response of the cancer_ but the impact of the side effects.  That has been singularly my salvation_ having dealt with Leuprolide for 2 years before this Zoladex.  I really thought the Leupron was killing me faster than the cancer_ and I refuse to go back on bucalutamide.  The cancer is a cakewalk compared to the side effects of the Casodex.My point is_ this is a trade-off.  These drugs buy you a little time_ 5 maybe 6 years_ but at a cost to your quality of those years.  Our pharmacological choices are narrow for now_ but get up and out_ get away from the table_ and change your attitude.  You can do those things and suffer tolerably well_ or you can sit at the window and complain about the side effects and how you think it may not be worth the trouble. Either way_ you won't be doing it for long_  so make the best of a bad situation.,M,62,1  years 1X AN,12/13/2013Email,Zoladex
43, 4, Fibroid removal,hot flushes_ mood swings_ insomnia_dizziness_ no sex drive_  tired_ bloated_ emotional - crying at the drop of a hat.,had a 9 x 9 cm fibroids outside of uterus. First attempt to remove it was unsuccessful due to too much bleeding during operation_ however they removed my appendix as it was infected and stapled up the fibroid as they cut into it. They said I would have lost my right side of reproductive organs and needed a full blood transfusion if they were to remove it on that attempt. Recovery time was 6 weeks before I could do anything again_ during that time I had 3x zoladex injections each month to shrink the fibroid.  the dr then successfully removed the fibroid and the injections had worked to shrink it down. I just wish I had the injections before my first operation so I didn't have to go through 2 operations.  Recovery time was better_ still sore can't lift anything heavy for 4-6 weeks_ waiting for period to return after injections still_ headaches and tired all the time.,F,26,3  months30mg 1X M,6/16/2013Email,Zoladex

46, 2, Severe endometriosis,Had 3rd laparoscopy in Dec 2012 after collapsing with endo pain (I sneezed and ripped a lump of it embedded in a muscle near my left hip). I had 5 sections of endo removed including on bladder which caused bladder damaged which has thankfully repaired. I started on the zoladex implant 8 weeks after surgery which I believe was far too long after and should have been given earlier. For the 1st 2 months the pain was reduced dramatically and I felt little need for any painkillers (co-codamol) but in this last 4-5 was the pain in my left is unbearable_ causing tears & major discomfort. I'm thinking of stopping the zoladex as the endo causing the pain is outside of my uterus/womb and I'm thinking is not fed by hormones therefore no making any difference. On top of the pain_ the hot flushes & night sweats are awful and I'm constantly tired. I'm just hoping that the medical profession can find some better way of controlling this disease without the need for more surgery which I'm sure I'm going to have to have,,F,36,4  months30mg,5/26/2013Email,Zoladex
47, 5, endometriosis,To begin with (first 30-40 days) absolute awful headaches and nausea to the point I couldn't do daily task and had to spend 1-2 days in bed around 1wk after the first two implants. 50+ hot flushes per day some days althoiugh annoying were bearable. But huge reduction in pain_ I'm so thankful for that_ my need for pain killers reduced by around 80%. Just about to have the 4th of 6 agreed implants and I'm finding affect on pain is reducing abit and need more pain killers again but nowhere near as many as before zoladex. Was on tramadol/morphine before zoladex now just the odd cocodomol for the pain. Find I'm in pain towards afternoon/evening -especially after a long day at work/looking after my daughter. However side effects have eased quite a bit less than 20 hot flushes per day but I am getting hot all the time and cold sweats in the night. Main issue is inability to sleep_waking throughout the night and being unable to get back to sleep despite being very tired. Also finding I'm getting a bit muddled when talking trying to recall the right words or names I'm looking to say. I have actually lost weight on zoladex_ only 4-5lbs i find not got much of an appetite and have not yet returned to regular exercise. Also found after I drank alcohol for the first time on this it seemed to completely 'switch off' the effect of the zoladex and the horrendous endo pain was back for around 3days and the side effects disappeared completely so I won't be having alcohol til its well clear of m,,F,30,6  months3.6mg,5/21/2013,Zoladex

49, 4, Treatment of Fibroids pre Surgery,,I have been on Zoladex injections for 3 months for the treatment of Fibroids pre surgery. I was supposed to have one more but i have been told by the Doctor that it isnt required as the Operation date is now set! After reading some peoples experiences i just wanted to add my own as i found other peoples reviews helpful. My side-effects arent that bad so far_ most of them are a mild inconvenience. I found that the weight gain can be controlled if you exercise regulary and dont over induge_ especially if you are feeling low or emotional. Exercise aslo made me feel alot better and helped me when i couldnt sleep. Im a person that loves my glass of wine and my daily coffee_ so i didnt cut out alcohol nor coffee_ but my side effects arent that bad still indulging on these guilty pleasures. Im not sure if the medicine has worked yet as im due for surgery in 3 weeks time. I do feel that the pressure on my bladder from the fibroid has reduced as i dont feel the need to go to the loo that often now. And no more heavy_ painfull cramping periods_ so in that respect it is working!.

56, 4, Intravascular leiomyomatosis,Taken with Letrozole massive tumour shrinkage (myomas/fibroid in vascular system).Chronic insomnia_ problems with immediate short-term memory_ zero libido_ severe hot flushes_ joint pain & stiffness_ muscle spasm in hands/fingers_ lethargy & low mood.DHEA_ calcium / magnesium_ vit D_ fish oil DHA helped. Avoid wheat and beer_ alcohol generally will make symptoms worse. Now stopped taking and trying ulipristal acetate (specific to fibroids only) plus calcium-d-glucarate_ DIM_ matcha green tea & phytoestrogens: red clover_ black cohosh ie SERMS & SPRMs_ to flush out excess estrogen & progesterone. Be careful before stopping Zoladex. It works. Get your disease stabilised before trying alternatives and always involve your clinicians_ even if they don't agree with your choices they can offer blood tests & imaging to check disease remission or progression as you try something else.Btw_ one month off Zoladex side effects remain even though it can take as little as 14 days to flush from system_ my guess is that it can take much longer!,,F,40,2  years3.6mg,1/4/2013Email,Zoladex
