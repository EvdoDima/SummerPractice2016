0, 1, Flu,Psychosis for 7 days_ flashbacks for a year; dizziness for one month; horrid nightmares.,"Was 23 years old given Amantadine for the flu. After 3rd or 4th day_ called pharmacy to see if I could stop taking it because of the worst nightmares ever. The day after last dose_ I woke up and was in psychosis. Taken to ER and was given something to knock me out. For the next week_ all I did was sleep_ wake up 'crazy'_ go to the bathroom_ take another sleeping pill_ and sleep. Then I had trouble walking or driving for weeks because of dizziness. Flashbacks for a year. Psychosis is a living nightmare I was so terrified I couldn't control my thoughts by heart was beating almost 200 bpm. I'd never take it again even for a billion dollars. One doctor saw it as my allergy and said ""What happened? You go crazy?"" I said yes_ and he said that happens to  a lot of people because it's a drug for Parkinson's and shouldn't be given to people with normal brains. Take tamiflu or vitamins or anything else besides this drug for the flu. Turns out Amantadine_ DXM_ and Ketamine are all related somehow so imagine how a person can have a very bad 'trip' on ketamine in the hallucinogen family somehow_ so yes you can lose your mind. It's not worth it.",F,23,5  days100 2X D,12/30/2015,Amantadine hcl
1, 1, flu,Immediately after taking the drug_ my son would cry and scream uncontrollably for an hour.  It was horrible!  The doctor never warned me anything like this could happen.,I would take care when giving this to a little one.,M,1,2  days,2/10/2009Email,Amantadine hcl
2, 5, Parkinson's,At first I had the fatigue and brain fog_ but that went away after awhile.,My doctor prescribed 100mg 3x per day_ but she had me titrate up to this dosage. For the longest time I was doing well with with 2x_ but as time went on I upped to 3x. After 9 months_ however_ I no longer feel the increased energy levels and my tremor has increased in my right hand and jaw. There's a possibility that I will need to go on a drug holiday to induce the dopamagenic effects that this antiviral has.,M,46,9  months,11/30/2007Email,Amantadine hcl
3, 4, flu,extreme cramping and constipation_ a little hallucination on first day only_ had to skip a dose every couple days_ but it worked very well,It worked like magic to reduce horrible flu symptoms to almost nothing in a short time.,M,54,5  days,12/29/2005,Amantadine hcl
4, 1, flu,My 4 year old son took for two days and became psychotic_ violent_ horrendously out of control_ biting and hitting to harm and then clinging to me feeling frightened and confused.  This was DANGEROUS and horrid and I recommend care if your child is sensitive to things like sugar or other medication.  Very scary drug.,Why no warnings about this possible effect?  Was possibly amplified by oral steroid (begins with a D) usually given for croup.,M,4,2  days,6/1/2005,Amantadine hcl
