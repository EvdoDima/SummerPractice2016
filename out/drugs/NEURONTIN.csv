0, 1, Off label mood stabilizer_nerve pai,Rash_ insomnia for years_ I eventually became a vegetable In pain. Lost memory_ motor skills_ slurred speech_ forgetting words_ dizzy_ I cared about nothing & lived in pain as my true diagnosis was not addressed. I'm learning to live again.,I suffered double PE's. I had not been feeling well prior. Months later I returned to normal activities_ but I had a lot of chest pain_ leg pain_ my Dr. Insisted on antidepressants which I vehemently refused. As an end result_ he suggested neurontin as he believed I was having fantom symptoms_ then added it may calm me down also. I really never thought more of it. When another Dr. Weaned me off_ it was like waking up from a coma and my life ruined. Not at all worth the risk! We are vigilant in Rx/OTC med side affects_ this snuck up on us in a BIG way. I hate it_ I'm angry_ my legit problem was ignored. I believe he was simply tired of me.,F,52,4  yearsMax 3X D,8/10/2016Email,Neurontin

This drug shouldn't even be on the market.  Too many Cons_ not a single Pro.  No pain relief whatsoever.,F,30,4  days100x3,6/4/2016,Neurontin
9, 2, Fibromyalgia_ Chronic Pain,word association problems_ memory issues_ serious bouts of disassociative mental states_ unreliable pain relief_ dizziness/drowsiness,I added gabapentin to my established daily doses of Zonegran (200mg 2x per day) in the hopes of obtaining better pain control. I have had problems with some nerve and epilepsy agents in the past_ and the effect they have on my memory_ so I wasn't entirely surprised that it started to affect my mental function.

14, 2, ,Swellington and edema of lower extremities_  weight gain.,"Like the previous poster_ I was placed on Neurontin for Xanax withdrawal;  however. I'm not ""a drinker."" I don't even think he had a legit rx because he couldn't spell Ativan correctly. In my case_ the Gabapentin helped ease withdrawal symptoms a bit_ but when I was hospitalized again_ I was already taking it plus the Xanax_ so withdrawal was nast_ hallucinations_  etc. I was also placed on Remeron_  and that assisted in the 60 lb weight gain.

21, 1, neuropathic  pain,At first  I  didn't  feel  any difference with  the  pain. I still don't  think it helped at all. I began getting easily agitated  by little things_ mood swings and depression.  I would feel normal  then as stated in prior sentence. I stopped taking  it:the side effects  are too worrisome_ especially  at such a low dose.,I would caution  anyone taking  this to be vigilant  in monitoring  yourself. Any symptoms  you never had prior to taking gabapentin_ take them into serious  consideration -they may be your first sign of problems  with side  effects.  Trust yourself  in your judgement_ do not wait and second guess yourself.  Left unheeded_ the side effects  will get worse in some people.,F,37,1  months300 mg,2/20/2016Email,Neurontin
22, 2, Fibromyalgia,The doctor put me on this because the out of pocket  for my Cymbalta was outrageously expensive_ so she replaced it with this. Medication made me extremely tired_ gave me terrible brain fog. I felt horrible anxiety and irritability. I also noticed that my pain actually worsened. I feel like I'm stoned and am crying for no reason. I am only on a tiny dose. I can't even imagine what a higher dose would be like.,It's not meant for everyone.,F,51,2  days100mg 1X D,2/14/2016Email,Neurontin

Etc.,It took me far too long to realize that my entire personality changed because of this demonic drug. I thought I was simply hormonal until I got out of control. I was crying multiple times a day (full blown curled up in a ball crying hysterically) I NEVER used to cry and then all of a sudden I couldn't have a conversation without crying. I couldn't have a conversation without getting angry and yelling and then I would start crying because I didn't understand why I was behaving how I was. I felt like a spectator in my own body while some psycho b***h took main stage. I was one of the lucky few who was able to stop cold turkey with no withdrawl symptoms for 10 days as of now. Pain also has not increased since being off. Will never take this in any form at any dose in my life ever again! Strongly advise others to closely monitor themselves for any slight changes before they become too severe. Good luck.,F,23,1  years300mg,2/7/2016,Neurontin

Dizziness_ depression_ horrible mood swings_ insomnia_ horrible dry mouth.,Do a lot of research before starting this medication_ it may help others_ but definitively made me feel worse than ever. Stopped taking it two days ago_ the first day I didn't take it_ headache gone. Still a little head tingle and anxious_ but I would rather deal with that than the awful side effects.,F,30,2  weeks600mg,2/4/2016,Neurontin
26, 1, post op nerve pain in back,Blurred vision_ burning eyes_ severe muscle pain in arms and legs_ sore throat_ depression_ irritability_ withdrawn_ hair loss_ weight loss_ nausea,Horrible horrible drug.  I was prescribed this medication for post op nerve pain after a spinal fusion.  I wish that I had never even considered trying it.  Although it did help with the pain the side effects were not worth it.  Coming off of this medication is hell.  I am absolutely dumbfounded by the effects of this drug especially for only being on it for such a short amount of time.  I felt dead inside and was in more pain then before starting it.  Now 5 days completely off med and still battling withdrawl.  Severe depression_ shaking_ night sweats_ restlessness_ can't eat_ can't sleep. Feels hopeless and while still dealing with the side effects. Please never even consider putting the demon drug into your precious body.. it can destroy you.,F,40,3  weeks400mg dail,2/3/2016,Neurontin

29, 5, Initially for migraines & insomnia,None that I'm aware; no weight gain or ill effects.,Although not its intended purpose I've seen a 100% reversal of my severe social anxiety (that I've had since I was a kid and assumed was just me being me). I also noticed a decrease in migraines and my hand tremors. It has been about 2 years now that I've been on this medication_ currently at 900mg/taken once a day at night. It is honestly the best of the MANY medications I've been prescribed and usually react badly to. I only hope that it continues to work well!I was prescribed gabapentin as another effort to help my migraines_ tremors and severe insomnia; Dr's are unsure at this time (5 years post initial disability) whether my primary condition causing problems is my brain tumor & lesions_ or early onset MS although it is possibly that it's a little bit of both.,F,29,2  years900mg/day,1/9/2016Email,Neurontin

The lack of deep sleep made me feel drowsy and confused the next day_ wich is exactly what I'm trying to avoid. The euphoric feeling_ even with only one dose of 100 MG_ may make this drug interesting as an alternative for conventional antidepressants.

49, 4, Complex migraine,Nausea - easily resolved with anti nausea medication.  Insomnia - I have ADHD so even Benadryl has that effect.  I started at 100 mg and titrated every 2 or 3 weeks after side effects faded completely at each dose level.,I had serious reservations adding this drug_ but I am on low dose Depakote and this which has mitigated side effects. Migraines are down from nearly every day to 4-5 per month_ and those go away with one dose of Imitrex (injection)! As an added bonus_ I no longer have the awful breast pain and swelling I used to have every month which_ for me_ is reason enough to continue the medication!,F,37,2  months300 mg 1X D,8/13/2015,Neurontin
50, 4, Anxiety_ neuropathic pain(Lyme dis),I never noticed any negative side effects_ but I hear that it can be difficult to get off of it... Which is why I'm not going to go up any more on my dose.,It calmed me down from daily anxiety_ and lessened the neuropathic pain I was experiencing in my legs. I kind of feel like I need to be on a higher dosage to achieve the complete benefit_ but I am afraid to increase my dose because I hear it can be difficult to withdraw from... On especially bad days where I feel sick from Lyme treatment etc_ sometimes I take my entire day's dosage (1800mg) all at once instead of spread out and that seems to really help during those times.,F,26,1  years600mg 3x,8/8/2015,Neurontin
51, 1, Sleep deprivation and seizures,Vertigo. Extreme dizziness and vomiting. Finally_ after several attempts to be tapered off the drug I was down to 900 mg. unfortunately_ I fell and went back to the ER - this time with a broken leg_ ankle and severe ligament and tendon problems. This drug has caused numerous problems in my life. I am athletic - have dealt with severe pain in surgeries before this occurred.

53, 5, Migraine Prevention,Very little_ besides some tiredness and dry mouth when 1st starting.  This subsided in a few weeks.,About a dozen previous migraine preventative medications were tried and did little.  Hydrocodone/immitrex was the only treatment and those are expensive or not pleasant to take!  This is not perfect_ but reduces the frequency about 60%_ greatly reducing the need for other meds and their side effects.  Even though its not perfect it gets a five because it has negligible side effects and little tolerance and withdraw issues if ceasing.,M,35,4  months300 3X D,7/25/2015Email,Neurontin

57, 1, Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome,Severe weight gain_ hypothyroidism_ swelling_ blurred vision_ drowsiness_ depression_ memory difficulty_ dry mouth and mouth sores leading to several cavities_ muted orgasms,This is the best drug I've ever taken for pain. It makes my nerve damaged leg and back feel better than they have since getting permanently injured years ago in an accident. However_ the side effects are so bad that I need thyroid and depression medications plus lots of dental fillings. I'm too drowsy to work or drive.

89, 1, For nerve pain,Insomnia_ burning skin_ extreme head aches_ blacking out_ became suicidial  have never been in my life. Black box warning on it for that. I never believed that could really happen but I ended up being the 1 in 500 it's estimated that it happen to.,I guess this is a good med for a lot of people but not for me. When I first started taking it 100mg 3x daily and decreased 100mg a week. The first week I was so dizzy and would sleep nonstop then the insomnia started I stopped sleeping it is now 7 months later and I sleep 1-3 hours a night before taking it I never had any issue with sleep. As I was weening off my skin started burning and itching  the head aches got so severe that I would just hold my head for hours. The worst part was fixation on suicide these feelings were so strong I couldn't believe I was having them. I never suffered from any mental illness in my life. But I still would tell myself there's noway I would ever do that. What happened next would change my life for ever. I guess I was in the mixed of a black out because it was never plained and I don't remember to this day but I ended up hanging myself the cord broke I was told and was on life support for 4 days remembering none of it. Medicines affect people in different ways and it did me very wrong but it may work every well for some people.

Before Neurontin_ it was beyond painful just to hold my toothbrush.  I was so hypersensitive to all medications in the beginning_ however_ 100 mg was too much to start so I had to split the capsule in half - my doc said no one would believe that I was having startling results on what he said would have been about a 12th of the average dose.  I used Neurontin at 50mg doses for YEARS with good results.  It made a night and day difference in my quality of life.  Now_ 17 years later_ I take 300 mg 3 x day.  I tried more than that but I didn't get better results at a higher dose and it was very difficult to increase so I am extremely happy with this medication at this dosage.

I said the most annoying symptom of menopause was hot flushes which is why I was reluctant to go off HRT. He said Neurontin has shown_ in a number of studies_ to be very effective in reducing hot flushes significantly - maybe reducing 8 a day to 1. He also said it would help with sleep. I have had no hot flushes - although maybe it is too early to tell - but my sleep improved immediately which is wonderful as I haven't had a decent night's sleep for years.,F,56,1  months300 2X D,8/22/2012,Neurontin

I had a doctor try to increase my dose to 2400 a day_ but got really irritating and irritable_ with more memory issues and drowsiness. Went back to 1800 and was fine. It doesn't completely take all the pain away_ but rather dulls it. Trigeminal neuralgia causes sharp stabbing pains in the face_ and a dull ache is preferable. There were long periods of time in which I couldn't work_ and I have lost jobs due to the inability to work caused by this condition. I am a now full time student at community college_ planning to apply to a nursing program_ and any initial problems with memory and cognition have no longer been a problem. Ironically_ the pain relief provided by Neurontin_ ibuprofen_ and Tramadol for the last year has greatly improved my cognitive abilities and focus. It's as if the fog has lifted.

207, 2, femural lateral nerve damage,Moody_ angry_ nightmares_ dizziness_ faint feeling_ migraine,I hate this medicine_ but I have tried to lower dosage and the prickles and pains in my leg became worse in doing so. My leg nerve damage is a result of abdominal surgery - I woke up from surgery with a numb right thigh. Then after the pain meds from the surgery wore off_ my leg started getting stabbing pains and constant pins and needles sensation. I can't even stand to touch my thigh_ like even putting on lotion. I was told by a neurosurgeon that this type of nerve damage may or may not heal and if it will heal_ the healing time is 12 to 18 months. I had a bad migraine spell about 10 years ago but not again until the last few months on this Gabapentin. Anyone else out there have faint feelings and headaches while on this? Also_ has anyone weaned off Gabapentin_ and if so_ at what rate. I'd like to try it myself without going to the Dr. and paying for him to maybe say reduce dosage maybe 100mg a day and I don't know for how long. But the warning to not stop this medication without talking to your doctor scares me -- like will I have seizure even though I've never had one?

209, 1, broken neck,Started at 300 and steadily increased it to take 4 600mg 4 times a day. Did not help pain at any level. Started to loose vision and hearing and it was increased. Became paranoid and began acting aggressive and landed in jail over a property dispute. My lawyers questioned my use of the doctor (Robert Cocran_ Nashville pain specialist) and his use of Neurontin. I objected because my sister who is also a doctor in the same building said he was good. I have two college degrees and began not to be able to finish complete sentences or think straight.,Then one night I hear Dr. David Franklin on TV saying the drug is a scam and was marketed for 11 unapproved uses by inventor ParkeDavis and knew it was destroying peoples lives and could not take it anymore and spilled the beans after PD sold it to Phiser. Phiser knew this and still markets it. The only use it was ever approved for is Grand Mal siezures and only in conjuction with another drug. Now they have added Herpes Pain. If you are getting it for anything else_ you are being scammed; you are not even a Guina Pig_ your a Big Pharma punk. They do not care. I pray everyday to God for justice and he says to read the 10 commandments to see what he is doing to all responsible. God states he will punish their 3&4th generations. He states he gets results when he starts punishing and making sick their grandchildren and great grandchildren because the rich will throw their own children under the bus but knows he strikes a nerve when he takes it out on the grandchildren but this of course takes time_ years and leaves it up to the victims to warn the rest of us. BE WARNED! Check the 10 Commandments you are told are the 10 Commandments. God says many churches leave out the part about HIM getting your grandchildren and HOPE that it is not true. God says he would not of told Moses a lie. God states HOPE is the last evil in pandoras box. How is HOPE evil?

I was feeling that it was doing more harm than good. My family saw the same thing. Then I noticed that it was actually starting to help (my feet can get so painful that I couldn't walk) and became willing to increase dosage. I should add that I take 15 mg x 3 of morphine and they really work well together for me. I still have a lot of bad days but the good days are increasing. I've had a couple of times that my pharmacy held my 'script and I have run out and it's intense_ even with morphine. I realize that this is something that I'm probably taking for life.

Until I am completely free from these_ I can't guarantee how much of the following symptoms are soley due to meds. I do not have the best memory_ but this has been severly impaired (to the point of forgetting to go to work - not because I was asleep_ just because something distracted my thought path)and struggling to find the right words had convinced me that I was suffering early dementia. I am 41 and used to joke about being scatty. Now I'm just embarrassed. Social life has changed because I just don't feel that bothered about seeing folk. This is not depression - have been through that once and this is very different. Don't seem to be able to run around the house as I used to. Thought it might be sudden onset of.. middle age. Have a temper like I have never know. So aggressive - just want to SHOUT! Relationship suffering. Wondered if we had just stopped loving each other. Everything I know about me_ has been put into question_ even though physically_ I don't feel that different. At the moment_ everything just irritates me!

Neurontin has helped stabilize mood and dull excruciating nerve pain. Isn't a perfect drug_ but works well.

I have never been physically violent in any relationship_ not a fighter. But I could not control my temper on that dose.

I could not for the life of me figure out HOW in the world I gained that much weight so quickly_ as I was doing nothing different. I work out daily and do NOT eat junk/fast food. It just hit me yesterday to google this medication and I have been on this site reading the experiences of others and I firmly believe this medication has not only caused my weight gain_ but also hair loss_ brain fog and other symptoms that I was not attributing to the medication until I read that others also had these side effects. I am going to immediately decrease the dosage until I am totally OFF this medication. It is not worth it. Too bad physicians these days REFUSE to prescribe pain meds to people in legitimate pain.

Initially it made me very thirsty and sick to my stomach.  Continued as there was not another pain med I was willing to take.  Some pain in face resolved_ but never had full pain relief.  Started noticing I was becoming very forgetful. I forgot important things and started making mistakes.  Pretty soon the memory loss affected my quality of life. I was unable to concentrate and noticed my face started to twitch like Parkinson's Disease. My feet and fingers burned constantly. Several times I tried to come off the med but had terrible withdrawal syndrome. I couldn't stand the intense panic I felt when trying to wean off.  After recently reading about drug-induced dementia from psychiatric and other anti-cholinergenic drugs I decided to try again to wean myself off. Happy to report that I am now free from neurontin for one day. I went from 900 milligrams to two weeks of 600 milligrams_ then two weeks of 300 milligrams a day_ then two days of 150 milligrams and today none!  I had severe chest pain and panic disorder while withdrawing.  Several sleepless nights.  But_ today my face is not twiching and I did not have any full body jerks either.

Want to get off this poison though b/c I had surgery on my low back 20 months ago and neck 11 months ago.

The PCP sold it to me as a great alternative for pain pills. He never mentioned all these side effects though when he started me on this awful_ horrible medicine.

290, 4, Migraines_ Leg Pain,Dizzy_ the kind of feeling like you get when you've had a little too much to drink_ a fog.,I originally started taking this as a migraine preventative but found that it also stopped the constant pain in my calves and back pain that I had had for the past 18 years.  It didn't get rid of my migraines but the pain from the migraines was in the background and they were no longer so severe that I lost vision or vomited.  It was more the fact that I didn't care that the pain was there.  I also added Excedrin Migraine and that_ along with gabapentin_ seem to take the migraines away_ for the most part.  I have noticed that I can no longer do much physical exertion because that causes me to get more dizzy.  When I first started taking it_ I could eat a meal and then five minutes later_ I was starved.  I knew that was something in the med so I would just not eat more and I haven't gained any weight.  I started with a dosage of 600 mg/day_ taken at night.  Within 30 minutes_ the pain in my calves is gone_ although occasionally one foot feels hot inside.  It is not hot to the touch but I can put it in cold water and it feels good.  After another 30 minutes that is gone.  I feel great in the morning_ although it is difficult to get out of bed because I'm still tired.  After I get up_ I am a little dizzy and groggy.  After work I come home and usually take a nap.  I don't want to but I am so tired.  After a nap_ I am dizzy and groggy again.  It isn't a great feeling but it seems so much better than dealing with the leg pain and migraines.,M,55,1  years600 mg 1X D,8/3/2010Email,Neurontin

Trying to recover from Neurontin was worse then the pinched nerve it was trying to fix. I tried vitamins and supplements for 6 weeks with almost no mental improvement. Finally found solution: Provigil. Taking a low dosage of Provigil (50mg/day_ 4x/week) completely erased the Neurontin/Gabapentin side effects while I recovered. Over time_ the negative side-effects have retreated to the point I don't need the Provigil to stay functional at work.

After being on for a few months_ I started developing skin wounds_ rashes and infections that would not heal.  Then I noticed that I had bald patches forming on my scalp.  I did not notice hair falling out because it affects the forming follicles which turn into something resembling a carpet fuzz.  As hair falls out it is not replaced or is replaced by weak and thin hair.  Hope it grows back.,This is a very serious drug that I believe should only be used as last resort for short periods of time.

308, 1, pain management and menoapause,This in my opinion is a very dangerous drug. I thought at first it might be helping. Looking back over my chart I realize as I increased the dose_ my menopause symptoms actually got worse. I began to experience physical depression; fatigue and inability to cope. After four months on it i began to increase the dose on the advice of poorly informed doctors. I began to develop somnalence; swelling of my hands; ataxia; tinnitus and decreased immune system. Saddly_ despite my complaints my doctor(s) failed to recognize the connection between the drug and the side effects. Eventually I just was not coping emotionally and psychologically. As Doctor Tom Perry says from the Therapeutics Initiative this drug can in some of us cause brain toxicity and it is hard to describe what is really going on.

I thought this was the drug I had been waiting for all of my life.  My depression_ anxiety_ and insomnia were greatly reduced and I could still have organsms.  Then_ about two weeks ago_ it stopped working.  I was so disappointment - my insomnia and anxiety (but not the depressive thoughts) returned.  My shrink upped the dose from 900 to 1200 mgs at bedtime.  Symptoms have not improved and my insomnia is worse than ever.  On top of that_ the increased dosage has caused me to be extremely tired_ lethargic and I am now experiencing the word loss (I gave a talk yesterday and noticed how difficult it was - I had given this same talk numerous times and could not remember my presentation.)  I am so upset and disappointed because I thought I finally found the right medicine for me.  To make matters worse I took my old sleep inducing standby - Klonapin.  With the Neurontin in my system the Klonapin had an antagonistic relationship and I was awake all night!  Want to wean off before I gain more weight and lose my job.

318, 3, spinal tumors_ sciatica,"SIGNIFICANT memory loss and ""brain fog"".",I have a love/hate relationship with Neurontin.  It works wonders on my nerve pain (I have a large_ inoperable tumor on the left sciatic nerve)_ and really calms down some of the fibromyalgia pain.  My GP initially tried me with Lyrica_ but I had EVERY adverse side effect except organ injury and death.  We then switched to Neurontin_ and the difference was night and day in terms of pain relief and (mostly) lack of adverse effects.  But I have serious issues with the memory loss it causes.  My short-term memory is shot to H-ll.  I will literally forget what I'm doing_ where I'm going_ etc._ in the MIDDLE of doing something.  I've been known to get to a flight of stairs and not remember whether I wanted to go up or down them_ and will just stand there with one foot poised to move onto the stairs_ which is SERIOUSLY dangerous when you're standing before a descending staircase with your foot dangling in mid-air (and yes_ I've fallen down stairs because of it).  It affects my work to the point where I'm seriously worried about my job.  Would I recommend Neurontin?  Maybe.

Could be post holiday.,"I have suffered from mild depression_ anxiety_ and INSOMNIA since memory.  I have tried all of the SSRI's_ Wellbutrin_ and Nardil.  All alleviated the depression_ acted some on the anxiety - but had to stop because my insomnia went from rotten to worse.  I stopped taking medication for about two years and my symptoms became unbearable.  Could not function at work because I was surviving on 3 - 4 hours of sleep and a nervous wreck.  Klonapin worked for sleep - but I limited it to two nights a week to avoid dependency - but my insomnia was worse the nights I did not take it.  Decided to have sleep study  and the neurologist asked me if I ever tried Neurontin.  I told him no.  I then asked my shrink for a Rx.  I started on weekly increments of 100 mgs and ended with a final dose of 900 mgs at bedtime.  This is drug I have been waiting for!  Sleep is not perfect_ but if I get up at 3:30 or 4 AM I am able to fall back to sleep.  Depressive symptoms gone!  Anxiety reduced by about 75% - all this and able to have orgasms!

Slowly increased dose up to 1800mgs a day over 3 doses. Still need to take tramadol and diazepam as needed for back pain. I thin there is tachyphylaxis involved with this drug (the longer you take it the more you will need to escalate the dose) although the dr will not comment!! Certainly not the magic bullet it was at the beginning of treatement (for the first 9 motnhs or so).

It was the only medicine that seemed to help with the alternating pain & tingling/numbness in my right neck/shoulder/arm/hand. A few years later_ I was treated for depression until it was discovered that I was Bipolar II. At first the Neurontin was maxed to 3000/mgs a day_ being that I was on Neurontin for pain mgmt. I became mega manic. I was reverted back to 300/mg 2x/day & Lamactil was added_ which I love. So many meds were tried to manage my depression episodes of Bipolar_ and this combination seems to work well. I have had weight gain issues_ but I have learned that I can control that with exercise & healthy eating. I will not be 125 lbs as when I was young_ but I will be happy at 145 which is the weight I leveled out to on the Neurontin in 1998. My struggle is with the hair loss issue. My hair will not grow as it used to on this medicine. Prior to taking it_ my hair length was to the middle of my back. Now my right side only grows to my shoulder_ while the left side grows normally.

335, 3, Bipolar 2 Mood Stabilizer +GAD,Clumsiness_ brain 'fog'_ lack of concentration_ increased appetite_ decreased judgement_'bad mix with alcohol (I don't drink any more_ anyway)_ weight gain (if appetite is not kept in check)_ somnolence. Anxiety also increases/returns when my body adapts to the dosage.,I have been on this drug for a long time_ it has been a decent medication_ for the most part. It's mild_ compared to the benzos and much easier to titrate off of. However_ your body will adapt to the drug_ as it has a short half life and works rather quickly. Increases in dosage are common for me; I have doubled the amount that I was initially prescribed over the years. A better strategy is to knock down your dosage for awhile and then increase it; you'll have better results. I take between 900mgs and 1200 mgs a day along with 200mgs of Lamictal and it has been a good combination for me.

338, 5, Severe Sciatica & Herniated Disks,It's hard to know if symptoms result from neurontin gabapentin or medical conditions. Symptoms include: intense and persistent cough (but I have allergies & asthma); cognitive decline_ difficulty concentrating_ memory loss_ and trouble finding words and doing simple things (but I suffer from neurotoxicity to VOCs in environment--have even prior to taking gabapentin).,Neurontin is like a miracle drug; without it I couldn't function.  300 mg_ t.i.d. keeps sciatic pain manageable as long as I (1) do not lean or bend forward_ (2) do not lift or push more than a few pounds infrequently_ and (3) keep most other physical activity to a minimum.  So_ even with Neurontin_ herniated disks and sciatica force me to greatly limit most normal everyday activities.,F,58,7  years,12/4/2009,Neurontin

Possible hyperness at times as some have observed in my behavior.  DO NOT drink alcohol while on this drug.,OFF LABEL USE - Took 900mg every 8 hours (2700mg) for the first 6 months.  Have begun to decrease the last month VERY SLOWLY - 600mg every 8 hours during day and 900mg at bedtime.  After 2 weeks of this decrease began 300mg every 8 hours and then 600mg at bedtime for this week and next.  Then will do 300mg every 8 hours total of 900mg per 24hrs.  Aim is to be off totally to see how the chronic cough is.  For now_ there has been little change since decreasing doseage except my feet no longer ache  (side affect?).  Dr. is using this RX as off label. Sensory neuropathic cough - have had a dry chronic cough for 5 years.  They put me on everything to help solve problem.  I did find much relief from using Gabapentin - about 90% improvement.  I hope to go completely off this rx in the next month.  Do not like taking it and believe it has helped my cough.  But_ wondering if cough could be something else... will know in the next couple of months.  If cough returns to 100% of the time_ literally was_ then I will most likely return to Rx.

I replaced Butterbur with feverfew which I couldn't take.    Anyway_ at this time I would say it helps.  I don't plan to increase dosage.  I do end up in bed by 9_ but then again am up early--3-4 am-- (I'm a morning person anyway so it's not a problem).  The absentmindedness is in the nature of that moment when the word's on the tip of your tongue but you can't think what it is.  I forewarned my friends; initially_ I had frequent moments now it's not as often.    I've tried various prescriptions_ acupuncture_ etc.  It's early to say this is my ""miracle"" drug (7 months).

Second morning_ less dizziness_ still extremely tired_ could drive though. Third night_ had to take 2 pills 6 hours apart to get relief. Fourth night_ refuse to take more than 1 pill as surgery is in two days and tomorrow I won't take it.,Interesting how quick the dose had to be increased to get relief. Other pain areas that are from irritates nerves settled down immediately and stayed settled down as long as they were not re-irritated. Was somewhat a staggering drunk the first two days on it and took several hours to feel awake. After taking the dose_ the problem area became almost locked in position_ not wanting to bend normally. Somewhat dulls one's perceptions and releases inhibitions_ where I did stuff I ought not to have_ nothing criminal_ but I may later regret those actions.

354, 1, Off label back pain management,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG FOR ANY OFF LABEL USE.  I have suffered thses side effects for almost 10 years. The drug company_ Pfizer_ has settled some law suits but they make literally 100's of billions of dollars on this usage_ and have only paid out a few billion_ so it is profitable for them to continue to market it to doctors who are encoouraged to prescribe it for any type of nerve pain and even psychiatric conditions.  I developed Meniere's disease.  Symptoms are vertigo_ ear ringing_nausea_hearing loss. This side effect never went away_ nor will it_ and has rendered me disabled.  It is a disease that has no cure nor any consistently effective management techniques.  One never knows when it will strike and I have had acute episodes that have lasted over a month.  It feels like the absolute worse case of motion illness you can imagine.  Often one cannot even walk or lift one's head.  One can not even move one's head slightly without making it worse. The acute symptoms are managed with l,"DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG FOR ANY OFF LABEL USE_ or any drug for off label use.  Basically ""off label"" means there is no verifiable data that supports that the drug is useful in any way for any conditions not specifically approved.  This means there is no data nor any information being officially compiled about the off label use.  The drug companies can and do just make up the idea that it is useful for other purposes other than those for which it is approved._ and they are not suppose to market it for off label use but they do.  Thery have had to pay the ""whistle blowers"" billions_ but not enough that the products aren';t still profitable.  If one makes $1 Billion and only has to pay out $100 million out in settlements_ they will continue.  This is a common business practice.  The auto industry is known for this.  It is cheaper to pay off the families of the dead than to fix the problem.  You may recall the gas tank explosions that would have reqired a change costing less than $50_ but it was still cheaper to let some consumers burn up_ than to fix the car.",F,57,90  days,10/15/2009,Neurontin

The first time i took it i had some thoughts of self harm but that has not been the case this time.,This has helped some with the pain. Not as much as i hoped since the pain can be bad. I don't want to be addicted to pain killers so this is really the only option. I was also given lyrica but decided not to take it after hearing bad feed back.

I started out at 200mg every 8 hours which was near impossible to keep up with. I had funny dizzy type feelings at first then it went away. I was fine pain gone_ then pain back_ doc upped me to 600mg every 12hrs. Ok pain gone_ now I cannot remember anything. NOTHING! I ask people things twice then ask again. My college classes are getting so difficult I cannot hardly do it. I was a 4.0 student! Not anymore. I haven't gained any weight_ but have no sex life period any longer.

In summary_ pretty mild effects compared to some other drugs I've taken_ though my dose is fairly low.,I'm not yet sure how much this is helping my leg pain/numbness/tingling (secondary to a spine injury) because these things improved somewhat while taking oral steroids just before starting the Neurontin.  The improvement has held while I've been on the Neurontin.

It has helped enough with the fibro that I can tell a difference_ but not a huge difference.  Without a midday dose I can work fine_ but definitely need it for pain about 5 p.m. which begins to become almost intolerable.,"I have gained 45 lbs taking Neurontin only 9 months. SO I decided to wean myside and see what would happen.  I weaned slowly over a 2-week period.  After just 1 day of no Neurontin IMMEDIATELY the RLS returned and kept me awake at night with leg pain.  But the really scary part - I believe to have tremor-like seizures in my head; it felt like I had a drill turned on in my skull for a few seconds that left a taste in my mouth and my teeth sore.  I stood this for about 1-1/2 weeks of these seizures increasing to 3 a day average and I jumped back on the Neurontin.  It tooks another 2 weeks for my head to ""feel normal"" and the seizures just gradually weaned away.  So_ no matter how large I get (I am 230 now) I will be too afraid to ever stop the Neurontin again.  But I tell myself it is worth it for the leg pain to be gone.  I would toss and turn all night and feel a deep ache in both legs and a feeling as if electricity was running up and down my legs_ even in my feet.

365, 4, RLS/nerve damage in legs,Started with 300mg 2 times a day_ and 2400mg at night to combat the RLS. This medicine works pretty well for RLS_ and my episode per month have gone down quite a bit. Gabapentin was also invaluable for me when I was withdrawing from Vicodin. It made the opiate withdrawal much more bearable. I only had one uncomfortable incident after taking a larger dose one day; I became very manic_ wouldn't shut up_ mind was racing_ and I felt like I was under the influence of alcohol. This has not happened again_ but I do get a noticeable mood lift (almost euphoric) from Gabapentin_ and it often makes me feel inebriated.,Works pretty well for RLS_ but be careful because you can have a nasty withdrawal if you've been on high doses of Gabapentin for a while.,F,24,4  months,9/3/2009,Neurontin

The side effects can be a pain_ but's better than manic cycling.,This has been a good medication for me; it prevents manic episodes and is works for anxiety. For those of you with bipolar disorder_ this medication is worth a try. It's a good mood stabilizer for me and I haven't had terrible side effects from it. Something to bear in mind; neurontin IS a safer drug than the benzos; it's not addictive and is much easier to get off of. It's also the best medication I have found for sleep and I have been on quite a few; a dose taken an hour or so before bed time works very well; as long as I don't take too much. I have found that_ at the higher doses (900mgs+)_ it's important to space the doses out evenly; it will limit the side effects.,M,27,7  years,8/16/2009,Neurontin

427, 5, Migraine_ Nerve & Occipital Pain,A little jittery maybe.,My neurologist told me that I could actually take this drug on an as needed basis for my break through head pain and migraines_ since I am taking Cymbalta as a preventative. I have taken 200 mg's twice for acute occipital nerve pain and migraine and am thrilled to say it helped drastically both times within the hour! The neurologist does not want me to take it daily until we determine whether the Cymbalta is working or not_ but based on how much it helped my pain I will definitely try this medication next on a daily basis if the Cymbalta fails. I am relieved that it works because I am starting to have stomach pains from taking so much Motrin and really needed an alternative!,F,43,2  days,11/19/2008Email,Neurontin

430, 2, rls and neuropathy,I was on neurontin for about 6 weeks. In the beginning it worked well with no side effects; however after 5 weeks or so I became very_ very tired all the time. I was afraid to drive. I'd fall asleep just sitting in a chair. The longer I took it the more tired I became. I've stopped taking it. While it worked for rls and neuropathy while on it the rest of my life was a yawn.,Besides the sleepiness I found it hard to follow conversations. My RLs isn't bad enough to warrant this medicine. The cure was worse than the conditon. Odd_ that it worked well for a few weeks without tiredness to start.,F,66,6  weeks,11/8/2008,Neurontin

I have worked up to 300mg 3 times a day and the pain relief is very good.  I really notice if I miss even a single dose as the pain gets much worse.  Don't like the side effects_ especially the sexual ones_ so much so that I tried to discontinue the drug_ but after a couple days off the medication the pain got extremely intense again and I realized how much relief the drug was actually giving me.  Have decided to put up with the side effects to reduce the nerve pain.,F,43,10  months,11/4/2008,Neurontin
432, 2, Shingles,Blurred vision_ extreme brain fog_ fatigue but difficulty falling asleep_ abdominal pain,I had the side effects mentioned while I was taking 600 mg daily (with no apparent pain relief)so I cut that dose in half to 300 mg.  I still have a little blurred vision but the other side effects have pretty much gone away.  Since I didn't feel I was getting any pain relief_ I called the pharmacy and asked them how long it took for neurontin to start working_ and was told 7-14 days.  I'm on day 12 now_ and continue to take 300 mg a day on the off chance that it's providing some relief.  It's hard to tell as I still need to take a celebrex every morning and tylenol in the afternoon and before I go to bed.  I don't know if my pain would be worse if I wasn't taking the neurontin_ and I don't want to find out_ so I'll take it another week or two until my shingles pain is hopefully gone.,F,56,12  days,10/26/2008,Neurontin

In general_ significantly slows down my metabolism.    Sleepiness.  Flu-ish body aches about once a month.   Difficulty concentrating.    Sometimes I lose my balance.  Almost constant twitches under one eye for about two weeks when dosage increased.,Although the side effects are significant_ the pain syndrome is worse.  In other words_ the drug affects how I function_ but I wouldn't be able to live with the amount of pain caused by the CRPS.   I take 1800 mg/day_ and for the most part it keeps my symptoms from being severe.  I added Cymbalta 60mg/day this year_ which helped take the edge off of symptoms even more_ and helped with sleeping.   It appears to be a good combination.

Usually however when I do fall asleep I sleep hard for 5 hours or so.",Neurontin has been a godsend to me_ personally.  It has greatly reduced daily pain_ though it does little or nothing for event-induced pain (Such as 'doing too much'_ turning my leg incorrectly' and even bad weather symptoms).  I am currently taking 3200 mg per day (800 mg 4 times daily).  Due to a prescription error_ I was without the med for 5 days... the pain then returned with a vengence.  Would be very afraid to come off this medication quickly_ if at all.  Doctor has prescriped 50 mg Nortriptyline to be taken with the last dose per day...  Not sure why_ but ??  The dosage may be increased next month to a maximum of 3600 mg daily (900 mg x 4)with an additional increase to 75 mgs of nightly Nortriptyline.

I see the doctor next month and will talk to her about it.,I have taken neurontin for almost 5yrs now.  My Infectious disease doctor started me on it after taking 1500 mg of robaxin daily which could effect my liver and only took the edge off the pain.  I only take 700-800 mg at night to help me sleep and control the muscle spasms_ my husband says I am dangerous when I don't take it.  I haven't really gained any weight and only recently had trouble with my gums and that may be just getting older_ who knows.  If I don't take the neurontin at night it feels like someone has taped electodes to me and is zapping me with electricity_ not fun.

I do have restless legs_ but the high for me was better than cocaine_ alcohol_ or any other illegal drug. I found an online pharmacy where I could get it shipped w/o a prescription for less than a dollar per pill and these are 800 mg capsules. Now I see that prolonged use just turns you into a zombie and you lose the ability to enjoy life. Now it pretty much just makes me feel normal and i have taken upwards of 5000 mgs in one day.

514, 4, Social anxiety,Slight dizziness/light-headedness at times. Nothing major.,I took Neurontin in conjunction with an antidepressant. My psychiatrist prescribed this when I still felt anxious in social situations even though my antidepressant was helping with depression. It did work. I didn't necessarily feel better about my social interactions_ but I didn't get so nervous and paralyzed. I was able to deal with them. I also had a good therapist. I'll give this a 4 because I don't know to what extent my other meds and therapist helped my anxiety_ but I still believe this medication helped.,F,20,1.5  years,12/29/2007Email,Neurontin

No diagnosis.  Thought I had Shingles_ doctor said probably not as the rash I had was mostly on left side_ but extended also to right_ and because both of my legs are effected.  MRI did not reveal spinal stenosis.  I am an active tennis player_ but after only 20 or 30 minutes was weak and knees want to collapse.  Anyone have any idea what may be wrong with me?  Also rode bicycle often.  Thought maybe pesticide poison from Equine Fly Spray?  I just don't know.,"Doctor put me on 200mg. twice daily.  The pain and radiating nerve situation subsided.  Felt ""spacey"" and had mind-numbing effect others describe.  Vision was blurred and slightly doubled_ especially bad at night where lights ""flare"" and made playing tennis at night impossible.  Tried to stop after about a month_ but symptoms returned on the second day.  Resumed original dose for a couple weeks_ then cut back to 100mg. am/pm.  Doctor suggested I try only at night_ so I cut back again to only one at night.  Side effects remained_ so on Dec.4th I stopped taking Neurontin.  So far...I'm ok without it.  But my vision is still messed up.  Doctor checked my eyes and can't explain it_ so maybe someone here knows something?  No regrets_ the pain and radiating nerve thing was unbearable.   Could not sleep or function.  Maybe left me depressed - or may have been my health condition?  Still have muscle weakness - though better but no pain.",F,55,2  months,12/29/2007Email,Neurontin

517, 5, anxiety disorders_ depression,drowsiness_ which is a good thing since I take it at night before bed.  Dizziness_ foggy head_ headache_ which all go away with continued use.,Gabapentin does work very well for generalized anxiety and social anxiety.It has a moderate effect on depression as well. I take 600mg at night before bed.I would never take it during the day as it knocks you out and/or severely affects your ability to function normally for 6-8 hours after a dose.When I wake-up_ I feel great.It elevates gaba levels_ and eliminates the generalized anxiety associated with being overwhelmed with everyday tasks.  It also eliminates that nervous feeling when thinking about being in social situations_ and allows me to look forward to social situations.  It also makes me far less apprehensive to engage in conversation with people I don't know.  This drug needs to be experimented with to get the right dose_ and the side affects go away_ but it did take almost 6 months for them to go away.  The drowsiness is a side affect that doesn't go away_ and thats why I would suggest taking it in the evening.  Its a great drug to use in conjunction with an SSRI or SNRI.,M,33,1.5  years,12/21/2007,Neurontin

523, 1, Post accident injuries,This drug did nothing for the pain. However_ it did cause SEVERE irritability_ feeling of rage_ sleeplessness_ nightmares_ increased dizziness_ mania_ and seizures. My doctor prescribed this medication without a full diagnosis. My complaints were pain in my hip_ leg_ foot_ and partial paralysis in the leg_ dizziness and fatigue following an accident involving a concussion. I called the doctor after one week of not sleeping and was told to continue taking the medication. After another week I had a siezure_ called the doctor again_ and was told to continue taking it since it was an anti-seizure medications. I have NO history of siezure_ nor does anyone in my family. I disconntinued use after that phone call and sought treatment elsewere. Apparantly the cause of the pain was a dislocated pelvic bone_ and physical theropy was all that was needed after the bone was put back in place. The effects of the concussion cleared up on thier own after a few nights of pain-free sleep.,This medication is good for those who truely need it. However_ it is being prescribe as a blanket drug. This is a dangerous practice with any kind of drug that alters brain chemistry. Those being prescribe Neurontin for conditions other then the manufactures recomendations should seek a second opinion. A dislocated hip is obviously not a chemical nor neroligical issue.,F,28,2  weeks,12/14/2007,Neurontin

The sentences end up choppy_ unsophisticated_ out of order.  I'm unable to form coherent complex sentences.,Obviously my problem isn't so bad that communication breaks down_ but it's still a major problem for me because I used to be a writer.  I eventually had to give up my job.  I have a hard time writing papers for school_ and even emails take a long time.  I use the cut-and-paste function and the thesaurus all the time.  It helps just a little. My inability to write makes me very sad.    I take a very high dose--4800 mg a day (1200 mg every four hours).

It took the edge off and did allow me to live more normally.  I was actually able to run again and exercise like I was used to doing. I seemed to have more energy than before - but maybe this is because of the decrese in pain.  I had no side effects at all and was surprised at the gentle way this drug worked for me.  I took 300 mg/day (100 mg_ 3x per day.)  Everybody's body chemistry is different- I was kind of surprised to see all the people who had negative effects from this drug.  I only quit taking the drug when the herniation became worse and I ended up needing surgery to remove the disc.

Cut out 400 mg. for about 2-3 months_ then cut out next 400. Also Docs don't always look for reasons like B12 deficiency_ thyroid problems_ or low iron/ferritin absorbtion into red blood cells. Anemia causes restless legs. Your iron test will be normal. My neurologist did a different Ferritin test that most doctors don't know to do.  My iron was 12_normal; but my ferritin was 6_ almost at transfusion level. Your ferritin is supposed to be 90-120. I am now low normal_ a 70.

I drank alcohol for many years then got addicted to opiates(prescription pain killers) after taking as prescribed for years for chronic arthritis. The addictionologist told me this was all due to nerve damage stemming from the substance abuse & that Neurontin would help. I immediately got very bloated & my appetite came back big time. I really haven't gained much weight but my stomach area is huge compared to what it used to be. I have been clean & sober for 79 days thinking that my brain would start to function again instead I'm in a fog_ have trouble with words_concentration_ etc. I have been taking the drug along with Campral for alcohol cravings. My legs_feet & hands feel the same maybe even weaker then before. My stomach is constantly bloated & gurgling. I have to pee all the time.,didn't think about these things being side effects until I read all your comments. I just thought it was my body having a hard time functioning because of the abuse I have given it. Now I'm scared I will have to go through horrible withdrawels again if I get off this drug.

However_ as time went on I noticed that the pain was increasing_ the more I took_ the worse the pain became.  So I decided to wean off and see how I would do without it.  Maybe the neurontin was causing some of the pain.The withdrawal effects were really quite terrible and I had to wean off very slowly over a one month period with the use of xanax to control the tremors and pain of withdrawal.

My husband says I've not been myself - I notice I don't feel the ""sparkle"" or magic of life - everything seems really ""dull"" and numb. Which seems to help the seizures which were often caused by visual stimuli.  I've started taking the medicine out of the geletin capsuls (it tastes terrible) - but it seems like the weight gain has slowed down since.  I'm really bummed that I have to take this_ but it totally helps the seizures. I am trying to cut down from 1800/day to 1200 / day_ but it seems futile_ as I feel totally crazy trying to take less.

This was a VERY obvious side effect for me and as a writer_ I could not adjust to this.,I actually felt this did some good as an added benefit_ my insomnia went away completely!!! It also eradicated the nerve pain in my hip that I have lived with since a car accident 20 years ago and loved that.  Unfortunately getting off of it was hard.  It was like all the blocked pain came back with a vengence and I felt as if I was losing my mind.

I have more headaches than usual and it does nothing for my myriad of physical aches and pains.,I'd love it if it weren't for making me crave sweets. I already have problems with binge eating but none of the other mood stabilizers are good for me_ so this is what I've got to work with. I've gained some weight since I've been on it but I don't know if it's me or the Neurontin. I had to increase my dosage after a year to keep the bipolar and anxiety away because the severe mood swings and agitation was creeping back in. I get very good sleep with this medication though. I can take as many benzo's as I want and they can't beat Neurontin for a good nights sleep. I was previously on Depakote and it didn't help me near as much as this.

I was utterly amazed when it did work.  I wasn't happy about the lethargy_ but that was better than the pain_ and within a few weeks_ the lethargy subsided and I returned to a normal life.  In December_ 2006_ I was able to stop taking the Neurontin and am now mostly pain-free.  I have had no side-effects from taking it or stopping it.

635, 2, Chronic Pain; Fibro,Bad side effects.  It made me extremely DIZZY and DROWSY.  However_ the worst side effect was the DOUBLE VISION.  The doctor (see additional comments) wanted to increase the doseI was on_ but I told him there was no way that I could function at the current dosage and I would not allow an increase.  It is important to keep in mind with my case that the physician who prescribed this med for me was not taking into account the TYPE of PAIN that I had....therefore_I should never have been given Neurontin.,"I was prescribed this by a physician who was listed as a ""pain specialist"".  I discovered that he was not Board Certified in Pain_ Anesthesiology nor in Neurology.  He was ""opiate-phobic"" and tried meds such as Neurontin for off-patent use.  I have seen recent studies that this medicine can be very useful for neuropathic pain_ but that was not my problem. As a neuroscientist_ I was interested in this medicine when the doctor first told me about it.  It is related to the neurotransmitter GABA [won't bore everyone with details].  Since I have suffered from Panic Disorder for over 15 years_ and this medicine was brand new at the time_ I thought that it might ""kill two birds with one stone"".  [One theory of panic disorder is a problem with the GABA levels or at the GABA transmitter site].  However_ upon reading the PDR materials that I received from the pharmacist after getting it filled_ it became apparent to me that while the medicine is structurally related",M,44,1  months,10/10/2006,Neurontin

Not sure if it is the Neurontin because this is my seasonal migraine high point (I am also in the midst of writing my PhD dissertation so the stress level is very high!).  Thirsty a lot - I didn't know that was a side-effect until I read it hear.  Dizziness and ""high"" feeling only lasted about a week.  Burning stomach last about 2-3 weeks.  Increased hunger is still with me but getting less over time.  I don't think I have gained much weight - I eat about the same and my pant size hasn't changed. I do get cravings for sweets in the evening - that is new.  No real brain fog_ actually my thoughts are clearer.  I had bad brain fog on Topomax(taken as a migaine prophylaxis).  I have noticed on other websites that people who hate Topomax seem to love Neurontin and visa versa - maybe a personal brain chemistry thing.",It really reduced anxiety_ aggitation and mild mania (fast talking).  My wife can tell if I miss a dose so it must be good!

Could barely stand up.  He was bedbound within 4 days of this 'miracle' drug.  Just wiped him out in every way_ physically and mentally.  I'd be very careful with this med_ esp. for the elderly but even if younger.  It's potent and when I tried to take him off after just one week_ wow_ he fell apart even more for about 5-6 harrowing days.  I guess these were withdrawls_ after only 1 week?

Am also taking darvocet n 100 w/apap 650 so don't know how much is increased with this new drug...now naseaus (wasn't before with Neurontin),The issue is that I didn't realize that some of the things I have experienced over time were or could be side effects.  I am 48 and other than problems with my back_ have never taken meds and have had no other medical issues.  Extreme back pain going down my leg was diagnosed as a herniated disk.  After surgery left residual burning and tingling in my left foot and leg_ Neurontin/gabapentin was prescribed.  I was told to titrate up (increase dose to best result).  I started with 600 mg 3 times a day and was instructed to stay on that dosage unless the pain increased.  I ended up with a second lower herniation and had an additional surgery a few days ago.  I am SERIOUSLY CONCERNED with my dosage as a pain management doctor told me (as I was in extreme pain prior to the surgery) that it was o.k. to increase my dosage to 1200 mg (4 300 mg capsules) 3 times a day.   That's 3600 mg a day.  JEEEEEEZ.  I stopped taking a few other drugs after the surgery and I have had recent bad dreams_ depr,F,48,8  months,2/5/2006,Neurontin
683, 3, Bipolar / Psychlothymia,Wow! You know that feeling when you've just had three beers on an empty stomach? I'm just starting to increase my dosage of Gabapentin up to a functional level. And boy_ does it make me feel GOOD! Starting yesterday_ I've been taking 600 mg in the morning and 300 mg at night. I've lost all interest in eating until about 7pm at night. Yesterday_ I spent all day reading weblogs. Today_ I spent two hours at a computer store playing a demo game on the X-Box. When I stepped away from the machine- Whoah! I felt higher than a kite! But now I'm starting to crash and mellow-out. I had a couple donuts to eat. Maybe I feel this way because my blood sugar is low. Maybe I'm just acclimating to the medication. I've only been at this dosage for two days. But I'll tell you-- two years on Lamictal didn't do a damn thing for me except make my hands ache and twitch and give me a cyst on my tongue when it swelled-up. Gabapentin.... Oh_ that the stuff...

Take with protein to reduce fogginess the next morning and make sure you have EIGHT HOURS to sleep.  This will reduce the memory loss and lack of word retrival. I reduced dosage several times over four years. 800mg 1X/day worked best for a long time_ but now I take 400mg 1X/day with the SAME EFFECTIVENESS and today starting 200mg!

Less medication is definitely better.",Chronic pain from an accident resulting in a ruptured cervical disk with minimal cord encroachment. Affected sensation in the hands and pain in the shoulder resembling dislocation. The pain was so bad I was sick and nauseas and unable to function at my job. I was informed that I was having small seizures as my body was trying to heal. Four years later_ I'm still in a healing process_ but it is much better.Neurontin saved my sanity! Although initially I was taking it because of neck pain_ my OA is better_ too and I have less headaches. I take less other medications.

An exaggeration_ but the experience was so overwhelmingly negative for me_ I simply can't conceive of this drug helping anyone.

Went to 4 drs. before finding one who would give me anything for pain. Neurontin allows me to function. Surgery is in my future. No suicidal thoughts whatsoever.

734, 4, Motion Sickness 24/7 Post Traumatic,Initially I was sleepy_ feeling sort of slow. I was able to sleep through the night. My constant nausea for three years was replaced with sleepy_ which was good. Believe me_ sleepy is better than nausea! I gained some weight and purchased some 'fat pants'. I am normally quite thin. ( I hit my head on the headrest of the car while being rear-ended. ),Reading about Neurontin is facinating. All the Neurontin one takes passes through the body and is excreted. No medication is perfect. But I can walk better without feeling the rocking_ swimming_ nausea feeling. Whew! Nausea is improved overall_ still improving little by little every day. I take 500 mg 3x per day. Also has helped with post traumatic headache. Very loud sounds (amplified sound) I may need more for a few days. I increase it 100 mg. This medication is a synthetic buliding block of protein. It has had a claming effect for me. I choose sleepy over nausea. Thanks PD!

735, 5, atypical trigeminal neuralgia,First few days_ a bit groggy but manageable.

Thankfully_ no other side effects(so far). I have gained about a pound or so in the two weeks I have been taking but_ fortunately_ I am thin to begin with.  If I gain a few extra pounds_ I will accept in exchange for pain relief.,Have suffered with atypical trigeminal neuralgia/myofacial pain for more than 7 yrs.  Have seen dentists_ endodontists_periodontists_TMJ specialists_ ENT docs_ neurologists.  Pain in left jaw_mouth_ teeth_ eye.  Have a deep burning_ aching sensation which has gradually gotten worse over time.  Has made my life miserable. Was prescribed Trileptalbut did not use correctly (under dosed myself--fear of side effects!) so cannot say it did not work.  I have just started on Neurontin.  I have only taken it for 14 days (150 mg. twice a day). I have had wonderful results.  For the first time in a long time_ I feel happy to be alive.  Walking around_ pain free is like being reborn!

740, 1, Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia,So many horrendous side effects.  I believe that this drug was killing me.  I took myself off of it after my dr was non-responsive to alarm of side effects.  This drug effects GABA levels in the brain_ which is responsible for blocking messages to and from the brain.  Too much gaba can be lethal as it can stop the heart from beating--not to mention hindering brain/cognative function.  Takes MONTHS for effects to leave body after last pill consumed.  I was not warned of any of the following problems and was dismissed when talked about them. (By the way_ Panic attacks are not listed on the pharm. insert as a possible side effect.  But I called the manufacturer and spoke to their resident pharmacist and was told that panic attacks are quite common from this med. but they just don't list it on the warning label or side effect list.) I experienced one full blown panic attack.  Very scary_ didn't even know what was happening until I called the manufacturer.  I almost checked myself into a clinic.  Caused distal weakness (hands_ wrists_ feet_ ankles become inanimate and curl up like a quadrapalegic)_ tripping_ inabliity to type_ memory and consciousness greatly affected--a month would go by without being able to know/remember it--like being in a coma but being awake.  Other symptoms:  weight gain_ mood changes_ fear_ stuttering_ sleepiness.  Also_ not told that alcohol would make emotions become volitile-was laughing_ crying and being vicious in short time.  Problems with language_ spelling.  Others_ too--can't remember details.  Almost all functioning_ except for fear and staying alive_ was halted.  My skin looked gorgeous_ however.  That aspect should be isolated and bottled_ if achieved without any effect on the brain.,Took all pain away immediately and completely.  Pain for TN is reportedly the most painful experience to man_ so the pain relief was welcomed.  But tolerance to neurontin developed quickly so needed to up dosages very rapidly to prevent breakthrough pain_ and the side effects were murderous.  This med should only be prescribed if one is low on gaba--otherwise it causes great functional problems.,F,35,3  months,4/18/2005,Neurontin
