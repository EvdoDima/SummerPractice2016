0, 4, AF_vtach,hyper thyroid after 2 yrs of taking years ago -17 I CD shocks so I stopped it.,Now few yrs later started again since all other  meds ( sotalol _carvediliol etc did not worked.-no choice_if I get hyper thyroid I will remove it and wait for the heart transplant  in he future if I am lucky enough.At least I am not scared  that I drop on the floor every time  I leave my house because of vtach.Too bad I didn't started sooner for the 2nd time because of side effects .Once I got v-tach_dropped on the floor and had an internal bleeding and they had to stop coumadin which I was taking and I got a stroke.Now I can barely walk.So now I really have no choice  but to take it.Just praying that I won't get  Pulmonary fibrosis as a ide effect.in summary grat med even in spite of side effects-it's better to live comfartably few years then to be afraid to leave the house.My advice if u have AF_Vtach and an ICD try meds first  but they don' really work (you keep getting shocks from time to time)  and you take coumadin switch to amioadrone or you may end up having  a stroke like me and lose 50 % of your movement or more.I think it is better to live comforably few yrs while using amiodarone than rely on your family for help after stroke.,M,40,150  days200 1X D,8/20/2011Email,Amiodarone hcl
1, 1, For heart irregularity after AV rep,Itchy painful rash on upper part of my body_ sleeplessness_ short of breath_ digestive upset,"I was given Amiodarone after atrial heart valve replacement (minimally invasive surgery_ which went great).  Because of slight heart irregularity in the hospital I was put on this drug.  Looking back on it_ I think it began to affect me badly from the very beginning.  My skin began to itch and I had sleeping problems before leaving the hospital (6 days).  After I got home the rash and itching increased to the point of misery_ and I got very short of breath and could barely walk across the room.  I alternated between constipation and diarrhea.  I went back to my cardiologist and also my primary care doctor and tried to ask about drug side effects_ but they both blew me off.  Told me my heart was ""fine"" and I had nothing to worry about!  I have fired both of them and found a new doctor who listens to me when I talk about symptoms.  This is a dangerous drug that is prescribed_ in my opinion_ by doctors who have become nothing but money-grubbing drug dealers who don't have time to be real doctors.  At my age_ I don't need that kind of doctor.",F,78,5  months200 mg 2X D,5/19/2011Email,Amiodarone hcl
2, 1, to restore sinus rythm from AF_,After prior fibrillation then mitral valve replacement_I was very ill in hospital - too ill to describe effects. Discharged on 200mg/day.  Temporary loss of sight in L eye a week later->100mg daily for 10 days->I stopped. Gradual recuperation.  Restarted by physician 52 days later over 3 weeks: 600mg->400->200. Very unwell 10 days later_ with all listed adverse effects_ plus AF became flutter_ with declining exercise tolerance + new breathlessness.. Negotiated cessation 3 days later. New cough held at bay with Seretide inhalant.  I was just going downhill. Mental deterioration_ unable to meditate_ or lift depression.,"I note that some have had benefit; but adverse effects must be used as a signal to stop right away.  My main guide to that decision would be ""I feel seriously unwell."" I now have to await the 58 days average for the drug to decline by half in its concentration in my body.",M,79,18  days400mg 3X D,2/18/2010,Amiodarone hcl
3, 1, aortic replace & micro valve repair,shortness of breadth after only slight exertion_ insomnia_ instability and light-headedness when walking or getting up from a chair_ general weakness,this drug is too dangerous to take for the modest benefits I might experience since I have no irregular heart beat after my surgery. After my surgery_ I have no AR and hence no need for this med; So_ I experience many side-effects but  benefits.,M,86,3  months,11/21/2009Email,Amiodarone hcl
4, 2, A-fib after open heart surgery,"Was put on 400 mg of amiodarone once the a-fib developed. Stayed on it for 5 1/2  months until insisted I be taken off. During that period I lost most of my hair_ developed numbness of tongue_ couldn't eat_ lost 35 pounds_had horrible cough_great fatigue_ liver elevated enzymes_ constantly tested for thyroid problems due to elevated blood tests_ eyes were blurred all the time. I'm sure if I checked back into my medical records could find more problems from this drug____seems I had most of the ones always listed as ""possible"".........",I think the drug works but would never go on again unless it was the last option. I was never offered other drugs to try first to regulate heart rhythm. If someone takes would recommend working closely with doctor in regards to side effects. Also read up as much as possible to know what to look for. I also had a pulmonologist who hated this drug and was always telling me what to look for as he had lost patients who used it. Frequent chest x-rays are a necessity.,F,72,5  months,6/26/2008,Amiodarone hcl
5, 2, irregular heart rtythm,had open heart surgery. Was on amiodarone_ caused thyroid toxicity_ was a drug of choice.  Defibrillator fired 9 or 10 shocks_ 45 days later after surgery.  Another series of shocks_ 18_ 60 days later.,"Upset my thyroid gland_ weight lost_ felt very ""OLD"".  They were planning on removing the thyroid gland_ but choose to stop the medication instead_ takes 290 days to leave ones body.  Feeling NORMAL again_ 4yrs ago",,55,1  years,7/5/2007,Amiodarone hcl
6, 1, atrial fibrillation,"This drug caused hypothyroidism first in my 70 year old father. Then_ after being on it for about a year_ he developed lung problems. At first_ no one related these to his amiodarone use_ although he would get better once he was started on steroids. Finally_ he was hospitalized at another facility for ""pneumonia"" but they also stopped his amiodarone. In 6 weeks_ after much testing_ biopsies_ cultures (all negative) and consults with many specialists_ he was dead. Diagnosis on his death certificate? Pulmonary fibrosis secondary to amiodarone toxicity.",This drug is NOT even FDA approved for atrial arrhythmias_ only life-threatening ventricular ones. It does work against atrial fib but at what cost??? My father would have been much better off in rate controlled atrial fib than in sinus rhythm because he was on amiodarone. If you do take amiodarone_ READ THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY AND DEMAND FREQUENT PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTING!!! Also_ be aware this drug can remain in your body for anywhere from 20 to 180 days once you have STOPPED taking it!! Be aware and don't let what happened to my father happen to you!!!,M,,1  years,6/7/2007Email,Amiodarone hcl
7, 1, long term atrial fibrillation/flutt,After 1 mo on low dose amiodarone_ I ended up im emergency room for respiratory distress from lungs filling with fluid.  This was with a structurally normal heart and no heart diagnosis other than long standing atrial fibrillation.  I was having a toxic reaction from amiodarone which causes pulmonary fibrosis.  Amiodarone was immediately dropped_ and only a beta blocker was used for the run-away constant fibrillation.  The acute toxic effect of amiodarone left_ but progressive fibrosis continued.  Complete workups of the fibrosis have now been completed in two medical centers that specialize in this type of lung disease.  There are no treatments known but I'm on an experimental drug that costs 60K/yr out of pocket (because insurance does not cover rare disease).  This treatment appears to slowed down the progression_ and I still have 30% lung function_ which nonetheless is quite debilitating.  I'm on supplemental oxygen day and night. My life expectancy is less than three years.,Please do not take this dangerous drug.  During my workups I learned that the university docs do not use this drug at all because of its dangers.  The accepted standard of treating chronic atrial fibrillation is beta blockers to slow the pulse rate _ and the use of the anticoagulant Coumadin_ which I monitor at home because of doctor shortage here.,F,72,1  months,10/5/2006,Amiodarone hcl
