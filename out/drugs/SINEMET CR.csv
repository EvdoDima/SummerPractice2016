2, 4, Parkinsons - right hand tremor,Hard to attribute side effects to any one medicine since I am medicated for diabetes_ Congestive Heart Disease_ Severe Anemia of unknown cause_ as well as Parkinsons.  I am having swelling and weight gain_ and I sleep more than 8 hours each day_ but these could be caused by several meds.,When it wears off_ the tremor returns_ so I think it's helping.My Neurologist has suggested I change to Requip or Mirpex.  I don't want to do this since both have swelling_ weight gain_ and sleepiness_ as common side effects.  I don't need any more of any of those.,F,66,3  years,11/30/2005,Sinemet cr
3, 4, Parkinson's disease,"this medication I will describe as a double edged golden sword_for the patients_ it is not a cure it is a ""TREATMENT"" - I have been treated for this freakin disease for over 10 years_I have been appreciative for this treatment because the Pharmas own the FDA and they won't allow us ""a cure!""but then again - I'm an idealistic thinker_ and this world is not an ideal place/utopia? yet it could be a helluvalot kinder...sincerely_lavendera pd patient -stuck in treatment land!",it needs to be taken in the smallest doses that help because it is likely to cause us great harm in the long run...so we must - make others aware of this fact!,F,42,6  years,10/31/2005Email,Sinemet cr
