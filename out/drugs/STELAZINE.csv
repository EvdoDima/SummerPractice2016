2, 4, paranoid psychosis and anxiety,Dizzy when going from 2 to 4 mg. At 4 mg very lethargic + hard to wake up. Withdrawel difficult.,Please be careful_ this drug works_ it stopped me from obsessive paranoid thoughts and I could concentrate more and felt lighter. However I came off and have had muscle twitching ever since. It's unclear if this is tardive dyskinesia or psychogenic_ but it's very distressing_ particularly not knowing how it may develop. It has reduced me to tears and depression at the prospect of TD fully developing. When withdrawing I experienced tremors + an inability to control my body temperature. Also a feeling of disassociation + suicidal ideas. If the side effects weren't so serious I'd use it again but it's a strong drug and there's no way of guaranteeing whether you get these or not.,F,40,1  years1-4 mg,4/25/2015,Stelazine
3, 3, Bipolar with voices,Weight gain of 50+ pounds in one year,Stelazine works well to eliminate the voices.  It doesn't get rid of them all_ but it does its job.  The weight gain is a problem though as I've gone from around 200lbs to to 260 in one year.  No other side effects so far.,M,33,1.5  years15 mg 1X D,12/23/2013,Stelazine
4, 5, ,Differs when taken with other meds and the amount taken.  Tardif Dyscanisia isn't really a problem at low doses.,Please give it considerable thought when giving up this med.   The new anti-psychotics aren't much better.   If you are having problems with this medication consider reducing it to 1 or 2 mg  then adding another anti-psychotic.  This medication significantly reduces anxiety and especially so when another anti-anxiety drug such as ativan or buspar is added.   Other: doesn't cause you to eat more and helps a bit with sleeping.  In summary if you are having problems with this med_ try cutting down to 1 or 2mg a day and adding another anti-psychotic (not risperdal or zyprexa).,M,52,20  years 1X D,5/26/2012,Stelazine
5, 1, schizophrenia to manic depression,took all during pregnancy_ felt little movement_ twins_ one born unattended_ nurse told me child was dead_ wasn't but gave other away.  stelazine caused poor judgement,it's blue color made it easy for someone to slip a stronger drug with horrible side effects,F,30,12  months 1X D,8/19/2011Email,Stelazine
6, 5, anxiety_ lethargic,none,Stelazine 2mg every other day for the first 20 years saved my life.  Stelazine gave me energy_ control on my life.  The effect started deminishing over the years. It got really bad when the name brand Stelazine was no longer available.  I am now taking 2 mg a day with no relief from whatever I have_ anxiety_ or whatever_ makes my body want to shut down!  When I try to give stelazine up I become so lethargic I can't function.  I was able to work at a very responsible job until retirement age_ thanks to Stelazine.  I wish someone would come out with something new that really works as well as Stelazine_ in brand name form only.  I have tried most of the newer SRI whatevers and they don't work!,F,67,40  years2mg 1X O,7/14/2010,Stelazine
7, 3, Anxiety/Schitzophrenia,Paranoia_ sleepiness_ sedation_ feelings of retribution_ antisocial,"After having been on Stelazine & the generic version (the Brand version was no longer available in USA as of 2003)_ I have mixed opinions.  First_ I was extremely successful in my career of Computer Programming.  I was able to concentrate better on the combo of this drug along with Buspar.  I was eating healthy foods and vegtables.  I wasn't eating too much junk foods and was able to keep up a consistant excercise routine (Jogging).  The ""tardif"" side effect is ""overblown"".  The drug does make you feel weird_ antisocial and negative at times.  Feelingsof retribution sometimes occur.  Otherwise_ this is a superdrug that is ""seemingly superb"" at better controlling anxietyand the abilitiy to concentrate.  I just wish the Smith Klinedrug company would come out with something better.",M,49,20  years,12/24/2008,Stelazine
8, 4, anxiety,No side effects,1mg twice a day to start with then 1mg once a day for the last few months. I really notice the difference if I miss a few doses and frankly it seems to make me a much nicer person.,M,37,9  months,11/18/2008,Stelazine
9, 1," Anxiety/""psyhotic episode""",Extreme lethargy_ mental slowness_ inability to concentrate even in a normal conversation,"I was given this drug when I was 15 amid general turbulence in my home life_ which made me extremely anxious - constant panic attacks_ nightmares_ etc. The shrinks gave me this medicine_ wrongly claiming that I was having a psychotic episode. The drug effectively closed me down as a person - people would even comment that I wasn't concentrating and my speech was slow and slurred. No-one would accept that having a violent step-father who raped his daughter could have had an impact on my mental state - instead they said it was hormonal or some other nonsense. After he left_ the symptoms magically disappeared_ I came off the drug and never saw a shrink after then_ although sometimes I still suffer anxiety (which is very occasionally controlled through diazapam). It was a case of medical negligence on top of child abuse_ although ""paranoid schizophrenic"" remains on my medical record. This drug may be very good for people with genuine problems with schizophrenia_ but isn't any use",M,33,1  years,9/27/2008,Stelazine
10, 5, psychotic episodes_ voices,none,Have taken 10 mg daily for 11 years now. Am worried about tardive dyskenesia (don't have it yet though) and brain atrophy (frontal lobes). Would like to come off it or reduce it_ but would only do that very gradually as I don't want a relapse.  I would be interested to hear whether people think 10 mg daily is a low dose or not.,F,53,11  years,6/18/2007,Stelazine
11, 5, schizophrenia/psychotic episode,At first_ within five days of going on the Stela_ I had orthostatic hypotension (got dizzy when I tried to stand up).  That went away immediately.  I gained 20 lbs._ not sure if it was because of the Stela_ but through a wholesale lifestyle change including diet and behavior and exercise_ lost the weight and haven't gained it back.,After 20 years on the Stela_ I'm still fatigued in the mornings and can barely get out of bed some days_ but I have a flexible work schedule.  The generic version of Stelazine I've taken since 1987_ except for four months in 1992_ and after this drug holiday I relapsed and was hospitalized for two weeks.  So I'm going on 20 years in recovery from schizophrenia_ I have no symptoms_ work full-time_ and have a masters degree that eneables me to have a career I love.  I still have my mental clarity_ photographic memory and sharp intelligence.  It's too bad everyone raves almost exclusively about the atypicals_ because Stelazine gave me my life back with minimal side effects.  The one thing to note is that while on the Stela_ you could be sensitive to extreme heat and light_ so no direct sunlight in hot summer weather for more than 10 minutes for me!Otherwise_ I love this drug!,F,42,20  years,1/30/2007,Stelazine
12, 5, paranoid phycosis and,amphetamine phycosis..  this drug never gave me any side affects apart from giveing me life.,was on it for 10 years 20mg night_ came off amphetamine then 3 years later came off stelazine___then had another break down 5 months after comeing off it___now im suffering from chronic sleep deprivation leading to paraniod phycosis__still trying every med to get back to normal___its been 5 years now____dont see much hope,M,37,10  years,1/17/2007,Stelazine

14, 5, voices_ persecusion_ high anxiety,* felt like I needed an hour more of sleep* slightly less attentive* dry mouth,"Years ago I was a poison victim and suffered a deep chronic psychosis.  If I hadn't had a family I would have needed hospitalization.Stelazine didn't seem to do anything positive at first: it isnt's a happy pill.After a few months: no voices at all ! :)After several months I was happy and so friendy and would go up to anyone and chat out in public.I was very happy and everything in my life came together.Now_ 10 years later_ I'm gettin a lower dosage refill.  I won't try a ""new drug"" because I know stelazine cures me.Stelazine is a wonder cure if you have the disease it's meant for - if your doctor has diagnosed you correctly.Historicaly: stelazine is know as the first psychiatric drug.  It let tens of thousands of people out of mental hospitals and is highly acclaimed still.",M,,1  years,3/20/2006,Stelazine
15, 4, Schizophrenia,Made me sleep.  Brand name Stelazine_ no longer available in this country since 2003 USA_ worked well.  I worked_ raised 2 kids and went to school.
