2, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis_ polymyositis,Side effects small- worth the infusion!! Decreased taste of food_ slight insomnia_ did notice slight difference in heart rate.,I was out if my medication called ACTHar for 4 weeks and my body felt as if it were shutting down (extreme fatigue_ extreme joint pain and ability to use joints_ muscle pain_ bone pain). I use this medication for both my psoriatic arthritis and polymyositis but it also replaces a hormone I am lacking called ACTH due to me having pituitary deficiency from a pituitary microadenoma and empty sella syndrome. Anyways_ after being without this medication for so long_ I requested to have a solumedrol infusion 1000 mg X3 doses. Within 1 day I was able to bounce back from my adrenal crisis (normally I am down for at least 4 days)_ I could walk again_ had energy_ and WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO FUNCTION AGAIN!! U have no clue how much of a difference it made and I think the slight side effects are worth being able to actually be a mom and wife again by being able to do more than 2 ADL's a day (before my infusion).,F,32,1  days1000 mg,5/10/2016Email,Solu-medrol

I now take supplements and eat lots of bananas after a treatment.,This medication has help me immensely.  I have used it in the times when my other medications have failed and a new medication has not started working yet.  When I have taken this I have been in such bad shape that I cannot walk or move much before the treatment.  Within a few days after_ I am much better.

13, 5, MS transitioning into progressive,SwellingHeadache,I've used solumedrol several times over the 12 yrs I've had RRMS and now that I'm transitioning into secondary progressive MS_ my neuro is trying to get me out of a progressive worsening of my symptoms so she took a BIG swing at it with a high dose of IV solumedrol. I normally receive a much lower dose but ironically_ I had LESS side effects than the 8 times I had to have an infusion the 2 yrs after I had my son in 2007. My MS was so active and I had a newborn so I was trying everything I could to stay mobile. I did thank God & I still am mobile_ but it's been 5 yrs since my previous infusion bc my body just could not tolerate it anymore. Moral of my story - IT WORKS! My experience with it is you experience more side effects your 1st infusion and if you do them too often. With all the IV solumedrol I received just 2 weeks ago_ i had a little swelling in my chest of all places and a small headache_ both of which were gone 3 days after treatment. If you have MS_ until they find a cure_ it's a necessary evil.,F,45,3  days1 gram,12/2/2014,Solu-medrol

After researching this page I found if I slow it down it would help. So on day 2 and 3 I requested to move it to 90 min - that helped.  The nausea whet away on these days too_ but the slight headache never did. On day 2 and 3 I could not sleep. I did take Nyquil which seemed to help.  I am on day 4 and feeling a bit better.

44, 4, mixed connective tissue disease,metallic taste in mouth_ flushed face and hot flashes_ hyperactivity day of treatment_ restlessness night of treatment_ body aches day of treatment_weight gain and inability to lose weight_ abdominal bloating and gas,Compared to Prednisone_ Solu-Medrol is a gift.  I didn't end up with 'moon face' or the sharp mood swings / aggressiveness that I experienced on Prednisone.  And as weird as this sounds_ when I was taking Prednisone (a pill)_ I felt like there was poison running through my veins; I don't have that feeling with Solu-Medrol (which is truly running through my veins). I was on Solu-Medrol for three years_ tried to go off of it_ and now_ three months later_ I have to go back on it.  It is inconvenient to have to go to a clinic and have a nurse set everything up_ poke a vein once a week_ miss time from work etc...._ but the relief it provides me is worth it.  Like any medication out there_ there are always risks associated with taking it.  Before starting it_ patients should ask lots of questions_ research articles online etc....  As with any corticosteroid_ be sure your doctor also gives you a prescription for calcium with vitamin D - like Fosamax_ which can also be purchased in generic form.  It's very important since cortisone eats away at your bones.   Try to get your clinic appointments in the morning so that you can burn off some of the 'energy' during the day. This will suppress your immune system - try to stay away from people with colds_ flus_ etc....  A Medic-Alert bracelet is a good idea in case you are ever incapacitated.  The fee is minimal and worth the information it will provide health givers in an emergency.  Anyone with a serious illness should have one.,F,38,3  years,7/25/2009,Solu-medrol
45, 3, Newly Diagnosed MS,I experienced a bad taste in my mouth during the treatment.I felt the alertness (not Hyperness) about 5 minutes into the treatment. My muscles in my legs ached later each of treatmnent but was easily resolved with some bananas. My face cleared up but my neck_ back and chest sufffered mildly. 1g X 3,I was lucky to take the advice that was given by other patients from this site. For heart burn that sometimes happen a prilosec OTC pill helps if you take it 1.5 hours before each time before treatment if your doctor allows. Caramal and Chocalate parfait nips candies are really good to suck on during treatment to curb the bad taste. Tums also helps with breakthrough heartburn and can be taken with the prilosec_with your docotors approval. Doing the treatment 1st thing in the morning helps with the potential for sleep problems  at night for the duration of the treatment. You should check with your doctor if you are concerned about to much hyperness as a result of the steroid and he might be able give you something to help you. I was fortunate to have xanax prescribed for me by my Doctor and it helped. The best advice is to know your body and to ask questions about this medication and what you can look for in side effects. Everyone is so different. I was able to have an experience that was not unbearable. GOOD LUCK,F,32,3  days,7/11/2009,Solu-medrol

47, 4, MS exacerbation,Side effects totally different with each round (totaling 15 rounds for past 10 years.) If there's a side effect_ I have had it...but not all with every round. Worst ever was SEVERE heartburn (2x) & extreme Psychosis (1x) & I can handle the rest. I did swear for awhile after the psychosis I would NEVER do again but I did after a 3yr break. But I have  lost weight/gained weight...swelled badly/no swelling...insomnia/can't stay awake...high blood sugar/normal sugars.  I always have SEVERE neck/back pain along with sudden drop in blood pressure if I don't taper (won't make that mistake EVER again!!,"It seemed to have the most positive/immediate results with the initial doses 10yrs ago (and they are ALWAYS 5 days + taper.) I think your body gets ""used"" to it and mine just reacts so differently every time...I never know what to expect but i am aware of all the things that COULD happen and knowledge of all of these possible side effects is the key.  Always be aware of any changes going on and tell your Dr. immediately...even if you think it's minor.  He can't do anything or make changes if he isn't aware of it!! Remember...YOU are your best advocate!!",M,37,5  days,5/7/2009Email,Solu-medrol
48, 5, MS Exacerbation,Slight headache_ metalic taste within 15 minutes of IV start_ lights appear brighter_ lots of energy,This is my 3rd round of Solu-Medro-1 gram IV for 3 days for MS exacerbations.  Although the side effects are not pleasant_ the end results are worth it.  No more pain in joints_ hands_ feet or legs.  All three times I've taken the IV's I have LOST WEIGHT because my appetite just goes away...I count myself one of the lucky ones!  I take 2 Prylosec at least 1 hour prior to start of IV to prevent heartburn and it works_ I highly recommend doing this.  About the only this that does not have a severe metal taste is Orange Sherbert. I also suck on Carmel Nips to cut down the metal taste.  I do get extremely thirsty and urinate frequently_ but this only lasts for 3 or 4 days.  If you can tolerate Solu-Medrol IV_ I highly recommend.  Although it's not the most pleasant experience_ it does calm the inflammation.,F,56,3  days,3/9/2009Email,Solu-medrol

50, 4, Transverse Myelitis,Worked VERY well for me_ but the second three day dosing I had brought my pulse down to 49. Eat potassium rich foods and monitor your pulse. Don't leave the IV room without making sure you get a pulse reading_ which they are supposed to do anyway. In the room I had 51 and the nurse thought that was great. It was not.,EAT potassium rich foods. that is what I want to get across to y'all! (I had two three day dosing IVs_ two months apart for different TM episodes.),F,50,3  days,10/6/2008Email,Solu-medrol

53, 1, MS flare-up,stroke_ high blood pressure,I would strongly recommend anyone taking this drug to do so very cautiously.  My Dr. put me on IV Solu-Medrol about once a year for MS flare-ups.  She gave me 1 round followed by another 6 weeks later and that's when I had a stroke.  I have NO history of high blood pressue and my bp is normal now.  After being in the ICU for 5 days_ I was hospitalized for 3+ weeks_ used a wheel chair_ couldn't talk and loss the use of my right arm/hand.  After lots of therapy_ I can now walk using a cane_ my speech is 80% normal and my arm/hand is 5% normal.  I would take my MS symptoms any day over this!

55, 5, OPTIC NEURITIS,VERY BITTER TAST DURING AND UP TO 7 HOURS AFTER INFUSION_ I FOUND HAVING A HARD CANDY (I.E. JOLLY RANCHERS) DURING THE INFUSION HELPED SOME. DO NOT DRINK MILK AFTER_ I LOVE MILK BUT THE MEDS MAKE IT TASTE NASTY!!,WORTH ANY DISCOMFORT. I HAD 1 GRAM DAILY (BY INFUSION) FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN TAPERED ORALLY. I HAD TOTAL LOSS OF VISION IN MY RIGHT EYE. THIS STARTED TO SUBSIDE WITHING IN 5 DAYS. WITHIN ONE WEEK I COULD SEE AGAIN AFTER 2 MONTHS OF VISION LOSS!!!! I WAS LEARY_ BUT NOW I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS TREATMENT!!!,F,33,3  days,3/26/2008,Solu-medrol
56, 2, Angioedema caused by allergy to ?,One time IV dose - no side effects noted_ other than tired and a slight metallic taste for a short time. Oral dosing started same day_ and noticed within hours increased appetite_ muscle pain (mostly in my legs)_ irritability/anger. Stopped taking on day 2 because my symptoms had resolved and side effects were outweighing the benefits of drug (what little there were). Also on both Benadryl 4x day_ Singulair 1x day and Prilosec (all histamine blockers). Swelling has nearly completely resolved after ~24 hours from onset.,I'm sure this drug helps alot of people_ and the side effects are worth the benefit they receive from the Solumedrol (such as people with MS). But if I experience this event again_ I will probably refuse the steroid. Not effective for me_ I believe.,F,37,2  days,3/10/2008,Solu-medrol

Bloating in my belly_ felt like 6 months pregnant but no pain.,got IV 1000MG a day for 3days.  My vision was back about 50% next morning after first day.  Drink LOTS of water with lemon when on this and you won't have too much bloating. I drank a ton of water after first morning and the bloating reduced alot.

Try eating saltine crackers as soon as bad taste starts_ seems to reduce the bad taste.Frequent urination_every 20 minutes the first night.  Exhausted. Body aches.,It helped the first day.

I also suffered shortness of breath associated with intersticial lung disease.

After first few days_ I feel like a new person and wonder why I waited so long.  Symptoms this time for me were banding around the mid section(felt like Scarlett in Gone With The Wind getting that petticoat tightened by Mamie)_ left eye felt like bugging out of head (have had iritis_ optic neuritis_ felt like Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein) and the bottom of my feet felt like they were getting beaten with sledge hammers.  I think it is good idea to express self in laymen's terms so everyone else can understand or get better idea of what us MS people go thru.  Best advice is eat healthy_ watch carbs_ watch salt_ lots of water to flush out system_ load up potassium.  As far as I am concerned_ it is worth the horrible side effects.  And to think that people take this crap on purpose at times_ makes you wonder!  Or to know that a drug",F,45,18  days,5/2/2007Email,Solu-medrol

67, 5, MS exacerbation,I wanted to post here because I wish I did not read what was on this site as I was doing my IV. It works and frankly if you do right by your body (such as eating properly and good supplements) you will do well.,So here has been my experience: 5 days/lower dose - 500mg/IV.I didn't know immediately I was having an exacerbation so this whole process took about 2 months. When I had double vision in my eyes_ I immediately did the IV.The IV is not too painful at all. Go slow. I did an hour drip (when I went faster it hurt a little). Eat bananas. We lose potassium. Take good supplements (multi_ C_ E_ Flaxseed_ Grapeseed extract_ turmeric). Eat as much whole foods as you can.Get some meds to help with muscle tightening after we detox for a few days off the drugs. Always talk to nurses_ they know how patients really feel.Don't wait and don't be afraid. I'm so glad my eyes are coming back. After five days_ I dramatically improved.,F,40,5  days,11/16/2006Email,Solu-medrol
