As a result_ excess progesterone and eccessive weight gain weekly! Diet never changed_ this is noticable daily weight gain. I'm still not back to normal. System is messed up!

8, 1, sinus infection,Extreme nausea and digestive issues.,I just left my doctor (he did not prescribe the Augmentin.)  I have been nauseous_ with terrible digestive issues for 3 weeks since finishing the Augmentin. He believes this antibiotic damaged my stomach.  He put me on probiotics and a diet to help my stomach heal.  Do not take this stuff - I honestly thought I was dying.,F,57,7  days125 MG 2X D,12/17/2013Email,Augmentin '250'
9, 4, Severe infections,Diarrhea; fatigue; abdominal discomfort; gas; occasional nausea,This is a harsh antibiotic that needs to be supplemented with probiotics to protect GI health. However_ without it I could've suffered permanent hearing loss. I developed an aggressive infection that caused perforation in both of my eardrums. A weaker antibiotic might not have stopped the infection before it had a chance to do more damage. Just make sure you take probiotics to replenish the healthy bacteria in your gut.,F,19,10  days 2X D,10/25/2013,Augmentin '250'
10, 4, Sinus Infection,Rather deep neck and shoulder pain; minor nausea,Nausea doesn't happen if I take on a full stomach_ but the pain only seems to get better the more water I drink.  Could the pain be from a form of dehydration?,F,47,10  days 2X D,8/24/2012Email,Augmentin '250'
11, 4, Boil/Abscess Post Lancing,"Abdominal pain_ right upper quadrant pain (gallbladder area)_ Indigestion/heartburn immediately after swallowing it (have to take liquid form because of dysphagia) loose stools_ increased appetite_ irritable_ frontal headaches and sinus pressure/pain_ I have Tourette Syndrome and it's increasing my tics_ some itching/rashes_ hard to walk (legs feel like they are made of led!) but it's working. I had a huge boil under my armpit that had to be drained (lanced) and packed with gauze and I was put on this to make sure it didn't get reinfected. Whenever I eat_ smoke_ drink etc_ my tongue and mouth burns like it's on fire. I was told by the pharmacist ""dyspepsia"" is a side effect. It's doing the job but it's been rough at times_ though not as rough as last time I was on it since this time I make sure I take it WITH FOOD!",Worked for the infection (so far)_ NASTY taste when taking the liquid form. Chalky_ gritty_ crunchy_ awful taste.,M,27,10  days10 ML 3X D,3/26/2012Email,Augmentin '250'
12, 5, Bronchitis (actually took 500mg),Brief nausea occassionally. Nothing I couldn't handle. I am allergic to tons of meds and very sensitive to others. I had no problems with this one.,Not only cured the bronchitis_ but also cleared a UTI.,F,60,10  days500 mg 2X D,12/15/2011,Augmentin '250'
13, 1, UTI,UNBELIEVABLE anxiety_ Depression so bad that I felt like I was the only one in the world without even a rock to talk to. Obsessive Compulsive behavior (repeatedly checked myself for some disease) Depersonalization and Derealization. If i looked into a mirror i NEARLY did not recognize myself even though i knew it was me. The same goes for when I looked at my mom. Crying uncontrollably. Mood swings from being extremely depressed to content and within minutes_ it repeated_ and it did this ALL DAY for a month until i sought psychological medications. This medication nearly made me drive my parents car into a telephone pole when I stormed out of the house bc they couldnt understand what I was going through and this med was driving me nearly insane!!!!,Please_ I am warning you. This medication is not even worth trying to see if it cures or fixes your ailments. It has been 4 years since I took this medication and I am still fighting depression and anxiety and some depersonalization/derealization OCD issues. This medication ruined family relationships_ lost the love of my life_ lost my career with law enforcement. This medication is 110% POISON and let us all here and now for-warn you; DO NOT TAKE THIS. ASK FOR SOMETHING ELSE! Dont be sorry! GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL!,M,25,7  days25mg 1X D,9/19/2011Email,Augmentin '250'
14, 4, Bladder Infection,Moderate diarrhea about an hour after taking each pill even if taken with food and a full glass of water.  Black hairy tongue.  Great relief from bladder infection felt after one day.,The Augmentin probably caused a worsening of my gastritis symptoms which caused the diarrhea to be so bad.  I guess the black hairy tongue is an adverse reaction but nothing to worry about (an overgrowth of bacteria).,F,44,10  days500-125 3X D,8/7/2011Email,Augmentin '250'
15, 2, ear infection,Started taking Augmentin for an ear infection and had no side effects until the last day taking this drug_ I then began to experience severe itching and nausea. The nausea has subsided but the itching has persisted. I went back to the doctor to find out what was going on with me_ she had really no explanation and gave me an anti itch cream and Claratin for daytime (they dont work) and 1/2 a tablet of Hydroxyzine_ which works but I can only take it at night. If it were not for this constant itching_ I would have only had the one time issue with diarrhea_ which was remedied by taking Augmentin on a full stomach as reccommended. I am now taking probiotics on my own to see if that will help with the constant itching,,F,39,8  days 2X D,6/26/2011Email,Augmentin '250'
16, 1, sinus infection,This medicine has been awful -- took one with food last night at about 6 PM. By 9 PM my head was over the toilet_ had to sleep on the bathroom floor as I needed to be able to vomit in 15 minute intervals (whether there was anything really left to throw up or not) until about 3 AM. It was at about 5 AM that the diarrhea started. All I could do today was sleep -- muscle aches and stomach was still lurching. I'm glad some people have been helped by this drug but I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital I felt so bad. Not sure I'll even be ready to go back to work tomorrow_ still feel awful. The sinus infection causes headaches and am still coughing crap up from the drainage but would much rather have those symptoms than feel like my innards have been nuked!,,F,53,1  days30 2X D,3/9/2011Email,Augmentin '250'

19, 2, bronchitis,Queasiness_ drowsiness_ confusion_ weight gain_ constantly tired_ loose stool_ anxiety_ slight neck pain.,It cleared up my bronchitis in 3 days_ so that was good.  But the side effects were very unpleasant.  I've been sleeping 12 hours a day_ and eating a lot of food with the HUGE pill to combat the gastrointestinal side effects_ as my doctor recommended doing so.  I can handle the queasiness_ but not coupled with grogginess and excessive sleeping. I had enough and stopped taking it after the 7th day (prescribed 10 day cycle).,M,28,7  days875 MG 2X D,5/3/2010,Augmentin '250'
20, 4, Diverticulitis,None_ or at least none compared to some of the other truly vile antibiotics I've been given for this (flagyl and ciprofloxacin).   Compared to those_ augmentin is a walk in the park.  I'm very happy with it.,,F,59,4  days 2X D,4/6/2010,Augmentin '250'
21, 2, Inner Ear Infection,Upset stomach chronic joint pain in both feet and knee all day and night can barely walk,Have had amoxicillin before (you need to take pro biotic yogurt)However I believe the issue in most cases like me is an allergic reaction to the Clavulanic acid,M,44,7  days,8/29/2009,Augmentin '250'

27, 1, Skin Staph Infection,The first pill was no problem. After taking the second dose I became dizzy_ my skin started turning red_ itchy_ hives_ etc... very bad! Turns out I was allergic (not to the amoxicillin but the clavomax). D/C and began course of other antibiotics (erythromycin) and benadryl! That did the trick_ but the effects from the allergic reaction lasted for weeks. I was a zombie_ and my skin peeled starting from my finger and toe nails and ending after a week with my knees/elbows. just like pulling a glove off backwards!,Be wary of allergies_ make sure that you take the second dose during the day_ don't go to bed until you've cleared the 3rd dose! Your body has to be exposed once_ then the reaction will come after second exposure! I still can take amoxicillin all by itself_ and I'm glad of that!,F,34,1  days,10/16/2007,Augmentin '250'
28, 1, possible strep,My doctor suspected I had strep: rash on my face_ fever_ swollen lymph nodes. I took 2 augmentin one in the morning one at night. I had a very peculiar burning sensation in my stomach all night and didn't sleep well. I was shocked the next morning when I looked in the mirror: one eye was almost swollen shut and the rash was much more pronounced and itchy,My doctor told me to stop taking augmentin and put me on zithromax,F,54,1  days,2/6/2007,Augmentin '250'
