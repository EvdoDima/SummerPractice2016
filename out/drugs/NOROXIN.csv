5, 1, cystitis,Random tics and twitches_ severe muscle pain in calves_ tendon pain in Achilles_ knees_ wrists_ arches of feet_ toes_ hands and back of neck; pain around right shoulder-blade. Fore-arms almos numb and tingling_ hands and arms won't obey me - they don't move_ then suddenly jump. Think I've had petit mal fits but not sure. Feel compleetly depersonalised_ as though I don't really exist_ as though am just an alien or automaton; don't care at all about anything_ but that's better than the violent_ suicidal despair that overcame me for the first two weeks days of this. Very weak - can't walk more than a few yards and too tired and dead-feeling to want to try. Stomach pains and first extreme constipation_ now gurgling and indigestion. Head feels as though I've been shot. Can't remember things. Very dizzy - fall over when standing_ feels as though the world's turned upside down. Slight kidney pain. Have lost sense of taste and smell_ exceot for the metallic taste from the drug. Sight has gone,This drug and others like it should only be used as a last resort and with special permission. They are too dangerous for too many people.,F,62,6  days,8/2/2009Email,Noroxin
