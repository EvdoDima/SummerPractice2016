0, 2, Pituitary Gland Tumor,Fatigue_ Severe irritability_ nausea_ dizziness when standing up_ intolerance to alcohol_ some constipation_ gas if taken exactly with a meal (best to give food time to digest a bit) huge drop in motivation to do anything. All I feel like doing is laying in bed all day_ but without sleeping because it also makes me restless. I toss and turn all night and feel like a sick old lady the next day. I have a 5 and 6 year old and Im starting to feel like this medicine is just taking the life out of me. I feel almost depressed. I know that health wize I need it to shrink or keep my tumor from growing_ but I sometimes think that Id rather produce milk and deal with slight headaches. At least the symptoms of my prolactoma don't make me feel the way Bromocriptine does. Also I had a much higher sex drive before I started taking this medicine.,I will try to wait out the storm and see if the side effects subside_ however I know I will discontinue if they do not. I cannot live my life tied down by a medicine that makes me feel like I'm dying.,F,27,1  months2.5,1/8/2015,Bromocriptine mesylate
