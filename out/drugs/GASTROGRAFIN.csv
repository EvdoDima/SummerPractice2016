2, 5, Prior to abdominal/pelvic CT scan.,Bad diarrhea_ but still tolerable.,I found this MUCH better to take than the barium normally used. Barium gives me severe constipation and abdominal pain. Much rather have diarrhea. You really need to drink a lot of fluids after this so you don't get dehydrated from the diarrhea. The dehydration is what can cause other problems such as headache_ dizziness_ fast hear rate_ etc.,F,55,  2X D,6/26/2013Email,Gastrografin

About an hour afterwards I began with diarrhea which progressed to extreme nausea and severe headache. Also stomach cramps_ body aches_ and fast heartbeat. These symptoms persisted for 10 hours. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ORAL CONTRAST AGENT FOR ANYONE UNDERGOING ANY TYPE OF X-RAY/CT SCAN_ ETC.,F,49,1  times,8/8/2008,Gastrografin
