1, 4, Restless leg syndrome,None,I replaced Requip_ which had many very unpleasant side effects_ including nausea_ drowsiness and headaches after one glass of wine with dinner. The low dose that I take is effective with no side effects. I recommend trying it for RLS.,M,61,90  days2.5 mg 1X D,9/7/2012Email,Marinol

3, 5, Headache and depression,Depression lifted_ profound spiritual awareness_ mental clarity_ happiness_ less freq of morning headaches_ increased appetite (can be controlled)_ lose train of thought at times_ increased emotional sensitivity_ confusion at times.,"I am taking less indomethacin because of lesser frequency of headaches. Long term use of NSAID meds for pain can be hard on liver and kidneys.  (I am a chronic migraine sufferer with headaches now under control).  Headache and depression are often linked_ and when you treat one_ you treat the other.   Marinol has been very effective in relieving my dysthemia_ (low grade depression) which has had a positive effect on headache frequency.  I am thankful I have two understanding and knowledgeable physicians (headache specialist and family doctor) who are willing to prescribe me this med for ""off label""use.  Its use is strictly controlled (handwritten prescription_ no refills) so there is little potential for abuse.",M,55,60  days5 MG 2X D,5/24/2012Email,Marinol
4, 5, Chronic Pain/Cluster Headaches,"Goofiness_ increased appetite_ improved sleep_ enhanced motivation (oddly enough_ given THC-9's reputation_ but I find myself compelled to cook_ clean_ exercise_ and do all the other chores/errands I typically despise_ as I find almost any activity enjoyable/tolerable)_ improved concentration/mood_ occasional altered consciousness (though this isn't unwelcome_ as my typical consciousness before: ""I'm in so much pain that I wish I was dead_"" becomes ""this is the most fascinating thing I've ever seen_"" even if it would normally bore me). No withdrawal (I've always been tapered off when I suspended therapy)_ no long-term side effects_ unlike opiates_ barbiturates_ benzodiazepines_ ketamine_ NSAIDs_ Tricyclics_ SSRIs_ and anticonvulsant therapies. More effective and much less explosive than oxygen therapy. Didn't improve my appearance nearly as much as the BoTox injections. I am bipolar and it has no adverse effect on psychiatric symptoms other than occasional agorophob","Pain relief is moderate at best_ I typically drop from a 7-9 to a 5-7_ respectively_ but it short-circuits the emotional response and the mental preoccupation with pain_ much like the morphine/dilaudid/fentanyl/etc that I spent many years on and evoked the response ""I'm in pain but I don't care about that or anything else besides ice cream_"" my response to dronabinol was more ""yeah_ I'm in pain_ but why not go for a walk or paint or do something to take the mind off the pain."" Much more consistant effects and much more reliable agency over the effect than with medical marijuana...and much cheaper_ safer_ and more legal (at the federal level)_ especially if_ like me_ you find smoking a medicine somewhat counterproductive and slightly insane. Tolerance does build over time_ and doctors who are comfortable prescribing it (there is a stubborn reluctance_ even among doctors who dispense morphine scripts as if they were napkins) tend to get uneasy about exceeding the recommended antiemetic dosage of 20mg/day. Actual tolerance is difficult to assess because potency degrades quickly_ even if refrigerated and protected from light (as much as is possible)_ so that a 10mg pill is roughly equivalent to a 2.5mg pill by the last day of a 30 day script. The spherical gel caps are superior to the oblong_ made by a different generic manufacturer (as the spheres are actually made by the same facility that produced the brand name for Watson Labs). Much less sedating_ cheaper",M,35,2  years5-10 4X D,1/23/2012,Marinol
5, 4, Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,Sleepiness_ a little bit high.,Was prescribed 13 different antiemetics before this_ and they all had terrible side effects_ and wore off over time. Marinol works about 50% of the time for me_ but it still more effective than everything else I have taken.,F,27,8  months5 1X AN,1/12/2012,Marinol
6, 3, to gain weight,Very Tired_ Laughter_ Outer body experience_ VERY VERY HUNGRY_ sometimes have awful thoughts...,I gained 15 pounds in 15 days_ I wouldn't and couldn't stop eating.  But it would always take almost 4 hours to work...,F,28,5  years5mg 2X D,4/10/2011Email,Marinol
7, 5, ADHD_ Depression,"Very much like the real thing without the smoke.  If you've ever eaten pot brownies it's not unlike that.  Only bad side effect is bit of crash after wears off.  Feel more tired than usual.  Also unwanted weight gain for those of us not looking to bulk up.  Would not recommend it to people who don't like the feeling of being ""enhanced.""  (esp those who hate pot_ obviously)",This scrip has enabled me to get off dexedrine_ prozac_ and ativan.  It energizes me and allows me to move from that dark place to focus on what I need to do_ and with a level of enthusiasm I have a hard time accessing otherwise.,F,45,2  years5 mg 2X D,3/10/2011,Marinol
8, 2, to open up appetite,extremely paranoid_ out of body experience_ fear of dying_ high anxiety,This was recently prescribed to my sister.  She is on Ativan now.,F,47,6  days5 mg 2X D,2/26/2011Email,Marinol
9, 4, Chonic Nausea / adominal pain,Only side effects I have noticed is the hunger you get which I have not felt in many years. Memory loss is the same as with Promethazine.,Doctors prescribed this to get me off the promethazine 25MG that I take 4 to 6 times a day. Marinol 10MG isn't as good as Promethazine_ but it does work and isn't dangerous to take like longterm use of Promethazine. Still to early to tell if this is my savior_ but I will update when more time goes by. I would definitely suggest its use to other people suffering from chronic nausea.,M,41,3  weeks10 MG 3X D,1/24/2011Email,Marinol
10, 5, Adult ADD,The therapeutic window was kind of short... it would be good if there was an extended release version.  Very little negative side effects.  None worth mentioning.   It is hard to obtain and expensive because the insurance companies and doctors don't support it yet.,Doctors are terrified to prescribe even though its less controlled and less addictive than many other ADD meds (Ritalin).  Here are the results: Focuses the mind by reducing stress_ relaxing the breath. Raises awareness and helps to work smart by prioritizing. Helps to focus on doing one thing at a time. A feeling that its healthy and sustainable_ little negative side effects. Better mindset for communicating with people. Feeling of being a human being instead of a robot. Improved mood and interest in life. Non-stimulant awakeness. No racing heart beat.  The coming down side of the curve is not dramatic. This medicine is very subtle_ can be used on the weekends or after work when you don't want stimulants but want to be awake and able to think.,M,33,30  days2.5mg 3X D,10/27/2010Email,Marinol
11, 4, appetite stimulant and anti-nausea,slight mood elevation,Taken by my son during chemotherapy to treat a blood cancer (Hodgkin's Lymphoma). Cyproheptadine was initially prescribed but failed to stimulate appetite and gave him stomach cramps. He dropped from 134 lbs to 113 before getting RX for Marinol. His appetite improved immediately and he has been steadily gaining weight.  He has never smoked the real deal. I like the control over dosing with Marinol vs. inhaling varying amounts. It requires refrigeration which is not always convenient and difficult to secure from my older teenager's friends.,M,14,2  months2.5 mg 2X D,4/26/2010,Marinol
12, 5, Chemo nausea,Works almost as good as pot to alleviate severe nausea. Gives a burned out crashing feeling after several consecutive doses.,,M,46,2  weeks2.5 1X AN,4/10/2010,Marinol
13, 4," Anorexia (NOT ""nervosa"")","Like with ""real deal""_ I get high_ paranoid_ anxious...but HUNGRY (which is why I take it).","I started at a dose of about 5mg_ then slowly upped it to my current 40mg (which seems pretty high_ compared to others) as I developed a tolerance.  I take this (almost) daily_ in the evening_ when I won't have to drive...or function much.  When I get ""'plexed"" (as in ""having a complex"")_ I just take a breath and wait for it to pass.  Won't answer the phone high_ though_ no matter what :)",F,41,1  years40 mg 1X D,3/28/2010,Marinol
14, 5, Back Pain,happyness_ from both the pain relief and the up lifting effect the drug has.  Better eye sight. I went from 20/20 to 20/10 at 37 years old and my family has a history of eye problems short term memory loss,I was badly injured at my job.  It took me a year and a half to walk normaly again and have 24hour pain now 10 years after the accident.  I did not take any perscriptions for my pain for almost 6 years.  I recently (3 years ago) started back on opiods and was given Marinol several months later to counter act the side effects.  I stopped taking the opiods and just kept taking the Marinol.  At 2.5mg I could drive and funtion quite normaly it would lower my daily pain (2 to 5) 2 points_ from 2 to 0 or from a 5 to a 3.  When my pain was up around a 7 a 10mg Marinol would lower it to a 2 but I would not drive on a 10mg dose.  I believe that this should be next to asprin at the super market.  I see a very low chance of abuse (as do most experts) and its only because of this drugs heritage that it is not freely avalable as other perscriptions that are now over the counter.,M,38,3  years,4/29/2009,Marinol
15, 5, many broken vertebra/nerve pain,none,Was great_ relieved pain_ relieved depression/anxiety_ relieved nausea/intestinal pain from that other drugs had given_ could sleep_ gave me back my appetite_ easy to go off with no negatives unlike oxycodone or tramadol (both opiates) did not feel addicted at all.,F,57,3  months,2/17/2009,Marinol
16, 5, Pain,Happy_  lack of pain!,Had self medicated (Pain) for years with nothing but smoking or vapeing green bud. Once I finally went to a pain doctor and in redding the small print in the pain program agreement found that I couldn't self medicate any longer: it would be evident in a random urine screen and I would be kicked out of the program. I stuck with the program through about 25 different combinations and landed on Roxycodone and Methadone along with as-much acetaminophen and naproxen as my liver could  take  This worked  / works for the most part  I worry about my long term exposure too acetaminophen and naproxen_ in everything I have read_ long term (3+ ) years or more experientially raises my chances of dieing of a  hart attack or  liver poisoning.In discussing my findings with my doctor we decided that Marinol would be a good choice to try. I have been on Marinol now for about 8 months and have reduced my usage of Narcotics_ Methadone_ and the other garbage_ as anyone knows who has been on opiates; an,M,35,8  months,1/15/2009Email,Marinol

19, 5, chemo,,it's very pretty - like a little orb and who wouldn't want to swallow a pretty little orb?  i was baked out of my mind for almost 8 hours - but a good baked.  better that the real thing because a) no coughing  b) no one knows that you've taken it because there is no obvious pot smell 3) lasts a very looooooong time and 4) i can't remember the 4th point i was going to make...  i only took 2 doses of this during 18 weeks of chemo and now just have it in case i want to take it for fun!,F,42,2  days,7/8/2007,Marinol
20, 5, early on set Dystonia,none,I love feeling relaxed because Dystonia keeps my muscles all in knots.   before I started Marinol I was in extreme pain from my muscles being in continuous motion and it is like my body could never relax.  My muscles would tighten up on me to the point of a full body charley horse.  The benefits out weigh any feeling of being high at I may experience. Medicaid even covers my monthly prescription.,M,35,4  years,10/30/2006Email,Marinol

I however_ requested it to be upped to 10mg_ which is what I take now_ because I prefer to do so once a day at night. This causes severe personalization. (If you are watching TV_ it gives you the feeling of being in the situation)_ occaisionaly some mild hallucinations_ but a generally good time.

It also makes me not care about anything.  I didn't care about taking my medications.  Someone had to watch me and make sure that I took them.  I let all my work_ housework_ bill paying etc. just go.  I couldn't finish anything that I had started.  So_ I had to get off of it as it would have ruined my life.,M,41,2  months,8/31/2005,Marinol
28, 5, Crohns Disease,NONE.,Used this to justify the Cannabis which shows up in my urine tests.  I take morphine sulfate_ and use Cannabis for nausea and pain.  My doc. does drug test to ensure I am using the morphine.  Cannabis shows up every time_ but doc. understands why_ and has no problem with me using real deal.  Just So Doc. not get in problems with DEA.... Doc scripted this so that it would justify the Cannabis Showing up_ as cannabis is not legal in my state yet.... BOO-HOO.  Would be cool though if it was covered under my prescription insurance_ or could get at pharmacy. Smoke the real thing if you can get it.  Lungs are side effect of smoking_ but it does wonders for us chronic nausea suffers_ and acute pain fighters.  I am able to even put on a few pound from eating much more as a result_ when/if I have some.  Too bad we have to take a real trip to like another country that is_ just to be legal in using it.  Good idea though_ just watch out for the dogs on the way back_ if you light up before you get on the plane home.  Not implying in any way to attempt to bring this back to U.S._ only saying if you smoke one before you get on the plane_ the drug dogs will be all over you.
