2, 1, possible infection,convulsions_ severe nausea_ migrane headache_ severe weakness_ diarrea.,Taking this medicine (along with cipro) was a traumatic experience. I only took it for 3 days and I started going into convulstions.  After that calmed down I was so weak I could hardly move for 3 days_ and the nausea and headaches were unbearable.  What confuses me is when I went to the ER because of these symptoms they told me to keep taking the flagyl and cipro????????  I felt poisoned!!!,F,25,3  days,8/9/2006,Flagyl i.v. rtu in plastic container
