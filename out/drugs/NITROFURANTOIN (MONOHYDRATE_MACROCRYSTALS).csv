1, 3, UTI,2nd day out of 7 drinking this medicine Abdominal cramps that go all the way down my right leg_ burning sensation in my vagina and itching as well headache dizziness feeling weak and upset stomach,,F,29,2  days100,12/2/2015,Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals)
2, 1, UTI,Starting with heartburn in day 2 went on to develop extreme chest pain that worsened rapidly and after calling (non-emergency) medical service was ambulanced to hospital. I had a feeling it was this medicine as I had had a skin rash earlier in the day and have also had heartburn from an antibiotic once before_ but this was like nothing I have ever experienced. ECGs_ blood pressure_ blood tests etc showed no sign of heart problem and pain reduced after painkillers and antacids. Doctors described my symptoms as severe epigastris. 24 hours later I am still quite poorly_ in pain and discomfort_ cannot lie down or on my side_ it hurts to laugh_ bend or walk. It is hard to understand the pain as it is across the whole chest and up into my neck but it is slowly calming down. Very frightening tho.I had taken three doses of a 6 day course_ had this episode on the second evening at which point I also stopped taking the medicine.,This medication clearly has had some effect on my stomach but also possibly my lungs or pleuritic membrane - it has felt like the most severe chest infection or chest muscle strain you could imagine. I am asthmatic so it is possible that there is a strong contra-indication for asthmatics? I accept that this is a very effective medicine for many people but I do think doctors should very carefully consider the type of patient they have and their history_ and maybe they would not have prescribed this to me. I will now need to ensure my medical records state this medicine clearly as no-go for me.,F,43,2  days100 mg 2X D,11/21/2015,Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals)
3, 4, UTI,Lower abdominal pain (but no diarrhea)_ lower back pain_ pretty mild nausea_ bright neon yellow urine,Woke up in the middle of the night with the strong urge to pee and was peeing blood the entire day. I've never really had a UTI before. I knew blood wasn't uncommon but didn't want to take chances so went to a clinic. They prescribed me Bactrim first which seemed to clear things up by the next day or day after that. But then got a call that the culture came back and that particular strain was resistant so they put me on Macrobid. I guess it's cleared it up; no more blood_ no more pain_ no more urgency_ etc. I should probably take them with more food. Perhaps that would help with the slight nausea I've been getting.,F,27,10  days100mg 2X D,6/15/2013Email,Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals)
4, 4, UTI,Very bad headache_ occasional flutter of heartbeat_ tired_ some gas first day.,First time UTI. Within 2 hours of first dose_ my urine turned red-brown. Scared me_ because I thought it was bloody urine. This subsided by second day.  By second dose_ (12 hrs after first dose) my razor sharp pain lessened a lot.  By the third day_ (fifth dose) I was feeling much better_ headache lessened and UTI improved dramatically.  I do not tolerate medicine well_ so I was pleased to not have all the awful side effects.  Not sure I will comply with taking it for 10 days_ just because I cannot stand to take medicines_ especially something this strong.,F,50,2  days100 2X D,12/1/2012,Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals)

6, 1, UTI,Chest pain in evening of 2nd day.,Called my doctor to report side effect and she ordered me to the hospital saying I was probably having a heart attack. I knew I wasn't but went anyway. Admitted overnight_ suffering blood draws every 6 hrs_ stress test_ EKGs and after was sent home had to wear a monitor for 24 hrs.  I won't take this drug ever again.,F,63,2  days100 mg 2X D,6/19/2011Email,Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals)

8, 1, UTI,Pressure in chest_ difficulty breathing_ rapid heart beat_ fatigue,On the 3rd and final day of taking this medication I had extreme chest pain. Normally I am given Cipro for UTI's. The Nitrofur-Macro did not work and I was later prescribed Cipro. I initially dismissed the chest pain as heartburn_ but noticed that it was worst when lying down and my heart rate seemed more rapid_ as well as palpitations. I took antacids for three days without any change in my symptoms. After two weeks of discomfort I finally read the possible side effects listed from the pharmacy. One of which may cause serious(possibly fatal)  lung problems. I decided to go to the ER_ they took a chest X-ray_ an EKG_ an Echocardiogram_ a stress test_ ultra sounds of my thyroid and carotid arteries. They came back with nothing. They said I was just find_ but they were going to prescribe Xanax because maybe what I was experiencing was Anxiety. I have not taken the Xanax.If you are reading this about the generic form_ I would suggest you read the reviews for Macrobid on this same site. There are 15 pages of reviews_ many negative and quite a few with my symptoms. I am looking for a Physican that specializes in Pulmonary medicine.,F,49,3  days100 MG 2X D,2/7/2011Email,Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals)
9, 5, UTI,none,This is the 2nd time I have taken this drug and it is awesome_ clears my symptoms on day 1. I have never had any side effects on this_ please do not read these comments. They either took too high a dose or had an allergic reaction. If you are sensitive to most drugs_ tell your doctor to prescribe you 50mg instead of 100mg_ works just fine for me.,F,27,7  days50 mg 2X D,11/19/2010,Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals)
10, 4, UTI,I have taken this medication for 14 day periods of time for UTI's for more than 20 years. I had been taking the Nitrofurantoin on many separate occasions over a period of 20 years. The last few times I took the Nitrofurantoin I experienced strong headache around my eye along with nausea and vomiting after the 6th day of taking the medication. I have glaucoma (low tension) with damage to the optic nerve. I was afraid that the Nitrofurantoin might not be a good idea with the glaucoma so I stopped taking it and my doctor switched me to another antibiotic. I liked Nitrofurantoin because it was very effective with regard to the UTI's and I experienced no side effects other than the headache. So it's too bad I am afraid to take it anymore.,,F,58,14  days 2X D,6/19/2010,Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals)
