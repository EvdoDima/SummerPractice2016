0, 2, Chronic pain,Horrible burning in nose_ eyes and throat. Prescribed this to supplement a break fromNorco. Supposed to bring relief similar to morphine- ha! This is no stronger than a glorified ibuprofen. I don't understand why this is given in nasal spray format. Also do not inhale the med when spraying it you will be even worse off. Not worth the money.,,F,35,2  days,7/4/2012,Sprix
