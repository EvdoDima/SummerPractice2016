0, 4, Alcoholism,Severely elevated liver enzymes_ fatigue,This was a great drug. My drinking had really gotten out of hand. But campral helped me tremendously with cravings. I could go to the store and walk past the wine aisle no problem and wouldn't even think about drinking. Unfortunately my liver staged a revolt_ (ironic!) so I had to stop taking it. Of course the cravings came right back. Great while it lasted though...,F,40,3  months333 mg,10/30/2015,Campral
1, 5, Binge Drinking,None,It's fantastic. Seriously_ is this AA in pill form? I'm baffled by the effectiveness and tolerability. I'm not in any way associated with Forest. I don't even take Campral_ I take generic acamprosate calcium DR and it's still great. It does not act immediately. But after about a month_ I had no more thoughts of drinking. Advertisements no longer faze me. I have tried drinking on it and even my old favorite beers now taste disgusting. It almost works too well. I'm certain I won't drink as long as I take this drug.,M,24,4  months333 mg x 2 3X D,8/15/2015Email,Campral
2, 4, Alcohol Abuse,None_ really.  Maybe a little flat feeling.,I posted a year ago after being on it 9 days.  I managed to abstain for a full six months_ at which time I quit taking the Campral.  I started drinking again within a few weeks.  Though it seemed very subtle at the time_ the stuff does work; which is much easier to see in retrospect.  So today I'm starting back on the Campral.,M,47,1  years1998 3X D,6/27/2011Email,Campral
3, 5, Alcohol abuse,Maybe a little tired_ but taking Lexapro_ too,Once I stopped drinking for about 5 days while taking Campral_ it worked. Cravings mostly gone. It repairs the prefrontal lobe_ which is needed to make good decisions about drinking and drugs. Really_ a miracle drug. I highly recommend it to any alcoholics_ but you have to not drink for around a week_ and give it a chance. It did not help when I took it and still drank!!!,F,48,1  months2X333mg 3X D,9/12/2010,Campral
4, 3, Drinking out of control,Lowered libido_ weight loss_ food tastes different.,1) Only on day 9_ alcohol-free_ so I will update.  I had been drinking a 12-pack a night for years.  Seems to help with cravings.  I usually cave after a week or so_ so we will see....,M,46,9  days1998 3X D,6/29/2010,Campral
5, 3, alcoholism,"None that were appreciable but I was on a ""cocktail"" of medications.",I was on campral_ depakote and zoloft. The morning and afternoon dose made me sleepy.  Afer rehab I went down to 2 doses a day for around 3 months.  Then didn't feel that it was helping all that much and stopped treatment. Have been sober for almost 3 years but have other mood disorder that I have to medicate.,M,39,4  months,3/25/2009,Campral
6, 3, alcoholism,None so far_ but it's only been a week.,,F,34,7  days,5/1/2008,Campral
7, 1, alcoholism,suicidal thoughts_ increased depression_ anger,I am on Paxil as well as Campral and the effects may be due to the mix of the drugs.  But I got off after only a week so I may have to find another way to stop my obsession with drinking.,F,47,7  days,4/15/2008,Campral
