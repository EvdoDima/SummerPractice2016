0, 1, Type II,Severe Joint pain,I told my Dr. I was sick of taking Actos and wanted to try something else.  Big mistake_ Januvia gave me massive pain in one knee to the point where I could barely walk.  I also went to an Orthopedic Surgeon just to have my knee checked out and they found nothing wrong.  I've been off the drug for 4 weeks and the pain is better but not even closer to normal. Now back on Actos and my Blood Sugar count is actually worse than before I stared on Januvia.  My numbers in the morning were always around 120_ now they are in the 130's and a few have even been in the 150's.  I think this stuff has done permanent damage_ or is at least going to take a lot more time for me to recover.,M,63,4  days100 1X D,8/3/2016Email,Januvia
1, 1, Type 2 diabetes,I had been taking Januvia 25 mg  with Metformin ER for 4 months then the DR just increased it to Januvia 50 mg a day. Well_ within 2 weeks_ my finger joints hurt_ and  my fingers began swelling. Then_ my ears seemed plugged all the time. Not much longer_ the diarrhea set in just after eating or drinking anything. Then_ I had diarrhea all day / night long. Finally_ I was sooooo dizzy that I couldn't get out of bed and dry heaves were very_ very nasty. I took myself off Januvia and within 2 days the dizziness stopped. The diarrhea is ongoing. ,The side effects are sooo nasty. With all the diarrhea_ the Metformin ER pills I take end up in the toilet bowl. All_ in all_ looks like this was a really bad medicine to take. My DR has no understanding of these side effects.,F,66,14  days50 mg 1X D,7/28/2016,Januvia
2, 1, Blood sugar,OmG the swelling in my feet is ridiculous. My husband first noticed my upper stomach getting bigger. At first I thought he was teasing me about gaining weight but that was januvia. Gained 6 lbs in one week. I'm done. Going back to invocana. I'll deal with the yeast infection. Now here comes these horrible leg cramps. My poor husband has to deal with me screaming in the middle of the night. And now during the day. This is just crazy.,Oh and my counts are going nuts too. They usually are in the high 90's and low 100's. I woke up this morning and it was 165. Very high for me. I'm so done. Sorry dr.,F,60,1  weeks100mg,7/22/2016Email,Januvia

8, 2, Type II Diabetic,Severe abdominal pain on front upper right side and across the lower front of abdomen.  Symptoms started about 60 days ago.  Usually worse in the evening but goes away during the night and morning.  Never had any problems with the drug.  Recent ultrasound test were normal.  I stopped taking the drug 5 days ago and abdomen is instantly back to normal.  No pain.  Doctor notified and will see him next week to change med.  Feeling much better now.,My BG average reading slowly increased over the last year so I don't think the Januvia was working.  Also take Metformin and Glipizide with it.  Started Actos 45 days ago to lower my A1c which had been at 7.5.  Just had lab test and it is now 9.1 so not sure if Actos is working.  Based on the side effects of Actos_ I think I want to get off it if possible.  I had never experience such abdominal pain with a diabetic drug like Januvia.  However_ I took Victoza for about a month before Januvia and it also upset my stomach but not as bad as Januvia.  I was diagnosed diabetic at the age of 61.,M,63,1  years100 MG 1X D,2/23/2016Email,Januvia
9, 1, High Blood Sugar,Severe joint and muscle pain increasing in all extremities.  Right side stomach pain that also radiated trough to back.  Swelling of lower legs PLEASE SEE MY COMMENTS,Over a 2 year period I went from being an active and healthy 6Â’1 205 lb 52 year old male to a 54 year old crippled. Please note that I had NO problems prior to starting this drug. Over the last 2 years these symptoms crept up on me so be careful and alert.   NOW TO GET TO FOR THE GOOD NEWS AND OFFER HOPE FOR OTHERS THAT MAY BE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUES... for the new year I was having to change healthcare providers and my new carrier would not pay for Januvia and with a cost of $380 per month I wasn't going to be able to continue it.  As a consequence_ I was then put on Metformin in mid-December 2015.  Within 2 weeks of stopping Januvia I was realizing that my joint and muscle pain was subsiding.  As the following weeks went by I couldn't believe how much better I was feeling and was becoming very hopeful-so here is my update as of today 02/07/2016 7 weeks since I stopped taking Januvia.  My muscle pain is GONE.  Joint pain down 85 % and getting better everyday.  Stomach and back pain took longer to get relief_ but over the last 2 weeks it is now GONE.  Leg swelling is GONE. There is no question that this drug was the problem  so if you are experience any of these please consider this may be the issue for you.  The positive is that it can resolve very quickly after stopping the drug.  ,M,54,2  years100 1X D,2/7/2016,Januvia

Combined with a low carb diet it controls my Blood Glucose very well.

I also take medication for hypertension since 2001(lisnopril and Olmesezt). I have been taking amaryl(2mg) with Metformin(500mg) and Gilprimide for the last 5 years with good control of blood sugar levels. However my doctor prescribed 100 mg of Januvia with metformin-500mg made a veras a more efficient alternative to Amaryl. I started taking this Januvia since marhc of this year and I noted in the first 2 months some general tiredness and my fasting blood sugar was high -130 mg/dl compared with 90 mg/dl with amaryl. More importantly after 3 months of Januvia i started having intense body pain_ constipation tiredness_ headache_ sore throat in the morning_ nauseua and trouble concentrating. i was advised to take vitaminD-3-2000iu every day. I did that for the last 2 weeks and it has not reduced these symptoms. I stopped Genuvia since last monday and my tiredness and body pain has reduced considerably. I still do not have the energy I HAD before starting on Januvia. I switched back to Amaryl and my blood sugar is back under control. Is this a common experience to the side effect of Januvia.

Eighty-eight post-marketing cases of acute pancreatitis_ including two cases of hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis in patients using sitagliptin_ were reported to the Agency between October 2006 and February 2009. It is recommended that healthcare professionals monitor patients carefully for the development of pancreatitis after initiation or dose increases of sitagliptin or sitagliptin/metformin. Sitagliptin has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Therefore_ it is not known whether these patients are at an increased risk for developing pancreatitis and the medication should be used with caution and with appropriate monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis.

I have had to take lortab just to sleep at night because the pain is so intense! I have quit taking it (as of 2 days ago) to see it it will go away.  The pain isn't as bad but my hands are still somewhat numb and very swollen! This drug scares me!,,F,48,6  weeks100 1X D,7/9/2010Email,Januvia
56, 1, type 2 diabetes,Totally useless_ increased blood sugars.,My blood sugars were running at about 200 all of the time (prednisone induced diabetes)_ started Januvia and although it decreased my hunger somewhat_ it caused my blood sugars to go up to close to 300. Discontinued Januvia and started taking Actos_ which is much_ much worse!,F,43,4  days20 1X D,6/30/2010Email,Januvia

58, 2, Type 2 diabetes,Bloating_ headaches_ joint problems_ sleep issues_ extreme tiredness.,I stopped taking it 4 weeks ago and for the first time ever my A1c is 9.7 and my nonfasting BSL was 324...is it possible that this drug actually caused my pancreas to stop producing insulin altogether?,F,61,5  months 1X D,5/11/2010,Januvia
59, 5, Type 2 Diabetes,During the first month I experienced symptoms similar to flu or sinus allergy...was aware of this side effect beforehand and took an antihistamine to help tone down the symptoms until the side effects wore off after 1 month.  After the first month no major problems.,I switched to Januvia last year due to too many problems with the side effects of the Actos diabetic drug that I was on before-weight gain_ carb cravings_ myopathy_ etc.  I had taken Actos for over 18 mths and despite different types of strict exercise and diet routines the weight gain piled on and I felt like I was losing muscle strength on top of it.  So I did some online research to find another diabetic med and narrowed it down to Januvia and Byetta-I chose Januvia because I didn't want to deal with the injection routine of Byetta.  I knew about the side effects that some people had with Januvia before I took it_ so I took an antihistamine the first month for the flu like symptoms and added extra CoQ10 (conenzyme 10_ a necessary enzyme for energy production) for the myopathy like symptoms to my diet.  Since the first month I haven't had any problems and Januvia helps to keep my blood sugar in better control_ suppresses the carb cravings and I got my muscle strength back.  Maybe for some of you adding CoQ10 may help you to stay on Januvia-please discuss it with your MD and research this important supplement.  After being on Januvia for just over a year_ I got my life back and have no other major problems with it.,F,48,1  years,10/3/2009,Januvia
60, 1, Type 2 Diabetes,My blood sugar numbers did not improve by taking Januvia_ in fact they increased.  I attributed it to the overall pain that I had after I started taking the drug_ it started with hip joint pain that made it impossible to walk up stairs_ followed by elbow joint pain_ a complete and utter feeling of fatigue and constant pain.  When I woke in the morning_ sometimes it felt like I had been a punching bag all night.  This led to mild depression.,Two days after I stopped taking Januvia_ the hip pain was gone_ I was able to walk stairs again_ I have a renewed feeling of well being again AND my blood sugar numbers are so much better_ by 30%,M,43,7  months,5/14/2009,Januvia
61, 5, type 2,None this is the best thing that happened to me since I was diagnosed 9 years ago.,I'm small 102 pounds and maintain my weight. Even with all of the testing_ exercise_ and small meals my sugar was high while on 20mg glyburide and 30mg Actos daily. I had a bad time with the actos swelling_ aggravated sinus_ allergies. I never felt it really was effective_ plus bone loss was evident after four or five years.I insisted that my doctor let me try something new so I could get off the actos. I was perscribed 100mg Januvia one time a day and stayed on glyburide. The Januvia was affective immediately and lasts 24 hours. AIC dropped from 7.6 to 6.4 in six months.,F,61,1  years,5/7/2009,Januvia
62, 5, Type 2 Diabetes weight gaine,I have been steadily losing weight since switching to Januvia from Avandamet. Average weight loss for the past seven months has been about three pounds a month. I have not changed my diet or been exercising more since switching to Januvia. My doctor did have to double my dose of Januvia after the first three months because it wasn't controlling my blood sugar as well.,I have not experienced any other side-effects other than desired weight loss. Since starting to take Avandia and Avandament 5 years ago_ I had gained about 40 pounds_ averaging 8 pounds a year. I have already lost half of that weight in the past seven monhts. I feel great.,M,52,7  months,3/20/2009,Januvia
63, 3, type 2 diabetes,muscle cramps_sore throat,At 1st this was a great med. for me then I developed muscle cramping that I had already had taking Metformin and this drug made it worse....My BS #'s are low but I cannot handle the pain....,F,49,2  years,3/2/2009,Januvia

65, 4, diabetes type 2,mild sore throat_ runny noise_ increased post-nasal drip_ increased appetite (especially for starchy food),Took 100mg/day and while it was a relief from the excessively smelly flatulence from the Metformin_ didn't really help my blood sugar as much as I had hoped.  Also_ the cold-like symptoms I got were somewhat annoying because I never knew if I was catching something or not.  The change before/after meal was actually better than that for Metformin (ie_ not as much of a change in before/after when I ate a lot of carbs)_ but it made my fasting and post-exercise blood sugar a lot worse.  I also felt more sluggish on Januvia_ possibly from the higher blood sugar.  I'm hoping that maybe the combination of Januvia + Metformin will work out really well -- the Januvia for the meals and Metformin for all the other times.,F,29,3  months,12/18/2008Email,Januvia

69, 1, Type 2 diabetes,No side effects that I'm aware of.,Was taking Metformin (worked like a charm) but had to change meds due to kidney problems.  Have taken Januvia for 2 months and my glucose readings are VERY high.  It obviously does nothing ........,F,69,2  months,9/28/2008,Januvia
70, 3, type 2 diabetes,Increased blood pressure_ heart pounding,Once I stopped the 100mg daily dose I was taking my blood pressure normalized from 156/100 back to its normal 125/80. I think that the reports of headache might be people with high blood pressure. This medicine did help my blood sugar readings but I found it was not all that effective for me_ now taking 2000 metformin (I was taking this while on januvia) and .05 prandin. The prandin is great_ works really quickly and a very low dose dropped my levels down fast_ but it is almost too strong. Also I am concerned about having to make my beta cells work too hard so I am going to get off the prandin asap,M,43,21  days,8/1/2008,Januvia
71, 3, type 2 diabetes,My glucose went down and was often normal but I started feeling congested all the time. Then I caught a bad upper respiratory infection and twice my throat closed up on me making it very hard to breathe. I normally do not catch anything.
