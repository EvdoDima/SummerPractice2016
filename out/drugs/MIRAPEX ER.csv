0, 2, Parkinson's (Tremor based),1)  Compulsive shopping_ i.e. the drive to find a bargain; I was spending hours online trying to find the best deal for anything and everything  2) hypersexuality_ mostly a reckless voyeuristic addiction to porn.  Note: This was my second time trying Mirapex_ the first time (almost 3 years ago now I was on it for approx 9 mos) my dosage was higher & the compulsive shopping was becoming impossible to control.  Neuro took me off it & increased L-dopa instead for PD symptom control.  This time_ however_ knowing the compulsive side- effects_ he agreed to lower the dosage.,Recently underwent Deep Brain Stimulation for PD with hopes of decreasing other meds.  Surgery went smoothly_ w/o any remarkable concerns. Meds-reduction is just the opposite. Due to ER version of Mirapex_ was forced to stop cold-turkey. Withdrawal has been miserable. Although dosage was small_ the result has been constant fatigue & drowsiness; uncharacterstically sleeping 9-10 hours or longer per night; unable to feel fully rested. Refuse to go back on it & am unsure of next step. Wouldn't recommend this med_ for multiple reasons.,M,54,9  months3MG 1X D,5/17/2014,Mirapex er
1, 1, RLS,The Side Effects were brutal. Compulsive gambling_ compulsive lying_ compulsive spending and compulsive sexual activity was all part of my 16 months with this drug. It has cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars that I will never get back. This is an evil drug and I do not say that lightly. Your doctor will not understand the level to which this drug can change your thinking. Please feel free to contact me if you have had this experience or want to more about this drug or group of drugs,,M,52,16  months.5 MG 3X D,2/20/2014Email,Mirapex er
2, 1, Restless Legs Syndrome,Multiple obsessive behavior problems.,This medication is extremely good at reliving RLS symptoms but also causes potentially life destroying obsessive behavior problems. I will be happy to share my experiences with anyone who is interested.,M,57,8  years1.5mg 1X D,7/28/2013Email,Mirapex er
3, 1, restless leg syndrome,I haven't had a nights sleep in 4 weeks_ most of the time I'm awake all night_ then I doze off in the daytime for 45 to 60 minutes. My feet are numb up to my ankles_ can't feel my toes or bend my instep. I can't sit still or lay down & I'm afraid to walk_ I might fall from lack of sleep. I took Mirapex since it went on the market_ it made me worse_ suicidal_ anything would be better than this. It's after 3AM & I've been sitting here with my feet moving constantly reading the comments of 203 people out of the 373 comments. I'm 84 years old_ & this pill has made my life a living hell_ all I do is kick_ & cry & eat & gain 70 lbs & I'm so unhappy in these last days of my life. I hope you younger people read some of the comments & get off of this pill.I have tried_ Sinemet_  Requip_ Gabapentin_ everything on the market_ but Mirapex is the worse pill to take. I quit cold turkey a few weeks ago_ & my legs are still kicking furiously_ this is a horrible way to end your days on this earth_ crying my heart out day after day_ going from 1 doctor to another_ no way to live. Someone has to find a way to help people like me_ I even take prescribed sleeping pills_ & I can't sleep. Please help me & others like me. Thank You,,F,84,7  years1.5 mg,9/9/2012Email,Mirapex er
