0, 4, sleep,Lots of dreaming,There are two different Unisom pills.  One contains Diphenhydramine and one contains Doxylamine.  I take the one that contains Doxylamine_ as the other one does not let me sleep through the night and can me me jittery once awakened.,F,56,90  days25mg 1X D,8/6/2016Email,Unisom
1, 2, Yes,Hunger_weight gain,In the 4 years I've taken this medication it has helped me sleep but I've become overweight since starting it mainly because it makes me mindlessly eat hundreds of calories more than my unusual intake. The hunger feeling is so great I eat just to shut it up. I went from 150 pounds to 175 pounds and in my entire 29 years of life I've never put on weight so fast or struggled so hard to get it off. I only recently decided to track when my weight gain first started the time is nearly to the week that I started the unisom that the first two or three pounds appeared. I believe I have to stop it completely to loose weight. Hopefully my sleepless nights don't come back to hunt me,F,29,4  years100mg,7/31/2016Email,Unisom
2, 1, work hours sporadic ...needed help,Once I fell asleep my mind couldn't tell the difference between being asleep or being awake.It was a very uncomfortable feeling. It took quite a few moments after waking up to find cohesion. I was not on any other medication. I am not sure what caused this ; but very awful due to the mental confusion.,,F,33,7  days50mg,6/9/2016Email,Unisom
3, 4, Sleepless nights,The first time i took the pill i took two and it helped me to fall alseep right away. The next day i felt drowzy which was a good thing since i hadnt beem sleeping well i fiured it was a good way to catch up on my sleep. I kept taking it  maybe twice a month when i couldnt fall asleep. I only take it when its absoulutly necessary. Recently I took a pill but then had intimate relations with my babe and the sleeping pill seems to not work. Just wondering if pleasure or dopamine released from my body had anything to do with it?,,F,25,4  weeks,10/22/2015,Unisom
4, 1, Sleep aide,I took two pills around 11:30pm_ woke up next morning at 6:30 with a very upset stomach. Can't think of anything else that could've caused it.,,F,40,1  days2 pills,10/21/2015,Unisom
5, 3, To catch up on rest,I have tried unisom a total of 8 times 4 of which were when I was prescribed them from my doctor while I was pregnant. Each and every time I have only taken half or less of the single pill size. It helps me fall asleep within 25-30 min and I sleep very good however the next day I am groggy and extremely irritable. Anger absolutely has to be a side effect of this sleep aid. All 8 times I've taken it then very next day I'm a bear and that is not my personality AT ALL.,,F,28,8  times10mg about,10/1/2015,Unisom
6, 5, Pregnancy insomnia,It helpes me call asleep pretty quickly and I stay asleep all night. The only thing I don't like is I feel tired and groggy the next day. I almost always have to end up taking a nap.,,F,18,5  months1,9/3/2015,Unisom
7, 2, catch up on lost sleep,definitely not worth the side effects next day: dizziness_ grogginess_ lack of focus_ brain fog_ nausea and mild pain in my stomach and mild diarrhea.,Went to bed at 11pm_ took the pill_ was a sleep by 11.30pm and slept well until about 5am_ then on and off weird very light sleep till 9am_ i could not get up!!! Next day is hell_ not so tired_ but freaking dizzy and not myself. Hard to work! Temazepan has no side effects and good sleep (10mg is enough for me)_ but highly addictive. Trying to get pregnant so I'm trying to find something I could take during pregnancy...any help?,F,35,1  days12.5mg 1X D,8/25/2015Email,Unisom
8, 3, insomnia,I got a great nights rest. Took a whole pill first night. Then last 6_ i only took half. Regardless of amount_ i woke up to total lethargy. Left me with a dry throat too. I was useless at work until afternoon.,I gave it a week to see if my body would get used to it. I will not take it anymore.,M,57,7  days15mg,8/11/2015,Unisom
9, 4, Insomnia,Nausea and early morning grogginess,I find that like others it takes an hour_ sometimes 2 to start working_ once it does I sleep pretty well. I do feel a bit hazy in the morning but after a couple hours or a good brisk walk I'm back to myself. I feel nauseated off and on though. I take it 3-4 times a week_ I find if I skip a day or two in between is when it works best.,F,36,3  months50mg,7/28/2015Email,Unisom
10, 2, I have insomnia,Immediately after taking it I felt very drowsy so I laid down and tried to go to sleep. It then took me a half hour to fall asleep. Once I fell asleep I woke up about a half hour later and felt very restless and fidgety. It was almost like my feet wanted to run a marathon. I then fell back asleep and woke up about every hour after that with the same thing. It was very uncomfortable.,,F,19,1  days50 mg,6/11/2015Email,Unisom
11, 1, trouble sleeping,Tried two nights a few days apart.  The first night sleep came easy. BUT the next day I was a basket case and had a complete melt down. So out if character for me. I never even thought it might have been a reaction.I took again several nights later and spent entire next day in a dark depression. Very scaryWill never take againCount sheep_ pray_ read anything else,,F,56,2  days25,5/15/2015,Unisom
12, 5, To fall asleep sooner,A full pill made me dopey until 5 p.m. the next day.,1/8-1/4 of a pill has worked great for 16 years.  I fall asleep in 1/2 hour_ only wake up once to use the restroom_ fall immediately asleep again_ and wake up refreshed and alert at 6 a.m.  One cup of coffee does the final morning perk up.  Take 250-500 mg of magnesium before bed to soften stools.,,59, 1/8-1/4 pi 1X D,5/5/2015,Unisom

14, 4, Occasional sleep aid,I experience mild personality suppression the next day_ but few other side effects.,I use the Unisom sleep tabs_ but have learned to break them in half_ and only take 1/2 tab as my dose. When I use them I take it by 9 PM and am in bed by 9:30_ as I get up at 6:30 AM -- so I'm able to get a full night's rest. Taking only the 1/2 tab seems to make it much easier to control the next day side effects_ yet I always get a deep sleep. I find I take 1/2 tab maybe once a month when I need to catch up on my sleep.,M,62,5  years25 mg 1X AN,3/25/2015,Unisom

17, 3, Insomnia,I took this med (doxylamine succinate Unisom tablet) for the first and last time last night.  It was great falling asleep at midnight compared to 5 a.m. but the next day_ today_ I am so out of it.  I can't talk_ not my normal articulate self.  It's a different kind of grogginess than what I get from Benadryl/diphenhydramine... I'm tired_ restless_ don't feel like myself.  I take adderall for the fatigue associated with my depression.  I took 60 mg (3 pills) in the past two hours and... nothing.  I'm too scared to take 1/2 a pill lest this happens again.,,F,27,1  days25 mg 1X D,1/18/2015,Unisom
18, 3, insomnia,It puts me into a very deep sleep. Bad tremor and shakes. Nothing else makes me sleep so deep. Some depression. I have taken many psychiatric drugs and Unisom works better for sleep.,Overall good experience.,M,43,2  years25mg,11/20/2014Email,Unisom

21, 2, Insomnia,Sure_ it put's you to sleep- not only for the night_ but also for most of the next day,I took 1- 25mg tab and it definitely put me to sleep_ but I had bad side effects the next day. I was depersonalized_ confused_ unmotivated_ emotionless_ and didn't want to move. I drank 3 monster energy drinks- that barley helped me to get semi-motivated. I usually can't drink energy drinks_ because I am so sensitive to caffeine. I also had crazy erotic dreams about Bill Clinton. Needless to say- I am done taking Unisom.,F,28,1  days25 1X D,4/9/2014,Unisom
22, 3, Insomnia,Sometimes it worked well for me_ helping me fall and stay asleep for most of the night. Other times_ however_ I felt exhausted_ spaced out and foggy the next day_ and also suffered nausea on a few occasions. I also experienced bizarre_ vivid dreams on a few occasions after taking this medication.,Doxylamine succinate is supposed to be the most sedating over-the-counter medication available_ so use caution when taking it. When taking this medication_ make sure you avoid other sedating substances such as alcohol_ benzodiazepines (e.g._ Xanax_ Klonopin)_ and prescription sleeping pills (Ambien_ Restoril_ etc.). Because of the potency of this medication_ you may want to start out with a smaller dosehalf a pill_ say_ which equals 12.5 MGsto see how you react to it.,M,54, 25 MG 1X D,3/27/2014,Unisom
23, 4, Insomnia,First time I took it I experienced anhedonia_ emotional blunting and fatigue. But I took  whole 25 mg tablet. I realized I can induce sleep with as little as 7mg_ which is roughly a third of the tablet. Any sedation is counteracted with caffeine next day. Nowadays I have to take the whole tablet though_ I still get decent sleep though. But I always reacted poorly to benzos and other GABAenergic drugs.,,F,27,1  years12.5-25mg,12/25/2013Email,Unisom

25, 3, Insomnia,Agitation_ irritability_ depression,This drug worked well at getting me to go down_ but I woke up several times during the night and the next day I would feel worthless_ agitated_ and depressed. All sleeping medicines cause this for me for some reason.  I'm trying to go to sleep naturally now.  This is just my experience_ it may work fine for you.,F,30,1  years25 MG 1X D,8/9/2013Email,Unisom

28, 2, Insomnia,I have been on ambien and was up to 30mg but it would still take 2-3the hrs to kick in. I have been using unisom when my ambien runs out bc im only allowed a certain amount each month. I am now up to 5-6a pills and they ztill take 2-3 hrs to fall asleep. I wish i could find a sleeping pill thatwould take 15-30the mins to work and still sleep through the night. With 6 pills i still wake up in the middle of the night and if i have to get up for work after only 3 hrs of sleep i dont feel groggy or anything. Im wide awake and can stay awake for 24 hrs no problem,,F,32,3  days300,11/19/2012Email,Unisom
29, 1, severe trouble falling asleep,causes me not to be able to fall asleep more than if I did not take it! And then I sleep feeling like I'm wide awake.  Worsens RLS symptoms.  Compared to the now MIA Simply Sleep (by Tylenol) Unisom does not work at all.  Save your $$ and just take deep breaths.,,F,40,14  days50 1X D,9/12/2012Email,Unisom
30, 2, Insomnia,This is my first (and last) time taking Unisom.  I have frequent insomnia but do not usually take any medication for it.  I have tried Ambien and Lunesta in the past with no bad side affects.Unlike Ambien_ I had a very difficult time falling asleep_ missed my morning Alarm clock_ overslept by 40 minutes_ and was so sleepy that I was unable to function for most of the day at my office.The sensation was like a really bad hangover.  The effects started to wear off approximately 15 hours later.  Multiple cups of tea and coffee did little to help the drowsy_ cloudy feeling I felt all day.,Worst sleep-aid I have ever used.  Benadryl_ Ambien_ and Lunesa have little to no side-effect if taken once in a while.,M,41,1  days25mg 1X D,4/23/2012Email,Unisom
31, 4, trouble falling and staying asleep,I never taking sleep meds so i started with 1/2 of one 25mg tablet after 30 mins of no results I took the other half.   I still had trouble initially falling asleep but after that I was out_ I had no problems with waking during the night.  I won't take it again because I felt tired and groggy all the next day.  Not worth it I would rather be tired from no sleep and able to function then feeling out of it all day because of a pill.  It basically all depends on the past medical history.  I someone has been taking sleeping pills often and have built up an immunity to them this probably won't work_ but for someone using only once in awhile it does the trick.,,F,27,1  days25,3/31/2012,Unisom
32, 2, Insomnia,Unison(doxylamine) is not as effective as I hoped. I have to take between 50 and 100mg (2-4name) pills)to feel sleepy at all and also add a couple benadryl if the unison does not work after a couple hours. I do not have insurance but I gotta find a cheap Dr. Because these otc pills are useless,,F,30,1  days100mg,3/24/2012Email,Unisom
33, 4, To prevent insomnia,None so far after taking them...,It will work when I dissolve by drinking water along with the 5HTP. Remember that this does not promote a normal or rejuvenating sleep_ it helps people to fall asleep. Once people take two which those that have the melting tablets_ drinking water along with the 5HTP may or may not help. As a user_ I'm satisfied with this. 5HTP is to relax the mood and with the Unisom_ it will last a night and wake up with a little grogginess. I'm okay so far_ so no side effects as of yet. I gave it a four out of five because this will not work without taking 5HTP twice a day.,M,22,1.5  weeks50 1X D,3/18/2012Email,Unisom
34, 1, Insomnia,depression_ anxiety_ sleeplessness_ dry mouth_ hangover.,"Effects have been bad for me. Its my belief that after taking this drug for months that it has made my depression and anxiety much worse.I would not recommend using Unisom or other antihistamines over any period of time if you are predisposed to depression or anxiety.Like other hypnotics_ sleeping pills alter brain chemistry the same way. Benzos_ antihistamines_ and SSRI's (antidepressants) target GABA receptors in the brain. Taking Unisom or other hypnotics will only mask the causes of insomnia_ you will fall asleep_ but it will be unnatural. This is what gives you that ""hangover"" effect when you wake up in the morning. That ""hangover"" effect may have cumulative negative effects on your brains normal operation and can_ over time_ make depression and anxiety worse. We know depression_ anxiety_ insomnia are all related. I know its tempting for doctors and patients to seek a quick resolution of insomnia or depression since they impact your life greatly.But I would caution against using Unisom or other sleep agents if you have depression/anxiety and seek practical_ natural_ and behavioral steps to alleviate your insomnia.There is very little information about doxylamine succinate. These drugs have only been around for a few years while insomnia_ depression_ and anxiety have been around for as long as human kind. We cannot fool ourselves into taking new drugs for ages old conditions.Unisom_ Benzos_ SSRIs_ & antihistamines side effects are t",M,26,2  years25mg 1X D,2/17/2011Email,Unisom

37, 5, Insomnia; to sleep,Sometimes groggy in the morning. I usually take it when I know I don't have to get up early_ and I let it put me back to sleep for a while.,My seventeen year old daughter and I both have insomnia. For her_ Unisom Sleepgels have worked very well. I have had to take something stronger most nights_ and am currently taking Ambien. But on occasional nights_ I do take the same Unisom Sleepgels that my daughter does. They work very well. Sometimes it takes a while for them to take effect_ so I will take one an hour or so before bedtime. They often keep me very sleepy the next morning_ so when I take them_ I try not to plan too many morning activities. At the time they do put me to sleep_ they feel very strong for an over the counter medication.,F,49,2  years1 Sleepgel 1X D,10/1/2010Email,Unisom

41, 5, Insomnia,I am using Doxylamine already for a few years. I live in Australia and take it in tablet form with the brand name Restavit. However_ I take only 1/2 a tablet (12.5mg) about an hour before going to bed. I then take also a Valerian capsule and 1/2 teaspoon Tryptophan. The combination seems to work exept when I have been overstimulated by having visitors or working too late on my computer etc. I have Fybromyalgia and find that the anti-histamnine is something I also need for some of my allergies.,So far I have not found problems with taking this but I may not recognise them because of the complaints I have with Fybromyalgia.,F,56,7  years,4/14/2008Email,Unisom
42, 4, Insomnia,Having used sleeping meds for years and after having become highly addicted to them_ Unisom brought me wonderful relief from extended insomnia when I had to stop the sleeping pills.Be warned though! I now have HYPER acidosis! Have to take up to 80mg's of acid blocking P.P.I's due to a totally messed up gastric system now. This has lead to ulcers and now gout type arthritis which the Physician says all stems from having used Unisom for close on 3 years.,,F,51,3  years,1/21/2008Email,Unisom
43, 4, Insomnia,A very effective insomnia remedy. Better than sleeping tablets. The down side is that over time you need to keep on upping your dose till you reach a point where you are actually overdosing as you become tolerant very quickly to the Unisom (Doccylacime Succinate.)For people with gastric sensitivity it is worth keeping in mind that this is actually an anti-histamine and can mess quite badly with the acid contents of the stomach.,,F,50,1  years,7/15/2007,Unisom
44, 4, Insomnia,Lingering grogginess in the morning.,Even though this is an over-the-counter drug_ as far as inducing the feeling of sleepiness_ it is one of the most powerful I've tried and_ in that respect_ works better than both Ambien and Lunesta. The problem with it for me is that it can take over an hour to kick in -- but when it does you'd better be in bed or close by. It's so strong that I have to buy it in the oval tablet form and break them in half. If I took a whole one_ I'd still be in a fog for over half of the next day. As it is_ even with the half tablet_ I'm still too groggy in the morning which is why I don't use it more. But it's a very effective sleep medicine.,M,51,18  months,10/9/2006,Unisom
45, 3, Sleep aid (doxylamine version),Morning drowsiness.  Fewer side effects than with Benadryl (can't remember Benadryl's generic name_ it is used also in a different Unisom formulation):  no hunger or dry mouth which I get with Benadryl.,This is a very powerful drug and should be available in a lower dosage.  I am now taking a version (Donormyl) I buy in France which is 15 mg_ divisible in two for a 7.5 mg dose_ and I am very happy with that dose.  Unisom is available only in 25 mg. tablets so that even if one splits the pill_ as I did_ the dosage is still too large.  I recommended this (as the only version available in the US) to two friends who both tried and rejected it as too powerful.,F,65,30  days,7/28/2006,Unisom
