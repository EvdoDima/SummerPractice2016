0, 3, ,The drug itself worked wonderfully! But putting it through my IV was the absolute WORST HORRIFIC PAIN I HAVE EVER FELT! It felt as if they were putting fire in my arm! My arm felt like it was going to explode! I could tolerate pain I've had two kids and I'm a pretty quiet person... I told the doctor it's burning and it just kept getting worse I ended up screaming and crying begging them to stop! Finally the doctor went to the opposite arm and gave me another injection that did not hurt and put me out.. I have never experienced pain like that in my life.. I did hear the doctor say it was because it was a small vein... I have huge veins.. I'm always told when I take blood how wonderful my veins are this was shocking to hear.... Other then that I remember crying falling asleep and then remember waking up and just so happy it was all over... I'm definitely scared out of my mind to ever be put under for the reason of the burning sensation! It's been 5 days since surgery and I feel Iike I have a Charlie horse in my arm and numbness... And a black & blue nasty bruise..Pain from a 1-10  was 10+++++++,,F,36,1  days,7/13/2016,Diprivan

5, 1, Colonoscopy,Woke up crying and cried hysterically on and off for a day or two afterwards_ plus I was highly anxious and agitated. I was definitely not myself.,I took Diprivan because I woke up crying in pain during the last part of my first scope under the usual Fentanyl-Versed combo and the procedure could not be completed. Needless to say_ after having nothing but trouble both times_ I will never have another scope for screening purposes.,F,54,1  days,10/12/2015,Diprivan

7, 4, Colonoscopy,I was out within 5 seconds of the propofol being injected into the IV. Woke up in recovery extreme tired and zombie like. Slept the majority of the day afterwards_ felt so tired and drained. But now it's been 8 hours since I left the doctors office and I'm experiencing the worst join pain in every joint of both legs and arms.  I feel like I was either running a marathon all day or am getting the flu.

9, 5, Surgeries_ EGD and colonoscopy,None.,I've had 6 surgeries since 2010-an endometrial ablation_ bone spur removal on both feet which was 2 separate surgeries_ a 2 level ACDF on my cervical spine(major surgery) knee athroscopy for a torn meniscus and bilateral eye muscle surgery and I just recently had a colonoscopy and EGD during two visits to the endoscopy center in the last 2 months. I had propofol for all of those procedures-one minute you're awake_ the next thing  you know you're in recovery and thinking how easy it all went. Propofol is such a wonderful drug.  When I had my epidural steroid injections and my liver biopsy I had fentanyl and versed/ or just versed. I remember both procedures and even though I don't recall any pain I do remember the needle and biopsy needle. Unlike the propofol I have no clear memories of the rest of day for both procedures.,F,54,  1X D,9/3/2015,Diprivan

Prickly and itching all over body. Intense pin prick feelings. What is it doing to the rest of your body if it hurt so bad in the arm?,Why is this damaging poison being administered to us and why are we being told it is so great!??? It is not!

This left me with ulcers up my arms and shoulders that are still covering my left arm for 3 years now.,The doctor's both told me they give us enough dope when that happens and very few remember it.

19, 2, epidural injection in my lower back,An IV was placed (so I thought) was given propofol but never fell out. I was awake the whole time.

20, 5, EGD/ UPPER ENDOSCOPY,As soon as this was injected into my IV_ I could feel myself losing consciousness_in what seemed like slow motion. It probably only took 20 seconds for me to black out_ but I don't like the feeling of losing control. I have had many surgeries and have never experienced this panic with anesthesia. Next time_ I will tell the anesthesiologist to make sure I black out without warning. I don't remember the EGD and that's the important thing. I know I yelled out several times before it worked.,I was already anxious about this procedure_ so maybe I should have been given an anti-anxiety med beforehand. I don't like the feeling of losing control_ and that's how I felt suddenly after being injected. I was also trying to breathe through the bite block and that may have made the anxiety sensation worse. In fact_ every other surgery I've ever had_ the bite block was placed after I was unconscious. I was injected with Robinal beforehand and my mouth was dried out from it. I don't know if this may have had an effect or not.,F,38,1  timesunknown,2/11/2015,Diprivan

I have never had any side effects from any of the drugs given to me during these procedures except for the usual grogginess. But I do confess I tend to get nervous prior to been put out. This time I went in for and EGD. The anesthesiologist told me you should fall asleep in about 20 seconds and might feel a burning sensation on your arm. It felt like the longest 20 seconds in my life.  I closed my eyes and started paying. I did not feel any burning but I did feel when the drug went into my brain and remember thinking_ oh there is goes_ then I felt it again. This time it was a little bit stronger sensation than the first. I remember thinking ""again"". I do not recall anything else.  I had not in my life experienced anything like that before.

25, 5, Colonoscopy and Upper Endoscopy,I have Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and an overall phobia of all medications so was terrified at the thought of using Propofol but had to have a Colonoscopy due to an extremely high family history of Colon Caner and symptoms I was having.  After getting prepped for the procedure the assisting nurse had me lie on my side and told me to open my mouth to insert a guard for the Upper Endoscopy and that's the last thing I remember.  There was no time to panic.  While she had me distracted the Anesthetist injected the Propofol into my IV.  I had absolutely no problems with it and have no memory of anything regarding the procedure.  The next thing I recall is being escorted out to the car by my husband.  I think it's a wonderful_ fast acting anesthetic and would gladly use it again for any procedure.  The after effects were only that I was more groggy than I had expected for the remainder of the day and on the second day developed a runny nose and some mild sneezing.

Both my Dr and the anesthesiologist reacted_ my doctor walking quickly over and the anesthesiologist checking my IV.   I swore_ SWORE I heard someone say is she crashing?

It felt funny to drink water; eating a sandwich was very difficult. I was ok until about 14 hrs after the colonoscopy when I noticed my throat glands had swollen to the size of golf balls. Four days later the swelling has improved to small grapes. When I reported the swelling to the dr he implied it must be from something else.

I have had to take 1-2 doses of Excedrin  each day.  The pain is in the same spot each day. It's not terrible_ but I wondered if it was a common side effect.,I was told to lay on my side and that's the last thing I remember. No counting or getting sleepy. Apparently_ I did say something to the doctor as I was going under & I had no recollection. I was shocked when he told me I had told him to do a good job because I had tickets for an upcoming sporting event. I had only met him that day & we had not discussed anything other than the surgery. I was expecting to feel groggy or have a sore throat but I felt fine when I woke up. I felt a little buzzed when I walked a few feet into a bathroom but that went away.

I received this medication in the past and the only difference this time is a constant runny nose and sneezing.  After reading others comments it seems like it is a common side effect.

I think they wanted to rush the procedures to avoid gridlock in the exam room_ so they knocked me out more quickly with higher doses of the stuff. I feel like I have permanent brain damage.

45, 2, Colonoscopy,I experienced profuse sneezing and copious nasal mucous discharge beginning immediately upon exiting the hospital. I had to use tissue after tissue after tissue_ all of which tore causing mucous to run down my sleeve_ the front of my coat_ and the side of my handbag. Sneezing fits continued until I decided to put wet cotton balls into the left nostril (the side that I was lying on during the colonoscopy) that helped for twenty minutes at a time. Sneezing convulsions continued when the cotton was removed for 2-3 seconds. This went on for 3-4 days_ when I was able to downgrade to a dry tissue stuffed into my nose. Then_ the right nostril started to drip. That lasted for another 3 days. Then_ I could breath without any insertions_ but the sneezing continued every 3 - 5 minutes for the next five days and lessened to hourly. The coughing that was periodic in the beginning then became frequent to the point where my lungs became sore_ fell heavy_ full_ and irritated.

After being used as a human pin cushion the iv was administered and shortly after the propofol was introduced.  I went right out and came back to almost full consciousnesses in about 20 min.  The next day I awoke with a headache which I normally don't get that has lasted 4 days now.  On top of that I don't feel like my normal self and my brain doesn't seem to be functioning well in terms of memory and conversation. I've also been experiencing minor tinnitus and a feeling that I'm lacking oxygen.  I'm almost positive the propofol is the cause.  I called the endoscopy center to see if this was normal.

He put together a ""cocktail"" of fantyal(spelled wrong)_ versed and propofol. I asked him if I would feel the sharp pain in my arm as it was being administered. I asked him about being sleepy the rest of the day and the length of time in recovery. I did not experience any  pain as they slowly started sedating me as I was being wheeled to OR.

An hour later_ my husband took me for grilled cheese and fries and I was totally back to normal within a few hours. Today I had my second experience with Propofol_ used for an upper endoscopy with biopsy. I'm glad my doc uses Propofol for this as it makes the experience much easier. I did have a much harder time with recovery today though--was very groggy and emotional for about 45 minutes after being woken up. I wasn't able to leave the recovery area for an hour. My doctor mentioned that this was probably due to my poor health in recent years_ so it makes sense that it was harder on my body this time. Needless to say_ I'll take Propofol over any other anesthesia any day. None of that nausea or horrible need to sleep that comes with Versed.

I was real spooked about this stuff going in_ new drug to me and all_ and if you are going to be receiving it_ it should only be administered in a facility that has the proper tools to handle any potential ACLS events - the only folks who should be giving Propofol (IMHO) are licensed and experienced anesthetists - and then_ they need to ALL the tools ready at hand to manage any problem_ should it arise.

It did what it does in large doses and there was no one to support his breathing.,It does not make you stop breathing while you are awake_ muscle relaxants do that!!!and when you give consent general for anesthesia_ it is part of it_ otherwise let us know if you want us to use ether drops to make sure you stay asleep or better yet wrestle you like they did in the dark ages.,,30, 1mg/kg 1X D,7/13/2010,Diprivan
96, 2, surgery,I was given this drug for general anesthesia for a ruptured appendix. I noted no side effects until a couple of weeks later when I was helping my daughter with her math and temporarily could not do simple multiplication(ie. 8x9 which is in my long term memory)I spoke to the pharmacist at work who told me that how propafol works is that it cuts down oxygen supply to the brain.This drup has only been around for a few years.(My nurses PDR which is from 2001 does not have this drug in it).

98, 2, anesthesia for colonoscopy,The drug really worked ..put me out instantly/no pain/  woke up feeling a little loopy.  I attributed  2 days of dizziness  and muscle spasms(post procedure)to hang- over from drug.I had muscles spasms in the neck and shoulders..(very painful.).muscles at back of neck_across the shoulders and along the jaw were very stiff. Glands under the jaw were tender to the touch. Four days after the procedure I was still having problems...Pain was so severe that I sought out assistance at an urgent care facility as my primary Doctor was not available.  The Doctor examining me  told may be it was the position I was placed in during the procedure that was causing the pain.  I asked her  if it was possible that the drug was a causitive factor..I felt fine before I went in for the colonoscopy and the only change was the fact I was given that drug....The Doctor said she couldn't correlate the symptoms I was having with the use of diprivan/propofol..I think she needs to go on the internet and educate,,F,71,  1X D,4/22/2010,Diprivan

I cam currently taking 400mg celebrex_ 7-500 Hydrocodone_ 5mg prednisone_ to stop whatever is causing the pain.,When administered_ it was one of the worst pains that I have ever felt. I screamed to the anesthesiolist that she was killing me and all she said was that the vapors had only gotten into my system the liquid hadn't entered yet. I have had a dozen surgeries and this is the first time that I have ever had pain_ especially severe pain. I do not know what to do if the pain doesn't stop soon_ I am crippled and hardly able to get out of bed? Already lost my job last Friday because I cannot function at any level.

101, 5, Oral Surgery,Very SLIGHT burning sensation (I'm a small person!) which lasted a few seconds and then my eyes got a little blurry_ then I woke up feeling wonderful. The good feeling only lasted a few minutes because Propofol wears off SO fast! I am EXTREMELY sensitive to all drugs affecting brain as I am a recovering benzodiazepine dependent_ and this drug is very safe. Even with a bolus dose and Asthma_ I didn't even come close to being apneic or having low blood pressure. My anesthesiologist agrees that it is the most well tolerated anesthetic/sedative and MJ's doctor was not using it properly. The media is full of crap.,I've had this drug twice in the last 5 years. Both good experiences. Last week was for Oral Surgery_ with just Propofol and a small dose of Valium_ it was very smooth going to sleep_ no panic and waking up clearly. Very good exp. I am also a recovering benzodiazepine addict_ which made it even more important that I not have Versed (it is a benzodiazepine)_ as it (Versed) would either not work requiring huge doses or it would provoke a return of withdrawal symptoms that I experienced coming off of other benzos such as Xanax. Before I was a dependent on benzos_ Versed worked very well for me_ BUT These days_ Versed would most probably make me EXTREMELY sick due to my brain's sensitivities.,F,23,2  times30mg bolus 2X O,2/13/2010Email,Diprivan

104, 5, Anesthesiologist,Pain on injection is the most common complaint,A great medication for those who need sedation during invasive procedures.  Side effects:  If every single possible side effect was discussed prior to surgery then you would never have the surgery.  Side effects can range from nothing to death_ if not used properly.  Water can kill you if you drink too much!  I think it is reasonable to discuss common or dangerous side effects.  If you want a zero percent chance of a side effect then do not request anesthesia.  Propofol is a great drug that has the best side effect profile of any medication that is available.  Bad experiences:  This can range based on the anesthesia provider (an art and science)_ the surgical provider_ overall hospital/clinic experience and the underlying personality of the patient.  Let's be honest_ some people are impossible to safisfy.,M,40, ,11/27/2009,Diprivan

I couldnt any way as I had no mind maps I could follow. I could see my front door and ""see"" the place I wanted to go but couldnt visualise a route from memory.

They then went to the arsenal and told me they were going to give me propofol (diprivan) and they did and gave more and more and more and more. Eventually they gave up told me NOTHING would put me under and then proceeded to do the surgery with only local anasthesia which was horrible since it was facial surgery and I literally had to sit still as they peeled my face off and around and put me back together! I am glad I have a very high pain tolerance.,The doctors told me I was the first person they have seen to NOT go under from any amount of this medication. I was told I likely had a very high metabolism which is true and also why I do not do drugs or tend to get a buzz off anything.

I got myself home from the hospital alone on public transport after the procedure and I seemed to have asked the doctor all the relevant intelligent questions I thought I needed to ask after the procedure. I even rang up my health insurance company to ask them some questions. I think I was intelligible!  So_ so far so good and I'll probably be getting another one in a week or 2 as a follow up procedure.  I'll let you know if I have any on-going problems.,Was great_ even though I knew it was unnecessary_ but this is the only option the hospital offers.

He developed MRSA and several other infections_ had an AV Block and HIT and eventually_ after being discharged_ died from VRE Endocarditis four months later.  This medication should not be used for long term sedation as it can cause hypoxia_ and even brain damage.  It also promotes bacterial growth_ and can cause urination retention.,M,62,30  days,7/27/2007Email,Diprivan
145, 1, colonoscopy,"after a horrible incomplete colonoscopy with Versed_ I made the mistake of agreeing to have one done with propofol....got the same carp about ""you won't remember a thing""....what a load of BS.........terrific pain while the endo nurses joked about my suffering; and the so-called ""crna)"" nurse-anaesthesist..who stood by like a potted plant while I was in extreme pain........what a terrible drug......about like being given a bullet to bite on...........I'll take the bullet.........never_ never again_ any type of ""sedation"" with a nurse.....only an md........",,M,51, ,7/16/2007,Diprivan
146, 5, Endoscopy,NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL!,I was getting food stuck in my throat so I had no choice but do have an endoscopy.  I was beside myself with fear since I have had bad reactions to injections at the dentists office and I have had other bad experiences with different types of anesthesia years and years ago.  I cried the whole way into the room_ once I spoke with the anesthesiaologist he reasured me that he would make things different for me and HE DID.  I was given an IV from 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM to calm me which worked wonders (I was afraid of that too but he knew just what to give me)and then I was taken to the room where they would perform the endoscopy at 8:30 AM...   he injected me a little_ asked me if I hand was hot_ I said no not really and then I was out_ the next thing I knew I woke right up and it was all over.  In my opinion_ for me_ this was simply the best experience with this drug.  I was home by 10:30 AM and feeling fine.  I guess it all depends on different things but this worked for me.,F,49, ,5/26/2007,Diprivan
147, 1, Anesthesia for Upper Endoscopy,Inability to pass urine; grogginess; dizziness,My dad was given Propofol (injection) for a 15-minute upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) [examination of esophagus_ stomach_ and duodenum with an endoscope] in an office setting_ instead of the standard sedation.  He woke up groggy and couldn't hold his head.  Then_ he couldn't urinate.  His bladder was distended but he couldn't squeeze out a single drop.  Fortunately_ he is smart and he drank two cups of black coffee (no milk).  That helped a lot and he was able to urinate.  Yet_ he was not himself for the rest of the day.  He was coughing a lot.  It was a lot of trouble that wasn't worth it.  People_ beware.  Make sure you are not given Propofol (Diprivan) when your procedure doesn't require it.  Tell doctors point blank that you want sedation and not anesthesia.  Propofol (Diprivan) is an anesthetic agent.  Don't get caught like my dad was.,M,74,0  days,3/24/2007,Diprivan
148, 1, Anesthesia for knee surgery,I don't know if my side effects were totally caused by the diprivan because of the various additional drugs administered.  Within 24 hours I developed a chemical taste in my mouth that lasted for 3 weeks.  In addition_ I had severe nausea without vomiting unless I induced vomiting using my finger in the back of my mouth.  I had a dry cotton mouth and eventually became dehydrated since everything I tried to eat or drink tasted so bad and would not pass through my digestive system.  It was as if my stomach was nearly paralyzed.  After a month of this condition my body was feeling starved and dehydrated which affected my heart function.  I had numerous tests and saw my family doctor several times over the period (additional expense).  When I spoke to the surgeon_ hospital_ and anesthesiologist I was told that nothing I had been given during the surgery would cause such symptoms and I should let my family doctor handle it.  They washed their hands of me even though I had warned them prior,This drug and the others administered during the surgery will be on a list that I will carry to hand to any medical personnel as drugs that I cannot tolerate.,F,60,1  days,1/7/2007,Diprivan
149, 5, Hysteroscopy and D&C,I had no side effects with Diprivan. I was given the IV med in the Surgical suite_ was explained to me it might burn a bit at the IV site_ barely burned. I went right to sleep. Next thing I know_ a nurse was speaking with me about waking up. The procedure was finished. They sat me in a recliner_ had some water. I felt slightly sleepy_ otherwise I felt great. Went home_ slept the rest of the afternoon comfortably. The next day I was feeling refreshed. This was the 1st time I ever had this particular drug.,I am also a nurse_ alot of my patients having been given Diprivan_ had positive experiences.,F,46,1  times,12/2/2006,Diprivan
150, 1, Operation,I woke up irate.  I had asked to be awake and alert and instead was given Versed_ which caused me to allow the medical staff to use the rest of their evil drugs to knock me out.  I am still angry months later.  I have experienced a profound change of personality.,I originally thought that the personality change was primarily due to the Versed.  Now I wonder about the Propofol as well.  Why would the anesthesia professionals give a person who wanted basically nothing but pain meds_ not one but 2 drugs that have such severe side effects?  I had informed them that I have a paradoxical reaction to loss of consciousness with general anesthetics_ and yet they gave me the double whammy. ( I also got a whole lot of other drugs) What the sam hill is going on in our medical community?,F,51,1  times,11/25/2006Email,Diprivan
151, 2, oocyte aspiration,Pain!  This drug has absolutely no analgesic affect.  I had about a 10 inch needle going through my vagina into my abdoment/ovary_ and felt every bit of it.  If they don't give you enough to put you all the way out_ your are in trouble.  If they do put you all the way out_ you better be sure they have an anesthesiologist watching you who can keep your airway going.  Lots of deaths in the dentist's chairs from this one.,"Next time I'd make sure I had something for the pain as well as something to make me ""out of it"".",F,41,1  days,11/23/2006,Diprivan
152, 1, biopsies,"I don't know if the bad side effects that I experienced were from the diprivan alone or from a combination of ""twilight"" drugs administered to me for sedation for several biopsies.  The worst effect was the constant awakening after a few seconds or minutes of sleep - it seemed that I would just get to sleep and then I would be jolted awake and feel extreme panic - this cycle (of sleep_ awake_ sleep_ awake_...) continued most of the day.  My pupils were dilated_ and I couldn't bear to look at anybody or anything.  I went back to the emergency room_ and the anesthesiologist said that I had to ride it out.  On the second and third days after the biopsies_ I was dizzy and panicky and couldn't work.  I got so panicky and agitated_ that I took one of my friend's anxiety pills. The fourth day I had double vision in the morning and had a difficult time driving to work.",I do not recommend twilight sleep with diprivan (or demerol or any other drug for that matter) for anyone - it was a living hell.  Insist on a general anethesia that will let you sleep until you feel well enough to be up and about after a biopsy.,F,61,1  times,7/29/2006Email,Diprivan
153, 1, Given IV during eye muscle surgery,Altered mood.  When I was told I could get dressed to leave the surgicenter_ I immediately ripped the patch off my eye and tossed it across the room.  I also ripped up my prescription for Tylenol with codeine and let pieces fall where ever.  I was aware that my behavior was bizarre but didn't connect it to the propofol at the time.,"This was my first experience with anesthesia_ and it was not a positive one.  I was given no information about the nature/side effects of the drug(s) used.  (I found out afterwards.)  The only thing the anesthesiologist said to me was_  ""You healthy?""  The amnesia effect was very upsetting_ and left me feeling violated.  Although my surgery was successful_ I would not recommend the surgeon to anyone.  I strongly feel that informed consent is needed before the drug is dispensed.",F,51,0  days,12/14/2005Email,Diprivan
154, 1, Epidural sterioid injections  back,agitated_ angry_ combative_ upset_ tense_ nervous_ stinging at injection site_ drug was not administered with any other meds to calm me prior to actual sedation.,I had had this medicine before but did not remember the name and I had a bad time with it. I recognized the cloudy milky color of it in the syringe when it was put in my IV.  I had asked the Anesthesiolgist to add Versed and/or Demerol to the syringe so that I would NOT be agitated and nervous both prior to_ during and after the procedure and he seemed to agree with me.  On awakening I felt nothing in the way of calming and was very nervous_ upset and generally agitated and it seemed as though I was ready to fight_ even though my demeanor is that of a calm person.  I do not recommend this medication for sedation during simple out patient procedures at all.,M,48,1  days,9/29/2005Email,Diprivan
