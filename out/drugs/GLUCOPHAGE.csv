Went off BCP to try to have a baby_ and nothing happened for about 2 yrs.  Doc put me on Met to help with ovulation and such.  I had sporatic periods_ and then just didn't monitor them.  I went in for an exray and was asked if I possibly could be pregnant.  I said ""anything is possible"".  Nurse came in and told me I was!  Turned out I was 3 months along :)  That was 4 yrs ago_ and our baby boy is 3 yrs old and healthy.  If you have PCOS and trying to get pregnant with no success_ try this med!

10, 5, ,,I am 28 years old and and was recently diagnosed with PCOS_ although I think I've had it for years and years. I started menstrating at 11! I had such severe cramps that I'd stay home from school and in my mid 20's pretty much stopped having a period and started the most devastating acne:(  I am not pre-diabetic or really overweight (I always have 10 pounds to lose) but I am taking it to regulate my cycle_ possibly clear up my hormonal and cystic acne:( and start to ovulate so one day I can have babies! My fiance is a family physician and was weary about me trying this med because of the side effects but we did some research and found almost definite ways to prevent the gastric and bathroom problems:-Always eat before and a little after taking the med.-Stay away from dairy_ carbs (sugar and flour)-Limit your fruits to only a few a dayIf you stick to this plan you really shouldnt have any drastic side effects:) I have noticed an IMMEDIATE change in appetite and seems it is MUCH easier to eat a healthy diet because the carb cravings are pretty much non-existent!!! Feels like a miracle! I was always always a sugar and carb feen! Felt like it was controlling my life and it was so so difficult to resist junk.  I've only been on it 4 days but really feel like its a life changer! Hopefully it sticks around! I will update again giving it more time:),F,28,4  days500mg 1X D,3/5/2013Email,Glucophage

Now those are pretty much over.,I am not hungry anymore! This is a miracle weight loss drug. I was skeptical but I literally eat maybe 1/3 of what I had before starting this drug.

13, 1, Type 2 diabetes,It turned me into a ticking poop bomb.  I could have sudden and explosive diarea at any time_ as well as constant upset stomach.

14, 3, Type 2 Diabetes,No nausea. However_ 1 week after initial dose_   I noticed some itching on my arm then some spots on my legs.   Now I have some sort of eruptive rash on both legs_ front and back torso.  There is at least one other documented case.,I am afraid I will have to stop taking it.  I feel good. Blood sugar dropped dramatically and I lost 8 lbs the first week.  I hope there is something else that works as well without the itchy_ bumpy rash.

18, 4, PCOS,I've only been on metformin for almost a week now. Im on 500mg a day and gradually working my way to 1500mg a day(3 tabs). The first day I had major diarrhea all day. The next couple days it was only once a day. The past 3 days I havent had one bowel movement_ but have felt major nausea. My appetite has decreased and Ive only been eating because I have to_ not because I'm hungry. Sometimes i'll feel hunger come on but it either quickly subsides when I think about food or I will eat and feel nauseous half way through. Smells also make me nauseous. I'm going to start 1000mg tomorrow_ and we'll see how that goes. It's really too soon to decide whether the drug is beneficial to me but my hopes are high.,,F,27,6  days1500mg,2/21/2012Email,Glucophage

22, 5, Pcos & weight loss & insulin resist,Mild nausea_ horrible migraines NSAIDs didn't help_ complete loss of appetite_ no sugar or carb cravings. I love this medication! My migrains have subsided and the nausea is bearable but the real kicker is the fact that i have absolutely no appetite whatsoever... Everytime i even think about food i feel sick. Thats extremely strange for me considering i used to love food. i guess you could say that i had a sweets/carb and grease addiction. i also used to drink nothing but diet coke and now i can't stand the thought of it... and i quit smoking too! this medication has been a life saver :-),,F,25,1  months2000mg,12/15/2011Email,Glucophage

24, 5, PCOS and weight loss,Horrible diarrhea and vomiting the first few weeks until I realized that I needed to space 6 hours between doses. Now I just have loose stools and the occasional diarrhea.,I love this medicine.  After 4 years of constant weight gain no matter what I did (100 ibs in 4 years) and a doctor that wouldn't help me_ I switched doctors and within 4 days of my first visit she put me on Glucophage.  I have already noticed a big difference.  I'm no longer hungery all the time.  I have much more energy.  My acne has cleared up somewhat and my facial hair is starting to disappear. I find out next week just how much weight I've lost_ but I can already tell that I've lost some.,F,22,4  weeks500mg 3X D,11/2/2011Email,Glucophage
25, 3, Type 2 Diabetes,Mild stomach upset for brief period. Tiredness.,The first day was the only day that I experienced any mild stomach upset and after that I really don't have it anymore. I do however feel very tired. I started on a dosage of 500mg of the extended release form once a day. My fasting number came down_ but not enough so my doc upped it to twice a day. Just started on the 2 pills a day this past weekend so not sure if its working just yet. But just so afraid of feeling this tired every day of my life. I am only 36 and my husband is a young 40. We have no kids_ so I dont think i should be feeling this way at 36. I just want to come home  from work and lay on the couch...but I force myself to cook dinner_ clean up_ and watch some TV. Hubby is great and helps me alot. Thankfully I have someone in my life who cares about me as much as I do. I just want to feel good again. Also_ has anyone ever experienced any hair loss on this medicine? I have very thick and lots of hair on my head_ as do all the women in my family. I just want to make sure it stays that way!!

28, 5, Insulin Resistant/Possible PCOS,Lack of appetite/no sugar or carb cravings (HUGE achievement)/frequent urination,In the past 3 years_ I've gained 50-60lbs for no apparent reason.  My mom has lived with this weight around her waist for years with no explanation.  Finally_ my OB-GYN diagnosed me with Insulin Resistance 3 days ago_ and it seems like I have ALL the symptoms!  I never would have guessed that my acne and severe fatigue could be associated with this.  Anyway_ I am taking 500mg once daily_ and I will continue to add 500mg weekly until 1500mg daily.  So far_ I have not had a BM (which is normal for me because of my severe constipation).  No stomach upset so far.  I have increased urination from 3 times daily to 6 times daily_ and this is hopefully solving my water retention!  I have no desire for sugary or fatty foods_ and my carb cravings are finally something that I can manage!!!  So far I'm quite optimistic_ but I will update in a few days.  Lets hope for some weight loss/regularity/and a menses this month!!!,F,25,3  days500mg 3X D,9/10/2011Email,Glucophage
29, 4, PCOS,In the begining I had the dreaded diahorea_ but the frequency of it has diminished considerably. Nausea from time to time. Reduced appetite.,I like this medication. It has helped me. I was diagnosed with PCOS and am taking the Metformin with Ocella. The first month I had a menses when I hadn't been having it regularly since_ well_ EVER. I have changed my diet to a reduced carbohydrate diet so that is why I believe I don't have the tummy symptoms as most people do. If I drink more than 2 glasses of OJ I get nauseous_ don't know why yet_ but it never happened before I started on the medication_ so I place the reason there. It is very important to reduce junk food and fast carbs and high fat foods when on metformin_ that is the exact reason why you get the tummy issues. The junk food wants to raise your blood sugar and the metformin is trying to lower it. It's a battle in your insides where the drug wins. Messily_ LOL. I have lost weight as well_ about 11 pounds with minimal exercise but I feel I've plataued so I'm going to be going to the gym now. All in all_ metformin is a good drug as long as you are serious with it and change your diet for the better and healthier.,F,25,7  weeks500MG 3X D,9/6/2011Email,Glucophage
30, 4, Insulin Resistance,Tiredness_ headaches_ gas_ loose stools.  Thirsty all the time.

31, 4, To treat PCOS,Horrible nausea_ excessive gas_ stomach pain_ frequent restroom breaks,I was prescribed Metformin after I was diagnosed with PCOS. Over the course of 4 weeks I will go from one pill a day to four a day (500 mg each). I'm currently at day 9. The side effects aren't anything unbearable. I've definitely been through worse. The 2nd day of taking this medication_ I was in the restroom 4 times_ so if you're about to start taking it_ be prepared! I was started at a lower dosage because the side effects would be more harsh if I started out at the 2000 mg. I was told by my Dr. that many people can't tolerate the full 2000 mg a day and they have to decrease it to 1500 mg due to the person constantly being sick. Within the first 5 days of using Metformin I lost 6 pounds.,F,26,9  days500-2000MG 1X D,8/9/2011Email,Glucophage
32, 3, PCOS,Flu-like aches and fatigue for first 3 days,I had relatively few side effects - only mild aching for the first couple days_ which could have possibly just been some kind of cold. I'm taking it for insulin resistance caused by PCOS. My periods are still absent and I still have a small amount of facial hair. It hasn't helped those things_ but hopefully it's keeping my pancreas from having to work so hard at producing insulin. No real side effects so I can't complain_ and it's dirt cheap - $4 at walmart,F,22,4  months500 2X D,6/10/2011Email,Glucophage
33, 5, PCOS,Diarrhea & stomach cramps over the 4 weeks buiding up to the full dose (+500mg per week util I reached 2000mg)...but symptoms were eased with a low carb diet,It has worked wonders for me_ after a few weeks my periods were every 33-35 days (rather than every 3-9 months)...I have lost weight (12 kg to date) but through a low carb diet & gentle exercise rather than the Metformin alone (I think if I upped the cardio & cut back further on the food the results would be more drastic)...I am more energetic and am sure the facial hair is less noticeable....It has transformed my life (and will hopefully enable us to create one in the near future) xxx,F,37,7  months1000mg 2X D,6/9/2011,Glucophage

37, 4, PCOS,Diarrhea_ nausea_ vomiting_ bloating_ sleepiness_ headaches.,I experienced terrible diarrhea_ nausea_ vomiting from this drug_ however_ if you give it the chance_ stick with it for a few weeks_ and get through the side effects_ they subside_ and the results are- for me- ovulation and weight loss.  This is very important because not only are my chances of pregnancy increased greatly_ but my chances for diabetes and gestational diabetes are decreased because of the weight loss.  I suggest it- but you must be patient with the drug.  These are KNOWN side effects.  If you must_ increase more slowly.  For me- it was worth it just to increase more quickly because every increase gave me more side effects_ so better to feel terrible for 2-3 weeks and be done with it.  Than to feel terrible for a week and a half three times for each increase.  I suppose it depends on what you are willing to deal with....,F,25,6  months500mg 2X D,4/7/2011Email,Glucophage
38, 1, PCOS,Nausea_ loose stools_ headaches,I took metformin for my PCOS and never lost any weight. I never had elevated blood sugar levels. I am now unable to eat any meat products due to the nausea_ and am suffering from a severe vitamin b12 deficiency. Since I quit taking to metformin_ I can at least eat what little I can without running to the bathroom. Not sure if this drug caused all my problems_ but beware ob/gyns who think this is the answer to PCOS. Now I can't even touch my hair without if falling out or breaking.,F,36,7  years850 2X D,3/21/2011,Glucophage
39, 4, PCOS/insulin resistance,Diarrhea alternating with slight constipation_ cramps_ stomach gurgling_ headaches_ bursts of energy,I was on this med about 5 years ago.  Had similar side effects_ except for these weird bursts of energy!  It definitely helps with weight loss (the first time I was on it_ I lost about 45 lbs along with diet and moderate exercise)_ which in turn will help lower my chances of diabetes.  And that's pretty awesome because I HATE needles.  It's worth some of the discomfort to me.,F,25,1.5  yearsup to 1500 1X D,3/20/2011,Glucophage

I have had no nausea or vomiting.  I have had some loose stools_ more like regularity.  My face has cleared up some.  I have noticed that sex is not as intense :(  I am not sure about weight loss since it has only been a month.  My period has not appeared as of yet.  My moods have improved and I don't have that terrible shakiness if I don't eat anymore.  My blood sugar (not fasting) was 140 before and now it runs 120 (not fasting).

I'm sleeping better and stopped snoring 3 days after starting.  I know I've lost a few pounds but haven't stepped on a scale in a while so don't have exact numbers.   I do get pretty hungry when it's time to eat but it is a physical hunger.  I'm not suffering fogginess or confusion from highs and lows of blood sugar.  I am very hopeful.

Also_ taking the medication at night between dinner and bedtime helped me. Originally my side effects were so bad I considered going off the drug.  All I can say is stick with it_ it will get better. I still experience the side effects_ but no where near as severe.  I have lost about 8-10 pounds in the last 6 months while taking Metformin (without exercise and without changing my diet).  This medication has reduced my cycle length from 45-70 days to 33-36 days.  However_ I have not ovulated on my own.,F,30,6  months1500 mg 1X D,1/29/2011,Glucophage

Then I upped the dose by 1 more pill in the afternoon and had no side effects. After 1.5 weeks of taking the medication_ I felt back to normal.,I am taking this medication for infertility.

I noticed that the symptoms of upset stomach decreased quit a bit when I cut out or limit my carb intake to one serving of carb per/ meal.  Recently I noticed that the anxiety comes on when the meds peak (around mid-day).

50, 4, PCOS,Occasional cramping and diarrhea_ mostly after eating fatty foods. Decrease in appetite. A few episodes of mild heartburn.,I was very nervous to start this drug because of all the side effects I had read about. I'm terrified of vomiting (emetophobic) so the fear of side effects was quite strong. Overall_ though_ it's not too bad_ and I'm relieved. The cramping and diarrhea can be inconvenient_ and there have been a couple of times that I've stayed home or come home early to be in my own bathroom. One great thing is that I find that I'm not craving chocolate anymore_ and don't really feel like snacking. My advice? Don't be scared by others' side effects_ and give it a try.,F,32,16  days250mg 2X D,12/22/2010,Glucophage

The side effects lasted for just 2-3 days after I started the medicine.,I lost 2 kilos in one month without working out at all. My ovary size (which were bulky otherwise)went down drastically in this one month too.,M,29,1.5  months500mg 3X D,11/13/2010,Glucophage
56, 4, PCOS,slight nausea at times and some diarrhea (once a week at most)_ 5-10 lbs weight loss,I have been taking metformin for 6 months now to try to treat PCOS as my first attempt at treating infertility. Although this medication did not help regulate my cycle_ I don't mind being on it. I feel as though it has regulated my blood sugar_ I have lost a few pounds without trying (always good_ right?) and the side effects have been fairly sporadic and minimal. If only it had worked to treat my PCOS!,F,33,6  months500 MG 3X D,10/22/2010,Glucophage

58, 3, PCOS,loose stool it seems just on the days I up the dose then I am firne_ some stomach discomfort at times.,Started takeing Met about 2 months ago for PCOS. I started out with the 500xr and got up to 1500xr a day.I had no side effects at theat time. I did some research and found Met good for weightloss too! I asked my doc to take me off the XR as I read it's less effective for  the weightloss part and put me on the regular. She did_ now I am taking 1000 in the morning and 1000 at night but I have had no decrease in appitite at all. I only have stomach problems on the day I up the dose then I am fine. Right now I am trying to play with the dosages and take them at different times to see if that helps. Anyone have any insight on the appitite decrease?,F,38,2  months1000 2X D,10/10/2010Email,Glucophage
59, 4, Insulin Resistant/Weight Loss,Constipation_ gas_ bloating_ upset stomach_ loose stools,I started this medication slowly with 500mg for 1 month then moved to 1000mg for 2 months. During this time I have experience slight appetite decrease and actually had some constipation. With my follow up Dr appt she has increased my dosage from 1000mg to 2000mg. I have only been taking this for 2 days now but have experienced looser stools but only in the morning so it doesn't affect my daily routines.,F,34,3  months2000 mg 1X D,9/29/2010Email,Glucophage
