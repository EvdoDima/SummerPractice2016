Went off BCP to try to have a baby_ and nothing happened for about 2 yrs.  Doc put me on Met to help with ovulation and such.  I had sporatic periods_ and then just didn't monitor them.  I went in for an exray and was asked if I possibly could be pregnant.  I said ""anything is possible"".  Nurse came in and told me I was!  Turned out I was 3 months along :)  That was 4 yrs ago_ and our baby boy is 3 yrs old and healthy.  If you have PCOS and trying to get pregnant with no success_ try this med!

10, 5, ,,I am 28 years old and and was recently diagnosed with PCOS_ although I think I've had it for years and years. I started menstrating at 11! I had such severe cramps that I'd stay home from school and in my mid 20's pretty much stopped having a period and started the most devastating acne:(  I am not pre-diabetic or really overweight (I always have 10 pounds to lose) but I am taking it to regulate my cycle_ possibly clear up my hormonal and cystic acne:( and start to ovulate so one day I can have babies! My fiance is a family physician and was weary about me trying this med because of the side effects but we did some research and found almost definite ways to prevent the gastric and bathroom problems:-Always eat before and a little after taking the med.-Stay away from dairy_ carbs (sugar and flour)-Limit your fruits to only a few a dayIf you stick to this plan you really shouldnt have any drastic side effects:) I have noticed an IMMEDIATE change in appetite and seems it is MUCH easier to eat a healthy diet because the carb cravings are pretty much non-existent!!! Feels like a miracle! I was always always a sugar and carb feen! Felt like it was controlling my life and it was so so difficult to resist junk.  I've only been on it 4 days but really feel like its a life changer! Hopefully it sticks around! I will update again giving it more time:),F,28,4  days500mg 1X D,3/5/2013Email,Glucophage

Now those are pretty much over.,I am not hungry anymore! This is a miracle weight loss drug. I was skeptical but I literally eat maybe 1/3 of what I had before starting this drug.

13, 1, Type 2 diabetes,It turned me into a ticking poop bomb.  I could have sudden and explosive diarea at any time_ as well as constant upset stomach.

14, 3, Type 2 Diabetes,No nausea. However_ 1 week after initial dose_   I noticed some itching on my arm then some spots on my legs.   Now I have some sort of eruptive rash on both legs_ front and back torso.  There is at least one other documented case.,I am afraid I will have to stop taking it.  I feel good. Blood sugar dropped dramatically and I lost 8 lbs the first week.  I hope there is something else that works as well without the itchy_ bumpy rash.

18, 4, PCOS,I've only been on metformin for almost a week now. Im on 500mg a day and gradually working my way to 1500mg a day(3 tabs). The first day I had major diarrhea all day. The next couple days it was only once a day. The past 3 days I havent had one bowel movement_ but have felt major nausea. My appetite has decreased and Ive only been eating because I have to_ not because I'm hungry. Sometimes i'll feel hunger come on but it either quickly subsides when I think about food or I will eat and feel nauseous half way through. Smells also make me nauseous. I'm going to start 1000mg tomorrow_ and we'll see how that goes. It's really too soon to decide whether the drug is beneficial to me but my hopes are high.,,F,27,6  days1500mg,2/21/2012Email,Glucophage

22, 5, Pcos & weight loss & insulin resist,Mild nausea_ horrible migraines NSAIDs didn't help_ complete loss of appetite_ no sugar or carb cravings. I love this medication! My migrains have subsided and the nausea is bearable but the real kicker is the fact that i have absolutely no appetite whatsoever... Everytime i even think about food i feel sick. Thats extremely strange for me considering i used to love food. i guess you could say that i had a sweets/carb and grease addiction. i also used to drink nothing but diet coke and now i can't stand the thought of it... and i quit smoking too! this medication has been a life saver :-),,F,25,1  months2000mg,12/15/2011Email,Glucophage

24, 5, PCOS and weight loss,Horrible diarrhea and vomiting the first few weeks until I realized that I needed to space 6 hours between doses. Now I just have loose stools and the occasional diarrhea.,I love this medicine.  After 4 years of constant weight gain no matter what I did (100 ibs in 4 years) and a doctor that wouldn't help me_ I switched doctors and within 4 days of my first visit she put me on Glucophage.  I have already noticed a big difference.  I'm no longer hungery all the time.  I have much more energy.  My acne has cleared up somewhat and my facial hair is starting to disappear. I find out next week just how much weight I've lost_ but I can already tell that I've lost some.,F,22,4  weeks500mg 3X D,11/2/2011Email,Glucophage
25, 3, Type 2 Diabetes,Mild stomach upset for brief period. Tiredness.,The first day was the only day that I experienced any mild stomach upset and after that I really don't have it anymore. I do however feel very tired. I started on a dosage of 500mg of the extended release form once a day. My fasting number came down_ but not enough so my doc upped it to twice a day. Just started on the 2 pills a day this past weekend so not sure if its working just yet. But just so afraid of feeling this tired every day of my life. I am only 36 and my husband is a young 40. We have no kids_ so I dont think i should be feeling this way at 36. I just want to come home  from work and lay on the couch...but I force myself to cook dinner_ clean up_ and watch some TV. Hubby is great and helps me alot. Thankfully I have someone in my life who cares about me as much as I do. I just want to feel good again. Also_ has anyone ever experienced any hair loss on this medicine? I have very thick and lots of hair on my head_ as do all the women in my family. I just want to make sure it stays that way!!

28, 5, Insulin Resistant/Possible PCOS,Lack of appetite/no sugar or carb cravings (HUGE achievement)/frequent urination,In the past 3 years_ I've gained 50-60lbs for no apparent reason.  My mom has lived with this weight around her waist for years with no explanation.  Finally_ my OB-GYN diagnosed me with Insulin Resistance 3 days ago_ and it seems like I have ALL the symptoms!  I never would have guessed that my acne and severe fatigue could be associated with this.  Anyway_ I am taking 500mg once daily_ and I will continue to add 500mg weekly until 1500mg daily.  So far_ I have not had a BM (which is normal for me because of my severe constipation).  No stomach upset so far.  I have increased urination from 3 times daily to 6 times daily_ and this is hopefully solving my water retention!  I have no desire for sugary or fatty foods_ and my carb cravings are finally something that I can manage!!!  So far I'm quite optimistic_ but I will update in a few days.  Lets hope for some weight loss/regularity/and a menses this month!!!,F,25,3  days500mg 3X D,9/10/2011Email,Glucophage
29, 4, PCOS,In the begining I had the dreaded diahorea_ but the frequency of it has diminished considerably. Nausea from time to time. Reduced appetite.,I like this medication. It has helped me. I was diagnosed with PCOS and am taking the Metformin with Ocella. The first month I had a menses when I hadn't been having it regularly since_ well_ EVER. I have changed my diet to a reduced carbohydrate diet so that is why I believe I don't have the tummy symptoms as most people do. If I drink more than 2 glasses of OJ I get nauseous_ don't know why yet_ but it never happened before I started on the medication_ so I place the reason there. It is very important to reduce junk food and fast carbs and high fat foods when on metformin_ that is the exact reason why you get the tummy issues. The junk food wants to raise your blood sugar and the metformin is trying to lower it. It's a battle in your insides where the drug wins. Messily_ LOL. I have lost weight as well_ about 11 pounds with minimal exercise but I feel I've plataued so I'm going to be going to the gym now. All in all_ metformin is a good drug as long as you are serious with it and change your diet for the better and healthier.,F,25,7  weeks500MG 3X D,9/6/2011Email,Glucophage
30, 4, Insulin Resistance,Tiredness_ headaches_ gas_ loose stools.  Thirsty all the time.

31, 4, To treat PCOS,Horrible nausea_ excessive gas_ stomach pain_ frequent restroom breaks,I was prescribed Metformin after I was diagnosed with PCOS. Over the course of 4 weeks I will go from one pill a day to four a day (500 mg each). I'm currently at day 9. The side effects aren't anything unbearable. I've definitely been through worse. The 2nd day of taking this medication_ I was in the restroom 4 times_ so if you're about to start taking it_ be prepared! I was started at a lower dosage because the side effects would be more harsh if I started out at the 2000 mg. I was told by my Dr. that many people can't tolerate the full 2000 mg a day and they have to decrease it to 1500 mg due to the person constantly being sick. Within the first 5 days of using Metformin I lost 6 pounds.,F,26,9  days500-2000MG 1X D,8/9/2011Email,Glucophage
32, 3, PCOS,Flu-like aches and fatigue for first 3 days,I had relatively few side effects - only mild aching for the first couple days_ which could have possibly just been some kind of cold. I'm taking it for insulin resistance caused by PCOS. My periods are still absent and I still have a small amount of facial hair. It hasn't helped those things_ but hopefully it's keeping my pancreas from having to work so hard at producing insulin. No real side effects so I can't complain_ and it's dirt cheap - $4 at walmart,F,22,4  months500 2X D,6/10/2011Email,Glucophage
33, 5, PCOS,Diarrhea & stomach cramps over the 4 weeks buiding up to the full dose (+500mg per week util I reached 2000mg)...but symptoms were eased with a low carb diet,It has worked wonders for me_ after a few weeks my periods were every 33-35 days (rather than every 3-9 months)...I have lost weight (12 kg to date) but through a low carb diet & gentle exercise rather than the Metformin alone (I think if I upped the cardio & cut back further on the food the results would be more drastic)...I am more energetic and am sure the facial hair is less noticeable....It has transformed my life (and will hopefully enable us to create one in the near future) xxx,F,37,7  months1000mg 2X D,6/9/2011,Glucophage

37, 4, PCOS,Diarrhea_ nausea_ vomiting_ bloating_ sleepiness_ headaches.,I experienced terrible diarrhea_ nausea_ vomiting from this drug_ however_ if you give it the chance_ stick with it for a few weeks_ and get through the side effects_ they subside_ and the results are- for me- ovulation and weight loss.  This is very important because not only are my chances of pregnancy increased greatly_ but my chances for diabetes and gestational diabetes are decreased because of the weight loss.  I suggest it- but you must be patient with the drug.  These are KNOWN side effects.  If you must_ increase more slowly.  For me- it was worth it just to increase more quickly because every increase gave me more side effects_ so better to feel terrible for 2-3 weeks and be done with it.  Than to feel terrible for a week and a half three times for each increase.  I suppose it depends on what you are willing to deal with....,F,25,6  months500mg 2X D,4/7/2011Email,Glucophage
38, 1, PCOS,Nausea_ loose stools_ headaches,I took metformin for my PCOS and never lost any weight. I never had elevated blood sugar levels. I am now unable to eat any meat products due to the nausea_ and am suffering from a severe vitamin b12 deficiency. Since I quit taking to metformin_ I can at least eat what little I can without running to the bathroom. Not sure if this drug caused all my problems_ but beware ob/gyns who think this is the answer to PCOS. Now I can't even touch my hair without if falling out or breaking.,F,36,7  years850 2X D,3/21/2011,Glucophage
39, 4, PCOS/insulin resistance,Diarrhea alternating with slight constipation_ cramps_ stomach gurgling_ headaches_ bursts of energy,I was on this med about 5 years ago.  Had similar side effects_ except for these weird bursts of energy!  It definitely helps with weight loss (the first time I was on it_ I lost about 45 lbs along with diet and moderate exercise)_ which in turn will help lower my chances of diabetes.  And that's pretty awesome because I HATE needles.  It's worth some of the discomfort to me.,F,25,1.5  yearsup to 1500 1X D,3/20/2011,Glucophage

I have had no nausea or vomiting.  I have had some loose stools_ more like regularity.  My face has cleared up some.  I have noticed that sex is not as intense :(  I am not sure about weight loss since it has only been a month.  My period has not appeared as of yet.  My moods have improved and I don't have that terrible shakiness if I don't eat anymore.  My blood sugar (not fasting) was 140 before and now it runs 120 (not fasting).

I'm sleeping better and stopped snoring 3 days after starting.  I know I've lost a few pounds but haven't stepped on a scale in a while so don't have exact numbers.   I do get pretty hungry when it's time to eat but it is a physical hunger.  I'm not suffering fogginess or confusion from highs and lows of blood sugar.  I am very hopeful.

Also_ taking the medication at night between dinner and bedtime helped me. Originally my side effects were so bad I considered going off the drug.  All I can say is stick with it_ it will get better. I still experience the side effects_ but no where near as severe.  I have lost about 8-10 pounds in the last 6 months while taking Metformin (without exercise and without changing my diet).  This medication has reduced my cycle length from 45-70 days to 33-36 days.  However_ I have not ovulated on my own.,F,30,6  months1500 mg 1X D,1/29/2011,Glucophage

Then I upped the dose by 1 more pill in the afternoon and had no side effects. After 1.5 weeks of taking the medication_ I felt back to normal.,I am taking this medication for infertility.

I noticed that the symptoms of upset stomach decreased quit a bit when I cut out or limit my carb intake to one serving of carb per/ meal.  Recently I noticed that the anxiety comes on when the meds peak (around mid-day).

50, 4, PCOS,Occasional cramping and diarrhea_ mostly after eating fatty foods. Decrease in appetite. A few episodes of mild heartburn.,I was very nervous to start this drug because of all the side effects I had read about. I'm terrified of vomiting (emetophobic) so the fear of side effects was quite strong. Overall_ though_ it's not too bad_ and I'm relieved. The cramping and diarrhea can be inconvenient_ and there have been a couple of times that I've stayed home or come home early to be in my own bathroom. One great thing is that I find that I'm not craving chocolate anymore_ and don't really feel like snacking. My advice? Don't be scared by others' side effects_ and give it a try.,F,32,16  days250mg 2X D,12/22/2010,Glucophage

Must follow a zone type diet  (a bit of protein and low glycemic at every meal) or get light headed.,I was on Glucophage before it was FDA approved for preventing miscarriage under the guidance of an OB Gyn in the research fertility field.  This is a miracle drug for me.  After years of miscarriages (at least 7) I was able to carry two beautiful children to term and now they are in gradeschool.  All of the side effects are worth it for the use of preventing miscarriage. I have had PCOS for many years.  I did not have any weight problems until after I got assaulted by a stranger and I had lingering Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome and the hormonal effects of it (high adrenaline_ cortisone problems) and in addition my physical injuries from the assault were major so I had great pain and difficulty exercising.  I gained a tremendous amount of weight after the assault.  However I have read that some researchers think that PCOS and stress_ especially great stress like this assault where someone tried to kill me and was not caught and may have been able to come back and find me (prolonging the adrenaline  PTSD response and fear)... can trigger more severe symptoms as far as PCOS and Insulin Resistance.  If there are any researchers in this area who are pursuing this theory you may contact me about stress and PCO_ etc.I discontinued Glucophage after the first trimester in both pregnancies I believe_ it has been a while so I have forgotten.

I'm almost done with this amount perscribed to me and I haven't gotten my period yet and I'm getting worried. I woke up yesterday and today with the most sensitive feeling in my nipples.

Constant pain in all joints; tingling and pain in legs and feet to the point I can't sleep; severe nausea occasionally; definite lack of appetite.  Headaches; cavities; potassium deficiency; fingernails ridged and brittle; hair and skin dry; lack of sleep causing other problems.  How many symptoms due to glucophage and how many to Diovan is up in the air.,Must say_ it worked in the fact that my A1c is within normal range now_ 4.7 being the highest since starting it.  I do the whole shebang/ 6 small meals a day/ limited carbs/ lots of water/ lots of exercise (I eat even though I am seldom hungry.  Very hard to do). Lost 85 pounds in first year.   Diarrhea was awful; every 2-3 days at first.  Called it 'clean out days'; I just didn't leave the house those days. After 3 years it is no longer a problem_ however_ lack of appetite is.  Rest of symptoms making it intolerable.  With Dr. approval I am now seeing an herbalist who specializes in muscleology; she is helping me get off meds a little at a time.

Six months later on a low-carb diet (Allowing a Saturday splurge - though most cravings had vanished) and a 30minute work out once a week I was down to 125. Being a foolish teenager and considering myself cured I went off the medication only to regain the weight and fall into the same slump I had been at 16. 8 years later I'm back on the medication and aside from the metallic taste (Which I know will go away in about a week.)

115, 5, PCOS/insulin resistance,nausea_ bloating_ diarrhea,I was originally put on metformin by a fertility specialist after being diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistance.  When I was trying to get pregnant_ I stopped taking birth control pills and my PCOS symptoms increased dramatically.  I have always been a fairly healthy person- I like healthy food and anjoy being active.  But regardless_ I was usually about 20-30 lbs overweight. Metformin gave me regular periods_ more energy_ a small waistline (size 12-size 6)_ and allowed me to have a beautiful healthy baby girl.  I did have have some very uncomfotable symptoms at first_ but I slowly increased my dose starting from one pill a day with dinner.  The worst symptoms disappeared- UNLESS I WAS EATING UNHEALTHY. One of the ways metformin works is to prevent your body from absorbing all the sugar from starchy food.  If you eat food with a high glycemic index_ that food doesn't get digested by you- it sits in your GI tract and gets fermented by bacteria.  Hence the blaoting and diarrhea.  So if you have a lot of symptoms while taking metformin_ it may be due to eating the food that is contributing to your condition to begin with. ,F,33,6  months,12/2/2009Email,Glucophage

A few hours later I got stomach cramps and explosive diarrhea that lasted about 20 minutes and have had to visit the potty at least 4 times since then. Other than these episodes I'm doing fine. I see my doctor on September 7th for blood work. If all goes well_ she will be increasing the dosage. I am not exercising right now but am pretty active. I'll keep everyone posted on my progress.

Within a week my blood glucose (on a low-carb_ almost no-carb diet) started dropping to almost normal levels. But also_ then came the gastro-int. effects everyone mentions -- and then I noticed the hair loss. This was devastating as I have babyfine hair. I lost 12 kg which was really enough. I cut back to 1 x 500mg tablet per day. The GI symptoms went away_ my bs went up! The hair loss_ after taking $$$$ of supplements_ slightly reversed itself after 12 months!!! But my bs went up.,Unfortunately_ because my last A1C came back as 6.1% (on the edge of normal) I decided to add back another 500g Glucophage ... One tab in the morning_ one at night. I've been back_ therefore_ on 1000mg a day -- and after 5 days my blood glucose has dropped ... and so is my hair: falling out again!!! I'm between a rock and a hard place: either I risk the higher blood sugar_ or I keep my hair. I'm a woman. The choice is simple: I'd rather keep my hair_ which is thin and soft enough. Yikes. (By the way_ I am now on the XR (extended release) tablets. There seems to be no diff. between the 2 types).,F,67,15  months,4/12/2009,Glucophage

156, 1, Type 2 diabetes,Diarrhea.,"Don't believe anyone who tells you that you might experience episodes of diarrhea which will go away as ""your body adjusts"" to this drug.  In my case_ it was the opposite -- no problems at first but gradually over a period of many months I started experiencing episodes of diarrhea.  Eventually it became almost a continuous ocurrence -- I had to always be aware of where the bathroom was everywhere I went.  It got so bad that I even ended up taking Immodium as a precautionary measure every time I got on a plane or took a long car trip. I began to wonder if I had Chron's disease or IBS.  Never related it to the Metformin since I hadn't had problems to begin with.  Then I saw a gastroenterologist who suggested I try stopping Metformin.  Within 48 hours I was totally cured! And have been normal ever since.  This is a horrible drug.",M,60,2  years,4/1/2009,Glucophage
157, 5, insulin resistant,really bad gas...and occasional diarrhea....other then that this pill is a miracle!!!,where do i begin...after not having a period for 3 months i went to my doc for some blood work and found out i was insulin resistant so she prescribed metformin. i take 500 mg twice a day with meals...i have totally changed my eating habits and along with walking every other day i have lost 20 pounds in 3 months! and not to mention my periods are regular again. i have so much more energy...and it has also cleared my acne....its a miracle pill!!!!!,F,22,3  months,3/27/2009,Glucophage

159, 5, newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic,The first day I took the meds I had explosive episodes in the bathroom. I went to the bathroom 14 times in one day with bad cramping and well_ you know.  If I did not get to the toliet in .98 seconds_ I was in trouble. I had read all the posts prior to taking the meds to prepare myself and thought to myself_ oh boy I am in for a ride with these meds. HOWEVER_ the next day I had NO side effects and I have not had any side effects whatsoever since that first day ( I am using the time release XR version),It's been 16 days and I am very thankful and pleased to report that I guess the drug does not produce severe side effects in everyone. My sugar level has come down very nicely together with radically changing my diet and incorporating excersise into my life. Over all I have no complaints and would encourage you not to get overwhelmed by the various reactions because it may not affect YOU the same way.,M,39,16  days,3/13/2009,Glucophage

Still it is the only drug that works better for me.  I take 1000mg twice a day with Amaryl 4mg,I used to take the XR but the reaction was too bad and now take the regular pill.

164, 4, PCOS w/IR,I presently feel really good. I have only experienced 2 negative side effects- 1 being gas that is more prevelant approx. and up to 9 hours after taking. I fill a little bloated but nothing that is effecting my clothing. 2nd would be becoming extremely hungry if I don't eat something around every 2 hours. The further away I get from taking the pill the less prevelant it is_ which I assume is because the meds are working out of the body. On a happy note this is day 4 and show a 5 pd weight loss already.,I am overall pleased with my bodies response to 500 mg once a day. My dose will go up after 7 days then again after 14 days. I only have one concern and that is how quickly the weight is coming off. I have noticed a lack of desire to eat sugary or starchy foods. I don't have a problem eating meals I am just making healhy choices when I do.  I did loose weight from 2002-2004 (60 pds) but it was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. I worked hard labor and exercised a minimum of 1 hour a night with a 1200 cal strick diet. I am now praticing 1500-1700 cals a day low fat healthy carbs little to no sugar. I haven't started exercising yet and will add slowly so I don't overwhelm myself.,F,31,4  days,2/27/2009,Glucophage

I see people with positive experiences on here saying keep on taking it even though it makes you wish you were dead. Um not so much. What good is living if the meds you take make you feel really really bad_ or worse. My doctor has always told me if a cure makes you feel worse than the condition_ then we need to find a different cure. you and the doctor should be on the same team (team you). You and the doctor should actively participate in your recovery not just the doctor. If you feel this is not the case you should change doctors or become more active in your recovery if your not already. Just my opinion.,M,39,720  days,2/23/2009Email,Glucophage

I lost 12 pounds in six weeks and couldn't leave the house without taking a dose of iodium.  I was planning my daughter's wedding during this mess!,I was very angry with the doctors for not believing me when I said it was the glucophage causing the diarrhea!  THey made me take stool sample and other tests for three weeks before everything came back negative for intestinal bleeding_ worms_ or other infections.  As soon as I went off the glucophage_ it all stopped!  Proof enough for me.  Apparently this is a very rare side effect.  I know my body and it told me something was very wrong.,F,56,7  months,11/3/2008,Glucophage

I have not had any discomfort or really negative side effects so far_ but after 6 months I expected to see some more positive effects_ especially with my 1200-1500 calorie low carb diet_ and 40 min workouts 4-5x a week. I also have bilateral lymphedema and am concerned that the met may be negatively effecting that and the lymphedema may be limiting the positive effects of the met.

205, 5, PCOS,loose stools/GI symptoms during first 2 monthsWeight loss,This is a miracle drug for me.  Gained lots of weight over 4-5 months due to PCOS.  First 3 months on metformin and I lost about 25lbs :)  I was already on a controlled diet (1400-1500 calories) and working out (1-1.5hrs 5xweek).  It's like metformin just helped make those efforts actually count for something.  Yes_ it was uncomfortable when I first started taking it.  Stick with it.  You'll be happy in the end.  I take 1000mg 2x day now_ but started with just 500mg 1x week and ramped up over a 4-5week period.  This greatly reduced symptoms.  Initially_ i was given the xr version at 1500mg a day (straight off) and couldn't handle it at all--threw it right back up.  Careful introduction of the regular (non xr) version has been great,F,25,1  years,10/24/2008,Glucophage
206, 3, PCOS & insulin resistance,Diarrhea_ pain in muscles_ joints_ gut.   I had some success fighting the diarrhea with fiber (psyllium husk) supplementation.I just stopped using glucophage because I got scared reading about lactic acidosis because I have been a heavy drinker and now am moderate_ still working on cutting it out altogether.  However_ I think my symptoms were common and not related to lactic acidosis.,I take a heaping tablespoon of PSYLLIUM HUSK twice a day mixed in water.  It was difficult at first_ until I purchased a $20.00 little milk frother (it has a motorized mini wire whisk and is battery operated) at Linens & Things (like Bed & Bath) and it mixes the fiber and water FAST so I can chug it before it gets all lumpy and nauseating (think drinking ground unflavored oatmeal).  Increasing your fiber reduces all the stuff I'm working on:  obesity_ diabetes_ high blood cholesterol_ cardiovascular disease_ gastrointestinal disorders.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fiberLet me know via posting if it helps.  ,F,42, ,10/18/2008,Glucophage

By Dec began to have periods of extreme weakness.  I also have heart desease so went back to Cardioligast and family doc.  They found nothing abnormal in tests and blood work.  Extreme weakness continued.  Returned to diabitis dr. who didn't think glucophage was a problem.  Started eliminating other drugs in a trial and error method.  Still could hardly get out of bed.  Talked with 2 different pharmacist who said glucophage could be the problem.  Stopped glucophage 3 weeks ago - doing insulin coverage for elevated blood sugars.  Change in activity has been amazing - not ready to run a race yet but can play with my grandchildren again.  Seeing endo dr. on Tues.  Will ask for a change in meds.

I thought that maybe it was all in my head_ but after reading this forum I realized that it wasn't.  I could handle the headache and other things_ but the nausea was the worst thing I have ever gone through.  I dealt with it for a week and called the doctor to see if I could do anything different.  I am only on 500 mg a day (which is a small amount compared to many others on here) and he did not want to lower my dosage but suggested that I try taking it at a different time during the day. I was taking it with my evening meal (around 6:00p.m. or so) I would feel fine all evening but when I got up in the morning I was deathly ill.  He suggested that I take it a little earlier and maybe the nausea would hit while I was sleeping rather than in the morning.

248, 4, Type II diabetes,For the first time on this page I could compare my experiences with those of other patients. I was a bit nauseous in the beginning_ but that passed. What does bother me is that the intestinal effects are unpredictable and range from diarrhea to constipation -- and don't take a magnesium supplement at night with your pill!! Oh boy ... you're off to the bathroom 3_ 4 times from about 3am. Explosive. Not nice at all. I also seem to tire far too quickly and I am often sleepy -- side-effects? It would seem so after reading other comments here! I take 1000 mg twice a day_ with meals. I put myself on a high-protein diet and I certainly don't do low-fat anything. My diet is a bit of a problem during the day -- one gets an awful desire for carbs. But my A1C test after 3 months was 5.4%. (It was 6.8% when diagnosed),It does work. But I also take AntaGolin (a South African product_ not medicine_ helps with insulin levels) as well as cinnamon capsules. I am_ however_ VERY WORRIED about the hair loss complaints. I have the impression I'm losing too much hair and wondered why. My hair is baby soft and thin -- can't afford to lose hair! I'd like to cut down on the Glucophage but I don't want to mess up my blood glucose. I've lost 10 kg (about 22 lbs) in less than 3 months and although I'm pleased with that_ I can hardly afford to lose more. Yet I don't have much of an appetite.

I lost both my ovaries to cycsts (13 and 16 years ago) but since PCOS is not a problem with my ovaries but rather a metabolic disorder - I still have the impaired glucose tolerance.

259, 3, PCOS _ Diabetes Type II,Extreme thirst _ stomach cramps _ metallic taste. Alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea. Sometimes so horrible either way I feel as if I'm literally dying. Headaches and tiredness.,"My glucose levels have been running pretty normal. Most times around 90-160 depending on if I am fasting or after I have eaten etc. Since being put on Metformin 5oo mgs 2x daily. I have had reoccuring bouts of painful constipation and extreme diarrhea. Extreme diarrhea meaning 6-8 times in a day. Of the ""explosive"" form at times. Most times leaving my rectum feeling as if someone has yanked my intestines out through it.. Yikes ! A lot of inconveniences _ as I have to stay near a bathroom at all times. I have watched what I have eaten _ and it doesn't really seem to matter most times. I know my husband was on it and he had the diarrhea frequently as well. BUT when he had those episodes his sugar levels were higher. Like around 200 and up. Mine I can have the diarrhea and my level is only 100.

It's now in low 100 range.  Combined with good diet_ excersise_ this drug 'buys' me 'headroom' at the dinner table.  It's not a magic drug_ rather it's an extract from the French Lilac weed.  So_ in a way it's a natural Sugar reducer.  For a Type II that means it's a lifesaver.  Sure there's some discomforts_ but other than injecting insulin it's one of the few drugs to lower BG levels.  It does not increase insulin production_ rather it tells the liver to quit manufacturing glucose.,M,51,30  days,1/9/2008,Glucophage

Erections are not as they used to be and they can disappear quite rapidly.,It is curious that this happens to coincide with taking Glucophage. All was well before I stared taking it.

No gyn. believed the research i presented - ended up going to an endocrinologist_ who sent me for a pelvic ultrasound and did a lot of bloodwork - diagnosed with PCOS this past May - began a regimen of metformin_ starting at 500mg/day_ increased to 1500mg/day.  I want to decrease to 1000mg as I get sick on 1500mg (loose stool with food particles in it_ nausea) - have lost about 10lbs since starting (also went on weight watchers).  feel more energized except when sick - don't need a nap at 3 or 4 anymore_ don't seem to be craving extremes (salty/sweet).

I tried to step down this year and began rapidly gaining weight again.  I have now gone back up a dosage and my weight has seemed to stablize.  In the final outcome I've now gone from taking 4 500mg tables per day to taking 3 500mg tablets per day.   I am hoping that additional weight loss will make me healthy enough to step down further on the medications.  I do a cardio workout 4 to 5 times per week.

After reading this site_ I cut my pill in half and took 500mg in morning and 500mg at night - that seemed to help a little.  Guess I knew that there would be these side effects_ so I was already determined to stick it out.  I did lose about 3 lbs in the first month.  When I increased up to 2000mg per day (1000mg in am & 1000mg in pm)_ I had a little of the loose stools come back but that did not last as long as the first time (maybe only a week for my body to get used to this higher dosage).,I started Metformin at 1000mg in February.  I read on sites like this that some women didn't experience benefits until they went up to 1500mg_ 2000mg_ or even 2500mg.  I also saw a study that showed the same thing - that 1000mg and less didn't produce enough substantial benefits for weight loss and/or PCOS.  Called my endo the first of March and asked that he move me to 2000mg per day (1000mg in morning & 1000mg at night).  Only then did I really noticed benefits.  In fact_ before that I almost stopped taking Metformin thinking it wasn't doing anything except giving me the urge to go to the bathroom.  Only when I went up to 2000mg did I notice a great reduction in sugar cravings and even decreased hunger overall.  Had to actually make sure I ate frequently enough so I wouldn't get too low of blood sugar.  Prior to this I was a sugar freak addict my whole life.

Bile is produced by the liver_ stored in the gallbladder_ and secreted into the intestines in order to absorb fats into the bloodstream. One possible reason for the GI problems is that metformin reduces normal reabsorption of bile from the intestines back into the bloodstream_ which causes elevated bile salt concentrations in the colon.(25) Most studies suggest that colonic bile salts cause free radical damage to DNA and may contribute to colon cancer.In addition_ bile acids may stimulate cells in the colon to produce leukotriene B4 (LTB4)_ a highly inflammatory substance. LTB4 would be a contributor to any intestinal inflammatory condition.(28) Byproducts of bacterial action on bile salts may lead to intestinal cell damage and absorption of ""foreign"" molecules such as food or bacteria particles into the bloodsteam_ possibly causing allergies and other immune responses.

Again_ I would wait till my body adjusts and start taking it 3x per day which is the ultimate goal_ at least for PCOS.  So far I have taken the drug for 8 days once per day.  I am not experiencing any problems and therefore I took it this morning and will again take it tonight thus beginning my 2x per day cycle.

358, 1, diabetes,same as others listed,With the comments on this side. The person eating card board: I suggest you ask your doctor for Humalog insulin_ injected every two hours you can again eat a normal meal. I once could not eat a sub sandwich without glucose of 400 afterwards. I now eat sub sandwiches with no problem. I am not over weight_ I lift weights five days and am hitting 660 pounds on the leg lifts. Doctors and drug companies will continue to convince you to continue with this drug. Don't believe a word. I have achieved great success by usuing Humalog. But you have to work at it. My approach is a hassle_ but you (with discipline) will lead a healthier life_ eat normally and within 30 days_ (of tossing the drug) I felt so much better. Again_ this drug should have killed me_ but I lived by the Grace of God. Not by my doctor's action_ not by a drug company's action_ but by mine. I research daily on the diabetic condition. Few will listen to a word I say. I am not a doctor_ I have no clout and my word is worthles to,M,56,10  years,3/31/2007Email,Glucophage
359, 1, diabetes,I should be dead from using this_ but I tossed it and use only Humalog insulin 11 shots per day. If you have kidney problems_ read the warnings. The warning says it is not for you or me. My anemia cured after stopping this drug use. Vomiting_ gas_ cramps and anemia came. Also lactic acidosis I think likely was happening. Again_ I should be dead_ but I am one of the lucky ones. Did my doctor take me off Glucophage no. I did,It sucks and never should have been approved. A programmed approach of humalog injectings every two hours will make you very healthy and give you normal glucose counts.

I started on two 500 mg doses daily (breakfast and dinner) along with a good low glycemic index diet. Very unscientifically (admittedly) I have found that taking 2 tablespoons of benefiber (or other fiber suppliment) with the meal I eat after taking Glucophage nearly eliminates all symptoms. I know it is counterintuitive to take a fiber suppliment when fighting loose bowels_ but fiber is a regulatory agent and may also form bulk that has (at least for me) mitigated the side-effects of the drug. I did find that when I ate a pint of ice cream there was nothing I could do to beat the side effects. I have lost 8 pounds in two weeks with a couple falls of the good diet wagon (I am worse on weekends).

I have heard that this is a common symptom of PCOS_ however_ I have a feeling that Metformin has contributed to my hair loss. It would be interesting to see how Metformin has affected other womens' hairloss with PCOS_ and to clear any anxieties I have about taking it_ as I know it is still an experimental drug for women with PCOS to take_ and I would rather try coming off the drug and battling PCOS on my own than making things worse (embarrassing conditions like this can destroy your self-confidence) and becoming bald!!!,F,24,3  years,1/24/2007Email,Glucophage

I believe this drug does it's job_ you must do yours and make sure you eat properly and strickly adhere to medication directions.
