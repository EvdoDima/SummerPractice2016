11, 1, to stop itching,I was given Nubain through an IV at a hospital.  I had severe itching_ an expected side effect of an epidural and was told Nubain or benadryl would be suitable drugs to stop the itching. When the nurse admisinistered this drug in my IV_ i immediately felt burning that started in my stomach and spread all over my body. She barely got out of the room and i began shaking uncontrollable and i thought i was going to die.  Luckily my boyfriend was there to call for help because I don't think i could have reached the emergency button on my bed.  The nurse came back and flushed my IV with saline.  She lied to me though and said my experience was not an allergic reaction_ but i was just cold due to the IV flushing my system.  What a liar!! I spent 3 days at the hospital and the only time my IV was flushed was AFTER she gave me Nubain. I have to now tell physicians about my experience and that i'm allergic to this drug. I have never had such a scary experience....this drug should be illegal.  I,,F,30,1  days 1X D,4/20/2014,Nubain

16, 5, Chronic pain I won't take opiates,After many years on opiates I had enough. This has changed my life and this is a very misunderstood drug. Many professionals believe that nubain is a scheduled drug. It is not. They claim its a narcotic. It is not. This is absolutely the best pain medication period. If you are in pain you will get over having to do shots. If not you are An opiate junky. I speak from knowledge. It is to bad that the good ol usa wants us hooked on opiates and that the big pharmas are spreading much misinformation about nubain. And they are causing the shortage. It works for men as well. Please try this drug if you are sick of pAin and the opiates are no longer working. I am back on opiates doing nothing due to the shortage.,,M,43,4  years4 day,1/8/2013Email,Nubain

18, 1, Abdominal pain/Crohn's disease,"As the drug was being injected_ I immediately felt a hot_ burning sensation to my head and back_ followed by cold. Severe agitation set in and I began to get upset. The nurse hadn't even finished the full injection and stopped. Numbness and tingling followed. The pain decreased some_ but the side effects negated this benefit. Now I was in my original pain plus pain all over_ and was agitated_ upset and felt extremely ""weird."" I left the hospital to ""sleep it off.""",Nurse said she'd put in my chart a bad reaction to the drug.

25, 5, chronic migraines,i have been taking Nubain for about a year now...my doctor prescribed the injection along with 50mg Phenergan for my migraines...i have them so often that the ER got to where they would not treat me any longer...apparently they thought i was just wanting drugs and thats not the case...i use it as often as i need and it cures my headache in just a few minutes,does cause irritablility and hyperness with a hard crash later ...thats the only drawback of this medication,F,39,1  years20mg 1X AN,8/15/2011Email,Nubain
26, 5, Migraine,Tired_ makes me want to smoke more.,I have had migraines since I was a teen. I have tried everything under the sun. Even vicodin. I don't see why Doctors are willing to give somthing like Vicodine and not Nubaine. It knocks my pain out very quickly and I have taken this for so long it wears off quickly. It is hard to find a ride to the Doctors and I wish she would just give me a script to do it myself. It is hard not to ask for somthing that works so good and quick. That gets mistakin for being a junkie.,F,36,3  years20 mg 3X M,5/19/2011Email,Nubain
27, 5, Neck Injury,It was amazing! Nothing but super strong euphoric effects. You couldn't wipe the smile off my face. It is strong and will knock out all the pain you may have in your entire body. I wonder why I didn't get this stuff when I had my rhinoplasty/septoplasty. Nothing else takes the pain off of your face not even 10 percocets a day!It didn't hurt to get the injection at all_ I got it and a shot of valium in the hips at the same time.,Wish it came in pill form!

30, 5, Cyclical Migraines,I get a Phenergan shot along with the Nubain due to moderate to severe nausea that usually accompanies the migraines. The shot burns but well worth it as the headache is relieved within 15 min. after shot. The negative is that I loose an entire day due to the opiate effects.  I do have a very blissful sleep off of about 8 to 10 hrs. A welcome pleasure from the severe pain of the migraines.  A slight residual of grogginess following day.,"After migraines started post-meno no other common migraine treatments are as effective as a Phenergan backed Nubain shot!!.

31, 5, Migraine,When getting this shot it does burn like crazy while being injected. But_ after battling a migraine for 5 days this five second burning sensation is nothing. This medicine does work quickly. Within 10-15 minutes I am feeling no pain. After about an hour it makes you very sleepy. I usually sleep 4-6 hours after an injection.,I've battled migraines for over 10 years. After countless trips to the ER_ shots of demerol and several other pain killers_ I finally found one that worked! I get a shot of nubain and phenergen and I am good to go. The end result far out ways any side effects.,F,26,8  years 1X AN,2/23/2010,Nubain

34, 3, migraine,Felt like 10 yellow jacket stings at once_ but just in hip where I got the shot.  6 weeks later_ still feels like I got the shot yesterday and there is slight numbness around injection site.

35, 5, Migraines,extreme agitation.,hard to tell what caused the agitation_ as nubain was one of the last drugs tried. it did relieve the pain and let me sleep for the remainder of the day.,F,34,1  days,5/30/2009,Nubain
36, 5, Migraines,sedation_ euphoria_ polyuria (makes me pee a lot!),This knocks a migraine right out and can be taken IM or intravenously_ but has a tricky side to it. If you are not tolerant to pain medications_ it feels like morphine_ BUT: If you already take Lortabs_ Percocet or anything similar_ the antagonistic effects of nalbuphine will put you into instant withdrawals. Doctors should really ask if you have taken narcotics recently before administering this. I have heard of so many people having bad reactions beacuse of the physicians negligence and blamed it on the medication.,M,23,2  years,2/25/2009,Nubain
