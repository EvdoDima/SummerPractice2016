0, 1, Panic Disorder / Anxiety,"This drug made me insanely sedated. I took it once a day at night for three days_ on the fourth day I took it also in the morning and I could have fallen asleep standing up. Same for the next two days. I stopped taking it during the day because I fell asleep at my desk. It wasn't something caffeine could fix either. My heart would be POUNDING and I'd be jittery but could literally close my eyes for 2 seconds and be asleep. Cannot live like that. I started taking my dosage in the middle of the night (1 am) so that I could sleep off the drowsiness (it only really effected me for the first 3-5 hours after taking it)_ but after I upped my dosage I started getting tense jaw_ teeth grinding and shaking. I was also getting involuntary muscle movements and did my research about tardive dystonia/dyskinesia and promptly decided to get off it. I do NOT reccomend this drug... it makes you feel very ""drugged"" and you can tell when 12 hours between doses is up because you start feeling w",Controlled anxiety_ terrible side effects.,F,28,10  days20 2X D,7/28/2016,Geodon

3, 1, bipolar depression,This is the worst medication I have ever taken. Took me four miserable years to figure out that this was of my gut wrenting depression. For the first year it was fine. Then I became paranoid_ convinced everyone hated me_ lost all my friends. Then the dystonia started (when your muscles are tight and you can't control them) it was in my left leg right arm and face. I had no good emotions_ no matter what. I found it so hard to smile_ not to mention the anxiety of the charts_ I was almost agrophobic. . And I was so lazy and enjoyed nothing. Not to mention I gained 100 lbs. But wait_ it gets worse... I am currently tapering off this medication onto abilify and it is pure hell. I can't breath_ I can't focus_ I can't sleep. My Dr had to put me on benzetropines_  that's now another addiction battle I'm going to have to fight.,I swear_ dress are paid to push this drug. There is no other way that a drug with this many side effects and down falls would be prescribed @ such doses to completely unsuspecting people who are just looking for help.

4, 1, Bipolar Depression,Shortly after start_ had episode of forgetting how to drive (middle of traffic on interstate)_ felt like I was coming out of skin_ couldn't sit still_ jumping from one side of sofa to other_ couldn't walk_ shaky. Unfocused. At. most times_ walked slowly with shoulders hunched and mouth hanging open. Lost memory,This drug took my life. I've been off of it for a year_ now. The sad thing is_ my side effects remain! Constant right hand tremor. I WAS an artist_ with beautiful handwriting. No more. Still have severe memory loss. Still experience feeling of needing to get out of my skin. Severe anxiety. Mild OCD. Can't stand clothing to touch me_ at times. Extremely debilitating depression. That's just a glimpse. Mental issues...due to past use_ or just my own??? The memory loss and tremor_ I can say_ all Geodon. For seven years I took it_ faithfully_ to stop crying. Well_ I didn't cry for 7 years! Not even when my only_ baby sister died unexpectedly! Not when others I loved died. Not when terrible things happened to my kids. Many times_ I had NO idea of what was going on in my own home! Not only did it stop my crying_ but it took away laughter. Any ability to live was lost. Mostly_ I isolated_ and still do. I have 5 kids. Most of their events_ I missed. I can never get years back! The tears have returned_ but the joy is elusive. I can't imagine choosing to take Geodon_ knowing what I do now! If I were not God's child_ saved thru the blood of Jesus Christ_ I'd have strongly considered suicide. It's THAT BAD! One good thing is_ my withdrawal. I was taking 3 capsules a day. Weaned myself. First_ a week or two of 2 a day_ then_ down to one. It wasn't at all difficult for me to stop that insanity! I only wish that the changes it made in me were not permanent.

This really upset me because my doctor knows how much my weight gain concerns me; so what does he do?!  He prescribes Geodon which clearly has weight gain as a side effect.  I'm quite peeved with him right now.,Be your own advocate.  Do your homework on any meds prescribed.  My mistake was that I trusted my doc too much.

It's not like normal anxiety it's like a panic attack is trapped inside my head trying to push its way out and it is literally driving me crazy. My breathing is calm and my heart rate is normal when it starts. It usually starts around 5pm. I'm taking kilonipin but that only takes the edge off of it.

This is my first night without it and I feel almost normal again. I stopped cold turkey and I'm a little afraid there will be withdrawals but I'm willing to risk it so that I can stop feeling as down right terrible as I did while taking this.

11, 4, Bipolar ll,30 pound weight gain.,I'm sorry to read the severe side effects others are having. I take geodon for racing thoughts and irritability. The geodon has taken these issues away completely. I actually handle high stress situations much better than I thought possible. I switched to geodon in hopes of reversing the weight I gained from seroquel and saphris.Unfortunately if a med. has weight gain as a side effect I apparently am going to just gain weight. My pdoc suggested tegretol might help reverse the weight gain but I have read scary reviews about that med too.I take 150mg of lamotrigine daily as my mood stabilizer and it has been great for my depression. I've taken this for 10 years with no side effects.,F,47,2  years40mg x2 da,1/2/2016,Geodon
12, 1, Bipolar,Nose bleeds_ Migrains_ weight gain_ anxiety_ oversleeping_ tiredness_ memory loss still trying to figure out the damage...,I was put on geodon at age 9 to treat my bipolar. It was paired with lexapro to treat depression. I am now almost twenty and have taken myself off of both medications. I started taking myself off as soon as I turned eighteen.  Since being off I sleep better. I feel more alert and aware of my surroundings. I was forced into taking this medication. When I stopped I felt as though I woke up.. I have no anger or depression. I do however have mild anxiety attacks. This medicine has made my life extremely difficult. before my diagnoses i was diagnosed with several other disorders (Asperger's_ adhd_ schizophrenia )and was put on various other medications from a young age. I was bullied and grew up in an abusive household. The other medications made me do really strange things. I was taking geodon before I slept at night. if i was out of it or I forgot it I would have extreme withdraws. I am now concerned about my organs and my heart after being on this medicine for so long. It was unnecessary and did nothing but hurt me in the long run. I beg any one reading this to never put any one under the age of eighteen on this medication. It is too strong and causes to many horrible side effects that can and will do permanent damage. I have never felt better then I do now being off of this stuff. I am not saying your kid doesn't have a disorder or will be mis diagnosed like I did; however the brain is not fully developed at that age. being mis diagnosed is a real possibility.

13, 2, Mood Disorder_ Psychotic Episodes,Irritability_ rage_ loss of motivation_ headache_ nausea_ vomiting_ dry mouth_ Dysphagia (had trouble swallowing at times),I'm writing this on behalf of my boyfriend. He was first on rispiridone which did wonders for him but he was bothered by the facial drooping and slurring of speech so his doctor put him on this crap. It helps him a bit but he becomes extremely irritable and sometimes rageful and will pick fights for no reason. He gets sick a lot on this medication and gets headaches and dry mouth. This causes him to miss school and he's already missed a lot this year. He also has panic attacks where he has trouble swallowing and that Dysphagia side effect made it worse. The only reason I'm giving it a 2 is because it helped his psychotic episodes a bit. It did NOTHING for his mood_ in fact it made it worse. I was hoping this would help him put on some weight like the rispiridone did since he's a bit underweight but it's just made him sick. He stopped taking it and had withdrawal side effects from it too. A very poor choice for medication.,M,18,2  months 1X D,12/29/2015,Geodon
14, 4, Anxiety with Aspergers,"Greatly_ massively depleted ""will-power"" to accomplish even desired activities.",My son was diagnosed with Aspergers and Generalized Anxiety at 6.  By 9_ his outbursts led us to Geodon. It helped_ but left difficulties the psych blamed on anxiety...  He needed help to get to school_ a party_ a movie_ brush teeth_ tie shoes_ do homework. etc.  This went on 6 years.  He is now 15 and has been in 11 schools - private_ home_ co-op_ and public. He was banned from some; we left others. His anxieties controlled our family life.Then_ 7 months ago_ we stopped Geodon. Amazingly_ our child came to life: eating new foods_ laughing_ becoming more animated_ taking new initiatives_ and never doing worse than with Geodon. His WILL returned and was now stronger than his anxiety. We withdrew from the private school for children with learning disabilities and re-enrolled in the public school that had started truancy proceedings 11⁄2 years earlier.Now_ halfway through the school year_ he gets himself up and dressed_ has never been late_ has changed all of his classes to advanced placement_ controls his frustrations_ and his dull_ uninvolved look is gone. He is animated and expressive making real friends.SUMMARY: Geodon was a lifesaver when our child was young. But as he matured_ the medicine continued to suppress his will. His psychiatrists never connected his school and life troubles with the medicine. We should have stopped Geodon earlier.

23, 5, depression and motivation issues,The first time I took Geodon I had this weird side effect. About 20min after taking it I felt suddenly severely depressed and suicidal. I started crying for no reason then laughing. My heart was beating really fast and it got worse to the point where I called 911 because it was pounding so hard I thought I might die. Everything turned out fine and I didn't end up going to the hospital but I stooped taking it for this reason to later on trying it out again.  If I hey overly excited/scared my heart will beat to fast and sometimed I get heart palpitations but I think I've got it under control now To where it's not a major problem anymore but a side effect that had gotten better over time.I also have 0 appetite. I had to lower my dose to 40mg because I couldn't physically eat. I was gagging on anything I tried eating even something small. I went back up to 60mg recently and it's been better but I am never hungry. I continue to lose weight which is nice but I'll have to watch out if I get too low.Another reason I don't eat much is because it make a me feel nauseas. My stomach seems weaker and can't handle much of anything besides water. I feel mild nausea after eating a bowl of soup and a piece of bread.,Keep a close eye out when you first start taking Geodon or when you increase it. Everyone I increase the dose I get a severe side effect. Sometimes you have to stay at a lower dosee for your body to get use to it so don't rush with it. I had severe anxiety/feeling like I was jumping out of my skin when I increased my dose. Don't let a bad side effect stop you from taking it if it's helping. Talk with your doctor about it. Also I feel dehydrated a lot so make sure your drinking enough water.,F,23,2  months60mg,4/24/2015,Geodon

25, 1, Mood disorder/ depression,-UNIMAGINABLE FATIGUE-low blood pressure-fainting -restlessness-dizziness/ disorientation,PLEASE DONT SKIP! My Dr. Put me on this on top of other meds to help with hopeless thoughts. I took 40mg at night and about 30-40 seconds when I woke up the following morning I felt extreme shaking and restlessness. I had to get up to go to school and the second I got up I was really dizzy and disoriented. I went to use the bathroom and I knew something was wrong because I could see black spots and felt like I was losing control of my body. I tried to call for help and tried to lift myself up with a towel hanger but it broke just as I was BLACKING OUT and hit my head on some marble. My dad is a Dr. and said the medicine can cause a SIGNIFICANT drop in blood pressure for some people. By the time I was able to lay down again I physically/verbally could not communicate or move. Another red sign was knowing that my eyes WOULD NOT STAY OPEN no matter all my will power I gave to get up due to the fatigue. I couldn't go to class I woke up in the late afternoon. I am a light sleeper and this put me out DEAD COLD even though I took it the night before. This pill will knock the hell out of you and I'm in college I can take tired this was NOT THAT. This level of exhaustion can only be felt because of something like this and I hope no one has to feel what I felt! PLEASE consider another form of medication before trying this!

26, 1, Bipolar Disorder,I was suicidal and severely depressed. Was started of Risperdal and Trazadone. Risperdal has so many law suits it's crazy. I stopped that drug. Was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on Geodon. Best thing I ever had for 3 weeks. I was extremely functional and able to experience joy again after months of darkness and depression. Then I missed a dose. The very next day I was suicidal again. I was depressed all over again. I stayed off for a few days before starting it again. I needed a fix. I started again and things got a little better but not much. I would still have manic phases and urges. This past Wednesday I missed a dose. I also missed Thirsdays dose. Friday I started getting strange sharp pains atop my head followed by dizziness and and elevated heart rate. I was hauled off in an ambulance with a blood pressure of 198/113. I thought I was dying. I had 5 panic attacks this past weekend and visited the hospital 5 times. Finally having a CT scan that was clear. I was also placed on BP meds. It's Monday and I'm plagued with a feeling of water running in my head. I feel itching in my head and forehead. Also burning. All accompanied by headaches. I'm tAking Ativan to help me calm down.

I also have my appetite back which I know I need to be careful about.

41, 1, PTSD_ Major Depressive Disorder,"I am 50 years-old. When I was 46 years-old_ Geodon caused major anxiety beyond anything ever experienced.

It almost killed me. The doctor told me she never heard of those side effects so she increased the dose! Unable to think_ I took it.

46, 1, Bipolar 2 Depression,,I was given Geodon as a Hail Mary when nothing else worked to relieve my bipolar depression. Zyprexa does work well but it caused metabolic syndrome and I had to discontinue its use over 2 years ago. I do take 750 mg. Of Depakote and 100 mg of Zoloft for basic maintenance. The first day after my first dose of taking Geodon I was driving home from a baby shower and felt like my eyes were finally open again - the world was beautiful and I loved my life! I felt expansive and so positive and decided to pop into a piercing parlour to get my nose pierce! Anyway that was the start of 5 weeks of intense mania -- spent money I didn't have_ argumentative_ decided to feng shei my whole house_ couldn't sleep_ talked incessantly_ sounded like jets flying through my head and I started lying and being sneaky. I just thought I finally had come out of my depression....unfortunately my driven behaviour felt so agitated and uncomfortable and my family became concerned. I was honest with the psych doc but he didn't associate the mania with Geodon and instead cut back my zoloft to 50 mg. And wanted to decrease depakote. Well I continued to spin into mania - having 4-5 lists going no at one time and so much to do! He took me off Geodon 3 nights ago and immediately the mania was gone (along with a few thousands of dollars!) and now the normal struggle of depression has taken hold again...,F,56,5  weeks40 MG 1X D,6/2/2014,Geodon

Terrible withdrawl symptoms with each decrease. Took a couple months to settle out with each decrease. At 20 mg noticed some anxiety but have stuck it out and switched to decaf coffe which helps. Tried to go completely off and 3 days later my vision was so blurry I could not see well. Had a hallucination when I looked into the mirror. Also felt out of body feelings. I went back on the 20 milligrams and went back to normal. No more hallucinations and my vision went back clear. My phychatrist says he does not understand how only 20 mg would do anything at all but I am living proof that it does. I know what I saw when I went off of it.

I would sit around and think about everything that I did wrong from when I was younger to today. I guess it's a form of OCD. It is also prescribed for my depression. I am taking cymbalta for my anxiety.  This medication is great. I can look at things differently now. My thoughts are still there_ but I can stop myself and realize what I am doing_ and I can turn those thoughts around into more positive thinking.  I use to sleep a lot during the day. Sometimes I feel a little sleepy during the day but I do not sleep during the day anymore. This is a great thing! I am actually up doing things. Seeing the sun_ hanging out with my friends_ having a life. I have not had any hunger for sweets on this_ or any weight gain. I was on mirtazapine before geodon and I was hungry all of the time on mirtazapine.  On geodon I'm no longer craving just sugar. I am hungry but I'm hungry when I am suppose to be. I now can make good food decisions and eat the right thing because I am no longer hungry for just sugar. On mirtazapine I gained about 21 pounds. Since being on Geodon I have lost those 21 pounds plus more! I love this medication. I am active now and it has been easier for me to get over things that are negative. All the medication I've been on has made me gain weight_ and I've only been on this for 4 weeks_ but so far I am losing. Now I hope that the weight will stay off.

I had horrible anxiety and could not sleep.  I also had a horrible rash on my face.  I lost 30 pound in 3 months.  I finally had to go back in the hospital and change my meds.  I continued to take the drug until I had to stop_ because I liked thinking clearly. I have to admit_ it helped me get to where I am today and that is better than I have ever been.

70, 2, Psychosis,Drowsiness_ akathisia_ extrapyramidal symptoms_ lack of appetite,I've been on olanzapine_ seroquel XR and risperidone before and they kept the symptoms of psychosis away but caused significant weight gain. I tolerated them well however. In hopes of losing some weight i was switched to ziprasidone. From the first dose i felt it is a different drug. More potent and aggressive. I was initially dosed with 40mg x 1 but it was increased up to 100mg x 2 eventually. I've experienced an outbreak of psychosis through seroquel 800mg which explains the unually high dosage of ziprasidone.   In the beginning i had mild akathisia and it only got worse as my dosage was increased. It didn't occur at night time because i was able to sleep but 2 hours after the morning dose with meal was plain hell to me. When you're at work where you've got to concentrate and deal with a lot of people the last thing you want is bad akathisia. Now i take 140mg once daily and can live with it but i'm about to go for another medication soon. I also have experienced muscle rigidity_ especially in my jaws_ tremor in my legs and slight difficulties to swallow sometimes. I think the older antipsychotics have some similarities with ziprasidone's side effect profile especially with motor side effects. For others this drug may be more tolerable but i'm done with it.,M,29,2  months140 1X D,9/1/2012Email,Geodon

I took this medicine one time at night before bed and woke up the next morning in pain.  My muscles were stiff and sore.

I would be forced to look up or to the sides and couldn't get my neck to move back into its normal place because it would snap back.  It made me very anxious and frightened because this had never happened with any other medication.  One of the house parents took me to see the ARNP on an emergency appointment and she diagnosed me as having medication-induced dystonia.  She prescribed Benzatropine and took me off the Geodon.

No problem now after almost 4 years taking it.,"I left a comment rating this drug years ago on this site when first started taking the medication and I gave it a rating of 5 because I didn't know then the weight you lose when switched to geodon from another antispychotic (risperdal in my case) doesn't stay off. I ended gaining all the weight back plus 10 lbs more than on risperdal but that doesn't seem to bother all the chicks that flirt with me when I go out to places and I have no complaints about that. I workout regularly (weightlifting_ walking on the treadmill) and I can fit into size ""L"" shirts instead of ""XL"" shirts like when on risperdal so I guess that's what doctors refer to geodon as being more weight neutral. I had my doctor reduce my dose from 160mg to 120mg because I felt no difference and noticed I lost 2 inches from chest and waistline in 4 weeks_ but the weight remained the same. On my previous post I wrote that my sex drive had been enhanced when switched to geodon but like with any antispychotic_ it slows you down and I mention slow down because I still keep my sex drive way better than while on risperdal_ drug which actually ceased my sex drive_ can't remember_ I also have no complaints about that.

He promised it would help me be able to get the weight off that Zyprexa and Risperdal gave me.  I had always been small size 5 or 6; But my husband had to buy me bigger and bigger sizes_ and he was getting mad.  I ate but one meal a day exercised when I could. (Not throwing up or feeling sick; not hurting all over my body etc. etc....) I ate less and less now only vegetables ; nothing helped. My Doctor swore it wasn't the Abilify it was me.  I went up to 275 lbs. and was so depressed I just wanted to die.  So I found someone else who let me try Geodon and I love it so very much.  No more deafening whispers all those voices whispering as loud as they could about me.  I couldn't even drown them out no matter what I tried. GONE. :)  The people and things I saw but everyone around swore they couldn't.  Still working on that; though not as bad.  Paranoia not as bad I feel. Still working on that. I've been on Geodon for almost a year and I've lost weight last time I was weighed Oct. 2011 I was 170 lbs. And I'm going back down through the sizes of my clothes. Good thing I'm a pack rat. :)  I can go out and eat again without having to hearing someone call me a pig or go on how disgusting I was.  It's been so long that I've felt actually good about myself.

I took the 80 mg on Thursday night and had to pull myself out of bed Friday morning. By Friday afternoon I was in full blow side affect mod. It honestly scared me. I only took 40 mg on Friday night and woke up Sat after sleeping 12 and a half hours.

115, 1, Bipolar Depression,Geodon caused the worst anxiety and panic attacks I've ever experienced. It was dangerously severe. I could not think clearly and became nearly paralyzed in fear and panic and anxiety. Songs set off anxiety_ or an advertisement on TV_ or almost any minor trigger will set off HORRIBLE anxiety. It is not attached with anything. It just happens. Furthermore_ I had two 7 year-old dachshunds that I had to give away because I needed to go to a hospital because of Geodon.  There was no one to watch them for me_ so I had to find a loving home for them to go to. I lost my dogs because Geodon left me in an absolute panic with anxiety and fear for no reason at all. Now my dogs are gone forever.  I want Geodon out of my system immediately.,I quit taking Geodon cold-turkey. I want it out of my system. Withdraw symptoms include sweating_ anxiety_ panic_ fear_ confusion_ sweating palms_ heat-flushing of the face_ trembling_ nausea. Although this drug works for others_ it did not work for me. I consider it dangerous.  I also lost my appetite and lost 15 pounds in 3 months.  I only weighed 133 pounds_ and now I weigh 118 pounds.  Geodon also caused heart palpitations.

I would go mixed/manic if I went off it. It doesn't help at all with the soul-crushing depression though. I have to take lithium and wellbutrin to smooth the depression out some. I've tried going off Geodon in the past and I was manic within 2 days. So I NEED Geodon and it works well for me. Everyone reacts differently_ so don't avoid Geodon just because of the bad ratings.

124, 1, Psychosis and racing thoughts,A HORRIBLE drug! I was taking this in March/April of 2010. The side effects were the worst thing I have ever experienced in my life. I was constantly cold_ had horrible uncontrolled muscle clenching in my arms and legs that lasted around the clock for days. I could barely sleep due to the symptoms. I was sweating uncontrollably. I had anxiety on a massive scale and even something as simple as listening to a North Korean propaganda song on YouTube caused me to have a panic attack (I am not joking about that either). My dreams also were enough to cause extreme anxiety/panic attacks. Had no appetite whatsoever. I could barely even drink anything. The symptoms lasted for a week after taking the medication.,The doctor_ instead of putting me on the lowest dose and see how it would effect me_ had the wisdom to put me on a high dose of a drug I had never taken before. I have since stopped seeing that doctor. Be VERY careful with this drug! This drug can be dangerous to people such as myself.

129, 4, Bipolar II_ Depression.,My experiences during the first 2-3 weeks were very different than the latter 2-3. This may be in part because I lowered the dose on the 4th week.  For me_ Geodon had severe sedative qualities. It was scary_ but it got a little better after a couple weeks_ and once I learned to take it with a full meal_ the drowsiness completely subsided.  I experienced a lot of pain and tension in my wrists_ as well as numbness/clenched-feeling in my hands and fingers during the first week or two_ but that's mostly gone away now.  On the higher dose I occasionally had 'strange thoughts_'  or felt that others were acting in very strange or confusing ways.  These thoughts intensified at night_ and especially around the 3rd week and I felt very agitated_ depressed_ upset_ and scared that I was 'going crazy.'  That all said_ my doctor had tried me on Lamictal_ Abilify_ Seroquel_ Lithium_ Zyprexa_ and then Geodon consecutively in a period of 5 weeks. So_ I'm not a doctor but I believe that my body was in a,I had been taking Lamictal for about a year when it suddenly stopped working. It had been a miracle drug with no side effects_ and suddenly I became severely depressed and simultaneously manic. It was unlike anything I had experienced before taking it. I tried a lot of medicines_ and experienced the extreme opposite of the usual side effects.. (ex. severe insomnia and unable to eat on seroquel.) I finally tried 80mg of Geodon and it worked brilliantly at first_ possibly a placebo effect_ but then after 2-3 weeks I felt fairly depressed again and the side effects got too intense. Then I lowered it to 50 mg. (one 40 mg_ plus 1/2 of a 20mg) and added a little bit of lamtical back and things have been going well. For me_ Geodon is not really an antidepressant_  nor does it completely quell my manic episodes. I have to consciously work to suppress my weird tics and negative thoughts_ but before Geodon I couldn't even recognize those habits as being abnormal. It lifted me out of whatever episode I was in_ and my body completely adjusted around week 4 and got rid of most negative side effects.  Except_ someone mentioned greasy hair and I've been experiencing that too! I just didn't attribute it to Geodon.  It's the only thing that's worked for me_ and even though I usually adjust to medicines rapidly_ I definitely advise giving Geodon a little extra time.,F,18,5  weeks50-80MG 1X D,2/24/2011Email,Geodon

Then started having VERY strange thoughts_ emotions_ overreactions_ getting a little hysterical_ had a panic attack and had a lot of anxiety.,At 3-4 weeks is when the drug fully kicks in and my psychologist suggested that because this drug is really for schizophrenia which I don't have_ that sometimes at the 3-4 week stage it can actually start to cause symptoms of this instead of fix whatever else you have. Im going off it today! Have felt like Im losing control of my mind_ not fun. Not an awful drug_ just hasn't worked out to be the right one for me.,F,33,4  weeks20MG 1X D,1/12/2011Email,Geodon
139, 1, depression,I think that this medication was dangerous for me_ as I developed severe headaches and nausea. To be fair_ it was started after a cold turkey stop to Seroquel 300mg.. Therefore I can't pin the blame on stopping the Seroquel or starting the Geodon_ but the result was a deathlike experience. Deathlike in that I wanted to die_ because the migraine type headaches and nausea were severe enough to not want to wake up in the morning_ when I would hope upon hope that these side effects would cease_ but they just continued to get worse. I'm back on the Seroquel_ which I stopped because my food bills were getting out of hand. Consequently_ I'm in a terrible position of having to go back to the drug that gives excessive food cravings and dramatically increases my arthritus pain_ but is far less of a problem then the headaches and nausea. I could only say that for me_ maybe not you as we all have our own individual reaction to medications_ don't start it until you exhaust other possibilities. I wi,I would suggest reading Manufacturing Depression. It is a book that talks about the pharmaceutical companies getting approval for drugs that have little efficacy and the fact that the incidence of being tagged depressed or otherwise mentally ill  are nothing more than guesswork and is not science. Put ten psychiatrists to the test of prescribing medication and you'll get ten different diagnosis'. The DSM5_ the psychiatrists bible_ has been delayed_ because one of the panelists has come out and said that being diagnosed as mentally ill is not a proven fact and that our children_ who's brains are developing are going to suffer substantial future effects by using the ADD_ etc. pharmaceuticals_ which likely will impair them and make them addicts for life. Keep your children off all drugs that alter their brains if possible. By the way_ we are all sad and over-stimulated in our lives and that doesn't make us wear the badge of being diagnosed as mentally ill.,M,64,45  days60mg 1X D,1/1/2011Email,Geodon
140, 4, Bipolar I Disorder,hand tremor and uncontrolled tongue movements,Geodon is a great drug for me.   It controls my mania and auditory hallucinations.

141, 2, Mixed Bipolar Mania,I felt good for about three or four days. I now_ again feel confused easily_ poor memory and concentration_ restless_ I black out when I sleep and lose time_ I Sleep more than I wake_ GERD and terrible painful swallowing_ nausea due to the painful GERD_ shakiness when I miss my dose.,I liked it for a few days and I still like the fact that my moods are seemingly more stable. I work my butt off to keep good and to do what I need to do and was given this on a recent trip I took to the ER for mania uncontrolled. I stayed overnight and felt a lot less agitated and aggressive in the morning. Now I take it at 9 or 10 am and pass out cold by 1pm. This is not okay. I have a three year old. The severe tiredness just started four days ago and fortunately things have been okay when I wake up_ which can be hours later. I am going to taper this drug down to 20mg at bedtime and see if that doesn't solve things. The GERD is so painful I can't seem to get relief. Probably buying Prilosec OTC to see if that will help. The confusion and inability to concentrate are not okay either. They are the biggest factors behind getting on meds in the first place. Love the weight loss_ hate the drug. Wondering if just getting some ativan again may help? Lamictal too? I don't know. FRUSTRATED.,F,24,2  weeks20mg 2X D,12/16/2010,Geodon

I took it at night_ before bedtime_ but I do know that it makes me feel very zombie-like...BUT doesn't help with sleep. It did nothing to stabilize my mood. Topomax works better. The only things it has done is give me bouts of anxiety like the four horsemen of the apocolypse are after me_ give me tremors like I have Parkinson's disease_ make my hair fall out in clumps_ and change the texture of my hair to this ""greasiness_"" that will not wash out no matter how many times_ or with what shampoo I use! I used to have long healthy-looking hair and it's just crazy that medicine can affect your hair like that. I take Prozac and Adderall during the day and did not experience ANY of these side effects until I started with the Geodon.

148, 1, Misdiagnosis of bipolar/schizophren,This drug will kill you- especially if you are a young and small. Im 20 years old and 100 lbs. I was taken to the hospital because I had been drugged at college- they found out there was LSD and other barbituates in my system (Im not a druggy- someone had drugged me). Instead of testing my blood levels_ they thought I was schizophrenic or strongly bipolar - put me in a psych ward and injected me with geodon and later made me have the pills twice a day. It was killing me- I had tremors_ dizziness_ 25 lb weight gain in 2 weeks_ dry mouth_ slurring_ depression_ heart racing_ racing thoughts_ shortness of breath_ tightness in my chest. The doctor I had just wanted to make money and keep me on this drug_ - a good doctor would have taken me off. I knew if I took it any longer_ I would die- so I stopped taking it. Finally I was cured when I stopped- because there was nothing wrong with me. For those of you that do have something to treat- take another medication to help you- not geodon. Dont,Make sure to get second opinions when taking this drug. Do not take it if you are petite as it is muchh stronger and medicine has yet to adjust dosage based on weight/size. Make sure to get blood tests and further testing done before taking this drug to make sure if it is right for you- do NOT take it without doing this because it could kill you or turn a sane person crazy if you do not need it. If a doctor says no to your request_ go to a different doctor.,F,20,14  days 2X D,11/20/2010,Geodon

On top of that_ at night when I laid down my whole right side of my face twitched really badly. My pdoc told me to get off the drug immediately because she didn't want those things to become permanant and she also told me that 2 other of her patients were experiencing really bad side effects too. I have to say I feel a little like I was in a clinical trial because my pdoc always had plenty of samples (and now I have no clue how to dispose of 30 bottles of pills) for me to take which means the drug reps were really pushing this drug. At any rate I am down to 40 mgs and headed off of it as fast as I can tolerate it. As a side note_ it totally killed my appetite and I lost 10lbs so in that way I am sad to see Geodon exit my life.,I am generous enough to say if it works for you then I am happy for you but it sure didn't work for me.

If I am not having manic symtoms and I take it then I fall into a deep sleep for an hour or two and I have a 3 yr old so that is bad.  Some days I take all of it at bedtime.  Some days I have to take a 20 in the am_ a 20 in the pm and 40 at bedtime.  This drug makes me extremely drowsy and that is why I can't take 40 in the day. I have developed hypoglycemia recently and I believe this drug can cause that.  If I miss a dose I become borderline psychotic.  When I got pregnant I went off over 3 days taper and went psychotic even while taking risperdal.  Ran out of geodon and lost health insurance to pay for it and I went psychotic even though I took risperdal.  Gradually tapered off (over weeks) while taking full dose of risperdal and had no problems this time.  Never go off this drug too quickly.  I can't usually go more than 12 hours between doses before I become hypo,I've tried almost every other drug and was unable to tolerate them so this is the only option for me right now.  I worry about developing tardive dyskinesia and I worry that my fertility will be affected but I really do well as long as I take them.  Without them I become a complete freak.

I took this medicine for the first night_ and when I woke up in the morning_ I started having problems with my neck muscles moving involuntarily to the point where my head would get stuck in a position for a long period of time.  Everytime I would move my head into the correct position_ it would snap back like a rubberband_ and it was very painful and scary!  The resident monitors called my doctor and I went to see her that very morning.

I would get so tired about 30 minutes after dosing that it was almost impossible to stay awake.  I think it's a good drug and works great at controlling mania.  I think a lot of people of experience a rough period during the initial loading period but if you can get through that then you should see the benefits from the drug.

179, 4, Mild Bipolar Disorder,I take them in 40 mg pills. On 3 pills a day (morning_ evening_ and night) I felt tired and sleepy_ especially in the morning and in the evening. I was mostly unproductive because I couldn't focus / stay awake. On 2 pills a day (1 at night_ 1 in the afternoon) I feel great in the morning and sleepy in the evening. But the sleepiness is not so bad. Besides drowsiness_ I get random thoughts. I mean really socially unacceptable stuff. This is by far the worst side effect. It is intermittent. Much lower libido_ which I consider a good thing. Very very mild akathisia from time to time. The benefit of this drug is that_ in general_ it makes it harder for me to get angry. It mellows you out. You don't feel as depressed. I used to be a nostalgic_ emotional person. Now I find it hard to remember my late father. I still miss my ex-girlfriend_ but not as much as before (which is a good thing). In general_ I tolerate this medication pretty well. The sleepiness_ the random thoughts_ and the slight,I don't know much about the long term side effects of taking antipsychotics. Will I develop parkinson's when I age? Having to rely on medication for the rest of my life sort of sucks. On the positive side_ I get free disability money from the government.  :),M,27,6  weeks40 MG 2X D,7/11/2010,Geodon

I've taken many medicines (for depression_ anxiety and bi-polar) and this was the WORST!  I normally don't make comments on these types of messsage boards but this medicine was SO bad I have to let others know how bad it is.,AVOID at all costs....

182, 4, bipolar_ sever anxiety & panic_ dep,I have had a loss in appetite (yay!). Does not make me drowsy. Has leveled off my anxiety. Muscle tension. Licking back of teeth.,This drug_ the first time I used it_ had awful side effects (and I was on a lower dose than I am on now). I was a walking zombie. Very bad spasms_ which I took Cogentin_ but that made me practically blind. I have been on it again for 4 months now. And a higher dose. I feel the complete opposite from last time. I have a new psch doc and I trust her immensely. She has taken me off all the controlled meds (ie - xanex_ klonopin_ ativan_ ambien) and this has made a world of difference. Geodon is too powerful to mix with these mentioned pills. I know it seems impossible to suffer from anxiety and not take these meds and from sleeplesness and not take Ambien but this has rocked my life. Now I take Buspar instead of benzos and use Traz to sleep at night. My life hasn't been this great in a long time,F,31,4  months160 1X D,6/24/2010Email,Geodon

I thought the side effect would get better but it just got worse. I couldnt function on this medicine.

185, 2, Anxiety/Panic & Mood Stabilizer,Side effects were exactly what this med was supposed to help. Horrible panic attacks and constant anxiety. Overall sense of doom. Have developed social phobia. Afraid to leave my home. Fear of any time I have to be in a social situation. Even with close family and friends. Also_ vision problems_ headaches_ nausea and trouble getting thoughts from my brain out my mouth. Have no urge to eat. Must force myself to get something in my stomach and it's a chore to do that.,Have Trigeminal neuralgia (dentist drilled into my trigeminal nerve) Was on all types of narcotics for pain to no avail. Went to Dr. to get off all these meds and am now on Tegratol_ Suboxone_ Xanex ER_ Xanex_ Vyvanse and Adderal. Was on Prozac but very depressed so he switched me to Geodon. I have been complaining mostly of the panic attacks and constant anxiety to no avail. Was waking with instant sense of anxiety washing over me. Just recently things have calmed down a bit. Especially when I take an extra Xanex at night. Everyone is different but I have to admit that this medicine seems to cause everything it's supposed to help. I am very concerned how many have mentioned that side effects stick around long after you are off this med. I am going to seriously consider going off before things fire up again.,F,36,6  months40mg 2X D,5/28/2010Email,Geodon

189, 3, BiPolar 1_,Loss of appetite & weight loss. clenched jaw_ tongue rubbing the back of my teeth_ horseness in voice.,I was on Geodon for two years in 07 & 08. Lost 90 lbs going from 305 down to 215. Starting having tremors in my face got off the medication. Started taking Abilify gained all 85 lbs back. I didn't care about the adverse side effects I wanted to loose weight again. Have lost 15 lbs since February but I'm starting to have adverse side effects again. I'm currently taking 120 mg of Geodon at bedtime and need 10 hours of sleep to feel rested. I'm also on Lamictal_ Xanax_ Remoran & Effexor XR. My ear_ nose and throat doctor just diagnoced me with Dysphonia (horesness and loss of voice). On some web sites this is a major side effect of Geodon.

I couldnt wake up when I had to_ was falling asleep at work even after two cups of coffee_ had shortness of breath walking up the stairs (Im younger and in good shape/health). The side effects were so horrible_ I would rather just be depressed_ at least I could be able to work. I found it hard to drive_ which was a little scary_ and couldnt stand for longer than a few minutes before I would be feeling sick. And I was completely useless_ couldnt hold a conversation_ I might as well just slept all day. Havent felt this bad since the week I had to take Depakote. And of course_ there was the bed wetting..I havent had that problem since I was like 6. I dont think its a coincidence_ I stopped taking it and today I felt MUCH better.

I have had them so bad that I am unable to move or walk.  The most recent one happened a couple of nights ago when I was playing pool at a bar (not drinking alcohol).  It started in my legs making it hard to walk and then it got to the point where my friend had to literally carry me out and put me in the car because I was unable to walk.  I laid on his bed for an hour with painful spasms in my legs and lower back.  It was terrifying.  What if something like this happens when I am alone or am driving?

Edema of face and body_inability to sit still_ Breast enlargement_ Breast pain,The first few days on 20 mg at bedtime were a very nice relief from the paranoid thinking and psychotic anxiety. My hopelessness_ crying_ irrational thinking stopped! This was fantastic. Slowly I felt and saw my eyebrows raising on their own_ Eye pain developed after Dr. upped me to 40mg_ 20mg AM+ 20mg PM. Stiff neck started right away_ I thought this was from sleeping and lying around too much from the drowsiness_ but_ it was the drug itself. My breasts were already a 36 D and by day 5_ my bra did not fit and I had breast soreness. Had funny twitches in thigh muscles that felt like fluttering butterflies under my skin. If the Geodon did not cause the Funny face making and the binge eating_ I would have continued. My fear and Dr's fear is that it might get even worse and then not go away. Cogentin did nothing to stop the eyes from rolling/mouth from puckering or jaw clenching_ however_ 50 mg Benedryl every 6 hours helped.I am sad I can't continue because Mood was improved so greatly. :(,F,40,8  days20 mg 2X D,4/21/2010Email,Geodon

Thus far the Geodon is working_ I can get out of bed and get to work in the mornings_ which is helpful.  God knows with bipolar it can destroy much of your life.  Personal relationships_ career_ finances all gets destroyed with this disease.  I am hoping Geodon will help me rebuild my life (with the help of other drugs as well).

201, 3, Bipolar II,INCREASE IN APPETITE_ weight gain_ tiredness_ licking teeth_ extremely vivid dreams.,I was put on Geodon as an addition to Lamictal (400mg/day).  It undoubtedly helped me_ although I became hypomanic when I first started_ seemed to be TRIGGERED by the med.  Has helped calm my mind immensely.  It definitely made the difference between just Lamictal and adding the second med.  Also kept me stable when I added Lexapro.  I found that it knocked me out VERY suddenly and drastically_ like falling down on the way to bed.  This effect has lessened_ but I still have to sleep an average of 11 hours a night to feel rested.  (Only take dose in the pm.)  I started licking my teeth_ but the doctor suggested that I try taking Vitamin E (which I was sure wouldn't work)_ but I'll be damned it did!  I am still eating tons_ gained 70 pounds in a year and a half.  The dreams are crazy on Geodon_ I sometimes can't tell if I'm awake or asleep if it's early in the morning or I'm tired_ have almost peed the bed on many occassions.  However_ compared to the side-effects of Depakote (my second option)_ or Lithium_ it is very tolerable.,F,32,2  years160 1X D,4/9/2010,Geodon

SEVERE panic/rage attack..I felt like my body was going to explode limb from limb_ nausea_ I only took it 4 days and my vision is blurry for things up close.  I twitched so hard I actually thought someone tapped twice on my shoulder. I turned around and nobody was there. very weird.,I took it with 50mg Pristiq and I take 1 or 2 klonopin per day also_ and ambien for sleep. I started with 40mg Geodon_ and it didn't bother me_ and I slept well_ so I followed doctor's orders and increased to 80_ which made me pretty miserable.. all of the above symptoms...I tried 80 in the morning too_ and that was one of the worst mistakes of my life. I couldn't sleep_ but couldn't move either. I was being tortured inside my own body. I wanted that pill out of me. I would have made myself puked but it was already digested. I suffered that whole day_ and then decided I can't take it anymore.... and that night_ I didn't sleep at all... it threw me into a mania I've never felt. I feel like I got in a car wreck.  Be careful with this drug. I've tried 6-7 different depression meds_ a few benzodiazipines_ a few mood stabilizers_ and a few sleep meds_ and this has to be in the top five most powerful drugs.

203, 1, anti social and severe depression.,I don't know where to start.  The weird thing is that the first 2 weeks that I took it I was completely fine just a little drowsy. In just 2 weeks my doctor put me from 40 mg to 80 mg.  I can honestly say that Geodon is the worst med that I've ever takin next to halodol and risperdal.  I am usually anxious but this took it onto a whole other level.  I was pacing back and forth with anxiety like I've never seen or heard of.  I can honestly say that I wanted to go and jump off a freakin cliff on this med. I personally wouldn't recomend it to anyone.   Also around the second time that I take it at 5:00 and after I take it is when the anxiety hits the hardest. Anxiety and feeling like everything is going wrong is the most common feeling I can think of.  Like others have said be carefull on this drug its very very powerfull.,I am currently on my first day off the midication.  I quit completely I can't go through another day of that hell.  I have noticed feeling very tense and sort of anxious but nothing like what I was feeling while I was on it. I can tell you that this drug is definitely not for everyone.,M,24,  1X D,4/3/2010,Geodon

Water can't seem to satisfy my thirst.If I take 1st dose in morning_ then I get zoned out and too foggy to do anything_ not even able to drive when I take it in am_ as the drug seems to take affect in 2 hours. Only lost a little weight so far_ but I am willing to put up with the side effects if it will help lose the weight that Lithium caused.

210, 2, Severe Depression/Anger,I also took Geodon with Wellbutrin_ and for the first few weeks Geodon seemed to make me feel better. I took it in the morning and generally felt sort of sedated but it was tolerable. Then_ I started having severe panic attacks out of the blue: my heart would speed up to 170+ bpm_ I'd pour sweat_ and I'd feel extreme fear and anxiety - the worst I've ever felt in my life. It would happen the same time every day_ which was a result of the medicine being metabolized. I also developed a heart-rhythm abnormality that had to be monitored closely by the MD.,"I kept taking Geodon_ as I wanted to get better and I trusted my MD...but the panic episodes increased in duration_ then my skin became coarse/bumpy and rough_ I gained 25 pounds_ and I broke out in horrible cysts/pimples as my skin became severely oily (was very odd!)_ my hair also became coarse_ dry_ and started to thin in the front (and I had beautiful hair/skin.) All these side-effects_ the heart-issues_ along with the panic attacks caused me to stop taking Geodon. I also dumped that MD as I felt like she was more interested in ""experimenting"" on me rather than helping my depression! After 2 months off_ my skin/hair were back to normal and the horrible_ crippling attacks were a distant memory...I'd stay far away from the drug if you have other options you've not tried.",F,33,4  months40 mg 1X D,3/11/2010,Geodon
211, 4, Bipolar II,The first six months were hell_ I've never felt crazier - high anxiety_ constant nightmares of falling over the edge of cliffs_ buildings. Weird. Too much med at the wrong time of day makes you feel oddly tense and tired at the same time.,After six months I felt much better_ when I combined it with Lamictal to lower the dosage from 160mg to 60-80mg_ via 20mg in the morning with lamictal and 40-60 at night. Still feel a little anxiety when my life is quiet_ but when occupied with something i don't notice it. Causes me to sleep 9 hours a night. If I take it from 6:30-7:30pm I fall sleep around 9:15pm_ but take it later and I don't get sleepy until 11:30 or later (but still sleep 9 hours.) Dropping to 40 at night on Friday night reduces the anxiety for the next few days_ but must return to 60 at night most of the time_ or become manic/depressed.,M,39,3  years60-80 1X D,2/28/2010,Geodon
212, 4, Bipolar I Disorder,Extreme somnolence_ blurry vision_ loss of appetite_ increased thirst_ jaw clenching,Geodon is an add-on medication for me.  My base mood stabilizer is Lithium_ but it isn't enough on its own to control my moods.  I began taking Geodon as 40MG in the morning and 40 at night.  The somnolence and blurred vision were so bad that I couldn't function.  So_ my psychiatrist instructed me to take all 80MG at night.  This helped tremendously.  No more somnolence.  I still have some blurry vision_ but it's not nearly as bad as it was.  I have gained a lot of weight due to other medications_ so I have no complaints about the loss of appetite.  I am still eating well on Geodon.  The increased thirst is annoying_ but I do not feel forced to drink water excessively to compensate.  I'm drinking about 80oz per day and sweating much of that out when I go to the gym.  The jaw clenching just started about a week ago and it is also annoying_ but so far not anything I can't handle.  I am feeling great overall and think I have finally found the right combination of medications to treat my illness.,F,31, 80MG 1X D,2/23/2010EmailHistory,Geodon

Like many others I lost my appetite_ but I make sure I eat 3 meals a day and very healthy.  No sugar_ no flour.  It keeps the nausea away.  The only down side is I have a little anxiety at night.  I feel human again and I don't feel like playing around with new meds.  I think the anxiety will go away once I adjust.,,F,34,7  days20 2X D,2/22/2010Email,Geodon
214, 5, bipolar 1_ sleep,weight loss_ no appetite_ general agitation_ twitching,I have been on Geodon for about three weks now and I have been manic bipolar for as long as I can remember. I started taking 60 mg of geodon at 6:30pm and 60 mg at 9pm for calming my manic moods and letting me sleep better. I am mostly manic and combined with 3 mg of Lunesta I can sleep a good 5 hours without waking up at all. That's the best sleep that I've gotten in years. I am a chronic insomniac and I find that this combo works best instead of having to take 400 mg's of Benadryl or 6 or 9 mg of Lunesta. I find that it has mild sedative effects that I really find to be the most help to my mania but agitation was increased by a minorly noticeable amount when taken during the day.,M,23,21  days60 2X D,2/18/2010Email,Geodon
215, 4, Depression_ OCD_ Panic Disorder,Runny nose_ difficulty speaking_ quivering in the muscles of my jaw and legs.,I wanted to update my submission from 1/27/10.  I have now been taking Geodon for one month and have noticed a few side effects.  The doctor raised the dosage to 60mg. total daily but suggested I take it 20mg. at breakfast_ lunch and dinner.  The drug makes me really drowsy during the day and I feel like everything is in slow motion.  I have trouble driving a car.  My vision is off.  I am having some difficulty speaking and my jaw feels stiff.  I also noticed some initial quivering in the muscles of my legs when climbing stairs_ and also the muscles in my jaw.  The doctor said by dividing up the doses_ the side effects will be fewer. He also gave me a prescription for Cogentin to counteract the side effects_ but that made me VERY drowsy.  Also there were some serious risks with taking Cogentin and a Tricyclic antidepressant at the same time_ and I do take Anafranil.  I cant function during the day if i take the medicine during the day.  So I am back to taking it at night and it really knocks me out.  I feel OK_ but not wonderful like I did when I first started taking it.  I have not gained any weight_ which is a good thing.  My appetite is weak.  I think that I feel better on this drug than I did on Abilify or Risperdol.  I really wish I didnt have to be on an antipsychotic drug in the first place but i had been having some paranoia and the doctor suggested this type of medication. ,F,50,1  months20mg. 3X D,2/18/2010EmailHistory,Geodon
216, 1, mood stabilizer,I took it at night and couldn't get up in the morning.  After several hours the next morning it had worn off and I decided to take it again.  I felt like jelly.

We've only been married 8 mnths and now my husband's dealing with crap he hadn't dealt with since the 1st time we dated 6 years ago when I wasn't medicated correctly.I'm convinced that due to this whole episode_he's doubting his love for me.I hope I can get myself back in order before I scare him off.He's helped me emotionally so much but he shouldn't have to deal with this.",F,26,1  weeks40 Mg 1X D,2/10/2010Email,Geodon

I take 150mg Zonegran & 15mg Adderall in the am and 40mg Geodon at 5:30pm. After reading reviews I was afraid of Geodon_ I sent my kids off and made my mom come stay the night I took the first pill. I woke feeling groggy and like I had Novacaine injections but I felt ALIVE for the first time in months.,"I had been off Abilify for a month after taking it for a year. Needless to say I was a suicidal homicidal wreck. I was having constant anxiety w/ panic attacks on top of it & I was depressed over my 30 lb Abilify weight gain. I had not left my house in a month unless forced & when I was forced to mingle w/ society I turned vicious. All of these things subsided after 1 dose 40mg of Geodon!? The next day was even better I was doing things I had put off for 6 months. The only side effect I have I call it ""the witching hour"" I get nauseous about an hour before time to take it.  I have tried Abilify=fatty_ Wellbutrin=ugh sick_ Xanax=stoned_ Effexor=forgot my name_ Paxil=suicide_ Lexapro=insane_ Cymbalta= SATAN OMG quit my job_ lost it on everyone_ almost lost my house! The list goes on but the bottom line is EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT CHEMICAL BALANCE JUST BECAUSE IT DID OR DIDN'T WORK FOR ONE PERSON DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME RESULTS. My sister whom is nearly identical in disorders couldn't take Abilify due to violent tics yet I was able to take it until my weight was out of control. She can take antidepressants where I only have positive results with antipsychotics and we're exactly alike in personality/behavior.

I'm also on Prozac_ Wellbutrin and Klonapin.Before getting on Geodon I was taking Abilify and now I'm wondering if I should go back to Abilify_lower my Wellbutrin or take another medication for the side effects. But where do you draw the line. I don't want to be on a lot of meds. These side effects are almost worse than hearing the voices.I feel I'm damned if I do take it and Damned if I don't.Always having to deal with something.I'm worried I'm going to get too thin because I have no cravings for anything anymore.I hope it works for you but as for me...I am not happy especially if the side effects are long term.If they were only for a little while maybe I could deal with it knowing things would change_but I've heard its always like this with some people.Another thing is my libido is totally shot.It not only effects me but my boyfriend too.Then My mom is worried when she sees how bad I have the shakes and tremors and I'm worried I could have a seizure at any time.I wish I new more about this drug befor I started taking it.I feel like a lab rat.Its effects everything I do and find it hard to work.Plus I feel dizzy (due to low blood sugar probably) but still I feel sick everytime I want to eat something.There has to be a better drug or combonation for me.I'm able to think a little better because the voices are not as noticable_But not gone.PLEAS,F,34,4  months,2/2/2010Email,Geodon

I could not feel happy_ only through marijuana use. All around i felt unbarably horrible for about 2 months strait_ i was even hospitalized for a while.,This drug is the most horrible thing they've ever had on the market_ and they said there were no side affects_ that they didnt know what was wrong with me_ i wouldnt recomend geodon for anybody and for all those who suffered this reaction i feel ur pain becuz only those who have had that experience truely know what hell is like_ no lie or exageration please listen_ lithium and xanax worked for me people_ along with various herbs and dietary choices_ do the right thing and dont be an experiment anymore_ F the f.d.a and the government its all about profit.,M,20,2  weeks,1/18/2010Email,Geodon

Within a very short period of time I found myself easily angered and tense. That went on to become complete mania. Also_ with the tension I was already experiencing_ things got thrown_ people got hit_ uncontrollable shaking_ not remembering certain things such as why theres now a hole in my wall.....this in my opinion is the devil's drug.,,F,18, ,1/11/2010,Geodon

I would try to eat foods I really liked and I couldn't do it_ I'd just want to vomit.  It got to the point that even looking at food would make me want to hurl.

This brought my sugar up to normal.  It was a godsend.  I would caution others about it though because it obviously raised my sugar quite a bit.

These side effects were so severe I would describe them as my idea of what going to hell would be.  I couldn't do anything except sleep and ended up in the ER the day I returned to work because heart rate was racing and felt like I was suffocating ready to pass out.,Thankfully I stopped this immediately and my psychotic symptoms have not returned.

246, 4, mood disorder NOS,for the first few weeks I was very tired on geodon. I learned that if I take it every 8 hours I can avoid any withdrawal and remain stable. If I don't take it every 8 hours I get irritated_ sad_ a little angry and nervous too.,Getting used to this drug was tricky but so far has been worth it. After a few dosing increases and finding the right times of the day to take it_ I am feeling much more stable_ even good. The sleepiness has pretty much gone away and I've had 2 good stable weeks for the first time in a long time. I have paranoid thoughts that can be very scary and geodon has helped curb this. I am functioning well in school and at work. I take 80 mg at 6:30am and 80 mg at 3:00pm and then 160 mg at 10:00pm. It has taken some time to figure out how much to take and when to take it but I am finally satisfied. I think a lot of the symptoms people have are of the drug wearing off between the 8-12 hour mark... this is just my guess but I think keeping geodon in your system at a steady rate will significantly decrease the bad side effects (which might just be the beginning of withdrawal from the drug). This has been the case for me anyway. I'm glad I stuck it out with geodon... sometimes I wanted to give up on it but I know that I'm improving with it. It feels really good to be stable.,F,27,3  months,10/24/2009Email,Geodon

248, 4, Social Anxiety,Blurred Vision_ exhaustion_ feeling hungover,The first couple days I started taking Geodon I felt really hungover_ like I have never ever been before.  It only lasted 2 days and then I felt great.  I would just lay around before taking it and now I get up and feel like I have a purpose and get things done.  You really just need to give this drug some time to work.  I feel stable now.  My appetite has been curbed which was an unexpected gain.  I have been on xxanx and lexapro for years and finally I feel like Geodon is a breath of fresh air. Give you body time to get through the side effects and it will adjust.  My one warning is not to take this during or before you have things to do.  I wait until I get home from work_ even if it is late to take my Geodon.  I took it a few times at dinner time as prescribed but felt like I was going to pass out at work and the whole ride home I thought I was going to fall asleep at the wheel even after several cups of coffee. This will work for you if you give it time_ the side effects at first may be awful enough to make you want to stop_ but let it work for a month and you will see a differece.,F,24,3  months,10/14/2009Email,Geodon

After doing research_ I'm not really sure why he was prescribed this drug other than he's allergic to Morphine (for pain) and morphine derivatives and Ativan (anti-anxiety).  In any case_ his was a horrible experience and I would recommend staying away from this drug at all costs.

I was only taking 20mg once a day_ at night. Not long after my raving review_ I descended into a hellish depression of the magnitude I used to suffer before I was ever even on antidepressants at all. I can't describe the hell this drug has been for me.Now it has been over a week since I stopped taking it_ and I am STILL suffering. This is truly scary for me. How can taking the minimum tiny dose of a med for 2 and 1/2 weeks mess someone up this bad? I have no idea when I'm ever going to be better. I had a bad experience with Lamictal 2 years ago where I experienced suicidal depression_ but it didn't take this long to go away after I stopped taking it.So here I am_ over a week off the drug_ and I am still struggling with depression_ despite still being on Lexapro. I don't know what this med did to my brain_ and that scares me. At least the shaking/trembly feeling seems to have gone. But the sleepiness of having to take a nap every day_ the anxiety/morbid thoughts_ and depression are still with me. This is HELL. This is worse than whatever bipolar symptoms I was going thru.

The doctor tried to increase me to 100mg and I felt like I was having a continuos anxiety attack.  I have to take 40mg in the morning and 40mg at night if I don't I go through withdrawal.

Things I couldn't do because I was always sleeping or depressed from bipolar depressions. My appetite changed_ which is great because I'm very overweight. It didn't go away; eating just doesn't feel as necessary to me. I don't taste things as vividly as before. It's very hard to eat a lot of food. I'm very outgoing_ more than before.

Finding it hard to focus intensely on small visible details for very long as I was able to before. Hands are a little sweaty. Don't need as much sleep. I began feeling better practically the 2nd day on Geodon. And I'm only on 20mg. It's like_ can I finally have the basic_ decent life and functioning I've wanted all my life_ but that eluded me?

255, 5, Paranoid Schizophrenia,,"Please see my 1/20/08 posting. I'm writing to give update. I no longer hear voices at all and have been able to reduce my dose. Taking A.M. dose at 1:00 P.M. helps give me the morning hours to run errands and do things with a clear mind. Must leave 8-8 1/2 hours between doses though or else muscle cramps in shoulders. This might be due to fibromyalgia though. A note to schizophrenics_ age usually ameliorates symptoms so hang in there. This is discussed in book ""Surviving Schizophrenia. P.S. I am no longer a Paranoid Schizophrenic_ I only have Residual Schizophrenia. I hope this helps to give others hope.",F,38,5  years,9/8/2009,Geodon

I was on geodon for three days and had terrible side effects. I took the medication to help me sleep before bed and I woke up incredibly drowsy. I had a difficult time driving to work in the morning and staying awake during work meetings. On the third day_ all hell broke loose.  I experienced extreme highs and towards the evening anxiety_ high blood pressure_ panic and hallucinations. I stopped taking it that night. On the fourth day_ I felt very foggy_ irritable and slow. I  have read that the medication is highly addictive and very difficult to wean off--I believe it. I know I was only on the medication for three days_ but I did not feel myself during that time. I have read from those with BP2 that geodon was not very effective.,F,30,3  days,8/29/2009,Geodon
258, 5, Depression/Anxiety/Bipolar2/ASD,Sleepy the first couple of days,This medicine saved my life_ and within an hour of taking it. I started last Friday -today is TUesday- with a 5 mg_ (yes_ 5 mg_ suspended in liquid) dose at 8:00 a.m. To put it in context I've always responded to the most minimal doses of meds. Within 15 minutes I felt pleasantly woozy_ relaxed_ sleepy_ and safe. I rested and watched TV. I actually felt GOOD!!!!!! I DK how many X in my life I can say I've felt good_ just been varying degrees of pain.I was pleasant_ sweet Mommy_ for the 1st X in a long X. I enjoyed my kids instead of being overwhelmed by the constant demands of my 2 teenagers on the autism spectrum and my 6th grader who's just trying to survive having non-neurotypical siblings.  ADD 90% better. Patience_ I have energy_ I have love for my family....MInd you_  friend said I sounded a little manic on the phone_ and I'm xperiencing a ++Sex drive. Almost none before: bad relationship_ depression_ age or ?_ it's nice to have my old friend back_ but it does feels a little high octane. If I were younger this would maybe lead to impulsive behaviors. But I don't feel impulsive. It's a new experience_ not to (re) act immediately on every whim. I feel grounded for the first time. I feel sunny_ friendly_ full of possibility. So today is day 5_ I'm @ 7.5 mg 2x a day. 1st 3 days I slept  after taking it_ but not today. Gd lck_  hope it works for U.  2 nights ago I got  a heat headache. Maybe bc I took singulair. no singulair = no heat headache.,F,50,5  days,8/26/2009Email,Geodon

Made me too tired. Now I am on 20 mg at night plus 10 mg of Lexapro at night plus 30 mg of Busipar for anxiety and 15 mg a day of Naltraxone. I don't know what it is but I don't feel like myself. I cannot have a conversation without getting tongue tied or nervous. My nerves are bad now. My  head is always tingling including my tongue and neck. It gets tight when I get upset and yes I am still having mood swings. When I lie down_ my body feels like its shaking inside. Maybe the medicine is counteracting with the Lexapro. I used to take 20mg of Lexapro and didn't have any side effects. Don't know what I should do...  :( Maybe I should stop taking it. Gonna call the DR. tomorrow.,F,30,10  days,8/25/2009,Geodon

I have been taking Geodon since I was 23 and I have been a fully functional_ very successful member of society since I have been on it. I tried to get off Geodon about 6 year ago abruptly and was suicidal and maniacal about 2 weeks later. Got back on the Geodon and I have been textbook healthy ever since. I don't miss pills anymore_ as I can't sleep without it. I have successfully decreased dosage from 80mg to 60mg per day_ but tried 40mg and couldn't sleep at night.,F,29,6  years,8/24/2009,Geodon

A few hours later I was so tired I wasn't even able to speak or form coherent thoughts.  I have never in my life been this tired_ not even in college pulling 3 all-nighters in a row.  Despite the gatigue_ my legs were restless and I felt like I NEEDED to move even thought I couldn't.  The anxiety was absolutely gone_ though_ since I was unable to think at all.  I don't think I'll be continuing with this drug.  I've not read anything encouraging to make me think these effects will lessen or go away. I know it was only one day_ but that is just how bad that one day was.,F,25,1  days,8/12/2009,Geodon

Dosage was upped to 60mg 1x daily but then same thing happened but worse.  Went to 120mg 2x daily and within a week_ same thing happened again but much worse.  I started self-mutilating_ having almost constant suicidal thoughts_ wanted to die from the storms in my mind.

266, 1, bipolar disorder,Drug-induced Psychosis_ extreme confusion_ suicidal delusions_ muscle rigidity_ jawlock_ uncontrollable rapid tongue spasms.,"I started taking geodon 2 years ago when I was diagnosed (inaccurately I believe) with bipolar type 1. I was 25 and psychotic (first and only time I've ever been ""psychotic"") and the geodon helped bring me down while I stayed at the hospital. I stayed on 60 mg for about half a year_ then went down to 40 mg's for half a year_ then 20 mg's for a month or two_ then I stopped completely in March 2009. I felt a lot better_ my acne cleared up_ and I had less anxiety. I was back to my old self again. At the start of June I was feeling some anxiety and a little panicky_ so I figured I needed my meds again_ so I started on 20 mg's geodon. My anxiety got worse_ so 2 weeks later I started on 40. At this point I was getting pretty tense and thought ""I guess I am bipolar_ I better take the dosage the doctor prescribed""_ and started taking 60. This is when extreme mania came over me and I was having a ton of paranoid delusions. My kids had to stay with family as I was out of control_ trying to run away with the kids in the middle of the night because ""somebody's coming to hurt us"". I finally got to see a psychiatrist for 5 minutes and he upped my dosage to 120 mg's a day. This is when I turned into a delusional_ confused zombie. My memory was shot and I couldn't think or talk about anything except what was happening in my delusional world. My back got curled forward_ my arms would bend in front of me like a zombie_ my jaw wouldn't open more than about 2 mm's_",F,27,2  years,7/12/2009,Geodon

The doc had me on 80 mg 2x per day_ and these withdrawals happened only after he switched me to 80 mg once per day.,"The solution to avoiding the withdrawals is to take 20mg at morning and at noon_ then 40 mg at bedtime. I am very happy with the way this med helps me to think so much more clearly.

At least a year later_ I noticed that I choked when drinking water_ bit my tongue a lot when eating and soon after that_ began slurring my words.  After ruling out a stroke_  my doctor suggested going off geodon gradually.  All symotoms disappeared.,At one time I thought it helped with my symptoms but have felt  no change in my symptoms after going off it and have not replaced it with anything else.  I was on it for 3 and a half years.,F,61, ,7/6/2009,Geodon
269, 1, tourette's syndrome,I don't think I can be brief with this. Tremors_ hand curling up_ 2 trips to the emergency room for my muscles locking up_ not able to sleep_ ED almost as soon as I started taking it_ and involuntary movement of my tongue.  It stopped my ticks but now I have (probably permanent) severe tightness of the muscles in my neck and throat_and the muscles around my eyes are so tight that I constantly squint.  The muscle tightness has also caused quite a bit of breathing difficulty.,This drug was apparently pushed to the market way to fast.  When I  finally told my doctor no more_ I contacted Phizer for help and to get answers.  They took all of my information then refused to talk to me any more.  They said they would contact my doctor.  Guess what--they never did!  And now because I took this drug_ I can't buy my own health insurance for 2 years after being off of the drug.,M,47,4  years,7/2/2009Email,Geodon

I can't sleep if I don't take it.  It has really messed up my sleep patterns.  When I went down to 80 mg I gained 20 lbs.  I hate having to eat something when I take it because I work swing shift and so I have to eat late at night.,I want to go off this medicine.  I don't think it has really helped me anyways.  I'm afraid to go off this medicine because I won't be able to sleep.  Has anyone had problems with going off this medicine after taking it for awhile?  I would really like some feedback about this.

Anyhow my doc started me on 20mg and I was ok but feeling anxiety 8 hours after taking it_ so he increased me to 40mg. The first night I woke up to use the restroom_ used it and came back to the room and fell smack dab into my son's dresser_ surprised I didn't knock any teeth out. Husband had to put me back to bed I was so weak. Called the nurse who agreed I should eat with the dosage the 2nd night. Did that and 2 hours later could hardly walk or talk. Started getting the shiver/shakes and getting weaker after hours so ended up in the ER. This was the worst 8 hours of my life. They did nothing for me but take tests at the hospital. I've done natural childbirth and that was 10x's easier than this. All my other docs and people around me agree I'm not bipolar_ this is crazy!

274, 1, schizophrenia,Body aches_ tremors_ eye twitch_ involuntary muscle movements when lying down.,I started taking Geodon about a year after it was on the market.  No real research to look up.  No chat rooms.  My Psych doctor said it was new and effective_ yes the Geodon was EFFECTIVE for controlling my symptoms.  However I can't recommend this drug except as a last resort.  I developed debilitating headaches into the sixth year I was taking the drug.  I had every test in the book and the doctors felt that the Geodon (which after six years NOW had a track record)was responsible. I weaned off the Geodon slowly and it was He[[ and it is STILL He[[.  It's been FIVE MONTHS and I still have the debilitating headaches as well as body aches and nausea and vomiting.  Weird vomiting too_ like one minute it's not there and bam....  This drug needs an updated warning on it's label warning patients that they might never get off this sh*t.  It needs the Psych doctors really understanding what the drug does to people and the consumer needs to understand that it is like heroin to get off... Seriously evil.  I've been suffering with severe headaches for a year and withdrawal AND headaches both for five months.  How much longer??  Is this permanent??  Even Pfitzer doesn't know.

I take 40mg twice daily (so 80mg all together).  It helps me tremendously but its hell to get off.  I tried tapering myself down a bit just to see if I'd lose some of the 10 lbs I gained after starting it and had horrible withdrawals.  Research Geodon withdrawals and decide if you want to take this drug.  Your body and brain form a major addiction to it.  With any drug_ don't take the pdoc's word_ research_ get second opinions_ don't just take the script_ fill it and then start taking it.  RESEARCH_ RESEARCH_ RESEARCH.  I learned the hard way.

292, 1, bi-polar,Horrible dystonia.i had been on geodon for a few months_ and it was working great_ then one day my jaw was clenching...  i thought thats weird...  well enventually changed into my jaw forcing itself open...  i was frantic. then my tongue was forcing itself outwards out of my mouth_ it was horrible to go through. then the next week i was at a friends house_ same thing happened_ only this time worse. i was walking through a neighborhood and my right pinky toe started curling up making me walk funny_ eventually my whole right leg curved as did my spine_ i couldnt walk at all_ and the mouth muscle contractions make it near impossible to communicate with someone that something is horrible wrong.needless to say after that shenanigans i have sworn off medication and am hoping to deal with any mania or depression best i can without the risk of giving myself an even worse permanent disability,THIS DRUG IS HORRIBLE! IT CAN EVEN CAUSE PERMANENT DYSTONIA AND DYSKINESIA! IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU CALL FOR AN AMBULANCE IMMEDIATELY AS THIS CAN CUT OFF YOUR BREATHING AND ASK FOR A SYRINGE OF BENADRYL ANY WAY YOU CAN ASAP!!!!!!,M,18, ,2/22/2009,Geodon
293, 3, Bipolar II - Mixed State,I've been on Geodon for a little over two weeks now.  My doctor started me on two 40mg pills a day_ one with breakfast_ the other with dinner.  After a week_ he upped my dosage to three pills and told me to take them all at night because they could make me drowsy.  I made an appointment with him after about two weeks total on the drug because despite the fact that my depression was better_ I was having trouble sleeping and could not shake a 'tired_ but wired' feeling.  He suggested I take the medicine all in the morning.  On the second day after this suggestion_ I had to leave work_ about an hour after my morning dose.  I felt disconnected_ dizzy and very_ very tired.  I had to pull over on the highway on my way home because I felt as if I were going to pass out and throw up.  I did finally make it home_ but the side effects persisted.  I can only describe the next few hours as excruciating.  It was as if I had restless leg syndrome throughout my whole body.  I just could not sit still,Ive gone back to only two pills a day and Im taking them at morning and at lunch.  Im still having some weird side effects.  Primarily_ the tired_ but wired feeling and sleep deprivation.  I also have periodic bouts of what can only be described as dread.  I feel like something very bad is going to happen.   I have not felt that feeling since I was a small child and its very bothersome.  Still_ my options in terms of medication are very limited so Im going to do my best work through the side effects in the hopes that the medication might actually work for me.  Meditation and breathing exercises help.  Im also blessed as I have a wonderfully supportive husband and a very understanding boss.,F,33,12  days,2/20/2009,Geodon

308, 1, serotonin syndrome,I took Geodon only 1 time and refused to take it again! I took it at bedtime as prescribed by my phychiatrist. I awoke about 1 hour later and needed to go pee really bad but could not get out of the water bed nor could I call out my housemate's name! After much struggling_ I ended up on the floor and tried to crawl to the bathroom but peed myself before making it to the toilet. I still could not call out my housemate's name to help me. I then somehow managed to turn on the shower and get in to wash the pee off me. However_ once in the shower_ I could not stand up or reach up to turn off the water which eventually turned to cold. I don't know how long I was bent over in a helpless_ crumbled mess until I was finally able to get out of the shower. I had a prescription to fill and refused to do so and threw away the remaining sample pills of Geodon.,GEODON is a VERY dangerous drug. Avoid taking it at all costs! It will render you helpless.

Also not as hungry on geodon.,switched from 4.5 mg. risperdal to 120 mg. geodon in two months. Never had a problem with risperdal but gained 50 lbs. while on it. Doctor prescribed geodon along with risperdal lowering my risperdal dose to 3mg-40mg_ 1.5mg-80mg and 0mg-120mg. I went from 174 lbs to 228 lbs while on risperdal so I started working out and managed to drop weight to 204 lbs and kept it there for years.

My new doctor who is actually a psychiatrist_ diagnosed me as being bipolar_ and having OCD. Originally I started with 60mg_ 2 capsules at bedtime. I was just increased to 80 mg_ 2 capsules at bedtime. I've tried Seroquel_ Zoloff_ Celexa_ and other SSRI's_ however none of them really worked for me_ and they all gave me so many side effects. The only side effect I have is feeling really tired_ however my doctor gives me Provigil_ and that evens me out. I also get Klonopin for my panic attacks_ which are less severe since starting the Geodon. Geodone is usually prescribed with an antidepressant_ but I am not on one. I refuse to take them anymore_ and my doctor says I don't need to with the Geodon. I have a chemical imbalance_ and that seems to be working for me- with way less side effects than any of SSRI's.

People ask what I am having anxiety over and I don't even know. I am nervous about EVERYTHING. The drug does help me sleep. I have gained over 20 pounds. My face breaks out with these huge cysts or boils_ whatever you want to call them. I don't even recognize who I am anymore inside or out. I have a constant attitude and am irritated with everything around me ALL the time. When I have my menses my insides smell like they are rotting. I am on 140 milligrams and am slowly taking my self off this awful medication regardless of what my doctor recommends. At least before I would have spells of happiness.,I would never recommend anyone start this horrific medicine. I feel as if I am being haunted and people are running around me. No joke. One of the main side effects of this drug is seizures. All the others I have had to deal with are unbearable to live with. I used to be a beautiful woman. I now look like a monster and cant fit into any of my clothes. I just want to know who I am again that is why I am stopping this medicine. I dont care what my doctor says.

320, 2, bipolar II/severe depression,I stayed a few days in the crisis rehab unit at the hospital_ where I started taking Geodon. I'm not sure of the doseage_ as I was too tired from insomnia to ask. I experienced nausea and drowsiness the first night. The second day_ my doseage was increased_ and during exercise time I could not maintain my balance. Later_ my neck cramped up horribly_ and my head was basically stuck on its side_ all while I was in gut-wrenching pain. I was given adrenaline and benadryl to calm the cramping_ but I blacked out before it could start working. When I awoke_ I promptly threw up everything in my stomach. In the midst of all of this_ the nurses were scared senseless that I was having a stroke_ but it turned out to be the Geodon. I experienced one of the worst possible reactions to the drug. Needless to say_ the medication was discontinued immediately.,I'm only writing this to make people aware of the kinds of side effects that they might experience. I have no opinion whatsoever as to whether the medication works or not -- I wasn't on it long enough to tell.

I kept taking this drug even after telling the doctor what I was experiencing due to the fact they told me the side effects would eventually go away. I am still telling my doctor I am taking this medication with my others even though I am not due to the fact of not wanting to have arguments about the side effect's this medication is VERY damaging to the nervous system I think. Due to the fact I can not never keep my hands from shaking and my eye from twitching. In the future I see a huge class action law suite.

I was very drowsy_ no doubt the lack of sleep. My husband suggested I try it at lunch_ and that made a world of difference!,After switching to taking this medicine at lunch I have experienced very little side effects. I now take the lowest dose possible. Higher doses made me feel lethargic. But I do encourage anyone having similar trouble with sleeping or feeling so tired to try taking it a lunch.

I told my psychiatrist about it and he just brushed it off.  I myself thought my condition was related to the Geodon_ so I stopped taking the med. against the advisement of my dr.  The symptoms slowly_ slowly_ slowly began to go away_ but i never lost the abnormal gate.  The Dr. said to take the med. it wasn't causing my problem.  As soon as I took it_ the symptoms became worse. I was 34 yrs. old_ and I was using a walker to get around.  It was so embarrasing to go anywhere in public.

This seemed to intensify if I didnt take my 80mg dose with food_ but soon this side-effect lessened. Also_ if you dont take it EVERY NIGHT at the SAME TIME you will suffer from insomnia until you take it again. Ive only gone 2 nights without taking it and pulled all-nighters back-to-back_ so if you start it keep taking it or the side-effects will come back. Furthermore_ dont do like I did and take too much before talking to your doctor first.

Overall it has helped me and found that when taken during or slightly before an anxiety or panic attack it helps stop it since it literally makes you incapable of most activities of which include a panic attacks. However_ the tiredness is debilitating and the weakness nearly crippling at times.

Depression and anxiety are less common side effects.,I found little joy in food/eating. One thinks that would be good but you don't realize how much pleasure/joy you get out of food_ thinking about food_ planning_ and eating. It took some of the joy out of life to lose that. Anyway_ I'm able to stick to a diet which I'm not complaining about.  And after 50 years I stopped biting my nails without even trying.,F,,7  months,2/8/2008Email,Geodon

Sleepiness after I eat_ but cant sleep at night_ mind is wide open_ ran my mouth constantly_ Lamictal was worse with the rashes and mouth sores to boot_ but now I still have itchy head and sores all over scalp.  Hair loss was extensive.  Forget about sex any kind_ because you will be asleep by 2pm no matter what you do_ then awaken after everyone goes to sleep_ and youll be up all night long.  Soon as you eat...thats it_ lights out.,I spent 4_000 that I did not have to spend in the two months I was on it_ buying stuff like crazy.  I have tried this medication along with many others_ by itself_ and in every dose they make of it_ makes no difference.  Be prepared for a long withdrawal_ do not stop it immediately or you will suffer worse.  I wish I could toy with the brains of the  people who make and sell this crap_ so then they will know true psychosis.

384, 5, Bipolar,For about 1 week_ sleepiness at 80 mg_ but since then_ none,I currently take 40 mg in the morning and 80 mg in the evening. I was misdiagnosed as depressed with ADD until I had a major manic episode and my new doctor caught it. Since putting me on Geodon_ I now have a regular sleep cycle (I used to need Ambien almost every night and now I rarely if ever take it) and my production at work has gotten amazing better. My moods are so much better and so much more controlled. I am currently not taking an antidepressant since Geodon seems to control mania as well as depression. I take Klonopin for anxiety/panic_ Topamax for migraine prevention (also a mood stabilizer) and Neurotin for fibromyalgia so those may be helping as well. I haven't had any major side effects besides being sleepy the first week. Geodon is really pricey_ but the cost has been well worth the benefits for me.,F,30,2  months,1/27/2008,Geodon

389, 1, treatment resistant depression,Of all psych meds I've taken_ this one was the absolute worst. I took it for five days.  40mg_ in the evening. Side effects while taking it: depersonalization and confusion_ jittery and twitchy about 5 hours before next dose; Side effects after NOT taking it: six days of awful involuntary muscle twitching (tongue_ face_ chin_ right arm)_ awful headache_ flu symptoms_ trouble talking_ shaking_ inability to drive or go to work or sit still_ trouble sleeping_ bloated stomach.  I was very_ very scared. Thankfully it has been 4 days since my last dose_ and most symptoms have gone away_ though I still have some facial twitching.,I know the comments here are skewed toward the negative_ because most people come here to report complaints about drugs.  That said_ I have to contribute that Geodon has_ of all the medications I've taken_ been the scariest.  I have taken other atypical antipsychotics with no problems_ and Geodon caused four days of involuntary twitching in my face and hand_ which resulted in my not being able to talk or think clearly.  It was very scary.  I was okay directly after taking it_ but since it has such a short half-life_ about six hours before my next dosage_ I started to have muscle spasms and feel really anxious. I decided to listen to my body and stop taking it (with doctor's approval). The withdrawal (even after 5 days) was awful. I have been off work_ feeling like I have the flu_ for four days.  Thankfully the spasms and headache are wearing off.,F,30,5  days,1/17/2008,Geodon

I also had weight loss with geodon_ however the anxiety can be so bad that I have no appetite. I take 1/2 mg of klonopin twice a day and that brings my appetite back.

I used to be very self conscious and thought people were judging me on how I spoke so I was scared to talk but now I just talk.  Which sometimes I never have anything to say because of geodon it slows down your brain.  My doctor prescribed me 240 mgs of it.  I know if I don't take it things will be worse but when I start thinking people can read my thoughts I think it can't get any worse than that feeling because I'm all scared and paranoid thinking people can read my thoughts.

I started on Weight Watchers to lose the weight I gained on Zyprexa and I've been able to lose 40 lbs of it since January.  Geodon has been a life saver for me.

This seems to have done the trick.  I have noticed that my attention span is short_ get bored easy_ still a little restless but can live with it.  It has helped my mania and OCD and racing thoughts. So I would have to say that so far so good. I was on seroquel first but not a good drug for me.,M,44,3  days,8/28/2007Email,Geodon
425, 3, schizoaffective disorder,extreme fatigue_ muscle weakness_ dizziness,I have been taking geodon for 2.5 years but have recently experienced severe side effects. The medicine has taken away my mania and anxiety but I think it works so well because you are too exhausted and weak to have manic energy. It also makes me dizzy upon standing to the point where I stumble sometimes. The plus side for this med is that it has enabled me to go back to school without suffering any cognitive side effects.,F,27,2.5  years,8/17/2007,Geodon

I have had to lower the dosage from 160_ to 80_ now to 40 mg_ because I can't tolerate the side-effects (but I also take another med to help the Geodon)_ and hopefully lowering the dosage doesn't affect it's ability to help me.

I have to be careful when I take it as I fall asleep in about 1 and half hours. So have to plan when I eat dinner and take it so I will stay awake if going out that night or if I have to do homework. this part is hard to figure out. It wears off about 3pm and I get angry_ uncooperative_ and irritable. Then I take ativan to calm me down until dinner or night when I take it again. I take 120mg of Geodon_ lamicatal 100mg_ and ativan 0.5 mg take 1 or 2 under my tonuge and also 1 or 2 at night with the Geodon and mirtazapine to stimulate my apetite because I was all of a sudden refusing to eat anything and was very angry and irritable. I have been on medical leave from high school as I was crying and just couldn't function since March and then started Geodon and the others listed in June and have felt better. Blut now I will start high school again and I am really nervous and scared,Since  January 2007 doctor has tried many other medications none helped until I got the mix that I stated earlier.,F,17,3  months,8/13/2007Email,Geodon

First pill not so bad_ just a little lethargic but those symptoms didn't go away_ they just kept getting worse. Three days into it she died. Her heart gave out. All her life she was off and on different medicines and a body can only take so much. If a medicine changes how you feel physically_ don't take it_ they are not supposed too. What they are meant for; is to change you mentally_ your train of thought. She could not speak and her heart rate was very high for her and she could not take in a breath of air for more than a second.  She told me that something was wrong but I thought I should listen to the DRs.  So now she isn't here anymore. And I was the one that gave her the medicine and now I have to live with that.

472, 2, Bipolar,EXTREME mania_ near psychosis_ wanting to come out of my skin_ insomnia.,I experienced VERY rare and extreme reactions to Geodon_ but just to let people know who might experience this_ too.  I had intense mania - more than ever before in my life_ which lead to a near psychosis.  Even the best days were full of overly chatty talk leading to no point_ and being manic.  The worst days I felt like crawling out of my skin and had to take high doses of valium and just sleep in order to not lose my mind entirely.  I was taken off it immediately.,M,48,12  days,2/23/2007,Geodon

478, 2, Bipolar_ ADHD_ OCD,My Daughter is 8 yrs is on Geodon. She complains she can't breath good after she takes her pill. She started at 20 mg tonight started 80 mg. She has been on it for about 5 wks. She also has had increased anxiety ad Panic attacks_ she moves her leg alot and she can't seem to stop moving her Jaw. I am getting concerned about these side effects.,I m wondering if she is on the right med. She has had very odd and not good side effects from other med's like Seriquel made her legs cramp very bad and prozac made her LIERALLY climb walls She was up RUNNING 100mph for 3 days before she crashed VERY BAD! Plus others. I am feeling at a loss and don't know what to do. I don't know how long do I allow these side effects to go on to see if they go away + the Doctor says sometimes it means that she needs to icrease the dosage and than how about If I want to take her off Geodon how do I wing her so she doesn't get sick because i am reading about lots of people who say they had bad withdrawls I have been very good about working with the doctors and being  PRO ACTIVE_ but this is hard on her and all of us.

479, 3, Bipolar II Mixed States,My nose gets so stuffy after I take it that I can't sleep even if I'm drowsy! So I've started taking a decongestant about an hour before I take it and that helps though I worry about mixing decongestants with Geodon. Also I am taking Depakote 250 BID. The Geodon was a starting dose of 60 MG/QD then BID_ but I don't know if I'm going to be able to tolerate it twice daily! Otherwise_ my nose is stuffy/runny/sneezy all day and I've developed a cough/tickly feelings in my lungs (Though maybe that's just a cold_ who knows?),Feeling maybe a bit better_ but experiencing apathy still and some not so cheery what-if type suicidal thoughts.

480, 5, Bipolar I w/ GAD,1st two days-Sleep_ sleep_ and more sleep. Then it was VERY hard to wake up & function.  Muscle spasms/stiffness.  Very bad anxiety attack at bedtime on 2nd night.,Overall I can't say Geodon is a bad drug.  The first night it knocked me out for 13 hours_ same on the second.  It was very hard to wake up_ but when I did I felt better.  I have sleeping problems anyway so it actually felt good to catch up on some winks.  My legs are stiff and the doc says that should pass soon.  Last night was the 3rd and I experienced NO anxiety and I woke up awake and refreshed-so apparently the hibernating does infact go away-THANK GOD!!! I am on 40mg and have had no rash or any of that_ I go up to 60mg in 4 days.  If you have gotten the rash perhaps doc started you too high on a dose.  Mine specifically told me that is why I am taking 40 for a week and then going to 60mg.  I am also on a combo of wellbutrin xl and lexapro to control how low this drug can take you.  PS.. Since taking geodon I actually have a sex drive again...it's amazing!,F,22,4  days,1/26/2007,Geodon
481, 4, Bipolar I,EXTREME FATIGUE and anxiety/ruminating thoughts @ bedtime,I think Geodon is going to work out for me as I used to be on Depakote and it did NOTHING for mania.  I have only been on Geodon for 3 days but I do feel a little better-moodwise anyway.  I have found that Geodon either makes me crash hard and pass out for 12 hours or I get a horrid anxiety attack and then crash hard for 12 hours.  The first night I took it I passed out at 9:30 on the couch_ went to the bed at 7:30 and woke up at 3:00pm!  Last night took it and had one of the worst anxiety attacks ever and then just crashed hard.  I woke up at noon took the dog our(barely with out passing out in the grass outside) and slept on the couch until 3:00pm again. It is hard to wake up too_ it takes about an hour to fully function.. I am only on 40mg no and in 3 days am supposed to up it to 60mg.  Other than the sleep nonsense I feel better.  My doc also added two new antideppresants to handle the downs.  I am on a combo of Lexapro_ Wellbutrin XL_ and Geodon.  I feel better and my hopes are hi,F,22,3  days,1/26/2007Email,Geodon

SO far I just feel crappy_ achy_ joint pain_ apathetic_ and extremely drowsy in the morning. I also have been unable to fall asleep for at least 3 hours after I go to bed. I was in the midst of a Mixed Episode (Extremely irritable_ dysphoric_ anxious_ and withdrawn) when I started this last week and I still feel about the same_ only with joint pain and apathy.

483, 4, bipolar/paranoia,It made my heart race as soon as I took it_ then like 5 hours later I would crash.  So I take it at bedtime.  One really bad side effect was the amount of alcohol I could drink on it.  I had blackouts after taking geodon the night before then the next night having just a few beers.,I don't know if I would recommend it to anyone because coming off of it would be really bad.

I woke up a couple of times during the afternoon_ tried to get up but my head was clouded horribly and I was dizzy and had to go back to sleep. Fell into a deep sleep around 5pm_ and experienced horrible nightmares and at the end of it_ an episode of sleep paralysis with hallucinations that I would call an out of body experience. I was completely awake and terrified_ and after I ""came back into my body"" or whatever that was_ tried to move but I couldn't. I could not move_ this thing had me trapped.

I felt and looked like I was 4 months pregant while on this drug.  The effect got worse over a 2 week period until I felt like I must be growing a huge tumor in my abdomen and I went to the ER.

525, 1, depression,terrible.  worked great for my impossible to treat sadness for about 2 years....where nothing else seemed to. then all hell broke out.  horrible w/d reactions_ first between doses_ then going off.  i was VERY ill for a long time!!  i have never been so scared.,doctor never should have given it to me_ or at least warned me my body could become so addicted_ in turn causing horrible withdrawl side effects.,F,36,2  years,12/2/2005,Geodon
526, 1, bipolar_ anxiety,uncontrollable painful muscle spasms; could not straighten legs; could barely walk; lethargic,I took the full dose recommended by my doctor on Day 1_ but didn't experience the spasms... I was just very lethargic.  So I cut the dose to half for the next several days. Today I decided to try a full dose again_ and I have never experienced anything so scary.  I completely lost control of my legs and feet. They were drawing up where I couldn't stand on them (seizures?).  This went on for hours. It was very painful.  I was driven to two hospitals_ but the wait was so long that I preferred to be at home_ and the effects finally seemed to be lessening.I will never take this drug again. Please consider older_ proven drugs for treatment before trying Geodon.,M,39,10  days,11/28/2005,Geodon
527, 1, schizophrenia,"I am normally a pretty easy-going person_ but Geodon caused a severe ""Jekyll-Hyde"" reaction in me with compulsive violent thoughts and verbal threats to anyone I came in contact with. It got me hospitalized. I have never reacted this way to a drug before.","Geodon needs to come with a WARNING beyond ""hostility"" as a side effect. It can be a very dangerous medication for some!",M,25,2  months,11/23/2005Email,Geodon

529, 4, Bi-Polar II_ mood swings/depression,First 3 weeks- after I took the medicine I became extremely sleepy_ but that went away gradually and is now not a problem.,Immediate help for my extreme mood swings and anger. It has helped tremendously with that. My doctor told me it can help with depression too_ but I am still depressed and will need to add an antidepressant to my medication.,F,30,4  months,11/2/2005,Geodon
530, 1, bipolar,extreme sleepiness and inability to function,Dr. had me starting on 20mg of this once in the morning_ made work impossible. After voicing concerns about it_ he suggested raising the dose to 40 mg at night_ slept great_ but couldn't get out of bed.  Stopped taking and called the Dr. who suggested trying 160mg of this at night claiming the some people have better reaction to strong doses.  Slept for 20hours_ extreme dry mouth_ felt like I was having major trouble breathing.  Strongly considering finding a new Dr. as this one seemed to be hell bent on forcing this drug in me.  Now for 12 hours afterward I can't stop shaking uncontrollably and can not sleep at all which is the reason for typing this at 2:30 am....... Don't take this med. without trying more proven and entry level drugs.,M,28,45  days,10/31/2005,Geodon
531, 4, BiPolar,Drowsiness taking it too late at night.,I started taking it (40 mg) around dinner time and wow what a difference. I fell asleep early_ slept for 7 hours_ and woke up with energy. I also take lamictal (75 mg) in the morning_ so I feel good all around. I was on Depakote before (750 mg),F,37,7  days,10/20/2005Email,Geodon
532, 4, Bipolar Disorder,Now that I've been on the drug for a couple of weeks now_ side effects are barely noticable.,Very useful in managing most effects of sleep deprivation;i.e._ I should be able to function every day no matter what.  Also useful for my specific type of anxiety attack.  I must mention that this drug is POWERFULLY antimanic.,M,43,2  weeks,9/29/2005Email,Geodon

534, 4, Bipolar Disorder,Primarily Drowsiness,"This is a follow-up from my last entry here.  Now that I've been on the Geodon for a couple of days_ I have a better idea on what to expect from this drug.  There is one particular effect that is quite useful:  It seems to help eliminate ""Sleep Deprivation Dysphoria.""  I have problems with insomnia quite frequently_ and the Geodon helps keep the next days' agitation under good control.  Anxiety is also significantly relieved_ and the drowsiness as a side effect is somewhat pleasant.  I'm supposed to take 80mg at night_ but I've been splitting the dose to 40mg at night and 40mg in the morning.  I will say_ however_ that I'm glad to be concurrently taking a stimulant (Provigil)_ otherwise I surely would end up wasting away the entire day.  To anyone reading this entry_ if you are taking or will be taking this drug_ be sure to ask your doctor if you can get a prescription for some kind of stimulant.",M,43,3  days,9/15/2005Email,Geodon
535, 3, Bipolar Disorder,I took my first 40mg dose today for the first time_ so I don't have a complete idea of the side effect profile_ but I have noticed a lack of appetite and a mild headache.,"My psychiatrist claims that Geodon should improve cognition_ plus stabilize my hypomanic tendancies (which personally I would like to preserve).  So far_ I can somewhat understand what he means_ that is_ it seems like I can focus better and be less ""scatter-brained.""  I have an anxiety disorder that I hope this medication can resolve.  I will update my remarks as I continue with my regimen.",M,,1  days,9/13/2005Email,Geodon
536, 1, bipolar rapid cycling,rapid hear beat_ constant shaking_ inablility to sleep_ panic attacks,This is the worst med that I have been on thus far.  I ended up in the hospital for what turned out to be a panic attack_ but I thought I was having a heart attack.  I litterly could not stop shaking and had to clinch my teeth to try to calm my teeth from chattering.  Trouble focusing as well.,F,26,1  months,8/30/2005Email,Geodon
