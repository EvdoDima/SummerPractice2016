0, 5, Pcos/infertility,Hot flashes_ irritability,Worked well! Healthy baby girl,F,24,8  days300-150,10/22/2015,Follistim
1, 3, increase more eggs,Severe mood swings - went from crying to wanting to punch someone in a matter of minutes.,The needle did not hurt one bit - I was shocked how painless it was_ considering I hate needles & get my blood drawn all the time which always hurts.  This was a breeze.  Mood swings were a killer though_ I've never experienced anything like that before.,F,37,7  days75 mg 1X D,3/7/2011,Follistim
2, 5, increase follicle #_ TTC,Bloating_ slight tenderness at injection sites,Worked better than Clomid (more follicles matured - 3_ and no thinning of the uterine lining).  Used prior to IUI.,F,39,5  days150 IU 1X D,7/5/2010,Follistim
3, 3, undefined infertility,Hot flashes and period like cramping...definitely no bloating and headaches with Clomid,Definitely recommend this medication.  Extremely easy to administer.,F,38,4  days75 units 1X D,5/1/2010,Follistim
4, 4, IVF stimulation,Bloating and soreness at injection site(lower abdomen),This drug was used in my ivf protocol in conjunction with low dose hcg.  Of all the IVF meds_ this is by far the easiest to use/inject.  The needles are so fine you barley feel them.  A real pleasure compared to any and all other ivf drugs I have used!  Sick and sad_ but true!  My ovaries did not respond well at first to this drug.  However I strongly feel this had more to do with the fact that I had been over suppressed with lupron.  My doc had to increase my dose from. 300 to 450 after a couple days of stimming.  I would reccommend this drug for it's ease of use and also for the fact that it is portable (does not have to be refrigerated once a vial is punctured).,F,30,2  weeks300-450 1X D,2/9/2010,Follistim

7, 5, Infertility/PCOS,I did have mild OHSS with this medication_ but I got pregnant in just one month of taking straight Follistim/IUI.  Not only that_ but I am pregnant with twins.  After 2 1/2 years of trying to conceive_ this medicine was finally what worked.,,F,29,1  months,5/28/2007,Follistim
