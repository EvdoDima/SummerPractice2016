0, 5, Post knee replacement surgery,Caused pretty significant constipation_ but stool softener helped a lot.,"After knee replacement surgery_ the hospital gave me Norco and it didn't touch the pain.  Dilaudid didn't touch the pain. So they moved on to a combo of Opana and Opana ER--This combo was excellent for pain relief and did not make me feel ""high"" or out of it. Was able to stay in the 3ish range of pain with the meds_ which is a huge win.",F,46,30  days 2X D,8/25/2015Email,Opana er

4, 3, Spinal stenosis_ DDD_ siatica,I was given this when other options ran out. NSAIDS gave me bleeding ulcers_ Percocet began to  give me migraines> I was on a higher dose when a doc messed up a procedure 20 mg 3 times per day. It takes some getting used to it can make you very speedy and tired when you get used to it eventually some of the speediness goes away. It helps with the pain BUT the,"new formula of the Generic 7.5 I have been on for 3 days and sick as a dog. I am buckeled over in stomach pain it feels like I am back on NSAIDS. There was another generic that wasn't so bad but the tiny little ones that are made my Actavis now has a new name should be pulled off the mkt they are awful!! I think my pharmacy got them in China_ I can't take them I feel like my stomach is on fire. Such a difference and they say generic is the same no way Jose"" I have cut down and they came out with the 7.5 but if I have to find another drug then so be it these are going to kill me. My doc will not put me back on 10 mg and 5 isn't enough. I am so sick of docs playing games with meds and now the pharmacy's are in on the action it's just awful.I tried going back on Prilosec and even that doesn't help. It s a good drug but why they had to mess with it is beyond me.",F,60,12  months7.5 3X D,2/4/2013,Opana er
5, 4, Lumbar Fusion,Occasional anxiety,I began Opana ER in September 2012_ after the Dilaudid just wouldn't relieve the pain anymore.  The begining dosage was 10 mg. and after one week_ jumped up to 20 mg.  Two weeks later needed to go to 30 mg. and that seem to do the trick_ using Dilaudid for break through pain.  The two of them together work well though Dilaudid is rarely needed.  Within the next year_ I will require and additional fusion on the next disc up - L2-3.  I'm also quite sure I will be going up to 40 mg by then as well.,M,54,4  months30 mg 2X D,12/15/2012,Opana er
6, 5, Chronic back/side pain/fusion,Constipation. Past that this has been the difference between me curled up on the floor screaming and being able to function. I had a spondylohesis that caused pain and constant muscle spasms that got bad enough that it had to be fused before paralysis occured. Still have back spams that I have muscle relaxers for_ but the Opana ER knocks my pain down enough to liveable levels.,,M,35,2  years20 MG,6/22/2012,Opana er

8, 1, ,Horrible acute anxiety_ yet_ very tired at the same time... not relief from severe chronic back pain whatsoever... only horrible side effects... do not like this drug at all and am talking to my doc about switching to something else.

9, 4, 7 Hern.discs_ 2 torn/leaking_Fibro,None_ really.,Talking about Opana ER here - NOT IR. Although_ I do take Opana IR also. Opana ER_ 20mg tablets taken twice a day (morning & night) helps to keep my pain at a more bearable level. If I miss a dose_ I feel it. In other words_ I can tell that it's working.,M,42,3  years20 2X D,1/23/2012,Opana er

11, 1, Lower back nerve pain,Jittery_ lightheaded_ headache_ INTENSE anxiety_ muscle twitching_ weakness_ faintness_ increased back nerve pain_ EXTREME agitation_ verged on having a full-fledged panic attack.,Keep in mind that I have an anxiety disorder.  Agitation_ restlessness_ and anxiety are some of Opana ER side effects.  I would NOT recommend the usage of this medication for anyone who has an anxiety/panic disorder.  I have used it only one time and will not take any more_ due to how it has effected me.,F,59,1  days20 2X D,11/11/2011,Opana er

13, 2, SEVERE CHRONIC PAIN & HERN DISKS ET,"DEAR ""ME""- you write me ""I don't know what I'm talking about"" and then you don't even list your REAL EMAIL ADDY?!  I have been having pain problems for YEARS AND HAVE BEEN TAKING NORCO FOR APPROX 4 YEARS (not 2 as listed after going through my records) AND IT HAS HELPED ME IMMENSELY. I have tried myriad of pain pills including non-narcotics AND OPANA WHICH SUCKS. Norco has been extremely effective for controlling my pain_ obv for short durations.I have little to no side effects and I understand very well that Tylenol can be toxic to your liver in LARGE DOSES (4 mg and higher) however 600 mg of Tylenol a day is not a lot at all. MANY THINGS CAN BE TOXIC to your liver and of course any opiate and/or narcotic is hard on your liver. There is a GREAT saying which I live by- ""everything in moderation"" and that's pretty much how I live my life. I take care of myself_ I take supplements daily (including milk thistle for liver) and I get my entire hepatic functio","DRUG ADDICTS ARE SWITCHING TO OPANA B/C THEY SWITCHED THE OLD OXY TO THE NEW ""OP"" VERSION WHICH IS HARDER TO ABUSE. I LOATHE ALL OF YOU DISGUSTING DEGENERATE ADDICTS WHO MAKE IT HARD FOR LEGIT PPL LIKE ME WHO HAVE REAL PAIN PROBLEMS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND GET THE RIGHT PAIN MEDS.",F,30,4  months20 MG 1X D,12/27/2010Email,Opana er
14, 3, BULGING DISKS CHRONIC PAIN FIBRO,"EXTREME CONSTIPATION_ NAUSEA AT TIMES_ DROWSINESS_ HEIGHTENED ANXIETY_ A ""DRUGGED UP"" FEELING",I STARTED OUT ON THIS MED (5 MG) DESPITE THE FACT THAT I WANTED TO GO BACK ON THE OXY. I ALSO HAVE BAD SCIATICA AND NERVE PROBLEMS AND TAKE 20 MG OF NORCO DAILY WHICH IS A GODSEND.DOCTORS LOVE TO INSIST THAT YOU TAKE THIS MED B/C THE DRUG REPS PUSH IT ON THEM- THIS IS A FAIRLY NEW MEDICATION AND IT'S ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE! EVEN WITH BCBS IT'S 40$ FOR MY COPAY I THINK MY OXY WAS 10 BUCKS OR LESS. THERE'S NO OPANA GENERIC.  IT'S GOOD FOR MOST OF MY PAIN BUT WHEN I GET IT SO SEVERE THAT I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GET OUT OF BED IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE AT LEAST AT THE DOSE I TAKE BUT I WILL NOT GO UP ANYMORE. I WAS TAKING 5-10 MG OF OXY FOR A PERIOD AND THATS ALL I EVER NEEDED TO TAKE BUT IT SEEMS WITH THIS DRUG I HAVE TO TAKE MORE. NORCO IS MY MAIN PAIN RELIEVER AND WHEN IT GETS WORSE I START WITH 10 MG OF OPANA. THIS IS STRONG STUFF SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PPL ARE TAKING 80 MG OR HIGHER AND NOT DEAD!!! IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A DRUGGED UP ZOMBIE I WOULD NEVER TAKE MORE THAN 10 OR 20 MG!!! IF YOU NEED TO_ SUPPLEMENT IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE GOOD LIKE NORCO.,F,30,4  months10 MG 2X D,9/19/2010Email,Opana er
15, 4, Artificial Disc_ Spinal Fusion,Chronic constipation_ vivid nightmares_ flushing.,"I have taken both Opana ER and IR...I currently take the Opana ER with 12 oxycodone throughout the day_ along with a barage of other medications_ ie: muscle relaxers_ (xanax_ tizanidine)nerve meds_ (lyrica)anti-depressant w/pain relief (cymbalta_ elavil).  I've had an artificial disc implant_ a spinal fusion_ another severely herniated disc (soon to be fused) along with 2 more discs that are torn/ripped. I've been prescribed virtually everything in the past 5 years...vicodin_ percoset_ methadone_ fentanyl_ opana_ the list goes on. I am gearing up for another surgery but I am scared.  I had my fusion in Oct 2009.  The nurses were ""horrified"" by the amount of narcotic pain medication I was being prescribed by my pain doctor (I've been with the same one for 5 years)I literally had to BEG for it!  My husband had to call my dr. at his HOME because they were refusing my meds.  All the while_ I felt like I would rather die than go through that pain again. Now_ again_ it's the same hospital_ the same nurses-I really am stressing out about this!  My neurosurgeon won't prescribe anything more than percocet-hence having my pain dr. I am on this site trying to get an idea what kind of meds I could use after this next surgery or if I am stuck with what I've got.  Thanks for reading.",F,39,3  years80mg 2X D,6/5/2010Email,Opana er
