0, 1, Crohn's Colitis,I began Cimzia in May 2010.  That summer I developed a cough and found myself coughing all the time_ except not much at my GI?s office.  July of 2012 I went in for colonoscopy.  I had so much mucus in my lungs_ the anesthesiologist wouldn?t put me under. After two nebulizer treatments and 4 hr wait_ I went home.   I promptly quit Cimzia and got treatment for the cough.  Colonoscopy in October was not good.  Dr. wanted to remove my colon.  She detected by odor_ that I had C. Difficile and put me on Vancomycin.which cleared up the loose stools I?d been having.  I?ve been on Prednisone since (now only 10mg). I don?t have any problems with it_ but Dr. doesn?t like Pred side effects and wants me to go on Imuran.  I have mixed feelings as it has many of the same side effects as Cimzia.  Also during the two years I had 5 bouts of either food poisoning or flu and was totally wiped out last summer_ so I don?t want anything to do with immune suppressants,Will also explore alternative approaches_ as drugs just seem to have too many side effects.,F,68,26  months400 mg 1X D,2/6/2013Email,Cimzia
1, 3, Joint Inflammation_ psoriasis,frequent sinus infections_ breathing difficulties_ concerns about short-term memory and periods of confusion.,Have previously been on Enbrel and Humira.  Enbrel helped psoriasis but wasn't too effective for the inflammation.  Humira made my psoriasis worse plus caused some other skin rashes and produced quite a bit of hair loss.  Cimzia has helped the back pain_ allowing  more mobility but I do have concerns about my short-term memory and periods of confusion.  Also wondering if it is affecting my vision as my last eye exam was surprisingly unsatisfactory (after just having cataract surgery and permanent lenses implanted just a year ago.  I'm experiencing my third sinus infection and am bothered with a constant cough.  If anyone has similar thoughts about these side effects_ please share them.,F,,1  years200 mg 2X M,8/11/2012Email,Cimzia
2, 3, Crohn's Disease (with Psoriasis),"1. Drop in immunity immediately after injection. Try to ""quarantine"" and stay out of public places for 2 days after shot_ very apt to getting severe bronchitis otherwise. 2. Fatigue after injection. 3. Recently began getting welts at injection site_ followed by bruising. Never happened before_ not sure what's up. Anyone else get this? 4. Recently started getting leg cramps (calves) that wake me up and sometimes last for days_ not sure if it has anything to do with Cimzia. 5. Glands in my eyes stopped working. My eyelids are swollen like someone punched me_ going on 11 months. Tried 4 treatments_ still swollen. Currently 1 month into an 18 month course of restasis. So far not helping. Eyelid problem will NOT go away_ eyes extremely sensitive in sunlight and at computer. Doc says its from immuno suppressive therapies. 6. Found out I have hpv after starting tnf alphas. Never had a bad pap before tnf drugs_ since starting never had a good one and constantly running for the most m",This drug (as part of a combination therapy w 6mp and sulfasalazine) seems to have helped control # of bowel movements. Going 4-8x per day instead of 20. Huge improvement. Sometimes I require an extra dose to keep running to bathroom in check. However_ I am in pain all over my body every morning and sometimes throughout the entire day_ especially in my hands. 3 doctors have said its not from the medications_ but I'm suspicious as to otherwise. (Note: Since starting TNF alphas_ my skin is 99.9% psoriasis-free--like a miracle. Yay_ something good!) Remicade and Humira had me completely incapacitated from medication side effects_ I would pick Cimzia any day. Gained weight on this drug_ bc now I can hold food and I'm too sore to get up and exercise. Meh. Before Crohns I was pretty active. Before Cimzia I was down 20lbs.,F,39,2  years400mg 1X M,6/6/2011Email,Cimzia
