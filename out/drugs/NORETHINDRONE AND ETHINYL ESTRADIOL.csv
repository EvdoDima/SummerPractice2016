3, 5, endometriosis,mild acne_ bloating_ spotting_ fatigue,I take this pill continuously_ skipping my period_ for control of endometriosis. I do still have a very light period and mild cramping during the week I should be on my period. I usually suffer from severe cystic acne and I now only have mild breakouts during the 3rd week of the cycle. The best thing about this pill is that I normally suffer from severe PMS 2 weeks before my period and mild depression. This pill has completely eleminated all PMS and depression. I am so happy and laid-back all the time- it's better than any antidepressant I have ever taken. The only real downfall of this pill is stomach bloating and fatigue_ but no more PMS makes it worth it! The first 3 months I took this pill_ my acne actually worsened_ I was severly fatigued_ and my stomach was hugely bloated. My doctor insisted I give it 6 months so I continued the medication and and since my moodiness instantly improved I gave it a chance. Those symptoms eventually became mild.,F,38,12  months1/35 1X D,6/6/2010,Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol
4, 2, High Blood Pressure,Some weight gain_ a bit of hair loss and some acne.  Have been on for seven months and went off today.  Looking forward to getting my normal self back.,,F,32,7  months,1/21/2010,Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol
5, 1, control bleeding from fibroids,spotting_ moderate cramping_ and  moderate to heavy bleeding.,The first 2 weeks great then I started spotting_ four days later my period started. I am taking these pills continuously so no fake period. Well it does not matter because I am having the mother of all periods! but I am having uterine fibroid embolization in a few days and will stay on this pill until my proceedure as the bleeding is not as bad_ if I went off I would flood with clots so this will do until then. I would not recomend this pill to anyone my fibroids hurt so much more with this pill. I am taking vicodine just on days that I have to be really active no pill should make a woman need a pain killer that strong.  One thing this pill is chewable seems convenient right_ if you are busy caught out somewhere an need to take it right away. Then you read the information book pamphlet that says you need to immediately drink 8 oz of water after chewing. How many of us would actually have water on us and how many of us if we were in a situation like that would really want to drink that much water! a man designed this pill not a woman! I have been on this pill for 5 weeks and I can not wait to get off.,F,44,1  months,3/18/2009,Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol
6, 1, Birth Control,Non-stop bleeding/spotting_ decreased sex drive_ noticeable mood swings!,This pill is horrible!! It made me bleed every single day of the 1st month I have taken the pill. I asked my doctor to switch me to another one for next month.,F,23,1  months,2/12/2009,Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol
