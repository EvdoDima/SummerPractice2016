1, 1, Stomach Ulcers (H. pylori),Extreme nausea_ dizziness_ light-headedness_ fatigue_ abdominal cramping.,I took half a dose of the drug with food and nearly immediately (within 20 minutes) felt extreme nausea. I had to take a maximum dose of nausea pills to sleep that night_ and woke up feeling nearly as bad_ with a headache and disorientation/dizziness. The nurse practitioner who prescribed it_ and later my family doctor_ both said that it is infamously hard to tolerate. My experience wasn't that uncommon.
