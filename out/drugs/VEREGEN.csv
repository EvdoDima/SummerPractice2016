0, 3, Genital Warts,There were no side effects and no pain from this medication.  I've tried Aldara and became allergic to it_ which was very painful. I've also used Condylox gel as well but it was difficult to apply it exactly to the wart only_ because of the location of my warts (inner thighs). It irriates the healthy tissue and that can compound the problem. I've had croyotherapy and electrosurgery to remove them but they had a tendency to reappear.,"Green tea extract and caffeine are the major ingredients. It has cream consistency with a reddish-brown color which is applied directly to the warts_ three times a day. The downside is that it has a tendency to stain clothing.The initial reaction of the medication is fast and the warts will turn black. With continued applications_ the warts will fall off.  From the Veregen website_ the recurrance rate is 6.8% for those who acheive complete clearance and 53.6% of the time_ it provides complete clearance.The Veregen ingredients and statistics inspired me to try and supplement the effectiveness of the treatment by buying green tea extract supplements. I take 630mg a day of those_ as well as zinc and use a lemongrass and tea tree oil soap. My theory was that I could attack the problem internally as well_ with the main Veregen ingredients.  I'm happy to say that after dealing with the problem for the last 5 years or so_ since I've tried supplementing it as well_ I've had no recurrance in the last 6 months. Maybe it's coincidence but whatever is going on_ it's worked for me.  I""m keeping my fingers crossed.",M,45,2  weeks 3X D,4/24/2012Email,Veregen
