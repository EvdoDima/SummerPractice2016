0, 5, Breast Cancer stage 3,Joints ache_ high cholesterol_ osteopenia_ hot flashes  in the beginning.,I posted about 3 years ago and stated exercise has really helped to lower cholesterol and with joint pain.  I do need to add that my 5 years was over in May but new studies have shown that 10 years on Arimidex really is better than 5 years.  My oncologist suggested I keep taking the Arimidex   After a double mastectomy_ chemo_ and radiation_ I can deal with this if it will prevent my cancer from returning.  The only reason I rated this a 5 is I believe it has kept my cancer from returning.,F,59,5  years1 MG 1X D,8/15/2016,Arimidex

I'm very small (98 lbs) so asked the oncologist if she could adjust my dosage. Can't understand how ""1 size fits all"" works with something as toxic as this pill! All take the same dosage but my body can't handle this much. I went off the pill 3 days last week_ and within 1 day my pain began to lessen_ I could run errands and had energy so I know it's this pill! Of course I went back on it after 3 days but decided I'm only taking it every other day until I see my oncologist next month. I don't know if I can handle 5 years if I feel this badly after only 9 months on it? I feel like I've aged 10 years already!",F,64,9  months1 mg 1X D,7/25/2016EmailHistory,Arimidex

I'm posting and hope to do updates at the 6 month and 1 year marks.  So far_ so good.  No side effects.  I found this website when I was searching for links asking the question as to how soon will I feel side effects.  I might end up being the lucky one or else it will hit me like a train!  I am presently taking a multi-vitamin that my radiologist said was very good.  Taking extra D-3 as a friend of mine who also had breast cancer took it and came back with excellent bone scans.  I had an Oncotype score of 10 and with no family history of cancer_ being in good physical condition_ I did radiation treatment only and it was recommended that I take Arimidex for 5 years.

Get about five hours of that.  She told me to stay on it giving me no alternatives.  Quite an unsympathetic oncologist.,I would love to stop this medication.  I'm on the generic brand.

I had been taking this medication as my surgeon and oncologist suggested me to take this to reduce my risk even further of re-occurrence of BC. Though my oncotype score came back low and they had said that with surgery and radiation my chance of my cancer coming back was less than 5-10%. Been dealing with severe joint pain and  arthritis in right shoulder near the clavical and I had a feeling it was from this medicine since I have been on it for 6 mos. The oncologist advised me to take a two week break from the arimidex which I just did while on vacation_ and I felt normal again!! She has now put me on Letrozole 2.5mg to try and if it gives me less side effects than the arimidex . If not_she will try Tamoxifin.. I will give this new medicine  a month then see what happens. Begining to think that I might just want to live with the 5-10% risk of the cancer coming back then to deal with these awful side effects.

Then had an ""episode""_ woke up with such horrible skeletal pain I thought I was being tortured on a ""rack"".  I knew I was having joint pain_ stiffness and all movements were much slower_ but thought I was just aging rapidly.  Now I have learned I have osteoporosis_ I have been treated for ""trigger finger"" with cortisone shots.  Just had a heart catharization for angina_ but no blockages were found. I called oncologist and have been taken off the medication for two weeks_ and they will check and see how I am doing.  I would rather have cancer back than take this medication.

67, 4, breast cancer stage 1,no major side effects. however the only thing i want to do on the weekend is absolutely nothing. i looked at this site to see if this might be connected. i planned on going zip lining today_ but watched TV instead. just went to the onocologist last week_ she is very interested in every pain i have - any given pain goes away. then i have another pain that pops up somewhere else. thinking about talking to my doctor about antidepressents. overall - my chance of getting cancer again was 40% now it's 4%. just need to find some zip in my life. i work full time (+)  in a stressful job. that might be the reason for fatigue and normal aches and pains,,F,58,18  months1 mg 1X D,6/13/2015,Arimidex
68, 1, Breast Cancer Stage 1B,I only took Arimidex for 30 days_ the side effects got worse by the day -  trouble sleeping_ when I did sleep didn't feel rested_ fast heart beat_ anxious_ jittery_ nervous.  The fatigue set in.  Felt dizzy and nearly fainted twice (my son caught me before I could fall).  Started sleeping 12-14 hours per day_ could not stay awake.  Dozed off at stop lights while driving.  Had to stop driving and got to the point where I couldn't go to work.  I had other symptoms like hot flashes but those I could take.  Did 2 1/2 years on tamoxifen which was much easier for me.  Still had side effects but I could handle them.  Had to stop tamoxifen due to irregular vaginal bleeding.  My oncologist didn't feel comfortable having me continue.  Can't take Arimidex and function at all.My overall health is good_ had blood work_ thyroid ultrasound_ etc. The side effects I experienced was definitely due to Arimidex.  Felt great before taking this drug and started to feel better a week after stopping Arimidex,I am just postmenopausal so perhaps this is why the side effects were so severe.,F,53,30  days10mg 1X D,6/12/2015,Arimidex
69, 1, stage 1 er+ breast cancer,serious joint pain_ particularly in hands and feet_ overall stiffness_ bone pain_ dry mouth_ vaginal dryness_  heart palpitations_ no libido_ hot flashes_ fatigue,"A horrible drug_ but I took it for  five years.  Only way I got through it was with lots of exercise to counteract the stiffness and pain.  Let's face it - this drug is chemotherapy.  Which is worse - regular chemo where your hair falls out and you feel awful for a relatively short period of time_ or arimidex_ where the side effects are less dramatic but torture you for FIVE LONG YEARS?  I could have tolerated this drug for a few months - but five years of perpetual and serious pain and debilitation was tough.  It wrecks your quality of life.  And after doing my research_ I'm not convinced I needed this drug at all.  I had a very low chance of recurrence.  Kind of like smashing a fly with a sledgehammer.  My takeaway from all this is that doctors are still pretty clueless when it comes to breast cancer and are over-treating way too many patients_ causing much unnecessary suffering.  Too many mammograms_ finding too many ""cancers"" that wouldn't have hurt you if they'd just been left alone. Just look at the statistics. It's depressing. So glad to be off this nasty probably useless drug. Anastrozole made me feel like a shriveled up old lady. Three weeks off it  and I feel so much better.",F,60,5  years1 mg 1X D,6/8/2015,Arimidex

(1 mg/day) despite side effects which I managed with pain meds.  Quality of life was good (Hey_ I was alive_working etc.) Depression was the hardest to manage.  In 2010 diagnosed with CML (a major blow).  Howeve. I felt as tho I had dodged another bullet as it was discovered early and treatable.  However meds for CML had same side effects as arimidex so I discontinued arimidex so I could take CML meds and continue with a decent quality of life.  In in 2012-13 CA15 tumor markers start climbing gradually and in Dec 2013 had scans which showed a very tiny spot on lung.  Doc put me back on Arimidex and tumor markers immediately started lowering and scans showed tiny spot getting smaller!  All due to Arimidex!  However Arimidex combined with ongoing CML drugs =  disabling.  I'm now on reduced dosage of Sprycel (cml)_ still taking Arimidex and life is manageable. I am very thankful for Arimidex.  Even during the initial 8 years I thought of it as my life saver and took it religiously.  Cheers for Arimidex!,F,66,9  years1 mg/day,4/1/2015Email,Arimidex

Had surgery & 4 weeks of radiation therapy.,"I conferred with numerous health individuals_ hospitals_ physicians_ pharmacists_ pharmaceutical companies as well as a lengthy & extensive research. To begin with Arimidex is a form of cancer chemotherapy & it is used to treat chronic conditions. It should not be given to women over the age of 60 as an adverse severe reactions in older people. Some of the side effects which may or not cause are: brittle bones_ increase of decreased blood flow to the heart_ special concerns regarding cleaning waste (urine_ feces_ vomit etc.) using rubber gloves & washing hands after removable of gloves. It gives some thought on its toxicity. Also increases high cholesterol.I decided that the ""quality of life"" was more important at my age.Having had my surgery & radiation therapy_ I would go no further. I did see a nutritionist_ who guided me to healthy eating habits & diet for losing some weight. It is after all my body and my decision.

I was the only person who could answer that question. For me_ I chose to live a more physically and emotionally comfortable life. Life has risks_ even just getting into a car every day carries great risk. I have not regretted my choice and gave careful thought to my decision.

Since the symptoms eased I have taken one dose per day.  I have exercised throughout and managed not to put on any extra weight.  The joint pain and tiredness is awful particularly in the winter so my sympathies go out to all taking this drug as the decision of whether to continue with it is a hard decision.,F,62,4  years10 1X D,8/12/2014,Arimidex
108, 5, early stage breast cancer 1a,Just lately_ I THINK arimidex is responsible for two bouts of severe vomiting and concurrent diarrhea less than 2 weeks apart.   Can find no other reason for this.,I'm sure arimidex contributes to the pain I have from DJD in thoracic and lumbar spine_ wrists_ knees and ankles.  Also some depression_ very emotional and fatigue.   Just the latest two episodes of vomiting and diarrhea occurring together and  waking me from sound sleep are troublesome.  I can't imagine going through too many of those episodes---the other side effects I can put up with if cancer doesn't reoccur.,F,69,3  years1 mg 1X D,8/9/2014Email,Arimidex
109, 1, Breast Cancer,I have just had a lumpectomy and now my doctor wants me to take Arimidex.  I have bad side effects to most drugs and try to do things holistically.  Tumor was 1.5 cm E& P + but two nodes negative.  No family history.,I am VERY active and am concerned how this drug will effect my quality of life.  The Doc SHOVED a 2 week sample pack at me today and said I should at least TRY it.  One thing that no one seems to address here is the sexual aspect of this drug.  My husband and I are very sexually active and this concerns me.  I am thinking of just having radiation and not taking this drug.  Sure I want a long life but I think QUALITY of life is more important to me ..

Natural anti-inflammatories. They help tremendously.  Also_ I am starting Stinging Nettle.  I work out a lot; but what helps the most is walking in a pool_ or a water aerobics class_ or swimming_ of course.  It loosens your joints and just makes you feel better.I want to also give you a diet strategy that works for me--I am 5' 5 3/4"" and weight 129.   I am not naturally thin.   But_ I am a successful dieter.  The trick is to eat earlier.  That's it!  It doesn't matter what you eat in the morning and up to about 3:30 in the afternoon.  So you have your main meal at about 2:30-3:30.   You eat a good meal and you can even have dessert.  No diet foods.    At about 8:30 or 9 you might start to feel a tinge of hunger.  So_  you eat something really light_ but enough to hold you until the next morning_ when you can eat whatever you want.  If you still feel a  bit hungry at 10 or 11_ then have a tiny no-carb snack_ like a piece of cheese and celery.  If you do this_ you are guaranteed a 1 lb weight loss daily.   The problem is that this is when most people lose their self restraint.   With this method_ you just tell yourself that you'll go easy at night and have whatever you want for breakfast.  This works!  I just want to give hope to you girls who have gained weight and are feeling hopeless.  This is how I do it.  Good luck_ my friends",F,65,6  months1 mg 1X D,5/16/2013Email,Arimidex

Still need sleeping pills to get a decent nights rest. Felt like I was turning into a cripple overnight!,Stopped the arimidex after 2 months.

Now I'm using alternative medicine to get my body back on track towards helping to resolve the damage done.

I'd like to thank everyone who blogged here_ it made me decide to look further and forego this.  It doesn't 'cure' anything_ it just lowers your chances of recurrence very slightly.  My idiot (now fired) oncologist told me that my request for a bilateral mastectomy after diagnosis of IIA invasive ductal and also LCIS in the lumpectomy specimen was 'overkill' and called it 'like having a splinter in your toe and amputating your foot'.  I told him that I didn't have a splinter_ I had diagnosed cancer_ and that I was using my feet but my boobs at 59 were trying to kill me and weren't exactly in use anymore_ either! What a jackass_ beware if you live in Roseburg_ Oregon.  I'd put in his name if I thought it wouldn't get me in trouble. He smugly told me that I'd never find a surgeon to do a bilateral on me (with apparently large amounts of LCIS on one side_ I presume also on the other); I talk to the surgeon next week who did my lumpectomy_ I trust him and we'll see what he says.  But no way I'm taking any drug that reduces your estrogen levels down to zilch; this is insane.  Your body_ your bones_ your joints and your brains need a little bit of estrogen.  The data on this says it doesn't change survival rates. If I was younger or had young children_ I might be willing to throw everything at it_ but at this point_ I can't die young anymore.

This caused problems with my uterus and I had a hysteroscopy and biopsy in January 2003.  I was taken off tamoxifen and put on arimidex until September 2004.  Some time after I experienced painful ankles but did not associate it with my treatment.  Then I experienced pain and stiffness in my hands.

203, 1, BC Stage 1 Lumpectomy_ Radiation,Started with hot flashes (never had them during menopause) so severe they caused painful boils to occur in armpits first_ then groin/crotch area_ under breasts which was controlled by treating topically.  Eventually got painful boils inside nose_ ears etc_ which couldn't be treated.  Started getting weak in joints_ especially pain in knees_ thighs_ and general fatigue_ didn't realize this was connected to Anastozle/Arimidex until I read other comments on this site and cried for myself and others who felt like a 90+ woman.  Always active before_ doing Zumba 2-3 x a week to walking with a cane in 1 year. Did research online and found out drug was not a cure_ it was just a drug that MIGHT keep breast cancer away_ but meanwhile not having estrogen could be and was worse for quality of life.  Mother and grandmother had b/c so I thought I had to keep taking it so I could live longer_ but this wasn't living. Stopped taking it 7 months ago and most symptoms have stopped.  Can think better--not,"Stopping Anastozle/Arimidex was VERY difficult.  Suffered with pain and symptoms longer than I should have--at least a year and a half_ didn't believe there was an alternative_ oncologist told me it was my decision. Decided to take chance_ wanted my life back. I try to eat healthy (always did_ but more plant based diet/organic as possible now--less chemicals--minimize processed food--try to eat more raw food.)  Everyone should watch documentary ""Forks over Knives"" to learn how bad meat and diary products are for us.  Haven't decided yet if I will get annual mammograms_ not sure if more radiation is good.  Mother died of heart problems at 89 after having a mastectomy at 55 and kidney removed for kidney cancer at 75.  I hope to live to dance_ do Zumba and watch my grandson (he's 5 mo. old) get married.

I found it under armpit--won't fit mammo plate. Doc told me only 1 in 10 BC's are hereditary & mammos miss 20% of tumors--lucky me.  My BC estrogen receptive_ 2006 had lumpectomy_ chemo_ radiation_ told need Arimidex for 5 years.  Ignoring 20 side effects mentioned in warnings_ in two years I had chronic UTI's/bladder inflammation_ cholesterol up from lifetime of 170's to 230_ bone density (had ostopenia already) within decimal point of spinal osteoporosis_ & for 1st time _ hideous hot flashes & insomnia.  Told oncologist I refused to take it any longer_ I'd rather go through BC again than be on dialysis (bladder/kidney failure)_ fractured hip/wheelchair (osteoporosis)_ stroke/heart attack from blocked arteries. He OK_ said in 2 years_ I'd gained 75% of Arim. benefits_ asked if be willing to tamoxifen--agreed for one year only-told I'd need lifetime statins & UTI medication.  Dumped UTI prescription_ urologist OK's cranberry gels instead_ & now rarely need prescription.  Told ob/gyn get I mammos to humor her--now get BREAST COIL MRI's. Arimidex?--if estrogen caused BC every woman on planet would die of BC.  Keep eye on your kidneys_ cholesterol and bone density_ girls. If over 50_ remember--Big Pharma tests drugs on people in 20's & 30's with  prime-of-life kidneys and livers--organs that process meds--read ALL side effects careful,F,74,2  years 1X D,3/20/2012Email,Arimidex

I had this condition way before I got cancer.  My vitamin intake has NOT helped my bone pain.,Have quit the medicine 2 wks ago.  Have had a very slight lessening of the pain but surprisingly no improvement in trying to walk.  Doubt if I will take a substitute now being offered.

244, 1, BC Stage 2_ in 1 node_ lumpectomy,None - I stood up to my oncologist(s) and told them I was NOT going to take Armidex.  Thanks to you on this website!,I decided my body had had enough poison with chemo & radiation after being dx in 8/09. I said NO to my oncologist who said I needed to take arimidex. She then suggested I try to loose weight. I am down 18 pounds so far and feel fine. I asked her if she would take it if she was in my shoes and she would not give me a straight answer. Yes_ I maybe taking a chance but you poor women who are on this and hurt/feel old - GET OFF of it! - just because a doctor says you should take it does not mean it's good for you.  Eat right_excercise_ take a greens drink and turmeric daily and stay away from processed foods.  I just had to change oncologists and he is preaching at me to take it too - I flat out told him NO_ and that's my final answer. Those of you who are at the point of being told you need to take it -think hard on your decision.  It might be too late once you start and for some it sounds like the damage is irreversible.  I don't regret my decision not to take and if the cancer comes back_ so be it. I just know in my gut that this drug is not the answer for me.,F,55,0  daysn/a 1X D,3/6/2012Email,Arimidex

249, 1, BC Stage 1_ lumpectomy,During the 5 years_ relatively no side effects. I didn't even ever feel the need to research side effects. My problems began after I went off the drug. Three months after ceasing the drug (taken 1x daily for 5 years) I gained a LOT of weight_ seemingly overnight. My weight went up by over 20 lbs._ and I did not change my eating_ exercise_ etc. Just piled on. And I cannot lose it_ now 3 years later. Secondly_ a year ago my feet started getting numb on the bottoms starting at the little toe_ down the outside of the bottom of the feet. I can feel touch through the skin if I touch them_ but they feel very numb_ especially sitting and worse yet_ at night in bed. I didn't even associate the numbness with the drug until I decided to look into the possibility. My health is pretty good other than the feet and the  weight gain. I believe it's the Arimidex that is causing these symptoms_ but remiss to understand why they were delayed until after I stopped the drug.,I think we are a nation of too much drug taking for too many reasons.

Almost 10 yrs later_ I *age 48) was diagnosed with a new primary BC.  After BC#2_ I took tamoxifin for a short time (3-4 months).  I was switched to Arimidex_ which I took for almost 3 years.  I took myself off  I was literally at a Race for the Cure & could not finish the walk_ my feet were in such pain & had gone numb.  From Arimidex_ I had weight gain_ headaches_ severe joint pain_ sleep issues_ but as many say I was 50 walking like an 80 yr old.

Carpul tunnel started in my fingers_ mobility declined_ I could hardly walk_ depression_ morbidity_ fear_ pain_ liver started to become heterogeneous_ cysts formed (I dont know if this is linked but it wasnt all found before Arimidex)_ my kidney is atrophic_ and gallbladder problems.  Not sure if they are linked with Arimidex or Tamoxifen which caused another list of side effects which ended up with several operations_ and counting.  My oncologist told me that I was to stop Arimidex for six months as I showed her the nuclear scan that showed inflammation on feet and knee joints.  Not put me onto anything else due to organ problems and the fact that Tamoxifen messed me up to_ so there doesnt seem to be any alternative for me_ so now I am damaged more_ and unprotected. But I must add that the pain has almost deminished after two weeks_ I feel happier_ the depression still has lifted (not the worry as too many health issues)_ I am more mobile now_ no more hot flashes.

When I finished taking Arimidex_ it took 6 months for the joint stiffness to lessen and 18 months before it totally went away. I would take it again if I had to do it over. Feel like it helped my chances of survival. Gave me peace of mind that I was doing what I needed to beat this vs doing nothing. One thing I would do over is ask my oncologist about increasing calcium while on Arimidex. No one mentioned that Arimidex is hard on your bones (maybe they didn't know it that far back_ when it was new). My last year on Arimidex_ I had a bone density test because I was on Arimidex - showed some issue_ not serious_ but the beginning  of osteopenia. I am now taking 1500 MG of calcium everyday.

316, 2, stage 1 lobular breast cancer,This is a follow up to my 3/2/11 posting. I went on generic Arimidex in late October_ 2010 and stopped in early March_ 2011 because of the many side effects that were affecting my life. I feel back to normal now after 4 months off the drug.  PLEASE REPORT YOUR SIDE EFFECTS TO THE FDA BY CALLING 1-800-FDA-1088. If side effects aren't reported_ they have no idea how many people are having negative reactions. FDA told me when I reported mine that they review all reports_ then report any previously unreported side effects to the drug manufacturers. However_ if side effects are reported by patients directly to the manufacturer_ they are bound by law to send that information to the FDA. Having our voices heard by telling our stories is the only way to let the drug companies and the FDA know that we are having problems with their products.,When my doctor brushed off my reports of side effects_ I asked one of my other doctors whom I respect for a referral to another oncologist. I appreciated the new doctor's attitude_ and when I told him about my side effects_ he agreed_ that there are people who simply cannot tolerate these medicines_ but it's uncertain as to why that is. He has laid out a course of action to determine which way is best for me to proceed (possibly Tamoxifen). In the past few years_ I have decided that I am no longer going to stay with any doctor that does not follow through or seems disinterested in my concerns. I am seldom ever sick_ but obviously breast cancer is something that needs close monitoring. I want a doctor who is my advocate_ is willing to listen to my experiences with treatment. I have researched countries that have a better health care track record than the US (UK and Canada_ for instance) and learned that both countries have had side effect reporting systems in place for nearly 50 years_ prompted by the thalidomide tragedy. The UK has the Yellow Card System_ with cards in pharmacies_ doctor's offices and other medical sites where people can fill out the card and then submit it to the UK's equivalent to the FDA. Canada has a user-friendly form to fill out and both country's websites are easy to navigate and are very informative. If we can be pro-active and insist on being respected rather than ignored_ it may encourage others to do the same.,F,66,4  months1 mg 1X D,5/19/2011Email,Arimidex

Many of these side effects get significantly worse as time goes on_ and do not go away when you go off the drug.  I only regret staying on as long as I did [6 months]_ and tolerating the pain until it became almost debilitating.  I am only hoping the damage to my joints is not permanent and will continue to improve.  I am on an exercise program and I watch my diet carefully.   Quality of life is more important than quantity.

I am still taking arimidex (am going into 5th year_ hopefully my last)  Am experiencing much the same side effects_ they really haven't got a whole lot worse in the last two years.   I would say the body aches and pains and lack of energy still the worst.,I did try going off this drug for 4 months in 2010_ but there was no improvement in how I felt?????  Maybe it will just take longer for me than others???  I have decided to stay on it for as long as doctors recommend.  Even though it is hard to deal with these side effects_ I am alive!!  I admit_  there definitely were times that I have just wanted to throw these pills in the trash_ but then I read the research and the results this drug is having and I just look at it as one more part of treatment that I need to get thru.

What is helping is: started taking a B complex along with multi_ & herbal adrenal support that contains guarana (seed)_ mate (leaf)_ kola nut (seed)_ licorice (root)_ watercress (leaf)_ wild yam root. Had some concern about yam root because I've heard it is a plant estrogen_ but found out it must be synthesized in a lab to have the effect. Onc ok'd. Also taking homeopathic arimidex from health & nutrition store (homeopathic is a very diluted form that is supposed to act like a vaccine against side effects - you take along with prescription arimedex) I'm not big on that sort of thing but I was desperate and now feel like I can make it through.

I took the Arimidex for approximately 3 months and stopped it because of brain fog & hot flashes. It was the biggest mistake I ever made because in November 2010 I found out my cancer had metastasized to almost every bone in my body including my skull_ many clusters of lymph nodes and to the intra peritoneum on my stomach.  My oncologist immediately put me on Arimidex and after only 2 1/2 months my cancer has shrunk by 83%!  If I had stayed on Arimidex after my first dx. of bc in 2001 I would probably not be writing this now.  My first breast cancer was very_ very small and I was sure it would never come back but I was wrong_ it took 9 years for it to return and when it did_ it returned with a vengeance!

I've filed a report with FDA's (on-line) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program_ which includes side effects to medications.  I quit taking Arimidex on my own after 3 months because I wasn't going to live the best remaining years of my life_ 68 to 73_ debilitated by 11 symptoms.  After 3 months off my oncologist insists the remaining side effects (mostly leg pain & stiffness that wake me at night) are probably arthritis.  Yet on Askapatient I find the support of over 1_800 women_ many who have discontinued the drug and often still suffer_ sometimes for years.  The FDA needs to know this...please report!  I still can't stand without pushing myself up_ never had arthritis before. Arimidex has a 6% to 12% chance of working_ severe side effects_ should only be prescribed to late-stage patients or those who don't experience life-altering symptoms.  Otherwise Arimidex should be used only on a monitored trial basis to see if symptoms appear_ then withdrawn unless the patient chooses to continue. This is chemo/poison in a pill.

347, 2, stage 1 lobular breast cancer,This is a follow-up to my post of 12/5/10. I have many side effects after 4 months being on the generic form of Arimidex. I am going to stop this medication because of how its use has affected my life. Rated 2 (this medicine did not work to my satisfaction)_ rather than 1 (I would not recommend taking this medicine) because others have not had a negative experience and it may work fine for them.,When I started this medication_ I had good energy and was able to function well in my daily life. The constant nagging aches and pains_ hair loss_ GERD symptoms_ fatigue_ memory problems and foggy thinking_ and strange_ brief sudden pains in various places in my body have convinced me that this drug is toxic for me. The hot flashes are manageable_ but the other symptoms are seriously affecting me. I am very concerned that because the side effects are increasing_ that my quality of life is in jeopardy. I can't imagine taking this drug for 5 years. I had no problems with my lumpectomy surgery and no problems with radiation and had good energy through it all and had a good attitude. I still have a positive outlook_ and feel that my mental outlook will improve when my body has a chance to recover from the effects of the drug. It is a risk to stop; I understand that and accept it. I wish all of you well and see that some posts indicate no side effects at all -- it just shows how each individual processes the drug differently. The observation from several people questioning why the dosage is exactly the same for everyone is a point well taken.

Instead_ I seem to just be on a downhill slope of increasing and new symptoms. My ""chemo brain"" doesn't seem to be getting any better. I'm having trouble finding the right words and remembering things. I can't seem to get enough sleep and even fall asleep at my desk and computer. Getting up to walk is SO painful and sometimes I just have to PULL myself up_ FORCE a foot to move_ and literally WILL my legs to move. I look like I'm twice my age_ but once I'm up and going_ I walk pretty well - just a bit slower than normal. The bone pain is the worst part of it all and is absolutely excruciating. I developed neuropathy from chem",Even with the problems that I've had with this drug_ I'm so glad that these drugs exist_ because if each drug can help keep just one person alive and cancer-free_ it's doing its job. Recovery didn't come without discomfort and staying alive won't either! I'd rather be here with my family_ friends_ and precious children in my class and all the people that I have yet to meet with pain as my companion than to just feel like a sitting duck waiting helplessly for cancer to strike again. At least we're armed!,F,49,4  months1 mg 1X D,2/2/2011Email,Arimidex
358, 3, Breast Cancer - estrogen driven,I have been on Arimidex 2 and a half years. I have had all of the horrible side effects: unbearable hot flashes_ extreme joint pain_ felt like a 90 year old woman.  When I was sitting and stood up_ it took me a minute to be able to walk and the walking was very painful until I had walked for a while.  I usually exercise 7 hours a week_ the elliptical and weights and have been able to keep that up.  But I am writing because I have started taking some supplements that have been like a miracle for me.  I take 2 - 500mg of turmeric a day and 8 oz. of Light grape juice with 1 T of CERTO mixed into the grape juice.  I am almost back to my old self.  The pain is not gone_ but much_ much better and the hot flashes have lessened.  I just had to share_ this has been like a lifesaver for me.

Originally took Femara but side effects were worse than Arimidex.  Stopped Arimidex 4 days ago and the pain is starting to go away.  Oncologist recommended acupuncture but it didn't work. Also had MRI on spine & it showed inflammation.  Inflammation is also dangerous for the body.  I don't trust that these side effects are temporary.  I cannot risk permanently damaging my joints at my age.  I was on so many drugs to counter side effects that I felt like I was living in a fog. These aromatase inhibitors are horrible drugs.  I would rather have had 6 months on chemo and be done.  Oncotype DX test said I did not need chemo.  I had a lumpectomy with clear margins_ no +nodes & radiation.

368, 2, breast cancer,I've had them all!  Last summer I was switched to the generic by my insurance and I think that has been the cause of my latest problems.  At the end of October I had a severe allergic reaction and ended up in the ER and in ICU for a day and a night.  It was blamed on my ace inhibitor but I really think the arimidex(generic) is the root cause. And since late summer I have had very dry itching skin and rash/hives.  I am only 30 days away from finishing the drug but I am seriously considering stopping now.  I can't control the rash and it's getting worse.  Every medication I take has been changed except for this one.  I'm just not sure I can make it through the next 30 days.

I opted for double mastectomy... but I was 60 at the time and cosmetically it wasn't as big an issue as it would have been in my younger years.  At the same time as the b.c. diagnosis_ I was told I had a bad form of thyroid cancer - so had a thyroidectomy at the same time as mastectomies.  My philosophy has become that if it can be removed totally - get the sucker outta there.

383, 4, stage 1 lobular breast cancer,Because I am very sensitive to medications since I take so few of them_ I was very concerned about possible side effects with this drug. I was relieved when I did not experience anything but some aches and pains during the first week of taking the generic form of Arimidex.I have to switch to the brand in January_ as my Part D insurance no longer covers the generic (it only costs $3.00 for a 30 day supply!).,My life is very active_ with at least three hours every day of heavy lifting of water and feed for my livestock as well as tending a large garden. The lumpectomy and radiation went very well and I had very little down time_ side effects or lack of energy for either one. Important: I insisted on being referred by my family physician to an endocrinologist to have my thyroid medication adjusted_ as I was feeling very tired -- this was before any surgery or radiation. (I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's in 1968.) The results of the new medication adjustment have been amazing. Not everyone has thyroid issues_ but if fatigue is one of your side effects_ it might be worth asking to be checked for a full thyroid panel. Staying positive_ being physically active every day (including 30 minutes of easy exercises to help get the kinks out) and focusing on things that I enjoy helped me through an experience that I certainly had not planned on. My thoughts are with all of you for a good outcome.

I had a very poor prognosis originally and took responsibility to change what was out of balance.I researched and started some natural interventions before I had surgery (22cm + over 1/2 kilo and 22 nodes removed)_ reluctantly had radiation_ refused chemo. My surgeon said I was 'extraordinarily fortunate' when he read the results after surgery (he expected the worst as my tumor had doubled in two weeks) - I agree but credit some of that result to the protocols I had already started.

Not tiredness - absolute life sapping fatigue that leaves me confused and tearful with a general feeling of awful malaise. I can't see properly or hear properly_ I just want to curl up in a ball and close my eyes. Rest really doesn't seem to improve it - I can't predict when it will strike me down either as it comes and goes randomly like the hot flushes.

Most nights I am in bed by 7:30 in the hope that total rest will get me through the next day. It usually doesn't. I am wondering if Tamoxifen will be a better option. Maybe I shall give this another year and then swap. Has anyone gone from Arimidex to Tamoxifen?I will not stop this treatment because I want to live to bring up my kids.

Please refer to it for a comparison to what I say today.,I still have bad joint pain in my knees and stiffness all over. It is difficult to sit down or to stand up without my knees hurting. For the last year_ I have had extreme tingling_ numbness_ burning in my middle 3 fingers on my right hand.  Orthopedic hand surgeon said it was carpal tunnel_ so one month ago I had carpal tunnel surgery. It has helped so far_ but this surgery is a very long healing process and I won't know for months if the surgery has really done the trick. Diet makes a huge difference to me. I take a lot of calcium (Citracal with D3)_ my vitamin with D_ and extra D3 daily. I also take glucosomine with MSM and Fosamax. I eliminate as much refined sugar as possible and no red meat. The only sugar I eat is in fruits. I eat as many different veggies as possible (limited potatoes). For meat_ I eat salmon and chicken. Exercise (slow walking and recumbant bike) helps me a great deal. I do not have to take daily naps anymore_ only an occasional one. I sleep okay at night. My energy level and stamina are not what they were before breast cancer_ but surely improved over what they were a year ago. My oncologist will never convince me that my troubles are not due to Arimidex.

After discussing this drug in my cancer support group_ there seem to be those who have few side effects or many side effects.  I feel like this drug is toxic for my body_ but I am still taking it just like I did the chemo drugs - which some worked for me and others didn't.  I lost my breasts_ that hurt but in the big picture_ but okay if you keep your life.  Now I seem to be losing my memory and thought process which is brutal.  Lack of sleep and joint pain  are issues also.  If I didn't walk 3 miles a day and do yoga twice a week_ my body would become stiff and ache.

I went online and researched benefits of vitamins. LADIES take 2_000 to 4_000 IU of Vitamin D3 Liquid SoftGels daily and you will be amazed! I take 1_000 IU in the morning and one in the afternoon and my pain has disappeared. NO JOKE! Also...Make sure you are taking atleast 1200 MG of Calcium for your bones. I am taking a combined 4600 IU of Vitamin D3 which includes what is in my multi vitamin and calcium supplements. I thought maybe this was just my imagination but no. My daughter and a friend suffer with back pain and I told them to take 1_000 IU of Vitamin D3 AND their back pain is gone! Please don't suffer anymore. OH...and it has helped my mood! Take some Vitamin D3 and let your pain melt away. It's very difficult to overdose on the vitamin_ so experiement to see what dose works for your joint pain.  YOU WILL BE AMAZED! Besides...fighting cancer is not going to be easy. We need to remember that the cancer drug will only work if you take it.

Interviews with BC survivors show increased weight and reports of stronger food cravings.  The study's current hypothosis is that in response to Arimidex suppressing estrogen production_the body tries to boost estrogen by adding fat cells (which produce estrogen).

I do 4 mile walking tapes and stomach exercises daily..no reduction to that spare tire.

525, 4, treatment for breast cancer,I started this drug right after my surgery and prior to my radition and chemo so might not have noticed any true drug reactions for awhile.  Did have some issues with hot flashes and short term memory but was blaming chemo.  After completion of the other treatments though found that both my blood pressure and cholestral had elevated and had to start medication.  Have gained back the weight plus a couple of pounds but I seem to be hungry all the time...is this the drug or me out of control?  Am trying to make better choices as I am way to fat already. What has really affected me though is the tingling in the third and fourth fingers on my right hand that has turned into semi-permenant numbness.  For a couple of weeks both hands were tingling and falling asleep and it really was affecting my sleep due to the pain when they would reawake. Luckily it's just the right hand now.  Other problem is my knees.  Having the same problem as others with stiffness when I get up.  Hobble for awhile an,Intend to try and stay on the full five years.  Hope my Onco Dr will be more sympathic though_ all he had to say was my knee problem could be relieved through weight loss....duh  Am really tired of everyone just telling me I'm getting old and they are having all off these problems too.

I am happy to say that slowly over the period of time I am almost back to where I consider normal and will begin exercising again shortly.  I am due to see the oncologist on Tues and what I hope to do is to go back on the drug with an alternate treatment say every two or three days because I believe it works but cannot live with the everyday dosage.  The brain is sharper also_ however_ that was not why I withdrew on 11/27.  The pain was so unbearable I wasn't sure I could continue with life that way.  All of my friends in the support group have experience these symptoms to some degree but most before 3 years.  So I should consider myself lucky_ I guess.  I will hang in there on my terms and resume taking it although I think that it did do me good to know I would return to a normal state and would not have an altered existence from this drug for life.  I hope this helps.  Oh_ by the way_ I did go to an orthepedist to check out my hips and knees and had an mri that assured me all was ok in that department so I know that these effects were from the Arimidex.

Dr. of Internal Med. denied it could be medication related and just insists I lose weight.  I am slightly overwieght and know that might help but I actually weigh less than I did b-4 starting Arimidex and my pressure was good_ so I suspect the drug.  Now I read high blood pressure can be a side effect of Arimidex. I need to show that info to the doc at my next appointment and see what he has to say.  I suppose the answer will be to put me on a B.P. lowering med. much like I am on an arthritis drug_ both_ which I am sure_ are a result of taking Arimidex.  Staying on for another 1.5 years and having out of control B.P. along with all the other problems is making me think it might be time to quit and take my chances.,F,60,3.5  years,12/10/2009,Arimidex

However I consider this a positive as it is unlikely that Arimidex caused the problem that quickly and had I not started taking it I would not have been given the DEXA scan and so would not now be taking medication to stop this getting worse - so great for that! Taking your oestrogen levels to nothing though is a different matter. That's been the most difficult thing because of the impact in the emotional department! It's so hard to deal with sometimes.

I developed deQuervains ( a thumb tendonitis) that got so bad I needed an injection.  It returned but by then I had read that arimidex can cause these kind of things.  I just decided to deal with it and adapt how I use my hands to prevent recurrence.  Also took lots of motrin.  I have experienced weight gain_ hot flashes(less on arimidex) _ fatigue (I take daily naps when possible)_ irritability and lots of joint pain.  I do strength training and had to cut back because of joint_tendon and muscle pain.  I am 52 and feel like I'm 80 when I get up off the floor_ off the couch or out of the car.,I saw my oncologist today and was pleasantly surprised.  I had taken Tamoxifen 3 years and after my hysterectomy which put me in surgical menopause_ she put me on Arimidex.  She said I would be on it for 5 years.  She changed her mind today and decided that I had been on both drugs (Tamoxifen 3 yrs_ Arimidex 2 yrs) for a total of 5 years and she said thats enough.  She felt the benefit of 3 more years of Arimidex would not be so great_ compared to all the side effects I have been experiencing and could develop later on_ like osteoporosis.  So HURRAY!_   I can't wait for the joint pain to go away.  Hopefully I'll have less fatigue and get my strength back.,F,52,2  years,10/20/2009Email,Arimidex

Hot flashes_ night sweats_ high blood pressure_ insomnia_ irritable_ numbness of toes.  Totally miserable!,I hate the way I feel taking this drug.  I try to stay positive but the side effects are taking their toll.  I have an active 9 year old and cant even enjoy doing the basics because of the joint stiffness/pain.  Im strongly leaning towards stop taking the drug and go for a good quality of life.  Im taking just about every vitamin out there.

606, 1, It was prescribed for breast cancer,I read extensively on the web about all the horrible side effects this med can cause_ and declined it when my oncologist insisted that I take it.  A hungry person may accept moldy bread if that is all that is available; it is a shame and abomination that this kind of med is all that doctors can offer to women to prevent cancer recurrence.

I know that bone loss occurs immediately when starting this drug_ and I don't want to take bisphosphonates_ which are prescribed for bone loss.

My joints are so stiff I feel like I am 85 when I try to get up from a sitting of lying down position.  I am now tole this medication can be taken indefinitely.  I have a lung problem too and when all the pr0oblems are taken together my life is pretty miserable.

I was on Effexor for hot flashes etc_ but had a loss of sex drive_ fuzzy brain and still had the hot flashes.  So went off the Effexor and have much more energy etc.  I see an accupunturist once a week which has helped much more than the Effexor.  But my tailbone hurts like heck.  Both onocologists don't seem to think it's caused by arimidex.  However I stopped taking it 4 days ago and already feel better.  So I'm scheduling an appointment with a pain doctor to discuss managment of it and hope to be able to go back on it. I also plan on having my accupunturist work on it as well.

I'm not working (hard to find a job I want to do) and I'm craving soy (which I don't eat).  I know having all the estrogen sucked out of my body has been very very hard for all of me.

So I wear big hats and long sleeves if I know I'll be in the sun.  I supplement with extra Vit. D.  My hands and knees give me the most trouble.  My fingers hurt and I cannot close my hands completely against my palms.  I've gone to an orthopedic doctor for my knees.  He took x-rays and says it's the beginning of arthritis. My knees ache/hurt the worst while I'm trying to sleep. A bone density test (before I started taking Arimidex) showed I have beginning osteopenia.  In the morning I am stiff all over.  The more I move_ the easier it is. I go to our City rec center every other day and exercise on the recumbent bike for 20-30 minutes and two other machines that exercise the front and back of my legs.  It helps my knees.

I will continue with it and pray that my body does not have to endure another side effect.  I am going to persevere.

I've also began having some serious dental problems. I brush 2-3 times a day_ and floss daily. I have never had dental problems before. Therefore I am seriously thinking about stopping the medication.,I have remained cancer free_ but I can't say that it is because of the Arimidex because honestly_ I forget to take it sometimes.

I have changed my diet 100% - have not gained one ounce.  I also drink wheat grass daily in addtion to pomegranate juice.  I see a certified nutritionist weekly and again have to say that the side effects I have experienced such as hot flashes and night sweats_ while a bit uncomfortable are not terrible.  I wear cotton only_ in layers_ and keep my enviornment on the cool side. I did experience depression but in all honesty_ I don't think it was from the Arimidex_ rather it was from the diagnosis.  I did start on Lexapro around the same time and feel 100% better.  I do feel that I have tolerated the drug very well and do hope that it continues along this path. I share this with you to offer possible suggestions that may ease the side effects for some,While I would prefer to not have to be on Arimidex_ this is the hand that has been dealt to me and I will do whatever I can to have some control over my destiny - hopefully and to never have to experience BC or any other cancer again_ God willing.

After 7 1/2 months on Arimidex_ I quit.  My oncologist agreed but suggested that I try Aromasin.  After 6 weeks on Aromasin and experiencing an increase in the joint swelling and pain in my hands (including a diagnosis of carpal tunnel and trigger thumb to the point I couldn't use it anymore)_ I quit taking Aromasin.  I have now been off any aromatase inhibitor for 6 weeks. Although my thumb is better_ I still can't wear my wedding ring because of the joint swelling.  The good news is that I no longer wake at night in pain and can now climb stairs easily (no pain in my knees and hips).  I encourage others who are experiencing severe side effects to talk to their oncologists about the trade offs (what is the risk of your cancer returning versus the decrease in quality of life due to the aromatase inhibitors).,F,55,7  months,7/13/2009,Arimidex

Fortunately I have an oncologist who agrees that this med is not for everyone.  I have drastically changed my diet_ lost about 35 lbs. and go to the gym 4 days a week.  He agreed (off the chart) that by keeping my immune system  strong my chances were nearly as good if I took the med.  Add to that quality of life and for me it was a no brainer.

My co-pay on the med. has risen steadily though_ seems like I pay more each time I have to order it!!To those of you that have just started taking the medicine_ more than likely your side effects will lessen over time_ when I started the medication I absolutely hated it and quite honestly thought I just couldn't go on with it.

Sleepless nights.,I took Tamoxifen for 18months for primary Grade 2 breast cancer_ but the cancer returned in my ovaries_ so had complete hysterectomy and ovarian cyst removed.  My Oncologist put me on Arimidex_ but had really bad stiffness in joints_ so she changed me to Femara after 1 year.  Took Femera for 3months_ but the pains got so bad could hardly walk_ so was changed back to Arimidex.  Seems to be the lessor of the two evils.  I'd rather not take any drug_ but as the cancer has come back once_ terrified it'll come back again_ so don't have much choice.

After lumpectomy_ chemo_ radiation_ and Arimidex I have passed my 5 year mark_ so I have to give it a rating of 5. I trusted my team of doctors_ especially my oncologist_ and did what they said. I met with him last week and have been off the pill for a week. He said there is no study that shows any benefit for me to take it longer than my 5 years. He also told me it would take 3 or 4 months to get it all out of my system. And he informed me side effects should subside. I am excited at the prospects of feeling better_ although after 5 years I am not sure what better or normal is for a post menopausal 52 year old woman. The mind is a funny thing though_ even after 1 week off of the drug I seem better. I would like to say that exercising helped so much with my aches and general state of mind_ wished it would have helped more with the weight though.

Replens is a product that contains no estrogen and can be used as much as you like (more than the directions say).  It helps with the dryness although it tends to drain out so I try to use it at night.  I would have given this a 4 rating except for the dryness and emotional thing.  I guess it's doing its job.

I'm also not sure how to rate a product when I can't predict if I will be diagnosed with cancer again at some time in the future - so I gave it a 3 and I'm assuming it's doing it's job and ""helped somewhat"". I'm adding vitamin D3 to see if it helps with foot pain. Arm pain mysteriously disappeared after a weekend of painting! I'm cutting back on all soy and flaxseed products in my diet after reading that they add estrogen to your system (exactly what the Arimidex is supposed to delete from your system!). Wish I could still have some estrogen for my skin's sake! The fatigue comes and goes so maybe its a biorhythm thing? I don't understand some posts here that are from women who have only been on Arimidex for a few days. That's not enough time to make a judgement. And I also don't understand why anyone would be on Arimidex for more than the recommended 5 year limit. My experience with Arimidex side effects has been mild so far_ but I will continue observing and trying to be ""my own best doctor"". Blessings_ Namaste.",F,59,18  months,3/26/2009Email,Arimidex

I started by mistake. My cat likes me to get on the floor and play with her_ so in the process of getting up and down_ I found some relief. I then started doing some simple yoga stretches and I almost feel back to normal.If this is the worst I am going to feel_ then I'm ok with it. Afterall_ who wants breast cancer.

At the time I found that massage and reflexology helped somewhat. Now I have found that the side effects have improved a lot. I swim a lot and do some cycling also. Walking is still difficult. This may have something to do with the weight gain_ which does not seem to respond to the excercise and I still have a degree of stiffness in my joints. But overall the symptoms have definitely improved with time and my quality of life is very good. I wish you all very well and hope we all live long and happy lives.

Have had a series of joint aches_ carpal tunnel_ frozen shoulder_ and other symptoms that could be attributed to Arimidex but may just have to do with being 55. But the most frustrating side effect has been the effect on my weight - and I KNOW that's the Arimidex. Two years before I was diagnosed_ I lost 55 pounds through diet and exercise.  I know that the level of fitness I had reached helped me bounce back from surgery and through chemo.  Now_ on Arimidex_ my body seems primed to gain.  I can lose if I drastically reduce calories and up the exercise_ but as soon as anything interrupts that regimen_ I start gaining again.  There is no stasis - I'm either dieting frantically or gaining.,Does anyone else see the irony in a breast cancer treatment that increases weight_ but increased weight is a risk factor for re-occurence?

Pain in feet and toes so that I couldn't do a beginners yoga class; took one class then quit due to pain of hands and feet.   Extreme fatigue so much that my get up and go got up and went. So I increased my exercise in an attempt to combat the fatigue and pain but to no avail.  Additionally_ with the hand pain came swelling of the fingers and additional tingling_ discomfort and trigger fingers of a couple of fingers on both hands.  I had trouble sleeping well (insomnia) due to inability to relax at night though feeling extremely tired.  What didn't I experience on this medication!,Went off it on my own for two months at the end of 2008 (Nov. and Dec.)to see if symptoms would improve (leave).  However_ I also increased my intake of Vit D3 from 800 to 1800 mg. daily at the same time.  So_ I'm not certain if it was going off the Arimidex or adding the additional Vit D that made for the improvement.   Symptoms of pain decreased and energy level and mood increased. This improvement wasn't noticable until at about 6 weeks of being off this medication.  Just had a visit with my oncologist (last week Jan 09) and told him about taking myself off the medication_ and that I put myself back on it on January 1_ 2009 to see what would happen being on the med and taking the increased Vit D at the same time.

I am seriously considering discontinuing the use of Arimidex unless I can find a cure for the joint pain (mostly because I am afraid the pain will not go away when I am done taking Arimidex in 5 years).  I have not had any problems with weight gain - probably because I do cardio-vascular exercises for 35 minutes almost every morning and really watch what I eat if I start to put on a couple of pounds.  Although the exercise also seems to help relieve the pain somewhat_ I am concerned that these arthritic-like symptoms won't go away after the Arimidex treatments are over.

After 5 months being on this_ I'm now experiencing similar pains on the left hand/arm/fingers (cramping_ trigger fingers).  I have frequent body/bone pains and aches (hips_ back_ trunk_ legs).

My cancer was simple and expertly treated.  I took arimidex faithfully for almost  two years_ experiencing nearly all of the side effects reported on this page.  After about 18 months_ I began to worry about the long-term risks vs. benefits.  My risk of recurrence is low_ so the risk reduction offered by arimidex doesnt amount to much.  Also_ since I am small and we all take the same 1 mg dose_ I was concerned that I was being overdosed.  I studied the scientific literature_ decided to quit_ waited for a normal mammogram_ and then discussed it with the oncologist before stopping.  The doctor made a case for staying on the drug but didnt push.  The one thing that was clear in the conversation was that it had to be my decision_ and Im sure that the doctor noted it as such in the record.  Today I feel great_ both physically and emotionally.  It was the right decision for me.  Thank you Sheryl Crow for inspiring m,F,64,22  months,12/26/2008,Arimidex

735, 1, Stage 1 breast cancer,In 2006-2007 I developed Stage 1 breast cancer in each breast at different times.  I had two lumpectomies and lymph nodes were good.  I started Arimidex in Dec 2007.  In August 2008 I began to have pain in my right hip followed by pain in my right shoulder.  By Oct of 2008 my knees were so stiff and hurt so bad I could hardly climb a small flight of stairs.  I was sleeping about 4 hours a night (and this was with a sleep aid)and had horrible sweats_ both day and night.  My carpel tunnel increased in pain and tenderness and I was always tired.  I stopped Arimidex 12 days ago and I can't believe the difference.  My knees do not hurt any more I have slept through the night_ although still with a sleeping pill.  My right hip still aches but not as bad.  I'm hoping no permanent damage was done to it. Had I realized all the above symtoms were caused by Armidex I would have stopped sooner. I see my oncologist next week and at that time I will tell her that I stopped Armidex and will not go ba,In my case_ Stage 1 breast cancer and no invasion into lymph nodes I will feel that stopping Armidex is right for me.

776, 3, Breast Cancer - Stage 3,Tiredness_ some minimal joint pain when exercising,I'm a new ARIMIDEX user_ after just having a hysterectomy and switching over from Tamoxifen mid summer.  I feel like going to bed every night at 8:00 which suits me just fine_ but doesn't make my husband too excited.  I push myself during the day and I do exercise vigorously most days_ which has normally benefited my overall energy level.  So hitting the wall before my kids are ready for bed is fairly concerning.  I really want to try and stay on it as long as possible since my mother passed away from BC and my sister was diagnosed last year.

Additionally_ insist on a DEXA scan to establish your bone mass BEFORE you begin Arimidex_ so you can document your bone loss.,If you are at low risk for recurrence_ carefully weigh the side effects vs. the benefits.  I was told I could gain a very small benefit from taking AIs_ but I was never told about the possibility of serious_ permanent hair loss or serious_ permanent bone loss.

I am going to go off of it for 2 months this time for more conclusive results.  I have spent thousand and thousands of dollars on weeekly physio_ massage therapy and active release therapy through my chiropractor (which works the best).  None are long term relief.

I have a hard time walking for any length of time due to pain so I'm not engaged in any routine exercise regimen.

Death from preventable cancer is not an acceptable alternative.,I have read many complaints on various blogs about joint and bone pain and sleeplessness in those who take Arimidex. For those suffering joint and bone pain from taking Arimidex_ I have some news. My doctor(s) recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements which have helped me greatly and will probably help you. It seems Arimidex may inhibit your ability to absorb Vitamin D and thus inhibits your bodys ability to absorb calcium(?) Anyway_ get your blood D levels tested and dont be surprised if they are low. Ask your doctor how much calcium and vitamin D are right for you. Also_ a moderate exercise program (swimming is great) will help with sleep and muscle pain. I have been taking a calcium supplement and about 200 percent of daily recommended D for about 3 weeks and I already notice a big difference. If you are taking an aromatase inhibitor_ it would be a bad idea to stop without talking to your doctor about the vitamin D/calcium connection first.,F,51,6  days,3/30/2008,Arimidex

844, 3, breast cancer,weight gain which I'm trying to combat and bone pain mainly in my ribs. And of course the dreaded hot flashes which started with the neo-adjunct chemo and have continued since,Just wanted to give everyone a big tip! I was also having alot of bone pain in my ribs and asked my radiation oncologist on a follow up visit about it since I wasn't sure if it was from arimedex or the radiation treatments and she encouraged me (once again) to take vitamin C_ D and E -2 grams each daily -  which seems to be 2000 mg each. This time I tried it and it was amazing! Bone pain was basically gone in a week! I take 1000 iu each of D and E in capsule form with breakfast and dinner and for the C I take EmergenC _which is a vitamin drink mix twice a day - great stuff.This makes sense to me since arimedex causes loss of vitamin D in your body and the supplement will help you compensate for that and help your body absorb the calcium you need for your bones.I guess the arimedex is helping - I like to think it is.

851, 1, Breast cancer_ stage 1A _1 node,Have not experienced any yet_ as I have been researching before taking this medicine. It sounds_ from your comments_  as if the debilitating effects of this medicine are irreversible. Took Tamoxifen for a year_ until the weight gain seemed to offset the benefits. If belly fat is a definite contributor to re-occurence_(because it is the best place for the body to store estrogen)_ then it would be logical that a medicine causing weight gain_ especially around the middle contributes to the problem.,I'm really torn about this issue. I understand that doctors prescribe medications that they believe really work_ and that they believe loss of life is a greater threat than loss of quality of life.  And I don't understand why they don't also stress the value of eating things that reduce estrogen in your body. Arimadex and similar drugs are aromatase inhibitors. If you search natural aromatase inhibitors_ you'll find that there are many foods that provide these naturally. I don't mean to sound like a total health food nut_ but I think that losing weight and eating healthy can do as much as a prescibed drug.

I'm 51 but feel more like 71.  My oncologist just shrugs when I bring it up and acts like I'm just looking for something to complain about.  Well_ he would too if his joints ached like mine do. For such a small pill_ it has BIG power.  I'm going to stop taking it for a while to see if I notice any improvement.  After reading a lot of these reviews_ I may even have to blame this medication for my frequent bouts of flu-like illnesses.

I took no narcotics in the hospital after a complete hysterectomy in May. I was sent home with 30 Darvocet and flushed 29. Besides the 1 Darvocet_ all I took at home post-op_ were two Ibuprophen and one Tylenol as needed. Last Wednesday the pain in my hands had rendered me to tears.

I'll be 5 years out April 1_ 2008. As for the osteopenia I get a Zometa infusion every 6 months because I'm unable to take Fosamax and Actonel.

Drug companies paint a pretty picture for marketing purposes.  I worked for one for 25 yrs.  and I am not impress with this drug at all.  Tamoxifen may be a better choice.  They 20 years of data on it and Arimidex is the new kid on the block.  7-8 yrs of data.  Not enough for me with the way I feel.  I did well getting through all of my chemo and radiation.  I have side effect still from the Taxol in my hands and feet.  I don't need more to deal with.  Do the oncologists know how many of us are going through this.  I wonder.  I am a very positive person so this has knocked me for a loop.  I do not wish to discourage others but I do wish to let them know my experience.

Around the 1 1/2 yr. mark_ I began having alot of soreness and minor joint pain in most of my joints.  What really bothered me was the neck and back pain I had every day.  I thought it was maybe my mattress.  Recently I discovered this site and the lady who added her rating on 1/19/2007 suggested taking omega 3.  I had heard of that_ so did a little internet research_ and then bought some omega 3.  I noticed the difference the next day.  Thank goodness for sites like these.,In case there is anyone out there that does not realize_ arimidex depletes your system of calcium_ that's why you need to replenish it with calcium_ plus Vitamin D.   I asked a pharmacist about how much calcium and D was safe to take without toxic effect.  I am now taking that max with my regular daily vitamin and omega 3_ and feel soooooo much better.

But if we ingest products containg soy which produces estrogen like hormones_ I would think the Tamoxifen would be the drug of choice.  I've been reading a lot of labels and I was very surprised to find the amount of products containing soy. I'm just wondering if a doctor has explained the difference to anyone. I would not want to have to switch to a different drug later on and endure another round.  If I can make the 5 year mark with Arimidex_ that will be a small miracle in itself.

I have gained about 25 lbs_ and am having a hard time losing it because I am so fatigued I eat to try and get energy. I was on tamoxifen from 9/2003 to about 10/2005 then I was switched to arimidex. I did not have symptoms at first_ until about a year into it.,F,52,20  months,5/11/2007,Arimidex

1030, 2, Breast Cancer Stage 1,Every bone and joint in my body ached after 10 months on the drug.  I could no longer do the sports and exercise - just walking down the stairs was a challenge. I had mood swings and my family found me nearly impossible to be around.  After becoming increasingly depressed and unable to concentrate_ I quit taking Armidex. After a month without Arimidex_ I can again downhill ski_ run_ jump and live.  My new oncologist agreed that the marginal benefit of Armidex over tamoxifen was not worth the decrease in quality of life for prevent of recurrence of invasive ductal carcinoma. This oncologist didn't oversell the benefits_ try to scare me but gave me important information for making a choice. For me_ the marginal benefits of Armidex versus tamoxifen are not worth the side effect and loss of quality of life.,I spoke with my pharacist who is hearing from many women about terrible side effects with Arimidex. Hopefully_ women who are having the level of side effects that I experienced will be able to access a good medical oncologist who will listen and provide guidance_ not a sales pitch for Arimidex. Again_ my breast cancer was caught early and the risk of it coming back is relatively small - each woman has to judge for herself the trade offs between quality of life now and possiblity of recurrence.  Even if one suffers through five years of more of taking Armidex_ one is not assured that one won't have a recurrence. An understanding oncologist can help you to make the right decision for you and your situation.  If your current oncologist isn't willing to listen and work with you_ you can fire him or her and find another one. That's what I did. Good luck.,F,64,10  months,5/4/2007Email,Arimidex

I feel so much better knowing that I am not alone here and am hoping that when I stop taking the drug the pain and stiffness will gradually go away. Here's hoping! I have felt that while taking the drug it was most definitely doing its job. I felt that my body was being stripped of any estrogen it had_ therefore creating an unfriendly place for any cancer to want to live. I had both my ovaries out over 2.5yrs ago as precautionary measure and have no libido_ but do feel that the situation was made worse by the Arimidex.

After about 6 months the pain settled in my feet and ankles. October of '06 started having severe pain in my right knee with some swelling.  Pain in my feet and ankles_ together with the pain in my knee_ became so unbearable that I decided to stop taking Arimidex in November of '06.  After 4 months_ pain is worsening.  I've been told by an Orthopedic Surgeon that I most likely have a torn meniscus and will need surgery.  I can't get any doctor to address the issue of the pain in my ankles.  I thought that within a few months of not taking Arimidex my pain would at least begin to lessen_ but it has actually gotten so much worse that it is very hard for me to stand and walk.

He acknowledged the joint pain side effect (although no one before_ during_ and after my diagnosis_ surgery_ and radiation treatment ever told me about any side effects_ and the joint pain was the only one he acknowledged after I complained about it) and told me I could stop taking the Arimidex if the pain was too bad.  Not wanting the cancer to come back_ I decided to continue taking it since the pain was still bearable at that time.  My last check up was with another surgeon_ who said he had never heard of Arimidex causing joint pain (I need to refer him to this board).  He_ of course_ had no explanation for my knee_ feet_ and ankle pain.  I told him I had stopped taking the Arimidex_ and he was okay with that.

I have had night sweats and hot flushes.,I do not want to take this drug any more_ I want quality not quantity.My oncologist told me that I have an eighty-five percent chance of being alive at the end of ten years.  If I take the Arimidex that increases to a ninety percent chance.  If I switch to Tamoxifen it is an eighty-nine percent chance.

He explained that the side effects of Arimidex are the same as what happens when you go through menopause. During the big M_ your estrogen is depleted. The same thing occurs with Arimidex; it supresses your estrogen to inhibit cancer growth. As a result_ you get these effects. Needless to say_ I will remain on Arimidex for the full five years. Some of the side effects have abated somewhat_ but this is because I am taking water aerobics 2X a week. (I highly recommend this form of exercise -- less stress on muscles and weight bearing for bones.)In warmer weather_ I walk outdoors. It helps.

AstroZenica stated that they could not tell me if the hair and eyelash loss would be permanent or not.,I called AstroZenica and they were less than forthcoming about these side effects_ which were not fully disclosed in their literature or I never would have taken this drug.  I called the manufacturers of Femara_ who were much more cooperative in giving me statistics on these side effects.  3% of women in 2 clinical trials_ for a total of 600 women_ experienced these side effects on Femara.

Lately_ I have been gaining weight and I am trying to get more active in spite of the fatigue_ but I feel like someone is blowing me up with an air hose! My memory definitely is not what it was.

I can't enjoy a good stretch without excruciating pain in my upper arms. I was a very young looking and fit 56 year old when I started on Arimidex nearly a year ago.  Now I feel my quality of life is destoyed and I've aged considerably.  My memory is still wobbly but improved when I started taking extra thyroxin to counter an under active thyroid gland_ possibly caused by radiotherapy.

1109, 5, Stage 1 DCIS_ radiation_ no chemo,The drug was aging me prematurely -- vision problems_ aching joints and muscles_ exhaustion_ inablility to fall asleep_ could barely get out of a chair with painful hips and lower back.  When I developed trigger finger in my thumbs_ I went off the drug_ but already had severe nerve damage and carpal tunnel by then.  I'm trying to buy time to avoid surgery.  (See my additional reply at rating 2.),Stay on this drug if you don't experience accumulating pain and sided effects. Contact me if you developed carpal tunnel or trigger finger.  I want to know how long your symptoms remained and how your doctor revised your treatment.,F,59,3  months,1/7/2007Email,Arimidex
1110, 3, Stage 1 breast cancer,Increasing and significant stiffness in hands_ legs and feet. Initially_ more hot flashes and strong hip pain at night--hip still vulnerable.  Feet achy_ soles tender and often painful.  If keyboarding a lot_ hands become stiff and curl up at night (beginning carpal tunnel). Some weight gain. Maybe 10 facial whiskers.,"I've become quite stiff_ move like an arthritic old woman when getting up from a spell of sitting.  Gets better as movement increases.  This and feet problems (often aching_ esp. soles) are the worst side effects for me. Word-finding and short-term memory weaker_ and some neuropathy in foot_ tho all this may be from chemo. Hot flashes seemed to coincide with carb/sugar intake. Ingestion of a lot of acidic foods (coffee_ tomatoes_ citrus_ etc.) seems to worsen joint problems. Carlson cod liver oil (no fish taste!) seems to help some. Perhaps we need a column devoted to ""What helps"".  Diagnosed bone thinning may/may not be related. Something to be aware of_ seven studies now have shown electromagnetic fields (EMFs) can render Tamoxifen ineffective (see microwavenews.com).  No such studies done on Arimidex_ which uses a different mechanism. Exposure to EMF's may be another thing we need to watch. Jury still out on Arimidex's effectiveness for me.",F,56,16  months,1/7/2007Email,Arimidex

When I developed trigger finger in both thumbs I went off the drug.  Now I have severe nerve damage and carpal tunnel that I am hoping will get better. After 6 weeks off the drug I am fine except for wrists & thumbs.,Please contact me if you developed carpal tunnel and/or trigger finger while taking arimidex.  I want to know how long your symptoms lasted and how your doctor revised your treatment.  I am postponing surgery as long as possible.

Walking is uncomfortable_ moreso going upstairs. I still manage to walk a mile or so each day and weight train 3 days a week.  I am osteiopenic and taking 1500 m of calcium plus D. Did not attribute arthritic pain to Arimidex until I found this site.,As the pain increased over the years_ I kept feeling that I was doing something to poison my body.  I have given up regular coffee_ then even decaf coffee_ switched to tea_ then to green tea_ I eat anti-nflammatory foods_ especially blueberries and strawberries. I started taking a number of vitamins_ but don't see any improvement_ although my nails are stronger.  Recently_ I have begun to think about my discomfort every waking moment.

I was nearing a boiling point.  On the day when I had 14 hot flashes during a yoga class_ I cam across this site.  I immediately identified with almost every symptom - vaginal dryness and low libido_ joint aches_ dry throat_ concentration and memory problems_ low motivation_ hot flashes upon hot flashes.

1117, 3, Stage III Breast Cancer,I have been taking Arimidex since November 2005. For the first year I experianced really bad leg muscle pain. It was difficult to go up and down steps or get up out of bed or a chair. Now I have joint pain_ stiffness and pain in my shoulders. The stiffness in my legs gets better if I can walk for awhile. This is not always possible. I live in a very rough and rocky area that is steep. I also sweat very badly and get very hot when walking. I also have hot flashes that have gotten fewer and milder.I don't realy know if the Arimidex is helping and probably won't for about 4 more years. I am just trusting my doctors to know what is best. They did tell me that if I have inherited the gene that it really doesn't matter about the medications. The cancer could come back at any time even if you take the meds_ where if you don't have the gene_ the odds are very good to be cancer free at least while on the Arimidex.,,F,52,1  years,12/22/2006,Arimidex

Used to be fine with 7 hours sleep a night or even 6 1/2 - but now want at least 8 and often happier with a bit more.

Bone density is very good-about that of a 25 year old female_ but gynecologist told me to stop taking Ca supplements as any injury might result in bone shattering. Foot tenderness on soles of feet. Lower back pain and some knee joint pain in left leg only. Lower GI problems-either diarrhea or constipation. Appetite is dimished but no weight l,"Don't know what life will be like following arimidex-which I will have the chance of quitting in April_2007. Don't want to go on indefinitely taking medication but the thought is scarey to be without a ""crutch"" to rely on.After getting my breast cancer I was forced to make the decision to leave my position as an Academician at the University where I live_ and having done so I have never looked back. It is another life not working but being retired doesn't mean not doing anything. I feel my quality of life is far better with arimidex than the other medicine. Still experiencing mood changes and mild depression. Unfortunately have had several panic attacks and I didn't read anything on anyone's review - has anyone had any panic attacks? Thought the depression was me until I read your web site. Unfortunately_ most doctors do not tell you that you will feel that way.

I take Celebrex 200 mg daily to manage the pain.,I was on Tamoxifen for one year before switching to Arimidex. Now on Arimidex for almost two years. I feel it is a safer drug overall (at least on the short term) and has been shown to reduce risk of recurrence compared to Tamox.

I take effexor to control the flashes_ but it doesn't get rid of them completely and I'm taking 75 mg (up from 37.5 which hardly helped at all.)  Joint pain in my wrists_ fingers and feet.  I have had 3 surgeries on my feet and trigger fingers in almost all my fingers and both thumbs of my hands (surgeries for that also).  My hair is thin and my skin is very dry and my nails on my hands especially are so soft and rip all the time.  Any suggestions_ comments on all this?  Thanks!,I am willing to take arimidex if it means there will be no recurrence of BC_ but would like input on what to do about the side effects.

I continue an active exercise program (fast walking_ gym_ yoga) despite the fatigue and find it helps with the stiffness_ especially the yoga. Obviously_ we can ́t know at an individual level how effective this drug is_ but given the high probability of recurrence in my case_ I feel the side effects are tolerable for the possible benefits.

Lucky me_ I then get stage 1 breast cancer to add to my list.  I had surgery in June (partial mastectomy/lumpectomy by an excellent surgeon) and 3 lymph nodes removed (no cancer spread).  Then came the 30 daily radiation treatments_ what a summer!  In August_ I was put on arimidex and seemed ok until about 2 weeks ago.  Since I already experience vaginal dryness from Sjogren's_ Arimidex has been a terrible drug for me.  It has exacerbated the problem to where it is difficult to sit.  I have stiffness in my low back upon arising and more pain in my knees than I had before.  Back came the hot flashes!  I don't know what to do or who to turn to for help.  I hear that tamoxifin can cause blood clots and since grandma died of a stroke_ I'm not really hot about that choice either.

Is this something that seems to help the joint problems so many are reporting? I'd really like to hear from people who DON'T have joint problems and try to figure out why_ in case it would be helpful.

I was told you have to take Megastrol (10 mg. a day) along with the Arimidex. The Megastrol did help with the Hot Flashes & Night Sweats. Just had a Bone Scan a month ago and have severe Osteoperoisis. Again in all fairness I also have Degenerative Disk Diease_ and EDS (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.  I am suppose to be on these two drugs for 5 yrs. My Lobular Cancer had spread to the lymph nodess_ and almost penetrated the chest wall. In some of the research I have seen if the cancer comes back it is usually after 5 yrs. So how is a person suppose to rate these drugs. And my cancer was hormone receptor positive. So I guess the Arimidex does stop all the production of hormones so guess it is doing it's job.

I feel like I'm 90 years old sometimes.I can't find any info that gives details about the joint pain--only that osteoporosis is a side effect. Also read that you shouldn't take calciium and arimidex within two hours of each other becz the calcium interferes with the effect of the arimidex.I feel it's hard to rate this drug because my satisfaction depends on whether it prevents the cancer from returning.
