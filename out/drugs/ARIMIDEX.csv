0, 5, Breast Cancer stage 3,Joints ache_ high cholesterol_ osteopenia_ hot flashes  in the beginning.,I posted about 3 years ago and stated exercise has really helped to lower cholesterol and with joint pain.  I do need to add that my 5 years was over in May but new studies have shown that 10 years on Arimidex really is better than 5 years.  My oncologist suggested I keep taking the Arimidex   After a double mastectomy_ chemo_ and radiation_ I can deal with this if it will prevent my cancer from returning.  The only reason I rated this a 5 is I believe it has kept my cancer from returning.,F,59,5  years1 MG 1X D,8/15/2016,Arimidex

I'm very small (98 lbs) so asked the oncologist if she could adjust my dosage. Can't understand how ""1 size fits all"" works with something as toxic as this pill! All take the same dosage but my body can't handle this much. I went off the pill 3 days last week_ and within 1 day my pain began to lessen_ I could run errands and had energy so I know it's this pill! Of course I went back on it after 3 days but decided I'm only taking it every other day until I see my oncologist next month. I don't know if I can handle 5 years if I feel this badly after only 9 months on it? I feel like I've aged 10 years already!",F,64,9  months1 mg 1X D,7/25/2016EmailHistory,Arimidex
8, 5, Stage 2A invasive lobular carcinoma,none,I saw the post from 7/7/2016 and see that we are both starting the journey together.  I started on 7/4/2016.  I'm posting and hope to do updates at the 6 month and 1 year marks.  So far_ so good.  No side effects.  I found this website when I was searching for links asking the question as to how soon will I feel side effects.  I might end up being the lucky one or else it will hit me like a train!  I am presently taking a multi-vitamin that my radiologist said was very good.  Taking extra D-3 as a friend of mine who also had breast cancer took it and came back with excellent bone scans.  I had an Oncotype score of 10 and with no family history of cancer_ being in good physical condition_ I did radiation treatment only and it was recommended that I take Arimidex for 5 years.  It was pretty much determined that taking HRTs may have triggered my cancer_ so no more of that!,F,65,2  weeks1 mg 1X D,7/16/2016Email,Arimidex

It seems like every week I have a different side effect. If is frustrating and think if this is worth taking.,I went thru Chemo and radiation. This is worse then going thru chemo and radiation.

Get about five hours of that.  She told me to stay on it giving me no alternatives.  Quite an unsympathetic oncologist.,I would love to stop this medication.  I'm on the generic brand.  Are they both the same in regards to joint pain and weight gain?   She told me if she had a relative on this that she'd tell her to stay on it.  My five years end September of 2017.

I had been taking this medication as my surgeon and oncologist suggested me to take this to reduce my risk even further of re-occurrence of BC. Though my oncotype score came back low and they had said that with surgery and radiation my chance of my cancer coming back was less than 5-10%. Been dealing with severe joint pain and  arthritis in right shoulder near the clavical and I had a feeling it was from this medicine since I have been on it for 6 mos. The oncologist advised me to take a two week break from the arimidex which I just did while on vacation_ and I felt normal again!! She has now put me on Letrozole 2.5mg to try and if it gives me less side effects than the arimidex . If not_she will try Tamoxifin.. I will give this new medicine  a month then see what happens. Begining to think that I might just want to live with the 5-10% risk of the cancer coming back then to deal with these awful side effects.
