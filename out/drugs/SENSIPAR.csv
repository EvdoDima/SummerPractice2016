0, 5, ESRF,Lowered PTH levels from 1400 to 300_ no noticeable side effects. Works very well if taken religiously at largest meal of day. Will only work if you take phosphorus binders with anything you ingest. Should be monitored more than 1X monthly_ always scared of doing harm to thyroid if change in eating habits.,,M,43,7  years120 MG,11/24/2011Email,Sensipar
