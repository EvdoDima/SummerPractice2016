0, 3, Contraceptive_ Acne,Cleared up most acne_ barely had a period_ rarely had cramps_ sometimes (randomly) swollen but never tender breasts_ spotting and skipped periods. Unfortunately killed my sex drive_ had pretty severe moodiness/depression_ and low energy.,,F,20,1  years,1/14/2016Email,Loestrin 21 1/20
1, 2, Heavy periods,Since starting this pill I have been very lethargic_ feeling very low & having constant break outs of spots. Large ones at that. I have a few more days until my pack finishes & have decided not to continue after my break. This pill also leaves me feeling really dizzy & sometimes nauseous. Not for me.,,F,41,2  weeks,10/20/2014Email,Loestrin 21 1/20
2, 1, control cramps_ lighten flow,Doc prescribed because I was having heavy flow & severe cramping.  Told me it would lighten both.  Unfortunately it has gotten somewhat worse.  My period now lasts on & off for 3 out of 4 wks in a month.  The cramps aren't as severe but are more frequent since my cycle never seems to end.  I'd rather deal w/the once a month visit than the awful 21+ days of misery.  So I'll be stopping this BC after this pack is finished.  Also have breast tenderness_ major mood swings / emotional outbursts that I never had before.  Not to mention lack of sex drive.,,F,38,2  months,3/19/2012Email,Loestrin 21 1/20

Before I started taking Junel (the generic of Loestrin) I would only have a couple pimples on my chin right before starting my period. After taking Junel_ I have widespread acne. I've also found that I have little to no sex drive. I'm hoping that the next BC I try (Desogen/Apri) will affect me positively.,F,26,6  months 1X D,1/18/2012,Loestrin 21 1/20

Im not a huge fan of loestrin 21_ but its not the worst ive had.  For three months now i havent had my period_ normally id be happy_ but i fear im pregnant everytime it doesnt come.  Kind of a blessing and a curse.  My mood swings are crazy the week before my placebo pills and i have absolutly no sex drive.  My eating habits have gone haywire.  No appetite until the week before my ""period"" when i eat everything in sight.  Im already prone to yeast infections_ but taking loestrin has just made it worse.

However_ nausea has improved.,I'd been feeling nauseous and emotional every day for a year so I thought I'd swap from Microgynon 30 to a new pill - the nurse recommended Loestrin 20. So far_ i'm not happy! I've got spots_ feel like i'm gaining weight and my period is very irregular. I have to keep worrying about pregnancy because my period isn't coming at the right time. It's very unsettling. I'm off to university next month and I don't want horrific spots or to be fat as well as worrying about being pregnant when my period doesn't come!!,F,19,21  days20mg 1X D,9/13/2011Email,Loestrin 21 1/20

9, 5, Severe Dysmorphea and long periods,breasts are tender_ extremely light 3 day periods. Mild cramping and some mood swings.,I actually love this pill. I've had TERRIBLE experiences with birth control PILLS. I used to take the depo shot for many years so I wouldn't have a period because my periods are heavy_ they last up to 7 days (my shortest periods lasted 5 days. I've tried Loestrin 24Fe and I forget the name of the other one and they both made me break out with an ugly rash all over my face and chest. This pill hasn't given me any major problems. My first pack I didn't get my period at all. After the pack second I got my period and it was so light all I could wear were panty liners and it only lasted 3 days. This is a miracle for me. I love this pill because it does exactly what I NEED it to do!!!!!!,F,29,3  months 1X D,8/31/2011Email,Loestrin 21 1/20

15, 3, To prevent pregnancy,Breast Tenderness_ spotting,I have been taking Loestrin 21 for at least 3 month now and I have had spotting in between for some time. If you attempt to skip straight to the next active pill so you may not have a period_ you may be disappointed. I would spot anyway. And this month_ I was at least 5 days early. I hope it wont last for more than few days because I have not even finished the active hormone pill course. :(,F,26,4  months 1X D,7/15/2010,Loestrin 21 1/20
16, 2, ,mood swings_ no period,I ran out of LoEstrin and didn't make it to the pharmacy for about one week_ even though the 'down' days are less than that - at that point I noticed that despite being MORE tired than I when was on Loestrin (due to late nights for work)_ I was less moody_ more patient_ and generally happier.  Also - I've lost weight (about 5 lbs) doing nothing special since going off of LoEstrin.  The 'no period' was nice_ but I'm going back to Orthocyclin.,,37,90  days 1X D,6/25/2010,Loestrin 21 1/20

So far I like it. I haven't had any problems with gaining weight or bloating. No loss of libido.  I am kind of excited to start my period (well as excited as one can be about something like that) since a lot of people say it's very short and somewhat pain free.

19, 4, bad cramps_ depression,reduced cramps_ lighter period_ more stable emotions,I have horrible cramps that usually have me throwing up and unable to do anything for two days straight (including missing work). I've tried other birth control methods before and they actually made my cramps worse_ so I gave up a couple years ago. Last year_ though_ I was having very irregular periods and horrible mood swings/depression_ so I decided to give it another try. The first time I filled the prescription_ they gave me the generic (microgestin?)_ and it was as bad as the others I'd tried. I told them to actually give me Loestrin the next time I got the prescription filled_ and I've been happy since. My cramps aren't completely gone_ but they're significantly reduced and I can go to work. My periods are a lot lighter and very regular_ and I haven't had any spotting. Also_ my emotions have been much more stable. I've gained weight_ but I think that's more due to the fact that I'm eating less healthy and barely working out anymore_ so I can't say that it's from the Loestrin.,F,23,9  months20 1X D,3/13/2010,Loestrin 21 1/20

21, 5, irregular cycle,The only side effects I've noticed_ are horrible indigestion and maybe slight nausea. These only seem to happen though when I don't eat enough before/after taking my pill;so it's totally fixable. (I hope!) Besides those 2_ I can't complain about this pill at all. It's seemed to improve my moods a little and my periods have so far been totally fine_except more painful than usual.,,F,17,  1X D,2/13/2010,Loestrin 21 1/20

23, 5, good effects,No negative side effetcs_ all positive and ive lost weight!,First off i would like to tell you my history with two other BC_ First birth control i ever took was Yaz/Yasmin= mood swings_ weight gain especially in breast. After taking that for a year i switched to the nuva ring_ and i had no negative side effects except for low sex drive and dryness and was using that method for about 2 years. I recently have started taking Loestrin and let me tell you what i todl the doctor_ i had told her how the nuva ring made me dry down there and not able to have a sex drive. and my doctor said i should try loestrin since it is suppose to have less symptoms than the rest_ although it really depends on how your body chemicals react to loestrin's chemicals. So far_ i havent had any bad side effects and ive only been on this method for 7 days_ some good things is that i have lower appeotite and ive actually lost 2 1/2 pounds. i havent had any negative side effects so im super happy. I wonder if anyone else is in this position =) Also im curious is people who have had taken yaz/yasmin and experienced bad side effects like i did and if they switched to loestrin and notice no bad side effects. That would be interesting for all of us to know. I hope this helps!!,F,20,7  days,11/30/2009,Loestrin 21 1/20
24, 5, Depression/mood swings: perimenopau,Mild breakouts. More like red bumps than 'pimples'. Weight gain_ but to be fair_ I made the mistake of not watching my food intake. So if you go on it_ DON'T OVEREAT!,It TOTALLY changed my mood balance within 2-3 weeks. I had been very sad and moody for 8 months (age 46). I now have very mild PMS_ like I used to.

I was scared to try this_ but my cramps were so bad (apparently due to endometriosis) that I had to try something.  The generic pills made my boobs hurt constantly...they were big_ yes_ but SO painful!  I switched to brand name and have had NO problems whatsoever.
