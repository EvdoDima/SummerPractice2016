1, 1, enlarged prostate,proscar stinks. it didn't have any benefit for me. Any doctor who prescribes this drug is a quack. I read all the reports about this stupid drug and felt it would help improve my urination frequency so I could avoid any prostate surgery. But I continued to retain urine and my condition became worst. during the nine months I took this medication I became sick with vomiting I lost weight and my blood pressure went through the roof due to my urine buildup the damaged my kidneys and I nearly died of renal failure. I had to be put on dialysis to save my life. the company that manufactures this drug should be shut down by the FDA for marketing this medication. I know have to go three times a week for dialysis sitting in a chair for 4 hours with two 14 gauge needles stuck in my arm to stay alive due to PROSCAR. Thank you very much,,M,58,9  months30mg 1X D,4/22/2015Email,Proscar
2, 2, To reduce my prostate,I noticed that I was losing less hair although that Isn't why I was taking it.  I started having a problem maintaining an erection for long enough to ejaculate.,I've stopped taking this drug because of the problems I was having with erections.  I would need to really work hard to keep an erection until I could ejaculate.  I've had a TURP so I do not ejaculate outside my body but I still want to get the feeling of ejaculation even though there is no sperm.,M,75,8  months5 mg 1X D,2/6/2014Email,Proscar
3, 3, BPH,This drug grows hair in all the wrong places - namely your rectal area,,M,62,4  months5mg 1X D,12/9/2011Email,Proscar
4, 5, Hair Loss,Acne cleared up; I never get pimples anymore. My skin glows with health; I've unexpectedly had people tell me that I look young (probably because it softened and nourished my skin).,My first comment is for those men with BPH. 1. This drug is probably effective for it_ because BPH is caused by the hormone DHT (which this drug lowers). But the #1 cure for prostate enlargement is cutting down on sexual activity. Sex and ejaculation cause surges in DHT_ including around the prostate and this is what causes the enlargement. Most men past mid-life are having sexual activity too often. Cut down on sex and masturbation_ and your prostate will shrink fast.2. As for hair loss_ I'd say this drug is working for me. It seems thicker than before and I don't get many hairs falling out anymore. ,M,32,7  months5 MG 1X D,5/26/2011Email,Proscar
5, 2, Prostate enlargement,Significant breast growth -painful & strange ejaculations,It did shrink the prostate gland a lot_ but I'm going to stop it for a while _ before I need a D CUP BRA .,M,82,4  years5 1X D,8/8/2010Email,Proscar
6, 2, BPH,Am divorced_ so the side effects didn't really matter until I found an awesome partner. Then I experienced the inability to maintain an erection and have an orgasm during intercourse_ even while trying to masterbate.  Big effect on new partner's confidence in trying to please me. Didn't realize it could be Proscar that was causing this.,Worked great to increase urinary flow but having been off it for two weeks I already experienced a solid and prolonged erection and orgasm during intercourse.  So what is the trade off????,M,48,4  years5 1X D,3/20/2010,Proscar
7, 4, Hair Loss mainly,None that I am aware of. Sex drive and early morning erections still strong. Hair loss was stopped and seems a lot more hair on the previous almost bald patches,I have not been very regular-sometimes stopping for a month or more. Also use Regain lotion_ so am not entirely sure which of the two medicines helps most. I was told a combination is always good.,M,56,4  years,11/23/2009,Proscar
8, 4, enlarged prostate,I just completed 6 months on this and am satisfied with the fact that I have not wet my pants in a while. I'm a heavy coffee drinker and many times could not hold it unbtil i got to the bathroom.,I have no side effects and the doctor told me that the saw palmetto I was taking only has a very minor effect on reducing the prostate and that most of is hype.,M,66,6  months,7/8/2009,Proscar
9, 4, Gender transition (transsexual),"Most of what has already been posted here_ but many of the ""side effects"" were the effects I was seeking.",Consider this if you are NOT a transsexual.Recently_ a number of clinical trials have confirmed the effectiveness of saw palmetto in treating BPH. Many of these trials have shown saw palmetto works better than the most commonly used prescription drug_ Proscar. Saw palmetto is effective in nearly 90% of patients after six weeks of use_ while Proscar is effective in less than 50% of patients. In addition_ Proscar may take up to six months to achieve its full effect. Since Proscar blocks the production of testosterone_ it can cause impotence and breast enlargement. Also_ saw palmetto is significantly less expensive than Proscar. A one month supply of saw palmetto costs $1225_ while a one month supply of Proscar costs $6575,F,42,4  years,7/5/2009,Proscar
10, 4, Chronic Prostatitus,Have had some breast enlargement and some reduction in sperm volume. However the Prostatitus has been essentially contained.,In addition_ my Doctor believes Proscar is a Cancer Preventive medication in that a smaller Prostate provides a better environment for limiting Cancer Risk; and quotes research confirming potentially lower Cancer Risk of 25% with Proscar users compared to Non Users.,M,69,2  years,5/20/2009,Proscar
11, 1, BPH,No Sperm_ unable to maintain or achieve erection.,I was put on this med in nov/08 and I stopped it in the middle of feb/09. It was mind boggling that I could not have normal or near normal sexual relations with my wife. I started taking two 1000mg pumpkin seed oil capsules for the first month then cut down to one cap a day. The results are as follows: increased sex drive_ every night erections_ having sex every day wife off from work (4 days in a row) The only other med I take is flomax to keep the flowing going. I get up once a night.I drink Cranberry/pomergranate 100% juice only. This could help with ed and urinary problems also.Daily exercise_ low fat diet_no alcohol_no smoking_This really works! try it...it is better than taking this poison drug.,M,66,3  months,4/27/2009,Proscar
12, 1, baldness,anxiety attacks_ loss of libido_ changes in penis shape_ smaller testicles_ dehydration_ sleep disturbance.,Used as a 'cost effective' means of hair loss treatment instead of buying propecia_ took this stuff for years without realising the side effects are far more varied and intense than you are told. The '2%' who experience impotence only for it to supposedly go away is rated at 19% in another medical study and could be higher_ not to mention that side effects could be long term. I've been off the stuff for a month with no recovery_ indeed things intensified after a while_ and am very worried. Stay well clear. But hey the hair does stop falling out.,M,34,6  years,1/29/2009,Proscar
13, 1, hair loss,premature ejaculation,This drug ruined my life. My sex life is a joke now.,M,23,1  years,9/14/2008,Proscar
14, 2, BPH,I did not relate the symtoms to the medication_ as the doctor said there were no major side affects. However the following started within 3 weeks of starting the medication and got worse with time:  Sore & aching muscles_ starting from the neck down the back and on the sides of chest_ then lowering blood pressure to danger levels with occasional heart pulpitations. Occational blured vision  and cold like symtoms. The symtoms disapeared 2 to 3 weeks after stopping the medication.,Not sure if there are any other people that have symtoms like mine or if the drug manufacturer has recorded such symtoms.,M,67,3  months,12/30/2007,Proscar

16, 3, BPH,None,IMPORTANT NOTE_ GUYS!!!  Proscar cuts your PSA in half WITHOUT ACTUALLY DECREASING YOUR PROSTATE CANCER RISK!!  In other words_ if you take Proscar your doctor should multiply your PSA by a factor of 2 if he wants to compare it to standard tables.PLEASE DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS ISSUE_ BECAUSE IF YOU GET PROSTATE CANCER YOU RUN THE RISK OF CATCHING IT TOO LATE.,M,48,1  years,10/26/2007,Proscar
17, 5, hair loss,decreased ejaculate volume_ not a big deal to me at my age.,I took it for hair loss_ before Propecia was around.  It stopped my getting up at night and completely filled in my top of head hair loss.  I haven't had any other problems with it_ and now am afraid to stop.  I said 7 years_ but I've used it since it was available_ so it was probably longer.  I am an MD.  The extra benefit was I was getting up at night at least once for urination_ and now I don't get up at all.,M,62,7  years,9/22/2007,Proscar
18, 5, Hair loss and premature BPH,none,GREAT medicine with fantastic outcomes in clinical trials for reducing BPH and prostate cancer.  Why try anything that has no clinical data just because your doc likes the drug rep???,M,39,6  years,6/10/2007,Proscar

20, 1, prostrate,Has anyone else been told PSA score is being reflected at only 50% of what it actually is?,YES PROSCAR REGISTERS PSA RATE by LESS THAN 50% OF ACTUAL SCORE!  _ last week dr. told my husband he has cancer of prostrate...he thought for years on this drug his PSA was fine...and so did his uninformed hot shot urologist.  It is reprehensible that a specialist would not know this about a drug.,M,70, ,4/13/2007Email,Proscar
21, 5, Hair Loss,only a SLIGHT decrease in sexual drive.,I've recovered at least 80% of my lost hair and I couldn't recommend this better alongside good hair product (like Nioxin) - I agree with the previous comment - certainly get your GP's opinion and good advice as we're all individual butI give two thumbs up for Proscar/Finasteride.,M,32,2  years,8/18/2006Email,Proscar
22, 3, bleeding after ejaculation,Also taking Uroxatral 1x per day.  Having intermittant pains in left and right lower abdomen. Noticably reduced libido_ and ejaculation output volume.,,M,49,30  days,6/22/2006,Proscar
23, 3, Hair Loss,Lower sex drive_ shrinking genitals.,Not totally sure if my other health problems are connected - I had rotator cuff surgery two years ago and having same problems again. I have pain and stiffness in my joints. I just feel like an old man now. I have excercised 3-4 days a week for the past 10 years and take good care of my body. I've been taking the drug for 5 years. I'm getting off the drug! Maybe have to get a hair transplant in a year or two when my hair has fallen out but I don't think the side effects are worth it!,M,37,5  years,4/24/2006,Proscar
24, 1, husband is using for balding,He has breast enlargement_ genital shrinking_ body hair loss_ and less of everything.  He is insistent on continuing.  I would prefer him bald.  Don't get too bent out of shape guys_ but the vanity involved cancels out the few strands of hair in my books.  I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case for your wives_ too. My husband also thinks he's warding off prostate problems_ even though he has no problem now. For prostate cancer_ use it_ that's a whole different thing.  I'm in the medical field_ so just have to say_ work with your doctor_ not some pharmacy outside the country with some doctor willing to prescribe to you sight unseen.  He doesn't have to face the music if you have a problem in the future from taking this.,,F,52,5  years,3/19/2006,Proscar
25, 3, BPH w. elevated PSA,loss of libido_ but this got somewhat better over time. Perhaps also some joint pain_ but not certain if this is from Proscar.,I just read that Proscar sometimes causes osteoporosis and intend to ask my doctor if this is something I should take calcium or something else for_ if true. After three months_ it's too early to determine the effect on PSA.,M,59,3  months,7/13/2005Email,Proscar

28, 4, For Hairloss,The side effects were slight tenderness in the chest nipple area. I am told its due to possible gyno effects of the increased estrogen levels experienced on this drug. I took 1/4 Arimidex to counter this every other day. That mops up the excess estrogen but not too much as it can lead to problems of osteoporosis. The other side effect was it made my hairloss stop. Have experienced some hair regrowth but not huge amounts.,Bought my meds without prescription from http://www.offshore-pharma.comI have nothing to do with these guys but am posting the link here cos they are reliable and their prices are good. They do a whole range of hairloss drugs aswell. The fact they do the orders without prescription saves the hassle of getting meds for hairloss from your doctor. My doctor laughed at me and told me to get over the hairloss cos there was nothing you can do about it. Shows how much your average GP knows about the advances in modern  science !!,M,28,4  years,1/21/2005,Proscar

31, 3, BPH,I am also taking Flowmax so there may be some side effects due to it.  Initially_ I took 1 tablet per day and experienced much reduced sex drive and some enlargement of breasts.  After reviewing with my doctor_ dosage was reduced to one-quarter of a tablet 3 times per week.  The breast enlargement has been alleviated quite a bit but the sex drive hasn't been helped much so far.  The jury is still out.,I am not sure if taking Proscar reduces the value of a PSA reading in checking for prostate cancer.  Does anyone know?,M,73,1.5  years,11/22/2004Email,Proscar
