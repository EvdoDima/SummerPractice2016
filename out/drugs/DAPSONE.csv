1, 5, Dermatitis Herpetiformus,Initially my white blood count was low off and on.Upon taking it for the first time my -entire- body_ which was completely plagued with sores_ was completely free of the DH in slightly over 2 weeks.,I was told to take it as needed for DH due to celiac. For some people with DH it cures the issue after some time_ however_ I can only go about 2 days without it after taking it for over a week. Upon the 2 days of missing it I find a few sores on my elbows_ knees and_ occasionally_ scalp; I can feel the pain recede after taking it when I've gone too long without it. Unfortunately_ I will be a life-time dependent on Dapsone.,F,20,2  years100 1X D,7/20/2012Email,Dapsone
