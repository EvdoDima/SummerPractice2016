0, 1, Systemic Fungal Infection,Debilitating fatigue_ diarrhea 1 hour after taking drug. Severe nausea_ edema_ fatigue_ and muscle aches the next day.,Now I know why it's known for damaging your liver - I've never felt so toxic after taking a drug! I was actually prescribed 100 mg but was cautious_ so I cut the pill in half - thank goodness. I realize my condition makes me more susceptible to herxing (die off)_ but this is not worth the risk. I will go back to antifungals that are natural or that don't go outside of the digestive track.,F,32,1  days50 mg,2/21/2016Email,Fluconazole
