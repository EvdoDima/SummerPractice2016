0, 5, male pattern baldness,Acne cleared up; I never get pimples anymore. My skin glows with health; I unexpectedly had people tell me how young I look (maybe because my skin is softer and healthier). Girls seem to pay more attention to me (maybe it's the extra confidence I've had lately_ with my thickened hair_ but can't say for sure). I know that these are good things_ and they're the only side effects I've had.,This is a really good drug. I take this drug for hair loss_ and I take FIVE times the standard amount that most guys take_ and I'm glad that I do. My hair certainly seems thicker: My friends tell me that I have more hair now than I did in pictures from several years ago. It's healthier too_ not oily. This drug lowers the hormone DHT_ and it is this hormone which causes hair loss. This hormone also causes pimples and oily skin; that's why my acne cleared up upon using this drug. It's also safe_ having been through extensive study_ more so than most other drugs on the market.,M,32,7  months5 mg 1X D,5/26/2011Email,Finasteride
