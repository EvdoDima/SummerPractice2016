It has been very helpful in helping me endure these 7 days.  I have never had a medication affect me with so many unpleasant side effects.  I hope the bacteria has been eradicated because I do not want to ever use this medication again. I drank plenty of water and made sure I had enough food before taking every set of these daily 12 pills_ but still experienced so many rather nasty side effects.  Thought I would have to go to ER many times. Doctor prescribed anxiety medication to help me endure.  Could not work because of the intensity of the side effects_ too dizzy and off balanced to drive. Many of these side effects lasted all day. I'm not a dramatic person who uses hyperboles but this is the worst medication I've ever taken that produced the worst side effects.  This medication should be removed from the market.  There has to be a kinder and safer way to treat H. Pylori. Took my last pill yesterday now waiting for side effects to subside.  Look forward to feeling like my self soon.,F,54,7  days12 pill 4X D,5/24/2015,Pylera
4, 2, H. Pylori,Dizziness_ nausea_ jittery sensation_ weakness_ brain fog_ loss of appetite,This is day one of taking Pylera.  If things get better_ and I pray that they will_ I will update.  There has to be a better treatment for H. Pylori.,F,54,1  days 4X D,5/17/2015,Pylera
5, 1, H Pylori Bacteria,Numbness and tingling in my feet and right hand. Hairy tongue.,I did not have any diarhea or any problems with my stomach. I guess this is why this antibiotic was well absorbed. Thus I have taken 125mg * 3 * 4= 1500mg of metronidazole(the most active ingredient)_ which is in my opinion is very high dosage. Stopped after second day. I am also very tall_ so have very poor blood circulation in my legs and hands.,M,35,2  days 4X D,12/29/2010,Pylera
