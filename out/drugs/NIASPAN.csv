0, 5, high cholesterol,Occasionally I will feel a flushing_ but I know it will go away in 20 to 30 minutes_ so no problem.,It really helps my cholesterol levels. I tried 3 different statins before niacin and had horrible leg pain and mood swings. I felt terrible with statins_ but niacin works great.,M,55,6  years500mg 1X D,12/1/2015,Niaspan

2, 4, cholesterol control,Radical flushing/burning feeling.,"The radical flushing that one would experience taking this medication was effectively controlled by taking an 81mg asprin 30 minutes before bedtime_ then taking the 4 Niaspan caps with two cups of apple sauce. Usually I am not aware of any flushing effects as I sleep. Occasionaly_ I will feel the effect upon waking in the night and rarely upon awaking the next morning. Chocolate and some candy's eaten at bedtime will negate the buffering effect of the apple sauce. These foods also seem to amplify the flushing effect. I would seriously avoid chocolate after taking Niaspan.My cholesterol numbers continue to improve with each 6 month lab test. After receiving a quad bypass at 50_ my heart disease was described as ""quite serious"". Niaspan_ along with lovastatin and carvediol have become my daily regimine_ and I am having little or no negitive side effects from these drugs in combination.",M,53,3  years2000,10/30/2014,Niaspan
3, 5, Elevated Lpa levels,Light flushing_ nausea,My Dr prescribed Niaspan and monitored it with me over a year_ beginning with 500 mg and every 6 weeks increasing the dosage to 750 mg_ 1000 mg_ 1250 mg_ 1500 mg and then finally 2000 mg. This monitoring allowed my body to adjust to the different strengths. However_ my Dr. has now said to stop taking Naispan as studies have recently shown that it is not proven to be as effective as they first thought. Has anyone else heard this? Should I stop all at once or do I need to wean myself from it?,F,66,5  years1000 MG 2X D,10/27/2014Email,Niaspan
4, 1, High Cholesterol_cannot takeStatins,"I took  Niacin ER 2000 mg.for 3 yrs. I expected the occasional flushing and rash on my face. During this time I became very anxious and unable to deal with stress. I was put on two antidepressants. I started with reflux_ nausea_inability to eat without coughing and spitting up_ severe weakness so much that I felt a ""sinking"" feeling and would have to go to bed for an hour several times a day. I attributed the nausea etc. to GI problems. On three occasions during the three years I thought all this was  possibly the flu or stress. Three weeks ago my face began to swell. I looked like I had gained 20 pounds. My weight remained the same. I had blisters on my tongue and sores in my mouth( attributed by my GI MD and Dentist to stress)My tongue felt like it was on fire. I called my Primary care doctor and he said to stop the Niacin immediately and take ASA and Benadryl.I started to look up the side effects of Niacin on medical sites and blogs. All of my symptoms were there. Within one week after stopping the Niacin All of my symptoms disappeared including GI symptoms. I no longer need my acid reducing prescription. I have much more energy. My husband says I am a different person. It has now been three weeks since I quit. I can exercise now and I will gradually start to discontinue my antidepressants.I wish I had known of All the side effects. I urge you all to Refuse to take Niacin!

I slept well that night (first time in a few weeks)_ my mind didn't go goofy with racing thoughts (first time in two weeks)_ and the migraine disappeared the next day.  So I will NOT take this medication again.  I feel soooo much better even after one day of not taking niaspan.However_ I want to tell you that I did NOT experience very much flushing.  I followed my doctor's advice...he said to take one 325 mg. aspirin one hour before taking the niaspan.  Also_ eat an apple or apple sauce with the niaspan.

Basically_ NIH stopped their study when they learned that although Niaspan actually increased HDL_ and reduced triglicerides_ there was ZERO effect of reducing cardiac events_ and there was a slight increase in stroke risk for for the control group.

Don't know if this is connected to Niaspan or another med reaction.,Started 500 mgs to 1000 mgs 1x per day at bedtime.  Always take 3 aspirin or ibuprofen at night for pain.  Now take 30 minutes prior to Niaspan.  First three months_ HDL rose 11 points.  At six months it dropped 9 points lower than the original number.  (Total swing 20 points down.)  Came back up somewhat after nine months.  Doc doubled dose to 2K mgs.  Headaches started.  During a sleep lab study at 1K mgs_ they found my heart rate was 95 while asleep.

So I decided to quit. This is the 3rd day I've been off this med_ and I feel miserable. Since quitting_ I've been urinating excessively_ especially at night_ I've been woozy and very tired. My muscles are stiff. Today at work I suddenly got diarrhea. (Note: I did take Welchol for awhile_ and it worked_ but the muscle aches I experienced were unbearable.

My TC was only about 215 and TGs were the same. Now TC is 165 and TG is 185.,I guess this stuff works but I think changing my diet and eating habits has had a bigger effect. I lost about 18 pounds and plan to lose another 10. I don't eat butter at all anymore_ NO ice cream_ NO beer_ NO pizza_ etc. My hip joints are painful ALL the time. I'm going to quit Niaspan.

Is there another solution to increase your HDL and triglyceride levels other than these drugs? I don't know. My other Doc had me on Crestor and Symbistatin. The Symbistatin made me dizzy.

77, 1, Cholestrol,Unbearable itching.,I used to take Niaspan a few years ago when it was produced with white coating. Side effect was high temperature. But I didn't mind that_ since I took the medicine at bed time. I used to wake-up after midnight and felt the scorch. When the manufacturer changed the coating to pink_ Niaspan started to give me unbearable itching. I complained to my Dr. who changed my prescription to Simcor which is 500 Niaspan mg and 20 mg Simvastatin. I am taking it without any side-effects. That's good news. The bad news is_ Simcor is expensive ($75.00 for a bottle of 30 tablets). I don't know why the hell the manufacturer changed the coating!!! For the sake of sanity of mind I call for boycotting Niaspan and moving to Simcor_ unless the manufacturer's go back to the previous formula.,M,68,6  years1000mg 1X D,3/24/2011Email,Niaspan

I refused to take any more statins due to dizziness and overall yucky feeling.  Doctor prescribed the Niacin to see how I would handle it.  I posted last September (2010) on my immediate reaction_ which was a very hot_ flushed_ skin on fire reaction.  That happened only once.  I then learned to take it with dinner instead of a small snack before bedtime.

I get a very minor flush maybe once every two weeks_but it only lasts a minute or so and that's without taking water.  My body has become used to the niaspan.

Since my doctor wasn't pleased with the 32 HDL_ he put me on 1000 mg of Niaspan daily. So far_ so good. I eat a piece of wheat bread with half a raw apple at about 9:00 P.M.

I am tired during the day but I don't know if that is from the Niaspan or from not sleeping a lot at night. I get my blood test in 3 weeks.

I took it for at least 3 months at 500mg ( soon after my heart attack and  angioplasty thereafter)without even the slightest change in HDL(27). Doc increased the doze to 1500 but at 1000mg the symptoms were practically intolerable with anxiety_ dizziness as I couldn't even drive a car and I just gave up. I subsequently tried few times after few months but each time couldn't tolerate dosage over 500mg (Below 500mg I could tolerate well but it has no benefit for me.,After about 10 months_ as my HDL has not changed a bit_ doc again wants me to try out as this is the only option which can probably work.

106, 3, cholesterol levels,Doc warned me about flushing so I always take with aspirin. had experienced some mild flushes in the first couple months (prickling starts in earlobes_ goes down neck and upper chest). Last night had an EXTREME case of flushing. Was woken at midnight from a deep sleep_ my whole body was on fire. Usually its just upper body_ but this time my whole body (including backside and legs) were insanely hot_ prickly and BRIGHT red all over. Also_ my lower face/lips/chin were oddly swollen and itchy. These effects lasted over an hour. Even the next day_ my earlobes still feel hot and prickly.,If I hadn't already known this was a side-effect of Niaspan_ I would have gone to the emergency room_ convinced something was seriously wrong.  It has made my cholesterol levels better_ but the extreme flushing is scary and I'm starting to think it may not be worth it to keep taking the prescription.,F,42,6  months500mg 1X D,1/14/2011,Niaspan

108, 4, Increase HDL,Occasional flushing shortly after taking the NIASPAN (at night) and infrequently in the AM when I drink a cup of coffee. In all cases this is reduced by an Aspirin does prior to the medication.The NIASPAN does hold up my HDL levels well even on a very reduced fat diet. It does appear to increase skin dryness and sensitivity_ especially in winter_ but a slight increase in fat intake and a good cream makes this possible side effect minimal.Taking Statins_ NIASPAN and Zetia all in the PM_ shot my liver enzymes to 2.5x normal but moving the Zetia to the AM ( which is a better timing anyway) removed this side effect.Since my TGs are very low to start with and the other drugs I take target mostly my LDLs_ it is not feasible to measure what the impacts were on LDLs or TGs in my case. The rest of my family did not tolerate NIASPAN ( or niacin in general ) very well and had to reduce or stop the treatment since the flushing was so severe and extended.,Since I am on a shotgun treatment_ I do have to split the dosing of the drugs AM/PM to avoid impacting my liver enzymes. Since almost all of the cholesterol drugs do have impacts on the liver_ you should be aware of this and monitor how you react to the timing and combination of the multiple drugs and ensure that you do perform the periodic testing of hepatic enzymes especially if the timing and combination of drugs is changed.,M,54,5  years2000 1X D,1/13/2011Email,Niaspan

I think my family practitioner is practicing defensive medicine. I will concede that my set of symptoms are rare_ judging by the low number of other patients who have reported severe long term side-effects.  Nevertheless_ I have no history of hypochondria and I strongly believe that it IS the Niaspan.  My advice to those suffering with severe side effects is to (1) discontinue use immediatly and (2) tell your physician that just because something is rare and you have not seen it_ doesn't mean that reported symptoms cannot be due to Niasapn,M,69,3  weeks1000 mg 1X D,11/26/2010,Niaspan

133, 4, cholesterol,I'm so glad I found this site.  I was searching the internet for my symptoms_ which are waking up feeling like I'm on fire. The first time it happened I freaked out.  My skin was hot_ puffy and bright red everywhere.  I thought something very serious was wrong with me.  I was so scared that I think I must have had a panic attack.  I was dizzy and was having trouble breathing.  I took a cold shower.  It didn't really help.  I told my wife to dial 911.  Luckily_ she was still half asleep and didn't hear me.  I went downstairs to get some water and the feeling just started to go away.  The swelling and redness subsided shortly after.  This feeling of being on fire only happens occasionally_ like maybe a few times a month.  Once I realized it would go away I just started ignoring it.  I've found that if I don't panic_ and ignore the burning_ it will go away in a few minutes.Even though I developed this ignore-it technique_ I was not aware of this side effect being the cause of Niaspan,I have always taken Niaspan at night just before going to bed.  It makes sense that I'd experience the side effects at night or upon waking in the morning.  Now that I know how to deal with them_ it's not a big deal.

145, 2, Low HDL,Been on it for 3 weeks.  Tonight_ for the first time I experienced 'flushing' I guess.  To me_ flushing is just a little bit of a hot face and a little discomfort.   This_ though_ was something completely different.  I awoke at 1:30am after taking my dosage at 11:30pm with my body feeling like I was on fire. My entire body was red.  It was weird.  Being a little sleepy still and trying to figure out what was going on_ I kept trying to remember if I had been sunbathing or something during the day and had forgotten.  It felt like I fell asleep in a suntanning booth for a couple of hours.  I took a shower_ but that didn't help.   I took 3 Ibuprofen about 30 minutes ago and I am starting to feel a little more normal although the tingling and cold chills are still there.

147, 1, chlorestrol,For me Naispan is too closely related to the side effects that I experienced w/Crestor.  Progressively worse leg_ lower back_ shoulder aches_ during the night.  Many sleepless nights_ listlessness and wondering if I will be normal again.  I choose not to endure this pain...I am a very healthy 67 yr.old woman who has marginally elevated chlorestrol level. This Naispan discomfort has given me renewed reason to watch my diet and exercise more.  I take a couple of heaping tablespoons of dry oat bran morning and night.  I have friends who swear by it.  I''m going to try something more natural. Isn't oatmeal supposed to lower bad chlorestrol?,Naispan is just as dangerous as Creator was for me.

154, 1, High triglycerides,I only took this yesterday but never again!  I took the aspirin one hour before bed and took the Niaspan with applesauce_ as my doctor recommended.  Unlike most others here_ I didn't experience the flushing.  I didn't sleep well.  When I got up this morning_ I was extremely dizzy.  I had diarrhea and then violent vomiting and accelerated heart rate.  I was extremely weak and dizzy all day.  I've had bouts of flu that were much easier to deal with.  I am taking a statin and Omega 3's with no problems.  I take a vitamin B complex with a lower amount of niacin and have had no problems with that either.  If my doctor insists_ I will try Lovaza.  Maybe Niaspan helps with triglycerides_ but if I have to feel like death warmed over every day_ it's not worth it.  I'll take my chances and will attempt to lose weight and exercise more.,Good for everyone who can tolerate this medicine.  I wish I could.

155, 2, lower cholesterol,I knew about the flushing in advance_ so went into it with a plan - 10:30 pm_ take one 325 mg aspirin. 11 pm_ take the niaspan and CoQ10.  No alcoholic beverages within at least an hour before taking the niaspan dose_ and (learned this one the hard way) NO spicy foods for dinner. Go to bed around midnight_ and ALWAYS awake around 4 to use the bathroom - that's when the flushing starts_ and it's severe enough to keep me awake. After three weeks of four hours of sleep per night_ I had to take a break. After a day or two of NO niaspan_ realized it had also been causing extra stress and THEN the itching started!  Even with the itch_ it's been nice to get a full night's sleep for a change.  Supposed to start back tonight_ but that may not happen.,Triscuits!  If you eat two Triscuit crackers as your snack WITH the medication_ it helps hold down the flushing. I think it worked a little_ certainly well enough to keep doing it.  And maybe this little bit of info (which I learned from a cardiac nurse) will help someone. Also_ all the recommendations re: aspirin may work fine for some but not for me - I already take both plavix and coumadin and sure don't need another blood thinner added to the mix.,F,62,3  weeks500 mg 1X D,9/19/2010,Niaspan

I have been on the 3000 mg dose for about 8 months.  I experience the flushing once a week.  Some times it is minor and sometimes it is extreme but it always subsides witnin an hour.  I use baby asprin and cold water when a flush hits.  I am concerned about my anxiety levels and my reduced energy levels.  I am very anxious (that knot in the upper part of the abdomen) several nights a week.  My energy levels are very low. I would like to know if anyone else is experiencing heighten levels of anxiety and reduced levels of energy as a result of taking niaspan.,lp(a)_ as I understand it_ is a long chain protien that attaches itself to LDL molecules and creates a super sticky molecule.  High levels of lp(a) significantly increase the chances of a heart attack.  I took the Boston Heart test (I reccomend this test) and found that my lp(a) levels were off the chart.

164, 4, high LDL and low HDL,I started out at a daily dose of 500 mg_ then a few months later was upped to 1000 mg_ with another increase a couple months after that to a total daily dose of 2000 mg. Initially_ the 500 mg dose caused flushing_ especially if I had hot food along with it. That lasted only long enough for me to research what NOT to take it with on the internet. I was fine. When I was raised to 1000 mg a day_ I started flushing again_ but it only occasionally occurred. Again_ when I went to the twice a day 1000 mg dose_ I seldom had flushing in the morning_ when I took my tablet with juice_ followed by a bowl of cereal. On weekends_ if I couldn't wait to have coffee_ the half hour I had learned was the safe waiting period_ I would flush again. The second dose_ in the early evening_ if I took it with my dinner_ not with hot food_ but after dinner if having hot food_ I would not have a problem. But if I forgot and had to take it later in the evening_ it seemed I would experience flushing occasionally.

I therefore take Niaspan on an empty stomach_ contrary to advice.,I am very satisfied with Niaspan: the occasional mad attack of itching is worth the benefits as LP(a) is very bad and difficult to reduce.

My flush always occurs about 3 hrs after taking the pill_ if I get a flush_ which is not all the time.Also_ I read (and you can check out YouTube for some funny niacin flush videos) that the flush is HARMLESS_ and a very common side effect.  It's healthy.  Don't be alarmed by it.  The flushing is opening up your capillaries_ doing its job ridding your body of the toxins.  If you can tolerate it_ stay with it.

I experienced intense flushing each day for 2 - 3 weeks_ then the flushing lessened.  After 6 months I increased to 1000 mg/day_ another 6 months to 1500 mg/day and now 2000 mg/day for 6 months.  With each increase I experienced more flushing again for a couple weeks.  When I went to 2000 mg I increased to 2 81 mg aspirin.  If I miss a day or 2_ I have more severe flushing but for the most part have very little reaction any more.  I have found that taking the 2 aspirin before dinner and the Niaspan about an hour after the aspirin_ the side effects are mildest.,After 10+ years of trying various medications_ and combinations thereof_ my triglycerides and HDL are at normal levels!!

My hdl from 40 to 56_ triglicerides from 180 to 110. ldl from 150 to 32.I heard later that I was lucky as I don't flush easily  and that the reason for taking it all at night is to give your liver some rest time. The previous slo- niacin acted for almost 24 hours and the liver didn't have time to recuperate which led a significant number of people into liver damage.Now I take all 2500mg at night.

I scratched and scratched.  I finally found a cream in the medicine cabinet for itching.  I rubbed it on and then my arms and legs burned and were hot.  Probably because I had already scratched and broken the skin.  After 2 nights of this I realized it was the Niaspan. I was up most of the night - no sleep except for a few hours. My insomnia was caused by the constant itching.  I stopped Niaspan and am fine now.,If you experience intense itchiness_ it may be the Niaspan.Try plain_ old over-the-counter niacin (B3) from the vitamin aisle of your pharmacy.

Sat on the toilet and the flushing seemed to intensify_ and the next thing I know_ I am laying in the floor of my bedroom with my husband trying to wake me up. I passed out while on the toilet and I was unresponsive when he tried to get me up_ so he dragged me into our bedroom. EMS came and could find no pulse nor blood pressure so off to the ER I went_ via ambulance. Once in ER_ as the techs moved me to the bed from the stretcher_ I passed out again and this time began to convulse. The diagnosis was low blood pressure but I go to a neurologist tomorrow. I am wondering if it is a neurological problem,,F,50,1  years,2/1/2010Email,Niaspan

231, 5, Tryglycerides  low hdl   high ldl,Flushing but not every time. Sometimes it's worse but by now I know what to expect.,I had been on various statins for years_ after some time  developed muscle cramp with each one. Had to quit jogging due to the cramps. Quit taking statins_ felt much better but Doctor unhappy. Spring of 2009 tried 1500 mg of Niaspan. Twice a day 750mg. Had stomach problems and quit taking it. Tried Crestor 5mg_ ldl good_ hdl 30_ Tryglycerides high. Fall of 2009  decided to try Niacin again and split  750  mg. Now I take about 375 mg after lunch with some other meds_ including 81mg of Aspirin. My second dose after dinner. I have a reaction 2-4 hours later_ but not every time and with a different intensity. It is something I can live with. With this dose I don't have much of a stomach problem. My last blood test in December 2009 was excellent. Tryglycerides went way down to 114_ ldl great at 93_ hdl went from 30 to 44. I work out almost every day_ but my hdl was 30 before Niacin. I do take Crestor 5mg maybe twice a week. Intend to drop Crestor and see how the ldl will be. Sofar I am happy with the results of Niacin. Will try as some suggested to take vitamin C before taking Niacin,M,66,180  days,1/26/2010Email,Niaspan

Got off for 2 weeks and pain went away.  Started back on it again and again in about 3 weeks leg pain and weakness again.

I am now once again a productive individual without paranoia_ stress and a high temper.The rash on my cheek is still pink - however it is not swollen and warm any longer.  My forehead is no longer bright pink and hot to the touch - it literally looked and felt like a permanent sunburn.  I still have a pink patch on my upper chest - but again it is no longer hot and itchy as before.My eyes!!!!  Wow again.  I no longer have to look through a fog_ I can see again at night without headlights and taillights having huge hazy rings around them.  This side effet took close to a year to clear up.  I no longer have the huge painful sties either.Hope this helps.  Please take caution with this medication as it not only has short term side effects_ but the long term side effects can creep up on you and appear as other medical problems.,M,46,4  years,1/14/2010,Niaspan

Severe loss of memory: completely forgot how to play solitaire_ Scrabble. Driving: drove past exits!,If I could have tolerated Niaspan I would not have hesitated continuing to take it because it is supposedly less harmful than statins (which I cannot tolerate either) since it is a vitamin. Nevertheless use caution when taking this or any medicine.,M,80,30  days,1/10/2010,Niaspan
236, 4, high cholesterol,I have been on Niaspan for about 1.5 years.  I take it right before I go to bed which helps reduce the flushing. I can't take aspirin_ so get the flushing sometimes- but it usually goes away within half hour or so - and usually I can go back and sleep through it.  It does make me a little itchy at night sometimes - like many medications_ there is an adjustment period - but it does get better_ although never perfect from what I have experienced,I can't take statins -so this has helped to bring my cholestorol down and the side effects are intermitent - sometimes I don't feel flushing for a couple months - I think it is worth it - and for those of us who can't take a statin_ it would be wrong to take it off the market because someone else had a poor reaction - if that were true we would not have penicillin!,F,47,1.5  years,1/8/2010,Niaspan

I'm 190lbs and pretty fit. The thorough warning about flushing helped a lot. I can see how this caused panic in some who did not have any expectation of what might happen. I generally tolerate all meds well_ so this side effect thing is news.  Experimenting with time of day and snacks. Will try the apple/juice idea next.  Splitting the dosage seems like a good idea_ although the Abbott nurse said they recommend all at once at bedtime-because the body metabolises cholesteral better at rest.,M,46,10  days,1/5/2010Email,Niaspan

239, 2, HDL low; triglycerides little high,The first night had nausea_ severe itching & burning (as if someone set me on fire while still alive). Though the itchy and burning are not as severe now and no recurrence of nausea_ I also have developed swelling in hands/ankles/feet_ shortness of breath and stiffness in joints (hips_ knees_ ankles_ back_ wrists_ fingers_ arms). I am tired but that may be due to lack of sleep since I wake up frequently due to the fluctuations in body temperature. I have also gained weight probably due to the water retention.,Recovering from a massive pulmonary embolism.  Breathing was finally getting back to normal when doctor prescribed this. I was told to take at bedtime with a snack. Crackers is not a snack. I now take it with a yogurt. I am already on an aspirin regimen and blood thinners so I do not take additional aspirin at bedtime. None of my rings fit due to the swelling in my hands. Shoes are now too tight. I walk like I am 80 due to the stiffness in my joints. I have only been taking this for just over 3 weeks and feel the side effects are worse than any benefit. I have not had additional blood tests so I do not know if this medication is effective.

I called my doc and asked for another script and told him what I planned to try.  He said he had never heard of it but it wouldn't hurt to try.  I take 500mg Vit C with each 500 Niaspan_ in the morning and again at night.  I only take 1000 mg a day of Niaspan.  It works great.  I hardly ever flush but if I do have a little_ I just take more C and it goes away.  I  use regular Vit C but Ester C works too.  Ya'll try it and let me know if it works for you.

I will work my up into to 1_000's mg after a few months. I do feel bad for the people that were not told of the side effects by their prescribing doctor (qwack). It must have been a scary episode for 1-2 hours till it went away. But... we are adults and almost every pharmacy prints out the drugs data sheet with side-effects listed. Maybe people should pay more attention and read it.,I tried taking a statin and I knew to take CO-Q 10 but I still got extremly painful muscle cramps. Statins are poison for people that do not have heart disease and out of 100 people taking statins only 2 have heart attacks and out of 100 people taking a sugar pill_ 3 have heart attacks. That is where they (the statin creators) get the 33% less chance of having a heart attack. I have really high cholesterol like tri's over 500 and chol over 250 but it is hereditary and no one in my family history has died of heart disease. Go figure.,M,33,20  days,8/4/2009,Niaspan
270, 2, High cholesterol,"It was 1 a.m. when I awoke with acute flushing and burning_ all over my body.  At 9 p.m._ last night_ I took my usual dosage of 500mg_ a reduced Rx_ down from 1000mg that I had taken up until two months ago.  The reduction was because of mild flushing I has experienced.Tonight's reaction is much more severe that any I had previously experienced.  As I write this_ my entire body is burning and covered with the ""pin prick"" syndrome.  My skin is bright red and my heart is throbbing although the rate is not accelerated.  It is now one hour since the symptoms woke me out of a deep sleep and there is no reduction of the symptoms.  I am experiencing a chill and I'm shaking all the while my skin is burning.I even submerged myself in my swimming pool in an effort to find comfort.  It didn't help.  Hopefully_ the ""attack"" will subside soon so I can get back to sleep.",Before retiring_ last evening_ I had a late dessert ... cherry pie ala mode with chocolate ice cream.  In reading at least one other report from this site_ I suspect that chocolate may be the culprit.  I am going to discontinue taking this Rx until I can consult with my physician.,M,76,2  years,8/3/2009,Niaspan

272, 1, High cholesterol,I never had any problems with this UNTIL LAST NIGHT!! I was dreaming I was in a room with the heater cranked up to the max. I woke up and my heart was pounding out of my chest_ my skin was ON FIRE from head to toe_ It looked like I had the worst sunburn ever all over my body_ it felt like millions of needles poking me_ I was dizzy and had a hard time breathing. This all happened about 3am and my wife took me to the ER where they gave me benadryl and a steroid shot. This lasted a little over an hour. I will not take this again.,,M,42,5  weeks,7/31/2009,Niaspan

274, 1, high triglycerides,Took Niaspan 500 for 2 months with no problems. Always took a Motrin 1/2 hour before_ along with an applesauce snack cup. Was awakened with itching one night_ which turned into a full blown episode - swelled up so bad I couldn't bend my legs_ felt like a thousand bees stinging my body_ couldn't move my arms_ heart pounding_ couln't talk_ couldn't breathe_ husband helped me into the bathroom where I fainted dead away.  I have never fainted in my life and I stayed out for a while. My hubby was scared to death! This whole episode lasted for almost 2 hours.,"I called my Doctor the next day_ and she told me that I probably got scared from the ""flushing"" and my fright caused me to faint!!! Yeah - right.  Told me to wait 4 days and try it again.  Never will this poison pass through my lips ever again.

277, 4, Low HDL,During the first few weeks I had one very hot flash that woke me up and had uncomfortable tingling in my arms during the day.  I've had two or three other times when I woke up feeling like I had been lightly sunburned_ but nothing like the first blast.  I've learned not to eat spicy foods at supper and always take 1/2 aspirin a half hour before the Niaspan--then eat some yogurt or low-fat snack with it before bedtime.,I started with 500 mg dose and after three months the Dr. was very pleased with the results and has not increased the dosage.,M,63,4  months,7/14/2009,Niaspan

I ate some japanese food right before bedtime last night_not a good idea. I have since I've been on these drugs been told that I now have to see a cartelogist and a urologist as my EKG has changed and I now have cysts on my left kidney. I'm not blaming the drugs_ but I've been told by a former Navy medic_ that an over the counter SLO-Niacin is what he takes and he has been getting good reports on his cholestrol and blood pressure. I've had the episodes of hot flashes about four times now.I will be asking if I could be taking the less intrusive over the counter niasin.,M,59,2  years,7/14/2009Email,Niaspan

THIS LASTED ABOUT A HALF HOUR AND THEN SUBSIDED. I WENT TO WORK THAT NIGHT(I'M A NURSE) AND BEGAN TO FEEL LIGHT-HEADED_ FELT LIKE MY EARS WERE LIKE HEADS OF CULIFLOWERS!,I WAS RED ALL OVER FROM MY EARS TO MY TOES.

281, 2, Cholestrol control,Took the first dose of 1000mg of Niaspan and experienced the extreme hot flashing...taking the 325mg aspirin definitely helped_ but I was a bit concerned about the effect of the aspirin on my stomach.  After several months of taking this_ I started having nausea/dizziness that started each day around 9am and continued throughout the day. Stopped taking the niacin/aspirin combo and the nausea/dizzy symptoms subsided.,I think this can be a useful tool for some people to lower the cholestrol levels. Everyone's body varys medication tolerance   I think the keys are nutrition and getting everything balanced.  Since most of us are not chemistry minded enough to evaluate which substance is out of whack in the bloodstream_ we end up being at the mercy of those who are more knowledgable--kind of scary!  I cannot tolerate statins--thank God! I just read some studies on the effectiveness of statins and discovered that none of the major studies showed any improvement in mortality rates.  While some of the statins lowered cholestrol levels_ the differences were only a few points compared to those who did not take them_ AND women were more likely to be adversely affected by statins than the men.  It stops production of CoQ10 and a host of other necessary cell chemistry functions.  So Niaspan can be a positive alternative to the BAD statins!  I also just read that measuring homocysteine (without going into the chemical compound info_ it's bad stuff that attacks good cells)levels is 40% more effective in determining heart attack/stroke risk than looking at cholestrol levels. I don't think Niaspan will do anything to change homocysteine levels_ since its just B3--takes a carbon/hyrogen compound to do that. I am exploring/researching other options that would be more plant based than pharmaceutical.,F,54,2  months,6/15/2009Email,Niaspan
282, 1, Low HDL,I am taking the 1000 mg version for low HDL. The doctor all together forgot to tell me about flushing.

I took it in accordance with my dr's instructions (aspirin and a light snack) and had been told about ""flushing"" and ""itching.""  What happened to me was so far beyond that that I can't describe it.  About 4:30 AM_ I woke up with INTENSE itching of my feet.  Then the ""flushing"" (all over the body) kicked in and I felt that I couldn't breathe I was so hot.  Finally this horrendous itching started in my legs and I had to wrap them in cool wet towels and and rub them constantly up and down my legs.  I felt out of my mind with the itching; it was worse than any pain I've had.  I waited for it to stop and it didn't. I took benedryl and aspirin; no relief.  Finally after 5 hours of this_ my husband took me to urgent care where they gave me 2 shots; one of benedryl and the other some other drug to stop reactions; can't remember what.

My doctor told me nothing about possible side effects nor anything about how to take it to lessen the side effects.  This reaction scared the hell out of me!  Thought I was going into an anaphylactic reaction.  Woke my husband to take me to Urgent Care.  Told myself to calm down_ took a bath_ took a Benadryl_ and sat down at the computer to look up Niaspan side effects.  Within 30 minutes the rash and fire subsided.  WHEW!!  Don't know if I will continue taking this_ but need to look into alternative ways to address the cholesterol issue as I had a nearly-fatal heart attack last year_ and don't want the stent to clog up.  From reading other patients' postings on this site I now know to take aspirin and a low fat snack prior to dosing and to take it at bed time (I took mine with breakfast this morning to avoid a sick stomach)_ so perhaps I will try again tomorrow.

Increased to 1000 mg for 3 months but little change with HDL_ though LDL went down to normal. Now taking 1500mg for the past 3 weeks with baby aspirin to raise HDL. For the past 9 months_ I've changed my diet with lo fat food and burn 2000 cal / week thru regular exercise. For the past one week had severe stomach pain and further diagnosis revealed kidney stones. Stopped taking Niaspan as I'm taking medication to flush out the kidney stones. Not sure why this happened_ probably niaspan flushing out all plaque and kidneys retaining all those?

304, 5, Plaque Regression & low HDL,Flushing- typical_ a minor nusance at best.,"RESPONSE TO PREVIOUS POST: ""Why would anyone take this medication when there are so many others out there that can help HDL without these drastic side effects. These side effects cannot be good for other organs in the body."" Answer: Because it's the only drug on the market that has been proven by the FDA to actually regress the plaque in your ateries_ i.e._ remove it_ while boosting your HDL. (Carries LDL-rich plaque stuck to your artiers back to the liver for removal) Statins don't do this nor does any other medication! OTC (aka immeadiate release Niacin is not nearly as effective_ you would have to take the equivalent of 9 grams a day_ and the flushing is more severe.) They have proved this with many major studies (FATS and Arbiter 2_ just to name a few) of patients who had experienced heart attacks_ with ateriograms taken before treatment and after treatment with amazing results_ and the best part is its all natural. So yes_ miss lady...you can take a statin or fibrate to slightly raise your HDL_ but what are you going to do about the unstable LDL that's already stuck to your arteries that may break off and cause a stroke_ a stent perhaps?? I have been on this med for months_ and yes you will turn beat red_ warm and tingly for around 30 mins_ but is not taking it worth years off your life? You would be surprised how many doctors are truly not 'up to snuff' on disease state knowledge and effective prescribing_ so choose wisely!",F,29,13  months,4/4/2009,Niaspan
305, 4, Low HDL_ High Lp(a)_ High Lppla2,It took my body nearly a month to adjust to the drug. Initially severe mood swings_ severe headaches_ exaustion_ lucid dreaming_ intense flushing on 14th day_ mild flushing a couple of days after that_ in general I felt like crap_ and then everything went back to normal after taking it for about 30 days.  I still have lucid dreaming_ but nothing else really.  At first the side effects were so awful that I almost quit taking it_ but I decided to stick it out for about one month_ and I'm glad I did. At least this is a vitamin_ and not a drug like a statin. Everything can have side effects_ but I'd rather take this.  I also take Thorne Research Omega plus and AR-ENCAP supplements alog with a daily multivitamin.,I read this site when I started on this_ and it scared the hell out of me.  It hasn't been that bad_ really.  You have to be prepared for flushing! Yes_ it feels like you've been rolled in poison ivy and thumbtacks_ doused with gasoline and set a blaze!  Nothing helps it_ you have to wait it out.  My first flush lasted 3 hours.  Luckily we live in the middle of nowhere_ because I ended up sitting on the deck in February with no clohes on!  However_ if you read holistic boards_ there are many people who take niacin in order to feel the flush.  They use it to detoxify.  You just have to remember not to panic_ relax_ it WILL subside.  Do not sit up quickly_ the flushing means you've vasodialated.  I've been on it for 2 months and I flushed one big time and two other minor times right at 14 days.  I do take it with 81 mg of aspirin.  For the first month I took it with a snack_ I don't do that anymore_ I just take my aspirin and niaspan with a large glass of water with no problems.

He suggested I take a children's aspirin before taking the Niaspan and eat some fat-free wheat thins after taking it. After reading this site_ I began with a regimen of eating a yogurt_ taking the aspirin_ then the Niaspan_ then about 5 fat-free wheat thins. I always take it before going to bed. I have had only a few times where I experienced mild flushing. Within the last week I decided to try taking the Niaspan without the yogurt and crackers and have had no side effects. For now_ I am only taking the aspirin and Niaspan with no problems.,"I rated this a 4 based on the fact that I've essentially had no side effects. However_ I do not know yet if it has helped my cholesterol levels. After one month of 500 mg and one of 1000 mg the doctor will check my cholesterol again. I'm not sure if it can change that much in two months_ but I'll find out. I was unwilling to take any statin drugs_ so this is my doctor's other choice. The only problem I have with Niaspan is the price! I noticed at SAM's Club that 500 mg ""non-flushing"" formula Niacin is available at a very reasonable price. I wonder if it would have the same benefit as Niaspan.",M,50,52  days,4/1/2009Email,Niaspan
307, 4, high cholesterol,Standard flushing in the early stages of use.  My concern after taking it for ten years is possible muscle cramps_ especially leg muscles.,I have taken 1000 mg twice daily. The side effects will subside and not be a concern as you continue to use it.  It has helped my HDL_ LDL_ and Trig. really well.  The addition of Zetia was fantastic with immediate results within a few weeks_ but as we know Zetia had bad reports so most of us quit taking it.My concern is muscle aches. One of my friends swears he took Niaspan for just a time_ couple months and it messed his back muscles up majorly.  I view that as questionable.  The benefit from Niaspan seems to far out weigh  the concerns. Research indicates a minimum dose of 1000 mg. to make any difference. If you can do 1000 mg. You can try twice a day and examine the test results. I have read many good reports here. Agree with those who advocate the massive dose_ and taking it at night.Ten hears ago I had a massive heart attack_ left ventricle damage.  They gave me four months at best.  I have tried it all at one time or another_ and here simply because of alpha blockers_ bata blockers_ statins_ and a very positive attitude. Those who complain of a little flushing will never survive a heart attack.  Flush me_ flush me_ if it helps me live a longer and healthier life.,M,69,10  years,3/28/2009,Niaspan
308, 3, high cholesterol,Could not tolerate Lipitor and Tricor  (terrible leg pain) so my doc prescribed Niaspan with milk thistle and aspirin at bedtime starting with 500 mg. Cholesterol started to fall but slowly. Increased to 1_000 mg and then had first flushing attack. Figured out that eating anything with fat (even low fat) close to taking dosage can trigger. Flushing is like being on fire_ red ants stinging_ can't sit_ stand or sleep_ swollen and red skin_ next day fatigue and sluggish brain. You get the idea. This has now happened 4 times (like last night) and I am seriously thinking of asking my doc to reduce the dosage or take me off Niaspan since I am suspecting that my body is becoming sensitized.  The side effects really suck.,I'd rather take niaspan than the meds like lipitor or tricor but wish the niaspan flushing reaction could be controlled better. It is a problem.,F,54,1  years,3/24/2009,Niaspan

Was told reaction varied significantly but some level of flushing was common. From then on was fine with the occasional flushing almost always as result of not followed the suggested directions.1000mg was quite bad with flushing every time that varied from annoying turn red & pin itchy to near naked rolling in the snow screaming_ running shirtless in freezing weather_ cold shower for an hour_ etc. After a couple of months I told the doctor I couldn't handle it emotionally and was switched me back to 500mg. I wonder if 750mg would have been ok_ but that doesn't seem to be a standard dose.,,M,42,2  years,3/15/2009,Niaspan

I called my Dr office since it was 10:30 at night they contacted some on call Dr.  That Dr. didn't mention it was a normal side effect either! Told me to take benedryl or go to ec!!!!  It went away after about 2 hrs. I talked to my Dr. the next day and she then told me it was normal and blah blah blah.

He had just taken his medicine and I went downstairs to do laundry.  I came back upstairs and thought he was asleep in his recliner instead he had died.  Niaspan is dangerous and should not be taken with statins.  This is being investigated by the FDA and others.  The doctor that prescribed the Niaspan also worked for the company going all over the country lecturing about how wonderful NIaspan was.  Please be careful of statins and niaspan.

I find any form of statin impossible to take due to muscle cramps.I am always tired on Niaspan but that could be my thyroid packing up. I have seen some evidence somewhere that niaspan can cause hypothyroidism_ and am wondering if that has been my cause as the family seems to be clear for generations back.

The flushing sometimes_ but not often_ wakes me up at night and lasts about 10-15 minutes.  Its not that bad and I can deal with it.  The problem is it makes my joints and muscles ache and weak_ especially the legs and bottom of my feet.  They feel fatigued_ like I've been walking 10 miles in bad shoes. The doctor told me to quit taking niaspan about a year ago in preparation of a colonoscopy and the pain went away.  I didn't put two and two together until last week when I started taking the niaspan again and within a couple of days the leg and foot pain returned.  It never raised my HDL more than a few points but the doctor said I should continue its use anyway because of its overall benefits.  I haven't talked to my doctor about the leg pain yet.

This is the highest therapeutic dose recommended.Side effects include flushing and itching_ and tightening of tendens behind knees.Niaspan should only be taken at bed time as the liver produces cholesterol during the sleep cycle.  The other benefit is that the flushing and itching is significantly reduced or eliminated during sleep.The flushing never really bothered me too much... at least not to the point that I ever thought about discontinuing Niaspan.I had taken niacin a number of times years earlier_ so I knew about the flushing and itching in advance of starting Niaspan.   Niaspan side effects are nothing in comparison.  I rarely get any flushing or itching now... and not a big deal when I do.  I just expose my skin to the air and go back to sleep.,Before Niaspan: T-Chol 328_ Trig 304_ LDL 222_ HDL 46.After  Niaspan: T-Chol 181_ Trig 150_ LDL 100_ HDL 52.My triglicerides can fluctuate upwards of 300 at times_ which I attibute 100% to alcohol and sweet mixers.  Cutting out alcohol and sugar drops my Triglicerides down to 150.If flushing and itching are your only side effects_ I highly recommend sticking with Niaspan as the flushing and itching will subside.  Start with a low dose and build up tollerence before increasing dose.  I've tried verious statins over a 7 year period and none of them lowered my cholesterol to the level that Niaspan did.  And Niaspan side effects are nothing compared to the side effects statins cause.  ,M,49,3  years,11/22/2008,Niaspan

353, 1, lower Cholesterol,My ears turned red and felt like fire. It started to spread. I started to itch and broke out in small bumps. Benadryl spray eased it. I thought I was having an allergic reaction. I have a hard time falling asleep. I have wierd dreams and wake up all night long. I have headaches. I used the asprin just like they said and if it helps I would be scared to know what would happen if I didn't take it. It has also made my stomach feel bloated_ given me constipation_ gas_ and nausea. This is only 500 mg.,I am watching my diet and increasing exercise. I wish it was just a flush. It felt more like the fires of hell after rolling in posion ivy. It makes hot flashes look like a walk in the park.,F,54,1  months,9/17/2008,Niaspan
354, 3, Low HDL,"""Flushing"" does not begin to describe the experience of this medication at its worst.  I have been rather non-compliant with it over the last 5 years because of the side effects but whenever I get motivated to start up again I spend a few days in HELL building up my tolerance.  I woke up last night feeling like I was in broiler.  I don't mean that lightheartedly.  I really felt like I was surrounded by fire.  Standing made it a little better but you can't sleep standing up.  I took a decongestant (for the vasoconstrictor effect) and watched TV with cool compresses on my legs for 2 1/2 hours before I could go back to bed.  I couldn't recline on the couch because that made it feel worse.  It feels like your entire body is sunburned and no amount of lotion will help.  By the way_ being in Minnesota I can say that cool air temperature does not make this feel any better.  If anything_ all it does is give you a chill.  And that's just from 1000mg.  I have to build myself back up to",Having gone off and back on Niaspan several times for 5 or so years I can say that the worst period for me is start of the regimen.  Building up tolerance is excruciating.  But once I did that_ the side effects went away.  I tried the aspirin thing but it never seemed to make any difference.,M,43,5  years,9/16/2008,Niaspan

Been exercising 3 times a week_ can't seem to get the good cholesterol raised.,M,61,6  months,9/16/2008,Niaspan
356, 4, low hdl,when first prescribed the doctor did not say much other than may have some flushing. I had major flushing and drop in BP. Bigeest mistake is the doctor did not know about starting patients out on low doses and building up. See that over and over again in these posts.  Anyone should TELL your doctor that you want a starter pack. Go slow several weeks before increasing doses,Has helped my HDL. I'm glad I did my research (former medic) and can probably stay on it.,F,53,1  years,9/13/2008,Niaspan

358, 4, to lower triglycerides & raise HDL,Have figured out how to live with this drug_ which I've been on for 2 months.  For me_ I have to take it after eating dinner. If I take it then I can tolerate it and don't wake up with the burning sensations or racing heart.  I have to time it so that if I'm going to the gym I do so before taking the Niaspan.,,F,52, ,9/6/2008,Niaspan
359, 4, reducing triglycerides,Weakness_ fatigue excessive daytime sleepiness. Helped these symptoms when dosage reduced back to 500 mg from 1000 mg. Last night missed my dosage_ feel great today. I also take 81 mg aspirin 30 minutes prior to taking Niaspan. Triglycerides down to normal range.,Appreciate any recommendations on reducing these side effects.,M,48,2  years,9/5/2008Email,Niaspan
360, 2, Triglycerides and low HDL,I had been on Tricor for a few years.  It reduced my triglyrides from 900 to about 200.  My HDL was still low (teens and twenties). So my MD wanted me to try niaspan. I followed his instructions to the letter. I have experienced flushing and developed what looked like eczema.  I had to take prednisone for a couple of weeks. I stayed with niaspan but will be going off now. My latest results show a negligible improvement in HDL_ a significant worsening in triglycerides_ and a now for the first time in my life elevated blood glucose. I was better off on tricor.,It may work for some people but not for me.,M,56,3  months,9/3/2008,Niaspan
361, 1, High Cholesterol,I really REALLY dislike Simcor.  My doctor put me on it for high Cholesterol.  I was warned about the hot flushes_ however_ during the 2nd month of this medication_ I began experience extremely itchy skin. About 48 hours_ I woke up with a rash on me from head to toe.  I now look like I have a case of chickenpox.  I stopped taking this drug from hell (It has been 1 week)_ the welts are drying up and scabbing.  I asked to be switched to something else_ but had no success.  This does not look good when I am trying to find a job and go on interviews.  I am forced to wear long sleeves.  I have to put socks on my hands during the night so that I don't dig.  My husband has woken me up on many occasions with me literally making myself bleed.  The doctor says that it is all in my head and wanted to send me to a shrink.  I am now headed to a dermatologist.,,F,41,2  months,9/3/2008Email,Niaspan
362, 4, Low HDL,Been on drug approx 2 months and have flushed in a serious way just 2-3 times and lasted only about 10-20 minutes... and yes_ it does feel like you're on fire and it travels down your body. Some minor flushing another half dozen times early on that woke me up briefly. Oddly_ though it may be in my head_ I seem to be more conscious of the feeling of my heart beating_ though heart rate is normal... again_ not sure if that's real or imagined.,After reading many posts re: side effects_ many seem extreme. Some_ however_ seem avoidable or controllable or your doctor didn't warn you ahead of time. Its important... don't take in the morning or during the day_ take right when you go to bed. Take an aspirin an hour before (or an Advil). And take Niaspan prescribed by the doctor_ NOT OTC self prescribed. If have a large dinner that contains something that is high in Niacin (beef_ liver_ brewers yeast in unfiltered beer) consider cutting your dose in half for that night only.  Remember_ for this drug to work_ you need massive doses 1/2 - 2 grams.... if you're up to 2 grams and have been for a month or 2 and your HDL hasn't moved_ there's no point to continuing... but for many_ it will work wonders.,M,37,2  months,8/28/2008,Niaspan
363, 5, ,itchy once a week in the morning,This is my second try at Niaspan and I am glad I tried it again. Doctor told me my TRI were 1300. After six weeks @ 2000mg they were 113.

These subsided after three or four weeks_ but occasionally they return.,Symptoms are helped by taking one aspirin one hour before taking my 2000mg of Niaspan.

I had very similar reactions...extremely hot_ waking up in the middle of the night sweating profusely_ racing heart_ can't catch my breath_ etc. I agree that this is not normal flushing. It is more like your body is ON FIRE!!! I am hot natured anyway and it is summertime in Alabama. I might could possibly take this if I lived in the Arctic!!!,"I wonder if they used the name Simcor to hide the ""Niacin"" part of this drug so that drug reps could ""sell"" this drug to more doctors???

I took 4000mg daily of the OTC_ and I was switched over at the same 4000mg daily for the Niaspan. For the next 6 weeks I had nausea_ vomited once_ and generally felt bad. I went back to my doctor and questioned him about the Niaspan. He told me if I was going to have a reaction_ I would have known it the first time I took it. I continued taking it until July 11_ 2008_ when I became so nausious that I couldn't get off the couch. Later that night_ I went into the bathroom and nearly passed out. 5 hours later I was in the ER_ then admitted to ICU with a bleeding artery in my stomach and a hgb of 5. I received 3 units of blood_ but had elevated liver enzymes_ was tachycardic_ jaundiced_ and had a high prothrombin time_ all unexplained.

369, 2, To improve HDL,A big flash the first time at 500 mg. Hit me when I was moving around. Flashes tapered off over the next few weeks_ but I noticed whenever I had a big or late dinner and followed it with Niaspan_ it increased the chances of flashes; big & small. Titrated up to 1000 mg tablet without much trouble and stayed with it for most of a year. HDL levels got worse (37 to 33). Now at 1500 dose_ hoping for improvement.,To ward off flashes_ I've done 2 things... 1 - Eat light before taking the pill. I think that pill will disolve in your stomach acids on top of a big meal and feed you a big dose all at once when it finally moves into the intestines (that's my theory to explain my experience). 2 - Be still after taking it_ as you would be still when you sleep. Moving around increases the risk of a flash_ and if I have one_ moving around makes it much_ much worse. If I wake up with that sunburn type flash going on_ I lay still & calm and it passes within minutes. If I get up_ move around and fail to stay calm_ I'm in for a whopper...,M,52,1  years,8/1/2008Email,Niaspan

I awoke 'flushing' - it felt like I'd been skinned_ dipped in gasoline and set on fire. I got up to splash myself with cold water. I was light-headed and very dizzy. Then I experienced nausea and belly cramps_ diarrhea. Eventually_ (a couple of hours)_ those symptoms abated and I experienced extreme chills.,My doctor took me off Niaspan when I told him about the severity of the reaction_ also my liver enzyme levels were rising_ (I also take a statin drug to reduce cholesterol).

After s24-hours I couldn't complete a workout at my fitness center; and getting out of my pool I couldn't get my breath and felt faint. I had unexpected headaches and restless sleep. I am alergic to statins and there were similar effects with Niaspan.  I am a type II diabetic and my blood glucose score increased an average of 10 points while taking this drug. I stopped and after one day I feel much better but am not back to where I was before I started this drug.

Took it with a baby aspirin and only had a couple instances of minor flushing (warmth and tingling that started in my head and face and moved down my body).  After a 1.5 months_ my cholesterol numbers worsened.  My HDL actually went down (37 - 34) and my LDL went up.

I've since had a couple of intense flushing episodes that woke me up in the middle of the night where I was boiling hot and skin was tingly. Itching followed that was difficult to bear.  Then took a shower to get ready for work and the itching was insane.  My doctor wants me to increase my dosage to 3000mg_ but I'm nervous about the itching.

379, 1, High Triglycerides_ HDL at edge (4),On only the 3rd day of taking one 500 mg. pill at 8 AMI was driving and suddenly went totally hot_ burning prickling hot all over my face. It spread down my neck to the rest of my body_ my thighs esp. were burning like mad. My hands swelled up (I was wearing rings and noticed it) and saw my face swelling too. Was ready to go to the ER except I had heard the flushing would stop. I was boiling hot and had trouble focussing and pulled over at a fast-food place. I thought I was going to faint_ and was shuffling like an old woman hunched over from the pain.The pain(s) did not stop for over an hour_ I tried to eat something_ thinking my breakfast hadn't been big enough. But I felt nauseous and ended up in the bathroom dry-heaving and then had violent diarreah. I managed to drive home 25 minutes and had trouble focussing and pulled over twice. When I got home I lay down and passed out. My whole body was aching like a flu reaction. When I woke up I felt weak and disoriented.,I had wanted to take regular Niacin_ which I had done in my 20s for depression. So I know what that flushing can feel like -- and  this was OUT OF CONTROL! Like people on here said_ really_ really terrible and painful.As per lowering triglycerides_ from the reviews here it does not seem either as if it works very well for that. The pharmacist had talked me out of taking regular Niacin 'because there's no quality control.' Ha_ I'm wondering why she works at Pharmaca which specializes in thousands of 'no-quality control' supplements!

By the time the ambulance arrived_ I was getting over the episode.  Spent 9 hours in the E.R.: I.V._ Blood work_ cat scan_ x-rays...doctor wanted to keep me for more tests.

384, 3, High Cholesterol/Triglycerides,Mild Flushing_ Increased Appetite_ Rapid Fatigue During Exercise,Have a combination of two rare high cholesterol and high triglyceride conditions (CHOL >300_ TG >1000).  Previously treated with maximum dosage of statins until Lipitor stopped having desired effect (CHOL> 220 on max dose) and switched to Crestor until labs showed liver/kidney problems even at lowest dose.  Currently treated with 20mg Lipitor and 1000mg niaspan.   Initially worked up to 2000mg per day niaspan over 4 months as directed.  Month 2 (1000mg) showed best lab results but began seeing decreased stamina in gym and increased appetite (weight gain) which was at its highest during month 3 (1500mg) and month 4 (2000mg).  Turns out niaspan effects the thyroid which results in these effects of winded/breathlessness after very short exertions and appetite changes. Effectiveness also decreased at highest dosage (CHOL back to 300_ TG back to 750).  MD reduced me back to 1000mg (when CHOL/TG were in perfect range)...awaiting quarterly lab results now.

After a call to the pharmacy_ I tried Benedryl_ which alleviated the itch only slightly.  I went to the ER_ where I was given Valium via IV.  It helped the itch.  After a few hours the redness began to dissipate.,At 2:30 in the morning_ I was awoken by a burning sensation on my calf_ behind my knee.  My skin felt warm and was bright red_ particularly my cheeks_ legs and butt.  I began to itch on my right upper arm and my thighs.  Itch does not adequately describe the agony of the practically-painful itch.  My body was twitching from the itch.  My doctor had warned me about the flushing and hot skin_ saying the side effect was not an allergic reaction and was benign.  He suggested that each night I take aspirin (325 mg) with some apple sauce.  Thirty minutes later I was to take the Niaspan with the other half of the apple sauce.  He said for uncertain reasons the apple sauce helped reduce the effects of Niaspan.  This seemed to work_ and I only had one incident of brief flushing when I had forgotten the apple sauce.  I have not needed to have the apple sauce at this point_ or so I thought.  Now_ after seven weeks I had this drastic reaction.  The ER considered this an allergic reaction.

I have been taking for around 45 days now; started with 500 mg and increased to 1000 mg after 30 days.  I took my first blood test in Jan 2006 and C=315_ T=1058_ HDL=50_ and LDL=81.  I have always been active (jog 10-30 miles/week) and ate fairly healthy so my problem is hereditary. Have changed my diet in two years_ lost around 20 lbs (must not have been eating as good as I thought_ lol) and numbers haven't changed significantly in the last 1-1/2 years.

The burning and flushing can be very strong at times_ but knowing that these syptoms are normal helps me deal with them.,After taking Statins for about 20 years my body is starting to have some problems with Statins_ e.g._ muscle problems and not as effective.  Taking Niaspan in addition to Tricor_ has helped treat my high triglicerides and given me another option.

I am a regular blood donor so I get a reading every couple of months when I donate.  I'm thrilled with the results_ especially not having to take a statin.

Lowered LDL from 159 to 133.,I don't know if my fatigue is a direct result (muscular) of Niaspan_ or an effect of not sleeping well (which I believe is the result of the Niaspan).

393, 3, low HDL,In the 2 years that I've been taking the drug I've only had maybe 3 flushing episodes. They only lasted about 15 minutes or so.,They helped raise my HDL just slightly.

395, 4, Low HDL,Have experienced the flushing on maybe five occasions.  The itching in the morning is much worse than the flushing.  I take it with an 81mg aspirin and two Kirkland fishoil pills and 20+ ounces of water.  I haven't had a flushing episode in months.  If I drink too much alcohol_ I make sure to drink A LOT of water and I may drop dose to 500mg from 1000mg for that evening.,My HDL has raised ever so slightly_ but its a tough number to move up.  I'm sticking with it as the ratio is ugly and family genetics are not on my side.  I'd rather wake up with itching once a month than not wake up at all.,M,36,9  months,4/16/2008,Niaspan

400, 3, High LDL,One occurence of minor facial flushing during the daytime after about 3 days of taking a 500mg dose before bedtime. Flushing lasted about 20 minutes. The only other side effect I have noticed is the tendency for the skin on my neck to be slightly red and irritated at times. Moisturizing lotion helps.,I took 500mg for one month and have been on 1000mg for about a month. I have not been retested for my cholesterol levels yet. I have been very pleased with the side effect profile of this drug. It may be coincidental_ but since beginning this drug_ I seem to have more vivid_ memorable dreams. I am a runner and found that statin drugs(vytorin) affected my leg muscles and overall stamina. I will NEVER take another statin. I am hoping that Niaspan works.,M,41,2  months,3/26/2008,Niaspan

402, 1, To increase HDL (good),Was on it for three months and then one night I woke up with a feeling like I was on fire.  I actually thought some one had lit me on fire.  My face turned red and felt as if it was swelling.  My skin felt like it was melting and my clothes touching my skin was extremely painful.  Ended up in the ER_ when they found out I was on Niaspan they gave me asprin and water.  My doctor never told me about the possibility of flushing.  I was scared to take this medicine after that but my doctor convinced me I really needed it.  So_ I started taking it again and last night (after a week of taking it this time) I took asprin and still had severe flushing.  I don't like the feeling of burning alive and the pain seemed to be worse this time.  I sat outside at 1 a.m. in my pajamas with no shoes or socks on for a half hour_ it was 30 degrees out.  After that I laid on my kitchen floor with the back door open for two hours.  Flushing seems to last at least three hours for and the next day I still feel,,F,29,1  weeks,3/25/2008,Niaspan

Had one mild flushing episode due to not following the directions for taking the dose (had a whiskey after dinner).,I notice that most people complaining are not honest about following directions. One guy admitted that he ate chili for dinner. The instructions tell you to stay away from spicy foods. My doctor recommeded a handful of Triscuits_ a cup of yougurt and the asprin to slow the absorption of the drug and limit the side effects. WORKS GREAT!!!!!,M,41, ,3/21/2008,Niaspan

Chills became so severe I ended up living the past couple of weeks under a pile of blankets_ praying for sleep so I would not feel the nausea. A few days ago my hands and arms started moving and jerking as did my jaw_  I had no control.  I stopped the Niaspan 1000 mg.  By the next morning the nausea was gone_ no more chills or transient headaches.  If the doctor told me I would die if I did not continue with Niaspan_ my response would be that I felt I was dying by taking it.,F,71,2  months,3/21/2008Email,Niaspan

We were told side effects were normal and to take an asprin and drink lots of water.  The next morning I had severe diarrhea.,I will not take anymore.  The side effects_ although normal_ were in my opinion severe.  I will try to find another method to help reduce my triglycerides.

Layed down at 9:30 about 30 min later face felt hot and flushed then itchy.  this moved to my whole body.  The tingly felt like needles all over my body_ and the heat.  I became very nervious_ heart rate was very high_ this lasted for over 3 hours.  The only relif I felt was walking in the cool night air in very lose PJ_ which at midnight I bet look pretty strage.  I had to keep moving to help either control the itchy pain or make me forget about it.  I must have walked 2 miles.  Could not stand still_ very irritable.  It is 3:00am and I am still up_ I have done a lot of things in my life but the last 5 hours were nothing but torture.,Will discontinue taking the Niaspan.

411, 1, To lower LDL,Took 500mg twice a day with no problem for 14 days.  On day 15 while sitting at work at my desk my entire head suddenly became burning hot and prickly throughout.  I thought I was having a stroke.  A co-worker saw me and said I must have been using a sun lamp too long.  I walked into the bathroom and saw that my head_ face and chest were BEET color.  I drove directly to the ER_ about 5 minutes away.  They took me back into a room immediately - no waiting.  By this time I was beet-colored all over_ except the palms and my hands and soles of my feet.  They assumed it was a severe allergic reaction to something I inhaled (perfume_ paint???) and gave me a shot of prednisone and one of benadryl.  The beet color subsided over the next hour.  I did not suspect the Naispan because I had been on it for 2 weeks without reaction.  Today_ Sunday_ I did not go go work.  A few hours after taking my morning dose of Niaspan I noticed that my neck and upper chest were red.  I then researched the plasma,"USERS BEWARE: The insert pamphlet for Niaspan says ""Take this medication by mouth with a low-fat meal or snack_ usually at bedtime or as directed by your doctor.  Taking niacin on an empty stomach increases its side effects (eg._ flushing_ upset stomach.)""  Take it with a low-fat meal at bedtime???  Who eats a meal at bedtime?  Nevertheless_ it seems that the dual objects here are to take it at bedtime so that the flushing occurs while you are asleep_ and take it with a meal to slow absorption so as to reduce flushing and upset stomach.  The obvious problem is that very few people will eat the meal at bedtime_ so the dual objective will not be obtained_ and some people_ like me_ will have therefore have adverse reactions.  The fact that the adverse reaction can occur at any time_ regardless of how long you've taken the drug_ indicates to me that a variety of other factors in your life can directly influence whether you will suddenly have a severe adverse reaction.

Main side-effect that I have experienced immediately after taking niaspan is some flushing and upset stomach at night.  Also noticed that I am experiencing major anxiety and racing heart during the day_ just after starting to take niaspan again.  I had the same problem the last time I restarted niaspan.  When I tried to do some treadmill work yesterday_ I found that I was tired and had chest pressure so didn't do sustained jogging_ only brisk walking.,Unfortunately_ I have not seen any decrease in my triglycerides when I took niaspan last year.

More worrisome is I am also now experiencing some numbness in my hands and some sensitivity to pressure on the bottom of my feet when walking or jogging_ so I am going to discontinue usage of this medication for a while and see if these symptoms are caused by the Niaspan.  My blood pressure has also dropped about 20 points_ which may explain the other symptoms.,Niaspan doubled my HDL reading from 20 to 40 in 3 months_ and lowered my total cholesteral from about 200 to 170_ though my triglycerides actually went up from about 170 to 200.,M,55,4  months,1/30/2008,Niaspan

It came and went in waves at first and then stayed constant.  My skin felt very tight.  It started at the top of my head and continued over my entire body. I couldn't sit without pain.  I couldn't stand clothing on my skin or to touch my skin anywhere.  I had been having joint and muscle soreness I thought was from overwork and/or stress.  I had insomnia and restless sleep.  I felt anxiety and had vague headaches.  I was on this drug for just 5 days short of a month and was about to increase the dosage as per my MD_ when this happened.  It continued for over 3 hours.  All this has stopped now that I have stopped taking this drug.,I am a nurse and expected some flushing.  I was not informed that anything worse could happen.

435, 4, hyperlipidemia_ low HDL_ coronary d,Intense burning of skin_ redness  preceded by_ or followed by intense itching in large areas in various parts of the body.  At first_ these symptoms were consistent_ usually 1-3 hours after a 500mg. dose.  But I put up with these side effects_ because I had severe muscle weakness and pain with several statins. Started Niaspan after I stopped Lipitor in 2003. Since upping the dose to 1000mg twice a day_ I get occasional flushes once or twice a week. More distressing is a new set of symptoms I have had 4 times in the last three months.  It typically starts early in the day with a chill with shivering (without fever)_ cold hands (sometimes hands and feet)_ nausea and dry-heaves vomiting.  On each of those occasions I had some chocolate the night before  not unusual_ I am a chocoholic_ have at least a taste of it every day.  However_ after reading this survey I'm considering giving it up.  I plan to cut the dose to 1500mg. a day.,At first I thought the flushes were intolerable.  But I was assured my body would adjust to it.  Besides_ the statin alternative has no appeal.  For me_ the myositis is predictable.  I have had no muscle weakness or pain since starting Niaspan.  Apparently individuals react differently to Niaspan. But if you drink alcohol_ the flush is a certainty.

Associated with occasional pins and needles feeling on back. Occurred at one month on 2000 mg after gradually approached from 500 mg started 2 months ago. My glucose also suddenly went from averaging 137 to a highest-ever at 196 repeated 15 minutes later to 188! Now taking cortico-steroid pills for 3 days and cream topical treatment which don't seem to be having much efect. Need blood tests to check current status and safety and seeking best advice. Except for this rash and occasional short periods of typical discomfort_ the efects have been bearable with a warm persisting glow and a feeling of immune system reaction to healthy feeling of resistance to colds_infections_ etc which go away quickly. Rash started like a mosquito bite with bump that itched. I scratched and it spread to red dots_ inflamed,Having been overindulging in food_etc during this holiday season may have contributed to the current conditions. Would like to continue-to achieve higher HDL objective_ since otherwise have been very healthy and active. Any professional recommendations and related experiences would be appreciated.

Took a 500mg dose at bedtime with shaved ham and mustard on whole wheat.  Woke up @ 1:30 am with SEVERE flushing_ weakness and dizziness_ could barely walk and dropped to my knees trying to get back to bed.  Have not taken any since then (12/18/07) Too unpredictable. Weird.,Discontinued for now until I can see my dr later this month.  Currently taking Omega-3 fish oil (2000mg daily) until then.,F,45,24  days,12/23/2007,Niaspan

I felt as if someone was pin-pricking my entire body.  Felt very hot and flushed.,The side effects came after taking Niaspan for approximately three and one half months.

443, 1, High Triglycerides and Low HDL,I have been taking this medication for 3 weeks and experienced horrible side effects on 3 occasions. On the 2nd of December_ after taking the Niaspan_ the burning began about two hours later but things went from bad to worse.  I began to throw up_ profusely sweat_ shake and ended up passing out for a few minutes...went into a  seizure according to a witness.  After paramedics arrived_ I was taken to the E/R and had to undergo a multitude of tests_ including a CAT scan.  Those around me when this happened_ the seizing_ thought I had died initially.  I spent 8 hours in the E/R_ underwent a whole bunch of tests and was told to cease taking Niaspan.  This medication is HORRIBLE.,PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION........,M,50,3  weeks,12/3/2007,Niaspan
444, 2, cholesterol,Normal flushing. However_ also experienced moderate to severe shoulder area pain and weakness. Didn't relate Niaspan to it_ rather thinking it was from exercise. When the pain didn't abate even though taking NSAIDS and Ibuprofen_ looked up side effects on web and found myalgia a rare but significant side effect of Niaspan. Quit taking Niaspan and shoulders improved rather quickly.,,M,63,6  weeks,12/2/2007,Niaspan
445, 2, Raise good cholesterol,Been on it for 1 week. Took 500mg this morning after shower_ within 30 minutes it started on my head and face. Severe burning. I thought maybe my new shaving cream was doing it. But it moved down my arms and chest. I had heard that Niaspan does have side effects_ so I got on Internet. UNBELIEVABLE - every web site - everyone says the same thing - only 1 side effect - Sunburn - radiation burn - It was great to know I wasn't alone. Already feeling better just knowing. Hope it goes away soon - its the middle of winter and I'm running around with shirt. Feels like 90 degrees in the house.,,M,50,7  days,12/2/2007,Niaspan
446, 5, High LDL and low HDL,I take 2000mg at night just as I am ready to go to sleep.  I have a light flushing but nothing to complain about.  If I get up duing the night_ there is more flushing.,I have had great results.  My total cholosteral has gone from 235 to 148 and my LDLs went from 120 to 50.  I am also taking 5mg of Crestor.  I tried everything to bring down my LDLs naturally and was unable to a significant difference.  I think that taking Niaspan during the day would be extreemly uncomfortable.  At night I am not moving around much and it seems that movement is what can cause a big flush like an itchy hotflash.,F,59,120  days,12/1/2007,Niaspan

The overall feeling is god awful so be prepared to experience fear.,As of now_ I have not had any lab work since the change to Niaspan.  I will take this one day at a time.  Having had two heart attacks_ the onset of rapid and irregular heartbeats because of this medication is not at all comforting. I will_ as some of you have suggested_ take an aspirin 30 minutes prior to taking this medication.  For the record_ my doctor prescribed Niaspan but failed to tell me of any potential side effects..no mention period.  SURPRISE_ I guess...,M,51,5  weeks,11/29/2007,Niaspan

458, 2, Cholesterol,"I agree with others.  Flushing is not a proper term for the side effects.  A feeling of ""BURNING IN THE PITS OF HELL"" would be more appropriate.  I've been on this medication for about 2 weeks.  Took a naproxin tablet 1/2 hour before and ate with a lowfat snack (usually apple).  Sometimes the burning and itching wouldn't be as severe but last time felt like I was going to throw up and faint and was red from head to toe.  I also found I was more irritable and had pain in the legs all of the time.  With reactions this severe I will discontinue this medication.  Especially after reading about others who have been on this med. for a long time and still experiencing side effects.",Haven't had any tests to indicated wether this has worked or not.

This was with the 500mg tablet for 4 weeks and then two 500mg tablets until the prescription finished.The night I took my first 1000mg tablet I had a strange flushing sensation on my chest and neck but it went away without needing to wake all the way up and cool off.  Within hours I was experiencing itching on my chest and neck.  My chest was red like a sunburn or a rash and was extremely itchy.  The next night I took one 500mg (had one left) because the doctor's office wasn't open.  The next day I was able to reach the doctor and was told to stop taking the medication.,With the side effects being pretty standard_ they shouldn't be using full prescriptions.

I thought it was my laundry detergent_ so I rewashed all my clothes in a new detergent. The rash went away and I attributed it to the new detergent_ but then it came back. I saw my doctor a couple of weeks ago and he told me that most patients do not stay on the drug very long because of these side effects. He told me stop taking it. I still feel a little tingly_ but that could be the Zetia.,M,43,1  years,10/13/2007,Niaspan

My BP would be normal the next morning but I was totally exhausted while taking this medication- I am attributing that side effect to the fluctuation in BP.  I also had mild flushing that disappeared after 1 hr or so.  I tried this medication 3 different times for approximately 1 wk each time.,I cannot take statins so I was hoping for great results on this medication.

475, 1, To lower cholesterol,"I took 500 mg daily for 2 weeks as suggested by my doctor_ then was supposed to increase to 1000 mg.  However_ flushing and itching was intolerable_ so dropped back to 500 mg along with 81 mg coated aspirin and yogurt.  Flushing continued intermittently but was tolerable.  I did develop mild ""eczema"" on the back of one hand for which two dermatologists prescribed steroid creams and moisturizing lotion.  Blood numbers did improve after 6 months on Niaspan.  However_ shortly after that blood test_ I developed more severe ""eczema"" that did not respond to steroid creams (even the strongest) and then developed itchy lesions on my legs_ arms_ and recently torso.  Thinking that these lesions might be related to one of the three drugs I was taking_ I stopped taking Niaspan for a month or so_ with little improvement in the lesions but at least no new ones formed.  My conclusion was that Niaspan probably was not the cause_ so just recently resumed taking it.  Now new lesions",I will try other methods to reduce cholesterol -- Niaspan is certainly not worth the discomfort (and possible liver disease??),M,66,6  months,8/23/2007,Niaspan

That's a 50% reduction on average.Statins never provided those results in my 16 years of dealing with high cholesterol. And I hated the side effects of statins.I'm currently taking 3000 mg a day. Start out slow so your body gets use to them. like 500 mg for 4 weeks_ then 1000 mg for 4 weeks_ etc.  I started out on 1000 mg a day and bumped it up to 2000 mg 4 weeks later_ and 3000 mg 4 weeks after that. I tollerate Niaspan just fine with little flushing.  Ideally_ you want to be taking 2000 mg a day at bedtime.

Flushing SCARY the first time_ or if you are NOT warned adequetely. Goes away quickly.,Random flushing events once a month maybe less.  Once you know what to expect_ no worries.  First time_ you might think you need to to ambulance.  Started for me_ as burning deep from groin area_ then spreading_ sometimes_ tingling redness all over.Random episodes last 15-45 minutes_ only occur (after 3 years now) about once every 6-12 weeks_ pr about 4-8 /yr.  Price for medication is HIGH considering it is B3 time release. Silver lining is that THIS medication is actually natural_ VS many of the other pills. IF higher HDL helps don't be afraid to gove this a try (ha_ if you have prescription coverage). IF you want to test it out (buy 100mg Niacin generic)_ take one..you shoul dget the flush...once you know what to expect_ its minor annoyance.  IF I awake_ at night_ I sit in chair for 30 minutes_ it stops_ go back to bed. Small cost a few times a year_ for large benefit.  Some also think B3 was good for you_ BEFORE all this HDL hype.,M,48,3  years,1/4/2007,Niaspan

That was followed by approx. 72 hours of itchy skin (mostly arms and legs) that became VERY unfortable at times and I could find no relief.  Since I started the med. (now at 1000 mg) I have had the burn 3-4 times accompanied by the utching afterwards.  The burn is uncomfortable.  The itching pushed me to the edge a few times where I conisdered discontinuing the medication.,After 6 weeks_ HDL went from 31 to 40 - big improvement.

I had been using an over-the-counter niacin_ Slo-Niacin and getting good results by taking brief doseages and building up to 1500mg a day with excellent results. He insisted that it didn't work [wrong] as well as Niaspan_ a hefty price-tag prescription_ and suggested 1_000mg a day. Terrible stuff. He didn't even know how to take it. Nobody should take 1_000mg at a single dose_ and even at divided doses_ it didn't do any better_ and somewhat worse than the otc niacin. I threw the stuff away and returned to the otc version which worked better anyway and had fewer side-effects.,This is a pharmaceutical company rip-off. There are many brands of otc niacin that work better and are safer to take. Most doctors I've talked to know about zip when it comes to doseage and build-up when a patient is introduced to it. Wouldn't take Niaspan if it was free. It's harsh on the liver when taken in large doses_ and for some people_ even 500mg is too much_ esp. if you're taking other drugs_ i.e. statins.,M,54,30  days,7/1/2006,Niaspan

Then the fire spread to the rest of my head_ down my neck_ into my chest and arms!!! Heart rate went sky high. Naturally anxiety followed these events as the doctor never mentioned that any of this would be possible. I called the on call doctor and was told to take an aspirin and the symptoms would get better in about half an hour. Surprisingly enough_ that was 25 minutes ago and the burning is decreasing and the heart rate is coming down. I would have liked to have known that this was a possible side effect_ instead of finding it out in the middle of the night. Note_ as I type this_ I am experiencing a semi-numbness to my hands.

After about a week or so I started getting the burning_ stinging_ warm feeling from my head down to my legs. I also had diarrhea for about two weeks. The side effects were much worse when I was on 2000MG's a day.  I was down graded to 1000MG's daily and the side effects have calmed down some.  I also could not sleep at night_ while I was on 2000MG's a day_ the burning would wake me up.  The burning usually lasts 2-3 hours for me.,My Dr. never told me I could take a baby aspiren or ibuprofen half hour before taking Niaspan.  I now_ after 1.2 months_ take 1 200MG tablet of Ibuprofen half hour before I take Niaspan it has taken about 90-95% of the burning_ stinging_ warm feeling away.

Episodes typically start 4-5 hours after a 1000mg dose_ these effects are very uncomfortable and make sleep impossible for hours.","Labs done at the 60 day point indicated HDL had improved slightly_ to 36 from 29.  Given the relatively benign descriptions of ""flushing"" and ""itching"" in the prescribing literature and the educational (sales) material provided by drug sales reps_ my physicians have been surprised at descriptions of the intensity of the burning/itching.At physician suggestion_ additional aspirin (2X325mg) taken after onset of side effects resulted in minor reduction in burning and itching and seems to shorten duration of the episode. Antipruritics_ topical cold packs_ and cool showers have been ineffective in reducing or eliminating these effects.",M,58,80  days,3/18/2006,Niaspan

Woke up after 7 hours sleep_ drank a glass of water and within 10 minutes of being awake I started turning beet red_ skin was raised_ tight_ bumpy and looked like I had the worst sunburn you could have. This was all over my body and face. Then the tingly feeling started. Then within a few minutes it felt like I was on fire_ from the inside. So painful that I was in tears. My tongue started swelling_ as did my face and arms_ my heart was racing and I was scared to death. I took benadryl to counteract but it only stopped the swelling. The major side effects lasted over 2 hours. It was the most awful experience I have ever had with a drug.,I will not be taking this again. I will try raising my HDL other ways.

595, 3, High Triglycerides,None after 1 week. During the first week though I experienced the full range of side-effects. Flushing_ which went away by taking some advil before the Niacin. One night I woke with a racing heart_ flushing_ then after getting up and walking around felt nausiated and finaly fainted. That kind of scared me. That was the only episode and all side effects went away after about a week. After 2 weeks I stopped taking the Advil and didn't experience any adverse effects after that_ including flushing.,After 90 days I didn't show any signs of significant improvement so I stopped taking it. I was on 500mg_ maybe a higher dose would have helped. Being an over the counter product_ affordable_ and no real side effects (at least AFTER the first week)_ this may be a good treatment for some people. Just not me. After this I tried Tricor_ and after 8 days begged the Dr. to try a higher dose of Niacin as I couldn't deal with the side-effects with Tricor. Ended up with Lipitor and so far so good_ but will have to wait another 60 days before I know what my numbers are.,M,30,90  days,2/9/2006,Niaspan
596, 4, low HDL,Have used it for ~ 5 years (1000mg) with little adverse affects other than occasional (1/month) itching/burning/rash-like reaction (lasting 1/2-1hr) reported by many others. Trying to figure out why sometimes get rash and most other times do not -- up to 8-10 hrs after taking the drug.  I think it is due to eating spicy (capasin is causative ingredient I believe) food for dinner the night before.  My guess is that both it and Niaspan tend to become synergetic in vasal dilation_ but I have not seen anybody else report this relationship.This has become a bit more of a problem since I stopped taking 81 mg aspirin with it (I now take Plavix rather than aspirin).,,M,61,5  years,1/23/2006,Niaspan
