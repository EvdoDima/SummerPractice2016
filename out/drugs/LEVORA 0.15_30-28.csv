2, 1, Birth control,I always felt like a swollen tick_ I was tired all the time_ grumpy and always arguing with my fianceÃÅ. This is the first time I have ever been on birth control and it was the worst experience ever. I stopped taking it today and feel so much better.,I was having headaches every day. I felt like I couldn't move or have the energy to get out of bed. I didn't want to do anything and I was never satisfied with anything. Just over all horrible.,F,26,1  weeks,4/26/2016,Levora 0.15/30-28
3, 3, Irregular period,The first packet didn't give me any symptoms but the first pill I took from the second packet (2nd month) gave me dizzy spell waking up. I tried staying on the pill for few days but my doc advised me to stop it to see if I will get rid of the dizziness. The first morning pf stopping the pill the dizziness has lessened_ it's still there but it wasn't as bad as before. I think it will take time to recover...,,F,33,1  months0.15,10/19/2015,Levora 0.15/30-28
4, 2, Regulate my periods,Over sleeping_ headaches when awake_ super moody!,I am on my 3rd week of levora and these past 2 weeks I have been wanting to do nothing but sleep and when I'm awake I just have a horrible headache and I won't take anything for it. Also_ I argue with my boyfriend or cause a fight with him over nothing lately and I've been super stressed and depressed over it. This is my first time back on birth control since everything else I've tried I've had horrible reactions to. This is the first time trying the pill and I don't really like it much. I can say I'm thankful that I haven't bled at all yet_ but that kind've worries me after some of the reviews I've read.,F,20,3  weeks,8/31/2015Email,Levora 0.15/30-28
5, 1, To regulate my periods,I did fine the first few weeks. After 2 weeks on the pill_ my period began. It has not stopped 18 days later. Increased blood pressure_ so the doctor took me off this medication and will start a different type of bc.,Would not recommend this bc to anyone.,F,34,1  months,8/19/2015,Levora 0.15/30-28
6, 2, Birth control,Fatigue_ anxiety_ dry_ painful intercourse_ lack of sex drive,I took this pill for 8 years. No weight gain and breasts remained the same.  I had no problems for years but as I grew older I realized my body changing. I developed GAD whether it was from this pill though I'm not sure. I was also constantly tired and had no motivation to do anything. Sex also became painful because this pill made me so dry. Didnt matter though since I had no sex drive anyway. It was interfering with my relationship. Why take a pill for birth control if you don't want to have sex? I switched pills and my drive is back. Had breakthrough bleeding while taking Zenchent so now I'm trying another pill,F,25,8  days30 mg,8/16/2015,Levora 0.15/30-28

10, 5, avoid pregnancy,No bad side effects at all. Only the good side effects of lighter_ regular periods with no cramps. Was awesome. I only stopped it because I haven't been sexually active and figured maybe I'd see what it's like to not be on it for now. Bad idea! My cramps are back and I never know when my period is coming.,Don't understand how others are having side effects but it shows me that everyone's bodies are different.,F,35,3  years.15/30,1/10/2015,Levora 0.15/30-28
11, 2, painful_ heavy periods. birth contr,I had anxiety when I first began taking this medication - to the point where I made an appointment with a therapist because I couldn't figure out what was wrong. The anxiety went away after a few weeks and I did alright up until recently. I've been under stress and now I'm having the same feelings of anxiety_ even more intensely. I have never had anxiety until being on this pill. Also_ my libido has become very low. I'm definitely stopping this pill_ even if I have to face my painful periods. :(,,F,29,8  months0.15/30 1X D,12/10/2014,Levora 0.15/30-28

17, 1, Prevent ovarian cysts & pregnancy,"From day 1 I have been constantly spotting_ never a day where I do not bleed_ even just a little bit. ""Breakthrough"" bleeding as the doctor and PA have called it. I also have noticed I am extremely fatigued_ no matter if I get a full 8 hours of sleep at night_ I am exhausted whenever I wake up in the morning. I also have nausea_ bloating_ and bad cramping. The doctor has recommended me to not take the placebo pills_ aka withdrawal pills_ he is looking to stop my period to see if it will stop the cysts from arising. I have not been back to see him_ but have made several phone calls and him and his PA have both assured me that I need to take it for a full three months to get the full benefit of the birth control. After bleeding for almost two months straight_ I am pretty much SICK AND TIRED of this. I have considered changing OB's and getting another doctors opinion. Before this_ I was not on any kind of birth control due to the severe side effects I had while I had the Mirena.",,F,24,6  weeks 1X D,3/4/2014Email,Levora 0.15/30-28

20, 5, Prescribed to me by doctor as request,I like it and my breasts have grown a cup and a half since and its only been 2 weeks. I take it at 10pm at night so I go right to bed so I never have any nausea or any like that. No mood swings really maybe I get teary eyed over sad things but I don't know if that just me or the pill so I can't blame the pill.  So far so good_ but everyone is different. I would let you know you should take your pill at night before bed. good luck to all of you! :),,F,31,2  weeks 1X D,9/22/2013Email,Levora 0.15/30-28

However the worst effect was the anxiety after maybe 5 months of taking this pill i started finding myself worrying sick about the most meaningless things.. it was so bad that i would start hyperventilating_ my chest would hurt i would think i was having a heart attack and rush into the ER (keep in mind im a healthy_ active 24 year old) after 3 ER visits in 1.5 months i knew something was wrong_ I finally got off the pill and its been a month since i stopped_ im still anxious and worrying about stupid things sometimes but I can tell myself is just in my mind and I am able to relax_ i have started to feel a lot better and I know it was levora that made me feel that way.,F,24,11  months 1X D,4/18/2011Email,Levora 0.15/30-28

It has been great as far as keeping mood swings from happening and I haven't gotten pregnant. I occasionally get mild acne but I have combination skin as it is so it could just be me. Weight gain was pretty expected and it was only a couple pounds.. no big deal. I would definitely reccommend Levora to others.

I had been on Ortho Tri Cyclen for a couple of years with no problems_ but then started having a lot of break-through bleeding during my third week_ resulting in a prolonged_ unpredictable period.  For the first few months_ Levora was great.  My periods were very regular and not too heavy.  However_ after a few months_ I noticed that I was more irritable_ depressed and anxious.  Also_ I lost all the ""clear skin"" benefits I had experienced with Tri-Cyclen.  I went off the pill entirely for a few months and all my symptoms went away and my skin even cleared up a bit.  Levora may work fine for a lot of people_ but if you experience any symptoms of depression or anxiety_ please talk to your doctor.",F,28,6  months,2/21/2007,Levora 0.15/30-28
52, 4, BC and controling problem periods,during the first three months i had a few headaches and moodiness during week one_ but once my body adjusted i was fine.,levora was my first experience with hormonal birth control_ and i loved it.  for the most part_ i could predict my period within a few hours of arrival (though that changed slightly after about 18 months) and i found my periods to be much lighter_ though not tons shorter - they lasted about a week_ though the last few days were merely spotting.  i eventually went off this pill because it stopped helping with my bad period symptoms (bleeding became heavier and longer_ with terrible cramps) but it seems that my body just got used to it after years of use.  for the majority of the time on this pill_ i was very happy with the results.,F,19,2  years,1/18/2007,Levora 0.15/30-28
