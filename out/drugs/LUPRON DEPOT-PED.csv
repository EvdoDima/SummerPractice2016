0, 1, Endo,EXTREME FATIGUE! NO SEX DRIVE!!! MIGRAINES!!!! VERY IRRITABLE_ SOMETIMES SLOW AND GARGLED SPEECH.  I AM HALF WAY THROUGH_ AND I CANNOT WAIT TO BE DONE WITH THIS.  The only reason I continue to take the injections is b/c I really want to have a baby and I want my endo to be cleared up.  I am getting married in October and hankfully I have a VERY understanding fiance'!   I just know that I will be fertile after the shots are over with and ready to have a child.  This is my only hope! This is the ONLY reason i continue to endure the miserable side effects. Well_ It's almost over! I pray everyday!,,F,29,3  months,7/31/2007Email,Lupron depot-ped
1, 1, Endometriosis,Horrible hot flashes_ severe headaches_ trouble sleeping_ depression and anxiety_ weight gain_ no sex drive.,During the three months I was on Lupron I experienced horrible side affects. The doctor told me they would significantly improve after the first month_ however after three months things were still very bad. The effects of Lupron made it very hard for me to get through everyday activities. Rather then forgoing the full 6 months of the drug that was suggested by my doctor_ I ended my treatment at 3. I still have pain from the endometriosis but I would much rather deal with that as opposed to still be experiencing the side effects of Lupron.,F,21,3  months,7/10/2007,Lupron depot-ped
