0, 4, ibs-c,diarrhea_ mild cramps,"I had awful abdominal pain due to ""trapped gas"" & incomplete evacuation. I ended up in ER; CTscan turned up no impaction or anything. A nurse tried an enema which didn't work. Finally I was given lactulose & that did it. / Since that trying time (4 mths ago)I discovered peppermint oil caps relieve pain but if I ever get that screwed up again I'll know what to ask for.",M,58,1  days30 mg 1X D,6/30/2010,Laxilose
1, 1, Bowel Obstruction/constipated,Within 10 minutes of taking my first dose (1TBSP) I started to feel 'off'. I began to feel weak_ dizzy and spaced out. I tried looking for the 'severe side effects' for this medication because it really was begining to feel as if I was getting a real buzz from it_ which was not becoming a pleasant experience.Finally after about 20 searches_ I found a site that said: If you experience dizzyness_ trouble swallowing_ lack of muscle strength_ coordination and rash_ go to the hospital immediately.Which is exactly what happened!Rushed to the hospital - my throat began to close up_ had trouble breathing_ bp dropped_ my mouth and face muscles began to involuntarily pucker up_ and I almost fainted several times. I had a rash that went from the top of my neck to the bottom of my stomach and also on my hands and chest. It was hell!Apparently I was having quite a serious allergic reaction to this medication_ and apparently it is rare. I don't have any other problems aside from hypothyr,If you feel anything 'funny' - don't take a chance and go to the hospital!,F,37,1  days,3/8/2006,Laxilose
