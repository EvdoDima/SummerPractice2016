1, 5, To lower my blood sugar,The only side effects I've expirenced is blood sugar lows. I'm on a sliding scale and use different amounts depending on my blood sugar levels. I have to be very careful and sometimes snack after use to prevent lows. This product works very well for lowering blood sugar for people with diabetes. It has worked very well for me.,I use humulin to cover my meals along with a 24 hour insulin and combined I've achieved very good control of my blood sugar. Humulin is my bolus insulin to cover food. I use another for my basil. Humulin has been very good in correcting my blood sugar.,F,41,6  daysSliding 3X D,11/14/2010,Humulin r
2, 3, Type 1 Diabetes,Constant Hunger_ Weight Gain_ Lethargic,"Prior to being switched to Humulin R_ I was an active_ vigorous man_ that didn't need to eat much.  I developed an allergy to the binding agents used in all other forms of insulin and had no choice but to switch to this. So it is saving my life_ but being told by the doctor that hunger is a side affect and to get used to is not making me a happy person.  I was 5'9"" 125lbs_ 3 years later I am 185 lbs_ I can't keep gaining 20 lbs per year.",M,37,3  years 1X D,6/16/2010,Humulin r
