3, 2, Sinus tachycardia,I use due to tachycardia since age 19. My bp & heart tests all normal & no explanation for why my heart races. I don't like beta blockers_ I've been on & off these for 30 yrs so I take them only when my heart feels very uncomfortable which can be as slow as 90 bpm. I asked my cardiologist if it can be used like that & he said no that it should be taken daily or risk an arrhythmia but it saps my energy so I still do it that way.,Not many other meds will slow heart rate so I put up with it but don't take every day,F,55,1  months50 mg,3/9/2016Email,Atenolol

5, 4, High blood pressure_ anxiety,Only thing I noticed is some food items taste different,Some weight loss_ lack of appetite.  My heart doesn't race and I don't get all the issues thatccome from anxiety since being on atenolol. I didn't think it would work since my high blood pressure and high heart rate was from anxiety but it really helps!  I would give a 5 rating but I don't know yet how much it has helped by numbers_ as I go to the Dr Tuesday. Give it a try_ I was very skeptical. I had been on propanolol and it didn't work for me at all before I was prescribed atenolol.,F,37,1  months25mg,1/14/2016,Atenolol

I feel like a supermarket trolley with a wonky wheel when I walk. Constant dull headache too. Didn't want to go on this drug but a new and enthusiastic doctor has decided to change my diagnosis from trigeminal neuralgia_ to facial migraine_ and take me off my anti convulsant and on to a betablocker as a result.

12, 2, sinoid Ventricular Tachycardia,Weight gain I stopped talking it and was on it a year when I was 26..  I thought I had a heart attack ended up in ER on a business trip_ wore a holter for a month- they found abnormal P waves on the EKG..

13, 4, Tachycardia,None,I had been feeling tired for a while and had started to be unable to do everyday activities like walking up the stairs without stopping to catch my breath. Initially I believed it was down to a condition I have called pernicious anemia however turns out it wasn't. At the gym I had noticed that I would be on the treadmill walking and easily have a heart rate of 190 which is odd as I am only young and quite fit. I thought nothing really of it until I went the doctors and was put on a heart monitor the doctor was terrified as my resting heart rate was 150 so he called an ambulance which made me worse. After many tests turns out I have a sinus tachycardia most probably due to a faulty sinus in the heart it can start to show  in women in there 20s. When the doctor put me in atenol my main concern was weight gain I was not happy at all that everyone was saying it makes you gain weight. What a load of rubbish that is there obviously older people who are not as active if anything I have lost weight. Since starting atenolol my heart no longer races and I can walk up the stairs without stopping for breath I have had no symptoms so far. If any young women or men have been prescribed this for tachycardia please ignore the negative comments about weight gain if your quite active I cannot see how this medication would effect your weight_ it would only slow down your heart rate to a normal rate which others have.,F,24,1  days25,11/1/2015,Atenolol

21, 4, Chest pain_ HBP,Initially brain-fogged zombie_ fatigue_ breathlessness_ a different sort of strange and sometimes alarming heart sensation with fullness in neck. It helped with my anxiety (a happy side-effect). Some weight gain_ lethargy. The brain fog and new heart weirdness decreased over time_ although the feeling of fullness in neck continued_ and I still felt very tired and emotionally flat - a functional zombie_ and somewhat breathless on exertion. My dreams felt strange and alien_ as though they belonged to someone else_ but my sleep generally improved because I felt less anxious.,Atenolol lowered my blood pressure and helped with the original chest pains_ which may have been caused by my chronic anxiety; it definitely helped with that but wasn't prescribed for anxiety. Am on my second attempt to come off the drug - it's quite tough_ even though 25mg/day is a low dose. The side effects seemed tolerable at first_ compared to how I'd been feeling before_ so overall I think Atenolol has been helpful. Now I'm not sure I still need it and the only way to find out is to get off it!

24, 4, To lower my blood pressure,At first my dosage was 50 mg of Atenolol twice a day.  My pulse dropped to 50 from 70 plus and I was sleeping 14 hours a day.  I stopped taking any high blood pressure medication after my eye infected with what looked like a stye_ my nose started bleeding and my chest filled with mucus and infected.  I ended up in the ER room and then my private physician sent me to see an eye specialist suspecting an infection of shingles in my left eye.  My blood pressure was 236/105 with a pulse in the 50's.  My cardiologist re-started me on Benicar 40 mg with 12.5 mg of HCT.. and gave me this prescription to replace the Atenolol.  I asked a friend who had a different cardiologist or heart specialist and she told me she was taking the exact same dose of Benicar HCT with Atenolol_ but with a reduced dosage_ 50 mg per day of Atenolol.  I took the 50 mg pills and cut them in half and now take my dosage of Levoxyl on an empty stomach with the Benicar - HCT 40 plus 12.5..

On the last antidepressant I was tried on_ Vivactil (a tricyclic NRI)_ I noticed intolerable dizziness and rapid heart rate. My pulse was 120-130bpm at rest. My physician gave me a prescription for Atenolol 25mg/day. It seemed to keep things under control and lowered my heart rate to around 90-100bpm (which was not nearly as uncomfortable). I noticed that it seemed to wear off in the late hours and that excessive caffeine would cause my pulse to raise to uncomfortable levels even while taking Atenolol. Weaning off of this medication is very hard_ and there is rebound effects. I have tried weaning off because I have heard alot about it causing low libido_ apathy_ lethargy_ etc. This is unacceptable_ and exactly what I am trying to TREAT. Right now I am at 12.5mg of Atenolol/day and am off of the Vivactil. My pulse is in the mid 80's.

Two days later I was so violently dizzy_ I literally could not stand up.  I managed to get to the Atenolol and take one which helped.  I then slowly tried to wean myself off of them.  I thought I had managed and had been off for three days when my heart started acting so bizarre that I was literally crying and I took an Atenolol.

I do mind the annoyance of monthly checkups and blood tests but it.s a small price to pay as a sudden heart attack with no previous history is what killed my father at 53.

First I was taking 25 mg of atenolol and it brought me down to around 155/100. Doc doubled me up to 50 mg and the first day my heart rate was 45 bpm. That was rough. Now after a few weeks I'm feeling better_ bp is more like 135/85_ heart rate usually around 58 or so. I have a desk job_ in the mornings with atenolol I'm often light headed when I stand up. When I work out_ it takes a long time to warm up_ and I have to really fight it. But if I push long and hard enough_ I'm amazed at how much energy and stamina I have. I like to do wind sprints. With atenolol I start out at a jog and get out of breath after a few hundred feet. Then I walk_ and then jog again. Finally after about 20 minutes_ I can sprint at high speed for a couple of hundred meters or so.I've doubled up on my weekly hours of working out also_ and that seems nearly as good as the pills for bringing down the pre,M,51,3  weeks,5/30/2008,Atenolol

It completely changed my personality_ to the point where family members barely recognized me sometimes.  I was always tired_ I'd get angry and the stupidest stuff.  I couldn't get my heart rate above 120bpm_ which made it impossible for me to run.  I also didn't want to talk to anyone_ and I'd go out of my way to avoid conversations with anyone_ including my wife.  All that and it didn't really lower my blood pressure much at all.  After about four months_ my doc changed me over to Diovan HCT 80/12.5.  The transformation was amazing.  Within one day of stopping this awful drug_ I was back to my normal self.  I felt good again_ the depression lifted and I spent more time talking to my wife in that one morning than I did the entire time I was on Atenolol.
