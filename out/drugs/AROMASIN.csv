0, 1, Stage I/II Breast Cancer,The oncologist first prescribed Arimidex_ which I only took for 4 months due to the severe joint pain.  I could barely get in and out of my car.  I was then prescribed Aromasin and tried it for about 18 months and the hip pain became so bad I could not sleep and my cholesterol was almost 300.   So I took a six month vacation from the drug.  My cholesterol is now well under 200 and the hip pain is almost gone.,While I understand that the first five years after a cancer diagnosis are very important_ if I continue to take this drug I will end up on a statin and pain medicine.   Taking those will only cause even more side effects.   I am talking with a naturopath to look for some alternative ways to prevent any future occurrence of cancer_ there has to be a better way than this drug.,F,62,2  years25mg 1X D,7/27/2016Email,Aromasin
1, 1, breast cancer,Hot flashes_  joint pain in hands sometimes so bad I could not use fingers which I need to do my job.  One elbow joint pain.  Bladder pain and pressure like an infection but it wasn't an infection.   Antibiotics did not help.,"This drug is horrible for me.  My oncologist is NOT happy I stopped it and refuse to try it again.  I felt like I had a bladder infection but antibiotics did not clear it up.  Since I work in a lab I did my own urine tests and could see I had bladder irritation signs but no infection.  About 3 weeks after stopping the drug the bladder symptoms  are gone.  My knuckles in my hand hurt badly and I have trouble using my fingers and they ""lock""up sometimes.  I also have one elbow that hurts.  I talked to my oncologist nurse today who said I can go back on the meds since I have been off them a month and the hand pain is NOT from aromasin.  I am still having hot flashes.  I believe the drug is out of my system but the side effects and damage the drug causes is not gone which is why the hot flashes and pain is still there.  I told the nurse I will not take anything until the pain is less.  I know my body and I know from another drug I took years ago it can take MONTHS to get over the side effects and damage from the drug.  I wonder if it worth trying something else.  I was given a 4% chance of cancer returning with the drug and 8% without.  I had a mastectomy and no chemo or radiation needed.",F,60,50  days25 mg 1X D,7/12/2016Email,Aromasin
2, 2, Stage 1& Stage 2_ Dbl Mast_Chemo tx,Mainly_ severe mood swings - depression and anger/rage_ severe pain on my knees causing difficulty to walk after getting up then pain goes away_ insomia_ weight gain.,My mom was placed on same medication for 5years and saw the same SE on her.  On a side note_ breast ca doesn't run on our family.  We are both BRCA neg. Knowing the SE_ I was mindful of what I am feeling and I try to control the SE as much as I can.  I keep myself busy most of the days so I don't feel depressed.  As for the anger/rage_ I identified my trigger sources and I try to avoid them as much as I can (not 100% successful).  I watch what I eat but I'm also not 100% successful on this category.  I have gained weight (and I thought it was due to chemo tx).  My onc have given me clonazepam to help me sleep and relax at night.  I also take tylenol (with codeine) to help with the pain.  My onc also told me he thinks I should be on this drug for 10years (vs 5yrs for my mom) bec new study came out showing better outcome for my stage of cancer to stay on it for 10years.  I try not to think about this.,F,46,5  months25 1X D,5/20/2016Email,Aromasin

But I first stayed off both for a month.  Joint pain is better but will see what this month will bring.  Back cracking is bizarre.  At least I don't look 90 when I walk.

Heard horrific things about Boniva. Had lumpectomy and radiation one breast. Why be miserable? My prognosis is very good without drugs. I'm active and exercise. Feel I made good decision and still at low risk.,Oncologists practice cookie cutter medicine. They have a drug to combat side effects for other drugs. Not happy with how I felt on aromasin.

15, 1, Intraductal Papilloma w/Dysplacia,Although I was not diagnosed with BC_ I'm high risk since my mom is a bc survivor.  I've been on this drug going on 9 months. At first I didn't notice really any side effects except fatigue and that was after about a month.  A couple months later I started developing insomnia; joint pain in wrists_ hips_ ankles and feet.  After about 4 months on this drug_ I developed trigger finger in both thumbs.  There were days where it became exceptionally painful to walk because the bottom of my feet felt like they were on fire.When I went for my follow-up to see my onc_ I told her about the se's and as many of you have already experienced_ my onc was very dismissive about my complaints which I resented.At first I wasn't having any issues with weight gain because I'm a T1 diabetic who carefully watches what I eat but suddenly in less than 1 months' time I've gained almost 14 lbs!  I'm also going through horrible mood swings to the point I'm either crying uncontrollably or I'm feeling something akin to 'roid rage' all within a span of a couple minutes.Between the sudden weight gain and the extreme mood swings I am going to see my onc and tell her I want off this drug.,As a Type 1 Diabetic I got very sick in Aug 2015 and didn't realize I was in Diabetic Ketoacidosis and that by the time I was in ICU I'd had 2 mild heart attacks.  My Diabetes is a bigger threat to me right now than the chance of bc plus I don't know why the onc would put me on this drug given I don't have bc but high risk.  I don't like this 'one size fits all approach'.  Sure glad to find this website and have the kind of validation I need to show my doctor this is not 'all in my head'.My best to each and every one of you.,F,56,9  months25 mg,12/6/2015,Aromasin

Doctors dismiss pain_ fatigue_ swelling with ""it's better than cancer"" type comments flavored with ""we all get such aches as we age."" All this in less than a year.

18, 2, 2 year breast cancer survivor,I am experiencing synovitis of the hip and wondered if there was a connection to the Aromasin?  Also_ I was on Anastrazole and switched 10 months ago to Aromasin d/t the severe hip and knee pain and my inability to sleep.  I do sleep better now but the pain in the hips and knees can still get pretty bad.    Also_ two months after starting Aromasin_ I developed carpal tunnel syndrome (never had it before).  One month later I had the surgery to release it and there was still mild nerve damage that has not reversed.,"I noticed that some people are taking a ""vacation"" from taking Aromasin.

20, 2, Stage 2 Breast Cancer,Hot flashes (not too bad though)_ bad bone/joint pain_ forgetfulness_ weight gain_ sugar craving_ acne and rash_ some insomnia.,I was on Arimidex for 5 months and had to stop because of extreme bone pain. Exemestane SE are very bad. When I first get up in the morning I am literally hobbling around! I can barely walk_ my ankles are so weak and painful. I have to hold the handrail carefully when going down stairs as one of my ankles has given out on me several times. Back pain so bad that just shifting in a chair can elicit gasps from the pain. Turning over in bed very painful. Ankles_ knees and hips make popping/cracking noises. As many others have said_ I'm 57 but feel 97. One of the worst is weight gain. After my surgery & chemo_ I watched what I ate and lost 15 pounds - docs told me weight was super important - but since being on the AIs I have gained 20+ pounds with no change in eating habits. Losing any weight takes going to 600 calories a day (pretty hard to maintain). Exercise is difficult with the bone pain. Am now taking a mini vacation from it_ after just 7 days off of it_ pain is 2/3 gone_ brain fog is lifting_ I have energy again. I wanted to see how much of what I was experiencing was from the drug. Turns out_ all of it. The doctors just don't seem to understand how this drug can wreck your quality of life. I don't want cancer again_ but have to decide if all this is worth it.

21, 3, Stage 2a Invasive Ductal Carcinoma,Extreme muscle and bone pain that could not be controlled at all with over the counter meds such as Tylenol_ Ibuprofen_ ASA. Prescribed Meds like Tylenol #3_ then Buscopan patch then trimodal provided some relief but not enough. I had all the other side effects listed_ it was a total nightmare for me. I have just quit 10 months short of five years. I just can not deal with it any longer.,I know it is important to complete your full treatment course on Aromasin but when it becomes so unbearable_ you really need to weigh the risks and side effects you have with the drug vs the expected percentage rates for survival by taking the drug. With a mastectomy and chem alone I was told 93% with the five years on Tamoxifen the first year and a half_ then Aromasin for the same I was told an additional 3% putting me up to 96%.

24, 1, Stage 1 Breast Cancer,I had taken Arimidex for 9 months and had increasing joint and muscle pain. I went off for a month and most side effects resolved. My oncologist switched me to Aromasin. In about 2 weeks the joint pain started coming back and then the swelling of hands_ feet plus tiredness. I am a nurse besides a patient and this is so uncomfortable. I am going to go off of this and won't even try Femora. I will give Tamoxifen a try in hopes the joint issues are not a problem. I am very active for my age_ have no other health issues and this drug has really affected the quality of my life. I have 4 more years of this type of treatment.

28, 4, Breast cancer with bone mets,I already have serious osteoarthritis_ but I'm not feeling worse on the Aromasin. The only side effect I seem to have is extreme insomnia_ which is a real problem.,Right now this drug is saving my life! After 9 cancer-free years following diagnosis and treatment of Stage IIb ILC in both breasts_ I have a recurrence with bone metastases and am now Stage IV with no cure. I took Tamoxifen for 3 years the first time around and had no problems. Then switched to Femara for the worst 6 months of my life. I lasted a week on Arimidex before finally returning to Tamoxifen for the rest of my 5 years.  So I started Aromasin 5 months ago with trepidation because of my past history with AI's. My only problem is bad insomnia that I keep trying to deal with. I also receive an injection once a month of Xgeva to strengthen bones and alleviate bone pain. That's probably shielding me from the bone pain others are experiencing. I am so grateful that this drug has decreased my tumor markers 75% in 5 months and gotten them well within normal range. Because of the Xgeva I actually have less arthritis pain_ too. Now if I could just sleep better...,F,67,5  months25mg,6/2/2015Email,Aromasin

Went off of it and in 3 weeks I felt like a NEW person. Fatigue was gone_ pain was gone_ I could finally sleep and I felt ALIVE again. They have now switched me to arimidix. Was was Femara for 4 months and it almost gave me a heart attack. So we will see how Arimidix works. I think these AI drugs will soon tell the tale of how horrible they are.

37, 3, hi estrogen on testosterone therapy,Fatigue and pain was a problem within 7 days of beginning 25mg daily. Brain fog_ loss of motivation_ stiffness_ and just generally not feeling like doing anything_ even easy daily tasks.,Taking this to lower my estrogen levels after 6 months on testosterone replacement therapy. Testosterone is converted into estrogen in the male body and with testosterone replacement it sometimes gets converted at a higher rate leading to very high estrogen levels which can cause many issues from water retention_ male breast development_ and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. 25mg per day dropped my estrogen to nearly zero. The body uses estrogen for many things_ and getting it super low can cause many problems. Severe joint and bone pain_ fatigue_ depression_ anxiety_ sexual dysfunction are some of them.  Fortunately_ my doctor was very knowledgeable and had me switch to 12.5mg per day. After a month_ I was still struggling_ but not as bad. Estrogen levels tested as still being too low although not as low as before. So next I was told to use 12.5mg every other day. That proved to be the right dosage as it allowed my estrogen levels to balance out in the normal range for a male. Unfortunately for breast cancer patients_ the goal is typically to get estrogen levels extremely low. I am not sure if it is the mechanism that the estrogen is lowered by with the drug_ or if it is an issue of too little estrogen in the body for other functions to remain normal. But for my situation_ once I got my estrogen levels in the normal range_ the side effects were barely noticeable_ compared to before when they made me feel incapacitated.,M,39,60  days12.5mg 1X O,12/14/2014,Aromasin

Oh_ and my favorite side effect?  I gained 30-35 pounds in a matter of months & CAN'T get it off!,I started taking the Aromatase Inhibitors in 2009. My docs tried to tell me that my bone-muscle-joint pain was because of my age (60s) and my weight. It was just ordinary arthritis they all said. Hogwash! I am so tired of doctors laying every health problem on my age or my weight when it is one or more of the drugs I am on. Here's how I know my symptoms are Aromasin drug-related: Every time I take an Aromasin Medication Vacation_ most of my Aromasin side effects go away. And_ I started on Arimdex and then Femara and had the SAME side effects. I stayed on Aromasin since there were no other options. I have not had a 1-month vacation from the Aromasin for 4 years_ but when I did_ my pain decreased. Since I reached my 5 years on this awful drug_ the choice is mine to stay on it or go off. I decided to take another vacation. Within a week_ my pain is nearly all gone and my other symptoms are also improving. I can't believe how much better I feel. I feel like I have my life back. I don't know if I will go back on Aromasin or not. What's the point of taking a drug that makes your daily life a hell? Not what I call a quality life.

The original side effects from Arimidex were nearly gone when I started Aromasin_ but it made the digestion problems start all over again: reflux_ burning_ bloating_ gas all the time_ smelly stools_ and loose stools. With this much discomfort and interference with my daily activities_ I stopped at one pill and will wait till symptoms improve and try again. If this does not work_ I am stopping altogether. My surgeon is wonderful and agreed with me that existing in misery in order to take a pill that may (or may not) help with a recurrence of cancer isn't much of a life. I'd rather be functional and enjoy life to the fullest than be miserable for five years taking a medicine that my body is clearly rejecting! It concerns me that this type of medicine may have long lasting effects on our bodies.

Ovaries_ Adrenal Glands and Fat Cells. I have removed my ovaries and I eat very well and exercise. I would rather live a quality life than one filled with pain. I'm mentally stable and love life. I've read so many cases of women who are taking these estrogen blockers and still have a recurrance. I took femara and by the 4th day I couldn't straighten out my left middle finger_ had back pain and headaches. It's a choice you have to make. I wish everyone the best and remember one thing. You're in charge of your own life. There are success stories of people who contine to keep  cancer at bay by the way they choose to live. Exercise and diet go hand in hand_ one without the other will not work. I went straight into menopause after surgery but I'm  taking suppliments that are estrogen free to handle the hot flashes.

Aromasin is a godsend!,F,54,1  weeks,8/16/2009Email,Aromasin
89, 2, Stage I breast cancer,I am experiencing hot flashes; severe joint pain with extreme stiffness after sitting for more than 20 minutes; carb cravings; worsening of carpal tunnel symptoms; numbness in fingers; imsomnia; uncontrolled emotional swings (unexpected crying); difficulty to concentrate (could be residual chemo brain); pronounced fatigue due to greater joint pain experienced.,I would like to switch to an alternative aromatase inhibitor but I'm afraid they all have negative side effects.  I will try to eliminate or at least cut down on animal proteins and instead attempt to get more protein from grains_ fruits and veggies.,F,55,60  days,8/7/2009,Aromasin
90, 2, Femara side effects,Started Aromasin two weeks ago after 7 months on Femara. Switched due to side effects_ which have been worse on aromasin. I have severe fatigue. It's like going through chemo again. Joint pain_ bone pain_ headaches_ hot flashes_ having trouble sleeping. Heaviness in chest for last two days_ like I had after each Herceptin treatment. I see my oncologist next week. I'm almost to the point of going off these meds and taking my chances. Quality of life is so important to me. If I have 5 or 10 years before the cancer returns_ I'd rather live it without these symtoms!!!,,F,61,2  weeks,7/2/2009Email,Aromasin
91, 1, stage 1 breast cancer,joint pain and stiffness_ extreme anxiety_ hyped up_ sleep disturbance_ memory loss_ hot flashes - but the worst was that I had frequent heart palpitations and several episodes of cardiac arrythmia which has stopped now that I am off the drug.,I think the extreme depletion of estrogen caused by this drug was more than my body could handle.  I know the studies are positive in terms of it being effective in preventing a recurrence for stage 1 breast cancer_ but I did not want to sacrifice my heart in the process!,F,64,16  months,5/9/2009,Aromasin

But still better than Femara.,Aromasin is the best one for me so far.  Femara is awful Arimidex caused mood changes and joint pain.  It seems that they could come up with something better.  Has anyone had ankle issues?,F,58,75  days,2/16/2009Email,Aromasin
94, 2, Recurrence breast cancer,Terrible joint and muscle pain.  No energy whatsoever.,Started off on Tamoxifen and my consultant changed that after two years to Arimidex but with the joint pain was changed to Aromasin.

My oncologist put me on Femara_ took it 2 months_ had about 25 side effects...I told my Dr. I cannot take this any more_ get me off of this.  So was put me on Arimidex_ tried it for 2 months - found it to be equally untollerable_ many side effects_ felt like I had chemo brain much worse than when I was on chemo_ to the point of not being sure I could find my way home on several days...told my doctor that it was not worth it_ who cares if it might prolong life if you are unable to function_ told them I was going to end up on Soc Sec disability for mental impairment if I stayed on it_ it scared me to be on it.  So then they put me on Aromasin...after 2 months started getting headaches_ felt ill (flu-like + more) all the time_ was exhausted all the time - insomnia for 3-4 nights_ then would ""colap",F,54,6  months,4/4/2008Email,Aromasin

101, 3, history of breast cancer,Total loss of libido. Bone pain. I did not have a recurrence of breast cancer while taking this drug_ but I have no way of knowing whether or not it protected me.,,F,59,3  years,2/7/2008,Aromasin
102, 2, BC Stage IIC invasive,Took Tamoxifen for 2 yrs with side effects that included extreme hot flushes_ nausea (like morning sickness)_ horrible insomnia & headaches.  Switched to Aromasin for next 2 yrs and it was tolerable for the first 6 months with same side effects as Tamoxifen.  Then the bone & joint pain in the outer extremities started. Couldn't get out of a bed or a seated position or do stairs without feeling like a cripple.  Mornings were worse & I too had the 'claw' effect with terrible weakness in my hands. Ankles felt fragile_ as though the bones would break with the slightest pressure.  Once healthy libido disappeared_ urogenital system dried up & cholesterol levels tripled_ although no change in exercise & diet. Doctor switched me to Femara 2 months ago.  After the 1st week_ I actually slept for two whole nights & felt awesome! Then the side effects of the Femara kicked in & it's starting to feel the same as with the Aromasin.,I'm so thankful to have found this website! Over the last few years_ I've so often thought that I was the only one experiencing these awful side effects. Until diagnosis_ I was very fit & worked out 5x/week - weights and cardio. I continued to work & work-out even through chemo cycles. Now I feel like a 90 yr old asexual being. Chemo-induced menopause presented its own challenges but these Aromatase-Inhibitor side effects continue to affect the quality of my life.  Doctors are quick to offer Rx for side effects but each Rx has its own risks & side effects. It's a domino effect & I just want to feel 'normal' again & get on with my life.  It would be so different if we were dealing with a broken arm.  An X-ray would show the break_ time would heal the fracture & then it would be nothing but a memory.  Nobody knows if these AI drugs even work on something we don't even know is or isn't there.  Quality vs Quantity of life should be addressed by somebody!,F,50,2  years,1/3/2008Email,Aromasin

Had mastectomy/chemo/radiation and over 2 years on Tamoxifen. Did great. Switched to Aromasin and immediately things started going wrong.  After one year_ I have refused to take.  Even people at work commented how much better I seemed to be after I stopped taking for two weeks. Began sleeping the whole night w/in two days of stopping.  Have lost 4 lbs. My brain works!

108, 1, estrogen-sensitive breast cancer,Severe joint pain_ carpal tunnel syndrome in left arm_ painful feet_ weight gain_ digestive problems_ especially constipation.,My doctor put me on Aromasin after I had complained about the unbearable side effects I was experiencing with Arimidex.  However_ after a couple of months of the new drug I felt even worse than I had felt when taking Arimidex.  I ache all over all day and night and can no longer exercise or carry things. It is now 18 months since I first started taking exemestane medicine_  and I have decided to give it up for a month before I next see my cancer specialist.  He had mentioned to me about five months ago that_ since I was one of those patients who had experienced extreme side effects_ perhaps I could benefit by switching to Tamoxifen.  I must say I'm not keen.  I have discussed the question with my family doctor and pyschotherapist_ and both agree that_ in the end_ only I take the decision to stop. So that's what I am going to do.,F,64,9  months,5/11/2007Email,Aromasin
