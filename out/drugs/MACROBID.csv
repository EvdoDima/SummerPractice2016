0, 1, Bladder infection,-itchy scaly rash-drug induced pulmonary toxicity-feverShortness of breath-extreme exhaustion -burning pain in lungs,This drug literally was poisoning my lungs. I felt nauseaus _ fever of 40_ shortness of breath_ burning lungs. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG! I have never had any side effects from any drug in the past... My dr did a chest X-ray and I have drug induced pneumonia and am on more antibiotic and steroids to heal my lungs.  It's pathetic this drug is even on the market.,F,45,7  days100 mg,8/17/2016Email,Macrobid
1, 1, UTI,Slow to improve symptoms of UTI but had no side effects while taking. 1 day after discontinuation became itchy_ had abdominal pain_ then developed angioedema with swelling of face and hands. Broke out in clusters of welts over parts of my body. Benadryl was only minimally effective. Have been started on a short course of Prednisone which is clearing things up nicely.,Having read this website I believe that Macrobid's potential for harm outweighs its benefits. Standard drug compendiums state that an allergic reaction to Macrobid is rare. I'm starting to believe otherwise.,F,53,7  days100 mg 2X D,8/13/2016,Macrobid
2, 4, UTI,Fatigue_ upset stomach,I was prescribed Macrobid for a common_ uncomplicated UTI at an urgent care clinic. At first_ I didn't think it was working as it took over a day for symptoms to ease and on day 3 I could still feel some burning. I supplemented with home treatment such as drinking 10 glasses of water every day. On day 4 all symptoms were gone. As for side effects_ on day 2_ I experienced upset stomach which is a common side effect of antibiotics. It was quickly resolved by taking probiotics. On day 4 and 5 I suffered from fatigue_ which I believe was caused by the medication. When taking antibiotics I'm mostly concerned about getting yeast infections but that doesn't seem to have happened this time. Overall_ Macrobid did the job with few side effects and I would not hesitate to take it again.,F,52,5  days100mg 2X D,8/11/2016,Macrobid

I also felt slightly nauseous. I couldn't work because of this medicine.

12, 1, UTI,This is the WORST antibiotic on the market. I had to unfortunately be on this several times to treat my UTI's_ but this time I am completely done with this horrible medication. I have experienced dizziness_ extreme nausea and  chest congestion. I had to go to my doctor again today and I am on steriods now to clear it up.  When I was in Wal-Mart earlier today I felt like I was going to pass out and drop to the floor while I was walking. My legs felt very heavy and my heart was racing with palpitations. It was very scary and I feel sick to my stomach at this very moment :(,,F,37,2  days100mg 2X D,7/21/2016,Macrobid
13, 1, UTI,I literally feel as if I were poisoned. Day 1 Dose 1_ I only ate toast and then took it. I could not get out of bed. The waves of nausea were extreme. The remaining days I ate a heavy carb meal and waited 20-30 min then took the pill. The nausea was still pretty bad_ but I could get out of bed to make it to the couch. I wake up every morning with diarrhea and this morning I puked 2x. I am so sore and tired. My head is so heavy I need naps about every 3 hours. This is so ridiculous. I went to urgent care to receive help so I could work and instead get poisoned. I have yet to see one single positive review. There are SO SO many better alternatives. I even told the doc I had been given Cipro in the past and it had worked_ but she ignored it.,Take this off the market.

I have taken other antibiotics before without any complications so I didn't think twice about taking this one_ especially since my DR. Assured me that it was well tolerated by his patients. I became severely ill and had to go to the ER after only taking it for 2 days. It's been 4 days since stopping and I am still feeling the side effects. I wish I would have researched it more and had found this thread before taking it. With over 1_000 negative reviews from others who have had such adverse reactions to it the FDA SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER REMOVING THIS DRUG FROM CIRCULATION!,F,46,2  days100mg,7/19/2016,Macrobid

42, 1, UTI,First of all this medication did not quickly clear up my UTI or even alleviate any of my best symptoms like other antibiotics have for me with past UTI's. The Dr said she believed that my UTI had infact spread beyond just my bladder and was into my kidneys yet prescribed Macrobid (which I now know is not recommended for anything other than uncomplicated UTI's infections that haven't infected or impaired anything other than the bladder). I figured I just had another one of my rip roaring kidney infections when I got home from the Dr and continued to feel worse after taking my first dose of Macrobid. My lower back/ flank pain continued to get worse as did the extreme pressure & pain when I had to go to the bathroom. Within an hour or so of taking my first dose I started to feel extremely tired but now also had a headache that made it hard to sleep. The next morning I took my 2nd dose as prescribed and became nauseated. Figured I should have eaten it with food so I forced myself to eat. I fought throwing up for hours unable to do anything except lay on the couch. What had started out as a minor headache was now an overwhelming throbbing headache with random sharp stabbing like pains in a very specific spot in my head. I felt like I was being stabbed towards the top right side of my head just under my scalp but didn't hurt to touch. The shooting or stabbing pains would just come and go without any warning and despite anything I did to try and alleviate them. I'm allergic too,,F,33,10  days,4/9/2016,Macrobid

Rash on my chest and four head. The day I came home from ER the area by both of my knees mostly the right one swelled up with fluid another sign of being poisoned by Macrobid. I think the thing that clued me into being poisoned was the feeling on the tip of my tongue numbness that's common with like bad spider bites and scorpion bites. Thank you to everyone who took the time to tell everyone about this horrible drug. The doctor at my follow-up visit from the ER said the only thing that will make it go away his time and drinking lots of water to wash it out of my body.,Macrobid is like poison to me_ in fact when I went to ER I told him I feel like I've been poisoned. It's one week later my muscles are killing me the only thing I can do is try to wash this crap out of my body with lots of water I still have an insatiable thirst and all my muscles in my entire body extremely weak I don't recommend anyone taking this drug!!!,F,52,3  days,3/26/2016Email,Macrobid

68, 1, UTI,Three doses: I got up next morning and immediately knew Macrobid affected my joints. My hips_ knees_ and shoulders_ places I'd never had issues_ hurt before my feet hit the floor. I called my doctor and waited to hear back with alternative rx_ as the office said they needed to research because of my past reactions with other meds_ particularly CIPRO.  I never heard back and took it as a sign to take matters into my own hands. I won't go into it here; suffice to say I must research to protect my health.  In addition_ I took Ibuprofen to counteract joint inflammation. I thought I'd be okay since Macrobid wasn't in the same group as Cipro. I was wrong and shame on me that I trusted a well-meaning friend who looked up Macrobid on this site who said it looked to be fine (I had no internet access that night) and for not trusting my gut instinct.This happened in September. The reason I submit my experience now is that my left Achilles heel is tender and swollen this morning. I've read tha,"Just food for thought... A friend asked_ ""So what were you p#ssed off at?""Aha!

78, 3, Bladder/kidney infection,Headache and some nausea_ also the rib pain that others have described as well as general malaise. But I'm wondering whether the rib pain (and maybe the malaise) is due to the fact that Macrobid is ineffective against kidney infections_ and so it allows the kidney infection to get worse and_ in fact_ puts more strain on the kidneys. If I had had a simple bladder infection_ headache and nausea may have been the only side effects and_ if it had worked for that_ would have been tolerable to me.,Read the package.

172, 1, post intercourse to avoid future ut,"I was prescribed Cipro for a uti. This drug has always worked for me and this last uti was no different. What was different was my PA prescribed Macrobid to be taken immediately after intercourse which he felt was causing my bladder infection aka uti (according to him). When I questioned him about this drug he said he gives it to his wife. Naturally I felt ok about taking it. My prescription is 30 caps. I have been taking it on average of twice a week since 10/15/14. Since that date I have experienced ""flu-like"" symptoms (chills_ slight fever_ nausea_ loss of appetite_ tightness in chest and dry cough when taking a deep breath.) These symptoms come and go and fortunately have only lasted a day or two. I can't imagine taking this pill everyday. There must be something else on the market that will allow me to have sex with my husband of 45 years_ and not feel like crap the next day. Good luck to everyone.",,F,65,7  days100/mg,11/21/2014,Macrobid

After the last dose I developed hives and had trouble swallowing_ ending up in the ER 3 times in one week.  I was so sick I was sure I was dying.

176, 2, UTI,After the first couple of doses I felt fine on this medication_ but then after the 3rd dose I started getting painful pressure and bloating in my upper abdomen_ it really was very uncomfortable! I also had no appetite_ I had to force food down so that I could take the medication. I had sinus pain and dizziness as well. It said on the label the medication might make me drowsy_ however it gave me insomnia - I couldn't sleep. On the last day of the medication I got hives on my face and forehead_ but they soon went. Also my ears started itching inside and hurt like I was coming sown with an ear infection - so I was really glad I was on the last day. The day after I finished the course my arm broke out in a red rash which was hot to the touch_ but again that soon went. My appetite came back 2 days after finishing the course. I still feel the urge to pee_ and I wouldn't take this medication again.,After reading comments on here_ I realise people have had worse side effects than me_ but mine were bad enough for me to know I would refuse this medication in future_ in favour of an antibiotic less toxic.

No significant side effects after day 2.,Took Macrobid for a bad UTI.  I was afraid to take it based on reviews_ but cannot take Bactrim due to allergy and was more scared of Cipro.

I previously went on Bactrim a year back for ten days and felt ill for 6 months_ so was terrified to even think about antibiotics. However_ my UTI wasn't getting better_ and back pain was getting worse.  The doctor at Urgent Care urged me to take it telling me how horrible it is if it goes to your kidneys and you get a blood infection.  I actually went to Urgent Care twice and they gave me another antibiotic CIPRO which I was even more terrified to take because I read it breaks down your joints.  So I ended up forcing myself to take macrobid (the milder antibiotic) of the two.  Immediately after taking the first pill_ I ended up almost having a panic attack thinking I was having an allergic reaction.  I was expecting to get much worse side effects based on the reviews here_ however_ it wasn't that bad.  My anxiety about it was probably worse. Mainly I was concerned about the ""fatal lung side effect"" and ""nerve damage"" on the slip of paper that comes with the antibiotic. However_ I am ok.  I will do everything in my power not to get a UTI again. I bought D-Mannose powder_ and will drink apple cider vinegar and a lot of water_ and even bought feminine wash.PS. My Urine Culture was negative_ and very little amount of leukocytes in my urine when I went to Urgent Care_ so I thought it might not be a UTI and will just go away.

I have never taken this antibiotics much less even heard the name before this. A week later I went back to the same place and was told that it seemed I had a normal cough and to continue the microbid to treat both issues...By this point I was 5/6 days into my prescription. It just so happened the following week I had an appointment with my primary. I go and am told that microbid doesn't take away coughs and its the worst antibiotics to give for anything. I am already battling psoriatic arthritis. Now because of this medicine I am in the worst pain. I cant take a deep breathe and have resulted to my inhailer. I'm coughing so hard that I end up gasping for air or this loud squeal/squeak noise follows my coughs like my throat is closing. I was period spotty about a week after taking it and now i am in full blown period crisis. My tonsils are spotty and it also gave me a yeast infection 3 days in. I'm going to say that all of my issues are because of this medication. I go to the Dr for kidney pain and I leave with a million more issues just waiting to go in my body.

So I choked down more saltines in that 7 days than I have eaten in the past ten years. You HAVE to get something in your stomach before these pills hit it or you are in for a very nauseaus ride.

352, 1, Infection,Less than 15 minutes after taken Macrobid I experienced uncontrollable itching_ swelling and hives. As I tried to get up I felt really light headed and faint. I started feeling discomfort on my chest so immediately called an ambulance. On route to hospital I developed severe abdominal cramps. Since my body was compensating and my airway was still okay I waited to see a doctor for almost 2 hours. As I waited I was visiting the washroom with severe abdominal pain_ diarrhea and nausea. Finally as I was on a stretcher at emerg. the doctor poked his head in the curtain and without even looking at me ask me to go home and take Claritin. After being discharged I had a second reaction 12 hours later. I went to a different hospital by taxi. By that time my voice was really hoarse. Within minutes I was examined and Benadryl IV_ epinephrine injection_ ventolin and saline were administered. Then I was put on a heart monitor for 4 hours. I was prescribed prednisone 50 mg for 4 days_ and Benadryl 4 times a day for a week depending on how quickly my side effects disappeared or improved. I was also prescribed an epi pen due to the severity of the anaphylactic reaction. Today I was asked to continue the prednisone and Benadryl for another week. It has been approximately 72 hours since my initial interaction_ and I still have severe stomache aches_ headaches and a lot of joint pain. I call Macrobid the new capsolates bee.

353, 1, Possible UTI,When taking this medication I thought I was getting a lot of mosquito bites in strange places.  Didn't even occur to me that this could be the start of a reaction.,5 days after finishing the medication I developed symptoms.  Started with itchy swollen hands.  Scratched most of the night and when I got up I saw red swollen hives mostly in my groin area and legs.  They were very painful.  Went to emergency and it took a little while to determine that the reaction was indeed to Macrobid (generic).  Had an injection of benydryl which didn't help much.  Was sent home with steroids and antihistamines and I'm following up with an appointment to a dermatologist tomorrow.  After reading how long some of you have had these reactions I'm worried but hope that this will be over soon.

361, 1, UTI,I am allergic to most all antibiotics. I thought Macrobid was the last one I could still take. I felt that twinge one gets when they are starting to get a UTI for about 2 hours before I called my Dr.'s office_ and they put me on the stuff right away. I took the first dose around 10 a.m._ but in the evening around 9:30p.m._ had horrible teeth-chattering chills_ fever of 101+_ very sore_ especially where kidneys are located in back. Thought I was getting a kidney infection. D2 morning_ continued fever_ went to Dr._ urine test showed microscopic hematuria.The gyno ordered a urine culture_ and blood test because the prelim. test  Indicated I had a kidney infection_ but to continue Macrobid (Nitrofurantoin generic). Severe nausea_ weakness_ very sore all over_ like I had the flu. At 2:30 a.m._ woke up feeling like I had just run down the street--breathing heavy_ uncontrollable severe shaking/shivering of all muscles_ that lasted over an hour.. Took temp._ 103.5. At that point_ after taking,I called the Dr. the next morning_ and was told it couldn't be the medicine_ but that I probably had a kidney infection and needed to have a CT scan of my kidneys right away. Stopped taking the medicine anyway_ and was able to be seen by the urologist 2 days later. Was told by her that Macrobid quite frequently can cause all the above symptoms (and others I hadn't had!) and I was lucky to quit taking it when I did. The CT scan showed everything perfectly normal. Also_ when the urine culture and blood tests my gyno sent off for testing came back_ everything was normal--no infection.But I am beginning to wonder if that evil medicine actually caused the microscopic hematuria in the first place! The exact same thing happened last year to me_ and I had the same tests_ everything coming back completely normal. If I could_ I would sue the drug company for making this! They have cost me many hours of work_ alot of out-of-pocket expense for these scans_ and Dr. visits_ and their prescription--I have no insurance!,F,54,1.5  days100mg. 2X D,6/23/2012,Macrobid

Upset stomach_ mild nausea. Elevated heart rate (104 at rest). Tremors/shaking.,I have trouble with recurrent UTI's after a pelvic sling surgery several years ago. So my GYN suggested that I take Macrobid post coital to prevent UTI's. Since I'm in a long distance relationship and expected that I'd only have to take Macrobid for a few days every 6 weeks or so_ his suggestion sounded like a good fit. I had no side effects with the first round. I took 2 a day for 5 days and they seemed to do the trick... no UTI. Then 6 weeks later_ I took 1 dose before going to bed. The next morning the palm of my right hand started itching_ intensely. Then the left palm followed. Within minutes the soles of my feet began to itch like crazy. Then I noticed that same sensation in my mouth. Next_ the rash showed up... starting on my legs and arms and then my ribs_ hips_ tummy... red blotches appeared on my face. Then my stomach became upset and I got nauseous. My boyfriend was ready to take me to the ER_ but I had recognized that I was having an allergic reaction early on and took a Zyrtec. It took about an hour to kick in_ during which time the allergic reaction got progressively worse. The Zyrtec kicked in just after the tremors and shaking started. I noticed the elevated heart rate later in the day. I have PSVT and apparently the stress of the allergic reaction set off an episode of tachycardia. I'd have to rank this as the 2nd most severe allergic reaction I've ever had. Looks like I'll have to find an alternative for UTI prevention.,F,49,5  days100 MG 2X D,6/1/2012,Macrobid

By evening thought I had the flu with sore skin_ body aches_ fever_ tightness of chest and slight dizzy feeling when moving.  Stayed home from work the next day to recover.  Went to work this morning with no fever and only feeling week. By one pm I was so sick I could barely function and went home to bed.  Decided to do some research tonight.  Looks like I am not alone in feeling like I have been mowed over by a Mack truck.  I have one pill left which I will not take.  This drug worked wonderfully for getting rid of the uti but sure made a mess of the rest of me and I missed a total of two days work.,Would certainly have my Dr. Try a different drug for a uti in the future.

By day 2_ I was exhausted and taking a long nap every day.  On the morning of Day 5 (Sunday) at around 4am_ I awoke feeling feverish with body aches and increased nausea. Breathing was also difficult - as if I had a heavy weight sitting on my chest....getting a deep breath was not comfortable.  I was unable to eat and not able to drink more than one tiny sip at a time.  I chose at this point to NOT take the 5th and final dose.  I called the pharmacist who told me it was nothing and to finish the meds but my instinct told me not to.  By Sunday afternoon_ I had a fever of 101_ body aches and severe joint pain_ abdominal pain and nausea which made me feel like I was at death's door. Zofran did not kill the nausea but only took the edge off enough to start drinking fluids again.  On day 8_ I was finally able to eat again but just a little toast and applesauce.Day 9 (today)- my appetite is finally starting to return although breathing is still difficult and I get winded quite easily.  Still very tired and they eye twitch is still there.

I took the first dose before bed and woke up with very bad neck and head pain. I could barely get out of bed but_ got up and started my day thinking I just had a horrible nights sleep. I had diarhea but_ again just assumed I was under the weather. I took a second dose and decided to work from home but the headache and neck pain persisted and eventually I was so fatigued I needed to lie down. I slept but woke up feeling like I had been hit by a bus and the headache and neck pain continued. As I was lying in bed I was trying to figure out why I was feeling SO incredibly bad and why my head was so TOXIC feeling with burning sensations on ears and neck. The only thing that made sense was a reaction to this drug. So_ here I am because I looked it up on the internet. I feel for all of you especially those of you who have taken more than a few doses. This stuff is hideous and I do not understand WHY it is not immediately irradicated. The fever response to this drug is baffling to me but not to a bacterialogist/chemist etc. They need to figure out why this response occurs to medication!. So unconscionable of FDA.

Was so worried that I would give my ""flu"" to family and almost ruined my Christmas vacation.  Thankfully_ figured out that it was a rogue medicine and stopped taking it.

After stopping medication: Random_ sharp throbbing pains across the body_  intermittent chest pain (left side)_ rash-like bumps on legs and arms,I reported possible mild UTI to PCP because of infection concern (recent knee replacement). She prescribed Macrobid; a mild UTI prior to my surgery in October was cleared with Bactrim (some side effects but tolerable for 3 days).  Side effects began immediately and it is of great concern that more possible side effects appeared right after I stopped taking Macrobid (did not have a UTI and PCP put this drug on the do-not-use list after I reported side effects). The chest pain is very strange - it is intermittent and starts right at the center breastbone and moves to the left towards my armpit.

I've never had stomach ulcers before_ but that's how I would want to describe the pain. It wasn't enough to keep me from eating_ but it made me uncomfortable. I opted not to take my last dose because I figured the stomach pain was related. Later that night I began experiencing muscle aches and chills. I felt feverish. My heart felt like it was pounding in my chest_ and I felt short of breath. I also noticed some hives appearing on my arms and legs. I took some Benadryl and fell asleep_ but now I'm awake with the pounding and shortness of breath_ which prompted my research on the Internet to see if these symptoms were related to the drug.

After the second dose I felt more and more sick_ nausea_ I felt I had to stretch my muscles which then hurted very much upon doing so. I felt very cold and started shaking uncontrollably. Finally I had to throw up. My temperature had risen to a very high fever. A while after this my heart was working very hard and my chest didn't feel right. I was also short of breath while doing nothing.,I have had this antibiotic two other times this year also for an UTI. I thought that I had a severe flu attack at the same time just after starting the treatment. The second time I thought it to be very strange that I had a flu attack again after the first dose. Well there was no doubt anymore when for the third time I got very sick and then I mean very sick!! I stopped this antibiotic and got Amoxicilling instead. After being very sick for another day and a half it slowly cleared up. It is obvious I can not ever take this drug again. It was a very frightening experience!!

Also_ got muscle aches and general fatigue...,I have never had an immediate reaction to any drug like Macrobid and_ for me_ the side effects(allergy?) aren't worth taking this medicine again.  Initially_ I took Macrobid for an uti 2pills daily for 5 days and it was great.  Then my gyno recommended that I take one pill after  intercourse with my husband as a precaution_ and I started to get strong side-effects. Firstly_ I felt like I was coming down with the flu..body aches..fever_ chills_ then_ it was hard to take a deep breath...going up stairs got me winded..geesh!  I had to take 2 days off from work two times!  I didn't believe that one pill could have such sudden side-effects so I tried it once again yesterday.  Again I got tightness in my chest and dry cough.

The next am I called Dr. and we deicided that I should stop macrobid until flu symptoms cleared. Symptoms alsmot gone the following day so I began the drug again. A few hours after this dose I became ill again with very bad flu symptoms: nausea_ intense joing pain_ delerium_ vision blurriness. fever of 101.5_ dry mouth_ rosey colored skin and severe trouble breathing. I had to resort to albuterol just to keep my lungs open enough to get a deep breath. I took one dose this am and things got to the point where I considered the ER.

Then the following day I went for a hike which normally would have been doable for me_ and had some sort of asthmatic attack (I don't have asthma) where I couldn't breathe. Barely made it up and down the mountain. The day after stopping the medication I developed a rash that got worse and worse every day_ and now three days after having stopped Macrobid I have a full-body rash and muscle weakness_ and am experiencing mood swings. Awesome. ,I'm sure that this drug works very well for some people so I don't think it should be taken off the market; however_ I am appalled by the fact that none of these side effects are mentioned to us by doctors_ and the pill bottle has none of these side effects listed. In fact_ when I called my doctor to tell her about the allergic reaction_ she was 'surprised' since side effects are so 'rare'. Judging by this bulletin board_ side effects to Macrobid are clearly not as rare as the manufacturer and doctors would have us believe.,F,24,7  days100MG 2X D,9/12/2011Email,Macrobid

I believe that if you are suffering from chills_ fever_ nausea_ and all that bad stuff_ it may be a kidney infection causing all those symptoms instead of the actual pill itself. I've been taking these pills twice a day (although I'm inconsistent and have no certain time to take it)_ and I'm feeling fine. On the second day of taking this drug_ I went to an amusement park (Canada's Wonderland) and didn't feel dizzy (despite going on crazy spinning rides). My UTI was very minor but I didn't want to risk it getting worse so I went to the doctor's.

As summer rolled around I decided I wanted to get in shape (again...geez)_ so I got up early one morning_ ate breakfast_ took Macrobid and jumped on my bike. Within the first 30 minutes of riding I was coughing. I went home and have been dry coughing for about three days now. Not fun. Previous to this I loved macrobid as the UTI's have been non-existant.,Anyone else have a similar experience? What happened with you? How did you resolve? I read that lung problems are a rare but potential side effect. How can this be? How does the macrobid attatch itself inside the lungs? Did I do this to myself by exercising too soon after taking Macrobid (not enough time to disolve and leave the body)?,M,38,3  months100mg 1X D,6/9/2011Email,Macrobid

536, 1, UTI,fever_ chills_ body aches_ severe headache_ nausea_ extreme fatigue_ cough_ itchy throat_ basically feels like the flu,"I was prescribed Macrobid about 7 months ago for a UTI (which I get often). It worked fine then and I had no adverse reactions. I had three pills leftover from that round 7 months ago_ and took one of them a few weeks ago for a minor UTI that I felt coming on. Took the pill before bed_ woke up in the middle of the night with severe chills and fever. At the time I thought I must have contracted a virus_ even though I never get sick like that and I get my flu shot every year. However_ I was prescribed Macrobid again for a UTI two days ago_ and a few hours after my first dose that morning_ the SAME symptoms started again! Felt like I was dying of the flu for over 24 hours! Couldn't even get out of bed_ slept for 18 hours and was basically miserable. Called my doctor and had to go back in today to ""re-evaluate"" my symptoms. He said that my reaction to this medication is ""very rare"" but he prescribed Cipro instead (which I have taken before with no side effects). I think the Dr. saying these symptoms are rare is ridiculous_ seeing as how many people on here have had the EXACT SAME reactions as me!

539, 3, UTI,Started taking Macrobid for UTI and on the 4th day_ started itching on legs and hands.  Itching worsened a little_ but I continued the full course which cleared the UTI.  Now_ 3 days after stopping_ the itching seems to be getting worse on bottom of feet and palms of hands.  No other notable side effects.,Macrobid has worked well for me through the years.  I had a SERIOUS side effect with BACTRIM (A SULFA DRUG).  Severe itching on palms of hands and bottom of feet_ spontaneous bruising on legs_ 103 degree fever_ chills.  I took prednisone (20 mg) to stop the reaction on my own--the insta care didn't catch the allergy symptoms. Saw my doctor the next day and he told me I was having a Steven-Johnson's reaction to Sulfa.  Told me the history of sulfa--used by military in WWI (only available anti-biotic then) and it would either work or the soldiers would die from the allergic reaction.  He tries to NEVER prescribe sulfa (another doctor on call prescribed Bactrim for me).  FOR THOSE HAVING FEVER_ BRUISING_ INTENSE ITCHING_ LOOK UP STEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME---kidney failure_ liver failure_ and 3rd degree burns on the skin (from inside out).  Not good.  Kept a watch on my kidneys for a month after the start of the reaction. My doctor asked why I took prednisone (I had some at home).  I just knew something was REALLY wrong and had to stop the reaction.  He said I saved my life by taking it when I did.

At first it was just take two a day for 7 days_ which cleared up the infection_ but each time I had sex with my husband I got one again no matter what I did_ and I had about 7 different ones in the matter of 5 months. So then my doctor told me to take one after each time I had sex_ which seemed to work for a little while_ but after a month of none I started getting them again frequently. So my doctor then put me on one a day everyday_ which it has been that way for 9 months. Well I kept getting yeast infections_ yet three doctors assured me it wasnt the Macrobid_ but I just couldnt believe that since Ive never had a yeast infection until I started taking this medication everyday. Then I asked for a foruth opinion who assured me it WOULD cause yeast infections. So I tried all the natural stuff and different medications to get rid of the yeast infection yet it still keeps coming back. So I started trying to get off Macrobid but everytime I started taking less I started feeling a UTI coming on. And at the moment thats still where Im at_ any suggestions would be appreciated.

A couple of hours later I had the same exact symptoms. I still don't feel good_ but I took a bath to raise my body temperature since I was constantly getting chills. That definitely helped_ but I still have a bad headache and my body is still achey. I'm stopping this pill now_ and hope that no one else has to go through this!!!,F,22,5  days100mg 2X D,3/5/2011,Macrobid
576, 1, UTI,Headache_ extreme fatigue_ dizziness_ brain fog_ nausea_ body pain_ very lethargic.,I normally do not have side effect taking medicines.

577, 1, UTI,headache_ extreme tiredness_ brain fog_ nausea_ loss of appetite_ yeast infection_ shortness of breath/racing heart,I have never had problems with an antibiotic before. I had to take this antibiotic all the way through so that my UTI was gone before my wedding date (I caught the UTI 8 days before the wedding_ so there was no way I was going to stop the dosage or try something new and risk the UTI coming back...). I developed a yeast infection_ despite my daily intake of yogurt containing live cultures. I had to purchase probiotic pills towards the end in order to fend off the yeast infection. I also had to administer Monistat 3. The nausea would get so bad that I would wake up in the middle of the night with it. I never vomited from the nausea_ but I have a relatively strong stomach. People with weaker stomachs would definitely be at risk of vomiting. The physical head-to-toe pain this pill caused was tremendous. I figured out that whenever I took this pill_ I should chase it with two extra strength tylenol. It helps. Also_ do not take this pill on an empty stomach_ nor even before you start a meal. Eat an entire full meal and then take this pill - it decreases the severity of the side effects. Also_ I stopped taking the medication during the daytime and this helped greatly. I took the first pill around 5pm_ then the second pill around midnight. Take both pills with a lot of food. Drink milk with your meal if you have to. I will never take this medication again - it was a terrible experience.,F,30,7  days100mg 2X D,3/3/2011,Macrobid

I went to sleep last night_ and woke up and the aching pain in my back had switched to the left side of my lower back. Currently_ it is all around my lower back.

Went to my Dr. who prescribed Macrobid. First few days and my UTI felt much better. Antiobiotics always make me feel 'off' so I HATE taking them. Was going to stop after 3 days_ but was persuaded to keep on them for a few more. I am an avid runner_ tried running on my treadmill on day 6 and my lungs were on fire. Felt like a 2 pack a day smoker! googled macrobid and read that lung problems can be a side effect. Reluctantly took 1 more pill the next day. Noticed a rash under my right armpit. My mom advised to stop taking it. 2 days later I am still dealing with extremely ITCHY traveling hives that seem to alternate from my scalp to my hands to my feet.

I have many allergies to drugs_ but thankfully not to Macrobid.  I acquired a severe UTI taking the Autotrain using  toilet paper in their filthy restroom. I also acquired an upper respiratory infection from the Amtrak pillows which I later learned are never washed according to the conductor. When I was able to see the doctor they ran a urine culture that proved I had acquired an E-coli infection of the urinary tract. I was very sick_ and was beginning to develop pain over my kidneys.  They said the UTI probably came from the toilet paper left sitting on the dirty Amtrak restroom counter in unsanitary conditions. The UTI infection was horrific. The UTI bacteria caused fever_ burning pain of the urethra_body aches_ and exhaustion. I was treated with azithromycin to clear the respiratory infection_ and Macrobid 100 MG twice daily for the UTI. I admit I am very tir,I would far rather take an antibiotic than die from the E-coli infection I acquired on Amtrak trains.

They prescribed this to me for the first time by phone when I said I felt like I maybe had a UTI. When I called back to complain that I'd deteriorated over night they told me to keep taking it. I wound up in the hospital. With my symptoms_ temperature and white blood cell count they assumed I had a kidney infection and put me on IV Cipro. Of course it was ceasing the Macrobid that made me better_ not the Cipro. Fast forward to another bout of what seemed like a UTI (turned out to be something else altogether when they cultured for bacteria - none found repeatedly). I'm again given Macrobid and the next morning the exact same symptoms set in. I called the doctor_ was told to keep taking it and click.

601, 1, UTI,The first time I took Macrobid_ it worked but I was nauseous_ sweaty_ and had chills and joint pain.  But my UTIs kept recurring.  I even developed two kidney infections while on Macrobid_ which does not work on upper tract infections.  Cipro worked both times to cure them.  But_ I was placed on Macrobid as a 'prophylaptic treatment' to prevent further UTIs_ although I am not sure it ever actually helped.  I should have listened to my body_ and not the doctors_ who absolutely denied the drug could cause any side effects.  I developed a very severe allergic-like reaction_ including hives_ vomiting_ angioedema (swelling of the hands_ face_ ears)_ difficulty breathing_ and tachycardia.,One year later: I still have eosinophil activation in my gut (confirmed by biopsy)_ causing vomiting and intense nausea.  Heart palpitations still occurring. This is a non-IgE mediated allergic reaction which may have been triggered by Macrobid (there is not_ unfortunately_ a conclusive diagnostic test for this type of reaction).  I am being treated with steroids_ and may have to remain on them for the rest of my life.  I would advise patients who first experience side-effects of this drug to please listen to their body and discontinue treatment!!!  It doesn't work for everybody_ and unfortunately_ doctors seem to find its strange side effects difficult to accept.  I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from taking this drug... the last year has been hell.,F,31,  2X D,1/18/2011,Macrobid

Drinking tons of water still leaves my urine a weird greenish/orange color_ at night I feel the need to vomit_ and have been going to bed around 6pm waking up at 5 30 am still tired. I have though noticed my kidney's do not hurt_ and going to the bathroom feels normal now. Expect that I may have got a yeast infection from all the antiboditic.

No history of diabetes or other medical contribution for the neuropathy - only Nitrofurantoin prescribed as a prophylactic treatment for chronic bladder infections over an 18 month period.  Nitrofurantoin eventually caused permanent disability.  Physician beware.,Because of the use of the term Macrobid I recently did not pick up the fact this is also Nitrofurantoin and within 48 hours of taking this product I was again experiencing nighttime spasm and painful feet and shin area.

I was on Macrobid and like so many people said_ was fine for awhile_ but on the 7th day of taking it I was a MESS.  I have been to the doctor 2 times in the last 3 days- doctor's diagnosed me with 1) the flu 2) an upper respiratory infection 3) the lingering UTI still there 4) An allergic reaction to a 2nd med I started taking because of a rash all over my body and my throat was even swelling up-  I probably had NONE OF THESE THINGS!

The itching felt like I was getting bitten by bugs - very stingy and pinpointed.  Scratching just made it worse.  I was better claritin but antihistamines make me very tired.

In the past 2 years_ every pharmacy in town no longer carries the brand name Macrobid so substitutes the generic AND medical insurance companies no longer will pay for the brand name.  Pharmacies have to order it special and it takes 24 hours to fill the prescription.  I do not know the reason why the brand name medication is so hard to get.

I also experienced an upset stomach and mild diarrhea for the first 5 days. I expected that but not the drowsiness.  The kicker is that I called the pharmacist on the first day to inquire about the side effects.  He told me that drowsiness and achiness were not noted side effects and that those symptoms must be unrelated to the drug.  After a few days of being so tired I could hardly function_ I realized it was indeed the drug.,I realize that drugs can have different effects on different people_ but it seems to me from reading the responses on this site that drowsiness and fatigue are pretty prevalent side effectis.

For some reason it doesn't even really alarm me_ I just feel this sudden burst of gas in my rectum that tells me that I need to go. Using the restroom to go number 2 often comes with foul smelling gas that proceed with it. At first I thought I was pregnant but it could be the fact that this constant ongoing constipation was also the same common side effects of macrobrid everyone else has been experiencing.

The urologist's nurse_ in fact_ scolded me when I told her the drug itself was causing me distress and told me it is an excellent drug and no one else had ever complained.  I cannot even believe that this happened in this day and age and how ignorant these people are of side effects of drugs - not even to question a patient.  I dragged myself to work for the entire summer_ went to bed when I came home and spent my weekends sleeping.  This was my first bad experience with the medical profession and I am now very afraid of getting sick and having to go to a doctor.,F,57,  1X D,6/20/2010,Macrobid

I was also left with a very sore bladder_ and some flank pain. It seemed likely I had let things go too long. I called my dr and asked for Cipro_ which worked well for me a couple months before.

Do not throw away the pharmacy insert sheet until you are clearly through the course of that medication.

By 8am the rash was so bad that I could barely get up.  When I got to the walk in clinic_ I was short of breath_ I had hives LITERALLY from head to toe_ chills_ etc and was sent to the ER. I was given prednisone and an additional antihistimine.  Two days later and I am still on the course of treatment from the ER_ I have hives (though they come and go...but not gently)_ headache_ chills_ hot skin_ neck and ear pain.  Upon picking up the first prescription for this_ I looked at it and told my boyfriend that it looked like poison. I am only hoping that when the 6 days of steroid treatment ends_ I the hives will be gone. It is sheer luck that I didn't take another pill_ as I would likely have gone into shock.

I had about 4-5 UTIs in 2009_ which I had never had before_ so I decided to see a urologist about them.  He wanted to do some tests and put me on the macrobid as prophylaxis until I had them done.  Once I started the macrobid_ I initially began experiencing muscle aches and fatigue_ which progressed into chills and fever up to 103_ SEVERE headache_ chest tightness like it was hard to take a breath_ and a generalized anxious feeling.

I stopped the meds completely_ which in turn_ resulted in hundreds of hives from head to foot. My lips were cracked_ larengytis_ couldn't walk from one room to the other without being out of breath. I was at the ER about 15x in the course of a few months. My blood cell count was so elevated meaning my body was fighting something that was invading my ammune system.  I had a period where my head was so painful I thought it was going to explode. I couldn't touch my chin to my chest I was frozen stuck and stiff.

I will never take this medicine again after reading all the other women who experienced similiar reactions. My doctor seemed surprised_ but believed that it could be the drug. I can't wait until the drug is completely out of my system and i'm back to feeling healthy again.,,F,57,4  weeks,10/20/2009,Macrobid

Other than my UTI_ I had no other health problems the day that I began Macrobid (I was given the generic version). About an hour after I took the first dose_ I was extremely nauseous. The next day_ my stomach felt very acidic_ but I took my next dose in the morning. That evening_ I came down with a bad sore throat and a fever. 3rd day_ had cough_ runny nose_ chills_ fever_ sore throat...continued to take the medicine because I didn't want the UTI to continue. I am now on day 5...still have flu-like symptoms & cough is at its worst. I am going to finish the meds and I am hoping these side effects will lessen_ then go away quickly_ when I am done taking the pills. I will never take Macrobid again after this experience.,F,33,7  days,10/19/2009,Macrobid

I was given macrobid and after reading this forum_ I ALMOST didn't start it because_ frankly_ this scared me. I wanted to let everyone know that not everyone has the bad reaction described by so many on here.

Soon after taking the second pill I came down with a fever of over 100_ stiff neck_ headache_ backache_ leg aches_ chills_ dizziness_ nausea_ no energy and my chest felt like someone was sitting on it.    I quit taking the pills and called my doctor.  It has now been almost 48 hours since I took the last pill.  I still have a headache and my chest hurts when I breath.  I have now developed a nasty cough but hopefully that will clear my chest.  The doctor put me on another UTI medication called Bractrin.  I have not noticed any side effects from the new medication.FYI-other than the urinary tract infection I was not sick before taking Macrobid.  ,This pill should be taken off the market.,F,54,1  days,10/14/2009Email,Macrobid

I quit taking it for 2 days_ and then decided to try again_ immediately started the same all over again.,I will call my Dr. Monday and tell him _he will have to change my medicine_ because he said I would need to be on an antibiotic for a long term _ as my infection had been going on for a while.,F,55,2  days,10/10/2009Email,Macrobid
858, 3, bladder infections,None for about 5 years until last Saturday.  Extreme hives. All over body.,I had taken macrobid off and on for about 5 to 6 years.  Recently I got another bladder infection and was put on macrobid for 7 days and then every other day indefinitely.Saturday I woke up itching on my back and head and by the evening it was all over.  Wherever I would itch it would flare up with huge raised marks all over.  I was put on a steriod on Monday and a heavy dose of Alledgra(benadryl makes me too tired) and I am still itching like crazy.  I don't know how long this will last.  Today is my third day of the steriod.  I guess I can't take macrobid anymore.  I am going to try something more natrual now.  I think it is called g-mannose or something.  It is a simple sugar that you put in your water and it attaches itself to the bad bacteria therefore preventing a bladder or uti.  We will see.,F,38, ,10/7/2009,Macrobid

Dizziness_ anxiety_ horrible headache_ nausea_ heartburn_ burning pain in kidneys coming in waves_ urinating every 20 minutes_shaking_ chills-all severe. They tested me for a kidney stone--none there. It was the antibiotics. Both are very dangerous. If you feel bad after one tablet of either one_ I would stop immediately.

867, 4, UTI,Mostly fatigue and brain fog.  I also have the headache_ but I suspect it'ss because my doctor told me not to drink caffeine while on this_ so I was in caffeine withdrawal.  I ignored her yesterday and had a cup of green tea -- and got the palpitations.  So today I made a very weak cup of green tea_ teabag in for only about 15 seconds_ added an herbal bag for some flavor.  That worked:  Headache gone_ no palpitations_ and some of the fog is even lifting.  Still pretty fatigued though; dragging butt through the workday.,Seems to be working.  5 more doses to go (out of 14).  Let's hope so.

Also possible kidney damage.,I have had urinary tract infections before and I was always treated with Bactrim_ with much success and minimal side effects.  However_ I am 20 weeks pregnant and the doctor insisted on putting me on Macrobid.  The medicine made me feel very dizzy and strange the first hour after ingestion.  It also made my urine turn extremely dark_ and it has not returned to normal.  I was getting headaches during pregnancy beforehand_ but they seemed to worsen during the time I was taking the Macrobid.  I also got very tired and had an upset stomach.  I also got a yeast infection which I contribute to the Macrobid killing beneficial bacteria.  I also still had a UTI after taking the medicine as directed.  I am returning to the doctor (a different doctor this time for sure) in the hopes of finding something pregnancy safe_ and having my kidneys tested to be sure they weren't permanently damaged from the medicine.

872, 4, uti,I had a constant slight headache_ that occasionally got bad.  some nausea but not too severe.  fatigue,i started taking this for a uti_ about a day after I noticed that i had a dry throat.  I figured it was just a side effect and shrugged it off.  As time progressed I was feeling a lot better_ but still had a sore throat with some congestion.  About a day before my last dose I got a terrible fever of about 102 with fatigue and diziness.  I thought it was a side effect_ I called the doctor and they said that this medicine shouldn't give me the fever.  I then decided to go to the doctor_ they said that a bacterial infection formed in my throat and that's what was causing the fever and sore throat.  I'm now using amoxicillin for the uti and the the bactirea in my throat.  don't be afraid to call a doctor.  Not everything is a side effect of the medicine_ this website kinda scared me_ but now i discovered that the UTI macrobid was doing it's job.,F,19,5  days,9/17/2009,Macrobid

I asked my doctor if it could be an allergic reaction to the medication and was told ""no"". She told me to take Zyrtec for a month. I did this and when I stopped taking it_ the rash came back. I continued the Zyrtec for 3 months before I could get off of it. 9 weeks later I got another UTI and was again given Macrobid. Same reaction -- 2 days later. Seemed to me that it was related to the Macrobid_ but again told ""no"". Took Zyrtec for another 2 months.",Developed a 3rd UTI and was given Cipro by another doctor and told that I had definitely had an allergic reaction to the Macrobid. Who do you trust?

I also have neuorpathy in my right arm_ though it seems to be improving.,The effect of the drug is insidious-and the symptoms could I think have mimiced a UTI.  I saw my GP at least twice a month_ and a urologiest 5 times over the course of prescribed treatment.

When I couldn't get in to see her the next day for the results of my test_ I went to the ER of the hospital where I had the test. While there_ I had a urinalysis and found out that I had a UTI. They gave me 100 mg of Macrobid and a prescription for 14 more pills (100 mg) of the Macrobid generic Nitrofurantoin. I didn't start experiencing the side effects until the next day when I woke up from a nap to extreme panic attack-like symptoms (closed throat_ difficulty breathing_ RAPID heart rate and chest pain). I was so afraid that I was having a heart attack_ that I called 911 and went back to the hospital via ambulance. As I have panic/anxiety disorder_ they diagnosed it not as an allergic reaction_ but rather a panic attack. The ER called my dr. and he said for me to stay on the drug. During the next four days_ I suffered the same side effects around the same time every day_ some more than once a day_ others continuously. Finally_ on the evening of day 4_ I paged my dr. at home and he called me and basically felt that it was anxiety-related_ despite my talking about all of my other symptoms_ none of which I get when I have a panic or an anxiety attack.

882, 4, Bladder Infection,Mild stomach ache with ocassional stomach cramps_ mild to moderate fatigue.,Was prescribed Nitrofurantoin Mono/Mac_ the generic form of Macrobid for an acute bladder infection that developed 3 weeks after being operated on for bladder cancer. Also had to have a stint put in my bladder to protect the site where the cancerous tumor was removed during the same surgery. Pain and nausea from the pressure of the stint in my bladder since the surgery 3 weeks ago has been indescribeable and goes well beyond the threshold level of 10 on a 1 to 10 scale for pain & suffering. Have somehow survived it all so far and the stint will finally be surgically removed 5 days from now IF THE MACROBID CLEARS UP THE BLADDER INFECTION IN TIME! So_ I'm really counting on the Microbid to do what it is supposed to do...otherwise_ surgery to remove the stint will have to be postponed until the bladder infection clears up. My Macrobid dosage is 100 mg twice a day for 10 days. Was previously prescribed Bactrim which resulted in only minimal improvement in clearing up the infection. Have been on the Macrobid approaching 3 days now with 7 more to go before finishing the 20 capsule prescription. At this point_ other than experiencing some mild nausea and ocassional stomach cramps for about an hour or so after each dose_ haven't had any severe side-effects or adverse reactions to this drug.,M,57,3  days,8/26/2009,Macrobid
883, 1, UTI,I was fine for the first day_ but on the second day I suddenly developed severe itching and tingling in my hands and feet. We were out to dinner near a bookstore and immediately went to a bookstore to find a Physician's Desk Reference. We looked up Macrobid and found that this was a serious side effect and could lead to permanent nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)_ and if it occurs the drug should be discontinued immediately. I did so and contacted my doctor the next morning. Fortunately_ the symptom did not persist (well_ it did_ sort of -- see comment),Ever since taking that Macrobid several years ago_ I have had what seems to be a unique symptom in detecting future UTIs. Whenever I get a UTI_ my first symptom is a recurrence of that same heavy_ tingling_ itching feeling in my feet that I got with the Macrobid. Within an hour of that_ I will start feeling the other symptoms. So_ it DOES seem to be permanent nerve damage_ although in my case it's actually proved helpful.

Even though I had only vomited mildly one time throughout my whole first trimester of pregnancy and I was now into the second trimester_ I gave the Macrobid the benefit of the doubt and just chalked the sickness up to being pregnant. Over the next 7 days_ the nausea and the other side effects got worse_ although I did not vomit again...just felt like I was going to most of the time. I stopped taking it after 7 days even though the Rx was for 10 days. I was worried about the ill side effects it might have on my baby if it was making me feel so miserable. I will never take Macrobid again.,,F,32,7  days,8/9/2009,Macrobid

900, 1, UTI,Nearly three years after taking five MacroBid pills over a 2.5 day period_ I still experience the pain of severe nerve damage. The pain is in my arms_ hands_ lower legs_ and feet. MacroBid was poison to my system and has negatively impacted my quality of life.,I suffered a knee fracture over eight years ago_ and following that injury I developed RSD.  The RSD had gone into remission.  However_ after taking MacroBid three years ago_ the RSD re-emerged and still causes constant pain now requiring an anti-convulsant (Gabapentin) to keep it somewhat in check.  I would definitely stay away from this poison -- MacroBid.  There are many other antibiotics that can be used to cure a UTI.,F,67,2.5  days,8/6/2009,Macrobid

I have very mild asthma and use occasional Ventolin which I found myself using every half hour in order to breath.,Although I have never had a problem with antibiotics_ I had such a terrible reaction to Macrobid that I thought I might die. I was terribly ill the whole time that I took it and_ in fact_ stopped a full day early even though I know it is important to take the full dose. It is now 4 days later and I still suffering from nausea and having difficulty breathing and am using my inhaler more often than previously. I did take the drug with food and drank lots of water as instructed but for me the drug was a disaster and I would not recommend it,F,69,6  days,8/2/2009Email,Macrobid

906, 1, Suspected UTI,Difficulty breathing_ chest pain_ high fever (103)_ chills_ body ache_ nausea_ dizziness.,I took 6 days of this medication and within hours of my last pill_ I was having difficulty taking a full breathe and started to feel panicky.  When I managed to get to sleep out of sheer exhaustion_ I woke up an hour later with a high fever.  Ended up going to urgent care within 8 hours of this initial reaction_ and they did chest x-rays and EKGs and worried that I was presenting like someone with a pulmonary embolism.  PulseOx was 91_ which they said was too low_ so off to the ER I went for a CT scan with dye and blood tests.  Doctors refused to consider Macrobid as the culprit_ even though I ended up with nothing wrong with me other than a high white blood cell count and poor blood oxygen saturation!  Sent me home with an Albuterol inhaler and told me I had bronchitis. (Without a cough)  Within 24 hours_ the fever was down 2 degrees_ and within 48 hours_ all symptoms were gone.  It's now 4 days later and I am 100%_ but I am now 100% convinced this was a reaction to the generic Macrobid I was on.  Rest assured it's going on my charts as an allergy from here on out.,F,30,6  days,7/30/2009,Macrobid

911, 1, UTI,Had a 7 day course of Macrobid_ and tonight was the end of day 6.  I started feeling as though I was short of breath tonight_ and it has gotten to the point where it is hard to take a deep breathe without a burning sensation in my lungs....like there is a ton of bricks on my chest!  Six hours after the breathing problem_ I've developed a low-grade fever of 100.3.  Dr. suggested that it was acid reflux and that I should take a Zantac_ but that has  definitely not helped at all...,I'm very healthy and fit...in fact_ I have a triathlon tomorrow I now cannot participate in.  I am at low risk for blood clots or other anomolies_ and based on my reading tonight_ I really think the Macrobid is what is causing my odd symptoms.  I've never had a reaction to antibiotics before_ so this is definitely perplexing.  Thank you for posting your issues_ everybody. *So* helpful.,F,30,6  days,7/26/2009,Macrobid

Tho I finally released 2-3 days of uncharacteristic constipation. BI appears gone_ but talk about overkill! Don't know how long my symptoms will last_ but I sure know what caused them. Typical of doctors! The treatment is worse than the disease!,"I am 5'1"" 57 years old & EXTREMELY healthy_ on no meds. I teach Weight Watchers.

Fast heart rate_ shallow breathing_ body pain_ could not stay awake.,"Took the additional dose that nite_ all symptoms were worse.  Pharmacy said stop taking it and call Dr.  Dr. said it was just my body ""adjusting"".  Day two_ took morning pill (with food) and a Benedryl and had all the same symptoms_ just worse.  Ended up taking another Benadryl and after 4 hours I am finally feeling ""normal"".  I do not believe this is my body ""adjusting"" but trying to tell me ""you're allergic"".  I will not take this again.  I personally feel poisoned and that the medication would kill me before my infection.

Last week I had started this medication again for a UTI.  I had developed an allergy also to cipro so they put me on Microbid again. Same reactions ocurred. Spent 4 days in hospital since my heart rate was so fast.  Now that Im home I thought maybe this was from a reaction. couldnt believe what I was reading! Take this drug off the market!!!!

That was the 11th of June_ it is now June 30th_ still experiencing intense joint pain although a little less severe than earlier. Very weak and still feel compromised in thinking.

924, 3, UTI,Cramps_ Fever_ Chills,I'm so glad I discovered this website. I had my first UTI last week and was prescribed Macrobid (intolerance to sulfa drugs). It actually cleared up my UTI very nicely and quickly (full points there) but I've been feeling depressed_ lethargic_ and 48 hours ago I developed a nasty fever with full body chills. I've been to the clinic twice and was told it's likely a virus unrelated to the UTI_ which has cleared up- I never thought to suggest it might be a reaction to the Macrobid! Just took my last dose this morning so hopefully it will clear up.,F,29,7  days,6/25/2009,Macrobid

Shortness of breath_ pneumonia like symptoms_ night sweats_ chills_ fevers_ severe peripheral neuropathy_ dry cough mostly but at times with thick glue-like mucous_ coughed up blood a few times_ was hospitalized several times with what they thought was pneumonia before being diagnosed with interstitial lung disease or bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia and still no one connected the Macrobid until I began seeing a pulmonologist at a differnt hospital and it was the first thing he said was for me to quit taking Macrobid because it is terrible for the lungs.,My lung capacity went from being normal to having half the capacity. I could breathe normally to having to be on oxygen night and day on 3L. I was totally unaware that long term use of Marcrobid could cause pulmonary problems but it is on the warnings and I feel it should be a bigger warning on the medication so that I would have seen it. It was in the middle to end of the pharmacy's information buried withing all of the usual side effects of medications_ it said if you noticed pulmonary symptoms to contact your doctor because it can cause life threatening pulmonary reactions. I think that should have been at the top in large letters. I would have noticed it and my lung scarring wouldn't have gotten so bad_ now_ I may never recover from it. It has caused deaths and I think it should be labeled differently.,F,43,3  years,6/20/2009Email,Macrobid
928, 2, UTI?,Progressively worse sleeplessness; just a tad light-headed this morning (could be the sleeplessness talking); esophageal gas (chest pains_ alleviated by much belching); more emotional than usual (stress could be cause); mild menstrual-like cramps (could be just that_ today was day 1 of that joy); have finished day 5_ hoping this is it for possible side symptoms (although scalp itches a tiny bit in sympathy for those who have experienced that side),Suspected possible kidney stone (had one four and a half years ago--achiness around right kidney); urinalysis turned up white cells indicating UTI.  Took a day or two for me to pay attention and start taking with at least milk (no major gastro symptoms; expected usual diarrhea due to good bacteria dying with bad but not really all that much of a problem).  Around night #3 experienced sleeplessness (could have been result of emotional upheavals that evening); night 4_ again_ not so much_ but did not sleep well (don't know if maybe the decaf capuccino I requested was not).  Woke up day 5 feeling a bit week_ then light-headed (felt better after a bit of Naked Green Machine).  Night 5 and I am at this site; it's 4:45 a.m. and I've had a wicked hard time falling asleep. The chest pains got me up (gas in my esophagus--scary pain until I belch and it subsides so I know it isn't cardiac--have belched enough for that to go away; have had this problem before unrelated to med--surprisingly_ it was easier to belch this time to eliminate).

But worse to me is my chest is wheezing and tight - it hurts to take a deep breath. I'm hoping that will go away. I will never take this medicine again. I think the company who makes it needs to take it off the market. Look how many people that have had the same problems. What is up with that?,By far the worse medicine I have ever taken - Dangerous.

The nurse told me to continue taking the Macrobid if I could deal with the nausea. I finished the full 7 days and I regret that.  Never before having an allergic reaction to a medication I was too naive and I'm guessing the nurse wasn't informed about allergic reactions.  I should have stopped the medication.  One and two days AFTER finishing the Macrobid severe itching BEGAN!  I called the Dr who told me to take Claritin and avoid scratching; and she said the medication would be out of my body within 24 hours.  Now after 14 days since it ended_ I am still having flare ups if I scratch.  I get large hive-like welts and dark red slashes of swelling where ever my fingers have scratched.  Tight clothing like exercise gear causes severe itching so I can't wear that.  Waistbands_ bra bands_ drying off with towels after a shower will all cause red marks and hot skin.  I did go to my primary care doc who prescribed Prednisone and I just finished my second prescription for that and still itch.  I'll be going back to the Dr again on Monday.  I have to say the itching has diminished over the past couple of days_ yet I still have flair ups.  I fear I've still got a lingering allergic reaction and I am discouraged it's not over yet!

My sister-in-law only found out she was put on Macrobid from my mother-in-laws drug dispensing bill that was mailed out.

Drink gatorade along with water_ STAY AWAY from citric(orange juice_lemonade_ grapefruit juice)drinks or carbonated drinks if you drink these they will further irritate your bladder and kidneys even after you have stopped meds. a least for another month or so.

I'm not selling anything_ I just want more people to know they don't have to suffer like I did and risk the horrendous side effects from antibiotics.D-mannose is a naturally occurring sugar that works bu preventing the E-coli bacteria from adhering to bladder walls and causing infection.  It worked for me.  Period.  It sounds to good to be true_ I know.  Get educated about what western doctors don't know or won't tell you.  Make up your mind based on your own body's results.  D-mannose costs FAR less than antibiotics and FAR less than another trip to your doctor.,F,28, ,5/8/2009,Macrobid

If you are not sensitive to this drug_ which I never was before_ this drug works quickly and effectively. In fact_ as far as the UTI is concerned_ I felt better in that area by the second dose. This time I was shocked by how I felt otherwise and thought I could be really sick (this is during the swine-flu scare!). I am an extremely healthy person and could not imagine why I could be feeling so bad! After referring to this most helpful website I was sure it was the drug.

964, 5, UTI,Took this medication twice- mixed symptoms.,The first time I took Macrobid_ no problems.. cured my UTI and felt better by the end of the 1st day of using it. 2nd time I took the Macrobid_ hands flared up... swollen to no end! I went in to urgent care and after explaining to them that I wasn't on any other meds.. the only thing I did all day was go tanning at a salon_ the doctor chuckled and told me that I cannot tan while on this medication and should stay out of the sun as much as possible. After prednisone to reduce my swelling and benedryl to follow_ he told me to continue and finish my prescription. I did and another success of clearing my UTI. I am now on another round of Macrobid (by request)_ after having 2 recurring bladder infections where the doctor prescribed cipro_ which never completely cleared up my 2 UTIs which began in Jan of 09. I think that everyone will have their own experiences with Macrobid obviously_ but there are a lot of precautions that you MUST take while taking this medication for it to be a success. Swelling WILL most likely occur if you spend enough time in the sun while on this medication_ or warmer temperatures. You have to follow the instructions_ don't drink coffee if you can avoid it... I drink a cup in the morn as opposed to my usual 4-5 cups throughout the day while I'm on macrobid_ and PLENTY of water following (Water is key to flushing this out of your system.. keep a water bottle by your side while getting rid of a UTI.) So far I am doing fine with this medication on my 3rd round,F,38,3  days,3/20/2009,Macrobid
965, 1, Bladder Infection,On day 6 I developed an allergic reaction.     I currently have had a RED HOT Itchy Rash and Flare ups of Hives for the last 10 days.,On March 4th I started taking Nitrofura Macro.. which is generic for Macrobid.  I took the antibiotic for 6 days and on the 6th day I developed a hive on my arm_ and then a few more on my stomach and then later that night they were covering the front of my torso.  I woke up the next morning_ covered from the tip of my head to the soles of my feet in Hives.  And not just any small hive... these Hives were actually Welts the size of dinner plates in some cases.  My skin turned Red and Blotchy all over_ and I headed to the doctor that afternoon.The doctor recognized my reaction immediately as an allergic reaction to an Antibiotic.    She advised me to quit taking the drug and she prescribed Prednisone for me_ and advised that I take Benadryl.     I spent the next 7 days taking Benadryl every 3 to 4 hours and started out on 60 mg of Prednisone per day and weaned down to 20 mg per day.  On Day 6 of my treatment_ I developed Hives in my throat and the roof of my mouth_ and decided to go back to the doctor out of fear that my throat was swelling on the inside.   I was prescribed an additional 2 weeks of prednisone and an EpiPen.     Today is day 10 since my first hive_ and I am still having flare ups of hives in all different places of my body.   I have to admit that the hives are not as intense as when this all started_  but it is still ITCHY.. and driving me insane!,F,30,6  days,3/19/2009Email,Macrobid

Twice for natural childbirth with no medications or sedatives and no epidural_ and the third time was within 4 hours of taking generic macrobid.

After several days the hives slowly subsided_ leaving bruising all over my body. It is almost 3 months now since the experience_ and I am still getting small hive attacks and itchiness.,It was an allergist who made the connection for me_ as I had stopped the antibiotics so many days earlier. I had had these giant hives 3 other times over the past 10 years. He had me check my antibiotic history with the pharmacist_ and sure enough it was Macrobid every time. This time was the worst_ and I honestly wondered if I could die.,F,58,3  days,3/5/2009,Macrobid

This is the third time that I'm taking it. Several months ago_ it worked fine (I just felt sleepy). The second time_ I think it started to help my UTI_ but it never eradicated it_ but thats possibly due to not taking them for long enough.

980, 3, chronic recurring UTIs preventative,I used the generic for Macrobid as a preventative and treatment of UTI's for about 2 years.  After a year and a half I started getting hives about 8 hours after taking a macrobid pill.  It took me a while to figure out.  At first I would take it at night and wake up with hives_ which I mistook for some kind of bug bites ALL over my body.  It happened at my mother's house_ my house_ my partner's house and finally when I took it in the morning and the hives showed up in the evening I knew it was an allergic reaction to the macrobid.  My hives never lasted more than 3 hours at a time and did not always happen when I took the macrobid.  I learned I'd developed and allergy and that with time my allergic reaction(s) could become more severe.  I have also been exhausted for the last 2 years_ but the exhaustion could be due to a general decline in health and other things like problematic sinuses.  I am a smoker_ so I don't know if the worse condition of my lungs and respiratory health over the,Macrobid worked for me_ till a year and a half when I developed an allergy.  It was really great to be able to have sex_ take a pill and not wake up with a UTI.Now that I have reported the hives to the Dr_ I've been taken off the macrobid_ and now I don't know what I am going to do_ because I am sure my UTI will be back by tomorrow.  I no longer have any antibiotics and the Dr says other antibiotics will cause yeast infections_ and have higher risk of even worse side effects.  I'm back at square one and have to manage somehow to go in and give a urine sample when I have an all out infection.  I have also developed an allergy to all the creams for yeast infections.  So next time I am given an antibiotic I will have to take several doses of diflucan to combat a yeast infection_ and each dose of diflucan is hard on the liver and kidneys...which have already had a beating with 2 years of macrobid use.,F,26,2  years,2/17/2009,Macrobid

I munch on cap'N'crunch). I do have slight heart burn from the pills but every thing gives me that. my last pill will be weds morning. as long as I don't have any of the weird allergic reaction a lot of these other ladies experienced ill be fine and im not going pee every 20min which is a plus!,F,26,7  days,2/8/2009,Macrobid

I am not aware of any drug allergies and these are the first hives or reaction I have experienced.,This did seem to work for the UTI symptoms but I had one day of Cipro before switching to this antibiotic.  I was switched off of Cipro because I was told Macrobid was safer for pregnancy.   After 3 days of taking it I started to develop an itchy rash which got worse the next day.  Stopped taking it after the fourth day and on day 6 the rash seems to be slightly better.  Not sure if it's an allergic reaction to the medication or something else.,F,33,4  days,1/26/2009,Macrobid

I originally went to the Dr. about ovarian pain. The only thing my GP and I can seem to come to_ is this medicine and can you believe it says Allergy to sulpha drugs ON MY/IN MY OB/GYN CHART ? Thank goodness my G/P had the presence of mind to take me off; I still had 2 more days I was supposed to take. But what can you expect from my OB who clearly took no time to refresh his memory about me...he asked this client after say 4 visits over 3 years if I'd ever had Children!!??  That answer would be no. I'm not surprised he missed this and needless to say_ he's been fired.  And know for all you folks out there who didn't/don't/won't complain; they'll never get any better about such things if they don't feel some pain.  And as so,F,49,6  times,1/26/2009,Macrobid

Then on day 7 I developed a rash all over my body (no itching).  My fever would not subside and my rash got worse_ so I ended up in the ER where they pumped me full of steroids and benadryl.

The painful stomach cramps can be annoying_ but I found that I got these less often if I took the medicine with both a full meal and a glass of milk. I think the milk helps to coat your stomach. I also took acidophilus tablets at the same time_ but was instructed by the pharmacist to take it as far away from the macrobid as possible. So I took macrobid_ 4 hours later took the acidophilus_ then another 4 hours later took the macrobid again.

It'll eventually go to my thighs_ abdomen_ arms_ underarms_ neck_ back_ scalp_ and ears_ which will become red and bumpy (hives) once scratched. Absolutely every part of my body gets unbearably itchy -- not all at once_ but one itchy body part at a time. It almost feels like having a million mosquito bites in one spot.So anyway_ these past 3 experiences with Macrobid I have had to go to the ER because the discomfort was just too much to handle.

I HATE MACROBID!!!!,F,23,2  days,9/16/2008Email,Macrobid

1049, 5, UTI,None,I was TERRIFIED to take this medication after reading the reviews here and avoided using it for a few days hoping my UTI would go away.  I had to take Ativan before my first pill.  However_ it turned out that I had no side effects.  I think it's important to remember that when somebody has a neutral_ or good_ or only mildly bad_ experience with a medication_ they often give little thought to the drug and thus don't think to review the medication online.,F,27,5  days,9/12/2008,Macrobid

1052, 1, uti,extrememly sore legs and joints,Was given this medication by the ER and have been on it for a week. I started experiencing horrible body aches_ mostly in my legs though. I called my Dr. because I thought it may have been something else_ but didn't put two and two together until talking to a friend of mine and she reminded me that my daughter had an allergic reaction similar to mine when she was on an antibiotic. After finding this website I am certain that this is what is causing my pain. I just called my Drs office and told them I was no longer going to take it and if they wanted me on something else than fine. I would not recommend this medication to anyone_ the pain is not worth it.,F,30,7  days,9/10/2008,Macrobid
1053, 1, To Prevent UTIs,Itchy scalp_ face_ and pretty much my whole body.  My throat also started to close.  Hives. Nausea.  Weakness.  Headache.,I am allergic to sulfa and am trying to find out if this drug contains sulfa.  My Doc instructed me to take one pill (generic - nitrofurantoil macro) each time I have sex to prevent bladder infections.  I always had to take it at night so I could sleep through the nausea and weakness.  I have been taking this medication for over a year now.  About a month ago I started to itch and thought it was laundry detergent or lotion or shampoo.  Each time I took one it got worse over a series of a few times so I realized it was the medication.  The last time I took it I broke out into hives and my throat started to swell.  I had to take a benedryl.  My friend is a nurse and said I could have the reaction for up to 48 hours and to continue to take benedryl for the 48 hours.  It took about 36 hours to go away.  The nurse also told me that each time you take something you are allergic to_ the reaction becomes more severe_ which is why the reaction started out gradually.  I will never take this agai,F,31, ,9/9/2008,Macrobid

Then on day 4_ I started feeling miserable_ like I got the flu. Since these were all listed as side effects_ I finished taking the whole perscription.  Hopefully now that I'm not taking it anymore_ I'll start feeling better...

I went to the ER and received Epidrine - this happened three times before they determined it was a reaction to Macrobid.,I am also allergic to Sulfa drugs and would strongly caution anyone with Sulfa drug allergies to avoid this at all costs.

Before my wonderful fiancé found this sight for me_ I was thinking one of two things:  I had the flu _ a UTI_ and a chest cold or I was dying.  I had intense chills_ a high fever_ nausea_ diarrhea_ and severe pain in my joints (hands_ feet_ wrists_ hips_ legs_ ankles) to the point where I could barely walk or even function.  I also had severe lower back pain and a tight chest that felt like a chest cold_ sneezing_ and coughing.  No rash yet but I'm waiting for one...,I am allergic to just about everything.  I tried taking sulfa drugs before and broke out in a rash around my face.  I also tried taking Cipro and swelled to the point I was almost hospitalized.  At this point_ it seems the sulfa drugs are the lesser of the evils.  I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this site.  I thought for a second I was going crazy.

So i decided to go natural and went to a health food store and got a bottle of D-mannose by now and took 3 pills 3 times a day_ with sugar free cranberry juice_ 1000 vitamin C and tons and tons of water. UTI was gone in a day! I made sure that I stayed away from alcohol_ caffeine_ soda and sugar ridden foods...I feel dumb for not resorting to the natural way first.

Started vomiting shortly after. Also became itchy on hands and scalp. Violent ab pain which led to the runs. It was like my body just rejected the pill totally and it was getting rid of it. I knew I was having an allergic reaction and managed to get a benadryl down. That helped the itching to subside. Eventually my body got rid of it and now I just feel like I have been hit by a truck!

I highly recommend this.I saw a suggestion here to drink a full glass of water with every dose. I highly recommend this.I always have a half cup or full cup of yogurt (with the active cultures!) when taking a dose of an antibiotic.

I called an on-call nursing line_ since it was Sunday. The nurse said that I should take my temp & either go to the ER that day or wait until Monday when my GP's office would be open. When I took my temp_ it was 101.5. It's a good thing I went to the ER. By the time I got to see someone_ I was vomiting. When the labs on my blood finally came back_ my white cell count was over 18_000. The dr. finally ordered a chest x-ray_ which showed pneumonia. By the time the x-ray results were back_ I was freezing. The monitor I was on showed that my blood pressure was dropping quickly & they started me on an IV immediately. I wound up spending 3 days & 4 nights in the hospital.

Thought it was Spinal Meningitis. If this site allowed it_ I would rate this drug a ZERO!!!,I have taken Macrobid in the past with no problems. This time_ I had taken 5 doses (100 mg_ 2 x day) when I started getting sick. I felt like I suddenly had a really bad flu and a deep cough_ but it quickly progressed to the point where I thought I was dying and my husband was in the middle of dialing 911. I should have let him_ but I figured I would wait until the morning to see if I was feeling any better.  After 48 hours of pure hell_ I finally started feeling better and got some sleep. Now I am just dealing with the extra pain from the original infection_ plus the soreness in my ribs and abs from all the vomiting.

After taking the medicine for 5 days (out of the 10 day prescribed duration)_ she went for a blood test to find a reason for her other symptoms. Her liver function tests were dangerously elevated. The doctor was talking about doing a liver biopsy. I went online to research this drug and discovered that it has been linked to elevated liver enzymes. After stopping macrobid_ subsequent blood tests showed her liver function tests gradually decreased and returned to normal about 6 weeks later.,,F,18,5  days,4/11/2008Email,Macrobid

On the 5th day of taking macrobid (7-day dosage)_ I developed red bumps/blisters on my hands_ feet and legs - very itchy and red.  I stopped taking macrobid and visited my doctor.  He suggested I stay off and see if rash eased.  I have been on Zyrtek and applying hydrocortisone cream to affected areas.  I have been off Macrobid for 4 days and my rash is easing and the blister bumps appear to be fading today as I write this.  I will see if it heals next few days.  I will never take macrobid again.  I have taken other antibiodics and never experienced any side affects.,My doctor told me macrobid (generic) is very gentle and they give to pregnant women.  It wasn't gentle to me.

I took the first pill that night and woke up the next morning feeling like I had not slept at all.  I was so lethargic and kind of out of it.  As the day progressed_ my nausea got worse and worse.  I took a total of three pills in two days_ the last one last night.  This morning I was feeling so sick and nauseous that I came late to work.  I have had one UTI before and was prescribed Bactrim which had far fewer side effects_ at least for me.  I never want to take another macrobid pill.  I can barely function today.

I took the full treatment of Bactrim and decided to take the rest of the Macrobid as the doctor must have been right.  Once again about 6 hours latter the same results.,Doctors need to get themselves educated about what side effects are with ALL medications.  It is true they are PRACTICING physicians and some of them don't know a hole in the ground from a hole in their head.  Also_ Macrobid is not cheap_ if a doctor screws up he or she should be held 100% responsible for all cost not only for the expensive medication but the cure as well and their office charge should also be reversed.  The good ole USA has some really serious health issues that are going to have to be addressed and this is one of them  Don't tell me for one minute that doctors and drug companies are not working together to promote these new_ expensive and dangerous drugs.  Doctors getting a kick back at our expense or our lives?  Something just has to change and change soon.  Why is it that there are no specific dates in the internet as to when drugs are first introduced?  From now on I am insisting that my doctor give me nothing but OLD proven mediations.,F,59,1  days,3/8/2008,Macrobid

I was prescribed Macrobid generic and took it for 7 days but the UTI was not cleared up so I was given an RX for another week of Macrobid.  During both  weeks of taking macrobid generic I had days of feeling really awful_ like I was coming down with the flu.  The second round of macrobid cured the UTI.  A week after I finished the second round_ hives started appearing in the middle of the night on one inner thigh.  I thought it was a mosquito bite until I got up in the morning and realized that the itching was widespread and actually hives.  Benadry and Zyrtec barely touched the itching_ it was intense and felt like I was being bitten by fire ants.  The hives spread until they were virtually all over except for the soles of my feet and my mouth.  I was miserable.  It is now the 7th day of hives and they are not as intense but I'm still on Benadryl and Zyrtec.

Eight hours after taking Macrobid I got extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. I went to work and could barely stop my eyes from crossing- I felt like I was drugged. I didn't drive home right away in fear of falling asleep at the wheel. The next morning I had nausea(not associated with the pregnancy) and dizziness.

It is enough to scare me because I have been sick over a month with what the doctors think might be either colitis or IBS. I will find out next week after my colonoscopy. I have also been diagnosed with Mononucleosis. So _ as you can imagine_ I have been suffering a lot from all kinds of pains and problems.  I just cannot believe that my doctor_ knowing all my symptoms still prescribed Micro bid to me! What a irresponsible doctor!

My blood work and such came back fine.  I brought up the possibility that I am having a delayed reaction to Macrobid_ and they agreed that this could very well be what's going on.  However_ there is no way to prove it.  Nonetheless_ reading all of these posts makes me feel very confident that this is what has happened.  It is possible to have delayed reactions to drugs because your body is reacting to the breakdown of the drug as opposed to the drug itself.  The last 4 weeks have been so scary for me . . .

I took a steriod given by my doctor and that helped tremendously.  Thank God for Zyrtec_ which has stopped the itching.,My allergist said it is possible that my hives and itching are from a delayed reaction to Macrobid.

My doctor told me to discontinue use immediately and did not prescribe another in its place; rather suggested to push fluids.  I am taking cranberry supplements as well.  I do not recommend this drug.  Scary!,F,27,1  days,8/3/2007,Macrobid

Had extreme body aches_ fever of 101_ chills_ rash on legs and arms_ red painful eyes.  Luckily a doctor at the hospital figured out that I was having a reaction to this but I still suffered for 5 days.

In addition to the fatigue_ body aches_ and inability to concentrate_ I experienced a severe headache_ fever_ and shortness of breath_ several hours after taking the second dose.  I stopped the medication immediately.  Felt incredibly better the following day.  I saw my doctor two days after stoping the medication and informed him of my reaction to the drug.  My doctor stated I must have been coming down with something viral and insisted that I continue with the medication.  Though I was hesitant_ I took another dose and the side effects returned after 14 hours.  This time the chills were violent_ I could not breathe_ chest pains began_ my heart rate was erratic_ and I was so weak I could not get out of bed.  I was certain I was having an adverse reaction to the drug.  My husband drove me to my doctor immediately.  I was advised to stop the drug.  I felt normal by the fol,F,37,3  days,7/23/2007,Macrobid
1203, 1, Bladder infection,I noticed increased arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)_ after taking the medication for 3 days.  It was so irregular that I noticed it when resting and walking around.  I contacted the doctor the next morning and they advised me to discontinue the medication.  If it got worse they told me to go to the emergency room or call 911.  I was very anxious about the heart beating so irregular.,After reading comments from others_ I would not advise anyone to take this_ especially if you have any irregular heartbeat.  Most of the time I never even notice I have it_ but after taking Microbid_ it definitely aggravated the problem.

1204, 1, UTI,I had taken Macrobid in the past with only mild stomach cramps as a side effect.  It was prescribed to me in March 2007 for a UTI_ and 2 hours after the first dose I felt poisoned.  I spiked a fever of 103.5_ had shaking chills_ nausea_ vomiting_ increased abdominal pain_ fatigue_ severe weakness.  Doc thought bladder infection might be going to kidney infection and advised that I take the next dose.  Symptoms worsened_ and I developed jaundice_ I could not stand without help_ could not eat_ could not lay flat or on my side_ and stools were clay colored.  Blood tests determined my kindeys were spilling bilirubin and I had severe acute hepatitis.  (I did not have a kidney infection).  The hepatitis was a direct result of the Macrobid.  It took 3 weeks for my liver enzymes to return to normal_ and fatigue and nausea remained for weeks after that.  It was the worst reaction I've ever experienced from taking an antibiotic.,Watch out for this drug!  As mentioned_ I had taken this drug once before with minimal side effects.  This is a drug that may not always have the same effect every time.  Scary.  It's now on my list of drug allergies.,F,34,1  days,7/20/2007,Macrobid

But this time_ while it seemed to do the trick for the UTI_ the last day I was on it_ my feet and hands starting itching_ like I had bug bites_ but no physical marks.  Then_ I started to itch other places - it would move around all the time_ never all places at once_ and the itching was SEVERE.  My hands_ feet_ legs_ behind my knees_ tummy_ under arms_ elbows - there were no real physical marks except an occassional bump or two.  I did research and thought I had scabies (ick!) as that was the only thing that kept coming up online.  I had no idea it was related to macrobid_ because it started the last day of my taking it - you would think any side effects would happen right away.  Not so with this drug.

I've never felt so horribly from any medication I've ever taken... as been stated by previous comments_ I feel like I've been run over by a truck.

Eating heavily_ milk and pepto bismol did not help any of the stomach symptoms.  I felt dehydrated quite often during this medication while sleeping; it was not uncommon that I would wake up just to drink something.

These side effects did not occur while taking the generic form of macrobid_ it started the day AFTER my last dosage. Was taking Benadryl which helped somewhat with the itching.  I tried to wait it out for several days from going to ER_ but not only having the hives was driving me nuts_ but I developed sharp pains in the center of my chest with pains started in the left arm. I thought I was having a heart attack but when the next day the pain in my chest wouldn't go away at all_ I had to go to ER in which they did an EKG and I was clear on that but still had the pains in chest and arms aching. ER DR. wrote me prescription for Atarax (anxiety & inflamation of hives) and stated I have Heartburn/Acid Reflux in conjunction with the allergic reaction to Macrobid and gave a a capful of Mylanta and weird enough_ the pressure,Don't think I would recommend this drug to anyone from the scary experience I encountered.

Now home and docter started me on generic Macrobid to treat a potential UTI (no symptoms like elev temp or back pain) pending urine culture results. But after taking only two 100 mg doses with food on the first day_ I woke up at 3 AM with lower lip edema & numbness_ slightly swollen eyes_ and several itchy hives on my arms & legs.  Then_ since Macrobid is a time-released product_ I woke up today with a swollen upper lip_ swollen left wrist (watch band was tight)_ and a couple of more itchy hives on my arms and legs.  Now taking OTC generic Benadryl every 4-6 hrs and it seems to reduce the swelling & itching side effects,I'm 50 yo and until now_ I never have had an allergic reaction to any prescription drug.

Do not stop taking the medication.  It is an indication that the drug is working!  This reaction is called The Herxheimer Reaction.  Please Google it and read.  It's when you take an antibiotic (the RIGHT antibiotic) and it kills off too many organisms at one time for your body to handle.  The many dead bacteria releases toxins into your body and your body is trying to get rid of the toxins.  And until it does_ you will feel that way.  It was only one day for me_ and the next day I felt totally normal. If you have an extremely bad infection_ it could be longer to get rid of all the toxins. I've also read that the breathing issues some people are having is also part of the Herxheimer reaction.  You have to realize_ that this would not happen if you were taking a medication that WASN'T killing the very organisms that you are trying to get rid of.  The increased urination is also your body trying to rid yourself of the toxins.  You,F,52,7  days,4/12/2007Email,Macrobid
1249, 1, UTI,I was the one that said that I felt like I had morning sickness while taking this for 7 days.  Now I started feeling my symptoms again a few weeks later and my bladder infection is back!  I am dreading taking antibiotics again--also yeast infection now as well--  I was prescibed Bactrim and am scared to take it for the 3 days based on the ratings.  I hate taking any medications anymore.  I agree that the side effects seem to be worse than what they're treating.  Ugh!!,,F,36,7  days,4/11/2007,Macrobid
1250, 3, UTI,Lighheaded_ tired_ sore throat_ difficulty breathing_ high fever 103_ all over aches_ headache_ rapid pulse.,I took all but the last 2 pills and then all of a sudden SEVERE side effects occurred. I felt faint_ had difficulty breathing_ had a swollen throat_ high fever 103_ and felt so weak I couldn't stand upright without slouching. The UTI cleared up_ but the side effects being so severe_ is not worth the risk to ever take this med again. Shortly after the above mentioned symptoms became less severe_ I developed an acute sinus infection so bad that I lost my sense of smell COMPLETELY for 7 days. It was so painful_ my head felt so much pressure that the headaches would wake me up. I am now on Augmentin for the sinus infection which is working FINE and I read that Augmentin clears a UTI as well_ so next time I will just ask for that. I rated this med_ somewhat satisfied_ because it cleared the infection just fine_ but the side effects honestly had me terribly worried.,F,39,6  days,4/6/2007,Macrobid
1251, 3, Bladder Infection,Initially took Bactrim. Had severe migrane with that med and was switched to Macrobid generic. Abdominal pain_ mild back pain and still frequent urination with little to no output at times.,Well_ this is my third day on the drug.  Still have symptoms from before beginning meds.  Haven't had any of the horrible side effects others have listed.  But am not better either.  Going to return to doctor and see what he thinks.  After reading this website I am both thankful and scared.  Have already missed 3 days of work and school_ and am a single mom of a special needs child.  I can not afford to be sick or suffer long term damage to my kidneys!!  Thanks to everyone who took the time to post on this website.,F,43,3  days,4/5/2007,Macrobid
1252, 5, Bladder infections,None,Have been taking Macrobid or generic for years with no side effects. Took for bladder infections and also preventatively occasionally before or after sex when I thought it might cause a bladder infection.  Last couple bladder infections were really bad and decided to start taking Macrobid every time I had sex to stop the infections.  Have been taking Macrobid pretty much every day for a couple months with no issues.  Have a check-up scheduled with my doctor soon and will discuss health issues with her.  Everything I am reading here has me really worried that I may be doing something to my body that I am unaware of!,F,45,5  years,4/4/2007Email,Macrobid
1253, 2, ,Adding to what I just posted:Forgot to mention that also while taking macrobid_ that in addition to the horrible headache_ vomiting_ diarrhea_ stomach cramping_ and rash that I also have something going on with my heart rhythm that's worrisome. I have PVC once and a while but last night they were almost constant for quite a while...almost went to ER.,,F,, ,4/1/2007,Macrobid
1254, 2, UTI,First dose at dinner. Vomitting and diarrhea by 9:30 PM followed shortly by pretty bad headache. Not much sleep for the night. Day two I had bad cramping_ bad headache_ diarrhea_ dizziness_ restlessness and felt alternately chilled and then hot. Had to keep taking meds for headache that was constant w/o medication. Had trouble thinking. Day three is better in some regards but thinking still an effort and headache relentless. Some cramping and rash on buttocks. Still have symptoms of UTI which really ticks me off since I'm going through so many side effects from the macrobid. Hoping that in the end it will at least take care of the UTI...can't wait to call doctor Monday morning and see if there is something else I can take rather than this drug from hell.,Not worth going through all the side effects especially if it's not clearing the UTI,F,58,3  days,4/1/2007,Macrobid
1255, 1, UTI,Severe hives from head to toe_ intense skin burning and itching on hands and feet.,Finished 7 days of Macrobid.  Worked wonders for the UTI.  Had also been taking Aleve for a few days.  Next morning took 2 more Aleve but within an hour developed hives beginning on neck_ lower back.  Progressed to all over body_ except face.  Eventually_ any thing that touched my body would create a breakout--clothes_ self_ steering wheel.  Claritin and Prednisone are giving precious little relief.  The last two nights I have been a heartbeat away from a trip to the ER_ but am riding this out.  This is day four with no subsiding of symptoms.  Don't know if this is due to Macro or Aleve or both.,F,52,7  days,4/1/2007,Macrobid

It seems to have helped the UTI_ but I can't function for 5 more days like this. I hope there is a good alternate drug.

I began taking Bynadryl and applying Cortisone cream 1%.  Helped some with itching_ but rash contiunued to expand head to toe.  Severe itching!!,I am on my way to the ER for help with my side efeects.  I have never had a drug reaction before and this is terrrible.  My UTI did clear up_ but this is an unacceptable price to pay.  This drug needs a BIG warning.  I have also felt my energy zapped the few days.  I work out daily and I am dragging.  I expect an IV drip of medication when I get to the ER.  Wish me luck.,F,54,7  days,3/23/2007,Macrobid

1265, 4, UTI,Took nitrofurtantoin macro (generic) after reacting badly to Cipro (severe muscle pain & mental fogginess)_ so I was feeling bad to begin with.  I usually get sick from all antibiotics and have to be taken off them_ but this is my 2nd time taking nitrofurantoin  -- I had no trouble with it last time_ and this time it has given me lighter side effects than most other drugs. First couple of days_ I just felt like I had low-grade fever and was starting to come down with a cold_ but that passed after a couple of days.  After each pill_ I had some dizziness_ tiredness_ and was depressed & felt emotionally unsettled right after taking capsule_ but it would subside if I didn't think about it.  I slept a little more than usual_ was more tired after work_ and it was a little harder to wake up in the morning_ but once I got going_ I could function during the day. Nausea didn't start until a few days in -- it was bad for first hour or so after each pill_ but would get better_ especially i,"Remember to drink extra water with the pill and during the day.  This stuff works by passing through your urinary track_ so you have to help it along. Also take it with food.  And I found milk helpful.  I haven't been retested yet_ so I don't know if I'm ""cured""_ but I feel better than I did a week ago.

I got the generic Nitrofur and about 3 days into my treatments of 2 pills daily I started feeling very ill.I experienced horrible headaches_nausea_ dizziness_ and trouble breathing.,The worst part of this medication for me is definitely the headaches and dizziness. I have one more pill to take and for the past few days I have been scared to take the pills. I notice the symptoms within 30 minutes to an hour. The only good thing about Macrobid is that it has worked surprisingly well for me other than the side effects. My back pain from the kidneys is gone_ and so is my stomach pain. I get UTIs often but I will not take this medicine again because the side effects have kept me from work and class.,F,23,7  days,1/26/2007Email,Macrobid

I am on my 4th day of antibiotics and they didnt start working to relieve my UTI till yesterday_ i hope the UTI stays away and this darn flu/cold goes away!,Even if it works in the end these kind of side effects are just aweful. I mean i had to take Uristat (UTI pain relief) along with the antibiotics and cold medicine. I thought that maybe the mixing of drugs could of caused it but the docter said no and specifically gave me nitrofurantoin mono capsuls because i was going to be taking other medications.

Finding none_ they ran blood cultures which thus far are negative.  She was off the macrobid for two days (and put on another antibiotic by IV).  Fever slowly subsided and she was released.  On doctor's orders_ she resumed the Macrobid.  Took two more days and fever_ extreme diarrhea and incoherence returned.

1323, 1, Generic for Macrobid,4 days after I stopped taking the generic for Macrobid I broke out in burning itchy hives. I've never had an allergic reaction to anything before. 5 weeks later_ I'm STILL getting hives. I'm sooo glad I found this site! I've been online all night researching what else could be wrong with me. I stopped taking the medication 5 weeks ago and have had hives for over 4 weeks. They're slowly getting better but I still get them every day and all over my body -- even my privates! I've been to the dr. and she confirms it's an allergy to Macrobid. I'm going back tomorrow to see what else she can do to alleviate the hives. I've also had mild swelling in my throat but that's mostly gone now. In fact_ the first time I was at the dr. she said I should never take macrobid again because my reaction was so strong I was likely to go into anaphylactic shock if I took it again. I'm just so glad to learn I don't have lyme disease_ toxic shock syndrome_ or something worse. Thanks to everyone else for your p,Take Cipro instead. Macrobid is toxic.,F,32,7  days,9/5/2006,Macrobid

The next day symptoms came back_ worsened through the next 5 days_ Doc told me it couldn't be UTI cause she didn't see any bacteria. Saw a DIFFERENT doctor after a week's misery_ who said I had a bad UTI. I knew it!

Macrobid has been prescribed for 20+ years and is generally widely accepted by patients.  Remember_ your doctor went to med school - not these pharm reps whose main goal is to sell their product.

Stopped taking medicine but was still very tired all the time and lymph nodes on the back of my neck swelled up and hurt. One week later experienced an intensely itchy rash from head to toe_ that would randomly flare-up and subside a bit_ then flare again. Also_ had the worst acid reflux I've ever experienced in my life.

I am a very healthy and active 34  year old woman and I have never responded to an antibiotic is this manner.  Now I am sitting here wondering how much longer I must endure the itching and if this is adversely affecting my unborn baby.  Stay away from  MACROBID.....especially if you are pregnant.

Bad headache and dizziness and almost passed out.  I called the Dr. and told them she was experiencing every side effect except for the rash.  Her skin even hurt.

Itching will appear at odd times and in diffrent places.  Have almost gone to the ER several times_ but then the syptoms pass. Hope this doesn't go on too long.,Terrible drug.

As the day progressed_ so did the problems. Loss of appetite was followed by a SEVERE cough that came on quite suddenly.  By dinnertime I had terrible chills (101.2 fever) and felt so nauseated I didn't bother to take the 2ed daily dose of Macrobid (was instructed to take it with milk or food). Spent all of Saturday in bed and didn't take any Macrobid because I still felt so bad. By Sunday a.m. I was feeling a little better so I decided to get out of bed and take a shower. Wasn't until I got my clothes off and got a look in the mirror that I realized my body was covered with HUNDREDS of hives.  Some were small_ others were really large and looked like a bull's eye. A friend of mine (an R.N.) said she'd never seen such a bad case of hives and advised me to tell my doc never to prescribe Macrobid for me again. (In all fairness,F,53,5  days,5/19/2006Email,Macrobid

I had a very high fever_coupled with raging chills_ massive headache_ muscle cramps_ aching joints and shortness of breath.

Apparently E.Coli was responsible for my UTI which turned into a kidney infection (a complete culture was done on my urine) and apparently E.Coli is responsible 90% of the time - and Macrobid is not effective against this particular bacteria.

Also_ remember that MOST people who come to report about their experiences with drugs on the internet are doing so because of a negative experience they have had.  Those who take the drug with no effects don't typically research it online and make claims against it.

1403, 1, Urinary Tract infection,I am pregnant and got a UTI. Dr prescribed Macrobid.  I started Thursday night and it was fine.  Took again Friday morning_ still OK. Friday night after the night dose_ I suddenly felt flu like symptoms.  Chills_ fever and joint pain.  Next morning_ I started spotting_ as it seems to be miscarriage.  I still took the morning dose of Bactrim. Had sever pain in stomach_ very sharp pain.  I could not stand my Pj or anything on me so much I could not Breathe!! I thought those were the cramping and pain from miscarriage. I also got episodes of on and off chills... I suddenly thought of possible side effects of the MACRObid and called my sister who is a Dr_ and she said to stop immediately any dose of Batrim. She said it could be fatal the next time I get one. I followed her advice and thank God_ the stomach pain subsided and no breathing problems. I am stopping it and adding it to the list of allergies I have.,My Advice is to STOP immediately as soon as you suspect any type of allergy to the medication. The next dose you get could be fatal.

1462, 1, UTI,I had used macrobid few times before for UTI. This time around after 3 days of treatment I woke up with extreme swelling- eyes swollen shit_ hands_ feet. I went to the ER and got a shot of benedryl which I have been taking ever since. One day after the ER swelling began to go down but hives broke out from my scalp to my toes. I itch beyond belief and they are not going away quickly. All I can do is take benadryl and take Aveeno baths as I am pregnant.,Be very careful if you are hypersensitive to antibiotics.Any signs of a reaction get immediate attention_ as symptoms get worse before they get better.,F,37,4  days,2/6/2005,Macrobid

It has made me much sicker than I would have felt without it.  After being home from work for two days -- I tried working today and had to leave soon after taking the second pill for the day.  Needless to say I am flushing the rest of them down the toilet. I am now researching natural remedies for bladder infections - as I will NEVER again trust an MD prescribed antibiotic. It's a shame that it seems too many drugs are released for public use in America these days with such toxic and dangerous side effects!,F,49,3  days,2/3/2005,Macrobid

A lot of people are damaged by this drug. It is dangerous and not worth the risk. I take 1 tsp D-mannose powder every 3 hours if I feel the twinges of a bladder infection starting. So far it has worked for me.,F,34,5  days,1/15/2005Email,Macrobid

1471, 1, UTI,1 week after completing medication I began to experience an allergic reaction-dermographism that was extremely itchy. Benedryl was marginally effective. My Dr prescribed a stronger antihistamine that worked for brief periods_ but the reaction was just as bad when I ceased taking the antihistamine. It's been 5 weeks now. The Dr denied that it was a reaction to the macrobid.,Two years ago I had taken this medication and shortly thereafter began experiencing joint pain which I never attributed to the drug...it's persisted on and off over the 2 years. When I began having the skin reaction_ the joint pain disappeared. I am pursuing treatment through natural means now...taking antioxidants and having energy balancing_ which seems to be helping. The medical option was steroid treatment_ which was unacceptable to me.,F,46,7  days,12/17/2004,Macrobid

If you are having a reaction_ drink as much water as you can stand and eat plenty of foods rich in antioxidants as they are the only way to remove this stuff (macrobid is a free radical) from your system.,If you have any history of allergies to medications_ DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. I am allergic to pennicillin as well. Use Macrobid only as a last resort if other antibiotics fail. The incidence of serious side effects is much higher than my doctor knew. I am only thankful that I did not die_ as several people have from this drug.,F,31,4  days,11/28/2004,Macrobid

1476, 1, UTI,I felt sick to my stomach the whole time I took it and my chest hurt a little bit. On the 7th day of taking the medicine I had an asthma attack and had very itchy feet. It has been a little over a week since I stopped taking the medication and I recently had to go back in to Urgent Care because I was breaking out in Hives continually from the medication. I have yet to have relief from it and assume that it will be like this for a couple of weeks.,I would say that if this drug is suggested try another because after reading all the other comments about it the side affects really aren't worth it.

I was due to take the med 5 days. I finished it and two days later my urine culture came back indicating I needed a couple more days of it. When I took the first *new* pill I had the flu symptoms occur within hours. The cough and chest tightness were particularly upsetting. This is when I realized it was the medication. I stopped it immediately but that was two days ago and I still feel ill. It seems to have worked on the UTI but don't know for certain yet. I don't recommend this medicine. It's side effects cause as much discomfort as the UTI.,F,47,6  days,10/6/2004,Macrobid

Broke out in total body hives from my scalp to my knees_ face puffed all up and  I got very hoarse.  Hives itched beyond belief! Had to go to the emergency room_ where I was given a strong antihistamine and a cortisone shot.  This worked for about 12 hours_ but the hives came back. Saw my Dr. and got put on a 1 week course of cortisone pills and even stronger antihistamines.  I had taken macrobid about 2 times before this_ without any reactions.  Now I am seriously allergic and can't take it at all.  Very scary!!,It did a good job of curing the UTI's_ very quickly; until I became allergic to it.  I can never use it again_ and it scares me to use other antibiotics.   I had a milder reaction to taking Bactrim_ with a smaller_ less serious case of hives.
