1, 1, synthroid,listen stop bitching to the fda when you get a good pill and fill a little hyper... stupid idiots that means its working.. or would you rather be half dead trying to walk and just get out of bed.. shut the hell up when the pill gives you a boost that means its working ...idiots!!!!! synthroid working like that is what it is supposed to do ...give you energy dumb wits!!!! I mean those who are complaining to the fda and then they turn around and take preciouse hormone out cuz of dumb fucks like the ones im describing ... stop complaining when you get a boost that means you got a good dumb clogs... you keep setting the rest of us back with the fda taking hormone out because you are soo stupid and don't know anything about how the drug is supposed to work... if you get a boost of energy that means the pill is working ok dim wits!!!!!!!! your the reason the pills do not work any more cuz you bitched to the fda not knowing enough and they took very important hormone out... so stop being idio,energy or a little hyperness is a good sign your pills are working???? and a good healthy strong heart as well... quit bitching to the fda when this happens it means stupids that the pills is actually working and your not dying dumb asses... what you don't want is too slow a heart on pills and not enough energy... are we clear??? so be fricking happy when you get a boost of energy and you can feel your heart a little bit and strong because that is health back from your pills working ...I don't want to hear this ignorance of stupidity amoung uneducated thyroid patients who don't know shit!! complaining to fda who then goes and take half the important hormone out of you of you big dummbies not knowing that the pill is doing its job if you feel energy and a strong pulse dumb clogs,F,48,27  years400 1X D,7/31/2016,Synthroid
2, 4, hypothyroid,super potent refill March 2016= hyper!,I was switched to Synthroid in 2013 when Levoxyl was recalled.I have heard from doctors that Synthroid is the best and most precise dose amounts.  Overall good experience.  But I evidently got a super potent batch from March 2016_ took 8 pills and went hyper_ jittery_ sick_ dizzy_ etc. Opened a different bottle of Synthroid I had refilled this month and after 3 days_ the hyper symptoms have calmed down.

7, 1, Hashimotos,My symptoms never improved and I gained 30 lbs within 7-8 months of starting it. Also_ my face had continued to blow up like a balloon. I looked like a chipmunk when I smiled. Last but not least_ I couldn't lose any weight_ even though I went gluten free_ ate fresh fruits & vegetables_ and walked/ran 3 miles daily.,After being off synthroid for 10 days (my own doing_ not my dr) before starting Armour thyroid_ my face already looked like I had lost 10 lbs. After a week of eating more food than I normally would have consumed_ though still not overeating_ I lost 1.2 lbs without even being on the treadmill. So_ while some may do great on it_ some don't. Ask for Armour thyroid if synthroid doesn't work. It has T3 and T4 whereas synthroid only has T4.,F,41,3  years100 mcg,4/5/2016Email,Synthroid

11, 1, hypothyroid,I am hypothyroid and taking high does been taking this dose for a year half and ok till feb. wonder why? synthroid patent expired and drug companies can change them.,What people need to know is this. if you will listen to me? I am a sufferer like you. you have to complain to the FDA and have your dr do it with you. I recently talked to them. They say no one is complaining. YOU HAVE TO COMPLAIN TO FDA NOT YOUR DR? he can't help you. The reason? FDA TOOK ACTIVE THYROID HORMONE OUT OF SYNTHROID AND LEVTHYXNE. they claim only 5 percent but you do the math. the pills before 2013 were 90 to 110 percent potency/ FOLKS YOU HAD MORE HORMONE THAN U DO NOW! Now the pill is 95 to 105 percent potency and falling 74. percent. People! that is bad! We need more hormone. You have to tell FDA you want a form to have your doctor insist FDA go back and put the adequate amount back in . 90 to 110 percent or nothing will happen. They were going to change it back to 90 110 if there were enough complaints but yu guys need to complain or they will stay this miserable pathetic lack of hormone pill. Im trying to get us together and educate all so we can fight and bring back the amount back in our pills. So people don't just send medwatch? You have to get form from fda and ask they send you the form for to increase hormone to 90 110 percent back again and have your dr agree and fill it out and then send it back to fda. if doctor does't_ go to another one. I feel like crap> help me and you feel good again and do what I asked for you and me so we can get this fight going.

14, 1, underactive  thyroid,Well at first i gained a lot of weight (70-80 pounds)_had sisnus problems_headaches_loss of sex drive_ no appetite numbers still not right and just the feeling of being miserable and depressed and twice my age. Then 3yrs later with my numbers still way off they decided to raised my doseage and when they done that my symptoms had gotten worse. Bad anxity_anxiousness_headaches_reallyenergized_chest tightness_ heart palpations_sinus problems_ nervousness_real jittery_loss of sex drive_ no appetite feeling depressed and my thyroid glands are very swollen now.,I started taking levo. 88mcg (which is generic for sythroid ) in 2012 for about a year and it wasn't working.so they had me switch to the name brand sythroid 88mcg and it didn't do much better I had gained about 70-80 pounds had bad headaches/sisnus problems_loss of appetite_ no sex drive and my numbers didn't get any better.So here we are 21/2 yrs.later nov.2015 almost 2016 From first starting on sythroid in 2013 they changed me to 100mcg I gained like 7 more pounds in a 6wks time frame and my numbers went up again way above average and my thyroid glands is also swollen so they decided to up my dose to 112mcg in feb.2016 and they also did an ultrasound on my neck and im waiting on the results for that. But while I'm waiting ive started on this higher dose of sythroid  112mcg and im havin more symptoms on top of the ones I was already having so now not only am I having the headaches_sinus problems_ loss of sex drive_ weight gain_ no appetite depressed_ numbers still high_swollen thyroid glands etc... but iam also now having bad anxity_anxiousness_heart palpations_nervousness_energized_ chest tightness and real gittery and worrisome.

24, 4, Hypothyroidism,I have been on Synthroid for well over 13 years. It's a good product if you know how to take it. I've read many articles and books on the subject. I've tried generic and will not do that again_ it is not as effective. I've tried it with a lower dose accompanied with Cytomel and that was too much for me. I've tried natural thyroid ( Armour Thyroid) and that just about gave me a heart attack. It took several years to get the dosage right and it never has seemed perfect. I sweat constantly and I have tsh levels that are teetering on hyperthyroid instead of hypothyroidism_ so in the summer months my dosage has to be lowered and in  the winter it goes back to normal. I have a crazy appetite on it_yet if I go one day without it i have major bouts of crying and anxiety. I'm obviuosly hooked for life. My teeth have one by one been replaced with crowns due to calcium/bone loss_ maybe due to this med?!I have a super tough time losing weight and never had that problem until I got on this med. I'm always hot or too cold. I get the worst pms and sometimes debilitating headaches but only if my body is saying that I'm getting too much. Listien to your body and not lab tests. It's overall a good drug though and better than the alternative. I have perfect blood pressure. Perfect blood work. I sleep good. I'm 38 with little long thick hair and long nails ( all signs of a healthy body) good vision. I sometimes can't think good and I do have attention issues. Sometimes my chest hurts with exerti,I recommend it but talk to your doc about adding Cytomel or adjusting dosages. I also recommend taking selenium and zinc to help aid in function.

After I felt well_ same on dose 25 mkg. But after 1 month since I increased my dose of Synthroid till 37_ I faced all bad things which I wrote in the column near. Its began from terrible hair loss and finished with terrible apnea_ anxiety and panic attacks. Worst thing is apnea_ anytime I begin to sleep I don't have enough air_ so I basically don't sleep now just few hours in the morning. The really worst thing that no doctor would connect these symptoms to Synthroid_ so even me I began to believe that its ok. But the symptoms are still there and are worse now. Thanks God I met one doctor who said first thing to do is to stop Synthroid_ if after 10-12 days symptoms are gone than its side effects_ if no_ search another reason. In case if I still require Synthroid to try another brand because the same medicament can affect people different. Some people can tolerate it normally_ some people would have side effects.Already for this advice I am very thankful to doctor and hope it will help somebody.,F,29,6  months37 1X D,6/20/2015,Synthroid

My hair falling out is about 15 hairs in the shower now_ and I feel normal.  My labs are still on the low side_ but in normal range.

Not only did it do nothing for my symptoms_ the side effects were much worse than not being on medication at all.  So_ I researched natural treatments and made lifestyle changes.  Started using non toxic products free of endocrine disrupting chemicals from personal care_ cosmetics_ and household cleaners (fluoride_ chlorine_ bromine_ sodium benzoate_ etc.)_ stopped eating gluten_ dairy_ soy_ refined sugar_ preservatives or anything artificial_ started taking vitamins like A_ B_ C_ Zinc_ and selenium_ and drinking tea with ashwaghanda_ don't heat food in plastics or cook with nonstick cookware (Teflon is also toxic)_ and began practicing kundalini yoga.  After making all these changes_ I started having hyper symptoms so I started cutting my 125 mcg pills in half.  Was still having issues_ so asked my dr to switch me to a desiccated_ which he did but at too high a dose.  He decreased the dose once_ but it was still too high_ so he tried to put me back on synthroid despite my objections and complaints of side effects.  So_ I stopped taking all meds and started seeing a new doctor.  Was off all thyroid meds for a good 6 months and was doing ok except that my skin was dry.  Now I'm on 15 mg of desiccated thyroid_ continuing with the new lifestyle and doing great.  At least now I know NEVER TAKE SYNTHETIC HORMONES AGAIN!

When  I had a surgery go real wrong in Sep 2010_ the nurse noticed after a week that I never ate that much.  she told me she had patients that bloodwork showed normal but synthroid didn't stop them from gaining.

Ive been told that this is normal if youre not able to convert T4 to T3 very well (Synthroid is a T4-only med)_ so Ill probably require the addition of a T3 medication or at least the natural dessicated thyroid which contains both T4 and T3.

I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism when I was 15 years old.  I did well on the medicines until I started having children and more after I had my Total hysterectomy.  Since then I have gained 50lbs_ and no matter what diet I have tried_ weight watchers_ atkins_ low carb_ low fat_ south beach_ and even not eating I still gain weight.  I never lose.  Within the last year everytime I try to take my synthroid I get extreme fatigue to the point it is difficult for me to function.  Within 12 hours I usually experience a horrible panic or anxiety attack and just generally feel like crap.  I discussed all of these symptoms with my Endocrinologist_ whom made me feel like I was a complete psycho.  She said that none of that could be caused by the medication and she actually asked me ""what I wanted her to do?""  My answer to her was you are the doctor and that is why I am here.  I dont have a medical degree to treat myself_ if I did I would not be where I am now.  She told me just to start the meds again and fight through the side effects and for no reason should I stop it.  Well that was easy for her to say because she is not the one having all the problems.  I stopped it several times and the symptoms go away and then when I try to start it again they come right back.

Yes_ confectioner's sugar is in your Synthroid  pill!  After only a few days_ my breathing had gotten so bad that I started searching for anything in my diet that had changed.

Two more weeks went by and my morning symptoms had evolved into constant post-nasal drip_ tightness in my throat_ difficulty breathing_ asthma_ and frequent headaches. I went back to the hospital to complain about what I thought were the side effects of the Synthroid- a different nurse practitioner saw me and came to the same conclusion that I had seasonal allergies with some asthma resulting from them. She put me on two more medications for allergy and an albuterol inhaler. Now taking four drugs_ my symptoms got worse_ not better.

With the birth of each additional child the thyroid would become more diseased.  During my pregnancy with my 3rd and 4th child my thyroid level became normal without medication which baffled doctors.  During a 3 year period I was on a thryriod rollercoaster going between hyper and hypo.  About 4 months after having my 4th child I began having hoarseness.  Endo did blood test that showed my body produced the antibodies that caused graves disease and hashimotos (spell?) disease explaining my rollercoaster thyroid levels.  One morning I woke up unable to utter a sound.  After 3 weeks of not being able to speak my Endo finally saw me.  Endo kept telling me I did not have thyroid cancer only a severely diseased thyroid and referred me to an ENT.  First visit to ENT looked down my throat and located the thyroid mass that had gone through the wall of my larynx and scheduled a full thyroidectomy.  Had thyroidectomy 21 months ago and finally have good blood work and feel the best that I have felt in 2 years.

With Armour they just kept increasing it and I felt some change but not significant. Finally a doctor told me there would be no difference between it and synthroid_ so I went on synthroid. Again_ my dosage just kept going up without a significant improvement. It turned out just recently ( and I figured this out ON MY OWN and had to basically tell my doc what I wanted her to do)_ just the T4 couldn't be converted by my body into sufficient T3 (my TSH was indicative of this_ as it was in overdrive)_ so I needed cytomel (i.e.T3) added to the synthroid and now I finally feel good. I am now on 112 mcg synthroid and 5 mcg cytomel twice a day. HAving said all this_ my current endo has admitted that basically Armour is a natural combination of T3 and T4 (i.e. synthroid plus cytomel) and I think once I am at the right level I will go on it again_ just to see if it works as well. I am also looking into alternative ways of healing myself as I do not want to spend a lifetime on synthroid and I am becoming more and more suspicious about the absolute need to take synthroid.

After beginning synthroid_ I stopped gaining weight and felt better. 1 year ago_ I was re-tested. My TSH is high_ T4 low and T3 really low.  My dosage of 50mcg was increased to 75mcg. My doctor said synthroid stops fooling the body over time and dosage must be increased. Also_ synthroid doesn't replace T3. It turns out I have iodine deficiency - iodine helps your body change T4 to T3. I now take more iodine and feel better. My physical and TBI rehab began 6 months ago and my exercise level dramatically increased. I feel in my gut that as my body gets aligned and my exercise and diet improve back toward where they were before the collisions_ the synthroid necessary for my health before now feels like a blockage toward my thyroid healing and producing the correct amounts of hormone on its own. Has anyone else had the sensation that it blocks production? I discovered that the horrible aches in my joints_ especially in cold weather_ can also be caused by synthroid (osteoarthritis).

Much better now.,"I read a comment that said something along the lines of ""weight gain be damned_ I will not use Synthroid""....Is that some kind of joke? That hypothyroid just causes weight gain and it's not big deal? Unbelievable. It's important to stay on your hormone replacement. If it doesn't work_ stay on it until you find a suitable replacement. Seeing as I was born with this_ it isn't something I take lightly. Some people are so ignorant. Also_ Synthroid sponsors doctors people! That's why it's still being prescribed.

249, 4, Total Thyroidectomy - Cancer,Night sweats_ trouble concentrating and trouble getting out of bed,I had my thyroid (along with one parathyroid since it was engulfed by the tumor and seven lymph nodes) removed a little over a year ago due to papillary thyroid cancer.  I was required to receive RAI after the surgery so I did not start my dosage until about 8 weeks after surgery.  I started with 150 mcg per day and this was a bit too much for me so I actually take 150 mcg per day for 6 days out of the week and 75 mcg one day out of the week.  I also started with the generic brand.  I had to go off of my meds for ~5 weeks to do a full-body scan to make sure that the cancer was all gone.  During those 5 weeks I felt increasingly worse being off my meds.  Upon restarting my medication_ my doctor switched me to Synthroid because it is easier to regulate since the formulation is constant (unlike generic).  This switch was made because my husband and I are hoping to get pregnant and it is easier to keep a tight window on hormone levels with the Synthroid than the generic (just in case others are curious...because if your levels get too hyper_ since you have to be kept hyper post-cancer_ there is a higher potential for miscarriage).  So far everything is going well_ but it's been almost a month since my scan and my body is still recovering from those 5 weeks that I was off of the meds prior to the scan.  Being off the meds was awful for me; I believe Synthroid is a godsend_ especially once things get levelled out.

Had the right side removed 90 days ago due to another cold nodule and a goiter_ having pressure on throat_ wheezing when sleeping.  Went to an endocrinologist who had no empathy at all.  Insisted I use Levoxyl - had a very bad stiff neck and headaches from that not to exclude the brain fog - I can handle most of the other symptoms but not that - I need to think clearly and couldn't. Then asked for Synthroid (he didn't want to put me on generic because he felt the dosage was too off).  I stayed on that for a month before surgery and then for 1 month after surgery when I decided I needed to try something that would not give me the brain fog.  Had been on generic before and didn't have problems from it. Called him_ talked to his assistant (waste of time ) and he never called back.  Talked to primary after that and she will prescribe but I do need to do the tests after a month.  Will do.  Brain Fog is gone _ feel so much better.

I am not sure if I had negative side-effects on Synthroid after two years_ but I know that my mood and energy levels got worse over time.  It may be dosage related.  There are many doctors out there_ though_ that stick too much to test results rather than how you feel.  The Thyroid is such a powerful organ and regulates so many things in your body such that when it doesn't work properly_ you can get depressed_ gain weight_ have more pain_ increased appetite_ etc._ etc.  If you don't like your doctor or how you feel on Synthroid_ see someone else for another opinion.

269, 2, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis/Hypothyroid,Anxiety_ muscle weakness_ shakiness_ some tingling in hands and feet_ additional fatigue and depression,This is my second trial of Synthroid. For my first trial_ I took generic levothyroxine (25 mcg) for approximately 3 weeks. Symptoms did not improve_ muscle weakness was terrible_ anxiety led to panic attacks_ and toward the end of the first trial_ I experienced extreme joint pain in hands and feet. Endocrinologist recommended that I try name brand Synthroid (starting on lower dose) because I may be sensitive to binding agent in generic brand and/or I may be sensitive to medication in general. So far_ I have experienced similar symptoms (with less tingling in hands and feet)_ but anxiety_ depression_ fatigue are not going away. In fact_ those three symptoms are worse than prior to both the first and second trials. If symptoms continue_ I will stop taking medication_ as Free T4 and T3 are still within normal range_ but TSH was high at 7.8. I have signs of hypothyroidism and TPO antibodies are >1000_ but Synthroid may not be the best choice for me. My next step will be to find an endocrinologist_ Naturopath_ or other to prescribe natural brand (e.g. Armour Thyroid). Many books and websites suggest that natural brands may work better for people with sensitivities/side effects from taking synthetic brands and/or T4 to T3 conversion issues because they contain both T4 (inactive) and T3 (active) thyroid hormones_ in addition to other hormones (T2 and T1).,F,31,5  days12.5 mcg 1X D,6/29/2010Email,Synthroid

Doctor insisted the Cytomel wasn't going to help_ but finally agreed to prescribe 5mcg Cytomel 2x/day.  First 2 weeks were great and most of these symptoms disappeared_ except for no results with weight loss.  I was actually gaining again.  So I decided to come off the Synthroid and stay on the Cytomel to see how I feel on that regime.  It has been 5 days w/o Synthroid and just Cytomel.  I feel great so far.  I might have to convince my doctor to increase my Cytomel dose on the next visit_ but anticipate a struggle as he didn't want to prescribe it in the first,Having thryoid disease is a woman's curse.  Even more frustrating is dealing with doctors who go off your lab results versus how one actually feels. And to top it off_ they will tell you it's all in your head as you fight to feel human!

Four years ago a surgeon almost talked me into having my thyroid removed because of the enlargement of my neck.  I thank God every day that I decided not to have it removed and I went for a second opinion.  I didn't need my thyroid out.  My regular physician then increased my dosage to 100 mg and I have been experiencing terrible side effects ever since.  I had also taken singulair for a brief time and thought I was going to commit suicide.  It was the most horrible medicine I have ever taken!  For the last four years I have been looking for something to help my thyroid.  I am now on my way.  My chiropractor started Nutrition Response Testing in his office.  It's the best thing I have ever done.  I have been taking Thytrophin PMG and Prolamine Iodine for my thyroid and it is working to strengthen it naturally.  I had my bloodwork done this week and my PCP called me today to decrease my synthroid to 50 mg.  My goiter is going down.  I don't remember having these side effects from the synthroid when I started out at the 50 mg so I researched to find the ingredients in the different synthroids.  The 50 mg has no color additives nor does it contain any Aluminum Lake.  The other one's all do.  This might be the ingredient that causes so many terrible side effects.

The dessicated hormone gave me horrible palpitations and sleeplessless_ likely due to the fact that it's T-3 rather than T-4. Thyroid medication is tricky_ and requires an endocrinologist who knows (and cares) what s/he is doing. Many of the people who have posted here give me the impression that they are either not on the correct medication_ or their dosage is off. Not everyone can tolerate the natural thyroid_ nor does the synthetic work for all people. I react negatively to so many meds_ I was extremely worried about this one ... but so far_ so good. This is the first time I've felt like a whole human being in years. I can sleep_ I have energy_ I'm not freezing all the time_ I'm not anxious_ I can think straight_ the palpitations I had on Nature-Throid have gone away_ my joint pain is fading_ my appetite is better (and now I don't have to starve myself to keep from gaining weight_ which is fantastic).

I thought I was crazy when I would forget my pills for a few days and start to lose a few pounds. Then I surfed the web and saw how many people have GAINED weight! So_ I decided to go off the levythyroxine until I lose 20 lbs and then I'll go back on it and maintain that weight!

It got so bad that I went to an ophthalmologist and he told me I had Chronic Dry Eye Symptom.  I was prescribed Restassis for this condition which I was going to probably have to be on for the rest of my life.

Get lab tests every 3 months for the first year - if it stays okay_ then the following year do every 6 months - then a few years after that you probably only need a test annually.  Your body makes/decreases its own thyroid hormone_ so if it can't be regulated easily_ it may not be the medicine_ it may be your own body.  Symptoms such as hair loss_ dry skin_ etc. is a sign that your levels are off and you need a test to readjust your synthroid.

I felt great after having thyroid desiccated for 4 weeks. After that my life has been hell. Being on this drug I have had every side effect from brain fog to memory loss to fatigue to blurred vision. In the last few months it has become so bad I am at risk losing my job because I can no longer concentrate while driving because I get dizzy spells and cannot focus mentally and optically.

I have a wife and a daughter that I must support and through recent research my wife and I have concluded that the best path may be to visit a homeopath. If you are considering taking this drug (synthroid) DO NOT!!! Most doctors do not even acknowledge the Amour brand because they stopped teaching its use in 1975!!!! This Synthroid is garbage and the doctors and the Knoll Company are making profits every single time someone has issues with their thyroid. People are losing years and their livelihood while some jackass is laughing to the bank.

Having my thyroid removed I need to have some supplement.  The couple of weeks that I had to go off synthroid after my surgery but before my scans were awful so I am glad to take the synthroid. I have had a number of symptoms but it is hard to tell if those are related to synthroid or to removal of my thyroid - some of both I expect_ and I don't think it is reasonable to expect a daily pill to work as well as the thyroid gland. I also had nighttime muscle cramps but added a daily supplement of magnesium and potassium and that went away. The only side effect that presents significant issues to me is screwing up memory; I have a high level white color job and it does negatively affect performance to some degree.

Was told in 2006 no natural form or replacement was available for those who are without a Thyroid Dr. Says labs are fine. Not sure if PCP knows how to read? So for years they(Derm._PCP_Surgeon_OBGYN) have blamed most of my complaints on my Depo or activities-  Then I got off Depo in April. My sex drive has come back x's 10 but_ now my problems seem increasingly worse and easier to identify. I'm getting dissy and disoriented (sometimes when driving and I can't speak as I try to regain focus). I kept blaming my mental dedgrigation and recently developed communication problems on changing job types. I just feel sick all day everyday. I do try and eat healthy(rarely eat beef_ drink well water) and get a good amount of exercise so I have no weight gain complaints. Pretty much everything listed is happening to me though.Took all kinds of shit for acne for many years_ negative results. I refuse to take another med to counter the seemingly toxic reaction I am experiencing from prolonged use of Synthroid. I asked my Dr to switch over to Armour but_ apparently he does not like it.  Does it work for total replacement or should it be used in conjunction with something else to be effective?

328, 3, Hypothyroidism,Insomnia_ mild muscle cramps_ headaches_ extreme confusion,I was started on Levothyroxine (generic) when first diagnosed.  After 1 week_ I experienced headaches_ forgetfulness and felt like I had gained weight on either side of my neck.  My doctor took me off for one week and reintroduced Synthroid at the lowest dose.  I've been on it for 3 weeks and will retest to see how it is doing.  So far I am experiencing extreme insomnia_ extreme memory loss_ occassional headaches_ experiencing dry skin again_ mild muscle cramps and occassional fatigue.  It may either be an allergic reaction or not enough dosage.  The medicine has helped with the extreme fatigue_ regulation of monthly cycles (with the help of birth control) and at first_ dry skin.  I'm not sure that losing my memory is a good trade off at this point_ but will continue to work with the doctor or perhaps see an Endo.

Wish I were one of those who ""confuse symptoms with side effects.""  That's not the case with me.  I have been under the care of a cardiologist for over a year.  There is nothing physically wrong with my heart_ but clearly I have some palpitations due to thyroid disease.  On synthroid_ I go into atrial fibrillation.  I've been taken to ER three times in a-fib.  I started at 100 mcg and had the problem.  Moved all the way down to 25 mcg...STILL happened.  Endocrinologist and cardiologist are in agreement that I have a sensitivity to synthroid.  Fortunately_ my thyroid levels are in the normal range for now.  However_ my thyroid antibody tested positive_ which means more likely than not_ the hormone will get out of control again.  I'm not on Synthroid anymore and have my TSH tested every three months.  We are working on another plan of action for me if something happens again.  I hope I'm not totally screwed.  :(So_ for all of those who insist that it's only a symptom_ not a side effect...it is very possible to be sensitive to Sythroid.",F,49,3  months,12/26/2009Email,Synthroid

I complained of tachycardia with the .75mcg. My doctor took a blood test and said that my levels were normal_ but agreed to lower my dosage anyway to .50mcg to address the tachycardia. After three months_ I complained of hair loss_ dry skin_ irregular menses.  My doctor took my blood_ palpated my thyroid and said that my levels were normal and to come back to her in a year. She is one of the best endocrinologist in Miami.  I understand that my levels are normal on paper_ but I really feel like this drug is killing me.

It not only did not help my hypothyroidism_ it made it WORSE! My hair started to fall out by the handful_ I was freezing all the time_ and my exhaustion became almost debilitating. My TSH showed some improvement_ my T3 & T4 not much improvement at all_ despite the dose. Thankfully doc put me on Armour Thyroid which saved my life. I would NEVER take a synthetic thyroid again!!!!",Synthroid is a synthetic thyroid replacement_ it contains T4 only. This is unlike others that contain both T3 and T4 thyroid hormones. This is a very important point because the body must convert T4 into T3 to make it useable. Of course the body must be able to actually use the thyroid hormone to improve health and eliminate symptoms. If the body can't convert or use T4 what's the point? Others out there contain T3 & T4 so there's useable T3 in addition to the T4 which needs to be converted. There are also natural alternatives which are sooo much better than synthetics. HUGE DIFFERENCE!,F,40,2  years,12/7/2009,Synthroid
336, 5, hypothroid/hashimoto's,none,It seems lots of people confusing symptoms with side effects here. symptoms of thyroid disorder not disappearing because of your dose or how you are taking synthroid. take in am with water (not juice milk etc)_ do not take with antacid_ vitamins_ and take at least 1 hour before eating. It makes a world of difference in how the medication works when I follow the simple instructions that the pharmacy puts on the bottle for me. A bad part about synthroid is the odd dosages. make sure your doc is looking at TSH_ T4 AND T3 bloodwork and do it every 60-90 days to get a good look at ALL THREE - a Vit. D and Vit. B-12 panel cant hurt either ESP if fatigue keeps you indoors and you feel pain when touched in legs and arms. Encourage your doc to think outside the box if you seem like you are on and endless teeter totter of dosages.  I take .300mcg 1 day a week and .150mcg 6 days a week.  It works well and skin_ hair_ sleep and other symptoms aren't an issue anymore. Weight is also coming off now with about 1-3 pounds a month with minimal exercise and 5-6 pounds a month with 1 hour cardio a day.Remember it's not just up to a pill to magically cure you. You have to help yourself with this disorder; you have to be just as proactive watching your diet and excercise (no one is going to do it for you)_ and be proactive with your doctor and don't be afraid or feel inconveninced if you have to find a new one.

I am on .150 and I am considered hyperthyroid_ but generally I do not feel good and require a lot of sleep.  My mood is somewhat flat.   I have tried to get all my doctors to consider Amour thyroid.  But I think the makers of Synthoid have all the doctors fooled.  I wish the doctors would not just rely on a TSH number but ALSO take into account how a patient feels.

I have gained an excessive amount of weight on it while continuing to exercise 6 days a week and eat healthy. My stomach makes me look pregnant_ it has gotten so big and bloated. I used to weigh 133 lbs and am well over 150 now. The joint pain is awful (I am barely able to make it through a workout). I used to have clear skin and now have acne breakouts and have just started to lose my hair in significant amounts. All after just six weeks on this stuff. Do your research before starting this drug. I learned I could not tolerate this stuff the hard way. I was willing to believe everything the Endocrinologist said about this medicine making me feel better.

Switched to brand synthroid and that completely disappeared.,This drug is absolutely necessary if your thyroid has quit functioning properly.

400, 5, Thyroid disease,None,This medicine is a first-rate quality product.  Its consistency factor (important to those who really do have thyroid disease) is far superior to anything else.  Thats why it trumps products made before its time and gets prescribed more than any other.

If youre already on it  stay on it.(And dont be fooled by the disturbing internet marketing of second-rate so-called natural products - that involves the bashing of all synthetic medications and that is conducted by those who really should be seeking other types of help...)Stay safe and be well.,F,, ,4/5/2009,Synthroid

My endo said two important things - you must use brand over generic because generic brands are unregulated. Meaning_ there could be different (slightly) levels of levothyroxine in each tablet. Those swings in dosage can really throw you off.  Second_ when treating cancer_ it is important to keep me slightly hyperthyroid. This will keep whatever remaining thyroid cells inactive. We don't want our cancerous cells to work harder and generate more cancer cells!,F,37,4  years,2/3/2009,Synthroid

498, 5, Hypothyroidism,"Nearly all the ""side effects"" I see listed are actually caused by the thyroid problem itself.","I have been taking synthroid for nearly 20 years. My family has a history of thyroid problems dating back for at least a century. Thyroid problems can cause issues ranging from dry skin and constipation to fatigue and weight gain when your thyroid is low to jitters_ goiters and heart palpitations when the thyroid is high. It takes a while for thyroid medicine to fully kick in and then you have to closely monitor yourself and get a followup blood test to see if you are at the right level. If you feel ""off_"" it's likely that your does is not correct. I also have found that I don't feel as well when my thyroid numbers are a low normal as opposed to an average normal. Doctors should move through dosage levels slowly. It can be dangerous to have an overactive thyroid. It is particularly important to watch your thyroid levels when pregnant.

In the last several months I have gained 20 pounds while eating and exercising at the exact same level as when I was losing weight. So I reduced my caloric intake and exercised more and still gained.

506, 4, hashimotos,,I had increasing trouble with insomnia_ heart palps_ sweating after first taking the drug.  I thought it was the Synthroid but it turns out that Estrogen levels are affected by increased thyroid hormone.  So if you have low estradiol when you start the drug_ it will just make your estradiol level even lower and give you all sorts of symptoms of peri-menopause or menopause.  Once I started on sufficient estradiol supplement the insomnia_ sweating_ heart palps_ muscle pain went away.  I don't think many doctors realize the link between estradiol levels and thyroid levels... that caused me a great deal of trouble.  So any ladies who have trouble when they take thyroid hormones should check and make sure they have adequate levels of estradiol before giving up on them.

518, 5, Hashimoto's disease/hypothyroid,Took a few months and a trip to endocrinologist to get right dose.  Found out I have to wait 12 hours after taking synthroid before taking any mineral supplements (calcium_ iron_ magnesium)or fiber supplements. Before that_ I was taking the supplements too close and blocking the synthroid!!!!  Also_ found out I need to avoid soy-- if I eat it (and it is in a LOT of foods) soy blocks the effectiveness of synthroid,It's been a few months since I started synthroid.  Dose had to be upped a few times.  Went through extreme fatigue_ hair loss_ and neck and muscle pain before getting to the correct dose which is making a WORLD of difference in how I feel.  My sense of smell is returning now_ at 75 mcg synthroid.  Also_ I do not have constant muscle pain.  Have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in past but now on synthroid_ that pain is leaving.  Also_ had major depression but on synthroid that is improving immensely_ too.  I did not experience these radical improvements until I got on the correct amt of synthroid and stopped taking vitamins/minerals/iron too close to medication.  Avoiding soy is making a huge difference also.  My new endo is willing to give me Cytomel if this dose synthroid doesn't help me enough.

This may be a contributor to the relatively early appearance of osteoporosis.,"I was shocked to read that people are taking Armour Thyroid. Are they aware that this medicine is derived from pig's thyroid glands?(it says on the website ""porcine"" for the source) This is what physicians used to use before synthetic thyroid was invented.  Its great downfall is that it is much more difficult to create accurate dosages of the medicine because the amount of thyroxine may vary from animal to animal.

I started the medication on December 5th_ and in 18 days I've gained an astonishing 16 POUNDS!!! I haven't changed my eating patterns at all and the weight just keeps piling on. This completely contradicts my FNP saying that the Levoxyl would help my metabolism speed up to help me LOSE weight. This is incredbily discouraging since I lost 40 pounds last year and had kept it off for a year. Now in less than a month 16 of those pounds are back.

I know what they say about not swapping manufacturers_ but I have not had any unstable levels taking the generic levothyroxine (whichever manufacturer Walgreens decides to use that month). I take 150 mcg per day and have my TSH/T4 levels checked every 6 months_ and they have been stable for years without any dosage changes. It's a very important medication that you will need to take forever more than likely if you have hypothyroidism. Great_ necessary med for those of us that have to have it. Best to take same time every day_ on an empty stomach_ and without taking any other meds with it.,F,36,7  years,8/21/2007,Synthroid

This is not a matter of bottom line profits or curing a disease with one pill; this is a matter of people's quality of life and sometimes their life or death.  Not every medicine fits every person and it would be ridiculous to make such an assumption_ but that is what is happening.  It is difficult to find a doctor who will prescribe anything other than synthroid or it's competitive synthetic counterparts.  Abbott Laboratories should be ashamed of themselves for their tactics of pushing this medication above all others. I expect this behavior from a tobacco company_ not from a company who holds so many people's lives_ and quality of life_ in their hand.  I am too young_ smart_ and healthy to feel this bad from this medication.  I personally am on a mission to push my doctor to find what is right for me or leave this medicated life altogether.

My doctor isnt interested in natural cures_ so I have found a holistic dr to go to.  Drugs cant be the only answer.

I get tired_ start to gain weight and hair coming out more.  I go to my doc and get bloodwork done.  One time years ago I did this and my doctor said my levels were fine and he wouldn't increase my Synthroid_ but I knew how I felt. I switched doctors and told my new doctor how I felt.  She agreed to increase my Synthroid but wanted me back in six weeks to make sure we didn't over do it_ which would cause other problems.  The increase helped and I learned that if my levels are in the middle of the normal range_ then I don't feel good.  But if I am in the high normal range_ I am fine.  Everyone is different and if you've suffered hypothyroidism_ you know your own body and its signals.  Find a doctor that will listen to you and work with you.

What's amazing is_ my stomach doesn't hurt after I eat anymore.,In 1999_ 2000_ & 2001 doctors didn't know if I had Hypo. I was told my levels were fluctuating. Since 2001_ I have gained 35-40lbs that I just can't lose - even though I eat like a bird and exercise regularly.

All cause brain fog and all cause weight gain_ so it's hard to separate which is causing what.  After reading the other comments_ I'm wondering if this drug is doing more harm than good for me_ especially since NObody else is taking it for hypertension.  My hair isn't falling out yet_ but I'm not sure I'd notice since I feel so blah.

582, 1, Hypothyroidism,For many of us Synthroid alone will never work.  Synthroid has only T4_levothyroxine.  Your body is supposed to  convert some of that T4 into T3 but in some of us it doesn't.  Then you must take a separate pill which contains T3_ or_ take a pill which contains both T4 and T3 such as Armour Thyroid or Thyrolar.  Armour is animal thyroid_ while Thyrolar is synthetic.,"I have had doctors_ including one endocrinologist_ insist that my TSH_ Thyroid Stimulating Hormone_ can be brought down with Synthroid alone.  Many months of my life have been devoted to Doctors ""adjusting Synthroid dosages"".  It is amazing the number of doctors who have argued with me about this.  I have been taking throid supplements for about 30 years.  It isn't something new.  The best medicine for me is Thyrolar. The Thyrolar website tells you that their pill contains one part T3 to 4 parts T4 and it works for me.  Unfortunately it was on backorder and I am currently on Levothyroxine (T4) .075 MG along with a separate pill of Cytomel (T3).025 MG.  It was too much and I cut the Cytomel pill in half.  I hope to get back on the Thyrolar soon.  The Thyrolar is measured in Grains instead of MGs.  I take two grains daily.",M,83,6  months,7/8/2007,Synthroid

Have any of you experienced miscarriages and had it corrected just by changing the strength of your medication? I have read several articles on line saying to get pregnant and maintain a pregnancy_ your levels should be between and 1 and 2. Do any of  you find that to be true? Let me just tel you_ I had a son prior to being diagnosed w/ hypothyroidism. I never had these problems til I began taking Synthroid. I hate this stuff. I believe it is the root of all evil or maybe I am just not on the correct level. I have not actually seen a specialist. I am in the process of trying to get a referral.

It was after about 5 yrs. that I started getting stiff.  I could not make a fist or even snap my fingers_ rolling over in bed or pulling up the covers was almost impossible.  I could not even lift a gallon of milk. Getting on the floor was a threat to life! I was tested and considered for Fibromyalgia_ Lupus_ Rheumatoid arthritis among other things. We were rethinking the whole thing_ when my husband told me to check into Synthroid. I had been on this medication for 12 years_ the numbers were always good_ so doctors (and even we) didnât give it much thought.

It takes several missed doses to get your levels messed up_ but for me it's a side-effect of the medication_ that one missed dose can mess up my physical being again.Remember to keep checking your thyroid levels_ as the dosage may need to be slightly altered up or down as you change as a person.,M,43,2  years,6/28/2007,Synthroid

589, 4, hypothyroidism graves,Slightly upsets my stomach,Everyone who just stops taking this medication all of a sudden needs to stick with it. Want to know why you feel like crap when you first take it? Your thyroid stops producing T4 and T3 because you are replacing its function with Synthroid. So at the onset you actualy become more hypo then you were until your levels level out. Please do your research before stopping your medication and deciding it's not working. A lot of people feel worse when they start taking Synthroid_ it originaly completely messes up your metabolic function while you adjust your dosages_ give it at least 6 months_ the benefits long term if you keep on it and constantly tweak your dosage are better then being constantly hypo (leading to high cholestorol and heart disease). Also_ take B12 and Vitamin D as being hypo is proven to make you deffecient in these vitams. B12 def. has the exact same symptoms as hypothyroidism_ so try a vit B suplement if you still don't feel right_ and get out in the sun once in a while.,M,21,1  years,6/21/2007Email,Synthroid

I haven't really felt ""normal"" for 7 years since the birth of my daughter.",I know this site is to post about synthroid_ but I wanted to make a comment about armour thyroid. People with autoimmune thyroiditis like hashimotos should not take armour and in fact armour will make it even harder to function as it has natural thyroid hormone in it (from pig) and when you have autoimmune thyroiditis_ your body is constantly attacking the thyroid so if you are ingesting natural hormone_ your body will in theory attack even harder making it difficult to aleviate the symptoms of hypothyroidism. I have heard good things about it and am sort of disapointed it didn't work for me. In my case my hormone levels completely reversed and were out of control - TSH 20+_ etc. In general though I haven't ever noticed a complete reverse of my thyroid related symptoms_ synthroid has helped keep my thyroid in a more regulated level (TSH 0.034) and if I have to be on it for life_ so be it.,F,31,7  years,6/20/2007,Synthroid

607, 3, ,,I would like to respond to the patient who has been taking Armour for 3 months.  I have taken  Armour for 14 years and I know what I am talking about!  Armour company does not slaughter pigs_ they slaughter cows.  The medicine is NOT approved by the FDA and any endocrynologist will tell you so.  It is unreliable dosagewise_ it is dessicated cow thyroid then pounded into pill form.  Each dose differs slightly from the previous dose. Our thyroid glands do not produce the same type of thyroxine that cows produce.  Three months is not enough time for anyone to express their opinion about the efficacy of any medication.  One can barely have their dose adjusted in such a short period of time.,F,51,14  years,5/14/2007,Synthroid

610, 1, hypothyroidism,No relief of hypothyroid symptoms.  I feel I must respond to the comments of the person below me regarding Armour natural thyroid medication because there are so many falsehoods presented which are patently misleading. First of all_ Armour is natural thyroid from pigs_ not cows_ and has a 100-year record of efficacy and is definitely approved by the FDA. This can be checked via Google. Armour is also properly compounded and tested for dosage and is prescribed by the 1/4 grain and upward. Armour also replaces T3 as well as T4 (and T1 & T2); Synthroid is synthetic and replaces only T4.,Is is possible the symptoms the prior rater experienced were the result of weak adrenals.  Please see the thyroid reporting by Mary Shomon on About.com and Stopthethyroidmadness.com for further information.,F,52,3  months,5/12/2007,Synthroid
611, 4, goiter,When I took Armour for 14 years_ 180 mg_ I got osteopenia (pre-osteoporosis) at 35.  My heart was fluttering_ I was very thin_ PVC (preventricular contractions)_ MVP (mitral valve prolapse)_ leg tingling_ dry skin_ loss of hair_ insomnia_ hot and moist hands and skin in general_ severe calcium leeching from bones.  Armouris NOT approved by the FDA_ do not take it_ it is dessicated cow hormone_ pounded into a pill form_ uneven dosage.  When I switched to Synthroid I got my energy back_ my bones thickened again_ no more osteopenia_ no more back pain_ headaches_ etc.  It took about a month to come down from such a high dose of cow hormone (180 mg) to 112 mcg of Synthroid and there were some unpleasant sideeffects.  But they went away.  I lose hair all the time but it grows back.  I am 30 pounds fatter_ with no change in diet or activity level_ but I would rather be fat than osteoporotic and dead of a heartattack.,I have been on Synthroid (various levels) for 10 years.

612, 4, Hypothyroidism,Its unclear to me_ but a while after taking the drug I developed some Tinuitis.  I am a chronic sinus suffer so it very easily could be coincendence.  HOWEVER_ this drug is messing with your hormones so expect some changes no matter what.  DO NOT let your physician make large jumps in dosage.  You very well may need to try a few different doses_ stick it out because in the long run you will get your body back in sync.  Again_ you are messing with hormones so listen to your body.  My dosage was moved to fast one time and I became VERY irritable.  If that happens_ go down a dosage and remain there for a while.,Prior to be diagnosed with hypothyroidism it was never clear to me why I always felt tired and irritable.  After starting treatment and reaching the correct dose my life was COMPLETELY different.  I am now a MUCH happier person and had forgotten what it felt like to energetic.  Generally your hormones do not fall out of whack overnight.  Thyroid conditions worsen over a long period of time so it can be hard to notice the affects until its really bad.  My life is 100% better after getting on this drug.  I use the generic form with good results.  I would recommend seeing a specialist during the intial phases of starting.  Internal medicine doctors try_ but they seem to always get the dosages wrong.  Once you are stable and on the drug internal medicine docs should be able to do the yearly tweaking.,M,33,5  years,5/5/2007,Synthroid

Your condition is likely caused by another auto-immune disease that goes hand-in-hand with hypothyroidism_ such as Vitamin B12 deficiency_ etc.  Have your doctor check your Vitamin B12 level - this disease will cause many of the same symptoms as hypothyroidism (such as brain fog_ muscle cramps and weakness_ etc).

I felt normal on the 3rd day of that dose and was of course ecstatic.  Unfortunately_ it didn't last and the muscle weakness returned the following day.  I now have ""brain fog"" along with the muscle weakness.  My TSH was 2.5 after 1 week on the new 50mcg dose.

I am up to .075 and waiting for blood tests results. No matter what the results_ I feel 500% better than I did in the last few years_ especially mentally! Other symptoms tobe attributed to the medication possibly the need to sleep 8 hrs/day. Possibly also temporary dizziness when changing dosage (blood pressure low).

750, 1, hypothyroidism,I've gained 15 pounds since starting out on Synthroid. My hair is dry and brittle and receding. I've been on it for two years. I've been exercising like a dog for that entire time and though my weight fluctuates I have only lost about three pounds. This is with weight training twice a week for an hour and cardio three times a week for an hour. How is it even possible for me to not lose weight doing all that? Something is wrong. I always lost weight easily before.,I don't even understand why I am on it. I didn't have any symptoms of hypothyroidism. I had started exercising that week and felt light-headed (from overdoing it) so I thought I'd better get checked out. They took one blood test_ then another the next week_ and decided I had hypothyroidism. Nothing has improved in any way and now I'm fat. This pot belly can contribute to diabetes and a number of cardiovascular diseases that will be worse than hypothyroidism. The doctor told me my problem is that my thyroid gland dumps everything out at once and I don't have any left the rest of the day. How are they going to know that from a blood test? It makes no sense to me. It's stupid. I'm getting off this stuff.,M,33,2  years,8/29/2005Email,Synthroid

No one in my family has had trouble with thinning hair at this age. I am 55 and this is the only medicine I take.

757, 3, hypothyroidism,Taking Levothroid 75 mcg,I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I began feeling sick all the time. I felt like I had the flu (I guess that would be the bodyaches). It was becoming more frequent and was disabling. My other symptoms: fatigue_ easily gained weight_ an allergy that would swell my eyes shut_ eyebrow thinning_ vitiligo(since age 16)_ depression_ fuzzy thinking_ irregular periods_ joint pain. I thought I was a hypochondriac! Blood work verified low thyroid. However_ I'm always afraid of misdiagnosis. If so_ taking the pill would give me a thyroid problem! Anyway_ the only relief I got was for the flu-like symptoms and the allergy. I don't want to risk those symptoms returning. As for my other symptoms_ they are still a problem.  I even have to take an antidepressant. Also_ I never lost weight. If anyone had similar symptoms_ I'd like to hear what works for you. Please feel free to write to my e-mail.

I lose tons of hair every day_ it is so bad I have to vacuum my bathroom every day. -headaches on regular basis,I had a severely overactive thyroid as a child and docs didn't know what was wrong with me.At 8 years old a doctor finally figured out what the problem was ( and it was not tapeworms as most doctors thought back in the day lol ) Finally at 15 they did not want to give me radioactive iodine because I was so you young but they felt that my thyroid was so overactive and all the drugs known to mankind were not doing anoything they had to use radioactive iodine. Upon giving me the dosage did not get the results hoped for so a few months later they did another dose in Vancouver_ B.C. then of course too much was destroyed and my whole life from then was overturned I have frozen my arse off since I was 16_ gained a pile of weight_ lost tons of hair_ suffered depression_ and am always fighting being tired. I have two boys 13 and 12 and I do a lot of pretending as I do not want them to worry or feel bad....but please if anyone has any ideas on what to do as I have been suffering with this for 20 years and all doctors tell me is quite often people still have side effects when on medication....I am on 112 mcg of synthroid a day. There has to be way more to life than this ......god help me I am sick of this.....,F,35,20  years,1/5/2005Email,Synthroid

815, 1, hypothyroid,Hello again folks. I have great news.I posted here about twqo years back with my symptoms and side effects. Now_ after battling with the side effects of this horrible drug for several years_ I appear to have weaned myself off of it. There are other alternatives!!!Another poster from this message board suggested some enzymes and natural supplements that appear to have it under control. I am cautious about being too optimisitic because of past ups and downs with synthroid but I will make the following suggestions...If you are on synthroid for hypothyroidism and feel like you are never quite right_ have hyperactivity or sometimes just feel WEIRD (I thought someone had slipped me LSD one time when my dosage was too high) try these:Thyroid caps (available at any natural foods or health food store)_ L-Lysine and L-Tyrosine.,READ ALL YOU CAN about this drug. It was never approved by the FDA and manufacturing standards have been lax_ to say the least. It was almost removed from the market several years ago. Read what others have to say about it. Granted_ the drug may work well for some_ but we are all different individuals and what works for one my not work for another.Good luck to all!-Kev,M,49,4  days,11/2/2004Email,Synthroid

818, 1, subclinical hypothyroidism,Weight gain,I began taking Synthroid 2 years ago after being diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism.  I was hoping this would take care of the chronic fatigue I was experiencing.  Supplementation brought my TSH into the normal range but did not help the fatigue and led to weight gain of about 20-25 pounds.  I have good eating habits and exercise regularly_ so the synthroid supplemention was the logical cause.  I decided to stop taking the synthroid and wait for a better alternative to come along.
