15, 4, chronic neck and back pain,"At times I feel unable to focus.  The best I can describe it is like trying to carry on a conversation  while your kid repeatedly says ""dad_ dad_ dad"".  However_ in my case it is often hard to concentrate due to the pain_ so I call it a wash.  Constipation  is a minor problem considering how much it helps.  Also_ when it is wearing off I tend to get irritable for about half an hour so I try to isolate myself when it is wearing off(for me about 8 hours).",I find it helps with the pain but doesn't totally take it away.  I actually like that because it helps keep me from over doing anything.  I still do mind you_ but at least I am aware of it.  I still have my job and without morphine it would be impossible.  I try to take it only when needed or when I am sure it is going to be a rough day.  For example on weekends fishing with my sons or doing any long standing or physical work.,M,39,4  years30 MG er,5/3/2015,Morphine sulfate
16, 4, chronic low back pain,Constipation.was the worst side effect but can be remedied with softeners.,I've been on narcotics for 21yrs due to an on the job injury. 2 herniated disc 1 cracked vertebra and tore stomach wall off pelvic. 12 major surgeries.narcotics had stopped working except for high doses. Percocet oxytocin and the doses just kept getting bigger. I started taking morphine sulfate er 15mg every 12hrs 4 days ago. Doc told me we would have to adjust but we'll start low. What I've found is it does work but my breakthrough pain starts abt 6hrs. So when I go back in 3 days we'll move it up and go to a breakthrough med every 6hrs and I think I'll be able to function as normal as possible under the circumstances. That will take me from 360 pills to 180! I wish it were none but I'll take it.,M,43,4  days15mg,3/26/2015Email,Morphine sulfate

38, 4, failed spine surgery,It depends on how much you take. (see comments),I resisted going on morphine_ but years of anti-inflammatory medication_ Tylenol with codeine 3_ and Vicodin for nerve pain caused severe acid reflux and a bleeding ulcer.  The ulcer healed after a few months of medication_ but I will have the reflux for life.  I was put on morphine on the theory that I could take less of it to get the same effect.  I have been on morphine for seven years.  At first I took only 1/4 tablet a few times a week for flares; and it would put me OUT. My spine steadily worsened;  I am now on a maintenance dose of 15 mg ER/2X day.  I would have no life at all without morphine and a very limited life with it.  I have had some extremely severe flares of pain from my spine and trigeminal nerve pain_ during which I doubled the dose I was taking and still had severe pain.  I went back down to my maintenance dose as soon as possible. At 15 mg/2X day_ I have no significant side effects. I have some concentration problems at times_ but I have that with severe pain as well. I drink lots of water and eat a high fiber diet; and that keeps things moving.  At double this dose_ I have dry mouth_ constant thirst_ loss of taste_ loss of appetite_ constipation_ cognitive problems_ and apathy.  So my feeling about morphine is that it can be a good solution_ depending on your situation and how much you take.  I am definitely acclimated or addicted_ whatever you want to call it. But once you have a certain level of pain_ it's not as though there's a choice.,F,67,7  years15 mg 2X D,9/24/2012,Morphine sulfate

The main problem I have had was the Itching. It keeps me up & driving me insane. I have gotten irritable also. It has helped with some of the pain in my back but not all of it. I have degenaritve (sc) Bone disease_ Fractured my L-spine_ 3 bulging disks_ really bad scoliosis_ all but the last was caused by an flipping a ATV down a beach_ Except for the bone disease which runs in family. I am a kidney dialysis pt & have a lot of pain from hollowed bones_ old breaks so. Opposed to what the dr wanted to give me (methadone low dosages) I have to rate this a 4 I am satisfied but some pain still there. Hopefully when I start my Cortisol injections I wont have to be on as much. I really cant stand the itching! I don't remember Morphine itching like this when I was in hospital for 6 months.

The pain does not go away but it is relieved somewhat.  I am not taking even half of what my doctor prescribed due to fear of addiction.  Even though I dont get any high from it. I can function better with it than without the morphine.  I am an active person and always have been. But I have had 2 cancers on my hip_ total hip replacement and chemo and radiation.

Worked slowly from 15mg each dose to current 90_ where I have been for a month with virtually no breakthrough pain.  I do not have the craving that Oxycodone by itself left me with_ and if I need to take oxycodone for rare breakthrough pain there is still no craving and no euphoria.  NO mania of the kind that I had on Lyrica for 3 years before it went sour altogether. The side-effects are unpleasant_ and the stigma is difficult psychologically_ but after two decades of trying 44 medications as well as alternative treatment I am finally in no pain.

I'm used to living life at levels varying from 8-10.  I've taken thousands of vicodin in the last 3-4 years_ valium_ gabapentin_ lortabs_ dilauded_ etc.  My pain management doc finally gave me oramorph when I requested XR oxycontin.  I've always been worried about taking oxy's due to the addiction aspect but now_ due to large build up of scar tissue inside/around the spine_ the pain just got bad enough to pull out the stops.  I'm glad in retrospect he didn't Rx oxy as the morphine sulfate has been a god send.  I can live life at a 6-8 and in conjunction with Vicodin ES or Lortabs_ I actually managed to run with my dog for the first time in over 2 years just this past weekend.  While it's not a miracle drug in any way_ it has given me a little bit of my quality of life back.

Many of my friends swear by OXYCONTIN_ but OXY was like taking a placebo for me. The only Rx that has EVER helped me ... is MS Contin! While it has NEVER stopped all the pain_ it has made it possible to be mobile enough to even go to the grocery store occasionally! People in my shape learned years ago to ""latch onto"" the small victories. I have gotten worse lately (the last 6 months)_ and my Doctor does not want to go above the 60 mg (twice daily). We are currently bouncing ideas off of each other. He wants me to try fentanyl patches (but I told him my surgeon tried those 15 years ago with absolutely ZERO effect ... except for fairly major burn/rash from adhesive_ LoL)! Then_ he suggested ""nerve blocks"". and those have ALWAYS worried me (too many horror stories). So_ we're working on it. He is a FINE doctor_ and the only one that has stuck by me ... even when his partners told him to dump me! So_ I'm sure we'll figure something out.",M,50,12  years,9/24/2009,Morphine sulfate
59, 4, Spine fractures_ osteoarthritis,Dry mouth_ difficulty swallowing_ gerd_ constipation_ out of breath when walking_ up and down all night,It is the best pain reliever.  30 mg ER every 12 hours_ Loratabs 10 mg as needed. I could not have lived without them.  I could not stand or walk without holding on to something until after I took it and it made me stronger. Problem--body started trying to overcome it and IBS began returning and abdominally miserable_ felt like insides pushing out. Stopped taking it last week and thought no problem. Yesterday felt like I could not breathe and went to ER_ all blood tests_ heart and x-rays normal (they said beautiful_ perfect). Suggested body reacting to stopping MS and have allergies. Weak depressed_ anxious_IBS returned_ back pain subsided. Trying to get by on ibuprofen. Maybe try rheumatologist.,M,59,2  days,5/19/2009,Morphine sulfate
60, 4, degenerative disc/ back & neck pain,It works well as long as I take it as soon as I get up in the morning. 15mg twice a day. Constipation a plus because I have IBS and diarrhea. Disappears when on morphine.,My doctor is reluctant to prescribe the proper amount and then leaves me with none. The pain returns with a vengence. I have taken ultram_ tramadol_ Vioxx_ Celebrex_ muscle relaxants and either they didn't work or I was Allergic!,F,66,4  years,4/29/2009Email,Morphine sulfate
61, 2, Spina bifida and degenerative discs,Blurred head_ stomach cramps_ constipation_ confusion_ anxiety_ heart palpitations_ leg cramps_ headaches and the most recent aches and pains in my arms and hands.,It is seems to me the longer i stay on this drug the more side effects i am getting.  This drug does not take my pain away..... And most days i dont know who i am ...,F,39,5  months,2/21/2009Email,Morphine sulfate
62, 3, Fibromyalgia,bad constipation,helps a little_ but not for the 12 hrs. like it is supposed to. I take 15mg 2x a day....some days are still really bad. was on Oxycodone_ but dr. wanted me to switch to this.,F,39,9  months,2/19/2009,Morphine sulfate
63, 4, back 2 spinal fusions_ legs_ ankle,dry mouth_ constipation_ no desire_,only thing out of everything that works for my pain have been through 10 year ordeal where i tried accupunture_ and just about every drug available.  30mg_ 6 pills_ 3 times a day. Also 600mg nuerontin 3x daily.,M,42,5  years,2/17/2009Email,Morphine sulfate
64, 5, Arthritic hip and back pain,Constipation_ drowsiness,None of the other pain relievers (we've tried everything over the last six years) have worked so well for me as MS morphine does.  Dr has been suggesting I try it for the last couple of years; my reluctance to do so seems silly now_ except for the responses I get when folks hear that morphine's what's brought about such improvement in my quality of life.  What's with the stigma around morphine_ anyway?  Weird_ since it's practically 'herbal' and works so much better than the out and out synthetically fabricated pain relievers. In pain relief_ lack of side effects_ ease of administration (15 mg_ 2x daily) and steadiness of delivery_ nothing else has come close; anyway_ from the first dose_ for me it really IS a godsend!,F,53,4  days,2/7/2009,Morphine sulfate

I notice little side effects.,Helps rheumatoid arthritis/spondylitis pain somewhat. It doesn't completely knock out my pain_ but it helps.,F,36,3  years,11/24/2008Email,Morphine sulfate
67, 4, chronic post-surgery abdominal pain,restlessness_ itching (esp. on face)_ muscle/body aches_ unable to sleep_ confusion and depression,"Morphine is much better than Fentanyl patches (even 12.5 too strong) as maintenance drug for my pain. I have found that using it PRN helps me function better overall and lessens side effects also.  After years of pain a ""10"" has now become an ""8"" so I try to use MS only when my pain is a 9 or a 10 and am willing to deal with the side effects.",M,45,8  months,11/10/2008Email,Morphine sulfate
68, 1, I had a relatively minor surgery,At first nausea_ then sweating_ itching_ my chest seized up - my heart started loudly in my ears. My eyes got all swollen and started watering_ my whole body came out in a red bumpy rash. My throat started burning and breathing became almost impossible.  The nurses attending to me said that i also changed colour to a light shade of blue...,It did not help with the pain at all.  No relief what so ever.,F,35,1  days,10/5/2008Email,Morphine sulfate
69, 5, chronic back pain_cage and fusion,blurred vision_ a little foggy_hard to focus,I feel it has helped me a great deal. I was on vicodin for 8 yrs and it was no longer working.This has been a blessing right now I dont know how long it will work as I am new to this medicine.,F,45,3  days,10/2/2008,Morphine sulfate
70, 4, chronic back pain,dry mouth_ itching_ constipation.,When taken consistently this medication gave me back my functionality.  The pain is still there I know it I can feel it but I just do not care.  The morphine never really removes the pain just allows me to negotiate around it.   for me it works_ better than any of the others. I have tried nearly all the meds available. the morphine has helped greatly.   Increasing the dosage does little for MORE pain relief_ 15mg / 4 hours works just fine at taking the edge off. ,M,44,12  years,8/5/2008Email,Morphine sulfate
71, 3, lower back pain_ chronic pain syndr,very foggy at times_ bad nightmares_ could not sleep alot of the time. What a nightmare!! I only have had 5-6 good days in the whole 2 months of taking it..,I started out on 60 mg. daily. I think that was too high_so went to 30 mg daily- 15/twice daily. the lower dose did not help with the pain all day. using percocet for breakthrough. I do not understand why it did not work_ I have used opiods for 10 years now for pain!! Good luck for those of you that is helped.,F,43,60  days,6/27/2008,Morphine sulfate

74, 3, chronic back pain,cloudy mind_ withdrawal from family_ apathy,While the drug(60mg 2X's a day)did do quite well at taking the edge off my pain i would never take it again 'les I was dying or had severe trauma.The worst side effect was the withdrawal from family and the thought of 'I actually drove my children around while taking this crap'. Stopped cold turkey and suffered HORRIBLE W/DRWLS. Dehydration that i had 2 get an IV 4_ severe diarrhea_ could not sleep_ many others. been a month getting better.

76, 4, Post Op Pain,Nausea_ extreme tightness in chest and neck that caused me to have anxiety troubles.,It did take care of the pain and made me extremely tired. The nausea was taken care of through anti-nausea meds. The worst part was the tightness I felt in my chest and neck as it was being injected into my IV. It felt as tho I was having trouble breathing and that caused me to panic.,F,23,3  days,1/11/2008,Morphine sulfate
77, 2, Chronic back/leg pain,Constipation_ tremors and trouble focusing my vision at close range.  Not much pain relief.,I'm not entirely certain that the morphine is causing my tremors because I take so many other drugs every day.  I suspect a combination of all my meds are to blame.  I can say for sure that I am still in pain 24 hours a day.  I am currently taking 90mg a day and there is ALWAYS some level of pain.  Sometimes more or less_ but never entirely gone.  I was recently hospitalized for colilitus_ where I recieved dilaudid for pain.  That worked very well_ but I don't know if taking dilaudid every day for chronic pain would turn my brian into mush or not.,M,46,2  years,11/5/2007,Morphine sulfate
78, 1, post-op pain hip replacement,No side effects and NO_ ZERO! pain relief!!,Had surgery outside U.S. (no insurance)--morphine only post-op pain med available.

79, 1, Scoliosis & herniated discs,This pill was a nightmare_ in terms of side effects.  I began sweating at night so bad that I had to wash my pillows & bedding several times a week.  It made me terribly thirsty_ but no matter how much water and other fluids I drank_ I couldn't stay hydrated.  I could NOT get an erection_ even with ED drugs.  And_ worst of all_ I became *TERRIBLY* constipated.  Laxatives_ stool softeners_ and even enema kits did NOTHING.  It got so bad that_ to defecate_ I had to put on a latex glove and insert a finger in my rectum to dislodge my fecal matter.  It came out in small marble-sized pieces which were VERY hard and dry.  As time went on_ the pieces got harder and dryer and irritated my colon_ causing bleeding.  Gross?  Yes_ not only that but horribly embarrassing_ disgusting_ humiliating; thank God my wife is a medical professional and understood.  As soon as my new medication becomes available_ I'm quitting.,"It never really helped in terms of pain_ other than leveling off the ""peaks"" and ""valleys"" that I felt from taking Percocet.  I slept a little better; that is_ until the sweating (mentioned above) got so bad that I was tossing and turning every half-hour.  On its own_ even in larger doses taken experimentally (up to 3x the level prescribed)_ it NEVER ONCE took the pain away.  It was_ at best_ a tool to help manage it.  In contrast_ Percocet and methadone can take the pain away completely for a time.",M,28,4  months,4/1/2007Email,Morphine sulfate
80, 5, Fybro-knee/hip/back pain,Constipation for a while_ but the body seemed to adjust and have no side effects at all.,I was home bound_ always doped up until I agreed to try the morphine. For the first few days I was a bit doped_ but after about a week this was not an issue at all. I take one 60mg tab every 6-8 hours and have no pain. I refused it for about three months before agreeing to try it....what a wasted three months! I'm completely mobile and have my life back in every way. If you're in a lot of pain and can ride out the first couple weeks_ you might get your life back as well. At first_ friends knew I was taking something_ but now they think my pain has just gone away on its own.,M,47,3  years,1/24/2007,Morphine sulfate

82, 3, M.E./fibromyalgia breakthrough pain,Hang over style headache the following day_ constipation_ sense of wellbeing_ relaxation_ regained my former zest for a short while,I would not like to be using this drug as my regular pain medication. I used co-codramol (2 x 30/500mg) and ibuprofen (1 x 400mg) alternating 3 hourly at the most and try taking less_ also use TENs. Morphine sulfate is good for severe bursts of breakthrough pain not covered by your usual pain management. I think it dehydrates hence the constipation and hangover effect so not so good for daily use for me. Glad its changed other ppls lives though. Used twice previously for post op acute pain.,F,38,7  days,11/21/2006,Morphine sulfate

84, 1, Total knee replacement,Many terrible halluciations_ in color_ and frequent. I had a difficult time getting the nursing staff to listen to me.  Also_ the pain relief was miminal.  Then came the itching.  Like I was on fire.  Finally I was changed to another medication. The halluciations lasted 3 -4 days after the medicine was discontinued.,I know this drug is very helpful for many patients_ but I feel that when a patient is having halluciations_ they should be taken off the drug as soon as possible.  I think that this is probably a sign that the pain relief function will not work.  I also believe that patients should be consulted as to how difficult this is for them and that they are NOT crazy and it is Not permanent.,F,63,1.5  days,4/7/2006,Morphine sulfate
85, 2, Fibromyalgia pain,Nausea if taken on empty stomach.,"This has provided only minimal relief_ mainly for some overall body pain from fibromyalgia.  It has done nothing for periods when I have severe pain from a fibro flare-up or from my IBS.  Actually_ my IBS seems to have gotten worse since starting.  I take it daily_ one am and pm.  I've never experienced any ""highs"" from the morphine.",F,49,2  years,3/9/2006,Morphine sulfate

Get relief from pain within 20-30 mins.  Undesired -- Dependence_ NOT ADDICTION.  I have educated myself on these 2 terms.  They are as different as night and day.  Addiction arises whenever this med is use to Get high with_ or the doctor scripting it does not understand dependence/addiction/withdrawls/tolerance well_ and just Uses Addiction for them all.  Or the doctor is not prescibing a well enough dose_ or the patient is not doing his/her part_ to manage/regulate the dose of this medication.  in short_ going 24 hours with none_ using less with less pain.  These both will allow this med to unbind from the opiate recepotrs in the Brain.  Advice.... If you use this medication_ google or search for opiate receptors.  Understand as much as you can possibly take in about these amazing receptors in the brain.  It all will help to take away any pre-conceived notions in which,,M,33,2  years,7/6/2005,Morphine sulfate
