0, 1, Abnormal Uterine Bleeding & PCOS,Fatigue_ mood swings_ bloating_ nausea_ SEVERE cramping,So far_ this has not regulated my cycle at all.  This was my last ditch effort to get this under control_ I have been battling with AUB for years.  Had a D&C in March_ Mirena (which wasn't helpful)_ then tried Micronor_ and finally Provera.  Apparently my body is not reactive to the synthetic progestin.  So_ it looks like I am hysterectomy bound.  The side effects from this medication are horrible for me - the cramps are more comparable to contractions during labor.  Worst cramps I have ever had.,F,39,21  days10 MG 1X D,8/9/2016Email,Provera
1, 5, Bad cramps abnormal bleeding,Took this for bad cramping_ fatigue_ moodiness. Only prescribed as a ten day script. Just to help balance. Its amazing how well this has helped me.

2, 1, Old age haha,WEIGHT GAIN bloating sleepy brain fog lower back pain severe cramping HEAVY flow,Took it for over a month in hopes to regulate periods. Bled for weeks on end with horrible clotting and cramps. OB/GYN said keep taking it when I called with concerns_ so tried it for 15 more days after already taking it for 30 days. 21 days of heavy flow (clots_ soaking_ you name it) 24 days of spotting. Felt horrible the entire time on this med. exhausted_ moody and packed on 12 lbs in 45 days. Took myself off drug and fired Dr. Took about a week to get back to normal_ but once off Provera was able to function again. Periods are not balanced_ but decided nature taking it's course had to be better than Provera (and 5mos later_ still think so) I truly don't understand how this drug could be so freely prescribed_ it's side effects are awful!!!,F,45,10  days2.5,8/3/2016,Provera
3, 2, Simple & Complex hyperplasia,Insomnia_ bloating and contraction like cramps_ breast tenderness_ moody_ weight gain. LIght- headed or dazed.,The worst is not sleeping.  Switched from taking it at night to first thing in the morning with a large breakfast.  Dr. wants me on this for another couple of months till I can have a hysterscopy and polypectomy.  Not sure I can last that long. This medication although has stopped the bleeding is scary to take and I am not sure the side effects outweigh the initial problem.  Also_ I had a sister die of breast cancer and the dr. still wants me on this.  - not happy.  Tried the Prometrium and it just makes you so sleepy you can't function at all.  ,F,52,30  days10 mg 1X D,7/17/2016,Provera

17, 3, Provera to jump start my period,Taking Provera for me was easy. It made my spotting slow down. The only side effect I had was insomnia. Woke up several times during the night.,I did not have my period for 4 months_ and the last month I was spotting without a normal flow. MD prescribed Provera for 10 days_ he said at least take if for 5 days. Provera worked. It slowed down my spotting_ and I started my period the next day after taking my last 5th pill. The first three days I was bleeding like a normal period however had very annoying cramping_ and lower back pain. Day 4 I had to leave work early as I started passing clots and bleeding heavily. Day 5 I had blood clots passing every hour_ and changed heavy pads every hour. Woke up twice at night to take myself to the bathroom to let the blood clots leave my body. I am on day 6 now. The night was a hell. I woke up three times passed about a cup of blood clots at 5 am. And another 1/2 cup at 7:30. Cramping started to goaway as of this morning. Started taking Iron supplement 50 mg twice a day. Feeling week_ having palpitation_ crying and feeling depressed. Thinking if I should go to ER. But then again_ are they gonna put me on more Provera? And maybe schedule a D&C later? Feel miserable. I don't know how to avoid taking Provera in a future. I am 43 and skipping periods is a normal aging process.,F,43,5  days5 mg,2/27/2016Email,Provera

20, 5, endometriosis_ constant pain,Almost nothing_ brief period of morning sickness type nausea but that didn't last. Was still able to maintain and actually lose weight.,My period started when I was 9 and I had severe pain right from the start. At 12/13 I saw a specialist and had ultrasounds which came up mostly normal but they suspected endometriosis. They told me to come back when I started to have pain when I wasn't on my period. At about 18 I started to wake up in the night with what I can only describe as labor pains that would last anywhere from 10 minutes to 3 hours. I haven't had children but my sisters who have (and also have endo) have agreed the intensity of the pain is the same and sometimes worse than contractions. I had been on The standard pill since 13/14 to skip periods as pain management but when this started I couldn't find a pattern_ or control it with the codeine I had been prescribed as it was so sporadic. Eventually had more scans done showing an abnormal wall of my uterus but nothing else. My GYN then prescribed me provera for 3 months. Immediately my pain stopped. I had 2 and a half months 100% pain free and then had two weeks (in my mind a long periods worth) of near constant pain but that stopped. She was highly suprised that's had no side affects and has allowed me to stay on it indefinitely and I don't see myself stopping any time soon it's the most effective thing I have ever taken and its been 11 years of trying to sort out my pain!,F,20,3  months10mg,2/9/2016,Provera

22, 3, fibroids and menorrhagia,Mood swings_ hot flashes_ tender breast_ constipation_ andLABOR PAINS-cramps like contractions and lower back pain,"First off I hate this synethic mess.  I should have just demanded a partial hysterectomy and been done with it.  I have 3 beautiful children and a set of unexpected lovely Twins whom I would NOT trade for the world.  I started having heavy bleeding in Oct 2015. I did not have pain but just a flood of Biblical proportions. I finally decided to tell my internist who ordered an ultrasound.  It was discovered I had multiple fibroids she sent me to my GYN asap.  My GYN prescribed this mess instead of a partial hysterectomy. I started the meds on 04 Dec. The emotional roller coaster started_ very tender breast_ constipation_ night sweats_and hot flashes from hell. Mind you prior too taking provera I was comfortable as far as no pain just heavily bleeding and anemic. I told my doctor and her nurse said that is ""normal"" with hormones and see if I could hang in there for 3 months.  Then my period came 12 Jan. It was spotting brown and it acted as if it was stuck and I started having labor pains.  Yes contractions not cramps.  The same pain I had with all five of my angels starting in the lower abdomen and lower back simultaneously aka labor pains.  I could feel my enlarged uterus hardening. I took motrin my menses came in slow and med flow and with all the fine clots with it.  It is 16 Jan and I am still tossing and turning like a woman expecting a child.  I have to take this until March 2016. I can't.  The labor pains never ends.  I am just going to say good bye to my tired",F,36,3  months10 mg,1/16/2016,Provera

25, 3, Absent period,HEAVY bleeding_ bloating_ extreme cramps in stomach and lower back_ constipation_ diarrhea_ and mood swings. (Still bleeding on day 7. Omg),My doctor prescribed me this med because I had not had my period for a year and a half. My period was regular for months before then suddenly stopped. My period started on after the 10th day. That night I bleed so much it went straight through a heavy flow pad an onto my bed. The first three days I had vert heavy flows with lots of clots   is what it looked like. Day three was when the pain started. I've never felt anything as painful as this in my life. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you I literally could do nothing but lay on bed and writhe in pain.(pain in lower stomach and lower back) It came and went throughout the day_ but was usually the worst when I woke up. Thank god I'm on Christmas break from school. Its day 7 and I'm still bleeding. I'm so tired and done with this. Maybe my period will be regular after this because I'd rather not take it again. Also id love it if my doctor could find out why I wasn't having them in the first place. :/,F,14,10  days,12/24/2015Email,Provera

I literally have to sleep the first day I take it because I am so nauseas and tired. I am going to a REAL hormone specialist bc these obgyn's don't have a clue.

33, 1, To jump start my period/ regulate,Worst medicine ever! Bloated_ no appetite_ naseau_ exhaustion_ weak_ leg pain_ heart pain_ body pain_ shoulder pain_ anxiety_ severe gastrointestinal problems_ severe constipation_ insomnia_ depression_ personality change_ moody_ no interest in the things I normally love_ could not function on this medication at all_ bed ridden from day 1 to day 5 when I threw the bottle away!,My doctor prescribed this to me to jump start my period. I have exstremly regular cycles and then my periods stopped completly for 4 months so he put me on provera 10mg for 10 days and clomid for days 3 to 7 whenever I start my period if I do. I called to tell him of my side effects_ but he won't be back in office until Monday. I took it for half the time I was supposed to. I called the pharmacy and they said stop taking it!!! I had to stop as I felt my wold was turned up side down. I was no longer able to play with my son or work. I could not function and am terrified of the pain that will be coming with my period! If my period even comes. My recommendation for this doctors is prescribe natural progesterone cream_ or birth control to regulate these poor women. My advice for patients is always check side effects and do not take this medication. Always try herbal methods and ask about birth control if that doesn't work. My husband and I wanted another child hints the clomid_ but now we no longer do if this is what I'll have to go through. Kids are so wonderful_ but this medicine will put you on your ass and I felt as though I was being poisoned and still do. My son misses me and so does my husband. Not worth the risk or side effects at all! Am telling my doctor on Monday what pharmacy said and that this is not a good medicine for me at all. I'm not even done with my experience.

My gyn prescribed Provera to regulate my period so that I could get a routine ultrasound to check on the fibroids_ which has to be done 6-9 days after a period.

I was exhausted_ and could barely walk up a flight of stairs without my chest hurting and heart racing. Bleeding began after day 2_ horrible flooding with clots. My legs were ""heavy""--I could barely lift them to walk. Honestly_ I felt like I was being poisoned. I was completely unable to function. Just awful. The symptoms came in bursts_ though. I would wake up feeling fine_ and then feel worse over the course of the day.

54, 2, AUB - Heavy bleeding,Severe - headache_ Nausea_ diarrhea_ cramping & heavy flow; Moderate breast tenderness_ moodiness and some bloating/fluid retention.  Oh and my hair is shedding pretty heavily.,"I have PCOS with Abnormal Uterine Bleeding.  I was prescribed Provera to stop an acute AUB episode of very very heavy bleeding.  It did not work the first 9 days I took it.  Flow was horrible_ large clotting and horrid cramps (I don't usually have cramping at all) PLUS all the added side effects of the medication (headache/migraine_ nausea_ diarrhea_ etc). Day 10 arrived and my flow was down from non-stop raging gushes to a 4-6 hour window of light bleeding; however_ as soon as a clot broke loose the heavy flow began again.  I have been prescribed an additional 10 days (same dosage).  Now I get to look forward to ""Provera period"" (google it) about 5 days after I stop taking the medication!  Can't wait to go through this all over again.  Feeling like I'm stuck in a never ending_ hopeless spiral of heavy flows.  Looking into ablation or hysterectomy next.",F,38,10  days10 1X D,3/18/2015Email,Provera

57, 3, Endometrial Hyperplasia,The first couple of days of taking the provera made me feel sick like my body was rejecting it. It gave me diarrhea and I even threw up(on the second day of taking it) overall provera made me feel tired and crampy. I have now taken it for 10 days and 3 days later I started my period which is very heavy and I am cramping 24/7 I have been taking 800 MG of Ibuprofen but it does not work at all. I called my doctor to ask if she would prescribe me something stronger for the pain but she said that the only thing she could give me was Motrin which is Ibuprofen. I feel miserable and in pain all the time.,,F,28,10  days10 MG 1X D,3/4/2015Email,Provera

59, 4, No period for three mo's,moody_ tired_ heavier flow_ cramping.,"I have never had period issues in the past_ the only time I have had heavy bleeding in my life_ was the first time I got on birth control and had ""break-through"" bleeding. This does mimic those symptoms. I haven't had to upgrade yet to super plus but Iam bordeline there. I never had cramps with that though and I do with this. My cycles used to be 3-5 days long and normal-light flow.  With provera Iam on day 5 and no sign of letting up. This is my first cycle with it however but as of right now this is cramping and bleeding is ANNOYING! I would say this is just doing  it's job and my body is making up for lost time so I don't think the drug was bad it's just all how your body reacts.",F,29,8  days,2/25/2015Email,Provera
