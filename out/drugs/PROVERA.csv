0, 1, Abnormal Uterine Bleeding & PCOS,Fatigue_ mood swings_ bloating_ nausea_ SEVERE cramping,So far_ this has not regulated my cycle at all.  This was my last ditch effort to get this under control_ I have been battling with AUB for years.  Had a D&C in March_ Mirena (which wasn't helpful)_ then tried Micronor_ and finally Provera.  Apparently my body is not reactive to the synthetic progestin.  So_ it looks like I am hysterectomy bound.  The side effects from this medication are horrible for me - the cramps are more comparable to contractions during labor.  Worst cramps I have ever had.,F,39,21  days10 MG 1X D,8/9/2016Email,Provera
1, 5, Bad cramps abnormal bleeding,Took this for bad cramping_ fatigue_ moodiness. Only prescribed as a ten day script. Just to help balance. Its amazing how well this has helped me.

2, 1, Old age haha,WEIGHT GAIN bloating sleepy brain fog lower back pain severe cramping HEAVY flow,Took it for over a month in hopes to regulate periods. Bled for weeks on end with horrible clotting and cramps. OB/GYN said keep taking it when I called with concerns_ so tried it for 15 more days after already taking it for 30 days. 21 days of heavy flow (clots_ soaking_ you name it) 24 days of spotting. Felt horrible the entire time on this med. exhausted_ moody and packed on 12 lbs in 45 days. Took myself off drug and fired Dr. Took about a week to get back to normal_ but once off Provera was able to function again. Periods are not balanced_ but decided nature taking it's course had to be better than Provera (and 5mos later_ still think so) I truly don't understand how this drug could be so freely prescribed_ it's side effects are awful!!!,F,45,10  days2.5,8/3/2016,Provera
3, 2, Simple & Complex hyperplasia,Insomnia_ bloating and contraction like cramps_ breast tenderness_ moody_ weight gain. LIght- headed or dazed.,The worst is not sleeping.  Switched from taking it at night to first thing in the morning with a large breakfast.  Dr. wants me on this for another couple of months till I can have a hysterscopy and polypectomy.  Not sure I can last that long. This medication although has stopped the bleeding is scary to take and I am not sure the side effects outweigh the initial problem.  Also_ I had a sister die of breast cancer and the dr. still wants me on this.  - not happy.  Tried the Prometrium and it just makes you so sleepy you can't function at all.  ,F,52,30  days10 mg 1X D,7/17/2016,Provera

17, 3, Provera to jump start my period,Taking Provera for me was easy. It made my spotting slow down. The only side effect I had was insomnia. Woke up several times during the night.,I did not have my period for 4 months_ and the last month I was spotting without a normal flow. MD prescribed Provera for 10 days_ he said at least take if for 5 days. Provera worked. It slowed down my spotting_ and I started my period the next day after taking my last 5th pill. The first three days I was bleeding like a normal period however had very annoying cramping_ and lower back pain. Day 4 I had to leave work early as I started passing clots and bleeding heavily. Day 5 I had blood clots passing every hour_ and changed heavy pads every hour. Woke up twice at night to take myself to the bathroom to let the blood clots leave my body. I am on day 6 now. The night was a hell. I woke up three times passed about a cup of blood clots at 5 am. And another 1/2 cup at 7:30. Cramping started to goaway as of this morning. Started taking Iron supplement 50 mg twice a day. Feeling week_ having palpitation_ crying and feeling depressed. Thinking if I should go to ER. But then again_ are they gonna put me on more Provera? And maybe schedule a D&C later? Feel miserable. I don't know how to avoid taking Provera in a future. I am 43 and skipping periods is a normal aging process.,F,43,5  days5 mg,2/27/2016Email,Provera

20, 5, endometriosis_ constant pain,Almost nothing_ brief period of morning sickness type nausea but that didn't last. Was still able to maintain and actually lose weight.,My period started when I was 9 and I had severe pain right from the start. At 12/13 I saw a specialist and had ultrasounds which came up mostly normal but they suspected endometriosis. They told me to come back when I started to have pain when I wasn't on my period. At about 18 I started to wake up in the night with what I can only describe as labor pains that would last anywhere from 10 minutes to 3 hours. I haven't had children but my sisters who have (and also have endo) have agreed the intensity of the pain is the same and sometimes worse than contractions. I had been on The standard pill since 13/14 to skip periods as pain management but when this started I couldn't find a pattern_ or control it with the codeine I had been prescribed as it was so sporadic. Eventually had more scans done showing an abnormal wall of my uterus but nothing else. My GYN then prescribed me provera for 3 months. Immediately my pain stopped. I had 2 and a half months 100% pain free and then had two weeks (in my mind a long periods worth) of near constant pain but that stopped. She was highly suprised that's had no side affects and has allowed me to stay on it indefinitely and I don't see myself stopping any time soon it's the most effective thing I have ever taken and its been 11 years of trying to sort out my pain!,F,20,3  months10mg,2/9/2016,Provera

22, 3, fibroids and menorrhagia,Mood swings_ hot flashes_ tender breast_ constipation_ andLABOR PAINS-cramps like contractions and lower back pain,"First off I hate this synethic mess.  I should have just demanded a partial hysterectomy and been done with it.  I have 3 beautiful children and a set of unexpected lovely Twins whom I would NOT trade for the world.  I started having heavy bleeding in Oct 2015. I did not have pain but just a flood of Biblical proportions. I finally decided to tell my internist who ordered an ultrasound.  It was discovered I had multiple fibroids she sent me to my GYN asap.  My GYN prescribed this mess instead of a partial hysterectomy. I started the meds on 04 Dec. The emotional roller coaster started_ very tender breast_ constipation_ night sweats_and hot flashes from hell. Mind you prior too taking provera I was comfortable as far as no pain just heavily bleeding and anemic. I told my doctor and her nurse said that is ""normal"" with hormones and see if I could hang in there for 3 months.  Then my period came 12 Jan. It was spotting brown and it acted as if it was stuck and I started having labor pains.  Yes contractions not cramps.  The same pain I had with all five of my angels starting in the lower abdomen and lower back simultaneously aka labor pains.  I could feel my enlarged uterus hardening. I took motrin my menses came in slow and med flow and with all the fine clots with it.  It is 16 Jan and I am still tossing and turning like a woman expecting a child.  I have to take this until March 2016. I can't.  The labor pains never ends.  I am just going to say good bye to my tired",F,36,3  months10 mg,1/16/2016,Provera

25, 3, Absent period,HEAVY bleeding_ bloating_ extreme cramps in stomach and lower back_ constipation_ diarrhea_ and mood swings. (Still bleeding on day 7. Omg),My doctor prescribed me this med because I had not had my period for a year and a half. My period was regular for months before then suddenly stopped. My period started on after the 10th day. That night I bleed so much it went straight through a heavy flow pad an onto my bed. The first three days I had vert heavy flows with lots of clots   is what it looked like. Day three was when the pain started. I've never felt anything as painful as this in my life. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you I literally could do nothing but lay on bed and writhe in pain.(pain in lower stomach and lower back) It came and went throughout the day_ but was usually the worst when I woke up. Thank god I'm on Christmas break from school. Its day 7 and I'm still bleeding. I'm so tired and done with this. Maybe my period will be regular after this because I'd rather not take it again. Also id love it if my doctor could find out why I wasn't having them in the first place. :/,F,14,10  days,12/24/2015Email,Provera

I literally have to sleep the first day I take it because I am so nauseas and tired. I am going to a REAL hormone specialist bc these obgyn's don't have a clue.

33, 1, To jump start my period/ regulate,Worst medicine ever! Bloated_ no appetite_ naseau_ exhaustion_ weak_ leg pain_ heart pain_ body pain_ shoulder pain_ anxiety_ severe gastrointestinal problems_ severe constipation_ insomnia_ depression_ personality change_ moody_ no interest in the things I normally love_ could not function on this medication at all_ bed ridden from day 1 to day 5 when I threw the bottle away!,My doctor prescribed this to me to jump start my period. I have exstremly regular cycles and then my periods stopped completly for 4 months so he put me on provera 10mg for 10 days and clomid for days 3 to 7 whenever I start my period if I do. I called to tell him of my side effects_ but he won't be back in office until Monday. I took it for half the time I was supposed to. I called the pharmacy and they said stop taking it!!! I had to stop as I felt my wold was turned up side down. I was no longer able to play with my son or work. I could not function and am terrified of the pain that will be coming with my period! If my period even comes. My recommendation for this doctors is prescribe natural progesterone cream_ or birth control to regulate these poor women. My advice for patients is always check side effects and do not take this medication. Always try herbal methods and ask about birth control if that doesn't work. My husband and I wanted another child hints the clomid_ but now we no longer do if this is what I'll have to go through. Kids are so wonderful_ but this medicine will put you on your ass and I felt as though I was being poisoned and still do. My son misses me and so does my husband. Not worth the risk or side effects at all! Am telling my doctor on Monday what pharmacy said and that this is not a good medicine for me at all. I'm not even done with my experience.

My gyn prescribed Provera to regulate my period so that I could get a routine ultrasound to check on the fibroids_ which has to be done 6-9 days after a period.

I would wake up feeling fine_ and then feel worse over the course of the day.

It did not work the first 9 days I took it.  Flow was horrible_ large clotting and horrid cramps (I don't usually have cramping at all) PLUS all the added side effects of the medication (headache/migraine_ nausea_ diarrhea_ etc). Day 10 arrived and my flow was down from non-stop raging gushes to a 4-6 hour window of light bleeding; however_ as soon as a clot broke loose the heavy flow began again.  I have been prescribed an additional 10 days (same dosage).  Now I get to look forward to ""Provera period"" (google it) about 5 days after I stop taking the medication!  Can't wait to go through this all over again.  Feeling like I'm stuck in a never ending_ hopeless spiral of heavy flows.

89, 5, (lean/skinny) PCOS/hirsutism,While reading all of the other comments I am probably one of the few ladies who did not experience any dramatic side effects. The only bad thing was that my clitoris is extremely sesitive while on this_ which is only 5 days and that's not too bad. All I had was some minor bloating a few hours after I took the medication_ and had some breast tenderness. My skin broke out a little bit_ but nothing different from how my skin typically was. My appetite is the same_ I get head aches too (they go away after a bit and they're not bad). I would say I am a little more gassy_ but I also eat a large meal with it which is probably the real cause lol. I feel maybe even less moody now and I only just started this..,"I have a case of ""lean"" PCOS_ which basically means I am not overweight. I am 5'9 and weigh 132 pounds_ which is considered extremely healthy. I had elevated testosterone and LSH levels_ along side with irregular periods and spotting in between ever since I could remember. My doctor said the pill was the worst and last thing I could be on. Most doctors prescribe it because it's an ""easy"" fix. It's a band-aid_ it covers the problems up_ however it does not actually solve or treat the underlying issues. Plus provera helps with fertility and doesn't mess with the good things that your EXTREMELY delicate hormonal system DOES have balanced. I also have minor acne/hirsutism (black spurred out chest/lower abdomen/outter pubic bone hair). Hopefully provera will keep working and do it's job! I also hope I'm not the only one with these issues who thinks the pill is a LAST resort thing!

I would highly recommend taking this pill with lunch or dinner because it will make you extremely tired. I made the mistake of taking it with breakfast and always felt groggy around early afternoon. My period after Provera was EXTREMELY heavy; I actually had to take off work for almost a whole week because the bleeding was out of control and I was going through overnight maxi pads every hour. If you have to take this medication_ just be aware that the periods can be very intense and heavy although it seems not everyone has this effect from it.

The side effect that I can not handle is both months I lost so much hair that if I didn't have thick hair to begin with I may have been bald.  For those 10 days each month when I would shower_ literally handfulls of hair would fall out.  It was extremely depressing.,,F,35,10  days10mg,1/17/2014Email,Provera

Prescribed this med as prep to thin my uterus for ablation which I will be having in a couple of days. I do not think that I could take this med on a regular basis if I had to continuously bleed.  I have been bleeding for 3 weeks now and still not sure how my body will react to the ablation.  Had pre-op yesterday and I was terrified after going over all of the possible things that could go wrong with having the procedure. Not even sure how all of a sudden I am a candidate when I was told last year that I was not due to my fibroids but I need some relief bad!

This was my first cycle since my 11-12-12 C-Section.  I got my cycle 2-8-13 and was prescribed the generic of Provera (Medroxyprogesterone 10 MG Tablet) to take once a day for my extremely heavy cycle that I had from a C-Section.  I started taking it on 2-12-13 and on 2-17-13 I started to have a numb and tinging sensation in my right hand and down my right leg and foot.  I called and left a message with my OBGYN on 2-18-13 and was told by his nurse to continue taking it_ I stated to her what about the numbess and tingling and was told to continue to take the medicine since my cycle was starting to lighten.  I went from soaking a pad_ panties and pants every two hours to about every 4 hours_ that's considered lightened.  By the end of the week I couldn't lift my right foot.  I've had severe pain_ cramping_ lower back pain_ right pelvic pain so when I got my cycle on 3-4-13 just as heavy I went into his office and seen him he gave me Generess Fe and Irospan 24/6 to take_ I told him about the numbess_ tingling and my foot and he didn't say anything.  I bled for 2 months straight with spotting after that.  I went to see my regular doctor when I couldn't get my OBGYN to sort what was up with my foot because I almost face planted the ground several times and didn't know what was going on with the numbing_ tingling,F,37,19  days10 MG 1X D,4/28/2013Email,Provera

I will take the few side effects over the nightmare I was living for so long. I had horrible_ painful cramps that would go down into my thighs and really heavy clotting periods. My periods were not regular and I would bleed way more than once a month. Once I had a tampon and a pad on and filled it within an hour.

I had not had a period for 4 months and my M.D. ran a lot of blood tests and the only thing that came back was my FSH was elevated which could be signs of early menopause. This medication was supposed to get my body back on track. After taking the drug I started3 days later and so far my cycle is like a normal period. I only noticed being tired the first couple of days. No other side effects so it really worked (crossing my fingers) to get my cycle back.

I was taking the pills at night time this way I wouldnt feel anything while I was sleeping.,This is my second time I took Provera in the last year and a half for the same reason; to induce menstruation. When I took it last year it was because my period was missing for a month and a half. This year_ the last time I had my period was on 4/20. I went 3 months without getting it. I was frustrated. I was trying everything from home remedies to natural herbs and nothing was bringing my flow_ so I went to doctor and got Provera. I took Provera from 7/23 till 8/1.  Last year when I took provera I got my period 9 days after the last pill_ this time around I started spotting 6 days after last pill (8/7) and had a normal flow from 8/8 till 8/13.

I was first put on natural progesterone.  I had an allergic reaction to the natural progesterone (even though I do not have a nut allergy).  My doctor put me on the synthetic progesterone to hopefully induce a period_ but nothing.  All I have is some light brown spotting and period-like cramps after taking my last pill 5 days ago.

187, 5, Bleeding heavily for months,I bled more heavily than I had before.  Changing tampons and pads almost every 45 minutes.  Huge clots.  Sometimes had to step quickly into tub to keep from bleeding on the floor; the blood would stream out of me like a faucet.  Had extreme mood swings and sense of doom.  When I quit taking it_ my bleeding seemed to be worse.,The stuff the OB/GYN prescribed to stop the bleed seemed to make it worse!  When I called the nurse_ all she said was I should have taken it the whole 10 days as prescribed.  She really didnÂ’t give me any reason why this was happening to me or what she thought the outcome was going to be.  A couple more days after discontinuing_ I called the nurse again. She implied that she expected my bleeding to stop after five days.  Sure enough it did.  I have not taken the medication since then. I think I am going through menopause.  Had some hot flashes and sleep disturbance_ but started using a little progesterone cream and I Cool_ and avoiding sweets.  Now IÂ’m sleeping better and the hot flashes are milder.  If I go another 8 months without bleeding_ I'll know I have passed through menopause.  I feel good_ mainly because I'm not bleeding my guts out!!!  I think having more sunshine in the summer helped me to feel better too - just a theory based on what I've read about vitamin D.  I just wanted to come on this site and give a good report because I read a lot of reviews where other women my age were having the same heavy bleeding.  I thought I would just say there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't appreciate how doctors don't inform patients what might happen.

After 2 weeks I started spotting/bleeding off and on for the next 2 months. I was prescribed provera to shed my lining because it was kind of thick. The first month I took 20mg/day for 10 days. I stopped spotting immediately but then started back bleeding 3 days later. i was told to continue the dosage. I did continue bleeding for about 2 weeks. The next month I started spotting again and only took 10mg/day for 10 days. Now I'm into the next month and NO SPOTTING!! I hope it did the trick because I would love to have a baby!

I was very nervous about the nausea_ since I am my own boss and cant really ""take time off"" if I was ill.  Luckily for me_ I had no nausea at all.  I took the pill at dinner as recommended by my Dr.  One day I forgot and took it a bit after without food and felt a slight wave of nausea_ but nothing severe and it only lasted about 30 mins. At night I had some hot flashes_ I ended up sleeping with the AC and the fan on.  I recommend taking it at night with dinner.  I have trouble skin to begin with_ so the extra hormones from the Provera caused a wicked acne breakout.  Nothing that can't be concealed and the pros totally out wiegh the cons.I am took Provera so I would get my period_ we are TTC and without a cycle clearly its impossible....went 3 months without a period.  I was on 10MG/day for 5 days.  My Dr. said I would get my period within 3 days after taking the last dose...but I didn't actually get my period until 5 days after the last dose. And once I did get it_ it was like any other regular period.  Fairly light/medium flow the first two days and light the last 2 days.  No cramping_ nothing unusal.The Provera did what it was supposed to do with very little side affects at all.  I now can start taking Clomid in hopes of getting pregnant!

211, 1, anovulatory cycles & spotting,,"I have anovulatory cycles (don't ovulate)_ so I spot and bleed for about two weeks before my cycle begins for real.  By the time I finally stop all bleeding_ it's usually been three weeks.  As my cycles come every 30-35 days_ I have 10-14 days of no bleeding before I start spotting again.  So_ my doctor prescribed Provera 10mg/day for the last 12 days of my ""cycle"" for three months (so 12 days out of each month).  I completed the first month's 12 days.  During those 12 days_ I felt fine (but kept spotting as the doctor suspected I might the first month of dosage).  Then_ I started my ""real"" cycle_ as predicted with Provera_ which stopped after about four days.  THEN_ I started getting PMS symptoms_ along with much edema in my legs.  This concerned me a great deal_ because I have chronic kidney disease.  So_ the edema indicated to me that my kidneys had in some way been greatly stressed by the Provera.  In addition_ I had much increased IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)_ a problem I've learned to keep under control but went crazy after the progesterone treatment.  So_ I had communicated with my doctor_ who sometime later in the year will help me think of some other plan for treating my anovulatory cycles_ if necessary.  I think I would have similar problems with any type of progesterone treatment_ perhaps even creams_ and not just the Provera...but I'm not sure.

222, 4, Irregular Periods,No side affects_ I took the pill at night_ so I exerienced nothing while taking them.However my menstral symptoms incude: Cramping_ itchy vagina_ bloating_ moody_ irritable_ slight loss of appetite_ heavy bleeding_ period lasting over 7 days_ and sore breasts (got worse on day 8 strangely),I was supposed to take the pills for 12 days_ however I went out of town and forgot my meds and made it through maybe 8 or 9 days. However 3-4 days after stopping them_I got my period. I was happy because I hadn't had a period since the summer and had experienced light spotting that would last for 5-10 days every 2 or so weeks. Doc said it was because my unterine walls were shedding slightly due to sexual activity and a build up due to no period. So I hopped on the chance to shed my uterine walls so no more spotting could occur. So...the first few days of my period were normal_ but the 3-6th day of my period was rediculously heavy!

This lastet for 36 hours and is now lighter_ but not stopped yet. I did not take the 10th dose and I don't think I can go through this once a month.,F,36,10  days10 1X D,3/12/2012,Provera

I did notice that I was having bizarre dreams - but_ if that's my only issue_ I'm not complaining.,After one week of being off Provera_ my doctors were concerned because I hadn't yet started my period. But_ sure enough_ that same day they called in another prescription_ I started my period. Leading up to this_ I've realized that there was a significant change in the amount of discharge I had. It was very watery and seemed to be coming at a constant rate. Then_ before you knew it_ it turned into a period. It's now day 2 of my period and it's not abnormally horrible yet. I never really had painful periods_ so that's abnormal_ but it's been a year without bleeding - obviously there is going to be some pain. The medicine has done what it is supposed to. I just wish I hadn't gone into it with the notion that it'd be as bad as I read on here.

288, 3, To regulate periods/control flow,Gained 10 lbs.,I started taking provera in March of 2009 because I was having very heavy periods with severe cramping(like miscarriage) and they were becoming very irregular. My doctor suggested I try provera for a few months and it should straighten everything out. I took it for a few months(2 or 3) and decided to get off of it because I was concerned with the side effects that other women have had. Once again_ I began having heavy bleeding and cramping_ so I got back on it. Never did my doctor tell me I should only stay on this for 6 months. In late July_ I took my usual dose(1 pill a day the last 10 days of the month). My period started for a few days_ then stopped. It started again around the 15th of the month and stayed until I started taking the provera around the 20th of August. Now its the 20th of September and I still have not started_ but I have been cramping off and on for several days. I had my annual check up with my gyn today_ and he told me that Provera thins out your uterine lining and it's probably too thin to have a period now. He said not to take them anymore(hadn't planned on it) and in a few months he'll check my hormone levels to see what is going on. Now I'm wishing I hadn't taken them for so long because of the cancer and other risks associated with them. I am anxious to see if I will actually be able to lose the weight that I gained because I have never had so much trouble losing weight before.,F,46,18  months10 mg 1X D,9/20/2011Email,Provera

I had an extremely heavy flow and terrible_ terrible cramps.  It is now day 11 and I am still having a moderate flow.  I was expecting that it would be bad_ but it has been worse than I could imagine. The side effects were awful_ and I have not felt well during my period either. I just want the bleeding to stop. I would rather have high testerone and deal with the effects of PCOS then take Provera again.  The last three weeks have been the most miserable of my life.,F,19,10  days10 mg 1X D,6/2/2011,Provera
330, 3, Period wouldn't stop,Weight gain_ hungry all the time!,I started taking Provera after being on my pd for almost 5 months straight. The dr said my ul was thickened and a cyst on my ovary could be the cause of this.

Day 3 of the med I started cramping in my left side and couldnÂ’t sleep from all the pain. I am in a horrible mood and its day 4. I hope this is all worth it I didnÂ’t know it was going to be this bad! Has anyone else taken this medicine for this problem_ and did it work?,F,27,10  days10mg 1X D,5/26/2011Email,Provera

378, 5, Irregular periods/long cycles,None,I was prescribed Provera to regulate my periods as my cycles are usually three months long.  Whilst taking Provera I felt wonderful_ but did experience a bit of PMS when I stopped taking it (bloating_ a bit of nausea_ thirst_ hunger).  My understanding is that PMS is linked to a progesterone sensitivity_ and obviously Provera is a form of progesterone_ so I think this is why I had more PMS symptoms than usual.  I began my period today_ nine days after I took my last pill.  I was starting to get a bit concerned when it didn't happen within the 'few' days advised in the patient leaflet_ but I am happy that Provera has worked for me.  In my opinion_ if you have a problem with your cycles_ this is worth a shot - surely the PMS side effects are a small price to pay if it sorts out your cycles!,F,27,6  days10 mg 2X D,11/19/2010Email,Provera

My period came 3 days after my last pill. I hadn't had a period in two years so it did what it was suppose to. The period began as a regular one wit back cramps. I never had back cramps before so I attributed this to the pill. Then by day 5 of my cycle is was starting to go away as it should but then day 6 started again with a heavy flow.

Had heavy bleeding and clots due to absent periods and thick endometrium.,When i got my period after taking Provera it was a lot of bleeding and clots i assumed it was from me not having regular periods and that the large amount of blood was build up. Other than that i bled in the amount of time the Dr. told me_ I think i was just fearful because my cycles had been so messed up in the past that i had never seen myself bleed That heavy or have clots at all! After I was prescribed Birth control pills to get me regular the pills i had made me flood very bad. I asked for a different pill and it was pretty good( Triphase 28) I continued to take them up until approx. 2yrs ago. Then i decided i wanted to concieve.

I didn't think it was ever going to stop but it did finally_ unless I miss a dose.,"Ive eaten almost nothing but pop tarts since I started these pills. I NEED them and will often go without dinner to have them instead. The hubby even knows the ""look"" I get when I am out and he immediately remedies this. It began immediately when I started the Provera. I chose pop tarts over other sweets because if I was eating worse things like candy bars I would be a moose by now.(I put on a lot of weight fast in the 5th month after having been steady losing since first beginning.) The nightmares leave me tired all the time as they are constant. However... The reasons I began the Provera were pretty bad and some of those pains have have all but stopped. I am presently trying to decide to end the treatment or to continue ""indefinitely"". I don't think there is any other way to contain the endo as it has spread to other parts of my body out of the ob/gyn field. It doesn't show on any tests and they can't do anything about it even if they could see it. (Doc's often stop wanting to treat you at this point) So I am leaning towards staying on it. I can't say its an easy decision but it does seem to be giving the endo a run for the money... As for the present mood swings_ It seems to me I was able to get it under control once my body got used to the Provera. I also switched pharmacies and found the generic brand the ""larger"" store had was MUCH Much worse on my moods. *cough walmart cough*  If anyone reading this deals with endo on this level and you",F,39,6  months20 1X D,5/5/2010Email,Provera

527, 3, DUB due to thick endometrial lining,No side effects until my thyroid began to function better due to a nearly ten percent weight loss. Suddenly_ I experienced diarrhea_ stomach cramps_ gas_ bloating_ extreme nausea_ headaches_ insomnia_ rashes_ dizziness_ extreme fatigue_ weakness_ excessive sweating and nervousness.,The medication did its job and stopped my DUB. However_ the side effects kind of erase the benefits. Provera facilitates thyroid hormone function. If one has a problem with their thyroid then they will have problems with taking Provera especially if they have hyperthyroidism or thyroid disease which is not properly regulated. I could not stay on the 60mg per day dose. It caused many symptoms which worsened and accumulated over time. The dose was changed to 40mg per day and soon I started having symptoms with that. I took 30mg for several months and suddenly had a bout of horrible diarrhea_ gas_ extreme nausea_ and stomach cramps. I thought it was a stomach virus. But soon I discovered that it was caused by Provera. Now I cannot take any because of extreme nausea_ stomach cramps_ and diarrhea. The symptoms of overmedication with thyroid medicine are similar to the side effects of Provera. These include headaches_ nervousness_ increased appetite_ increased sweating_ nausea_ insomnia_ rashes_ dizziness_ fatigue_ weakness_ bloating_ gas_ stomach cramps_ and diarrhea.

I started the second round of Provera at CD 35_ so I hope it will work again so I can increase my Clomid and hopefully ovulate!,F,27,14  days,1/15/2010Email,Provera

D & C was unsuccessful because of too much body fat. Im not bleeding alot basically spotting. but wear a pad everyday for the past five and half months is not funny. Stress on love life has caused my relation to breakup_ stress on the job hostile environment,So to comment about Provera I'm not feeling the the goal that my dorctored prescribe to me when  I put on the medication back in July 2009 taking in for 21 days and then stop. My menstrual has never stopped since the D&C. I'm very stressed mentally and physically. I go to work and go home and go to sleep before this I was a  normal person_ I used to go and party two -three days a week have not partied since July 2009 Don't have the desire to do no hobbies I used to do.

I have given it a fair try but will come off it now. I do not take the decision lightly as the only other alternative is removal of ovaries and hysterectomy though no guarantee of pain loss. I came off Provera for a month and the side effects disappeared_ pain got bad so I went back on it. Today I stopped taking it forever. I have tried all other medication for severe Endometriosis_ my doctor says. Sigh,F,36,13  months,12/30/2009Email,Provera

540, 4, To start Clomid,A little bit of cramping,I've had a pretty regular period_ every once in a while I would skip a month. Last month I took Clomid 50mg and it didn't work_ my period did not come this month so my doctor prescribed Provera.

545, 2, induce cycle to take Clomid,mild headaches_ mood swings,This is my second round of Provera (10 days/10mg).  The first round did not make my cycle begin. After reading the other posts_ it seems like this is an unusual occurence.  I contacted my doctor and went into his office to get blood tests done to make sure my levels were fine.  Everything turned out OK so I'm on my second round.  I hope it works this time so that I will be able to begin taking Clomid.  My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over a year.,F,29,2  months,12/3/2009,Provera

Extreme irritability_ lots of crying for no reason. It is the heaviest period I have ever had_ with the worst cramps. Blood is bright red and extremely heavy- going through huge overnight pads every 2 hours. Extreme fatigue. Have call into doctor now to question amount of bleeding. On the plus side_ I feel much less bloated in my stomach area- like I've lost a lot of weight or something.,,F,34,10  days,12/2/2009Email,Provera

My periods are regular_ it was given to me to stop hemmoraging. It did slow it down_ but I think it would have even without the medicine.   I see the doctor tomorrow (at 8 days.) I'm telling him how I feel_ and I want to stop this drug.,F,36,7  days,11/29/2009,Provera
549, 5, No period 5 months,The only side effect i had was increase hunger I was alwayes wanting to eat. I was trying to loose weight but my weight stayed the same.,i TOOK it because i didnt have a period for 5 months and i took it for seven days the they say 5 days after stopping it you period will come and that is exactly what happened and my period then lasted for a week. But now i have other promblems. But as far as taking it to get you period it worked good.,F,18,7  days,11/26/2009Email,Provera
550, 1, reduce spotting between periods,Took Provera for 10 days.  Period started 4 days later_ and has lasted for 14 days - and counting.  Have been laying in bed bleeding A LOT for the past 4 days.  Back to doctor twice to try to slow down heavy bleeding.  Nothing is working.  Getting weaker and weaker.  Will not do this again!,,F,48,19  days,11/26/2009,Provera
551, 4, To stop bleeding/shed uterus lining,Frequent urination_ intense craving for CHEESE_ increased energy_ dizziness after drinking caffeine (had to stop coffee habit)_ insomnia for the first round and increased sleepiness for the second round_ some breast soreness and bloatiness_ low-grade headache_ and mild leg cramps first couple of days taking drug_ which taking frequent walks alleviated.,Rx: once daily for 14 days_ then 14 days off the pill for a total of three months. I didn't experience any weight gain; in fact_ I think I lost some weight because I had so much nervous energy and couldn't keep still.  I also watched what I ate because I did not want to gain weight_ so that might have helped.  I have never had GERD on a continuous basis_ but I think the Provera gave me acid reflux.  I caught the stomach flu right before I was supposed to finish my last round_ so I can't really pinpoint for certain if Provera is totally responsible for my sour stomach.  In spite of all of these side effects_ the drug did stop the bleeding; my body must have needed the progesterone.   I will update my review in a month or so to see if it in fact has stopped it for good.,F,39,2  months,11/18/2009,Provera
552, 3, Extremely heavy_ irregular periods,Breast fullness (not a bad thing) and tenderness.,Doc has prescribed this medicine for me to take for 30 days.  I'm currently on day 8 without major side effects_ but am wondering what will happen later.,F,45,8  days,11/16/2009,Provera

557, 3, To stop  my excessive bleeding,Breasts were tender.  One day during the 10-day dosage_ I was extremely hungry.  Only one day that I can remember this happening to me.,My gyno prescribed this to me for 6 months.  I'm supposed to take the 10-day pill at the beginning of each month.  If my excessive bleeding does not stop_ he will recommend inserting the Mirena.  I was on B/C pills for 16 years and my periods were on time and normal.  Once I got off them - what a nightmare!  It's been a year and I've had nothing but problems with my periods.  I bleed so much that sometimes_ I feel I need to go to the hospital for a blood transfusion.  My first day on my period is ok but 2nd and 3rd are extremely heavy.  So heavy that I need to change tampon and pad every 30 minutes.  I just started taking Provera last month_ and my period this month was extremely heavy.  But_ I will give it 6 months to see what it does.,F,48,10  days,11/5/2009Email,Provera
558, 4, To induce period/PCOS,none,I started provera 10mg for 10 day on oct 17 and finished oct 26_ on oct 30 I started my period and I am 3 days into my period. My only complaint is that my period is 4 times heavier than it used to be although my Endocrinologist did forewarn me due to the fact that I have not had a period in 5 months and the cysts from the PCOS I would have a heavy period cos the lining of my uterus will need to shed all the accumulated cysts. I have bought 3 different types of pads and I change every 2 hrs..... that is how heavy it is.,F,27,10  days,11/2/2009,Provera
559, 5, endometriosis,None,I feel fantastic! After a year of constant pain I was pain free in 3 days. I take 10mg 3 times a day and have more energy than ever. I was warned about weight gain and did initailly gain some weight which I now have under control. Was it a side effect or just an excuse to eat more? Feel so good that the consultant advised me to continue on this rather than go for a hysterectomy. great relief>,F,49,10  months,11/1/2009Email,Provera
560, 2, to induce period,hot flashes_ mood swings_ acne_ weight gain_ bloating_ swollen breasts,I was prescribed 1 tablet for 10 days .  My understanding was I was supposed to get my period after completing the 10 days of taking provera.  The fifth day from when I began to take the provera I got my period.  I continued to take the medicine until gone like the prescription said to.  It's been about 2.5 weeks since I stopped taking provera and I have not gotten my period.,F,28,10  days,10/30/2009,Provera
561, 4, Induce period to take clomid,I took Provera for ten days_ didn't see a period until 9 days after I was finished taking Provera. I then had one day of red bleeding_ followed by nine days of brown discharge and some discomfort and insomnia_ followed by four more days of heavy bleeding_ then one more day of light discharge. It ended up being pretty drawn out_ but I hadn't had a period in three months_ so it helped! I am now awaiting my next period so that I can take Clomid and attempt to conceive!,,F,26,10  days,10/27/2009Email,Provera
562, 1, To induce a period,Depression_ anxiety,Took 10 mg daily for five days. Felt fine while taking the drug_ but since have felt extremely depressed and anxious. I've since read that it's contraindicated for anyone with a history of depression. It's meant to induce a period within five to seven days_ but it's eight days on_ and I've had no period_ only very_ very faint spotting three days after finishing my prescription. Physically have experienced no ill effects apart from some mild bloating.,F,34,5  days,10/19/2009,Provera

571, 2, To induce a period.,Increased appetite_ mild cramps,I stopped using birth control pills_ and never regained my period.  After about 60 days without a period_ my doctor put me on Provera for 12 days.  About 3 days after the last pill_ I had mild spotting for another 3 days_ but no real period.  I'm now pushing day 90_ and am scheduled for an ultrasound tomorrow.  There is no chance I'm pregnant.  I'm almost 38 years old_ and have never had any issues like this.

Now 3 days after taking the last pill for the month my cylce is starting again i'm hoping that its my cycle and not that crazy spotting again.If this meds do not help they can have my ovaries my ob told me that when you have irregular bleeding like that you are not shedding your lining well I hope this med work reading all of you guys stories is kind of making me not want to take provera.,F,29,1  months,8/20/2009,Provera
575, 1, To start my period.,Increased fatigue_ heavy bleeding with large clots_ moody.,My OB/GYN started me on a 5 day run of Provera_ last year (2008)to jump start my period_ as I thought I was going to have the Minera inserted in me. Since my doctor only inserts the Minera while women are menstruating_ I was so late that they finally started the Provera. I wish I never used that drug b/c I have NOT BEEN THE SAME SINCE last year! My periods are still very heavy and all messed up_ only from taking Provera for 5 days!

582, 3, Lack of period / PCOS,Extreme moodiness. I would become so angry and cried over everything_ even when I knew it was just the Provera. I had some bad cramping for the past week_ but that might just be me (back when I still had my AF).,"I was prescribed 10mg for 14 days because I hadn't had my AF for  1.5 years. It started on the 10th day of ingesting Provera_ and today is the 8th day of AF. It was really heavy for the past 6 days but it's ""medium"" right now.

584, 1, Lack of periods,Outrageous mood swings_ extreme fatigue_ excessive bleeding both in volume and length.,This was the worst experience I've ever had with a medication. The mood swings were VERY violent and so was I! I really felt the urge to truly punch people. At one point_ my anger would build so strong that my vision would blur for a split second. The bleeding was very heavy_ going through a super plus tampon and pad within 3 hours. I'm on day 13 of this right now and it's hell on earth. I've missed a week of work because of the side effects. Time to ask the doctor if there is another solution out there for me because this isn't it for sure!,F,28,8  days,7/21/2009,Provera

HEAVY bleeding for 3 days (so far - going though a pad AND tampon every 1.5 hours))_ but it's just doing what it's suppose to.  Quite a bit of cramping and lower back pain.

591, 4, Endometrial Cancer,appetite increase_ fatigue ( & insomnia)_ vivid dreams_ loss of libido_ muscle aches(thighs/calves).,"Haven't seen a lot of comments about the higher dosage_ so I thought I would add mine. I was prescribed 200mg for 10 days on/20 days off for 3 months. Did not start AF until day 18 after I stopped taking the med (yesterday). Dr said_ ""just keep taking it whether you have one or not"". Cramps are high_ flow is light (very bright colored)_ minimal clots (had very minimal flow while taking the med as well). Have been on higher dose progestins for over a year. Best way to control appetite is to become extremely regimented (eat food at the same time every day in same amounts); cut out sugars_ processed foods_ wheat_ dairy and fake sugars. My Dr said_ ""be prepared to gain 25-50 pounds"". I did. Once I regimented my eating_ I lost the weight I gained(albeit very slowly). The cravings DO go away if you improve your diet (lean towards lower carb and omit high allergy foods). Good luck! :)",F,37,10  days,7/2/2009,Provera

I did have spotting until day 3 and now...YEAH nothing now.  The spotting could have been from the biopsy that I unexpectedly received at my last DR appt. :o(  My doctor feels that I am having such heavy bleeding that doesn't stop due to my PCOS that I have previously been diagnosed.  I too have had some very vivid and weird dreams at night.  Did have cramping day 1-2_ have subsided.,Can't wait for my next appointment_ hopefully I won't have to take this monthly_ although the DR prescribed for 6 months of refills.  She said maybe I'll be on birth control such as Mirena or something else.  That sucks because I have had my tubes tied in order to not have to take such birth control.  But_ I will take birth control over surgery any day!  Good luck to all of you and god bless.,F,34,5  days,6/27/2009,Provera

So far I have noticed little change in my periods but I am so much happier_ less depressed and actually have an appetite which means that for the first time in years I can enjoy food without feeling sick and full after 1 mouthfull.,I have to go back for a scan in september to see whether it has helped with the polyps.

I've always had really bad cramps_ but usually I have heavy bleeding when I'm cramping like that. I'm nervous about how long my period is going to last. I've read a bunch of horror stories!!! Overall_ the drug has helped me start my period which is a relief. I really didn't have horrible side effects. Just a few that made me feel blah.

639, 4, induce period_ 4 mos without one,none so far. the pharmacist told me to only take it with food because it would definitely make me sick.  i quit taking birth control in september and have not had a period since.  never had a problem with irregular periods before_ so the doc said this should help get me started. only taking it for 5 days_ am on my 3rd day,,F,25,5  days,2/2/2009,Provera

642, 4, PCOS,HORRIBLE MOODINESS_DEPRESSION_DID NOT WANT TO BE BOTHERED WITH ANYONE.,I HAVE TAKEN PROVERA FOR YEARS NOW AND YES IT HELPS START MY PERIODS_ BUT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE CRAZY. MY OTHER OPTIONS WAS TO START BC PILLS TO REGULATE MY PERIODS BUT I COULDN'T TAKE THAT DUE TO SIDE EFFECTS AS WELL I WAS HAVING MAJOR HEADACHES AND EXTREME HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.,F,29,10  days,1/28/2009Email,Provera
643, 4, Heavy bleeding,Not much side effect except slight spotting.  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  I read that some people have their hearth pounding in their chess.  This is a sign of anemia as your hearth try to compensate for your low blood level of oxygen.  It is very important to go see your doctor to correct this anemia as it will only get worse.  I went to the hospital after heavy bleeding because my hearth started to beat very strong and fast after a slightest effort.  I could feel it pound in my chess and ears.  My anemia was at level 7_ and the doctors decided to give me intravenious iron instead of a blood transfusion due to the high risk of a blood transfusion.  Now I take 3 iron pilss (900mg) per day and it should take 2 to 3 months to go back to normal.  Provera pill (10mg) has stopped my heavy bleeding and so that now I can recover from anemia.  I think it is important to first know your level of natural hormones in order to know if Provera is right for you.  In my case_ I wish I could take it each,For now I am taking it to stop heavy bleeding from a uterine fibrom and it has work so far.  I am getting better because my anemia is slowly going away so no more palpitations and hearth pounding in my chess and ear.   I have no mood swing or anything bad on this pill.  I am hoping that this medication will prevent me from having hysterectomy_ which I really don't want since I am so close to menopause and after menopause most fibrom shrink anyway.,F,49,2  months,1/27/2009,Provera

647, 3, to control heavy prolonged bleeding,very tired_ slight dizzy spells_ breakthrough bleeding within an hour if I miss a dose (taking 3 times a day to stop the bleeding) breast tenderness and some cramping,I was taking this for a couple of months last year prior to having a d+c to remove the lining of my womb for biopsy and also to try to thin down the lining to make the bleeding less profuse. After the op I didn't need to take it again until last month for similar problems (had 8 months of normal periods) I have same symptoms again but am having a mirena coil fitted in an effort to stop the bleeding. I would prefer not to take this medicine but ended up with a blood count of 8 last year which was more debilitating than the side effects I have at the moment,F,48,30  days,1/16/2009,Provera

650, 5, Stop Bleeding/ Regulate Period,I have been extremely tired_ and have been experiencing major mood swings. Also slightly stronger cramps in my ovaries. And an increase in appetite.,I have PCOS and have been bleeding for 3+ months straight. My doc prescribed 10mg of Provera for 10 days and I am on day 3 and my period has already stopped.

651, 1, No Period for 2 years,No Side Effects when I was on it. I took the 10mg tablet 2x a day ( one in the morning( 7am) after breakfast and one after supper(7 pm)). Once off the pill_ the withdrawl bleeding was terrible. I woke up in the middle of the night in pain_ and I felt nauseous. I have never bled like that before.  would come back from my lectures and just crawl into bed and lay in the fetal position. The bleeding went on for 7 days and only got less on the 5th day.,Provera works_ but I think that my doctor gave me a dose that was too high_ and that is why my symptoms were so severe. With a lesser dose_ I think it would have worked like a charm!,F,21,10  days,1/5/2009,Provera

The only good side effect was that it cleared the few acne blemishes that I had.,I took one 10mg pill each day for 10 days (so 10 pills total.)  The 4th day after I was finished taking the pills I started my period.  When my period was over (duration of which was about 4-5 days)_ I started my BC pills right away to keep my cycle regular.  This drug really helped me out_ and the side effects were well worth the end result.  I have always had irregular periods and Provera_ along with birth control helps me out greatly.

663, 5, excessive bleeding for past 3 years,Luckly I have had little side effects with this drug.  I was told by my sister-in-law who took it_ to expect weight gain_ but I haven't.  It's been the reverse_ no appetite @ all!!  I've actually lost 5-10 pounds while taking this drug.  But yesterday I didn't take it @ the usual time & I had a break through bleed_ which ended immediately after I took the morning dose.  I'm on this med twice a day.,I've been placed on this drug because I have been bleeding for the past 3 1/2 yrs_ with only about 3 months break.  Because of this excessive bleeding_ I am 2 points away from needing a blood transfusion!!  My doctor has finally said a hysterectomy is necessary_ so I'm on this drug until January 2009_ when I can have the surgery.  My lining is so thick & my blood levels are so low_ that having surgery right now would require the blood transfusion.  SO I take Provera 10mg twice a day & take an iron tablet once a day.  I'm very pleased with the drug_ because I've not had to wear a pad since I started taking it.  Before then I had been wearing pads everyday for the past 3 1/2 years!!!  This all started after I gave birth to my son.  I have PCOS & before my son's birth_ I never had a period but once or twice a year.  That's why I was so surprised when I found out I was pregnant with my son.  I wasn't supposed to be able to have kids according to my old OBGYN!!,F,34,3  weeks,11/9/2008,Provera

I was told to take 10mgs a day daily for an unstated amount of time. I was also told that it would stop my period. I started taking it on October 21st. I had had a period on October 3rd. I didn't really notice any side effects at first but I did get a period on October 28th which was 2 days early pretty normal for me and it was a little shorter than normal_ lasted about 5 days instead of 7 but other than that was pretty normal. Only difference I noticed was I had no indication that it was coming_ my breast normally are sore and I have cramping before a period and I had none of this. Now as for the side effects just within the last week or so I have had major food cravings_ cramping in my pelvic area (but this could be the endometriosis)_ severe nausia that is worse at night_ I am on day 13 right now of my cycle so I should be right around ovulation and I am having cramping now a,F,30,20  days,11/9/2008Email,Provera

The huge blood clots ceased after the 3rd day of taking Provera and my bleeding stoped 5 days later. Unfortunately for me I started bleeding again (14th of taking meds) this morning with SERVERE CRAMPING AND BACK PAIN! The ER wanted to take Provera for 14 days_however my OB/GYN prescribed 4 additional months of this medication. I have gained weight but that is because the ER Dr. told me to take Provera with food.

The second shot was to stop my severe period that the first one had given me.  I was severely anemic and the doctor advised me to get the second one to stop my period.  I didn't want it but she said it would work_ so I got it.  Well_ it worked to well and over a year later I still didn't have my period back.  Scared of never being able to have children again I went to several doctors and they didn't know what to do until I FINALLY found one that prescribed me PROVERA... 10 DAYS_ 10 MGS_ and my period returned three days after my last dose.  I had horrible mood swings to deal with (although I think my husband got the worst end of that deal!) but it was all worth it!!!!  I finally feel like me again and I have my period back!!!

677, 3, shed uterine lining-endo cells,NONE!! Nothing unusual at all_ but also no bleeding and I was under the impression I needed to bleed to shed lining.,I just started Provera and have been on 10mg for 8 days. I read this website in preparation and even emailed a couple of you directly. After reading all this stuff I was petrified to take this medication. I expected immediate horrible side effects_ but have had none nada zippo. Part of me is happy but also wondering if it is working. Even stranger is I kind of feel alittle less bloated and not so much pressure in my abdomen. I have had gas but that could be from anything. I am hoping the weight gain doesn't happen. I probably won't notice that for a month or so but that I cannot afford. In fact that is what I believe put me in this predicament to begin with. The prolonged excess weight caused excessive estrogen which caused endo cells to show in my pap. I am to be on provera for 6 months so I will keep you updated to any changes.,F,42,8  days,10/6/2008Email,Provera

I took for 10 days and then the ""shedding"" began roughly five to seven days later. Today (10 days later) is now beginning to slow up a bit to what a regular period would be. The sick feeling was awful_ although I never threw up_ I constantly had bouts that made me feel as if I could at any time. I was tired constantly and just wanted to sleep. My moodiness was pretty evident too. I did not experience weight gain with this as I felt nauseus most of the time.  I wish I had asked my ob/gyn about what to expect BEFORE I took my trip!

I had a history of depression and_ while I had gone a long time without feeling any lows_ Provera scared me. I had frequent crying spells and (I am in college) thought about transferring schools/taking a semester off or dropping out.,After taking Plan B twice_ gaining weight_ and undergoing severe stress_ my period became extremely irregular (once every three months) and I was put on Provera about a week and a half ago to induce menstruation again. It was horrible to be on this drug during the first week of this school year. I was completely emotionally disrupted and distracted_ and I decided to stop taking Provera three days early -- I was supposed to take 10 mg each day for 10 days and I only did for a week. Now that I have started withdrawal bleeding (two days after I stopped taking the drug)_ I have had severe cramps (though not as incapacitating as those accompanying my normal periods; women in my family have a history of Dysmenorrhea) and even heavier bleeding than normal. I  have worn Super Plus tampons for the past three days. Nonetheless_ I am glad that I had withdrawal bleeding as expected and hope that I can expect menses next month and the month after that.,F,19,7  days,9/13/2008,Provera

I also experience some moodiness and feelings of depression around my cycle_ but have always had this.,I have always had very regular cycles with heavy bleeding and clots_ which improved for a couple of years after each of my pregnancies. After turning 45 my periods started to get heavier and heavier--eventually they became so bad that I was afraid to leave the house and had to wear a diaper as backup to go to work. It was terrible. Finally_ I had a D&C and was put on Provera every month for days 14 to 26. Within a couple of days of stopping the Provera_ my period begins.  I was disappointed at first that I continued to have very heavy periods with clots and hemorraghes (so that I couldn't leave the bathroom). However_ by the third month my period was the best it had been for years. The fourth month I felt confident leaving the house. Provera seems to work better after you have been on it for awhile. In my case it has been worth it. i'm just trying to ride things out until menopause.

At one point I got up to make yet another trip to the bathroom and I just about flipped when I experienced the rush of blood.

I even managed to lose 3 of the extra 5 pounds I'd put on during summer holidays. After the tenth day I had a very heavy bleed which lasted 7 days. During this time I experienced a pronounced mood crash. I felt really_ really low and very tired. I was scared that the bleed would go on and on_ but it did stop after a week and my mood improved. I've felt fine since.,I was wary of taking this drug - particularly as my doctor had prescribed such a large dosage (30mgs per day). Generally I prefer to steer clear of synthetic hormones if possible. But it did stop my menorrhagia_ and I was very glad of that.

My period lasted almost two weeks. Again I took the pills first 10 days of June. My period started June 13. I had the same experience as in May except my period lasted 9 days ending June 21.

Also had one day of heavy bleeding with clots (sorry if TMI) during period and several days of spotting (unusual for me).,I took Provera 10 mg for 10 days.  Well_ it did what it was supposed to do:  start my period.  I read the average length to induce a period after your last pill is 3-14 days.  I didn't start until 18 days following my last pill_ and the PMS symptoms started even during the 10 days I was taking the pill.  So it seemed like a lengthy time to have the symptoms.  But really the symptoms were all things I have every time I had a period_ just more intense (but tolerable).  Because I took Clomid following this medicine_ it's hard to differenciate between symptoms from Provera_ normal PMS and Clomid.  I think overall Provera made me moodier than usual (sad_ crying) and gave me a feeling of fullness_ almost like I should still be bleeding.  But it worked for me and I was prepared for symptoms due to it being a hormone.,F,34,10  days,6/5/2008,Provera

Supposed to be every other month but can only handle it / willing to put my family through it every 4-6 months.

724, 3, uncontrolled hemmoraging,Mood Swings,Day 2 the swinging starts. I get irrational_ easily upset_ and EXTREMELY mad over small things. It is very easy to hurt my feelings while on Provera. I took a 4 mile walk (just walked out the door at 9 pm) tonight to get away from my husband - who all other times is wonderful! I only take Provera when I start my period (once every 4 months or so)_ but have been on it for almost 2 years,F,37,4  days,5/24/2008Email,Provera

728, 4, painful prolonged periods and PMS,mild acne_ frequent spotting and zero sex drive.,I took this for 20 days every month for 3 months. My periods became much lighter_ less painful and reduced to only 5 days. Fantastic! My mood swings were less extreme and it completely eliminated my pre-menstrual sleeplessness which helped a lot. The acne got worse with each month. That combined with the loss of sex drive decided me to stop taking it.,F,39,3  months,5/22/2008,Provera

My Doctor didn't mention anything severe to be concerned about. I haven't had a period since January. Before that I was very regular. I stopped taking the pill in July and was hoping that we would be like many other couples and be blessed with a child the old fashion way_ no luck so far.

I feel tired_ fuzzy and generally off.  And I don't think the bleeding's slowing at all.,My Dr. told me if symptoms don't improve after 3 days of taking Provera_ to take 2 10mg tabs per day.

However_ I have caught myself trying to hold my eyes open if I sit down for a few minutes to do something. I have also started spotting and it is only my second day on the provera.,Is it normal to start spotting so early? Will I eventually get a regular period?  I had a miscarriage in December and have had irregular periods the past three months and then this month_ I just didn't start at all.  My doctor thinks I am not ovulating regularly and is going to start me on Femera once I start my period to hopefully induce ovulation.  Is anyone else going through this?

I had a miscarriage in Dec_ had a regular period on Feb 1st and then nothing since then (all preg tests negative).

740, 2, Induce Period/PCOS,Acne_ extreme irritability_ sleepiness followed by insomnia_ cramping on one side or the other,My doctor prescribed Provera (10mg_ for 12 days) to help regulate my periods. I have also been advised that the best way to discourage symptoms of PCOS is weight loss. I have only been on the medication for 2 months and haven't had any changes as far as my period goes. The side effects are not worth it for me. Basically I end up hating everything and everyone around me and the acne is really aggravating. The whole point of losing weight is getting yourself to the gym to do it. I certainly don't want a medication hindering that motivation.,F,29,12  days,4/5/2008,Provera

Moody but not too bad - CRAVING sugar though_ cannot stop eating! Pass the chocolate!,I started taking it as a treatment for heavy periods - however STARTED bleeding (breakthrough bleeding) whilst taking it. I was on approx 40 mg a day. I had to cease taking it as I bled for 30 + days and ended up in emergency getting a blood transfusion as I bled so much it was horrific! I am now back on them to stop the bleeding until they insert a thing called a Marena which is an IUD which can sit in the womb for up to 2 years and releases progesterone.I tell you ladies our uterus's have a lot to answer for!!,F,32,20  days,3/31/2008Email,Provera

Feeling heavy PMS cramps the last 2 days_ but that's a good thing because it means ""she's"" coming along hopefully.

744, 1, To regulate cycles,,My OB GYN prescribed Provera to regulate my periods in attempts to get pregnant.  I have not taken any of the medication yet_ I was just surfing the internet for feedback on this drug when I came across this column.  After reading these comments I am deciding that I may just wait the 2 or 3 month stretch for my menses to start on their own rather than put myself through this torture.  I am already battling anxiety and depression apart from this so who knows how much worse it may make this.  I know everyone reacts differently to medications_ but from past experiences I know that my body is very sensitive.  Can any one offer advice?  Also_ more importantly_ have any of you successfuly conceived after taking Provera?  How many cycles did it take you?  I am glad I found this site and will let you know how my experience with Provera goes IF I work up the courage to follow through with the doses.  Good luck to all you ladies!,F,28, ,3/26/2008,Provera

I can last >6 months without my period so my doctor prescribed provera to induce my periods. At first she told me to take it every 3 months_ then said if I wanted to I could take it every month.  What I didn't know was it was a step to take clomid pills.  Which I'm happy about because I want to start trying to conceive this summer.  Since I am irregular it will be harder for me to conceive_ and was considering taking clomid or any other fertility pills.  This board also made me feel better knowing that I wasn't the only one going through this.,F,26,6  months,2/25/2008Email,Provera

I haven't had a period in 7 months so this one is going to be a whopper.  Also it is a hormone so you are bound to feel maybe a tad more on edge or hormonal than normal.

HA. I looked it up online and saw thousands of sites with my symptoms listed there as side effects. I called another nurse who listened to my symptoms incredulously and said ""you must be getting the flu...the hot flashes MAY be from the provera but i've never heard of the others being side effects"". Does that seem odd to anyone else? That two fertility specialist nurses would be so ignorant to the potentially terrible side  effects of something they are prescribing??? And to not even look it up or consider that it might be the meds? THEY RECOMMENDED THAT I STAY ON MEDROXYPROGESTERONES despite the fact that I couldn't work_ drive_ walk my dogs_ or get out of bed.

762, 5, Irregular periods,heavy bleeding_ little more tired than usual,After reading through these comments_ I see that medications really effect people differently.  I did not have any problems with Provera.  I did experience heavy bleeding_ but it's supposed to shed the lining of the uterus_ so that's just something you'll have to face when you take this.  It's annoying to change your tampon several times a day_ but it's for the benefit of your health_ so it's a small sacrifice to pay.  I'd rather have to deal with that than deal with complications of the lining not shedding.  I did notice that I felt a little tired during the time I took it_ but no big deal.  It definately did what it was supposed to do. I've been very happy with it.,F,25,10  days,1/29/2008,Provera

Acne.,I will never take this medication again and I'm going to tear my doctor a new one for even thinking that poisoning me like this was acceptable. The risks are insane...I would rather take my chances with an increased risk of endometrial cancer than take something that will increase my risk of breast cancer_ stroke_ heart attack and blood clots.

783, 2, OB-GYN prescribed it,First of all_ I've been on Provera since around 3/2006 for a few days here & there and was put on indefinately in 5/2006. Over this year_ I noticed that I was VERY EXHAUSTED--sleeping nearly all day on Saturdays. Two weeks ago_ I had uncontrollable crying--not even thinking that it could be because of the provera. I've had mood swings_ depression (I think). I haven't had these things as a norm_ so when it first started_ I just thought it was something wrong with me_ or because I was just pre-menapausal (which I am).I've been to my obgyn twice this year (have another follow-up on 12/18) and each time_ he asks me if I've noticed mood swings or depression. At that time (June 2007)_ I hadn't noticed it. A friend recently mentioned it the past three months. I am going to ask my ob-gyn to either remove me from the provera or reduce the dosage. I take it once a month the first 10 days of the month. I take 5 mg (was 10 mg earlier this year_ but he reduced it).I'd rather take my,"I wasn't told about any ""possible"" side affects from my doctor nor my ob-gyn (and my primary care was fully aware that I was on provera). It wasn't until I mentioned it to someone that they advised me to do a search_ and I found this site just now.Wish I would have done this long ago instead of assuming what I was going through was normal.

On the day of my last pill_ I started to spot_ very minimally_ and had light cramping_ so I thought it was my period. This light spotting continued for the next day or so_ and then stopped. I waited a few days_ then weeks_ and then finally_ 41 days later_ without any signs like cramping or breast tenderness_ I got my period. It was a pretty normal flow_ and lasted only two days. But_ I still got it_ so I guess I can't complain. I had no cramps_irritability or fatigue. My ob/gyn called in a prescription for birth control_ which I just started today. So_ overall I guess I had a pretty good experience with Provera. I never knew that I would have to wait 41 days to get my period (I read that it would be much_ much sooner) and I still have no idea as to why my period stopped in the first place.

Being most concerned with the mood swings and weight gain_ I was not too thrilled about going on the med; however_ my mother had uterine cancer and I knew that this was something I had to do. Before Provera_ I was very moody_ tired all the time_ and chronically constipated. Now_ it seems as those these ailments have disappeared. I went on Provera because I had no choice_ this cancer is in my genes. I am sure that this will not be the last time; however_ the side effects were not nearly as bad as I thought they would be.

833, 1, to ger rid of ovarian cyst,MOOD SWINGS_ HORMONAL HAIR_ NUMBNESS IN THIGHS COULDNT WALK FOR 3 DAYS,My gyno prescribed provera to me as a means of getting rid of a last cyst i had growing on my ovary. I took it and after 3 days i felt moody_ my partner couldnt stand me_ and then i felt a numbness in my thighs and i couldnt walk for days! i called my gyno and he told me to stop taking it straight away. a few months down the track now and i have hormonal hair EVERYWHERE! face_ cheeks_ breasts. i wish i never used it!!!!!,F,22,5  days,9/20/2007Email,Provera
834, 4, Induce a period,Headache_ still had some spotting while taking medication. Heavy cramping and bleeding once started period day after stopping medication.,Went to Dr. after slight spotting for almost two weeks.  Last normal period was almost 3 months ago.  Figured it was just pre-menopause problem. Dr. put me on 10mg for 5 days to induce a normal period after an ultrasound showed I did have a build up of endrometrial lining. Only real discomfort while taking the pill was a slight headache last two days.  Other than that felt fine. No weight gain_ irritability_ or any of the other problems noted on this site. I did_ however_ keep spotting. Mostly after my nightly gym routine (1/2 hr. weights; 1/2 hr cardio).  Medication did the trick because I started a period day after taking the last pill.  Did have heavy bleeding and cramping with this but over the counter analgesic did the trick. I'm just hoping the bleeding does not last too long.  Don't want to end up going in the other direction now.,F,49,5  days,9/19/2007,Provera
835, 3, induce period,I did not experievce anything but BAD MOOD SWINGS!!!!!,So I took the provera for 5 days and they told me that I would start my period around the 3rd or 4th day.   NO  I did not start till around my 10 day.  Anyways so I started on my b. c. pills to help with my period (eversince my tubal I have problems with it) and I woke up this morning and I could hardley move.  I have cramps so bad_ it actually feels like contractions_ and my period is nothing like it used to be.  It is like Hudini.  There one minute and gone the next.  Only to reappear later.  And the clotting is real bad!!!!  Beware using this brig!!!,F,25,5  days,9/17/2007Email,Provera
836, 3, induce period to start Clomid - TTC,breast tenderness (DEFINITELY nipples!)_ fatigue_ extreme sugar cravings_ lightheadedness,Well.. so far I have been on Provera's generic form for 5 days. I started taking the drug on Tuesday and I should be done Monday night_ I have a 7 day dose. I went off the Pill in March and went 48 days without a period_ then 43 days_ and then nothing since July 11. The husband and I have been married for a year and a half and we are trying to conceive ASAP. I was definitely freaking when there was no period but after numerous negative pregnancy tests (not to mention endless frustration)_ I went to the doctor and he put me on this to start my period and then start taking Clomid on day 5-9. Am hoping this works. I was on the Pill for 6 years and am getting frustrated! I know lots of people have been trying much longer than us_ but I am a very impatient person. I wanna start NOW. But so far nothing bad has happened on Provera_ just what I listed at the top. Anyone feel free to email me_ I just feel a little comforted knowing that other people are in the same position I am!

838, 3, amenorrhea,slight cramping  - slight bloating - increased appetite,Well ladies I am seeing some very interesting info about Provera.  As with all medications this will affect everyone differently.  I do se where some were asking what are they looking for when they test your hormone levels.  Just that hormone levels_ which are a precursor to many things_ PCODS & early menopause for example. Just hang in there ladies.,F,27,10  days,9/12/2007,Provera

I went to see my doctor and my bloodwork showed that my FSH level was 62.  She prescribed Provera 5mg for 5 days.  It has been 14 days since I ended my provera and still no period.  It has been 71 days since my last period.  I am very concerned.  The one thing provera did do was cure my hot flashes!,F,30,5  days,9/11/2007,Provera

843, 3, clean uterine lining,achiness_ mood swings_ extremely painful cramps_ hives_breast tenderness.,Two months ago_ my doctor discovered pre-cancerous cells in polyps attached to my uterine lining. It was also discovered that I produce too much estrogen_ and therefore I was put on provera to thin out my uterine lining and protect me from a more serious outcome in the future. (uterine cancer). I have to take 10 millgrams a day for 90 days. I started 23 days ago. The first week I felt like I had the flu mixed in with some wicked mood swings I believe my boyfriend is still recovering from.  It's a little bit better now_ but I got a period last week and woke up screaming in the middle of the night due to the severity of my menstrual cramps.  But I have to take the medication_ and I can only hope it does what it is supposed to do. Here are some things that have helped me. I rest when I need to rest. I cry when I need to cry. I don't drink alcohol (at least not for the next 67 days). I drink lots of water and I work out when I am feeling well enough.

I am only taking 10mg 3 x a day but the effects are not great.,I have not read many good comments about this drug and would like to come off it but have to wait till I see my Gyno.

847, 4, To start period for clomid,I was SO BLOATED.  Felt moody and had incredible cramping.  But that was only for the first few days.  After about the 4th day everything was back to normal.  I even lost a few pounds from when I first started!  I had some hot flashes as well but I'm still not sure that was due to the meds.  I've always had them at night.,First of all I guess I should state that I was on my period for about 20 days when my doctor told me to start taking this.  It was supposed to make me stop bleeding and then start up again.  Yesterday was the last day of the meds and I'm still spotting but waiting now to start full on.  Then 5 days after that start on the Clomid.  I'm not too young and my husband and I are trying for our 1st child.  Hopefully this works.  I've got the strangest body ever!  2 to 3 periods a year!  Yikes!,F,32,10  days,8/30/2007,Provera

849, 4, Regulate menses,While taking the pill: slightly more irritable/emotional than normal. The week after: Slightly fatigued_ some lower back pain_ breast tenderness_ and my uterus feels sore.,I left a comment on 3/18/07 the first time I took Provera. The longer you go without having a period_ the worse Provera will be. I hadn't had a period for over a year at that time and after provera I gushed blood for about 5-6 days straight just shedding all the uterine build up. I'd suggest having available sick time off from work before using Provera just in case you feel you need to stay home. It wasn't really painful_ but my period soaked through BOTH heavy-duty pads and tampons after 2-3 hours. Blood was everywhere. This time it's only been about 5 months_ and I notice a difference. I have a really heavy flow_ but not enough to impair me from working. My Doc. has me on Provera for one week every 3 months. Provera gets the job done_ at least for me. There's a lot of scary posts about it_ and it is uncomfortable_ but it isn't the end of the world.,F,23,7  days,8/27/2007,Provera

Meanwhile_ I became forgetful_ I felt cold_ cried at the slightest provocation_ had very low energy and was just more depressed than I'd ever considered possible. Four days after I had discontinued taking the drug_ I felt normal again and I concluded that Provera withdrawal must have been causing my mysery.I had already felt somewhat depressed on the days when I was taking 15 mg; this happened each time for a few hours_ just before my next dose was due. On my second visit to the doctor I mentioned this_ but he did not draw the conclusion that this was a side-effect of the drug. He never mentioned possible side-effects anyway_ and the tablets (which I got in New Zealand) did not come with an inform,,F,47,12  days,8/12/2007,Provera

I took provera 10mg for 10 days; I experienced water retention (felt sooo bloated)_ slight cramps_ had a hunger that could not be satisfied and was a bit of a grump but I would say this is mild to what some women suffer from before their periods.  It only took 2 days for my periods to start after stopping the provera.  I would recommend you try it as it worked for me_ I read some horror stories beforehand which put me off initially but I am glad that I gave it a try.  Good luck to you all!

I didn't get a period for September which I knew was because my cycle wasn't back to normal as of yet. I got a period in October and all was fine. So I thought. I didn't get a period for the months of November and December. I wasn't pregnant however. I went to my doctor and told her my problem. She prescribed a 10 prescription of Provera. She told me to take the pills after New Years 2007 but on January 4th_ 2007-my period came. What a relief! No period for the month of February however so I took the Provera pills for 10 days and the third day after I stopped the pills-my period finally graced its presence.

948, 1, induce period,Extreme bloating_ soaring appetite_ bad acne_ weight gain_ moodiness_ fatigue_ depression,I was put on 10mg Provera for 10 days to induce a period (hadn't menstruated in 4 months). I had come off BC pills a year before_ and my cycle had gone from being normal_ to about 2 months long... then nothing. As soon as I started Provera_ the side effects began. The acne was awful_ the bloating made me want to shoot myself. I stopped at day 7 because I couldn't take it anymore. I got my period the next day_ but it was fairly light. Now_ 3.5 months later_ I feel like Provera is still in my system. My last two cycles have given me the worst acne_ bloating and weight gain of my life. My appetite has gotten out of control.

By day 5 of the pills_ I was moody/aggitated but it was nothing more than PMS. The second day after my last pill_ I was spotting a bit. On the third day_ I got my full period.

1051, 2, to have a monthly cycle,Major weight gain_ headaches_ periods of insomnia and fatigue.,My doctor put me on this medication 'cause I was not having a cycle at all after 3 months after having my son.  I took this for 3 months and absolutely nothing happened_ except I can only remember the major weight gain as the biggest problem.  Who wants that after having a baby?!  Yet_ I guess I am very fortunate_ I guess I have a condition in which the doctor felt I was lucky to have had the 2 boys I do have(8 yrs. apart and wasn't trying for either).  I feel for anyone that has fertility problems.  Maybe this is the drug for you if you do have fertility issues_ yet mine was to simply feel normal and healthy and have a period_ and it didn't create one for me.  I've always felt that it seems like when you're trying things don't work_ yet when you aren't things happen the way you could have only dreamed!!!,F,29,3  months,4/12/2005,Provera

I take this in pill form_ not Depo shot (you couldn't get me near a Depo shot_ which really wrecks your hormones_ if you paid me). Difficult to get the dose and timing right_ though.  Doc initially told me to just take it the first 10 days of the month (and then first 20 days of the month when we upped the dose) because my periods were irregular -- bleeding was still heavy until I changed it follow my natural cycle (when I used to have it) more by taking the last 10 days and first 10 days of every month.
