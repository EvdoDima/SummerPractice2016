0, 3, condom broke,Pill worked but my regular period came a week early and is still going. I've been on my period for the last 23 days_ I gained almost 10lbs_ get headaches_ strong cramps_ bloating_  fatigue_  and breast tenderness.,Worked for what I needed it for_ but the side effects are almost as awful as being pregnant.,F,32,1  days,7/22/2016,Plan b
1, 1, Forgot to use BC,None,Will not work if near ovulating. I'm freaking 49 and still got pregnant. Who does this work for then?,F,49,1  days1pill,11/12/2015Email,Plan b
2, 1, To prevent any unwanted pregnancies,I experienced chest tightness within hours of taking the pill and ended up in the ER for irregular heart beat which had never happened before_ scariest thing ever. Don't think I'll ever take this again. I also didn't have any bleeding,This is my second time taking this_ first time I had no side effects.,F,24,1  days 1X D,3/20/2015,Plan b
3, 3, Prevent pregnancy,Ocular migraine.      I also found out it is ineffective on women over 165 pounds.    I took Ella this time (3 years later ) and had no side effects.,,F,34,1  days1 pill,12/7/2013,Plan b
4, 5, Prevent pregnancy,None,I have used it twice in 6 years and both times it worked. I want to make clear that it is NOT an abortion pill like one reviewer stated. If you are already pregnant_ it won't do anything. What happens is it prevents the sperm from getting to the egg_ since sperm can live for a few days in your body and since the egg can be fertilized for several days after its released_ means that conception can take place days after sex.It does NOT cause an abortion. Also_ it is a higher dose of the same active ingredient in your run of the mill birth control pill.,F,23,2  days 1X D,11/5/2012Email,Plan b
5, 5, Condom Broke,No major side effects except for mild bloating and a heavier than normal period.,I have taken Plan B 4 times over the past 10 years (with the same partner). Condoms unfortunately break. 3 times I took it within 24 hours_ although one time I wasn't able to get it until it had been 48 hours. I haven't gotten pregnant either of those times. My pharmacy is Walgreens_ and they have never denied filling the prescription for me.,F,28,1  days 2X D,10/18/2011,Plan b
6, 5, To prevent pregnancy,none :),Didn't experience any side effects and did the job it was supposed to.  Very thankful to have another option in case of an accident.,F,24,1  days 1X D,6/29/2011Email,Plan b
7, 4, Emergency contraceptive( EC),nausea_ moodiness_ feeling overall weird for a week_ light bleeding towards end of week_ disrupted cycle,This thing works. All types (generic etc) ive taken it twice in my lifetime. if you take it correctly it should work. you will not feel like yourself for a week after taking it. You will so moody. and tired. at the end of 5 days i start getting some bleeding. It was 5 weeks later till i got my normal period_ and my period after that one was late as well. so_ its not exactly fun_ but if u have to take it_ do it. oh but where i live you have to be 18 to get it (or have adult get it for you),F,21,1  days 2X D,4/14/2011Email,Plan b
8, 5, Prevent Pregnancy,Nausea_ dizziness_ heavier period and cramps when my period arrived but it was right on schedule.,I had to take this when I had just switched birth control and the backup method failed; I wanted to be extra sure because my husband and I are not ready for children yet. I would recommend this to anyone whose bc fails. The few side effects were worth the added safety I felt from taking this.,F,25,2  times 1X D,11/1/2010,Plan b
9, 1, To prevent pregnancy when other BC,no side affects at all,This EC did not work for me not once but TWICE. The first time it failed me i took it 3 hours after intercourse. the second time it failed me i took it 20 minutes after intercourse-i went straight to the pharmacy. I wonder if its a coincedence that both slip-ups were with the same partner...prehaps we just have great chemistry!Im 5 months preggers with our second child.,F,33,2  times 1X AN,3/17/2010,Plan b
10, 5, Emergency Contraception,None!,"Plan B is amazing. I have taken it three times and have never gotten pregnant. Additionally_ I have never had any side effects.ALSO: In regards to previous posts_ this is NOT the ""abortion pill"" known as RU-486. This is essentially a high dose birth control pill taken after a contraceptive failure. It prevents pregnancy_ does NOT end it.",F,21,3  times,12/20/2008,Plan b
11, 5, Condom fell off,None really_ my doc also prescribed compazine for any nausea that might occur.  I was able to function like I do on a normal day!,This is a great medicine!  I would recommend it to any female that needs emergency contraceptive.,F,24,2  days,9/27/2008,Plan b
12, 4, Condom Fell Off,Naseau_ Fatigue_ Full-out period within days of taking it,My period started within days of taking this pill when it wasn't due for another two weeks.  It was a full period.  Have continued to have an upset stomach a week and half after taking it.  Also_ breast were extremely swollen and sensitive.  Very_ very tired.,F,27, ,11/21/2007,Plan b
13, 5, condom fell off,heavier period with worse cramps than usual_ but nothing extreme.,love it!,F,19,3  times,8/2/2007,Plan b
14, 5, emergency contraception,I got lots of breakthrough bleeding about 5 days after taking it_ and then I got my period (early) around a week after that.  My skin broke out really badly for a few days the first time I took it.  But all in all_ no big deal.,I think this is a great product.  I wish it were cheaper and that you didn't have to ask the pharmacist to get it from behind the counter.  My local Walgreen's and CVS have it_ as well as Planned Parenthood.  It is very effective_ especially when taken quickly after sex.  I've taken it twice and would definitely take it in the future_ though hopefully I won't need to since I'm on the BC pill now.,F,27, ,5/21/2007,Plan b
15, 3, condom breakage - see post below,see post below,to continue my post below... my Dr. said it's normal I didn't bleed right after taking Plan B.  My cycle is normally very consistent_ and after Plan B it came 3 days early.  Too soon to know yet whether it will as consistent in coming months as in the past,F,25,1  months,5/19/2007,Plan b
16, 3, condom breakage,Chest tightness and pain,I used Plan B for the first time recently - 7-10 days later I experienced tightness in my chest which was strong enough that breathing normally was painful and I feared I would need to go to an emergency room despite being without health insurance. The tightness lasted several hours and I simultaneously experienced slight numbness in a part of my left hand.I didn't make the connection between Plan B and the chest tightness until I read of chest tightness on this site as a reaction to a birth control pill (demogen_ in that case).  I've never experienced internal chest tightness before_ and according to my doctor my age and health profile puts me at extremely low risk for any kind of heart issue (which presumably would be a more typical cause of chest pain).  Nothing I did around the time of that major chest pain was at all out of the ordinary_ which is another reason I'm linking the episode to Plan B.Beyond that - I didn't bleed right after taking it_ which my doctor claims is n,F,25,1  months,5/19/2007,Plan b
17, 1, condom fell off,Nausea_ headache_ and delayed period,"I'm really pissed that no one told me that Plan B can also work AFTER conception by thinning out the lining of my uterus so the week-old embryo can't implant.  I thought it only postponed ovulation so I wouldn't get pregnant.  After a condom slip-up_ I figured Plan B was a good backup to prevent pregnancy_ since I was right in the middle of my cycle.  Maybe it delayed ovulation long enough to prevent conception_ or for all I know_ I conceived and Plan B made the embryo abort.  I'll never know.  I'm SO ANGRY that I wasn't told by my doctor or pharmacist that this was how it works - all you ever hear is ""it's not an abortion pill.""  BS - what else can you call a pill that at times allows conception and then kills off the embryo?  Women should be fully informed about this drug so they can make their own choices about whether that's acceptable to them or not.  I'll never use this pill again.",F,29,2  days,7/20/2006,Plan b
18, 5, condom broke,none really; a little emotional. but nothing significant. No nausea_ etc. I took the 1st pill within 3 hours of accident. I was not on the pill at the time. And there was no other backup method of birth control. planB prevented pregnancy absolutely. And to add to that_ I am bipolar and take 2 anticonvulsants (Topamax and Trileptal) which decrease the effectiveness of any birth control pill_ and STILL plan B worked for me. If that doesn't say plan B works I don't know what does.,Just make sure your pharmacy is NOT Walmart because they reserve the right to deny planB (abortion pills) to clients. It is injustice_ yes. LUckily_ my pharmacy was Walgreens for my PlanB rx and the pharmacist was a young female like me. It went very smoothly and it was in the middle of the night when I had to go get planB.,F,31,1  days,6/19/2006,Plan b
