1, 3, Depression,Paxil has given me the most wildest dreams. Almost like lucid dreaming ir something.. A lot of night mares too. Dejvu times 2_ I see things in my dreams daily and see them again in real life it's almost confusing lol idk. It's made me lose my appetite as well a bit. I get dizzy and zone out a lot.

3, 4, Anxiety & Depression,Fatigue- but this could be from the pain patch I wear_ also or the combination.,"This medicine works better for my anxiety & depression together than any I have tried. I am 52 now and it's been almost a lifelong issue_ off & on_ so I've tried them all pretty much. Some work well for depression_ but a"" amp"" me up - others well for anxiety_ but put me to sleep. This is a very good med for me. I do feel a little flat_ but I take Paxil & a strong pain med for nerve damage_ so can't tell you which does which? I don't have a ton of energy & don't sleep well_ but I don't think that's Paxil_ again. I feel secure_ pretty happy & fairly even almost all the time         which is amazing:)",F,52,3  years15 mg,5/6/2016,Paxil

I was suffering enormously from depression and anxiety_ especially the latter. I wanted to be dead_ just to stop feeling_ but was too distressed to even think about suicide. And this drug has helped. I understand it's difficult to get off of_ but I've discussed strategies with my psychiatrist_ so I'm not worried. In fact_ I'll never get off of it if it continues to work. I'd been on Prozac for 18 years_ until it finally ""pooped"" out.",M,67,1  years20 mg 1X D,2/17/2016EmailHistory,Paxil

8, 5, PTSD_ Anxiety Disorder_ Agoraphobia,Appetite Increase_ nausea if not taken with food_ takes about 4 times longer to orgasm than when not on the medication,For the last nine years_ I was trapped inside my home with severe panic attacks.  I had severe avoidance problems.  I needed help from people to get groceries_ wouldn't go to doctor appointments and struggled with suicidal thoughts.  Before Paxil_ I tried many medications that did not work.  If I take my Paxil_ the dark thoughts and fears go away and I am able to leave my home_ and have even started driving a car again.  I have even applied to college_ which I would never have dreamed of doing before I started taking Paxil.  My quality of life has greatly improved.  The downside is that it makes me extremely hungry all of the time_ so I must always be munching on low calorie foods_ like carrot sticks or bell pepper slices_ to alleviate that symptom.,F,27,3  months10mg 1X D,1/11/2016,Paxil
9, 1, anxiety,Nausea diarrhea shaking dizziness,I was put on this drug because of anxiety. About 2 hours after taking it I had really bad diarrhea and nausea. My heart started racing. My normal heart rate is between 80-84 beats per minute. When taking this med it got up to 120. Needless to say I did not sleep that night. The next day was a living hell with the nausea and exhaustion. And then came the shakes. I have not taken it in over 36 hours and I still have minor shakes. Hopefully that will stop soon.DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG EVER!!!,F,33,1  days20mg,12/8/2015,Paxil

11, 1, Depression/Anxiety,Paxil (20 mg.) - This drug caused cervical dystonia_ muscle weakness_ tremors_ fatigue_ excessive sleep_ indigestion_ some anxiety.  Manufacturer was Apotex.  Started taking this in 2007 for weight loss due to severe acid reflux and anxiety.  Had to go on Klonopin and receive Botox A shots due to the cervical dystonia that Paxil produced.  I tried both the generic and brand name of this drug and it caused the same problems.,I eventually had to wean myself off of Paxil due to all of the side effects mentioned.  I wish I had never taken it.  I should have received counseling instead of taking this drug.  I personally DO NOT recommend it.,M,53,7.5  years20 MG 1X D,11/5/2015,Paxil

Like feelings in my arm and leg musicales_ paranoia_ constant panic_ anxiety_ physical and emotional numbness_ kind maddening ear ringing_ burning sensation on my tongue - elevated liver enzymes- 40pounds of weight gain- lack of ability to orgasm- lack of restful deep sleep - I only give it a 3 because when I first took it_ it did wonders for my anxiety -,I wish I would have never started this medication- I am currently reducing my dose - but the side effects of the medication and withdrawal are more horrid than my initial anxiety - I had to quit my job when all of this started - ridiculous,F,42,9  years20mg,9/7/2015Email,Paxil

Lex gave me some really good initiative and drive_ but Pax has increased it along with adding assertiveness (in a good way!)","Started on Lexapro 10mg 9 months ago and then Dr. increased to 20mg 3 months ago to help with continuing panic symptoms.  I started having hypnic twitches and was absolutely unable to orgasm although it gave me LOTS of libido back.  In retrospect_ I must have had a bit of depression as well so the Lex helped that and made me a regular horny dude again.  :-)  On Paxil now 3 weeks and was tired for the first couple of weeks_ but now I feel better than I have in recent memory.  Jaw clenching is going away and I am able to orgasm (woot-WOOT!!!)  With that an my recent vasectomy_ Wifey and I are having some MAJOR fun I can tell you - I feel like a newlywed again.  I did ask my Dr. about coming off the Pax in the future if it helped me.  He said that he used to be worried about long-term use_ but now with the years of first-hand observation he came to the conclusion that if it is giving you a happy ""normal"" life then why stop at all.  The way I feel now_ I tend to agree.  I'm interested to hear other men's experiences of switching from Lex to Pax.  Please drop me a line!  PS - I would like to say that I am appalled with all the news-making tragedies that have happened (SC shooter_ German Wings pilot_ CT shooter_ Columbine_ etc.) for young men taking SSRI's.  If you are in your 20s or younger_ I am BEGGING you to man-up and question your doctor as to why they are prescribing you SSRI's with all of the research that shows it to be potentially DEADLY for young men.

19, 5, Depression & Anxiety,Always Sleepy,After taking this drug for four years_ I feel like giving my personal input to this wonderful website which gave me a lot of useful information. I would say I am extremely grateful to paxil. Before 2011_ I was functioning OK but was at the same time manifesting some symptoms which looking back were actually the symptoms of depression. In April 2011_ I had a major bout of depression and was almost unable to sit through my daily job and live a normal life. I was sleepy_ tired_ sore all over my body and have bowel problems_ fever-like symptoms. I almost thought I was dying. After a whole series of medical check_ it was eventually clear to me that I had depression. My doctor prescribed Paxil 10mg for daily intake. I felt much better after staying on the drug for about one month but at the same time suffered from a host of side effects such as low sex drive_ sleepiness_ emotional detachment. The low sex drive went away after some time but sleepiness never disappeared. But overall_ on paxil I was eating healthy_ exercising everyday and had a positive outlook for life. During the process_ I switched to Zoloft once for about 2 months_ only to find that Zoloft had almost the same effect but put a whole lot of weight on me (which is all fat). With 10mg paxil and exercise_ I was always in good shape. This made me determined to turn back to 10mg paxil again. For those with depression_ paxil is something that may help you find a way out.,M,29,4  years10mg 1X D,8/31/2015EmailHistory,Paxil

23, 5, Anxiety / Depression,I have taken 10 mg for 10 years with no side effects.

26, 5, Depression & Anxiety,Dizziness_ Sleepiness,As with any drug_ you have to decide if the benefit outweighs the side effects. Paxil is the ONLY drug that helped me with my EXTREME agitation. It was a feeling like I had super PMS or something. Currently_ I take Paxil and Wellbutrin both. The Wellbutrin takes some of that sleepy feeling away. Then I got diagnosed with Narcolepsy and take Provigil and Adderall. That definitely takes the sleepy away. My only complaints would be: 1. It has a very short half life_ therefore_ if I miss a dose_ I feel psycho pretty fast. 2. There should be a big fat warning about the withdrawal symptoms if you try to stop. They are horrible. Regardless of the sedated feeling I get from it_ I wouldn't trade it for anything!,F,44,20  years40 mg 1X D,7/4/2015,Paxil

36, 5, Depression_ anxiety_ PTSD,Initially_ and with each increase I had nausea and itchy for about two weeks. Sweating_ even the bottom of my feet. Bizarre dreams. I have lost 25 pounds since starting this medication. Started 10mg one month later moved to 20mg. 3 months later moved to 30mg and after a very bad episode of depression I've arrived at 40mg taken every morning. I cannot explain how good it is to be able to sleep at night_ make simple decisions again like what to make for dinner or which brand of  mustard to buy_ or to pay my bills on time! I have missed a dose without any side effects. I was going to tell my doctor that I wanted to start decreasing my dose because I felt so much better now_ when I realized that the Paxil is why I was feeling better.,First let me say I know Paxil saved my life. I HATE medicine of any kind_ very much into clean eating and natural remedies. 5 years ago I started this dark downward spiral into hell. My doctor tried to get me to start taking something to help. I refused. Last year_ I was to the point that I couldn't even get dressed for work (what should I wear???). I wanted to die and only knowing my kids and grandkids then would think that killing yourself was an acceptable solution_ kept me from committing suicide. She suggested Paxil and I have since thanked her for saving my life.,F,57,9  months40 1X D,3/1/2015,Paxil
37, 5, Panic disorder w/ agoraphobia,Weight gain,Before Paxil I could not leave my house due to agoraphobia brought on by Panic Disorder. After Paxil_ I could go anywhere. I had no side effects but I did gain about 70 pounds on it_ although I was also eating more because I was happy. After 2 years_ I no longer felt I needed to be on it and quit cold turkey. Unlike others_ I suffered no withdrawal and have been off of it for a year. My panic attacks have not returned and I am now stable and functioning. I am thankful for Paxil getting me over that bridge to recovery. It was exactly what I needed and I'm saddened some people want this taken off the market for the withdrawals--I had none and this drug saved me from a life of being cooped up in my house.,M,29,2  years10MG 1X D,12/17/2014Email,Paxil

39, 3, Depression/Anxiety,Hello I am currently taking paxil(the generic brand). It has helped me with my depression anxiety not so much but also as a mood stabilizer I used to cry for everything! Literally I couln't live my life. It has controlled that and I can say Im somewhat happy because I do have happy days but I have gained weight and it is horrible probably around 50 pounds. My whole family keeps telling me to go on a diet but cant seem to go lower than 5 pounds. The sweating is horrible!!! Cant sleep or sleep a lot! If i miss a daily dose ill start crying like my usual self but then i take it and it goes away! Im so tired of this and wish i had a better medication!

I am now on my second time quitting paxil_ and it is a hell ride_ and I'm not driving. I started again over two years ago when my dad passed away_ and it helped for a while_ but left me numb with no motivation. I tapered the 20 to 10 for 10 days.  Man these withdrawal symptoms are terrible.  Brain zaps_ laughing crying_ and just plain confused. I will never take this poison again. I would rather have my panic attacks back then deal with this absurd hell.  Hopefully I will be able to have my sex drive back and not rely on alcohol.

It is very hard to get through them but do it. They will go away once the Paxil kicks in. This is the best medicine for anxiety out there. I am always hungry on it but thin. Just eat well and exercise and you can fight the weight gain other people talk about. My anxiety is gone as well as depression. I was on a very low dosage to start which I thought was strange 1/4 of 10mg up to 20mg week by week but it was smart considering the initial side effects. Do not start out on a high dosage. I was on it 3 years ago at 40mg and had tremmors but it worked well before and I had no withdrawal reducing the dosage slowly.

After the two weeks I had trouble falling asleep but when I did would sleep through the nite and have the hardest time waking up in the morning. Would have to force myself to get up. Then around the second month I just felt run down..no energy no motivation. Tired all the time and would yawn constantly! Also my appetite increased tremendously! All I wanted to do was eat and all I craved was sugary foods..as a result obviously I gained weight..I mean u can only eat and lay around and do nothing for so long before pretty soon ur sitting in front of ur computer (because driving somewhere or mustering the energy to actually make a trip to the mall is not even an option)and ordering a whole new wardrobe that will fit because you certainly can't wear the clothes u had before starting this med. Needless to say_ I called my doc and said enough is enough.I would like to add that I never experienced any of the sexual side effects and did not have any withdrawal symptoms after stopping the med. I did however Switch directly from paxil to zoloft and that may have contributed to the lack of withdrawal. I'm not sure about that. As for my anxiety it did help that but of course nobody is gonna be anxious when all u are doing is eating_ sleeping_ yawning_ and occasionally surfing the web for stretchy pants and the newest recipe for chocolate layered cake with a side of brownies..,,F,41,6  months20,8/22/2014,Paxil

48, 1, Depression,Initially_ I felt great. Then_ there was rapid weight gain_ which I still carry. I did not care about anything_ my kids_ housework_ my job_ myself. Had zapping jolts in my brain_ which doctor dismissed. Frequent suicidal thoughts_ which seems counterproductive for an anti-depressant. Crazy_ disturbing dreams. Fatigue. Constant yawning. Shaky hands. Neglected my kids because I just did not care about anything. Severe mood swings. Cried at the drop of a hat.  These are just the side effects that I recall. I have been off of Paxil for years_ thank God.,Withdrawal was horrible. It was a vicious circle. Evertime I would try to get off my side effects were so horrible I would resume taking_ then try to stop again_ etc. eventually_ I made a conscious decision that I was getting off this horrible drug. Gradually cut my dosage in half. Suffered throughout the withdrawal and got off.

Because I still had some anxiety_ I was increased to 20 mg. QD_  With the 10 mg. I had NO negative side effects_ however with 20mg_ I began to have bizarre_ violent dreams nightly and the inability to have an orgasm. I could live with the dreams but I choose to not live an asexual life.  My psychiatrist would like me to try 10mg one day_ then 20mg the next day_ alternating.  There is a lot of wiggle room in dosage with Paxil_ and therefore may need a bit more time to tweak the correct mg.

78, 4, Social Anxiety Disorder,Initially a very odd type of yawn which occurred when changing activities. Wide wide yawns which tingle and feel somewhat good_ but happened too often. Nauseous for the first 2 days_ but not puke-worthy. Somewhat zombie-like_ dilated pupils. Maybe a bit shaky. Difficulty ejaculating_ even the first night I took 20 mg_ but still possible. I went up to 40 mg at which time could not ejaculate for the life of me_ regardless of how much porn and/or sex was involved. It seems that this side effect is dose-dependent. The drowsiness can be a big issue for some and might stick around_ but it seems that this side effect can go away. I haven't noticed any weight gain yet.***Recommendation for a smoother withdrawal: get a prescription for the liquid formulation. It makes it much much easier to taper off the drug in fine_ tiny increments. Alternatively_ ask your doctor if you can switch to an SSRI with a longer half life (fluoxetine is the one!) and taper coarsely off from that. The long half lif,I will go back down to 20 mg as studies apparently indicate that there is not much benefit beyond 20 mg for social anxiety at least. 20 mg is the reccomended starting dose_ and also the maintenance dose. Very effective SSRI for me_ more so than Lexapro. My hypothesis as to why it is indicated for social anxiety is because it is one of the more sedating SSRI's. Play around with the best time to take it - If you get drowsy from it_ like I do_ try taking it at night. If it keeps you up_ take it in the morning. You may also want to take into account the usual time you are sexually active_ try spacing the dose as far away from that time as possible (at least 12 hrs) i.e._ if you are sexually active at night_ try taking it in the morning so the drug level will be somewhat low in your system by nighttime. You can also try taking Wellbutrin in addition to the paxil.,M,22,1  months20-40 mg 1X D,4/13/2013EmailHistory,Paxil

81, 4, Panic disorder with agoraphobia,Weight gain,My doctor put me on Paxil to help with my diagnosed panic disorder and agoraphobia. The first few days of taking it_ I didn't have any side effects or benefits. A month later_ I was going around town to areas I hadn't been to in years. I re-enrolled in college and am currently attending. It actually increased my sex drive and I had the urge to have sex all the time. That still remains true to this day. However_ from the start of February to now_ which is March 16_ I have put on 18 pounds. I have not been eating any differently than I did the first four months of taking Paxil_ but now the weight just seems to be piling on daily. I was already overweight at 232. Now_ I am 250 and none of my clothes fit me any more. I cannot explain how I could gain 18 pounds in 44 days. I started noticing I felt more bloated than usual around the end of February and checked my (normally consistent) weight and found I had gained 10 pounds. Since then I have consistently checked it and it just keeps piling on to the point that I am now 18 pounds heavier. My belly feels bloated all the time and I have had to buy XXL shirts as opposed to the XL ones I was wearing two months ago. It is embarrassing. I have implemented changes to my diet and am planning on exercising next week_ so hopefully this steady gain stops. If I get any bigger_ I may have to talk to my doctor about other options. I guess at this point I am reluctantly thanking the medication while being pissed with it at the same time.,M,28,5  months10 1X D,3/16/2013Email,Paxil
82, 1, Panic Disorder,Loss of libido_ suicidal thoughts,"I took this over a year ago_ but for some reason it has been weighing on my mind to inform people of my experience with this drug.  I was on 10mg once a day everyday_ along with klonopin about 1mg to help with panic attacks.  I stopped taking klonopin because I could not function on it_ I was drowsy all the time and fell asleep at the dinner table one night from it.  But anyway_ back to the paxil.  It took me at least 30 minutes to reach an orgasm during intercourse and that alone was enough to send me over the edge.  I wanted OFF of this medicine as soon as possible and my quack doctor said ""it's not the best decision for you right now."" so...I stopped taking it myself slowly.  I cut my pills in half and after about a week I was taking 1/4th of a pill.  Paxil literally ruined my moods_ libido_ and I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts.  I have always been an upbeat but anxious person_ and while taking paxil I feel like it made my panic attacks worse.  I was having them a lot more frequently than I was before even starting the medication.

83, 5, Anxiety Attacks,Weight gain & low libido,I found this site and decided to comment on this drug. I used to have panic attacks. (From 2003-2007). I started out taking Xanax (addictive) which only masked the symptoms. Then_ my doctor prescribed Ativan which basically masked the symptoms. Both are addictive. Because panic attacks are caused by a chemical imbalance_ you need a drug that will adjust this. So_ I started on a low dosage of Paxil. The first dose made me feel higher than a kite. I couldn't even hold a fork to eat and I was very dizzy. My panic attacks were worse for the first week_ but I continued to take Ativan at the same time to help. So_ I actually used Paxil to help me get off Ativan. It takes about 3 weeks for this medicine to work. I continued taking them for 4 years. I gained about 20 pounds_ but I felt great and could function normally again. In 2007_ I decided to go off them. However_ it took me from March to July to totally stop them. DON'T stop cold turkey because it's very dangerous. I cut my pill in half for a few weeks and then to a 1/4 and an 1/8. This sounds silly_ but when I started feeling dizzy_ the 1/8 took the edge off. I have had a few anxiety attacks since 2007_ but nothing like I used to have. I know that I won't die from them and have learned breathing techniques to manage this disorder and have taken a less stressful job. I would take Paxil again_ but also some Ativan at the same time for the first week or two until the Paxil worked.,F,40,4  years10 1X D,2/2/2013Email,Paxil

(you get used to it and don't notice it as much)   Higher frequency of passing gas.,Don't skip a medication because of any particular rating.  I have tried prozac ( horrible for me) .  Celexia (Made my mind foggy)  Zoloft (Made me withdrawn) Wellbutrin (made me angry).. What's good for one_ is bad for another.  With the exception of Prozac_ I have tried all the above mentioned SSRI's for over a year_ and i came to the conclusion that Paxil was the best for me.  I switched off from it because of the inability to orgasm.  I had the same problem with all the SSRI's with exception to Zoloft.  It cured the anxiety_ but_ made me withdrawn_ I didn't want to have sex.  Prozac and Wellbutrin made my anxiety worse.  Celexia worked as well as the Paxil for Anxiety but i felt like my IQ dropped by 30. After all that_ i returned to Paxil. The negatives with any SSRI are the transition periods.  It can take me about 2 weeks to adjust_ 30 days for me to see full benefits and a year to notice the subtle changes and differences in my behavior.  Any SSRI_ you need to stick it out atleast 30 days to see if its helping.  I suggest having some Lorazipan or Xanax to help with that difficult time.If/when you decide to discontinue Paxil_   Cut it off 5 mg at a time. Regular (not CR)_ you can cut up the pill.  In 3-6 months you can ween yourself off from it without the HELL it is by just stopping cold.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone.  I had to endure it once because i ran out of pills.

I lost my job and got arrested for bad behavior many times on this med. Getting off of it was hell_ I'm permanently emotionally impaired from it_ and may never be capable of holding a job again. I can experience limited emotions sometimes now but most of the time they are no longer present. I still have difficulty distinguishing whether or not I'm awake or in a dream.

Now that I can no longer take it my original problems are many times worse and can not be treated effective,If you live in a state that allows medical marijuana try it first. I was miserable before this medication now I'm more miserably and have no ability to function normally in society. I live with my parents now_ when they are gone I'll be a vagrant and die on the streets. Paxil did nothing but give me more problems and make me permanently disabled. Don't say you weren't warned.

At high doses (30 mg)-extreme anxiety_ irritability_ sleeplessness_ hallucinations_ suicidal thoughts_ feeling as if I was going crazy.,I took paxil 10mg for a year and a half with no side effects. After experiencing some significant life stressors my dose was increased to 20 mg. I felt normal on that dosage for about 2-3 months. However_ soon my anxiety started worsening again because of work-related issues and I was increased to 30 mg daily. I took this dosage for two weeks. One week after increasing the dosage I sincerely believe this medication caused me to become manic-didn't sleep for days on end_ extreme irritability and anger/hostility_ hallucinations (visual AND auditory)_ feelings of paranoia_ psychotic symptoms-including a couple bouts of hysterical laughter. I believe this drug induced serotonin syndrome. My primary care doc didn't think this drug was causing hallucinations and slapped me on seroquel (an antipsychotic). I ended up taking two and a half weeks of medical leave from work trying to withdraw from this drug. Luckily I got off paxil and will NEVER ever go back on it again. I ended up having to see a psychiatrist to help me get off of this awful drug. I considered checking in to a mental hospital while I was on the 30mg per day dosage.

99, 1, Panic disorder and Major Depression,MAJOR mood swings (would go from being euphoric to in a rage in a matter of minutes); hallucinations; night terrors; blackout periods; suicidal thoughts,I would NEVER take this drug again in a million years.  I was diagnosed with major depression and panic disorder when I was 16 years old and this was the first medication my psychiatrist tried me on.  Within a few days_ my moods changed severely and I became very unstable.  I would yell and scream and start crying for no reason.  There was one time after a period of rage that I blacked out.  I have no memory of anything then.  I also experienced frightening hallucinations and night terrors.  As a result_ I could not sleep which only made things worse.  The last straw was suicidal thoughts.  I was very close to ending things and I told my mom I wanted to die.  She took quick action and called the psychiatrist who immediately took me off the medication.  He said that I had a chemical reaction that mimicked severe bipolar disorder.  He put me on Seroquel for two weeks while the Paxil got out of my system.  I would never recommend this to ANYONE.,F,16,14  days20mg 1X D,8/17/2012,Paxil

I have had all the horrific side effects described by others: Frightening and disturbing nightmares_ debilitating  pain in feet and back (feet pain lasted for a month_ and back pain lasted for six months-got relief from Massage). Now after ten months off Paxil_ I am beginning to cry constantly and am just beginning to feel alive ( for first time in 12 years) even though it's as if I'm waking from a psychological coma. All these emotions are bombarding my Psyche_ and often I'm exhausted from all the emotional ups and downs I've experienced. I had several major suicidal bouts with terrorizing feelings_ but with the help of a lot of prayer and the support of my husband_ I am surviving. Slowly_ I am learning to be ""me""_ living without the destructive Paxil in my system. Unfortunately_ my doctor didn't have a clue. For anyone",,F,,12  years30 1X D,7/15/2012Email,Paxil

106, 5, Depression/Anxiety/Panic Disorder,Why are any of you taking regularPaxil? The drug has been reformulated as Paxil CR (constant release). The new formulation takes away most if not all of the side effects as the problem with regular Paxil was its short half-life (4 hours). Doctors should NOT be prescribing regular Paxil anymore. Paxil CR is an entirely different drug. Only use BRAND NAMES when it comes to AD's as the generics just don't cut it. Paxil CR 12.5 MG knocked out my depression and severe anxiety/PD within days. It's a good drug. If you need to withdraw from any SSRI use Lyrica.

110, 1, Anxiety,Didn't have many major side effects while on the drug_ maybe a little apathetic and lacked motivation. Gained 20~ pounds. Sex drive was okay; took a little longer to 'finish' but that was okay with me. The drug did it's job. I was having debilitating panic attacks and Paxil took care of them. The real issues began when I decided to come off the drug...,I initially weaned rapidly off the drug over the course of a month at the advice of my doctor. I felt ok for about a month or two but then I spiraled into what can only be described as hell on earth. Anxiety was through the roof/far more intense then the initial anxiety that I went on the drug for. When the anxiety subsided it was replaced with a deep_ dark depression that I had never experienced before. I was never depressed before taking Paxil so this was a new feeling and very scary feeling for me. I was completely apathetic and had zero motivation or energy. My sex drive/ability was gone. Concentration and short term memory were shot. Brain fog was thick and heavy; I could barely formulate a sentence and felt like I had ADD. I was bed ridden for several months until I decided to reinstate the drug and do a slow taper once I stabilized. It took about 6 weeks but relief came_ albeit with a few lingering issues_ mainly sexual. This was about 7 months ago_ I am now down to 3.5 mg and will be done with this drug for good sometime in June. Slowly tapering is the only way to get off this drug if you want to avoid major withdrawal symptoms. I would not recommend this_ or any SSRI for that matter_ to anyone.

On the 4th day I checked my self into a mental health hospital_ for my own safety_ and for those around me_ and I wish I had done that sooner. Because when I had blackouts I would destroy things_ and injure myself_ and get in my car and go to the store and buy seemingly random things. After 6 failed attempts at quitting this drug_ there was noway I was backing down this time. 3 months out_ I'm still experiencing more than mild side effects however to a lesser degree. This drug made anxiety and depression worse and gave me a total loss of inhibitions(luckily I could not get an erection). Also withdrawal has been on going for more than 3 months. Even though many of these symptoms showed up days after beginning this medication_ 3 out of 4 Dr.s told me these symptoms are not caused by this medication_ The psychotic part of the withdrawals and black outs went away 8 weeks after I quit taking it. During the first 8 weeks of not taking it at all_ I had dangerous long lasting blackouts_ sometimes I would just wake up and realize days had past_ and have physical injuries I could not explain. Lost my job (very promising career_ I was being groomed for upper management) because of severity of withdrawals_ they lasted too long and I was a wreck if I made it into work.

My marriage is falling apart because I cannot empathise with my wife. My morals are more akin to a narcissist's - as in_ if it aint good for me it aint worth thinking about. My lack of worrying has me not caring about my health_ leading to weight gain and not wanting to quit smoking_ drinking_ or other harmful things. The brain zaps send me off the deep end if I miss a dose. This is a good drug if you need to deal with an issue in the short term_ but I'd advise getting good psychiatric help at the same time_ and trying to get off it as soon as possible.,M,38,15  years20 1X D,2/23/2012,Paxil

I went off Luvox and was fine for a few months_ until the first emotional crisis hit and I fell apart.  I was totally against an SSRI because of the weight gain and sexual side effects but my doctor convinced me to try Paxil again_ after trying a few other drugs with bad results.  I have been on 20mgs daily for three months and I feel great.  I've actually lost weight_ but I also stick to a strict diet.

I DO STILL HAVE DEPRESSION AND PAXIL DOES NOT WORK MUCH FOR THAT. I FEEL LIKE IT'S EFFICACY IS SOLELY SEVERE ANXIETY AND SOCIAL ANXIETY. AFTER 2 MVA'S I AM ONE OF THE MOST ANXIOUS PEOPLE.

150, 5, Fibromyalgia,Weight gain,I began taking Paxil along with Amitriptyline (50mg) to control severe fibromyalgia pain. After coming off of 12 years of opiate prescriptions for pain_ I did not need it any more because the Pax and Amitrip worked to reduce my pain. The biggest side effect is that panic attacks I'd had for years went away completely! People around me ask how I got my life back after being bed-ridden for 10 years. I don't like to tell them too much detail_ but I tell them that God used my new doctor to find a Rx combination that worked for me. If I miss taking it for a day I know it because I start to hurt all-over again. Also_ if I don't take it I get annoyed at people more easily. It doesn't make me numb to feelings_ it just helps me control annoyance.I hate to take something that I know I need so much because I fear not having it. But.... I'd rather be overweight and not always angry than the opposite. Pain and panic attacks are my reasons to stay on Paxil. Fat and happy? Maybe chubby and always having to stay active and watch what I eat - are my trade-offs.,F,64,14  years20 mg 1X D,5/31/2011,Paxil

And talk about withdrawal HELL -- I nearly took my life.  Don't believe all the doctors who try to stick you on antidepressants as the answer_ because in time_ it will likely backfire on you_ and you won't even realize it until your life is in ruins.  These drugs are sneaky like that.  You're talking about your brain here_ people.  Diet and exercise can fix most issues.  And definitely avoid Paxil if you *must* go on a med.  It is one of the harshest antidepressants out there.

160, 1, high cortisol -depression - anxiety,Took it 5 years ago and it destroyed me. Clouded my rational deep-thinking abilities. It put me on AUTO-PILOT and it's like I lost the next 2 years of my life. I don't know where they went. I did things I never would have done before -took more prescription drugs that I NEVER should have been prescribed or taken. Loss of libido. It was supposed to LOWER my cortisol and depression - but it ELEVATED the cortisol. I could sleep - but it somehow masked the high cortisol and subsequently destroyed my life.,If I had known about this site and read it - it would have SAVED MY LIFE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH - DO NOT TAKE ANY SSRI'S - especially this PAXIL POISON. MD's should NOT be allowed to dispense this toxic garbage - it is a crime. Doctors know JACK - about what drugs actually do - they learn their spiel from the Barbie & Ken drug reps who bring their office fancy lunches and nice pens and jokes. I have watched this myself. All I needed was good cognitive therapy but doctors don't push that - they push drugs.  Because they make money from that and get free trips and gifts. NO ONE knows what these drugs actually do to your IMMUNE SYSTEM and the long term damage. Most serotonin is in your GUT. Taking Paxil is one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  It began the snowball rolling downhill_ other illnesses came from it and now I am in decline. NEVER TRUST DOCTORS - DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK FIRST.

I originally checked it for comments about another anti-depressant and the comments were so over-the-top I wanted to see what the consensus was on a drug I was familiar with. I have had no side effect other than those mentioned. The sexual ones are certainly problematic_ but as far as the dreams go they're not bad_ just involved. Paxil has been a great help to me. Zoloft and Wellbuturin made me too wired. I'm aware that this is a med that needs to be tapered when you discontinue_ but there have been a few instances where I ran out of my Rx and went without for 2 or 3 days and it was no big deal for me. Also when I tried a couple of other SSRIs in an effort to mitigate the sexual side effects_ I tapered off paxil and it wasn't an issue.

As I understand it_ it blocks the effects of adrenaline_ which helps to break the negative feedback loop of extreme stress the drugs create. It's not for pregnant women however.

I kept seeing demons all around me and I became very paranoid.  I have no history of paranoia or hallucinations before or after taking Paxil.  I developed suicidal thoughts which scared me to death.  I couldn't take the hallucinations and I wanted to die.  I scared my mom so much that she called the doctor immediately at midnight because of one of my episodes!

196, 1, depression,insomnia_ anxiety_ panic_ weight gain_ increased depression_ increased suicidal ideation_ delayed ejaculation,Paxil ruined my life and I firmly believe it caused permanent neurological damage. I started taking it for depression (a single depressive bout!) when I was 17. If I had known then what I know now I would have shunned it like death. I took twenty milligrams a day for nine years. It caused horrible panic and anxiety. And it only worsened the depression it was supposed to help in the first place. These days if I get depressed_ it feels organic_ like a natural sort of depression. When I got depressed on Paxil_ it was a crazy_ pitch-black_ suicidal depression. But the worst part of Paxil is still happening. After I quit_ the panic and anxiety_ which it caused_ blossomed and rebounded in the meanest way possible. Understand_ I never had panic or anxiety before Paxil. Now_ four years later_ I?m still dealing with the ?mean reds? and I think Paxil permanently re-wired something upstairs. Some days I?m so ?off? and so panicked and anxious that I don?t know who I am_ what I?ve become. I?m a quivering shell of my old self all those many_ many years ago.

It wasn't until I was in college that I noticed that I can't depend on this drug forever. When I was 22_ I decided to quit cold turkey because my psychiatrist closed his practice and I hated that I depended on this drug. Not wanting to find another docter_ I stopped using. The withdrawal didnt last too long and I immediatly started losing weight. I now realize that this drug probably did more harm than good. I don't recommend this drug at all.

What your doctor does not mention is that wellbutrin and paxil both have similar side effects when beginning and ending the drug_ respectively.  As a result I have had a short temper over the last few weeks to the point where I have classified it as rage.

I have also had days of crying and sobbing.  This has lessened a bit in the past two weeks; I have no illusions that I am not in for more severe reactions.  After stopping this horrible_ horrible poison_ I had terrible brain zaps and panic that I had never dreamed possible.  I demanded my psychiatrist help me continue my efforts to get this poison out of my system.  He prescribed Prozac which I took instead of Paxil for about two months_ tapering down from 40mgs per day to zero.  When I had attempted to stop ingesting this legal poison several times during the last 13 years and experienced the intense brain zaps_ crying_ panic_ overwhelming anxiety which I now know are withdrawal symptoms_ my psychiatrist dismissed my symptoms as my ""illness"" returning.  He said I should be on Paxil for the rest of my life and to see it the same way as a diabetic needing insulin. Perhaps I was so scared and my brain was so fogged I did not ask a logical question.  If my panic attacks_ depression and obsessive thoughts for which the medicine was prescribed are to be compared to diabetes_ which is determined by measuring blood sugar_ why were my seratonin levels never tested?

I developed an eating disorder and got down to 65 pounds. I began taking Paxil again a couple of months ago. My anxiety which was utterly debilitating is nearly gone_ the OCD is much_ much better_ and I now weigh 115 pounds and feel stronger than in a long_ long time.

Paxil did change my life_ in the begining and each time I got back on it. But all in all_ I hate the emotionless feeling when on it.

I made another attempt to get off paxil when I was 24_ suffered severe withdrawal and subsequently went to my dr. to see about starting a low dose of a different SSRI that works in a methadone-like manner to help patients get off paxil. She insisted that my withdrawal symptoms were an indication that I needed paxil_ and that they weren't withdrawal symptoms at all_ but simply my behaviour without paxil (even though I certainly never hallucinated before treatment).

Or worry about anything for that matter.  I am currently earning a PhD_ which is an incredibly stressful endeavor - but the Paxil helps me manage the stress.

In retrospect I see that Paxil increased the severity of my depressive episodes and directly contributed to sleeplessness_ sexual dysfunction and poor decision-making. Regarding panic attacks and anxiety_ it is impossible to know the truth. The fact_ however_ is that before Paxil_ I did not suffer from panic attacks or severe anxiety. Sometime during my third year on the drug_ I had my first major panic attack (white-faced_ shaky_ sweaty_ watery eyes; closer_ perhaps_ to a nervous breakdown). Since then anxiety has become the more overwhelming half of my illness_ though often the anxiety and depression intermingle so well that it's hard to tell what is what. I quit taking Paxil three years ago. The weening and withdrawal took three months; it was a long_ terrible ordeal. But I have not once regretted the decision to stop Paxil. I do not currently take an SSRI. I use Klonopin (a benzo) sporadically_ for social occassions_ and ten days ago decided to risk taking another daily drug_ Buspar_ which is for anxiety_ in a class by itself.

I have read of people being unable to get off of this drug. But this begs the question ""Why would you want to?"" I think the bottom line with a lot of the SSRI drugs is that they don't work the same way for everyone. Some users probably have serious emotional issues that are experiential rather than organic/chemical/somatic in cause. And lets not forget that you're monkeying around with your thinker when you take these kinds of drugs. I think of Paxil as being rather like Gum-Out for your brain. It can smooth out your emotions and your emotional responses to everyday external stimuli. However_ if you've got something REALLY broken in your belfry_ Paxil may not do you much good. Paxil will absolutely not make your problems go away.

I went through many medical test because I didn't know that PAXIL withdrawal was why I was so sick.  It was like having a never ending terrible flu.  Finally_ I got back on it because of even worse depression and that's when I realized that it was Paxil withdrawal that was making me so ill.  I gained even more weight_ 25 lbs. very rapidly.

I was afraid to sleep with my back to the closet because the door was open!  Took a large butcher knife into the back yard to walk my dog before bed because I thought someone might be ""out there.""  Really freaky stuff_ so much so that my husband wanted to take my to the hospital.  I just went back on the stuff for another 6 months_ taking the wean slower and with the support of adrenal pills (homeopathic).  Finally off - YAY.

YOU NAME IT_ I GOT IT AS A SIDE EFFECT.,After suffering with anxiety for all of my 26 years_ I finally got some insurance and saw a doctor. The psychopharmacologist tried me on buspar and klonopin in Nov 2008_ but the buspar made me feel like i was drinking liquor and smoking pot all day_ so in Jan 2009 she replaced it with Paxil. It was February or so when I noticed that my blind rages_ mood swings and intrusive thoughts had significantly declined_ and my panic attacks were completely gone. Unfortunately_ so was my libido. I also started noticing around this time that I was getting a racing heart and weakness around the same time every night_ which the doc attributed to withdrawal (even though I was taking my 20mg dose every morning like clockwork) and prescribed me to take another 10mg at night. Guess what? Not only did the side effects continue and in fact worsen_ but the benefits I had briefly experienced from the medication vanished. In April I decided enough was enough_ as the lack of sex was ruining my relationship with my depressed partner_ and all the Paxil was doing was making me physically ill while all the while my anxiety and rage was as it ever was prior to medication. Unfortunately_ my doc had neglected to tell me about how dangerous the drug was before putting me on it_ and also neglected to instruct me correctly on how to taper off. I told her I had 7 doses left_ and she said to take one a day until I was out. Guess what happened a week later? The worst damn case of discontinuation syndrome the doc,F,27,5  months,6/15/2009,Paxil

Been taking it for about 5 years and expect to take it-- or another antidepressant-- pretty much forever. Decided to very gradually wean off at one point and my symptoms returned.

So_ since I personally was desperate to find out what to expect_ ""should I continue this""_ ""when is this going to help""_ and any other number of questions and anxieties about this treatment_ I thought I would report back.  I'll give it to you totally straight - the first 2.5 weeks_ I truly_ truly felt like I was going to die.

Caused severe diarrhea_ sudden weight loss of 22 lbs over 6 weeks from 114 lbs to 92 lbs.  Extreme fatigue_ flu like sytptoms and nausea. Had sores in my mouth for months and skin turned an ashed hue.  I was undiagnosed for 7 months until I went to the Mayo Clinic.  By this time I could not walk_ had severe head and limb tremors and could not hold silverware to feed myself.  The parkinson like symptoms were caused by a rare side effect of Paxil blocking out dopamine needed for a functioning body. This is called seratonin toxicity and is sometimes called seratonin syndrome.,My Doctor said if his theory were true_ these symptoms would abate within 1-2 days since Paxil has a short half life.  I reluctantly quit Paxil cold turkey and within 2 days was walking_ my normal skin coloring returned and the tremors have abated for the most part.I am now dealing with paxil withdrawls but it is getting better every day.I was put on Ativan to help with the withdrawls from paxil and 5 weeks later I am doing much better.Paxil worked wonderfully for years but it is not meant to be a lifetime drug.

287, 1, Depression_ anxiety,AWFUL_ HORRIBLE withdrawals_ I tried several times in the first five years to get off Paxil.  I took 40 mg a day and tried tapering down 10 mg a week_ then 10 mg less every two weeks_ and once even tried liquid Paxil_ tapering 5 mg every two weeks.  Never could get off of it_ had shock-like zaps in my head_ severe nausea_ drop in blood pressure_ extreme dizziness not only when trying to taper off but also if I forgot one dose or towards the end if I didn't take it at the same time every day.  Tried tapering with Prozac_ then got pregnant and couldn't handle the withdrawal effects along with pregnancy.  Withdrawal was so bad my OB wouldn't let me get off of it when I was pregnant even though it's now not recommended that you take Paxil when pregnant.  If I had known how physically addictive a drug it was_ I never would have started.,I was able to wean myself off Paxil after being diagnosed with Adult Attention Deficit Disorder and was put on Adderall.  This changed my life_ I slowly weaned off the Paxil by cutting the pills with a pill cutter_ taking 5 mg less every 2-3 weeks.  I truly believe I was misdiagnosed in the beginning_ that my doctor just wanted to throw pills at me to 'cure' my symptoms and not use therapy or actually get to the heart of what was wrong.  Be VERY careful when taking this drug_ start with a small dose and give yourself PLENTY of time to get used to it before upping your dose_ it can take up to 3 months to really tell a difference in how you feel (at least that's what I have heard).  Today I'm a different person than when I was on Paxil_ I actually have emotions and ups and downs instead of being emotionless all the time.

However_ when NOT on Paxil_ I have rage issues_ anxiety_ argumentative_ and am currently trying to juggle a number of already-stressful issues.

I cannot take GENERIC paxil.  I was on it for about six months and had several seizures. The only problem I ever had was when this med went GENERIC and I was put on the ""make-believe"" paxil.  I had several seizures while on the GENERIC.  I'd wake up in the middle of the night_ very confused and scared and also noticed that I had ""wet"" myself.  When I lost control of my bladder during the day_ I mentioned it to my doctor & he sent me for a brain scan.  Sure enough_ there was signs of previous seizure activity.

318, 1, for anxiety and nervousness,The Paxil had little effect_ but when I stopped taking it I had an almost totally irresistable impulse to suicide_ which I had to fight for a week.

There really is no antidepressant that will not make your libido decrease or not increase your weight. The best thing to do is talk with your Dr and try different drugs.

I don't experience the negative thoughts and feelings that were making life unbearable as often and after about three weeks I adjusted to all the side effects. I was really worried about not being able to finish during sex and considered stopping taking it out of frustration but with a lot of persistence and an understanding girlfriend I was able to overcome (no pun intended)it. So my advice is not give up on it right away. With persistence and optimism you may be able to get over the annoying side effects.,M,29,30  days,1/11/2009Email,Paxil

When I first take it there's like this strange electric shock to the brain which is super scarry and I don't like it. I do have more energy and haven't thought about suicide as frequent. I still do from time to time and it seems to be even worse then before!!! It's kind of like I'm just floating through life and not really experiencing it.

I'd rather have random twitches and sensetivity to light and sound than a terrible bout of depression.

I still have occasional brain zaps which I NEVER exeprienced prior to Paxil. I am giving this drug a 4_ despite the weight gain and horrific withdrawal because it is so effective.

After reading the comments here_ it seems to me that only people with panic and anxiety disorder should take Paxil.  For all of us_ it gave us our life back.  Unless you have suffered from debilitating panic and anxiety_ you cannot understand how much help this drug has given people who need it.

I feel like I'm trapped in my head on this medication and sometimes it seems to make depression worse_ especially at the beginning of therapy.  It's worth it if you are being tortured by OCD but for me it's been ineffective as an antidepressant.  And the suicidal ideation stuff is real.  I've taken it for years and withdrawal sucks for a few weeks but as long as you taper slowly and realize the discomfort is temporary it's not too bad.

375, 2, severe anxiety and depression,It helped with the depression.  However_ I felt like I was watching my life and not experiencing any of it.  It was like I was watching a movie (only way I know how to describe it.)  I have known many other people who have taken this drug and become extremely conceited and only cared about themselves.  Also tended to act recklessly without regard for others feelings.,Only good thing I can say is that it seemed to increase self-esteem.  I woke up and looked in the mirror and thought I looked better for some reason.  However_ it wasn't worth the extent that I felt out of touch with life.,F,28,3  months,4/26/2008,Paxil
376, 4, Anxiety_ Panic Attacks,Difficulty falling/staying asleep_ constipation_ difficulty achieving orgasm,"I was first prescibed Paxil when my anxiety started as a teen_ and it was fairly a new drug back then. So they didn't really know about all the withdrawal effects it has. I stayed on it for about nine years_ in that nine years it was a life saver to me_ because before I couldn't function ""normally"" with my anxiety. I decided that I wanted to try and wean off of it_ thought maybe it wasn't needed anymore. I slowly started weaning off_ my doctor did it very slowly_ like only going down 10mg. in a year's time at first_ and then another 10mg. in 6 months time. I did experience a lot of crying_ and dizziness_ and eventually my anxiety started to come back. By this time I was only taking 10mg. So my doctor and I agreed to try different meds. In about a years time I was given Lexapro (helped_ but made me feel ""numb"" so stopped) Effexor_ (didn't help me at all_ I think actually made things worse_ so stopped) and Zoloft (lost a lot of weight_ trouble sleeping_ helped for awh",F,27,10  years,4/20/2008Email,Paxil

378, 2, depression,No side effects while taking drug.,I took only 10 mg a day and decided after several years of feeling fine to stop it.  The withdrawal was awful.  The first time I tried to stop I couldn't because I was in so much discomfort.  I succeeded with the second attempt because I was determined to get off it.  At first I felt several days of euphoria_ then a dizziness set in that lasted a month.  I also had a sharp spike of pain in my head once or twice.  I would never take Paxil again.  I gave it a 2 because while it did help with the depression_ the withdrawal problems outweighed any benefit.,F,46,5  years,4/14/2008,Paxil

However_ now that I would like to try coming off of it_ I notice that I cry ""at the drop of a hat""! I have tried in the past to quit_ slowly reducing the dosage every 2 weeks_ and I would start the crying jag so I'd go back on. Well_ this time I thought I would drag it out even more slowly and maybe the crying wouldn't happen but no such luck.",,F,44,8  years,4/7/2008,Paxil

383, 5, SEVERE anxiety_ Fibromyalgia_ panic,I have only experienced several side effects on Paxil and most of them go away after the first 2 months. Dry mouth_ ringing in ears_ sweaty palms_ increased anxiety difficulty having an orgasm_ consipation_ occasional sleepiness and weight gain. For me the weight gain is permanent so I try and watch what  eat and excercise. The sweaty palms_ increased anxiety_ ringing in ears and sleepiness went away after about a month. Since Paxil can be constipating I drink a couple cups of coffee everyday and have no problem going to the bathroom. There can be difficulty orgasming (for women anyway) but it is possible_ just takes longer. The dry mouth is not too bothersome because I drink lots of water anyway. Please note that my anxiety (off paxil) is so EXTREME that I cannot function so any side effects I may had or have are nothing in comparison to the hell I was living daily.,I have tried everything from Risperdal and Anafranil to Seroquel (anti psychotic) to Wellbutrin and Lexapro. I have been given about 25 different drugs including every Benzodiazepine that there is. Nothing worked and/or the side effects were much worse than Paxil. I would like to STRESS to people that Paxil is not for someone who has occasional baby blues or a little stress and worry or even slight anxiety. In my opinion Paxil is for hardcore anxiety that is debilitating to your life in some way. Even my doctors have said that Paxil is the strongest med out there for anxiety. Paxil is also bettter for predominant anxiety than predominant depression so if you are mostly depressed with a little anxiety you should try something else. I have/had depression as well but it's mostly due to the level of anxiety I had. I also have post traumatic stress disorder and fibromyalgia due to a car wreck i was in. Here's a little story i would like to share with all of you: last year after I was on pax,F,28,10  years,4/4/2008Email,Paxil
384, 4, PPD and Situational Dep,No side effects when starting or taking the drug. Helped the Post Partum Dep almost immediately and worked well for longterm treating situational dep (military wife!).,on the BAD side: DO NOT START TAKING THIS DRUG UNLESS IT IS THE LAST RESORT!! SIDE EFFECTS WILL OCCUR WHEN TRYING TO QUIT!! I say this as I took it for over 10 years becuz I could not get off of it. The withdrawal is HORRIBLE. Takes but a day to help_ but over a year to taper off. To wean I started w/ 30_ then 20_ then 10_ then split the halves in half_ then halved again_ to the point of crumbs. Then switched to the liquid taking a tiny drop at a time. Each step was about 6wks. Doesn't sound like such a big deal_ but if you forget even a day_ then the side effects like nausea_ extreme vertigo_ photophobia_ paranoia_ etc._ are AWFUL!

385, 2, social anxiety/depression,big increase in appetite_ too stoned_ couldnt drive safely_ teeth grinding_ too sleepy during the day,This drug did cure my social anxiety because I couldn't feel anything_ just completly stoned. I'm also scared of the withdrawal i've been hearing about. Could barely drive and was very unsafe on the road. Although if all the other side affects didnt come with it I'd stay on it a while. It also made me gaine 5 lbs in 2 weeks_ just hungry all the time for sugar and carbs i dont usually care for sweets. Head was sore from teeth grinding too_ took a week for that to go away after ceasing the meds.,F,33,2  weeks,3/29/2008Email,Paxil
386, 5, social anxiety,Almost impossible to have orgasm.  Sleepiness that abated after about two months.,I found myself able to talk to people_ to walk into the staff lounge without the fear that people were laughing at me_ etc.  All the antidepressents worked_ and when I'd stop taking them for weeks at a time (you get to miss orgasms) I felt no side effects EXCEPT WITH EFFEXOR.,F,49,1  years,3/25/2008,Paxil

388, 2, social anxiety_ ocd_ panic disorder,The main side effect for me was that I was unable to laugh_ and laughing is one of the main non-prescription drug ways to handle my problems,All of the SSRI's obviously work very differently for different people; I think anyone with major problems who tries taking an SSRI and it does not work well for them should strongly consider trying another. This can be difficult because getting used to a new drug is a pain_ but if you can find one that works well it will be worth it. I am still in the process.,F,24,6  months,3/16/2008,Paxil

I can't get pass the withdrawal horror stories_ it scares me too much to continue this drug... also i dont want to perma damage my brain. It did help with my anxiety... relaxed me and made me more comfortable around people even after only 3 days of use but it's only because it made me a zombie that doesnt care about anything. i didnt take my pill today and i'm slowly returning to normal and i'm going to try st johns wort_ fish oil_ flaxseed oil_ kava and valerian and meditation (becoming aware of the present and being objective of my thoughts).

(20 mg) I no longer have to wonder where or when the next wave of panic will hit me. I have only had a very few brief_ mild episodes since taking- they seem to be related to my cycle.  I had stopped going places and doing things in case I would panic- even simple things like going into a store could do it.  I have my life back.

On day 1 I felt like I was wired and couldn't sit still. Felt like a caffeine rush. That night I couldn't sleep but the next day I felt like I had slept all night. Then the teeth chattering set in. My teeth chattered like I was cold for over 2 hours and I had an uncontrollable tremor in my right arm. I walked into the doctors office and even they were in a panic just from looking at me. They had never seen anything like that and thought I might have a neurological problem but nope it was all a side effect of good old Paxil. I had to quit taking it after just those 2 days. Even the next day I had headaches and cloudy thinking. I would never take this again even if my life depended on it.,F,23,2  days,2/11/2008,Paxil
401, 1, anxiety/depression,Paxil gave me a permanent neurological disorder,This drug pretty much ruined my life.  It casued me to have dystonia_ a permanent neurological disorder characterized by involuntary muscle spasms.  The spasms are limited to my jaw muscles -- at their worst_ I can not open my mouth at all to speak or eat.  The best treatment for dystonia of the jaw is Botox injections into the muscles -- $3000 a visit_ 4 visits required a year -- for the rest of my life.  Dystonia is a KNOWN side effect of Paxil_ yet doctors still hand the stuff out for anything and everything.  Both the manufacturer and the FDA should be ashamed to let this crap stay on the market...but the manufacturer is all about the money and the FDA has no testicles.

My hormonally-related depression has all but vanished_ and I feel ""even"" and content now_ where before Paxil I never knew when the next wave of blackness would envelop me. I went off of Paxil with no trouble whatsoever when I got pregnant_ and I suspect the hormones of pregnancy kept me on an even-keel during that time. I tried to stay off of Paxil after my baby was born to breast-feed_ but the post-partum depression was so horrible I restarted Paxil with very minimal side-effects 4 weeks after giving birth.",F,40,6  years,1/26/2008,Paxil

I have SEVERE anxiety_ not just occasional anxiety or stress and I believe thats what this med is for. I would say it's better for anxiety than depression as well although it helps a little for that. I also have Fibromyalgia and IBS and it definitely helps in those areas. I did try going off paxil (my family persuaded me I didn't need it anymore) and that turned out to be a huge mistake. In the 2 months I was off of it ( you must wean off slowly)my life was hell. I was very anxious and convinced that i was going to die. I was at the ER 7 times after I went off the med. I did have other things going on in my life as well as an antibiotic called Levaquin I took which turned out to be a near fatal mistake.

405, 4, depression,weight gain and physical exhaustion,I started taking Paxil during a major depressive episode.  Eventually I began to feel better and I got my life back - it really saved me.  It made me feel better than I had for most of my life so I kept taking it for many years at 20mg.  For the last few years I cut back to 10mg.  During these many years I put on significant weight - about 60 pounds.  Also_ I was always exhausted.  I would wake up exhausted.  I could take a nap anytime during the day.  It got to the point_ my doctor thought perhaps I had sleep apnea.  Around this time_ I decided to go off Paxil completely.  Amazingly_ I found that the exhaustion was gone.  I had energy for the first time in many_ many years.  I was amazed_ and slightly disheartened to realize the Paxil had been causing my extreme tiredness all these years.  Unfortunately_ I went off the Paxil at a point in my life when mood swings from menopause had begun.  I went back on a low dose of - Wellbutrin.

Paxil is an antidepressant_ which works to reduce the absorption of serotonin (body's natural antidepressant)_ so it remains within easy reach of the serotonin receptors in the brain_ so that when needed_ it is readily available to handle stress. When you go off of it (especially after being on it for a time) your body is not used to the lower serotonin levels that the Paxil works to keep elevated. You no longer have an adequate supply of this ""natural antidepressant_"" so when your body needs it to handle stressful situations (many times including normal day-to-day activities)_ it is not there and you ""crash.""",M,18,6  weeks,1/23/2008,Paxil

The main reason I am switching is because I am so young and I have been on this drug ever since I've been of sexual age_ yet I have never had a good sex life and on this drug_ you become anorgasmic_ which I definitely have been. If I do orgasm it takes up to an hour and cannot be done with a human_ but a vibrator. And besides that_ it makes you feel like you could live without sex for the rest of your life. This is hard when you have a steady boyfriend who wants to do it at least 1x a week or more_ but you would rather just go to bed. It made me actually dread having sex_ while everyone else I know can't get enough of it. LOL. So_ I don't recommend this for young women like me. Also_ DO NOT just go off this pill on your own.

I completly withdrew myself from the outside world. I wouldnt even talk on the phone. I would lash out at the people I love_ and not even realise what I was doing until after the fact. This hasnt always been the case. But with in the last 2 years my bipolar had gotten increasingly worse. Paxil gave me back the life that I love. It lets me be the mother that I know I am. Which is a caring_ patient_and involved mother. And it has brought peace to my marriage.My husband actually wants to be around me now. I now look forward to going places. And I am slowly starting to hang out with friends again. I know about the withdrawls because I had them with Effexor_ which was awfull... but hopefully Paxil will just continue to work for me_ And I will continue to take it for the rest of my life.

That was when I realized that i needed to stop taking Paxil.,It really helped the bulimia.  No more binging and purging_ and no more obsessing about food_ all day long - everyday.  I actaully lost about 5 lbs while on paxil.  Also_ unlike most people_ i did not have a hard time getting off of the drug.  I guess that all SSRI's affect eveybody in a different way.  You can not always rely on what you hear from other people_ because most likely you will react differently. You can just get a general idea of what to expect.

I went from being a suicidal_ timid person_ to being more socially outgoing and suffering a lot less from anxiety. I can drive confidently_ attend major functions without dreading them for days. And I feel pretty content with life. The key to this drug is that you have to give it time to work and adjust to the right dose. Being on it for a couple of months is useless. I am now trying to get off of it due to the fact that it's unsafe during pregnancy_ and the withdrawal is horrible. I'm doing it with doctor supervision at the rate of 10mg a week (I was on 210mg a week)but it's still bad. The dizziness and electric shocks and fatigue are awful. I'm only on week 3 of withdrawal and I'm having a rough time.

Before the medication_ anxiety and panic gave me great difficulty driving_ making it through a day of work_ or spending time doing anything outside my apartment.  Sometimes I thought I was going crazy or having a full-blown nervous breakdown.  This worsened my depression_ and I felt horrible and was losing the will to live.  Little by little_ most of these problems faded away with time and the medication.  I no longer have thoughts of insanity or suicide.  As each day passes_ that stuff is beginning to seem like a distant memory.  So far_ Paxil has made life so much more manageable.  I hope this continues.

Talked to my doctor and he cut my dosage. Had some side effects_ but lived (and worked) through them.  Now on 10mg and find that controls the anxiety and depression (generally) and leaves me feeling like me still.  Those who feel like they are smothered_ tired etc. may be on too high a dose?

I've never experienced intense withdrawal symptoms_ though become moody after being off the medication for 10-14 days.  Initially_ it helped with social anxiety_ but its effect started to wear off over time (5-6 years).  Sexual problems tend to improve over time_ but can torment you initially. When I first started taking Paxil_ I was unable to achieve orgasm for 23 days.  I finally had to stop taking it for 2-3 days to correct the problem.Paxil is great for fixing your problem_ but comes with a lot of baggage.  I love it and hate it all at the same time.

Side-effects are HORRIBLE.  My emotions are EXTREME_ crying for no reason at all day long_ freaking out over the slightest thing_ feeling like crawling in a hole and never coming out_ wanting to sleep all day.  It is affecting my job_ my family_ my everything.  I feel hopeless.  I wish I would have never went on it_ because coming off of it is not worth the relief I received when I was on it.  This stuff is wicked.  I hope I can get through it without losing my mind because that is what I feel like is happening to me.

Withdrawal was hard - I cut back by 5 mg every other day for 6 week intervals - but after I got through it I was fine. If you know that the withdrawal symptoms will end after 6 weeks for each dose reduction_ you can get through it. It's not addictive in the sense that once you get through withdrawal you don't crave the drug.,I had severe insomnia for about 18 mos - sometimes I wouldn't sleep for a week at a time.  I had tried all kinds of sleeping pills_ including benzodiapines_ and nothing worked.  I was at my wit's end and becoming seriously depressed and suicidal.  Finally my doctor put me on Paxil and exactly 6 weeks after starting it_ I slept like a baby every night. I slept alot at 20 mg and sometimes even had to take naps but I didn't mind because I had been so sleep deprived.  Cutting back to 10 mg helped even things out a bit.  I eventually decided to go off Paxil due to side effects.  I still have trouble sleeping_ but not as bad as before.  I'm glad to know that this medication is there in case I ever have another episode of insomnia like I did before.  It was worth the side effects to get my life back.

If I counted my calories at about 1200 a day_ I would lose between 1 to 2 pounds a week. I have to change though so I'm currently weening off and I'm at 5mg and my blood sugar is MUCH lower.

489, 4, Depression_ general anxiety,"What stands out the most is the vivid dreams in the initial weeks. I had very vivid dreams.  I have missed my medication twice before for a period of 2-3 days (accidentally).  One of the first indicators to it has been the return of the dreams after the second night.  I have definitely noticed a decrease in my libido but this has been a good thing in my case.  It was somewhat unmanageable when I was suffering from depression (I guess it was my brain's way of trying to get a dopamine fix).  Now I do feel as though I can focus on things more appropriately.  My libido is not entirely gone like some patients.  I assume this is because I had such a strong one for a girl before the medication.  I have noticed since I began taking the medication that I experience ""brain fog"" a lot whereas I did not before.  I was very clear headed.  I am also somewhat absentminded.  However_ a lot has changed in my life during the time since I began the medication so this may be contributing as well",Overall_ I am glad I take it.  For me_ the side effects exist but they are not bad enough to warrant a switch.  I can understand how the libido aspect_ especially_ would make some people wary.  I do worry about a time when I might have to stop taking it because I have a feeling that the withdrawal is going to be especially bad for me -- judging from the times I accidentally stopped before.  I recommend that anyone who is considering starting this med research the withdrawal symptoms on their own first.  I don't believe doctors give much credit to the reports but you can find a lot of testimonials on the internet.,F,23,1  years,2/27/2007,Paxil

I have had 10 lbs weight gain (which is hard to neccessarily blame on the medication).,My initial symptoms were anxiety attacks in certain situations. My anxiety attacks consisted of a racing heart_an upset GI tract_ and a feeling of needing to escape the situation/environment I was in. I found myself avoiding situations where I was afraid I might have a panic attack. It got worse and worse_ and I was felt I was losing control of my life.When I finally went in to the physician_ I started with counseling/therapy (which unfortunately wasn't helpful); and then started paxil.

In the first 6 months_ I would have probably rated it a 4 or 5 since it really did help me...but at the time_ nothing was yet known about it's long-term effects so my doctor thought it ""wouldn't hurt"" for me to stay on it indefinitely.  Surprisingly_ the withdrawal wasn't half as bad as I was expecting but my determination and desire to get off this drug was so strong_ I really believe that's what got me through it.

The withdrawl symptoms are always so horrible I have to begin taking it again.  I can't go any longer than 3 days without taking it_ or they start.  It's helped me over the years_ to an extent.

Zombie like mornings especially_ missing a pill = nasty side effects_ brain-zaps galore_ and feels like my brain can't keep up with my eyes when I move my head quickly. Also hard to focus on tasks at work.,life is better with_ than without. Don't take withdrawal lightly_ my shrink did_ and I ended up in ER. Probably will be on for rest of my life. I take Clonazepam too for panic attacks_ which only started during withdrawal and never went away after I went back on paxil. Tried a couple of other SSRI's but nothing worked for very long. Tough decision to go back on Paxil_ as I knew that if I went back on_ I knew I would probably never come off. Withdrawal took 6 months_ and now I need more Paxil (30 mg) to get the same affect as before. What can I say_ anxiety/depression is a bitch_ and I am never really free of it_ but Paxil takes the edge off_ so I can think about life situations and issues without driving myself insane.

Had very bad suicidal thoughts at night and my cutting increased to every day when it has never been like that.  It did help with social anxiety_ but def. wasen't worth it.

I am starting to taper off VERY SLOWLY because if you do it too quickly_ it is very bad getting off.  I remember the doc said it takes three to four weeks to reach peak performance_ so I am dropping the dosage only once every two months.  It will take a while_ but I hope it does the trick.

I am told that i am a much more pleasant person to be around_ less likely to fly off the handle_ and i don't have such a short fuse.  My moods are more consistent and predictable.

I attempted suicide 3 times and they found my liver enzymes to be over 6000 (less than 300 is normal}.Each attempt the hospital put me back on paxil. I finally went to stay with a friend to go cold turkey. It was the worst 4 MONTHS of withdrawal (?) I ever experienced. I wanted to die. Slowly the boils began to heal (3 were removed surgically) and I began to be able to carry on conversations and stay awake longer and longer. Doctors get MONEY and GIFTS when they prescribe drugs like these. They have NO incentive ti tell you the side affects_ even if they could kill you. Its been 2 years since I stopped taking paxil and the side affects are still lurking. My liver will never be the same and I still fear going to sleep.

I could sleep all night and day now_ which is wonderful at first after a lifetime of anxiety_ but now I want my energy back and do things again.,I've been on it for about 2 years. I would have recommended it a year ago_ but not any more. I've gained a ton of weight. I lost my job... it helped in the beginning with social anxiety at work_ calmed me down so I could be more productive_ but then made things worse by becoming lazy and not caring about stuff. In the beginning it helped with social anxiety_ but now I am LESS sociable than I was before. Some anxiety is good_ but I don't have any! I want some again...it motivates me.

Getting off Paxil: severe headaches_ vertigo_ nausea_ dizziness_ paresthesias in lips and hands_ loss of balance.,"I went on Paxil over 7 years ago for suicidal thoughts and depression.  I swear it saved me.  In combination with clonazepam for anxiety_ it was a life-saver.  The ONLY reason I wanted to get off of it_ was if I were to want to get pregnant.  My only successful attempt to get off (after 7 years) was with the help of Prozac.  I still had the withdrawal symptoms_ but they weren't as bad with the addition of Prozac.  Now I find that Prozac gives me its rare side effects and I have to get off that now.  If only Paxil didn't have such horrible withdrawal effects!!!  It works/worked for me and I may even go back on it.  Rather than try the ""drug dance"" of seeing what works and what doesn't_ I am lucky to have found that Paxil worked for me.

I've tried them all and I'm very sensitive to medications.  I've even ended up in the ER from SSRI's just in the first few days from the side effects_ but Paxil was started on a very low dose for me. We went with liquid Paxil and I started with 1 ML for 2 months_ then went to 2 ML for 4 months.  Then we got me to 5ML that is equal to 10mg. and I had theraputic results_ that's how sensitive I am.  But_ the weight gain made me insane so I stopped the meds in May 06_ and the panic is back (Sept 06 now) so I might have to take it again but being FAT isn't healthy either!

Had to call my husband to come pick me and my son up at school_ uncontrollable shaking and felt very very cold.  Despite my doctors assurances that it would get better_ I discontinued right away.,My doctor hesitantly switched me to Prozak_ which worked like a dream.  They told me to expect 6 weeks until full effect felt_ I felt like a normal human being again in 3 days.  Panic attacks completely gone.

Then I was put on Celexa due to weight gain from paxil.  Celexa didn't help as much with the anxiety when it came back this spring so I again decided to go back on paxil.  This time I am finding it's harder to adjust to the sleepiness and initial feelings of weakness_ perhaps because I'm older.

The sweating was so bad I couldn't bare to go anywhere if it was hotter than subarctic temperatures outside. Doc prescribed some topical agents that just dried out my skin but didn't stop the sweating. The heart palpitations were so bad I had to go in for testing and heart monitors. I was prescribed an anti-vertigo med for the dizziness which didn't help. I felt generally spaced out on this. It DID however dull my mood swings but to the point I wasn't as sharp as I am without it.

I have to go off Paxil because I gained so much weight!""  Look - if you're seriously stopping Paxil because you're gaining a few pounds_ then it's pretty obvious the panic_ anxiety or depression you have is a JOKE and is not bad at all.  If weight gain is more important to you than panicking every day_ being depressed every day and feeling anxious all the time_ then you need a serious reality check.  Get some perspective_ people.  You have to give Paxil a month or so to start completely working.  Once you do_ the side effects will go away and you'll feel 100% better.

I was too scared to try and come off it_ because every time I did_ I suffered from awful withdrawal symptoms_ both physical and psychological (e.g. I'd be too dizzy to stand up_ which was fine because I kept trying to kill myself). I'm also extremely unhappy that I was prescribed paroxetine at 17_ as it's now contraindicated for use in children and adolescents_ and I don't know if this drug has permanently messed up my brain chemistry.***I URGE ANYONE THINKING OF TAKING THIS DRUG TO RESEARCH IT CAREFULLY_ AND TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT IT.*** If they dismiss your worries or questions_ FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR.

609, 1, depression,My mom was on this drug.  She was extremely addicted_ had extreme rage and anger. Gained weight-but that's hardly worth mentioning if you saw what it emotionally did to her.,This drug made my mom MEAN.  She didn't like anything or anyone_ and became worse the longer she was on it.  She went from depressed to bi-polar beause of reacting to the drug.  She constantly talked of suicide and had suicidal thoughts.  Couldn't get off the drug because she was extremely addicted.  BE CAREFUL on this drug!  I realize that it may help some people_ and that's ok.  Those of you prone to addiction NEED to be careful.  It's very scary to see someone you love being affected in this way.  She was better off depressed.,F,40,3  years,3/7/2006,Paxil
610, 1, Depression/insomnia,Light headed_ mildly nauseous ('car sick') feeling from about day two. Felt distinctly 'dumber'. Within 5 days developed a strange body cycle whereby almost exactly every 6 hours (i.e. 4 times per 24 hour cycle) body temperature would sky rocket to point where  sweat poured out of scalp_ armpits_ groin etc and ran down body. This effect would last about 1 hour and subside again_ only to be repeated cyclically.  At the same time_ developed strong 'pins and needles' sensation in feet and lower legs in synch with cyclic heating effect. These effects persisted. After about 2 weeks one day the light headedness_ nausea and 'pins and needles' effect suddenly increased in intensity. At that point the  pins and needles effect also appeared in my arms and hands (as well as lower legs/feet) to the point where_ sweating copiously_ light headed and nauseaus and with limited peripheral limb sensation I almost crashed my car in heavy traffic on a freeway. On advice from doctor reduced the dose steadi,Prescribed by my doctor under brand name Aropax after my son's death in an air crash. As a middle aged PhD chemist by training_ and as a consequence of these effects I would be very suspicious of this drug at least under this brand name - especially from the purity point of view. The side effects might well be caused by poor quality control with respect to limiting side reaction impurities.,M,54,21  days,3/5/2006Email,Paxil
611, 5, Accute Social Anxiety Disorder,SORE TONGUE The only side effects that both myself and my sister have had is that both the original and the CR (controled release) causes our tongues to be very sore. Whether it be a low dose or high dose_ my tongue gets red_ cracked and especially sensitive on the edges -- This gets to the point that you actually tear up when brushing your teeth!  After long periods of taking even the CR_ I had to constantly swish my mouth with Ulcer Ease just to eat plain food -- it really feels like someone pouring salt on an open wound.I drink beer_ and thought that might be the problem_ however_ my sister doesn't drink and had the same problem.I had to eventually quit taking Paxil and it took about 5 months before my tongue was normal again.  I have something upcoming that will place me in a very social situation and I started taking it again about 2 weeks ago_ after about 3 days of taking only 25mg once a day_ I went from eating habenaro peppers to brushign my teeth in about 15 se,Paxil is a wonderful drug. When taking paxil I can get up and speak in front of 1000 people without a hitch_ without being on the drug I was at the point I couldn't eat at a table in the middle of a restaurant without going to the bathroom and about to burst out balling in tears.Again_ the only trouble is that it makes my tongue really sore_ and I mean REALLY sore.,M,35,4  years,3/4/2006Email,Paxil
612, 5, Panic Disorder_ Anxiety_ OCD,Abnormal ejaculation for the first week or so; lowered sex drive; yawning.  After that_ nothing.  Have not had a full-blown panic attack in almost 8 years thanks to Paxil.  The side effects are nothing compared to the panic and anxiety I felt every day.  Side effects subside; panic just gets worse unless you do something about it.,Absolutely wonderful drug.  If you experience side effects_ you must stop and think if the Paxil's actually causing them_ or if your own anxiety and they way you think when you're anxious is causing them.  My advice is to keep taking it and wait a few weeks.  The side effects WILL wear off and once you give the medicine a chance to get into your system and start working_ it will change your life.  It saved mine without a doubt.,M,34,8  years,2/27/2006Email,Paxil

615, 1, Depression/Social Anxiety,Within one hour of taking my first 20mg pill (7pm)_ thought I saw a large black spider crawling on a glass dish_ it was a reflection.  Freaked me out for a second.  Later when rocking my son to sleep in a dark bedroom_ had visions of a large venus fly trap engulfing us both.  Both visuals were absolutely not typical.  At work the next day (today) I was laughing pretty hard and I actually peed myself.  I have never done this in my entire life that I can remember.  Prior to this I was in a meeting and my right testicle began to throb_ lasted a few minutes before subsiding.  Another first.  It is now 9:30pm the next night-  I'm feeling ok_ and for the record will never take this again.,I felt great last night_ relaxed and genuinely engaging with my wife for the first time in_ well_ quite a while.  2-4 weeks to take effect?  No way_ the impact for me was immediate.  Today I was a different person at work_ albeit with the spider and fly trap on the back of my mind.  The tradeoff between leaving depression and a fear of close social situations and becoming a side effect sideshow is definitely not worth it.  Not to mention what laid in store in for me had I continued.  Spinal zaps_ are you frigging kidding me?!?!  Abnormal ejaculation?  What the???  I think if you are 60 and dysfunctional then this is right for you to improve quality of life-  I believe that it's beneficial as a last resort only.  One pill took me through a roller coaster ride like I have never experienced.

I would literally feel ""high"". Sure it made me feel better at first but it will NOT all of a sudden turn you into a social butterfly. In fact it made people think I was hyperactive because I could not shut up and I was constantly shaking.I gained 50 lbs in two years_ but I felt well enough emotionally that I didn't care. When I stopped taking it_ my problems were still there and on top of that_ I was huge...it didn't really help with my social phobia. DO NOT stop taking it suddenly_ talk to your Dr. I had vertigo that lasted for 2 weeks and I would shake so bad I actualy went back on it. The 2nd time I tried to stop taking it I got vertigo once again. It is addictive; you eventually feel like you NEED to have it. It is also extremely expensive.

My grades went from Bs then to Fs. 3 years later I started getting sick of my anxiety again so I went back on it.  Im a student at DePaul and now have all Fs once again.

627, 4, Agorophobia_Axiety/Depression,Major side effect for me was long and detailed nightmarish dreams.My own personal theory on this is two-fold. First_ Paxil almost completely eliminated my high anxiety and panic attacks that I was suffering from during my 3 year bout with agorophobia.However the consequence of this is that the internal fears I felt during waking concsciousness were being suppressed so much_ that in my dreaming subconscious state the fears came out in a heightened way.After 2 or 3 months the vivid_scary and often grotesque dreams did subside a bit_ and after a year or so I became used to them- even learning from them_ as I began to explore the recurring themes and patterns. The second reason why I believe this is happening has to do with the chemical make up of the drug and serotonin.Paxil increases serotonin activity in the brain.The chemical makeup of serotonin actually has similar qualities also present in LSD. Paxil itself is a very very mild hallucinatory drug which has accentuated the images_ symb,,M,34,3  years,1/2/2006Email,Paxil

So i decided to stop. I had been taking them for 4 months (20MG) and let me tell you i've been off em for 4 days and i feel like an insane person. I'm hearing noises and getting zaps of numbness through out my body. I read on the internet that this was caused by withdrawal. My anxiety is worse then before.

662, 2, depression and panic attacks,blunted personality_ no sexual drive_extreme withdrawal effects_,My doctor put me on this. I was reluctant_ but figured she knew best. I had no personality on it and felt no emotions_ which may have been a good thing at the time. I went off it after 1 year. I had extreme problems with the withdrawal and initally tried to take  a dose (10 mg) every other day for 4 days. I had the same electrical zaps in my head that others describe and felt dizzy and off balance. Once at work I had difficulty walking and had to hold onto the walls because of the strange electrical zapping in my head and loss of balance.  It was very disorientating. I decided to stop completely after about 2 weeks of weaning  myself off it.,F,48,1  years,6/26/2005,Paxil
663, 5, OCD_ anxiety_ intense worry,I felt better_ literally_ five hours after taking this drug. IT SAVED MY LIFE! Only side effects are jitteriness_ sort of like my body is buzzing_ if I take too much. Takes longer to have an orgasm_ but it is still possible.,I take a very low dosage. Was originally prescribed 20mg daily but I now take 5 mg (a 10mp cut in half) every other day.  It seems like practically nothing_ I am pretty tiny_ but it's the perfect dosage for me.  I have not experienced anything weird with this drug_ IT GAVE ME BACK MY LIFE from worry and OCD. I URGE OTHERS READING THIS POST to seriously think about the side effects that anxiety has and not attribute your symptoms to paxil necessarily_ I take paxil but I also worked VERY VERY hard to overcome my problems.  Paxil won't fix your life_ but it will help YOU FIX YOUR LIFE and  make it easier to think. Maybe it's not for everyone_ but it worked for me. Peace!,F,27,9  years,6/9/2005,Paxil
664, 3, depression,Complete loss of sex drive_ rash (similar to hives),Had same effect as Effexor on me.  I felt better_ but the side effects were too great to continue.  I had such a hard time (as others have described here) getting off the Effexor that I did not take the Paxil for very long in fear it would be similar.  I only took it two weeks and it only took a couple days to get it out of my system.,M,39,2  weeks,6/7/2005,Paxil
665, 3, anxiety,sleepiness_all the time,Paxil worked.. I guess I have been on it for so long its hard to tell. I still get anxiety every now and then. It seems as though I have tried everything and nothing works. The side effects trying to get off it are horrible! I get extremely moody and fill sick to my stomach. I have horrible dreams and intrusive thoughts. All the Drs have to say is I am just very sensitive. I think there was not enough research done on this drug before it was introduced to the public.,F,25,8  days,5/10/2005,Paxil
666, 1, dysthymia,Discontination syndrome is terrible. This drug should be taken off the market. Even after tapering off_ my discontinuation symptoms included: initially_ electric shock-like brain,I was fine on Paxil for a couple of years_ except for lethargy and greatly reduced sexual response. Then_ on the advice of an incompetent psychiatrist_ I tried Lexapro. He overdosed me (milligram for milligram_ Lexapro is approximately twice as strong as Paxil). Went back on Paxil. Paxil pooped out after about a year and was causing increased depression and despair. (Another thing the incompetent psychiatrist didn't know -- you can't go on and off Paxil; it is less effective the second time around.) I realized the cure for Paxil poop-out is NOT more Paxil! But much to my horror_ this thing is a treadmill. I have long-term discontinuation syndrome -- otherwise known as brain damage -- and am looking at having to get back on some other awful antidepressant that will also cause dependency.

I haven't had any other side effects and I am less anxious_ don't snap at people as easily and am easier to get along with. Feeling kinda down though!,F,25,3.5  months,5/4/2005,Paxil
668, 3, Anger Management Issues,My husband_ 35 year old male_ was taking Paxil for his anger problems. Before the drug_ he was abusive_ short tempered_ and extremely violent. After he got on Paxil_ he was a changed man. No anger_ violence_ or abuse anymore. He had no side effects while on it and all was going well. Until however_ he decided about three weeks ago_ that he would stop taking it. He took it for about 9 months and then when the last refill ran out_ he just stopped. Now_ he is right back to the way he used to be. He became very violent last night and was involuntarily committed today. He threatened suicide and completly lost it. I just hope the doctors can do something now to help him.,Please do NOT stop taking this medicine without speaking to your doctor about possible side effects.

Side effects disappeared after a month.,Extremely impressed with this drug. I honestly_ literally feel happier than I have in my life. Really. And I'm only taking 20 mg. It's also practically cured my SAD.I got the depressed libido that everyone complains about_ but it went away after a month. Interestingly_ sex is much more intense now and I can hold on for longer.I take the paxil first thing in the morning_ and it works much more effectively if I skip breakfast. Don't know why. Eating healthily and avoiding fat-containing foods also seems to help it work.,M,25,5  months,4/4/2005,Paxil
675, 4, Social Anxiety Disorder,Loss of libido and weight gain. I also take it with Thiothixene (Navane)and Tricor (for triglycerides). The mix might add to the side effects though.,Paxil has removed my shyness and I don't care what anyone thinks of me anymore. I am very comfortable in public. It seems to have dulled all feelings though. When my father passed away I only cried once. Not sure if it was the Paxil or just my way of mourning as everyone mourns differently. But overall I am happier with Paxil. Tried to get off quickly and got night sweats and insomnia. You have to wean yourself off SLOWLY!!!,M,49,3  years,4/1/2005,Paxil
676, 3, IBS,Sleepless nights_ insomnia_ extreme boredom_ short attention span_ weight loss (15pounds)_ no labido_ poor decision making skills_ 3-4 weird dreams per night with no direction or meaning,When i started taking it i had left my job_ got dumped by my girlfriend and was down in a lot of spirits_ so the direct purpose of the drug did help. This drug apparently has helped in off label use for people who suffer from IBS_ which helps the body from having spastic responses which causes diarrhea. I think in a lot of cases it has helped my cause_ but ultimately the strange dreams and lack of labido makes it hard to see this as a benefit to my lifestyle.  Other than that i am very worried as to what will happen i go off the drug and wonder how different i will see things.,M,26,3  months,4/1/2005Email,Paxil

Split the pill in half for a week_ and am now a few days into quarters (2.5 mg). I have noticed some inexplicable outbursts of rage_ but I can usually hold them in and chalk it up to withdrawl. After a week I'll start crushing it and licking up bits of pill dust_ I mean it_ after reading all the warnings about serious tapering.

But_ two years into taking the drug I began to sleep in excess of 16 hours a day.  I was constantly tired and taking daytime naps_ plus sleeping a full night. The drug began increasing my appetite and even with exercise_ I gained 20 pounds.,I am now trying to ween off the drug.  I am four days into that process and it's not going too well.

It also caused me to feel constantly exhausted.  I would sleep up to 16 hours a day on this drug.  It completely threw off my circadian rhythm (body clock).  It has taken me 8 years to get my sleep cycle back to normal.  I would not recommend this drug at all.  Effexor has been much more effective for me.,F,24,1  years,11/29/2004,Paxil

The doctor took me off of Paxil and within a few weeks I began losing the weight_ and the fat deposits on my liver disappeared. One of the reasons I was on it was depression_ gaining that much weight did not make me feel better about myself.

Kind of like having the flu_ but it wasn't as bad as some of the other anti-depressant drugs used for anxiety. In my opinion traditional benzo's like valium are best for anxiety at least you don't start seeing things an hour after taking a benzo. < Thats the side effect_ ( along with the bad body sensations and ichy skin )_ I hate most about antidepressants. All in all I stopped using it because it did nothing to treat my anxiety. I'm now being prescribed 20mg.s of diazepam (valium) to take three times a day and its working to treat my anxiety very well. At least with valium I felt relaxed enough to go out and get a job. PAXIL didn't work for me.,M,23,6  months,11/4/2004Email,Paxil

After going off the drug--several weeks of extreme dizziness_ brain shocks_ flashing lights_ confusion.,Initially_ the medication felt great and life could not have been better.  After about 10 days_ I stepped up the dose (from 10 to 20 mg/day)_ and experienced the most horrendous_ extreme panic attack of all time. (I had never had a panic attack prior to taking the Paxil---and for those of you who have never experienced a panic attack--it is the worst living hell that a person can experience). I stopped taking the drug immediately--and went into a state of pure panic disorder for several weeks.  It took me months to recover.

744, 2, depression,suicidality - dystonic reaction - diminished sex drive - akathasia - withdrawal syndrome - insomnia - complete loss of interest in anything (not quite apathy - just not being able to care one way or the other about much of anything),the paxil worked pretty well for about a month. then one day i decided to commit suicide (just like that) and proceeded to make an attempt on my own life that was just barely unsuccessful. i feel vindicated now that the fda is warning people about how dangerous paxil can be for teenagers_ because it almost killed me. since having stopped taking antidepressants_ i've also stopped being suicidal. i also had an acute dystonic reaction to paxil_ pursuant to a dose increase_ several months after the attempt_ that finally led to my discontinuation. the reaction was bad enough that i almost choked to death from the spasms in my pharynx. and then there's the effect paxil (and all the ssris) have on the sex drive - sex just stops to exist for all intents and purposes. it's still there_ you hear about it on tv_ but it just isn't worth the trouble. - it's better that way_ because should you ever get interested it'll be near-impossible to get an erection_ much less keep an erection (much less reach orgasm). and should you be able to actually reach orgasm_ it'll be about as nice as sneezing. in conclusion: if you're looking for a chemical lobotomy that doubles as a castration; one that will make you sweat and puke and feel like lightning bolts are running through your body when you try to stop taking it_ this is the drug for you.,M,21,11  months,10/30/2004,Paxil

You definately need to work with your doctor on gradually decreasing the dosage.My husband and I plan to have a child in the near future and I will have to get off of the drug for awhile.

I've recognized for many years that Paxil was causing my weight gain_ over active appetite and carb cravings_ but with the Paxil I just wasn't stressed about it.  In fact with Paxil_ I wasn't stressed about much.  I now recognize that feeling as apathy and believe it is a very real side effect of Paxil.I began tapering off Paxil about 3 weeks ago and have every negative withdrawal symptom already noted in the other reviews here. Terrible dreams_ neausea_ flu-like symptoms_ wierd eye tracking problems_ etc_ etc.  But I am convinced I need to get off this medication to bring my spirit back and care about myself again.,While Paxil was very helpful for me - it is now also very hurtful to me.

(They are hard to describe) I feel nausea on and off.  About 1 week after I started to wean off_ I got some kind of virus_ sore throat_ sweating_ head feels congested. (I'm not sure if this is really sickness),It helped me a little.  My symptoms subsided a great deal.  Didn't always feel great but didn't want to keep trying one drug after another.  I'm so nervous to completely stop this drug.  If I make it thru this and there are no future repercussions then I will say it was worth it for me.  I heard however that these drugs get stored in fat cells and when these fat cells get disturbed ie: losing weight_ exercising_ you get a burst of the medicine which causes a side effect.  I did try Zoloft a few years back but because I really didn't want to depend on a drug_ I stopped cold turkey 2 months later.  I did get residual side effects occassionally for about the next 6 months.,F,46,6  months,9/26/2004,Paxil

Long-term: Sexual dysfunction_ 30lb weight gain.,Paxil was very effective for my symptoms during the first two years that I took it.  However_ it is only now that I realize how much of my life I slept away in the last six years. Also_ long-term use WILL create anhedonia_ a feeling of no interest in ANYTHING.  I was an avid kayaker and photographer before I took Paxil_ yet over the years I let these hobbies and so many others fall by the wayside.  I got to a point where I couldn't feel ANYTHING! That's when I knew I had to get off this medicine.  Withdraw from Paxil was the hardest 3 months of my life.  I think going off of heroin would be easier!

My best dosage strategy is to start with 10mg (20mg resulted in severe headache). Gradually increased dosage after 12 weeks. It took 3 weeks to feel free from state of anxiety.Difficulty in sexual functions was directly related to dosage.  Actually_ SSRI's have been prescribed to treat premature ejaculation as an off label prescription. Could not ejacultate with 20 mg.  It took a long time to ejaculate with 10mg.  Normal ejaculation with 5mg. I did not experience loss of libido but ejaculatory disturbance sometimes led to frustrated experience,M,38,2  years,9/21/2004,Paxil

778, 1, increased anxiety,pretty much every side effect listed on this site,I was suffering from palpitations (due to being given too much thryoid hormone which I didn't find out until later)so my dr. and I agreed it could be anxiety and I would try Paxil Cr-12.5 mg. After taking the drug for about 2 weeks_ I was told I should go off of it because my dr. and I found that my palpitations were worse.  I reduced the dosage by half and then by another half over 2-3 weeks.  I developed odd symptoms and figured I was getting sick.  2 weeks after stopping the Paxil I was having head rushes/pressure that felt like my brain was going to explode out of my ears_ severe nausea_ anxiety like never before_ dizziness_ disorientation_ numbness and tingling in my arms/hands_ IBS_ chest pain_ etc.  Dr. put me back on 5 mg on Paxil (it has been 2 1/2 months now) I went to the ER on 2 occasions and to many specialists in the last several months.  I have heard inner ear problems_ dysautonomia_ panic attacks_ hormone problems_ etc. but I attribute it all to the trial of Paxil.

Then I just lived with the depression and anxiety for almost two years_ trying to handle it on my own_ before approaching my doctor to do something about it. My doctor prescribed 20 mg/daily of Paxil and 0.25 mg/twice a day of Xanax -- but I have read about the possibility of dependence on Xanax_ so I only took it for about a week.I've been taking 20 mgs of Paxil every morning for a little over a month now.

I felt normal again. I didn't feel like I was about to have a panic attack at any given moment.

824, 1, Depression & anxiety,While on the Paxil_ I was bulletproof.  I felt NOTHING.  That became problematic when I lost all interest in painting_ which was once a great and gratifying activity for me and quit socializing with friends. Life was a blurr. Weight gain was another factor_ I was on the med for about 6 months and gained about 80 pounds.  For that reason (since I was still gaining and could not lose_ even when I tried fasting)_ I quit.  Cold turkey.  I didn't have most of the withdrawl symptoms I've seen others post_ but I did have tracking vision problems (I was driving on a mountain pass no less).  I'd been off the drug for about 4 days_ but had them in my purse so stopped the car and took 1/2 of the littlest pill.  It stopped the strobe/tracking vision so I could drive within a half hour.  I spent 2 days in a mountain hot springs_ and I think I may have roasted the drug out of my blood stream. I have often wondered what I would have gone through if I hadn't soaked in very very hot water for 8 hours each of those 2 days.  When I returned home_ I was really irritable and my sleep was wacked out for a couple of months (still is actually)_ but mostly I was ok. While on the drug_ I had noted my hair and skin had thinned_ and sex drive had gone away.,I still am having sporadic Paxil withdrawl symptoms almost 5 years later.

Still have sharp lightening strikes in the head_ and the odd loud noise that I could hear coming_ it grew loud like right in my ear_ then went away (similar to doppler effect of an airplane flying over)_ and the occasional startling loud noise out of nowhere. Still battling the weight_ and it is coming off quite grudgingly.  Hair never grew back.  Sex drive non-existant.  I am of the opinion and have read a couple of others whose experiences seem to corroborate_ that these SSRi drugs do linger in the system (brain?) even though the blood stream says they are gone_ or they do permanent or lasting damage to the brain structure itself.  I wonder if this will now be life-long residuals.  I read somewhere that Paxil contains a flouride like compound.  A flouride based compound is also used in bug killer and can be quite toxic to humans.  I am now using techniques from the New Thought Movement (writings from 100 yars ago that still ring true) and that is helping me keep depression away_ and has totally extinguished the anxiety.  I also take Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil)_ Vitamin E and milk thistle to help rebuild my liver (PAXIL does a real number on liver function that can take ages to recover from).  These vitamins/herb have lessened the eye 'skitters' but the sounds still happen off and on.  My memory is very poor.  I'd not recommend SSRi meds to anyone.  I really am saddened that only now the studies are showing these should not be given to children....next let's hope there will be studies (not funded by the mfgr.)_ showing they should not be given to anyone.,F,50,6  months,4/10/2004,Paxil

827, 1, depression_ anxiety attacks,I HATE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since I've been on it_ my depression has been WAY worse than it ever was before I started taking it. I've experienced serious weight gain (40 lbs in 6 months!)_I need 10 - 12 hours of sleep a day_ I can't stand to be around people because I feel so detatched from everyone_ I am totally apathetic about things in my life that should be (& used to be) important to me.... all I really want to do is stay in bed and hide all day. With all these crappy side effects_ I figure I'd be better off just not taking the drug any more_ so I keep trying to wean myself off of it and now I know what hell is really all about. Each time I end up feeling completely psychotic. Weird electical zaps up and down my arms_ legs and face_ EXTREME agitation_ suicidal and homicidal thoughts_ nightmares_ night sweats_ muscle twitches_ vision problems (including tunnel vision_ strange random flashes of light_ etc.) headaches_ dizziness_ emotional outbursts and instability and a VERY STRONG feeling of being completely out of control.  I was seriously afraid that I was going to hurt myself or someone else. I would NEVER NEVER NEVER not in a million years EVER reccomend this drug to anyone_ not even my worst enemy.  Taking this drug was absolutly the worst decision of my life. I am now a Paxil junkie. I can only hope that I can get off this stuff one day and lead something that resembles a normal life.,The makers of this drug_ the ones who have marketed it to the unsuspecting public as being safe and having no serious side effects should be forced to take Paxil for awhile_ and go through Paxil withdrawl. I'd like to know how they feel about this wonder drug after they've personaly experienced it's hellish side effects! Thanks a lot for ruining my life!,F,31,3  years,3/24/2004Email,Paxil
828, 1, Social Anxiety Disorder_ Depression,weight loss_ night sweats_ electric sensations_ dizziness_ somnolence_ inability to experience orgasm,After having no success with Zoloft or Prozac_ my doctor put me on Paxil for social anxiety disorder and depression. Paxil was horrible for me. It made my depression about twice as bad as it originally was_ and I was contemplating suicide every day. Paxil had no effect on my social anxiety. While on Paxil_ I found it very hard to stay awake all day and I seemed to require at least ten hours of sleep each night (compared to the eight hours each night before taking Paxil). While on Paxil_ I would wake up at least five times every night after Id fallen asleep. I would wake up cold and shivering_ my whole body drenched with sweat. I lost 20 pounds while on Paxil_ without trying to. After Id been taking Paxil for a while_ I started experiencing electric-shock sensations when I turned my head or moved my eyes. This seemed to happen at random times_ but it gradually became more frequent the longer Id been taking Paxil. Ive tried many different antidepressants_ and Paxil was the worst.,F,19,4  months,3/17/2004Email,Paxil

I feel more confident around others.  I suffered alot of pain through-out my body but that has all gone now.  I feel like a better person now but I believe I can be even better over time_ I hope.I still suffer minor panic attacks but I'm hoping this will go in time.

834, 5, Depression / Panic disorder,some memory loss_ hair loss,I've been taking paxil for almost 9 years. I started taking it like I was told to_  everyday.  For the past 2 or more years I only take it every now and then.  I do agree with the others_  it is so hard to get off of it. Before I could go 3 or 4 days without it and feel like crap_  disoriented_ sick to my stomach_ shaky.  Just not normal feeling.   By all means_  it is a great drug to help anyone with a panic disorder or depression. But they're major side effects as far as getting off of it..  I have changed to zoloft.  I'm praying that it will help with the weight gain that I gained taking paxil and that it will help my hair to grow back.  That's another major side effect.  It will eventually make you start loosing your hair. (not that I am totally bald_  just really thin on top now). ,F,33,9  years,1/21/2004Email,Paxil

I was in my freshman year of college and taking pilots lessons and had a panic attack while flying solo. The paxil worked almost immediately. While the side effects are bothersome just about all drugs have side effects. The drug gave me the confidence to finish college_ obtain my MBA_ by the age of 24_ and be very successful at work. I have since went off because I want to explore other Meds (currrently Lexapro). Withdrawal effects are horrific. Caution--ween yourself off very slowly 4-6 weeks.,M,24,5  years,1/9/2004,Paxil

Paxil has 1. Greatly minimized my incompacitating symptoms of depression. 2.  Rendered managable my anxiety_  and 3. Completely eliminated my overwhelming and embarassing panic attacks.  I'd rate the medication higher if the side effects weren't as severe as they have been and I'd definitely recommend that any adjustments in the dosage of this medication be undertaken only on the advice of a doctor.,F,55,20  months,1/3/2004,Paxil

853, 3, Panic disorder_ Depression,I began at a dosage of 20mg and experienced immediate weight gain. I kept track of my weight on calandar; I gained 30 pounds from April to August. I was initially at 160lbs and after about 1 year I leveled off at 230lbs. I've never been obese in my life and attribute the weight gain to descreased activity and lethargy due to paxil. The other major side effect was both lack of sexual desire and inability to reach orgasim. Minor side effects included excessive yawning_ and lack of energy. Withdrawl symptoms came after missing only one day. They included small ticks_ dizziness_ and a feeling really spaced-out.,Side-effects aside_ paxil did help dramatically with removing anxiety and panic attacks. It removed my social anxiety completly. It reduced the frequency of my panic attacks by probably 80 percent; It also made the ones that did occur more tolerable. I experienced almost no stress when in large crowds or talking in front of people. This was probably also helpful for depression. I decided to switch to effexor after 2 years because i began to experience more panic attacks and was tired of not being able to lose weight practicly. I lost 30 pounds after switching_ through dieting and exercise. (Fyi - The psychological effects of paxil were better than effexor for me),M,27,2  years,8/21/2003,Paxil

893, 1, Depression,While taking Paxil I experienced weight gain_ loss of ambition and enthusiasm_ tremors/shaky hands_ loss of sex drive_ much constipation_ and joint pain.  My stomach has never been right  and my bowel movements only occur in extremes_ terrible constipation or hours of diarrhea.  Sleep patterns became a horrific cycle of being unable to fall asleep at bedtime coupled with an insatiable need to sleep for 10-13 hours per day.  You can imagine how disruptive it could be to lie in bed until 4 or 5 a.m. trying to fall asleep then feeling as though getting only 9-10 hours of sleep leaving you feeling drained and in an up-but-not-awake physical state.  Scary as all this sounds_ these issues pale in comparison to the nightmare of cessation from Paxil use.  Just like most here have reported_ I've been experiencing a maddening throbbing in my ears and am an emotional wreck.  As a 35 year old male with only a mild state of depression I can't even remember the last time I cried about something until I quit taking Paxil.  I cried on the 9/11 anniversary at least a dozen times_ I cried when Johnny Unitas died_ I cry when I listen to music_ I cry_ I cry_ I cry.  Do yourself a favor_ stand your ground with your healthcare provider and REFUSE to take this medication.  Zoloft worked much beteer without all the scary side effects.  Unlike some of the other folks here_ I never experienced the bad dreams or jaw clenching.,These side effects took a while to manifest themselves so I didn't realize they were related to Paxil until some recent media coverage began to report on some of the dangers associated with Paxil.,M,35,2  years,9/17/2002Email,Paxil

973, 1, depression,The greatest side effect I noticed were my dreams....I had very distubed sleeping patterns. And I had very vivid horrible dreams the entire time I was on Paxil.

Interestingly enough_ when I switched to Celexa_ the dreams stopped completely.Another side effect I had was involuntary twitching_ which I have heard reported by others taking Paxil.
