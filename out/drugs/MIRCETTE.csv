6, 5, Migraines_ period complications,People should specify if it's brand name Mircette or a generic brand because there IS a difference. Some medications I have to have brand name because generic does not work or I have reactions to.. so there is a difference. The filler or inactive ingredients can be completely different. With that said I suffer from debilitating migraines_ fibroid tumors_ severe menstrual issues. I am kept on pill continuously so I don't have a period and to control migraines. I've had reactions to a lot of pills. BRAND NAME MIRCETTE has little to no side effects for me and my migraines were so much better. Didn't feel moody/down and it didn't affect weight or skin like other pills. This has best low dose combination without having the androgenic effects like a lot of other pills and that is a wicked thing. I've tried about every pill_ method over the years due to my issues and this has been best one. Everyone is different though. You really need to give it a couple months to know how it's working especially if you were on something before as it takes a while to get all of one med/pill/hormones out of your system and to adjust to another. Some side effects could be from overlapping or the drop of the one pill (hormones) getting out of your system so keep that in mind when starting a new pill.. give it time cause it could be the other pill still in your system or that it's leaving your system and your hormones are fluctuating.. also be cautious with certain generic brands. Read reviews on them!,,F,42,2  years1xD,7/28/2014,Mircette

All these things did resolve after ceasing to use Mircette except I'm stuck with hypertension for life as well as a dysfunctional thyroid. I am grateful I had enough sense to get off it when I did because I was well on the road to a stroke.,Somebody below mentioned that they thought this drug was the conspiracy of a communist. No_ it is actually the avarice of a capitalist because only a capitalist pharmaceutical company  answers to Wall Street and would try to make money out of the sufferings of women. If you need to take this compound for contraception_ do your body a favor and find a non-hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. The convenience is not worth the cumulative effects on your body. If you need to take for perimenopause_ get on bioidentical therapies ASAP. Ever wonder why there are no bioidentical contraceptive drugs? Because they can't patent a naturally occurring estrogen such as the human female body actually recognizes because Nature has already designed it via millions of years of human evolution - IN OTHER WORDS DRUG COMPANIES WON'T MAKE ANY MONEY!!!!!

31, 5, Birth Control_ Regulate Hormones,The only side effect I have been dealing with is increased appetite_ which I can handle_ because I looove food and because I wanted to gain weight anyway.,Have been on this for about 3 months now_ and so far it has done wonders for me.  I mainly went on it to control my hormone levels.  Before going on this_ I was experiencing horrible symptoms 2 weeks before menstruating all the way into the week after.  I dealt ok with the breast swelling_ food cravings and headaches_ but when I started getting heart palpitations and even having trouble with shortness of breath_ not to mention horrible irritability and mood swings....I just knew it had to be something to do with my shift in hormone levels_ because of the time frame and consistency.  There was maybe a week out of the month that I was fine.  Was surprised when I read all the negative here.....it has done nothing but good for me so far.  I feel so much more balanced and all the symptoms are gone that I had before....Haven't even had any migraines like I was experiencing.

32, 5, To reduce migraines,I can't think of any.,It is a miracle drug.  I used to get migraines almost everyday and then I went on birth control and I only had them during the placebo week.  Still 5-7 days of migraines is not feasible when you are single and have a more than full time job.  Since I went on Mircette I rarely have migraines - maybe 5 a year and all are tension/stress induced rather than hormone induced like they used to be.  Also_ I've been on Mircette so long that I no longer have a period.  There is no way I could live without this medication.,F,35,  1X D,12/6/2011Email,Mircette

However_ My husband and I decided to have another baby_ and after just 2 days off the pill_ my sex drive is BACK.  I'm still tired and moody_ maybe just PMS_ but the pill is 100% responsible for the lack of a sex drive.

I feel like I have a dark cloud over my head at all times. I want to cry all the time. I'm experiencing dryness which is ruining sex. I've never experienced these issues before. I really feel like birth control has ruined the last year of my life and im about to say screw regular periods and just come off the pill!!!!!!!

I was put on generic Azurette....I was on this only because my doctor thinks birth control is amazing to prevent cancer... bad news is I was on it for years and still ended up a cervical cancer patient. But my mother had uterine cancer also as well as cervical so he feels I'm at risk. Clearly I am. But he also suspected endometriosis_ without testing putting me on this due to the fact that I take daily migraine medicine. TWO WEEKS and I was a mess. MOODY_ Acne_ My Teeth were SO sensitive I couldn't brush_ could barely drink anything or eat. Needless to say I stopped it and my teeth finally quit hurting and it's only been 5 days off the pill.

I finally learned that the FDA allows generic manufacturers to have up to 20% deviation in active ingredient concentration. I think Barr Labs (manufacturer of Kariva) is taking advantage of these lax requirements and the fluctuating hormone concentrations messed with my body.

My big problems are with Azurette_ which the pharmacy switched me to. I took Azurette for a month in the spring and had all the bad side effects. I got off of it and everything started to clear up. Then my periods got bad again (3 in 3 weeks) so I got back on it. Immediately_ the bad symptoms started again. Now I'm taking it 3 times a week_ just enough to keep the periods at bay until I can get to the doctor in November. Once he switches me to a new pill_ I will never use Azurette again.

It was surprising I never imagined birth control could have such negative side effects.,I was on the Nuva ring but it made me crazy; paranoid_ moody_ depressed.

For a few months it regulated my period_ while making my body go crazy in numerous other ways (headaches_ acne_ mood swings_ etc.) which were manageable so long as I had a regular cycle. Out of the blue_ about 3 months ago_ I started spotting.. HEAVY spotting. So basically just a 2-month period. My doctor had me double up and everything was magically better.

70, 5, Regulate period_ birth control,None,I started to take this after I became anemic for having up to 15 day long heavy flowing menstrual cycles.  From the very first month it worked like a charm.  I only have 4 day long periods_ sometimes only 3 days.  I have not experienced any significant weight gain from this pill.  I have been on it for four years now and it also cured me of the majority of very painful cramps I experienced.  I do not have any mood swings and this pill is very effective for birth control.  Never experienced headaches from it_ and was fine with Kariva and Azurette.  Basically outstanding birth control!!  I can not understand why so many people have all these problems with it.  Keep in mind_ some things like crazy mood swings is not to blame on the birth control since it has a very low dosage of estrogen because you can control your own actions!!  Simple as that. :),F,19,4  years 1X D,3/22/2010,Mircette
71, 1, No_ my girlfriend is,"oh gosh where do i start. The side effects is not just directly to my girlfriend.  It affected me too. It is hard to see your girlfriend turn into somebody which she is not.  Her mood swing_ grumpy oh boy... it was un-predictable. low in tolerance and most of all i cant stand looking at her being tired all the time and i""m helpless. Because every time i try to be supportive_ she will take it in a wrong way. I become annoying [according to mircette] she will be irritated. Not so much about her sex drive_ this one was gone too. If it wasn't because of our communication and the acceptance of cause which the mf'er Mirdette.  We will have a big   discussion [in other words: argument].  OMG what a trip... really.. this pills should not be recommended.  Poor couples out          there... Above all this_ my girlfriend is the most wonderful person before Mircette.  I rather have the Rhythm method for birth control than seeing my girlfriend suffer for all of this.",Is this made by a communist.

I feel immensely better and happier -- it's a dream come true_ as I've suffered crippling PMDD for decades and it has been getting worse as I get closer to menopause. Mircette side effects seem to be getting better. First three or four days_ sleeplessness_ indigestion. Still have a bit of acre_ itchy vulva_ and strange appearance of canker sores on mouth.

73, 2, irregular periods_ birth control,canker sores_ headaches_ emotional for no reason_ dryness_ low sex drive,I started Mircette 10 months ago because I was on Reclipsen (Apri_ Desogen) for nine years and started getting migraine-like headaches from it in more recent years.  The Mircette helped a lot with the headaches_ made them a lot more manageable_ but did not get rid of them completely.  I just quit Mircette earlier this week because of canker sores that I suspect are from the pill (they appeared during my period).  I have two large sores that are horribly painful and I have never had anything more than a small canker sore once every few years.  Now that I quit the pill_ I am going through hormone withdrawal with bad headaches_ nausea_ anxiety in my chest_ and I feel like I'm on an emotional roller coaster.  But I'm done trying different pills and I just want to know what it feels like to NOT be on the pill.  Most of my pill-related side effects didn't start happening till 6 years into being on the pill.  I first got on the pill for very irregular periods that eventually sent me to the ER.  I don't want to go back to that_ but I feel like I have no choice.  I have had so many side effects--even really painful gingivitis that I had no idea where it was coming from because I always go to the dentist and I have good hygiene.  Finally I found out that gingivitis and canker sores can be caused by hormones.  I'm tired of feeling emotionally wacky and having all these strange symptoms.,F,28,10  months 1X D,2/26/2010,Mircette

I woke up with a headache one morning and ended up being rushed to the hospital when it got much much worse. In the end the doctors determined that I had a complicated migraine with neurological symptoms. I was not able to speak or write for a few hours and the pain was extremely intense.

Everything annoys me_ even small things. Anything my husband or kids do pisses me off. I snap at people all day long and this is not me. I do not like the person I have become these past several months. I have also had increased anxiety and experienced my first panic attack.

I have been on BC for 11 years and have tried so many methods.  Mircette has been the one I have been on the longest_ after trial and error with Ortho Tri_ Alesse_ Depo shot_ and a few others.

Only positives are a slightly lighter period and no pregnancy.,I've been taking the generic form (Kariva) for about 7 months. The first month I was EXTREMELY moody and didn't even want my fiance to touch me. It increased the intensity of all my emotions (anger_ sadness_ etc.) Lately_ I've been dealing with severe anxiety and paranoid feelings. I feel moderately depressed and have a negative outlook on everything. My sex drive seems non-existent. My breasts have become sore at times and are more large than necessary. I've recently been experiencing chest pain. I went to the doctor for an EKG and everything was normal_ so I'm suspecting the BC has something to do with it considering Im on no other medications. The diminished sex drive and anxiety/ panic attacks are the worst considering I've never had a problem with either in the past. I'm only 21 and feel like my body is falling apart.

My Dr. is now switching me to ortho-cept b/c mircette did not decrease the length of my periods much. I also noticed a slight increase in cramping this last cycle. I will finish the month on kariva and start on ortho-cept. My last period on kariva I bled for 6 days had 2 days of no bleeding and then bled on day 9. Hopefully ortho-cept will help. :/ The 2 months before that weren't much better in regards to bleeding duration.

After trying_ loestrin 24_ yaz_ and orthotricyclen lo I thought I would never find a pill that was good for me_ but Mircette is amazing. I had HORRIBLE mood swings and other terrible side effects with the other pills. However_ with Mircette_ I am happy_ lost weight_ skin cleared a bit_ and my libido is sky high. I'm so thankful for this pill. It rocks,F,18,2  months,7/10/2009,Mircette
109, 2, birth control,depression_ weight gain_ mood swings,This is a horrible birth control pill. 15lbs weight gain_ not to mention my serious mood swings_ which often times result in everyone thinking i am crazy. I switched from Yaz to now this and I hate birth control. I was always fine off of this_I hate it and want out.,F,18,1  years,7/7/2009,Mircette
110, 3, acne_ birth control_ gain weight,Depression_ low sex drive_ cleared some acne_ weight gain,First of all_ I want to point out where the bc pills are manufactured from makes a huge deal in side effects.  The one manufactured from France and Ireland_ Mercilon as they call it_ cleared up my skin completely without having to deal with depression.  As opposed to the Mircette manufactured in India_ which did not do much for my acne and made me irritable.  Same manufacturer Organon and same ingredients_ but they came from different countries.  In the past I've tried Orthotricyclen which did nothing for my acne_ just made my hair fall out_ and eat like a horse.  I tried Alesse which has the least side effects of all the pills I've tried_ but does nothing for acne.  I tried Desogen too_ which is the same as Mircette but with one-third more estrogen_ so that means one-third more side effects!  I really hope in the future they will come out with new pills with less estrogen because it will help cut down all these side effects we women are describing here.  I only continue to take Mircette because it's the best one I tried for acne and slight weight gain (I'm underweight).,F,31,11  years,7/6/2009,Mircette
111, 2, Prevent pregnancy.,Horrible mood swings_ crying for no reason_ worst cramps of my life_ suicidal thoughts_ loss of sex drive_ get mad A LOT easier_ and breakthrough bleeding.,I started this pill when my boyfriend and I started having sex. Everything was great_ and we always wanted eachother_ but I notice after taking this pill_ I dont want it as much. And my crazy mood swings dont help either_ we just moved in together and he things i'm crazy! I cry for no reason ALOT. Its embarressing. I also had the worst cramps of my life. I was perfect without birth control but I can not have a baby!,F,18,3  months,6/24/2009Email,Mircette

113, 1, Regulate Bleeding and cycle,Blood cluts developed in lower legs and painful leg swelling and ankle/foot swelling,Was fine until about 1 year to the day legs swelled up terribly with leg and ankle swelling -- hospital er room took a sonogram and found blood clots in vascular veins -- too bad.  The pill otherwise gave me no other side effects but had to go off due to the clots.... still have the swelling as well even almost two years off Mircette.,F,46,365  days,6/14/2009,Mircette
114, 3, period regulation.,not many.  do skip an occasional month or two of my period.  may be due to stress.  still highly aggitated around start of period.,mircette was great.  was switched to kariva forever then they have apparently quit making that or something so on to azurette.  seem to be okay on that.  just wish they would stick with one.,F,27,8  years,6/11/2009,Mircette
115, 4, severe pms_ regulate period,slight loss in libido_ a little nauseousness in the beginning,I used to have severe cramps and depression on the first couple of days of my period (if I even got it that month)_ which is why I went on the pill.  Since being on Mircette my depression is gone_ my periods have been on a regular basis_ last about three days_ I bleed much less_ and my cramps have all but disappeared.  I did have a little bit of nauseousness in the first month but it completely went away by the second month.  Your doctor should tell you that you may experience some nauseousness for the first couple of months_ and the pill's information sheet says the same thing_ so don't give up to soon.,F,22,5  months,5/30/2009,Mircette
116, 4, BC_ schedule periods_ cramps,5 lb weight gain_ possible lowering of libido_ possible breast enlargement (maybe 1/2 cup size),I took Mircette for about 2 years then switched to the generic Kariva (also good) for another 2 years and now am on to the other generic Azurette (no problems so far). I actually was pleased with this BC...my periods are shorter_ it helped with cramps_ and got rid of my acne. Everyone is different so don't soley rely on these reviews! For example_ I also tried Desogen which my body did not like (more negative side effects for me). Talk to your doctor!,F,24,5  years,5/8/2009,Mircette

119, 4, Birth Control,Low libido_ weight gain_ mood swings/unusual emotional responses.,"I took Mircette for years with no problem...I loved it.  Then I went off the pill and got pregnant very easily.  I took the ""mini pill"" while I was breast feeding_ and did not like that due to low libido.  So I stopped the pill all together and my libido returned.  As soon as I was done nursing I went back to taking Kariva (the generic) and the first month has shown many of the symptoms I have seen reported by others...lower libido_ dryness_ mood/emotional swings_ weight gain.  I am really hoping that after the next month or so these things clear up as they have for others_ especially since I did so well on this pill before.",F,33,32  days,5/4/2009,Mircette

122, 4, breast tenderness_ heavy periods,gained a few pounds_ some mood swings,I've tried several pills and honestly this is the one that gave me the LEAST side effects. Loestrin24 made me gain a TON of weight_ yaz and yasmin gave me spotting and nausea.. but Mircette has had none of those effects. It makes my periods really light and tolerable and after switching around a few times_ this is my favorite pill so far. If you are having a lot of problems with it_ you may be getting the generic.,F,21,6  months,4/14/2009,Mircette
123, 4, Pre- Menopause/ Heavy periods clots,Negative: stomach issues and diarrhea_ headaches on occasion. POSITIVE: Mood has improved_vaginal dryness gone_ irritation from thinning skin at groin area gone_ increase in breast size.,Never been on birth control pills_ now Doc is trying this on me for the heavy periods I began to have a few months ago just as I hit my 47th birthday. They were heavy enough for me to need to change tampons and pad every hour. Even flooded through everything when I had thought I finished my period. This made it very hard to function. I also began to have severe cramps and large clots. I have had one period and just started my second since being on Mircette and so far so good. First one was a little lighter but still had some small clots and lasted 8 days. I am wondering about my stomach issues but for the most part I feel good being on this. I am not opposed to my breast size increasing or tenderness. The best thing is my vaginal dryness has gone! Matter of fact seems my skin overall has more collagen and is not as dry or thin. So I am assuming for us older women this extra low dose of Estrogen is just the boost our bodies might need to carry us into menopause a little easier. And my husband and I have a lot more freedom since we are not worried as much about a later in life pregnancy!,F,47,53  days,3/31/2009,Mircette
124, 3, To regulate periods,On the off week_ I occasionally have migraines. And if I take the medicine too late or on an empty stomach_ I get very nauseous.,Generally works pretty well. No spotting or issues with the actual function of the pill,F,24,11  months,3/31/2009,Mircette
125, 2, acne_ irregular periods,exhausted every afternoon.  So sleepy.  Nausea for the first five days of pills each month.  Then on month three right before period_ horrible_ horrible migraine!  I run 4 days a week_ and have still gained almost 10 pounds on this.  Only benefit has been clearer skin for me.,So not worth it!,F,40,3  months,3/23/2009,Mircette
126, 1, birth control/ pre-menopause,Extreme irritability_massive migraines behind one eye_ tender breasts_ weight gain_ irrational behavior and mood swings galore.,Having never taken birth control pills_ at 37 and entering pre-menopause my doctor & I agreed on a low dose contraceptive for regulating my periods and preventing pregnancy. This has been the most emotional 3 month trial ever experienced_ and not a good one! Glad to read I wasn't the only psycho out there on this!It's totally not for me!!,F,37,3  months,3/21/2009Email,Mircette
127, 4, regulate bleeding on depo,nothing significant..for the first 3 days when i took the pill_ i felt a bit tired and a little weak for a fe hrs but thats all gone now.,AMAZING! I got my first depo shot in septemember and i was spotting none stop until mircette. i read somewhere online where birth control pills can regulate the bleeding from depo. well i tried it and within 1 week my bleeding stopped! im trying to get into the habit of taking the pill_ but right now i have the depo as a backup.,F,25,8  days,3/19/2009,Mircette
128, 1, Birth Control,I experienced extreme fatigue from the beginning.  The last 3 days I experienced mild migraine headaches and horrible mood swings.  I dealt with post partum depression after the birth of my son_ and this was almost as bad.  I cried for no reason and EVERYTHING irritated me.  I have tried several different BCPs_ and this has been the worst for depression/mood swings.  Also experienced a change in vaginal lubrication; VERY dry.  Would NOT recommend to anyone.,,F,28,6  days,3/19/2009,Mircette
129, 5, PCOS_ birth control,None,When I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) I tried different BC to regulate my period and this one had no side effects.  As a newly wed_ I'm using it now to both regulate my period and birth control.  (Yes_ most women with PCOS find it difficult to get pregnant_ but it's not impossible.)  Sex drive is fine.  As a teen_ I had pretty normal periods complete with standard PMS symptoms (cramps_ mood swings_ etc. but nothing too crazy)  When I started showing symptoms of PCOS_ my periods lasted longer (months) and I had long stretches between periods_ but I had no PMS.  Since I've started taking this pill_ PMS symptoms have come back but not so badly that it bothers me much. My husband has noticed that my diet and physical activity makes a difference with the PMS (he's a bit of a health nut so he notices these things) and I figure PMS is better than living with a period for as long as 3-4 months.  Everyone reacts differently to different BC. Try different ones until you find one right for you.,F,27,6  years,3/18/2009,Mircette
130, 1, ,bloating_ moodiness_ irritable_ breast tenderness_ headache,I hate this pill.  My doctor prescribed it for pre-menapause and i've been miserable for one month.

131, 5, birth control,none,I loved it. I switched from Ortho Lo to Mircette after my gyno confessed that ortho lo is one or the worst out there. She said that unfortunately_ she HAD to offer it to girls first. This was her favorite- and it's been great for me for the past 4 years!,F,28,4  years,3/15/2009,Mircette
132, 4, painful periods; birth control,None that I know of,I started on Mircette but have been on Kariva (the generic) for several years. It has definitely helped as I used to have the most painful periods. My only real complaint is that it has never made my periods any shorter...they are normal from Mon-Wed/Thurs but then I still spot for a few days after that. I'm not sure about weight gain either since I have been on birth control almost constantly since I was 16. I might even lose weight if I ever decided to go off of it.,F,28,6  years,3/12/2009,Mircette
133, 3, regulate periods,spotting_ nausea_ clearer skin_ anxiety_ lowered sex drive_ weight neutral_ breast pain-very sore and tender.,On one hand I like the clear skin but the breast pain is somewhat unbearable.  I was on femcon fe for two months and had very severe spotting_ since taking mircette have just started spotting on the last week of active pills.,F,30,18  days,3/12/2009,Mircette
134, 1, Birth Control,Oh wow. One and a half weeks (almost) and I'm a completely different person. SO_ SOOOO tired. I'm irritable like never before! Can't climax since I've been on it. Mood swings/highly emotional_ which has me suddenly crying for what seems to be minor things. Analyzing everything with a negative outlook.,I've always been on birth control(BC). Usually Ortho Tricyclen/Tricyclen-Lo; a lil' over a year ago I got off all BC as I was w/ no partners. I haven't been on anything for over a year & about a week ago I started Mircette. The experience has been like night & day! Everything irritates me. I'm constantly pissed off. I'm tired all the time_ I don't want to be around my boyfriend & everything he does is stupid & pointless to me and I don't understand why_ which in turn frustrates the HELL out of me to the point of tears! We talked today and decided that if this is the way it's going to be - then there's not going to be anyone in the relationship to even BOTHER being on BC for_ so what's the point? I'm not taking this pill anymore. It's not worth it... we miss the old me.,F,27,10  days,3/10/2009Email,Mircette
135, 1, Birth Control,Bloating_ migraine headaches_ extreme anxiety_ weight gain_ acne,I'm not sure why it dawned on me this morning that all of my symptoms may be realted to being on Mircette_ but I am glad that it did. I have never liked being on the pill at all_ and have been on it off and on over the years. However_ these are the worst side effects I have ever suffered. I have gained 8 pounds since starting this pill_ have had migraines_ severe anxiety and depression_ bloating_ the list goes on. I thought I was losing my mind_ but now I know_ it was this awful birth control pill. I hope that other women will see these posts and get off of it!!!!,F,31,3  days,3/6/2009Email,Mircette

I have not taken BC in many years & I can't wait to use condoms again!  My breasts are beyond ""tender""- they feel like they did when I was pregnant with my children.  I can't sleep_ I've gained enough weight to make my jeans uncomfortable- I'm a size 4 but feel like a 6 right now.  My fingers are so swollen that my wedding band is very uncomfortable- could hardly remove it last night.",I would steer clear of this pill- unless you loved everything about pregnancy- weight gain_ swelling in hands & feet_ insomnia_ increased appetite_ painful & swollen breasts.  My clothes are tight_ I feel terrible & I can't sleep.  I don't know if I should take the next pill or buy a pregnancy test!  If they gave this BC to high school girls_ unwanted pregnancy wouldn't be an issue anymore since you feel fat & awful.  I can't wait be my old self again.,F,37,3  months,2/15/2009,Mircette
141, 1, many different reasons,I tried to stick out trying this BC pill for 3 months_ but I had my period and break through bleeding almost the entire 3 months while on this and I needed to get off it. I also seemed to suffer from more migraines and visual migraines. Big Thumbs down for me. I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen for a few years from the age of 16. (no issues that I can think of from that) I stopped around age 20-23 briefly. Tried something else briefly_ and then this stuff. I then switched to Ortho Tri-Cyclen lo and it was great. Great for relief from the constant pelvic pain I would experience while off that pill. I had shorter_ light periods_ it cleared my skin right up. On the down side I was depressed_ extremely moody and sensitive. I am on my first day of Yaz. You can be I will post my feelings on that one in a couple  months. Hopefully it helps someone else! I hope this one works for me_ wish me luck!,Big thumbs down for me.,F,28,2  months,2/8/2009,Mircette
142, 1, to regulate my period,Where do I begin?! I have taken Mircette before and I guess I just forgot about why I stopped taking it the first time. I started back on it a month ago. Since then_ I have had sudden bursts of anxiety for no good reason_ mood swings_ extreme loss of appetite_ hot flashes_ diarrhea and nausea. At first I did not associate it with Mircette and I decided to get online and do a little digging. After reading many other women's experiences I realized I was not alone and I wasn't going crazy! My poor fiance has been having to put up with me for the last month and I don't know how he did it. It just makes me realize what a keeper he is after his tolerance of me over the last month! :O) I made the decision to get off of it and get my life back! I hope my post helps anyone else who is having the same experiences realize you aren't going crazy_ it is this pill!,,F,39,1  months,2/8/2009,Mircette

Once I got over the nausea_ I was A-OK. Until I started missing periods_ which had me a little freaked_ but after some online research I found out that it was normal for low dose birth control pill user. Mircette is a low dose birth control pill. Also found out later on that birth control pills can cause mole growth_ and twitching. I have started having frequent migraines. I am also noticing that I have very huge mood swings_ one minute I am on cloud nine_ the next I am ready to snap on the nearest person.I have also been on Ortho-Low_HATED IT. Alesse_ HATED IT. and Kariva_ which I think the FDA should pull due to the number of suicide issues I have read about this pill_ which I have personally experienced.,F,28,3  years,2/6/2009,Mircette
145, 5, BC,None =),I've been on this pill for 10 days and so far so good. I was very hesitant on taking this pill because of the reviews ive read. I decided to suck it up and try it. I've had no side effects so far at all. Remember every girls body is different and react to things differently so my advice to any girl thinking of taking this is try it and see for yourself. Hope this helps.,F,23,10  days,1/27/2009,Mircette
146, 1, prevent pregnancy,depression_ mood swings_ tired_ loss of sex drive_ anxiety,I can't tell everyone how happy I am to be reading these comments from everyone- what a relief!!  It was just last night that I figured out what was causing all of my problems.  For the past 4 months I could not understand why I was so moody_ irritable_ and anxious all the time.  I have been married for almost 6 years and have 2 small children.  I have a great husband and my life is great and secure.  I could not figure out what my problem was.  I had always been a relatively sexual person and over the past few months I was unable to figure out why I had no desire to have sex with my husband (poor guy)! It wasn't until yesterday_ when i got a call from my OBGYN confirming today's appointment that it hit me... this stupid pill is messing me up_ big time!  I then decided to research it a little and as I was reading what so many of you wrote- I felt like you were describing ME.  I thank you all so much for offering your support and I am stopping this PILL today.  We will find a better way,F,30,4  months,1/21/2009,Mircette
147, 1, to regulate periods,depression_ huge mood swings_ suicidal thoughts_ tiredness_ loss of appetite,About a day after I started taking this pill I started to have rollercoaster mood swings. I was tired all the time. I went to bed early and slept late. About a week after I started taking it_ I would begin to cry for no reason.I also lost my appetite completely- even the thought of eating would make me sick. I had no sex drive- I didn't even want my fiance to hold my hand. I also was having suicidal thoughts and I did't want to live anymore. I also began to doubt anything and everything. I worried all the time about things that I couldn't control. I have been off this pill for a little over a week and I still am experiencing some mood swings. I still have not much of an appetite but it is slowly coming back.,F,21,14  days,1/19/2009,Mircette

No weight gain.,I have been taking it for about 3 or more years now_ I had no side effects at the beginning_ but after a year or so I became very irritable_ depressed_ nauseated all the time_ occasional headaches_ etc.  I didn't gain any weight or get acne_ which was great.  It's been a week since I've been off it and already feel a relief.  I'm actually feeling happy & more energetic. I am taking a new pill without the progesterone to see if it makes a difference.

151, 2, to treat menopausal symptoms,migraines_ depression_ breast pain_ bloating_ weight gain in stomach area_ loss of sex drive,My doctor recommended I try this pill to treat pre-menopausal symptoms and painful and frequent periods (twice a month). The migraines seemed to subside after the first month or two but are back. I have lost all desire for sex_ feel depressed alot_ have gained weight even though I work out and eat healthy. I have had sharp chest pains during certain times of the month. I recently was called back for a second screening (mammogram and ultrasound) and was told my breast tissue has changed and to be sure to do monthly self exams and report any changes. This may have nothing to do with this pill but I'm getting concerned and considering quitting taking the pill.,F,47,6  months,1/13/2009,Mircette

153, 4, REGULATE CYCLE,I had used Lo-Estrin briefly many years ago and stopped due to breast tenderness.  I have found that Mirecette has made my breasts very tender. I usually never get headaches_ but have begun to suffer from them now. I also have an uncharacteristically low libido.,The first month went well and my cycle came as predicted.  This second month_ although I have taken the pill on-time every day_ I am having breakthrough bleeding and what appears to be early onset of my cycle.,F,39,60  days,1/8/2009,Mircette

I cannot wake up in the mornings and sleep till 1 pm.  I'm losing MY LIFE.  No ambition or sex drive.  I was MUCH happier on the natural progesterone cream_ with tons of libido before. Thought maybe my hard floors were the problem but I think it's this horrible pill as a result I have to wear support shoes constantly.  Has helped with sinuses. Has caused frequent urination as well. I'm active and a positive person and this has RUINED ME.  I'm quitting it now!!!,F,33,13  days,1/4/2009Email,Mircette
156, 3, Birth Control,Restless/anxious_ breast tenderness,I have been taking the generic Kariva_ for about 5 years and the past 6 months have been feeling restless and having that anxious leg feeling all during the day and feel jittery. I am not on any other medications and thought maybe I needed to take a vitamin but that has not helped.  I feel moody at times and tired and it is impossible to loose any weight on this drug.  Has anyone else felt this jittery feeling_ kind of like you have to constantly be moving to feel relaxed- hard to describe. I have had normal anxiety before but this is not that.  I am a therapist and know my body pretty well and symptoms so I am thinking it is the Kariva and may switch to Ortho-Lo. I have tried Avian/Alesse and other lo pills but they do not have good side effects. Regular Ortho would make me vomit in the mornings.,M,34,5  years,12/31/2008Email,Mircette

158, 1, Birth Control,NO SEX DRIVE AT ALL_ extreme fatigue_ horrible acne_ extreme moodiness_ weight gain_ dizziness,I have tried many other pills in the past_ which have all caused migraines_ so my doctor recommended I try Mircette. This is the worst pill I have ever been on_ and I've tried 6 others. I think it works as a birth control method by completely eliminating any desire to have sex whatsoever. I can't even stand being touched. I am depressed_ have horrible breakouts around my mouth/chin_ and have random dizzy spells. I would absolutely NOT recommend this pill to ANYONE,F,25,2  months,12/22/2008,Mircette
159, 2, BIRTH CONTROL,WEIGHT GAIN.  I HAVE GAINED 10 LBS SINCE BEING ON THIS BIRTHCONTROL.  MY BREAST GET PAINFUL AT TIMES_ WERE AS IT FEELS LIKE SHARP SHOOTING PAIN.,I WAS ON ORTHO EVRA PATCH FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.  I GOT TIRED OF WEARING THE PATCH BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY SO MANY PLACES IT CAN BE PLACED.  SO I DECIDED TO TRY THE PILL.  I HATE THIS PILL_ I HAVE NOTICED AN EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN.  I AM A VERY ACTIVE PERSON AND MY EATING HABITS HAVE NOT CHANGED.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PILL AT ALL,F,33,3  months,12/20/2008,Mircette
160, 1, Birthcontroll,Hated it!  Never had acne problems and after I began taking this pill my acne was terrible!  I also gained about 7-9 pounds in about a two to three weeks.  The weight gain was mostly in my stomach_ hips_ thighs and butt.  I had no lifestyle change.  My work out stayed the same_ my eating habits were the same_ it had to be the pill.  I am still having a difficult time getting the weight off and it has been a few weeks.  I haven't gained anymore luckily.  I also became very blah and depressed and also experienced heart palpatations.  I would advise anyone not to take this pill.  I am back to condoms.,,F,27,24  days,12/9/2008,Mircette
161, 4, painful periods,In the beginning I did experience some depression and some weight gain.,While I do often have headaches (I don't know i this is the pill or because I suffer from migraines)_ in general I have been satisfied. I am no longer in such horrible pain and my periods only last a couple of days. I have been on the pill for almost four years_ and really have no tremendous complaints. I think it is important to remember that everyone will react to this medication differently and if you are really having a difficult time_ see your doctor. I did talk to mine about the depression and weight gain and she felt the hormone levels in Kariva are much too low to cause such drastic effects.,F,22,4  years,11/20/2008,Mircette
162, 1, Birth Control,Weight Gain_ Moodiness_ Depression_ Breast Tenderness,I've been on Mircette for a month and I've been dieting and working out 6 days a week to prepare for a vacation. Even with fewer calories and a dedicated work out routine I have gained a pound a week. I am also very depressed - so much so that I almost went  to my doctor to get on an antidepressant. I'm thankful that I read all of these reviews... Clearly its the pill that is creating all these changes. I'm done with it today! I think its about time the husband take care of business since we are not having any more kiddos!,F,30,1  months,11/18/2008,Mircette
163, 3, birth control,acne_ loss of appetite and increased energy first weeks,I used to get the occasional break out but after a few days of being on this pill I have been breaking out like crazy! I have been switching face washes and acne treatments when before I didn't even have to use face wash everyday! Besides for that I have stayed the same weight overall.  The first week or so I had almost no appetite and would just force myself to eat_ I also would feel an increase in energy for a few hours after taking the pill... I'm in week 3 now and that's gone. Hoping the acne chills out and no other side effects occur.,F,20,3  weeks,11/15/2008,Mircette
164, 1, pregnancy prevention_ acne,THIS BIRTH CONTROL IS TERRIBLE! I took it for 3 months and had awful side effects from day one. I already had pretty severe acne_ and this made it unbearable. My acne became painful and much more intense around my chin area. I gained about 10 pounds in the 3 months I was on it. Also_ For the first month it made me sick almost every morning. I woke up several times throwing up and had nausea sometimes all day. My breasts got very tender starting with the first week_ and eventually I had to stop wearing a bra because it hurt so bad.,I know medicines effect people differently_ but if there is another option_ I would recommend taking it. Mircette did not work for me.,F,20,3  months,11/11/2008,Mircette

PMS symptoms much worse than before - confusion_ achy back_ nausea_ migraines_ etc. Full on period every two weeks WITH all the horrible symptoms except heavy bleeding. Very light bleeding.,I was happy with Mircette for a long time_ but it seems like the longer I stay on it the worse it gets and the more inconsistent.  Has so far prevented pregnancy_ but everything else about it is getting TERRIBLE.,F,32,1  years,11/7/2008,Mircette

168, 3, Birth Control,I have been on Mircette for a while and felt fine except for menstrual migraines.  The migraines have now become more frequent and I am developing more PMS and other health issues while on it.  I have decided to go off the pill and will be getting bloodwork to check all my hormone levels.  Not sure if I am going through pre-menopause but the longer I've been on Mircette the worse it has become for me.,,F,38,10  years,10/31/2008,Mircette

Last night i woke up at 2am and i was ""ready for the day"". Got up and cleaned house til about 4am then went back to sleep. Hope this will fix itself over time.",Having some mood swings_ but not sure if it is because of the Kavira 28 or because of  pre-menopausal symptoms.

171, 1, regulate period,diarrhea_ stomach cramps_ spotting_ mood swings_ fatigue_ acne_ loss of libido,I haven't been on any birth control for almost 8 years (husband has vasectomy). My periods are really irregular and heavy. I tried Kariva for one week and it was horrible. I didn't feel like myself at all. I'm healthy_ active and don't take any medications. This one really hit me hard and I decided it was not worth it. I've been off it for two days and still experiencing mild side effects. I would not recommend this to anyone.,F,33,7  days,10/15/2008,Mircette
172, 2, regulate periods/birth control,I had weight gain and really severe migraine headaches that got worse over time.,I had gone to the dr. for migraines and there was no mention of stopping birth control pills_ but after reading this_ I am going to try it. I get really bad migraines and I am not sure if it is related or not_ but it seems according to what I read at least possible. Also_ I have had no energy and gained weight. I could never lose the weight. I am going to try being off the pill and see what happens. I never thought about these things_ but I started to gain weight as soon as I started this pill. I hope this gets rid of the migraines!!!,F,35,5  years,10/13/2008Email,Mircette
173, 3, Endometriosis,Appetite loss,I lost my appetite_ but I wouldn't consider that a bad thing. It also cleared up my acne and it changed where I gain weight. I gain in my chest now instead of in my stomach_ which is kind of nice. That seems to be a permanent change_ since I haven't taken it in 5 years. On the other hand_ the main reason I was taking Mircette was for my severe cycles and my endomeriosis. It lessened the severity of my cycles_ but didn't slow the growth of the endomeriosis nor the rate at which it was growing. I would use Mircette if I didn't have endomeriosis. It did well for me except for the reason why I was taking it.,F,23,6  months,10/7/2008,Mircette
174, 1, CYST,MAJOR WEIGHT GAIN 15lbs IN ONE MONTH ...Lost of sex drive_ very depress_ sugar became very low_ the worst mood swing something like multipersonality. What I really hate the most about this pill is the weight gain. I am a workout and nutrition freak. I weight train 3 days a week_ teach 2 hours of spinning class 4 days a week_ and run 3 miles 5 days a week. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that I burn more calories that I consume. And I gain 15 lbs. ;-(P.S- My previous weight was 135 and I' 5'8,I HATE THIS PILL. IT'S THE WORST. ,F,25,1  weeks,10/4/2008,Mircette

177, 3, pregnancy prevention_ acne_ cramps,Worse acne (even on neck and back!)_ little bumps all over my face (especially along the jawline)_ weight gain_ bloating_ headaches,Like other entries I've read_ I started taking Mircette hoping it would clear up my skin...and it is only worse now.  Also_ I have gained 5 pounds (of pudginess) and feel bloated and disgusting even though I eat healthy and exercise at least 5 days a week.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  The only positive thing is that my period was not as heavy and I had very little cramping.,F,28,5  weeks,9/5/2008,Mircette

I am taking Mircette. It is taking a while to get out of my system and i hate it! This pill made me feel like i was dying. Doc said it wouldnt give diareah but he must have been wrong. I am not the only one who it has given flu-like symptoms to (as commented before me),F,19,10  days,8/31/2008,Mircette
179, 2, ,Positives: increased cup size_ cleared acneNegatives: Extreme fatigue_ lethargy_ intense spotting and discharge,I had ony been taking Mircette for two weeks but since then I have had intense spotting and discharge. It got to the point where I felt so disgusting I didn't want to have sex anyway_ so my decrease in libido was no big issue. I was also tired constantly and could barely stay awake to work.,F,20,2  weeks,8/2/2008,Mircette
180, 3, heavy painful periods due to fibroi,migraines nearly everyday; more acne than usual around chin area; loss of sex drive.,The good thing about this drug is that it didn't make me gain weight_ unlike Ortho tricyclen.  And it also made my periods more tolerable.,F,37,4  months,7/23/2008,Mircette
181, 4, Ovarian cyst - had hysterectomy,With Mircette - (the bad) After one month I noticed some tenderness in my breast_ 3 pounds of weight gain_ swelling in abdomen and lower sex drive.(The good) - One cup size fuller in breast_ much less acne to where I can stop taking my acne medicine_ hair loss almost gone (I was noticing hair loss in the shower_ now I only loose about 5 - 10 strands)_ hair much fuller and healthier looking_ no increase in appetite. Kariva - Horrible pill - absolutely hated it.  I only take the original Mircette now.  After 3 days I had terrible breast tenderness_ big time stomach bloating_ 8 pounds of weight gain_ severe headaches_ hair loss_ acne worse_ terrible mood swings and no sex drive.   I had to stop this pill after 9 days.  Two weeks later the weight came off (after peeing a lot)_ hair loss stopped and acne went away.,Mircette is a beautiful birth control pill. If it controls my ovarian cyst I will give it a 5 rating_ but I have only been on it for a month.  I have taken Yaz_ Ortho Tri low and regular_ Alysse_ and Kariva.  I had very bad side effects to all of these_ but not on the brand name Mircette.  Even though Kariva is the generic for Mircette it did not work at all for me and now I request only Mircette.  I can not rate this as far as pregnancy protection since I had a hysterectomy_ but I still have my ovaries.  As far as the stomach bloating_ I am not sure if it is from the pill or my cyst (I have one about 5 cm round).  The doctor said that being on the pill will shut down the ovaries and thus stop them from producing cysts.,F,37,30  days,7/5/2008,Mircette

I'm also feeling tightening in my chest_ which has never happened to me before. No skin improvement_ but it's still early.,"This is the first time I've ever been on birth control. When I first read all the harsh comments on this board_ I thought they couldn't all be true. But now I'm convinced that they're real. My OBGYN said the usual ""during the first three months_ your body is just adjusting."" I am going to stick with it for another month or two_ but remain skeptical.",F,23,13  days,6/8/2008,Mircette
185, 5, Severe cramps with period,Low libido_ thinning hair,My periods now are almost cramp-free and very light. I used to take Vicodin just to take the edge off of the cramps. I have noticed my hair seems thinner_ I thought it was age. I don't know if this is from the Mircette_ but I had the most severe night sweat the other night. Everything was drenched.,F,46,5  years,6/7/2008,Mircette

187, 3, ACNE/ baby prevention,Mild Headaches_ and I just start getting allergic to the sun/ itchy skin.,I'm on the generic brand and I actually love it. I have been thinking about going off of it_ but the good really does out way the bad. I was on Yaz but had HORRIBLE migrains. And every since I have been on Kariva I have only had mild headaches_ if at all. The only thing that really bugs me is that whenever I go out into the sun for a long amount of time_ or even just a few hours (I live in southern california) I get these bumps on my arms and cheast and they itch and get red. And they leave scars if you scratch them! Other than that_ I think that I can deal with the headahces and the sun thing... but if my libido goes... GOODBYE pill! haha,F,20,3.5  months,6/3/2008,Mircette
188, 3, Birth Control,Loss of sex drive.,I am so glad to read this website.  I started taking Mircette a month before I got married.  I have found_ however_ that I now have absolutely no sex drive whatsoever.  It has caused some very difficult and awkward conversations in our first couple months as newly weds.  I am glad to know that this could be a result of this pill and will definitely ask my doctor!  Thanks,F,28,60  days,6/2/2008,Mircette

Raised blood pressure.,My doctor took me off of Mircette because it seems to be adversely affecting my blood pressure.  If I had a choice I would go back to Lo-Ovral 28_ which I used in the past without all of these side effects.,F,45,3  months,5/28/2008,Mircette

191, 2, Pregnancy Prevention,Night sweats and hot flashes_ extreme mood swings_ acne,I can't say I wouldn't recommend this pill because all pills work differently for every woman.  This one did not work for me.  My appetite decreased (not a bad thing)_ I had horrible night sweats and daytime hot flashes the week before my period_ my libido is NON EXISTENT and I've gotten large_ painful pimples that last forever.  My actual period lasts about 2 days_ but that's surrounded by over a week of what I'd consider brown discharge_ so I still have to wear a liner/pad which is annoying.  I'm going back to OrthoTriCyclen.,F,32,5  months,5/23/2008,Mircette
192, 1, Doctor gave it to me,Itching_ Bitching_ no sex drive_ abdominal pain_ and very tired.,I hate this bc! All of a sudden I became extreemly tired. Almost immediately after taking a pill I started itching uncontrolably_ and I seemes to have an attitude all the time. I then lost all interest in sex and had occasional abdominal pain. The doctors office told me to continue taking the pills_ however I did not. I haven't taken it for almost 3 weeks now_ and I still suffer from the side effects.,F,22,9  days,5/21/2008Email,Mircette

I did feel calmer on this and would have liked to stay on it_ but the migraines were so terrible that they would have me barfing chunks! And I felt so weak_ like I couldn't move my muscles! I stayed on the couch most of the time and went to bed early because I couldn't function with the blinding migraines. Too bad. I also tried the mini pill and that was hell. No migraine_ but boy_ was I a total witch! Everything upset me!,,F,34,3  months,4/30/2008,Mircette
195, 4, Pregnancy preventative,increased discharge_ frequent spotting_ no libido,This was the only birth control pill that didn't cause me to gain weight or affect my disposition. My only complaint is that it recently has been pinpointed as the cause of my missing libido. It had no effect on me until the last few months. I'm considering taking a long break from it because I'm too young to feel this indifferent about sex! Other than that_ my experience has been positive.,F,25,3  years,4/29/2008,Mircette

I've been on it 2 months and have totally lost my sex drive - TOTALLY!  Breasts hurt about two weeks before my cycle.  The first cycle lasted 13 days.  This one is heading into 4th day - used to be 3 days max.  I've been on numerous bcp for 20 years and this is the absolute worst one.

202, 1, Birth control,Depression_ complete loss of sex drive,I have been on birth control pills for the better part of 15 years and never have I had an experience like this. This pill sent me into a downward spiral.  I was sad and crying all the time and COMPLETELY lost my sex drive. To be honest_ I don't feel like it ever properly returned after I stopped taking that pill_ but I can't say for sure that the long term effects were a cause of the pill.  This pill just had a horrible effect on me.,F,32,6  months,4/10/2008,Mircette

I hate taking birth control because of the side effects and such_ but my acne was getting horrible and leaving scars on my face.  My sister had taken Mircette in the past_ and it helped her skin_ so I asked my docter to prescribe it for me.  I have been taking it for almost 3 months now and my skin as completely cleared up (unfortunately the scarring has not) - On the other hand_ I have had no sex drive and have been extremely itchy AND bitchy!  I go through horrible bouts of depression and anger and my poor boyfriend is suffering.  The worst part for me is the weight gain.  I have gained nearly 10 pounds in the last month of so and all I eat is fruits/veggies and exercise as much as possible.  I should NOT be gaining weight.  And it is accumulating on my thighs_ butt_ & belly.  My belly is usually flat and the last place to gain any weight.I really want to find something else or go off,F,22,3  months,3/23/2008,Mircette
206, 5, Preventing Pregnancy,,"*** PLEASE READ ***I was just prescribed to Mircette by my doctor_ and she enlightened me on something. Many women on birth control should also take 50mg of vitamin b6 each day because it gives back many of the important things that birth control takes out. Lack of b6 can cause depression_ loss of sleep_ acne_ dry skin_ hair loss_ water retention_ irritability_ protein/carbohydrate/fat metabolism_ lack of red blood cell production_ increased stress_ mood swings_ etc. She told me b6 is recommended for any woman taking oral contraceptives. It has been called the ""Woman's Vitamin"" because of the exceptional benefits. She also continuously stated that more than 50 mg should not be taken. I would suggest this. Maybe its not the birth control_ it could be what the birth control is taking out of your body that you need restored. Hope this helps!!",F,23, ,3/19/2008,Mircette

208, 2, Birth Control,Nausea and extreme fatigue for the first week (similar to first trimester of pregnancy) and heavy breakthrough bleeding second week that never dissipated.,I started taking this pill after having been on Triphasil-28 for 7 years following my first pregnancy. My doctor felt that this was a low-dose pill with few side effects. I expected some time to adjust_ however_ during the first week I felt like I was pregnant again (so much that I actually took a pregnancy test). I also started on the 1st day or my period and it completely stopped my period in its tracks. The second week_ I had breakthrough bleeding that has not subsided. I did not have any side effects with the Triphasil-28 and have never experienced any major reaction to hormonal changes (PMS_ pregnancy_ etc.). My doctor is switching me to Loestrin 1.0. Hopefully that is better. Aside from that_ no other side effects were noted.,F,27,2  weeks,3/17/2008,Mircette
209, 4, Prevent Pregnancy,Headache_ mild moodiness.,Just went back on the pill after 3 years_ about 2 weeks ago.  Noticed very painful headaches for a few days in the 2nd week (if you just lay down it goes away) but no other side effects that I can tell. So far my skin has cleared_ I have maintained a stable weight and noticed my 1st period was shorter and lighter with no cramps_ usually 5 days and it was barely 4 days!,F,,2  weeks,3/9/2008,Mircette
210, 2, Endometriosis_ Conceptration(sp?),Depression_ Major decrease in libido_ slight nausea.,I know I am fairly young_ but I would not recommend this. Since I've been on Mircette_ I've been almost serverly depressed. I haven't been myself at all. Also_ as using this as a way to NOT get pregnant_ I have had at least no urge to make love. This pill is not great.,F,14,3  weeks,3/7/2008,Mircette

I had been on Ortho tri cyclen and the mood swings were horrible_ as others have mentioned_ then tried the depo shot and that didn't help. When I was first taking Kariva_ I was fine_ went off and had my first baby_ went back on and sex was still great.  Went off again and had my second baby...didn't go back on because I was having my tubes done.  I had to go back on a year later because I had not been regular...AGAIN! ( I've been irregular since I was 16 ).  Since being back on_ I get irratable and yell at my kids for the stupidest things that they do; fight with my husband of 7 years over dumb things like the sky is not blue_ it's brown and my emotions are 'iffy'  LOL..I feel like a crazy person and feel alone about this.  I'm tired of saying maybe its my bc_ but I thought it may have came out by now_ after 6 years on and off. I have to make another appointment for my yearly_ so I may just talk to the doctor and see what she says!,F,28,6  years,3/3/2008,Mircette

Increased breast size and tenderness_ constant bleeding/spotting the first month (at least)_ irritability_ slight cramping_ varied appetite_ sleepiness_ sleeplessness_ pain in legs.,"I took Mircette about 2 years ago for 6 months or so.  I didn't notice any major changes except maybe in my mood_ but that could have been unrelated. I stopped taking it because I didn't need it for that reason anymore.I just started taking Kariva (""equivalent"") and I have not stopped bleeding since the last day of my period and its been 3 weeks.  I also have gained 3 lbs and I believe its in my breasts.And I have felt like my legs are sore as if I'd been walking for hours when I haven't.

Over the past year_ I have notice significant weight gain_ acne_ and loss of libido.  About three weeks ago_ cramping started.

218, 1, Birth Control,Nausea_ diarrhea_ weakness_ abdominal pain_ EXTREME weight loss_ loss of appetite_ depression_ constantly tired_ acne.,This birth control has been nothing but trouble for me the past 4 months. Since I have been on this I have felt like I've been dying. I have dropped 15 pounds and look like a sickly anarexic. I am constantly sleeping and never feel well. Everytime my stomachs upset I have diarrhea and feel like vomiting at the same time. I get hot and sweaty and instantly need to lay down. I never connected these bizzare symptoms I've been experiencing with a birth control medicine. I cannot wait until this crazy medicine is out of my body so I can feel alive! Be careful when taking Mircette..If you experience these symptoms get off the pill as soon as possible! I hope this helps some people because this literally has ruined the last 4 months of my life!!,F,19,4  months,2/5/2008,Mircette
219, 4, ovarian cysts,Unfortunately I have been on every pill out there.  It seems that Mircette works the best for me.  I think it depends on your body and any other medications you are taking at that time.  As for depression and a lower sex drive_ I would agree with not wanting sex as much.  FYI yoga helps cure it!,,F,25,4  months,1/25/2008,Mircette

221, 4, Birth Control,For the first 2 weeks intense stomach pain about 30 mins after taking each pill_ but that went away.  About 1 year went by with no side effects_ then my sex drive almost completely left me and I started to have heart palpitations and chest pains with pain on the left side of my body.  I saw several heart and cardiologists and they determined it was the Mircette causing the pain. Since I've stopped taking it the pain is almost gone competely.  I've been off of Mircette for 5 months now.,I loved this birth control until the heart pains came.  I had shorter lighter virtually pain free periods.  I just couldn't stand the thought of what it was doing to my heart.,F,24,2  years,1/7/2008,Mircette

I have been on 3 other birth control pills and no this one is not the worse one_ but it does come close.  I am going to ride it out for the rest of the month.  Trying to decide if I should keep giving this pill a chance_ go back to the old pill_ or just go off all together (not recommended by my gyn).,F,23,2.5  weeks,1/5/2008,Mircette

I have not gotten a period after a month of discontinued pill. I am getting a sex drive back after only a few weeks off the pill.  MAIN CONCERN: is that my vaginal walls (or area) have been very crampy and sore . . . and I'm not menstruating or pregnant.

I started noticing_ less than a week into it_ that I wasn't in the mood any more. My one year anniversary was that week and I just flat out didn't want to have sex (I've never had a problem with that). My face has small red bumps all over it now_ before this pill I had extremely clear skin_ I've never had a problem with acne. I am also having issues with mood swings. One minute I will be happy_ the next I will be angry and want to cry. My husband has also noticed this. I am also depressed which is not normal for me because I have always been a happy/energetic type person. After reading all of these comments I am going off of the pill. I've only been married for a year and this pill is just not worth the problems with sex drive and mood swings/depression. I'd rather not put my husband through all ofthat_ let alone myself.,F,21,3  days,12/26/2007,Mircette
226, 1, Shorten Periods_ acne,Mircette worked wonderfully for me for 8 months. I did get frequent yeast infections but I used homeopathic remedies to keep them under control I started getting severe headaches and was told to immediately stop taking Mircette. I did and my estrogen levels crashed. I have been on 2 different anti-anxiety medications_ lost 8 pounds(bad thing)_ and am trying out anti-depressants.

I have experienced them in the past_ but NEVER this bad and all day long!  they stated back up when I started the pills 2 months ago_ so I have stopped the pills to see if this has caused the heart palpatations.  I do have an appt with a heart doc just to check things out!.,I started taking Karvia for heavy bleeding_ which has gotten worse in the past 2 years and also bad cramps in addition to siatic nerve pain during the 2 heavy days of my period.  Just 2 months of Karvia has cleared all this up....no stomach aches during ovulation_ no bad cramps_ much lighter periods...I feel back to the way I was about 2 years ago_ except for now I am having heart palpatations!  Anybody had this experience before? Nothing in my life has changed except for the pills.  I really want to continue using_ but the heart palpatations are worse than the cramps and bleeding!,F,42,2  months,12/6/2007Email,Mircette
228, 3, Birth Control,Started taking it and within about a week and a half had intense stomach pains_ like period cramps only in my actual stomach_ dr. said it was unrelated but i dont know if thats true_ extremely tired_ bloated_ moody.,I mean_ I heard good things about this pill_ but I just feel so tired and naseous and week on it. It's been about 3 weeks_ granted_ but meh_ It's my first pill and I have no idea what I'm doing. I'd rather just use a condom.,F,18,3.5  weeks,12/3/2007,Mircette
229, 3, birth control/period regulation,weight gain_ significantly lowered libido_ itchy skin all over_ shorter periods_ depression_ mood swings. Has anyone else experienced  dry_ itchy skin? I had more significant weight gain with my last pill_ and the mood swings were worse. I thought mircette was a godsend because I lost a few pounds and had a three-day period--until I read this and realized what a negative impact it has probably had on my life.,I thought I was crazy until I read these posts. For the past few months I have noticed a significant decrease in my sex drive_ plus weight gain (especially around the middle)_ and emotional instability. I couldn't understand why I don't EVER want to have sex with my awesome and loving bf_ and now I do!! I'm getting off this pill today. I hate the idea of putting these chemicals in my body everyday_ but the alternatives are not much better when you're in a serious relationship. Plus my periods are all over the map without the pill. Any recommendations?,F,28,10  months,11/9/2007,Mircette
230, 4, acne,for the first 6 months i had zero side effects. it cleared my acne the first month on it_ so i thought it was my miracle pill!! however_ i have been on it almost 2 years now_ and noticed my sex drive has plumeted_ and i put on alot of fat in my thigh/hip/glutes are that will NOT come off with diet or exercise. the only thing I still like about the pill is my clear skin_ but Im going off Mircette next month hoping my acne wont come back with a vengance.,its a fantastic pill for acne sufferers. however_ it did cause weight gain and lack of libido. My period always hung around for atleast a week_ and i didnt find much relief with my cramps either.,F,24,2  years,11/4/2007,Mircette

I basically felt like had a very bad flu for a whole month.  I hated this medication and I will NEVER take it again!,I was taking Mircette and not the generic eqivalent_ but that did not seem to matter.  This pill was just aweful.

Arose from a blood clot originating in my leg (deep vein thrombosis) that traveled to my lungs - I was hospitalized for 3 days and now have to take blood thinning medication (Warfarin) indefinitely to prevent recurrence.  I'm extremely lucky it didn't kill me.  Mircette is the only thing that could have caused it in my case.,Avoid desogestrel-based pills.  These type of pills are associated with a drastically-increased risk of the type of blood clots I got.  I didn't know this before I starting taking them.  I was on various other types of BCPs for more than 12 years prior to taking Mircette without clotting and within two years of being on Mircette I was in the hospital_ near death.

233, 1, Birth control,Loss of sex drive_ frequent yeast infections_ moodiness and depression_ breast tenderness before period_ fatigue and exhaustion.,This is the worst BC pill I have ever been on.  I have tried quite a variety over the last 8 years and have never experienced horrible side effects as I have over the last 6 months being on Kariva (Mircette).  My sex drive took a steep dive over the first couple months_ which has never been a problem before.  I have had yeast infection after yeast infection (every couple of weeks despite perscription creams and pills from my gyno). I have frequent headaches and breast tenderness before my period. I am exhausted almost all the time_ and find myself needing daily naps (I am 25 and healthy otherwise).  I have always been a very upbeat and happy person overall_ but now have severe mood swings_ becoming very sad and weepy over tiny little things.  Though exhausted during the day_ I have trouble falling and staying asleep at night.  I thought I was depressed_ but after reading similar side effects from others on this pill_ I know this is the problem.  I'm getting Paragard put in this Tues so,F,25,6  months,10/14/2007Email,Mircette

(that diet and exercise will not shed)_ frequent yeast infections.,I was taking Kariva. I wanted to go on BC because my boyfriend has a latex allergy. It was great for a bit_ we could have sex spontaneously. But after two years my sex drive is completely gone_ and even when I'm in the mood mentally_ I find it impossible to become physically aroused. I was hesitant to stop taking the pill for so long simply because of a lack of other non-hormonal_ latex-free options_ but now I intend to go au naturale and try the Fertility Awareness Method. I went off about a week ago and already I feel much more energetic and feel my libido is starting to come back. It was easy and convenient to take a pill_ but not worth the emotional and physical trauma.,F,23,2  years,9/24/2007,Mircette
238, 5, contraceptive/irregular periods,none,Great drug! I was diagnosed with PCOS over 5 years ago and began taking Mircette to regulate my period. I was also told by my doctor in order to conceive I should lose weight. I started taking the diet pill Meridia along with Mircette and lost 50 pounds in a little over 6 months. Shorlty after the weight loss I stopped taking Mircette and became pregnant. After the birth of my son my period became irregular again so I continued taking Mircette.,F,27,28  days,9/17/2007,Mircette

We dated for a couple months before I got on it and had great sex...now I don't ever want it_ except when I'm on the week of the sugar pills (during my period). I've thought I've been really depressed for a long time and thought it might be the bc_ but instead related to events going on_ but after reading this site_ I am convinced it is the bc.

The generic did not work for me--I tried it one month when my pharmacy was out of the brand name and it made me psycho-emotional and I gained 7 pounds that month.  Very expensive if your insurance does not cover it.,F,27,8  years,8/15/2007,Mircette
241, 3, contraception,weight gain_ bloating_ severe mood swings_ spotting,Like a lot of the comments below_ my first two months were great.  I switched from Loestrin to control my menstrual headaches_ and Mircette seemed to do the job.  I had a kidney infection six weeks ago--never stopped taking Mircette--but since then I've been bloated_ I gained 5 pounds (with no lifestyle switch)_ and I've been spotting.  For six weeks.  Side effects seem to come on late with this one.,F,28,6  months,8/15/2007,Mircette

I switched to Microgestin_ a generic version. I now get nauseous and vomit only after the first ""active"" pill in a new pill pack.

243, 1, pregnancy prevention,Horrible mood swings_ depression_ anger_ spotting_ nonexistent libido,I've only been on Kariva for a little over a week after switching from another brand and I couldn't figure out what was going on with my horrible mood swings.  I still have no sex drive_ contrary to my husband's_ and can't stand the lashing out one minute and then to have the urge to cry the next minute.  I've never liked people who are drama queens_ and I feel like I'm turning into one!  I'm a healthy and fit 32 year old and have been married for a little over a year_ so I don't need a strain on my relationship because I don't have a sex drive and for my husband to deal with my drama.  NOT WORTH IT!  I only wish that doctors would inform people about these side effects_ as I had not been aware of the loss of libido part as a risk that was never stated in the pamphlet that comes with the pill.,F,32,9  days,8/7/2007,Mircette

My skin was great and I experience no side effects. My husband left last January on a deployment for 8 months so I decided to stop taking it for a while and get back on right before he came back. Biggest mistake ever! My first month's period off the pill was so bad that I immediately went back on it. Although I had really great experiences with it before it is now driving me crazy. I have been back on it for 5 months and just now realizing what might be causing all of my acne and depressive tendencies. For the past 4 months I have also been getting my period from one week to two weeks in advance leaving me with 3 week long cycles. I do recommend this pill to people_ however_ do not get off it unless you want to get pregnant. It'll totally screw everything up.,F,22,4  years,7/22/2007,Mircette

I won't go off as many people have on some of these boards that bc pills are the 'devil' however - in my experience the thing i did NOT like about Kariva was the weight gain.  3 years ago I lost 60 pounds and completely changed my lifetstyle.  I gained back 10 on my own and maintained that weight for 2 years.  Last October I started Kariva and I've GAINED 27 pounds since then.  I have NOT changed my diet - except for the good - such as I do NOT drink pop anymore_ I work out 3 times a week_ I walk 30 minutes during my break at lunch at work_ I don't eat that much junk food_ and my bf and I always eat whole grains_ low fat foods at home.  Yet i've GAINED 27 pounds in 9 months.  I finally realized what it MIGHT be because the other side effects I've had on this pill:usually - RIGHT BEFORE my period I'm EXTREMELY emotional and moody (never have been before).

I told my doctor_ and they gave me Mircette (I now take the generic_ Kariva)_ and it's been great.  Despite the occasional headache and breast tenderness (which is no big deal) I really am happy with it. My skin is great compared to how it usually is_ with the occasional big zit pre-period_ and after 5 months of taking it_ I rarely break out.

My mood swings were so severe that I would go from feeling extreme depression to feeling neutral to becoming screaming violently angry.  and then the uncontrollable crying episodes started.  My boyfriend was so concerned about me that he wouldn't leave the house (even though he was being yelled at!) because he thought I might hurt myself.  This drug might work for others_ but it definitely did not work for me.

260, 5, Birth Control,,I have been very satisfied with Mircette.  I purchase ONLY the brand and never generic.  This has been a great pill.  I am also wondering if this also has an appetite suppresant in it.  While on this pill my eating impulses were controlled tremendously.  While off for a period of time I did not have any problems with my cycle regulating itself where as on other birth controll pills I stopped ovulating all together after going off.  I also have fibercystic breasts and I have not had an increase in breast masses or tenderness on this pill.  This has been a great pill for me.,F,35,2  years,4/23/2007,Mircette
261, 4, Birth Control,very heavy bleeding during the first month,I just started taking Mircette a month ago. Iv'e heard it is a great pill so I am going to try it for a few months. So far I feel ok_ acne is usual_ cramps are usual_ etc. but during the first two nights of my peroid I bleed more than usual.,F,19,1  months,4/19/2007,Mircette
262, 3, Birth control,,I started taking it for cramps and heavy periods. First 2-3 years did what it was suppose to. I even gained 2 cup sizes in my breasts (great thing!)_ but now I'm always depressed (always was a happy person)_ starting to break out again_ angry all the time_ NO sex drive_ and gained almost 50lbs. I'm probably switching brands this fall.,F,24,4  years,4/16/2007,Mircette
263, 2, To get a regualar period cycle,TERRIBLE mood swings_ depression_ 17 lb weight gain_ severe soreness around my stomach during my period_ and loss of sexual drive.,Ive been on Mircette/Kariva for about 2 years_ and Ive just recently started to realize it was causing most of my day-to-day problems. Ive been depressed a lot and had HORRIBLE mood swings(Im sure my boyfriend hates me)! I have not switched yet_ but I am making my appointment with my doctor VERY SOON and getting it switched! I do not recommend this.,F,20,2  years,4/16/2007,Mircette

266, 3, PMDD & BC,Originally - none.  Within the past three cycles - breakthrough bleeding_ bloating_ moodiness_ pimples,"I was put on Mircette (I've always used Kariva_ the generic) after a failed attempt to control PMDD through Zoloft_ which made me a walking zombie.  Kariva worked like a charm - I wasn't suffering the extreme mood swings_ I was feeling less bloated_ etc.  I was thrilled.  In December '06_ I ended up with a nasty virus that lasted over three weeks.  From the stress my body was under_ it triggered BTB_ and since then_ I've been totally out of whack.  Jan._ Feb._ and Mar.'s periods have lasted between 5 - 7 days_ which has NEVER happened to me on Kariva (usually_ 2 - 3).  I've also had BTB starting between 36 and 72 hours prior to my first placebo pill for Feb. and Mar.'s cycles.  Bloating has been ridiculous_ I've gained a few pounds_ and my skin's gone crazy_ and I've NEVER had ""bad"" skin.  I'm heading to either Desogen_ for the higher estrogen level_ or NuvaRing_ but I'm still bummed that this has stopped working. :(",F,22,2.5  years,3/18/2007,Mircette

I must say the first 6 years went great! No problems at all...The past year I have had migrane headaches_ insane breast tenderness_ horrible nausea_ and NO sex drive at all. It really has made an impact  on my relationship. I recently decided to d/c the use of the pill to see what would happen. I must say I have had no headaches or nausea and my sex drive is back.

272, 2, to regulate cycles_ contraception,"I tried it twice in my life_ twice_ the same thing. Why did I try it the second time? Cos I didn't realize that the first time the symptoms I had were caused by it.All fine for 10 months.Then depression getting worse and worse every month I wanted to destroy my life and everything was awful_ PMS alltrough the month_ accompanied with terrible menstrual cramps_ serious bloating_ heartburn. I had to get a stomache endoscopy_ my GI thought I had an ulcer. The results were ""chronic inflammation"". Maybe candidiasis too? Guess what is the cause of all this? So I stopped it and it's slowly getting back to normal... When is this crap gonna get out of me???","Any birth control pill is awful anyway. Mircette has LATE side effects but it seems they take a much longer time to go away too even after you stop it.To all the women out there: when you take the pill_ don't listen to only your GYN say ""no heart beat_ clots_ ect....""_ that's not the only side effects the pill can have on your body. It throws you way off_ and those side effects have such a bad bad effect on your everyday life you could lose your job_ a boyfriend or your husband cos of it.",F,27,10  months,2/22/2007,Mircette

No desire to have sex_ breasts tender and swollen. Decided to give it a try and it's not for me. Back to condoms.,,F,46,7  days,2/13/2007,Mircette
276, 4, Birth Control,Terrible mood swings but they are becoming easier to deal with_ nightmares_ although not sure if mircette is causing them,I tried 2 other methods of bc and both severely interacted with my migraines.  They produced very intense migraines_ I was unable to move or do anything.  My doctor prescribed Mircette and at first I was skeptical_ but I've not had one headache while I've been on it.  :-),F,20,1  months,2/12/2007,Mircette

279, 5, Birth Control,For the first month to a month and a half you may experience depression_ increased anxiety_ mood swings_ nausea_ headaches... but it WILL stop. You may continue to feel a little more tired than you usually had in the past. Increase in breast size. I've lost weight (stay off the carbs while taking it and you should have weight lose instead of gain),Any symptoms you experience at first Will MOST LIKELY stop. Hang in there. This is a GREAT pill_ it's just a bit hard for your body to adjust at first. Don't pull the plug on taking it_ you wont find a better pill out there.,F,21,1  years,2/2/2007,Mircette
280, 3, Contraception,LOSS OF LIBIDO,I thought this BCP was fantastic- no weight gain_ no acne_ no effect on my mood (that I was aware of) but it has slowly and completely eliminated my sex drive to the point where I feel basically asexual. Needless to say it has taken quite a toll on my relationship and I'm switching pills...,F,28,3  years,1/22/2007,Mircette
281, 1, Avoid Pregnancy,Severe depression.,I was actually on the generic Kariva. Lost weight_ which was good. However_ after two months on the drug I fell into SEVERE depression. Lots of anxiety. Lots of crying. Suicidal thoughts. This pill was really scary.,F,21,8  months,12/20/2006,Mircette
282, 4, birth control,headaches_ weight gain_ moodiness_ bloating,I've been on Mircette for about two years now.  so far it has been a great pill_ the only thing that really bothers me is probably the weight gain. i'm 5'1 and was originally 112 pounds before taking the pill_ and my weight has shot up to 130. really hate the bloating as well. :/,F,18,2  years,11/23/2006Email,Mircette

284, 5, Contraceptive,increase in breast sizeslightly lower sex drive_ but not really intolerableslight weight gain,I have been on this medication for a couple of years now. The slightly bad side effects are a slightly decrease in sex drive and slight weight gain. Other than this_ it's really not a big deal to me. The pros with taking this medication is that my cup size has increased two cups and my periods are very very light. It's great!,F,26,2  years,11/20/2006,Mircette
285, 5, Contraception,Spotting_ bigger breasts_ increased water retention during menstruation,This is a wonderful pill! I had depression with Ortho tri-cyclen and an all-over horrible experience with Yasmin. After taking Yasmin for one cycle and feeling every side effect possible_ this one is perfect. My breasts increased almost one cup size in the past 2 months!!!,F,31, ,11/18/2006,Mircette

287, 3, menstrual cramps,depression!_ irritability_ irregular appetite_ fatigue,i'm on the generic version_ kariva_ and i'm considering discontinuing it because i feel depressed and anxious all the time. i was generally a very happy person_ and it used to be very hard to get me down. it doesn't seem like i can have fun doing hardly anything. i'm so tired all the time_ and i'm always starving_ but become full very easily. Also_ as far as sex goes_ it seems as if i'm less sensitive than i was_ and less energetic and excited. my skin is clearer_ thought it's never been bad. my periods are much shorter and lighter_ and easier to deal with. it has worked to make my menstrual cramps pretty much non-existent_ but i'm starting to think that a couple of hours doubled over in pain every month was better than always feeling so down and exhausted.,F,17,4  months,11/18/2006Email,Mircette
288, 5, Birth Control,no negative side effects yet,I took Orthro Tri cyclen lo for a while and I got terrible head aches.  I've been on Mircette for 2 months now.  It's a whole new world!  I feel so much better.  I'm still not sure my sex drive is all it should be_ but I stay pretty stressed out with things in my life right now.  I like the medicine so much better than Orthro!,F,22,2  months,11/14/2006,Mircette
289, 1, birth control_ heavy cycle_ headach,i became depressed. i cried often and had much anxiety. at the beginning it was slight and gradually i became more depressed,fortunately because of a health problem_ my doctor switched my birth control_ but it wasn't until after I was off mircette that i really noticed my depression_ but i was sad all the time and once i switch my mood was back to normal and i felt happy again.,F,21,1  years,11/13/2006,Mircette
290, 5, Birth Control,now that I think about it... I was experiencing some anxiety and insomnia. and dryness,I tried Desogen for 2 days and I felt EXTREMELY sick so they switched me to Mircette. I loved it. My skin cleared up and I was glowing! My periods were 3 days long! But it all went down hill when I stopped taking it. I gained 10 pounds and my skin is back to bad.,F,20,1  years,10/30/2006,Mircette

This is great,F,17,3  months,10/27/2006,Mircette
292, 2, prevent pregnancy,I took the pill for four months.  I had heavy spotting for the first three months.  My doctor would not switch pills until I was on it for three months.  At the end of my four month I am now switching to a new pill.

295, 2, Birth Control,ZERO libido_ acne flair-ups_ out-of-control breakthrough bleeding.,When I first began Mircette five years ago_ I thought I found the perfect birth control.  No weight gain_ slight enlargement of the breasts (which for me was a good thing)_ few cramps.   Then I moved abroad for a few months and stopped taking it.  When I started again_ all hell broke loose.  I had absolutely NO libido (which is incredibly frustrating_ as I am a healthy 25 year old with a great boyfriend) and bled more days than not.  My skin totally changed and I started breaking out along my chin and jaw (a first for me).  I just switched to Loestrin--I am hoping this time around it will be a lot better.,F,25,5  years,10/13/2006,Mircette
296, 3, Prevention,none at first_ then when I started re-taking it: extreme tenderness in breasts_ weight gain - especially in breasts_ weight gain all around_ VERY moody with swings of depression.,I've been on birth control pills for a very long time (about 6 years total). I took Mircette for about two years_ and when I went off off them I lost weight_ it reduced my hunger_ etc. HOWEVER_ I thengot acne all over my face and back (I had never even so much had a pimple). Taking the pill for so long seriously screwed up my hormones. I started re-taking Mircette thinking it would solve the problem - but didn't. Now I have such large_ sore breasts that I wear a sports bra every day. I feel miserable about myself_ am very moody_ and depressed. I'm getting off of them_ acne or not!!! Worked well for pregnancy preventions...never had a problem. Extreme loss of libido due to the pill might have been the better prevention method...Heh.,F,22,2  years,10/8/2006,Mircette
297, 1, birth control,Gained 25 pounds_ constantly bloated_ depressed and anxious_ and made me extremely moody and angry. Dr. kept recommending that I wait to give my body time to adjust.

298, 5, Contraception,none really_ the placebo made me nautious_ so I stopped taking it.,Didn't gain any weight_ actually lost some when I went off it for a few months. Only complaint is itching when my doctor prescribed for multi-dose_ 4 packs for three months so I would only have my period quarterly. I just take it normally or multi dose for 2 months instead of three.,F,23,18  months,10/5/2006,Mircette
299, 5, contraception,some fatigue,I switched from Yasmin due to the increasing prices and I really like this low dose pill.

I thought I was having a stroke and stopped taking the pill that day. After talking to several doctors_ I'm pretty sure it was just a bad migraine_ though there is a slight increase in stroke risk with the pill. I can't say much about this pill as everyone reacts differently to it_ and nothing I say should make you decide whether its right for you or not. Just make sure you discuss all possible side-effects with your doctor before taking it so you don't freak out like I did.,F,19,15  days,8/24/2006,Mircette

Also I'm a little moody but that's going away and is less severe than other pills.  I've lost 3 pounds already.  no appetite.

All have their varying levels of side effects_ but I've never experienced more mood swings than when I've been on this pill.

314, 1, Birth Control,I felt sluggish and gained 15 pounds in 9 months.  Lack of sex drive and headaches. Best side effect was light_ short periods. The worst side effect was that I suddenly developed a purple swollen leg and found it was a huge blood clot!  I now have to take a blood thinner and injections twice a day.  I used to take other brands of birth control before having children 9 years ago.  I had only been on Kariva 9 months before developing a blood clot.,Doctors would like us to believe that the pill is safe for women over 40_ but I disagree.  I am a healthy_ normal weight_ non-smoking woman.  What other cause could there be??  My doctor has ruled out cancer.  If anyone else has experienced a blood clot they think is related to this pill_ I would like to hear from you.,F,44,9  months,7/17/2006Email,Mircette

I had a little light spotting for the first two months and a little anxiety but after that I was fabulous!,My periods used to be very crampy_ bloaty_ gassy and just uncomfortable.  With Mircette_ my periods are at most 4 days and at least 2 days_ they are like clockwork provided you take your pill religously.  I will get one cramp on the day that I am to start my period_ if you can call it a period and that's it.  No back pain_ only have a cramp or sometimes a few on the first day and that's it!  I tried Yasmin and it was not good!,F,27,3  years,7/14/2006,Mircette

317, 1, ,low to almost no sex drive_ excrucating pain during intercourse_ weight gain_ and migraines,I took mircette for 3 yrs and never realize that it was the pills that were causing all of these problems untill i quit taking them to get pregnant. Then all of a sudden i had this sex drive that came out of know where and the pain during intercourse went away a little at a time and the migraines deminished. I cant really say anthing about the weight gain after i quit taking them_ about 2 months after i quit taking the pill i got pregnant. So I strongly dont recomment taking this pill.

319, 4, Birth Control,No periodAcne,I've been on Mircette continuously (until a recent 6 month break) for over 7 years. 6 1/2 of those 7 years I went without a period. I had the same ob/gyn for 11 years and he insisted that it was o.k and to consider myself 'lucky'; so_ I did. I made the choice in Nov. 2005 to discontinue in order to find out if I could still have a normal period. Suprisingly I did and continued to do so until April 2006. In June I spotted and chose to again start my b/c. I now think I'm 'unlucky' because now in July and again taking Mircette_ I've had a period. And_ I've recently began to have really bad acne. This is very hard for me to adjust to being that I've always had a clear complection. I have spent a lot of money trying to rid this but it only seems to be migrating to my shoulders and chest_ leaving me with more decisions to make.,F,35,7  years,7/11/2006Email,Mircette
320, 3, to regulate periods,dramatic increase in breast size (2 whole cup sizes!)_ extreme moodiness_ depression_ weight gain,my doctor put me on kariva about a year ago because i hadnt gotten my period for 8 months.  several factors contributed to this irregularity_ such as my being underweight_ extremely stressed out_ and i had unbalanced hormone levels.  kariva regulated my periods perfectly_ but it made me gain a large amount of weight and increased my breast size dramatically.  it also caused me to be extremely moody and now i also have minor depression,F,18,1  years,7/10/2006,Mircette

I switched to Kariva (recommended by my OB-GYN doc).  In the first two or three months I would have multiple periods (really light)_ moodiness_ headaches_ and occasional spotting.  After 7 months_ I now have very light and regular periods_ slight headaches_ and small breakouts just before my period.  It cleared up my face overall and minimized the cramps but my sex drive seems to be really low in the middle of my cycle.  Overall though_ I am very pleased with this pill (partly because my prior experience with oral contraceptives was a nightmare!)...,F,25,7  months,7/3/2006,Mircette

Ocassional outlashing moodiness.,I dieted while on this pill and went to the gym often (cardio workouts with a calorie burn from 500 - 800 calories)_ however I would step on the scale and my weight would always go up instead of down. I have maintained a steady weight for 4+ years_ so I had to put two and two together...lots of cardio & less eating_ but on mircette...hmmm I think the culprit is mircette. I gained 5 pounds in 5 weeks_ that's pretty ridiculous. I also experienced some awful temple piercing headaches that would last for days_ I would go to bed with them and wake up with them. Also had some weird mood swings which included lashing out at people at work and crying over trivial things. My period was also heavier and more painful on mircette than it was on ortho tri-cyclen.,F,21,5  weeks,7/1/2006,Mircette

325, 5, Estrogen Withdrawl Headaches,No side affects_ no headaches_ minimal to no cramps. Initial few days I had a little nausea/upset stomach_ and felt some anxiety at bedtime_ may have been from the adjustment from taking Ortho-Tricyclene for 3.5 yrs straight and then switching to mircette.,"I went to a NEW Dr after almost 4 yrs of being on Ortho-Tricyclen and told her how sometimes I skip periods and go straight to the new pack_ because the 7-10 days straight of headaches during the period week is so unbareable that I can't stand it.  She suggested Mircette because she said I was experiencing Estrogen Withdrawl headaches.  I've only been on the pill for 1 month_ and the reason I came to the site was I was a little worried because I'm on my 6th day of the ""PERIOD"" week and I haven't spotted or had any bleeding/cramps AT ALL!! Usually_ I start the 3rd day and am quite heavy thru the 6th day and tapers off day 7-9 and then after being on the new pack of birth control 2-3 days it will stop.  At this point_ I'm very satisfied_ and my sex drive is back to normal (always been very high) the first week on mircette it was non-existant but that may have been because I was ending the other pills_ which caused a decrease in sex drive overall during the month and made it NON",F,29,4  weeks,6/23/2006Email,Mircette

Intercourse was painful and it got worse and worse over the three months I took this drug.  We tried using all kinds of lube_ foreplay_ etc._ but I still felt a lot of pain_ esp. after sex.

I am an educated_ outgoing person (normally) but since I have been taking this drug_ I feel that I am not myself.  I feel depressed_ anxious and fear that I am driving my loved ones away because I can no longer control my emotions.

I took it for a year and a half and discontinued taking it because of my depression. I would find myself crying about the dumbest things all the time. When i stopped taking it my moods drastically improved however i did not get a period for eight months and had to go back on mircette.

I was basically a horrible horrible witch for the two months I was on it_ cried all the time_ hated my body and myself and everyone around me_ and generally felt not myself.  After one week of not being on it_ I felt much more normal and myself again.

341, 4, To regulate my periods,I gained 4 lbs. in the first two weeks of using this pill.  I am an avid exerciser and dieter but the weight has not come off 4 months later.  This pill has helped me with PMS symptoms and pre-menstrual migraines.  My periods are very light but the week before I am due_ I have moderate cramping and a terrible backache that lasts for 1 1/2 weeks.  The only other side effect I have is a strange stomach ache that wakes me up in the middle of the night around mid-cycle.,"I am confused about the weight gain (I am only 5' 1"") and why I cannot lose the weight_ especially after dieting.

343, 5, to avoid pregnancy_ regulate period,Didn't really notice any side effects until recently. I start my period in a couple days but started spotting yesterday and a little today. It has gotten rid of my cramps almost entirely although my sex drive has been very low and I still break out every once in a while. These could also be from stress_ but am not sure.,Absolutely love it and wish I had started it a long time ago.

346, 4, More effective than condoms!,My acne cleared up a little at first_ then got a little worse_ and now is clearing up again.  I have continuous spotting_ but I have only been taking Mircette for a short time.  Other than that_ I feel nothing else.  My libido hasn't lowered...much to my husband's dismay.,I'm somewhat concerned about the spotting_ but only because it's a little inconvenient.  Apart from that_ I'm happy with it.  I take it at the exact same time every day_ give or take 15 minutes.  It helps to keep the hormone level in the blood steady.  I've been on several other forms of birth control medication and this is the best.  If you're thinking about what to take_ I would recommend Mircette.,F,26,1  months,3/28/2006,Mircette
347, 3, Birth Control,I have been on Mircette for 1 full month.  I am Tired all the time!!!  Before taking this pill I couldn't tell you the last time I had the need to go to bed at 9pm EVERY NIGHT!  Have been sad A LOT and I have never been so grumpy_ sad and just downright out of myself.,"Have gained approx 4-5pounds already but I know this is because I have continued to eat bad and not excercise as much.  I will say though that these pills (for a fact) have increased my appetite tremendously (I'm always hungry w/these things!) and I am not one for discipline (my weakness so this is my fault!)  I have had some break through bleeding which is expected early on.  I am very aware however that I will have these side affects no matter what ""birth control pill"" I am taking_ it's just part of the down side.  I so wish they could find more alternatives to the pill.  I would even do surgery as long as it guarenteed reversal when I was ready for children.  Heck_ how wonderful would it be not to have to take any birth-control and deal with the side effects.  I suppose infertility is scary to play around with so until further invention we are ""stuck"" with these pills.

Looking back it was a good pill as it did prevent unwanted pregancy and it got rid of my terrible cramps. However_ I have been experiencing moods swings and tremendous loss in libido and ability to orgasm which has affected me very much. I see that it could be this pill after reading your comments. My doctor suggested changing to Ortho Lo_ (not the generic)I will try.,F,30,10  years,3/2/2006,Mircette

No spotting or cramping_ just a bit a mild nausea the first couple weeks.Negatives:After couple months_ i noticed a loss of libido_ became very moody and felt overly emotional. Everything was 10-100x more intense feelings and didn't feel like myself. I became very depressed and it affected both private and work relationships because i felt like i had no control over my emotions.,I simply just stopped taking this pill. It majorly contributed to ruining the best relationship of my life and made me wonder who i was. Been off a year now and I finally feel happy again....but the cramping and acne are back. Wondering if i shouldn't try ortho lo and see if that works for me.....nothing is worth the mood swings....but at 27 i'm getting pretty tired of the painful acne and cramps. But mircette is such a low dose anyway_ that i'm wondering if anything else would work.,F,27,6  days,2/16/2006,Mircette

We decided it was the hormones and switched to Mircette.  Everything was grand for the first 4 mths.  light period_ no breakthrough.  but my sex drive plunged_ lubrication is non-existant_ and now i am back to the horrible bloating_ gas_ and pain.  nausea and weight gain started about a month ago- to the tune of 4lbs a week.  i work out 6 days a week and eat moderately well...  it may not be the Mircette_ but when i stop taking it everything goes normal.,F,29,1  years,2/13/2006,Mircette

I probably don't mind the breast enlargement_ but it's not worth it. Symptoms began a couple of weeks into taking the pill and have not decreased at all after 4 months.

The doctor ordered me to immediately stop taking it and come in.,i have seen noted elsewhere mircette (kariva) can induce sinus infections.  i did get sick with a sinus infection shortly after beginning the pill.  i'm not sure if it has anything to do with one another_ but it is an interesting concept.  this was the first type of birth control i've tried and i'm nervous about trying anything else.,F,21,10  days,12/9/2005Email,Mircette
372, 3, ovarian cysts,i havent noticed weight gain or acne probs_ but my breasts have gone up a half-cup size_ and i have done nothing for three days but cry uncontrollably.,i am asking to switch. i cant tolerate the mood swings. i am gonna get dumped for becoming crazy moody girl.,F,24,12  days,12/5/2005,Mircette
373, 2, Perimenopause,I started taking this for the perimenopausal symptoms(which are having periods that are lasting for 12 days_ extreme breast tenderness_ weight gain and premenstrual moodiness/crying). I have only been on this for one month but don't know if I can continue much longer to try to wait for side effects to subside. I have had the expected side effect of spotting and also: increased appetite_ nausea when I do eat_ gas/bloating_ insomnia (waking up wide awake after just a few hours of sleep)_horrible cramping/heavy flow with my first period on it_ a feeling of anxiety/the jittersthat comes and goes_ and a possible slight increase in daily hair loss. I also have not been sick in over 3 years but came down with the worst cold of my life. (The cold probably has nothing to do with hormones but I thought this was worth mentioning).,I am taking the generic version of Mircette. Perimenopause is no fun but this sure doesn't seem to be a quick fix.  I will post back only if I can continue through the end of a second pack and the majority of side effects I am experiencing go away.  Right now_ I expect to throw these pills away mid-cycle and search for something else to help with perimenopause.,F,42,31  days,12/5/2005,Mircette

376, 4, Birth control,Spotting between periods.,Tried Ortho-TriCyclin and gained about 15% of my total body weight.   I was hesitant to go on birth control again because of the weight gain but Mircette has turned out to be great.  I actually lost a small amount of weight.  The only problem is that I experience bleeding between periods--even though I've been taking it for 8 months.  I hope this will settle down in the next year.  I would recommend trying Mircette if you've experienced weight gain on other pills,F,25,8  months,11/29/2005,Mircette

379, 3, birth control_ painful periods,I experienced low grade depression and complete loss of libido.,I've had a lot of problem with birth control side effects. This pill didn't have any side effects at first_ and then I realized . . . not only did I not feel anything_ I didn't feel ANYTHING. I was completely unmotivated_ like I was living behind a wall. I have always had a very high sex drive_ and now I am repulsed by the idea of sexual activity. I don't love my partner any less . . . I just feel like a big old dry tree_ and you could probably count the rings and see how long it's been since I've had sex. I've got to go off this. It's like living in a cave.,F,26,1  months,11/17/2005,Mircette
380, 2, regulate periods- heavy bleeding,I have had severe insomnia since taking mircette.  Needed to take sleeping pills.  Constant mild headache. So tired_ yet can't sleep.  Paleness.Bright side-gave me the edge to break up with unsuitable boyfriend and turn down a second who would make my life miserable.,I probably could ride out two more months and see if side effects subside- but I am switching to Loestrin 1/20 fe to see what happens.,F,36,1  months,11/13/2005,Mircette
381, 3, birth control,Took 3 months to get over initial symptoms (tender breasts_ cramps).  Gradually_ my interest in sex waned_ and now I feel a near-complete loss of libido.  I call these my Abstinence Pills -- they work because I am NEVER in the mood anymore!,The one bad side effect of this pill is loss of libido.  I am thinking of switching pills_ but I browsed this forum and it sounds like every pill has some nasty side effect.  I had been on a higher-dose pill and hated it and switched to Mircette.  I didn't realize it'd gradually make me lose my libido_ though.,F,33,3  years,11/10/2005,Mircette
382, 2, Avoid Pregnancy,loss of libido_ very emotional_ became an evil monster and was always angry,I didn't really gain any weight_ my periods were very light and my cramps were too.  I don't know if I'm a crazy person now because I'm a newly wed or on this pill_ but I don't feel like myself and I hope it's attributed to the pill.  Every little thing makes me annoyed and I sometimes just want to cry for no reason.  I'm also more sensitive which I used to not be at all,F,23,7  months,11/1/2005,Mircette
383, 4, Birth Control,Mild moodiness during periods_ cramps,Have been on Mircette 4+ years now_ and love it. With any BCP_ there are going to be side effects. Just have to decide what you you can deal with. Was previously on Alesse_ but gave me MAD acne.,F,28,4  years,10/24/2005,Mircette

386, 5, Birth control,I've been on it for 1 month now_ so I'll come back and give a better rating later.  I just got my first period_ and it was 2 days!  It kind of freaked me out until I remembered my doc had told me that my periods would be better.  I had a little bit worse acne the first week_ but it's fine now.  I have a low libido anyway_ but I think  I'm a little more sexually active now- sex feels better!  Weeeeee!,,F,23,1  months,10/8/2005,Mircette

Today was the last time I am going to take this...I would rather use condoms than have headaches at least 15 days a month and not want to have sex with my husband.

391, 2, birth control,the light periods were nice but definitely no sex drive_ extreme vaginal dryness_ weight gain,i thought that my lack of sex drive was because i was stressed out but it's been almost a year and there's still no yearning for sex. i noticed a weight gain but i thought it was normal college weight. i'd run about 20 miles a week...yet the weight piled on! i have to skip 1 meal a day to keep it from fluctuating. but it does such a good job of keeping me from getting pregnant cause i don't even wanna have sex anymore...how good is that?,F,21,10  months,8/5/2005,Mircette

394, 2, BC_ cramps_ aura migraine,Was on the generic--Kariva.  I didn't experience any side effects until after I had been on it for 3 months.  I had major moodiness during the week of my period_ which I had NEVER experienced before taking this pill.  Bloating_ hungry all the time_ tension-type headaches (without aura) all the time_ moderate chest pain_ stomach discomfort_ zero libido_ moderate anxiety_ moderate depression during certain times of the month.,It was good for my cramps (and birth control).  I'm not sure if being on the generic would explain my side effects.  Kariva made me MISERABLE during most days of the month.  I quit taking the pill altogether two months ago and now I feel great!  I am much happier and my libido is back!  I am going to talk to my GYN about other pill options b/c I still need BC for pregnancy prevention.,F,27,12  months,6/29/2005,Mircette

My acne is gone and my sex drive has not been affected at all. I do_ however_ exercise regularly and eat a balanced diet. I also take the pill at about the same time every day - no exceptions.,I think that it is a great pill overall. I tried Ortho Tri-Cyclen and it made me horribly sick. I was also on the shot for about a year_ and had major side effects from that. Mircette has been the first thing to work for me.,F,23,2.5  years,6/20/2005,Mircette

If only I knew how much worse this pill was going to make me! I am crying constantly (my boyfriend doesn't know what to do anymore) and I am always moody. Lately it has gotten so bad that at times I even experience suicidal thoughts! I have never been emotionally unstable_ so this is really scary for me. I feel completely out of control.

408, 2, Birth Control,Weight gain (8 lbs in 3 weeks)_ mood swings,I've gained 8 lbs in three weeks since being on this pill.  I have also experience major mood swings.  I would not recommend this pill.  I've been on this pill before and experienced the same problems.  I thought it was my eating habits previously_ but this time I prepared myself by exercising and watching what I ate.  However_ I continued to gain weight.  The doctor has since switched my medications.,F,25,3  weeks,4/9/2005,Mircette

I have a mild depression_ have gained about 30lbs due to my increased appetite.  Severe headaches on the days just before period.  Breast size has increased almost a full cup.  Periods are regular though.,If this is what oral contraceptives are...then I hate them!  Of course I'm not going to get pregnant - I've gained so much weight that I don't feel sexy and not to mention that my husband could probably arouse a dead person easier than me.  I have absolutely no libedo.,F,23,1  years,4/2/2005,Mircette
410, 5, birth control/regulate period,no more noticeable side effects. I have a bit more acne than usual_ but I don't know if that's due to the pill.,I have only been on this pill for three mos._ but I highly recommend it. No weight gain_ better periods...all in all a very unintrusive birth control pill. All initial side effects (breakthru bleeding_ vaginal dryness) have gone away. I took Yasmin before_ and I felt like I was on a drug_ even though it supposedly had low doses of hormone. Reading the other comments_ I don't see many mentions of increased acne. I've experienced this_ but I don't know if I can blame it on the pill or not. Anyway_ consider Mircette if you're wary of being on drugs_ but need something better than condoms.,F,25,3  days,4/1/2005,Mircette

Little innocent period_ but I am a demon the week prior.,Sex proceeds without me. My intense pleasure in my husband does not translate into the ability to respond. If I were wrapped in tire like the michelin man_ I would still be more sensitive. The chest pain aspect has just finally clicked in my head_ and now I am scared.

No loss of libido_ though!,This is my first month on Mircette_ and I began battling overwhelming fatigue from the first couple of days on. I do have a busy schedule_ but I get plenty of rest_ so it's aggravating to be so tired all the time. The breakthrough bleeding has been a pain_ but I'm going to give it a couple more months. Because of my increased appetite_ I'm expecting weight gain_ but I'm only 100lbs_ and so can probably stand a few more. No breast tenderness (like with Yasmin)_ and defininetly no loss of libido (thank goodness). So far_ so good. And yay for regular periods!,F,25,4  weeks,2/16/2005,Mircette

My boyfriend said it's a whole new level of birth control. I took Orthotricylcen for a year and it made me an emotional wreck so I decided to switch to Mircette since it had a consistent dosage of hormones in every pill. I'm not emotional anymore but I don't know if being extremely grouchy day in and out is all that great of a trade off. Going to switch pills soon because the lack of a sex drive defeats the purpose of being on the pill for me.,F,21,4  months,2/3/2005,Mircette

I really like this pill. I feel normal when I am on it and cant even tell anymore that I am taking the pill. Some mild irritabilty before period.Recommend this one!

I plan to discontinue taking Mircette immediately.,I was told a lower dose pill would help side effects but thus far the emotional side effects have been unbearable for me.

458, 2, birth control_ less painfull period,extreme weight gain. about 14 pounds. i am a VERY athletic person and eat healthier than most people (lots of healthy fats_ whole foods_ organic_ etc). The weight is all around my belly_ 'love handles_' bum_ and thighs. As a result_ it has caused me to have back pain. I have also noticed that i have become quite unstable. when there is stress in my life_ i feel as though i lash out with no warning and can cry at the drop of a hat_ which is very abnormal. Previously on triphasil_ i experienced about a 5 pound healthy weight gain and a little less depression/moodiness_ but it still was present.,i would not recommend it unless the chemical make-up absolutely is necessary for you. My sex drive also wavered.,F,28,1  years,8/23/2004,Mircette

462, 1, to regulate periods,I felt crazy--I would take the pill in the morning_ by noon I'd be irritable_ by 3 I'd be crying uncontrollably_ and after dinner I'd be normal again.  And the first week I took it I gained 3 lbs--and hadn't changed my diet!  Also_ I couldn't stop bleeding.,This was not the pill for me.  The progesterone in it was terrible.  It contributed to me bleeding for yet another week.,F,31,7  days,5/28/2004,Mircette

Was switched to Alesse instead.,F,31,8  months,4/19/2004,Mircette
466, 4, pregnancy prevention,I had some breakthrough spotting mid to late month which I've never had with other BCP's.  My periods were lighter and breasts increased a bit in size_ as with all BCP's I've taken.,The best thing about Mircette is that my headaches are infrequent and mild- only a day or two a month_ if that.  All other BCP's I've taken have made my headaches unbearable when off the hormones for 7 days straight.  If I have to take a pill_ this seems to work the best of all I've tried (about 5 kinds total).,F,29,8  months,3/23/2004,Mircette
467, 3, birth control,Breast tenderness_ bad PMS_ very light periods_ but the worst was that Mircette killed my sex drive completely.  I went off BC completely for a few months and was surprised to find that I felt like a 14-year-old boy with a stack of dad's old Playboys.  Didn't even think that it might be the pills until I told my Dr. about it.,This pill was great for me_ except for the libido issues.

474, 4, birth control,Sometimes have breakthrough spotting,This is the best pill for me because it is the ONLY one available that has only 2 days of placebo_ with 5 days of very low dose hormone.
