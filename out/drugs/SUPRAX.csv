1, 5, UTI in child,Diarrhea after 3rd day_ was managable with daily probiotics.,"Worked wonderfully.  My daughter gets UTIs chronically since age 4_ and used to take Bactrim often until it became ineffective on her last infection.  So this time she used Suprax_ and it worked well.  But it is soooo expensive!  Cost me $250 for a 10 day supply.  (But worth every penny to heal my ""baby""!)",F,8,10  days,4/11/2009,Suprax
2, 4, UTI,None.,Unlike Macrobid (which caused horrible side effects)_ this drug simply cleared my UTI with no side effects and no hassle. Only 1 pill a day for 5 days!  I call it 'super drug'. Highly recomended.,F,28,5  days,12/3/2008Email,Suprax
3, 2, PID,Fatigue_ feeling wiped-out_ feeling hot_ espeicially in the face and arms_ and feeling very light in my body and heavy in my head.,,F,23,1  days,5/25/2006,Suprax
