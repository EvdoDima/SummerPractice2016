4, 5, GAD and Depression,A follow up.......This is a fantastic drug. I was started on 10 mg and went through the normal side effects which left after 3 to 4 weeks. My doctor boosted my dosage to 20 mg. Too much. Too medicated. Went back to 10 mg and will hold with this dose. I feel fantastic. I'm a senior and the FDA has now stated that 20 mg is the highest dose a person over the age of 60 should be prescribed. More mgs. may not help but hurt.,Great for senior citizens at 10 mg at least for me. Anything stronger is too much.,M,68,4  months10MG 1X D,6/10/2016Email,Celexa

7, 5, GAD & Depression,Nausea_ Insomnia_ Lack of Appetite_ Restlessness_ Fatigue and Yawning,"Through the years I've suffered from Generalized Anxiety Disorder and seemed to handle it on my own through diet_ exercise and my spiritual faith. This cursed condition runs in the family. When the anxiety really got too much the doctor prescribed Xanax to use as needed when it got too much to handle. I'm a retired senior citizen and this winter really got to me. I was stricken with the most horrible and wicked bout of anxiety which led to a bout of depression which I really never experienced before. All of this stuff was brought on by some ongoing unresolved family issues which kept building up and I guess I had a massive meltdown. It seemed like my world was ending before my eyes. I was really lost. I have a wonderful family physician and she prescribed this miracle drug to me. She said many of her patients had great success with it. I was warned that the first 2 weeks were not pleasant at all but I knew I had to just ""suck it up"" to let this med work to heal me.  By the end of the 3rd week I really began to see light at the end of the tunnel. A new calm and peace I've never experienced in all of my years. I am now entering my 5th week and I really feel a new sense of normal that is totally new to me...  Whoever may be trying this for the 1st time....please don't give up.

14, 1, Depression during pregnacy,psychosis_ suicidal_ doing things and then not remembering doing them_ weight gain?,This is on behalf of my friend. She is pregnant and her depression got worse and she was prescribed Celexa. She's been having horrifying side effects. Apparently she sees things and then doesn't remember_ has tried to hang herself then doesn't remember_ says weird things and doesn't remember... everyone tells her she's done this stuff but she swears she can't remember. She's also put on a decent amount of weight_ more than pregnancy weight. Not just her stomach and hips (typical pregnancy weight) but everywhere... and I'm thinking Celexa might be the culprit since it can cause weight gain. She's naturally very tiny so this is a bit odd. She's been very self conscious because of this weight gain. I'm not sure why her doctor put her on this medication but he/she is an idiot.,F,21,1  months 1X D,12/29/2015,Celexa

22, 5, Major Depression,I found that stopping Celexa was worse than starting. Some of this might have been because I was so depressed and that the side effects were tolerable in the beginning. However_ when I stopped taking Celexa I felt really nauseous for over a month straight and have been having weird electric shock sensations. I think my body must be more sensitive because I had taken over three months to wean off under the supervision of my doctor and still had some bad side effects when stopping. Despite this_ I would defiantly consider taking Celexa again if I need to.,I was in the depths of major depression and wanted to kill myself. I have never been so sad and did not see any hope. After talking with my doctor she recommended Celexa. I was hesatant to start taking an antidepressant because I thought it would be a life long thing but she told me that I could take the medication for the short term like 6 to 8 months to see if it would help. It did take some time to kick in but after about two months I was back to my old self and smiling. For me Celexa was a great tool that_ along with counseling and lifestyle changes_ helped me to live again. I am so glad I got help and did not give up.,F,31,8  months20 MG 1X D,7/16/2015,Celexa

I'm pretty much just in the 'whatever'... mood most of the day. ha. It did make my period late_ as I have read about others also. Don't be scared to take this med.

24, 5, Depression,None,Celexa has been very helpful treating my depression. However if I miss a dose or a few doses I will cry uncontrollably about anything and everything. Very small things can set off a crying jag. Otherwise I've been very satisfied with the results of this medication. My dr did switch me to Viibryd because at one point I felt the celexa wasn't working and that pushed me over the edge.

27, 3, Depression,I ate more than I usually did and gain some weight.  Also_ the first few weeks_ i started taking naps because i got drowsy.,I took for it for 3 months and i saw some change.  I felt slightly less negative  about life but I was still having days were i was too depressed to get out of bed.  I was told I would have to wait a month for the effects to happen but 3 months passed and nothing happened.

28, 3, Bipolar,Extreme sleepiness_ Lethargy_ Sluggishness,I have bipolar_ manic only type but my docs all insist I take an anti-depressant too_ they say it will help with anxiety and help tame my manic episodes. Ah_ha_ha...no. For bipolar mania it's about as ineffective as a placebo_ it may help for depression but I wouldn't know because I don't have depression. It didn't ease my anxiety at all. What it did do was make me sleep non-stop. I would literally sleep for 19 hours_ up for 5_ back to sleep for 6 hours_ up for 3_ then back to bed that night for 17 hours. When I was awake I was so tired and sluggish all I could think about was I can't wait to go back to sleep. I would sleep right thru my alarm_ started paying my bills late and missing my appointments because I could not wake up. My last doc put me back on it for IBS but I made him lower my dose to only 20mg which is tolerable. It works very well for irritable bowels and constipation but I had to stop taking it because my new ADHD med if taken with Celexa can cause my heart to stop or explode. So now my Adhd is under control but going to the bathroom is painful again.,F,29,2  months100mg 3X D,5/6/2015,Celexa

30, 1, anxiety/stress,While I did experience a relieving overall calm_ the bad outweighed the good. 30lb weight gain (I'm a distance runner). Extremely lethargic (I started sleeping whenever I had free time). Antisocial (I love a party). Unmotivated (chose sleep over daily runs). Chewing on the inside of my cheeks while asleep (never did this before). Stopped for a week. Lost 3lbs_ but became uncontrollably irritable.

31, 4, Depression/Anxiety,I was initially prescribed this med for postpartum depression after my last baby. I can honestly say that I think this medication helped me tremendously. As with any antidepressant_ I was worried about weight gain_ but I did not have a problem losing weight (at least initially) while I was on it. When I did start gaining weight after being on it for about 5 years_ my doctor tried blaming the medication and switched me to wellbutrin (which I hated). I have since realized that the weight I have gained was due to a different health issue and had nothing to do with the Celexa. Although I am trying to refrain from taking any antidepressants_ in the future if I ever do need one again_ this will be the one I go for.,Worked great for treating depression and anxiety and I personally had no bad side effects whatsoever.,F,37,5  years20mg 1X D,4/9/2015Email,Celexa
32, 4, Anxiety,I did not experience many side effects that I can attribute to Celexa. The only one I had_ and the reason I quit_ was erectile dysfunction. Ruined my confidence_ and made me concerned that something else was causing it.,Celexa worked great for me and my anxiety.

37, 3, Anxiety,At first_ like any antidepressant_ it was hard to adjust.  It make me a little nauseous_ sleeping was effected_ no weight gain at all_ worked for anxiety_ if I took too much I couldn't orgasm.  But I am on such a low dose that its not working enough for what I need it to but I dont want to lose sex drive and now after all this time on it I am having memory issues and feeling like I just can't think_ like I am straining my brain.  I want to try something else.  If you're not worried about your sex drive_ take it bc it works.  Now Lexapro didnt effect my sex drive at all but it made me gain weight and I was tired ALL the time.  So I am going to try a new med called Fetzima.  I am hopeful.,,F,43,2  years10 1X D,1/6/2015,Celexa

Even after 2 years off I was with bad sensations (no feelings at all_ no sensations of love_ anger_ etc.) that this medicine brought to me..

42, 1, Depressed,Celexa ruined my life_ started out on 20 mg_ I told the doctor after a few months of taking it that something just wasn't right and doctor said that not to worry that I just need a increase in dose to 40mg_ at the time I was depressed as I was dealing with renal cell cancer and lost a kidney_ Celexa changed me_ it wasn't helping the depression it was making me depressed more and I went away and forgot to take my Celexa with me and that was the best thing that could have ever happened after a little over a week I started to see that this medicine changed me_ changed my personality_ mood swings and I realized that people with depression don't know why they are depressed_ I was depressed because I had a reason.

43, 1, MDD & GAD,Increased suicidal and other intrusive thoughts. Racing thoughts. Hyperactivity. Increased paranoia. Increased impulsivity. Decreased sex drive. Decreased appetite. Weight gain (20-30 lbs). Marked unusual changes in personality_ behavior_ and mood. Emotional numbness and inappropriate expression of emotions (especially smiling and laughter).,My experience is too long to detail here but suffice to say my experience on this medication was absolutely horrifying and left me extremely apprehensive about trying medication again. This was my first time giving medication a try after suffering for eighteen years without and it was the only medication I was taking at the time. I did not drink or participate in the use of recreational drugs at all whilst I was on this medication. I called it quits after all of the wretched side effects finally accumulated into one of the worst panic attacks I've ever experienced in my entire life_ which resulted in me missing one appointment with my doctor and lead to her refusing to see/treat me anymore. My condition was worse than ever before for over a year afterwards_ I suffered several very severe depressive episodes and my anxiety disorder developed into agoraphobia. I had one friend who was also taking this medication at the time and had been for a few years_ at a much higher dosage than me_ who had expressed never having experienced any problems with it at all... however she was also on several other medications simultaneously. Another friend also opened up about taking this medication later on_ same dosage_ and expressed that she also had serious problems while she was on it and ended up quitting.,F,29,3  months20 1X D,11/26/2014,Celexa

45, 5, Anxiety PTSD,Initially I had the fatigue and feeling so sluggish but I cut the dose in 1/2 for two weeks. I only took 5 mgs before I went to sleep. After two weeks I increased it to the 10mgs and still I take it before I go to sleep. No other side effects at all.  No weight gain. In fact_ I've lost the pesky 10 pounds I was trying to lose and kept it off with no changes in diet or anything.,Celexa has been great. I have had no issues once I cut the dose in 1/2 and gave myself a few weeks to adjust. Now I take my full dose before I go to sleep. No problems at all. This has helped me level out so good. I'm less anxious and I notice I have a handle on the PTSD a bit better than before. Nothing is perfect but this helps with the majority of it all. Served as a RN in Iraq and Afghanistan and really had troubles when I returned home. This has helped me so much. I truly do feel better_ not 100 percent but much better than before and better than I felt in a very long time. I'm happy with this medicine.,F,38,3  months10 1X D,10/28/2014Email,Celexa
46, 5, C-PTSD and Anxiety disorder,No libido whatsoever,Helped so much; my miracle drug!  I spent about a 1.5 years on Zoloft for depression_ but started misusing it when anxiety came on. Finally had a complete anxiety meltdown that sent me to the ER.  The next day my doc took me off Zoloft and gave me Celexa.  It took a while for the anxiety to settle down_ but I felt hopeful for the first time.  My panic attacks went from constant_ to sometimes_ to now and then_ to hardly_ and now basically non-existent.  I still get a little edgy on rare occasions if I'm really stressed_ but no actual panic attacks in about a year.,F,,2.5  years20 MG 1X D,10/28/2014,Celexa
47, 1, Anxiety,I've tried many meds for anxiety & no luck except Prozac for 7 yrs then it pooped out so tried this. I am sensitive so Dr put me on 5mg after dinner. A little nausea at first but not bad. Then for the next 5 days I slept! I had extreme fatigue & drowsiness. Couldn't go anywhere but my bed_ bathroom & fix easy food items. I was a slug. I couldn't go to my yoga or water aerobics class. I basically lost s week sleeping. I didn't want to be around anyone. After existing for a week I told myself this is not normal & I am having a bad reaction because this is dangerous unhealthy drowsiness. I took 2.5mg the next night & stopped. It's been 48 hrs since last dose & can keep my eyes open & can read my book again. There is no getting past that kind of reaction. I had no anxiety of course because it knocked me out. I'm feeling better now. Be careful with this stuff. No wonder people gain weight you become so inactive. No pills for me. Glad some have good results but I read a lot that people just keep taking it hoping side effects will lessen & are quite miserable. Strangest medication I've ever taken & scarey. Good luck trust your gut.,,F,62,7  days5mg,10/23/2014,Celexa

I have been on it about four or five seperate occasions. The first couple of times I tried generic but proper brand name Celexa/Cipramil (I am Australian) works much better and in Oz only costs a few dollars more. Don't fall for the generic trap! I have experimented with other SSRI's and SNRI's and even an NRI at psychiatrist's requests but now insist on this one if I need to go back on!

Regret that- it REALLY has helped.  At first dry mouth_ thirsty_ and a tiny bit dizzy.  A couple of nights of insomnia but I have something to offset that.  A major uptick in mood and overall energy.  Does not flatten me out as bad as the others have years ago where you felt nothing- no happiness_ no sadness- just blank.

Felt improvement after 2 weeks but felt a LOT better after one full month.  You have to stick with this and give it a chance. The worst SE's were the first week.  They have gone away or are greatly lessened and can be dealt with. Still some drowsiness at times.  I take this before bed at night. I feel like myself again and am back to doing and planning things.  Sleeping a lot better too. Tried all kinds of things (sleeping pills_ benzos) and this is the one that worked (and is much safer).,M,53,1  months20 1X D,4/2/2014,Celexa
59, 4, bulimia and depression,Extremely tired (still) and diarrhea_ nausea and migraines first 4-5 days. Diarrhea and nausea subsided after about 3 days and headaches for about 5. I'm still extremely tired_ it may even be getting worse. I can literally sleep all day and I could never sleep in the daytime before_ not even when I was sick.,I was purging 1-2 times per day for 15 years. Literally_ I have only thrown up 1 time in the past 9 days and the normal urge wasn't as intense for that. I could have easily not done it. This so far has been like a miracle drug for my bulimia. I used to get so stressed out and have anxiety and that triggered my purging..but now I don't get stressed and my mind is so much clearer...and I'm never hungry. So_ when I eat I am almost making myself eat and there is no need to overeat. I'm sorry I waited so many years to try this but I really didn't want to get on any medications. If you have bulimia and need some help fighting it_ I highly recommend trying this. It will make you extra tired. That is the one downfall but I'd rather be tired and keeping my body healthy.,F,38,9  days20 1X D,3/24/2014Email,Celexa

It landed me in the ER when I passed out exactly 2 weeks later. The connection to Celexa was made by me a week later with the neuropathy_ and I quit immediately. Unfortunately my GP noted Celexa in the 'allergy' section of my chart_ so it was never reported to the FDA_ CDC_ manufacturer etc. An EXTREMELY DANGEROUS drug for me !!!,F,60,14  days10mg 1X D,3/12/2014Email,Celexa

This is especially distrubing because this potential side effect is not mentioned in the official side effects listed by the company.  However_ even though the manufacturer does not disclose this_ once I experienced it myself and did a search I found out that many others suffer from this and that it is definitely related to the drug timewise.  Because this appears to be permanent_ I would really caution others to think twice before taking this drug.  They are not kidding about the libido problem either.  Not only did I not feel like having sex but when I did try I felt like I was dead of sensation down there (I'm female).  This is how it was described on wiki: ""Genital anesthesia...

I could no longer feel inside. Nothing but blackness and the costant want to die. Top that off with OCD where I cannt go to sleep if I know the spice cabinent in the kitchen isn't organized.

I am able to actually enjoy life now and not make a big ordeal over losing my car key. It totally traqulized the deamon inside.

117, 4, Depression,Weight gaintirednessloss of sex drive,This medication helped the depression more than any other medication I have tried. I felt normal_ like I could deal with life and the negative thought processes stopped. I stopped taking it though because of the weight gain. Even exercising daily and counting calories I could not lose it. It bothered me enough that I stopped taking the celexa to try something else. If nothing else helps I will come back to the celexa.,F,29,1.5  years20mg 1X D,3/23/2012Email,Celexa
118, 4, Anxiety_ Depression,At first_ this medication made my anxiety horrible!  It also made me really depressed and kinda irrational.  I had a hard time ejaculating and I also couldn't sleep at night_ I put on a ton of weight in such a short period of time. MUNCHIES! I can't even fit into any of my pants!  Not only that but it makes me extremely lazy during the day I have no motivation what so ever!,BUTTT  I feel like the longer I take it the better all of these side effects are getting.  (except for the lazy thing)  My anxiety has gotten so much better_ and I'm feeling a little happier.  I'm going to give it another couple of weeks to see if I get my energy and ambition back_ otherwise I'll see if I can try something like Lexapro.  These drugs are completely different for each person so don't let the side effects discourage you!!!  Chances are you aren't going to find the right one right away.  It's all trial and error. My biggest suggestion is to keep track of what you're eating!  Count those calories!,M,24,32  days20 MG 1X D,3/20/2012,Celexa

120, 5, mild depression_ mild anxiety,Sexual side effects which abate with a day or two off,"Technically this drug saved my life during a severe depression in 2001 right before 9/11.  Helps with lifelong ""morning dread"" which can be severe due to a demanding and stressful profession and with rumination on worries. Taking the generic is fine.  When life gets really stressful I can go up to 40 mg day with noticeable improvement.  When trying other drugs over the years I noticed that stopping was always a bad idea: the drug never worked as well the second time.  So I accept I will always be on citalopram to even out my ups and downs.  First depressive episode at age 17.  Only bad side effect is sexual side effects (nearly impossible to have an orgasm) but I have learned I can skip a day and take the dose late on the second day for a bit of a vacation from this side effect.",F,57,11  years20 mg 1X D,3/19/2012Email,Celexa

123, 1, Anxiety and migraine,Made anxiety worse.,Took this initially for anxiety (with some associated depression) but continued on it because it made migraine with aura more stable. During stressful life events I would get anxiety pangs that lasted weeks at a time when taking this. Only when I came off the medicine and those incidents stopped happening (even during stressful times) did I realise that bastard drug had been making it worse for years. Here was me thinking it helps control anxiety! It may do that in some people but certainly not all_ thus it may help you or it may not. This family of drugs is far from one size fits all_ it will work well in a % of people and poorly in others. Certainly I felt much better when free of this drug and not being a victim of extended anxious sensations_ which made it hard to sleep_ ruined my appetite and at their worst made me feel like a frightened rabbit. Problem is the pangs would go (making me think the drug had helped) and I would stay on it because of the migraines_ but they would always come back.

I have found lot of sites with information but i wondered why some people have none or very little withdrawal symptoms and other's have a difficult time.  Please read the following it may be because this drug deplete's certain vitamins in the body:Coming off Anti-depressants (SSRI's) needs to be done gradually. Drugs alter body chemistry and it wise to let the body become accustomed to any fall in chemical stimulation. However_ if symptoms begin to reassert themselves this is often interpreted as the 'depression' returning. In such cases_ most patients continue taking the drugs. They are unaware that depression is a condition requiring time to grow. It creeps up over a period of months_ or even longer. It is not instant. The problem with stopping anti-depressants (SSRI's) appears to be a build up of a chemical residue in the body. Components of the anti-depressants lodge themselves in muscles and organs such as the kidney and liver and can take several months to disappear. In the meantime they can still actively enter the bloodstream and mimic the drug's action. As the effect fades any withdrawal symptoms will repeat themselves. But the body is responding to a toxic residue from the drug rather than re-entering a state of clinical depression.,F,55,12  weeks20mg 1X D,2/9/2012Email,Celexa

Dosage was increased from 20mg to 30mg and that brought me to a good therapeutic level.  I take at before bedtime due to tiredness.,I have suffered from depression off and on my entire life.  It became severe when I became chronically ill three years ago and could no longer work.  No antidepressant helped at all and I was resistant to trying another one but reluctantly did because I was so deep in a dark hole I knew I needed help.  Celexa has given me my life back.  It has been five months and I pray that it continues to work for me.  I do feel a bit tired in the mornings but it is worth it to me to be out of that dark place and enjoying life again.  I haven't needed my xanax for panic attacks since starting Celexa.  Life is good again.  Remember it takes time to reach its therapeutic level.

130, 5, Depression,for the first few days_ the pills periodically made me feel like I was starting to trip on a mild hallucinogen that reminded me much of the onset of psilocybin mushrooms except with no anxiety or edginess. some yawning and sluggishness for the first two weeks which I combatted with night time dosage. now the pills seem to keep from falling asleep if taken before bed. the increase in appetite seems less noticeable when the pill is taken before bed. shortly after swallowing the pill it definitely seems like my stomach feels hunger pangs. it must occur as the gut absorbs the med. I think possibly this hunger induces people to eat and then peaking and dropping blood sugars for the rest of the day cause over eating and sweet craving. if you can take the pill before bed you might like it better. keep a glass of water and your pill handy and try to drop it just before you are gonna fall asleep. I used this stuff for two years and foolishly thought I could get by without it and weened off. I suddenly realized about five weeks ago that this year I have been off the pill_ my life has slowly swirled into deep depression. this medication makes me a better person for the world and not just myself.

I started Celexa in June 2007 due to the job I had at the time. It was extremely stressful. When I'm depressed I have a hard time sleeping_ I constantly feel sick etc. I got married at the end of August 2010 and realized a day before we left for our honeymoon_ I would run out of pills before we returned (I didn't have any remaining refills). The Dr being the lovely person she is would not call in 10 pills for me until I was able to get in to see her when we returned. Needless to say_ on our honeymoon I was splitting pills so I wouldn't go completely without. When we came home_ I was so irritated I decided not to go back to see her. A very long month afterward I was completely medication free. I still to this day_ do not take anti-depressants and I'm fine without them. I think I had a dependency on them because I used them for so long. During the month I was very ill. I had vertigo_ I had constant nausea to the point where I wouldn't get out of bed_ I had severe headaches_ cold chills etc. Someone compared the withdrawal of an anti-depressant to that of a heroin addict.

(relief so far) because I thought I was going to have to have a hysterectomy or something_ so it does seem to effect my hormones_ which is a good thing now.I was crying at the drop of a hat until I started taking the Celexa_ so has been a life saver in my opinion. I cry rarely on the 40 mg.It has really helped me_ I prefer the white oblong shaped ones_ I had originally used the white football shaped ones but being generic_ they must be more expensive?

158, 5, Depression/Anxiety,Negative side affects are very tolerable compared to the depression. Libido shifted - not sure if I can come or not_ have tried and it takes forever. More inclined to get a great massage. Definite jaw clenching throughout the day and desire to suck as well as thirst/dry mouth. Desire to clench jaw increases as night -so I suck on candy or chew gum and be sure to drink lots of water. One side effect of Celexa is that your colon slows down. I think this is because your nervous system is being stimulated. So suddenly my poop has turned mushy. My Dr. knew about this in advanced and prescribed Magnesium Stearate - so I will try that.,"I have so much more energy_ sleep better (don't sleep 10-12 hours a day anymore) and am tremendously relaxed! my social anxiety is gone and I am able to focus. This drug has been amazing for me. I cried for 2 years every day & finally caved in and tried this one. With Celexa_ I don't feel like I am taking anything (save for the jaw clenching) - I feel like my old self. I am smiling_ am more cheerful and outgoing and not afraid of people. Taking 20mg of this drug a day makes my life totally enjoyable. It seriously reminds me of a low dose of ecstasy but without the icky ""I'm high and taking a drug"" feeling. Celexa  is a vast improvement over my horrible emotional-blunting experiences with Paxil and Wellbutrin.One interesting side effect for me has been that I became a little more messy and didn't care. I'm bit messier and happier. I used to *have* to have everything clean or I got depressed or anxious. So I guess I'm not so OCD_ however_ drinking caffeine on Celexa makes me want to clean_ do projects_ and be productive and focused! It's been a lifesaver in terms of my job and work -I'm back on track. Also_ I'm able to go out and have a diet coke instead of a beer even! This was me: dragging myself through life like a crying zombie trudging through quicksand. This is me now: smiling_ happy_ energized_ relaxed_ dreaming up new dreams_ getting tons done_ talkative again.

ONCE IN HIGHSCHOOL AND ANOTHER WHEN I WAS ABOUT 21 AND AGAIN AT 24 RIGHT AFTER I HAD MY CHID AND WAS GOING THROUGH POST DEPRESSION. I HAVE ALL GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS MEDICATION. ONLY FEW WARNINGS OF ADVICE. TAKE AS LITTLE DOSE AS YOU CAN ( I TOOK HALF A PILL DAILY) AND THE OTHER IS IF YOU ARENT VERY DEPRESSED DONT TAKE IT. SO IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY DEPRESSED DONT TAKE IT BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE. I HAVE DONE THAT. WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH MY POST DEPRESSION I KNEW I HAD A FEW REMAINING PILLS FROM MY LAST BOUT OF DEPRESSION SO SINCE I COULDNT SEE MY DOCTOR FOR A FEW MONTHS (SHE WAS THAT BOOKED) I TOOK A HALF OF PILL AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER HOURS FELT BETTER. I ONLY TOOK ANOTHER HALF THE NEXT DAY AND NEEDED NO MORE I WAS INSTANTLY PICKED UP OUT OF IT. IF IT WERE ANY HIGHER DOSE I WOULDNT RECOMMEND JUST STARTING AND STOPPING THIS WAY. ALL IN ALL IT IS A FABULOUS DRUG THAT MAKES YOU YAWN ALOT BUT THATS A SIGN ITS WORKING. IT HAS BEEN GREAT FOR ME AND I RECOMMEND IT. AND IF YOU HAVE ANXIETY CELEXA GOES WELL WITH THE MILD YET VERY EFFECTIVE VISTARIL.,F,25,  1X D,6/16/2011,Celexa
161, 4, Social Anxiety,Very detailed & vivid dreams that seem too real (I sometimes can't figure out whether something actually happened or if I dreamed it_ the dreams were THAT detailed). Tiredness. Takes longer to ejaculate_ but I still get horny.,I love Celexa. It helps keep my anxiety at bay so much. I feel more social and don't have as much nervousness when meeting people & going out. It makes me drowsy but it goes away. It also messes with my sleep a little_ but it's not that bad. When I was on Prozac_ my sex drive was completely gone. On Celexa_ I got my sex drive back_ but it takes a while to ejaculate. I'm upping the dose soon to 20mg and I hope it helps even more. Anyone who has had issues with anxiety and can't find the right SSRI_ look into Celexa. Prozac and Buspar weren't good for me_ but this is. I'm also prescribed Ativan_ which I haven't had to take as often because of the Celexa. No weight gain so far.,M,21,3  months10mg 1X D,6/9/2011,Celexa
162, 1, pmdd/depression/anxiety,exhaustion_ sluggish_ mood swings_ suicidal thoughts_ trouble with memory,I've only been on the medication a week_ but my symptoms have gotten 10x worse. I am also on lithium for bi-polar depression/anxiety etc (amazing drug)_ but my pmdd has been horrible so my doc prescribed me celexa. He told me I'd have sexual side effects thats it. YEAH RIGHT. I'm awake_ then exhausted_ then awake_ then exhausted. Moody_ angry_ suicidal_ empty_ and I eat constantly. Worst drug ever,F,27,7  days20mg 1X D,6/6/2011Email,Celexa
163, 5, anxiety/panic attacks,in the beginning the side effects weren't pleasant. after about 6 weeks i felt great!,i was started on 20 MG (early january) and about a week and a half ago i was upped to 40 MG and i couldn't feel any better. it has helped me out so much! been extra sleepy after getting upped. but i can deal with it vs. anxiety and panic attacks.,F,19,5  months40 MG 1X D,6/2/2011Email,Celexa

165, 4, major depressive disorder,First couple of weeks I was still depressed but it got better with help from therapy.,It has personally helped me.  I started taking it in mid. Feb of 2010 and by June I was much better.  I am still better_ though now i have to be check since I started to hallucinate and my depression is coming back.,F,18,1  years40 MG 1X D,4/30/2011,Celexa
166, 3, social anxiety_ generalized anxiety,increased anxiety and inner restlessness,I've only been on it for 3 days but I don't think I can keep taking it for a few more weeks waiting for it to 'kick in'. I went to a restaurant on Day 3 and I felt so much inner agitation and anxiety and I felt like I could climb the walls and I wanted to run out of the restaurant and go home_ the only reason I didn't was because someone else was with me and they didn't want to leave. SSRI's don't agree with me_ they make me more anxious and tense physically than when I'm not on them. I was on Lexapro before and I also had a lot more anxiety and tension the whole time I was taking it - for 4 years. The constant tension and anxiety didn't go away until I weaned off of the Lexapro.,F,27,3  days10 mg 1X D,4/28/2011Email,Celexa
167, 4, Depression_ Anxiety_ Maybe BPD,Sluggishness_ vivid nightmares beyond anything I have ever dreamt before_ early morning insomnia_ i'd wake up at 4 every morning_ maybe weight gain?,I'm still taking Celexa_ and will continue for a year ish but so far it is good. I'm extremely sluggish and always want to sleep but when I'm on the pill ive had times I felt better than ever. I have intense dreams but that's no big deal_ the earl waking is annoying but its not too bad. It will go away i assume. The few days I forgot to take one or i had to cut one in half before my refill i noticed a huge difference though_ i got frustrated so easily and got so bad and felt so worthless again. I feel like i am so dependent on them and i dont want to come off them...ill be fine one day though. I'd rate it a 5 but i've only been on them a bit. Pretty good. Definitely take them before bed though you get exhausted.,F,18,2  months20 MG 1X D,4/22/2011Email,Celexa
168, 5, depression,The initial week I'd wake up at night just totally wired and uncomfortable_ grinding teeth and tossing and turning. It felt pretty terrible but I stuck it out. Side effects went away fast but these past few weeks I'm starting to notice I have no sex drive and early-waking insomnia again.,"Within a week of starting this drug my boyfriend said I was definitely becoming more cheerful. It's nice to have someone else monitoring my behavior because I usually have troubles recognizing when I'm declining/improving... I might have gone off it and I'm glad I got the first weeks over. Now if I forget to take them for 2 days or so MAN you can tell. It's a good drug for me_ when I was on Prozac I felt so ""leveled out"" that I had no highs and lows but with Celexa I feel like myself... good sense of humor_ happy_ interested_ still capable of experiencing frustration but I can work through it. Unfortunately now I'm having early waking insomnia and I haven't wanted to get it on in weeks. Crud. :/ Hoping those two things are related to something else but I suspect the drug...",F,23,5  months10 MG 1X D,4/19/2011,Celexa
169, 2, Anxiety,Sweat_ weight gain_ lethargy,I took this for anxiety. I would wake up in sweat..not soaked in it_ but enough to be uncomfortable. I would sweat doing simple things like sweeping. In only 6 weeks_ I gained weight. I read the reviews on here & told myself I would control my eating habits_ which I did. I didn't change what I ate...in fact_ I exercised more often and still gained weight. No matter what I ate_ I could not lose the weight. It helps with anxiety_ but at a cost. I'm going down to 10mg per day to see if that helps. If not_ back to Prozac I go.,M,21,6  weeks20 1X D,4/15/2011,Celexa
170, 1, Depression,"Celexa has made me very sleepy_ I yawn a lot now. Also I find it hard to concentrate on school work. Easily distracted_ grades are slipping bad. I laugh way more now_ its like im high all the time. I laugh at almost everthing now. Especialy when Im around pretty girls_ I will laugh way more. I dont know why. ""NEVER TAKE CELEXA"" It sucks_ my grades are shot to hell now i cant frikking concentrate any more. F- this drug.",Dont take Celexa_ ever.,M,19,4  weeks 1X D,4/12/2011Email,Celexa
171, 4, Anxiety/Panic attacks,For the first week side effects included a delusional hell inspired by apathy and not wanting to do ANYthing. I missed like a week of school because of this. The hellish week kind of echoed it's side effects for like 3-5 weeks on n off_ but eventually they pretty much disappeared. At this point side effects are probably some short term memory loss but it's hard to tell if that's the citalopram (Celexa) or the alprazolam (Xanax). And decreased libido is definitely true_ but for me that's kind of positive_ it helps me last longer and I still experience great pleasure. It's not like I'm incapable of orgasm or anything.,Well I guess doctors kinda know what they're talking about when they say that SSRI's are the best modern way to treat anxiety. I also take Xanax or rather Alprazolam and it still feels necessary for me to take_ but it was not really having a good enough effect for me when I was only taking it. After over a month on Citalopram(Celexa) I finally felt like I actually did get some relief from anxiety not just a quick fix in which I would soon return to panic. All of you with anxiety know that this condition is not clean cut and predictable but let's just say Celexa has really helped a lot_ and has made Xanax more effective. I'm not doing the best right now but that also has to do with life circumstances etc. and I think I might need to up my dose to 20 mg. That seems like it might be the perfect dose for me_ and I'm hoping to wean off Xanax because of the devastating stuff I've heard about withdrawals... scares me a lot. But yeah Celexa very helpful for me. And I would like to mention this_ most people who go to the doctor and take the medication their doctor prescribes usually end up getting better and will never have any reason to go online and talk about it_ I just so happened to be a parranoid anxious freak before I took this stuff So I looked closely at every review I could find before taking it. There's nothing wrong with that but it's important to realize this inevitable truth... Reactions are not consistent in anyway with people_ it saves some people's lives_ makes some p,M,24,4  months10 MG 1X D,3/30/2011Email,Celexa
172, 2, Stress relatex anxiety,Almost immediate reduction of libido.  At 20mg not so bad_ at 40mg I didn't even remember that I liked sex.  Lack of sleep at first but just needed to adjust when meds were taken.  Getting off of Celexa was the hardest part_ extreme fatigue and dizziness.,Overall I could feel and experienced what celexa was designed to do.  I was mellow to the point that I did not care. Nothing seemed worth the effort to get worked up about.  Even things that I should have cared about just were not that important.  I was sort of just 'there'_ not for better or worse_ just taking up my space on this earth.  I was numb yet nice_ caring and understanding but never truly felt a euphoric happiness that you would expect taking antidepressants.These were the reasons I stopped taking the medication.  I missed the passion of life_ love and anger; I missed myself.,M,31,5  months40 1X D,3/25/2011Email,Celexa

I was perscribed lithium also but do not feel comfertable taking that at this time ugh!!! my head is a wee bit foggy and my appatite has increased.Im a very fit 200 pounds and very active person normaly so not to worried about that now. still very early but for me so far so good.going back in morning to see about getting lamictal instead of lithium??

174, 2, Depression/anxiety maybe BPD,Lack of self-respect regarding to what i ate (am usually health conscious_ that went out the window)_ slight increase in comfort level in social situations_ brain dead-ish (never could find the words or how to react to ppl)_ sex drive dwindled,Very weak affects in comparison to my paxil experience..more gradual but definitly noticed slight improvement in anxiety levels. Just was not the drug for me - i could see my behavior becoming destructive again.,F,21,1  months20 1X D,3/15/2011Email,Celexa
175, 3, Depression,Dizzy_ tired_ sleeping all the time_ weight gain. Felt like a slug. Added 5 mcg's of Cytomel which defeats the tiredness. Good combo.,After trying 25 antidepressants_ my doctor put me on 5 mcg's of Cytomel with the Celexa_ and later Paxil CR (both sedating and good for anxiety). After 15 years of depression_ it went away in one day with Cytomel. It was like someone turned on the life switch. My thyroid tests were and are still normal.'I don't think big pharma has depression quite figured out yet. Try Cytomel!!! Read the testimonials on here_ they are the same as mine. Start low and go slow (5 mcg's - 10 mcg's). No more than 10 mcg's per day.'You will feel like a dead plant come back to life! No generics!,M,40,6  months20 1X D,3/6/2011,Celexa
176, 5, Extreme Anxiety And Depression,First two days had very mild and manageable nausea & diarrhea along with very slight headaches. The least amount of fogginess as I titrated doses from 20mg to 40mg to 60mg. Inability to orgasm.,I finally caved in after 15 years of anxiety that has been getting progressively worse. My doc isn't keen on benzos and convinced me to give Celexa a try. I felt much better on day 5. After one week I went to 40mg. Day 8 was a day of a higher plateau of feeling better. Day 15 I went to 60mg and by day 17 I was feeling a few notches better than before! I went yesterday for a visit to the doc and mentioned the sexual side effects and he wants me to try 60mg of Cymbalta for a few weeks instead (which I am not so sure_ I am liking the Celexa!) The somnolence and mild emotional blunting is a very acceptable trade off vs. having been consumed with the anxiety.,M,40,21  days60 1X D,3/2/2011Email,Celexa
177, 4, Anxiety,Dopy brain effect never went away.  I sucked at playing board games.  Could not concentrate.  Also another side effect that never went away was low tolerance to heat.  I would get sweaty on not so hot days if i was trying to be active. Did not experience this with Paxil. Trying Prozac now.,Celexa worked.  My anxiety was kept at bay.  But_ two side effects just would not go away.  That has caused me to try another medication.,M,39,9  months20 1X D,2/24/2011,Celexa

179, 4, anxiety,Just like the previous post_ I was tired_ yawned alot and felt out of it.  After a couple of weeks_ I still get a bit tired_ but I feel much more 'even'.  A double edged side effect for me is sometimes I ejaculate and sometimes I do not when having sex.  All I can say is I can go a lot longer and this is good that I can more than satisfy my wife.,Give the drug some time to get in your system.  For me and others_ the side effects lessened after a few weeks.,M,53,45  days20 mg 1X D,2/17/2011,Celexa
180, 2, Depression_ Anxiety,Initial euphoria followed by extreme fatigue_ dizziness_ nausea_ jaw tightening_ dry mouth. If you want a drug that makes you feel like a patient in a psych ward_ this one's for you!,Celexa made me a little tired and dizzy on the first day but my mood was genuinely better.  I felt like I could smile for no reason at all (I have a sarcastic personality_ so this was weird for me_ but obviously no room for complaints).  Then day two came along and I was so tired I could barely move.  I spent the entire day in bed_ feeling too weak to move.  I had thoughts of suicide but couldn't have carried out a suicide plan if I wanted to_ so instead I just pictured myself logrolling off the edge of a cliff.  Not realistic if you have other responsibilities than tripping off celexa.,F,29,2  days20mg 1X D,2/16/2011,Celexa

Within a week I felt a lot better_ but by 3 weeks I was feeling worse than ever.  By week 4 I was feeling so hopeless I found myself seriously considering taking an intentional overdose of sleeping pills.  I have never been suicidal and this alarmed me.  I immediately stopped taking celexa and felt much better within 2 days.  I realize I am more prone to this side effect because of my age but it was still quite alarming.,F,23,1  months10 mg 1X D,2/8/2011,Celexa
184, 5, Depression and Severe Anxiety,A little nausea and some tiredness the 1st week taking it_ but then it went away.,The 1st week I noticed a big difference in my mood. Started having more energy again_ and by the 2nd week I felt back to my normal self. I used to be afraid to take an anti depressant because of horror stories I've heard or read about_ making people worse or hurting people_ but I was feeling so down and miserable I felt I had no choice but to try it. I'm so glad I did because I'm finally living my normal life again.,F,28,2  months10 mg 1X D,1/31/2011,Celexa

187, 4, irratibility,decreased libido,I am extremely sensitive to SSRIs and SNRIs_ and I have always experienced sexual dysfunction to some degree_ however_ this one seems to have the least sexual side effects. What's really odd is that lexapro was one of the worst offenders but celexa isn't near as bad (strange considering that lex is the cleaner version of the same molecule). Anyway_ I'm giving 10mg a shot to see if there's any benefit there but will likely go back to 20mg soon. I feel 30mg would be a lot more effective but I can't risk the sexual s/e's. If there was no issue with sex I'd go back to lexapro in an instant - that was very_ very effective at taking away all stress and enhancing my mood.,M,35,2  months10 1X D,12/29/2010,Celexa

Every piece of my legs hurt down to the tendants_ toes_ and so much more.  I feel like I'm going to lose my job because I have went from being able to walk just fine my whole life_ until early sept.  I was advised by my nurse over the phone that i need not to stop any medications without the doctors opinion and that my troubles walking have nothing to do with my medication.  Its come to the point where I have been to the ER for internal bleeding_ free clinics telling me to get mental  health help.  I have had blood work done.

This whole world is about cash.  I am a waitress.  28 yrs old. and my life is crumbling. I have had so many side effects I can't keep track.

I hate this drug and wish I had never started it.  I am decreasing from 20 mg to 10 mg daily.  I believe that this antidepressant is not working well for me with what I believed to be a mild case of anxiety.  Prior to taking Celexa_ I had not experienced self esteem problems and lack of confidence.  Wait loss seems to be a problem for me too.  I have lost 20 plus pounds in the last month.

Ended up getting in an accident; was more tired than I have even been in my life_ seemed to go on for weeks. I also stopped drinking at the same time.  The sexual side effects were frustrating at 40mg which was another reason I dropped down to 30 (the reduction was positive).,After taking it a few months and seeking consuling_ I feel much_ much better.

And still depressed.,I went on this to help me deal with my husband's bi-polar disease which is currently in full bloom.  It certainly hasn't helped and has seemed to make things worse for me.  My health-care provider said this one had the least number of side effects_ so I guess I'm not an anti-depression med candidate if that's true.

I told my Pulmonary Doc about it and they gave me Celexa..20mg per day...after three day's_ I knew I was good...It was like having a new life again. I can't believe that just a little 20mg tablet could do so much...thank god for the med and especially for my Nurse Practioner and Pulmonary Doctor. After little more than a year_ I did have a feeling of panic...but not an attack..however_ One pill was not enough so I took two_ and after a few hours_ I was good again.

211, 2, Dep. Anx. to get off Zoloft,The sexual side effects are not nearly as bad as Zoloft_ which was the initial reason for switching to it. I have had some libido come back_ but also horrible anxiety_ suicidal/homicidal ideation_ strange crazed rampages always late at night. Used to take Xanax just a couple times a week at bedtime to help sleep. Now I need it every day and can't leave the house without it. I eat non stop. If I am not completely full to the point of uncomfortable I start to get panicky and binge again (No purging). I also sleep all the time. 10 hrs. at night_ then a 3 hour nap at least during the day. It's ridiculous_ but I get so tired that I just can't stay awake.,I am afraid I might get in trouble because going out in public makes me completely crazy_ irritable and angry. It makes me want to hurt people. I'm not normally like this. Guess it's on to the next one. Hope my doctor will finally give up on SSRI's.,F,24,2  months40mg 1X D,8/3/2010,Celexa

213, 4, depression/anxiety,Teeth clenching_ sleepiness_ lower sex drive,I am combining the use of this drug with therapy.  Initially it made me tired but that has tapered off.  Absolutely no feelings of depression and no panic attacks.  It has given me a positive attitude to work on my issues with my therapist.  No weight gain_ which is great.  The teeth clenching was extremely annoying and it took months for it to go away.  Overall I feel much better than I did 6 months ago.,F,46,6  months10 mg 1X D,7/21/2010,Celexa

215, 4, Depression,Total loss of libido.,"I started on this medication a year ago for depression and it worked well.  It took a few weeks for me to feel the depression lifting_ but once it did then it was gone for good!  I didn't rate this medication a ""5"" because the loss of libido seriously interferes in my life.

220, 4, Severe anxiety_ bad insomnia,"Manic mornings after taking pill that settled down by noon.  Weird electrical ""zaps"" in my head_ light-headed feeling_ gained 10-15lbs no matter how little I ate_ feeling of invincibility.","My anxiety started gradually but eventually I got to the point where I couldn't handle work or social functions with more than a couple people.  I had been on Zoloft 10 years before for depression but this wasn't depression so it took me a while to realize what was happening.  I also had been suffering with insomnia for almost 4 years sleeping barely four hours a night.  I was a wreck.My doctor prescribed Celexa/Citalopram and almost immediately my insomnia ended and so did my anxiety.  I was a new person and everyone around me noticed.  This drug saved me.But it also caused annoying weight gain that I could not control and certainly I couldn't drink alcohol like I used to.  You simply cannot drink booze in any quantity without getting really messed up.  I cut back but wouldn't quit entirely.Besides euphoric_ manic mornings after taking the pill_ I began to feel invincible and nearly screwed up my entire life.  I was reckless to the point of endangerment and I nearly ended a very good relationship.  Sexual function actually increased which encouraged the desire to stray.  I ended up having to quit because even though I was right_ I should have demurred to nasty upper management who didn't like my new attitude.I ended up weening myself off of it and had serious depression the following week but felt ""normal"" again after that.Now_ 8 months later_ I'm depressed as hell how my life has changed and need to figure out how to stop my suicidal thoughts.I'm sick",M,45,2.5  years20mg 1X D,6/5/2010,Celexa
221, 1, Anxiety? Social Anxiety,TERRIBLE REACTION... Day 1- woke up 2am soaked with sweat_ thought it was a normal side effect. Day 2- Went to do my normal run_ very stiff had to stop. Day 3- Muscles buldging out of the back of my thighs_ limping_ felt like fire going thru my veins. Felt like I was in a microwave heating from the inside out. Went off of it and slowly my muscles relaxed_ not able to run anymore though my body feels like it has aged 20 years. Dr. didn't believe it could cause this and told me to re try in a week_ Took only 2.5 mgs this time_ instant fire in my legs.... I believe that it caused Peripheral Neuropathy....,Start out very slow_ see how your body reacts. I was not able to even metabolize 5mg's of this med.

223, 1, depression,Euphoria.  Lack of concern about consequences of actions.  A feeling that nothing that could happen would make me feel bad or sad.  Friendliness.,I went off Celexa because I realized (cognitively) that the euphoria I was feeling & acting on was not good for me_ that my behavior had become a problem.  I did not consult a psychiatrist or even a full-fledged medical doctor_ I was going to the Indigent Clinic & out of work.  I dropped the drug totally_ cold-turkey.  Then I started feeling spacey_ strange_ I had dizziness_ a feeling I couldn't describe; I passed out once & fell off a ladder.  Then after about 2 weeks I went into the deepest depression I've ever been in.  It lasted for over 9 months.  At the deepest_ I was in bed about 22 hrs of every day_ I wanted nothing but to sleep my life away.  I would try to watch TV & I would burst into tears.  I thought about dying as a release.  I finally dragged myself back to the Indigent Clinic_ told the resident_ he put me on an antipsychotic which made me incredibly ill_ I ran a high fever & had abdominal pain.  I stopped taking it.  He told me never to take another anti-depressant_ he said I might be bipolar.  After that_ I never consulted the Indigent Clinic again for anything mental_ or anyone else.  I do not trust anyone to prescribe anything for mental problems for me.  I know of no one here I would allow to prescribe for me.  I have gradually gotten better.  I started reading articles about mood-boosting foods & behaviors_ I changed my diet gradually_ got completely off of caffeine & started eating foods with Omega-3's like,F,54,3  months 1X D,6/2/2010Email,Celexa
224, 4, anxiety and depression,Sleepiness. More anxiety first week_ then that tapered off. Some of the generics gave me nausea.,This is a really great drug if you have combined anxiety and depression because it does not make you hyper. It can make you sleepy though so I take it at night before I go to bed. This makes me much less foggy in the morning. I have been taking it for 3 years and I think I will probably take much longer because I couldn't function without it.,F,55,3  years20 mg 1X D,5/28/2010,Celexa
225, 1, Anxiety,Severe agitation_ tremors_ weight gain_ odd electrical sensations_ sexual dysfunction(I have been off this drug for two years and this has not resolved),I would advise you to use this drug only as a last resort (like only if your suicidal). Please talk to your doctor about other forms of treatment. Psychiatric medications can have serious lasting side effects.,M,21,7  months20 1X D,5/28/2010,Celexa
226, 1, Anxiety,every single one imaginable and then some_ and made my panic attacks more frequent and WAY worse.   I've stopped this HORRIFIC medication about a month ago and have been living a hell on Earth.  Barely able to work_ headaches_ SEVERE skeletal and muscle pain_ horrific vivid dreams.  For the whole 2 weeks of feeling decent on the medication_ this withdrawal which seemingly is NEVER going to end is NOT worth it.  If I could sue the makers of this drug I WOULD.  I HATE this drug_ and would never recommend it to anyone.,Worst medicine on the market.,F,34,3  months20 1X D,5/23/2010,Celexa
227, 4, Major depression_ anxiety,First months - like a zombie.  But was better than the depression. It took awhile_ (i can't remember how long) but I eventually balanced out:  I felt like how I should feel_ like a happy_ healthy human being again.  Side effects that persist throughout the years:  excessive sweating_ clenching teeth.  But these are nothing compared to my crippling depression.  It is very important that people keep in mind that these drugs are not cures for depression; they just help you manage it.  The real work for me that has helped equally_ or even more than the drugs_ is therapy.  Presently_ the Celexa is tapering off in its effectiveness in helping me.  So_ I'm augmenting with a thyroid drug.,No sexual side effects.  Not a cure_ I still struggle with depression and have to work really hard to be okay.  Celexa has helped immeasurably_ and I credit my doctor for saving my life ten years ago! I switched a few years ago from the brand name to the generic and noticed no difference.  I did develop a mild allergy to ibuprofen but that could have also been just aging; further_ I get menstrual migraines and cannot take a migraine medication b/c of the Celexa.  So_ I do tend to suffer once a month with very bad headaches - again_ this is nowhere near as bad as my depression.  My best lesson in treating depression:  keep talking to your doctor_ take your medication as prescribed_ and always see a therapist.  Best of luck to you all.,F,33,10  years60 mg 1X D,5/17/2010,Celexa
228, 4, slight depression_ agitation,I was prescribed 20mgs. The first day of 20mgs I was completely knocked out. I couldn't move off of the couch_ not sleepy just unmotivated. Like someone pulled the plug on me. I also was yawning alot and clenching my teeth. I cut the next dose down to 10mgs and it has helped tremendously!,Since I am only 100lbs I thought 20mgs may have been too much for me so I cut it down to 10mgs_ since I've done that I've seen great improvement in my mood. I am much more relaxed_ not overreacting to minor things. I am a mom of a 3 yr old and work full time_ I was beginning to feel overwhelmed by every task. Since taking Celexa I feel motivated_ focused and not as uptight as I had become. I hope it keeps working because people close to me notice I am more relaxed as well_ I feel alot better on this!,F,34,2  weeks10mg 1X D,5/8/2010,Celexa

230, 4, Depression Anxiety,The first 2 weeks were pretty brutal_ feeling as though I was in a constant dream-like state with periods of intense anxiety. These feelings gradually tapered down by weeks 5 or 6.,Dosage was 20mg for 1 month_ 30 for next two weeks_ then up to 40. Started to feel positive effects around week 4_ and probably full effect by week 7. I don't worry as much now_ although I still have Xanax for breakthrough anxiety. I have had to use less and less Xanax though_ which is great.,M,33,2  months20--->40 1X D,4/26/2010,Celexa
231, 4, anxiety/depression,Forgetful. yawning at first_ weight loss_ decreased sex drive.,This drug has helped me so much.  My anxiety was becoming unbearable and I could hardly function at times.  The most noticeable side effect is my forgetfulness.  I forget things easily and feel a little bit spaced out at times.  When I first started taking the drug I almost felt like I was high_ but that  decreased a bit with time.  My sex drive is lower_ but it hasn't disappeared and also got better with time.  I used to have problems with dealing with the idea of my own death and felt scared that I could die at any moment.  With this drug I've been able to sort through my fears and finally deal with those feelings.  My life has greatly improved because of this drug and I can function normally.,F,24,3  years20 mg 1X D,4/22/2010,Celexa
232, 2, Major depression,Severe rapid weight gain_ increased menstrual cramps,I'm not sure what brand_ but my bottle says Citalopram HBR. I took it to treat uncontrollable sobbing fits_ inconsistent sleeping patterns_ and a loss of love for life. I would say that my doctor diagnosed me incorrectly_ because it did not allieviate my symptoms. It did bring back my bubbly personality_ but the crying and uneven sleep were still there. As far as the side-effects_ let me first point out that I had no idea these could have been from the citalopram until I got off it and they went away. I noticed the same month I started taking it that my usually non-existent menstrual cramps were almost unbearable. Pain pills did not work and I would ask people to sit on my abdomen to try to dispell the pressure. I gained about 70 lbs in the six months I was on it. That's 11.5 lbs a month! Once I got off the pill_ I stopped gaining weight_ and after 2 months of being off I lost 8 lbs. I just started taking an NRI instead_ and the crying has blessedly stopped.,F,24,6  months40 mg 1X D,4/12/2010,Celexa

235, 4, Anxiety_ panic attacks,"At first_ I was VERY sleepy. I was yawning all the time_ and it was a real problem. So_ I started taking it at night_ and that helped a lot. You might want to try that if you're excessively sleepy. I also initially had trouble with ""word recall."" I couldn't remember the names of things_ and it made me feel stupid. The therapist said this was normal. That eventually went away after about 4 months. The only lasting side effects are the lack of sexual drive and very vivid dreams. I just don't crave sex very much at all. My husband doesn't either since he's on Prozac. We can laugh about it_ so I guess that's a good thing. The vivid dreams are kinda fun_ so that doesn't bother me. LOL!",Overall_ I'm pretty pleased with this med. It has worked MUCH better for me than Cymbalta. My anxiety has decreased quite a bit_ but I don't feel numb. I think my emotions are more in line with reality... I don't get as worked up over nothing.,M,34,7  months20 mg 1X D,3/29/2010,Celexa
236, 4, anxiety/night terrors,I can't cry.  Sleepy_ yawning a lot.,Really helped with anger issues.  I do not get mad about anything really anymore.  Even when I feel like I want to cry_ I just can't.  The tears wont come to my eyes.  It's really weird.,F,30,3  months60mg 1X D,3/22/2010,Celexa
237, 4, Anxiety and Rage,Weight gain_ grinding teeth_ thirsty_ vivid dreams on a fairly regular basis_ memory and organizational skills seem to have flown the coop though.  Still_ that's preferable to wanting to smash my head into a wall 24/7_ or to smash someone else's head into a wall.  My hubby use to let me use his palms to hit my fist into so I could release some of the pent up anxiety.,I don't like the weight gain_ but this drug has saved my life_ at least for now.  I started experiencing rage and severe anxiety while going through menopause and getting sarcoidosis at the same time.  I don't know where I would be today without it; probably a mental institution_ so yes_ I'll take the weight gain over that.  My doctor did subscribe 5mg per night of cyclobenzaprine to help with the teeth grinding that kept me awake at night.  The combo works great most nights.  Once in awhile I have insomnia_ whereas before_ I couldn't sleep at all.  I do miss my organizational skills though...it doesn't work for my job_ but that's the way it is.,F,56,3  years30 MG 2X D,3/22/2010Email,Celexa
238, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ Panic Attacks,Tired_ Zombie like feeling_ need to sleep a lot_ more reasonable about situations_ happier,"During my first few weeks of taking Celexa I experienced a variety of side effects. I felt really really happy all of the time with lots of energy and motivation to get out of bed. I no longer felt anxious_ but I did feel slightly ""drugged"". Its been 6 months now and I am mostly happy most of the time but I am very tired and some days quite dazed.Although I feel quite motivated on the whole_ because of the tiredness I feel that I care less about mess in my surroundings. I have random outbursts of warm affection to anyone and everyone (but that cant be a bad thing) This has definately improved my life a lot_ I am generally really happy_ and I have returned to rational thought :)",F,20,6  months30mg 1X D,3/17/2010Email,Celexa
239, 4, Stress_ anxiety,"I was AMAZED when I first took Celexa_ because within an hour I said ""this is the way I should have always felt!"". It evened out my moods and helped me not wake up in a cold sweat from anxiety_ and made me feel like a better mom and wife. I have twin boys and one has autism and the other has high functioning autism_ both of which are particularly challenging on many days_ and taking Celexa helped me calm down considerably when the stress levels used to feel like my blood-pressure was going through the ceiling. I am calmer and more relaxed in social situations and I don't have much social anxiety mostly on Celexa. I feel more empathy for others_ and feel more loving and snuggly with my husband but my libido is decreased_ orgasm is delayed tremendously and not nearly as frequent.",The few NEGATIVE things that I have noticed after being on Celexa for a few months though are that the longer I am on it_ the more decreased my libido seems to be getting. I also have worse PMS symptoms (from the start really). I seem to be adjusting to the effects of the med to the point in a way that it doesn't seem to be helping as much in some aspects_ such as the fact that I am grumpier a lot more than I was_ and this could be in part because I am not feeling good sexually! Major bummer as I was doing great on it BUT I am about to switch to something else because of the sexual side effects mostly!,F,40,3  months20 mg 1X D,3/17/2010,Celexa

I now am enjoying doing things I used to enjoy:  shopping_ going out with family /friends_ and even cleaning house!  I was worried about sexual side effects_ but so far have had none.  I started on 20MG_ but recently increased to 30MG daily_ because I felt like it wasn't helping me as much as it had been in the beginning.,F,34,6  months30MG 1X D,3/11/2010,Celexa
243, 5, Depression,I began taking Celexa first thing in the morning. It gave me great anxiety_ a feeling of dizziness_ shaky hands_ slight nausea_ sleeplessness at night with sleepiness during the day_ and extreme cotton mouth. I decided to take it at night to see if side effects remained. I had slight sleeplessness at night for about a month afterwards. And more than two years after taking the drug I still have cottonmouth - so I cary breath mints or gum to combat it. The other side effects disappeared after a week of taking it at night.,"I still take it at night. I was on it for two years at 20mg/day and it suddenly stopped working. This is often referred to as ""prozac poop-out"". I was prescribed 40mg/day instead. For about two weeks I was unable to sleep. After the initial two weeks my depression went away and I'm felt normal again. I can function on this drug. I have normal range of emotions. I anticipate having another ""prozac poop-out"" in the future_ but for now this drug works_ and it's saved my life. :)",F,28,2.5  years40mg 1X D,3/11/2010,Celexa

No apparent change in Libido; no change in sexual functionality or erectile capability (So_ Yay).Crazy_ epic_ amazing dream activity (thumbs-up on that).,"I began taking Celexa after a decade of using Paxil (successfully) to control anxiety and panic. The Paxil simply stopped working_ over time. My doctor asked that I try Pristiq_ which seemed to have worked for about six months.  Not long ago_ I slipped into a state of near-constant anxiety_ with minor panic symptoms. I began taking low doses of Klonopin: 0.5mg_ twice per day (totaling 1mg per day)_ for short-term relief.The doc prescribed Celexa. I've been on it for about five weeks; it seems to be doing it's job. I am less anxious and less likely to get that panic thing that pops up_ occasionally. My outlook it better_ in general_ and I'm more outgoing. So far_ based on a short duration of treatment with this med_ I'd have to say that it's a good choice (for me).Note: the benefits didn't start showing up for at LEAST one month. Like all SSRI medications_ one typically doesn't see any real effectiveness for several weeks_ upon beginning.My hope is that this medication continues to work_ and not ""poop out""_ like the Paxil did. I'd be happy if I can get a good decade out of it. For now_ I will continue taking 40mg of Celexa_ and 1mg of Klonopin_ daily.

I felt like this drug messed with my hormones even though it is not supposed to mess with the absorption of the birth control pill.  I had spotting in the first week and major munchies!  The increase in appetite stayed with me while taking celexa.  However_ I loved the drug.  I felt better within 2 weeks of taking it.  Unfortunately_ it triggered migraines.  If it wasn't for that I would have kept taking it.  I was taking the generic version and it was very cheap with little side effects.  I called this my ""Chill Pill"".

Weight gain_ absolute lack of libido.,"After trying several of the more garden variety SSRIs (Zoloft_ Paxil_ Prozac)_ this was one of the two drugs that actually works for me_ but I am concerned that I am taking far too high a dosage.  My Rx is of the ""everyone is different and lab trial levels don't go high enough with some patients"" philosophy.  He does not seem concerned with the drug long-terms effects on my overall health. (I am also ramping down from 4 mg of Xanax and am now taking 2 1/2 mg.)   I was taking a lower dose of Lexapro_ but my insurance no longer covers it.  The only other drug that worked for me was Anafranil_ which I tried about 15 years ago_ but even though it worked like a godsend_ my body could not tolerate the rapid heartbeat side effect.

If you can't metabolize this drug understand it can take years to recover from taking one pill and it's an excruciating process.  I WANT IT OFF THE MARKET.  And it is not a substitute for Paxil_ it causes the same withdrawal issues.

I was having panic attacks that were interfering with work and I had gotten to the point where I would freak out in a department store if I couldn't see the exit_ I was fearful of crowds_ over-heated rooms_ elevators_ locked doors. All of these problems resolved (no therapy). I have to wonder though whether I will be able to eventually drop the drug and retain all these benefits_ including a newfound all pervasive patience that makes it possible to now smooch on the sofa with my husband of 24 years.

Took it in the AM_ then Klonopin at night to sleep for about 5 weeks.  Still on Celexa_ tapered off Klonopin once Celexa kicked in.  It's much harder to have an orgasm_ it takes about 10 minutes instead of 3 or 4.  Increased sex drive_ been on it 6 months and haven't gained any weight yet_ but that is probably because I'm only on 10 mg.

While on Celexa_ i probably cried once a month... I think I gained a little weight on it_ but it stopped my eating disorder habits which kind of makes me sad since i gained weight. I am very confused about my eating now since i never used to do it before_ but on Celexa it feels normal to eat.

Trying Wellbutrin now to try and combat the depression and weight gain but so far it's making me feel like i'm on crack.  I would never recommend Celexa to anyone who cares about their weight.  90% of the reviews i've read suggest major weight gain in a short amount of time.  Just read other reviews on here and Google it.  Weight gain is out of control on this drug.

285, 1, Not Justified,My sister has a history of paranoia and mental illness.  She took it into her head that my mother_ a happy and bright person_ needed an anti-depressant_ and got medical power of attorney to force her on it.,On Celexa my happy_ normal mother became totally psychotic_ giddy_ and out of her mind.  She tried to sleep in the bathtub.  The giddiness was mixed with bizarre outbursts and fits of rage.  Her gait_ already difficult_ became far worse_ and she developed total incontinence.  My sister wouldn't believe what I told her_ and my mother continued on the Celexa for several weeks.  When I tried to stop it_ my sister had me charged with elder abuse.  My mother ended up with severe brain damage and stopped reading; she started believing TV commercials were part of the program_ and though finally off it_ she continued to suffer from such brutal_ intense non-stop anxiety that I am dimished as a person just to have witnessed it.  The worst was the profound_ soul-shattering suicidal depression.  She refused to leave bed and begged for sissors with which to stab herself.  Finally_ constantly prone_ she developed pneumonia and died.  By that point_ it was a mercy.  I lost my best friend_ the dearest_ happiest_ sweetest soul I've ever known and_ worst of all_ have to live with these memories every day.  The experience made ME suicidal for two years.

I may have had a bit of the yawning thing early on_ but other than that_ it's worked great for me. My life is still really stressful right now due to several family issues; before starting Celexa_ it was rare for me to smile_ and if I started crying it was really hard to stop. I had NO desire for sex_ and not even for fun leisure activities. Now I smile and laugh. I still have times that I cry_ but it doesn't last so long and I don't feel so hopeless.

Overall it has been a good medication for me and relieved my symptoms.  Once I went cold turkey off of it when my prescription ran out.  Terrible experience of feeling dizzy_ poor concentration - I could barely speak a coherent sentence.  Please talk to your doctor about weaning of this medication.  The slower the better. No drug is a panacea for anxiety and depression and hormonal changes are especially challenging because you have no control over them.  Take care of yourself as a baseline - sleep_ eat properly_ exercise_ manage your stress_  THEN add the drug.,F,44,390  days,10/15/2009,Celexa

Ive been on it for about 5 months now and I cannot say enough good things about it! Im a lot more calm and even more outgoing than I used to be. Things just don't bother me like they used to before.

I still have bad days_ but it i am no longer anxious or depressed.  I am going to increase dosage in a few days to 20mg to see what happens.  I will update you all after that.I had taken Celexa many years ago back in college_ but it didn't seem to work back then...maybe it was because I was partying WAY too much...i think it negated the positive effects of Celexa.  So don't blame the Celexa for not working if you are doing drugs and blowing your brains out on alcohol.  That will make the most sane person depressed and anxious!!  Also same goes for people who use tobacco and caffeine.  I cut that crap out and it made a LOT of difference.  Stimulants screw up your HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis and Celexa tries to fix what you screwed up.  Read up on HPA axis and SSRI's and antidepressants.  If you are depressed or anxious_ your HPA axis is probably SCREWED UP!!..also read about Sleep Apnea...that could be your problem.  Other than that_ try to eat healthy and exercise!!!,M,27,6  months,8/29/2009,Celexa

Celexa has been amaxing for the OCD symptoms. Could finally begin identifying obsessive thoughts and behaviors and altering them. Good for the depression too_ although a bit sedating. Had to add 150 mg Wellbutrin to have energy. I've tried all the other SSRIs out there_ and Celexa has been the one that's worked the best for me. But it is such an individual thing. Such a crap shoot. The only other medication that ever helped with the depression was Effexor. I took that for 6 years_ but it stopped working after awhile. Celexa has been the best for OCD.,F,39,8  years,8/17/2009,Celexa

I take a very small dose_ between 10 and 20 mg. depending on the time of year though I am usually on 10 most of the time. I found it to have few side effects and it makes me feel normal_ not spaced out or numb like others I have tried.

By night three I was beside myself...terrible images of hurting loved ones and myself racing thru my mind.  I spent the 4th day sobbing in bed all day long.  I quit taking it after 3 days...doctor says no one else he has prescribed it to has ever had this experience (of course!)  Was referred to a psychiatrist who felt that I shouldn't be on ANY antidepressants at all due to my experience with Celexa.

When I am hungover a weird dizzy feeling but nothing too bad.,I just wanted to say_ reading all the other reviews that I think people who are taking a drug like this have a predisposition of overreacting to this. If you take it and after 8 hours you are extremely nauseous most of the time it will be in your head except for a few people. My recomendation is to take it with a good mood as something that will help you fix your life and than hopefully you can get off it. If you feel spaced out or anything that is a discomfort dont dwell on it_ just make busy and I think a lot of ppl will find most side effects arnt that bad. Except I cant orgasm....which is bad hehe.

Helped with constantly evaluating what *I* thought other people thought of me.  Kinda of an emotional flatline_ however_ and started to not want to go out and socialize --- no fear about it_ just ""didn't want to"".  Decided to cold turkey off after about two years... I know you're supposed to reduce dosage.  However_ after a couple or three ""off"" ""odd"" days (and one day of muscle tremors trying to do fine motor skills (like drinking a glass of water_ or standing on a sloped hill)_ started to feel much better.  Now am glad I am off it.  After about a month_ I can orgasm again when I want to_ and it doesn't ""hurt"" to do so anymore.

I felt horrible_ I was tired constantly and yawned about 83 times a day I had to make myself get up and do anything it actually made me feel more depressed and did nothing for my 'temper issues'  I know each medication is different for everyone but from my point of view I am glad to be off of it and trying something new (zoloft) and so far (a week now) it has been so much better,F,31,6  weeks,7/6/2009,Celexa

I dropped a few lbs once I went off and stayed at that weight for about 3 years.  I wasn't really committed to diet and exercise though.  Also impossible to have an orgasm through regular sex.  I didn't realize that was a side effect until I came off of it.,Helped a lot after 3 to 4 weeks.  Started to feel normal and I believe it helped a lot with some traumatic events during the time I was on it...end of long relationship_ moving 4 times (in college at the time)_ dealing with a horrible new relationship_ but was able to get out of it.  And who can forget 9/11.  I think it helped me to get through that experience without freaking out too much.  I noticed I was much more focused on school work and family and friends instead of depression and anxiety like I had been for years before.

My doctor_ a psychiatrist_ says this is because I am bored by my job but I think it is the drug. It amazes me how little most doctors understand about the effects of these drugs. They ought to read this blog instead of the handouts from the drug reps. Sexual side effects never got better_ in fact I now have ED which I never had before. Worst of all_ I could experience very bad diarrhea at any given time of the day! I am tapering off this drug now. Prior to this I was on Effexor.

I have no trouble getting an erection_ but have to make a lot of extra effort to achieve orgasm and ultimately it's never as satisfying. So I don't bother as often_ I went from 1-2 daily to 2-3 x weekly. The drowsiness has subsided the longer I'm on it. Appetite increased and I was more interested in eating_ but the medication helped me get out of the house and start exercising again so that balanced itself out. So I'm healthier than I was before I started_ and I was able to stop smoking pot pretty effortlessly after the first few days (knock on wood). Slight teeth grinding which has also subsided especially since I fist started taking it.

In fact_ it is almost impossible for me during regular intercourse.  Sounds like a big deal but it really isn't if you're male.,Completely cured my depression and anxiety.  I have found it to be the most effective of all the antidepressants.  Unlike other antidepressants it doesn't cause weird side effects from dopamine or norepinephrine reuptake and I find its effects on anxiety extremely powerful and immediate.  It blew my anxiety right away as soon as I started taking it.  Cipralex (just a patented mixture of celexa isomers) is marginally better_ but definitely not worth the extra money.

366, 2, Dysthymia,Wellbutrin XL stopped working after 6 years.  Celexa was the first antidepressant my doctor had me try.  On a dose of 20 mg daily_ I suffered dizziness to the point of falling down at least once a week_ usually on steps or stairs as if losing my balance_ worsening fatigue_ sleepiness_ grogginess_ 'brain fog'_ headaches_ even a few minor motor vehicle mishaps (scraped my car along a wall in my workplace parking garage--TWICE).  Celexa also made me quite alcohol-intolerant; one cocktail made me very loopy_ headachy and nauseated.,My dysthymia manifests as apathy_ cynicism_ lack of motivation_ head-to-toe body_ joint and muscle aches_ dyspepsia/IBS_ overeating_ fatigue_ 'brain fog'_  insomnia_ and a generally unsociable_ 'bah humbug/grumpy old hag' attitude.  Celexa 20 mg made my body feel FABULOUS--all my ol' lady aches and pains magically disappeared_ I swear I felt 28 again--it made my IBS diarrhea vanish_ and I slept a little better_ but it did nothing for my mood_ attitude_ outlook_ energy level or motivation. I had headaches every day and plodded around in a fuzzy zombie-like brain fog for 4 weeks_ hoping the side effects would fade and the depression lift--but alas.  I stopped taking it cold turkey with no problems_ but I also immediately started taking Cymbalta and I've remained on Wellbutrin_ both of which may have minimized any withdrawal symptoms.,F,46,4  weeks,1/16/2009,Celexa

I couldn't take a full breath_ and I was thinking about horrible things happening that weren't realistic. They checked me for a hereditary heart condition that runs in my family_ but then put me on Celexa thinking that it may be anxiety. This medication helped a lot...I notice that I am not as irritable_ it is much easier to draw a full breath_ and my sleep patterns have improved (after the first two weeks). However_ I used to be able to achieve multiple orgasms with my husband_ and I now need extra stimulation to reach one. Still enjoyable_ just takes more work.

The 17 days I was on it were the worst of my life yet I kept hanging on having read about the initial side effects fading over time.

I couldn't stop crying_ I had overwhelming dispear_ the like of which I've never felt before nor do I want to feel again.

It wasn't as bad as it could have been_ thanks to my stabilizer (topamax_ LOVE IT). I'm no longer depressed_ but I still feel pretty blah when alone. My anxiety is going down and my IBS is under control too. It makes me tired so I take it at bedtime with my anxiety medicine.  Give it a few weeks_ it took a while for my body to adjust to it.

I intially began anti-depressant therapy due to having some degree of seasonal affective disorder and taking something helped me get through the dark winter days.  Also_ I think I had been suffering from depression since I was a teenanger and didn't recognize it as such until I was an adult.  I do think about eventually getting off of it especially with the thought of having children but for right now_ it is the right drug for me.  I have tried Paxil in the past and had an enormous amount of weight changes_ both gaining and losing which had a huge toll on my body.  I have not experienced anything like that with Celexa.  The only negative thing I have to say about Celexa is that it does cause me to have a lot of energy_ sometimes to the point of running myself ragged.

I had never tried anti-depressants before_ but decided with my therapist I needed something to handle my out of control emotions and freakouts. Tried lexapro for 4-5 weeks and actually felt more depressed_ so my doctor switched me to Celexa_ saying it was almost the same thing as Lexapro but cheaper and might be more effective. Been on Celexa for only 2 months now_ but feel much better. I sleep better_ no more panic attacks_ i quit pacing and rocking within a week of taking it_ I don't swing between manic panicky behavior and crying jags.

A sleep test showed I was not taking in enough air about 18 times per minute on average.  A test with a CPAP did not work out_ so the next option was a low dose anti-depressant.

423, 1, Depression,apathy_ lack of motivation_ worsened depression_ suicidal thoughts_ numbness,Had been taking Wellbutrin XL for years when my new doctor decided to try me on Celexa to help with recent anxiety. Boy_ was THIS a mistake! My old psychiatrist told me that I do NOT support the SSRIs well_ so it's partially the fault of my new doctor for not listening to me when I told him this and prescribing it anyway. As with Prozac_ Celexa first made me completely numb and apathetic to the point of not functioning enough to get out of bed. I've had to miss work time because of this medicine_ and now that I am coming off of it_ I have been so suicidal and have a depression that I haven't had for YEARS (Wellbutrin is AMAZING_ kept me out of depression). I'm going back on wellbutrin XL and strongly suggest that people approach taking Celexa with caution.

This drug_ which was supposed to smooth over my feelings of loss and depression_ caused me to completely fall apart.  My solution was to buck up_ dump the drugs and work my ass off to get out of my lousy situation.

440, 1, ANXIETY-DEPRESSION,TERRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS-- Shocking sensations in the brain_ or referred to as Brain Zaps_ chest pain_ itching all over body_ headaches_,I started out on Lexapro Dec.2007 for Anxiety/BI Polar. Lexpro was working great not a complaint other than in the beginning makes you extra tired. Since Lexapro doesn't come in generic form wanted to find something cheaper. So I tried Celexa for about two weeks. I thought I was going to die just days ago with the chest pain I had. If you have anxiety_ you know the chest pain I am talking about. Then all the sudden I started to have these shocking sensations in my brain. I scheduled a dr's apt --1 because I had a cold and 2-because of the Brain Zaps. The doctor recommended a CT scan of my brain to rule out anything. Just hours away from the CT scan I was given this website_ and seen how many people wrote in about some of the same side effects I was having. Cancelled the CT Scan and went back to Lexapro!!

I have been on it for the past 5 weeks and only this week have my panic attacks started to subside. I worked with a psychiatrist to get through the rough period. Took a small dose of Ativan every 8 hours_ 3 times a day_ to help with the increased anxiety that this drug seems to cause. Both my GP and psychiatrist encouraged me to stick with the Celexa because they believed it would eventually help with the severe panic attacks that I was having. I am hoping that once I hit 40 mg that I will be panic free.

I am at 30 mg and will up the dose to 40 mg in week 6. If you are taking this medication for panic attacks make sure to work closely with your GP and psychiatrist. Like many people mentioned this drug can initially cause more anxiety and panic. My docs had me take a small dose of ativan three times a day until my body adjusted to the celexa_ but even with the ativan I found this medicine extremely difficult for my body to adapt to. However_ at week 4 I definitely feel that the medicine is working and I am starting to feel more like myself. I was having several panic attacks a day and have not had one all week now that I am on 30 mg. This is a huge relief to me.

Trust me_ try a few things to figure out what works for you.  Zoloft did not work for me and I hated the way I felt.  20mg_ detached_ no orgasm_ blah.  The generic of celexa makes me feel like myself again.  I am engaged_ active_ alert_ and not crying all the time.  The one thing I would advise is be careful when drinking on Celexa.  It really knocks you for a loop.  You feel alcohol MUCH faster and cannot drink as much. I also become very emotional/pick fights when I drink on it. Other than that I LOVE IT!!!  I hope it keeps working for me and it does the same for you! It took a long time for me to get up the courage to go on meds again after Zoloft but I am SO glad I did.

When coming off- troubles focusing_ horrible dizziness_ mild headaches.,Seeing as this was my first antidepressant_ maybe I didn't give it enough time; however_ it increased my feelings of depression far too much for me to wait it out. I went from bad to worse_ so much so that all I did was sleep. Little things like doing the laundry seemed insumountable...the weight gain was bad_ as well- about 10 lbs in a month. When coming off the drug_ the most obvious side effect was the constant dizziness when walking or when I would move my eyes.,F,22,2  months,11/2/2007Email,Celexa

I first was prescribed the drug and took it for only three days at the starting dose of 10mg.  It was horroble!  So_ weeks later I went back to the MD and they told me to give it another go.  I have now re-started and I've now been on 20 mg daily for almost three weeks.  I can already feel the difference in myself.  Although I can't orgasm as easily_ I am having no panic attacks_ I am a happier person and I think I will stay on this med for at least six months until the winter blues wear off and my current situation becomes more normal.,F,25,3  weeks,10/19/2007Email,Celexa

It worked well for me_ tho I still have to take some Celexa or I become depressed.  I slowly weaned off Celexa while adding more Wellbutrin_ and am very stable emotionally.  The 1/2 Celexa every second night seems to be enough with the Wellbutrin. Weight stabilized but has not really gone down much_ tho more exercise may help that.

It had gotten to the point that it was s so bad that I was not able to have any nights of uninterupted sleep. I started at 10mg and after a week or two went to 20 mgs. This medication was amazing. Within 2 weeks my anxiety left and has never returned. I also started sleeping like I never had before. When my head hit the pillow I was out until the morning. It was just wonderful.I was on Celexa for about 3 years then decided that I didn't need it anymore.

I found that it did have that giddy effect when it starts to get really into your system.  That lasted about two weeks and started about two to three weeks in.  Diminished sex drive was there from the beginning - but I didn't notice at first because I has scarely any left with the depression.  This got even worse over time.  I also had ringing in the ears which might have been connected.  Weight gain was significant - about 30 lbs.  This did not do away when I stopped taking it.Increasing severity of symptoms especially night sweats and return of depression.,"Think it was about 3 years.  Celexa was a great drug while it worked.  There needed to be a gradual increasing of the dose for effectiveness and side effects got worse.  The doctor finally decided that there was no point in continuing - it had really stopped working for my depression.  It wasn't the right drug for me in the end_ but there was no negative effects to stopping it cold turkey.  When it was working_ the side effects were a worthwhile trade off.  If you are someone for whom antidepressants ""poop out"" I'd consider it.  If you are someone who has no weight issues_ I'd consider it.

At 20mg I was falling asleep at work and couldn't remember anything. I am an artist and couldn't make work. Sex was out of the question. Reduced dose to 10mg_ felt much less sleepy_ and developed coping strategies at work so I don't have to remember as much. Sex drive came back. Over time developed new ways of making artwork_ now feeling more productive than ever - it's a creativity with fewer flashes of inspiration_ but also a lot less fear of being incapacitated at any moment by anxiety. At this point_ the 10mg is no longer completely controlling the anxiety_ though.

Tapered down to 10 mg a day for a month just in case and then quit.  Withdrawals weren't as bad second time coming off it.   I'm having stress and anxiety again now because of external factors.  I don't want to go back on it because of the insomnia issues and weight gain.  Plus I'm just starting to get my sex drive back.

Before I took it I was crying at a drop of a hat and now I'm completely normal. i also used to suffer from panic attacks and I haven't had one since I started on Celexa. Although I guess I do get anxious_ but I've not tipped over the edge...yet. However_ when I first went on it I did feel a little confused and had brain fog (sort of like been stoned). But that lifted pretty quickly. As we're all indivuals I guess we all have different reactions to drugs_ events etc_ so maybe I'm one of the lucky ones.,F,40,1  years,4/27/2007,Celexa

These were nasty for that time period but I'm glad I gave it a chance since they went away after about 14 days_ about the length of time it took the good stuff to kick in.,I'm quite pleased with Celexa thus far.  I'm taking 10mg (1/2 a tablet) daily and this really helps with moodiness and anxiety.  Happily I haven't experienced any weight gain or sexual side effects thus far!  I'm also re-reading David Burns' great book 'Feeling Good' which I highly recommend...it and Celexa are a powerful combination.

Just enjoyed life as God intended.  When I think of all the years that I suffered with panic attacks it makes me sick.  All the school functions I missed for my children_ my husbands needs for me to be a ""normal"" wife and tend to the ""normal"" duties of a wife like simply going to the store without him holding my hand!  I lost a wonderful job as a Human Resources Director due to this illness too.  But Celexa is a miracle for me.  No side effects for me.

I have been struggling with chronic daily headaches and periodic migraines for over a year now and it was recommended by my doctor that Celexa might help me not to be as sensitive to the pain. Antidepressants was something I had not tried for headache treatment. I was worried that I would be tempted to commit suicide because of comments from other people and although I thought about it (not doing it_ just concerned I might start feeling that way) I have not felt the urge to do it. I just hope that I can get some relief from the headaches. Another reason for taking Celexa was that I was getting depressed from going to different kinds of doctors and trying different treatments and not getting any relief. I still have concerns about Celexa_ but am trying it anyway. I was prescibed 20 mg_ but cut them in half and take 1/2 pill daily in the a.m. I also take Darvocet 1-2 times daily for headache pain.   ,F,37,14  days,4/19/2007,Celexa

I was chronically fatigued and my work performance was suffering between the exhaustion_ apathy_ and moods. My binge eating increased to the point where I gained over 10 pounds in three weeks,I tried the improved newer version for this drug_ Lexapro_ and had less severe side effects_ but Lexapro gave me lockjaw and migraines.

Difficulty in motivation toward activity. I sometimes sleep as much as 12 hours a day.,On the one hand_ this medicine all but eradicated my feelings of sadness and moderated my anxiety.

It's been five days since I ingested this poison and am just now feeling my tremors and other aspects subside. The depression is more desirable than the cure_ at least this one.

I told happily told him about Celexa_ not remembering how suicidal I became_ but realizing how much better I had been feeling. He committed suicide 4 DAYS after taking this DRUG. I blame myself because I told him to ask his dr about Celexa. I TRUELY BELIEVE HE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE IF HE HADN'T TAKEN THIS DRUG!! He WASN'T SUICIDAL!! I can prove it!!! Dr had to up my dose because I became extremely depressed. Had a nervous breakdown_  tried to commit suicide. Second time I took this drug_ I was ALWAYS sleeping_ didn't give a sh*t about anything! NOTHING MATTERED! Work and sleep_ work and sleep. THEN 6 months later_ I started cutting. Had to release and FEEL something... I kept thinking about ALL the ways I c,"I took myself off this drug_ THANK GOD with my pharmacists help_ because otherwise I would have just stopped and not weaned off. But even at weaning off_ for 3 MONTHS the withdraws were HORRID! I would have EXTREME electric like zaps all thru my body_ all thru out the day. I swear_ it felt like my heart would stop_ and I would almost pass out. EXTREME nightmares! EXTREME irritability. If my husband wasnt as much as a ""ROCK"" for me_ I would be divorced.

Every time i slept i had quit odd dreams but none of them nightmares. After 1 month on celexa i realized my anxiety was rapidly decreasing and i was sleeping soundly every night. My mood was also improved. I didnt notice i was ""happy"" i just felt normal and very relaxed. My heart rate wich was never below 100 beats per minute was down to a normal 70 or so.

I have been to sleep medicine centers where I was treated for sleep apnea--cpap was horrendous---next came the surgery to remove tissue in my throat and increase space in my airway. Nothing has worked and I now suspect celexa might be the cause of this. Am looking into options. Comments?,It does help with dystimia (long term low grade depression)and keeping my mood level. I don't have bad lows. If it wasn't for the sleep issue it would probably be ok. No effects like weight gain_ panic attacks_ etc.,M,60,6  years,1/4/2007Email,Celexa

My doctor first tried to put me on a lower dose of a different medication and it made me a little loopy and I had to switch back to celexa.  I finally weaned myself off and a couple of weeks after my last dose started taking a long acting form of St. John's Wort.(St. John's wort and Celexa do not mix and you need at least two weeks before moving from one to the other)  It is definately not as strong and I am forced to deal with life's ups and downs the old fashioned way but I am getting there.

I felt more normal on the Celexa -- it took the edge off_ made me nicer to be around_ focused_ and better able to deal with anxiety. We moved_ which was very traumatic_ and I went up to 20 mg. At that dose I found I was sleepy all the time.  Went off the Celexa rather abruptly instead of tapering off_ but did not have a rough landing.  No side effects.  The 10 mg. dose makes me feel like me at my best_ but I am currently not taking anything in an effort to see if I can lose a few pounds.,Did not have any trouble with my weight at a dose of 10 mg.  A normal dose (20 mg.) made me want to nap and procrastinate.  Had a minor weight gain_ and my digestive tract seemed sluggish on the increased dose.  I was not as regular about getting exercise because I was sleepy and would procrastinate getting my workout.   10 mg. was really the best dose for me.  On 20 mg. I found it very difficult to lose weight_ inspite of good eating habits and regular exercise.  My doctor thought maybe Wellbutrin would help_ but I only took the Wellbutrin for 4 days because it really buzzed my head.  My pharmacist did not think that the Celexa would cause weight gain_ but said that several people have reported gaining weight on Wellbutrin.  Weight gain could be a result of middle age metabolism or carelessness too.,F,56,3  years,11/27/2006,Celexa

Extroverted social activity bordering on mania.,Although the effects of celexa went much further than I would have liked they did end a terrible depression very fast.  After a few weeks of taking them and finding the right dose  one day I was in the darkest depths of a horrible incapacitating depression and I woke up the next day feeling on top of the world.  It was a dream come true at that time.  But it would eventually impact my lifestyle in a way I wasnt comfortable with.Prior to using the drug I was socially introverted.  The need to interact socially and party became an overriding motivation while I was on the drug  and would eventually be the reason I stopped taking it.  Increased ability and desire to drink alcohol also became a problem.  I developed what I called at the time super social powers interacting with people in ways I hadnt normally been able to before.  The extroverted lifestyle took over my life and I lost interest in my work and writing.  I,M,33,6  months,11/20/2006,Celexa

A break up that should have just been sad and confusing got messy and I found myself not feeling like myself.  Completely out of control.  Crying at my desk at work.  I started Celexa two days ago and I've already noticed I'm sleeping better and feel a little more even.  My sad thoughts aren't pushing me over the edge and I'm getting my work done and my house clean and myself fed.  I am concerned that this has affected my appetite in a negative way since I've already had a problem with that.  And the jaw grinding- I have suffered from stress related TMJ in the past.

If I remember correctly I was taking 20mgs at first. I lost it after a couple of years from exercising. Then a loss of libido and couldn't orgasm a lot of the time_ took forever to get aroused - My libio started to work better as my dosage went down to 10mg and then 5mg. Lack of motivation and lively interest in things. At times i experience heightened anxiety if i touched caffeine which i did not experience before taking Celexa. Tired and lazy 75% of the time.

Horrible withdrawal (even with calculated_ long-term_ slow_ and increment) - lots of vertigo/dizziness while coming off.  Absolutely NO creative motivation.  If you are an artist_ writer_ or creator_ stay away! (one of the reasons why I stopped)  I'm normally an introvert and this turned me into an extrovert literally overnight!  I had a strong desire to conect with people which I don't normally have.  Actually ended a relationship I started while under the influence of Celexa shortly after coming off of it...,Celexa got rid of the major depression I had been suffering with for well over 5 years - entirely.  Almost feel like it has re-wired me to that end.  5 years later and it has not come back.  However_ I still suffer with OCD and am thinking about going back on for this and for the weight loss (I've since put back all the weight I lost while on the drug)  Apparently_ this is really good for OCD as I had no desire to over eat and/or stress eat (which I normally do).  I lost lots of weight and felt so wonderful that I thought I didn't need the drug anymore and took myself off very gradually.  It's newer version Lexipro did NOT work for me at all as I tried this at the beginning of my 2nd cycle.  Made me completely paranoid about EVERYTHING!  (I cycled Celexa twice in the past 5 years).

Yawning ALL the time and just feel spacey. I quit as soon as I found out that the sexual side effects can be permanent!!!!!!!!!!!!!

However_ I was still depressed and very moody and when they put me on 60mg i had the worst suicidal thoughts so now i'm back to 40mg and it's doing better.

I just dealt with it_ read a book or something until I was sleepy enough to hit the sack again.  Have some blurred vision in the a.m. also_ but that may be due to my glass o' wine before bed ...makes the low sex drive a little easier to deal with_ not so frustrating. :),DO NOT eat grapefruit while taking this drug!

I have lost some weight on this_ but after reading the other reviews I'm sort of freakin' out that it will start going the other way ...  yikes.

Then when I missed a dose one night_ the next morning my libido returned ten-fold.  It hit me so hard I would have had sex with ANYBODY.

I finally decided to take medication. I took Lexapro at first and insurance made me take celexa. I loved it!!! I was calm and rational. The constant swirling in my stomach and millions of thoughts running through my head were gone. No more midnight panics_ no more incessant worrying. It started working after a couple of weeks. Sometimes I would have breakthrough anxiety but never anything like I felt before taking meds. My doctor increased my doseage to 40mg to counteract that (she wouldn't refill my xanax). 40mg really worked but I couldn't have an orgasm.

However_ it has reduced my depression and panic so much. I actually sleep through the night now instead of waking up in a panic.

I only took 3 pills and after the first pill my entire mental outlook changed... for the worse.  I've never had severe suicidal thought before but after the first dose I woke up in the middle of the night and had hallucinations of someone telling me to kill myself.  I had to take an ativan to get back to sleep b/c I was so upset.  The next morning_ I felt like crap: My pupils were dilated so much I couldn't see straight and the nausea was so bad I almost had to call in to work.  Finally_ I started to feel normal again and then it was time to take the next pill!  I felt awful- like I was on ecstacy but without any of the good feelings_ just the cracked out_ dirty drug feeling.  I desided the symptoms of my anxiety were better than the side affects of this medication.  Even if I did ride it out_ whose to say I would even feel any better_ and if I ever wanted to stop _ I'd have withdrawl symptoms... no thank you.

(I have low blood pressure_ and am fit_ so am able to sustain this.) When it finally arrived_ my orgams were very intense. I was OK with this_ but after a week_ I was unable to achieve orgasm period. I was trying for up to 2 hours several times a day. All of this was in vain. My groin became extremely uncomfortable (feels like my prostate is going to explode.) The worst case of 'blue balls' ever! This is having a devastating effect on my well-being.I telephoned my doctor,"The Rx fact sheet that was stuffed into the box said that ""sexual problems"" were a side effect. Nothing further. The FDA web site says that this affects only 6% of men - but I learned that the 6% is phony because that was during the drug trials and the doctors were not allowed to solicit information from their patients.

I backed the dose down to 3.5mg per day and this has gotten rid of all the symptoms except the ejaculatory delay.  However_ combined with the increased sex drive_ this is really not an issue.  The main issue now is satisfying the sex drive.  At a higher dose the side effects were profound_ so i recommend lowering the dose as much as possible.  The drug has good psychotropic effects even at low doses_ so less is more.  Also if you look at this site... the most successful people with the drug are maintained at lower doses.

It has alleviated almost all depression at any dose (20mg_ 30mg_ or 40mg)_ but obsessive thinking only stops at the highest dose. Sleepiness is the most uncomfortable side-effect.  I can't get up in the morning even after sleeping 10+ hours. Tired all day. Sexual side-effects are profound but I have no partner so no loss_ really. Weight gain_ too. I've always been heavy_ but now I'm really fat. Drug still good_ though. A life saver. Play with the dose 'til you get it right.

If you Ejaculate Prematurely then your girlfriend/wife may appreciate it and you'll just go till you're too tired. I use standard gel sleeping pills to help control insomnia and/or cannabis. This drug will help you be much more analytical in your decisions and less guided by emotion.

I have had flu like symptoms and lost 8 pounds in 4 days. I called the doctor thinking I was having an allergic reaction and she suggested I just cut back the dosage to 10 mg. I stopped taking it three days ago and am just riding out the side effects. I am still tired and have no appetite- which means I am having to force myself to eat. I would not recommend this drug to anyone. I am more miserable riding it out then I was before I started taking it. For those trying to ride out the detox process-drink lots of water and fluids.

I never realized how depressed I was until I started taking it_ and this was the first symptom to change. My OCD has improved by probably 35-40% at a dose of 60 milligrams. Started taking it again because of a panic attack_ and have not had one since_ nor any phobic thoughts associated with panic symptoms.

I hated the way it made me feel so lethargic and sleepy.  The 25 pounds I gained while on this drug did a number on my physical self-esteem.

While on it_ I did fine.  After a while_ though_ it seemed to lose some effectiveness and my dosage had to be up'd.  I finally found a doctor who understood my progesterone issues and prescribed progesterone for me_ and I started weaning off my 40mg of Celexa in early May.  I took 20mg for 2-3 weeks_ then 20mg every other day for a couple of weeks.  Within a week after I stopped_ I started feeling jittery/nervous all the time.  Then the insomnia hit.  Then the nightly panic attacks_ hot flashes_ hyperventilating_ and feeling like I wanted to ''crawl out of my skin.''  It got so bad that I ended up having to go back on the Celexa (at 30mg) just to stop the horrible withdrawal symptoms (which they call ''discontinuation syndrome'' because Celexa is not supposed to be addictive).  My docs told me my symptoms were like the Paxil cases from the ''20/20'' special.  I couldn't work for a week (thank God my boss is so wonderful).  Now I'm being switched to Prozac (10mg) for my weaning off period_ since the half-life is much longer and the weaning process much easier than Celexa's.  I'm praying I don't go through what I went through with Celexa; it was the most horrible experience of my life.

1012, 5, Depression and GAD,Almost none. More frequent and bizarre dreams_ but that's been somewhat entertaining. :),Best drug I've tried - works as well as some others_ but has no irritating side effects. Cleared up the dry mouth and constipation I had on Effexor XR_ and doesn't make me drowsy like Paxil and Serzone.

1017, 4, Depression,Diahhrea for the first few days but not too troublesome. Really bad yawning for about 2 weeks. If it hadn't worn off I would have to have stopped taking them. Couldn't eat for the first few days and was quite trembly and tense but this may have been more due to depression that the tabletsThe only side effect after 4 weeks is delayed_ weakened  orgasm but I can live with that_ at least for the moment. ,Really good response on 20mg. It's the only anti-depressant i've taken so can't compare it to anything else. Still have bad days but not as many and not as crushingly bad as they used to be. most of the time I'm back to my old self and i can concentrate on the things most important to me and can respond more rationally to situations,M,25,1  months,4/16/2002,Celexa
1018, 5, major depression_ panic attacks,I had a mild upset stomach the first week or so but aside from that none whatsoever.  If anything it may have helped my sex drive.,Nothing short of miraculous - a major depression that lasted 4 1/2 years was done in a matter of about 2-3 weeks.  I feel like my old self again!  No more dreaded panic attacks either.  Best of all - NO side effects.  I know antidepressents can affect everyone differently but based upon my experience with it I'd highly recommend it.,M,26,9  months,2/7/2002,Celexa

1024, 4, Depression/OCD,Yawning_ at times a terrible hand tremor_ constipation_ dry mouth.,I started out with 10mg increasing 10 each week. Currently take 40mg and Trazodone for help in sleeping. I have not benefited from the ability to sleep with just the Celexa. The depression was brought on my low serotonin levels and I can honestly say there is much improvement. I would like to increase the dosage again by 10. The tension from a bad day is still impressive. I can see where I will probably take this for the rest of my life and I don't have a problem with it.,F,43,4  months,10/6/2001Email,Celexa

1033, 4, depression,sexual dysfunction -- extreme difficulty achieving orgasm; very weak orgasm,"This medication worked very quickly for me in relieving depression.  My dark mood lifted the second day_ which might have been ""placebo effect""_ but I have obsessive tendencies and (while I didn't expect this result) these were markedly reduced as well.  I feel very calm and balanced on this drug.  In addition_ I had become very defensive hypersensitive to criticism (real or implied) and am now able to think logically and react appropriately.  The Celexa improved my ability to deal with things almost immediatly.  However_ I am going to request either a change to Wellbutrin or Wellbutrin supplementation_ as the sexual side effects are unacceptable to me.",F,44,16  days,5/16/2001Email,Celexa
