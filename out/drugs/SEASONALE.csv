0, 2, To delay my period for vacation,I had swelling and pain in my calves_ then the pain started to spread to my arms. It made me moody_ and not want to do anything,,F,27,7  days 1X D,5/4/2016,Seasonale
1, 1, birth control,I am 26 and have been taking the pill for ten years (mostly Tri Cyclen Lo). My blood pressure became very high (164/112) on Seasonale_ so I stopped taking it as soon as I discovered my high blood pressure (about two months into my first pack of pills)_ but it took another six weeks to normalize.  It would go down and then up again. It took so long_ I became terribly worried_ anxious_ and depressed. In addition to the high blood pressure_ I had pain in my neck - a pressured feeling in my veins that would alternate from one side of the neck to the other - since the second week of taking Seasonale. I was sent for several tests and found that one of my kidneys was also mildly swollen. Finally_ two months after quitting Seasonale_ my blood pressure is normal_ my neck pain is gone_ but I need to do another ultrasound to follow up on the kidney swelling (hydronephrosis).,I found a website with studies of Seasonale and hydronephrosis was a side effect for a small number of women. I suppose all medication reacts differently in different people_ but this really sucked for me. I was afraid for my life. I strongly recommend that anyone who tries Seasonale should monitor their blood pressure.,F,26,60  days 1X D,1/22/2016,Seasonale

4, 4, Very heavy and long periods.,Seasonale cleared up my acne almost completely_ no weight gain_ and little cramping. Sometimes I get constant horrible headaches for weeks at a time but then they clear up.,These past weeks_ since I started school again_ I've been having really bad headaches again as I did during winter last year. Im almost considering getting off the pill. But I think Id rather deal with the headaches than deal with periods every month again. But_ it does seem like the longer im on the pill the worst and longer the headaches last. But the pill does have some great benefits!,F,17,4  years.15,9/23/2015Email,Seasonale
5, 1, ovarian cysts_ painful periods,My obgyn prescribed this instead of ortho tri to keep me from getting my period and he said my cramps would get better. 4-5 months into it my cramps reduced in severity by half. This was so amazing that I didn't even notice that by 6 months in I was thinking about suicide daily. I was ungodly depressed and I picked fights w everyone_ strangers too. I really thought it was just me. It happened so gradually and I never considered my bc. Not once. I became convinced I had now developed a mood/personality disorder. I made an appt to get tested and only 100% depression came as results. I began to plan my death as it felt comforting bc i hated myself. Then my mom came to visit and she saw the change. I started to read things about seasonale. IT ALMOST MADE ME KILL MYSELF. I love myself and I life myself and I have everything to live for. But it made me lose my bf_ friends_ I lost my loans for college and I wasted a year of my life wondering WHAT HAPPENED TO ME! This particular progestin is really messed up.,TAKE WITH EXTREME CAUTION,F,34,1  yearsnormal dos,6/1/2015Email,Seasonale
6, 1, To prevent pregnancy,Awful depression_ mood swings_ lack of a sex drive_ tiredness_ numbness and tingling in toes_ feet_ and hands_ sleeplessness.,It's turned me into a different person_ and I'm on the lowest dosage.,F,26,6  months0.1/0.02,5/6/2015,Seasonale
7, 2, Endometriosis_ pregnancy prevention,Weight gain_ depression_ fatigue_ irritability & mood swings_ loss of sex drive_ IBS_ acne_ extreme itchiness (scalp_ chest & back)_ difficulty staying asleep.,I started taking seasonale 2 years ago after being on Yasmin for 8 yrs. I always wondered why I feel the way I do_ and after a heated discussion with my husband about my loss of sex drive_ I decided to do some research. Wow am I thankful I ended up here. I've never had a problem with weight gain_ or depression. I've put on 15 lbs since taking this medication_ and I am always tired & feeling depressed. I could literally sleep for days_ except I don't sleep soundly at all. I have insane dreams_ and terrible night sweats. I feel bloated_ slow_ and lethargic most of the time. I walk a lot_ and exercise regularly_ and my tummy has grown enough that I never want to wear a bathing suit again. I am newly married and should be in my PRIME but I feel like garbage! I'd rather suffer the pain of endometriosis each month than go much longer feeling like this. :(,F,27,2  years,4/1/2015Email,Seasonale
8, 5, Extremely heavy frequent periods,None except cramping during the week off the pills and mild headaches when restarting the pills. No weight gain_ no acne_ no depression - I think it may have actually made me happier and more positive. Way lighter and infrequent periods. Totally worth the mild side effects for me.,This medication has been great for me. I had extremely heavy bleeding and huge blood clots that made it hard to do anything for 7-8 days out of 20. I also had iron deficiency. I've been taking this for 5 years and it's been amazing only having periods four times a year. Also_ they're way lighter and more manageable.,F,24,5  years 1X D,3/13/2015,Seasonale
9, 1, To get my period less_ convenience.,I'm sure everyone's reaction to this pill is different but after reading all of the negative comments about the pill I feel like I've been a part of some strange sorority of tortured women taking the same drug! Almost all of everyone's symptoms I've had. Anxiety_ depression_ severe mood swings_ panic attacks! 2 years ago I went through a divorce_ it was a cake walk compared to this!! I went off the pill 3 weeks ago and I'm Ortho-Tricyclen Lo now and my life is SO much better! I feel like I've come out of a fog! Don't suffer through this drug if you've had these symptoms ladies. Change!,,F,37,3  days,3/8/2015Email,Seasonale
10, 1, Endometriosis,I just stopped taking it. I thought I was going crazy. I kept thinking about my symptoms individually_ then I found this website and the mass array of symptoms I was having a lot of the women on here errrr having as well. Night sweats_ deep cystic acne_ back pain_ blurred vision_ itchy skin_ hive like rash on my chest neck and even my scalp. I thought I was allergic to something!! None of my docs in years ever thought it might be the birth control :/ I just stopped taking it and already I notice my skin is clearing up and not as itchy. I've been so overwhelmed with all of these weird things going on with me. I don't really feel like myself. I feel worn out_ and absolutely NO sex drive. It's like I'm just going thru the motions to get thru life...excited to be back to normal_ but very angry all at the same time.,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.,F,32,4  years30 mg,3/3/2015Email,Seasonale
11, 1, Less peroids,Depressed_ unfeeling_ sad for no reason _ no sex drive....frustrated.  I'm glad I found this website_ I thought I was alone and wasn't sure if it was the BC or not.,I'm so frustrated that this had to change me so much.. I hate having such heavy periods so often_ but would rather have them then feel this way anymore.,F,40,28  days0.15mg 1X D,1/13/2015Email,Seasonale
12, 3, Less periods,No spotting_ sex drive hard to tell due to my busy life style_ no pains_ occasional nausea_ but nothing to worry about. Unfortunatly the biggest thing was gain weight of 10 lb average and Zumba classes did not help at all.,,F,37,90  days 1X D,1/11/2015,Seasonale
13, 1, birth control,40 day bleeding_ gained 20 lbs,Seriously the worst. Was told to keep taking it to see if side effects would subside_ they aren't. Each 3 month pack i've bled for at least 30 days. Birth control isn't much good if I can't have sex! I've also always been small framed (100-110) and am now sitting at 125 with no losing it. Have been on Yaz since i was 16 with no weight gain ever. UGHHHHH.,F,27,9  months.15 mg,12/29/2014,Seasonale
14, 2, Regulate periods,weight gain_ increased appetite_ severe depression,I took this for 4 years. The first year was rough. I had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and a lot of spotting. My doctor just kept telling me to wait it out and my body would adjust. It took nearly a year_ but I did get adjusted. With every period I did experience the bloating and the cramps. It was always really bad for the first 2 days then my period was almost gone. The period only lasted maybe 5 days at most. So all that was ok...I always had depression to some degree so I thought it was just me. But while I was on this birth control I was extremely_ severely depressed. I mean_ I was suicidal at times. I never put 2 and 2 together until I went off of it 4 months ago and I have not had a single bad moment. I've been happier than I can remember ever being. So this helped regulate my periods which was great_ but it made me so off balance that it's not worth it. My husband told me he never wants me to go back on birth control again because of how different I am.,F,27,4  years 1X D,12/2/2014Email,Seasonale
15, 2, Birth Control/ Regulate Periods,Weight gain_ Discharge_ Breakthrough Bleeding_ Acne_ Mood Swings_ Bloating,Tried to give this multiple chances and I just couldn't do it anymore. Had breakthrough bleeding every two months for the entire time. I had clear skin until a month into taking the pill_ then it was pimple after pimple. Also notice increased appetite_ and some weird changes in emotions. If you can handle this stuff you are lucky! But just keep in mind this pill isn't for everyone.,F,20,1  years,11/5/2014,Seasonale
16, 2, Heavy periods,I already struggled with depression but taking these pills worsened it. I get spaced out and lack concentration when i go out doors. I do have anxiety problems but its gotten worse since taking Seasonale. I hate being around people_ i get angry at times and bitchy. I have this numb feeling and disattachment feeling.,,F,20,2  weeks0.15,10/12/2014Email,Seasonale
17, 3, ovarian cysts,Im taking the generic version called quasense. Within a week I immediately noticed a severe drop in my sex drive which took about a month to go back to normal. my breasts were also extremely sore to the point where id be in tears. By the start of the second pack I had pretty bad fatigue and no amount of sleep seemed to kick it. I also experienced lots of dreaming (i normally have dreamless sleep) which made my sleep even less satisfying. By the beginning of the third pack I had break through bleeding that lasted 6 days and was there just enough to be annoying. Not even 2 full weeks later_ I am having breakthrough bleeding again and now im experiencing chest pain and heart burn that is really starting to worry me. However_ the cyst that I was originally put on  the bc for is now gone and I am thankful for that part.,,F,24,2  months,8/21/2014,Seasonale

24, 1, Diagnosed with endometriosis,Horrid experience with seasonale. Brownish painful discharge for 1 month straight_ random full periods_ Not just spotting. And now ACNE! I've never suffered from acne until taking seasonale. The ONLY thing it helped was my pain during sexual activity caused by endometriosis. I'd rather have the pain than the long_ heavy periods and unattractive back acne. Definitely DO NOT recommend.,,F,20,5  days,2/22/2014Email,Seasonale
25, 5, having 4 menses cycles a year,The only side effect that I do not like Is the fact that when i do get my cycle its a little heavier...same amount of cramps though. Overall its very close to being perfect but i will continue to use this as my bc. And in this year i havent experienced depression_ anxiety or any heart problems...different reactions for different bodies.,,F,32,1  years,1/25/2014Email,Seasonale
26, 1, For BC and 4 Menstrual Cycles a yr,Painful cramping with first period on the pill_ shortness of breath_ heart palpitations and heart racing_ horrible panic attacks_ depression_ and headaches.,I would not recommend this BC to ANYONE_ I have tried many different BC's with my favourite being Tri-Cyclen Lo. This has to be the absolute worst BC I've ever tried. I had depression so bad I would leave my work and go home to cry. I hated everyone and everything. My husband and I were at the movie theatre ready to watch a movie in 3D (like we have done many times b4) and I had a panic attack so bad we had to leave 10 minutes into the movie I thought I was going to die. Heart was racing I could feel it through my winter jacket_ everything seemed loud_ I was sweating and shaking...I have NEVER experienced anything like this b4. Not to mention the daily heart palpitations/racing that make me short of breath on a daily basis. This BC was ver yscary and I would advise anyone thinking of going on it to find a different brand. I have been off it for 2 weeks now and the depression is gone_ I have only had one mild panic attack_ and the heart palpitations/racing is less frequent......I am hoping all this will go away once the birth control is completely out of my system.,F,27,4  months 1X D,3/11/2013Email,Seasonale
27, 4, Prevent pregnancy,I been taking seasonale for 4 years now_  the break through bleeding only happens for the first few months_  maybe 5/6. I hardly ever experience break through bleeding now.  Seasonale cleared up my acne_ and helped me with weight loss. I do get bloated sometimes_ but only mostly before and during my period. My periods are soo light its like nothing and my premenstrual cramps are half as bad as they used to be and occur 3-4 days before my 7 day cycle begins. I have noticed some discharge and a lack in sex drive however_ and can be very moody at times. The biggest side effect I noticed was hair growth.  My hair does NOT grow at all now_ all hair. Legs_  arms_ hair on my head :-( iv been trying to go my hair out the whole time and it just won't grow!  Overall I like seasonale however I will be coming off it in about a year!  Hope this helped you all!,,F,19,4  years,1/28/2013,Seasonale
28, 1, Prevent pregnancy,Chest pain_ depression_ anxiety_ paranoid thoughts_ break through bleeding_ tender breasts. I used this for 4 weeks bleed for three of them very heavily. Started to feel depressed and paranoid and I had no past history of that. I had shortness of breath and felt like I was having a heart attack. Went of it after that and within 2 days felt better_ like I was coming out of a fog. I had been on tricyclen for 10 years and nothing like this happened. I thought I was going crazy!

When I finally got to the end of the pack I ended having another period for three days which was nice_ however it was extremely painful. When I went to the pharmacy to get a refill they said it was on back order so I called almost every pharmacy in my area and they all said it was unavailable. Not only was taking this drug an awful experience_ but trying to find it was impossible. I decided to switch to Aviane because it seemed more reliable.

So I thought this may help relieve the migraines.  Well it didn't.  I still had migraines even when I was on the active pills. I also had break through bleeding that lasted 3 weeks.

Over the last couple weeks I am so irritable that I can not even stand to go to work!!! I love my job and lately I have been so horrible to get along with.

I know you should give your body 3 months to adjust to the hormone levels_ but I gained water weight so rapidly that I feared I would get stretch marks if I stuck with it. My thighs were SORE (and bloated enough that if I crossed my legs while wearing jeans_ they'd get tingly). It didn't necessarily look like I'd gained weight_ but I could feel the difference (pants were certainly restricting).

I didn't want to go on a pill b/c I had my tubes tied but it was either hormones or D&C procedure- so naturally_I chose the less invasive solution.  Though this medication has evened my mood due to bad PMS and has not given me a menstrual cycle for the last month_ I have gained  8 lbs in 5 weeks!! I am very active_ (an avid runner) and work out 5-6 times a week.  I have never had a problem with my appetitie or weight. Now_ I have uncontrollable hunger.

71, 4, heavy periods,None,I was on loestrin 30 for 5 months. I use bcp for my heavy periods. This pill was making my periods even more heavy. I hated it. The only good side effect was a clear face... I gained weight even though i didnt eat and i always had cramps and break through bleeding. I was very moody and emotional. I smoked even more due to the stress i had and was always tired. So i took a month off and switched to this brand. I missed a couple pills in each week so far but have had no break through bleeding which i am very surprised at. My hair seems to be growing faster as well and thickening a bit more. My energy level has greatly increased which i was also very surprised at! (im anemic). I havent gained weight though which is great and i dont have a loss of appetite either although i get full faster_ but still able to eat a small meal tiwce a day compared to a very small meal once a day. I have increased sexual desire and my pimples are clearing up. I did notice however that this past week i have had a lot of back pain. Which is normal due to my breast size. My breast themselves are fine- no change at all. So overall i was very scared in trying this pill but looks like it has been the best i have tried so far!

Then once I started on the second sleeve_ by the 3rd day my period stated. It is now going on 3 weeks and it haven't let up yet. It is not heavy_ I am not in pain_ but it is annoying.

78, 2, controlling menstrual cycle,weight gain_ depression/anxiety(?)_ acne,I think I have been on the generic Seasonale (Jolessa) for maybe 3 yrs. I take it strictly for cycle control as I have very heavy periods. I have gained about 30lbs. I had not even considered that it could be attributed to this pill until I read this page. I have never weighed this much in my life. I changed my diet_ joined a gym_ still couldn't lose a single lb. I also have acne breakouts and cystic acne which I never had during puberty. I also have been diagnosed with PTSD due to traumatic events that happened about 3 yrs ago. But now I am wondering how much of my symptoms might be from this pill. I've had clinical depression my entire life but never the complete loss of energy that I've experienced these past few years. After reading a lot about hormones_ birth control pills_ and people's reviews_ I'm no longer comfortable with the idea of all these extra hormones in my body screwing me up. I have not been sexually active in over 3 yrs and never plan on having children so I decided to stop taking this pill and get a permanent birth control done soon. I am anxious to see if I start feeling better_ have more energy_ get rid of the acne permanently_ and lose some weight.,F,30,3  years 1X D,8/6/2011Email,Seasonale

I will admit that the first pack wasn't fun_ with constant breakthough bleeding and irritability..I wasn't a nice person. I stuck with it though_ and have to admit that other than the occasional cramps during the last week or so of the pack_ and bloating_ I have been satisfied. I read the reviews back when I had the worst of the symptoms_ and almost stopped taking it_ but for the past year and a half it has worked for me. It really is much better than PMS and periods_ mine before would last 8 to 9 days_ and Quasense gives me a four day period_ with only 1 day of true cramping.,F,19,1.5  years 1X D,7/23/2011,Seasonale

One of the generics Jolessa gave me heart problems and finally attack symptoms and an irregular heart beat with intense weekness I was laid up for a month.   Didnt have it with the other generic or the name brand. It did make my periods lighter and easier for about two years. Then I started to feel strange like I needed to have a period.

85, 3, Fewer Periods,Weight gain_ some spotting on week 9 of pack.,I'm 21 yearsold and have never been on a birth control before because i am not very sexually active and my periods are very very regular_ at the most a day or 2 off_ so i knew that the day i left for Florida for Spring Break i would be on my period and mine last a good 6 days. So i went into my doctor while i was still on my period about 3ish weeks before spring break to see if its possible to get on a bc that would make me skip my period for break and he recommended Jolessa (generic version) and i started it right away (March 1st) even though i was still on my period he said the sooner i take it the better. I didnt experience any bitchyness_ but i think i was more emotional since taking the pill. Also my weight always goes up and down but i was in the process of working out for Florida. I normally weight 148 and when i started taking Jolessa i had a month till Florida and got down to 140 so i thought i wasnt going to gain weight from the pill. WELL now that i have been back from Florida since April 2nd_ maybe its because i didnt pig out for awhile_ but man oh man i am 158 pounds.... thats 18 pounds in 1 month. My eatting habits have changed and im always hungry or ill drink my slim fast and do good for a few days but then i get on the scale and im up a pound or 2. I'm at my heaviest and it seems even with working out its not coming off.

I loved the pills at first because not getting a period every month was great_ and i only had minimal spotting at the end of every package_ but for me the effects on my mood and personality is definetly not worth it. I would rather have my period every month than suffer with the moods i get now_ i stopped taking it today and i hope things get better. i also experianced thinnning hair and alot of breast tenderness but my main issue with it is the toll it took on my feelings.

Yeah_ it's great that the pill is supposed to prevent your period for three months_ only to BLEED LIKE CRAZY. I can't count how many pairs of underwear I had to scrub clean. Ranged from heavy to light. Annoying_ frustrating_ and EMBARRASSING.Migraines... so bad that even SLEEP didn't help.Also_ bleeding after orgasm. One was so bad_ I ended up in agony from the endo for nearly three days. I think I had a preview of what LABOUR PAINS are going to be like. I was prescribed anti inflammatory pills that made me feel like I was going to vomit every couple of minutes or so. FUN!A combination of Tylenol 1's and Advil do nothing.

99, 2, birth control,Mood swings_ very emotional_ difficulty thinking_ cramps_ and constant bleeding.,To avoid insurance complications_ I actually take Zarah birth control and skip the placebo week by starting a new pack on the day I would normally start the placebo.  At the end of the third month_ I am supposed to take the placebos_ so that in total I have my period 4 times a year. The doctor said this is equivalent to taking a drug expressly for this purpose_ namely Seasonale. But I am experiencing the same symptoms as most other people here. I have been having my period for about a month straight now. I am a student and am having difficulty concentrating on my work_ probably due to the cramps and mood swings. I am hungry all the time. I usually exercise happily about six days a week_ but now have lost interest. My body also aches_ with random spasms in my fingers and toes. I'm going to stop taking the pills today. Thank you for posting_ and helping me confirm that something's up.,F,26,2  months 1X D,2/6/2011,Seasonale

Now_ in 6 weeks i went from 165 lbs to 179...... from a bubbly person (i really am) to this bitch from hell.  I am quitting this.. it is ""cramping"" my style and my athletic performances.

101, 1, To control Endometriosis,Dry mouth_ extreme night sweats_ inability to sleep_ nausea,I just finished six months of the depot lupron treatments and my doctor switched me to Seasonale a week ago. Since starting that my life has been hell! The side effects for me are very severe. I'm still getting hot flashes_ and they are upping in intensity and quantity_ I'm still nauseated and have absolutely no desire to eat_ I've been mildly crampy again_ my mood has plummeted and I have been finding myself on the verge of tears multiple times a day (which is very unlike me as well)_ but the worst part is the new symptoms of extreme night sweats (which I have never had before in my life) and complete inability to sleep. I've gotten about 3 hours of sleep a night since I started taking it_ and that is not restful or solid sleep. I took myself off it yesterday morning_ and I noticed an immediate change in the quantity of the night sweats and I had an easier time of sleeping already. Hopefully in the next couple of days I will be back to normal.,F,26,5  days 1X D,1/26/2011Email,Seasonale

104, 3, Endometriosis and Birth Control,Cramping_ breakthrough bleeding_ problems with eyesight,I was prescribed seasonale to help with my period pains and as birth control. Since being on seasonale_ I've had constant cramping which has gotten worse with the onset of breakthrough bleeding that has been persisting for a week now. I want to come off of it as soon as possible. Other than being an effective method of birth control_ seasonale hasn't done anything for my pain. Although it has made my pain less severe_ it is more persistent_ and I've had it every day. Seasonale definitely has not worked for me_ and after seeing all the ratings from other women_ I've become even more disenchanted. My eyesight has also gotten significantly worse since I started Seasonale_ and I'm pretty sure the two are correlated. I don't know if it would work for anyone else_ but Seasonale definitely did NOT work for me.,F,21,8  weeks 1X D,1/22/2011,Seasonale

Then it ranged from days of spotting_ full on period_ one day nothing then the next morning seeming as though I might bleed to death! My doc says not to stop before finishing the pack but after reading other posts I don't really have any encouragement. The side effects are incresingly getting worse not improving.

Noticed hair started thinning and stopped taking generic Seasonale after 2 years and was told by my Dr that this pill threw me into Post Menopause.  It's been awful and my hair loss is substantial.  I would not advise any women to use this pill in their late 30's and the 40's.

107, 3, Birth control + hormones,Severe cramps,I have had a very good experience with this drug up until recently. The biggest reason I began taking Jolessa (the generic version) was to decrease the amount of periods I had per year which was fantastic. I did not experience any break through bleeding or weight gain however the week before my period starts I experience very severe cramping in my lower abdominals. The pain typically subsides after about 10 minutes_ but some days it will come and go in waves throughout the course of the day. The severity of the cramps worried me initially. I will most likely continue taking this pill unless either the cramping gets worse or more persistent or unless another drug comes on the market that I think might not have similar side effects.,F,24,  1X D,1/12/2011,Seasonale

109, 1, To reduce headaches,Unexplained low back_ hip and leg pain and fatique,I started taking this at the end of Oct 2010.  Within a week I noticed extreme pain in my right hip.  I waited and finally went to the doctor after the pain had not subsided for 2 weeks. They diagnosed me with bursitis and put me on pain meds and prednisone.  10 days later the pain moved down my thighs and into my knees.  It felt like someone broke my bones in my hips_ thighs and shattered my knee caps.  By mid Nov I was in so much pain I went to the ER.  They thought I had sciatica and sent me to a back surgeon.  The back surgeon thought I might have a herniated disk and performed a MRI which came back negative.  He referred me to another spine doc to give me an epidural with more steroids.  That doctor did some labs which concerned him and they ordered yet another MRI.  I was scheduled to have the epidural and they were about to start the procedure when they check my temp and discovered a fever.  The procedure was canceled and I was referred to a Rheumatologist.  This is the first doctor that actually wanted me to stop the Seasonale immediately as it was the only new thing that was introduced to my body since all this pain started.  He also ordered a bone scan and more blood work as a precaution.  Within a week of stopping the Seasonale my pain drastically subsided.  I would strongly urge anyone who has any type of joint/ leg pain that is taking this medication to stop immediately as it cost me thousands in medical bills and tests and 2 months of extreme pain!,F,26,7.5  weeks 1X D,1/5/2011Email,Seasonale

112, 1, To control Endometriosis,weight gain_ bloating_ moderate to severe cramping_ break through bleeding every day_ breast tenderness_ dizziness_ mood swings worse_ UTI problems,"My Doctor put me on the generic version of Seasonale called Jolessa 0.15/0.03 1 tablet per day to control & help the horrible symptoms of my Endometriosis. I have to say this is the absolute WORST birth control pill I have ever been on. I have taken it for exactly 8 weeks now & took my last pill today due to terrible side effects. First off I think I have ruined every pair of underwear I have due to the break through bleeding that I had almost every day. The cramps I experienced while taking this pill were every day & varied from moderate to very severe (as bad as labor pains). I am not exagerating one bit either. Sometimes it felt like someone stabbing me with a knife it was so bad. Worse than the pain of my Endometriosis! I am cranky pretty much all the time & cry & yell for no particular reason or the slightest things will set me off. Yes I had pms before but nothing like this. The weight gain I experienced was pretty major_ around 10-12 pounds in 8 weeks & I know it's from this because I did not eat any differently etc. while taking this pill. I hate this pill so much I am just going to stop taking it. My Doctor insists it will go away after a while..When? When I become the ""stay puff marshmellow woman""? When I over dose on Advil? I've had ENOUGH! Hopefully this weight will come off as soon as I put it on but I doubt it. I will update this after I've been off it for a while.

113, 1, Severe PMS_ heavy periods,Heavy bleeding for weeks_ clotting_ migraine_ severe cramping for weeks at a time.,After looking at the other posts here_ I am definately getting off this pill seeing as it's not just me that is reacting badly to it. I have been taking it for 7 weeks now and 3 weeks ago I started with light brownish pink spotting with cramps. I figured it was just some break through and it would subside. No. For the past two weeks_ I have been bleeding and clotting to the point where I soak a super tampon in an hour and a half and I can feel the clotts passing and leaking around the tampon on top of that. And that is around the clock_ there has been no let up. The cramping is constant_ unlike my usual cramps for the first day or so during a period_ 4 advils barely take the edge off the pain. The weight gain is atrocious. I have easly gained 12 pounds that I can not lose. I am prone to swelling and weight gain like this overnight_ but I will also lose it quickly after my period tapers off and since this one isn't stopping_ the swelling keeps inching up. I did notice severe mood problems at week 5 and 6_ first I was pissed off at the slightest thing_ irritated by people like never before_ then the next week I was sad_ teary_ feeling sorry for myself about stupid things. I am going back to a regular 30 day pill and deal with the pms and migraines that come with those..this pill is just making these symptoms more intense and for weeks at a time instead of days.,F,37,7  weeksone pill 1X D,12/17/2010,Seasonale

Constantly ruining my clothing and worrying about bleeding through my clothes at every social function our outing I participated in was absolutely horrific.  I became severely anemic and had to be treated with infusions of iron twice as it was constantly being drained out of my system.  I could not live with periods that lasted up to 5 weeks at a time any longer or the fatigue from the anemia.

I certainly had everything else!  The mood swings_ anxiety and depression are the worst of the symptoms.  Normally_I am very much in control of my emotions.  After taking the pill for about 2 weeks_ I started losing control of them.  I cry for no reason and just stare into space.  I cannot be excited about anything and before this pill_ I was such a lover of life.  This pill has really effected my relationships with my family and I hate it.  I stopped taking it in the middle of the cycle (2 days ago) because I just could not stand it anymore.  I took it so that I would stop bleeding because my period was lasting about two weeks_ stopping for a couple of days and coming back full force again.  I had to get to the point that I do not care about the bleeding.

I liked the idea of four periods a year but this is negated due to the fact that I have constant_ heavy breakthrough bleeding; it's even worse than my normal periods. I have low Iron_ so I thought Seasonale would be a good choice but the heavy_ constant bleeding is causing my Iron levels to lower even more. This has been going on almost the entire 2 months that I've been on Seasonale. My moods are insane - I don't feel at all like myself; I'm ridiculously irritable and I have zero interest in doing anything anymore. Plus_ I've gained a ton of weight in a very short period of time and I feel bloated almost constantly.

133, 1, Heavy periods_ clotting,Nausea_ light-headedness_ fatigue_ vertigo_ breakthrough bleeding_ mild cramps_ slight weight gain.,I started Seasonale 5 weeks ago and I have had continuous bleeding for the whole 5 weeks_ some days very light (spotting)_ other days enough to need a tampon.  But what is really interrupting my lifestyle is the nausea_ light-headedness and fatigue.  Even the thought of food is repulsive to me_ so I'll go 6 or 7 hours without eating.  When I realize my stomach is really empty_ I'll binge on the first food I can find_ which is usually something from the nearest drive-thru because I am too fatigued to prepare meals.  Hence the slight weight gain (which I'm afraid won't be so slight if I continue on this pill).  At first I thought the light-headedness was connected to my irregular eating patterns (blood sugar roller coaster).  But now I think it's beyond that.  My boss sent me home from work the other day because I was dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out.  And most days I have to take a nap in my car at lunch time_ just to get through my work day.  My family doctor put me on this pill to address my heavy periods_ clotting_ and severe cramps that were disruptive to my lifestyle.  She then made an appointment for me to see a gynacologist (there's a long waiting list in Canada - it can take 6-9 months to see an OB/GYN_ unless you're pregnant).  Somehow I got in in 3 months (cancellation?) and my appointment is next week.

After the first three months_ the spotting went away and it has been excellent ever since.  I have had elevated triglycerides (makes my cholesterol count higher) but that's a side effect I seem to get with all birth control pills I've been on.  No longer needing tampons and maxis is great!

137, 4, birth control,The only side effect I experience is severe breast tenderness with extremely sensitive nipples.  Worse than when I was pregnant_ almost. I do get more headaches than usual_ but I always do from the heat anyway so I am not sure if the headaches are from the birthcontrol yet.,I_ so far_ like this birth control.  I do not have mood swings like all the other birth controls.  I was on a non-hormonal birth control called Letera and I loved it but I found out my insurance covers the Seasonale.  I thought what the hey_ I'll try it.  I had no spotting and I even went from Letera straight to Seasonale_ skipping my period.,F,26,14  days 1X D,7/4/2010,Seasonale

My joints like my knees_ankles_wrist_back_and neck will just have sharp pains for no reason. But the worst thing besides my headaches is the pain in my legs_ It felt as if my musles were going to burst and the vains felt like they were on fire!! Not taken any after last night.

I just realized this morning why I keep getting yeast infections.  I was bleeding heavily into the first 2.5 weeks and then have not had any issues with spotting.  I already have issues with Migraines - so have not noticed increased issues with those.  It was the other effects that came out of NOWHERE that I was shocked about.  Literally falling asleep while driving_ not being able to do anything but work or sleep_ going to bathroom immediately after I eat something.

I also don't think it's normal that literally all I want to do all day_ every day_ is EAT. I have had to start carrying gum with me or else I will shove whatever food I can find in there. Also_ I will be in a fine mood one second_ but someone can say something completely normal and I will flip my lid.

I have gotten down to 147 only to weigh 153 the following day. I have experienced acne that I only experienced during my first pregnancy because my hormones were raging.

I found that it did go away for a few days but came back even into the 4th week. I have been gaining weight before taking the pill_ but found that I have gained an additional 2-3 lbs. since taking the pill_ probably due to the cravings I have since taking the pill. I found that I will have cravings for different things and will stuff my face with food even though I am really full. I do tend to overeat sometimes_ but not to this extent. Also_ I am generally an emotional person_ especially a few weeks before starting my period. However_ with this pill_ I have found that I am emotional more often and have found that my feelings of irritability and anger have doubled and are almost uncontrollable. Also_ I have found that I have feelings of restlessness where I will sigh often and shake my legs for no apparent reason. I am planning on consulting my doctor about this and am considering going off the pill as I am beginning to be really mean and snappy with my co-workers.

Then_ about three months later_ I started gaining weight_ which is weird because I am a triathlete and marathon runner.  I work out a lot and monitor what I eat.  I have gained a total of five pounds for just about no reason and have not been able to get them off.  Joined weight watchers and starved for about three weeks and lost 1 lb_ which was suddenly gained back.  Also_ the spotting in unpredictable and the doctor was seeminly unconcerned_ the second I do not take a pill_ I get my period almost instantly!!  I am not sure how healthy this pill is in the long run and I am getting off immediatly!!  I am done gaining weight.  Another side effect is that I am tired and angry most of the time!!  Wonderful!

Weight gain may be an issue_ but college has also disrupted my healthy diet.,Birth control affects different people in all kinds of different ways_ so there's no point in definitely recommending it or not to another user.

I became very emotional which is not like me - it took me a couple months to level out. I gained about 10-15 lbs- which I can not seem to lose.

I took that until I was 20 with no major side effects. The idea of having 4 periods a year seemed really good_ so I switched to Seasonale. I have always been very thin (5'8"" 115 lbs) without working out and not paying attention to what I eat_ but I gained 15 lbs almost instantly. I had to bust my butt and eat super healthy to lose the weight and I still didn't lose all of it. I also started feeling dizzy and nauseous all the time_ and little things started to make me angry and sad. Things that would not have bothered me before! My sex drive decreased over time. Worst of all_ I started having puzzling and painful joint pain. I had no clue what it could be from. But now after some research_ I see that other people started experiencing joint pain too. Sure enough_ I realized it started shortly after I started taking Seasonale! I also had quite a bit of breakthrough bleeding. It was never quite the full 3 months without any periods. I will be switching back Microgestin soon!",F,22,2  years 1X D,2/27/2010,Seasonale
162, 5, Less periods,None,I originally started taking Seasonale to lessen the amount of periods each year.  Since I began taking this birth control I have had no breakthrough bleeding whatsoever.

I have always weighed 112_ even bounced back to that 2 wks after I had my daughter. Now my very small frame is 10 lbs heavier and I can only lose a lb or so of water weight then it comes right back. I've been working my butt off working out and making good eating choices and nothing is happening. I've also been so emotional I can cry at anything all the time. So much so I took pregnancy tests wondering what is wrong with me. I thought I was being vein if I quit a great pill that gave me no breakthrough bleeding and only 4 periods a year over weight gain. Now I'm so moody it's like PMS'ing All the time. I can't wait to get in to my Dr and go to Ortho 777 again...more periods but hopefully I'll feel like myself again.,F,35,3  years 1X D,2/17/2010Email,Seasonale

But I have gained about 8 pounds_ which I cannot lose_ even after very low calorie diet and workouts. I am also having headaches every day_ not too severe_ but still annoying. I am being treated for depression but it seems like it's not working_ I feel depressed_ tired_ demotivated and generally crappy. Now I am seeing here that this pill may be the reason as I was fine before I started it. I am going to see the doc next week so I will definitely go back to ortho-tricyclen generic.

Most notably_ I'm nauseous all the time and I constantly feel like I'm on my period with the weight gain & bloatiness and severe breast tenderness. All of it isn't worth it.

Quit smoking even_ so that I could take the birth control pill.  It started wit spotting about a week and a half in.  Went to NYC with my boyfriend and I'm sure the maids thought someone had been murdered in the bed! I haven't stopped bleeding for 9 days (full period_ not just spotting) and the tissue discharge is alarming.  My boyfriend is a paramedic and he can't believe I am taking this drug.  I have been so weepy and sad.  Have gained weight_ have had bouts of vertigo while driving!!! angry_ very lazy (unlike me completely) Don't want to do a damn thing.... I really will put up with 12 periods a year. I am quitting this today.  It is serioiusly dangerous for me...

168, 1, birth control,8 1/2 week non stop heavy period_ tired_ weight gain,I started taking seasonale 8 weeks after having my last baby. One week into it my period started. Not spotting_like they say_ but a HEAVY flow period. It lasted 11 days_ stopped 3 days and started right back up. Then stopped for a small bit then a nonstop period for 8 1/2 weeks straight. Dr said this can happen the first 3 months with some people. I quit taking it soon as the 3 months was done. period stopped immediately. But my cycle has been 30-54 days apart since. I cant get regular. I couldn't loose ANY baby weight. soon as i stopped I lost 15 lbs in one month (no effort just to see) and in the last 6 months 40 lbs total (not changing eating habits or anything). I have always been back to 118lbs within 6 months after having a baby but this caused my body to hang onto each ounce until I got off it. Out of all the different birth controls I have been on_ my body reacted the worst to this one. May be good for others but not me. Hate spermicidal and condoms but at least they work and don't have the same side effects.,F,29,3  months,1/23/2010Email,Seasonale

Good news_ ladies: I've been off for 2 weeks now_ and I feel like a new woman! My husband says it's like we're dating again! I also feel more optimistic_ my skin is tighter_ and even though my breasts have gotten smaller already_ I feel more womanly than ever.

I am normally a very upbeat_ energetic person who loves to socialize but lately I have been depressed_ quiet_ bitchy_ and not fun to be around.  I am going to throw these pills away as soon as I can and never take them again.  HORRIBLE!!! I am glad that I found this website.

176, 2, Birth Control_ Lessen Migraines,Passing large pieces of endometrial tissue_ Spotting at 8-11 weeks into pack_ weight gain,I originally started taking seasonale to decrease the number of periods I get thereby decreasing the number of hormone triggered migraines I experience.  That worked well for that purpose.  However_ I have twice now experienced passing of large pieces of uterine lining (endometrial) tissue.  It's gross and makes me very worried.  The doctors don't say much about it and don't do much to ease my worries.  I am going to switch BC.  My body obviously needs to get rid of this tissue at normal periods_ not just every 3 months.

179, 2, Jolessa,I have been having the btb it lasted the whole 3rd month of taking it. At first it was a little not much unless I wiped then it got to the point where it got more and I had to wear a pad for a few weeks I had to and then I took the inactive pills for the period week and when and the spotting stopped once I was on the active pills again. I have gotten a yeast infection from taking these pills in the 2nd month and now I am in the 4th month and I feel another yeast infection coming on..I think I am done with these pills. I haven't gained any weight from them..I feel more hungry since I have been on them. I am more tired now as well but I am not sure if that is from the pills or the low iron I have but could be a mixture of both. I think I would rather deal with the monthly 3 to 4 day light period then the spotting for a month and then the period..no thanks..I don't think I want to stay on it long enough to see if I don't get anymore symptoms cause I cant deal with any more yeast infection,I will not recommend them and as soon as I can I am getting an appointment with my doctor and talking about what other kinds of birth control I can take but I don't see any others I really want...I have tried them all and have not found one I was happy with. I have been on the pill at first messed up and got pregnant with my now 7 year old. I have been on the depo shot gained weigh_ para guard IUD and my periods were extremely heavy it was so bad I couldn't wear a super tampon with out bleed through it in a couple hours_ I have been on the patch but where women have died from it I stopped using it. so I have no clue what other birth control to try next..I might just say hell with it and just not use any.,F,29,4  months,12/4/2009,Seasonale

Cystic acne and headaches.,Thanks to everyone that posted - it made my decision to end taking this painful drug so much easier.  I thought 4 periods a year would be a great benefit to helping with my low iron levels.  It simply is not worth 10lbs weight gain (and that's with me working out and eating well_ I shudder to think how much it would be if I didn't)the cramping_ the acne and the random headaches.  Bring on 12 periods_ at least you know what you are getting.  I would like to know if the weight comes off when you go off the pill?,F,41,7  months,11/19/2009Email,Seasonale
183, 1, birth control,experienced terrrible migraines_ breast tenderness & weight gain.,I went on seasonale because my doctor recommended it.  He said it had good side effects and would reduce my risk for ovarian and cervical cancer. I would never recommend it!!,F,38,120  days,11/18/2009,Seasonale
184, 3, Prevent pregnacy,Weight gain,The first 2 days taking this pill_ I felt a little uneasy in my stomach_ but that went away very quickly.  The worst side effect was weight gain.  I gained 5 pounds_ which isn't horrible_ but I am doing everything in my power to lose them and they are just not coming off!(cardio 6 times a week and weight lifting 3 times a week_ calorie intake about 1000 - 1300 daily).  I have 7 days left of the active pills_ and just got some break through bleeding this morning_ not much_ just notice some blood when I use the bathroom.,F,27,3  months,11/13/2009,Seasonale
185, 3, birth control_ less periods,weight gain_ mood swings and minor depression_ breakthrough bleeding,I have been on the pill since I was 13_ due to very irregular and heavy bleeding. I started off taking a monthly cycle pill_ then switched to the generic version of Seasonale (Jolessa) because I wanted only 4 periods a year. During some cycles I would have breakthrough bleeding in the month leading up to my period_ but sometimes the cycle would work perfectly with no bleeding. Even after switching to the brand name_ it was still hit or miss with the cycles. I was also very thin and could eat whatever I wanted without exercising. After I started Seasonale_ I gained almost 15 lbs_ and it was a little bit of a struggle for me to go back down to my previous weight. I had to really watch what I ate and exercise 7 times a week with cardio and weights. I went from being a happy-go-lucky person to someone that cried over the fairly small things. The weight and emotional side effects seem to be under control for now_ though. I do enjoy only having 4 periods a year (when the cycle actually works right)_ but I may switch back to monthly if the breakthrough bleeding doesn't stop since I've already been on it for almost 2 years now.,F,21,21  months,11/11/2009,Seasonale

188, 1, birth control,uncontrollable mood swings_ depression_ severe break outs_ no energy_ vaginal dryness_ weight gain,I am SOOOOO glad I found this website! Thank you to every one who posted. I have been on this birth control for 2 weeks now. Within days I had an unexplained emotional breakdown where I cried ALL DAY LONG. I have been so moody that my boyfriend was the one who suggested that it might be the birth control. I am usually pretty level_ but i even cried over a commercial the other day! I have been completely exhausted...to the point that I considered asking my doctor to do a thyroid test. I don't want to do anything but lay on the couch_ and that is not an option for me! And my skin!!! I have never really had a problem with breakouts...ever...in fact_ people always comment on how even my complection is_ but as soon as i started taking this I got deep pimples on my face and in my hairline and scalp. Even the prescription topical benzaclin (which I got from the dermatologist as a result of these breakouts) did not phase it. To top everything off_ I am extremely dry which makes sex less than enjoyable. What's the point of taking this crap if I can't be intimate when I want to?? Also_ a trip to the doctor revealed that i have gained about 3 pounds in the last 2 weeks. I will quit taking this pill tomorrow. It is not worth the side affects. At least I can reverse these side affects now...before I've gained 40 pounds! DON'T TAKE THIS PILL!!!,F,31,2  weeks,10/26/2009,Seasonale

193, 1, birth control_ regular periods,Breast tenderness_ brief worsening of acne_ moodiness_ low energy_ three weeks of breakthrough bleeding,When I started taking this pill I stumbled on this site_ I didn't think any of the discussed side effects would happen to me. And at first they didn't and I thought the pill was great. Then week 7 into taking the pill I started my period. Before my periods were always short (3-5 days) and no cramps. I had breakthrough bleeding for 19 days before I just stopped taking it. My doctor gave me no clue that this would happen though apparently it happens to 1/3 of the women taking it. If I had known I would have simply taken to monthly pill. I've been off the pill for a week and my mood is completely better (something I didn't even realize was wrong until after I stopped taking it). Before you take this pill_ research it as much as you can to see if it is for you.,F,19,10  weeks,10/9/2009,Seasonale
194, 3, birth control_ endometreosis_anemia,Horrible spotting for the first 2 1/2 weeks. I wouldn't even call it spotting_ more like a full blown period. ruined most of my panties :( EXTREME nausea. Mood swings_ breast tenderness.,I am taking the Generic Quasense. For about the first 2 1/2-3 weeks i had horrible breakthrough bleeding. Completley ruined most of my panties :( and I Couldn't have sex because of it_ which was killing me because i have a very high libido (which my boy loves :)) This is probably due to the inconsistancy of taking it though. After about the third week though it completely stopped. HALELUJAH! Started taking the pill EXACTLY the same time every day which seems to have helped a LOT. The only other problems i have had with this pill is EXTREME nausea in the mornings. I have to take this pill either when i wake up or before 4pm and must take it with a meal. If i take it in the evening i ALWAYS wake up the next morning at about 6am with my heart racing_ sweating_ and end up in the toilet for hours followed by a constant headache all day. I've also had some breast tenderness_ but i won't really complain because my breasts have continually seemed to be getting bigger:) I'm about 107 lbs_ and have yet to gain any weight_ which is also a plus. I do not work out_ but i generally have a low calorie intake due to stomach ulcers. Honestly_ at first this pill was hell. I didn't want to take it at all due to the nausea. but After consistently taking it at the same time every day most of these side effects have gone away and everything seems to be getting better. You just have to let your body get used to these things. I would still recommend sticking with this pill for at least a month no ma,F,19,1  months,10/7/2009,Seasonale

This is the first pack and I have had severe cramping_ back cramps and a very heavy flow with huge clots.  I'm considering going off since it is not doing what i thought it would do.  I feel helpless and my doc is not understanding at all so i can't even have a discusssion about it.  I do have a fibroid but he says bec of location that that is not causing the heavy bleeding.

I've been on it for 2 1/2 months and I've had my period for almost the whole time. I'm miserable and snappy and I'm always hungry and gained weight.

After reading everyones similar experiences here_ it all made sense!My weight is out of control. I refuse to buy larger clothes in fear of allowing it to happen. I reduced my calorie intake to below 1500 a day_ sometimes 1000 and it wouldn't help. If I would loose any weight at all it was between 1-3 lbs! I was freakin starving! How come I couldn't loose the weight!? None of it made sense! I have finally decided after much consideration that I officially quit today. No more-It isn't worth it.

Smooth sailing until week 5 with daily cramping and mild breakthrough bleeding which has now lasted 14 days. Can't deal with the btb and continual crampy feelings and other PMS symptoms. I have decided to discontinue use of this medication_ as for me personally the negative side effects far outway any potential benefit of only having a period 4 months out of the year. I'm glad this medication works for some_ but as for those who have quit using Quasense_ how quickly does this medication leave your system? I am quite anxious to get some relief...,,F,39,7  weeks,8/28/2009Email,Seasonale

The mood swings are gone_ I was having horrible anxiety/panic attacks and this was like a wonder drug to cure all of the symptoms. No weight gain_ no side effects at all.

After 4 years of taking this pill_ dieting_ and exercising I am 140 pounds. Now I am short and fat. Even with weight lifting and cardio every day and a strict diet_ I would only loss 5 pounds. Then I would give up_ and it would all come back plus some. I went to my doctors every 6 months for thyroid testing_ and the results would come back normal. I am so tired all the time even though I get over 8 hours of sleep every night. I have a really great life_ but I have major depression and anxiety issues that I never had before. I have terrible mood swings that always center round the four periods a year. I am going off these pills immediately. I never realized these pills might be the cause of all these problems. I am never going on another birth control again. I am so excited that I might get to be my old self again. Pros about the pills: I will miss only having 4 periods a year. I will miss only having to buy one or two boxes of tampons and pads a year. But I will never ever go on this pill again.,F,26,4  years,8/22/2009,Seasonale

My doctor said that my spotting was probably due to the fact that I switched from my previous medicine regiment for endometriosis (was taking 300 mg of progesterone 10X a month for the past 3 years_ now taking this low dose pill).  I wanted to have less periods so that I could have less days of pain with my endo.  I'm in my 7th week now and I feel back to my normal self_ but I'm still rating a 3 because I haven't even finished my first pack yet.

212, 1, regulate period,extreme fatigue_ mood swings_ depression_ spotting_ bloating_ joint pains...??,When I started I thought it was great and had hardly any spotting. Of course I didn't attribute any of the side effect to the seasonale until I read all these comments!! I really thought something was seriously wrong with me and I'd even made a doctors appointment! I have a bloated stomach and have weight gain even though I've always been tiny no matter what I eat_ I'm extremely tired and have been taking naps almost every day_ I start crying for no reason or feel tears prickling my eyes when I'm just having a convo_ I'm depressed quite often and my parents keep wondering whats going on in my life when nothings wrong... This seems to explain it all. Also about a month ago I had a weird cramp in my side and then I got this weird rash on my thighs and wrist about 4 days later. Then the next day my joints were all stiff and I had a red streak up my wrists that looked like someone had slapped me there. Then it just kept getting worse until my knee swelled up and I could hardly walk on it so we went to the hospital and doctors_ but no one could figure it out and eventually it just went away on its own... Could this have been from seasonale? Maybe not_ but DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL. These side effects freak me out. That shouldn't happen.,F,18,6  months,8/3/2009,Seasonale
213, 4, Prevent Pregnancy,spotting_ moodiness_ tender breasts,I have been on Seasonale generic for about 3 years now. I did have spotting at first_ but after a few months_ I was period free. Seasonale helped with my acne_ made my breasts larger_ and I actually lost weight. It also helped with my PMS. I do occasionally spot_ but it's usually only a few days. Sorry that so many women have had a negative experience with it_ as having only a few periods a year is fantastic. It also has the highest effectiveness against pregnancy.,F,23,3  years,7/30/2009,Seasonale

215, 1, birth control,spotting_ mood swings_ zero sex drive,I took seasonale for nine months before finally switching because I couldn't handle it anymore.  The first month was always fine_ but about six weeks into the pack I started spotting and would spot every single day until the end of the pack -- another six weeks!  I hated it!  I'd rather have my period once a month than spot every single day.  I also had worse mood swings than the one I'm on now and had absolutely no desire for sex_ which could have also been related to my stressful job_ but still_ I don't think this BC helped.  I was trying to wait it out to see if my body would adjust but after three packs I gave up.  The daily spotting was the worst.,F,28,9  months,7/22/2009,Seasonale
216, 2, birth control,weight gain_ mood swings,I have been on jolessa (generic form of seasonale) for about a month. I am considering stopping due to weight gain.

I weighed the same amount for 5 years before immediately gaining 7 pounds in the first month on seasonale.

217, 5, Birth control,very little spotting during the first year.,I've been taking seasonale for a while now after switching from ortho tri cyclen lo. I wanted a birth control that would allow me to have 4 periods a year. The first year I experienced spotting and at one point had a medium to heavy period for a month. Needless to say it was not enjoyable but after my body adjusted I've had little to no spotting_ light_ short periods_ and no other side effects. I've noticed with my body that it takes me about 6 mos to a year to adjust to a new birth control (seasonale is my 3rd kind I've taken). My advice is to try out different kinds of birth control under the supervision of your doctor and see what works best for you.,F,23,3.5  years,7/20/2009,Seasonale

Have been on this pill for 3 mnths and I am stopping today. have gained 10 lbs even while workng out 3-5 days a week and eating healthy. I have even started seeing a counselor for my suicidal thoughts that I have NEVER had before.

223, 3, Birth Control,The pharmacy gave me Jolessa_ which is the generic form of Seasonale_ and I started my period on a Saturday_ so I was 2 days into my period before I took my first pill.  My period went for 7 days which is normal for me.  Then it stopped for a week.  Then I started to get spotting of brown blood.  I thought this was normal_ because they warned me about this happening. Then I wasn't SUPPOSE to not have a period that month.  I ended up having it though.  Which I still thought was normal_ because my body was still adjusting to it.  But it has now lasted for over a month.  When I was suppose to skip over my next period after that It just got heavier.  I'm now starting week 11 tomorrow_ but If it still is like this on my next pack_ I might switch to another birth control.,A friend of mine who supports Planned Parenthood told me they might have given me too weak a dosage because that's what they do for everyone to see how your body takes it.  It sucks having a period for SOOOO long.  The reason why I started taking this is to only have a period 4 times a year!  Way to get my hopes up.I wonder what the difference is between Seasonale and Seasonique?  Maybe the latter is a little better?,F,23,10  weeks,7/11/2009Email,Seasonale

We can't have anymore kids_ but I went on BC for convenience of less periods_ lessen my heavy cramps and shorter periods. The first 6 weeks were perfect...though I did notice my face broke out (and it NEVER EVER did before). On 2 occassions I forgot to take the pill and would take two. But at the end of week 6_ I started having spotting..no big deal b/c it was a side effect...but I am now almost done with my 7th week and it went from not worrying_ to pantyliners_ now wearing sanitary napkins/tampons. My cramps have been continuous and dull up til today when it has gotten worse. I called my gyno right away. I peed in a cup_ they did an exam_ an ultrasound and everything checked out so far. They also took blood_ and he told me to keep taking it til they get results in next week. I was going on a biz trip in Barbados and DO NOT want to worry about accidental spottings and cramps the whole time! I dont know why I have to keep taking it if it's really not a necessity for me. So I'm going to stop taking it til my results come_ and see what he says. I work out 3days a week_ drink lots of water and do body cleansing...and my weight won't budge_ I feel bloated_ my pooch has grown though I have been busting my ass working out and eating right. Started noticing in the last few days I am TIRED in the middle of the day and have to nap! This is all so not me.

Working out and eating really well and not dropping a single pound was enormously frustrating...been off for a couple weeks now and breasts slowly shrinking and slowly dropping pounds. Heartburn was HORRIBLE and ended almost immediately after stopping.  Sex was less painful while taking which was a plus.  Unfortunately this hasn't completely resolved endomet... but I would never go back on this for weight gain & heartburn.,F,37,3  months,6/11/2009,Seasonale
229, 1, Hormones & lower period frequency,Weight gain_ bloating_ mood swings_ depression.,"I thought this was going to be some sort of miracle pill - only getting my period 4 times per year??  Sounded wonderful...till I started taking it.  During the first pill pack_ I had my period for just about 6 weeks.  My doctor told me to continue taking it & that my body needed to adjust to it.  I started the second pack & noticed a whole other bunch of side effects.  I'm 5'2"" & work out 6 days per week_ 2 of which are with a personal trainer.  I was extremely fit.  Since taking the pill_ I have gained over 10 lbs & my stomach is painfully bloated.  I cry constantly & feel like I could seriously kill someone.  I recently stopped taking it & I can see/feel the difference already.  I don't feel bloated or emotional.  I think I'll just go back to getting my period every month - the benefit of 4 periods a year just don't outweigh all these awful side effects.",F,30,6  months,6/10/2009,Seasonale
230, 1, stop period to help anemia,horrible mood swings,After two weeks on seasonale_ I was a raging bitch!  I stuck it out for a full month to see if it passed or was just a coincidence.  NOT A COINCIDENCE_ I felt better within 2-3 days of stopping.  My hematologist told me to try again (he really wants me to not have a period or blood loss b/c I am severly anemic).  So 4 months after I stopped_ I started again and was a moody basket case within 10 days of re-starting. I am so glad I found this site because now I know I'm not alone.  I switched to loestrin and it's ok so far (3 weeks).,F,32,1.5  months,6/9/2009,Seasonale
231, 5, birth control,none.,i love this pill. i think getting my period every 3 months is a lot nicer!! i didn't experience any side effects emotionally_ but since taking it i've had a lot of trouble with my joints in my knees and shoulders being sore. i'm wondering if it's because of the pill or something else. but nothing else would really explain it?! oh well. still only 1 period every 3 months!!,F,19,3  months,6/8/2009,Seasonale
232, 1, birth control,Weight gain (approx 1 pound per week)_ extreme mood swings_ depression_ headaches_ bloating/gas_ intestinal pain.,I haven't gained a pound for the past couple of years and as soon as I started Seasonale_ I started to put on weight (same diet_ etc).  Also had a ridiculous number of headaches and became a mega bitch (and I'm SO not a bitchy person!). After 5 weeks on Seasonale I've had enough - I'm now switching and am going to give YAZ a try.,F,34,5  weeks,5/31/2009Email,Seasonale
233, 3, birth control_ fewer periods,mood swings_ depression_ migraines_ anxiety/panic attacks_ irregular bleeding (sometimes a lot_ sometimes non-existent)_ fluctuations in libido.,when I started the first pack_ i bleed heavily for 4 weeks straight. 3 packs later_ sometime i get a period_ sometimes not. it's very inconsistent. when i first started_ i had absolutely zero libido with uncomfortable vaginal dryness that made sex painful_ now I'm like a sex crazed maniac even my bf can't keep up with me. the fluctuations in libido are disturbing. I've also experience severe depression with suicidal ideations_ chronic fatigue_ lack of energy_ crying for no reason ( i will be driving on the highway and all of a sudden i'm crying hysterically)_ i'm a total bitch to everyone and my patience is non existent. I have never gotten migraines and it's been so bad recently that I've missed work because i was bedriiden and afraid to move or open my eyes out of fear of making the headaches worse. I get anxious about everything and panic over every little thing that has the potential to go wrong. My bf and I had initially contributed all of these symptoms to stress with work and school but after reading all your comments_ it all makes sense. I'm still waiting for the bigger boobs that some of you have talked about here... so far nothing. it does its job but the price you pay in interpersonal relationships and mental health is not quite worth it.,F,27,10  months,5/28/2009,Seasonale
234, 2, BC,severe depression_ weight gain_ acne_ low libido,I did not get breakthrough bleeding_ but it caused me to be severely depressed to the point of not being able to get out of bed in the morning_ crying constantly_ feeling worthless_ etc.  Plus it gave my deep cystic acne on my face.,F,23,3  years,5/27/2009,Seasonale
235, 2, Birth control,severe mood swings_ bleeding,This is the first birth control I've ever been on.  First week was fine_ second week I had 6 days of light brown bleeding_ constant dull headaches_ and SEVERE mood swings!  I got married 6 weeks ago_ started taking these 2 1/2 weeks ago_ and this last week has been terrible. Happy one minute_ then literally 10 minutes later_ crying_ resenting my husband_ feeling unloved and appreciated for no reason.....it has been terrible.  It just made me feel weird and a little depressed_ which is not my normal personality.  I've been off it for 2 days and already can tell a HUGE difference - and so can my husband!,F,33,2  weeks,5/17/2009Email,Seasonale
236, 1, PMS and Hormone Regulation,EXTREME IRRITABILITY! SO ANGRY AND SUCH A BAD TEMPER. Even on my worst PMS days_ I was a little irritable_ but this takes the cake. I have never felt so bad_ and I have only been on this pill for 4 days. I would rather find ways to deal with PMS then take this pill and hate the world.,,F,30,4  days,5/14/2009,Seasonale

238, 5, Birth Control,Weight gain.  Not major_ but did notice a few pounds that I can't attribute to anything else,After struggling through several disastrous pills (Yaz was particularly bad_ but others too_ with bad acne_ moodiness_ breakthrough bleeding_ headaches) this one finally works.  Totally cleared up the acne and made my boobs bigger.,F,38,2  months,5/11/2009,Seasonale
239, 4, having severe cramps,hardly any side effectssome fatigue but nothing major,those of you having month long periods or whatever need to know that if spotting occurs for 4 days_ STOP TAKING IT because the body is wanting to have a period. after that you can resume taking it and everything will go back to normal. my doctor told me this,F,18,1  years,5/9/2009,Seasonale
240, 2, birth control_ hormonal regulation,Everything was fine until week 8_ and then out of the blue I became extremely depressed_ moody_ sad and tired.  This lasted for a week_ and at the end of the week I started the dreaded breakthrough bleeding!  It has lasted over 10 days now_ it dark brown_ light but I have to use a pad or tampon.  If I had known that Seasonale causes this I would never have taken it!!,don't take it!!,F,25,9  weeks,5/5/2009,Seasonale
241, 2, birth control_ less periods,I have been on this medication (switched from lo-ovral) For 8 weeks....Since the switch_ I have experienced increased acne on face and neck_ which i NEVER had before.  Breakthrough bleeding for more than 7 days.  low sex drive (probably due to the breakthrough bleeding)_ vaginal dryness_ cramping as if I were on my period. Weight gain...8 lbs in 2 weeks!!!,I am not going to finish my pack. I am switching back to my other BC today!!  Thank you all for sharing your experiences!  I needed to know what was going on...,F,29,60  days,5/4/2009,Seasonale
242, 5, birth control,none,a little break through bleeding the first month I was on it and one other time  1 1/2 years after being on it. I was nervous to try it after reading so many horrible reviews but I think it's the best BC for me. No weight gain_ no acne_ no cramps no mood swings,F,29,2  years,4/29/2009,Seasonale
243, 3, Wanted less periods,Unsure at this time..posibly weight gain_ moodiness_ tired,I have been on Jolessa(generic) for a few years and never attributed some of the things that have been happening to me to my pill..but after reading this web site I am stopping it immediately. I am gaining weight for no apparent reason_ which I cannot get rid of. I have complained to my Dr. about my mood swings_ she says it is not the pill_ but I am going to give it my own test. I am wondering if my crazy moods and tiredness are actually this pill and I was attributing it to having 2 small children. I started this pill right after the birth of my first son_ so really don't know if it is my life or this pill that is making me nuts! Will send an update after being off it for awhile. I have my hopes up because of what other people have said they have experienced!!,F,35,4  years,4/23/2009,Seasonale
244, 2, Birth Contol,Low Sex Drive_ Vaginal Dryness_ Fatige_ Mood Swings_ Weight Gain,I didn't realize that all my problems were coming from the Seasonale until my online pharmacy lost my perscription and by the time I got it I had to go a month without the pills.  I felt better than I had in years when I didn't take the pills.  With the Seasonale I am extreamly tired all the time_ moody_ have no sex drive and have vaginal dryness.  I'm switching to a new birth control as soon as I can.,F,34,3  years,4/22/2009,Seasonale
245, 1, ,bloating_ weight gain_ continuous spotting_ cramps,In three months I gained a significant amount of weight.  And I experienced spotting and cramps continuously.  It was almost like having my period everyday.  It was the worst bc I have ever taken.,F,26,3  months,4/20/2009,Seasonale
246, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain (10lbs in 2 months)_ low sex drive_ vaginal dryness_ the WORST cramps ever_ acne_ oily skin_ bloating (my rings no longer fit),My doctor started me on Seasonale to help w/ my fairly severe premenstral migrains. Well_ it did help with those_ but the side effects are awful. I've never really gotten PMS cramps before. Now I've had the worst cramps for a month. My skin is like a pimply oil slick_ I've gained 10lbs of mostly belly fat for no reason_ my sex drive is practically gone_ my vagina is bone dry (not that it matters when you have 0 sex drive)_ my rings that I've worn for a decade no longer fit and I just don't feel right.,F,29,2  months,4/17/2009,Seasonale
247, 1, regulate periods,lengthy breakthrough bleeding_ weight gain_ mood swings_ bloating_ just about every other horrible thing you can think of,I switched to Quasense nine months ago - who doesn't want to have fewer periods_ right? Well_ not only have I gained 20+ pounds with no change to my lifestyle_ but I am only period-free two months of every cycle. I experience light to moderate bleeding for the remaining 4 weeks of active pills (which compeletely defeats the purpose of the pill)_ and the cramps and crazy-heavy flow during the last week of nonactive pills make me want to die. I have also experienced extreme mood swings/anxiety/agitation which I did not intitally attribute to this pill_ but after reading all these stories_ I have to wonder... Moral of the story: DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!!!  I'm going back to Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo_ I never had any problem with that one.,F,22,9  months,4/15/2009Email,Seasonale
248, 3, due to hormone problems a,I just recently start having break through spotting which is interfering with my love life.  I haven't missed a period but just about two weeks of breakthrough bleeding.,I have taken these before and no problems but now I don't know what is wrong.  I have to call my doctor to see what he say.,F,36,4  months,4/14/2009,Seasonale
249, 3, less periods/year,heavy bleeding_ extreme cramps_ severe mood swings,This is my first period since taking Seasonale. My period came 2 weeks early and the cramps beforehand were incredibly painful. There were large chunks of uterus lining in my period (more than had ever had before). Also_ the week before my period_ I had severe PMS_ but did not realize that it was PMS since my period was early. I'm not a person who cries often_ but I was crying on a daily basis_ about 3 times a day.,F,24,3  months,4/13/2009,Seasonale
250, 5, to get less periods,enlarged breasts and some tenderness,"So far so good. I've experienced no break-through bleeding but my doctor mentioned that if you do_ to stop taking it for about a week and let yourself have a ""mini-period"" as she called it. The breast tenderness isn't bad or anything_ it can just be annoying sometimes. Did NOT need bigger breasts but I won't complain.",F,36,7  weeks,4/10/2009,Seasonale
251, 5, Birth Control with less periods,Absolutely none! I love Seasonale!,I had no acne whatsoever being on Seasonale_ had absolutely no cramps before or during my periods_ my bleeding was very light and lasted only few days_ my periods came exactly on 28th day after the three month supply was finished_ I gained no weight or had no mood swings or anything like that. I only got off recently because we would like to have a family now. No problem getting off it either.,F,32,5  years,3/24/2009,Seasonale
252, 4, Bad periods,breakthrough bleeding and headaches first 2 or 3 months,I really liked it_ after I got through the first 3 months.  It was fantastic not having periods and PMS.  Only downside was the cost ($60/month with my insurance)_ which was ultimately why I stopped using it...had to go back on a generic b/c pill.,F,32,18  months,3/20/2009,Seasonale
253, 1, wanted fewer periods a yr,VERY HEAVY BLEEDING!!!,"I was on this birth control for only 3 months. When the time came that i was due to have my period i had such a scare. I was sitting on the couch watching tv and all of a sudden i felt my period. only it didnt feel like what i was used to. I ran to the bathroom and sat on the toilet and i began to pass very large blood clots and was bleeding SO much. I was soaking through 1 pad in about 20 minutes. It was pretty late at night so I called my ob gyn who was on call and she told me to go to the ER. I went to the ER where I continued to bleed extremely heavy. When I was finally taken back to see the ER doc i explained what was going on_ they did an internal u/s (very uncomfortable) which was fine and also some bloodwork which showed that i had a low blood count which he told me meant i had infact lost a lot of blood. in the end he told me i needed to follow up with my ob gyn but he suspected that my body could not handle not having a period for so long and when it finally came it was almost as if it was ""backed up"" which was why it was so heavy. i stopped the seasonale and went on YAZ and have been fine since.",F,23,3  months,3/19/2009,Seasonale
254, 3, Less periods,I haven't gained much_ if any_ weight while on this pill but every once in a while when I've already had my period for that three month time_ I start bleeding all over again. My cramps start happening too; it's like an extra period. It's happened to me twice before and I don't know why. I thought maybe it was a side effect of the pill_ but it is a horrible side effect. I went on this pill so I wouldn't have as many periods and they would be less painful but it isn't really working.,It helped with my acne and made some of my periods a bit lighter.,F,17,1.5  years,3/17/2009,Seasonale
255, 1, birth control_ heavy bleeding,I have been taking Seasonale since I was 16. I stopped for 8 months and things seemed to be fine_ I started on the medicine again 2 months ago. I have experienced severe mood swings_ depression_ and I have been feeling suicidal for the last 2 weeks. I cry several times a day. I have horrible heartburn every night also.,I would not suggest this medication for teenagers_ we already have so much going on with our bodies this medication is a roller coaster.,F,18,2  years,3/17/2009,Seasonale
256, 3, Hormone-related migraines,weight gain_ heartburn_ bleeding,I started taking Seasonale to control my hormone-related migraines. While the migraines are gone_ the weight gain and bloated feeling is bad. I have gained 8 lbs in 5 months_ which is very unusual for me. I have also been bleeding for the past 2 months. Sometimes just spotting_ other times heavier with cramps. I also have heartburn at night-never had it before.,F,46,5  months,3/14/2009,Seasonale
257, 2, Birth Control,weight gain_ mood swings_ break through bleeding,I think I am going to stop taking Seasonale because i have already gained 5 pounds and have had major mood swings_ not to mention breakthough bleeding. I was on the Nuvaring prior to this and didn't have any of these problems.,F,30,2  months,3/7/2009,Seasonale
258, 2, long_ heavy periods,weight gain_ bloating_ mood swings_ breakthrough bleeding,I thought i was going crazy because i haven't felt like myself since starting this pill. I have gained about 4 lbs_ feel bloated and have bled continuously since starting the pill. Now I think I am getting a yeast infection. I am going off this pill today...especially after reading all of your comments!,F,38,5  weeks,3/5/2009,Seasonale
259, 5, PMDD_ very heavy periods.,No negative side affects so far and I have had very bad luck with BC in the past. I have actually lost a few pounds since I started taking Jolessa (generic).,,F,34,1  months,3/1/2009Email,Seasonale
260, 2, to control heavy bleeding,severe weight gain over 30lbs in 1 year_ no sex drive_ fluid retention_ high blood pressure_ shortness of breath sometimes,I have been on this medicine for 1 year and have not had 1 period--i love that but do not love the weight gain. I made sure that I took the brand only on Seasonale because I had heard the generic was bad. I am going to switch to Yaz and see if that helps.,F,34,1  years,2/27/2009Email,Seasonale
261, 5, ovarian cyst,had break through bleeding in the first 3 months.,I think it works since being on seasonal I haven't had to had to have any surgeries_ to remove ovarian cyst. prior to this medication I had 3 invasive surgeries.  Not laproscopic as the cyst were too large to remove that way.,F,18,4  years,2/24/2009Email,Seasonale
262, 3, Less Periods,I never had any problems with seasonale such as mood swings_ weight gain_ acne or breast tenderness.  The only complaint is that when I lost my pills for a few days (foud them 2 days later) and then caught up taking my pills..ever since then_ I have been spotting (for almost two months now) other than those couple of days_ I take my pill regularly every day.,I am almost done with this pack and I will be switching to something else just for the mere fact that I hate the fear of spotting after missing one pill.,F,21,6  months,2/24/2009,Seasonale
263, 1, Birth Control,Mood swings/Irritability!!!!! heartburn_ dizziness_ fatigue_ mid-section weight gain_ depression_ heart palpitations_ anxiety/panic attacks_ headaches.,After a short time on Seasonale_ and after weeks of heavy spotting_ I experienced severe mood swings and this plethora of side effects. I am so surprised to see that all of what I was experiencing was all related to this one pill!!!! I had been very concerned about my declining health_ and am quite relieved that this is all from one source. My fiancé is quite relieved_ as I am not sure we would have made it to our wedding day otherwise... after 2 weeks of being on this I really changed... he kept saying that I am not the same person I was just weeks before about 2 weeks ago_ and I have only been on it for 5 weeks. I thought it was just stress until the depression and panic attacks set in this weekend... I am so done with this b/c!!! Thanks to everyone for putting in their feedback and making it so easy to understand why this b/c is NOT for me!,F,48,5  weeks,2/23/2009,Seasonale

265, 2, Birth control and endometriosis,Acne_ weight gain_ blood clots_ breast soreness.  My endometriosis pain is soooo much better.,I liked the idea of 4 periods per a year and my DR. felt it would help lessen the pain of my endometriosis. My endometriosis is better. Periods are not as bad_ pain is better no cramping all the time as before. The problems that I did not attridute to Seasonal until a friend told my she had the same problems on it and I read these reviews from were SEVERE acne_ and the weight gain. I gained 30 pounds even with going on crazy diets where I would lose 10 pounds only to get it back. I do eat healthy_ I am very active_ walk 2 to 3 times a week_ do all the yard work_ and I am a pre-k teacher. Like others have said before me I have never had a problem with weight before I started this medication. My hair did start falling out around the time I started on seasonal also. I didn't realize these problems might all be connected until I read this review. I have even been to several DRs with these concerns only to be told that I was fine get used to the acne_ try weight watchers it was normal for m,F,37,3.5  years,2/15/2009,Seasonale
266, 3, generic Joleesa,Bad acne on face and upper back_ rosacea_ loss of sex drive_ vaginal dryness_ slight weight gain_ neck stiffness_ increased facial hair_ fatigue,Positives: This worked great in the fact that my PMDD vanished and I became a less frantic and worried person.  My periods were light and I never spotted once over the 2 years I have been taking it. However_ the side effects I described and the fact that I have gained at least 10 pounds since I started using it_ even though I go to the gym 3 times a week are serious issues. I am switching to Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo.,F,39,2  years,2/11/2009,Seasonale
267, 3, birth control,breast soreness_ increased appetite for unhealthy/fatty foods_ more irritable/moody_ increased insomnia,I started the generic about 2 weeks ago and already have noticed ALOT of breast tenderness.  While I don't sleep well in the first place_ I used to be able to get at least 4-5hrs sleep w/out the use of a sleep aid_ now I need a sleeping pill to help me stay asleep for 4-5hrs.  I have not really noticed a weight gain yet_ but I have noticed I am craving unhealthy/fatty/salty foods more_ which is something I've never really been interested in consuming before. I've also noticed that I'm more depressed and have a more labile mood--some days are fine_ other days I feel really down.  I'm going to try it for a three month cycle to see if it gets better_ but if it doesn't_ I'll switch to something else.,F,22,2  weeks,2/10/2009,Seasonale

269, 5, Severe PMS and cramping,Massive weight gain & 40 day long period which only stopped because I went off of the Seasonale pill.,This is an update to my previous post.  Was on Seasonale for 2 months and bled almost the entire time.  Changed to Mirena IUD and it's been EXCELLENT.  Only Mirena side effect was increased breast size and had to buy new bras.,F,43,2  months,2/6/2009Email,Seasonale
270, 1, Birth Control,WHERE DO I BEGIN! I came to this site to seek answers of why I've experienced so many problems_ and I guess I'm not the only one! I've gained a sickening amount of weight_ I have terrible mood swings_ and my husband to atest to the fact that my sex drive is NON-EXSISTANT. This pill is terrible and I am discontinuing_ especially after realizing I'm not just crazy and there are others out there going through the same thing...,Don't try it. A period once a month is way better than the side effects that come along with this pill,F,27,1  years,2/3/2009,Seasonale
271, 2, Birth control_ severe period crampi,Bloating_ slight weight gain. The most noticeable side effect I've experienced has been SEVERE loss in sex drive and an increase in fatigue.,I've never had a problem with breakthrough bleeding_ and Seasonale did help alleviate the length and severity of my periods. However_ the sex drive issues alone are enough of a reason to stay away. Try a lower hormone pill like Yaz instead.,F,21,3  years,1/29/2009,Seasonale
272, 4, ,I have been taking Seasonale for the past 2 years. I am pretty happy with it. I had spotting for the first couple of months but it went away.Every pill makes you gain weight_ moody_ and all the other stuff everyone says.

I love it.,,F,24,2  years,1/28/2009,Seasonale

274, 3, ,YIKES!,I just started taking the generic Jolessa today and I decided to take a look at some patient comments_ WOW! WOW! AND WOW! I am petrified to take this pill! My Wedding is next month so my doc prescribed it to me today. What damage can be done_ I'm only planning on taking it for 1 month only-Suggestions? Is this going to make me break out? Gain weight? HELP! I'm getting married in 3 weeks,F,33,1  days,1/27/2009Email,Seasonale
275, 1, To avoid period every month,My doctor said that Seasonale would be fine for me to take.  However_ my body hasn't felt the same since taking it.  I have now been off of Seasonale for almost 2 years_ and most things have not gotten better.  While on Seasonale_ I gained a lot of weight_ had terrible mood swings_ ended up with migraines (never had a normal headache before taking it)_ was diagnosed with Vertigo because of severe dizziness_ numbness and tingling in my face_ tongue_ head_ and arms.  I've seen a neurologist and ear_ nose_ and throat specialist.  Since going off of Seasonale_ I lost the weight_ but still suffer from migraines_ anxiety attacks_ and dizziness.,I am also taking a prescription for the anxiety and dizziness.  I still don't feel like myself and I've had to change my lifestyle so much.  I can't be around crowds or go to amusements parks (because of the dizziness_ which I never had before taking this pill).  If anyone else out there has experienced these same problems_ I would appreciate if you could let me know.  I think it is very possible that this pill has severe_ long lasting side effects that are not mentioned.  And_ I feel that women should be aware and that the drug manufacturer should do something about it.,F,31,1.5  years,1/26/2009Email,Seasonale
276, 1, less periods,Oh my goodness_ where do I begin? I started taking seasonale to avoid having periods. I have experienced severe mood changes_ weight gain_ swollen ankles & anxiety attacks. Until i read this website i thought my body was shutting down.,,F,32,90  days,1/25/2009Email,Seasonale
277, 1, higher estrogen and fewer periods,I experienced weight gain_ constant breast tenderness_ mood swings_ and worst of all my hair was falling out and became very thin on top. I was also breaking out constantly.,I took the generic form for the whole 3 month cycle. I experienced heavy bleeding and clotting almost every other week that was worse than any period I have ever had.  I was also bruising easily.  I was on Yaz before this and switched only because I was missing periods.  Yaz had no other side effects for me_ am upset with my doctor for suggesting I switch to the Seasonale nightmare. Will go back on Yaz or another low dose BC. My dermatologist confirmed seasonale to be the cause of my breakouts and thinning hair.,F,29,3  months,1/22/2009,Seasonale
278, 4, Birth Control,CONS:  At first it seemed hard to lose weight.  I was eating right and working out_ but I just wasn't getting any benefits.  My weight_ however_ did not go above what it was before_ I was just kind of stuck at the weight.  My breasts are pretty tender still but I've just gotten used to it.  At first_ missing your period is scary and I did have to spend some money to buy pregnancy tests just to be sure that the pill was working and that I didn't miss my period due to a pregnancy_ but it did its job.PROS:  overall_ I like this pill.  I'm now working harder on what I eat and exercising and i AM losing weight.  I have not experienced any spotting at all in 3 months_ but I have an alarm set in my phone so I am sure to take it within 2 minutes of the same exact time everyday.  If you do this_ I believe you will not have any spotting.  The first couple months just take some getting used to_ but then your body adjusts.,,F,23,3  months,1/18/2009,Seasonale
279, 2, BC change: breakthrough bleeding,CON:  Extreme breast tenderness 21 days of spotting/bleeding; drop in sex drive; inability to orgasm; weight gain; dry skin; PRO: mood improvement from prior pill; less bad hair growth,I switched from Alesse (and previously Marvelon) due to constant breakthrough bleading.  Marvelon had made me crazy moody even screaming fits (really embarrassing).  Alesse improved this but still had difficulties with the breakthrough bleeding.  I was excited when my Dr. said I would have 3 periods a year but the side effects sent me running back for a change.  After the third week I began spotting and over the next 21 days had daily spotting which on some days was as heavy as a regular period.  During that time my breasts became so tender I could not roll over in bed without waking.  I have fibrocystic breast disease and the tenderness generally goes away with my cycle; this pill made it worse than before.  I have a generally super-high sex drive and this pill killed it_ even curtailing my ability to orgasm.  On a positive note although there were a few sensitive days during the first 3 weeks_ my emotions leveled out far better than on previous pills and my skin was clear,F,40,7  weeks,1/16/2009,Seasonale

I am now turning to Lupron. I have tried so many birth controls and this is the one with the worst symptoms. Please don't use this drug if you don't have a medical condition such as endometriosis.  Even then you should seriously consider other options.  The weight gain alone is frustrating.,F,27,2.5  years,1/15/2009,Seasonale

I took it for 6 weeks_ and spent the last 22 days bleeding. I've been off of it for 2 days and now my period is finally stopping. I already suffer from migraines_ but this pill definitely increased the frequency (a couple per week rather then 3-4 per month) and the intensity (thought I was having aneurysms).

I thought these were all random individual problems_ but reading this site it makes so much sense now. I've been depressed_ but just thought it was normal or I needed to change my meds. I've had jerky movements_ which I read is also a side effect and no sex drive at all. I feel relieved that I know why this is all happening_ but angry at the same time.

I skyrocketed up to 150lbs while on Seasonale. The sad part is_ it took me a while to realize what was going on because once I hit the age of 30 it seemed like my metabolism slowed down (as it has done with other members of my family_ so I assumed it was a fact of life). I still work out every day_ but feel disgusting and bloated. I am going off of it immediately!,F,32,6  months,12/28/2008,Seasonale

I've been up until 2-3am which isn't good considering I'm a mother of 2 year old. I've been going to the bathroom to pee like every 30 minutes. I even thought I was pregnant at some point_ but I wasn't. And this middle section pooch I got - I never had that. I do not recommend this pill. It's not worth it.

When i first began_ i spotted for about 2 months. After that my body got used to them and the spotting ceased. However_ i would get bad cramps toward the last two weeks of pills_ so i decided to alter how long i stayed on. I knocked it down from 11 weeks of hormones_ to 9 and things seemed better. However_ due to the constant estrogen for such prolonged periods_ i developed a belly pouch and side fat that would not go away until i stopped taking them. I was on Seasonale for 2 years_ switched to Yaz which was TERRIBLE_ and i just started back on Seasonique 2 months ago (seasonale was discontinued)and the pouch is returning.,F,28,2  years,12/17/2008,Seasonale

The fatigue and depression have gotten increasingly debilitating.  I never napped before taking the pill but for the last three weeks I have physically needed a nap everyday!  I cry at the drop of a hat and am extremely irritable toward everyone around me.  I am not in a relationship_ but I hardly ever think of sex and feel absolutely no desire to find a mate (which is something I do eventually want!).  The depression has gotten in the way of my nursing school studies and even my friendships.  I can't wait to be my normal self again!

294, 1, birth control,Major Anxiety_ shortness of breath_ heart palpatations_ dizziness_chest pain_ headaches,I switched from Seasoneque to the generic for Seasonale due to new ins. co. not wanting to pay for brand name drugs. They do not make a generic for Seasoneque yet_ so I asked my doctor to switch me to Seasonale. (the worst mistake I ever made) About 1 1/2 weeks after starting the new pills I began having shortness of breath. I ignored it but eventually my heart started palpitating. I was dizzy all the time and I started having chest pain. I ended up in the ER 2 different times. All my tests turned out normal. They do see the palpatations but do not feel they are dangerous. The doctors beleive the b/c pills caused a major hormonal change in my body and now two months later I am still having to deal with major anxiety symptoms. I just pray they go away soon because I am absolutly miserable. I do not recommend Seasonale's generic to anyone.,F,27, ,12/9/2008Email,Seasonale

I have been a very mean person. I had no idea that my issues were a direct result of Jolessa. I have been very mean to my kids_ suffered with low-self-esteem due to my weight gain_ not to mention I have nothing to wear that fits properly. My relationship with my boyfriend was ruined. I struggled with depression during my third semester in nursing school. I could NOT cope! I had to take time off. This cost me a year and much needed wages as a RN to take care of my family. DO NOT TAKE THIS! It is better to drop golf ball size clots once a month than to want to die. I am angry about this_ because my doctors indicated that I should exercise more and change my diet. This drug is like a demon from the pit of hell! Please do not take this. I wonder if they have been sued yet.,F,37,9  months,12/9/2008Email,Seasonale

I had contributed all of this to my age_ just thinking it was part of getting older_ until my doctor told me today it is more likely the result of taking this birth control pill.

328, 1, POLY CISTIC AND MIGRAINES,EXTENSIVE BLEED_ MOOD CHANGE_ SEX DRIVE CHANGE,I'm glad my doctor told me about this site.  Now I dont feel alone and like my body was disappointing me.  I took Seasonique for 3 months (1 pack)_ during that time I turned into a train wreck.  My moods were like a roller coaster_ one minute fine then crying or upset over nothing.  My heart would race even if I wasnt stressed and I seemed to stay hot all the time.  I started bleeding in my 2nd month and continued for 2 months.  At first I thought I could handle it and that it was just my body getting used to it but the flow seemed to get heavier as time went on making me weak.  I had absolutely no sex drive at all and it broke my heart everytime my b/f asked me if I was losing my feelings for him.  I've been switched to Yasmin for about a month now and seem to be doing fine.  When I was taking Seasonique I just didnt noticed the things that were happening to me until the switch.,F,23,3  months,8/13/2008,Seasonale
329, 3, Less periods,,I never had any blotching or bleeding. I'll bleed for maybe 3-4 days Light MAX. But outside of that I can't seem to get any weight off unless I go to severe dieting and my breasts have gotten much larger. I also have gotten to a point lately where my face will feel very odd and I get midly disoriented. I have noticed that I feel much more anxious and nervous while in public.I'm scared to take this pill any longer because I was off it for 1.5 weeks waiting to get a new pack and the first day I took the pill again_ it's almost like I can feel the drugs in my face.I'm getting off this pill for good. Besides_ having a period every 3 months is not normal.. I don't know why I never listened to my Dr. telling me it was ok to begin with.,F,31,2  years,8/12/2008,Seasonale
330, 1, fewer periods &cramps,weight gain_ loss of sex drive_ irritability_ heart palpatations_ sweating,I thought I was nuts and then I ready all the other comments.  Thank you for everyone who posted.  I'm posting to possibly help another person. First I was on Seasonale and then started taking the generic.  I am going back to Ortho 777.  I've been on the pill since I was 18 (i'm 35) to regulate my period and because nothing could touch the pain of cramps.  I get up every other morning and lift weights and then walk a mile and a half.  The other days I walk 2 miles.  I ride horses 3-5 times a week.  I cannot get this excess fat (and it is fat not muscle) off! I can bearly fit into my clothes.  Sometimes I just sweat for no reason.  I get slight heart palpatations and blurred vision.  Thanks to my husband for hanging in there because i have no sex drive! Everyone was seeming to piss me off for no reason.  My next appt with OBGYN is 9/11.  I cannot wait to throw this pill in the trash.,F,35,2  years,8/2/2008,Seasonale

In that time I gained 5 pounds while working out daily and not increasing my eating; my face also broke out really badly and continued to have new breakouts throughout the 5 weeks of being on the pill. I also experienced unusual dryness.  All symptoms began going away after a week on a different pill.,F,30,5  weeks,7/31/2008,Seasonale

I don't usually read these things but you guys are a mirror image of me!  I have been on generic Seasonale (Jolessa) for about 3 years and have changed for the worse all around!  I have gained 40 pounds when I never had a problem before_ couldn't sleep_ got ugly veins in my legs_ hot flashes_ all of the things you've listed - the only problem I do NOT have is bleeding. . .I feel stupid for not realizing all this was from the pill sooner!

333, 2, control migranes with fewer periods,extreme moodiness_ depression_ acne_ and breakthrough bleeding,This medicine did help with my period-induced migraines...if you aren't having as many periods_ you won't get the migraines associated with them_ but I was miserable while taking it.  I am normally a very happy-go-lucky person_ and I was so depressed while on this.  Of course_ it took five months to realize that this was the root of my problems_ but within a week of switching to another pill_ I am almost back to my old self.  ,F,26,6  months,7/29/2008,Seasonale

Other than that_ no problems so far.,I'm currently starting my 5th week (2nd month) of brand named Seasonale. I couldn't afford my usual Yaz last month so I started these.So far I haven't had any problems that I can really attribute to the pills. I'm a little more lazy_ but only fatigued in the morning. My sex drive is actually just a little bit better than before_ and I haven't gained any more weight than usual. I'd like to think I'm doing pretty good so far.Reading these reviews actually makes me really paranoid about continuing it_ and I might end up quitting it and going back to Yaz after the first cycle_ but I do really really really want this to work. The fact that right now I should be whimpering in pain on the bathroom floor from cramps_ but am not_ makes me really determined to make it work. Unfortunately my fears will probably take over and I'll end up switching in September.,F,19,5  weeks,7/28/2008Email,Seasonale

I have to wear a panty liner everyday because I just do not know when I might start bleeding no spotting_ I mean bleeding.  When I am on my last week_ the bleeding is even heavier.  It is driving me nuts.  I had less bleeding on my period then before this drugs.  I feel like a big dummy for even getting on this medication.  My husband said this having a period everyday is driving him nuts. This is destroying my sex life.  I'm always hesitant on having sex because having sex sometimes make the spotting heavier.  There has got to be something better.,,F,37,1  years,7/22/2008Email,Seasonale

Ever since I started Seasonale I've had acne problems and I hadn't had to deal with acne since my teen years.  Every day there was a new zit on my face.  The mood swing was also a really bad problem for me.  I was very bitchy to my poor family for the most minor things.  And normally I'm optimistic happy gal but I became this paranoid depressed person I didn't even recognize.  And lastly the weight gain.  I'm a healthy eater and exercise almost every day.  My weight has been on a good level for few years now but the two weeks I was on Seasonale I gained 7 lbs. and I didn't change my eating or exercise habit at all.  I'm very nervous about trying other BCP because they all seem to have similar side affects.,F,35,2  weeks,7/16/2008,Seasonale

I was fine on seasonale and seasonique...my insurance company wouldnt cover either and I have since been on generics.  They are awful.  I have a short fuse_ am always frustrated_ irrational - not myself.  Same story as most of the rest of you all.  My doctor told me he does not endorse generics for this type of bc method becuase the formulation can be so drastically different. I highly reccomend you fight with your insurance to give you the brand name - those two actually work!,F,25,3  years,7/2/2008,Seasonale
341, 1, Cysts_ fewer peroids,No sex drive_ very dry,Thank you all for your comments_ I too thought I was going crazy and something was wrong with me.  I totally lost my sex drive due to dryness mostly.  Mentally I wanted it - but it was way to painful_ I could not figure out what was wrong with me.  I visited my OBGYN a few times regarding this matter_ every time she said it was just me_ to relax_ have a glass of wine - use some lube.  Give me a break_ listen to your bodies_ you will know when something isn't right - I am doing my own research to determine which one will work for me_ seems good comments have been posted about Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ so I might give that a try.

My new doc suggested these and gave me to pack to try.  I finish my first pack next week and am not looking forward to starting the second one.  In the past 3 months i have began breaking out (not just on my face)_ i have gone up a cup size_ and have gained approximately 10 to 15 lbs.  I have not had any spotting or bleading this far and i am interested to see how next week goes and how bad I blead (or if i blead at all).  That will be the desiding point on if I am going back to my old pills or trying something else.,F,24,3  months,6/25/2008,Seasonale

After doing some research I learned that this medicine can actually lower the effectiveness of my medicine. I can't believe my doctor perscribed this to me. I have always had a clear and beautiful complexion_ after being on this bill for a week my face broke out.

344, 3, Less & lighter periods,acne_ sensitive stomach_ variable appetite_ variable sex drive,I took this pill for 3 cycles (9 months). The first cycle_ as expected_ there was some spotting_ but the next two cycles were great as far as that goes (I'm a good pill-taker_ 95% of the time at exactly the same time every day_ so this may have helped out with the regularity of periods and lack of spotting). My periods were far fewer_ much lighter and much less painful - big plus for me. On the negative side of things_ my stomach has been extremely sensitive. I have had 3 very severe stomach bugs since starting this pill (normally_ I can eat all sorts of food and am fine and it takes A LOT to get me sick) and this is the main reason that I am getting off of it. My appetite is really weak for the first half of the cycle and overly strong for the second half of the cycle_ same with boobs (very small first 1/2 of cycle_ big on second 1/2 of cycle). Another annoying thing I experienced. . . . I've always been very lucky with my skin - great complexion and very rarely have a pimple. Since b,F,24,9  months,6/18/2008,Seasonale

I'm going into week 3 of the daily bleeding.  Around the time I started bleeding_ I was put on antibiotics for a sinus infection_ so I don't know if the bleeding is a side effect of the antibiotic (one side effect listed is ""reduced effectiveness of birth control)_ or due to Seasonale.

I feel less anxious already.  My skin also seemed to get worse on this pill_ not better.  I guess the only plus is my breasts are slightly larger_ but thats not really that important to me.  Also_ TIRED_ falling asleep at my desk_ even with adequate sleep.  I feel like OB-GYNS prescribe this stuff without really discussing anything with me.

However_ about 1 year into taking the pills my period just did not want to go away.  I had my period for almost four months and my doctor told me in his professional opinion that yes this was the seasonale.  My body could not handle or readjust to all the chemical unbalance caused by this drug.  I ended up having a uterian ablasion done to stop the bleeding_ and at age 26 became unable to have children for the rest of my life!

After I went on this pill_ I started having 3 month periods.  I went off for 2 days to jump-start a normal period and hopefully have it over with.  Instead_ I had a 10 day period of extremely heavy flow and huge blood clots for the last 4 days.  It was so extreme that I couldn't do anything for several days.  Beyond that_ I had some of the worst breakouts of my life_ with acne appearing everywhere.  When I took the break from the pill for a few days to let the period begin_ the acne magically cleared up_ before coming back with a vengeance when I started the pill again.

I can't say I am 100% sure this was the cause of my depression but i cannot find any other explanation for it_ and believe me_ I have tried looking for one. The only explenation is taking the pill for 1week before it all went down.. Be very careful with this medication.,F,30,1  weeks,4/5/2008,Seasonale
368, 2, reduce heavy fibroid bleeding,Mood swings_ very low sex drive_ bleeding every day on it so far (2 weeks)_ cry easily_ nausea_ headaches,I'm taking this pill because I was getting super heavy periods (4 days long) every 21 days for last 4 years. Just found out it's because of fibroids_ but dr. said this would reduce the number of my periods and help with the anemia. So far it's just been one 2-week long period and emotional roller coaster. My kids and my husband are confused and don't recognize me_ where did my sweet nature go?,F,42,2  weeks,3/24/2008Email,Seasonale
369, 1, birth control and fewer periods,headaches_ dizziness_ excessive tiredness_ insomnia_ night sweats_ diminished sex drive_ extreme weight gain_ severe mood swings_ shortness of breath_ leg and arm pain.,It took me months trying to figure out what was going on.  And when it finally clicked I couldn't believe that it was my BCP!  I gained 27 lbs in 9 months!  It didn't matter how much I exercised or how healthy I ate.  Every few weeks I seemed to develop new problem to the point that I didn't know what was wrong with me.  I went to see my Doctor who ran series of tests.  All of them came back normal. I thought that I as going crazy.  My problems became more worrisome within past few weeks when I started to have severe mood swings and night sweats_  I would wake up in the morning after 10 hours of sleep completely exhausted.  Last Thursday I went to my pharmacy to pick up another pack of Seasonale and as always got home and started reading the information sheet.  And things started to fall into place.  It all became even more clear when my husband and I started to do  deeper research and found this website.  I am NOT starting my new pack and most certainly would not recommend this drug!,F,31,9  months,3/23/2008,Seasonale

Talked to my OB/Gyn and he stated he doesn't like this med but since I wanted to try one of the fewer period pills he went ahead and ordered it.  Switched me to the Nuvaring_ period has now stopped...after 2 days on it. and hoping the nausea will fade away soon.,,36,7  weeks,3/15/2008,Seasonale
374, 1, birth control_ few periods,do NOT take this pill,this pill is horrendous. i took it so i would have fewer periods. the first couple of months were fine and after about 7 months i had my period for 3 MONTHS. and it was heavy! this damaged my sex life with my boyfriend not to mention COSTLY_ finally i got off it and got on a better pill. don't even take the risk.,F,21,1  years,3/13/2008Email,Seasonale
375, 4, breakthrough bleeding,I had no side effects with Seasonale_ but switched to the generic Jolessa after about a year and suffered terribly.  I had no idea it was my birth control giving me trouble.  I was terribly nauseous.  I lost 30 lbs. in 5 months_ very tired and a terrible pain in my rt. upper abd. and back.  I went to a chiropractor since I am an avid exerciser and thought it must be muscular.  Then I went to my general doctor who sent me for many kidney tests-all normal.  My doctor then sent me to a surgeon who removed my gallbladder.  Finally_ I went to my gyno for my yearly physical and explained to him my problems I'd been having.  He took me off birth control pills on Monday.  I was able to eat again on Weds. and am immediately feeling better.  My Rt side is still a little uncomfortable but apparently Jolessa is processed through  one's liver and was too much for mine.,I would recommend Seasonale but not the generic Jolessa.,F,37, ,3/11/2008,Seasonale

377, 4, Painful_ heavy periods & travel.,Increased sex drive_ a few pimples_ possibly gaining weight.,I started this pill a week ago for 2 reasons.  1. Because my periods are very heavy_ the PMS is unbearable and the cramping was making me take a day off work every month; 2. Because I am travelling in April and didn't want to have a full period right when I was on my trip.  So far so good. I feel like my appetite has increased a bit and I got a few pimples on my forehead after the 3rd day but they are gone now_ other than that I have had no issues. My energy and sex drive have actually increased.  Since I have just started I will be watching for side effects although I am actually looking forward to having fuller breasts if this is one of the side effects that happens to me.,F,42,7  days,3/4/2008Email,Seasonale
378, 2, Adenomyosis,Heavy long term bleeding_ increased appetite_ bloating_ breast tenderness_ night sweats_ fatigue_ irritability (either a direct effect of the med or a secondary effect of _ongoing_ 8 week period...),The medication was prescribed to even out my cycle_ with the hope that the pain associated with my adenomyosis would diminish.  Started the med during my period per instructions_ and the bleeding never stopped.  I'm starting my ninth week (bleeding every day; varies from spotting to heavy bleeding/clotting)_ and the pain has actually increased.  I've also managed to eat my way to a 15 pound weight gain in two months_ after maintaining an 80 lb weight loss for 2 years.  I'm continuing out of desperation_ hoping the bleeding will stop in the next month or so; only other treatment for adeno is hystorectomy. Right now_ hysto's looking like a better alternative!  I wouldn't recommend against the med only b/c each person is so different-- obviously Seasonale works great for lots of women.,F,39,57  days,3/3/2008,Seasonale
379, 1, birth control,horrific weight gain_ increased appetite_ fatigue_ depression,this is the worst birth control...ever.  within a week of taking it i was constantly dizzy and tired_ everything in sight was appealing_ regardless of whether i was hungry or not.  i gained about 15 lbs in the first month_ and my stomach looks pregnant.  i've always had pretty good skin_ but seasonale is making me break out constantly.  very effective though_ since i am now overweight with acne and no sex drive anymore_ i highly doubt sex is an option at this point.,F,21,30  days,3/3/2008,Seasonale

I have no sex drive and I feel bloated. I am soo moody_ I dont feel like dealing with people sometimes. I thought it was just me.,I thought it was just me.

382, 4, Control ovulation,A few pimples when it was time for my period_ and spotting through the first 6-9 months.,I still had a huge sex drive while on Seasonale and never had ANY problems until recently when I was in the 3rd month/3rd week of pills and started spotting_ then got my period 2 weeks early_ which never happened in the 3 years I've been on it. I came up with some funky hormone test results_ so I'm stopping taking the pill until I can get in to see my OBGYN and get some tests run without having the pill's chemicals interfere. Horrible cramps so far. This period is lasting the longest of any in 3 years.,F,32,3  years,2/12/2008,Seasonale

They need to pull this crap off the market.,F,39,6  weeks,2/9/2008,Seasonale
384, 3, endometriosis,weight gain_ extreme moodiness_ depression_ brown patches..who knows what else!,Thank God for this site!  I thought I was going crazy.  I have been on Seasonale for about 3 years now.  My biggest issue with this pill is the depression and the mood swings.  I have never been a depressed person or exhibited any of those traits.  Over time_ with taking seasonale/seasonique_ I have completely changed. I cry at the drop of a dime. I get mad at the smallest things and can be very mean to people.  It's just not like me. I just thought it was me.  Now I realize it's the pill.  I can't believe I've been dealing with these feelings all this time and not knowing the cause.  I should add that the depression has gotten progressively worse.  I'm always exhausted. All I want to do is go home and sleep.  I really don't want to interact with anyone.  Ugh...so_ does anyone have any suggestions on other pills i could take? i need to stay on a pill for my endo problems. Now I'm wondering if i should try to find an anti-depressant or just switch pills. Please feel free to write me. I,F,29,3  years,2/8/2008Email,Seasonale

I thought it would be only a few days_ but it wasnt. i've had it for about a month and a half.  Its not heavy or anything.. Its just a burden.  Not only that_ but im emotional all the time.

I started with the brand name Seasonale for 6 months. Then I took the generic Quasense for 1.5 yrs until I realized that playing with nature to get four periods per year was a big mistake_ a total disaster. I slowly gained 10-15 lbs over the 2-yrs period. I couldn't control what I eat. Everything tasted and looked good_ and it was always a ritual to take something out of the fridge when I open it. If I was craving for a snack_ I must go to the store to get it. 1 big bowl of rice (full of Carbs) was never enough_ 2 huge bowls would be.When that ""time of the month"" approaches (which occurs every month)_ I became very moody. When I'm on those placebo pills at the end of the 3rd month_ I became a total disaster. I was depressed_ I hated everything and everyone evolving the world_ even my fiance whom I have been with for 4 yrs (THANK GOD he has been great to me despite).. I felt possessed.. I was suicidal over small fights with him.. & I absolutely have NO se",F,20,2  years,2/7/2008Email,Seasonale

However_ I'm in week 10 and it doesn't look like the bleeding is going to end soon...on day 10 of bleeding.  During the bleeding I have been exhausted and an emotional wreck.  After calling my doctor_ who put me on this damn pill_ she referred me to a specialist so I figured that this is not the birth control for me.  I've gained anywhere from 10-15 pounds since I started taking this over 2 months ago (exactly 65 days ago)...I eat healthy and exercise 1-2 hours per day 5-6 days per week. In other words_ I'm pretty active_ consume 1200 calories per day_ and the weight isn't moving.  I'm tired all the time too; it's pretty bad when you have to sneak out to your vehicle at lunch and take a nap during your lunch hour.

I sometimes get the feeling that physicians are pushing new drugs/medications on their patients_ claiming that everything will be fine.  I don't buy it and will be finding a doctor that is not so willing to send me home with 'sample' packs of meds.  I have come to realize that each person should take their healthcare into their own hands--you are the only one who knows your body--so stand up for yourself and get a new doctor_ if you need to.,F,28,3  weeks,1/23/2008,Seasonale

I gained about 10 pounds within the first six months and have gained another 15 at this point. The major side effect I'm wondering if anyone else has had is ringing of the ears.

400, 1, Prevent Pregnancy,Break-through bleeding_ depression_ weight gain_ loss of sex drive,I wouldn't recommend Seasonale OR Seasonique to anyone. I know that everyone responds differently to birth control_ but for me it was a nightmare. Every third month on both of these medicines I experienced break-through bleeding that could last anywhere from a few days to an entire month. The last pill pack I was on_ I bled for an entire month up through my period and I said that was it. It was great going the first two months without a period but if the period I do get lasts for an obnoxious amount of time_ I didn't see the real point. There were a few times that I didn't have break-through bleeding_ but it wasn't enough for me to stay on this medication. It's just too frustrating and inconvenient never knowing when the bleeding might start again.,F,25,2  years,1/13/2008,Seasonale

Weight gain_ over 10 pounds in 3 months_ nausea almost daily_ cramps_ nasty discharge_ increased headaches_ decreased sex drive_ and bloating.,I have given this a shot_ hoping to stave off a few periods_ but I do not like the side effects.  I did NOT have any break through bleeding like most people here_ but I have had many of the other side effects. A few weeks ago I was afraid I was pregnant because the nasuea wouldn't go away_ I'd gained weight and I had cramps.  Then I found this website.  I decided to stick it out for a few more weeks.  I got through the first 3 pack_ and I've been 5 days off the pills_ waiting for my period_ but all I have is worse cramps.  I'm assuming it's from being OFF the pills and my body adjusting.  I've called my doctor and asked to go back on my old pills.  Not having a period when I SHOULD scares me.  Also_ as someone else pointed out_ I noticed about 2 weeks ago that my deoderant doesn't seem to work as well...  I've been Using Secret for YEARS with no problems.

I thought it was just me going through early menopause or something.  I thought I got too old for sex or something and lost interest because of my age?  I don't want a sexual partner AT ALL.

Then: INTENSE cramping; EXTREMELY heavy period (w/ heavy flow & LARGE clots) lasting for WEEKS; mood swings; insomnia; diminished sex drive; headaches; night sweats.,My girlfriend started taking Quasense about 9 - 10 weeks ago. The first six weeks were uneventful. After that her period started - and continued for weeks. She had intense cramping (which she'd never had before) and was passing HUGE clots. Her doctor had advised her to stay the course - but a period that lasts for WEEKS?! That's nuts. She began having night sweats and mood swings_ insomnia and depression. We did our research before filling her prescription -- but didn't find anything in any of the literature or websites that made us believe that we'd run into side effects like these. Even in situations where these side effects were noted as a possibility the literature usually stated that it would occur in less than 1% of women who took the drug. Looking at this website_ I can see how misleading the drug company information was. I feel so bad for her_ that she's subjected herself to 10 weeks of torture.,,36,10  weeks,1/8/2008,Seasonale

I started at 120lbs and just went to the dr today and was 136. I didnt notice the weight gain because it was minimal over the years. I did not realize why I was having night sweats or hair loss until I found this site. Also_ after about 6 months on it I completely lost my sex drive. I thought it was because I worked so much_ but I do not work anymore and I STILL have no libido_ so I know it has to be the BCP. Getting a copper IUD (no hormones!) put in next week. Hope it helps. Good news is Dr said I can still use BCP to skip periods for an event (like my honeymoon) even with the IUD which is great to have the option!,F,27,4.5  years,1/3/2008,Seasonale

In March of 2005 I started using the Zone Meal Plan (eating all organics)_ doing an hour of Cardio 5 days a week_ and 3 hours of strength training with a personal trainer every week. I was able to get 10lbs off in 2005 but nothing after that. I maintained in 2006 but I was very unhappy due to all the effort I was putting into my diet and exercise program. 2007 was a busy year and my diet and exercise suffered... Guess What? Weight Gain. 12lbs! I am going off the pill and back to my strict diet and exercise program in Jan 2008. Now_ am back up to my original 20lbs! 20lbs that I want to loose before trying to get pregnant in the fall. The weight issue is the worst side effect that I experienced. The night sweats and hot flashes have been going on for the last 4 years. I am looking forward to those going away_ too! BP went from Low/Normal to Normal/Board Line High.

409, 2, to prevent pregnancy,weight gain_ acne_ horrible cramps_ moodiness_ spotting.,I've been taking the generic form_ Seasonique for 3 months. I immediately started breaking out all the time_ especially on my chin and shoulders. I've gained at least 10 pounds (probabaly more but i'm too afraid to get back on the scale) in the stomach_ hips and thighs. I haven't gained weight in like 5 years. I basically bled through the entire 3rd month and had spotting in the first 2. I also had really really bad cramps (i never have cramps) during the 3rd month. I know spotting is a side effect and will get better_ but basically have a period for 3 months is not worth it.

410, 2, Fewer periods.,Extemely moody the first few months. My husband really wanted me to go off of it becase of the mood I was constantly in. I am an emotional person_ but I do believe that Seasonale caused me to be more emotional.,"I started Seasonale March 2005 when I was 22. I went off of it in Febuary 2007 and my husband and I conceived in June. I miscarried that August at 12 weeks. What my OB failed to tell me was that this pill was not designed for long time use. It is great for athletes who do not want a period every month and for women who may not want to be on their period for a specific day (example: wedding day). I believe that I miscarried because I was on this pill for way too long and my body was not ready to be pregnant. The ""baby"" stopped developing at 5 weeks_ but my body continued to act as if nothing was wrong. At week 12 I had an emergancy D&C. Now here it is_ almost January 2008 and still not pregnant. Having fewer periods was not worth the physical pain I went through and the emotional stress that I am still going through.",F,25,2  years,12/27/2007Email,Seasonale
411, 1, Fewer Periods/Birth Control,extreme mood swings_ weight gain_ break-through bleeding_ & bloating,Since day 1 of taking this drug (generic QUASENSE) I have been a totally different person.  I cry at the drop of a hat_ get angry at my husband over ridiculous things_ and am generally depressed.  Before this I was on Yasmin and didn't have any of these problems.  I have gained almost 20 lbs in the last 10 months and I can't make it stop. Between that and the bloating I look like I'm about 5 months pregnant (all in the tummy area) I bleed the last month of the pills on and off so I always have to be 'prepared'.  I absolutely HATE this drug and just called my Dr. to go back on Yasmin and I can't wait to be myself again (and I bet my husband can't wait either)!  It is absolutely NOT worth the fewer periods so think twice.,F,25,10  months,12/27/2007,Seasonale
412, 1, decreased periods,heavy bleeding_ cramping_ circulation problems_ tender breasts_ vaginal dryness,I was on the generic version of Seasonale_ quasense for a month and a half before I started bleeding heavily non-stop for almost 2 weeks. I took to reduce my periods which are associated with my migraine headaches. My doctor told me to double my dose to stop the bleeding_ which I did for 4 days before it began to lighten up. Around the same time I increased dosage_ I started having numbness in my left leg. I then dropped the dosage down to normal and have started spotting again! I also had awful vaginal dryness_ so sex is *very* uncomfortable.  I found this website and immediately stopped taking the pills. I will go back to ortho-novum_ which I was on for 2 years before this.,F,33,1.5  months,12/27/2007,Seasonale

414, 3, birth control/ fewer periods,weight gain_ break through bleeding,I am still on it and I like it. I am really unsatisfied with my weight gain. When I started the pill I weighed 115 and now_ two years later I weigh 165_ and that is a lot of weight to put on! I didn't gain as much weight when I was working out every day. It is great for fewer periods_ and my partner likes that too. Also I have fewer headaches than I used to and I don't have to take acne meds anymore because seasonale took care of it for me.,F,20,2  years,12/22/2007,Seasonale

417, 5, fewer periods_ birth control,spotting my first couple pill packs,The spotting went away with in the first year. Periods so light I only need lite tampons. I also rarely get cramps. This pill has caused no weigh gain. Don't take generic birth control_ it's less effective_ do your research.No one pill is right for everyone.But if you stick with the pill for more than a few weeks the side effects(especially the bleeding) will usually get better.Remember this is a 90 day pill pack not a 30 day_ and with any birth control pill you have to give your body time to adjust to the hormones_and no 2 weeks or 2 months isn't enough time for you to know.,F,22,4  years,12/15/2007Email,Seasonale
418, 1, Fewer periods_ birth control,Weight gain_ tiredness_ depression_ moodiness_ loss of sex drive,"I started taking Quasense the generic for seasonale in September.  Since that date I have gained about 9 pounds. It seems that no matter what I do or eat I gain weight.  I have been in a ""mood"" for the past 3 months and haven't been able to pinpoint why.  After reading the comments on the pill I am convinced that alot of my issues are related to the pill.  I can eat virtually nothing and weigh a pound more the next day on the scale.  It is very frustrating.  Hardly none of my pants fit & I can't afford to buy new clothes.  I am STOPPING the pill immediately.  Keeping my fingers crossed the weight will go away as fast as it came and that I will get in a better mood soon.",F,33, ,12/13/2007,Seasonale

420, 1, less periods,Acne_ Depression_ spotting and break through bleeding for 2 months straight_ headaches(jolessa - generic brand),My skin started breaking out terribly - never been that bad before in my life and when I asked my doctor if it could be connected she said no_ that birth control clears up your skin_ not the opposite... clearly not true.  Having my period for 2 months straight and everything that goes with it (irritability_ depression_ cramps) defeats the purpose of taking a pill to have less periods!  Switching pills asap.  The comments on here are really comforting to know that all this was connected and I wasn't imagining it!,F,24,3  months,12/8/2007,Seasonale

I couldn't breathe and was in a lot of pain.,I used to use Seasonale and loved it_ except the cost was high and I didn't have insurance.  Once I got insurance_ I went to the doctor to get back on Seasonale.  Thought I'd try the generic Quasense and it gave me hives and very painful cystic acne!,F,23,1  years,12/3/2007,Seasonale
424, 4, BCP w/ fewer periods,Some nausea and breast tenderness.,1)  Hurray for Seasonale!!!  2)Not all BCPs are for everyone.  People's bodies react differently to different hormones_ and your body DOES take time to adjust.  Don't discount a method after 1 month of taking it - you're body won't have had time to adjust.  I had nausea and breast tenderness for the first three weeks or so (as my body adjusted to the new hormone levels)_ which went away.  No weight gain so far; actually I've LOST weight.    3) If you aren't taking the BRAND NAME Seasonale (i.e. you are on the generic form of it - check your pill packs) you are MUCH MUCH MUCH more likely to have the nasty side effects.  Make sure you have the brand name pills.,F,27,30  days,11/29/2007,Seasonale

I have also gained a pound per week_ despite eating normally.  Fortunately I have found this website after being on Seasonale for only seven weeks_ and I threw the rest of the pack away after reading these reviews.  The reason I got on the computer for answers was because of the worse side effect I have experienced_ which has been horrible_ horrible FATIGUE.  In seven weeks I have gone from a busy_ high energy person to someone who requires two naps per day to even function.  I have been allowing the TV to babysit my four-year-old_ and letting my infant cry in her crib.  I have been so unbelievably tired.  I stopped cleaning the house and stopped cooking.

I looked on the internet at the time (2005) and could not find any reference that anyone else had similar symptoms.  I had been on the regular pill for years with no side effects.  One weird effect was that_ with being tired_ no amount of caffeine would help me feel awake (even if I was about to fall asleep driving_ for example).  I have been off Seasonale for about 2 years now.  The extreme exhaustion went away_ but my response to caffeine has not improved.  It is frustrating; maybe caffeine isn't good for you_ but it is nice to have a little pick-me-up sometimes.  Seasonale ended that for me.  I have yet to hear of anyone else having that particular side-effect.,F,39,6  months,9/5/2007,Seasonale
461, 1, migraines,major weight gain_ acne_ depression,I would not recommend this for anyone over age 30. It seems those of us older than that are the ones who have the most problems. I have been on this for a year and have gained 50 pounds! My depression is much worse than it has been in 10 years. I am stopping this ASAP. There has to be something better for hormonal-based migraines!,F,41,1  years,9/4/2007,Seasonale
462, 1, Fewer Periods_ Birth Control,Cramping_ bloating_ weight gain_ clotting,I took the pill 3 years ago for 2 and a half months.  I had lower abdominal cramping_ bloating_ weight gain and then severe cramps and clotting just before deciding to go off of it.  The doctor actually thought I miscarried while on the pill but it was just a very large clot.  I've never been in so much pain in my entire life.,F,28,3  months,9/4/2007,Seasonale
463, 1, Fewer Periods,Prescribed at a local clinic and doctor admittedly had not prescribed this before_ but did so at my request.  A little spotting in month 1 and 2.  Month 3 non-stop bleeding_ heavy clotting_ horrible pain.  I have taken 3 different pills previously and never had any problems.  I would NOT recommend this pill to anyone.  I ultimately ended up in my GYN's office and he said he no longer prescribes this pill as there are far too many side effects!,,F,38,3  months,9/4/2007,Seasonale
464, 3, No monthly period,I switched to Seasonale to not deal with the monthly bleeding.  I was then given the generic_ Jolessa.  Along with many of the other girls/women that have posted here_ I have had the same experience.  The pill seems great in the beginning.  Wow_ bleed once every 3 months_ if I feel like it!  Then_ the side effects kick in.  I have gained a lot of weight! I am too afraid to get on the scale!  I have also been suffering from extreme depression and anxiety. I hate the world and everyone in it and for NO reason!  The weight gain is excessive.  To the point_ I have lost count as to the pounds.  I have went up quite a bit.  I have NOT changed any eating habits to constitute such a gain.  I have also had globs of hair falling out for no reason.  Migraines have been off the chart.  I would NOT take this medication for any reason!  I am going to stop taking it and go back to the BCP that I was on.  I will just bleed every month.  I have lost my sense of 'self' and do not like who I have become!,Don't take it!! To not  bleed every month seems like a Godsend but it really is not when you weigh the pros and cons!  I would stop having sex before I would recommend this medication!  Not worth the out of control mental health for anyone!  I just realized what is causing all of my troubles... Weight gain_ depression_ anxiety_ lack of motivation_ etc etc.. the list goes on...I rated this medicine a 3 because it did work for me in that I did not want a monthly period.  I was not aware of the side effects.  I did not do my 'homework' prior to taking this BCP.,F,32,365  days,8/29/2007Email,Seasonale
465, 1, perimenopause_ heavy periods,migraines_ night sweats_ excessive sweating in heat_ breakthrough bleeding_ no libido_ weight gain,I hate this pill!  I was put on it to help with my perimenopause symptoms - particularly the night sweats.  All went well for six weeks until the headaches_ sweating and breakthrough bleeding began.  The cramps that wake me daily at 5:30am are really awful - I'd rather have a full period every month than a two week and counting period that doesn't seem to ever end!,,, ,8/26/2007,Seasonale
466, 1, Prevent Pregancy,HORRIBLE ACNE. Major weight gain. Irrational emotions_,I've been a total psycho since I started this pill. I have horrible acne_ not just pimples_ they're huge_ red and cystic. On my face and entire chest. And I gained a ton of weight.,F,20,365  days,8/26/2007,Seasonale
467, 1, birth control,Extreme vaginal dryness_ re-curring painful yeast infections_ bloating_ fatigue_ and decrease in sex drive. I did not have breakthrough bleeding or weight gain.,I have been on the generic version Quasense and quit taking today after reading this site.  I thought I was going crazy_ but after finding out that others had the same symptoms I was truly relieved that it was the drug.  I have been on birth control for eight years and have never had side effects like this before.,F,28,7  months,8/25/2007,Seasonale
468, 3, fewer periods,Initially lots of break through bleeding. increased breast size_ no sexual desire.,Well_ I didn't have the weight gain or acne. My breast size increased. I was on Seasonale for over 3 years. Because the loss of sex drive was realistically my only side-effect (after the 6 straight weeks of bleeding) and the drug insert does not list decreased libido as a side effect_ I didn't completely attribute my problems to the medication. I finally decided to stop taking it and in just a few short weeks I feel like a person with a normal sex life. Having absolutely no sexual desire is hard on a marriage_ and much worse than a few extra periods.,F,28,3  times,8/22/2007,Seasonale
469, 2, less cycle_ headaches_ endometriosi,never ending cycle and night sweats,I started Seaonale in mid June to reduce cycles since I have migraines and recently diagnosed with endometriosis.  Things were going well until this month--I have been on my cycle since Aug 10 with no end it sight.  Thought it was breakthrough bleeding but this is ridiculous. I am going to see my doctor in the morning. I have been really sweaty a night (which is totally unusual) but didn't attribute it to the pill until my husband stumbled upon this sight.  I have been very tired lately and a little depressed.  Just thought I wasn't getting enough sleep.  No weight gain-thankfully.  Thank you ladies for thsi site.  You may have saved my life.  Heck my husband is fixed so I don't have to worry about any more kids.  I think I am going to give it a break.,F,36,3  months,8/22/2007,Seasonale

I HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT AT LEAST 5 DAYS A WEEK AND IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING HELPS!  THAT IS WHY I CAME HERE TO SEE OTHERS REACTIONS.I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT I NEED TO SWITCH PILLS!,F,37,2  years,8/14/2007,Seasonale
472, 1, less periods.,Weight gain_ night sweats_ looks like im preganant!!!!,I am 5'11 and gained over 20 lbs... I didnt weigh what I do now when I was pregnant..

473, 4, fewer period/less severe cramps,occasional break through bleeding,I have been on seasonale for almost four years now...and I definitely do recommend it.  I have experienced no depression or anxiety or night sweats.  I gained weight...but hello...I went to college and ate pizza a lot.  My birth control had nothing to do with that.  Four periods a year is amazing...I say go for it.,F,22,4  years,8/7/2007,Seasonale
474, 2, Fewer Periods,On pills for 3 months.  When I reached the 3rd month I had breakthrough bleeding and started my cycle before I reached the placebo pills. I am still on my cycle and 3 weeks counting.  I called my doctor with my concerns and she informed me that the side effect will subside on my second pack.  I am taking the generic quasense.,Not to happy with the on going cycle that never ends.  I will try it out for one more pack and if it doesn't stop my cycle I will be looking for a different birth control.  Already tried the patch (not good for overweight women) and the ring (somehow slipped out with out me knowing.  So I may be going back to Yasmine.  Never had any problems with that pill.,F,33,3  months,8/2/2007,Seasonale
475, 5, Fewer periods,None really.  Just what can be expected on any pill_ though I did not feel that there were any side effects grave enough to discontinue use.,This is the 5 birth control pill I have been on and I find that I like it the best.  I had a slight weight gain (at first_ about 3 lbs in 3 months)_ though it could be to the lack of motivation on my part.  I took seasonal for 20 months_ and have since been on the generic Levlen for 18 months.  I like the ability to schedule my periods and I never experience negative side effects.  I never even had breakthrough bleeding_ even at the very onset. I would_ and have_ recommended it.,F,25,3  years,7/25/2007,Seasonale

477, 1, perimenopause,painful breasts_ mild cramping_ weight gain_ decreased appitite,"My doctor put me on this to help me with the perimenopause symptoms I was having. I did lose most of the night sweats_ but am still not sleeping and have headaches. My body thought it was PREGNANT on Quasense (the generic form of Seasonale)!!! My breasts were tender and full. I had a constant ""achiness"" like my body wanted to start a period. I was gaining weight but not eating! It was just like my 2 pregnancies. My doctor told me to quit taking this pill 5 weeks after I started. It took me 3 days to start flowing and now I have HEAVY BLEEDING AND LARGE CLOTS! I have never had this before. I wish I had read this site before hand. I DO NOT recommend this med for anyone!!!!",F,40,5  weeks,7/23/2007Email,Seasonale

480, 1, endometriosis,TERRIBLE mood swings_ DEPRESSION and ANXIETY.  I am consumed by worry about stupid_ irrational things.  I almost got fired from my job because the depression and anxiety exasterbated my ADD (i am a waitress) and i could not force even the smallest smile.  I also want to EAT all the time.,IF YOU HAVE ENDOMETRIOSIS- you can take any other BC pill in the same way as seasonale.  Just talk to your doctor about skipping the placebos and taking the pills continuously.  And find a BC pill that works for you instead of being forced to choose the only pill PACKAGED that way.,F,21,50  days,7/17/2007,Seasonale
481, 1, Birth Control,Night sweats_ severe depression_ anxiety_ heart palpitations_ weight gain_ exhausted_ no sex drive_ hair loss_ horrific cramps_ headaches_ acne_ constant mood changes_ excessive crying,This stuff is horrible. I've been taking this stuff for 2 years.  I was on Depo for 4 years before that. I'm glad I stumbled upon this website.  In December_ my insurance company switched me to Quasense.  I bled the entire month of December.  Since then_ I've gotten progressively more depressed.  I have horrible night sweats.  I can't remember the last time I had sex which is driving my husband nuts.  I've been so depressed I can't stand to do anything.  I've gained 20 pounds and despite being on Weight Watchers_ which I used to lose 90 pounds_ I can't get rid of this weight.  I feel like crap.  I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror.  I miss a ton of work. My hair is falling out everywhere. I just had my thyroid tested and the results came back negative.  I'm so glad I found this site.  The rest of this pack is going to the trashcan when I get home from work.,F,26, ,7/16/2007,Seasonale
482, 3, Birth Control,No period in 6 months_ Gain weight,I was satisfy with the pill...but I don't like the fact of not bleeding for 6 months.  I also hate the weight that the pill put on me.

483, 3, deployed and wanted fewer periods,Acne,I have read many of the comments on this BCP and have finally put my mind at ease knowing this was th esource of my new acne problem. I have never had problems in the past but I have never been on BCP before either. I am not sure if it is just Seasonale but the problem exists. Other than that I have had no problems with weight gain or loss of sex drive. In fact_ it is heightened. Good luck ladies!,F,23,1  months,7/9/2007,Seasonale
484, 2, bi weekly periods,Hair loss_ weight gain_ breakthrough bleeding,maybe my 3rd month I had breakthrough bleeding - for a month.  I was determined to stay on the course.  After that_ I had disharge - heavy enough to wear a pantiliner.  A year on seasonale I got switched to quasense - the 6th month has been miserable.  Been bleeding for 4 weeks now with clots I stopped taking the pill a week ago and still bleeding. On no bc now - but will not go back to this.

My periods have been so painful in the past_ not having to suffer once a month felt like heaven_ but once the depression kicked in my thoughts on this drug have changed. I am annoyed all the time. I don't want to be with anyone or do anything. Although_ I have suffered from severe depression in the past_ everyone has told me that once I started taking seasonale I have been impossible to live with. I have lost weight_ about 6 lbs_ which is the only thing I do not have a complaint about. Break-through bleeding has just become a problem. I am getting off as soon as I can.,F,21,3  months,6/30/2007,Seasonale
486, 1, Unbearable cramps,weight gain and LACTATION,This medication was my way to get off of Depo-Provera. I thought it was a Godsend because it was a 3-month pill_ which told me I wouldn't gain weight. Except_ I kept climbing. And I didn't realize it_ but all the while my Prolactin level in my brain was shooting through the roof. When I started LACTATING_ I knew there was a problem. I was 16. I wasn't sexually active. There was no reason that I should be lactating_ and it was quite embarrassing to wake up with a wet t-shirt. Turns out_ my prolactin level was around 50_ instead of the 14 it should be.,F,17,2  years,6/29/2007,Seasonale

I am close to my second year on it and I now realize its the root of all of my issues.  I was fine for a while.  I switched to this after being on Orthro-Tri-Cyclen for 3 years.  I was interested in fewer periods.  I finally realized that I gained like 15lbs from it (in the belly area).  I have always been a thin person.  No mood swings or anything_ but I do find myself slightly emotional after orgasming (no biggie).  Vaginal dryness issues_ no interest in sex (BIG ISSUE).

491, 5, Severe Cramping,Occasional breakthrough bleeding especially the few weeks before my period.,It doesn't help the severity of the cramps much but at least I only have cramps every three months instead of every month. Also_ it decreased the duration and heaviness of my period.,F,20,2  years,6/21/2007,Seasonale
492, 5, Fewer Periods,Awesome. Clear prettiest skin ever. I am extremely happy. And actually have a flatter stomach. The only thing is my legs seem a tad bigger. That's about it. Awesome pill. No Bleeding!,This pill is incredible regardless of what people think. You don't gain extreme weight because of birth control. The pill itself doesn't hold fat grams. It can at sometimes make you look puffy_ but just lay off the carbs and sodium for a bit and you are fine. People blame the tiny pill too much for their lack of control. I strongly recommend this drug!,F,20,1  years,6/20/2007,Seasonale
493, 5, To avoid being pregnant,No side effects.  I love Seasonale!,No cramping_ no depression_ no break through bleeding.

495, 2, birth control_ fewer periods,change in mood_ severe cramps_ nausea,i'd like to thank everyone here for sharing their experiences. while i did not experience the acne or weight gain_ the emotional side effects are troubling. i actually came to this page because i was curious whether it was all in my head or caused by the drug. many people have cited extreme moodswings & crying -- i've felt almost the opposite -- empty_ emotionless_ confused_ hazy_ not reacting normally to situations. has anyone else experienced this -- lacking emotion and response? i also felt much more prone to sudden thoughts of anxiety and just wanting to be by myself/extremely tired_ but as i don't sleep well normally i attributed my exhaustion and antisocialness to that. also_ does anyone know if there's huge risk in going on and off this pill? i've been taking it sort of at random for the last three years because my boyfriend is long-distance so i can pretty much prepare for the times when i'm going to have sex (and especially not want a period). so far i seem to be okay_,F,23,30  days,6/18/2007Email,Seasonale

I am 5'10"" and from July to Dec_ I went from a size 6 to a size 14 and went up from a small B cup to a full C cup.  I have tried extreme dieting and worked out 5 days per week and still cannot get the weight off.  I have extreme mood swings and have had to increase my dosage for Lexapro (anti-depressant) to control my depression which only helped slightly.  I have never been more insecure in my life!!!  I have even been freaking out at work.  I stopped the pill yesterday mid cycle.  I would rather have a period every month than to go through this. I feel like this pill is ruining my life.

I'm at the heaviest I've ever been_ even when I was pregnant! All my weight is in my belly_ like I'm pregnant.  Had to keep buying larger pants. I am quitting this BC immediately and calling my OBGYN.  I have been on Seasonale for 4 years and didn't realize the impact it is having on my body.

I didn't have any side effects until I started taking that.  I didn't realize that any of my side effects were b/c of Jolessa until reading here.  I started having break through bleeding in month 1 and it got more and more frequent until month 3 when it has been every day.  I stopped taking the pill last Sunday and am having the worst period I have ever had.  I also turned into a psychotic B**ch.  I don't know how people put up with me_ I have been moody and very irritable for no reason and I couldn't quite figure out why. Only having 3 periods a year are definitely not worth this.,F,25,1.5  months,6/5/2007,Seasonale

The rest has been really bad_ especially the headaches! I am taking this to prevent migraine and it only seems to be making them much worse-- it seems that others have had this happen too.

I've been working out and strictly dieting for two monthsand have gained an additional 3lbs. I have fibromyalgia_ so I was attributing many symtoms to that_ but its out of hand. I'm going back to tri-vora_ I was on that or tri-phasil for 14 years and never had an issue. I will miss the 3 month break between periods though. Thank goodness for this web site_ this drug makes think your nuts. Hopeflly the weight will melt off because I'm pretty disgusted with myself.,F,31,2  years,5/30/2007,Seasonale
506, 5, Contraceptive/Fewer Periods,None!  Seasonale is fabulous!,I had breakthrough bleeding with about every other pill I tried except for Seasonale.  I've been taking it for almost 2 years now and have NEVER had breakthrough bleeding.  One of my friends had breakthrough bleeding for the first 6 months on Seasonale but never again after that_ so try it.  It's so nice only having a period every 3 months too_ and when you do have a period_ it's really light.  Now that I've been on Seasonale this long_ my period is usually 2 days.  It was about 3-4 days when I first started taking Seasonale and used to be 5 days with other pills and 7 days with no pill. I love it.,F,22,2  years,5/23/2007,Seasonale

I have had all of the aforementioned symptons for the entire 9 months.  I have been bleeding for the past 5 weeks and next week I am stopping Quassense and going back on Tri-Cyclen.  I have been taking BC for 10 years and have never had any side effects with any other type.  I do not recommend this product at all; I feel like my entire life has been altered due to this drug.  I've been researching my other symptoms for months and only recently attributed my symptoms to this pill.  I only wish I had read this website months ago.  I'll let you know how the symptoms change after stopping the Quassense.,F,28,9  months,5/22/2007,Seasonale
509, 1, TO HAVE FEWER PERIODS,I WAS SPOTTING FOR THE FIRST WEEK_ THEN IT WENT AWAY_ NOW IT'S BACK. (THIS IS WHEN I SHOULD HAVE MY PERIOD.) ALSO_ I HAVE NO SEX DRIVE WHAT SO EVER. I USED TO ALWAYS WANT IT_ SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THIS I BARELY EVER THINK ABOUT IT. MY BOYFRIEND NOTICED IT ALSO-HE'S NOT DIGGIN IT!!! I ALSO FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PMSing FOR THE PAST 4 WEEKS. I'M GOING BACK TO TRIVORA (WHICH IS WHAT I WAS ON BEFORE.) I HAD NORMAL PERIODS_ JUST A LITTLE HEAVY AND LONG BUT IT WOULD COME ON A TUESDAY AND END BY FRIDAY. AND I GUESS I HAD NO SEXUAL SIDE AFFECTS EITHER!!!,,F,24,4  days,5/21/2007,Seasonale
510, 3, Migraines,Tremendous weight gain_ water retention/swelling_ night sweats_ moodiness_ fatigue.,"Huge amount of weight gain in the first 3 months and still gaining!  25 lbs added on so far.  I feel very bloated most of the time_ mostly at night and have had night sweats that until now after reading others comments did not realize it might have something to do with this drug.  I have been extremely fatigued and moody - my patience is nonexistant with my husband and child lately.  But I have not had a single migraine in 5 months!  That is truly a miracle.  I am having trouble weighing the benefits vs the side effects.  I don't want to get the migraines back because I can not function when I have them but I can not gain any more weight and be happy or healthy.  I am only 5'0"" and 25 lbs is a HUGE amount of weight on me.  For those of you who have gained weight on this drug and stopped taking it_ can you tell me how long it took to get the weight off?  Also_ did you experience migraines again once off of this drug?",F,40,5  months,5/19/2007Email,Seasonale
511, 2, Birth Control / Fewer Periods,Weight Gain_ depression/irritability,I started using Seasonale after I had a baby and had finished nursing her. I was willing to deal with the spotting and breakthrough bleeding_ which went away after the first couple of packs. But over the 2-year period in which I took the drug I gained about 35 lbs_ and it seemed that dieting and exercise did not affect my body the way it used to; I was never able to lose more than a couple of pounds_ and I could only lose that if I went to great extremes. It didn't help that I had overwhelming urges to eat (which hadn't been an issue for me before). In addition_ I had an increase in depression and irritability. I went off of Seasonale when a paperwork error caused my health insurance company to deny my refill. But then the craziest thing happened; while I was off the pill for several weeks waiting for this to get sorted out_ the pounds just started dropping off me. I wasn't even doing anything new/different with my eating or exercise. I also felt an overwhelming sense of well-being--,F,37,2.5  years,5/19/2007Email,Seasonale
512, 1, heavy period_ severe cramps.,spotting_ severe bloating_ severe cramps_ irritable_ depressed_ angry.,i am on the generic brand quasense and have not had a positive experience as of yet. i am on my 5th week and will be stopping today...i feel like im pregnant_ always hungry_ and miserable.,F,32,5  weeks,5/18/2007,Seasonale
513, 3, periods 4 times a year,I'm on my third pack of Quasense (actually 1st 3 month pack was Seasonique_ second and third 3 month packs were Quasense) and I'm really starting to have an uncomfortable pain/feeling with my heart.  I'm not sure if it is a side effect of the pill or some other reason_ but about 5 days ago it started with heart feeling like it was going to beat out of my chest - not every beat just occassionally.  This continued until about two days ago when i had chest pains.  For the most part the pains are gone_ but I can feel them come on occassionally.  What has freaked me out a bit more is that two nights ago_ I swear I was dreaming that I couldn't breathe and I remember waking up and took a deep swallow and gasp of air and was fine.  Last night I felt as if I couldn't get the normal amount of air in my lungs when I would lay down.  I have no idea if this is related to the pill or not.  Has anyone else had pains like this?,Other than that I have had no problems with Quasense - I had occassional spotting the first pack_ but that was the reason I switched from generic Ortho to Quasense was b/c I was spotting frequently.  My periods with Quasense are actually lighter than they have ever been.  My boobs did get a bit bigger and were tender_ but now have gone down a bit.,F,28,7  months,5/17/2007,Seasonale
514, 2, Period,Heavy Bloating_ random mood swings_ weight gain_ acne break outs_ irritability,I started taking Seasonale because my doctor recommended it_ because I was going to Summer Camp and I didnt feel like being on my period that week_ I quit taking it after camp_ because my mom didnt think it was healthy. After finding out I am anemic my mom put me back on the pill_ to lessen my flow_ I have gained ten pounds_ I used to weigh 112 pounds_ cand now I am a 123. It might be because I am only 15_ but after reading some of the reviews from other patients_ I know I am not alone! Good Luck!,F,15,3  months,5/15/2007,Seasonale
515, 2, FEWER PERIODS/SEVERE ANEMIA,Breakthrough bleeding/spotting everyday for 4 weeks_ then heavy bleeding for a week so far_ bloating_ unable to lose weight_ extreme fatigue_ change in mood_ no sex drive.,My Dr reccomended Seasonale (I am taking the generic_ Jolessa) to reduce bleeding since I have severe anemia. I started taking it and began spotting 2 days later and have continued to spot for the last 4-5 weeks. I also started to have heavy bleeding and that has continued for about a week now. I started running 3-4 miles_ 5+ times a week to try and lose weight and have not had any luck despite being on a strict 1200 calorie diet. I have NO energy and no sex drive. The only upside to this pill so far is that I didn't have severe cramps.,F,29,6  weeks,5/15/2007,Seasonale
516, 5, Pregnancy Prevention,NONE:),I love this pill!  I started the depo shot about 8months before I got married and had the worse mental breakdown you can imagine!  I was on it for two shots and quit about 2months before my wedding.  I started SEASONALE and everything changed.  I had gained weight with depo and lost every bit of it plus some while on seasonale.  I am sad that I am forced to switch to Yaz because my military insurance calls it a non formulary and I will have to pay for it.  I reccomend that you at least try it.  All birth control pills have some side effects but different amounts of hormones.  Finding the right combo of those hormones takes time,F,22,4  years,5/14/2007,Seasonale
517, 4, fewer periods,I'm about a week and a half in_ and thus far no problems. My sex drive has actually come back full force. It had been severely decreased during the year and a half I was on Ortho Tricyclen lo. So far I've not experienced any weight gain or acne problems. I am not taking the generic_ as my insurance makes both cost the same price_ and I have read horror stories about the side affects of the generic.,None so far_ I will update when I make it through the first month,F,20,12  days,5/13/2007,Seasonale
518, 3, To only have period quarterly,First cycle of Seasonale the only side effect I had was breakthrough bleeding (period heavy) from Week 7 through the end of the cycle.  Told doctor and was advised to try and stick it out. Second cycle of Seasonale no bleeding; perfect.  Then the generic became available and to save 39.00_ I started Quasense.  First month_ no problem.  Second month_ acne like crazy that won't clear up with prescription Retin A.  Third month_ acne plus suddenly my anti-persipirant quit working.  Wet underarms all the time_ changing anti-p's no help.  These have never been problems for me before so I am pretty sure Quasense is to blame.  I am not finished with Month 3 but plan to call Doc tomorrow to see if she thinks I need to go back to Seasonale or if this will also taper off.,If anyone else has wet underarms that the strongest anti-perspirant can't stop_ please tell me.,F,39,9  months,5/13/2007,Seasonale

520, 2, Control severe PMS,Daily breakthrough bleeding; mood swings; almost constant feeling of not being in control; foggy brain; gas; cramps,I've been on Seasonale for almost two years.  When I first started taking it_ the breakthrough bleeding was minimal.  I did experience about 10 pounds of weight gain_ and other than the bleeding_ the first 3 months went smoothly.  The painful cramps_ constipation_ heavy menstrual bleeding and emotional PMS symptoms seemed to be a thing of the past.However_ the breakthrough bleeding continuously worsened from occasionally to daily.  I didn't start connecting the re-occurence of mood swings_ gas and cramps to the medication until after reading the entries on this and other pages.  I'm going to call my doctor and discuss discontinuing this med.,F,42,2  years,5/7/2007Email,Seasonale

Yes_ I did experience break-through bleeding at least once during my ""regular"" cycle_ but otherwise no major changes.I started to encounter issues when I switched to the much less expensive generic brand of Seasonale_ Jolessa.  I've experienced EXTREME mood changes (grumpy_ irritable)_ discharge_ weight gain and hair loss.  It's also actually made me break out.  This is an addition to the other problems w/ Seasonale.",Seasonale was ok_ generic brands SUCK!  The price difference was pretty extreme (especially with my insurance) but not worth the loss of mental health.Seasonale--6 monthsJolessa-3 weeks,F,25,210  days,5/7/2007,Seasonale
522, 2, Fewer periods,Loss of libido_ decreased ability to climax_ weight retention/gain,Been taking Quasense_ a generic.  It took me a while_ but I started realizing that my libido was severely diminished_ and it had become very difficult for me to climax. Discussed this with my boyfriend_ and he had noticed the same thing. Also_ I began walking/jogging about five days per week over a month ago_ but haven't really lost any weight.  Was beginning to feel very discouraged and wondered what was wrong with me. So relieved to have found this website.  Am going to d/c this drug effective tomorrow_ have a period_ and return to my old pills next Sunday.,F,35,4  weeks,5/7/2007Email,Seasonale
523, 1, Birth control and fewer periods,breakthrough bleeding_ depression_ breat tenderness,I have been on Seasonale for 12 weeks now and I have taken other forms of birth control but none like this. Halfway through I started bleeding this like brown colored blood and it went on for two weeks. Then the depression started_ I have found that I  become so angry easily and I cry at least once a day. This was not my personality at all. After reading other comments I am going to stop taking it TODAY!!!,F,21,12  weeks,5/7/2007,Seasonale
524, 4, to prevent pregnancy,a little breast leakage and slightly bigger_ sometimes mood swings_ Cleared up anything I had on my face_ I feel bloated sometimes and gassy,Its not a bad pill but I think I will switch over before weight gain comes in the picture.,F,19,1  months,5/3/2007,Seasonale
525, 1, to reduce periods,Everything was good til week 4(or so I thought) I started bleeding and continued to do so for 3 weeks.. Additionally I could not understand why I was growing a belly_ feeling depressed and constantly barking at my husband for no reason.. I stopped taking seasonale today because I am leaving for Hawaii in 2 weeks and didnt want to be stuck with uncontrolled bleeding.. I am hoping it will all end by the time its time to go,The pill from hell.. I'd rather bleed for 5 days and know when its coming then constantly have to worry about starting.. Not worth the headache or side effects,F,45,7  weeks,4/29/2007,Seasonale
526, 3, Birth control,"Been on Seasonale for about 1.5 months now.  For about that length of time I've been experiencing a feeling of being ""blue""_ anxiety_ moodiness_ fatigue and complete lack of sex drive.  Until a couple days ago it didn't dawn on me that these symptoms could be side effects of this pill - I was distraught that my lack of interest in sex was a sign of problems in my marriage.  When I searched for side effects I found this website and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.  After reading about so many with similar experiences I'm now convinced it's this med that's causing all the problems and NOT dissatisfaction with my husband or marriage...thank God!",,F,32,1.5  months,4/27/2007,Seasonale
527, 2, prevent pregnancy/ shorten periods,weight gain_ irritability_ decreased sex drive,I wish I had found this website 6 weeks ago.  I could not figure out for the life of me why I had gained nearly 8 pounds in 6 weeks when I had completely changed my diet and had started jogging and exercising about 3 times per week.  Nearly all of the weight is in my lower stomach - I look like I am pregnant!  I have major irritability; you know_ the kind where you constantly envision punching people in the face for no reason.  And my sex drive is at an all time low.  I am throwing out the rest of my pill pack TODAY!!  I'd rather bleed for 7 days straight than deal with this.,F,31,6  weeks,4/26/2007,Seasonale

529, 3, possible endometriosis,vaginal dryness_ recurring yeast infections_ weight gain_ decreased sex drive_ hungry often_ very emotional at times for no good reason.,Seasonale helped my severe abdonimal pain and periods thought to be caused by endometriosis.  I was unable to have sex because it was so painful.  After six months on other pills I felt better_ but utlimately switched to seasonale to help give my body a break. In the last year I have been experiencing other side affects that I connect with the bc.  I went off the pill this week and then came across this site.  I hope I feel more like myself not being on it.  It is very expensive too.  I don't mind that I was on because it helped one problem_on the other hand I am happy to be off it because it seemed to cause other problems for me.,F,27,15  months,4/23/2007,Seasonale

532, 1, Because I had 2 cycles a month,I was on Seasonale all of 6 weeks_ when I found a lump in my right breast_ I had just had an examintaion in April of 2005_ I started taking seasonale in August of 2005.  On October 1st 2005 I found a lump_ on October 12th I was diagnosed with Breast cancer at a stage 3A.  I wouldnt recommend this drug to anyone.  On the back of the Pamphlet it states can cause Breast Cancer even 10 years after you stop taking it.  So no sex drive_ weight gain_ depression thats nothing_ I dont want to die from a hormone and I almost did!!!!!  If you are on it STOP TAKING IT!!!!!!!! seek other means of birth control!!!!,Should not be allowed to be sold on the market,F,36,6  weeks,4/20/2007,Seasonale
533, 1, ,I am on my 4th mth of Seasonale.  I went to the doctor last week because I have no energy_ night sweats_ depressed & just don't have any get up & go about myself.  I sat & tried to figure out what was wrong with me.  I even had an additional aids test (test every 6 mths)_ because I though maybe that was why I was so tired_ but felt that couldn't be the reason because I was gaining alot of weight.  After reading all the reviews on this site_ I truly feel that all the issues I'm having are attributed to the pills.  I have gained 14 pds in the 3.5 mths I've been on them_ as well as mood swings.  As of this moment_ I will no longer take Seasonale.  As stated before_ It's not worth the current issues.,Will stop this pill immediately.  Thank you everyone for your reviews.  I never thought birth control pills could really give you these types of issues!,F,41,3  months,4/19/2007Email,Seasonale

I don't recommend this pill to anyone!  In fact_ I make it a point to tell women NOT to go on Seasonale.  I am a very_ happy person normally_ but Seasonale changed that!  I went on Seasonale last year about this time because I was interested in the ""fewer"" periods.  When I first started taking it_ I didn't immediately notice anything.  My first pack I started bleeding after 6 weeks of taking it_ and I bled all the way through when I was supposed to get my period.  Me being the optimist I am_ I decided to give it another try.  It happened again_ and again.  I should have gone off the pill right away_ but I moved out of state and couldn't find an OB GYN_ so I stayed on it.  My optimism quickly turned to negativity and I felt like screaming at people all the time.  I was never happy_ and have cried for no reason so many times.  I have gained over 25 lbs. and my sex drive is a HUGE disappointment!  My boyfriend is extre",F,27,1  years,4/17/2007,Seasonale
537, 1, fewer periods,Seasonale - virtually noneJolessa - extreme irritability_ nausea_ dizziness_ dry mouth_ swollen breasts_ no period for nine months,I had a little break-through bleeding at first on Seasonale. Since starting Jolessa_ I haven't had a single day that I felt good. I have to eat constantly to stave off the nausea. Complete lack of energy and sex drive. I've taken the sugar pills_ but I haven't had a period in almost a year_ which I don't think is healthy. My insurance doesn't want to pay for Seasonale_ so I guess I'll have to go back to Ortho Tri Cyclen and skip the sugar pills a few times.,F,27,3  years,4/15/2007,Seasonale
538, 3, severe menorrhagia,Significant weight gain of 15 pounds in approximately 2 months_ which has caused me to feel very depressed about my appearance.  I have a small frame and went from a size 4 to a size 8 in a matter of weeks.  Virtually everyday I have outgrown more and more of my clothes.  I also have breast tenderness and feel bloated---I look like I did when I was 4 months pregnant.  Agitation has also been a problem with daily bouts of anger.,I went on Seasonale b/c I had had 3+ weeks of very heavy bleeding with a prior history of chronic_ profound anemia requiring blood transfusions and iron injections.  The Seasonale stopped the bleeding_ initially_ but after a couple of weeks_ the bleeding started again and was even worse than it had been.  My physician instructed me to take 2 pills per day_ which I have been doing for the past month.  This has stopped the heavy bleeding_ but I am still spotting on a daily basis.  I am seeing a specialist in 2 weeks and hope to go off from the Seasonale_ so that my body can go back to normal and I can fit into my clothes again.,F,44,2  months,4/11/2007,Seasonale
539, 1, hormonal migranes,weight gain_ depression,I just stopped taking Seasonale and I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who has also stopped taking this drug.

540, 2, Birth Control,weight gain_ heavier periods_ severe decrease in libido_ dehydration_ dry mouth_ vaginal dryness_ painful intercourse_ no relief from PMS and cramps,I was taking Seasonale for about 2 1/2 years and weight gain began almost immediately.  I gained 40 pounds_ went from a size 2 to a 10 and up 3 cup sizes.  In the 2nd year I started experiencing the uncomfortable sexual side effects and the dehydration and dryness.  I also developed chronic yeast infections_ though I'm not sure if this is related.  I've now been off for about 10 days.  Though I have not seen any improvements yet_ I am hoping that will happen soon.  My doctor didn't seem to think any of this was an issue_ but when I told her all I had read about others experiencing similar side effects she gave me the option of trying YAZ_ which I readily agreed to.  Fewer periods is not worth pain_ 40 pounds of weight gain and complete disintigration of your sex life.,F,23,2.5  years,4/10/2007,Seasonale

I took Seasonale for only 2 months about 6 months ago and some of the symptoms have yet to go away. I felt like I was going into early menopause. I would noticeably sweat all time_ night sweats_ yeast infections(which I rarely got)_ breakthrough bleeding and bleeding after intercourse_ weight gain_ vaginal dryness_ the list goes on and I wish some of them would go away.

542, 3, birth control,I was taking seasonale for 1 year and switched to Jolessa about 3 months ago. I haven't had as bad of an experience as some people who have taken this.  I typically have bad side effects from birth control and this one has had less bad ones than I've had from some other B.C methodsI've tried.      It actually helped my breakthrough bleeding_ which I was having naturally before taking this and only having 4 periods a year has been convenient. My periods are shorter-about 3 or 4 days and my cramps are a lot better_ but not gone completely.                          The negative side effects have included feeling bloated and fatigued and a much lower sex drive.  I did gain 7 to 10 lbs. but I don't mind so much.  The worst part has been the anxiety and mood swings!  They have been pretty bad at times.  I used to smile and laugh all the time and as soon as I started taking seasonale_ I became very irritable and impatient and angry and I smile so much less.  I have noticed it more than others,,F,23,15  months,4/9/2007,Seasonale

I started it to treat hormonal migraine and have had to justify one side effect after the next for the trade-off of not having these excrutiating headaches.  It is not worth it! I've had horrible nightsweats_ depression_ spotting_ and now breakthrough bleeding with the most painful cramps ever.  The bleeding is not going away and I can't make it one more day through these cramps. I have gained 10 lbs.  I do not recommend this pill.  It is horrible.

548, 1, fewer periods,Heavy bleeding_ irritability_ no sex drive_ weight gain.,"I am so glad to discover that it wasn't my imagination that this birth control pill is so horrible. I'm off it as of today and am going back to Loestrin. They have a new formula that has 3 extra ""active"" pills so that your periods are shorter and lighter (on average 3 days). I was on the previous formula before I had a baby and was having lighter_ shorter periods before they added the extra active pills. I can highly recommend Loestrin. Check it out at shorterperiods.com. Seasonale was a nightmare for me. I don't have anything new to add after reading the comments_ but the heavy bleeding for 6 weeks was hell and I have to force myself to have sex with my husband where before I had a healthy sex drive.",F,38,3  months,4/4/2007Email,Seasonale

550, 3, birth control,lowered hormones and complete loss of labido,I never had any of the side effects talked about on the side (i.e. weight gain_ moodiness_ break through bleeding). However_ I've been on Seasonale for a little over one year. Since beginning the pill_ I have had no desire to be sexually active with my husband of two years. In fact_ I have no sexual desire at all. I was recently tested and discovered that my hormone levels are dangerously low. I'm going to a specialist in a few weeks to find out what can be done_ as infertility is a possibility. I'm only 28 years old and have no children yet_ but desperately want them in a year or so. Now that might not be a possibility. Ladies_ if your labido is low and your taking Seasonale_ get your hormones checked fast.,F,28,1  years,3/30/2007,Seasonale
551, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain_ moodiness.,Since being on Seasonale_ I have gained 25 lbs.  I did not change my diet/excercise habits at all.  Generally_ I gain 7-8 lbs during the winter months_ and lose it quickly in the springtime.  I gained 15 lbs BEFORE winter and an additional 10 during. I started my regular spring routine of running often and dieting.  I feel like I'm STILL gaining weight_ and I'm taking in 1400 to 1500 cals/day and running 3-4 times per week.  I think the weight gain has somewhat to do with my moodiness_  because I'm not pleased with the way I look and feel right now.  I'm going off this pill immediately (especially after reading the comments from others).  I may check back in to let you know how quickly I lose the 25 lbs once I'm off Seasonale.  Thanks!,F,28,9  months,3/28/2007,Seasonale
552, 1, Birth control and abdominal pain,I have never had such terrible side effects in my life. First set of pills I took made my period last about 2 months. Then my depression and anxiety sky rocketed. I have never felt so much like I am destroying the relationships I do have. I feel like being by myself and just wallowing in my depression. I feel empty and unemotional and unloving and I hate it. I have high anxiety_ guilty_ and panic attacks (which I have never had up until this point). I just got off of it now and was wondering for all those other people on here that commented the same way_ how long did it take to feel back to normal. I know it has to be the birth control and I just want to feel like myself again.,,F,21,6  months,3/27/2007,Seasonale
553, 1, birthcontrol,I do not recommend anyone to try Seasonal. I was on Seasonal for over two years and only now do I realize how detrimental to my state of mind it was. When you are taking the pill you do not realize how your mood changes because you are just happy to not have to deal with getting your period every month. After being off of Seasonal for over 7 months_ I have realized how much it had affected me. While I was on it_ I had horrbile depression swings and a feeling of constant anxiety. I had irrational jealousy and feeling of worthlessness. My sex drive plummeted and my relationship suffered. It got so bad my friends and boyfriend recommended I see a therapist. I started reading this blog page and it clicked_ my depression could be a sympton of my birthcontrol. I immediately went back to a monthly period taking a regular birthcontrol pill. I dropped weight and within a month my mood had dramatically changed back to normal. I still can't believe a medication's side effects could have affected,,F,31,2  years,3/26/2007,Seasonale

I switched about 6 months ago and have horrible hair loss ever since.  The doctors say it is most likely caused by a medication that I take. The time line points to the Jolessa.

558, 1, Birth Control,Sick. All the time. I woke up feeling hung over. Mood swings. Weight gain..the list continues,Obviously I wanted this for the period problem_ but forget it! I have been a raging pyscho on this pill. I swear its like Im pregnant all over again. I already have a D size cup_ I can't possibly grow anymore. I have been dieting for the past month plus working out. Not one pound came off. I think i actually gained! Stick to the basics. Once a month defeats the cons from this drug!!,F,25,3  months,3/22/2007,Seasonale
559, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain and bloating.,I've been on Seasonale for 2 months_ and I've gained 15 pounds.  I feel bloated and I feel like I am retaining water.  I haven't been doing anything different since I started taking this pill_ but my weight has increased drastically in two months.,F,25,2  months,3/22/2007,Seasonale
560, 1, Endometriosis_ Severe Pelvic Pain,I was prescribed Seasonale and was on it for a year before I had surgery and then was given shots of Lupron_ so I could no longer take birth control.  I was lucky not to experience the weight gain_ but I had break through bleeding_ and the entire third month I was incredibly irritable.  Also it did not help with cramps at all_ but that could have been due to the severity of my condition.  I was recently put back on Seasonale as I completed treatment with Lupron_ but after about 3 weeks of feeling completely out of control I had to stop taking it.  I would get irrationally angry over the smallest things to the point where I felt as though I could not function at work and did not want to speak with friends or family for fear of hurting relationships.  I am also on medication for anxiety and depression which made me finally feel normal for the first time in my life.  The Seasonale completely disrupted that_ and I had several panic attacks and became depressed again.,I have never had so many terrible_ angry thoughts or had such little control over the negative way I spoke to others as when I was on this medication.,F,23,13  months,3/22/2007,Seasonale

562, 3, Birth Control,Extreme Weight Gain!!!!!!,The up side is that I've been on Seasonale for three years after the birth of my son.  I never had break through bleeding.  The down sides are as follows:  severe cramping with the period_ heavy_ lengthy periods_ insomina and last but not least_ severe weight gain.  I've gained 30 pounds since taking Seasonale.  I've tried several diets and followed them and worked out 3 to 4 times a week with no results.  I am down to 1200 calories a day and still no results.  Most of my weight is in my belly and I look like I'm about 6 months pregnant.  It's embarassing_ depressing and exhausting to have no control over your weight gain.  Since reading other comments with similar side effects as I've had_ I'm stopping Seasonale TODAY!!!  Having less periods has been great but not worth the weight gain.,F,33,3  years,3/19/2007Email,Seasonale

564, 1, Heavy Bleeding,15 pounds of weight gain_ anxiety_ depression_ irritability larthargic_ break-through bleeding_ low sex drive.,Oh my!  Am I ever glad I found this web site.  I went to my internist today to treat anxiety and depression and to complain about my weight gain.  I asked her if this could possibly be due to the birth countrol pills; she wasn't familiar enough with Seasonale to give me an answer.  So I came home and finally did the research_ and I'm so glad I found this site!  I too love to work out at least four or five time a week_ but within the last several months have been becoming more and more larthargic as well as packing on the pounds (I would expect perhaps two or three pounds on a new birth-control pill---not FIFTEEN!).  Although I'm mid-cycle on the Seasonale_ I'm stopping tomorrow.  It will more than likely throw my body into a temporary whirlwind_ but until my next visit with my ob/gyn I'll just deal with the bleeding.,F,43,7  months,3/19/2007,Seasonale

567, 2, ,Extreme weight gain that I have been unable to lose...until now,I have been on Seasonale since I started college_ so about 4 years. I have always been very active and actually cheered for the first two years of college. However_ since I started Seasonale I have gained 40 lbs_ which I attributed to the college lifestyle. For the past 6 months I have been trying to lose the weight. I work out 2 hours a day_ 6 days a week and hired a trainer and nutritionist. Despite all my effort I lost ZERO weight. I increased my workouts and reduced my diet to just 1000 calories a day and still no weight loss. I was advised to see my doctor who tested me for everything under the sun but everything was normal. I have never been so frustrated and depressed. That was unacceptable_ so I decided to start researching the medicines I take and found this website. After reading that some woman had the same experience as me_ I stopped Seasonale. In the first week I lost 3 lbs and have continued losing from there. I dont know why I didnt connect the weight gain,F,21,4  years,3/15/2007,Seasonale

The girls look fabulous_ but my belly is embarassing!  Before Seasonale_ the only weight issue I had ever had is not weighing enough.  Now I can't lose weight.  I am 5' 8"" and have gone from 125 to 145.  I was ravenous the first month on it_ but after that_ I ate less than I used to and I'm still gaining!  I can't afford to keep buying bigger clothes.  Puls_ my ankles stay swollen and my heart has been beating funny.  My once excellent blood pressure has skyrocketed and my cheeks have been breaking out. I bled for 45 days with the first pack_ but I haven't experienced any bleeding with the second pack. My sex drive has taken a nosedive_ too.","People have been concerned about my mood lately and reading this thread has made me realize that it's probably because of the medicine.  I have turned into a pimply_ fat crazy woman with a great chest!  The monthly trips to the ER due to horrid pain from what I was told were ""ruptured ovarian cysts"" have stopped_ but they stopped on regular pills too.  I loved the nuva ring_ but the ring didn't prevent the cysts.  I'm so glad I found this site.  Everything makes sense now.  It does work for some people.  A friend of mine hasn't had problems except for breathrough bleeding with her very first pack.  She's been on it for a couple of years.  My husband really wants me to get off because I've gained so much weight on it.  As lovely as they are_ it's not worth all of the negative side effects for the nice chest.  My old one was okay.

I was happy on Seasonale for the first 6 weeks_ but then had breakthrough bleeding every day for the next six weeks. The breakthrough bleeding was at times as heavy as a regular period. During the placebo week_ the bleeding was so bad that my anemia became worse. I started the second pack hoping for the best. After the first two weeks_ the breakthrough bleeding started again and although it is lighter than it was during the first pack_ I've again had some spotting and/or bleeding every day for the past 7 weeks now.

My breasts started to get swollen and tender_ but that went away after a few weeks.  I've had spotting pretty much this whole time (i'm almost done with my first whole pack). And for a little over a week I had a full out period_ which was irritating.  I've also noticed mood swings_ which could change within a days time.

There's not enough acne medication on the planet to fix this mess and prior to this_ I rarely if ever broke out.  The abdominal pain is not fun.  But it's the mood swings that have totally done me over.  I'm continually apologizing to people for being a big baby one minute and a complete tyrant the next.,"Don't bother.

That is almost a 20 lb weight gain!!  I started dieting and exercising in November and I only lost three pounds. I have never had to go on a diet in my life.  So I figured if I did those two things the weight was sure to come off_ it didn't. I JUST recently realized that Seasonale may be the problem. So_ I have stopped taking them_ I will go back to Ortho Tri-Cyclen.  With those_ I never had any weight gain_ just the periods every month.

595, 3, Regulate Cycle,The first week I had nausea and sharp cramps that felt as though they extended up through my vaginal cavity to my pelvis.  I continue to have breast tenderness and have experienced an increase in my breast size (this I'm not upset about).  Beginning in the second week through this day_ I have continuous bleeding.,It's still too early for me to give a definite rating. I am currently debating as to whether it is too early to make a change or to stop this medication all together and simply go back to using 10 day Provera every three months in order to start my menstual flow.  Still weighing the pros and cons of doing so.

My first month of seasonale I had breast tenderness but that was because they have grown a cup size_ and I have been losing weight in other places. The only think I was worried about was that i was on the shot for 3 yrs. and i thought that when i actually got my period it wouldnt stop lol- but i only bled for two days and it was light... i did experience horrible cramps_ but before i got on any birth control that was like that_ so far its working great for me_ and i would recommend it to anyone. oh and i no longer have mood swings_ and my sex drive actually increased ALOT!! contrary to what other people have said.,F,19,3  months,1/19/2007,Seasonale
597, 5, birth control,The first week I was moody,I love this pill because it did not cause any weight gain or mood swings_ after the first week. I love only having a period 3 times a year. The only other side effect I have noticed is that as the weeks that I dont have a period increase_ I have an increased amount of discharge and general feeling of ickiness down there. To combat this_ I stoped taking for a week and had a period and then resumed usage. Dont do this unless you ask your doctor first. I would recommend this pill especially to someone who has a problem with BC giving them mood swings. I have been on just about every different type of birth control from the patch to the ring to different pills. This is the best I have found yet.,F,25,10  months,1/19/2007,Seasonale
598, 5, BC_ PMS_ migraine_ bad periods,None except that I bled for the entire first pack but my doctor told me to keep taking it continuously with no break.  I hated it at first.  Then someone online at iVillage told me to stop for a few days and get a period to reset my body.  I stopped for the recommended 7 days.  I had the worst period of my life.  But now I am in to my 13th week of non stop Seasonale and I haven't had even one drop of bleeding!  YAY!,This is a great pill for me_ so far.  My doctor has me on it continuously to avoid migraines from my period.  It has also took away ALL of my cycle related pain and fatigue.  I used to bleed very heavy and have only 24 day cycles.  I used to be tired all the time_ bloated_ sick and anxious.  I no longer have PMS_ IBS_ painful breasts_ painful ovulation_ mood swings_ food cravings_ painful urination_ heavy bleeding_ cramps and depression.  My cycles were debilitating.  I hope Seasonale (I take generic Jolessa at $10 a pack!) continues to work for me.  I recommended it to anyone willing to wait out the breakthrough bleeding.  Oh_ and don't start the pill during your period.  This is why I think I bled for 11 weeks straight!,F,41,6  months,1/18/2007,Seasonale
599, 1, 1 month,Weight Gain!!! Weight Gain!! Bloating!  Breast tenderness & Mood swings,I have been on this for one month.  Just stopped taking it today and am switching to Yasmine.  I work out about 5 days a week and eat right.  Have never had problems with my weigth...I got on the scale the other day and I am 6 lbs heavier.  I did this b/c I felt so bloated I thought I honeslty looked like I was 6 months pregnant....most all the weight gain is in my mid section and brests.  It is horrible.  I have been misserable...not sure if it is b/c of the pill or because my self esteem has gone down since I can barly fit in my pants.  For anyone who is not looking to put on immidiate weight I would not reccomend it!  I thought fewer periods sounded great_ but not with the constant feeling of having a baby in your belly!,F,27,4  weeks,1/18/2007,Seasonale
600, 1, Heavy bleeding and endometriomas,Bleeding since day one of taking the pill.  I am on my 38th day of bleeding...not spotting. Pad +tampon. No sex drive. Couldn't anyway due to bleeding.  Headaches_ back pain_ swelling of legs.  Gained 15 pounds with dieting during first month of medication.,It is horrible! There is no way I am going to stay on this for 3 months and have these side effects.  Not worth the 3 months of agony.  It is amazing what physicians expect women to tolerate.  What a joke of a prescription!,F,31,45  days,1/18/2007,Seasonale
601, 1, birth control/cramping,Bloating_ Weight gain_ breast tenderness,I have been taking this for one month and have had horrible bloating!  I have gained 5lbs in less then a month...needless to say I will not be continuing after this week.  Other then that I had some breast tenderness.  Other then that it has been fine_ I would continue to take if it wasn't for the horiffic bloating,F,27, ,1/17/2007,Seasonale
602, 1, long periods and acne,Horrible weight gain like 60lbs. in 4 months. I would never take this again. Yes I didn't have the periods but not at all worth the weight gain,,F,34,4  days,1/5/2007,Seasonale
603, 1, Endometriosis,nausea_ occasional vomiting_ mood swings_ depression_ profound irritability_ lethargy_ fatigue_ breast tenderness,I could NOT function while taking this pill. My life all but shut down completely as I became locked in a major depression that began within a week of my starting the Seasonale - along with some rather profound nausea issues. The mood swings and irritability made me lash out at the world around me which almost cost me my job and did cost me what had been a great relationship. It's not even been quite seven weeks yet_ but I'm glad that my doctor was able to see the corrolation between the Seasonale and my emotional issues and took me off of it as I feel like I am starting to get back to Me again.,F,30,7  weeks,12/30/2006,Seasonale
604, 1, very painful cycles with anemia,mood swings and weight gain ( 10 lbs in 2 months) this is crazy because i am a personal trainer so healthy eating and exercise is an everyday occurance for me.    moderate depression and severve fatigue were also a problem_ i mean i had some emotional outbursts and felt like i was losing my mind_  pms has nothing on this!!!,great for not having periods_  i have had no breakthrough bleeding but the side effects are to bad for it to be worth it,F,28,6  months,12/29/2006,Seasonale
605, 1, Birth control,Breakthrough bleeding_ excess vaginal discharge_ ACNE_ bigger breasts_ extreme cramps and heavy_ long periods.,Bigger breasts is the only positive thing about Seasonale for me. The periods are unbelievable (never had problems before) and I feel like buying stock in a tampon company since I now have to use them constantly. My face is a mess and I have a fat stomach for the first time in my life. I want to thank everyone for their comments--it reinforces my decision to get off this drug!,F,40,7  months,12/26/2006,Seasonale
606, 5, constant 2-3 wk long periods,I gained about 15 lbs within the first 6 months. And I can't seem to get the weight off.,As far as the periods and cramps go_ I freaking love seasonale. Without birth control pills_ I have 2-3 wk long periods. One or two weeks off_ then back on a period. And heavy_ heavy (have to wear a pad and tampon at the same time) periods. Cramps from he||. Birth control pills help control the periods and cramps. But every other year_ the level of birth control pill has to be changed because I go back to having longer and more painful periods. Seasonale is great. I haven't had a full blown period in over a year. I spot for 2 or 3 days maybe once every 5 months. NO CRAMPS! The only problem I have is that I can't loose weight. I thought about coming off Seasonale for about 6 months to see if I could loose some weight_ but the thought of having a another period like I used to have is quite a deriant.,F,35,18  months,12/25/2006Email,Seasonale
607, 1, Pregnancy Prevention,I had taken this birth control for a whole year and then the break-through bleeding began and never stoppped everyday bleeding and cramps and bloating especially at night dry hair and acne break outs when i have never had acne and sever stomache aches about 30mins into takeing the pill. i do not know why it took a year for side effects to occure_ but i guess i have to switch now.,,F,20,20  months,12/14/2006Email,Seasonale
608, 1, Cheaper through insurance.,Severe acne_ weight gain_ loss of sex drive_ dry eyes_ heavy spotting.,I have never had a problem with acne_ and I exercise regularly_ but within the first three months I gained about 10 lbs and began to look as though I had contracted smallpox.  The spotting/loss of sex drive is also embarrassing for my BF and me.  I started taking Seasonale because my copay was cheaper than Yasmin_ but the extra money every month is worth it.  Stopped taking Seasonale mid-cycle and going back to Yasmin.,F,22,6  months,12/11/2006,Seasonale
609, 2, birth control_ less periods,weight gain_ mood swings_ very irritable and lack in sex drive,I have taken this pill for the entire first pack (3months) and have had extremine mood swings and irritablity.  I have gain 10-15 lbs over the last three months.  I was unsure of reason for all of these things_ but know belive they are because of seasonale and will be stopping it ASAP.  Hopefully everything will return to noraml as fast as it changed.,F,27,90  days,12/9/2006,Seasonale
610, 1, reduce periods,Never had acne and I broke out horribly! The first month I was vomiting_ nose bleeds_ and mood swings. That isn't like me at all!,,F,22,4  months,12/9/2006,Seasonale
611, 2, Cramping and Prevent Pregnantcy,moodieness_ lack of sex drive_ break through bleeding each month_ fatigue_ and weight gain.,Seasonale is great in theory_ only four periods a year...but the side effects are less than desirable. I had heavy break through bleeding each month_ and at one point I had so much break through bleeding with such horrible cramps I thought I was having a miscarriage. My doctor said it was just a side effect and it should go away before my next cycle_ but it hasn't. I have no sex drive at all_ and I am so irratible all the time it's making my relationship suffer. I hate this birth control and wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.,F,19,5  months,12/5/2006,Seasonale
612, 2, As a birth control method,Weight gain_ loss of energy_ increased apetite_ reduced sex drive_ irritability.,Was on it for 6 weeks and then had my period for the next six weeks.  Am now on the second packet and have had no spotting_ but the side affects aren't worth it.  I'm going to stop using it.,,43,5  months,12/5/2006,Seasonale
613, 3, PMS breast pain,I started taking Seasonale because of my 2-week PMS breast pain_ and my breasts have hurt ever since.  I need to wear a sports bra almost 24/7.  I'm just starting my third month on it and have been bleeding lightly for over a week (longer than my period usually lasts).  I've also had an unusual amount of cramping.,I haven't particularly noticed weight gain_ but I haven't paid attention.  I really liked not having a period_ and the light bleeding over the past week has only required pantiliners_ which is definitely preferable to wearing pads and tampons.  Still_ I think I'll only go one more round to see if the side effects let up.,F,23,2  months,12/3/2006,Seasonale
614, 2, period pain/suspected endometriosis,Starting at about Day 25 until I gave up on this Pill at Day 45_ I experienced daily light bleeding along with the leg and lower back pain that I normally only experience during my periods. Maybe I should have given this Pill more of a chance_ but I could not bear another month of the constant pain and spotting - I would rather just get the severe pain over with during the one week of my period than drag it out for months on end.,,F,21,45  days,12/2/2006,Seasonale
615, 3, pregnancy prevention,Break-through bleeding around the 6-7 week. problems sleeping_ bloating_ and dryness.,I love the fact that I don't have periods.  I took seasonale for a year in the past and never had a period the entire year.  I would_ however_ have break-through bleeding after having sex.  I have currrently been on seasonale for 6 1/2 weeks and have started spotting.  I was totally freaked out.  I also noticed some cramping before the spotting started.  I know that this is normal with seasonale....but I'm starting to wonder if it is worth it.,F,30,6  weeks,11/30/2006,Seasonale

617, 3, fewer periods,This is my first round of pills and I am finally on my white pills.  I have been on my period for the past 4 weeks and am hoping that it stops when I start the second round.  I am also hungry all the time and am usually not THIS hungry!  Has any one else experienced this?,,F,25,3  months,11/27/2006,Seasonale
618, 2, birth control,I have severe cramps in my abdomen_ like contractions. I have two children_ so I know contractions. Also heavy bleeding for more than 2 months on and off.,When I first began seasonale_ I enjoyed having less periods. Afterwhile the heavy bleeding started_ the severe cramps_ and the mood swings began. I have such a low sex drive that my husband is furious; but I have a low sex drive with all forms of birth control.,F,33,4  days,11/24/2006,Seasonale
619, 2, birth control / fewer periods,I didn't have to much break through bleeding...6 day's per 3 mo. pack.  I did have terrible acne all over my face.  I have never had problems with acne before.  I work out regularly_ but have been gaining weight steadily (5-10 lbs.)  Also_ I am constantly tired.  It has been great not having periods_ but the side effects aren't worth it.  I will be discontinuing use.,,F,42,5  months,11/24/2006,Seasonale
620, 2, pregnancy prevention,Weight gain like crazy! Mood swings. Weight gain. Constant anxiety. Did I mention the weight gain?,I have always been able to maintain my weight_ on and off of other birth control pills. I'd been on this pill for 9 months and gained 25 pounds! Only having a period every three months was nice_ except I constantly worried I was pregnant_ and still had to wait a month and a half or more to get my period to prove I wasn't! I took four pregnancy tests while on this pill_ just to ease my mind. Also_ mood swings were far more drastic than on other pills I'd taken. Bottom line for me? It's definitely worth having more periods if it means not having to buy a whole new plus-sized wardrobe.,F,28,9  months,11/17/2006,Seasonale
621, 3, Heavy cramping bleedind,Have no sex drive. Light bleeding between the 2-3 month for the last 2 packs.,My Fiance and I are really having a hard time with this to the point that I'm ready to go off of it. I love that I have no period for 3 mths..... but I'm not sure that it's worth making him continue to feel like i'm not interested in him.,F,21,9  months,11/15/2006Email,Seasonale
622, 4, trying out new BC methods,Increase in discharge_ skin not as clear.,I've been on Seasonale for about 2 months now and the only side effect that I have noticed is that I discharge more frequently to the point that I have to wear panty liners. (I am wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them?) I've also noticed more breakouts than normal but I think that's just from switching from an Ortho BC to this one. Other than that_ I am pretty satisfied thus far.,F,21,2  months,11/14/2006Email,Seasonale

625, 1, was Dr.'s new freebie birth control,Night sweats (completely soaked shirts_ sheets)_ frequent urination (would have to get up 2-5 times per night)_ breakthrough spotting (had period for up to 1 month at time with all the spotting!)_ intensified cramps & PMS_ absolute and total loss of sex drive (as a newly wed this was quite traumatic)_ hot flashes_ increased irritability,"I had no idea that this was all due to seasonale_ had thought that since i began training for a marathon at approx. same time i began seasonale that maybe it was due to the increase in exercise. But when i spoke with my Dr._ she said Seasonale contains a significant amount less of estrogen_ and that my symptoms indicated a ""mini-menopause""-- and I'm only 29! I highly recommend caution when taking this pill...",F,29,14  months,11/10/2006,Seasonale
626, 1, prevent period,On Seasonale for 6 months.Severe vision problems: saw flashes of light for up to 15 minutes at a time one week apart at same time. Loss of sex drive_ night sweats so bad need shower and change of shirt_ unsatisfiable thirst_ low testosterone  ovarian cysts 5x6x7 cm (teratomas) on both ovaries 1.5 years after quitting Seasonale.,Please see your doctor for Ultra sound to detect cysts if you have been on this drug. Night sweats_ hair growth_ dry skin on legs may be sign of hyperthyroid from cyst that is producing and secreting thyroid or other hormones.,F,35,6  months,11/8/2006,Seasonale
627, 5, BC / fewer periods,NONE,I've been on this product for about 1 1/2 years.  My DR said i should expect some breakthrough bleeding. It's never happened.  Periods last about 3-4 days_ light.  I have no complaints about this pill.  It is wonderful!,F,29,1.5  years,11/2/2006,Seasonale
628, 2, Reduce periods,Anxiety_ depression_ breast enlargement_ mood swings_ irritability_ always tired and hungry_ headaches and occasional dizziness. No weight gain (or loss darn it). No breakthroughs_ though.,Being tired_ anxious and depressed are not what I need my final semester of college_ probably going to stop taking Seasonale. Not worth having fewer periods.,F,21,5  weeks,10/29/2006,Seasonale
629, 1, birth control_ painful cramps,extreme mood swings_breakthrough bleeding_cramps,I was on the depo shot_ which worked great for me_ then my dr. pushed me to switch to seasonale because of the osteoperosis risks of the shot. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!!! I have had nothing but problems since the switch. Extreme mood swings_ painfully sensitive breasts_ weight gain_ painful cramps_ & I've now had by period for 3 weeks straight...I've had it with seasonale!!! These side effects are not worth it!!!,F,28,1.5  years,10/28/2006,Seasonale
630, 1, Birth Control_ reduced periods,Depression_ laziness_ and mood swings! I feel like a different person. Usually I am very upbeat and happy. I had no idea why I was so depressed_ everything is wonderful in my life now. Then I realized I've been depressed about as long as I've been taking this pill (one month). Also acne on my chest and back.,I didn't experience any breakthrough bleeding and missing a period was nice but definitely not worth almost breaking up with my boyfriend because I was so moody. Also hard being in grad school while feeling so lazy. I'm definitely going to stop taking it even though I have two months left in this pack. I can't wait to be myself again. Not worth it!,F,26,5  weeks,10/27/2006,Seasonale
631, 1, Menstrual Migraines,I had immediate weight gain without change in lifestyle_ so much that I took a pregnancy test.  Moodiness and like many others I have completely lost my sex drive.  No spotting at all.,After reading this website that I just decided that I am definately not going to take Seasonale any longer effective today.  I have been taking it for about 1 1/2 years and now realize that the side effects are real after reading this.  I do not recommend this product.  It IS too good to be true to have only 4 periods a year.,F,35,1  years,10/22/2006,Seasonale

634, 2, Painful ovulation,Major weight gain_ breast tenderness_ acne_ fatigue_ spotting,I have weighed the same for 12 years_ except during my two pregnancies_and them I quickly got back to prepregnancy weight.  I have been on Seasonale for 8 weeks and have gained 6 lbs. with no change in eating or exercise habits. I had my tubes tied_ but use Seasonale because of painful ovulation_ and thought 4 periods a year was a plus. I have had constant spotting for the past 10 days. My dr. has changed my pills and told me how to take the new pills so that I won't have regular periods (4 per year like with Seasonale).  My dr. also didn't realize how expensive Seasonale was.  He says he will recommend his patients take traditional_ less expensive BCP and skip the inert pills to avoid having periods. Saturday is my last day on Seasonale. I hope the weight comes off as quickly as it went on.,F,39,8  weeks,10/11/2006,Seasonale
635, 2, prevention of cysts,very frustrated and trying to decide if I should stick with it or give up.  Started bleeding on the 4th day of taking the pill and have not stopped for 6 weeks.  I expected sporadic bleeding or occasional spotting - not having to wear a tampon every day for 6 weeks.  I've also experienced constant cramps and blemishes.  My doctor says it should even out after 6 months but not sure if I can wait that long.,Agree with the comments about sex drive - haven't had sex in 6 weeks because I'm bleeding all the time. Don't think I have the patience for this.,F,41,6  weeks,10/10/2006,Seasonale

637, 1, Endometriosis,weight gain no matter what I do! I never had a problem with any of my other pills- breasts are really sore- and bigger_ a lot of depression_ mood swings_ cramping_ some break through bleeding_ extra tired_ it has affected my sex drive too!,It is nice having your period only once every 3 months- but I don't think its worth it! My periods are still just as apinful as they were before and I have a lot of pain in between as well. I have never been so moody or had any problems with my weight. I thought I would try it for at least a year but these side effects are getting worse if anything. I wish it worked better for me because I was excited about it! I am going to stop this med asap,F,24,14  months,10/5/2006Email,Seasonale
638, 5, birth control_ painful cramping,Nausea and vomiting only the first 3 days after restarting the pill every 3 months.,I love this pill_ minus the side effect. I wasnt sure if anyone else has the vomiting and nausea as a side effect like I do_ it bothers me_ but the overall outcome of this pill makes it worth it.,F,26,2  years,10/2/2006Email,Seasonale
639, 5, fewer periods_ prevent pregnancy,slight nausea during the first month_ light spotting one week before scheduled period_ random headaches,I've read the other reviews on this site_ and a lot of the women are complaining about normal side affects that any good doctor will tell you to expect during the first cycle. I didn't gain any weight_ and I didn't mind spotting leading up to my period (In fact I was expecting it). Of course your body will react when you take hormones. At the end of the day it's worth it to know that I have fewer periods and I'm not getting pregnant. My husband certainly hasn't complained. ^_^ I highly recommend Seasonale.,F,21,3  months,9/27/2006,Seasonale
640, 5, Less cramps_ 4 periods per year,Lost sex drive almost completely_ light bleeding first month and a half of taking it,I have almost comletely lost my sex drive and then the 7 days I am off I am crazy because that's all I can think about.  I feel a little hazy while I'm taking it.  Overall though_ I'd say Seasonale is totally worth it.  I'm very pleased with the results.,F,20,1  years,9/27/2006,Seasonale
641, 2, Birth Control,tender breasts_ breakthrough bleeding/spotting_ felt more irritable_ slight weight gain,At first I was excited to take Seasonale. My breasts were very sensitive for the first few weeks - which I expected since this is the first pill I have been on. That went away which was nice. But the spotting is HORRIBLE. The first pack it was only for about ten days. (My normal period usually lasts only 3 days_ so the ten days was really irritating) But this pack (my second pack)_ I have been spotting for over twenty days. This is ridiculous. I also do not feel well after taking the pill and I have been more irritable. I would not reccommend taking seasonale. I think I am going to try a lower hormone pill.,F,19,6  months,9/25/2006,Seasonale

I had LASIK 3 years ago so I know my eyes are not bad.,I knew about the breakthrough bleeding and lived with it for the first 3 mos.  Then it went away.  However_ I am now having a period at the half mark of my other two packs_ which gives me 8 periods a year.  I am waiting for my one year anniversary in January to see if it evens out_ which I have been told can take up to a year.  I'm sticking with it.  Even at 8 periods a year_ it is definitely worth it to me!,F,35,8  months,9/20/2006,Seasonale

646, 3, birth control and fewer periods,weight gain; bloating; bigger breasts;tired,I am pretty close to finishing my first pack.  Was going to get a refill tonight!  Have been gaining weight uncontrollably_ around 8lbs -only today I questioned myself if it were Seasonale and came to the net.  Lo_ got a shock! Decided that last night's pill is my last.  Have to mention that it was wonderful not getting a period this long_ but all my lemonade and other diets got wasted.  Have to buy new bras_ new pants and new T-shirts :( Last couple of weeks_ I am feeling tired and demotivated and extremely sleepy.  My previous pill did not add weight_ but just to have fewer periods I made the switch that I regret now. But you never know how it works for you unless you try it.,F,33,3  months,9/16/2006,Seasonale
647, 5, heavy periods,None,I love this medication!  I have taken it for a while and never experienced any break through bleeding.  I needed to lose weight anyway_ so I didn't notice any additional weight gain from taking it.  It is wonderful to only have 4 periods a year.  I can't say for sure I haven't been more moody--have two young kids and am sometimes moody anyway.,F,35,2  years,9/15/2006,Seasonale

649, 1, Limit/Lighten Painful Menstration,I have been bleeding for the last 10 days_ it just doesn't stop.  I'm bleeding so much I won't wear light colored pants or shorts.  Granted I just started this medication 20 days ago but I wouldn't let a wound bleed this much without being very concerned.  Today was my last Seasonale pill.,If I had known that I signed up for daily periods_ bloating and PMS I never would have started Seasonale.  Maybe the side effects diminish but it seems too risky; it's not worth the misery.,F,36,20  days,9/15/2006,Seasonale
650, 1, Heavy periods,If the depression and complete loss of sex drive and boob pain weren't bad enough_ the GALLSOTONES certainly made this a TERRIBLE experience for me!,I'm sure this pill is a godsend for some people and even reading the negative experiences listed her_ I probably would have tried it but I wish I'd found this page sooner bc then it wouldn't have taken me 21 months to realize this pill is SOOOOO not for me!,F,29,21  months,9/14/2006,Seasonale
651, 2, prevent pregnancy,loss of sex drive_ depression_ irritability_ tired all the time,I have been on this for 1 1/2 years. I never experienced any breakthrough bleeding or weight gain_ though I have noticed I am hungry more often. I haven't had sex since Christmas '05. My BF thinks its him_ because I am moody_ and just wanting to go to sleep instead of have sex. I will not continue this after this packet is up. I am sad all the time and don't enjoy anything anymore. Until reading these other reviews I thought I was just depressed. But it seems the timeline fits more closely to how long I have been taking this pill. I probably will take a break from another pill to see if I feel better. Can't wait to get back to normal and have a sex life again!,F,27,1.5  years,9/13/2006,Seasonale
652, 3, Ovarian cysts_ painful periods_ BC,enlarged (2 whole cup sizes and still growing)_ constantly tender breasts_ 25 lb weight gain that I cannot lose despite working out and eating healthy_ breakthru bleeding first cycle_ mild mood swings_ no period_ loss of appetite_ dry eyes (contact wearing is limited).,Worked well to prevent cysts_ but side effects (specifically breast tenderness) is unbearable.  No period after the second pack...worried me_ but the doctor told me it was common.,F,22,9  months,9/11/2006Email,Seasonale
653, 2, Birth Control,First two months were great_ had a period the entire third month. Fourth month I realized weight gain_ enlarging of breast. By the sixth month_ i have never felt more insecure about my self. I am 5 foot tall and usually 120_ last month I weighed 147. I felt HUGE. When I finally started my cycle in the sixth month_ the pain was horrible. Cramps woke me up in the middle of the night. (switching to yaz),Less periods was great_ weight gain and pain horrible. Not much break through bleeding though. Recently had a breast reduction and lift about a year ago and now it was almost pointless.,F,21,6  months,9/7/2006,Seasonale

655, 1, PMS & BIRTH CONTROL,Severe depression_ anxiety_ loss of sex drive_ no energy,To make a long story short...I have been off of Seasonale for 2 months and just now starting to get back to being myself.  I honestly feel like I lost about 8 months of my life while taking this pill. I slept all the time_ pushed myself away from my family and friends....everyone in my life was affected by it. I am still seeing a psycologist and taking 4 pills a day to get out of the depression.,F,27,8  months,9/3/2006,Seasonale
656, 5, heavy periods,none,For six years I have been trying to help my heavy periods. I had periods that would continue for 2 weeks straight_ and be heavy the whole time. I could not go for an hour without having to change a super plus tampon. Then I would only have two weeks without a period and then it would start again. This was highly effecting how I could live my life_ and I found it difficult to even go to school when I had my period_ as I couldn't even sit through one class without having to go to the bathroom. I tried many different birth control pills_ but none worked or made any difference at all. I finally tried Depo-provera_ which worked_ but after a year_ I got my period and it lasted for over three months straight. I switched to Seasonale_ and it is the only birth control that has worked for me so far. It has been a miracle and has really saved my life. I have no breakthrough bleeding_ and when I get my periods_ they only last about 4 days_ and are fairly light. I can't say how much this has helped,F,21,2.5  years,8/31/2006,Seasonale

659, 1, ,heavy bleeding and cramping_ nausea_ bloating,i was neauseated for the entire first week_ non-stop. recently_ at the end of the 7th week i began light spotting_ which has turned into heavy bleeding. i've had heavy bleeding for over a week now_ with constant cramps that normal pain relievers CANNOT get rid of. normally my period is 4 days_ with 2 days of cramping_ tops. its now been about 9. after reading other people's reviews_ i'm worried this could go on much longer. this will probably be my first and only pack.,F,19,9  weeks,8/16/2006,Seasonale
660, 1, Birth Control,Weight Gain!!!  Acne!!! Ain't Worth it!!!,"I could not understand why I was having problems with acne @ 32 when this had never been a problem.  The only thing that had changed in my life was my b.c. from Ortho tricyclen to Seasonale. My husband notice the breast enlargement_ but I was in denial.  I wasn't after the jeans were getting way too tight and now days diet & exercise is key.

663, 1, heavy bleeding,irritability_ tired_ hungry_ no sex-drive,"As soon as I started taking this BC my personality completely changed.  I was miserable and I made everyone around me miserable too!  Irritable all the time.  Felt like I needed a nap everyday(not easy with 4 kids).  Hungry all the time!  Sailed right through ""period week""  with no bleeding at all and experienced no break-through bleeding either.  Nice_ but not worth it.  Also_ where there once was a healthy libido_ there is now no sex-drive whatsoever.  I haven't been this unhappy....ever.  I quit 2 days ago and can't wait to be back to normal!",F,30,30  days,7/27/2006,Seasonale
664, 5, endometriosis_ extreme bleeding,I was nauseated the first couple months but that went away. I did spot everyday until the end of my first pack. After the first pack_ I no longer experienced side effects.,I have a double uteris. My bleeding was double the norm. I was in extreme pain and constantly found myself at the hospital during my periods. Taking seasonale has alleviated all of that. I now can live normally. When I do menstruate it is only for 3 days at most and my heaviest day is maybe 1/4 of what I used to experience. I have no pain whatsoever.,F,23,2  years,7/24/2006,Seasonale

I would not recommend this product at all. I'm now on Loestrin (4 months) which didn't make me gain weight_ my acne went away_ and I get a light period for about three days.. MUCH better,F,19,2  years,7/21/2006,Seasonale

669, 1, Birth Control,The first few weeks I had nausea and was dizzy.  I was blotted_ my breast were tender_ I thought that I was pregnant.  A couple weeks later I experienced spotting_ that has elevated to heavy break through bleeding.  I have been bleeding for 3 week now and I am not sure when it will stop.  I have had the worse cramps of my life that have been persistent since day one.  They wake me out of my sleep.  I have taken prescribed pain killers and nothing helps.  I have horrible night sweats.  I feel like I am PMS-ing and going through menopause at the same time. I have NO interest in sex. (which I have not discussed with my man b/c I do not want to hurt his feelings) And my moods have been crazy.  I feel depressed all the time and I do not know why.  I just have not felt like myself since I started taking these pills.,I am going to look into another form of bc. I was going to try to finish my first pack_ but from these comments I think I will stop now.Please be advised that I would very carefully consider taking Seasonale.  I do not think that it is worth it.Like a previous person said_ this is the most effective birth control becasue:1. you lose all interest in sex2. you are too depressed to think about sexor3. you are constantly bleeding so you cannot have sex.I was exicted about the possibility of have a period every three months.  I thought this would improve my relationship_ but it has been total opposite of all my expectations.,F,32,11  days,7/5/2006,Seasonale
670, 2, PMDD/Cramping,Weight gain,I have gained 30 lbs in the past 9 months. It literly will not stop. I can eat nothing and gain 6 lbs within 1 week. It is scary and I am going off this pill. My clothes do not fit and my breasts are huge. Most of the weight gain is in my stomach. I weighted 136 lbs. with the birth of my son 9 years ago and today I feel like I can give birth any day now (I also look like it). I do not reccomend this pill to anyone who is weight consious. It is simply not worth it. I did however enjoy not having a period!,F,,9  days,7/4/2006,Seasonale
671, 5, birth control_ heavy periods,For last two months of my first cycle_ I experienced almost constant breakthrough bleeding but my doctor said (and she was right!) that it should go away doing the next cycle_ no noticable weight gain_ but I was very hungry_ slightly dizzy at times. A little worrisome having to wait three months to be sure you're not pregnant_ but its worth it.,"A lot of people do have outrageous side effects_ but sticking with it was worth it.  My period used to be AWFUL and now it last three days with NO cramps_ bloating_ irritability_ its very effectively prevented pregnancy_ in general I love it!A little expensive though.  If insurance doesn't cover it_ expect to pay 175 every three months.  My pharmacist actually said to me_ ""you have one hell of a copay_ miss""",F,16,7  months,7/1/2006,Seasonale

676, 5, Had to get off of OrthoEvra Patch,2 straight weeks of non-light breakthrough bleeding after 5 months w/ no previous spotting or break through.  Slight weight gain (2-3lbs) after 2 months with no change in diet.  Breast tenderness - never had before.  My eyes have been a bit dryer making wearing contacts a bit uncomfortable.,All-in-all I am very pleased with Seasonale.  I have tried the patch (bad!)_ the ring (always fell out)_ Lunelle (loved_ but was recalled) and the regular pill (bad cramping). I have minimal cramping and less weight gain then with the patch or other pills.  One thing though is that after 5 months of being on it I've been having a solid 2 weeks of bleeding - not light_ other than that I love not having a period all the time which is great.  My mood is improved and cramps are very diminished.,F,27,5  months,6/20/2006,Seasonale
677, 3, birth control,Virtually no side effects with the 1st or 2nd pack_ one month into the 3rd pack_ I began bleeding (not time for the period yet)_ thought it was due to stress.... but i've been bleeding for two weeks...and still bleeding!,I wish I knew about this breakthrough bleeding ahead of time.  I had been on Depo-Provera for 3-1/2 years_ had very little breakthrough bleeding & NO PERIODS!!!...i wish I could go back on it_ but my doc is hesistant due to the warnings about calcium depletion/ostioporosis.  So I started taking this because of the 4 periods a year_ but if I keep bleeding like this_ I might as well go back to regular pills and get my period for a few days every month... at least I know when I would be getting it.,F,29,3  times,6/15/2006,Seasonale
678, 2, PMDD and heavy_ irregular bleeding,weightgain (20+ pounds)_ irritability_ constant break through bleeding_ loss of libido_ vaginal dryness_ horrible acne (never had this issue before; a pimple or two yes_ total facial out breaks only on the SEasonale) and hair thinning,"This did help to level out my extreme mood swings in the five days prior to my period & did decrease bleeding. Also_ I have had a significant decrease in migraines since starting the seasonale. But_ my doctor suggested stopping and trying Estrostep. I have not started taking the Estrostep as we are waiting for a ""normal"" cycle to begin. (Does a normal cycle exsist?)However_ I have lost seven pounds in seven days while not being on BCPs. Never experienced this weight issue on ortho tri cyc.As for acne_ my husband commented just this morning that my face appears to be clearing up...",F,38,18  months,6/14/2006,Seasonale
679, 1, PMDD/perimenopause relief,Painful_ bloated breasts during 1st 2 weeks_ which eventually went away_ but my body remained bloated.  Constant 'spotting'.  Moodiness_ depression & total loss of libido.When I began getting episodes of vertigo with tinnitus & temporary loss of hearing in 1 ear during each episode + numbness in my arms I was so frightened that I went off Seasonale immediately.Dizzy spells stopped & bloating went away within a day of getting off Seasonale & I felt 'normal' again!,I've been on oral BC most of my life_ since I don't want kids. I was hopeful that Seasonale would relieve the PMDD that I've always lived with + something new: the symptoms of peri-menopause. Plus_ the notion of never having another period thrilled me (I had planned to take the pills straight thru my period week).Like most products that have slick ad campaigns_ this 1 looks better than it really is.  It made me feel hormonal & crappy & instead of stopping my period_ I felt as if I had it DAILY.  I had 'breakthrough bleeding' every single day_ I was having angry_ emotional fits & felt just plain crappy - very unlike myself.  When I returned to taking Levlite_ I felt like myself again.  I was amazed that I hadn't realized just HOW awful Seasonale had really made me feel!Immediately after going off Seasonale_ I peed almost nonstop for 24 hours until my bloated body returned to normal!What a waste of my precious time & what a lie.As another woman here said,F,43,70  days,6/7/2006,Seasonale
680, 2, birth control / avoid periods,Weight Gain that I never experienced w/ other BCPbreak through bleeding,WEIGHT GAIN - I have been on MANY other birth control pills_ and always sort of thought the women who said that weight gain was a  side effect of BCP's were just eating too much or something. However_ obviously different pills affect people differently_ because this pill caused me to gain weight uncontrollably for the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. I have been the same size since high school until I started this pill a year ago. When I quit it for a month_ I began to LOSE WEIGHT IMMEDIATELY.,F,30,13  months,6/2/2006,Seasonale
681, 1, Birth Control,Bad mood swings_ and a feeling of doubt_ about things i was definately sure about before.  Felt dizzy a lot two weeks into it.,I would NOT recommend taking seasonale.  After I started taking it_ it seemed like my personality changed.  I had this feeling of doubt and confusion.  It only took a week and a half_ and it caused me to be miserable.,F,18,3  weeks,5/30/2006,Seasonale
682, 3, Severe cramping/birth control.,I had break through bleeding the fifth week and almost the entire third month.  No weight gain but constant bloating_ cramps and headaches.,I am getting ready to start my fourth month so I am hoping the side effects go away.  I considered switching to a different pill but my doctor suggested the side effects should minimize after the first three months so I'm trying to hang in there.,F,34,3  months,5/29/2006,Seasonale
683, 2, birth control,significant weight gain_ mostly in waist and breasts_ migraines_ insomnia,Tried this pill to better handle long_ heavy periods on ortho-tricylen. Have been on for 9 months. I have gained 15 pounds in stomach mostly with out any change in diet/exercise. Experience 3-4 day migraines once per month. I do not experience any break through bleeding. Have started taking sleeping pills to handle insomnia_ which I have never had in the past. But_ it is very nice to only have my period 4 times per year_ no PMS_ lighter periods and less mood swings_  so is all of this worth it? Very hard decision and still not sure what I am going to do.,F,38,9  months,5/29/2006,Seasonale

687, 2, Birth Control,Killed my sex driveWeight Gain,I had no break through beeding. I loved it in the beginning. Now I have absolutley no sex drive what so ever. I have gained 22 pounds even though I cannot eat gluten or sugar_ because of health reasons. I cannot loose the weight. Not that there is much I can remove from my diet. It was great in the beginning_ but these two side effects are not worth it.,F,35,13  months,5/20/2006,Seasonale
688, 1, Birth control,I was on Seasonale for 13 months. During that time I gained over 35 lbs (while exercising and maintaining healthy diet). Two months after starting the pills I began having night sweats. They were so bad I was waking up so wet I had to change my clothes_ shower_ then change sheets_ only for it to wake at least 2 more times through the night. I was test 3 times for TB_ thyroid_ complications due to saline breast implants_ you name it_ they tested me for it. My GYN said I needed to talk to my family doctor that it had nothing to do with my BC. I have suffered severe cramping (no break thru bleeding)_ breast tenderness and enlarged_ depression_ mood swings_ etc. My family doctor has changed my BC back to Ortho TC. I however can not begin it for at least 3 months. I am now taking low dosage hormone therapy to replenish my body and ease the night sweats_ bleeding_ and severe depression.,What I have suffered through the last year was because of Seasonale. My relationships_ work_ and entire life has been damaged because of this BC,F,30,13  months,5/19/2006Email,Seasonale

My gyn was hoping it would control it and shrink the size of my uterus_ which was greatly inflammed.  It did shink it SOME_ but not enough.  And the breakthrough bleeding and migraines were so bad_ he agreed I should stop.  Now I will have thermal ablation to burn off my uterine lining.  I'm done with childbearing_ anyway. I probably won't ever attempt to take any kind of chemical birth control again.  It's just not worth it.  The last two weeks of the pack are HORRID.,F,35,6  months,5/8/2006,Seasonale
695, 1, irregular periods,Weight gain_ constant water retention_ severe mood swings_ severe breakthrough bleeding and cramps,I gained about 10 pounds while on this pill_ despite being very active and careful about what I eat. As I type this I am preparing to switch to Yasmin- we'll see how that goes. Also_ the cramps during the breakthrough bleeding were literally crippling--I found myself unable to get off the couch at times. Also_ the depression I have experienced while on this pill has been very hurtful to both myself and my family; I feel as though I am no longer in control of my emotions. Of course_ the fact that I could no longer fit in any of my pants and the severe pain did not help my mood_ either. I was previously on Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ and stopped taking it because I thought my period would remain regular (which it didn't). To me_ the whole four-period-a-year thing is not worth the trouble; try Ortho before you risk your happiness on this. Of course_ not everyone will experience the same negative symptoms I did_ but if you are considering taking it to cure irregularity I warn you that it may not be,F,19,2  months,5/6/2006,Seasonale

698, 3, To prevent from having a baby,The first week that I started taking the Pill my breast were very sore and now the are very BIG. I was already in a DD so I really didn't need to be any bigger. I didn't have the mood swings or the extra bleeding but I belive that is because I went from Depo to the Pill_ but what I did Have was terrible WEIGHT GAIN I have been on this Pill 3 months and have gained about 30 pounds. And I will not be taking anymore of these pills once this pack is up (5 Days),If I didn't experance the weight gain It would be a great Pill. I just can not deal with being this Big. Oh one more good thing which I don't know if it came from the pill or not but my BUTT is very big now. LOL,F,24,3  months,5/1/2006Email,Seasonale

704, 4, Birth control,Breakthrough bleeding,... But besides that_ all is well.  After being on it a little over a year_ my body just doesn't want to do 3 months on/1 week off.  The breakthrough bleeding is ridiculous.  So my NP said i could break up the 3-months pack down so I can have my period once a month_ and this seems to be working great. I'd rather a few days bleeding vs. months!  The estrogen/progesterone combo seems to not give me any other side effects unlike other pills I've tried_ so I'm happy with it. I have lost my sex drive a bit_ but it's not completely gone.,F,23,1  years,4/13/2006,Seasonale
705, 5, birth control_ endometriosis,mood swings_ minor weight gain_ my breasts also got a bit bigger,I love it!! I had absolutely no break through bleeding and when i did get my period it was lighter then normal and shorter then usual! I had some mood swings and very minor weight gain (probably unrelated even) none of this was any different then my other pills.,F,22,3  months,4/10/2006,Seasonale
706, 2, reduced periods sounds great,continuous spotting_ starting in the second or third week of taking Seasonale.  Almost like a period in the last couple of weeks of the 3rd month.,not satisfied: perhaps the level of hormones is not right for me.  previously took Ortho Lo for a year and a half_ experienced more than occassional spotting with that as well.  Used to take Ortho regular for about 5 years_ with no spotting issues. I'll probably try to switch back_ even if it is a higher dosage its worth not worring about stained panties!,F,25,90  days,4/8/2006Email,Seasonale
707, 1, Endometriosis,Weight gain_ migraines_ breast tenderness/enlargement_ bloating_ abdominal pain_ fatigue_ slight spotting,I'm beginning to think that dealing with the pain of the endometriosis every month is better than dealing with the side effects of Seasonale everyday.  I going to try to finish the 3-month pack_ but I'm not sure that it's worth it!!,F,33,2  months,3/28/2006,Seasonale
708, 1, birth control,extreme weight gain_ breasts got huge_ mood swings_ loss of sex drive,STAY AWAY FROM IT!!! WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!,F,19,3  months,3/25/2006,Seasonale
709, 4, severe PMS birth control,Diarrhea the first week.  Breast pain/tenderness_ and minor enlargement. Mild depression possibly_ but unsure if this is a side effect because of other life stressors.,I had TERRIBLE PMS before taking Seasonale.  I felt severely depressed and emotional before my period and was miserable.  It is such a relief to have some stability in my mood now.  I haven't had any breakthrough bleeding_ so that remains to be seen_ but as of right now_ the side effects are worth me not being totally psycho a week out of every month.,F,32,2  months,3/17/2006,Seasonale
710, 2, menstural cramps,Breakthrough bleeding most of first cycle and now 5th and 6th month_ also cramping,I had tried Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo but it affected my mood_ irritable_ crabby_ also nauseous. I didn't have any mood fluctuations with Seasonale. I have had decreased sex drive_ vaginal dryness_ and the constant breakthrough bleeding just hasn't been worth it_ also cramps_ and clotting.,F,39,6  days,3/15/2006,Seasonale
711, 2, Birth Control,spotting_ almost 3 months straight,I know some spotting was warned_ but it felt like I had a period for almost 3 months straight. dr recommended taking 2 a day for a couple days_ but as soon as i went back to 1_ the bleeding returned.  May have worked eventually_ but very inconvienent and too long for me,F,22,3  months,3/15/2006,Seasonale
712, 1, Birth Control,Break through bleeding_ nausea_ vomiting_ severe depression_ anxiety_ sore breasts_ loss of sex drive,Light bleeding started 1 1/2 weeks after taking 1st pill_ lasted 2 weeks.  Going into my fourth week_ and have been very tired with no energy_ sleeping a lot_ no sex drive_ and feeling very depressed and sad for no reason_ I'm usually very upbeat and happy_ and I feel like I cant function at my job.  My skin has also broken out. As I'm typing I feel like laying my head on my desk and going to sleep_ or crying.  I feel really crappy right now.  I'll probably switch back to Tri-Cyclin.,F,30,28  days,3/15/2006Email,Seasonale
713, 5, SEVERE mood swings,completely stopped my mood swings...i was really bad. because i only have a period every three months my hormones aren't out of control and making me crazy! i love it! i had some breakthrough bleeding in the first couple of months but went away. no decrease in sex drive (i think it's gone up!) no weight gain or insomnia.,entering into my 18th month i suddenly got some breakthrough bleeding that has lasted almost 3 weeks with a few severe cramps (which freaked me out at first_ because i'd never heard of this!). but the lack of mood swings still make this a great choice for me!!! do not regret it at all_ will stick with it for a long time!,F,26,19  months,3/8/2006Email,Seasonale
714, 5, Period reduction and endometriosis,The side effects I have had were/are mild weight gain_ breast tenderness (and larger) and some discharge like the one patient said_ and I experience slight PMS about 2 weeks before my period is due_ something I never had before.  My cramping is under control now_ not nearly as bad as before taking this pill.  Have had NO breakthrough bleeding since the begining_ actually had expected to get it.,I would recommend this to others.  In fact I have mentioned it to my boss' wife who is looking into getting new birth control. Though_ I didn't let her know all side effects because she may not have what I do but then hers could be worse_ just told her to watch the side effects.  I am very satisfied with this birth control pill.,F,36,1  years,3/7/2006,Seasonale
715, 2, less periods,break through bleeding all the time after the first month and during the first month of no period I had VERY BAD abdominal pain!!,I am going to stop taking it after this pack is over. I have 2 weeks left of my first 3 months. I have not had good luck with this pill at all.,F,27,3  months,2/20/2006Email,Seasonale
716, 4, Endometriosis_ Breakthrough Bleedin,breakthrough bleeding in the first two cycles_ but went away_ weight gain_ PMS in final two weeks cycle,Compared to 5 years of breakthrough bleeding in a 30-day cycle_ this has been wonderful. I can take two weeks every 3 months of PMS after two weeks every single month. Weight gain was significant_ but everything comes with a price.,F,29,330  days,2/16/2006,Seasonale
717, 3, b/c and painful periods,Weight gain_ depression_ larger breasts_ breakthrough bleeding for the first month,I quit smoking around the same time I started using this product_ so originally I attributed the weight gain to that. However_ I have quit smoking before and been able to diet myself out of any significant weight gain. Not so now. And I notice this seems to be a more common complaint for people 35+ using this pill. I have had some 'bottoming out' as far as getting depressed_ but it doesn't seem to last too long. I was going to see if I could get this all under control by the time I finish my second pack.,F,36,4  months,2/14/2006,Seasonale
718, 5, Birth control,Not sure if these are side effects: total loss of sex drive_ no response to sexual stimulation_ very irritable_ chest pain.,I have been on this pill for a month_ before I was on levora. It's hard to say if my issues are related to this pill_ but I am going to watch and see how the next few months go. No break through bleeding so far.,F,28,32  days,2/13/2006,Seasonale
719, 1, Birth Control,Queasy feeling_ moody_ irritable_ lowered libido_ spotting for weeks_ migraines,Four periods a year sounds great and started taking this b/c my period week on Alesse was slightly emotional but nothing like this. From what I've read the period week on seasonale is even worse....,F,27,11  weeks,2/13/2006,Seasonale
720, 3, Birth Control,Nausea for the first few weeks + sore breasts (was CONVINCED I was pregnant - not fun!).  I hoped my libido would come back after 2 years on Yasmin_ but no luck so far.,I did not experience any breakthrough bleeding on this pill - but had been warned and so was careful to take it at the same time each day.  I have really enjoyed not having to think about my period.,F,25,3  months,2/9/2006,Seasonale
721, 4, birth control,break-through bleeding lasting 2 weeks+,I love Seasonale. I've been on it over a year and never noticed anything bad until recently. I dont know if it's all stress related or not but I got an extra period (which I'm sure is breakthrough bleeding since I shouldnt have a period for another 2 months) but it's almost been 3 weeks now which is a pain! I wont give up on Seasonale yet though :),F,22,1.5  years,2/8/2006Email,Seasonale
722, 3, birth control,Break-thru bleeding the first 3 months_ but not enough to warrant giving up on it.  However_ I have experienced mood swings_ and I have days of being extremely emotional.  The first week back on the active pills is always rough for me...and my family!,I really like the concept of this pill_ and wish it worked better for me. I've been on Seasonale for almost a year_ and love the convenience of it_ but the mood swings and exaggerated emotions are not worth it anymore.  I hoped it would go away_ but no such luck.,F,35,10  months,2/6/2006Email,Seasonale
723, 2, Reduction in periods,Heavy breakthrough bleeding_ fatigue_ decreased libido_ indigestion_ weight gain,I was okay with all of the side effects until I started having the breakthrough bleeding. It's horrible_ much worse than a regular period and now I am having to take rescue meds to get it under control.,F,32,10  weeks,2/3/2006,Seasonale
724, 2, birth control,I still got my period after every mo and once it lasted 18 days.  Loss of libido.,No PMS or cramps though_ which is good_ but I am very dissapointed that I didn't get to experience the joy of 4 periods a year.,F,33,5  months,2/1/2006,Seasonale
725, 1, birth control,CONSTANT breakthrough bleeding--like having a light period for sometimes up to 6 weeks at a time!  Also loss of sex drive (largely because of insecurity about never knowing when I would start bleeding_ but I suspect also hormonal) and vaginal dryness.,,F,25,13  months,1/30/2006,Seasonale
726, 5, bc,light spotting in the first 2 months,fabulous pill--I feel great on it and take it straight through_ so I only have one period a year_ and it only lasts abotu 4 days with very light bleeding. No complaints at all!,F,32,2  years,1/27/2006,Seasonale
727, 2, birth control/endometriosis,Breakthru bleeding_ mood swings_ loss of sex drive_ exhaustion,"I was all about one period every three months_ but after ""breakthrough bleeding"" for two weeks (once a month)_ I'd much rather be on a 30 day cycle.  It takes away any spontaneity in your sex life (you NEVER know when the breakthru bleeding will start)_ and your libido will have dropped 50%.  Just not worth it.",F,25,9  months,1/24/2006,Seasonale
728, 2, Birth Control/ Less periods,"Breakthrough bleeding after the 2nd month_ VERY sore breasts_ constant worry that I MAY be pregnant and not know it... and something my gynocologist described as ""sloughing"" I had large chunks of what looked like skin or very stretchy discharge... EW! I'd rather have a period every month.","I switched back to my regular pill after the 5th month.. it somehow didn't seem right to not have my period every month and the bleeding and ""sloughing"" was nasty.",F,27,5  months,1/19/2006,Seasonale
729, 5, birth control/painless periods,I have only been taking Seaonale for 1 month.  So far I have had no bleeding whatsoever.  My breasts are very sore_ though so maybe that means they are growing; lol!!  It has not made me tired_ moody and I have had no unusual symptoms.,So far I love this pill......Great to only have a period every 3 months.,F,26,1  months,1/17/2006,Seasonale
730, 2, Reduction of PMS symptoms,Breakthrough bleeding after week 7-8. Nausea. Anxiety and depression. Mood swings. Irritability Highly decreased libido.,I don't advise anyone to take this medication. I have just gotten off of it to switch to a monthly cycle pill. After starting this pill I developed an anxiety problem and became extremely moody. I also completely lost my interest in sex.,F,18,1  years,1/17/2006,Seasonale
731, 3, birth control,I have experienced extreme moodiness_ moderate depression_ and complete loss of interest in sex.  No weight gain though.,I thought this stuff worked miracles_ only 4 periods a year! Yay!  But_ due to the decrease in my libido and increased depression_ I am considering trying something else.  It has been a year_ and I hoped my sexual interest would return but it has not_ and my love life has suffered immensely.  How ironic that a pill that allows me to have as much sex as I want with out risk of pregnancy_ has decreased my interest in sex down to the point where I don't need birth control because I don't want to have sex. AAAHH!,F,25,1  years,1/16/2006,Seasonale
732, 4, Excessive Bleeding,Spotted during and towards the end of the 3rd month but it went away about 15 months into taking it.  Mild irratablity and low threshold for annoyance.,15 months sounds like a lot but remember that it's 1 period every 3 months.  Definatly worth it!!,F,18,3  years,1/10/2006Email,Seasonale
733, 2, Birth Control,Some irritability/mood swings_ but I have had this with just about all BCP's.  Worst was constant breakthrough bleeding.,I loved only having to fill an Rx every 90 days.  However_ breakthrough bleeding lasted from 2-5 weeks! Like having a constant light period. Very annoying/inconvenient since it was unpredictable.,F,27,1  years,1/9/2006,Seasonale
734, 2, birth control_ period regulation,Constant breakthrough bleeding_ breast tenderness_ bloating,started seasonale instead of regular pill so I wouldn't have monthly periods interrupting my sex life (my periods are long and heavy) but the neverending breakthrough bleeding has interfered even more than regular periods.,F,32,10  weeks,12/11/2005,Seasonale
735, 1, birth control,abdominal cramping_ breast tenderness_ weight gain_ larger breasts_ complete loss of libido,This is the most effective birth control on the market since it kills your sex-drive completely and makes you feel about seven months pregnant. I had to take myself off and switch to a different pill after 6 months since I could not stand feeling crappy any longer.,F,36,6  months,12/6/2005,Seasonale

738, 3, birth control,I didn't get any breakthrough bleeding until the 3rd month.  While it was great not having a period for 3 months_ I felt like I had major PMS for the whole last month.

739, 1, Avoid PMS as often,Bloating_ weight gain_ mood swings_ and break-through bleeding for over 2 weeks straight,I starting to take Seasonale to avoid the side effect of being tired all the time from taking Sarafem for PMS.  My tubes are tied so I was not taking it for birth control reasons.,,41,2  months,11/10/2005,Seasonale
740, 3, to reduce PMS symptoms,reduced and almost eliminated mood swings and PMS symptoms such as severe cramping and fatigue_ after a year and a half I still experience some very light break through bleeding but it's still beter then getting a monthly period.  Worst side effect: completely lost sex drive!!!,Would stay on this if it weren't for the loss of sex libido.,F,25,2  years,11/8/2005,Seasonale
741, 3, Endometriosis,Been nauseated_ vomiting off and on_ Had abdominal pain_ and still have same amount of cramps and pain from Endo..,Good thing about Seasonale..Not dealing with monthly periods and more pain during PMS..Also no break through bleeding for me on this one...,F,29,2  months,11/5/2005,Seasonale
742, 4, Birthcontrol,I have had major mood swings (so my husband says). I had a little bit of break-through bleeding the first couple of months. I was very emotional at the end of the 3rd month.,Other than the mood swings and the rollar coaster ride of my emotions I have been pleased with Seasonale. This is the first birthcontrol pill that I have not gained weight on!!! ,F,24,3  months,11/3/2005,Seasonale

746, 5, birth control,the first week my stomache was a little upset_ i had some breakthrough bleeding in the beginning about every 7-8 weeks_ i didn't mind though because it was still better than a period every month.,Since its a 90 day supply_ some insurance companies make you get it through the mail_ which is better anyway because its cheaper.,F,25,12  months,9/15/2005,Seasonale
747, 4, birth control_ period regulations,Mood swings.  During the first couple weeks I took it_ I had an abnormally short fuse.  Everything has been pretty normal since_ though.,Aside from the moods_ this pill has posed no problem for me.  I have had no breakthrough bleeding_ no other obvious side effects.  I did gain a few pounds_ but it may have been unrelated as I have already shed them.,F,23,12  months,9/14/2005,Seasonale
