0, 3, STD,Nausea_ Stomach Pains_ drowsiness and definitely a lot of diarrhea. And one panic attack,"Everyones body is different_ I noticed women have it worst off from this medicine and idk why. But for me I took this around 2pm today after eating Popeyes and 15-20 minutes later I felt like I got the stomach bug with severe stomach pains and nausea_ running to the toilet to go number 2. After that I had a panic attack because I wasn't expecting this feeling. However as the day has been going on I continue to get a bit of sour stomach and nausea before each episode of needing to go to the bathroom. I feel like eating before is a must and drink water or it would have been worse!! It's 5:23 pm and things seem to be settling with very minor stomach pains here and there. I hate the doctors and medicine in general_ they'll give you anything to charge your insurance_ there's better alternatives then this ""fu*k you now you feel sick as hell"" Zithromax pill. As long as this works I'll be happy but never again. Lesson learned.",M,20,1  days1000MG,8/5/2016Email,Zithromax

2, 1, Bronchitis,Severe stomach pains_ anxiety_ anger_ depression_ insomnia_ diarrhea_ massive headache_ vomiting,I just started this today not even 24 hrs ago and I'm have many side effects. I took this antibiotic before and it was all fine but now i can barely stay out of the bathroom because of constant throwing up/diarrhea. And when I'm talking to someone I seem to snap out of nothing! I don't have an history with anxiety or depression but I am very sure I had a panic attack and I couldn't slip crying and feeling just awful. I felt better without this drug. Don't take it. It has far to many side effects that happen way to often,F,17,1  days,7/14/2016Email,Zithromax
3, 1, Some sort of bacterial infection,I took two pills the first day_ one pill the second day as directed. After about 30 hours of taking pills 1&2_ the side effects started. Right ear plugged up_ vertigo began. within 4-6 hours_ panic_ sweats_ vomiting. All bad. I did not take the day 3 dose. I went to the doctor instead. Got a different antibiotic. It's been approximately 6 days since my first dose and I'm still not right. Fatigue is harsh_ still a wee bit disoriented. This drug can't get out of my system fast enough. The side effects seemed to be waning yesterday to the point i declared myself nearly 100%_ but last night i felt like i had a vertigo/insomnia relapse. Mild_ but still kept me up for hours.,take at your own risk.,M,42,2  days500mg 1X D,6/16/2016Email,Zithromax
4, 1, Bronchitis,"First_ you feel a little ""off"" with some weird depression. It feels like doom and gloom. Then you can't eat a thing. Then you develop SEVERE anxiety and panic attacks (heart palpitations_ nausea_ chest pressure_ etc) for no apparent reason. This is how this drug affected me. I was dry heaving all the time. If there was pepper cooking_ I would feel it in my throat and heave. I would vomit from the panic and then panic because I'm vomiting. I had a great job--a math teacher. I took this drug for bronchitis (which ended up being viral) all because my mom wanted me to. She was worried that it would get worse. And I took this evil drug. I couldn't work. I was teaching using post it notes. It was insane. After stopping this drug_ the symptoms of anxiety got worse. Sometimes I felt like I couldn't breathe. I totally isolated myself because even TALKING would make me heave if I breathed funny. For an entire year_ I barely spoke. All I did was read and play jigsaw puzzles while watchi",Some people just need time (a LOT of time) and their symptoms will subside. I wasn't that lucky. I try to post this on here from time to time (although it's been a few years at this point)_ but someone emailed me about this and I decided to post again_ PLEASE email me if you have any questions. There is hope. You are not alone. You can get through this. Good luck to all of you.,F,36,5  days500mg 1X D,6/12/2016Email,Zithromax

A week after that I was still experiencing sore joints and back pain_ acid reflux so I went back to the hospital_ Doctor ran test said I was dehydrated and said I had an uti.

It sped me up. I was sick and up cleaning bc of the med. Every side effect I experienced is on the rare list which just blows my mind.,I have read articles on this medicine and the potential for death by heart attack is scary. Especially since my chest has bothered me since I started it. I'm a healthy 40 yr old female but the fact that my chest bothered me is the reason I sought out info. I workout daily but something is wrong. My husband just finished same dose. He was sick too but worse and it did nothing. We just got back from Dr and he's now on doxycycline.

23, 1, Sinus Infection,Worst medical experience of my life,I was given Zithromax for a severe sinus infection. I am pregnant_ and this was recommended to be best for pregnant women. I was prescribed to take 2_ 250 MG pills on the first day_ but at the advice of my pharmacist_ only took one the first day. I took the first pill around 3 PM_ after a late lunch. Picked up my son and drove home and felt completely fine. I sat down and realized i couldn't read the words on the TV_ so i took out my phone and did the same_ with the same results. The words were blurred and i had a sudden terrible headache behind my eyes .. i laid down for about 20 minutes thinking i was having a migraine (never had one before-but knew symptoms) .. i thought i was better so i stood up_ only to realize that my hands were completely numb and my arms were tingling. After this my mouth/tongue/neck all became tingly and i couldn't get my words out! I was having what i thought was a stroke! My husband was completely freaked out and drove me to the ER_ as i had never experienced anything like this before and i wasn't thinking it could be from a z-pak! Levels were fine_ tests were ran and lots of money were spent .... all because of this medicine. No one in my family will ever be prescribed this drug again! I also suffer from mild anxiety_ and like a lot of others have said_ this is absolutely not a drug for people who already suffer from this ... my heart was beating so fast and i had never had a reaction like this before. BEWARE.,F,27,1  days250MG 1X D,3/3/2016,Zithromax

37, 1, Atypical respiratory infection,Only had minor GI upset but psychological effect is almost unliveable. I have no history of mood or anxiety disorders but this drug gave me MAJOR anxiety_ worry_ fear_ depression_ panic. like a lot of other posts I had almost constant feelings of impending doom and dread. Constant vivid nightmares about death and dying. Extreme paranoia and hypochondria made worse by the amount of aches and pains it causes. At one point I counted up 12 different life threatening illnesses I was convinced I had. My life would have to literally depend on it for me to take this drug again. Last  2 months have been hell_ and I still need to wait for drug to wash out my system.,Think very carefully before taking.

The panic attacks were terrible.I only had 3 pills_ and was sick for over a week. It has been almost 2 weeks; since I took the last pill_ and I am still at times feeling side effects. Conducted research as I thought I was going nuts; found out that there are 2 forms of Zithromax_ Pfizer and PLIVA_ I had the PLIVA (white) pills; not the Pfizer (pink) pills. I do not know if this was the major difference as I have taken Z Pack many times before and never had a problem. This is the worse medicine. I asked the Pharmacist if they had changed the formula she indicated to me that there were no changes. Something has changed.

I'll take this drug any day rather than die a slow_ painful death from pneumonia or sepsis.  For the all the folks on this board whining about the side effects of this antibiotic_ you have obviously never taken Flagyl. Let's keep the side effects in context. Folks_ otherwise healthy people (many of them children) used to drop dead from a wide variety of disease on a daily basis.

It was an endless torturous experience. Didn't link all of this with Zithromax and so wasted loads of money on Upper GI endoscopy_ X-rays_ MRI scan_ ear tests_ CT scan of abdomen_ Ultrasound_ blood work which in turn resulted in ridiculous prescriptions like Nexium_  Ganaton and further antibiotics. Blood work also found elevated levels of liver enzymes and cholesterol levels.,After a protracted period of heartache_ frustration and depression_ I gave up all those medications that arose from an array of misdiagnoses and by sheer luck_ read up about the effects of antibiotics on the web and as per suggestions from some people with similar experience_ started out with a strong probiotics brand called VSL3 which has 100 billion strains of live cultures. The impact was almost miraculous I must say - after a tantalizing 9 months_ I felt human once again. After almost a year on probiotics_ I am still recovering from the horrible damage it did to my gut flora. MY ADVISE - STAY AWAY FROM THIS LIKE PLAGUE.,M,40,4  days500 2X D,11/8/2015Email,Zithromax

On the third day my skin started getting a little itchy but continued taking because I saw no rash. The next week my symptoms hadn't gone away and my eyes starting yellowing. Went into the doctor and my liver enzymes were all too high. Doctors tested for everything and couldn't figure it out; I was sent to a liver specialist (after an ultrasound_ CAT scan and countless blood tests) who determined I had drug-induced hepatitis from the zpack. It's almost 2 months later and my enzymes are still high. Wishing this would go away_ I have extremely intense pruritus_ constipation_ jaundice_ lost 15 pounds and severe fatigue,Will not EVER take again,F,19,5  days500_ 250mg,8/11/2015Email,Zithromax
60, 3, precautionary,One mega-dose because my boyfriend has a uti that won't go away and they were worried that we might have some urethritis.  I never felt sick and they didn't test me for ureaplasma or mycoplasma.  I wish they had tested me before just prescribing this huge dose to a 107 pound woman.  I already suffer from anxiety and my worst phobia is vomiting.  So I take this drug and I feel like I'm going to throw up and I'm having panic attacks like I haven't had in years.  I don't recommend this drug for people with clinical anxiety.  I took the one mega-dose on a Sunday and still felt like throwing-up after supper on Tuesday.  I'm relieved to read the posts here because it sounds like that is a normal side-effect and I'm not dying after all - lol.,,F,57,1  days2000 1X D,7/22/2015,Zithromax
61, 1, Strep,My 6 year old daughter was prescribed this medicine for strep throat since she is allergic to amoxicillin (facial swelling) .

After the course the pain disappeared_ but now I was going to discover the worst side effects: anxiety_ pounding heart_ pins and needles on my upper arms_ tingling feeling in my mouth and lips. Strange metal-like taste in my mouth. A feeling of 'not being myself '. Last night severe tinnitus and heavy breathing. Was soooo tired_ but didn't dare to go to sleep....

75, 1, Sinus infection,Sinus infection had moved to lungs_ lots of coughing. On second day of Z-Pak I woke up at 2 in the morning with stomach cramps_ not your usual gas type of cramps_ totally debilitating cramps_ followed by diarrhea_ which lasted for over an hour. Profuse sweating_ felt that I may pass out. Then I remembered Z-Pak was prescribed a few years ago_ I had the same symptoms_ I thought back then it was part of what was ailing me. Realized it was because I am allergic to this medicine. I am now on Levofloxacin for a week_ feeling a bit dizzy_ bit of blurry vision and forgetfulness. Not sure if it is from the new pills_ (as they both have side effects)_ or the residual Z-Pak left in my system.  I have a busy teaching schedule_ but this will not keep me down. Definitely will not take again. I think I will do more checking next time something is prescribed and check out the side effects.

Every day since ( has been 4 days) anxiety and nightly insomnia_ hot flashes_ rapid heart rate_ chills and shaking. Went to the ER where I had a normal EKG and they gave me Benadryl and Ativan to help me sleep. Slept 10 hours the next day_ but all symptoms were back that night and the next. Antihistamines don't help at all. The only consolation is that my infection seems to be cleared up as those symptoms have gone.,The GI symptoms were mild and expectable.

80, 2, Sinusitis and Bronchitis,= Severe stomach upset= Lightheaded= Sweating= Anxiety= Itching= Headaches,My adventures with ZPak began on a Monday with the 500MG megadose. I took it with a meal_ as directed by PCP. After 1/2 hour_ I began to feel some stomach upset. It was like indigestion_ but with a feeling of hunger. It was like there was an emptiness in my stomach. Then the cramps began. They were like major gas pains and I could only find comfort when lying on my side and staying very still. I didn't get much sleep the first night. I was awake just about every hour. I had a sense anxiety that something bad was going to happen. I have never suffered from anxiety or depression_ and if this is what they feel like_ I now sympathize with those who suffer from them! Day 2_ I reluctantly took the 2nd dosage because my congestion was beginning to thin and coughing much less frequently. I felt weak and zombie-like_ and I still had the stomach pain_ but was able to push through and function for most of the day. At times I felt lightheaded_ words didn't seem to come easily when I spoke; slight ringing in my ears; my face was itchy_ and I wondered if the effectiveness of the drug was really worth the side effects I was encountering. After googling the side effects of Zithromax_ late in the day_ I ate some yogurt_ drank some ginger ale and took an acidopholus supplement. Wow_ I began to feel better within about an hour!Day 3 I took the ZPak with yogurt and ginger ale_ followed by an acidopholus tab about an hour later. The drug definitely is working at this point.

I also experienced chest pains like a stabbing feeling in my chest. I am now on amoxicillin because I think I am allergic to it_ but I am STILL feeling the effects of this terrible drug. I can't wait to feel like me again. Oh and the half life is about 2.5 days or 68 hours so I really don't know how long it's going to be before I feel like me again. I hope soon.,DONT TAKE THIS DRUG.

84, 1, Sinusitis and Ear Infection,I started taking this drug as prescribed by my PA for my sinusitis and ear infection in March of 2014. After about day three I lost nearly all smell and nearly all taste. It has been a year and I still can not smell or taste much at all and everything has a metal taste and everything has a nasty smell. Pretty bad when you can't smell a skunk and boy do they ever stink. I guess that is the only perk of taking this drug.,I am VERY unhappy. I took this drug on the recommendation of my PA and will NEVER take this again_ After one year and still I cannot taste or smell_ well it is upsetting.

All of a sudden_ I found myself short of breath_ almost gasping for air at times. Anxiety has never been an issue for me. While on this medication_ I began to ponder every bump_ ache_ and feeling on my body as if it was a life threatening one. I couldn't focus on a single thing_ my mind essentially raced 24/7. Negative thoughts were all that got into my head_ nothing helped_ even exercise. Trouble sleeping_ stomach issues (I knew that would happen) among other things. I just felt disconnected from everything. I had taken a lower dosage (250mg for 5 days) a year before with no issues. Maybe it was a higher dosage and the red dye? Either way_ been a month and I'm still not fully ""there"". The only thing that has honestly helped has been chamomile tea. Within a half hour of drinking my first cup_ it was the best I felt since I took that firs",Seriously consider the mental/physical side effects listed on here. I feel like I lost a month of my life due to this medication. Can't remember parts of it_ which is very scary to me. Had to go with natural anxiety remedies since I've never had that problem in my life. Chamomile tea has saved me_ at least with the sleeping part.

I freaked out. That same morning I went to a doctor and he said I was reacting to the antibiotic and gave me a week of pro-biotics and Spasmomen for intestinal spasms. Symptoms continued for over 3 weeks and went to see another doctor who said that recovery in a situation like this can take months_ since the drug wreaked havoc on the gut flora. It ́s been almost 2 months now_ and recovery has been slow and painfull. Hopefully I'll never have to take this drug or any antibiotic again...ever!, This drug should be re-evaluated.

169, 4, swollen tonsils,I was fine the first three days_ then started experiencing minor chest and abdominal pain by day 4. Day two I had very minor bowel problems. I am put on zpacks quite often (250_ 5 day pack every 1-2 months) due to chronic tonsillitis. The main drawback is the restlessness/anxiety.  I have to take twice my normal dose of antianxiey meds when on the zpack.,Overall_ I think the benefits outweigh the cons_ clears up my tonsillitis in 48 hours and no other medicine has done that for me.,F,21,5  days250 1X D,1/13/2014,Zithromax

By the night of day 3 the cramps were all night long from my calves down into my ankles and feet.  I don't feel it's helping my infection much yet either.  I feel lost and these cramps in my legs and feet are the worst ever_  ugh!  I've found little on the Web about this which surprises me.

174, 1, Sinus infection,Day 1 took the 500mg starter dose. 3 hours later developed a headache and pressure in the back of my neck and forehead. Still hasn't gone away completely. Day 2_ second dose taken (hoping it wasn't the antibiotic causing issues) 3 hours after severe head pressure_ weird taste and sensation on tongue_ severe pain in diaphragm w vomiting. Felt like an air bubble getting larger w no relief. Felt like I had to run to to the bathroom but regardless of trying to go I couldn't. Pain was intense. Swelling in fingers with red and burning. Face started flushing. I think I'll just deal with the infection naturally. These side effects are not worth the trouble and pain.

I had no appetite and had diarrhea. I went to the ER while on the 3rd day and they said I was having anxiety and to keep taking the antibiotic. I have been off the Zithromax for two days and I still feel anxious and have shortness of breath. Hopefully it wears off soon. I'm glad I researched the antibiotic and I learned that I'm not alone.

179, 1, Bronchitis,Rapid mood swings_ depression_ anxiety_ uncontrollable crying for no apparent reason_ difficulty sleeping_ loss of appetite_ flushed red patches on face_ diarrhea_ loose stools,I am 29 weeks pregnant and was prescribed this medication for bronchitis. On the night that I began taking the medication_ I had an episode where I felt like I was literally going crazy. These episodes continued in the evenings after taking the medication. Throughout the day I would have crying spells for no apparent reason which would include shortness of breath. I have had no appetite since I began taking the medication and I have to force myself to eat regular meals. I am not experiencing feelings of pleasure when taking part in activities that I normally enjoy. Loose stools and diarrhea occurred on days 4 and 5 of taking the medication. Everyone minimized the symptoms I was having because I was pregnant. They assumed I was overreacting to normal symptoms of pregnancy_ despite the fact that I knew the way I was feeling was not a normal part of pregnancy. Unfortunately_ I did not make the connection that it could be side effects of the medication until after I had taken the last dose. Once I found this website and read comments from others who have had similar experiences_ I was convinced that everything I was experiencing was because of the medication. I will NEVER take this medication again. This was the first time and the last time. I just hope the symptoms decrease and the medication gets out of my system soon.,F,36,5  days250 mg 1X D,11/30/2013Email,Zithromax

185, 1, Pneumonia,This is easily the worst pharmaceutical experience of my life!  I was told this would build up in my system & continue to work for 10 days (LONG half life).  Sure enough on day 6_ I felt my throat closing up_ extreme dizziness_ lethargy & trouble putting words together.  This occurred on a walk & it took all my energy to make my legs move forward.  So scared I actually called someone & kept them on the phone in case I needed 911.  It felt like I was having a stroke! The brain fog_ vertigo_ heart palpitations & lethargy continue on day 12!  Sometimes it feels like narcolepsy--like I could pass out while sitting even.  Strange otherworldly disconnection_ drowsiness & swimming sensation.  Exhausted after the least exertion.  I called & spoke to 3 different doctors regarding these symptoms.  I was given neurological tests (negative)_ told to get a chest X-ray (negative) & prescribed Dramamine for dizziness (ineffective).  Not one doctor suggested it could be this dangerous drug_ even though the FDA issued warnings earlier this year.   This drug can kill!  I will never take it again.  Thanks to this forum I have hope but still no idea how long it will continue to vex me.  If there is a class action lawsuit_ count me in!!  This drug should be taken off the market!,,F,43,5  days,11/9/2013,Zithromax

187, 4, Strep Throat,Dizziness_ vertigo_ tingling in hands and arms_ ringing in the ears_ mental fog_ complete loss of voice for several days,I have limited options because of significant allergies to most antibiotics.  I took 10 days of amoxicillin for strep throat_ but it failed to clear the infection.  My doctor immediately moved me to a 6 day_ 500 MG treatment of Zithromax.  This medicine did clear up the strep throat_ as those symptoms vanished after the fourth day.  Numerous side effects were experienced.  The most alarming was that I completely lost my voice on day 4 of treatment and it was several days before I could speak at all.  The dizziness and vertigo prevented my return to work since I could not stand up without falling over.  The mental fog has been the most difficult side effect to overcome.  I have not had mood swings or unusual thoughts as other people have mentioned_ but I have had trouble forming complete thoughts or even remembering simple things since around day 3 on Zithromax.  The side effects do fade a little each day_ but it seems to take roughly a month to get back to normal after the medicine is done.  I would take the medicine again simply because it cleared the strep throat that other antibiotics could not_ but patients should definitely beware the numerous side effects.,F,36,6  days500 MG 1X D,9/30/2013,Zithromax

Doctor recommended this medicine because you only take it once a day for 5 days. Day 1 I took the 2 pills and felt better - aka sinuses were draining and I had more energy_ Day 2 I thought I suffered a breakdown. Felt extremely anxious at work_ started crying for no reason_ very odd. I was doing fine before this pill. Day 3-4 extreme fatigue_ feeling depressed.

That night I had terrrrible diarrhea witj my normal stomach cramps. I def went to be not feeling so hot. I woke up this morning_ got ready for work_ and spent the next hour in the bathroom hurling over with intense intestinal cramping. Stool was thick and slimy mixed with diarrhea and it was causing a painful burning trying to pass anything. I forced myself to call out of work and im glad i did.

The insomnia alone lasted for 6 months_ and weird emotions with which I'd never had problems in the past: Dread_ Fear_ Depersonalization were horrific.  My heart would suddenly race at any sudden sound.  A couple of people on this forum helped me get through it.,"You would think that I would never take the drug again_ but was talked into ""re-challenging"" my system with name-brand Zithromax by a friend  / physician I've known for 25 years_ as I was running out of treatment options.I purchased the name-brand Z-Pack ($90) and after saying a prayer_ started.  To my great relief_ none of the life-changing symptoms that I experienced last time occurred_ other than my heart lightly pounding for brief periods.  I almost can't believe that I tried to take it again- I swore that after the hell I went through there would be no way.

193, 4, Bronchitis-like Bug,"Ufa -- almost instant diarrhea from the get-go! Had my dear Mom run to the health food store to get probiotics and Kefir_ and after taking these (take them 2 hours before/after taking the Z-pack pill)_ diarrhea stopped. Also_ the first day you have to take two of the pills_ and after that_ I felt like death warmed over. I also felt a scary sense of panic and tingling in my arms! These subsided within the hour as I relaxed and drank a lot of water. Tummy aches_ too_ but I learned quickly to eat a BIG breakfast and then take the Z-pack pill. That wasn't easy because of the 3rd side effect: loss of appetite! That got better as the days went on. Also_ a feeling of being ""out of it_"" and some depression. I prayed a lot while taking this: Lord_ use it to heal me!","I went to bed one night_ after a very stressful couple of days_ with a tickle at the back of my throat. Next morning_ I began coughing up green phlegm and felt fatigue and detached from reality. I also had yellow pus in one eye! My nurse practitioner prescribed the Z-pack. Soon after taking my first dose_ I could feel the ""battle"" going on in my bronchi and chest as the days went on_ and now_ on day 5 feel much improved. Thank GOD I didn't have the bad side effects consistently. It was rough_ but I'm thankful that the pills helped me. Don't forget to take the probiotics and force yourself to eat a good_ solid breakfast before you take the pill!

Took meds 5/10/13_ only took 3 pills and the side effects took over. Sharp and violent stomach pains. Only had a few hives at first_ went to the doc and he gave me Benadryl  500 mg... Didn't do shit_ just made me sleepy. 4 days after covered head to toe in hives. Went to emergency room_ hot a steroid shot ( not afraid of shots but 3 minutes after shot- your arm feels like its been hacked off) and a 21 pill pack of steroids to follow.

Vertigo_ dizziness_ tremors (couldn't even sign my name)_ nausea_ extreme pressure in my head_ headaches_ double vision_ constant tiredness_ fuzziness (just couldn't concentrate or think)_ noise sensitivity_ chest pressure_ and a general feeling of disconnection from everything around me. It was just a very odd set of symptoms that were unlike anything I'd ever experienced. They appeared about 36 hours into it_ and I couldn't go on_ so I stopped after day 3.,This drug has a long half life. At almost 3 days_ that means even two weeks after_ about 3% of of it is still floating around in your system. I'm about 5 weeks out now_ and it's pretty much cleared up. This might be the first day I've woken up without any trace of haze and headache_ though there's barely a hint of a tremor left. All the symptoms declined steadily throughout the period_ and it was around 18-20 days that I started to feel functional again_ though not quite normal. All this is to say that if you're like me_ it will feel bleak_ unending_ and awful for a little while. I was afraid some of the symptoms would be permanent. They felt like neurological problems.

Each day that I began to feel better I looked at the clock only to see it was time for the next pill. It has been about 2months and I have been having similar issues since taking it. Lack of focus_ dizziness randomly. I had one bad episode of vertigo where I ended up walking into my dresser instead of out more doorway. Went to the doctor they couldnt find anything in my ears or brain that would be causing this. I didnt feel this way before taking it. Had a similar bad experience with Antibiotics in the past and became allergic to bananas and lactose intolerant within a month of taking them. My whole life growing up I ate 2 bowls of cereal every morning and a banana every day. Now I cant eat either without either pooping my brains out or curling over in gut wrenching pain.

I was certain that my throat was closing up despite the ER nurse practitioner and Dr saying that there were no outward signs of swelling.  Was given a steroid shot in case_ but it didn't cure the feeling of my throat closing up.  I slept almost non-stop for 3 days.  I remember very little of those 3 days.  In addition to the very marked psychiatric side effects_ I had an odd taste in my mouth_ tingling of tongue_ cheeks_ and arms on occasion.  Headaches_ cheek rash_ inability to focus on anything.  The only thing I havent' had are the stomach problems.  I was supposed to take it for 5 days_ but quit after 3 on the suggestion of the dr.

It has been 5 days since my first dose and I am now feeling disoriented and having difficulty concentrating. I still feel very dizzy at times and feel like I amg going to pass out. I feel restless when I am trying to sleep. I also am having muscle weakness and loss of appetite. I can hardly function or do minimal tasks. I am wondering if anyone has had similar cognitive effects and how long they lasted. I had a similar experience with a quinilone antibiotic and my problems lasted over a year so I am very concerned about the potential long term effects of this antibiotic.

Shortly after taking the initial two doses on my first day_ I passed out twice and went into what appeared to be a seizure. Woke up with my face and head all busted up. I thought it might have been because of the whooping cough/tetanus booster shot Id gotten the same day when I went to my doctor.  I also thought it might have been because of the cough meds with hydrocodone. I discontinued the cough med and continued with the Zithromax_ and passed out two more nights in a row. My wife and son witnessed the last episode tonight and said I jumped up when I started coughing and then fell face first onto the floor and started twitching like a seizure  This was after taking Zithromax about 15-20 minutes before.

This is a slow release antibiotic_ and is known to destroy your intestines_ however dumb doctors refuse to believe all these negative reviews. You may get lucky and not have side effects_ but it's not worth a chance. I was given it twice_ and after the first round I got mystery allergies about 3 weeks after I quit taking it. My eye was swelling_ I had a rash on face_ and my right leg was dragging a bit_ but I didn't understand it until the second round when it all happened again as well as_ I thought my intestines were going to fall out_ and I spent a month in bed thinking I was a gonner. Like everyone else_ I had crazy insomnia_ anxiety_ and sense of impending doom_ and I cried for a month straight (I don't cry!)_ and my immune system collapsed. I couldn't stand mold after it and got all kinds of fungal infections_ and got respiratory issues. I ended up in ER several times_ and they left me for dead because they refuse to admit that you can have a fungal infection if you don't have AIDS. I ended up getting pins and needles all over my body and my brain felt like it was too big for my head. Took Diflucan for a month to try to restore the flora and fauna_ and it helped a bit. Now I am on sugar-free diet and it seems to help. It is all from fungal overgrowth in the intestines_ but the doctors won't help you. Help yourself and don't take this!

These class of antibiotics ""move"" the system_ but in most cases it is only temporary and nothing to worry about.  As far as the nightmares and lack of sleep or irritability from this drug_ I've had none.  You must make sure that the other drugs you are taking with this drug are not interacting.

Hope I'm not leaving any symptoms out.,I took the z-pack (can't remember the exact dosage now) for a suspected sinus infection back in November_ and I have lived to regret it ever since.

I am experiencing hearing loss due to this and I fear that my hearing will not return to normal_ which impedes my normal life. I also almost constantly have canker sores in my mouth_ but it is not as severe as it was back in November and December when the thrush was 'raging' and I couldn't eat and drink_ it's just 'annoying' and 'inconvenient'. The z-pack was like poison to me_ and it didn't even help the initial illness.  I will NEVER take this medication again. To me_ it's poison and I think it should be taken off the shelf.  I just can't believe I took an antibiotic in November and I'm still suffering the consequences. The loss of hearing is really scaring me.

327, 1, bronchitis,I was given this medication through an IV in the hospital_ where I had gone due to bronchitis which I had had for several days.  I went to the ER because it was a weekend.  After being misdiagnosed with asthma with the initial physician_ I again went to the hospital because the treatment from the initial visit did not help and made my bronchitis symptoms worse.  I was finally correctly diagnosed with bronchitis (not asthma_ although I do have allergic asthma) and admitted overnight for the Zithromax IV.  I felt much better when I left the hospital but .....,I was prescribed a 500 mg. dose to take for five days after I left the hospital.  Within one day_ I began to have panic attacks and the stomach bloating_ gas and constipation was horrible.  Thinking it was from the oral steroids that I had also been prescribed_ I went back to the ER complaining about severe anxiety and the fact that while my blood pressure was LOW_ my heart was pounding and I was having severe anxiety attacks (something I have never_ ever had before).  The ER put me on Xanax_ told me to stop taking the steroids_ and instructed me to continue taking the Zithromax even though at that point_ I had begun to suspect that the problems I was having was not solely due to the steroids.  I went to my primary care who promptly took me OFF the antibiotic_ and said that my symptoms would subside.  There was_ in her opinion_ no reason why I was given such a strong oral dose of this antibiotic after having had it via IV in the hospital (I weight only 104 pounds).  Well_ it's been six months later and I still feel lousy.  Not from the bronchitis_ but from the constipation_ gas_ bloating and the constant feeling of anxiety and panic.  I can't even touch something like coffee now; the end result is not good.  My Xanax is long gone and my GP wants to look for other causes of the problem; they refuse to believe that the Zithromax could have these long lasting effects on my health.

329, 1, Bronchitis,My five year old was prescribed this medication for bronchitis.  She had taken it in the past without incident.  However_ this time_ after taking two doses_ she wound up in the ER because she had fevers spiking over 103 that would not come down no matter what we did.  (Cold baths_ fever reducers_ etc.)  She was complaining that her mouth hurt_ her tummy hurt_ she had clay colored BM/diarrhea_ and she was miserable.  They actually thought she might need to have her appendix removed because she was in so much distress.  She was not on zitrhomax while in the hospital because they thought she would be having surgery.  She was on an IV drip and Motrin.  Her fever broke and she started feeling much better.  The doctor at the hospital told me very specifically to continue the zitrhomax when we got home.  So_ that evening_ I did.  Her fever shot back up again and she started crying that the medicine made her mouth hurt.  She also said her eye was bothering her and her legs.  I couldn't believe,People should realize that you can develop a sensitivity to a drug even if you've taken it in the past without incident.  This is a very powerful drug that has not helped her bronchitis - she is sicker today than she was when she started the medicine.  It seems that the medicine has taken away her body's natural ability to fight the infection.

That would explain all of your feelings including dread. This is a very strong antibiotic and yes there are side effects. you were prescribed this because of the severity of you illness.

Skin crawling feeling being ill or maybe poisoned?  which passed within 4 hours of each dose.  headache behind right eye and on top of head_ extreme nausea.,took for 4 days.  I took for bronchitis possible pneumonia. HEADACHE started 3 days in and I have been treating with motrin and chewing baby aspirin (x2) between doses.  I felt awful after each dose but I had been sick for A MONTH.  First dose I had ringing in the ears and it scared me.  I was afraid of a severe allergic reaction so I took benadryl and waited for the doctor to call me back which took a while and ringing diminished.  He said to wait and see if it occurred after the 2nd dose.  It did not so I continued taking the pills but stopped after 4days as I felt ill after each dose_ skin crawling icky feeling I can't describe.  The headache came the 3rd day but I thought it was from being sick_ took some ibuprofen and then noticed my right eye felt funny.  I couldn't concentrate very well so I just rode it out and kept chewing the baby aspirin between taking ibuprofen.  I can't sleep and I have this headache.   I can't find anything about WHAT causes it which would make it easier to deal with! I have takene this before with no problem and I SERIOUSLY believe it is because it is the generic.

341, 5, Pharyngitis,At first no side effects. About 3 or 4 days into the antibiotic I had intense watery diarrhea at least 2 or 3 times a day. Then it started to decrease and stop about the 5th or 6th day of taking it. A day of diarrhea after stopping it. Increased appetite and some minor itching occasionally. Minor agitation/depression that could be contributed to how i was feeling before taking the medication due to being sick. Other than that; not a real big deal with this medication for me.,This med worked quickly. After taking the initial dose of 500mg i woke up feeling 75% better. Gradually about 2nd or 3rd day I was feeling a lot better just as the doctor said I would. 2 days after stopping it im feeling good over all. Just a minor earache that the doctors cannot contribute to anything. Lastly; DO NOT let others horror stories scare you when taking THIS medication. I was almost not going to take it due to what I was reading but I figured I could wait it out and be miserable or just take it and see if I would feel better in a couple days like the doctor said. Well I did. Just be aware of wheezing or shortness of breath and STOP immediately and go to the Emergency Room. But give the medication a try. You dont know if its going to work or not until you try.

However_ since Israel is our ally_ I strongly doubt they are trying to engage in chemical or bio warfare with us through pharmaceuticals.The one who said that most people here who experience severe side effects seems to have underlying issues has a point. I know I do_ including anxiety disorder_ OCD and various forms of chronic illness. It doesn't mean that I or anyone else is a nutcase_ only that we may be more prone to certain adverse reactions.  Most post on these sites only when they experience a bad reaction. This can give the impression that such reactions are common_ when in reality the vast majority don't experience them.Unfortunately_ I did. I only pray that they don't get worse before they get better.,M,44,1  days250 1X D,6/16/2011Email,Zithromax
372, 1, Sinus Infection,Severe leg_ back and side pain/numbness.  Severe Anxiety.,This was an absolute horrible nightmare of a drug.  On day two I felt pain in my side.  Assummed it was from coughing.  On day five I woke up in the middle of the night with a feeling like something is wrong_ I am dying_ the world is ending.  I finally fell back to sleep after about four hours only to wake up with the same feeling.   I drove to work that morning and could barely operate my right leg to stop the vehicle.  Thought it was a siatic nerve problem.  Now almost three weeks later I am still feeling the effects.

373, 1, Bronchitis,"Took full dose (double dose first day_ then 1 dose for 4 days) of generic on 2/23/2011 (PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT AT AN URGENT CARE_ NOT MY DOC). Five to 7 days later was feeling extremely bloated and experiencing HORRIBLE negative_ anxiety feeling -- felt like I was dying_ thought I was dying! Digestive system was affected so radically that I went to my regular doctor a week later and he gave me something to clean out my lower G.I. because of extreme bloating and pain in stomach...nausea & headaches. Discussed the horrible ""unfounded"" feelings I had.  He didn't understand_ he never had an issue with this drug. I copied some of the pages of this website and gave them to him...NOW he knows. It's been almost 3 months since I took that drug and I am still suffering stomach/lower G.I. issues_ PLUS that ABSOLUTELY FRIGHTENING FEELING OF DYING keeps coming back every so often...can't make it go away. I took this same ""generic"" drug in March 2010","After checking my prescription box again_ I discovered that this Generic drug is made by TEVA_ a manufacturing company from Israel. They manufacture the drug in Israel_ then distribute it in the U.S. through their distribution center in Sellersville_ PA. My question is: WHY is the U.S. letting another country make a drug and distribute it in the U.S.? What is TEVA's quality control like...do they have a Q.C. lab?  Any drug that is distributed throughout the U.S. needs to be consistently monitored by U.S. regulations during the manufacturing process BEFORE letting that drug be distributed and possibly harm Americans. Who is monitoring TEVA? Someone somewhere wasn't watching and they produced a drug that was destructive and dangerous to the American people...like the individuals on this site. Ever think of ""Bio Warfare""...how perfect is this drug to tamper with American's health and create a psychosis to make people sick emotionally. The people on this website ARE NOT NUTS OR CRAZIES OR LOSING IT_ no matter what one other person suggested. What these people have/are feeling is VERY REAL and Scary! I know_ because I got to experience it ""up close and personal""...and I am still experiencing the affects almost 3 months later.

375, 2, sinus infection / ear ache,Everyone is different so I can not speak for everyone but I took half a pill because I have a sensitive stomach. It gave me bad nausea and stomach pains within a few hours of taking it. Made me feel like I had brain fog and felt restless. Now sinus infections and ear ache are no fun and very painful so I just wanted to feel well the medicine did work quickly. I really did not like feeling like I was going to throw up and I took the medicine on a very heavy stew so even with food it did not help. Day 2 I was going to take more but then the anxiety kicked in I felt like I could not talk to people and very scared and terrified.  Nervous like something was very wrong and I didnt want to do anything.  That was not a good feeling and I just wanted to be left alone. NOT NORMAL PEOPLE!! anyway this is just how I felt so I am just letting everyone know that yes you can feel these things they are real and it could be different for others. I will have to find another antibiotic.,Took the 3 day pack and did not have the other versions.Not sure if I would take this again I have heard others say that the different versions can affect you differently.

On the bottoms of my feet_ although a rash is not visible_ it feels like burning when I walk_ as if they have sores under my skin. I took the double-dose in the afternoon on the first day and developed these symptoms by that night_ during which I also had trouble sleeping (try as I might_ I couldn't seem to stop my mind from wandering).  Although the rash was bothering me_ I had gotten the medicine prescribed at an urgent care clinic and I don't have a primary care physician_ so I tried to reach the doctor who had prescribed it to me to ask what to do.  Since he wasn't available and I don't have a PCP_ I decided to just take the 2nd dose until I can get some advice.  The 3rd day_ a coworker convinced me to call again and ask for a different antibiotic_ which I did; I got amoxicillin which is fine_ but the rash isn't going away.

379, 4, Sinusitis,none. But it's fun reading about everyone else's wacky side effects. Anxiety?  Depression?  Consider some of the sources here. Most of the horrific side effects seem to be reported by people who have some other underlying (mental?) health issues.  I visited a similar site when I was prescribed Cipro two years ago.  Sure_ the drug made me sick and gave me diarrhea. It also probably saved my life. I had diverticulitis with perforations. My advice is to use any medication with caution and under the advice of a physician. And do not read too many posts like the ones you see here. Bear in mind that most people who post had a bad experience. If the drug had worked and given them ni trouble_ they probably wouldn't bother. The drug is very effective on bacterial respiratory infections. If your infection is viral (common cold) antibiotics will not work.,Effective for upper respiratory infections that are bacterial.

Although it didn't work i can safely say that i have no neg side-effects to report except a little nausea in the beginning but eating something with it counteracted that problem.

389, 1, bronchitis,PLEASE - I am exploring the side effects I had with the generic azithromycin which are very similar to the ones on this site with an attorney.  If you would like to know what I find out please email me.  I had so many of the side effects that others shared here which are completely different than the side effects as listed on the med. literature.  When I took this back in Aug 2010 my smyptoms did not start until 1 1/2 weeks after I finished so I never suspected that all the problems that developed for the first time in my life had anything to do with the med.  I went from Aug to Jan trying to find out what the hell was wrong with me - had over $12_000 worth of bills.  I never had anxiety before but this stuff turns you into someone else - you feel as if there is something life threatening going on.,In Feb. I still had gastritis_ ringing in my right ear and cracking in my neck but my other smyptoms seemed to wane some.  Then came down with a cold which turned in bronchitis which I haven't had since I was 15 - it seemed like my immune system was not what it was before.  Dr. prescribed azithromycin again -took it and by the second dose I finally had my answer - all this time it was this damn stuff.  Now all my symptoms are back with a vengence and I am hoping I can come back a second time.  Had take z-pak(brand name) at least 5 times in last 10 years - no problem - it is the GENERIC I believe - it has a different molecular structure_ different inert ingredients and is manufactured outside the US with no quality control like here in the US - also does not have to go through the same trails as brand - I just think there is something in the generic - its make up or a contaminate and I would like to warn others.

I've also had some very minor taste distortion_ and a little tinnitus.,Fifth-day side effects (mild) haven't put me off this drug. I do feel_ though_ that I would not want to take it for longer than these few days. nb I was prescribed a full tablet the first day_ then half tablets for the subsequent four days. Again_ I think the full dose every day would be more confronting. Still a 5 - very happy with the drug_ at a moderate dose.

I have had the worst anxiety of my life_ and my moods are all over the board. I have had trouble sleeping_ racing thoughts_ surging of energy(even laying down)_ irritability_ diarrhea_ and have felt extremely scared for no reason. I haven't been me for a week and I am so over it. Tonight I was at dinner with my fiance and our waitress asked why I wasn't eating my meal and I told her I hadn't had an appetite since I stopped taking my antibiotics. She asked me if I had taken a Z-pack and I said yes and she said the same thing had happened to her. WTF! This makes me feel so much better knowing its the drug that is making me feel like this. But damn an antibiotic which is supposed to be helping you should not make you feel this way.

However_ a day or two after taking the last of the pills_ severe anxiety set in along with depression and strange dreams. This has continued for over a week and i believe is now fading away.

415, 3, sinus infection,I have taken the Z-pack many times but this time it affected my stomach and gave me diarrhea and cramps.  I too have felt an odd sense of anxiety and a blueness that is not normal.  I wrestled terribly last night over my emotional sensitivity and anxiety.  This is very new to me to get these side effects.  I wonder if they have changed something in the drug when I read all those who have taken it before and are suddenly now experiencing different and painful side effects.  I must confess my faith in the pharmaceutical companies is waning rapidly as the years go by.,What I am doing to help w/my stomach upset is taking probiotics and acidophilus.  It also helps build the immune system.  Antibiotics remove all the good flora from the stomach and colon and these effects are not as surprising as a result.  If you haven't done so_ I suggest going to a good co-op or health food store and getting a good probiotic with acidophilus and taking those.  It should begin to help the stomach pain and effects that the antibiotic has caused.,F,58,5  days250 mg 1X D,1/31/2011,Zithromax

Well here I am a few days after I finished my medication_ and I feel my throat infection coming back AGAIN. Zithromax is worthless. It cured my throat infection for a few days_ only to have it come right back once I got off the medication. I think the reason they give you 'stronger dose for a shorter amount of time' is because they know if you take antibiotics for only a few days_ it will come back & result in another visit from you.,F,23,5  days 1X D,1/28/2011,Zithromax

424, 1, sinus infection,Woke up with severe anxiety_ nervousness all day long_ edgy_ dark thoughts_ feeling of doom_ depression_ stomach aches all day_ sleeplessness_ burning in muscle.,I took this drug as a first dose 10 days ago. I started to notice right away my anxiety was heightened but i didnt think it was the pills. So i cont to take and as i cont to take it things went from bad to worse. I began to feel crazy and lose my mind_ I wanted to hurt myself and was afraid i was going to hurt other people. I have never been a violent person and never took drugs or anything_ and I didnt have a desire to hurt people i was just afraid i was going to. I had to have my mom stay with me because i was so scared of being alone. I finally stopped the medicine after the 4th dose. I didnt sleep for 3 days until finally i slept but still felt out of it. Now its beginning of day 6 and Im still having severe problems. I have anxiety_ panicky and nervouness all day. I cant focus at work_ i dont want to do anything. I feel worthless. Everyone is telling me its not the drug and i need help_ but I feel like none of this started until i took the drug. They said it should be out of my system by now_ but I dont feel any better_ please im desperate at this point for some information_ anyone experience these side effects and how long did it last.

426, 2, lingering upper respiratory,Horrendous watery diarrhea. Painful stomach cramps. Gassy feeling all.the.time. Horrible belching. Ate small amounts & yet felt super full & like I'd vomit.Wondering also if this drug was why I had other upper body pains (back_ etc) that came out of nowhere.,I took this after being sick for weeks & taking care of two sick toddlers (one with a double ear infection_ one with pneumonia). I got the z pack (which I now see is the freaking generic) and took the first two on a Sunday night. Felt ok_ slept fine. Monday I noticed I had some stomach distress that morning but attributed it to a very fiber full dinner the night before and my morning coffee. But it happened a few times more that afternoon/evening. Took the fourth pill on Tuesday morning - and that day had horribnle gurgling in my stomach - as well as just overall cramps_ and of course_ the water diarrhea. I just chalked it up to be as expected because I am on antibiotics_ until my mother told me I should call my doctor. Then I found all the warnings_ and saw how sick some people were. I called & am waiting to hear back from my doctor. There is no way in hell I will take the remaining two pills_ I'd rather take my chances. I have a bad stomach to begin with and cannot afford anymore problems.,F,37,3  days250mg 1X D,1/19/2011,Zithromax
427, 2, bronchitis,severe stomach pain_ vomiting_ diarrhea_ metal taste in mouth,i am currently on my second round of zithromax in the last four weeks. I started with the 250mg 5 day course_ which helped and the only side effect was a metal taste in my mouth. Then a week later_ the bronchitis came back with a vengeance (and yes_ I finished my first course completely)_ so the doc gave me the 3 day course in 500 mg. Day one_ everything was fine. Day two_ within about 3 hours of taking_ i began having the worst stomach cramps ever.. my stomach making all sorts of not ladylike noises. That was immediately followed by very severe vomiting and diarrhea which i am still suffering from. It's totally awful. My bronchitis symptoms are now pretty much gone_ so I am seriously considering not taking the last pill. The cure is almost worse than the ailment! So_ I think this version of the antibiotic is really messing with my system_ but the lower dosage version seemed okay. Take at your own risk_ I guess?,F,36,3  days500 mg 1X D,1/14/2011Email,Zithromax

I went to sleep like around 12am and the room was dark so I started seeing faces with my eyes closed_ I open them I can still see faces ( evil faces and normal faces coming at me). I left it alone and decide to try it out the next day to see what happen. the following day I took one pill at 930pm and went to bed around 1am_ I started seeing faces again so maybe I thought I could control it because I believe I'm able to control my mind body and heart so I said with my eyes opens in the dark_ I want to see a woman dancing_ A white shadow with no face just a hood on appear in front of me and put his finger in my face and said no shaking it to the side_ thats when I said (oh he.ll no)_ I got up and slept with the light on. I seen some weird crazy stuff on this pills_ I haven't drink alcohol in the past 3 weeks and I don't take any illegal drugs so this med is crucial.,I read some comments saying they were having pain swallowing while taking the medication_ well I was inform by ER that this is only for infection_ make sense if the infection goes away the pain as well but why put yourself for additional 5 days of pain when the hospital should of inform you that theres a one time shot or pills if you don't like shots that they can give you right there for the pain_ But with all that pain just take the shot is faster_ by the time I got in my car from the ER I felt no pain at all_ now all I'm dealing with is this azithromycin tables 250mg and there little devils free of charge which I will gladly take them back to the stored right now.

Am not going to take last pill--terrible redness in back of throat is gone_ as far as possible URI--my breathing is physically ok besides some almost delusional panicky type thoughts which I know especially by reading the comments are part of the side effects.  I actually just prayed for like 30 minutes straight to the Lord to deliver me from the panicky thoughts_ etc_ and that helped alot--from prayer I just got back a feeling of just have to wait out the side effects now and trust in Him; the sickness is gone.,I think what Zithromax could be compared to is like Chemotherapy--it just starts killing everything that's infectious bacteria but also some needed good bacteria_ gets in your blood and to your brain and thoughts are altered somewhat.  But the power of your intellect and deliberate concentrating thought alone can over power these side effects It's a very strong anti-biotic which should be downplayed overall across the board.  My guess is to maybe to rid of the side effects_ hydrate_ but don't overhydrate_ and flush system with water to dilute and expel zithromax from system.,M,33,6  days500mg 1X D,12/30/2010,Zithromax

I normally take it on an empty stomach_ get the squits in a few hours_ feel a bit ropy for a couple of days but its bearable. This time I took it on an empty stomach and went to bed. I think the fact I didn't get the squits means more of it stayed in my body_ hence feeling rough for days after. Enjoy!,M,38,1  days1g 1X D,12/10/2010Email,Zithromax

Heart palpitations when I tried to sleep.  I became increasingly exhausted each day.,I could not take the last dose.  I felt so bad and my stomach is killing me.

Very tired and just plane uninterested in anything_ really dry skin.,This med cleared up the bronchitis no doubt.  So I gave it a 4 rating because that's why I was taking it.  However_ I have spent so much time in the bathroom this weekend I though about installing a TV and a small fridge.  I finished my last dose 2 days ago and I am just wiped out feeling.  Totally exhausted and not really intersted in doing much more than lay around.  It's my assumption that all of this will pass soon enough_ so I'm not really to worried about it because it did clear up the lungs.  Will I take it again in the future? Yes_ because it worked for what I needed it for.  But I will be stocking up on magazines and crossword puzzles for the bathroom next time.,M,40,5  days250mg 1X D,11/15/2010,Zithromax

I am allergic to almost everything else_ I keep thinking I need to go to the bathroom. Considering going to the store now and getting a ton of yogurt after reading all the comments. Wonder if it might be the Mucinex I was given. I am so not enjoying these cramps_ and I really think I should call the doc but on one is available on Friday night other than the ER. Great! Trade one problem for another.,I found it odd that they went from like 7 pills to 3..could that be what is making the reaction so bad_ since it apparently a much larger dose?,F,42,3  days500 mg 1X D,6/12/2010Email,Zithromax
501, 1, flu,i have had anxiety issues in the past but have been stable for years.  i never expected that an antibiotic would throw me into a week and a half long anxiety bout.  it was awful and it took me a while to figure out that it might be the medicine rather than me losing it.  then i did some researching on the internet and saw that others had experienced the same.  if you're reading this and experiencing the same thing it should alleviate some days after your last dose.  however anxiety is self perpetuating so keep in mind that you may want to look into what you can do to control it with behavioral methods or a prescription if it's debilitating.,,F,33,5  days250 1X D,6/10/2010,Zithromax

This may be an outdated drug that no longer works for infections that may get more common. For me_ this prescription mostly provided a week of ineffective treatment.

508, 4, Bronchitis,None so far,Its been over 24 hours since the first dose and I was expecting to have horrible side effects as described by other users but I have not even had any stomach discomfort. I did have a horrible anxiety attack after taking it last night but I suspect it was generated by my fears of taking this medication. One thing I don't like about this medication is the length that it stays in your system_ and the relatively long half life. I'm not on a high doseage but someone taking 500mg each day might have horrible side effects due to the addition of more medication.,F,20,3  days200 1X D,5/22/2010,Zithromax

510, 4, Low grade fever/sinus infection,Diarrhea_ Abdominal pain_ loss of appetite_ brain fog,I had a low grade fever. It worked immediately_ after the first dose_ I was already better the next day. However_ this medicine gave me diarrhea_ not bad_ but still annoying. I had a major loss of appetite; I had to force myself to eat meals_ because I am not hungry what so ever. I lost about 5 pounds this week. And about 2 hours after taking the medicine_ I would get horrible_ terrible abdominal pain for about an hour_ but then it would go away. I would say this medicine certainly does a number on your stomach_ so take alot of food with it. Otherwise_ it did get rid of my fever.,F,19,5  days250 1X D,5/17/2010,Zithromax
511, 4, Bronchial Infection,anxiousness_ vomiting_ diarrhea_ loss of appetite,Had a sore throat for two weeks and a cough that followed_ for about a month. Didn't have insurance_ so I dragged my feet when it came to seeing a doctor. The cough got worse so I saw one_ and he prescibed me a z pak. On the first two days_ I experienced mild diarrhea and anxiousness. Reading the reviews on this site and others probably added to the anxiousness. The first night's sleep was very vivid and weird. I think that's because I took two pills that day. By day 3_ I started feeling much better_ and started coughing up all the mucus that was making me cough. I vomited in the morning a few times_ but it wasn't substantial and mostly had to do with my coughing.I highly recommend taking a pro biotic 2 hours after taking a z pak pill_ because the antibiotic gets rid of the good bacteria you need to digest things properly. It could help prevent stomach pains and diarrhea. Also_ eat yogurt regularly. Especially AFTER you're done with the z pak cycle_ to help get your digestive system back to normal. At least for the first week after your cycle.I also highly suggest chamomile tea for the anxiety_ it helped me. Good luck to those taking the medicine_ it was definitely frustrating to get used to but I felt much better after.,M,23,5  days250 mg 1X D,5/17/2010,Zithromax

Sure I had some bad stomach pains for a few hours but they were absolutely NOTHING compared to the effects from the other medication. Also_ the inner ear infection that was causing dizziness/ severe headaches for 3 weeks is now gone! WOOHOO! (the doctor at my University is a moron and couldn't figure out what was wrong with me and just put me on some random medicine she hoped would work so I got stuck with the ear infection for weeks + the worst pain of my life from the other medicine).

After I discontinued the drug after 4 doses (should have taken it for 5 days)_I also began to have heart palpitations a few days after the last dose_ or in other words feeling like my heart is skipping beats.,I wish I would have done much more research on this drug.  I will never take this again.  I took my last dose about 2 weeks ago and have been struggling with heart palpitations ever since.  I have mitral valve prolapse_ and this drug seems to have set off extreme heart palpitations.  My doctor assured me this would be safe.  To all people with Mitral Valve Prolapse_ avoid this drug.  Do not take it.  I hope these palpitations stop soon.  They are usually short lived for me_ but after this drug they have lasted much longer and been much more extreme.,F,47,4  days250 MG 1X D,5/5/2010Email,Zithromax

515, 1, strep infection,My 6 year old daughter has had a TERRIBLE reaction to her Z-pack.  She has been vomiting for 5 days straight.,The strep cleared up immediately_ but 1 day after the last dose_ she woke up vomiting_ and hasn't stopped yet.  It has been 5 days.  Her dr. said it stays in your system for 5 days after the 5 day dose_ and we are finally on day 10!  I really hope she feels better tomorrow_ because she has missed school all week.  If she doesn't stop by tomorrow we have to take her to the ER for an IV.  She has had some diarrhea_ but mostly severe stomach pain_ vomiting_ extreme fatigue and anger (don't blame her).  I'm trying to give her probiotics_ but she can't keep them down!  After it's out of her system_ I will give big doses of probiotics to get her system back to normal.  Next time I will ask for a milder antibiotic if possible--this one is too strong for a strep infection that could be knocked out by milder ones.  All antibiotics cause negative side effects though.  Never take them unless you have to!,F,6,5  days 1X D,4/21/2010,Zithromax
516, 1, Abcess Tooth,If you are reading this_ you are probably taking this stuff or want to know what to expect. I did the same thing but now believe I should have been more concerned about the aftermath of taking this drug and try to prevent it! I now have a C-difficile infection of the bowel because I took this antibiotic. You do not want this infection! Knowing what I know now_ I would have made absolutely sure that I was taking probiotics with it. I would have tried to start taking the probiotics before taking Zithromax. The 2 I am using now to help rid myself of this infection are FloraStor and Accuflora (they both have different contents and effect and you can get them at drug store over the counter - and both I believe have clinical work showing effectiveness). It can be used before and during your course of Zithromax for protection from this bug.You can get this infection if you already have some C-Diff in the bowel (you could pick it up in hospitals_ nursing homes_ assisted living_ even hotels,The symptoms of my infection started about 7-8 days after I completed by course Zithromax although some people get their infections months after so be aware of what your body is doing. My advice is over the year following taking this stuff_ if you feel like you are getting the stomach flu and have diarrhea (i did not vomit)_ do not wait to see if it runs it course. Go directly to the doctor and get a stool sample done to check for C Diff. Demand the test so you can start therapy. I should have done that immediately and should have taken the probiotics BEFORE and DURING the course of this drug. I want to pass this along in hopes that you guys can avoid my fate!!!!!,M,52,6  days250mg 1X D,4/21/2010Email,Zithromax

539, 1, viral infection,Approximately 10 years ago_ my doctor prescribed zithromax for a viral infection. Until zithromax_ I had never had an allergic reaction to any drug or antibiotic. Almost immediately after taking zithromax_ I had the worst diarrea I had ever experienced. The closest analogy I can think of is to imagine eating 500 of the hottest chili peppers on the planet in one setting. I was very concerned that I might die and I have a high tolerance to pain. My doctor sent me to a hospital in Houston for a blood test and one of the negative results indicated that 20 percent of my white blood cells had been destroyed by the zithromax. It took six months for my white blood cell count to return to normal. I can't even recall if my viral infection cleared up as a result of the zithromax_ because I was in such horrible agony after taking the zithromax that I forgot about my viral infection. I would not take zithromax again even if I were offered a million dollars and I can assure you that this is no exagg,When I took zithromax I was about 57 years old and in excellent condition.

The pain lasts for three hours. When I am able to go back to sleep_ I have disturbed dreams: I'm late to an appointment ... I can't find my child ... I loose control of my car ... etc. After the second day_ my ears began to ring. I feel like my head is full of static and it's slowly starting to drive me insane! I don't feel an improvement to my ears.

I couldn't sleep last night either and loss of appetite. I've never taken oral antibiotics before and I've never had a sinus infection before so this is really horrible.

Then a family member who is a nurse reminded me I had taken the Zithro and that it can take a while to get the digestive track back in order_ even months. The lower back pain was really the concern when combined with all the gastro symptoms_ then I saw some others mentioned that and I am relieved that I may not be dying after all!

Be mindful of anxiety if you are taking this medication and_ if you feel anxious or panic-stricken_ remind yourself that it is the drug and not anything else.  I would not recommend the generic version of this drug.,M,39,4  days,2/3/2010,Zithromax

556, 4, Chronic Sinusitis,Abdominal Pain_ weird dream_ headache,This was actually really helpful.  The first day was the only bad day I had and it was because it was double the dose and I did not eat much with the pills.

557, 5, Bacterial lung infection_ bronchiti,Minimal. Urine did look darker yellow_ so I drank lots of water. Took a probiotic pill_ though I always do when on antibiotics;  that or active-culture yogurt just makes sense_ as the balance of beneficial gut bacterial die off_ and less helpful organisms are left. Some gas. Big whoop. Part of the die-off. The fever and impacted sinus/hurting lungs/major snottage were far worse.,I'm no fan of antibiotics because they uproot your all-important gut flora. I tried to talk my doc out of it_ but when he showed me the chest x-ray_ I conceded. I needed help.It was a non-event. Day Three_ I felt a shift. Yesterday was the first day I felt like doing anything. Today (Day Five)_ I went for a walk_ and cleaned the house. And can breathe_ I might add.Use your best judgment_ but remember_ the folks with a good experience aren't searching the internet for side effects. I did_ because I was curious about the striking yellow color of the urine. Someone else on here said it was because the pill contained many salts. Don't know if it';s true_ but my experince was positive.,F,55,5  days,1/25/2010Email,Zithromax

Very weird feeling....had some heartburn and the most disgusting gas in the world. My husband was mortified. So gross.Hearing issues in both ears and feelings like my heart was skipping a beat or fluttering....very weird and uncomfortable feeling. I'm looking forward to getting my hearing back.

Also had diarrhea the first 2 days and gas.",I knew there was a reason I was hesitant to accept this prescription. I plan to stick it out for 2 more days but cannot wait to be done with it. I'll take the 10 day amoxicillan any day over this.

563, 3, UTI,Severe Gas_ Nausea_ some Diarrhea_...Did i mention Severe_ Uncomfortable Gas,I am a student in pharmacy school so of course when i recieved the generic form of zithromax i read all the information about the drug before taking it (ie. directions_ side effects_ etc.) On day 1_ I took both pills at 4 pm with food and by 8 pm that night I was extremely sick. I took some Emetrol to sooth my stomach and finally was able to sleep. By Day 2_ I learned that taking my daily dose at night before bed cut down on the nausea and i could actually sleep through the night. I did_ however_ develop severe gas that has been with me for the past couple of days. Of course_ the gas and stomach pain is much more manageable than the UTI_ but it is a very unpleasant side effect. I have one last dose to take and I will definitely take that last dose of the drug. TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE WRONGLY ADVISING OTHER USERS TO STOP TAKING THEIR ANTIBIOTICS PLEASE STOP!!!! BACTERIA ARE NASTY LITTLE THINGS THAT CAN BECOME RESISTENT IF YOU STOP TAKING YOUR ANTIBIOTICS AHEAD OF TIME. THIS MEANS THAT THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE PRESCRIBED ANTIBIOTICS THE BACTERIA IN YOUR BODY WILL NOT DIE_ ie YOU WILL STAY SICK. Please speak to your doctor or a pharmacist before cutting your dose short.,F,32,4  days,1/18/2010,Zithromax

I did not take last dose. I have been off it now for 6 days and tongue is still burning and is white. Doc thinks its thrush. Still have no appetite_ I have to make myself eat and stomach is all over the place. Doc now has me on nystatin and I'm taking a acidophilus pill. No help yet. It scares me that I still have no appetite. I have lost 5 pounds in a week.,F,44,4  days,1/17/2010,Zithromax
567, 5, ear_ sinus_ bronchial infections,Ringing in ears,This antibiotic has always helped me....whether I had bronchitis_ ear infections (which I have had chronically since childhood)_ strep throat or a sinus infection.  Every time I got sick_ I always waited at least two weeks before visiting the doctor so that if it was a bacterial infection_ it would be bad enough so as to prescribe a strong antibiotic.  Well_ amoxicillin NEVER_ EVER helped me.  No other antibiotic has worked for me except for zithromax.  I get irritated when people on this forum try to turn people away so violently from this antibiotic...it HAS helped a lot of people_ and just because it did not work for you specifically_ does not mean it can't help others!!  Common sense would tell anyone to take a couple of doses and see how you personally react to this antibiotic.  I think people forget the fact that this antibiotic is basically a fungus_  and if you eat fungus of course it may cause a little stomach upset and ringing in the ears_  but I personally am willing to let this strain of bacteria overtake and destroy the bacteria that causes my terrible sinus_ ear_ and bronchial infections (sometimes all at once!!).  I would much rather defeat the zithromax fungus AFTER it has destroyed the more painful and hurtful infections.,M,20,5  days,1/14/2010,Zithromax
568, 1, Bronchitis,Anxiety_ Muscle Pains_ Generally felt bad.,I was prescribed this because I was sick with brochitis the week of my wedding.  I have had this before BUT NEVER THE GENERIC.  There is something that they put in the generic that is almost like poison.  After 4 hours of taking the 500mg dose I woke up in a panic.  The next few days were a mixture of anxiety_ foggy thoughts_ and flu like symtoms (aches and pains).  My doctor (who is not the one who prescribed it) said that it had tons of salts in it_ and I was possibly having a reaction to that.  Also_ azithromyocin has a half life of 68 hours so each dose you take takes atleast 68 hours to get out of your system.  Luckilly I only took one does  and 68 hours later I am finally starting to feel better!!  This has to be the generic!!,M,31,1  times,1/13/2010,Zithromax
569, 2, Sore Throat /Sinus Infection,Upset stomach_ diarrhea_ severe nausea_ headache and disorientation.,I took the first two pills (with a meal) and within one hour I started to feel sick. The following day- I took it at lunch and I had the same symptoms. Years ago I took a Z-pack and remember that I felt very nauseous. I will no longer be taking this medication in the future. It's too hard to function at work when feeling this way.,F,27,2  days,1/12/2010,Zithromax
570, 2, ,light-headed_ loss of hearing in right ear_ hollow stomach_ paranoia_ diarrhea and disconnection from reality.,I had a SEVERE sinus infection and was given the generic form of Zithromax_ Azithromycin.  I took one tablet yesterday evening and went about my normal evening routine with no noticeable side effects.  I made a light breakfast this morning and took the 2nd of the 3 tablets.  About an hour later I became oddly disoriented. Imagine if you normally go through life in the front row of your own movie and now you're closer towards the back.  I felt very disconnected and paranoid like something bad was going to happen.  As if that wasn't fun enough_ I basically went deaf in my right ear and started hearing weird things and then the diarrhea kicked in.  I've been on Z-Packs before_ but I'm CERTAIN I've never experienced this sort of hellish reaction.  Obviously the makers of the generic form need to go back to the drawing board.  I'm just NOW starting to feel normal again after 9 hours.  I am_ however_ glad to report that my sinus infection had basically completely went away by early afternoon.  Obviously this stuff cures sinus infections_ but I would have MUCH rather have ridden out THAT storm as opposed to enduring the side effects I experienced with this drug.  YIKES.,M,27,2  days,1/9/2010Email,Zithromax
571, 5, Sinus Infection,None,Zithromax is a LIFE SAVER for me every time I get a sinus infection (every few months). A few months ago I was prescribed amoxicillin and had awful stomach complications and problems for weeks after taking the medication. Zithromax has never given me any issues_ I am currently on the generic and it seems to be exactly the same for me_ clearing up my sinus infection very well (am on day four currently).

I got depressed each daying knowing I was going to experience the bad symptoms after takeing a pill. Note: I did take strong probiotics while on the medication.  Two days after my last dosage I noticed I was breaking out on my neck_ upper chest and upper arms. It looked like hives/heat rash/small red pimples with a tiny white head. It has been 4 weeks now and I am still breaking out. They aren't as big but are not going away. When will they go away? I am now doing a body cleanse for 14 days.

The 1st day when I took two at once I felt ok but when I woke up the next morning I felt like my entire world had came crashing down upon me. It seemed like my symptoms had doubled. Constantly dizzy & I had no urge to eat because of my stomach complications. I had weird thoughts like a ghost was trying to get me or something. I told the doctors that my skin was itching & they said that ""it was just a minor reaction from the medecine but you will be ok as long as you dont have a rash"" That same exact day I broke out with a rash all over my stomach back & arm!! 5 days later I feel better but my stomach has not yet recovered & I still feel like I am a different person almost.",M,22, ,1/4/2010Email,Zithromax

For the most part I have never experienced any side effects from Zithromax although the second time I took this medication I did develop a mild stomach ache. If you are truly ill with a bacterial infection a stomach ache should be the last of your concern. I highly recommend this antibiotic.,F,25,5  times,1/3/2010,Zithromax
578, 1, strep throat,Few hours after first dose of this med (generic version_ Azithromycin_ 5-day course) I experienced huge anxiety_ painful heart palpitations_ inability to sleep_ horrible burning indegestion/acid reflux -- all of which lasted for WEEKS and some for MONTHS_ even though I never took a second dose (they switched me to Amoxycillin).,I ended up with paramedics at my home at midnight checking my heart after just that one first dose_ then at doctor several other times over the next week and beyond_ checking my heart because of constant painful heart palpitations_ miserable existence for weeks after_ had to wear a heart monitor for 48 hours_ and thinking I was dying from a heart condition. The anxiety was horrible_ sleepless nights with continual jumping up out of bed_ pounding painful heart_ horrible heartburn. FINALLY subsided after more than a month_ I began to feel like a normal human being again. THANK GOD I ONLY TOOK ONE DOSE. Do not take Azithromycin. All the docs said these symptoms were not likely from the medication (WRONG!)_ but they changed me to something else anyway since I insisted. They obviously have a deal with the pharmaceutical companies or have not looked at this site and don't acknowledge how horrible this stuff is for people to take. I will NEVER take this medicine again.,F,48,1  times,1/3/2010,Zithromax

I just had a feeling it was related to the drug.  I then had severe abdominal cramping_ watery diarrhea and vomiting 4 days after stopping with a fever.  I have constant nausea_ even water tastes bad.  I have been very out of sorts_ where I don't feel like myself and have been very depressed and weepy.  I have been sleeping a lot.  Today the back of my neck has been very stiff.  I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me but have never felt like this before so I decided to look up the side effects and came across this site and others with so many people experiencing the same types of problems.  Why don't they warn you of all these side effects on the pamplet before you take it.  I have taken Zpack before and had no problems.  I'm afraid to drive because of the dizziness which will cause a problem since I have 4 kids to get to school in a few days.  I'm hoping it wil,,F,43,4  days,1/2/2010,Zithromax
581, 2, Upper Resp. Infection,stomach cramps_ gas_ bloating_  heart racing_ itchy and rash_ panic attacks_ nausea,This drug cleared up my URI but not without a price.  I was prescribed the 5 day z-pack.  Before I took the z-pack I checked online for patient reviews of the med and was not very impressed with all the negative comments but I was coughing really bad_ had a growing fever_ congested and post nasal drip was making me miserable. The PND was falling in the back of my throat in globs.  Just to be on the safeside_ I did not take the two pill dose day 1; instead I broke one pill in half and took it.  Within thirty minutes or less I felt the med working_ so I took the other half about  four to five hours later.  Dose 1 (Huge panic attack_ slight heart racing)_ D2 (stomach cramps_ gas_ bloating)_ D3 I ate yogurt and it seemed to help the stomach cramping alittle ( gas_ slight nausea)_ and D4 (stomach cramps_ gas_ bloating_ serious heart racing and I kept jumping up out of my sleep.) I had two more days to take the meds but stopped.  It was just plain awful and I was scared the entire time I was taking the medicine. I could go on and on about this med but to cut this short..... It really_ truly works but not without a price. My URI cleared up in the 4 days I took the meds_ I felt much better but I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION!   One more thing....it has been nearly two weeks since I stopped taking the meds and I have begin to breakout in a daily itchy rash that is driving me crazy!,F,44,4  days,12/28/2009Email,Zithromax

The night after taking the first dose_ I was woken several times (strangely enough_ almost exactly three hours between each occasion) by severe stomache pain. Eating helped for the next few hours. I called my doctor the next morning and he advised me to stop taking it. More than 24 hours later_ I am still experiencing this pain. It's keeping me awake.Strange_ considering I took the same medication for strep this past summer_ with no side effects albeit a rather odeous stench whenever I urinated_ and to great avail as far as curing my symptoms of strep.On the plus side_ it relieved my even-more-unpleasant Bronchitis symptoms_ within hours.,No prior experience with upset stomache after taking medication. No regular issues with upset stomach/ indigestion/any of the other symptoms that pepto bismol claims to remedy.Very unpleasant. Difficult to focus at work today.

Although it helps every single time. YOU yourself_ need to decide if your going to take it or not. do you really think a lot of people will come here and say it worked great? of course not! this place is really gonna scare people out of taking medicine they need.

Two years ago I took the generic and had horrible stomach pains for 24 hours and did not finish the dose.  I  got a really bad sinus/ bronchitis infection and was perscribed the zpac again recently.  I had reservations about it but I did some research and found that generic drugs have different effects on the body.  Generic drugs may have the same active ingredients_ but are not time released or absorbed in the blood stream the same way as the name brand.  There are also different buffer ingredients and they are not tested the same.  There is an artcle on people's pharmacy.com that you should read_ they also have over 1200 stories of patients that have had horror stories about generic drugs.  I have a very sensitive stomach with IBS and I didn't have any problems with the name brand of this drug.  Just take it with a meal.,F,31,5  days,12/17/2009,Zithromax

I have had wierd brain fog and a medium headache constantly that I have been dealing with. I am taking a probiotic with this so may have helped with stomach issues since I have had none yet but this is only my third day on a five day pack. It has helped my infection but I am just feeling the effects today on the third day. I have heard this stays in your system and works up to two weeks after your finished with the pills.

I felt like I had every side effect possible.  It left me on the couch for days.  The dizziness/near fainting didn't hit right away_ about three days later.  I almost fainted while driving!  I'm on Day 9 of it being in my system and still feel jittery with anxiety and still a little weak.  I have NEVER had muscle weakness like this.  I couldn't even hold the phone or a pen.  I could feel the muscle weakness around my eyes_ making my vision really off.  I have lost 12 pounds since on this medication.  It should be bottled for weight loss!  I think I have been on Zithromax before_ and this time it was the generic.  I don't remember feeling like this last time.

I had an extremely uncomfortable episode yesterday after exerting myself slightly after a week in bed.  I got a gripping head pain across the back_ a wave of strong nausea and anxiety.  It passed after about an hour_ but I'm still nauseous_ and slightly dizzy.  Also have an unpleasant odd taste in mouth reminiscent of cooked onions that won't go away.  And I haven't eaten any onions.  Gross.  Diarrhea pretty bad - stomach ravaged.  I am taking high-end probiotics too.  On the plus side_ I will say that my violent cough is slowly improving and my week long fever went away after the first dose.,F,49,4  days,12/7/2009,Zithromax

My muscles feel as if I had an extreme work out and I feel weak overall. The symptoms started the second day with complete loss of sense of taste and smell (which I attributed to the sinus infection at first_ but it was so extreme_ I'm wondering if it wasn't the generic Z-pack. After the fifth day of taking it_ I developed weird heart racing and fluttering which comes and goes. That's also when these weakness spells developed.It's now the 10th day after taking it_ and I'm still feeling crappy (weak_ heart racing and / or weird sensations in the heart). It's pretty scary and at first I thought I was having a heart attack. This medication should be much better screened. I think it shouldn't be given out willy nilly. In the recent months I've heard of 4 co-workers and my husband taking the same medication for bronchitis_ lung infections_ sinus infections. Has this become the newest fad?I recommend extreme caution with taking this medication.,F,43,5  days,12/6/2009,Zithromax

Could be illness related_ but calling doc tomorrow regardless - I rarely have ear issues.,*Fingers Crossed*..if this ear issue is just related to the initial illness_ then I'm not horrified by the medication. It was relatively gentle on the stomach. After reading the following posts_ I'm kind of afraid of what might still be in store - otherwise_ not the best_ but definitely not the worst.,F,31,4  days,12/2/2009,Zithromax
594, 3, Bronchitis_ Whooping Cough,stomach ache_ bad migraines,Currently on last day of taking meds. I have had some stomach pain a few hours after taking Zithromax which may be lessened if taken with food. Major headaches about 8 hours after taking which I attribute to the Zithromax. I am also taking Claritin-D_ but that should not be giving me the migraines. My bronchitis seems to be less severe_ but still have coughing attacks several times a day. This is the first time I have taken Zithromax and do not really see a big difference in it opposed to Amoxicillin or Penicillin except for the price.,F,31,6  days,12/1/2009,Zithromax

597, 4, sinus infection,none,Took the brand NOT generic and also took probiotic Culturelle and ate yogurt while taking it.  Two years ago I took a generic form of a different antibiotic and had similar side effects that have been posted here_  lack of appetite_ diarreah_weight loss_ severe anxiety_  fatiguefelt like I was poisoned.  It took 18 months to feel better.  I had never had a reaction to any med before.  I strongly believe it was from a generic drug.  My suggestions never take a generic drug and always take probiotics with antibiotics.,F,56,5  days,11/28/2009,Zithromax
598, 5, Pneumonia from H1N1,Diarrhea,I love Zithromax. It took the full five days to really notice a difference. It's been 3 days since I took my last pill and I continue to get better and better each day. I had a little diarrhea_ but that was all.,F,24,5  days,11/27/2009Email,Zithromax

600, 1, Strep throat and sinus infection,Anxiety_ heart palpitations_ insomnia_ upset stomach,I have taken this before and have had anxiety but I started getting heart palpitations the first day after my last dose.  It has been three days now and still have them.  They don't happen all of the time but when they hit it is scary.  Called the emergency room and they didn't think it had anything to do with the antibiotic.  Should I be concerned?  I have had heart palps in the past but not for several months now.  I will not be taking this medicine again.,F,34,5  days,11/26/2009Email,Zithromax
601, 1, Sinus Infection,Awful racing heart_ anxiety_ weird thoughts_ fatigue,I HATE THIS DRUG! I was on the generic_ so I don't know if that's worse or not_ but I will NEVER TAKE THIS AGAIN! I could have died!,M,24,4  days,11/26/2009Email,Zithromax
602, 1, sinus infection,dizziness_ light-headedness_ stomach pains_ bloating_ sleepiness_ anxiety,After beginning this med_ I realized that I had taken it before with the same effects. I teach and by the end of the school day of the 2nd dose_ I felt like I was floating to another world. It was rough. I couldn't eat anything_ but felt like I was going to get sick if I didn't eat. I couldn't eat more than a few bites at a time though.,F,27,3  days,11/25/2009,Zithromax
603, 5, throat infection,Fatigue_ loss of appetite,Completely cured my extremely sore throat_ which had been bugging me for almost a week and seemed to get worse and worse every day. A few hours after the first dose there was suddenly no soreness left in the throat and I felt great. The only downside was the extreme fatigue and loss of appetite_ which I haven't experienced with any other antibiotics. I'm pretty sure these can't be symptomps of the infection itself_ as it seemed to be cured by the first dose already. The side effects continued for about 5 days. But I would still recommend this drug to anyone because it was just so efficient.,F,31,5  days,11/21/2009,Zithromax
604, 2, Infection,Brain Fog_ blured vision_ Nausea,I thought I was goin crazy until I came across this site.  Never experienced brain fog from an antibiotic before.

606, 4, For MAC/ NTM lung infection,I experiended a lot of the same side effects_ especially severe cramps_ that people have listed until I started taking Jarro-dopphilus (a probiotic) twice a day. I have to stay on a 500 mg dose of zithromax every day for the next 2 years(!) for this mycobacterium infection but with the probiotics I have no side effects. Absolutely none. And the lung infection shows that it's almost cleared up on my chest CTs. You have to continue with 500mg dose at least one year after no sign of infection to make sure it doesn't come back. This is a non-communicable form of TB like organism and you don't want to get this if you can help it.,Make sure to take it with a strong probiotic like Jarro-dophilus.,F,65,180  days,11/7/2009,Zithromax
607, 1, respiratory infection / bronchitis,Incredible confusion_ brain fog,I have taken z-pack before but do not recall this reaction. This is bizarre. I almost feel like I had a stroke_ very difficult to spell & write_ extreme difficulty concentrating. I even noticed a lisp temporarily this morning. Wondering if I should contact the pharmacy to see if drug might be counterfeit.  The respiratory infection I had is definitely better_ almost instantly improved_ but I feel like a bobble-head. Concerned about driving.,F,58,2  days,11/3/2009,Zithromax
608, 5, Last time pneumonia this time strep,None last time_ this time crying?,It is better than dying by drowning while you're sleeping.  You can always take probiotics later if your tummy gets upset.  To people who took this drug for lung infection_ you will have anxiety because the oxygen levels to your brain were diminished for so long (not being sarcastic_ this is just basic brain function).  The anxiety is not from the drug_ it is from PTSD and your brain not getting nutrients.  I had auditory hallucinations from pneumonia BEFORE taking Zithromax.  This drug saved my life and kept me out of the hospital.,F,45,5  days,10/28/2009,Zithromax
609, 4, Swine Flu Pneumonia,Ok_ I gave it a 4 because I am getting over the Swine (H1N1) pneumonia because of the generic z-pack made in isreal.  I am happy to have the medication_ and believe it probably saved my life!!!!  HOWEVER_ I have had more anxiety and this strange pressure around my eyes with an odd blurred vision problem.  I have sweats and dizziness.  I have one more day to take this medicine...tomorrow and I hope I make it.,On day 4 - I have to take it one more day.  I am thankful that it probably saved my life by helping me get over pneumonia but man_ it has not been easy.,F,41,4  days,10/25/2009,Zithromax

611, 2, bronchitis,nausea_ sharp cramping pains_ diarrhea,Used to love this stuff-very easy to take_ only 1x per day for 5 days.  I always had issues with cramps on the first day_ and attributed it to the double dose you have to take to get your body's level up (the trick is_ and I am no doctor so follow at your own risk_ to take the first days dose about 6-8 hours apart instead of both at once to minimize nasty cramping) .  However_ these past two times I used it_ the cramps are well into the 3rd day and I don't have a solid stool until I am off it a few days.  The cramps are very unusual short tensing pains and nothing like you have felt before_ and very obviously from the medicine.  Even now as all my bronch symptoms are gone_ I keep feeling like I'll vomit.  Definitely give it a try but it can be too strong for weaker stomach folks.,M,32,4  days,10/20/2009,Zithromax
612, 1, Ear Infection,I got the generic Azithromycin. On the first day I took the dose of two pills. Four hours later I got really sweaty and my heart started pounding! I thought I was going to die! I'm 5'8 and 105 lbs. and I expected to have some kind of side effects but NOTHING like this! My doctor recommended I stop taking it but didnt think it was from the antibiotic...How could it not have been?! It was the ONLY thing I had done differently for weeks!..... Four days later I have no appetite and am getting random bouts of diarreha.. I'm preferring to deal with the ear infection over taking this drug. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AGONY TO ANYONE!

616, 1, sinus infection,Stomach cramping and burning_ inability to eat. Broke out in rash/adult acne on my cheeks_ which has spread to the center of my face as well. It's been 2 months after_ and I am still suffering from indigestion and the rash.,This medicine made me feel awful! While it cleared up my sinus infection after 1 day_ it instantly put me to sleep upon taking it. On the second day_ my stomach started burning and I felt nauseous all day long and was unable to eat. That night the pain was horrible and it kept me up all night. The following day it was even worse_ and I decided to stop taking Zithromax. My stomach continued to burn consistently for a week after. About 1 week later_ I broke out in a strange itchy rash on my cheeks that has now spread all over my face. It has been 2 months since I took this medicine_ and I am still trying to get rid of this rash_ and get my digestive system back in order. I just purchased Pro-biotic supplements today_ and am going to see if that will help. I am convinced that the rash/acne and the antibiotics are linked. If you have any insight in this area_ feel free to contact me. I want to get my life back to normal!,F,31,3  days,10/12/2009Email,Zithromax
617, 1, strep throat,severe stomach pains immediately after taking the first pill and then vomited--continued stomach problems from then on,My daughter was given this anitibiotic 5 years ago for strep.  Ever since she has had severe stomach issues. She has always been a healthy child with NO stomach problems what so ever until this medication was given.  We have been in and out of docotr's offices_ pediatric GI specialists_ and hospital visits for her severe stomach pains tha thave lasted hours for the past 5 years!!!. I have always known this was the root of her problems and not one doctor has believed this.  Instead she has been diagnosed with such things as Irritable Bowel Syndrome_ Acid Reflux Disease (GERD)_ to all in her head.  She too has developed lactose intolerances and severe sensitivity too anything acidic which we had to find out on our own. Now she must take Nexium and any other type of antacid to help her relieve her pain.  Not the way an 11 year old child should have to live their life. After finding this site and reading posts with symptoms just like my daughters_ I am so relieved that I am not crazy and she was really effected by this horrible drug.  I know now that we need to but the natural bacteria back into her stomach that was destroyed.  Thank you to who put the name of the Doctor and the book that can finally help us help her heal and give her childhood back.,F,7,1  days,10/9/2009,Zithromax
618, 1, Post ingrown toenail surgery,Horrible diarrhea_ stomach pain_ fever_ severe pounding headache_ feel like it hurts to concentrate_ can't eat_ bloated and gassy_ no appetite,This drug should come with a Black Box Warning per the FDA.  I have taken Zithromax in the past with no problem_ but this time was a real shock.  I guess I should have known:  took Erythromycin back in May and wound up with colitis.  I have diarrhea all day_ terrible stomach pain and a headache that pounds and pounds despite all the Tylenol in the world.  Fever won't go away_ either.  I was prescribed the 250 mg pack-500 the first day_ then 250 for four days after.  I took it for three days_ and it's all I can stand.  I cannot even leave the house.  I do not recommend this antibiotic to anyone.  Even Augmentin is better than Zithromax.,F,45,3  days,10/2/2009Email,Zithromax

Took Zpack many times without problems before this was the generic form.I am now on my 13th day of not taking and still feeling effects. Spoke to pharmacist who stated it can be in the system for 15 days. Still feel itchy and occasionally SOB. I am a registered nurse. I took a five day course and had a little shortness of breath by day 4 but I have asthma and thought that might be kicking up. My sinus infection didnot go away so they had me start a second Z pack by 2nd day was in severe distress and stopped medication.,Will NEVER take again,F,48,7  days,9/29/2009,Zithromax
620, 1, Very Bad Chest Congestion,Very Strange Anxiety! Still even 9 months later!,WARNING! Be very careful of this med. It has been 9 months since I took this med. and I still fight the feelings of anxiety that it caused! It was not a typical form of anxiety! I have suffered from past panic attacks and I have O.C.D.!  This medicine caused a type of anxiety that was completely foreign to me and I can't seem to rid myself of this feeling of strange anxiety! It is a type of anxiety that is hard to describe_ I'm sure most of you will agree! It has caused me to not be able to deal with stressful situations! I have had past anxiety problems but have never not been able to deal with everyday stress! I am warning people to please be careful of this med._ especially if you have had any other type of anxiety!  I am not sure if this will ever leave me! I have gone through what some of you have gone through! My doctor even told me it could cause this_ but did not believe me when it did! I am not the type of person to shed tears normally either! Since taking this med._ I can't get them to stop!  It is the scariest medicine I have ever taken!  It is one thing to get diarhea or stomach cramps! When an antibiotic messes with the mind it should be taken off of the market! Please DON'T continue to take it if you feel any anxiety at all_ you could end up where I am_ wondering if your life will ever be normal again! Due to the lasting affects I am looking in to a Law Suit.  Feel free to leave me a post if you want to be included! Use the word Lawsuit and I will contact you!,F,55,5  days,9/27/2009,Zithromax

With the azithromyacin I feel as though I am urinating instead of moving my bowels. I know graphic but true. The anxiety is terrible. I have been on edge since day 2 and feeling very dark.

The first night I felt wonderful by day 2 however I had foggy brain and extreme hip and knee joint pain. When I called the doctor to ask about side effects they told me the pain was not related to the medicine but instead I probably slept on my hip wrong. However_ it was both hips and knees that hurt. After talking about any reprecussions with my doctor I decided to immediately quit the azirthomician. 3rd day my leg pain was gone but I am still very weak.

I called a number of behavioral health professionals after a sleepless night with 5 hours of crying and wild graphic dreams.  I could barely speak on the phone from crying.  I looked online for causes of crying uncontrollably since I had no rational reason or sadness and found many people have experienced this same effect from the drug.  I would not have connected the two and might have gone into serious psychiatric counseling for no reason. I called my doctor and said I was taking myself off because of the side effects. He didn't think the drug was the problem.  He asked me if I had recently broken up with a boyfriend.  No. So ridiculous. I told him I didn't get the connection until I looked up my symptoms on the internet.  I went down the list of symptoms and even added I had experienced vivid dreams and paranoia while on larium_ which paled in comparison.  While he knew about the side effects of Larium_ he still did not think these effects were related to z-pack- I took the generic azithromycin- and said I should get immediate help from a  psychiatrist.  He asked if I had recently lost a job or experienced the loss of a loved one.  No and No.  He just would not accept them as side effects of the drug and kept pressing some ""issue"" that would have caused this experience.",F,30,4  days,7/15/2009,Zithromax

641, 3, Inner ear infection,Stomach pain on the first night_ weird taste in mouth,I took my first dose of this stuff yesterday and it made my stomach feel weird but I went to sleep and didn't really notice unless I was awake. I took some more today and it did make me really hungry. My digestive system seems a little off but nothing that severe. I have a headache but that could be from the ear infection itself. Otherwise it looks like I won't have any horrible reactions to this drug. The only thing I can't stand is this bizarre taste in my mouth THAT WON'T GO AWAY. It's gross.,F,, ,6/20/2009,Zithromax

643, 1, Broncitis,Insomnia_ Dehydration_ Urine retention_ Anxiety_ Feelings of dieing_ low self esteem_ thoughts of severe depression.,Would never take this drug again.  It also reacted with my Acid reflex medicine.  Very bad reaction when given pepcid in the hospital. I started to feel that I wasn't myself.  I was someone else and I wanted OUT.  I had to be sedated with an even worse medication. My parents kept trying to tell the doctors that I had a bad reaction to the Zpak along with my acid reflex medicines_ and then the pepcid_ but the doctors refused to admit or agree with them.  Finally all medications were stopped and I was able to go home from the hospital.  The doctors are making me see a phyciatrist before going back to work.  No doctor will admit the effects that I experienced were caused by the Zpak interacting with my acid reflex medicine or just the effects of the Zpak.  After reading the side effects here_ I know now that they are all in bed with the drug companies and they don't really care about their patients.  Just wait until something like this happens to one of their children or themselves.  I am recovering but still have some anxiety and hope that it will leave me soon.  I also hope that I do not loose my job over this.  Prayers helped me get through this_ and I thank God that he stood by me throughout this ordeal.  I know some people can take the Zpak with no side effects_ and that is good for them_ but I can not and I almost lost my life.  Everyone's body chemistry is different and therefore everyone should think twice before taking any medication.  ,M,28,4  days,6/7/2009Email,Zithromax

645, 2, Prostatitus,Around day 5_ started having anxiety & feelings of doom_ pounding heart_ incredibly long-lasting insomnia... I would startle awake whenever I'd start to fall asleep.  Chills and flu-like feelings for weeks after taking the drug.  Night sweats for about a week.  Very frequent urination & thirst for about 3 or 4 days while taking the drug.  Fair amount of discomfort in the muscles of my lower back for almost 2 months.,"I am reposting for those with insomnia & anxiety to give some hope:  After about 3 months_ I'm finally getting 5-6 hours un-interrupted sleep w/o the help of a prescription anti-histamine (Atarax).  Have taken Azithromycin before w/ no problems_ but this was the first time using the generic.  2 months of anxiety- Have never had anxiety like this before; believed I was not going to make it.  Had the chills & ""malaise"" for a good 6 weeks.  Things were so bad that it's hard to believe they got better.  I think the problems might be related to the generic- The first few years of reports in this forum rarely mention anxiety or insomnia_ and the generics started coming out in 2006- There are many more reports like mine after that.",M,48,10  days,5/26/2009Email,Zithromax

DR SAID I WAS POSSIBLY HAVING A HEART ATTACK. INSOMNIA SOON FOLLOWED. IT COMPLETLEY DISRUPTED MY SLEEP CYLCES WHERE I WOULD AWAKE AFTER 1 HOUR OF SLEEP NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED. DR'S WILL TELL YOU THAT IT CANT CAUSE THESE SYMPTOMS BUT THEY ARE WRONG. I HAD NEVER THE SLIGHTEST SLEEP PROBLEM MY ENTIRE LIFE. NEVER HAVE USED AN ALARM CLOCK MY WHOLE LIFE THATS HOW WELL MY SLEEP/WAKE PATTERN WAS. NEVER ANY ANXIETY/PANIC ATTACKS EVER IN MY LIFE AS WELL. ALL THESE SYMPTOMS STARTED WITHIN 24 HRS OF MY FIRST AND ONLY 2 ZPACK PILLS. THATS NOT SOME COINCIDENCE. IT HAS TAKEN ALMOST ONE YEAR FOR SYMPTOMS TO IMPROVE ENOUGH TO FUNCTION AGAIN AS A NORMAL PERSON. MY FAMILY LITERALLY WATCHED ME ALMOST WASTE AWAY TO NOTHING FOR FIRST 6 MONTHS WITH NO HELP FROM DR'S EXCEPT TO PRESCRIBE ANTI-DEPRSSANTS OR ANTI-ANXIETY PILLS WHICH MADE THINGS EVEN WORSE AND TO MAKE BIG PHARMA MORE MONEY. IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY WITH DR'S. THEY WONT BELIEVE YOU ANYWAY AND WILL PRESCRIBE STUFF THAT WILL MAKE YOU WORSE OFF.

648, 1, Bad throat,Severe stomach pain_ some diarrhea_ some nausea.,I have taken this in the past with no issue_ but this time_ a few hours after the first dose I got some diarrhea_ a bit nauseous_ and a seriously unbearable stomach ache.As I would be travelling within a few days to India and could not have any cough or fever etc (they would quarantine me for 3-6 days to test for swine flu)_ I decided to take the second day's dosage_ this time making sure I ate properly.  Bad mistake because I got the nausea and severe stomach ache again_ but not the diarrhea (which I hoped for as it would've given me some relief).This is day 3 (and I won't take any more now).  I found this site because I'm looking to see if I can take something OTC to help relieve the residual stomach pain.,M,42,2  days,5/25/2009,Zithromax
649, 1, Ear Infection,Terrible stomach pains as soon as ingested.  it caused SEVERAL YEARS OF SEVERE STOMACH PROBLEMS_ for which I just solved by reading posts on this site.,"This med was given to my two year old son. After taking this medication my son immediatly had stomach problems so bad that we had to discontinue against medical advice.  No one should have to endure this much pain.  The constant pain disapaited after discontinuing use.  Then he had constant stomach pains_ especially at meal time.  He was alway hungry in the middle of the night.  Every night he would wake up hungry.  I was getting irratable with the lack of sleep and so was he.  The stomach pain got worse and my son was exhausted.  He was always moody and he was not gaining weight.  Numerous blood tests did not disclose that the Zithormax had killed all the benifical bacteria in his stomach.  He was not able to properly digest the food. He was diagnosed with irratable gut.. and tested for extremely lactose intollerant.  He had to take Prevacid every day and Lactose every time he wanted to ingest dairy.  He had been to over 10 doctors.  Including a Rhuemetologist_ as he was now 5 with severe leg pains and non of them knew the cause was the Prevacid.  There were a ton of other side effects that he obtained_ the root was the Zithromax and the secondary was the side effects from the Prevacid.  After reading a post on this site 2 months ago recommending: Sherry A. Rogers MD writes a book on this called ""No More Heartburn Stop the pain in 30 Days Naturally"" _ my son is now free of both the Prevacid and the Lactaid.",M,5,2  days,5/22/2009,Zithromax

I could only stand the side effects 2 days before I called the doctor back and asked for something else. He prescribed azithromycin this time.

Seems to have cleared out the sinus/ear infection very quickly. 3-dayy zpak.,I typically experience really really severe stomach cramps with Emycin - so was worried about taking this drug. It did cause mild stomach upset & diahreea_ but nothing terrible. I also did experience an increase to my normal back/hip pain_ but nothing unmanageable. So though I totally believe everyone who has had horrible side effects from this drug (as I have from other antibiotics -namely Keflex)_ some people can apparently take this drug without terrible problems.

656, 4, Pneumonia,Stomach upset_ gas_ promotion of GERD problems such as acid reflux_ and because of bloating and stomach pain - and increase in breathlessness and overall shallowness of breath which made the pneumonia worse at times.,"You have to weigh pain on pain. If taking the drug is worse than the problem it is solving then stop - find another way. That being said pneumonia is just one of those long_ dragging_ miserable illnesses that just goes on forever and ever. Weeks and weeks go by and it just takes forever to go away. Zithromax helps by targeting the rather unique micro-organisms (that are not bacteria). How can this not help you? It shortens the duration of pneumonia for most people - but there is a price. Everything has a price. For me_ it is upsetting other GI problems I have and it is painful at times. It is even making breathing worse at times because my stomach is pressing up against my diaphragm due to bloating and this is making the breathing harder. But I would rather suffer a few days with this with the possibility that the pneumonia could be wiped out. Theres a reason why people have a strong reaction to the word ""pneumonia"" - it sucks plain and simple. Zithromax seems to be helping.",M,32,5  days,4/24/2009,Zithromax

When walking_ I had to hold my stomach because the pain was so bad. For a continuous 30 minutes on day 3_ my stomach made the loudest noises I've ever had. On day 3_ my face took on a reddish tint. On what would have been day 4 (except that I did not take the medicine)_ I developed a red rash with small blisters right over the spot in my lower back that had been hurting since day 1. Fatigue every day. Severe headache on day 1 only. Severe dehydratio,I can stand a lot of pain but I spent most of the evening of day 3 crying from the pain. I took the 250 mg 5-day pack but stopped after day 3. I will never take this medicine again.,F,55,3  days,2/26/2009,Zithromax
691, 3, Upper Respiratory Infection,None noticed.,I took the 3-dose Z-pack 500mg each.  Although I probably have a recurring URI issue_ this medication seemed to help for the time being.,M,44,3  days,2/25/2009,Zithromax
692, 5, Bronchitis,Slight nausea on Days 1 and 2,"After reading the comments here (after I begain taking the drug) I was almost scared to continue taking it.  However_ I consider myself fortunate to have had a positive experience with the medication.  While I did have some nausea_ I realize that as with road construction_ sometimes things have to get a little more bumpy before they get a lot smoother.  So I dealt with the nausea.  By Day 3_ I was no longer showing symptoms of the bronchitis.  I was no longer coughing up blood_ coughing up phlegm all day and all night.  It really ""dried me up"".  I'm glad that I took the medication.  I guess it really is a patient by patient basis on how people respond to the drug.",M,36,5  days,2/22/2009,Zithromax
693, 2, Strep Throat,Insomnia_ anxiety_diarrhea_loss of appetite Started taking it Monday of this week and haven't slept yet. Had severe anxiety while trying to force myself to sleep. I finally checked out the side effects on-line and found this site. I really put me at ease at 3am this morning when I read other people were having similar side effects. I was ready to go to the hospital!,,M,43,5  days,2/20/2009Email,Zithromax

695, 1, Severe cough_ flu/cold symptoms,I took the double dose the first night with food_ and the next dose (single pill) the second night.  That night I experienced severe chest discomfort and extreme anxiety that honest almost prompted a call to 911.  Now_ my throat burns and I am enjoying some moderate to extreme stomach discomfort.  I have never experienced a reaction to any drug_ so this (pardon the use of the term) freaked me out.,Called my doctor_ who indicated that they had never heard of anyone really having a reaction.  Lucky me_ eh?  I will never use this stuff again_ agreeing with previous posters who note that the illness was far less of a burden than the side effects.,M,50,2  days,2/19/2009,Zithromax
696, 2, Throat infection,"First dose_ diarrhea. Second dose_ diarrhea and ""fever dreams."" Third dose_ general restlessness.",On the 5 day dose.

I was on the five day pack and began noticingterrible jitteriness and heart palpitations on and off bythe second dose. I could not sleep the night of the 3rd doseand just finished the fifth dose yesterday_ but woke this a.m. withsevere nervousness_ racing heart_ and extreme anxiety. My body felt like it was in overdrive.  Thankgoodness I found this site; otherwise_ I would be in the emergency room.  I will not take this medication again.  It istoo scarey.,,F,63,5  days,2/11/2009,Zithromax
699, 1, bronchitis,I posted on this site earlier with side effects of severe anxiety and horrible abdominal pain.  Do not take this drug if you have ever been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder-it'll bring it right back.,I wanted to tell people out there that have had a relapse in anxiety symptoms that there is hope.  Although it took me almost 6 months to get better it did happen.  I have been on amino acid therapy for the past 4 months which resulted in an almost cessation of my anxiety.  It is amazing.  Please E-mail me if you have any questions.  This drug has ruined many lives_ but it doesn't have to be a permanent thing.Good Luck To Everyone!,F,29,4  days,2/1/2009Email,Zithromax
700, 1, Bronchitis,Where do i start Anxiety_Light headedness_ Felling tired_ Pain in my chest_ Pounding heartbeat_Feeling like i was going out of my mind_ stomach pain_ Diareha.,I work in the medical field i had been diagnosed with Bronchitis. I am a 100% healthy guy.I started taking z-pac 5 pill dose. After the first day i started becoming anxious and having chest pains. Ive never had these symptoms before i landed myself a medical profesional in the ER scared as crap feelings of doom. The dr told me i was having a anxiety attack and that i should continue to take the z-pac i did. WRONG IDEA i had a major anxiety attack started crying for no reason. Major Diarreha. Finished my last dose 2 days ago and im just waiting for it to leave my system. It will take time it continues to work days 6 through 10 so i got 3 more days to freakin go. Ill never take this stuff again. Ya the medicaition states all the above side effects but it says it doesnt happen frequently. Thats why i ended up here sounds to me like it does.,M,26,5  days,2/1/2009,Zithromax
701, 4, strep throat,Might be experiencing mild headaches due to z-pak_ but maybe it's because my throat hurts so bad I haven't been able to eat or sleep very much.  Other than the tolerable head ache_ no other side effects noticed.,Just took 2nd dose 4 hours ago.  Throat still hurts like heck and neck is still sore_ but I think the uvula and tonsil swelling is starting to get a little smaller.  Neck glands are still sore too.,F,40,2  days,1/26/2009,Zithromax

I recommend going the traditional ten day route of antibiotics!,F,50,3  days,1/23/2009,Zithromax
703, 2, Sinus Infection,upset stomach_ loose stools_ severe anxiety_ metallic taste in mouth,I've taken zpack before but I believe this is the first time I have had the generic (azithromycin) and it is also the first time I have experienced these side effects.  The anxiety is very bad.  It didn't start until after my last dose which is why I didn't even relate it to the drug until reading these posts.  Each pill has a half life of 68 hours so I'm hoping I feel better in a few more days.  I have been on prozac for nearly 15 years for anxiety so I know what it feels like and I am feeling very much like I did before I started taking prozac.  How can the generic be so different than the regular zpack.  I won't take the generic again.  I'll pay full price for zpack out of my pocket if I have to.  I will say it did clear up my sinus infection promptly though.,F,39,5  days,1/21/2009,Zithromax
704, 1, Strep,Worked great the first 3 days_ got rid of the strep as far as I can tell.  The only side-effect was a headache on the 3rd day.  But on 4th day without any warning I broke out in Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome type symptoms_ rash from head to toe_ burning all over_ burning ears_ itching_ in pain and with no help or relief to be found by doctors. I am sitting counting hours hoping it goes away and doesn't get worse.,,F,28,4  days,1/17/2009,Zithromax

706, 3, Sinus Infection,Stomach Pains_ Disorientation,About an hour after taking the first dose (double) I started feeling really disoriented and had really bad stomach pains. I have never taken this medicine before_ but have never suffered any kind of side effects from antibiotics before. I finished my 5th day on January 16th and I still am not over this sinus infection. I feel a lot better_ but it's not gone. Today started the diarrhea. It is non-stop. I probably will not be taking this medicine again.,F,21,5  days,1/12/2009,Zithromax
707, 2, sinus infection,Non-stop headache_ chest pain/tightness_ joint pain_ muscle aches_ diarrhea,Zithromax did not entirely clear up my sinus infection and has left me feeling more miserable than I started.

709, 1, respitory infection,Within 20 minutes of taking the 2 pills the nightmare began. It started with a sever hot flash followed by a tightening of the chest. A few minutes later disorientation & my heart started to race like it could pop out of my chest I realized then I was having a bad reaction to this medicine. My heart rate slowed down within 5 minutes - and my whole body was shaking. Now I was cold_ clammy_ light headed and very weak - but at least I didn't feel disoriented anymore. Just when I thought the nightmare was over... on came the most terrifying stomach pains!!! These sharp burning pains lasted about 30 minutes - the longest 30 minutes in my life!   I lay in bed for three hours until the worst of side effects went away. Once I could get my bearings I grabbed the z pack and flushed it!  I thought to myself 1% my arse...yeah I read the info that comes with it - adverse side effects and testing states this happens to only 1% of people. Well it appears there is a whole lot more of us out there,Run dont walk from this crap,F,35,1  days,1/7/2009,Zithromax
710, 2, Strep (suspected)_ upper respirator,mild headache_ very bad abdominal discomfort_ diarrhea for the first couple of days,I have taken this medication before without noticing any side effects.  It's a different story this time_ I feel horrible!  My rapid strep test on Friday was negative but the lab test results were not going to be available until Monday.  I also had symptoms of a upper respiratory infection.  I was put on the Z-Pak just in case.  Monday's labs were negative and I feel miserable with abdominal cramps and slight nausea and no appetite.  I stopped the medication after day-3 due to the discomfort and negative labs.  To be fair_ I believe the medication did help with the respiratory symptoms.  However_ the side effects_ this time_ are too much.  I have become a victim of the cure and_ to me_ it's not worth it this time.  I don't think I will try this product again_  The first time it worked well and this time it helped some.  It is a mixed bag of results so you have to try it yourself_ be your own judge.  Good Luck!,M,54,3  days,1/5/2009,Zithromax

She came in and told me that she thought I had an infection and insisted on treating me for one_ in other words big mistake!!!! She thought it was alright to have a woman that is 5'1 and 108lbs swallow 15 pills_ 2000mg of Zitromax and 1000mg of some other antibiotic at once. Needless to say_ my blood sugar is very low_ now I have calcium in both kidneys not just one. I feel that I am getting worst_ not better! Oh yeah_ my test came back negative for any STD~~~~~~~~My doctor is in disbelief_ I don't think he even believed me until he obtained my records.

I was given Z-Pak after a tooth extraction as I had a bad (and similar) reaction to Clydamycin.I was on the 250 MG X 3 days. After the first day I started to suffer from depersonalization. Depersonalization_ in my opinion_ is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. Essentially I felt like I was dead_ in limbo. Nothing mattered. I questioned reality. I felt like a ghost. It was so bad that I had to break out the Bible.I had to take Valium in order to sleep_ as I would wake up in the middle of the night and have an utterly terrifying feeling of dread. I would wake up and ""realize"" that I did not exist and have a panic attack.",M,35,3  days,12/16/2008Email,Zithromax

By the evening_ it got worse.  It has to ride its course for a couple of days before you see an improvement.  No swelling of the tongue as of yet_ but what a constant worry it has been.  I was up all night with her next to me making sure that she wasn't struggling to breath.  Someone said it should be taken off the market_ it probably should be.

My son is currently experiencing a psychotic episode because he took two tablets (first dose) of this medicine.  He is paranoid_ having hallucinations_ severe stomach pain_ anxiety_ nightmares_ confusion and more.  He isn't able to work or go to school_ can't eat or sleep and it has been a week since he took the medicine.  The claim is that less than 1% of the people that take this medicine have an extreme reaction.

There are other alternatives.  She has had strep since & plain old amoxicylin (sp?) clears it up fine with no side effects.  The Zpak side effects are NOT WORTH IT just to take medicine for a shorter period of time.,BEWARE! Sometimes the side effects don't make an appearance until a WEEK AFTER you have STOPPED taking the Zpak. The doctor will try to tell you it is not the medication - don't believe them.

800, 1, bronchitis,Very high anxiety started the 2nd day. I stopped the medication. It felt like a nagging unwanted energy akin to bad drug trips I have heard described.,The postings on this sight seem well balanced and well intended.

801, 3, Bronchitus,Severe stomach pain_ slight nausea and diarhea,THESE SIDE EFFECTS ARE ONLY FROM THE GENERIC KIND. I took the Z pak about a month ago and had NO side effects and it worked beautifully to get rid of the bronchitus.  DON'T ACCEPT GENERIC!,F,19,2  days,2/8/2008,Zithromax
802, 4, Strep Throat,Took the five-day Z-Pak. Diarrhea_ but not intolerable. I have an itchy rash_ but I had a rash with the strep. I can't tell if the rash is still from strep_ or if it's from the Z-Pak. Joint pain in my knees and burning leg muscles. I can't think of what else would cause this_ so I'm blaming the Z-Pak. Tonight I take my last dose.,Worked like magic on strep. I think I would ask for an alternative antibiotic in the future_ but I'm allergic to Sulpha and Amoxicillian_ so I think I'm running out of options.,F,33,5  days,2/5/2008,Zithromax

805, 1, Doctor not sure just wanted me to,WATERY diarrhea_ no appetite_ LITERALLY brown watery substance_ lots of gas too.,I've had a virus for a month now_ and my doc told me to take this 5 day pack 'just to cover our bases' he says!! he's not even told me if I have an infection_ but cause I'm sick and not getting better I'm taking it_ I'm coughing up yellow mucus_ but he said that doesn't mean I have an infection.  I never thought I could have such a watery substance come out of my behind!  Like clockwork after taking pill two hours pass_ then BAM run to the nearest toilet! the first time it happend my husband thought I was throwing up! and everyone knows what that sounds like! HORRIBLE and I don't even know why I'm taking this_ I'm calling my doc in the morning for an explanation! Meanwhile I'm going to buy some yogurt to see if it helps!,F,22,2  days,1/31/2008Email,Zithromax
806, 4, sinus infection,Started with 1000mg/week taken all at once. Skull-crushing headache for the first 2 days. Physical anxiety symptoms (increased heart rate and blood pressure_ palpitations_ sweats_ cold hands and feet) but not psychological. I feel calm_ almost sedated. Feel feverish at times but temperature is normal. Foggy head. Decreased appetite. Increased thirst. Second week I changed to taking 250mg every other day. No more headaches. Still some anxiety and chills but not as bad. No digestive problems but I take probiotics so I think that helps.,I get frequent sinus infections and am usuall prescribed Augmentin. It works but takes 3-4 weeks' worth and symptoms take a week or more to improve. With azithromycin my sinus infection seems to have cleared up within the first few days. Noticeably improved sense of smell and easier breathing through my nose.,F,45,14  days,1/19/2008,Zithromax

808, 4, sinus infection,nausea_ dizziness_ hot flashes,I have taken this many times for sinus infections. It works quickly and effectively cured me every time. However on the 4th and 5th day I get the symptoms of nausea_ dizziness_ and hot flashes usually in the evenings_ severe enough that I nearly pass out.,F,23,5  days,1/14/2008,Zithromax
809, 4, Sinus Infection,"Thirty minutes after taking the first pill I experienced a ""pins and needles"" feeling in my stomach which subsided after about and hour. On days 2 and 3 I also had the ""pins and needles"" feeling after taking the pill. Would have moments where I felt swimmy-headed_ but the feeling never lasted long_ maybe three minutes at a time. I did have diarrhea several times while I was taking the Z-Pak_ but this could have been from something I ate. After completing all 5 days of the Z-Pak I woke up in the middle of the night soaked in a cold sweat. I had to change my clothes and flip my pillows over. I noticed my chest and neck beginning to break out. It is now 5 days since I finished the medication and I have a pimply rash all over my neck and chest which seems to be getting better. Other than that_ I feel fine.",The side effects were not a huge deal_ but I will let my doctor know about them if I ever need an antibiotic again. There are so many alternatives. I would not want to take Zithromax again_ just incase my pains_ diarrhea_ rash_ and swimmy-headed feelings were all caused from taking the Z-Pak.,F,30,5  days,1/12/2008,Zithromax
810, 3, sinus infection,My son has severe behaviorial reactions after even one dose. He can't sleep_ has nightmares and becomes extremely emotional and violent over small things that don't normally bother him.,The first time he used it_ I thought he had a sleeping disorder and talked to the doctor. We figured out it was probably the medicine_ which she said has a different half-life than other antibiotics_ so it would take about 30 days to get out of his system. I marked the calendar and it was exactly that long. A few years later we tried it again_ thinking he might have outgrown the reaction_ but was affected after just one dose so we quit it.,M,5,1  days,1/10/2008,Zithromax

812, 5, Sinus Infection,None - This was a surprise because I have always had side effects with other antibiotics,This was my first time to take Zithromax. I know everyone is affected differently by medications_ but so many things people listed are obviously symptoms of their illness - fatigue_ headache_ teeth hurting_ sinus pressure_ etc. It's hard to trust feedback from the many entries blaming everything wrong with them on taking just one or two pills.,F,42,5  days,1/6/2008,Zithromax

814, 1, possible recurrent sinusitis,The first day after finishing the five-day course_ I became very fatigued_ dizzy_ had a headache.  After 3 days I became extremely sensitive to cold_ hands and feet becoming so cold it was painful_ cold legs_ unwell feeling_ constant headache and fatigue.  After over 2 weeks I am having trouble falling asleep still.  I havent suffered from anxiety in 10 years_ but after taking this medicine_ I am feeling symptoms of anxiety.,People should try to take the more mild antibiotics first before resorting to more powerful ones such as Zithromax.  Bacteria is becoming more resistant so soon we'll all have to take the powerful ones_ and some_ like me_ will feel even worse after taking it than we did before.  I will not take this again.,F,44,5  days,1/2/2008,Zithromax
815, 3, sinus infection,This is the second time I've taken it and this time I didn't have any side effects which makes me wonder if the side effects I had before weren't caused by Zithromax. However it seemed to improve the sinus infection it didn't get rid of it - I'm still congested almost 1 month later.,,M,46,5  days,12/19/2007,Zithromax

It is now about the 12th day and still have some side effects left.  Has anyone else had this and how many days did it take to get out of your system.  Doctor has mentioned  taking diuretic_ but I'm concerned about taking more medication at this point.  Are there any other remedies?,Don't take!,M,45,5  days,12/18/2007,Zithromax
817, 4, Ear - upper respitory infection,Two days after finishing the Z-pack_ painful red lumps appeared on hands_ fingers and mouth interior_ including tongue.  Twenty minutes after taking each dose - I had to RUN to the toilet.  Explosive doo-doo ensued.  On the last day of the pack_ I had an upset stomach for about three hours after clearing my bowels (and that end of the house).  Other than the rash_ it seems to be working quite well.  However_ the rash is a sign of an allergic reaction and my doctor banned it for future use on me.,Zithromax is a powerful medicine and works well.  Care should be taken to monitor your body's reaction to it.  You should expect SOMETHING to happen_ like the loose stool_ but if unusual stuff crops up_ notify your doc as soon as possible.  From what I understand (I am NOT an expert or even in healthcare)_ allergic reactions can pop up days after you finish the medicine - it is still in the bloodstream several days later doing its job.,M,39,6  days,12/17/2007Email,Zithromax

Day 2 (after the second dose):  experienced nausea and terrible dizziness_ to the point where I couldn't walk.,I'll never take it again_ and indeed did not finish the whole course.

I do remember taking this antibiotic years ago and not having any mememorable problems_ so maybe it is harder on your body when you are older.  Or maybe you just don't relate what is going on in your head to a drug.  I took Cipro a few months ago_ and had very strange thoughts/anxiety.

I did have a bad headache that sent me home from work_ but I was not surprised as taking this medicine is the equivalent of taking 30 doses of conventional antibiotics.  When bacteria is killed and it floats in your blood it can cause your body to have a fever.  The headache was not pleasant_ but the bronchitis was much worse.  I was coughing a lot and that could also cause a headache.,F,36,5  days,10/16/2007,Zithromax

I told them of my history of anxiety problems and concerns.  They assured me that there was NO SIDE EFFECT!  So_ I took it.  The panic attack was so horrible.  I thought I was dying. It started out with me getting a little flushed_ then racing heart_ then racing thoughts_ dizziness_ confusion_ terror...,Be very careful with this or any antibiotic.

This time I could only sleep 2-3 hours a night with the help of Tylenol PM.  The itching was so bad that it felt like bugs were crawling in my ears_ eyebrows_ scalp and genital area.  Thank you to others who wrote in this column about this - I thought I was losing it.

The medicine has cleared up the majority of my symptoms_ but the side effects are a bit rough.  I have generalized anxiety_ and this medicine has made it much worse.  The headache and nausea are not that bad.  Today was the first time that I had watery diarrhea.  I plan on finishing the treatment_ but I do not think I will use this antibiotic again.,M,32,3  days,9/22/2007,Zithromax
837, 1, potential sinus or ear infection,Shingles. I had a cold and was taking cold medicine which includes an antihistamine_ and had been working out the morning before I felt pain on the right side of my back. I thought I had some sort of scrape or sore_ but there was no sign of anything on my skin. Later that same evening I had very sharp pain on the right side of my back and had great difficulty sleeping as the pain was intense and unrelenting_ even breathing hurt it and bed sheets or clothing touching the area. I thought I'd probably pulled a muscle working out since I had just started a new workout routine. I went to the doctor the next day who prescribed muscle relaxants and prescription naprozen for pain and to apply heat compress to the site. He also prescribed z-pak (i.e. zithromax) for potential ear_ throat or sinus injection as I had been coughing up sputum and had congestion. The next day I had some mild pink rash running along my right side. The following day the rash was red and forming small blisters and the p,Sure enough I was later diagnosed with shingles. I believe the cold medication might have been masking the onset of shingles_ and that the zithromax_ probably along with the cold_ may have weakened my immune system bringing about an outbreak of shingles after only two does of zithromax. Given the comments I read on this site I felt compelled to write my experience related to shingles outbreak soon after taking zithromax. I have stopped taking zithromax and am following up with antiviral medication and narocotic pain med for the nerve pain_ and topical applications of calomine lotion and cool compresses_ not heat. I also was told to avoid contact with anybody who has not had chicken pox_ including my soon to be new grandchild unitil the affected skin blistering and liquid rash has stopped and is dried up and flaking. Thanks to your information I have saved my grandchildren from an outbreak of chicken pox that would be detrimental to their health.

838, 5, Sinusitis,Some ring/buzz in the ear at first_ but I am stuffed up anyway an it's not like it lasted more than a couple seconds.,I take this for every sinusitis or sinus infection I get. I am on the 3 day dose right now_ which I have taken before and will take again. It stays in your body for 10 days past the 3 day dose so there is no constant pill taking or overdose possibility. I like this verses amoxicillan because amox upsets my stomach horribly and zithromax doesn't really have any side effects for me. It depends on the person. Every persons body chemistry is different. I am also on birth control_ so I don't have to worry about yeast infections as with zithromax like I would with other antibiotics. Zithromax works great and I will definitely use it again. Out of all the antibiotics_ any doctor will tell you this is the least of the drugs to give you diarrhea problems while treating a sinus infection.,F,26,3  days,9/21/2007,Zithromax

At first I noticed palpitations that lasted for several minutes_ then progressively got worse. Stomach bloating to the point that I had to sit in positions to alleviate the pains. Terrible pain in my jaw when I ate hard food_ to the point that I thought I dislocated my jaw. Anxiety was overwhelming. Feeling of unwellness. Blurry vision. Disorientation_ burning feeling to skin_ but no signs of rash. Shivers and cold hands. Back pain_ feeling of swelling in my neck and arms. This started when I began to take the meds and has continued now for 3 days since ending treatment. The weird dreams are exciting at least. Although I haven't gotten a full nights sleep in a week. Irritability and a sense of doom.

I've taken Zith several times_ for bacterial respiratory infections (sinusitus_ bronchitis) and have never had a problem. My doctor said it is slow-acting_ so I didn't really feel it kick in strongly until today (day 3). But today I feel *much* better. I noticed a slight improvement the day after starting the 1st dose_ and I was starting to worry if I was taking the right abx_ but I think this is going to do the trick.,F,43,5  days,9/18/2007,Zithromax

The next day was ok_ just slightly loose stool_ so I thought everything would be fine. The third day_ i took the pill and about two hours later I was doubled up with the worst stomach pain of my life_ extremely nauseous and thought I was going to die. I was gasping for breath and kept swooning_ couldn't get up off of the bathroom floor. It lasted about an hour and then the symptoms suddenly faded. That was last night and now only slight stomache pains remain. I will NOT take the last two doses_ that stuff is death in a capsule.,,F,18,3  days,9/13/2007Email,Zithromax

Decreased appetite.,I took a 3 day prescription of the generic_ azithromycin at 500mg a day. It was finished 2 days ago_ and my throat is still itchy. I am wondering if the medicine worked. It did help_ the symptoms have improved compared to what they were when I went to the doctor. I hope this clears up soon. As for the medicine itself_ I have no complaints. It upset my stomach like most antibiotics do.  I am surprised I didnt have panic attacks like others have mentioned here_ even though I am very prone to having them and I usually have them when I try a new medicine (medicine in general scares me_ haha!) but I havent experienced anything more than mild palpitations with this medicine. One thing that I did appreciate about this medicine is that it did not require me to avoid being in the sun_ so I was still able to enjoy my outdoor plans on the weekend while taking it (as much as a person can enjoy being outdoors while sick_ haha!).

This went away about 3 days after I stopped the medication.,My sinus infection got better after 3 days of the 5 day course of medicine_ so my dr took me off of it.  It worked well_ but the side effects were too nasty for me to ever take it again.  After being completely freaked out_ I looked online and found that many others had the same side effects.

I contacted the doctor and she suggested not to give him his last dose. But now that I look back on it_ he did seem more irritable_ cranky_ not wanting to sleep_ sometimes out of it_ and at times he even seemed to belly ache. I hope that there was nothing else going on that we do not know about. I really don't like giving medicine to my son because he can't tell us how he feels.

However_ I have continued to struggle with anxiety mostly when I try to lay down (I start to doze off when anxiety hits out of nowhere about nothing and I get tense and start sweating) but also sometimes while awake.  I have never had problems with anxiety until now.  My doctor started me on Z-pack yesterday and I am still having the same problems.

I took this medicine in the past and had no side affects.  This time_ I had to go to two doctors visits_ the last in the ER having my rings cut off due to swelling.,F,32,4  days,8/21/2007,Zithromax
850, 1, Pneumonia,Watery diarrea_ burning stomach_ hot and cold flashes_ severe anxiety_ depression_ rapid pulse_ feelings of coldness all over my body. A wired feeling followed by extreme tiredness. feelings of impending doom. Also very weird dreams_ when I took a nap.,This was given to me at the ER. I was diagnosed with pneumonia_ which can be life threatening_ So I agreed to take the 2 pills the nurse gave me. I also recieved a prescription for the 3 pack to take_ but I don't think I can continue this medication. This medication alone_ feels life threatening. I only took the first double dose. I am sitting here so dizzy and anxious_ and feeling unwell. Even with the Pneumonia_ the side effects of this antibiotic_ are greater than the benifits for me.,M,34,1  days,8/20/2007Email,Zithromax
851, 3, Possible Mono or Strep,Insomnia- NAUSEA!!!- and Diarrhea-if you get this DRINK A LOT OF WATER!! it helps so much seriously and stay away from caffiene and fried foods or dairy.  Also keep dramamine nearby it helps (even though it may knock you out),it usually works but beware!,F,20,2  days,8/19/2007,Zithromax
852, 3, Strep throat,Sweats fatigue and general disorientation_ probably caused by the strep.  Loose stool.,Took 10-day amoxicilin treatment_ then strep came back.  So the prompt care doc prescribed a 10-day cephalexin treatment and same thing_ it came back after i finished treatment.  Now im on day 3 of this 5-day azithromycin and it seems to be working_ but slower than the previous 2 antibiotics even though my doctor said it was supposed to be stronger than the previous 2???!!,M,25,5  days,8/10/2007,Zithromax
853, 3, skin infection,1 hour after first dose explosive water from rectum-_some sweating at first- that went away_ insomnia_ bloated stomache_ gas,I have taken this medicine before but am now reacting to it differently_ i took two benadryl-which usually knocks me out and I can't get to sleep-stay close to home!!I was on job interview-had to use bathroom right next to his desk-embarrassing!Then left had to stop 3 blocks down at deli_ then again when i got home-drink plenty of water and eat yogurt,F,33,5  days,8/4/2007,Zithromax
854, 4, Strep Throat,I took a 3 day regimen_ two 250mg tablets by mouth once a day for 3 days. My throat felt better on day 3_ all pain gone on day 4 but today is day 5_ two days OFF and I have broken out into a horrible rash all over my neck_ chin and chest and upper back/neck. So_ I was pleased with the relief from the strep but now I got another problem. I have taken Benedryl_ I hope that helps!!,,F,35,3  days,7/26/2007Email,Zithromax
855, 5, Sinusitis / Ear Infection,No side effects whatsoever. I did experience ringing in the ears_ but this was likely caused by the infection_ not the drug.,One day after taking the first dose_ my ear infection had subsided considerably with one ear draining completely. Within a few days it was totally gone. This is the second time I have been prescribed this medication and I would definitely take it again_ as it works fine for me. I am confused by some of the other comments on severe anxiety and other effects; didn't experience anything of the sort. You may want to consider causes other than the antibiotic if this is the case.,M,20,5  days,7/20/2007,Zithromax
856, 3, sinus infection/ear infection,loss of appetite_ abdominal cramping_ tiredness_ funny dry taste in mouth,I have used this medication before.  Didn't remember feeling this way when I took it_ however.  I do feel better in terms of the sinus infection/ear infection but I have a persistent cough especially at night.  Could be post nasal drip.  My appetite is not good.  Can't really taste food.  Water seems to be the only thing I crave.  I did have severe_ doubling over type abdominal cramping after the first 2 pill dose on day 1.  Not so much now.  Just took my last dose this morning. Hope to begin to feel better now that I'm through with it.  Would not say that I would not take this again_ as it usually takes care of the infections I have one to two times a year.  Still hoping for an effective antibiotic that doesn't make me feel so yucky.,F,56,5  days,7/15/2007,Zithromax
857, 2, Inner ear infection,While on the drug I was knocked out_ dizzy_ and sleepy for about 3 hours after each dose. I mean out... All the way asleep. My fever went down and the pain in my ear felt a bit better. I had some stomach problems_ mostly not appetite and loose stool while on the Zmax. Other problems started at the end of treatment...,The problem for me is that on day 3_ the only time I slept was right after the pill. It has been a week since my last pill and I am still up every night and am only sleeping a few hours a night with the help of a sleeping aid. I also still feel sick and got a blistery/pimply rash all over my neck_ chest_ and back (2 days after the last does)which is gross and the fever came back. Went back to Urgent Care_ but the doctor didn't know why all that was happening. Is it possible that Zmax is so strong that once you get off it your immune system goes into shock or something.,F,26,5  days,7/14/2007,Zithromax
858, 1, ear infection,LOUD ringing_ high pitched ringing_ constant.. in my ears_ making it difficult to hear people speak.  Started after first dose. Days later_ I still have the ringing.

860, 1, Sinus Infection then Bronchitis,I started taking this medication for a sinus infection.  I took one round and began experiencing anxiety_ racing heart_ feelings of doom_ stomach craps_ etc...I attributed this to being sick for several weeks and taking too many over-counter meds.  It got so bad that I went to a cardiologist just to make sure I wasn't having severe heart problems.  Everything was fine in terms of the heart_ but the anxiety lasted about a month after finishing the Z-pack.  I had to get a prescription for Zanax.  Fast-forward two months.  Another sinus infection_ this time with Bronchitis.  I started another Z-pack and 2+@ finally came together. This time I HAD NOT been taking any other OTC meds_ and the symptoms CAME BACK.  They started after day three. I called my doc_ and he told me to not take the remaining two pills.,Pay very close attention to your reaction to the drug.  If you experience any of the side-effects contact your doc. immediately,M,37,5  days,6/25/2007,Zithromax
861, 4, Bladder infection,I've taken zithromax 3 times and each time I get severe stomach cramping and diarrhea about 2-3 hours after the first dose.  This last time I was given just 4 pills to take and a shot of antibiotics - and this time was the worst.  2 days later and I still have an upset stomach...  UGH!!!,I have to say it does work though!,F,35,1  days,6/14/2007,Zithromax
862, 4, Sinusitis,Fatigue. I just didn't want to move or get out of bed while on the drug; it was a bit hard to figure out that this was an effect of the medication rather than the sinusitis. Otherwise I was fine.,I took this drug (generic azithro 500 mg bid) to get rid of an 2+ week old sinus infection that did not clear with decongestants and antihistamines. The drug made a substantial difference within 2 days. I'm a physician and needed to return to work_ and the tiredness was just excessive_ so I stopped the drug after 48-72 hours. The infection did not return. I would take this drug again if I needed to kill off an infection. I don't expect to feel good all the time. If a drug is making me healthy in a particular way_ it's up to me to weigh that benefit against the cost of side effects.,M,45,2  days,6/13/2007,Zithromax

NASTY stuff despite what that guy below says!,"The pack says ""may cause stomach pain"" but I had SEVERE stomach pains/cramps_ to the point where i was curled up in a ball. Feeling as though I was going to be sick every few minutes_ but nothing would happen - when I finally started to_ I was in incredible pain in my stomach. The pain was unbearable_ and there is no way I would take this ever again. I honestly felt as though I was about to die.

864, 5, Sinus infection,none,What is wrong with all of you people?  Anxiety attacks?  Why would an antibiotic biochemically cause an anxiety attack?  Zithromax's mechanism of action involves blocking specifically BACTERIAL protein production.  It has absolutely NOTHING to do with neurological function or neurochemistry.  This is the worst website ever created - it's basically a bunch of overly anxious patients who can't just listen to their doctor's advice and has to read other peoples' conspiracy theories about how every single drug out there should be taken off the market.  You people need to see a psychologist_ not a medical doctor.,M,34,5  days,6/9/2007,Zithromax
865, 5, sinus infection,slight dizziness_ slight stomache/side/back cramps at differing times_ chest heaviness,I had a nasty cold/flu for a week before the sinus infection and had missed two days of work.  I was unbearably congested and I began to feel better within hours of taking this drug.  It cleared my sinusitus and the residual coughing from post-nasal drip.  I took a Prilosec early in the morning and had the antibiotic about two hours after lunch and did not have bad stomache problems.  I took 500mg pills and found this medication extremely effective with very minor side-effects.,F,39,4  days,6/7/2007,Zithromax

I was given 3 pills that are supposed to last for 7 days. I went to the ER 3 times and tried to explain what was happening to me but no doctor or nurse believed me. They checked my blood and heart and said I looked fine so there was no allergic reaction and tried to send me home. Obviously doctors are not really well informed about this drug. After the drug finally wore off I returned to normal and everything was fine for about 1 month. Then suddenly one day I had a full blown panic attack that brought all the horrible feelings back. Now the doctors think I have anxiety disorder but I'm sure that it's much more than that. I have dizzy spells_ depersonalization_ lightheadedness_ and roaming pains all the time. I lost my job and now feel so ""out of it"" I can't get another. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Any long term effects? How did you get over it?

868, 4, Sinus Infection,Fatigue - but this is most likely due to the sinus infection itself_ not the drug.,It amazes me that people think that drugs should be taken off the market because they had side effects from it. ALL DRUGS come with side effects. It is up to YOU_ the CONSUMER to consider the benefits vs risks and make an informed choice as to whether or not you want to take the med. There will NEVER be a SIDE-EFFECT-FREE drug_ people. Antibiotics save lives. And for heavens sake dont just stop taking them mid-course. That's what is creating all these drug-resistant strains of bacteria.,F,37,5  days,6/1/2007,Zithromax

All these symptoms occured directly after taking the one time liquid dose.,I thought I was going to pass out in the Doctor's office. I pretty much had a full blown panick attack. The nurses acted like they had never seen symptoms of this sort and said that this medication should only cause nausea. I thought I was crazy until I got home and started reading that I had the exact same side effects as a lot of other people on this medication. This is only the first day that I have been takig it_ and I am scared to death to see what the next few days are going to be like...I will NEVER take this medicine ever again! I probably did not really need it in the first place. I wish the nurses would present the dangers/side effects before administering medication of this sort!!! I think I have to PUKE!,F,25,1  days,5/25/2007,Zithromax
871, 5, chronic Lyme Disease,none at all other than tiredness after several months on the azithromycin. Great antibiotic for my very serious illness.,I took this for about four months after first starting on Doxycycline. The azithromycin was so much easier on my system- no nausea or anything. I did lots of yogurt and probiotics- important for any antibiotic use and might prevent your diarrhea. I eventually got very_ very tired and thought it was the Lyme- it turned out to be the side effect of the zithromax and went away three days after I stopped. I've continued to treat with herbs successfully and this antibiotic did a lot to knock out what had been a disabling case of Lyme. See www.ILADS.org for more Lyme antibiotic information_ most doctors dont' know how to treat this disease long enough.,F,35,135  days,5/20/2007,Zithromax
872, 2, sinus/ear infection,On day three of taking the zpack the side effects started and reached extreme levels the day I completed the 5 day treatment.  I experienced severe stomach pain and cramping.  This in itself I can deal with.  The unexplainable anxiety that would last for as long as three hour periods is something few could handle.  The anxiety would cause my blood pressure to go through the roof.,The infections did clear up.  However_ I would take the infections over the anxiety any day.  This is the second time this has happened to me after taking zithromax.  Two years ago the anxiety lasted for three months and the stomach problems resulted in being perscribed previcid and lasting 9 months off and on.  Once again_ I consulted my Dr. and a pharmasist_ and once again I was treated as if there is no way this could happen.  So I researched this on the internet (including this site) and came up with a long shot.  ACTIVIA!  Two days after completing the zpack I started consuming Activia in large qtys (10+ a day).  I had instant results.  Truth be told it was the only thing I had eaten in 3 days (any food / water/ drink would start my stomach and anxiety problems).  If my stomach started acting up I would eat 2-3 and my stomach would instantly settle down.  It is now 5 days after completing the zpack and I am eating 2 a day and not experiencing any side effects.,M,40,5  days,5/19/2007Email,Zithromax
873, 1, Bad sinus infection,Two hours after I took the first dose_ the nausea and a general feeling of crappiness (even worse than I'd felt from just the bad sinus infection) started. By that night I'd also become dizzy_ started sweating profusely_ and couldn't sleep_ and I almost blacked out at one point.,I hate this drug. It was worse than the horrible sinus infection the Z-Pac was supposed the treat.  I will never take it again. The mere thought of getting near Z-Pac makes me recoil in horror.,F,34,1  days,5/17/2007,Zithromax
874, 5, sinus infection,stomach upset for 2 hours after taking pill_ mild dizziness_ went away after done with medication,It helped me immediatly.  I was on augmentin before I began taking this drug and wasn't getting better and had horrible diarrhea.  Within two hours of taking zithromax I felt MUCH MUCH better.  I don't think any drug is a wonder drug...I think they all have a price to pay in side effects.  I was lucky however and ended up with some stomach cramping and a bit of dizziness.  I had very bad vertigo the second day but I really think that was because I was being treated for a sinus infection and my frontal sinus was finally draining.  I have a feeling it was draining to my ears.  Other than that who can complain about feeling completely better?!,F,26,3  days,5/15/2007,Zithromax
875, 5, Bronchitis/Sinusitis,Minor cramps that could've been caused by anything.,People on this site are complaining about how horrible this drug is but must realize that much of what they were experiencing could've been caused by any number of things... not necessarily the Zithromax.  Some people seem to just need a scapegoat... anyway_ great safe drug... I've used it several times with only very minor problems,M,23,5  days,5/15/2007,Zithromax

877, 3, Sinus Infection,Slight diarrera.  Only side affects is that it did not get rid of the entire infection_ but I have tend have very strong sinus infections.  I believe for the vast majority of people with sinus infections this drug does the trick.  Take the mediciation with plenty of food and include yogurt in your diet.  This will go a long way to helping with side affects.  Don't be dumb and take the med on an empty stomach or very little food.,"Don't be mislead by some of the comments posted here.  First_ there is ALWAYS side affects to meds but that does not mean they are bad.  Yes_ this is a powerful antibiotic but then again if you were placed on it you probably have a nasty bug so the need for a powerful med is warranted.  Welcome to the ""practice"" of medicine_ its not called the ""perfection"" of medicine.  I had sinus surgery_ which is extremely painful_ and here is my two cents worth.  Trust me when I say_ if you have a bad sinus infection CRUSH it.  When you get a sinus infection your sinuses are swollen and the longer they stay swollen the more difficult it is for your body to get them healed.  The more times you are sick with an infection or if they last long then your sinuses have more and more trouble getting back to normal and this can lead to conditions that warrant surgery.  Clearly not getting sick in the first place is your best route.  Trust me_ dealing with some side affects from antibioti",M,33,4  times,5/5/2007,Zithromax

Every time I would be close to falling asleep_ I would spasm and wake up. After the 3rd day of taking it I called the doctor and was told to stop taking it. I am now into my 2nd day of not taking it_ but am still having total insomnia_ my heart races like mad_ and the anxiety is murder.

880, 4, Severe sinus infection,Extremely effective_ but anxiety.,I get severe sinus infections every year or two.  Other antibiotics never clear them up_ and they progress to where they are quite painful and approaching the life threatening stage.  Zithromax knocks them out great_ it's very effective.  Like others_ I am experiencing heightened anxiety... while it's really unpleasant_ I can't complain too much - the pain is gone_ the sinus infection is clearing up_ and the anxiety will pass.  Oh_ also like others I'm dealing with the GI issues with a lot of yogurt (which I make at home anyway).,M,37,5  days,4/19/2007,Zithromax

Even my teeth hurt.  1.5 months later all side effect subsided except constant buzzing in ears.  4 ER trips later I am being treated for TMJ through OBI dentist and seeing a chiropractor 3 times a week to adjust stiff neck trying to get rid of noise.  Wow!  This drug has turned my life upside down.  Sleeping with a rain maker at night to mask noise in the left ear.  Oh_ I forgot to mention 2 weeks after last dose developed sensitive hearing to the point that I could hear the back of the TV when noone else could.  No showers_ running water hurt my ears_ and heaven forbid anyone drop something_ it would kill my ears.  During that week of hyperacousis I just wanted to lay down and die.  Still hoping this noise goes away starting to let up a little.  I have good days and bad days and hyperacousi,Warn everyone you know to research this drug before taking it.

Went to MD the next day when pain and redness got worse. MD said I had an oral yeast infection and prescribed Nystatin. I've NEVER had any yeast infection in my life.,I never had any side effects with other meds. The back of mouth looks disgusting.

The side effects of this medication were worse than the condition I was being treated for.  I'm still not over my sinus infection_ and I have an upcoming doctor's appointment to discuss what this medication has done to me.  I haven't felt the same since taking it_ and I'm worried that I may have suffered an adverse reaction to it.  After doing some research into the background of this drug_ I came to the conclusion that this is pretty powerful stuff_ and I would give serious consideration and weigh the risks before agreeing to take it for ANY reason.  I definitely ruled this one off my list of antibiotics_ and I usually tolerate these drugs VERY well. It's interesting to read all these other comments_ and just how many of us have experienced the same thing.  As far as I'm concerned_ this medication should be immediately reviewed by the FDA for its safety margin_ and for risks of developing serious drug complications(especially if you have a liver disorder).,M,47,5  days,3/26/2007,Zithromax
888, 1, Sinusitis,abdominal cramping_ gas_ bloating_ diarrhea_ nausea_ ringing in the ears_ rapid heart rate.,I was prescribed the 5 day Z-pack. The first day_ I took the first dose (2 pills) and had no side effects. I was also eating LOTS of yogurt and taking acidophilus after ever meal to help with the side effects. I have NEVER experienced serious side effects when taking an antibiotic_ so I was surprised when on the second day_ after taking the second dose_ I experienced severe abdominal cramping and diarrhea. I also had ringing in the ears and a rapid heart beat about 4 to 5 hours after taking the second dose. I quit taking the antibiotic. I would rather deal with the sinus infection than these horrible side effects. It's not worth it! It's been 3 days since my last dose_ and I still have ringing in the ears. Because of the ringing_ I am having a very hard time concentrating and getting to sleep. My sinusitis has cleared up somewhat_ but I wish I would have just taken amoxicillin.

The morning of the fourth day (I was taking the medication in the evenings)_ I had a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain_ cramping_ and diarrhea --it's a good thing I was home at the time.  I only experienced the one bout of diarrhea_ but the pain and cramping lasted for two days; the first night the pain was so bad I considered going to the ER.  During those two days_ any food I ate other than dry toast upset my stomach.  It's the fourth day now_ and although my stomach is still unsettled it's not nearly as bad as it was; at the same time_ I have eaten only bland foods today: oatmeal and banana.  I stopped taking the medication when I started having the abdominal/intestinal problems (i.e._ I only took it for three of the five days I was supposed to) and I will never take it again.

891, 2, bronchitis- pneumonia,I was told by pharmacist to eat something when taking this.  I have irritable bowel and many things can really tear up my tummy.  I ate a piece of toast_ then took the one mega dose (2000 mg) of the liquid Zmax.  I still suffered a mild nausea in which I ate some crackers and went to sleep.  I was okay the next morning and I never vomited.,This medicine really did nothing for my pneumonia nor bronchitis.  It was not able to kill the bacteria that I was experiencing. The liquid dose is supposed to last several days_ but it really did not work.  Maybe if I had taken the medicine over a longer period of time.  The liquid is just to drink the whole bottle and then it is supposed to work.  Unfortunately_ it did not.  Omnicef finally got it along with a shot and 3 days of steroid.

893, 3, viral and sinus infection &pink eye,within a few hours I had major diarhea and thought it was because of the viral infection. I have been on it four days and four times already I have been hit with instantaneous diarhea to the point I did not make it to the bathroom in time. I had nausea and a headache starting from one temple across my forehead to the other and it didn't slack up and I had it all day and couldn't hardly lift my head. Got out of bed only for my frequent trips to the john.,It apparently cleared up my sinus and viral infection within a couple days_ but I am to take two pills a day for ten days.  I am afraid now to continue after reading all the comments made about the drug.  If it weren't for the side affects it would be a great. It was hard to rate because it has solved the problem I originally went to the doctor for_ but it gave me a butte of a problem that I am going to have to deal with when I return to work. I have been off work already five days and I really don't want any accidents at work like the ones I have had this week.,F,54,4  days,3/10/2007,Zithromax
894, 5, respiratory infection,I threw up within one hour of taking it and had some stomach cramps after that.  The second day I ate before taking it and only had mild cramps and nausea.  I've also had some diarhea_ not too bad_ but it is green.,The only side effect I wasn't warned about was the green stool_ and that's not really a problem_ just weird.  The drug cleared/minimized my symptoms by the second day (of the 5 day dose).  The side effects were worth it due to the severity of my symptoms but I probably wouldn't take for more mild illness (I have taken it for pneumonia).  This is a powerful drug:READ THE WARNING LABELS if you're not sick enough for the side effects to be worth it_ don't take it (this is true of any drug_ you are the ultimate gatekeeper to your own health).,F,27,3  days,3/8/2007Email,Zithromax

This is now two years down the road with no improvement.,This antibiotic did so much damage to my digestive tract that I can no longer digest foods properly. Ive been to several specialists and there seems to be very little that can be done; other than a total diet change. I know of three other people (unrelated to me) who have taken zithromax and developed similar problem. The worst part about this is that the doctor misperscibed this for a viral infection.

Today is day 2 out of a 5 day treatment_ and I don't know whether this is a side effect of Zithromax_ Strep Throat_ or maybe I developed something else along with the Strep_ but I woke up this morning with [it's gross so beware] bloody_ green_ and gross lumps in my nose and throat_ every time I cough up phlegm or blow my nose. [I warned you it was gross],Azithromycin (zithromax) was the only thing that helped!On day one of my sore throat and nose/throat congestion_ I thought it was just a common cold_ so I took some Nyquil_ Ibuprofen_ and Chloraseptic. On day two_ I developed a 104 degree fever_ I could hardly swallow_ and I had the chills (while still working at a daycare) so I added Aspirin_ Throat Lozenges_ Hydrogen Peroxide (for my ears because I had earaches)_ and Sudafed to my daily regimen. I woke up on the third day and went to work_ and not only were all the symptoms from the previous days present_ but they were worse. On the third day_ I could hardly even speak without sounding like a deaf person because speaking scratched on my throat which caused great pain and to swallow hurt beyond belief. So on my lunch break on the third day I went to the doctors where they took my temperature (101 degrees) and did a strep test (throat swab = gag!) which obviously resulted in a positive reading.

It came on very suddenly_ just like the nausea and vomiting. I usually take medication pretty well_ but this one...gosh. I don't recommend it for anyone.

These all appeared on day 3 of treatment.  I also experienced some tightness in my chest and brief feelings of lightheadedness and ""passing out""_ as well as fatigue and lethargy.  I also noticed some mild vertigo_ loss of appetite_ low libido_ and a dry_ hacking cough(which may or may not have been related to the sinusitis or drug itself).

950, 3, upper respritory infection,well I had taken this medication many times before but the last 2 times I was prescribed it the pharmacy gave me generic_ took only took 3 pills made me feel very dizzy_ lightheaded_ agitated and shakey intestinal pains and gas although I was feeling better with my URI the side affects were too much to bear I had trouble functioning during the day.,Maybe the generic versus the name brand has a different chemical makeup?  dont think I will take it again!,F,42,3  days,8/9/2006Email,Zithromax
951, 1, sore throat,Unbearable stomach pains. Rash on palms and sole of feet. Two trips to emergency with side pain. Admitted to local hospital by family doctor with spleen bleed. Five days later ambulance ride to Mayo. Zithromax caused bleeding disorder_ inhibitor to Factor V necessary for clotting. Doctors didn't believe me when I said it was the zithromax. They were sure it was cancer. Half a dozen cat scans_ hundreds of blood draws and thousands of dollars later: guess what?-It was the zithromax!!!,I'll never take this whole family of drugs again.,F,,5  days,8/5/2006,Zithromax

954, 1, bacterial infection,While taking: lost all appetite_dizziness_ confusion_ and basically unable to wake up---it was like being in a five day coma.After completing Z-Pack: chest pains_ racing heart_ anxiety_ depression.,Thanks to Zithromax I lost 3 months of work due to all of the tests I had to see what was wrong with me---only to find out it was caused by my course of this antibiotic! Had to endure a 24 hour halter cardiac monitor so the doctor could find out why I was having chest pains and atrial fibrillation. The verdict: zithromax! I went from being unable to stay awake for more than an hour at a time while taking the Z-Pack to being completely unable to sleep after the course was completed. Then I had anxiety so bad any noise would make me jump. Just the phone ringing would cause my heart to start racing! I would much rather have the illness I took this medication for than ever take Zithromax again. As a nurse I'd highly recomend avoiding ANY antibiotic that delivers 10 days worth of medication into your system in 5 days time. It's better to wait longer for the cure than to be stuck with a double dose of the medication in your system if you start to experience side effects.

Too tired for my demanding sales job. Some agitation also. The medicine_ combined with Nasonex_ has made me feel as if I am well. Nasal congestin cleared immediately but still sound_ when speaking_ as if I am stuffed up. The overwhelming fatique_ has been the only problem I can't handle well_ but I only have one more day to be on this med. Feel as if I cannot even think straight.

Anything I eat or drink turns to much and I get the urge to make a Bowel movement which exits very soft_ mushy_ and furry looking.

Now_ (three days after last dose)_ I CANNOT stop scratching my entire body.  I have never experienced itching like this_ except in local areas where I have had poison oak.  But now I have the intense itching EVERYWHERE_ including palms of hands_ soles of feet_ and places I cannot scratch in public.  The only relief comes from ice packs and taking enough Benadryl to pass out.  The mild side effects were dry mouth and slightly loose stool (which turned into Wicked constipation after taking the last dose).  But that was nothing compared to this itching.  I've been sobbing all morning_ and am taking myself to the doctor rather than going in to work.,I was prescribed the generic version of the five-day pack after two weeks of horrid coughing and nasty green phlegm/snot.

More side affects possible_ strep is gone_ hives increase (raised and red) Didn't want him to be subjected to more so I went on line and searched out natural remedies. Found a product called Lacitrex. Lacitrex.com Lacitrex is for the hives. Ordered it and there are no side affects. 100% guarantee. We are a family that rarely uses antibiotics or drugs.  We use homeopathy and alternative methods. This was an exception.  This drug should be removed from the market. Too many side affects and could be deadly.

The doctors there said I was NOT having an allergic reaction_ although I MAY be having some side effects from the zithro because I also took some period pain medication that contained aspirin_ acetomeniphine and caffeine in it.  Apparently caffeine and zithro doesn't mix so well for some people (not on warning label).  They refused to give me an alternate antibiotic_ so I'm still taking zithro (unless I want a serious kidney infection)_ and I'm feeling ok.  Upon doing more research I learned some things.

Mild stomach cramps.,I had ringing in my ears before taking the z-pack supposedly from the ear infection.  But as the ringing just got louder and louder to the point I was not hearing well_ I looked up side effects.  My skin just gets worse no matter how much lotion I use.  Everything has pretty much cleared up except for my throat.  The pain is more tolerable but still there.  Hopefully the side effects will fade soon since I just took day five.  Also_ was never told to not take it with antacid until I saw it on the Internet.  Does that include Prilosec?  And totally forgot about the effect it has on oral contraceptives...uh oh.,F,35,5  days,10/19/2005,Zithromax

I wish they'd started me on Zithromax -- Amoxi did nothing at all and just delayed my recovery long enough for me to pull some rib cage muscles from coughing.

I haven't made it to day 2 yet_ but it should be interesting.  I am definitely not taking it at work.The worst part is that I called the nurse practitioner at my doctor's office and they said they never heard of anyone getting these symptoms this quickly and I see others having the same problems after 1 hour.  Did you ever here of the Internet nurse knucklehead?,It did clear up my bronchitis fairly quickly or at least stopped my uncontrolable coughing.  Although_ then again_ who knows_ I just may not have noticed since it was coming out the other end.,M,32,5  days,8/11/2005,Zithromax
1036, 3, bacterial infection,i don't recall having any side effects while on the 5 day pack and i do remember feeling much better within a very short time frame.  however_ a week or so after i was finished with the pills it looked like someone took a baseball bat to my shens.  they were bruised badly_ swollen_ the skin was taunt and thin and i could barely walk from all the pain for about 2 weeks.,both my doctor and i didn't know if it was the z-pack or the infection that caused the burst surface capillaries in my shens (this is why i am giving it a three and not a lower or higher number)_ but i'd rather not experiment and find out by taking it again.  however_ i've spoken to a lot of people about it_ and most seem to have few problems with it.,F,22,5  days,8/11/2005,Zithromax

I wanted to smack the doctor who gave me 5 pills to take at once after misdiagnosing my condition. I ended up not having an infection at all and taking this awful antibiotic for nothing!,Worst antibioltic ever! Esp if taken in a horse dose such as prescribed by my doctor. BE VERY CAREFUL taking 4 or more pills at once because they are BRUTAL! Don't end up like me! My liver tests came back abnormal after taking it and normalized a couple of months later. I am SO glad there was no permanent damage. I will NEVER EVER take this medicine again!,F,23,1  days,8/3/2005,Zithromax
1039, 5, Chest Infection & Pnemonia,Sore stomach 1st day_ nothing after that. Just a cure.,Had cough for 6 weeks after working in a very dusty area. Couldn't sleep_ head congestion too. I thought it was viral_ but it never cured_ so went to Dr. who ordered a chest Xray that showed pnemonia. The Z-pack cured 99 percent of symptoms in 5 days_ they say it carries over for a few more days. I'm actually just taking day 5 pill today. I think the dusty area had dried rat droppings or other bio-hazards_ that I unfortunately inhaled. Watch out for bird droppings_ rat droppings_ and dried urine. Bad news.,M,59,5  days,7/29/2005,Zithromax

I finally fell back asleep_ and woke up 2 hours later covered in sweat. i've been monitoring my temp_ but it hasn't been over 98.6.  Today has been ok. In 24 hours_ my cough has improved_ and sinus pressure lessened. I've been sleeping A LOT by choice_ but I'm also tired and weak. I still have mild stomach pain and diarrea. I'm about to take the second pill_ and have fingers crossed that side effects won't worsen.

Day 3 of the 3 day Rx I was wiped out_ could not stay awake. Took a 5 hour nap!,Four weeks after taking the 3-dose Rx of Zithromax_ traveling strong/annoying body aches_ low fever_ blah-ness_ occasional dizziness_ blurred vision_ stomach cramps_itchy/crawly skin_ shingles-like itch/burn on stomach area_ insomnia and an upset stomach following all meals are (rotating) daily experiences. NEVER will I take this again. All this_ and I still have a lingering cough (the original complaint and why the Zith was prescribed). HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST? IS THERE ANY THING TO COUNTER THE MISERY THE ZITHROMAX HAS CAUSED?,F,53,3  days,7/8/2005,Zithromax
1047, 1, broncitis,Chronic outbreaks of shingles and herpes,Four of my family members have suffered from severe side effects_ which seem to involve the breakdown of the bodys immune system to fight off nerve related viral diseases_ such as shingles_ and herpes.  All of us had been prescribed zithromax (z-pack) to fight off bronchitis_ strep_ or sinus infections_ which the drug was somewhat successful in resolving_ but not always; however_ about a week or so after completing the dosage of five days_ we began to suffer severe oral herpes outbreaks.  In three of the cases_ there were severely painful outbreaks of shingles.My doctor no longer prescribes it mostly as a result to similar complaints like those stated on this board.For our problems_ the doctors only seem to want to treat the symptoms of herpes and shingles_ and have not made this connection as being a side-effect of zithromax (z-pack) and a breakdown in the immune system.  We were prescribed Zoverax_ which was worthless_ then switched to Valtrex_ which had some effect_ but only short-term relief.  It was not until we received another anti-biotic that our immune systems stabilized against outbreaks of herpes and shingles.  This makes no sense and most doctors argue to no end that antibiotics do not help with these viral diseases such in the control of herpes and shingles; but in our case it did.  The three antibiotics that seem to provide some relief to the side effects of zithromax (z-pack) were Bactrim DS_ PCE_ and Biaxon.  Never again will I take Z-pack.,M,37,5  days,7/1/2005,Zithromax

Some difficulty controlling asthma in spite of the fact that this time the bronchitis was mild. This last problem is worse at night. During the day i feel fine. Probably will switch off Zithromax next time. DOn't want the side effects to worsen as it seems to be doing. The stomach pain and mild diarrhea were on day 1 only. Sweats have appeared on day 3. Still some mild symptoms of bronchitis which usually disappear after day 1-2.,M,36,3  days,6/1/2005Email,Zithromax

1055, 3, Ear Infection,None that I noticed.,After the first two days I was feeling a lot better_ by day 10 I was fine and pain free..By day 13 the ear infection had returned and was as painful as ever. Seems to me that this drug is pretty effective with some infections but everyone I've spoken to who was treated for an ear infection ended up with a bounce back infection..I'd probably try this drug again but not for another ear infection.,F,31,5  days,5/27/2005,Zithromax
1056, 2, Upper respiratory infec./bronchitis,2 days after taking my last dose I've expierienced the worst case of dizziness_ disorientation and fatigue ever in my life! 7 days later I have gotten worse adding nausea to the list. I cannot function on a normal basis. Cannot think clearly_ always too dizzy. Probably could not pass a field sobriety test.,Will never take this drug again. It got rid of my illness_ but gave me another. I think I prefer to have the upper respiratory infection with bronchitis.,F,36,5  days,5/27/2005Email,Zithromax
1057, 4, Respiratory infection,Stomach cramps and abdominal pain in front and back. Kind of alarming at first since I have kidney problems and thought I was having an episode. Moderate diarrea major_ sweats and low grade fever_ slight dizziness and muscle aches.,Weird_  I have taken this before and never had any side effects.  The symptoms of my infection were gone within hours of taking the first 2 pills_ but my stomach was girgling out of control.,F,39,3  days,5/25/2005,Zithromax

1059, 2, SINUS INFECTION AFTER A COLD,NONE,I had a persistent and troublesome  cough from  a sinus drip into the throat after a cold. Family doctor prescribed Zithromax as there appeared to be  some infection.[yellow-green mucous ]Symptoms cleared somewhat after 10 days but cough contined and got worse there after. It seemed that the drug was in effective as the symptoms returned after taking the drug.. Currently taking amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.,M,67,5  days,5/23/2005,Zithromax
1060, 2, Sinus Infection,SEVERE stomache cramps_ nausea_ and diahrrea. Wish I'd been clued in with the side effects_ the cramps were really scary and set on fast.,An hour after taking the first dose with food I got nauseous and then SEVERE stomache cramps_ I didn't think I could drive home from the restraunt.  Slight_ diahrrea but nothing too bad yet_ however I have not eaten since taking the pill.  Cramps have continued since then_ but not coming as rapidly_ still painfull enough to double you over though.  I'm only on day 2 with the meds so I hope this goes away soon.  Pepto-bismol does nothing to help the cramps_ it only makes your poo black.  On the upside my sore throat is almost completely cleared up and it hasn't even been 24 hours yet.  Cough still around_ but I think the congestion in my chest is clearing up as well.,F,21,2  days,5/17/2005,Zithromax
1061, 3, Sinus Infection,Intense nausea_ stomach pain and loss of appetite.  Within 1 to 2 hours after taking the medicine_ I felt very nauseous and thought I would throw up.  However_ I never actually vomitted.  Sleeping was difficult_ because my stomach pain kept me awake.,I have taken the Z-pack 4 or 5 times before this and NEVER had any negative side effects whatsoever.  I don't know what is different this time_ but my first instinct is to blame a bad batch/lot of the medication.  Also_ my infection has not improved.  What was just a sinus infection has now migrated into my lungs such that I am coughing up copious thick_ green mucus and nearly choking on the junk when I try to clear my bronchial tubes.

I was prescribed Zithromax after asking for Biaxin 500mg. I know for a fact that Biaxin will get me well but this doctor insisted that I use the Z-pack. It's a 5 day treatment with 2 pills the first day. I also took a shot of cortisone and something else. Today is my second day and I don't feel any better than yesterday. I am still coughing horribly. But_ at least the phlegm is breaking up and coming out. I guess that means it's working. I still don't see how a 5 day treament of 250mg Zithromax is going to make me better when I am used to taking Biaxin 500mg for Bronchitis. I rated this medecine a 2 because I don't see any change in my condition.
