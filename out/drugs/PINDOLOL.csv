0, 4, dysautonomia/tachycardia,during my first couple of months_ i had ringing in my ears. very slight dizziness and a shaky feeling as the day wears on and the drug tapers off--it's not a drug that lasts long.,"i like the fact it has very few side effects_ and you can bear the ones it does have. it is predictable as far as learning how long it takes to kick in each day_ when you will be at your strongest with it_ etc. no surprises. it does wear off after 8 to 10 hours and leave a feeling of slight ""inner trembling."" taking an additional_ low level second daily dose would probably help this.",F,34,3  years,9/6/2007Email,Pindolol
