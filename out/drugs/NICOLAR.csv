1, 5, High cholesterol,Facial flushing. Was rather uncomfortable. Regularly spraying myself in the face with a spray-bottle full of water whenever it got to be too much seemed to counter-act this sufficiently.,I was on 250 mg daily_ after my mother took the stuff and had a positive experience. This seriously worked. In conjunction with some prescription medication changes and some minor life-style and dietary adjustments_ my total cholesterol went down from over 200 down to 116. My mid-30s HDL stayed about the same_ although now it is up to 43. I am currently down to 120 mg of niacin a day (100 mg as part of a B-complex multivitamin and 20 mg from a daily Centrum)_ and my cholesterol is still good. I highly recommend you give niacin a try. It's cheap_ effective_ and over the counter_ and while the flushing to the face is uncomfortable it's not unbearable. I do recommend you take it with food though.,M,29,2.5  years,10/21/2006,Nicolar
