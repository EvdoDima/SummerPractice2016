0, 3, Tonsillitis,Severe insomnia_ night sweats_ increased urination_ increased hunger_ anxiety_ agitation,I have taken the Medrol dose pack before in combination with antibiotics for a severe upper respiratory infection including the inner ear.  That time_ I powered through the horrible side effects and finished the pack because it was a lingering infection affecting my hearing.  This time_ I stopped taking it on day 2!  The side effects far outweighed the benefits for me because_ again_ I was taking the Medrol dose pack in combination with antibiotics.  I also have fibromyalgia and arthritis and the steroids make my body feel spectacular musculoskeletally but neurologically I had a plethora of negative symptoms that were too uncomfortable to ignore.  Ask your doctor if you REALLY need a steroid.  I am a certified pharmacy technician and feel that the Medrol dose pack is a go to along with antibiotics for pretty much everything these days.  It seems like one can't be accompanied without the other.  I've seen in prescribed for URIs of all types_ in combination with allopurinol and/or colcrys for gout_ etc...  Not recommended unless you MUST!,F,36,6  daysdose pack 1X D,2/6/2016,Methylprednisolone

Had multiple surgeries that I expected to be flat on my back for days from.  This medication gave me unexpected energy and strength the first week.  Then_ the beginning of the second week the negative side effects hit me hard and fast.  As soon as I was done with the 5 day treatment I woke up with severe suicidal depression for about a week followed by a constant 24/7 extreme anxiety disorder for another 5 - 6 weeks after that.  I lost 20 lbs. in one month due to the high anxiety level.  It did finally start to level off after the 6th week but if you don't know how this medication will affect you then take it with extreme caution.  I have been tested for genetic polymorphisms that are known to affect behavior which resulted in three clinically significant results for me personally which can cause or make one susceptible to diso,,F,44,6  days4 mg. 5X D,6/29/2014,Methylprednisolone
