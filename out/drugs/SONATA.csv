0, 3, Insomnia,Major headache with 1st pill_ day 2 no side effects beyond blurred vision.,I just started these meds after being prescribed Xanax for years. Tired of waking up feeling like I got hit by a truck_ decided to try these. Day one got ZERO sleep at all_ felt nothing. But that could be the result of having taken my Adderall at 3pm_ which is late for me. Day 2 I decided to take two- MUCH better. Will be crashing as soon as I type this review. I'll follow up in a week with update. ,F,40,2  days,2/18/2016,Sonata
1, 1, insomnia,I have anxiety disorder and was having a lot of anxiety - I was having trouble sleeping and took sonata - I fell asleep ok but I woke up at 4am and couldn't go back to sleep! I also had increased anxiety_ agitation_ difficulty concentrating and depression.,This drug should NEVER be prescribed to someone who has anxiety!!!,F,47,5  days10 1X D,2/6/2016,Sonata
2, 3, Insomnia,Fuzzy head_ double vision_ eating food and buying things on the Internet without remembering anything about it!  Scared me but nothing serious except spent some money and gained a few lb's.  At times I did have a feeling of general overall wellbeing.,It did get me to sleep most every time for at least half the night. Short lived_ but does not have lasting side affects other than some moderate anxiety durning the day.  Loses affect over time. Sometimes I have to take 40 MG to get to sleep.,M,47,2  years20MG 1X D,1/17/2016Email,Sonata
3, 1, Insomnia& awakening after a few hrs,Sleeplessness_ anxiety_ racing thoughts_ feeling jittery and wired_ stomach pains_ sweating and hot/cold sweats,I had been taking Ambien for years and was used to getting a full nights sleep because of it. All of the sudden it stopped being so effective for me. I would awaken after only 3 hours of sleep. Dr switched be to Sonata. I expected it to work in the same manner. (Fall asleep quickly) NO SUCH LUCK. I took this medication and experienced the worst night of my life! I didn't sleep AT ALL! I mean none! I felt wired and anxious and sleepy but couldn't even doze off for a short period. Then I started sweating and shaking and had extreme stomach cramping. I literally laid in bed for 7 hours feeling like I was losing my mind! I would rather get 3 hours of sleep on Ambien.,F,39,1  days10mg 1X D,11/24/2015Email,Sonata
4, 1, Insomnia,Horrific tinnitus. Brain fog.,I was prescribed this medication at Mayo clinic for my severe insomnia. On the second night after taking it_ I developed severe ringing in the earsÂ… Horrific buzzing sound. I have had it every night since then. Two nights  ago I stopped taking it_ and now miraculously the sound is gone. It also caused severe next day drowsiness_ brain fog and general feeling of being unwell. I have barely been able to function for the last few months on this horrible drug. Although it is advertised as having a short half-life_ in me the effects last up to 18 1/2 hours.,F,50,4  months5 mg,11/8/2015,Sonata
5, 4, Insomnia,Easily influenced; insomnia; memory loss,I've taken it for many years_ so obviously the pros outweigh the cons.  Generally_ it puts me right to sleep and I have no grogginess in the morning.  I learned that I have to be in bed_ and ready to go to sleep immediately_ before taking it.  If not_ I would do things that I would not normally do.  I would convince myself that it was a good idea to buy whatever they were selling on TV.  I had conversations with my daughter that I do not recall.  I absolutely HAD to eat something.  It was an occurrence last night that frightened me_ but it was because I took it and then started looking at some things on the Internet instead of turning out the light and preparing to fall asleep.  Apparently_ I got up_ got dressed and drove to the grocery store at 12:30 a.m.  I made several purchases_ drove home_ put everything away and then must have gone to bed.  I was surprised in the morning when I got up and was checking my bank account and saw a charge to the grocery store.  I thought someone had stolen my debit card.  I got up and went to the kitchen and discovered it was me.   I have NEVER had anything this serious happen to me as a result of the Sonata.  A review of this website is a relief since it appears that it was the Sonata and not me having a nervous breakdown.  It may be time for a break from it.   I'm sure I'll need some type of sleep aid since I have always had a difficult time falling asleep.  So_ I will take precautions like giving my keys to my daughter to hide at nigh,F,54,10  years10 mg 1X D,8/16/2015Email,Sonata
6, 3, Trouble falling asleep,Hallucinations,I made the mistake of staying up on Sonata in order to spend time with my significant other and I had the strangest yet most wonderful hallucinations. I actually quite enjoyed it_ it felt like the universe opened up and shined its light upon me_ I felt as if I had taken a bite of the forbidden fruit and gained the knowledge of all. I then proceeded to have wonderful sex with my partner and it was quite lovely. I felt as if we were in the midst of a forest on a fall evening and I heard the whisperings of magical creatures of the woods all around us.  After that and after he fell asleep_ i created some absolutely wicked art pieces. It didn't put me out but I gained even greater sex and my long since dead and dried out creativity. That's a fine trade.,F,23,1  days,7/14/2015,Sonata
7, 4, insomnia_ not staying asleep at night,sleepwalking_ memory lapses_ difficulty concentrating,The reason I gave this a high rating is because it does actually make me sleep. Not quality sleep by any means_ but before sonata i got maybe 4 hours of sleep a week_ if I was lucky. That being said_ waking up in front of the coffeemaker at 4am drinking old coffee from the pot is a little disconcerting. My biggest problem with sonata is that my adhd medication negates its effects_ and recently I have been getting no sleep at all because my other meds keep me up. TL;DR it might not work with your other meds and it might make you do weird stuff.,M,16,2  months 1X D,6/20/2015,Sonata
8, 1, Insomnia_ Anxiety,Hallucinations_ energy,I took it at 1 this morning_ and I'm now writing this at 6 am. Tired? No no no. But man_ have I been tripping balls! It started with my phone feeling weird_ like the case was crumpled cheap tin foil. Texting became a challenge. First the buttons became hard to press and would stick. I have an iPhone. Then the words on the screen decided to show off them moves like jagger and formed a conga line. Then I was transported to the titanic as it was sinking_ because my spring matress turned into a waterbed. Sensations WERENT the only form of hallucinations either. I'm assuming math hates me as much as I hated it_ because geometric shapes flew at me_ hovered around me_ and just stares at me. I got a special guest apparance hailing all the way from gnomes lair in south park_ Colorado_ the underwear gnomes! They've seem to have refined their tastes though_ as they tried to pull the blanket off of the bed and take it. Once they saw themselves out_ the Wild Wild west decided to swing on by unannounced. Tiny toy horses everywhere. Now don't get me wrong_ sonata isn't all bad_ it's slightly magical. It has the magical ability to make all technology 3D. My iPhone_ kindle_ Macbook_ even my ancient tubular TV that was all the rage back in the 90s. Apple may have invented retnia display_ but Steve Jobs MUST be rolling over in his grave because of king pharmaceuticals stroke of genius. 3D AND YOU DONT NEED GLASSES?! It's 2015_ it's about time.

10, 3, Insomnia due to severe anxiety,My therapist told me to be near a bed when I decided to take the medicine. So for the first night I did as I was told but it took forever to fall asleep. The 2nd_ 3rd_ and 4th night I would fall asleep within in hour of taking the meds. So I'd say the medicine improved for me. However_ on the fifth night I started hallucinating. I saw colors that flew in the air when you waved a flash light. I could barely stay on my feet and I was so dizzy.

I have found that 10 mg will keep me asleep.   I am able to sleep for 8 hours straight.  I have not experienced any side effects and awake feeling rested with no 'hangover' feeling.

39, 4, Insomnia,Loved it the first year -- worked extremely quickly for taking with middle-of-the-night awakenings so I got back to sleep.  But it has lost all effectiveness now.  I have to take 10-20 mg and only lasts 2-3 hours.  I end up taking my whole 30 day supply in a few nights and am still up several times per night. I even wondered if the last few bottles were placebos....sometimes I would take 2-3 pills over an hour and still be awake.  Loss all effectiveness for me.,I never had side effects with Sonata_ but horrid ones with Ambien_ Ambien CR and Lunesta:  night wandering with total amnesia_ cooking and eating with no memeory.  Woke up one time in bed with a grilled cheese sandwich and had left the stove on downstairs. Even gained weight from pigging out at 3 AM in bed without knowing it (except for the mess!)

Ambien and Ambien CR both did nothing for me. I was on Seroquel for a year_ and boy does it put you to sleep. A deep_ long_ sleep. I can easily sleep a solid 12+ hours when I take it. I also gained 40lbs taking it. Next! My doctor gave me Sonata (the only other one my insurance will pay for). It's erratic. Somenights I fall right to sleep_ and wake up 8 hours later just fine. Other nights_ it's like I did not take anything and end up awake the entire night. THE HALLUCINATIONS: Boy am I glad I found this board and see it happens to other people too! I thought I was losing it. They are not scary_ just funny and interesting. Graphics and texts on my computer will wave like a flag_ or look 3D_ or melt. Sometimes I will be reading something_ and the voice in my head that is reading it changes from my regular voice to almost a cartoon voice. Weird stuff man.

53, 4, Early awakening,I take Sonata between 2:00 am and 4:00 am if I have woken and can't get back to sleep. In the mornings I sometimes experience lethargy lasting a few hours_ and lapses of memory. Usually Sonata DOES promote sleep (not always). Sometimes the quality of sleep with Sonata is not good and occasionally it gives me bizarre_ unpleasant dreams.,The trick with Sonata is not to take it too often. I try not to take it two nights running. It usually helps me to get back to sleep after early awakening_ but the level of sleep may not be restful. The scary thing about this drug any any other sleep aid is the memory lapses. Is this occuring naturally because of my age? I don't think so. This has frightened me a little_ and I take Sonata as little as possible. One other thing to consider: Alcohol will cause early awakening. Attend to that before resorting to Sonata.That said_ I wouldn't be without it when I actually need. Hence the 4/5 rating. To sum up: Use it sparsely.,M,70,4  years,1/19/2008,Sonata

I was constantly waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning and not able to go back to sleep until 5 or 6_ just before I had to get up and get kids to school! I was unable to exercise because I was so tired all the time_ and felt terrible_ almost falling asleep while driving in the afternoons before starting this!  It has made me feel human again!,F,46,2  months,12/7/2007Email,Sonata
57, 5, Insomnia (trouble falling asleep),None.,I was prescribed Ambien_ but Ambien knocks me out for 7 hours. I only take it on nights I have insomnia_ and some nights_ I don't realize I need extra drugs to fall asleep until I only have 4 or 5 hours left. This is why I like Sonata better. It gets me to sleep almost as well as Ambien does_ and then I can wake up 4 hours later. I don't feel like it's quite as strong as Ambien-- I had both at one point and used Ambien on the nights I had adderall in my system and seriously needed to sleep. Sonata_ however_ is perfect for that unexpected insomnia.,F,23,3  weeks,12/5/2007,Sonata
58, 4, Early wake up.,None,"When I wake up_ usually between 2-3AM_ I take 5mg and sleep another 2-3 hours_ which is what I need. Take 5-7 nights a week. No side effects or ""hangover."" Have tried all the other sleep aids_ only  regular Ambien was effective. Ambien CR did not seem to work.",M,67,1  days,9/9/2007,Sonata
59, 3, Anxiety/Depression-Related Insomnia,Minor hallucinations on more than one occasion_ dizziness_ and paresthesia.,This medication did make me feel drowsy and shortened the time it takes me to fall asleep. However_ I had minor hallucinations each and every night I took it_ as if I was dreaming while I was still awake. Along with the other side effects_ this convinced me to stop after just three nights.,F,19,3  days,9/3/2007,Sonata
60, 3, insomnia_ waking too early,One minor hallucination,Much less problems than Lunesta and if it doesn't work_ it's largely out of your system in 2 or 3 hours. It works best on an empty stomach and a relaxed mind-set that doesn't try to fight it. If you fight it and stay awake you *may* experience the hallucinations many have mentioned here. This only happened to me once and it was not a horrible experience for me (semi-amusing_ actually). Stops working if I take a lot of it (every night or more than one day_ like one for night and one the next day for a nap).,F,32,1  years,8/11/2007,Sonata
61, 5, mild insomnia,No side effects of any kind except for slight forgetfulness.,I have been taking Sonata for 4 years.  At first just occasionally but for the past 2 or 3 years almost every night.  I fall asleep easily but wake up every night at 3 or 4am and then take 10 mg. I fall back to sleep and usually get at least 8 hours every night.  Although it is still working fine for me_ it is expensive and I am thinking seriously about weaning myself off of it.,F,55,3  years,7/28/2007,Sonata
62, 2, Difficulty getting to sleep,See comments,"Sonata is good for a contained period of difficulty in going to sleep.  It has a very short ""half-life"" and is out of your system in about four - five hours. However_ for me_ it lost effectiveness rather quickly after a few weeks of taking it.  I started with 10 MG and after a several weeks of on and off again use_ the 10 MG dose had lost all effect.  I would have to bump it up to 20 MG to force my brain/body to go to sleep.  I even had to go up to 30 MG a few nights to have any effect.  I have stopped taking now as it is useless.  If you do have to go up in dosage_ watch out for extreme stupor and sluggishness if you have to get up to go to the bathroom after going to bed.  I have switched to occasional use of AMBIEN CR for now.",M,45,3  months,7/28/2007,Sonata
63, 4, insomnia (waking after 2-3 hrs.),Tried sonata after having very bad time with rozerem (horrible side effects the following day). Didn't feel any side effects with sonata at all_ but med did not help much with the insomnia.,Rating of 4 is for a combination of sonata & another med:  Sonata did help relax me_ and seem to help reduce restless legs episodes but was not keeping me asleep for the 4 hours suggested. Would wake after 2-3 hours_ and then just doze off & on rest of night. I am now taking sonata with a low dose of trazodone (antidepressant_ 50 mg) This combination seems to be working-though I still seem to wake up after just a few hours now I go back to sleep for at least an hour at a time_ instead of waking up every 10-20 minutes. Also_ having dreams now-not nightmares_ just normal/goofy dreams. (Haven't had dreams I was aware of for several years_ so this has been very interesting!),F,50,15  days,7/10/2007,Sonata

65, 4, chronic insomnia,No side effects after 90 days!  Least intrusive sleep aid I've used.,Too bad it's only meant to work short term - approx. 4 hours.  I sometimes take awhile to fall asleep (45 minutes)_ but I've had no side effects at all.  In the beginning_ I was also using CPAP for sleep apnea.  If Sonata worked for 8 hours_ it would be perfect!,F,64,90  days,6/11/2007,Sonata
66, 3, Insomnia,Have a hard time waking up,Sonata_ like the other sleep medications I've tried_ ambien_ lunesta_ etc didn't help me fall to sleep_ it just keeps me from waking up the next day.

73, 5, Insomnia,I take 10mg before bed_ works well_ very mild. I try not to take it for more than 3 nights_ then take a night or two off_ so that it doesn't lose its effectiveness_ and to limit my withdrawal symptoms. Sometimes it's hard to get to sleep on those off-nights_ but Sonata is habit-forming and I don't want the symptoms to get severe.,,M,58,5  years,2/21/2007,Sonata
74, 5, Early Morning Awakenings,Nothing I would consider undesirable. You go into the ozone about 10-15 minutes after taking and you remember nothing while you are sleeping. In fact you could swear you never slept at all... but it is several hours later.,After several months of continuous use_ 10mg only equates to 1.5 or 2 hrs sleep. I still use it for my early morning awakenings at 3_ 4 or 5 a.m._ but sometimes I have to take another to get me to the desired wake-up times. I may try taking 20mg (2 pills) and see if that gets me 4 hours like it used to. I like the way I get back to sleep with Sonata. Even though I've grown tolerant to its full effect_ it will always get me to sleep for at least awhile. I always feel good when I wake up too. No ill effects,F,51,9  months,1/24/2007Email,Sonata

I experienced a little bit of unessecary anger while I was on the phone with a friend and I told her ""This stuff isn't working I'm not even tired"" It was dark in my room and I ended up staring into my phone's screen which lit up the room.. I stared and began to see the screen form into a cube.. I was thinking ""Ok_ neat a optical illusion"" then I looked up and my lamp had turned into 3 eucalyptus trees. I looked down at my phone to see that It was a different kind of phone then I had 10 seconds earlier. I then tried to dial my friend's number again and my phone appeared to be a bar of soap. She called back and I managed to answer with great confusion. She told me to go get my mom and I convinced her I was fine but apparently I started rambling and what I was saying made no sense..

I managed to call my psychiatrist around 12:25am and I asked her what was wrong and she said that it's a side affect of Sonata that only one of her patients besides myself have experienced. She told me to not take that pill again. She said in a few hours I should be fine_ and I was.. I felt sick to my stomach and I had a headache. Everything I saw in the light was very colorful but warped. It's hard to beleive that only 10mg could make me experience such a detailed hallucination. It was very frightening for me.,F,19,5  days,11/13/2006,Sonata

80, 1, to fall asleep and stay asleep,Did the opposite and kept me awake,Before taking Sonata I was taking high levels of melatonin which_ didn't help me to fall asleep faster or sleep longer_ but did help me to get deeper sleep for the 4-5 hours that I did sleep_ thus making me feel more refreshed. Every night I have taken the sonata (at about 8 or 9pm) I have not been able to fall asleep for 5-6 hours (much longer than the melatonin)_ or about 2-3am. I then would wake up at 5:30 after only a few hours of sleep and be very tired. It's almost like it is actually making me wired. Not a happy camper! DOESN'T WORK.,F,36,4  days,10/30/2006Email,Sonata

I have tried all the others on the market as well.

I would wake up in different parts of the house or even hold conversations with family members that I would not remember the next morning.",M,26,2  weeks,11/17/2002,Sonata
