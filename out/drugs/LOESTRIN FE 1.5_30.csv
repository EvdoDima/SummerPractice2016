0, 1, Subside periods_ prevent pregnancy_,Before this cause I was on low estrogen 24 for you have years no problem.This has been constantly spotting when I decided to give myself a period I am bleeding for 2 weeks then I will stop and then I will start spotting throughout the month. The cramps are absolutely ridiculous and a continuous spotting is a pain in the ass. I'm definitely getting off this pill today and going to try something else.,The only reason I switch pills in the first place is because the loestrin 24 dosage was low and my body got used to it so I had to switch to a higher dosage this pill I do not recommend.,F,30,2  months,5/11/2016Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

2, 5, Regulate menstrual cycle,Mild increase in acne during first month_ breast tenderness/enlargement,I was scared to take this birth control due to all the negative reviews_ but my experience has been wonderful. First month was a little rough. My acne went nuts and my breasts became very swollen and tender. I almost quit and went back to my doctor after 3 weeks_ but I decided to hang in there and I'm glad I did. My period was nearly non-existent. I am now on my second month and I feel great. All the side effects have subsided. Much better than ortho-tricyclen. No mood swings_ depression_ etc. Every birth control works different for each person_ so don't knock it until you try it!!,F,25,2  months1.5/30,4/10/2016,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
3, 1, Birth control,I got pregnant while on this pill. I was a single mom struggling to raise two kids and faithfully took my pill every morning after coffee. I was working two jobs and didn't know I was pregnant until 4 months. I am tiny and did not gain any weight because I was so active. I ended up having to give my baby up for adoption because the father would not take responsibility and I knew I could not afford to raise another child. I took bc for years before this and nev had this problem until switching to Lo Estrin. at the time I worked for someone  who's wife got pregnant on the same pill and bc of the lack of regular periods she did not know until her second trimester. The child was born with major both defects. Please do not take this pill.,,F,38,1  months,3/7/2016,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
4, 1, birth control,Depression_ mood swings_ emotional_ loss of sex drive_ anger,Normally a happy_ easy going person. But these pills have changed my mood completely. I would sometimes sit there and cry for no reason at all_ feel down and depressed. Since taking these I have become very argumentative with my boyfriend and also lost my sex drive. I go back to normal when I have a 7 day break from them. Discontinuing these today so I can feel like myself again.,F,20,3  months30mg,3/3/2016,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

The last two months being on Marvelon 21_ I was extremely depressed and since switching I have been much happier and generally have more energy. I also suffered from recurring UTI's (pretty much monthly)_ and so far I havent had a UTI this month (groundbreaking!!). The only negative side effects were a headache for the first three days of starting the pill and I am currently having quite painful cramps during my period_ however these could just be side effects I have experienced from switching pills this month.

7, 1, Control periods,Weight gain_ depression_ anxiety and mood swings.,I have been taking this for a year and just realized after reading all the reviews what my problem has been.  I have stayed at a steady weight of 145-150 for all my life_ I'm a bodybuilder so I'm in the gym 2-3 hours a day and gained 20 lbs since starting.  I haven't changed anything eating or lifting wise to gain this much weight.  I have been so emotionally unstable and just thought it was because I moved cities but I've been here a year and still the same.  I flip at the drop of a hat_ will wake up pissed off cry over anything and be a complete b*tch for no reason.  I have become super depressed_ suicidal and have horrible anxiety that I've never had before starting this pill. I am always tired no matter what_ dizzy where I almost fall over_ half my face tingles or goes numb.  I have also noticed my face having a lot more dark spots than ever and my hair is thin and brittle.  All in all I have not been myself since starting and I'm so glad I found this site and these reviews to know to stop taking them! I would never recommend anyone to take this birth control!

15, 2, Acne/heavy periods,Headache after headache! Bad enough for me to forget sentences half way through/lose concentration for anything. Constantly tired (but always loved a nap so may not be loestrin related...) I can flip at the drop of a hat - angelic one minute and tearing someones head off the next. Impatient. Can't stop eating...not really hungry but just keep picking! Bad cramps on pill free break but the period on the whole is lighter with the heaviest/most painful day being the 2nd/3rd day...and my periods only last 5 out of the 7 days. If I miss one pill by a matter of hours I bleed and it won't stop no matter how good I am with the rest of the pack. I haven't got pregnant and I only get a few spots (mainly stress related). No breast tenderness like with other pills I've tried. Decrease in sex drive.

22, 1, Contraception,Depression_ Anxiety_ Acne_ Scalp Burning and Hair Loss,My doctor prescribed Loestrin 30 after breakthrough bleeding caused by Loestrin 20. I was prescribed Loestrin as I had bad experiences with Microgynon 30_ Cilest and Yasmin.During my year on Loestrin I suffered from depression_ so severe I was put on antidepressants at one point in order to cope. I asked the doctor whether the pill could be the cause and they were adamant that it wasn't so I persevered for another six months before finally taking matters into my own hands and stopping.My mood has improved significantly_ however since stopping Loestrin I have experienced catastrophic amount of hair loss. The loss is so bad that over the past month and a half I have been off Loestrin_ I have two bald patches and have lost nearly half my hair. I am now going through the process of finding out exactly what is happening but internet research has told me that Loestrin is notorious for causing hair loss due to it's androgen content.It's worth a mention that despite being on different methods of hormonal birth control_ I've NEVER experienced hair loss of any kind starting or stopping it.I feel like this pill has stolen away a year of my life and due to it's after effects will have a long lasting effect. If I could turn back time and never take this pill I would. I'd advise people to take great caution and do their research before taking this pill_ especially those who may have sensitivity to androgens.,F,22,1  years 1X D,1/5/2014Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
23, 5, Ovarian cysts,No side effects.,I was on the generic brand of Loestrin FE 1.5/30 called Gildess for about two years. I absolutely loved this birth control! It never gave me any weird side effects_ which was great because I had spent years trying out different birth controls to find one that actually agreed with my body. It also helped out with my ovarian cysts (the only reason I was on birth control to begin with). I never had any weight gain_ moodiness_ cramping_ etc. I highly recommend this birth control to anyone with ovarian cysts. It will help you out so much. My doctor recently switched me to Loestrin 24 FE_ and to be honest I can't stand it!! It also helped with my cysts_ but over the last five months it made me gain weight_ I constantly feel bloated_ my breasts are always tender and went up two cup sizes and it's making me feel depressed. I'm definitely going to switch back. Birth control effects everybody differently_ but I'm glad I finally found a birth control that works for me.

I was convinced I was dying and presented to a&e_ where they could find nothing wrong with me. Only now_ have I realised that the pill must be the reason for me feeling like this. I wish I had not taken it for two months. I'm now on my period and at the start of my third day off the pill and I still feel awful. I constantly think I am going to die. This is not like me at all.

My body seriously rejected this pill. It wasn't acting normal. I was getting horrible stomach and headaches. My dreams were so vivid and abnormal_ and I'd always wake up 30 minutes to an hour before I was supposed to which is weird. Additionally_ I was super dehydrated/ had dry mouth. I was constantly running from the sink to the bathroom. HORRIBLE! My breasts hurt so badly_ and I lost my sex drive. I hated everything that made me happy. After figuring it out it may have been the pill_ I got off asap. I couldn't even finish it (I was two days short of finishing...it was THAT bad). I've been off for about 4 days.

I would get it cleared up then it would be right back again by the second week of the next pack. I asked my doctor about it and was told that its not likely because of the pills. I decided to stop taking them after my fourth month and so far the yeast infection hasn't come back. No matter how much water I drink_ i'm still thirsty. I was also extremly moody (my poor boyfriend had to deal with it) but the mood swings went away a week after I stopped taking it. My skin is extremely dry no matter how much lotion I put on.

44, 1, Birth control,loss of sex drive_ irritability_ chest pains_HORRIBLE WEIGHT GAIN_,I started taking this pill in August 09 because they didn't carry the other BCPs I was on at the new location I moved to. I started having chest pains and difficulty breathing which was VERY rare at my age. I am 25_ work out 5x a week and lead an overall healthy life style. I ended up in the emergency room a few times only to be told there was nothing wrong with me(thank God)...but this made me even more paranoid because the chest pains HAD to come from something being wrong. I can't think of anything else(after having numerous medical studies done) that gave me the pains other than this stupid BCP. I also gained 40 lbs on this pill. I kept trying to lose the weight by exercising and eating healthy and I JUST KEPT GAINING!! Everytime I stepped on the scale after weeks of hard work I felt like the scale was mocking me because I had not only not lost any weight but I had gained. I stopped taking the pill about 8 months ago and lost about 25 of the pounds that I gained so I still have a ways to go. I also had issues with sex and it was two-fold. Not only did the pill decrease my sex drive_ but the more weight I gained_ the less sexy I felt. This pill caused some relationship problems in my marriage before we figured out it was the birth control that did this to me.

After 3 weeks on it_ I had such severe anger and my husband couldn't understand why I wanted to fight all the time. I also felt paranoid and this led to more irrational anger. I consciously could tell I had no control over the anger I was experiencing and it was definitely a result of the medicine. I gained a few pounds (all of it in my abdomen). The minimal weight gain was not a big deal_ it was the extreme mood swings and anger issues I was having. I've been off this birth control for 2 weeks and I feel back to normal. I'm sure it's great for others_ just not for me.,,F,36,30  days20 mcg 1X D,1/10/2012Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

51, 1, BC,Acne_ anxiety_ moodiness_ depression_ bloating_ headaches,I am so happy I read these ratings and know that I am not the only one. I have been taking this pill for about 8 months and although not having a period is great_ the side effects are not worth it. I am always a happy person and since I have been on this pill I cry for no reason and then I can't stop. I feel depressed and tired all the time. I would NOT recommend this pill.,F,26,8  months 1X D,12/4/2011,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

55, 1, Birth Control,Severe and Persistent Anxiety_ Shortness of Breath_ Rapid Heartbeat_ Panic Attacks_ Paranoia,"It started with general malaise and not sleeping so well but I was living away from home so I figured it had to be that but the symptoms didn't go away once I went back home. Then I began experiencing severe anxiety when flying or driving in a car--feeling like at any moment we would crash_ imaging myself dying when there was no reason to be worried. I began to become almost hypochondriac in my severe anxiety about my health..I prayed every night I wouldn't die in my sleep_ I was worried that I had somehow contracted HIV_ I began to take sleep-aides because I slept so poorly and my heart felt like it was fluttering and I couldn't breathe. My behavior changed as I couldn't concentrate at work for any more than five minutes and I had trouble even sitting still long enough to finish dinner at the dining room table. I felt like I had to be constantly moving and couldn't relax. I have had panic attacks about things I would never have worried about before or only worried about in a normal way. The worst thing for me was feeling like I was going crazy_ I began seeing a therapist convinced (due to my hypochondria-like mentality) that I was suffering from symptoms of Schizophrenia and the ""depersonalization"" I was experiencing (one effect of extreme anxiety in which you feel like you are seeing yourself from the outside) only made that worse. A woman on another forum suggested we take action by filing a class action lawsuit against the company that makes loestrin for not w",F,23,10  months 1X D,11/22/2011Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
56, 5, Contraceptive,None,I haven't had any problems with this birth control at all. I recently was taking Aviane and I absolutely HATED it. Aviane made me extremely anxious all the time_ I almost took myself to the hospital because I was having such horrible anxiety attacks. So my doctor switched me to Lo Loestrin and I'm back to my old self_ I've had zero side effects_ no problems whatsoever. I read other ratings on it and a lot of women seem to really hate this drug_ but like I said - no side effects. I love it compare to my last one.,F,19,3  months1 1X D,10/19/2011,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
57, 1, Preventing Pregnancy/ovarian cyst,Severe nausea_ throwing the first day after the night I took my first dose_ extreme anxiety_ nervousness_ cystic acne flareup_ immediate enlarged and sore breasts_ extreme fatigue and dizziness_ severe cramping and bloating,I am not one to complain about stuff_ but I have never been this sick from taking a medication.  I took my first dose on a Sunday night_ and the next day after taking the medication I was constantly in the bathroom all day long throwing up.  I feel like I have gained a ton of weight in just two days after taking this even though I have not been wanting to eat due to the extreme nausea.  I feel like my abdomen is very swollen and just want to curl up in a ball all day.  Luckily_ I work at from home and was able to keep a bucket next to me all day.  If I worked in the office_ I would not have made it to work.  I am stopping this immediately.  I have always had acne_ and was getting it under control pretty well until I started this.  Now within a couple of days_ I have five huge pimples in the form of cystic acne.  (the ones that almost hurt to look at!)  My breasts have already gone up one cup size in two days!  They hurt and I am wearing a sports bra to help with the pain.  I am praying this wears off in a couple of days.  I can't live another day feeling like I do!!!!!  Ugh!!!  To anyone that has tried this and it works_ great!  I can't do it.,F,29,2  days1.5/30 1X D,10/18/2011,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
58, 4, Birth control,You must give this pill time to work with your body! The first 2 months of taking this I didn't have any periods then on the third month my period came. At first my emotions were all over the place crying all the time getting upset for no reason and feeling depressed. Im on my fourth month now and I have to say things have definitely improved!! Just stick out the first few months and hopefully it will work for you as it has for me :) Good luck,If the pill inst for you just go to your GP and try another as it wont work the same for everyone...We are all different after all. P.S don't be worried by all the really scary reviews on here_ remember! there are side effects to every medication that is prescribed.,F,19,4  months30 1X D,10/11/2011Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
