0, 1, Subside periods_ prevent pregnancy_,Before this cause I was on low estrogen 24 for you have years no problem.This has been constantly spotting when I decided to give myself a period I am bleeding for 2 weeks then I will stop and then I will start spotting throughout the month. The cramps are absolutely ridiculous and a continuous spotting is a pain in the ass. I'm definitely getting off this pill today and going to try something else.,The only reason I switch pills in the first place is because the loestrin 24 dosage was low and my body got used to it so I had to switch to a higher dosage this pill I do not recommend.,F,30,2  months,5/11/2016Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

2, 5, Regulate menstrual cycle,Mild increase in acne during first month_ breast tenderness/enlargement,I was scared to take this birth control due to all the negative reviews_ but my experience has been wonderful. First month was a little rough. My acne went nuts and my breasts became very swollen and tender. I almost quit and went back to my doctor after 3 weeks_ but I decided to hang in there and I'm glad I did. My period was nearly non-existent. I am now on my second month and I feel great. All the side effects have subsided. Much better than ortho-tricyclen. No mood swings_ depression_ etc. Every birth control works different for each person_ so don't knock it until you try it!!,F,25,2  months1.5/30,4/10/2016,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
3, 1, Birth control,I got pregnant while on this pill. I was a single mom struggling to raise two kids and faithfully took my pill every morning after coffee. I was working two jobs and didn't know I was pregnant until 4 months. I am tiny and did not gain any weight because I was so active. I ended up having to give my baby up for adoption because the father would not take responsibility and I knew I could not afford to raise another child. I took bc for years before this and nev had this problem until switching to Lo Estrin. at the time I worked for someone  who's wife got pregnant on the same pill and bc of the lack of regular periods she did not know until her second trimester. The child was born with major both defects. Please do not take this pill.,,F,38,1  months,3/7/2016,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
4, 1, birth control,Depression_ mood swings_ emotional_ loss of sex drive_ anger,Normally a happy_ easy going person. But these pills have changed my mood completely. I would sometimes sit there and cry for no reason at all_ feel down and depressed. Since taking these I have become very argumentative with my boyfriend and also lost my sex drive. I go back to normal when I have a 7 day break from them. Discontinuing these today so I can feel like myself again.,F,20,3  months30mg,3/3/2016,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

The last two months being on Marvelon 21_ I was extremely depressed and since switching I have been much happier and generally have more energy. I also suffered from recurring UTI's (pretty much monthly)_ and so far I havent had a UTI this month (groundbreaking!!). The only negative side effects were a headache for the first three days of starting the pill and I am currently having quite painful cramps during my period_ however these could just be side effects I have experienced from switching pills this month.

7, 1, Control periods,Weight gain_ depression_ anxiety and mood swings.,I have been taking this for a year and just realized after reading all the reviews what my problem has been.  I have stayed at a steady weight of 145-150 for all my life_ I'm a bodybuilder so I'm in the gym 2-3 hours a day and gained 20 lbs since starting.  I haven't changed anything eating or lifting wise to gain this much weight.  I have been so emotionally unstable and just thought it was because I moved cities but I've been here a year and still the same.  I flip at the drop of a hat_ will wake up pissed off cry over anything and be a complete b*tch for no reason.  I have become super depressed_ suicidal and have horrible anxiety that I've never had before starting this pill. I am always tired no matter what_ dizzy where I almost fall over_ half my face tingles or goes numb.  I have also noticed my face having a lot more dark spots than ever and my hair is thin and brittle.  All in all I have not been myself since starting and I'm so glad I found this site and these reviews to know to stop taking them! I would never recommend anyone to take this birth control!

15, 2, Acne/heavy periods,Headache after headache! Bad enough for me to forget sentences half way through/lose concentration for anything. Constantly tired (but always loved a nap so may not be loestrin related...) I can flip at the drop of a hat - angelic one minute and tearing someones head off the next. Impatient. Can't stop eating...not really hungry but just keep picking! Bad cramps on pill free break but the period on the whole is lighter with the heaviest/most painful day being the 2nd/3rd day...and my periods only last 5 out of the 7 days. If I miss one pill by a matter of hours I bleed and it won't stop no matter how good I am with the rest of the pack. I haven't got pregnant and I only get a few spots (mainly stress related). No breast tenderness like with other pills I've tried. Decrease in sex drive.

22, 1, Contraception,Depression_ Anxiety_ Acne_ Scalp Burning and Hair Loss,My doctor prescribed Loestrin 30 after breakthrough bleeding caused by Loestrin 20. I was prescribed Loestrin as I had bad experiences with Microgynon 30_ Cilest and Yasmin.During my year on Loestrin I suffered from depression_ so severe I was put on antidepressants at one point in order to cope. I asked the doctor whether the pill could be the cause and they were adamant that it wasn't so I persevered for another six months before finally taking matters into my own hands and stopping.My mood has improved significantly_ however since stopping Loestrin I have experienced catastrophic amount of hair loss. The loss is so bad that over the past month and a half I have been off Loestrin_ I have two bald patches and have lost nearly half my hair. I am now going through the process of finding out exactly what is happening but internet research has told me that Loestrin is notorious for causing hair loss due to it's androgen content.It's worth a mention that despite being on different methods of hormonal birth control_ I've NEVER experienced hair loss of any kind starting or stopping it.I feel like this pill has stolen away a year of my life and due to it's after effects will have a long lasting effect. If I could turn back time and never take this pill I would. I'd advise people to take great caution and do their research before taking this pill_ especially those who may have sensitivity to androgens.,F,22,1  years 1X D,1/5/2014Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
23, 5, Ovarian cysts,No side effects.,I was on the generic brand of Loestrin FE 1.5/30 called Gildess for about two years. I absolutely loved this birth control! It never gave me any weird side effects_ which was great because I had spent years trying out different birth controls to find one that actually agreed with my body. It also helped out with my ovarian cysts (the only reason I was on birth control to begin with). I never had any weight gain_ moodiness_ cramping_ etc. I highly recommend this birth control to anyone with ovarian cysts. It will help you out so much. My doctor recently switched me to Loestrin 24 FE_ and to be honest I can't stand it!! It also helped with my cysts_ but over the last five months it made me gain weight_ I constantly feel bloated_ my breasts are always tender and went up two cup sizes and it's making me feel depressed. I'm definitely going to switch back. Birth control effects everybody differently_ but I'm glad I finally found a birth control that works for me.

I was convinced I was dying and presented to a&e_ where they could find nothing wrong with me. Only now_ have I realised that the pill must be the reason for me feeling like this. I wish I had not taken it for two months. I'm now on my period and at the start of my third day off the pill and I still feel awful. I constantly think I am going to die. This is not like me at all.

My body seriously rejected this pill. It wasn't acting normal. I was getting horrible stomach and headaches. My dreams were so vivid and abnormal_ and I'd always wake up 30 minutes to an hour before I was supposed to which is weird. Additionally_ I was super dehydrated/ had dry mouth. I was constantly running from the sink to the bathroom. HORRIBLE! My breasts hurt so badly_ and I lost my sex drive. I hated everything that made me happy. After figuring it out it may have been the pill_ I got off asap. I couldn't even finish it (I was two days short of finishing...it was THAT bad). I've been off for about 4 days.

I would get it cleared up then it would be right back again by the second week of the next pack. I asked my doctor about it and was told that its not likely because of the pills. I decided to stop taking them after my fourth month and so far the yeast infection hasn't come back. No matter how much water I drink_ i'm still thirsty. I was also extremly moody (my poor boyfriend had to deal with it) but the mood swings went away a week after I stopped taking it. My skin is extremely dry no matter how much lotion I put on.

44, 1, Birth control,loss of sex drive_ irritability_ chest pains_HORRIBLE WEIGHT GAIN_,I started taking this pill in August 09 because they didn't carry the other BCPs I was on at the new location I moved to. I started having chest pains and difficulty breathing which was VERY rare at my age. I am 25_ work out 5x a week and lead an overall healthy life style. I ended up in the emergency room a few times only to be told there was nothing wrong with me(thank God)...but this made me even more paranoid because the chest pains HAD to come from something being wrong. I can't think of anything else(after having numerous medical studies done) that gave me the pains other than this stupid BCP. I also gained 40 lbs on this pill. I kept trying to lose the weight by exercising and eating healthy and I JUST KEPT GAINING!! Everytime I stepped on the scale after weeks of hard work I felt like the scale was mocking me because I had not only not lost any weight but I had gained. I stopped taking the pill about 8 months ago and lost about 25 of the pounds that I gained so I still have a ways to go. I also had issues with sex and it was two-fold. Not only did the pill decrease my sex drive_ but the more weight I gained_ the less sexy I felt. This pill caused some relationship problems in my marriage before we figured out it was the birth control that did this to me.

After 3 weeks on it_ I had such severe anger and my husband couldn't understand why I wanted to fight all the time. I also felt paranoid and this led to more irrational anger. I consciously could tell I had no control over the anger I was experiencing and it was definitely a result of the medicine. I gained a few pounds (all of it in my abdomen). The minimal weight gain was not a big deal_ it was the extreme mood swings and anger issues I was having. I've been off this birth control for 2 weeks and I feel back to normal.

Then I began experiencing severe anxiety when flying or driving in a car--feeling like at any moment we would crash_ imaging myself dying when there was no reason to be worried. I began to become almost hypochondriac in my severe anxiety about my health..I prayed every night I wouldn't die in my sleep_ I was worried that I had somehow contracted HIV_ I began to take sleep-aides because I slept so poorly and my heart felt like it was fluttering and I couldn't breathe. My behavior changed as I couldn't concentrate at work for any more than five minutes and I had trouble even sitting still long enough to finish dinner at the dining room table. I felt like I had to be constantly moving and couldn't relax. I have had panic attacks about things I would never have worried about before or only worried about in a normal way. The worst thing for me was feeling like I was going crazy_ I began seeing a therapist convinced (due to my hypochondria-like mentality) that I was suffering from symptoms of Schizophrenia and the ""depersonalization"" I was experiencing (one effect of extreme anxiety in which you feel like you are seeing yourself from the outside) only made that worse.

I took my first dose on a Sunday night_ and the next day after taking the medication I was constantly in the bathroom all day long throwing up.  I feel like I have gained a ton of weight in just two days after taking this even though I have not been wanting to eat due to the extreme nausea.  I feel like my abdomen is very swollen and just want to curl up in a ball all day.  Luckily_ I work at from home and was able to keep a bucket next to me all day.  If I worked in the office_ I would not have made it to work.  I am stopping this immediately.  I have always had acne_ and was getting it under control pretty well until I started this.  Now within a couple of days_ I have five huge pimples in the form of cystic acne.  (the ones that almost hurt to look at!)  My breasts have already gone up one cup size in two days!  They hurt and I am wearing a sports bra to help with the pain.  I am praying this wears off in a couple of days.  I can't live another day feeling like I do!!!!!  Ugh!!!

65, 2, period regulation,Massive increase in appetite_ trouble sleeping,Originally went back on the pill in to help regulate my periods and to help with excruciating cramps I've dealt with since a teenager.  Started with Avaine and then Loestrin 1/20_ neither of which worked since there wasn't enough estrogen to stop break through bleeding.  I seriously don't understand why doctors even rec those pills_ 20mcg seems like WAAY too little to be effective.  After that I was given the generic Junel 1.5/30_ which was much better in terms of break thru bleeding_ even if I did have some minor cramping most of the month.  The major problem for me_ though_ was the MASSIVE increase in hunger and sleep problems.  I am ALWAYS hungry_ usually to the point of feeling pysically ill if I don't eat something NOW.  Normally_ I can't eat as soon as I wake up (about an hr later)_ but I wake up feeling so sick with hunger that it's the first thing I reach for.  And I often wake up around 4am no matter what time I go to bed_ 10pm or 1am_ doesn't matter.  I don't get enough sleep_ so I'm always tired.  Since I'm a person that really needs 8-9 hours of sleep a night to function normally_ and nicely_ the following day I just can't take another night of this.  I'm willing to put up with the somewhat irregular and/or painful periods in order to keep my sanity.,F,32,4  months 1X D,8/10/2011,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Also_ I find myself sad and hopeless - this is not like me. I do not feel like myself at all. I HATE THIS PILL. I'm on it because it was the only combination pill that contained low estrogen. I had ONE complex migraine in the last year_ and my health care provider wanted to take me off estrogen altogether due to risk of stroke. What is a risk of stroke compared to a risk of suicide?

However_ this summer just before I turned 34_ I gained weight very rapidly and had a severe decrease in sex drive. I was blaming this on several other factors that are now in control_ yet the problems remain. It only occurred to me recently to see if this pill might be the reason. My only explanation is that now that I am older_ I am experiencing a natural shift in hormones and they are no longer reacting well to the hormones in this pill. I feel very enlightened by these comments and will look into getting off of it for a while and see what my own hormones are like.,F,34,8  years 1X D,3/16/2011,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I am an absolute wreck. I never get good sleep anymore_ and I am very irritable. This whole time I thought it was my fault and didn't want to blame the birth control but I've just felt like I'm not myself anymore. I used to be happy_ confident_ and bubbly. Now I am a psycho bitch_ for NO reason. I looked up all of my journal entries and linked this behavior right back to when I started taking it. If you get these side effects_ stop use immediately.

However_ it's far too easy to blame something like that on a pill. Stop scapegoating this birth control. If you swear you're ""more hormonal"" or ""just not yourself"" when you take it_ simply stop taking it and don't complain. Hormones DO NOT affect everyone the same way.

My current boyfriend told me I'm the most stable girlfriend he's ever dated. My ability to deal with most problems is very good. He asked that I go on the pill when he moved in and I told him I would. Since I have had problems in the past I told my doctor about them. She assured me that this would be better since it was a low dose. Wrong. Within three days I had become massively paranoid about my boyfriend cheating on me_ hugely jealous and next to impossible to live with. This weekend he made a comment that was only meant to be a joke and I cried about it for three days. Today I actually and literally cried for three hours. I am not the type of person who cries like that. I have literally entertained suicidal thoughts while at the same time rationalizing that I love where I am in my life. I love my boyfriend (although I hate him right now for asking me to take this!)_ I'm working hard in law-school_ I live in San Diego which is awesome_ I have a great apartment that I love to come home to and I live a healthy active lifestyle. I have zero reason to be depressed. ZERO. Yet since I've been taking the pill_ I feel like I'm losing my mind. I can't wait to be back to my normal self.

Depression_ severe anxiety_ lucid rationalization of the world around you_ lack of sex drive_ lack of creativity_ digestive problems_ incredibly strange dreams_ finding fault with the loved ones around you as an excuse to be alone with your own depression_ bloating to the point of appearing pregnant_ and completely irregular bleeding are not worth it.,F,25,7  months 1X D,2/20/2011,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

As far as periods go_ I like this pill because I've had heavy periods all my life and now they're really light and manageable_ only lasting about 4 days instead of 6-7. My cramps were also decresed. Since I've been on the pill_ my boyfriend of two years has noticed changes in me_ that I didn't even think could be attributed to the pill until I read the side effects and realized I had nearly every single one. The worst being decreased sex drive. It's causing a lot of pain and frustration in our relationship as I never want to be touched and never want to have sex. I never used to be like that_ and he was with me before I went on this pill.  I just never think about sex.  I also have headaches every day of my life and migraines about once every two weeks. I'm always exhausted_ even if I just got 10 hours of sleep. I have no ambition. I just want to lay in bed. I have noticed heart palpitations_ mostly when I go to bed at night_ but now more frequently over the past week_ occurring several times an hour. It's really scary_ and makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. I have tenderness in my breasts and can't stand to have them touched. I feel like I have the flu every day_  It's really annoying to have this hacking cough for no reason. I have gained 20 pounds in the past year.

After only a few of weeks_ she changed from a happy_ excited bride-to-be (very much in love with her future husband) to an agitated mess - angry_ depressed_ anxious_ crying and panicky - convinced that she was making a terrible mistake getting married.Very out of character she started talking everyday to some random guy she just met_ calling him her best friend after just meeting him! She didn't want to be with her fiance and no longer wanted to get married (after being engaged for close to a year and planning the perfect little wedding). Her personality completely changed - we were all so scared - my husband and I_ her friends and esp. her fiance! It occurred to me that it might be the Loestrin - after all - hormones are responsible for some pretty serious stuff - Postpartum Depression can cause a mother to not love her newborn baby for goodness sake!! Anyway_ I called her doctor and the nurse agreed that she should come off the pill. 3 days after quitting she returned to normal and literally cannot believe what the pill had done! The wedding is back on!! She will be using the barrier method for a while and maybe try ANOTHER BCP sometime in the future.

I mean an attack so bad I was telling the Lord my prayers and to welcome me home. That's how bad it was! From that point on_ I got more and more anxious just worse and worse. Finally_ I couldn't take it anymore and I stopped. It's been 2 weeks since I stopped the pill and I am still so anxious I can't function_ I'm having panic attacks just about everyday.

She assured me that Loestrin would not exacerbate the problem_ but I can assure all of you that it certainly did. Also_ I have increased anxiety and my mind races at bedtime_ making it difficult to sleep.

Cry a little more than I used to for things_ which is ok_ since I was a stone-hearted person (could not make me cry for anything).,I experienced spotting the first month I took the pill and it went away after that. I have been having regular periods that last 4 days. The main reason why I took the pill was because I found out I have endometriosis (lining in the uterus betgan to grow outside of my uterus inclumps)_ causing 2 golf-ball sized ovarian cysts to develop (had them surgically removed in 2009). Subsequent ultrasounds show the cysts have not come back. Pelvic exams by my ob/gyn show my endometriosis is kept at minimum. She did explain I probably won't be on this pill forever. It depends on how my endometriosis develops. I am not depressed. I don't cry over every little thing but i am a little more emotionally sensitive. My sex drive is very healthy_ no diminished libido. Most importantly_ no baby! Before taking this pill_ I used to bleed heavily_ with clots and all. Before taking this pill_ I used to have frequent_ VERY PAINFUL bowel movements_ which I found out was due to clumps of my endometrium were growing on the outside of my intestinal tract within the abdominal cavity_ thereby throwing off the natural undulations that the colon makes to make your poop pass through normally.

The biggest side effect I noticed from this pill is that I became very moody and had lots of crying spells.  I am usually an even keel_ happy person_ but now I cry on a regular basis for small reasons.  That is not like me at all and unfortunately other people in my life have started to notice.  In addition_ my breasts have gotten larger and are tender.  Maybe not the worst side effect.  I haven't really had a lot of weight gain though...maybe just a few pounds and that is more likely due to the holidays.  Oh_ one other thing I read about this pill is that it can affect your ability to wear contact lenses and I have definitely noticed this.  I have to take them out more frequently and wear glasses.  I have no clue why this happens_ but I did experience this side effect.  Overall_ I think there are easier birth control pills to take out there.,F,29,2  months 1X D,1/15/2011,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

My doctor just recently switched me to Loestrin as my previous Birth Control pill_ Lutera_ was not hormonally strong enough to regulate my period. Within the first week_ I noticed changes_ but the worst hit at week 3. I went from being an upbeat_ ambitious_ optimistic young college student to a miserable_ depressed zombie. It was like I hit a brick wall. The previous comment ""I couldn't control my thoughts"" is the perfect description. I was afraid to be alone because my mind just went wild. I felt like there was no meaning to my life_ I questioned everything_ I was constantly nauseous and anxious. I never could have imagined what ""depression"" truly meant. It was excruciating. I withdrew from everyone. The worst part was the effect it had on my relationship with my boyfriend_ who is honestly one of the best guys in the world. I was happy one second_ and the next I was convinced I couldn't be with him. And I didn't have any desire to let him touch me. It was like I had no control over my thoughts or emotions. I'm so grateful I came across these reviews_ there's finally a reason for these feelings I've been having. I've been scared to death that there was something seriously wrong with me. Threw the rest of the pack away this morning_ I already feel a little better. Here's hoping that with the next week_ these side effects will clear up.

Your body is getting used to this level of extra hormone in your body. About weight gain_ I had none! I was told by the nurse that your appetite might change. If you are craving icecream and it is not hunger_ have 2 spoonfuls. 20 extra calories won't make you fat. Just don't eat the pint.

I am so DEPRESSED living in Sunny Florida_ Really_ who is depressed in this awesome place! I am stopping the drug today and will get the IUD.  Just beware that Dr's get kick backs on all these new drugs they prescribe to us young ladies.  Just think how many 20-28 year old woman are on this drug across the country!

124, 1, birth control,anxiety_ headaches_ severe depression_ fatigue_ low sex drive_ severe mood swings_ crying spells_ racing & sucidal thoughts,When I first started taking Loestrin_ I didn't notice much of a change from my previous birth control- Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo. In fact my periods got lighter & my skin looked great. However_ after 3 months I started becoming extremely depressed & abnormally anxious. Within 30 mins of taking the pill at night_ I would get bad headaches & have racing thoughts_ which were irrational & unwanted. My mood was all over the place during the day & the crying spells were out of control. Btw the depression & severe fatigue I never wanted to get out of bed. I went from being a happy_ social butterfly to a recluse who never wanted to see anyone. My bf annoyed me all the time & I couldn't seem to control my thinking no matter how hard I tried. After reading all of these reviews_ I felt relieved to know I wasn't alone. I stopped taking Loestrin as I figured it had to be to blame for at least most of my symptoms_ if not all. It's been almost a week & my headaches are gone & the racing thoughts have subsided a good deal. The anxiety is still lingering_ though not as severe and my thoughts are more controlled. I don't feel normal yet but I'm hoping once this awful medicine is out of my system I will be able to return to my happy self. My body & brain got so used to feeling abnormal that I know it's going to take a bit just to overcome the trauma of it all.

No horrible side effects; not having a period at all is very nice_ although I read that only 20% of pill users experience it. No mood effects. I have gained about 5 pounds; not sure if that was just from getting married or because of the pill itself_ although it is harder to lose weight doing the same things I've always done. I used to constantly break out_ but by my 3rd month_ my skin completely cleared and has stayed that way. Again_ not sure if the pill had anything to do with it.

I've noticed the first 1.5-2 weeks make me feel ravenous_ like I can't stop eating. Then after the 2nd week the horrible stomach cramping bloating and constipation starts. During the 2nd week my breasts get very tender and swollen! I've probably gone up a whole cup size since I started taking this and I have gained a few extra pounds. I've also noticed a general loss in sex drive_ but nothing too bad_ mostly because I just felt so tired all the time and have been having trouble sleeping. The week before I get my peiod I start having severe depression and anxiety that continues until I start a new pack. I started having very dark thoughts and would lash out on my husband for no reason and just cry and cry. I felt hopeless and was worried there was something seriously wrong with me. My husband started to get scared to leave me alone when I got into these moods. I now know that the birth crontrol is the culprit. It took me three months to put it all together. I stopped taking it immediately after I realized the birth control was making me crazy and feel horrible. This is the 3rd BC I have been on and I am so done.

Increased breast size and tenderness.,When I started on Loestrin 24 I had quite a few rough mood swings and would have crying spells especially right after taking the pill. I decided to take the pill at night so that I could sleep off me the worst of the hormon induced emotions....I would reccoment trying this if you are have trouble. After the third pack my skin really cleared up_ my hormones (end emotions) leveled out to better then before the pill_ and my periods were very light and short yay! I did not notice any decrease in sax drive at all but I have gained about 8 lb. despite the fact that I have continued to hit the gym reguarly_ this may have a little to do with the fact that I just got married and started cooking dinner every night though :)  Additionally_ I have had an aweful sinus infection/cough for about 6 weeks now - I don't know if this is due to the birth control but I see it is a side effect so lets hope it clears up. Has anyone noticed hair loss? I don't see it as a side effect but I have been having problems with that lately and I am wondering if anyone also has something to do with the pill?,F,21,7  months 1X D,11/24/2010,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

It got to be around the 3rd month on the generic when i started having uncontrollable anxiety and crying spells.I have always been a worrier but this kind of anxiety i would not wish upon my worst enemy. It was a constant feeling of overwhelming emotion that i couldnt do anything but cry_ I even went to a therpaist to discuss my problems. It wasnt until seeing this site that i started to think maybe the pill could have something to do w it. I stopped taking it all together about 3 days ago. I just got my period but im still a little edgy/depressed/anxious_ really keeping my fingers corssed things will slowly return to normal & that this pill was a factor in some of this craziness. I still have a question for those of you experiencing the same thing..Was your anxiety directed at something specifically or was it all over the place?  While I am having anxiety about everything and depression for no reason a lot of my thoughts keep coming back to my bf & our relationship. but_ I have no reason why i would feel this way- when looking at the situation from a rational level-headed perspective nothing is even wrong_ but while in panic mode i tend to question our relationship and try to find something wrong with it..these irrational thoughts are driving me crazy!jw if anyone else had the same experience. still trying to figure it out.thank-you everyone for posting!it has helped a lot,F,21,1.5  yearsunsure 1X D,11/15/2010Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I'm an extremely social person but my closest friends told me it was like I was a cmplty diff person.

I'm a very sexual person and the drive to even allow my BF to touch me was shot.  When we would have sesx it was painful due to dryness.(I use to pride myself on the extent of my natural lubrication).

I went from a size 5-7 to 8-10 b/c my back side had gotten so huge and I always had the constant feeling of bloating and didn't want my jeans to snug on my waist.  The 3rdmth was the best month.  My bf noticed my boobs had gotten huge and I accepted the fact my a** was plumper.  I start a new pack when I get to the inactive pills so I've been enjoying not having a period.  Well the 4th month is pure hell.  I'm now sitting at my desk at work w/ the worse upper resp.infection ever AND another UTI.

I am 22 years old_ I shouldn't be fighting to stay awake at 9pm while I'm at a friends house visiting or even at a bar. Being 22...I go out once in a while. I was so sensitive to alcohol I could barely finish one beer without getting lightheaded and feeling nauseous (which is not normal for me). The worst part about this BC was that towards my third week of taking it I became extremely DEPRESSEED. I began thinking that everyone was against me and didn't like me. I began second guessing my relationship for NO reason and stopped talking to my boyfriend_ mom_ dad_ and friends. I was indifferent about everything and had absolutely no feelings whatsoever (when the month prior I was the happiest girl in the world). I also would start crying for no reason. I just burst out in tears if someone would ask me a simple question (and i am not normally a cryer). I would go from being sad to snapping on someone at the blink of an eye. I stopped taking Loestrine after seeing all the horrible reveiws on it and within one week I was pretty much back to my normal happy self.

152, 3, Birth control,Extreme moodiness_ anxiety_ weight loss_ sinus problems_ hair loss.,"When I started taking this BC after the birth of my third child_ I hadn't really done my research on this pill but the prospect of having shorter and lighter periods was intriguing.  When I first started taking it_ there were no major side effects that I experienced_ but I did notice that when I drank alcohol_ sometimes I would only be able to have a max of two glasses or something and would experience an extreme migraine the next day.  Excedrin and other drugs didn't really help too much; the only solution was sleep and rest.  I wasn't sure if it was related to the Loestrin or not_ but I did read that BC pills do make you feel the effects of alcohol faster and that may have contributed to the headaches.  Also_ I had minor sinus problems where I would take a Tylenol sinus tablet and be fine but while I've been on this pill_ the sinus pressure and pain has been really unbearable and it feels like my head is going to explode.  I thought it was allergy problems_ but I didn't really have all the sneezing and runny nose symptoms_ just major blocked nasal passages and it was really hard to get them to drain out to relieve the pressure.

I thought I needed to have my gallbladder taken out! My doc put me on Loestrin 24 after the birth of my daughter to regulate my cycle.  He also said it lowered my chance for ovarian cancer.  After having a second period in one month as well as terrible stomach cramps_ back pain_ nausea_ and vomiting I decided to research.  I even went to the ER thinking there was something terribly wrong w/ me.  They found nothing.  Everything I have read here I have experienced.  I am so sensitive to meds and I can't believe I never even thought my BC could cause so many problems! In addition to what I stated above I've had constant vivid_ scary dreams_ panic attacks_ severe depression and anxiety_ and so much more.  i am so glad I did my research!,F,29,1  days30mg 1X D,8/28/2010Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I was on Yaz prior to this one_ but changed pills because it was ineffective and too expensive. However_ I never experienced such awful side effects like I did on this birth control.

My doctor prescribed it after the birth of my third child. I_ like many others who have posted here_ have had horrible reactions that I have never experienced before. My doctors didn't believe me! I had all kinds of tests done for my chest pains_ with no answers why they were occurring. I almost fell out of my chair when I read these reviews and realized that my panic attacks_ chest pains_ and recurring sinus infections have been possibly because of this pill. In addition_ I can't lose my last 10 lbs of baby weight_ have been fighting acne and extreme fatigue. I never had any of these problems after my first two were born or on previous pills- or ever in my life! I went to my doctor yesterday and switched to an older pill I used to take years ago. These reactions happened gradually with me - not at first_ and no doctor ever even mentioned that it could be this pill. Let me tell you I wasted a year and a half thinking I was crazy!

I'm generally a happy person - it takes a lot to get me down_ and I rarely stay down long. Suddenly_ though_ I found myself sad. If I wasn't sad_ I was anxious or angry. I was apologizing a lot for my behavior_ and I cried almost once a day. Then came the bleeding. It started a week after my period had ended_ 14 days into my cycle.It's light_ but constant.

I would never recommend this pill to anyone..buyers beware.

I accepted these symptoms too long until I actually felt like I was going mental_ luckily I felt the same on cilest and came off. I feel like this pill has ruined my life the past year and also my boyfriends who I've clearly put through hell.

I've been switching birth control for 2+ years trying to find one that works with my body. This one is working well so far. No gallbladder attacks_ no extreme bloating or irritability. I've actually dropped a few pounds this month_ not sure if it's from switching pills or if I got some extra exercise. My breasts are a tad more sensitive_ but nothing uncomfortable_ but they have went up almost a full cup size. ALL of my acne has disappeared. Not one spot left!! The only negative side effect I've noticed is leg cramps. I've got a few wicked charlie horses this month and I'm pretty sure the pill is the culprit. But I'll gladly deal with charlie horses over the horrible side effects I was having with other pills. It's really true that pills work differently for everyone. I hated my last prescription (Yasmin) but my friend swears up and down it's the best pill on the market. Loestrin FE has my vote.

I'm surprised that so many women seem to think it makes them moody or depressed_ because I haven't had any of that_ but then again I've never had any BCP make me depressed or moody.

And let me point out_ I have been on a diet and working out a fair amount (cardio and weight training) and the weight has just been creeping off soooo slowly. I attributed that to slower metabolism since I'm older now.   When I had talked to my Gyno about weight gain_ she dismissed it as not a possible side effect.  A couple of months ago_ I went in for a check-up and I actually have high blood pressure.  It was like 134/90...not too bad_ but I have never had that in my life.  It's always been normal.  I bet this pill caused that too. I also feel as though my libido has increased..or is back to normal (thank god!).  Based on other postings_ decreased libido seems like a possible side effect as well.  I have been off and on the pill since I was a teenager and can't really remember a time when a pill has caused me to gain weight or have decreased libido.

I then started my next pack and was fine for about 5 days after my period until I started spotting.  I've been spotting for 17 days straight now.  I have no desire to have sex.

( and by ""spotting"" I mean that I'd have my period for about 2 weeks_ stop for a week_ then start up again for another two weeks... this went on for about 8 months... pretty miserable ) This pill finally alleviated this problem that I was having.  I do have a history of anxiety and depression_ but found that this pill did NOT negatively effect my mood or libido! ( and most BCs I've been on do! )  I actually lost a bit of weight ( I'm assuming it was water weight from the previous pill I had been on... about 8 pounds! )  It just goes to show that different pills effect people differently!  I really couldn't be happier on this pill!

Seasonale didn't work so I switched back. I did 2 weeks on Microgestin_ and it was hell. I had severe headaches_numbness in my left arm_ my face_ and even my throat! I was told I had migraines_ but they didn't act like typical migraines.I have numbness when I don't have a headache. I was so anxious_ I couldn't sleep. I've had panic attacks. I've never been nervous before this. I've been sad and irritable lately. I've even had suicidal thoughts. Not in the sense that I want to commit suicide_ but suicide crosses my mind. I have no reason to be nervous or sad! I'm graduating from college soon_ I've got a great boyfriend and everything is going so well! They've done a ton of tests_ but nothing is wrong w/ me! I keep thinking the doctors missed something. The best diagnosis they could give is chronic severe anxiety! I quit taking Microgestin about a month ago_ and I'm on Xanax_ but I still don't feel like myself. One thought that occurred to me now is back when I was 13_ I contemplated suicide. I got over it and attributed it to teen angst. But now I realize it happened soon after being put on this pill_ so now I wonder if it's related.

So when my friend told me to try Loestrin I was very scared. Anyway_ started off with 1/20 and then about 5 years later had to switch to 1.5/30 due to spotting. Eventually I took myself off the pill back in 2006 due to just not feeling like myself or a bit ""numb"" and blah. I was afraid to do that even since I was on the pill for really bad periods and cramping. I ended up being much better and then just a few years ago my doctor wanted me to go back on the pill since I was having other stomach issues and to keep my cramps under control. I started off with 1/20 again but I ended up having spotting again about 6 months later and had to switch again to the higher dosage.

I couldn't sleep through the night and a week before my period I had such terrible back pain and constipation that I had to take laxatives.

Today is day 6 off the pill and my headaches are intense and my vision is off a bit_ leaving me with a faint feeling of dizziness_ almost off balance.  I am going to stay off this pill_ and drudge through the after effects as my body rebalances my hormones. Like some of the other reviewers_ I too have gone to a cardiologist. I had heart imaging and stress testing done_ and_ thankfully_ all is structurally fine.  Nevertheless_ the palpitations and flutters continue_ and to my mind are connected to taking this hormone pill.  I take no other medicine_ lead a healthy life,,F,45,3  years,11/2/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
231, 3, LOESTRIN Fe 24,Breast lumps and PAIN_ breakthrough bleeding two weeks before my period. Quick to anger/annoyed,OMG_ im so scared. This is my first birth control pill and my breasts hurt soooooooo bad...not to mention_ i bleed two weeks before my period (not much_ but enough to suck). Also_ I think the pill has made me a lot for quick to anger...which i dont like because i m generally a laid back person. I just wish i had some answers...,F,18,6  months,10/24/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
232, 2, Birth Control,Depression_ anxiety_ mood swings_ spotting or no periods after apprx 4 months of use,Pill worked fine for birth control purposes_ however I went from a normal well balanced woman to a crazy_ irrational depressed one over the year I have been on this. My mood swings were outrageous. I would get angry at the drop of a hat. My poor husband has had to endure the issues long enough so I am going off of this now thankfully!,F,32,1  years,10/2/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
233, 1, Birth Control,I haven't been on anything for several years and began taking it for a new relationship.  I have been on it for three months.  Breast tenderness_ a completely friggin' emotional WRECK.  It feels like your worst PMS 24/7.  Everything hurts in my body_ constant salt craving_ constant food cravings_ weight gain as a result of both and probably screwing up my chemistry and metabolism.  I can't concentrate on anything_ I have a lack of desire for EVERYTHING_ which is the opposite of who I was before.  I am at a loss for how a hormone supplemented can have these effects on my body_ but I am stopping it in a few days.  I will not only never take this pill again_ I will never take any birth control.  This is absolutely ridiculous and has completely ruined my life.,,F,25,90  days,9/18/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
234, 1, Birth Control,Extreme Anxiety,SO relieved to see that I'm not going crazy! I have suffered from terrible anxiety my entire life_ but it's been under control for about a year. I only started this pill a week and a half ago_ but about 3 days after starting this pill I experienced my first anxiety attack_ and since then I've been on an emotional roller coaster- constantly crying_ feeling like I'm going crazy_ and obsessing over contemplating breaking up with my boyfriend (who I love!) This pill has made me feel CRAZY- I'm stopping taking it tonight.,F,20,10  days,9/12/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
235, 4, painful periods_,strange dreams_ spotting,I started taking Loestrin because I was bleeding heavily and having severe menstrual cramps. I hadn't taken Birth control pills in 8+ years and did not want to take it after reading some reviews.   I took it for 2 weeks and was feeling strange/ having strange dreams.  (I am also on synthroid for a thryoid conditon).  I thought it might be interacting with the synthroid and changed the time that I take the medication.  I have been very happy with the results.  Cramps/breast tenderness are minimal.  The spotting has ended.,F,38,2  months,9/3/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
236, 5, regulate cycle_ prevent pregnancy,,I love this pill and have add no ill effects from taking it for all these years. Originally it was to regulate my period (which I was having every 2 weeks).  Have also taken Alesse and MinEstrin over the years with horrible results.  I would recommend this pill to anyone.,F,36,18  years,9/2/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

238, 1, contraception,I have had heart fluttering and panic attacks out of no where.  These did not start until I switched from loestrin to the generic version junel.  I haven't really been horribly moody_ but I have always had a low sex drive on BCP.  The panic attacks are the worst though_ I feel like I have to get up and go somewhere otherwise my heart is gonna stop. The only thing that cures it temporarly is the loving attention from my husband. Otherwise I am a crying mess!!,I am calling my doc today and getting off of these pills and hope for the best.,F,25,7  months,9/2/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
239, 4, Birth Control/ smaller periods,For the first 3 months I felt sick the first few days after taking a new pack_ I did experience cramping every once in a while.,I have been on this pill for close to 5 years now_ I started taking the pill to help regulate my periods. After my first pill failed (got my period every other week) I switched to LoEstrin_ after I got over the initial nausea I was great. I love this pill_ I've never been pregnant_ my periods are no more then 3 days long now. I think it's great.,F,20,5  years,8/28/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

241, 2, prevent pregnancy_ abnormal periods,excessive gas after eating_ insomnia_ night sweats_ mild nausea_ constant bloating & water retention_ 3-4 pound weight gain.,I'm not sure if any or all of my symptoms are associated with this pill_ but they did not start until I began taking it.  The most severe and frustrating ones are the inability to sleep.  It's like my mind won't rest.  I think about random things all night long and can't fall asleep or stay asleep.  Also_ anytime I drink or eat anything_ I have excessive and very smelly gas afterwards.  Also_ the bloating at all times.,F,29,2  months,8/21/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
242, 4, Birth Control,Weight gain; 1 day periods; some cramping; breast tenderness; decreased irratablitly,No other birth control worked for me_ they were to strong_ caused clots in knees and made me feel crazy emotionally. Loestrin 24 has decreased my periods from 7-8 days to 1 and I used to have a lot of clots and heavy bleeding and major cramping but now it is light and some cramping. Sex drive is so so. Wish they would make a generic so it would be cheaper though.,F,28,2  years,8/17/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Headaches.,I was put on this last May 2009 and I had no problems for the first few months except breast tenderness.  This past month I have been experiencing headaches_ loss of interest in just about everything and loss of sleep.  Now I am feeling depressed.  I'm calling my gyn this am to switch.

247, 1, Contraceptive/control periods,Very light periods which was good.  Cramps were pretty much gone which was GREAT.  But I had major bloating_ gained weight (20 lbs in 1 year!!)_ skin was extra oily.  Mood swings are extreme.  I've never been so moody before_ I can't control emotions.  Always sad or angry.  Emotional side effects didn't kick in until about 7 months into taking the pills though.  Everything else was right away.,,F,22,1  years,7/22/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
248, 1, Regulate periods and birth control,Horrible cramping_ increased depression and anxiety_ spotting. I had FOUR periods in TWO months! Also weight gain_ stomach cramps.,,,27,2  months,7/21/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
249, 4, Contraception,Bloating_ easily tired_ mild mood swings_ occasional decreased appetite,The first month was more difficult since my body was adjusting - I woke up in the morning with 0 energy and my limbs felt weak; I also experienced light nausea (cured by ginger ale). Luckily the weakness lasted only 2 weeks or so. I've had a much lighter period with minimal cramps_ which to my delight ended in under 3 days. However since starting the pill I've needed at least one short nap a day - my brain feels sluggish after 5-6 hours of activity. I think this can be corrected with increased exercise though. What bothers me most is the bloating_ which is almost daily occurrence either when waking up or immediately after meals. Overall I'm pretty happy with Loestrin FE_ I know I can't expect 0 side effects and as mine are rather mild overall_ I don't think I'll try other pills anytime soon.,F,20,2  months,7/19/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

251, 2, heavy menses/uterine fibroids,Bleeding every day of the month,First time on bcp ever.  I wanted to lessen heavy menses due to uterine fibroids.  Before this pill_ I only bled during my period_ but as soon as I started on it_ I bled every day_ which slowed during the sugar pills for a couple of days.  My bleeding was not heavy_ but it was not spotting either.  I tried a second pill pack to make sure I wasn't just stabilizing_ but it seemed even worse the second month.  I don't know if it's fair to blame it on this particular pill.  I may have had the type of fibroid that bled with taking anything with estrogen.  I opted for hysterectomy since my fibroid was very large and I didn't want to mess around with other options.,F,47,40  days,7/10/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

253, 1, Birth Control,About 2 months after being on Loestrin I started having awful anxiety and panic attacks. My heart was constantly racing and my throat felt tight. I have been to the ER_ Urgent Care_ and a lung specialist and nothing is wrong with me. I quit taking Loestrin about a month ago but am still experiencing anxiety_ however it's not as bad as when I was on it. I know it takes a few months to get out of your system so now I'm just waiting and I have an appointment with my GYN next week.,If you have crazy anxiety and heart racing on this pill you are not the only one. Stop taking it and call your gyn.,F,22,2  months,6/30/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
254, 3, cramps_ contraception,extreme moodiness (can cry on the spot_ little things make me frustrated_ angry and annoyed)_ tired_ more frequent urination_ did not help acne (no noticeable difference)_ dehydration leading to frequent headaches and migraines monthly.,I switched to Loestrin 24 about a year ago after trying Yaz. While Loestrin 24 did help my menstrual cycle (I don't get my period at all_ I get one dark brown spot_ minimal cramping for a few hours_ and then that's it) my side effects are terrible. I have become increasingly moody and tired for no reason. When I get angry at something I can cry immediately_ which is something that I've noticed did not happen while I was taking Yaz. I am now looking for a new pill without these annoying and agrivating side effects.,F,19,1  years,6/29/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

257, 2, to end continuous bleeding from dep,I have not taken this pill yet. I am afraid! After reading this page I am even more scared and confused!,My doctor prescribed these pills to regulate my messed up cycle due to two depo provera shots. After the first injection I did not bleed for 3 months_ then after the second shot_ 2 weeks later I kept bleeding and here I am 3 1/2 weeks later and still spotting and bleeding. This pill is suppossed to make the bleeding subside and help my cycle get back on track. I am so scared!!!!! I took Loestrin for years about 5 years ago. I took the pill for at leats ten years with no real bad side effect except headaches and leg cramps. No weight gain... there was a lack of sex drive. OMG maybe that helped to end my marriage back then. Who knows?! I am just scared. I am to a point where I just want to not take any synthetic hormones at all!!!!

Is it possible that I could be pregnant,F,32,8  months,6/25/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
259, 5, Birth control,Light periods_ mild spotting,This is my first time on birth control I went out and did alot of research on which one to start taking. I started with the generic of this Junel fe and everythings fantastic. My periods are lighter but past that its been working great as a main form of birth control and Have had no weight gain or bloating or anything except for the occasional ache near when I get my period which happened while off of it anyway so I think this is a great pill!,M,19,1  months,6/21/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

261, 1, contraceptive_ switched from Yaz,i have  been on this for about 3 weeks and can't wait til my one month is over. i switched from yaz thinking it would be better but i was wrong_ it's the same for me: loss of appetite_ fatigue_ nausea_ extreme moodiness throughout the day (happy_ sad_ angry_ sensitive_ irrational_ worried_ anxious_ confused)_ headaches.  Both of these pills made my life awful and cause some pretty bad fights with my wonderful boyfriend_ friends and family. sucked so bad.,no one should take a pill that changes them for the worse. no matter what the benefits are. it isn't worth it. life is awesome and a pill shouldn't ruin that for anyone.,F,28,3  weeks,6/8/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

265, 1, Birth Control,Severe migraines and headaches. Weight Gain (10ish lbs in 3 months)_ Acne_ moodiness and depression. Some chest pain.  Painful sudden and frequent cramps in legs and feet.,I'm finally going off of this after three months.  I think during that 3 month time_ I had maybe 10 days where I wasn't bleeding (sure it's an effective birth control -- it gives you your period the whole time you're on it!).  It also gave me migraines that I was experiencing multiple times a week_ made me super emotional_ and oddly enough I started getting leg and foot cramps multiple times a day.  I don't necessarily believe that birth control causes weight gain_ but I think it does make you more emotional (which may encourage emotional eating)_ and perhaps gives an increased appetite.  I'm looking forward to getting my life back now that today is my first day off of this pill.,F,23,3  months,5/28/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Other than that everything is fine.,I started out taking LOESTRIN 1/20 and my doctor felt that that particular dosage was too low due to me only having discharge a few days a month versus having a normal period. The 1/20's really clered my skin. Since I've switched to the 1.5/30_ my skin is really pretty.

After a year i got a period and ever since then it was very irregular(spotting all the time). I was on the mini pill because a lot of estrogen gives me headache. Quit the mini pill and went to my doc and she perscribed me Loesteryn24Fe. I've been on it for a week now and no side effects yet..hopefully it stays that way. By reading comments on here Im getting scared but If you research any other birth control its the same way_ no birth control works Perfect.

The main side effect for me has been breast tenderness and headaches during the 4 days of placebo pill_ but these are much better to me then having a painful period with weeks of PMS.  One must remember to give their body time to adjust to this medication.  I take the name brand version as there is not a generic for the Loestrin 24FE.,F,39,6  months,3/19/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I regret the day I started this pill; 1st pack everything seemed fine_ although my skin flared up terribly but didn't notice an increased appetite.  2ndpacket skin became worse and I began to notic the fine hairs around the corners of my mouth (which I did bleach but only once a month or so)_ were thicker and darker and needed bleaching twice a week!I then noticed hair beginning to grow by my collarbones too! I am now on 3rd&last packet_&did not take a break for a withdrawal bleed due to nurse's advice as had suffered split condom during sex whilst still within 7days of having finished an antibiotic so needed the morning after pill.

No weight gain_ no mood swings_ no cramps_ no period. A word of advice_ please remember that everyone reacts differently to different brands of birth control.  It is true that you have to give your body a good 3 months to adjust.  Jumping from one BC to another is not the answer.,F,34,6  months,3/13/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
281, 1, Regulate my cycle,Cramps_ lower back pain_ tenderness/swelling of breast. Constant bloating_ gained 5 lbs. in one month_ sluggish and mood swings_ headaches_ bad dreams. More emotional than ever.,I really hate this pill_ I am so glad to find this site. I called the nurse before my second pack_ She told me_ I needed to be on it 3 months. to feel the full effect of this medicine. I am into my second Month. I called my Drug store and taked with the pharmacy. I will call the RN tomorrow_ I am taking myself off. I can not live like this. I have a 2 year old son who depends on me. I was on another Birth contol that I never had problems with. This is new and I was told how great it is. Not for my body. I hope something is inforced to really say what the side effects are for most people. It is sad to have to go online and look up the birth control you are on. But this site has made me feel so much better_ Thanks to all who have been honest.,F,40,33  days,3/12/2009Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
282, 4, Regulate Periods,Tiredness_ breast tenderness.,I am taking the generic version of Loestrin.  I am taking Junel Fe.  I just finished my 3rd month on the pill.  First month had some cramping_ tiredness and breasts hurt.  Second month...only experienced tiredness and breast tenderness.  Third month only experienced tiredness.  I highly recommend you stay on the pill for at least 3 months.  Normally after 3 months many bad symptoms go away.  I use to get my period 2-3 times EACH month.  Now I only get once a month_ for about 3 days.  The only bad side effect I can say I still experience is being tired.,F,38,3  months,2/25/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
283, 1, Regulate cycles,HORRIBLE!!  First came the headaches_ then came the sore breasts_ and finally SEVERE ANXIETY AND MOOD SWINGS.  I worried about EVERYTHING.,Thank goodness for this site!  I really thought I was going crazy!  The crying and sadness is more than I ever expected.  I have only been taking this for one month_ and that is enough for me.  I will take heavy cycles over the mind games this medicine plays!!,F,36,30  days,2/23/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
284, 1, painful mentrual cycle,While taking these pills my side effects were tired_ mood swing _ and also painful cramps. I always had a painful mentrual cycle but when i took Loestrin it made it worst.My cramps were so bad that i was screaming and crying out load . It was a nightmare for me to ever to take these pills again.,,F,19,1  days,2/21/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
285, 1, Birth Control,EXTREME HEADACHES... i literally cant live my life because they are so horrible. acne got much worse_ NO SEX DRIVE_ nauseas_ very moody_ tired_ cant sleep at night. hate this pill!,I would not recommend this pill to anyone its horrible.,F,20,4  months,2/19/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
286, 1, Contraceptive_ lessen periods,Frequent urination_ nausea_ severe migraine_ emotional instability_ oversensitive_ irritable_ foggy thinking,This pill is horrible.  I have been on it for less than a week (after switching from Yaz)_ and it's already causing huge issues.The frequent urination is a nightmare_ I feel like I have to pee every 5 minutes.  The nausea is awful_ and the over emotional antics are already annoying me.  I would not recommend this pill to anyone.  I hate it.*Note_ I am on the generic Loestrin FE_ 1.5/30,F,24,5  days,2/16/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
287, 5, Birth Control,Perhaps skin is more prone to breakouts,I LOVE this pill_ and after reading some of the posts I have to make a clear distinction between LoEstrin 1.5/30 and LoEstrin 24...LoEstrin 24 is HORRIBLE_ while LoEstrin 1.5/30 is a Miracle! I first started on LoEstrin 24 and experienced the horrible side effects many people have referenced; severe moodiness_ decreased sex drive_ weight gain_ lots of crying. I was a different person and I hated it. After one year_ by some miracle error_ the pharmacist accidently typed in my refill as LoEstrin 1.5/30 and all of my problems went away. I felt like myself again_ my sex drive increased_ I had my fast metabolism back. I've been on LoEstrin 1.5/30 for about 7 years now_ and I have nothing but praise for the product. What a difference from LoEstrin24!! So the moral of this story_ LoEstrin 1.5/30 = AMAZINGLY AWESOME_ LoEstrin 24 = HORRIBLE. Also_ beware of generics_ the Microgestin 1.5/30 is good_ but I noticed some increased moodiness on the Junel generic version_ now I just stick to the name,F,28,7  years,2/13/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
288, 5, Pregnancy and hormones,The only side effect I got was just once. I had one day of break through bleeding in the first month that I started taking the pill. It only occurred once and it was just a bit.,I am very very satisfied with this product. It worked amazingly. Barely any side effects other than ONE day of breakthrough bleeding and it was really nothing. I am a runner and my gyno said that runners experience less side effects so I'd say that if you want less_ go for a short run or even a walk. Exercise is great for medication. Also_ my period was RIGHT when it was supposed to come_ lasted for 4 days_ it was really light and pretty much perfect_ and ended after 4 days_ right when it was supposed to. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone!,F,17,2  months,2/7/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
289, 3, Pregnancy protection and regularity,I have been on loestrin 24 fe. MY doctor recommended it because it was low dose and i told her i didnt want to gain weight so she was like try it. well everything was fine my period was coming from friday and gone sunday but now i have been on this for about a year and a half and the last 3-4 months ive had breakthrough bleeding. I was bleeding the week before i was supposed to start and then i pretty much bleed for a week....and its usually been like twice a month that i bleed...but this month has been horirble i got my period and then i was clear the following week i got it again.....then it cleared up....then it came down for a day and was gone and now this weekend im supposed to get it...because it is the placebo days...i cant take it anymore....i feel horrible that its not as predictable as when i first got on it and now my sex life has gone a bit down the drain...ahh im frustrated im sad...i feel like my body has gone insane..i know it might be because of the low dose.,,F,21,1.5  years,2/3/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
290, 4, Birth Control_ Regulating Periods,some weight gain_ increased appetite_ breast tenderness_ extreme increase in sexual drive_ headaches_ breakthrough bleeding_ not a terrible pill tho,I have been on this pill many times and off many times everytime I go on I almost instantly start putting weight on always 6-10 pounds and am STARVING all the time this typically wears off and in about 3 months I am then able to start trying to get the weight off_ I find that if I don't take the pill at the same time almost to the second I get breakthrough_ when it gets closer to the time I need to take my pill I sometimes get a headache_ these never upset my stomach or have any other real side effects I have been on a lot of different pills and this is probably the best the thing that is different about this than others is I have a sex drive now that is starting to wear out my boyfriend I dunno if thats a good or bad thing but most other pills decrease ur sex drive and dry you up this is the complete opposite,F,23,3  months,2/2/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
291, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain_ depression_ acne worsened_ breakthrough bleeding_ sometimes multiple periods a month_ and CHIN hair.  have been taking for several months now.,I was placed on this because I had family history of a blood clotting disorder.  After tests came back_ I was in the clear for the disorder_ but my gyno insisted I try sticking with this BC anyhow.  After reading the other comments on it here_ I feel like maybe I'm not going insane.  I'm asking to be taken off this stuff immediately.  And what is with Dr.s not listening to their patients?!,F,26,5  months,2/2/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
292, 5, Contraceptive/ stop ovarian cysts,No negative side effects whatsoever.,I love this pill and would reccommend it to anyone.  You have to give it the full three months before your body adjusts. Have been on this pill (or the generic_ Microgestin) since 1998_ so 11 years. Tried 6 other brands over the course of 18 months_including Ortho-tricyclene and Triphasil_ and this was the only one that didn't make me sick to my stomach or have irregularity. My periods became predictable to the hour_ were very light_ and lasted only 3-4 days (before this birth control they were heavy and lasted a full 7 days). I never lost my sex drive_ on the contrary.  I did not gain some weight_ and my breasts increased in size a little_ but that is expected with just about any birth control pill. The thing with birth control is that it has to closely match the levels of hormones in your body_ so this may not be a good choice for some.,F,30,11  years,1/25/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

294, 1, Birth Control,Unpredictable periods_ 2-3 periods a month_ heavier and longer periods than before,I HATE this pill!  I was on Triphasil and it's comparable generic for 15 years and never had a problem.  My Dr. convinced me after the birth of my 2nd child to try Loestrin due to the lower hormone levels_ etc.  He never warned me of the side effects or potential problems.  I had my period 2-3 times each month at random times for the first 3 months.  Then I went 2 months with no period.  Now_ again_ for the past 2 months_ I am back to unpredicatable_ heavier_ longer periods.  I made an appointment today to get OFF of these horrible pills!!!!,F,31,7  months,1/21/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

297, 3, For severe cramps,lighter flow_ spotting occasionally_ more emotional then usual.,Ok_ so I'm on the generic equivalent of Loestrin FE_ I'm on Microgestin Fe 1.5 / 30. I've been on it for a almost a year. I wasn't having any issues  with it until late November_ when the University's Health Services was late placing my prescription order. When I started the pack for Dec._ I was told to double up on the pill for the first day (meaning I took two pills one day and then one pill every day after that).  Since then_ every time I hit the END of the second week of pills in the pack_ I start bleeding. I talked to a gynocologist three weeks ago_ and she had said that after three months if it hasn't stopped to come back. This is technically month 2_ and I'm pretty upset. Has this happened to anyone else? Is there any advice that I can get?,F,24,2  months,1/9/2009,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

299, 1, Birth Control,Besides the breakthrough bleeding constantly. The second week into the pills i started bleeding and it never stopped. My doctor told me this was normal and could go on for three months. I also went batty_ i would go from being happy to crying to anger. My husband had to ask me to stop taking them because he could not deal with me anymore. As he put it he did not know what to say to me or what mood i would be in.

And I hadn't mailed in the scrip yet since I had samples (have to do it mailorder for the good deal with my insurance)_ but I figured it can't be that different can it?  Well_ almost every day since I started taking it I have had a couple hours of bleeding with small clots and bad cramps.  Then it will stop and I naively think that it's really stopped.  Yeah_ right.  After 2-3 days I mailed in my scrip for the correct meds.  After a couple more days I just stopped taking them.  That was yesterday.  I got another bout of the bleeding and cramps_ but am hopeful that this will be it.  My periods would still have heavy moments on the regular loestrin_ but this is much worse_ and I'm not supposed to be on my period!(I'd rather not have to call the doctor since I've been in enough this fall for other reasons and have an appointment in 2 weeks anyway....but,F,43,7  days,11/22/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

It comes right as I take the pill at the end of my nonexistant peroid. Extremely mild_ but obviously annoying_ any yeast infection is annoying. And after reading about decreased sexual appetite & vaginal dryness I know I'm not alone. This is frightening! AND I thought I was nuts but read another person has had darkening of the upper lip.

315, 5, Birth Contorl/ Extreme Bleeding,I have not really experienced anything too bad yet. Some breast tenderness is really all.,"I used to take this pill until it was discontinued from the Family Planning (Free). I was switched back and forth from pill to pill--Ortho Tricyclin (I had extreme moodiness & weight gain)_ Ortho Novum (I had severe headaches & low sex drive)_ Desogen (I had a lower sex drive)_ Alesse (Moodiness & severe headaches)... I started having SEVERE headaches with Ortho Novum and Alesse_ and just got so tired of putting up with them that I ended up just buying the Loestrin 1.5/30. I used to get the headaches/migraines almost every single day_ and haven't had one since I've been back on these pills (only 2 weeks_ but I think that's the reason). Loestrin did excellent for me a few years ago when I was taking it_ which is why I went back to it. It's the only pill that makes me fell ""normal"". You need to consider that everyone is different when taking BC pills though. It's more like a trial and error with the levels of estrogen and progestrin_ until you find the right thing",F,22,2  weeks,10/8/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Low to non-existent sex drive_ Increased emotionality with severe mood swings_ constipation.,I started taking this medication in May of '06 and for the first year and a half it was fine. I didn't experience any weight gain_ or notice any other side effects. Starting last fall I noticed that after engaging in intercourse I would come on my period_ which was a true nuisance. I didn't want my boyfriend to touch me at all - my sex drive was basically depleted. Also_ I noticed that when we did engage in sexual intercourse I was very dry down there and needed to use a lubricant. I never had these problems before I was on this medication. I haven't tried any other birth control pills_ but I doubt that I'll ever use this one again.,F,26,2.5  years,10/2/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I have been on this pill for about 6 months_ and I thought I was losing my mind until I read these testimonials.  I am moody and cry every month.  My lower back hurts to the point that it takes me a minute to stand up straight from a sitting position.  My breast hurt like they have never hurt before and I am still having serious break through bleeding.

STAY AWAY from this pill!!!,I started Loestrin about 5 months ago and I am stopping TOMORROW! I decided to ignore the headaches for the last couple of months along with the other symptoms due to the fact that I did not know what else to do for preventing pregnancy. A couple of days ago I started experiencing severe headaches to the point where it has been debilitating along with pains down my arms_ legs_ fingers and toes. The sympoms are so bad that I am seeing a neurologist and possibly having an MRI of my head. I am a healthy girl and have NEVER had anything like this happen to me. My only guess is Loestrin. I PRAY that I will feel better after I get off of this crazy drug! I hope my comments help anyone who is experiencing what I have gone through. This pill is poison!!

I did have one month where I only spotted_ but that was 6 months ago_ and it has not happened since. I never gained weight or felt anxious. I think this pill was best for me. Try talking to a doctor first before taking this. It probably depends on your body and hormones as to whether this is the best pill for you.,F,23,2  years,9/19/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

As soon as I switched to a different pill{low ogestral}I no longer had pain. I also had breakthrough bleeding with every pack as soon as I hit the third week and it would last for ten days or more. The mood swings were crazy_ I think my husband thought I was going nuts! Maybe this pill just wasnt right for me_ but I wouldnt recommend it. Also_ my insurance didnt want to cover it. I had to switch pill brands or it was $60.,F,24,3  months,9/18/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Everyone around me says I'm a different person now. I use to enjoy hanging out and relaxing_ watching a movie or just chating. Now I can't stop moving. It's hard for me to sit and relax. I'm always tired no matter how much sleep I get. I'm always hungry even after i eat a big meal. It's ridiculous. I didn't know if I was going to have a period or I would have a spot and that's it.

I start crying uncontrolably for the stupidest reasons(ex:very small arguement with bf or a machine at a store is not working right).Whether I'm at work or somewhere else. The only good thing that came from this pill was my boobs got bigger. This is the third or fourth pilled i've tried.  I'm finally switching to ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo hopefully this one will be a perfect match.

Completely moody - to the point where my boyfriend won't even talk to me today_ in addition - I am hungry constantly!  My breasts are getting bigger (and that was totally not needed!)

It's my first BCP I've ever taken. This is the third day I've taken it. On this website_ and many others_ I've noticed a lot of women have had a significant weight gain. I've recently just lost 20 pounds this summer after gaining my ""freshman 15"". I'm worried that I too will gain what I spent my summer losing. If you are woman who has gained weight due to Loestrin_ will you please e-mail me stating: how long you've been taking Loestrin_ how long after taking this pill you started noticing weight changes_ how much you've gained_ if the weight ever dropped after a certain period of time_ etc? Also_ if you've switched your birth control due to weight gain_ what type helped to prevent weight gain? I would like to know about when I should start concerning over my physical changes.

My Dr. put me on it because I was having very frequent and painful periods along with my menopausal symptoms. I was extremely nauseated the 1st week coupled with a huge appetite...go figure! Then the headaches set in! Severe headaches with horrible pains behind my eyes! I experienced a complete loss of energy and interest in anything_ which is the opposite of how I am normally. I slept every afternoon for 8 of the 9 horrible days I was on this pill! By far my worst experience ever on a medication! I would not take the chance on this pill! I would rather put up with the pain and frequency of my periods!!!,F,44,9  days,8/13/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
331, 2, Prevent Pregnancy,None at first - a year later my body freaked,I loved this pill_ I didn't gain any weight_ I didn't experience mood fluxes_ I thought I had FINALLY found a pill I was happy with. About a year in_ I had a double period one month_ the next month I was late_ the month after that I had another double (by that point I had contacted my dr and he told me to triple my pills for the remainder of the month and then start over normal. My cycle was normal while my pills were tripled but as soon as I went back to one a day_ my body freaked.)_ the next month I had spotting and a period for the entire month. Not to mention I was crazy hormonal. I only weigh 120 so a low dose should in theory_ not have been a prob for me. My dr told me AFTER the fact that this can happen within a year due to the low dose of the pill. Wish I would have know that before hand.,F,24,1.2  years,8/5/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Turns out_ I don't have cramps and Im not getting sharp pains thanks to Loestrin. It seems that as a person who has not had any problem with birth control before (I was on Yasmin before_ but my body got used to it) that Loestrin has not effected me in any way yet.  So I reccommend this pill to someone who generally does not react poorly to birthcontrol hormones or even medication in general.,F,20,14  days,7/31/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

The first 2 weeks on the pill breast tenderness_ bloating_ gained 7 lbs. 3 weeks started light spotting and my moods have become very steady_ no more mood swings. I lost the 7 lbs. and I don't crave sweets like i used to.  I almost quit taking the pill_ now i am glad I hung in there things are much better. I am pre-menopausal and my night sweats have stopped.

337, 1, Birth Control,Recurrent UTIs_ kidney infection,Triphasil and Yasmin both caused prolonged dysfunctional uterine bleeding. I've been on Loestrin 1.5/30 for 4 months now. No other side effects except chroin_ recurrent UTIs which I have NEVER had in my life. Ever. I've been hospitalized with 2 kidney infections in the past 6 weeks_ and I have been symptomatic (frequent urnination_ constantly feeling like I have to urinate_ urethra spams_ etc) for the past SEVENTEEN DAYS. This pill is HORRIBLE! I've ceased using it as of today and will never touch it with a 10 foot pole again!,F,32,4  months,7/29/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
338, 5, Birth Control,Rarely have periods - maybe only once a year or year and a half (which I am VERY glad for). No other side effects that I am aware of - been on this pill too long to know otherwise.,I have been on this pill so long that it is unknown how I would be otherwise. I am never depressed or moody. Glad that I very rarely have periods. I do NOT take the generic version_ the generics are not manufactured the same and break apart in bits too easily_ compromising the integrity of the hormones.,F,33,18  years,7/20/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I had previously been taking Ortho Lo and had panic attacks and depression_ but microgestin changed this.

343, 1, birth control,mood swings_ extreme anxiety_ weight gain,wow!  i suddenly don't feel so crazy.  i've been on various birth controls for several years now but none have regulated my period.  my doctor switched me to loestrin 2 months ago.  the first month i still had break-through bleeding but this month i got my period when i was supposed to.  however_ within a week of beginning the pills_ i began to feel extremely anxious all the time.  i felt nervous and hyped-up and anxious all the time - certain noises or sensations began giving me the chills.  i thought i was going crazy before i realized that the only thing that had changed in my life were these pills.  i kept thinking that it would get better and it has only slightly improved.  so___i'm done.  there are so many pills out there - makes no sense to torture yourself with a bad one.one other side effect - my boobs are ginormous.,F,30,2  months,7/8/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

345, 2, to regulate cycle,EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN_ Tired all the time_ moody,Before reading other ratings I thougt that I was just gaining weight. Now I realize that it's got to be this pill. I was on OrthTricyclen for 6 years. My doctor recommended Loestrin Fe. Since I've been on this pill (3 1/2 months) I've gain about 25 lbs and I'm always hungry_ craving junk_ and in need of a nap as soon as I get off. My students tell me that I'm very moody now and that I either happy or mad. This pills make me feel bipolar. I'm switching back ASAP!!!,F,26,3  months,7/7/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
346, 5, birth control,missed periods,I've been on this pill for a very long time and I all I can say is that it has worked VERY well for me. I have no problem with irregular bleeding or sex drive (unless you count wanting it every day a problem!). I have to say that if you're having side effects you just need to try a different kind of pill. Hormones are tricky things to regulate and you shouldn't stay on something that makes you miserable. My only side effect is that I skip periods occasionally. I tried Tricyclen Lo for a while to see if it would help_ but went back to Loestrin. Also_ I DO NOT use generic - for me there was a noticable difference when I tried them.,F,35,12  years,7/1/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
347, 5, Birth control.,None that I am aware of.,I have found this to be an excellent pill. It eliminated the crippling menstrual cramps that I got both off the pill and while taking Tricylene. If fact_ I have no period at all since starting Loestrin. This is wonderful: affordable_ store-bought monthly home pregnancy tests allow me to be sure nothing has gone wrong.,F,32,8  years,6/28/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
348, 2, To regulate my period,I have been taking this pill for about 2 and alf weeks now and i have been spotting for the past 2 days and i have been extreamly depressed for the past 3 days. I brokedown crying all day yesterday and i didn't no why but after reading this website i now see why. I have had very bad mood swings and crampsa also.,I wouldn;t reccomend this pill to anyone but then again it has only been 2 weeks so maybe it will get better. But the depressin is bad. I have been digionised with depression ever since my father passed away when i was 17 which was 2 1/2 years ago so this does not help me at all.,F,20,13  days,6/25/2008Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
349, 4, To get my body regulated on BC,The first time I had to take the iron pills at the end I was SO sick.  They messed up my stomach for DAYS.  Now on my third month they haven't done that to me again_ the only thing is that you need to eat with them otherwise they will make you sick.  I did have some mood swings (my loving fianace' told me) and I did have some soreness all over my body at first.  For someone who was never on birth control at all it did a number on me at first.  But per the doctor_ I stuck it out and it seems to have worked.,,F,22,3  months,6/20/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
350, 3, Birth Control_ lighter periods.,Bad: Extreme moodiness_ irritability_ anxietyGood: larger breasts_ light period once a month,I have switched birth control pills three different times. I took Cycessa first_ but it didn't seem to make a bit of a difference. Then_ I started taking LoestrinFe but it hardly had any hormones in it and caused a lot of spotting and i would have my period for weeks at a time.  I haven't been taking this pill for very long_ but it has definitely lightened my periods and i have no spotting.  My sex drive hasn't been effected.  My breasts have gotten bigger which is a plus.  The only complaint i have about this pill is that i'm very very moody.  I cry very often and I get really anxious about everything.  It's so frustrating_ but i think my body just needs to adjust to the hormone level_ because doctors have said to wait 3 months to let your body get used to the pill before you decide to switch. I'll keep you posted.,F,19,7  weeks,6/9/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

My usual periods would last about 3-5 days... and with this birth control it was like I was having a period every week!!! 3 or 4times a month... it's crazy!I am now getting off of Loestrin.

I have a headache for 2 days_ which is not a full headache_ just a jarring pain on the side of my head.  I am usually energetic and ready to go_ but this past week I keep falling asleep at my computer and watching tv.  I have never had a migraine and rarely have headaches_ so I am assuming the pain in my head is from the pill along with me being tired so much.  I am glad to see that I am not loosing energy just because.  I am taking bc for the first time in 16 years to regulate my period.  I think having an irregular period is better than feeling this way.,F,39,8  days,6/7/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Very light spotting for 5 days_ none for 3_ and then my period began.,(I'm taking the generic for this brand which is Junel FE 1.5/30)I've suffered from SEVERE pms for years and never knew I could actually feel normal around that time of the month!

I spotted for all 3. Previously ive tried Yasmin_ Marvelon_ Othro-Tricyclen and had late cycle spotting with all. LoEstrin did not cure my spotting and has increase my appetite.

The only trouble is controlling my hunger. No matter how much I eat I still feel hungry! Thank goodness I know how to control myself otherwise I would have gained a bunch of weight.My sex drive is also a little awkward. There are days I really_ really want it_ and there are days I don't even want to hear about it. Other than that_ I pretty much feel like myself.,F,22,2  months,5/21/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

So iam scared about that? it seems yo be  normal but I think that you should get a period once a month so I might want to change this. i do not recommend this to prevent a baby because this is stressful to go through every month!!,F,23,1  days,5/21/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
359, 3, birth control,Apparently depression_ moody_ weight gain!!!!,After reading these comments_ I realized my mood swings and constant stress and depression may be linked to this pill. I gained almost 20 lbs in the last 4 to 5 months. I was thinner when I gave birth to my daughter back in July. I don't fit into my after pregnancy clothes and that's depressing!  I was on Lexapro for about 2 months and thought the weight gain was from that but I stopped them and lost nothing. I just stopped taking this pill a couple of days ago.

This is alot because I had been losing weight steadily and I work out 3-5 times a week.  After the first month (non-stop bleeding) my periods became lighter.  I have been lethargic and tired_ and others have noticed my bad moods.  I feel like I'm angry all the time - this is SO not me!  I know it has not been very long but I don't want to continue to live this way.  My other option is surgery_ but at this point_ it is more desirable than this.,F,47,3  months,5/6/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I had been on Ortho TriCyclen for 6 years prior to having my son and my period like clock work.  After I had him_ I had continuous bleeding every month on the other pills.  I did hate the first 3 mths of this pill_ but the side effects leveled off.  My dr told me to just get through 3 mths.  Every few mths I do skip my period which is freaky_ but in other months I may have 2 mini periods.  Kind of a rotation cycle.,F,27,12  months,4/28/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I have crazy mood swings_ the LITTLEST things set me off and put me in a mood.  I have no energy and am tired constantly.  I've cried over random things and things that happened months ago.  Sex drive has decreased.  This is by far the worst birth control pill I have ever been on.  The only good side effect was i have no cramps_ but then again nor do I have a period_ and yes my boobs have gotten larger_ with of course the tenderness that is so bad touching them hurts.

I only had naseau during the first week or two_ and in the first month I broke out on my upper arms and shoulders. I occasionally woke up sweating in the middle of the night maybe the first 2 months. I am getting occasinal headaches which I never used to get! So I will keep an eye on that. My breasts have been very tender this month_ they are also larger. I have had no weight gain. Sometimes I feel sad_ but I am not really any different emotionally than I was before. My periods have been brown spotting for about 2 days_ not really periods_ and I get heavy bloating about 1 day of the month where I couldn't suck my stomach in if my life depended on it! I take the pill at 2pm everyday_ I set my phone alarm_ that has been working out well. I am also keeping track of any side effects to see if they fall at the same time of the month.

(oddly enough during those two days_ I also had a blood vessil rupture in my right eye_ which I think had something to do with the headaches and the Nuvaring_ but that is just my opinion)  So I stopped the Nuvaring.

Now that we are ttc I came off the pill.  Im scared of what will happen to my body now that I am off.  We are going to ttc in a few months bc i heard that you need to wait at least 3 months or until you have a normal period.  I also have to say that this pill did cause me to gain weight.

For the first few days I was very tired and it took a lot of effort to drag myself out of bed in the morning_ but I've been fine since. My breasts are pretty tender in the days leading up to my period but not enough to be a signifigant problem. My periods are now only about 2 days_ and the amount of pain from cramps has reduced drastically.

My periods have been so unpredictable and I thought I might be pregnant with all the symptoms I am having_ but am not.  I have had my first ever migraines while taking this.  I also have experienced horrible mood swings along with some depression.  This is very out of character for me.

I don't want to blame being tired and less motivated strictly on the pill because I think that is a mental thing that can be fixed with the right mindset. However_ if you are experiencing nausea and heavier periods I would defiantly recommend switching pills because this one is obviously not working for you!  *Also_ before switching make sure you are taking the pill at exactly the same time.. if you're not this could be the root of your problems.,F,19,1  days,1/16/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Works for me_ but it is pretty important that you take it at roughly the same time every day (I've found that plus or minus 2 hours is fine) - brush your teeth_ take your pill...,F,49,17  years,1/2/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
419, 4, Birth Control,Spotting_ longer and irregular period,I posted a rating on 9/10/07 after my first month was done with few side effects_ spotting mid month and bloating. I have now completed my 5th cycle on this pill.  My sex drive_ skin_ hair_ weight_ and mood are fine.  All minor emotional outburts settled and bloating calmed down after the 3rd month.  I have a healthy diet and exercise regularly_ and I think this matters greatly.  The body responds accordingly based on its health.  The only thing I noticed and my advice to a new user is to be exact with your pill time.  It is TOO easy to spot or get an irregular pill if you delay even a couple of hours or if you miss one pill at any time during the month.  You must be perfect.  I now have made a commitment to take it EXACTLY at 9:30 p.m. every single night.  I've tested this theory out in 5 months_ and all spotting_ lengthy periods_ or irregular periods have occurred when there has been the slightest error.  It requires consistency_ but I'd rather stick with it  than play around with a,F,28,5  months,1/2/2008,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
420, 2, BC & minimize pain & heavy bleeding,I am so happy to have found this site!!! Since beginning this pill 3 months 1 week ago_ I have not had a period at all!  I have taken several pregnancy tests and NADA!  Also_ severe headaches (thought it was the holiday season rush)_ mid-section bloating_ crying over everything (commented to my husband that I had no idea what was going on with me)_ very tender breasts_ weight gain_ some acne (never had skin problems!)...I have been on oral BC since 15 (I am 34 now) and these side effects are very significant.  Thanks to all of you for posting.,,F,34,3  months,12/28/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
421, 2, My first BC,slight weight gain_depression_mood swings_rage_insomnia.,Loestrin was my very first BC and for the first month and a half I liked it. Although I seemed to be fighting with my husband for no reason_ I was tired all the time_ and I would get depressed from time to time. I really didnt think it was the pill but now that I look back on it_ my behavior wasnt like me. It wasnt until today that my doctor decided to switch me to another BC because I had thick brown discharge which was only old blood. My last period only lasted for 1 day and a half_ and also_ this gave me a rash like (yeast infection) so Loestrin didnt work out for me!,F,22,2  months,12/21/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
422, 5, Unbearable PMS,Brief violent cramps with sporadic bleed. Slight increase in headaches_ but paracetemol based painkillers are compatible. Anxiety increased during 'Pill-free' week.,Since I was prescribed the pill (in June) my PMS is non-existant - complete relief_ because my PMS had been making my life hell and affecting my relationship with my husband. I would endure the PMS at it's worst and spend the rest of the month dreading it! Now I feel more settled. I had suffered agonising water retention and mastalgia; both have been alleviated. I have only had two bleeds; the cramps were bad but only lasted for a day or so. I now 'double-up'_ taking two pill cycles one after another_ because I felt very 'angsty' during the 'Pill-free' week. So 'doubling-up' reduces the number of 'Pill-free' weeks per year. I would recommend Loestrin 30 outright_ as it is very easy to use. As with all similar drugs_ make sure you establish a routine that fits in with your daily life (taking at a set time during your work-day). It is an excellent product for alleviating PMS.,F,41,6  months,12/18/2007Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
423, 5, switched off of ortho tri cyclen,Very few. A pimple here or there but they used to be much worse...never having had pimples til I was 28 I had to adjust but there are definitely worse things.  A positive side effect is the return of my sex drive which had almost instantaneously disappeared when I turned 35.  Yay Loestrin and yay me! :),I have taken birth control since I was 19 and am now 36.  Loestrin 24 is the best birth control I have ever taken-hands down...and I have tried most of them.  I have lost my PMS craving for sugar and have even LOST WEIGHT- -which never happens to me from any medication.  The other pills gave me intense PMS (like constant road rage- -without being on the road...lol)_ bloating_ gaining a quick 15 pounds when starting it that I could never lose_ and all around miserable feeling with 5-6 pound weight gain and loss every month.  As a side note please ladies STAY AWAY FROM YAZ!!  This stuff does bad things to you including reducing your potassium which...ooops! happens to cause spider veins among other problems.  Like we need any more things to be worried about!  For me YAZ has been ecclipsed only by the Depo Provera shot- -which I won't even begin to comment on.

Ive gained 10 lbs_ especially in the mid section and my breasts have gotten noticeably bigger.  I always felt tired_ moody_ depressed_ and just bad about myself and life.  I cried a lot at work and was very emotional.  I had night sweats_ a weird rash of dark bumps beneath my breasts_ in the creases of my elbows and the back of my knees_ and random one-off spots on my back_ stomach and legs.  Also_ I had NO sex drive.  I thought that I was just making a mess of my life because of stress or work but now that I am off it I see a HUGE difference.  I am on Yaz now and so far so good.

I switched to loestrin because the last pill I was on was giving me MAJOR mood swings and I was cramping alot.

I've been very moody; it seems like everything gets on my nerves. I'm always tired_ which could be the result of a full class schedule and a part-time job. I'm admittedly slightly depressed. The breast tenderness hasn't been horrible_ but noticeable still. My sex drive is nonexistant_ which hasn't been doing wonders for my long-term relationship.

Periods are usually 4 days long and light.I have been on 12 different pills over the course 24 years and usually have only stopped using them to have babies. What I don't like about Loestrin is that I have developed very red bumpy skin on my face...I was always blessed with good skin. Everyone who has known me for a long time comments on the change (as if I am not already aware!!!). I also have VERY low sex drive which makes keeping my husband of 17 years happy very difficult. AND extra weight has become very hard to shed. I gained 12 pounds in one month...and I already had 15 to lose. I have been on it for almost 2 years and I actively have tried to lose weight..in weight watchers...but my weight does not budge! This is very upsetting. My ww leaders are stumped!!!

I had to go buy new clothes this week as none of my old ones fit any more. I went to the doctor and had my thyroid checked because I have an under active thyroid and I thought it was off but it was not and all my blood work came back normal. I found this website and was so glad that I am not losing my mind_ I wasn't sure why I was going through all of this.

I have always enjoyed my job but for the last couple of months my job has become very overwhelming.  I have had two crying spells at work.  I have been extremely tire.  I blamed all of this on my job.  I even requested to drop my hours at work because I felt it was becoming an over load.  I became curious when my supervisor asked me was there anything else causing me problems.  She also offered the Chaplain to me.  I then began to evaluate any changes in life which also included medications.  I decided to research this Microgestinsince it was the only new medication I have taking.

It was working fine like the package said it would_ but I stopped taking it because I did not need it (stopped having sex). But I started retaking it 4 months ago when I became sexually active again and this time the side effects were different.  It stopped by period completely and I have noticed that I have gotten considerably fuller in my belly region.  I have taken 4 pregnancy tests- all negative.  I stopped taking it about a months ago and i still look fat (which is strange to me- someone who was always fit with a 28 inch waist and ran track for years)  and my period is still MIA.

My doctor told me the weight gain would subside once my body got used to the pills_ but that hasn't been the case. I used to take Desogen and actually lost weight_ but my insurance doesn't cover it anymore.

I also took orthortricyclen and it made me sick so this seems to be the only birth control pill my body will accept. This is pretty good I like the very short very light periods but the only problem is sometimes I do not get my period at all and that worries me...I do not enjoy spending my money on pregnancy tests.

First month i didnt even have a period_ second month I had a period for over 5 days with horrible cramps_ nothing has changed.

I'm hoping that there is no reason for my body to react poorly in the long-term.  The extra period was annoying_ but I'm chucking it up to physical adjustment. It was not a real period_ more like my period was ""going away"" for 10 days_ water/blood mix.  Then it came normal on time. I've never been on the pill before and I'm 28.

My periods are very light (what woman wouldn't love a 3 day period!) but this month I haven't even started my period yet which was freaking me out a lot!!

After only the second day of taking this pill_ I came down with a depression. I didn't know at the time that it was all linked to Loestrin_ but it made sense because all of my moodiness_ anxiety_ and depression sparked up at the time that I started this pill. On top of all of the emotional side-effects_ I have no had my period yet_ and I am now on my third pill pack. I suspect that the high progestin_ low estrogen level that's in this pill is responsible_ so I'm opting for one that's lower in progestin--specifically_ Ovcon 35. Hopefully this works out for me!

I am a very active and athletic female and since taking loestrin I am constantly feeling bloated. In the first few weeks of taking loestrin I often had headaches and felt tired.

It's called Microgestin tab 1.5/30. I do NOT recommend this medicine at all. I am a very cheery_ upbeat and outgoing person; BUT this medicine made me have mood swings so severe my family_ friends_ and boyfriend were very concerned about me. This pill has made me feel slight nasuea after taking it and intense drowsiness. I took it right before I went to bed because it was so severe. It worked well for me for about 3 months_ but after that it was all downhill. I have now switched to Yasmin and it is so much better! I am now back down to my regular weight of 121. (I weighed 137 on Microgestin..definately not normal for me); I no longer have mood swings_ and I do not experience sickness after taking the pill.

I am lacking in energy like never before in my entire life. I am horribly moody and am usually feeling depressed like I don't care about anything. The only positive is that my breasts are larger.

I no longer suffer from heavy periods and painful cramps. My mood is somewhat stabilized.  My first two packets_ My body and mind was going crazy...abrupt crying_ night sweats_ irratability.  No one wanted to be near me.  My friends even noticed.  I started getting worried when my period lasted for two weeks.  I called my doctor and they advised that I keep taking the pill and that my body is trying to adjust to the pill.So now I am on my third packet and I am feeling a little better..no period_ no cramps.  I do get depressed sometimes but it only happens when i miss a pill..

I started taking it at night_ and at least the nausea and headaches are gone_ but my chin is now so inflamed that I have swollen lymph nodes under my jaw_ and I still have to be really careful not to yell at anyone because I know I'm being irrational.

I had never been diagnosed with fibroids. I actually could feel them on top of my lower abdomen and I thought I had a growth so I called my doctor and he ordered a pevic ultrasound. My diagnosis was fibroids. I went off the Loestrin and had major hot sweats for 2 months. I gained 10 pounds on this pill all in my belly. Being off the pill has lead to a shrinkage of the fibroids_ at 3 months the hot flashes stopped and I am very very slowly losing the weight at being off for 6 months. I still have a little bit of residual dizziness. I have decided to never go back on a birth control pill again. Prior to taking this pill I was very healthy and active with normal weight. I think it could take another 6 months to get back to normal.,F,44,6  months,6/28/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I have never felt like this and after reading this website I am convinced it's due to this pill.  I have been taking it for 10 months now and for the first 8 months I had on/off breakthough bleeding.  I am really tired constantly even though I get enough sleep every night. I eat sensibly but I have gained a stone on this pill_ I even tried the Atkins diet to try and lose some of it but this proved extremely difficult! I also feel dizzy and just plain weird!

Since taking Loestrin I have been taking water relief tablets too and did lose some of the extra wieght within days. I do still feel hungry most of the time and am a bit fed up with with having spotting of brown blood for a week after my period finished (perhaps due to the lower dosage too?) but I have only been on it 2 weeks so perhaps this wont last.,F,24,14  days,5/30/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Sex drive is back to normal_ and no cramps or PMS (not that I had any cramps or PMS with the Ortho). The only issue that I have with Loestrin is the lack of a period! The first two months I had a normal 4-5 day period_ but after that_ nada. At first I thought it was due to pregnancy_ so I had a blood test done. It was negative. Then I took in my stress level. Stress can cause a missed period_ and mine was high because we just purchased a new home_ but that was over a month ago and no period still._ but then I found this website_ which makes me think that it might not be stress either. I never thought Id say it_ but I miss my period. This has caused many pregnancy worries for me and my boyfriend_ and I am still trying to get used to it.,F,22,5  months,5/25/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I see this as a good thing rather than a bad side effect.Usually_ side effects are just there when you first go on the pill and then go away as time passes.  For me_ the elimination of cramps and vulvar pain far outweighs a few pimples and hunger and even outweighs monthly headaches.,F,35,3  years,5/23/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

565, 5, to prevent pregnancy,I have been on micronor for years because Ortho Tri Cyclen gave me horrible headaches. The lack of estrogen was great on the micronor_ but i wanted a more reliable pill because I am not so great at taking them at the same time. I have been on Loestrin for 2 months_ with only a slight headache around the beginning of my brown pills. I absolutely love it.,My only concern is that i have no period. I have always had a very light period_ 2-3 days. But since taking Loestrin I have not had one. I am perfectly fine with the lack of one but I am concerned with how I know I am pregnant_ should it happen?

569, 5, Fibroid Relief,Breakthrough bleeding_ slight depression the first month.,I've been on Loestrin for 5 months now and I absolutely love it!  I started taking it to reduce the amount of days and heaviness of my periods.  I use to have to wear both a pad and tampon and change both every hour.  Now_ my periods are 2-3 days long and very light.  I did notice that if I didn't take the pill the same time everyday_ I would have breakthrough bleeding.  Now that I take it at the same time EVERYDAY I no longer experience this side effect.  I would recommend it to anyone who is suffering from heavy periods due to fibroids.,F,36,5  months,3/3/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Seemed like every morning I woke up with a new pimple!  Made my skin really oily- couldn't wait to get home everyday to wash my face! Never had a period at all in 6 months- wasted lots of money of pregnancy tests.  Gained about 4 pounds despite active exercise and watching what I eat.  I've always been stable with my weight and never really had to watch my calories.  Couldn't wait to go off this pill.  Trying Estrostep next.,F,33,6  months,3/1/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I don't think I let my body readjust from the hormones the IUD had so when I started these pills was pretty emotionally unstable. Overall the side effects were not that bad except the mood swings.,F,27,3  months,2/28/2007Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Obviously it did lighten my period_ but I do not want to go through month after month wondering if I am pregnant.  The side effects that I experienced out weighed the positives to this pill.  I decided to stop it completely.,F,27,5  months,2/27/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
575, 5, Menstrual Cycle Regulation,No cycle and clearer skin. During the 4 days of placebos (iron pills) I am very emotional_ experience occasional headaches/cramps and have an increased sex drive.,I have been on BC for about 10 years and have tried many including Desogen_ OrthoTriCyclen_ OrthoCyclen_ Estrostep_ Ovcon and Apri. The majority of the pills (excluding EstroStep and Ovcon) were not strong enough and I experienced terrible periods--extremely heavy bleeding coupled with cramping_ nausea and breakouts. Loestrin FE 1.5/30 has given me a long deserved break from painful periods; however light bleeding would be reassuring! While on the active hormone pills_ my sex drive is low which is dissappointing_ but at this point I would rather be a bit moody and save some money (Ovcon cost me $70 a pack)_ than suffer for a week with heavy bleeding/cramping and general discomfort.,F,26,4  months,2/26/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I was first on a lower dose then experienced breakthrough bleeding.  I have very light periods on the 1.5/30.  However_ I am always tired.  I've had a lot of blood work done and a doctor did mention it could be the pill and to talk to my gynecologist.  A friend of mine also told me she was on a pill that made her tired all the time and she switched.  I am going to call my gynecologist Monday and ask him if there's a pill similar to Loestrin but with less incidences of fatigue.  I'm a health nut so I can't think of any other reason why I would be so tired!,F,23,2.5  years,2/24/2007Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
578, 4, Severe Cramps_ Severe Mood Swings_,Some gain weight and some nausea_ and tiredness. All which was explained in the package.,I love this pill this is my first birth control pill.  I love it.  I gained some weight (not alot) that actually came in handy since I was slim.  My acne is the same my hair is not falling off.   I got my menstrual cycle a few days late.  I got it lasted 3 days which usually was about a week.  I barely had any cramps. And light to moderate flow which usually I was having to change tampons every one to two hours.  My mood swings have decreased.  Actually I am emotional. Instead of trying to beat up everyone I cry. Not dramatically but Rachel on Friends type.  My sex drive is the same. Did have some nausea_ but I just eat before I take it.  I do feel a litle more tired though.  My fiance says he prefers for me to emotional he can handle that. Could not handle biting his head off.,F,25,1  months,2/21/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
579, 5, Birth Control,Slight weight gain each time I have started up the pill again.  Otherwise_ I have lighter periods & less cramping.  Keep in mind your body changes when you go off the pill as well - the 2 times I've stopped_ very bad hormonal changes including lots of acne and extreme sweating.,I've been on this pill & its generic microgestin for a total of 8 years.  First time for 4 years_ then stopped. Second time for another 4 years_ then stopped.  And now have been on it for 5 months again.  The only reason I stopped was beacause I was no longer in relationships.  This pill has never caused me any problems besides the initial weight gain each time I have gone on it_ approximately 5-10 lbs. But_ like any weight gain you can loose it.  I've also skipped doses many times over the years (1 day missed then just double up) and have taken at totally random times of day and it has not changed effectivness.,F,31,8  years,2/18/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

It has now been a month since I've stopped and I still haven't gotten my period_ though I have consistently received negative pregnancy test results. I finally did a quick search on the internet and found this website_ and realized that I had all the same symptoms everyone else complains about -- severe acne (I have always had clear skin)_ decreased sex drive_ mood swings_ and of course_ no periods.

Slightly hi tryglicerides (?) were reported in blood work a few years back.,After an accidental pregnancy this pill was prescribed to me and I have taken it since.  I pretty much don't think about the fact that I am taking this pill at this point.  If I were to stop taking this pill I think it would take some getting used to.  I intend to keep a closer eye on my blood work_ especially as I get older.  I am on Weight Watchers and I think the pill raises my weight baseline 3 to 5 pounds but otherwise I am on the same playing ground as anybody else when maintaining my weight.,F,38,11  years,2/6/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

The only thing I like about it is that I have regained my sex drive after three years on Yasmin.  The mental anguish of not having a period is too much for me to deal with each month. My appetite is huge resulting in a several pound weight gain. ( I am a very fit person_ not a couch potato). I am so snappy_ My poor husband! I will not continue with Loestrin_ there must be more suitable alternative to Yasmin out there.,F,43,2  months,1/27/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I appear to be a little more prone to headaches and stomach aches but this does not impact on my day to day life at all.,Ive tried one other pill and Loestrin is by far the better of the two. The other one caused mood swings_heavy bleeding and violent stomach aches around the time of my period but no such symtoms with this one and compared to the other I can handle the odd occasional head or stomach ache.,F,27,4  years,1/23/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

593, 1, Birth Control,Depression_ anxiety_ alternating long and short periods.  I will have a short period (2-3 days) one month and a long period (8-12 days) the following month.  My PMS seems to be getting worse the longer I'm on it.  The back pain is severe.  I have a history of Post Partum Depression and have recently started to have similar feelings (even though my kids are 18 months and older)_ which I can see that other women are having similar depression problems.  The fatige is horrible.  I never feel rested.  Again_ I never attributed the fatigue to the Loestrin until I read some of the other comments here.,Overall_ I'm not satisfied with the side effects of Loestrin.  To be fair though_ I do have a hard time finding a pill that I don't have side effects from.  I don't know if it's because of my body chemistry or because of the pills I have tried.  I'm due to go back to the doctor next month and plan to change prescriptions.,F,28,7  months,1/22/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Today I'm on the 5th white pill and I'm still spotting. Heavy period the second day_ though. I've also been having really sharp cramps in my abdomen. Honestly_ I thought something else was wrong since I was having headaches and feeling tired_ but after reading side effects here I can see it's more than likely the pill. Also_ REALLY expensive for a birth control! In my opinion anyways.,,F,23,1.5  months,1/18/2007,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

596, 2, painful periods_ contraception,occasional depression_ increase in breast size_ and possibly eczema and constipation,I was bumped up to the higher loestrin because that one failed to stop my period cramps. This one has never made my periods any better. I experienced some depression at the start and whenever I go on or off my pill break. During the 3 pill weeks I am chronically constipated and on the break I get diarrhea (I have IBS so that won't be this specific pill's fault) I've also mysteriously developed eczema on my breasts and fingers.

599, 4, Birth Control,No periods_ slight weight gain initially,I have not tried many different pills_ but I am generally happy with this one. I was surprised with the many comments made about depression and lack of sex drive as I haven't really experienced those effects. I did put on a couple of kg's in the first few months but my weight has remained the same over the years I have been taking it since then. I haven't had a single period in 5 years_ which worried me at first_ but my GP said this was normal so no longer think about it.

Anger in general.,I switched to this pill to stop the breakthru bleeding and it worked for about 2 months but for the last 4 months I have been bleeding every two weeks.  I get moody and don't want to even move some days.  I have no sex drive and don't want to be touched.  I am quitting this and getting an IUD.  After 10 years no more hormones for me.

Nuvaring was horrible_ switched to Yasmin_ which was HORRIBLE and listed on the top 10 worst drugs to take_ so I went back to Loestrin...my fav_ no side effects_ no weight gain_ wish I never stopped using it.  Just the higher price_ but you get what you pay for.  Some of the side effects that a lot of you mention are the side effects related to being on Cipro_ (quinolones or florquinolones)_ which is given a lot of the times for bladder /UTI infectons.  Just most people don't realize it...such as myself_ that caused major problems.  I am aware of those toxic pills now though_ and will NEVER take one again!  Maybe some of you have been on Cipro.,F,37,15  years,11/5/2006Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
619, 1, Doctor Recommended It.,I switched from the NuvaRing to Loestrin_ and after having been on it for about three or four months_ I'm switching pills.  As a sufferer of PMDD_ Loestrin has done nothing but amplify the emotional symptoms.  I am moody_ excessively depressed and lethargic_ irritable_ jealous_ insecure_ etc... all things I was not while on the NuvaRing.  Both myself and my boyfriend are at our wits' end with this pill.,This pill makes me feel like I am trapped inside my own head_ and like I am a completely different person than who I was before taking this horrid pill.,F,21,4  months,10/26/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
620, 3, Moods_ Perimenopause_ sex drive,Tender breasts only in the beginning_ some leg tingling_ weight gain_ not sure if moods are better or not (husband says they are)_ some leg cramping at night....still having some perimenopausal hot flashes and night sweats. Still low sex drive.,I am not sure what I am going to do_ stay on them or stop.  I have been reading everything I can and am not sure.  I love not having much of a period anymore and mine had become heavy.  That is a major factor for me.  Aside from that one plus_ I am not sure it is worth it.  Anybody my age have any ideas?  I may just go off for a month or so and see what happens.  I am not liking the weight gain!,F,43,7  months,10/25/2006Email,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
621, 4, birth control_ regulate period,very light periods_ clearer skin_ moods stabilized_ and gained a couple of pounds,loving the light to no periods thing - hoping they get even lighter. my mood swings aren't as bad as they used to be. the tiny weight gain is a good thing for me - I'm very slender. really hoping for a little weight gain in the breasts! my skin_ although not perfect_ looks better than it has in years. I have noticed a little of that melasma (hyperpigmentation of the skin)on my face_ though - that's not so good (but_ still better than the awful breakouts!). I'm taking the generic (Junel Fe 1.5/30) and so far it seems okay. I may try the brand name at some point just to see if there really is any difference. I've just started my second month of pills_ so we'll see how it goes. so far_ so good.,F,37,5  weeks,10/22/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
622, 3, Birth control/ Regulate period,"The first few months I took Loestrin I really had to adjust. I expierenced spotting and my period was irregular (this was because my dotor had me starting on the ""reminfer pills"" first)_ nausea_ and difficulty producing vaginal lubrication. However_ later my period became regular and super light ( I once thought that I was pregnant because I didnt have my period at all). I had no wieght gain_ light or no cramps_ and hardly any PMS.",Anyone who is looking for birth control/ something to regualte their period_ should consider Loestrin. Just be sure to start right or you will spend a lot of time getting back on rack. I was worried when I saw that my period was so light_ but now I couldn't be more happy about it. I save a lot of money on tampons.,F,18,9  days,10/17/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Terribly sore breasts 2 weeks before my period. Chest pains in months 2 and 3.Always tired and lathargic.,My doctor is trying to tell me I suffer from depression and it is not the pill_ however I've never felt like this before taking this pill. this pill is AWFUL! Going off this pill ASAP,F,24,3  months,10/12/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
624, 3, periods & brth control,"I am actually taking Loestrin 24 fe.  However_ it seems like the same thing based on everyone's reaction.  I FREAKED WHEN I DIDN'T MISS A PILL AND I HAD NO PERIOD.  All the negative pregnanacy tests were confusing--adding to the stress of not knowing.  This is_ without a doubt_ the most frightening thing.  I really wish my doctor would have warned me about this.  I read the label and called a pharmacist and neither of them knew this sort of thing was common.  I KNOW am going to call him and complain.  I don't have the mood swings_ but I have felt anxiety.  I guess I just thought it was ""me"" and didn't associate it with the pills.  Having a harder time losing weight_ but didn't gain more than 5.",In the pamphlet_ they should tell you that you may have no period and not be pregnant...maybe they did in the other kinds of Loestrin but NOT in the Loestrin 24 fe. I thought I was pregnant--despite numerous negative tests--until this web site.  If a woman wrote that pamphlet_ she would KNOW how important it is to include that snippet of info.  I am hostile that I it was not told/warned and think it shows the drug company's lack of judgement as well as empathy toward the patient,F,31,4  days,10/7/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
625, 1, Doctor recommended it,My side effects were awful. I had spotting week 2 continuing through week 4. I thought this might only be the first 3 months_ I am now in month 4 and started spotting 8 days after my period ended. I have had terrible mood swings_ severe depression_ can and will start crying at any second for no reason at all. I also have zero sex drive.My face has broken out like I was a teenager_ I have terrible dry skin patches on top of the breakouts. I have gotten off of this pill and gone back to Ortho-tricyclenlo_ it can't be any worse!,,F,30,4  days,10/4/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I took this one figuring it would be better than tri-cyclen on my hormones_ but I found it worse. I didn't find this beneficial one bit. Getting off.,Not for me_ but maybe for you. I highly say do not take this medecine if you are prone to depression.,F,21,4  months,9/25/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
628, 5, Birth control / regulate periods,NO SIDE MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS! And only in the last few months_ and only very minor_ during the inactive week of pills I become very emotional. I am willing to bet_ however_ that the hormonal fluctuation is exacerbating what I believe might be a moderate case of anxiety/depression - and not necessarily a result of Loestrin.  Also_ and not uncommon_ I do not tan easily at all.  I am prone to a rash from being out in the sun and it affects my abdomen_ upper arms_ legs (mostly thigh area)_ and chest/neck.  I'm also sensitve to SPF_ so I have to deal with the rash as best I can,This is by far the best BC pill for my body chemistry.  I have been taking Loestrin since I was 20 years old and not only do I believe that it helped balance out my weight during my periods and prevent bloating_ I have remained the same weight for the last 12 years_ which I think is very reassuring.  My periods have never lasted more than 2-3 days_ in fact_ a box of 20 tampons will last me for months!  Since I am in my prime child-bearing years_ I have had noticeable PMS - presumably from more drastic changes in estrogen from the active pills to the FE pills. Within hours of taking the first active pill_ I am myself again. Finally_ FOR 11 YEARS_ I NEVER HAD PMS WITH LOESTRIN!- BUT I DID HAVE PMS_ BLOATING_ CRAMPS_ BREAKOUTS AND HEADACHES AND WEIGHT GAIN WITH EVERY OTHER BC PILL I TRIED! I always went back to Loestrin and the problems were gone within a week or so),F,32,12  years,9/23/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

Then I checked on the side-effects and this drug seems to cause light or no periods in a lot of women. I took a test just to be sure-negative. I love this birth control because I think that the last type that I was on (kariva) caused me to have panic attacks! I also tried the orthro-evra patch before that_ but I constantly worried about it becoming unstuck (it had a hard time sticking to my skin because I have eczema-it also caused horrible rashes). Just goes to show that birth control effects everyone differently. A word of warning: Because this is a low-hormone pill_ you have a greater chance of becoming pregnant if you don't adhere to the ""same time everyday"" rule.",F,21,2  months,9/12/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I've been very tired ever since I started them as well. Even if I sleep in until noon I'm tired at 8:00 that night while at work.

Thought I'd do some research about Junel and didn't find much until I typed in Loestrin.  Suprised to see all of the info about depression_ weight gain_ and moodiness.  I definitely agree with the ups and downs with this drug but it has also been a crazy summer.  As far as weight gain goes_ I have been holding my own.  (Gained 40 pounds with last child_ child is now 1 year and I have lost all while on the pill.)  Did break out in a rash at the beach; not sure if any relation to taking birth control or not.  Rash went away within 2 weeks.

I know it takes a while to get your body used to taking something new. I started on ortho tri cyclen lo. That did not help with acne_ cramps_ or menstral periods. My Dr. perscribed Loestrin. I take the generic Microgestin. I do not have any side effects now except for the no period right now. I have noticed I have been somewhat moody_ but I am not sure if it is from taking this pill. I might try something else though after reading some others comments on here. It's freaking me out (hair loss_ depression_ getting pregnant while on it_ etc..)!

In less than 2 months_ I gained 12 pounds while actively trying to lose weight. I have now stopped all oral contraceptives. In just 11 days_ I have lost 8 pounds (without actively trying) and my sex drive has returned much to my husband's delight. My overall mood is much better. I have yet to see any signs of my period but will gladly live through the long periods that usually come every 19 days and last for 8 when I have been off the pill before.,F,40,2  months,7/13/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
650, 2, Birth Control,Mood swings_ depression_ anxiety_ spotting_ irregular periods.,I was on microgestin_ the generic form of this drug and it made me miserable.  My mood swings were so bad I had to see a therapist because I thought I was either severly depressed or had bipolar disorder.  No underlying psychosis - it was all the pill! My periods became increasingly irregular_ with spotting over the week before my period.  Usually they'd start anywhere from a few days early to a few days late_ with light-moderate bleeding for 2-3 days_ nothing for 2-3 days then start bleeding again for another 2-3 days.  In total I'd have spotting/bleeding for 2 weeks out of 4.  Switched from Ortho Tri-Cyclen because of the weight gain_ this pill made me gain only 5lbs as opposed to 15 gained on Ortho.  But I'd take getting fat over going crazy any day!  Switched to another pill (seasonale)and after only a month all of my mood symptoms have cleared up and I've lost the 5lbs I put on w/Loestrin.,F,25,11  months,7/8/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30

I experienced a complete loss of libido (combined with vaginal dryness) mood swings_ acne all over my chin & also on my back.

I have none of those problems with this pill_ I feel like I haven't felt in years_ and my period is on-time now. I highly recommend this pill if you have had problems with contraceptive pills in the past. I had pretty much given up before I found this one. Oh_ and I use the generic version_ called ""Microgestin"". You don't have to have the ""FE"" either_ that's just an iron supplement during the placebo week_ which you can do yourself. I'm generally sensitive to any medication and of course_ hormones_ and I have had no problems using the generic version of Loestrin 1.5/30_ so I'd also recommend that if you can't afford the brand name.",F,24,44  days,3/6/2006,Loestrin fe 1.5/30
