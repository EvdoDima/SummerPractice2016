5, 5, for severe migraines,I do not recall any side effects other than almost always being hungry after about 1 hour after taking. That to me is a positive side effect.,My headaches started 10 days after I was rear ended in a bad car accident. never had notable head aches before that. But I   was familiar with hang overs. over the years when asked how bad my migraines were my response was times your worst hang over by 6 that's what its like. after several different prescriptions_ doctor visits (2)MRIs_3Xrays_and a cat scan. Fiorinal #3 was prescribed. IT WORKS.

13, 5, Severe migraines,Constipation and rebound headaches.  Your tolerance goes up the longer you take it_ but if you really monitor the usage it is a God send!.  I have taken this medication for the past 12 years and it is the only thing that works for the severe pain.  Without this medication I can barely get up to take care of my children.  Worry over the addictive qualities!  A life of severe pain in not a good life so I am willing to risk it.

15, 5, Sporadically over past 5 years,Slight drowsiness_ not a huge appetite_ other than that really nothing unpleasent_ bothersome_ or even worth mentioning.,"This medication is a Godsend for my sporadic tension headaches.  I've tried numerous things: Fioricet_ regular Fiorinal_ Ultram_ Vicodin Voltaren_ Imitrex_ Treximet_ Zanaflex_ Relpax_ Keppra_ and Bystolic_ and the only 2 that really seemed to help to a worthy degree were Fiorinal/Fioricet (which are basically the same drug_ except Fiorinal has aspirin where Fioricet has Tylenol instead)_ however these drugs lasted barely 4 hours and the comedown/crash was HORRIBLE.  F.w/codeine seems to last much longer_ almost 8 hours_ helps take away the pain and tension much better_ and oddly enough doesn't make me near as loopy/drowsy as Fioricet/Fiorinal...actually it kinda jolted me up.  I can function at work when I take this med_ unlike the previous two when I'd get loopy_ start slurring my speech_ and was quite dizzy and appeared buzzed to my coworkers.  Plus_ when I took Fioricet/Fiorinal at night and then fell asleep_ I'd wake up the next morning usually earlier than normal_ my heart pounding and on the very of feeling like I was gonna have a panic attack.  When I take F.w/codeine at night then goto bed_ I wake up the next morning completely fine_ granted a tad groggy_ but that passes.  I recently started taking it again_ after about 5 years of not_ and I'm working on getting the medical records from the previous doctor who oversaw me on this med.  I've just noticed it's difficult to talk to any doctor about it_ because when they hear the word ""Codeine"" it's like you can",M,29,3  weeksusual 1X D,7/16/2012,Fiorinal w/codeine no 3
16, 4, severe migraines,I never got drowsy when I took it_ I felt really hyper_ and had alot of energy. This drug helped me so much with my migraines_ I have had migraines for 30 yrs. When I was a kid I would get frequent headaches_ as I got older severe migraines_ I always end up  vomiting_ sometimes I cannot stop. I would get heartburn once in a while from the aspirin_ I couldn't sleep when I took it usually but it really did stop the migraine pain.,I do not take this medication anymore. I started abusing it_ and Ativan 2mg. I was taking up to 10 or 12 Fiorinal a day and about 20mg or more of ativan. I would go through the script so quickly_ and then the severe withdrawal would start. I started having seizures after abusing benzodiazepines for a lot of years_ and then running out. I do not blame the drug(s) I blame me_ because otherwise these drugs are generally safe and very effective. If you have any addiction issues_ or you think you could start abusing the Fiorinal_ please do not take it. I haven't had a seizure since 2007_ but I lost my drivers license (of course)_ and I scared so many people who witnessed the seizures.,F,42,12  years 10X D,4/28/2012Email,Fiorinal w/codeine no 3

19, 1, Migraine,Fatigue_ rebound headahe,I have suffered from Migraines for 20 years. I have been prescribed everything...Imitrex_ Topomax_ Fiornal_ Axert_ Relpax_ Zomig) & used to go to the emergency room 1x week to get demerol shots! 10 years ago I found my miracle drug: Maxalt. As the years have gone by my body has built up a tolerance to it and it stopped working so for the past 2 years I've been combining Maxalt w/Excedrin Migraine which has been a great cocktail. Until recently_ again I've built up a tolerance and it no longer works unless I take several Maxalt/Excedrine over a period of days and since my insurance only allows 9 Maxalt pills a month_ so I need something new. I was searching the internet and came across this blog and I thought I'd found the Holy Grail! Fiornal w/Codeine #3 made total sense as it has the aspirin/caffeine combo that I had created myself with Maxalt/Excedrin! I got a prescription_ but alas...it isn't working. My very first onset of a headache 2 days ago I took one: nothing. I took another one & it made tired so I slept & woke up feeling good. Then boom_ another one started coming on...same thing: 1 didnt work_ so I took 2 and now 2 didn't work so I made it through the day/night_ went home/put an icepack on my head fell asleep and didn't wake up until 2:00 today...I slept for 15 hours!

I do not understand why it is becoming difficult to find a prescription insurance program that covers this drug.  If anyone knows which company covers this drug I would appreciate hearing from you.

One word of caution...This drug is or can easily become very addictive. Proceed with caution especially if you have an addictive personality. In my opinion_it is much stronger than hydrocodone. Unfortunately for me_after years of taking it_I became very dependent and at times would either take more than was prescribed or take it to ""relax"" or soften the blow of a stressful situation. (It had that affect on me). Before long...You get the story. That being said_if you need serious pain relief_this medication most likely will do the trick...Just proceed with caution as I mentioned and take it only as needed.

25, 4, Tension headaches,Drowsiness_ reduction in mental alertness.,This drug is quite helpful for treating tension headaches_ but not extremely effective for treating migraine headaches.  Often_ a combination tension/ sinus headache will mimic the symptoms of a migraine. I have found that combining Fiorinal along with 60 mg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (pseudophed)_ almost always eliminates a bad sinus headache_ and usually eliminates a tension headache. The only medication which works for my migraines is a migraine specific medication called Maxalt. I take the Maxalt first_ wait 20 minutes_ then take the Fiorinal.

My use has been almost nonstop since age 25_ yet I am not bothered with any withdrawal symptoms or nervousnous when I am able to go without them. Which I do_ at least 3 days a month. My Pain Control specialist has no problem prescribing these_ I just have to be seen every 6 months before he will renew them.

28, 5, Hurt fingers using a maddock,This medicine really helped reduce the throbbing and the pain experienced when I accidently had the steel end of a maddock (pick axe_ flathead)ricochet back onto me . . . but_ as a side effect_ gave me the sleep I needed as well. Some lethargy was experienced the next morning after a really excellent sleep_ but that only lasted until about lunchtime(about 5 hours).,"Fiorinal also assisted my wife with periodic migraines_ it's effects really giving relief to her !

32, 5, Migraines_ tension headaches,Constipation,I have used this for years for migraines about 2-3X a month.  Lately I have needed to take more (2-4x week) mostly for tension headaches.  I think this is because of a job change in which I am in front of a computer 10-12 hours per day/6 days per week.  I've found that if I don't take it for the tension headaches and try to push through the pain they get worse and feel like a migraine (vomiting_ severe pain).  My fear is that I will develop a dependency but like others have tried many types of pain management and this is the only one that works.  Is there anyone out there taking as much as I am--about 10-14 per week?  Not everyday but often have to take 2_ twice a day to get complete relief and up to 6 per day for severe migraine episodes that usually last 1 day.

51, 5, Migraine headaches,Dry mouth (only after menopause); occasional constipation; some drowsiness,Have taken this drug on and off for 33 years (since age 19) for migraines. Although I use Imitrex for severe migraines_ I still take Fiorinal as a backup for less severe headaches. I have a low tolerance for pain and a very high tolerance for drugs. My doc lets me have 2 capsules every 4 hrs._ max. 4 capsules per day for 3 days in a row_ then says I should stop for at least 3 days before taking it again. But I've taken as much as 6 capsules per day for 4 days without any side effect more severe than drowsiness (which is better than pain). My mother also took this drug in the 1960s and '70s for migraines_ but she could tolerate only one capsule every 4 hrs. It got rid of her pain but made her very nauseous. My idiot sister took it once and claimed it gave her hallucinations -- go figure!,F,52,33  years,12/4/2006,Fiorinal w/codeine no 3

I've been extremely careful not to over-use it and not to drive while taking it_ just in case. I take one pill every four hours and seldom have to take a third one. If I do_ I then feel a bit woozy. I always feel I have to reassure the doctor that I will use the drug with moderation. In Canada the fiorinal required a triplicate prescription while I had thought the codeine was the part to watch out for! Excellent medication for me.

53, 5, dibilitating migraines,dry mouth,I would recommend this medicine to anyone who experiences migraines.  It keeps me functioning most days.  I have tried all there is to try_ and nothing else works_ (including fioricet with codeine for some reason).  It is frustrating that doctors and pharmacists have such a hard time prescribing this. I have been taking it off and on_ mostly on now_ for over 20 years.,F,48, ,9/12/2006,Fiorinal w/codeine no 3
54, 5, Migraine headache,Constipation_ tiredness as effects wear off_ stomach upset,This drug has kept me on my feet_ having a life for 20 some years. It is the only thing that I found that took away the pain but did not incapacitate me with side effects. I have only recently increased the dosage from 1 to 2. Problem is that pharmacists seem determined to roadblock refills even though it is clear to my doctor that it helps and I am not selling or abusing. Anyone else getting resistance from pharmacies?,F,57,22  years,6/30/2006,Fiorinal w/codeine no 3
55, 5, Severe daily pain due to accident,I do not have any side effects if I take Ranidine (excuse sp) with Fioninel-3.,It is the only medication that allows me to continue working.

I have restricted movement in my right arm and shoulder due to a fall and have been injured in a car accident as well as a fall down a flight of stairs.  However_ with the relief I get from this medication_ I can continue with my life in a normal fashion_ with limited right arm/shoulder range of motion.,F,62,4  years,6/14/2006Email,Fiorinal w/codeine no 3

But in all the years I have been on it_ my dosage has stayed the same once the proper configurations for me finally got figured out.

Also_ occasional stomach upset.,Fiorinal #3 is_ in my opinion_ the best drug on the market for people who suffer from true migraines or tension headaches_ and the ONLY drug that effectively and reliably relieves my migraines.
