0, 3, hypertension,Psudo-gout after about 6 months (Very painful!) Arms feel full and heavy_ dizzy if standing up too fast. Urinating frequently. Hair loss is probably the worst side effect.,Although this drug along with norvasc lowered my bp_ I feel like a zombie. I used to have a nice thick head of hair_ until I was put on bp meds.  The psudo-gout pops up randomly_ it's soo painful!  Dr. says it's from the hydrochlorothiazide but won't take me off because bp is down.,M,40,1  years25/10MG,7/1/2016,Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide

3, 3, Blood Pressure,Some unexplained welts_ buzzing in ears_ insomnia_ energy loss,I found this web site by trying to explain a health problem that seem to have no explanation.  Specifically_ I was diagnosed about a year ago with Raynaud's - which is a lack of tolerance to cold.  My hands and feet are always red and splotchy looking_ and I can't bundle up enough to keep warm anytime it gets colder than 70 degrees. I'm 61 years old and this 'problem' only surfaced in the last 2-3 years. I can't be sure if it's related to the Losartan. I've tried staying off the medicine for about a week before resuming it.  Nothing changed. Still_ if it is related_ then it may take longer than a week to resolve itself. The doctor is reluctant to change my medicine since 1) Losartan isn't known to have a Raynaud relationship and 2) Losartan is one of the only B.P medicines to work for me.,,61,3  years50mg 1X D,2/6/2015Email,Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide
