Twenty minutes in I experienced the usual side effects with some chest sensations I hadn't felt before.  Got a rock hardon that satiified both the wife and I for about 40 minutes_ then climaxed after she did.  I was so tired out I couldn't ride her anymore that morning and later in the day jerked off while she was shopping.  Compared to Stendra which is almost as expensive_ Viagra gave me the stiffness and most satisfying hardon.,,,1  months25 1X AN,3/22/2016,Viagra
5, 4, For Erectile Dysfunction,This drug really works_ and works fast. However_ a mild headache is pretty much standard and it can last well into the next day. Make sure you have paracetamol and iboprofen on hand.,"Some people_ myself included are extremely sensitive to this drug. My first attempt_ at 25mg_ was an overdose bringing 2-day-long migraine_ searing eye pain_ uncontrolled sweating_ and rampant tachycardia in addition to a painful_ unending  erection. I spent hours with the phone in my hand wondering whether to call 911. I absolutely believe a full 100mg dose would kill me. I've since learned to use the drug in 5mg doses (maximum 2 x 5mg spread over half a day). Do NOT take a full dose until you know how this drug affects you. Be very conservative in dosing if you have any kind of heart rhythm problem. I would advise spending one quiet day with the drug learning how it affects your body before the ""big day"" of trying it with a sex partner for real.",M,,3  years10mg 1X D,3/15/2016,Viagra

For the last few months_ I was unable to maintain erection and truly concerned.  I was prescribed Cialis and Viagra.  I will comment on Cialis in that forum.  That said_ Viagra worked incredibly well.  In fact_ I was able to have another wonderful session with my wife 2x same night - So glad the blue pill is here!

However_ side effects include feeling flushed_ some palpitations_ waking up in he middle of the night feeling a bit nuts in the head_ and woke up with a funky feeling in my head. I am sensitive to meds as can be seen on how tiny of a dose i took. Happened enough times where i can positively attribute those negative effects to viagra (sildefinel).,,,38,8  days12.5 mg,10/3/2014,Viagra
28, 4, ED,Red face (flushing)_ Red eyes_ muscle ache -------I live in the Philippines and get generic Viagra.  It's called Sildenafil and made here by Amherst Laboratories_ distributed by United Laboratories and available in almost all Pharmacies. Six months ago I started with three name brand Viagra pills.  I was afraid to use it because I'd heard of so many dangerous side effects.  But my sex life had gotten to the place where I could no longer perform in bed.  So I finally talked to my Doc.  He saw no red flags in my medical history_ so recommended Viagra.  I was on my way from the USA to visit a young lady I'd been chatting with in the Philippines.  She made it clear sex was an important part of any relationship_ so I was very uptight wondering if Viagra would do the trick. WOW!!!  It was a miracle drug!!,"We spent 2 weeks of bliss. It had none of the side effects I'd feared. I did notice red eyes after sex but I figured that's cuz my eyes were tired.  I was using 1/4 pill (25mg) with great results.  . Obviously 3 pills didn't last long. We were in Thailand at the time and I found a generic from India called Komagra.  It was cheap but I was scared to try it cuz I'd heard so many stories about people dying from contaminated drugs.  But they were great!  No problems.  Still got some facial flushing and eye redness.  Back in the Philippines I found the Sildenafil.  Cost about $3.30 per pill (less than $1.00 per use)  Worked GREAT!! But over the last couple months my girl friend (who is now my wife) says my eyes are starting to look like a weir wolf after sex cuz they are so red.  Also I am noticing a dull aching in my back and shoulder muscles.  I'd increased to 50 mg (half a tablet) so I am thinking about cutting back to 25mg to see if that helps  ----To summarize_ these pills have been a miracle drug for me. My wife loves how long I can last and how large I get.   She especially loves the size and so do I.  She is very small and I am 6 ft.  What a GREAT combination for both of us!  SIZE DOES MATTER!!  Every time we make love she exclaims ""Wow_ you are SO BIG!!""  That really turns me on!! At first_ it hurts her a little bit.  But after a couple thrusts the pain is gone and the delicious fun begins.  So I am loving the pills but still concerned about the side effects.",M,69,6  months50mg 1X D,7/6/2014Email,Viagra
29, 5, ED,Very mild flush_ a bit of congestion_ and mild reaction in stomach.,This is a drug to use only if you need it_ so if you are getting erections on your own_ enjoy nature's gift while you can.  But if you need it don't be hesitant to talk to your doctor like I was.  I've learned to enjoy the mild side effects as I'm anticipating getting the best erections I've had since I was 20. I take it without food and lots of water.  After some experimentation the 25mg seems to give me a more satisfactory stiffy - the 50 feels less natural - more swollen than hard.  One issue - I don't get much precum.  Talk to your doctor guys.,M,57,5  months25-50mg 5X W,5/15/2014Email,Viagra

31, 4, Sustain erection.,Slight stuffy nose if dosage too high.  I take a portion of 100mg pill (about a quarter) at a time.  Also get flushed and puffy face and red lips.  Again if I take more than 50 mg in 24 hours.  No problem with vision or hearing.  Overall it works very well for me.  I use it to keep going after first orgasm - I have always had a quick trigger- never a problem when younger because I was good for 3-6 in an hour if I wanted.  Now not so much.  It help keep going and also seems to desensitize so I last longer before the first one.  Keep the dosage low to minimize side effects.,,M,48,1  years25mg,5/4/2014,Viagra

33, 3, To achieve harder erection,I took 2 x 100mg by mistake thinking they were 50mgs. Yes my erection was harder for longer but about 1 hour after taking my head looked and felt like it was going to explode. All my vision was with a blue hue and flashes_ after 3 hours the migraine style headache started _ I took ibuprofen and tried to sleep it off. In the morning my headache was so bad I hardly dare move. When I did move and looked in the mirror I looked awful_ swollen eyes_ dark rings_ puffed up face and the head ache from hell. It's made me realise this is certainly no drug to be taken light hearted. I feel really lousy_ like I've drunk a whole bottle of whiskey and then half a bottle of wine_ or something like that.  I say use it if you must but only take 50 mg and remember you need to be stimulated for it to work. You don't just get hard. Good luck guys.,,M,52,1  days200mg 1X D,3/17/2014Email,Viagra
34, 5, Minimal Difficulty Achieving Stiffy,none,I broke a 50 mg tab in half_ put half of the pill in an 8 ounce water bottle_ let it dissolve_ then I took just two swigs of the water; which amounted to about 25% of the total volume.  I did this on an empty stomach and within 20 minutes_ Mr. Happy was thicker and harder than I've seen him in 25 years; standing at full attention_ like a freaking flag pole.  Then my friends_ it was off to the races.  Wow_ this stuff is like gold.  WOW.  I've always been very leary of drugs_ so I wanted to start off really slow and I'm glad I did.

Jumped up to 124_ and slowly came down a little but was still rapid after 3 hours.,Tried this due to personal issues_ but will not be taking it again. Although it seems the rapid heartbeat is common and can be quite scary - I really don't like the feeling. And the results from what I took were nothing special to be honest. Won't be taking again - isn't worth the risk.,M,39,1  days25 1X D,7/27/2013,Viagra

As you may know the FDA cracked down on some of the more popular sites selling generic drugs on the net - generic4all was one of them..I can now recommend with confidence another excellent site - mynetpharma.comYou have to use your checking account - fill in routing number and account number. That's how they get around the problem the FDA caused when it persuaded Visa not to accept transactions with the internet generic drug companies.,M,62,10  years100 mg 1X D,6/2/2013Email,Viagra

41, 2, Problems due to diabetes,I had congestion within a few minutes of taking the medication. This was easily handled with saline nasal spray.,I got no benefit from viagra at all. I began to feel warm and that's about it. Manual stimulation didn't work_ oral stimulation didn't work. I switched to cialis and had much better results. I would like to caution guys about taking this just for fun. This is a drug that is meant for people that need it - not as a recreational drug. Are you really willing to risk the side effects when you can get an erection naturally? It's just not worth it. Also - watch your alcohol intake!,M,58,4  weeks100 1X AN,5/3/2013,Viagra

I continuously jerked for an hour. it was erect. I loss my stamina wore up my pants and sat down in my room. tried again after 5 hours. it got erect and remained erect after ejaculating as well.

I was worried. it was 18 hours of consumption. i went on to do my daily work. and tried twice at night_ and experiecned same condition. next day i visited a urologist and showed him my dick_ while standing. he pressed it and it got erect he tried scaring me by telling you need a surgery in which i will insert a needle and pull off the unrequired blood. i got scared.

43, 2, Erectile Disfunction,My husband took one last night.  He had been just taking half doses.  Tonight after he had a glass of wine he started acting really strange.  He started slurring his words and he said that his fingers and toes felt numb.  He had the problem with slurred words for several days after he took one for the first time.  That is why he had been taking a smaller dose.  Just like someone else said_ he felt like his brain and mouth are out of sync when he is talking.  I think that the alcohol made the side effects worse.  He was fine before he had the glass of wine.  I really don't want him to take this any more.  He was acting like he was really out of it and I was scared that he might be having  a stroke.  He went to bed early and is hoping to sleep it off.,If you have to have something_ take a smaller dose.

I sometimes take a small bite (1/5 of a 100 mg tablet)and chew it up and absorb it through the lining of my lip.  Taking it this way_ it takes affect in minutes_ and even when nervous about intimacy with someone for the first time_ no problems.  But I am thinking that it is not worth it.  Today I have the worst hangover and at other times I felt like it was saping my energy days later.

60, 1, Bladder Neck Inflammation and Pain,Dull heachache_ red fully eyes_ facial flushing_ eye pressure and pain,I took this drug after my urologist suggested it because of pain in my uretha from a bladder neck inflammation. This drug works great for ED or any erectile failure. HOWEVER_ I get yearly glaucoma exams because my mother had it in her 60s_ and my optic nerve is irregular showing a predisposition for the disease. My checkups had been fine until my last one when they told me I have A LOSS OF VISION IN MY LEFT EYE showing that I am now fully glaucomic. The Doctors do not attribute this to the use of Viagara but I can tell that I am almost positive that the use of this drug caused damage to my optic nerve which precipitated an early onset of glaucoma_ which I may have had to contend with in my 50's or 60's. The drug is a a known vasodilator which will suddenly increase the pressure in your eye. Not enough to cause a NAION (stroke)_ but after continued use over years_ I DO BELIEVE that IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR OPTICE NERVE as I belileve it did mine. You will not even notice it is happening until you get a visual field exam which I encourage anyone taking this drug over the long term to do. WHAT DO YOU THINK is happening to your eyes_ after you take this drug and you notice eye pressure_ redness_ pain and swelling which lasts for the duration of the drug life in your body. This drugs is causing you the slightest damage with every use that will only come to light after many years of using it. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IF YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO!!! IF YOU DO_ PLEASE GET A FULL EYE EXA,M,40,6  months50 1X AN,8/17/2011Email,Viagra

I was with my girlfriend at a bar and when we were leaving I noticed that it was hitting even a very low doseage I got the full desired effects_ my erection was 100% I haven't had an erection like that one in years.. I guess that long time masturbating and getting used to a quick and easy orgasm somehow damaged my arousal system. I was able to last for 3 rounds and I had a lot more control of my orgasm _ I knew when i was close to it so I could easyly stop and satisfy better my girl.

76, 1, Erectile Dysfunction,"VIAGRA WORKED BUT WITH HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS! I only took it once. Around 1040PM_ I took a VERY small minute amount of a 100 mg dose. Seven minutes later_ the side effects kicked in. I had VERY FAST RAPID HEARTBEAT FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF!I'm 29_ with ""slightly"" high blood pressure (140/90)_ and I had to call 911 (around 12:00AM) because I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK! Around 1215AM_ the EMS checked my blood pressure and it was at 188 (systolic). I also had facial flushing where my face seemed warmer/hotter than usual. Also_ it was so uncomfortable that I had to ""walk slower"" around my apt and I could barely talk as I had to breathe in more carefully so that I could calm my heart down as much as I could. I didn't go to bed until 4/5am because I was so worried that I might have a heart attack!VIAGRA IS REALLY STRONG AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO TAKE LIGHTLY! TAKE A VERY VERY SMALL DOSE IF IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME TAKING IT! I'LL NE",I won't ever take it again. It gave me a nice erection but is it worth it to have a rapid heartbeat for an hour????? No way!

77, 2, Harder erection,"I found that within 30-45 minutes my face starting flushing_ so I was cognizant the drug was taking affect. No erection was achieved without my wife helping out. And yes_ my erection was harder_ which most likely_ was more pleasing for my wife...I trust! However_ having longer sex did not happen. I would ejaculate in the normal time (for moi)_however_ the erection would not immediately subside_ as was normally the case. The downside for me is that I have a headache for the next day_ with small amounts of flushing. IMHO_ the consequences aren't worth it. Good sex_ then pay for it for a day. After my supply disappears_ I won't be using it again. (I have tried different strengths of Viagra_ with similar results). Again_ IMHO_ this drug is overrated_ and if it wasn't for the hundreds of millions of $$ being spent on advertising_ and all the hype that goes with it_ this ""sex pill"" would not be making zillions for Pfizer.",Very expensive_ lousy side effects_ too hyped up and over sold.,M,61,1  years50 mg 1X W,11/14/2010,Viagra

Your e-mails with questions/comments are welcome.,Began sometimes losing erections during sex (foreplay and intercourse) at around age 48. Only increased stimulation (going faster to regain feeling)maintained or restored full erection. This could cause orgasm and ejaculation too soon_ ending the experience. 1st tried 50mg sample of Viagra.Strong results_ including spontaneous erection (no stimulation needed).Began cutting pills into 25mg portions. This is sufficient for me_ with more need for proper sexual stimulation to get an erection. If taken with proper rest_ minimal or no alcohol_ AND empty stomach_ very stiff erections can be attained within 30-60 minutes of taking Viagra.Also penis size becomes and tends to stay at maximum fullness and length_which gives good sensation for both me and my wife.Now I can go more slowly_ allowing our pleasure to build and better allow simultaneous orgasm/and multiple orgasms (usually for her_ but sometimes for me too). Note: Viagra benefits me for about 12-24 hours.Don't use it in family nudist environments at private times without expecting it to possibly cause unwanted erections (or at least partial ones) later or the next day_ based upon my experience.E-mails with questions/comments welcome.,M,58,5  years25 1X AN,10/25/2010Email,Viagra
79, 4, For a good boner_ what else,Well the list grew as time went by. At first it was a mild headache and a stuffy nose. Then it messed with my stomach and it almost was like a laxative after about an hour of taking it. Then the chest fullness or heart flutter started. Then my eyes seemed real tired. I quit this stuff since I didn't know what else it was doing to me.,"It worked great. Boners were like when I was 18 years old. I wouldn't get hard until the situation arose. Then the thought of sex gave me an instant boner and it would not go away - which was great. Lots of foreplay and still rock hard. The first time I used it my date told me that I looked ""hungry"" as you looked at my erection. It was fun but too many side effects for me to continue. Use it once a month or less now.

In my case I began using Viagra (100 mg) 10 years ago in my late fifties. Now_ after 10 years I only get a full_ firm erection about once a month. But because my needs and desires are strong as ever I try to have sex once or twice a week and those times I have to settle for an erection that's only about 60 - 70% full - not always firm enough for penetration.

84, 4, Performance Anxiety & Recreational,Nasal congestion.,As a swinger I've used Viagra both recreationally and for performance anxiety. I have no problems when with my wife alone_ so I use 25mg every few weeks or so just for fun. It creates firmer erections_ but also de-sensitizes the sex ever-so-slightly so I last longer. Plus_ I'm hard again moments after climax. As for swinging with other partners_ I definitely have performance anxiety_ and it has worked - but only about half the time. The dosage doesn't seem to matter. I will admit that on those occasions where it didn't seem to work_ I was either drinking_ or had just eaten_ or had no interest in the lady in question. When none of those were the case_ it worked wonders_ though. Nice_ firm erections_ with a slight desensitization_ and very little down-time.,M,30,2  months25-100mg 1X AN,7/20/2010,Viagra

I was having premature ejaculation before and with viagra I was able to stay much longer than usual.,M,49,1  days,9/16/2009,Viagra
105, 2, Performance anxiety big time.,I'm 39 years old_ gym-fit_ without any pre-existing medical problems. Within 1 hour of taking a 50mg pill_ I had a splitting headache that lasted all night.  No amount of excedrin could get rid of it.  My heart was racing_ my breathing so heavy_ and my head so hot I thought I was going to have a heart attach or a stroke.  I felt like I had a highly-pressurized gas bubble at my center of my upper chest. On top of all this_ I was nauseous.  Not knowing the side effects of Viagra_ I thought it was food poisoning and tried to induce some vomiting hoping that these symptoms would go away but they did not.  I went home and rode out the nightmare.  Some symptoms did linger mildly through the next day and felt like a bad hangover.,"But Viagra did work. It worked very very well.  Just thinking about the possibility of having sex with my date gave me the biggest_ hardest wood I've had in a long time.  But it happened in all the wrong places.  I had to actively think about horrible_ ugly things to distract myself but it was nearly impossible to lose the erection once the thought of sex had entered my mind.  I had a tent pole for most of the night. I felt like I was in highschool.  Even as the horrible side-effects began to completely take over the date_ the erection was still there because I still desperately wanted to ""get some.""  However_ all the painful side effects of Viagra became too overwhelming_ I had to end the date thinking I had food poisoning.  Everyone around me noticed something was wrong with me even though I tried my best to hide it.  It wasn't until I googled all my symptoms that ""Viagra"" popped out as the culprit.  I did not know about these symptoms or that you shouldn't take it with alcohol or food because that pill was given to me by a friend to ""try before you buy.""  (I know I know).I guess I'm that small group of men who can't take this miracle drug.  But it works dammit. And the erection does go away when you're no longer horny_ (as in when I thought I was going to die.) It really works.  Please just make all that other horrible stuff go away!!!!",M,39,1  days,8/25/2009,Viagra

107, 1, longer lasting erection,I experienced the full works. taken on an empty stomach/no alcohol. Slight headache and pulsating temples withing 15 minutes. Very brief erection with no feeling what so ever during intercourse. Felt fine for the next 4 hours_ after which I really started to feel the effect of the drug. facial flushing_ increased heartrate_ splitting headache along with severe teethache (top set of teeth) nasal congestion_ abnormal gagging when trying to be sick. went hot and cold like i had the flu_ shivering when hot_ abnormal sweating_ dizziness_ light headed - all lasting for approximately 3 hours until i fell asleep. next day_ sore throat_ slight headache_ still got the jitters.,Can honestly say that i will not be taking this form of medicine ever again and wouldnt recommend it to anyone.,M,22,1  days,8/13/2009,Viagra
108, 5, ED,Get slightly nauseated immediately after climax_ but is short lasting.  Still worth the effort.,I have used 50 mg capsules for many months and only take it when I know for sure we are going to have sex (63 y.o.)_ usually about 3 days a week.  Viagra cost too much to buy locally.  I tried Canada_ still too much.  I found Viagra Capsules in INDIA_ 96 - 50 mg capsules for $62.  Wow!  Yes_ I've used it for many months and ROCK HARD almost every time.It doesn't work well when you don't feel good.  Sexy foreplay is very important.,M,,6  months,8/12/2009,Viagra
109, 5, Performance anxiety,mild flushing and chubby in grocery store,I have performance anxiety and perhaps an arousal disorder but no problem with erections during masturbation or when I have to pee in the morning.  I take periodically to help with bouts of anxiety.  Don't need more than 25mg_ more than that gives me a steel rod that won't cum.

110, 3, ED due to blood pressure meds,Took 50mg on an empty stomach first thing in the morning and my face got so hot and red I thought it would catch fire.  Got a wicked headache after that that lasted the whole day (and maybe part of the next).  I've since figured out that taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen_ or  a combo drug like Excedrin (acetaminophen_ aspirin and caffeine) along with the Viagra helps.  Have switched to half of a 50mg pill and that seems to be fairly effective.,Definitely found (on my own) what others here have reported -- taking on anything other than an empty stomach_ 25mg doesn't do a lot.  Need to stick with taking 25mg on an empty stomach and see how that goes.,M,40,2  weeks,7/17/2009,Viagra
111, 4, recreational,minor headache the following day. Minor gastric distress (mild constipation),"""test drove"" Viagra and Cialis back to back for comparative purposes (allowed ample time to pass in between_ 3-4 days) and found that for me personally_ Viagra was much more effective_ it quickly produced a very strong_ powerful erection that lasted well over three hours and it had very minimal side effects compared to Cialis- I was very disappointed in Cialis because it did not produce an erection anywhere near as strong and powerful as the Viagra and the side effects of Cialis were almost dibilitating. Myonly complaint about Viagra is_ it takes too long too climax-over three hours in my case! Not a bad problem to have if you're a guy but you can definitely wear out your partner_ and yourself!",M,,1  days,7/7/2009,Viagra

113, 4, Ensure erection,Rapid heartbeat_ stuffy nose_ flush face.  Occasional ED due to performance anxiety.  No problem getting erection during masterbation.  Very rapid heart beat incidence of which seems to increase if I drink alcohol. Rapid heart beat lasts anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours.,To stop the rapid heat beat I use a deep breathing technique wherein I sit on the toilet (I use the bathroom because its a quiet calm place and creates a sitting position that seems to work best) lean my upper body slightly forward and take a deep (but not too deep) breath_ pause and slowly exhale.  The rapid heart beat stops just as I start to relase my breath.  This technique works EVERYTIME but will sometimes not work for several hours.,M,48,6  months,7/4/2009Email,Viagra

120, 5, ED,Face flushing during 1st hour; headache after 4 hours,I have been using Viagra for 2 years_ hitherto with mixed results. However_ it is only recently that I started using it correctly. Until about 2 months ago I was blissfully unaware that it should be taken on an empty stomach!! The reason for some uninspiring performances in the past can be directly traced back to having a full stomach. Am now getting incredible results with 1/2 50mg tablet taken 1 hour before sex. My erections are rock hard_ long-lasting_ and can be induced with very little hand or mouth stimulation. I have a young lover_ half my age_ and we regularly engage in 2 to 4 hours of absolutely non-stop sex. I can also have an orgasm and NOT lose the erection. Paradise! Multiple orgasms for men are NOT a myth_ and I now regularly have 2 or 3 per sex session. Great product. Just wish I'd read the instructions properly 2 years ago!!,M,62,2  years,4/14/2009,Viagra

It started working within 14mins at which time I was rushing all over my body and especially in my face and around the ears. I had a rapid heart beat too but that only lasted for about 5 mins once I started to relax. Managed multiple orgasms in a 3 hour session. I split a 50mg tablet into 2 and took 25mg. an hour later I took the other 25mg but I think I will stick to 25mg for now as it seemed better than when I took 50mg.,M,32,1  days,4/13/2009,Viagra
122, 4, difficulty maintaining erection,stuffy nose_ flushing_ for me the worst was fairly severe heartburn,good_ firm erection - took some of the anxiety away over losing some of the erection before penetration.

123, 4, ED,First ever trial of half 50mg tablet. Heart started pounding after 1hr_ 2hrs later got stuffy nose. No other obvious effects. Had good strong erection which softened after climax. See comments.,My problem may not be as severe as others. We like a lot of foreplay_ at least 1.5hr+ and especially oral_ and I usually have no problem getting an erection_ but lately this would soften as penetration was later attempted. Very frustrating for both. This was my first ever trial. I got my prescription from Lloyds on line...very very expensive but didn't want to risk some illegal copy drug.After reading here about previous reports and advice I cut my first 50mg tablet in half_ in case side effects were severe_ with the intention of taking the other half later if no effect.I ignored advice about taking on empty stomach_ because we usually have sex after an evening meal_ with some beer or wine.( I did however only have a small beer this time knowing it could nullify effect).Knowing our routine_ I took half a 50mg tablet 20 min after chinese meal_ which would hopefully kick in about 1.5hr later.

128, 2, problems maintaining an erection,Flushing around temples eyes and ears_ slight heart palpitation although that has improved_ a general uncomfortable feeling psychologically because you are so aware of these effects. The worst is the headache - comes about 4 hours after taking the pill (50g) - I took some paracetamol which helped for two hours but then was woken up by more head pain and couldnt get back to sleep - as if I had taken speed. Next morning head still a bit heavy although bearable. I felt a bit lethargic but once I got outside I was ok- couldnt drink coffee. Two days later the side effect of the headache is still continuing a bit although has waned.,It gives a great erection and that is so important - am a single gay man and if you cant get a hardon you might as well not bother. I have taken it probably 6 or 7 times now over a period of 2 years - would really like to find something I can take on a regular weekly basis that isnt going to destroy my eyes_ or give me this ghastly splitting headache.I'm very concerned about these side effects as I love what the drug does to me performance wise and want to continue but feel scared particularly reading these other reports that ring so true.,M,52,7  times,1/7/2009,Viagra

It gives me a bigger stiffy but doesn't prelong orgasm.I get harder_ quicker.Psychologicaly it makes me hornier because of the increased blood flow.

161, 5, I have multiple sclerosis,I always wake up with a headache after taking viagra at night. I have also been experiencing a severe ache of the bones/joints which may or may not be related.,In regards to helping with erections_ the product works like a charm. I get results in 20 minutes after taking the medication. My wife jokes about it_ but certainly enjoys the results.,M,44,6  months,8/25/2007Email,Viagra

163, 1, ED,Horrible heart palpitations started about 36 hours after taking and lasted about 36 more hours.  Heart felt like it was skipping a beat.  Felt nervous inside.,Great erection_ but not worth the side effect.  Levitra works just as well_ but no health problems after taking.,M,42,3  days,7/18/2007,Viagra
164, 5, Consistency of performance,Headaches at the beginning (not sharp pain_ but more like pressure in back of head)_ hot around the ears_ even sweating the first time... Symptoms subsided other times.,Before taking VG_ I had occasional loss of performance after prolonged and increased frequency of sex. I didn't realize I needed a performance booster until I met my new girl friend... I first tried a 100mg pill (on an empty stomach about two hours before activity) and I probably had the highest performing sex of my life (or equal to when I was in my twenties). The session lasted past an hour_ without any loss of hardness. It takes time for me to come_ and my girlfriend gets really wet_ so it doesn't help_ but I was able to stay hard and ejaculate after she had achieved orgasm a couple of times. Definitely worked for me!,M,52,2  weeks,7/3/2007,Viagra

166, 2, ED,Several hours after taking it I have a headache that takes me off my feet. I finally took my blood pressure and found a 145/95 reading. I take a low dose lisinopril for BP_ and it takes a double dose to get my BP back to a bearable level.,I'll bet the profits from this Rx that if those complaining of headaches as a side effect took their BP they would find the exact same results. A report of dangerous increases in BP would be more accurate and harder to blow off than simple reports of headaches.,M,53,7  days,6/28/2007,Viagra

169, 1, Mild ED,none,Tried Viagra about 10 or so times and almost never had a result. I think I vaguely remember once but obviously it wasn't enough to remember. Anyway_ what's the use in taking something if it loses it's effects while consuming alcohol? Let's face it_ theres nothing worse than getting a buzz and hooking up just to be disappointed. I have since quit using Viagra and switched to Cialis. It costs roughly 3x more but it performs about 1000% more. I have only needed it 3 times over a year period and it leaves me feeling 18 all over again for months.,M,35,1  years,5/29/2007,Viagra
170, 5, ED,Flushed & warm face,"For starters_ I'm a 2-pack/day smoker & drink about 5-6 beers a night. I started taking it ( 50mg.) about 5 years ago cause I was curious. Worked great. Was like being 13 years old again & having to hold my books in front of my crotch so nobody could see ""it"". Back then I required little or no stimulation_ now I require a little stimulation but not much. When I finally went on prescription I asked for 100mg tabs because my HMO only allowed 4 doses (any size) per month. I break/bite them into approximately 25mg doses which prove to be as effective as 50mg sample doses. I read about others having side effects like numbness & reduced feeling but I attribute that to the ""harder member = more vigious action"" effect.  One thing to keep in mind; this drug has the capability to turn you into a scumbag instantly. When you're on this stuff you're ""loaded for bear"" sort of speak so keep your ""moral compass"" turned on for lack of a better phrase.",M,45,5  years,5/21/2007,Viagra

V is a gift from God. I don't remember EVER getting that hard. 50mg about 30 minutes before sex totally works for me. The flushing and stuffy nose are NOTHING compared to the benifits. V doesn't claim to make you last longer_ but when I take it_ I can ALWAYS last as long as I want.

Makes a horny Stone Pony out of me!,Before_ if my wife had to change positions_ I lost it (bummer!).If only there was a similar pill for women!

176, 5, episodic ED,For the first few time I took it_ I had some flushing_ but minor_ like my ears felt warm.  For the past 2 months I've been taking 50mg every Fri or Sat and notice no adverse side effects.  My orgasms are not as deep_ but I'm not sure if this is the effect of the drug or just my age.  I think taking it every day would be overkill.,This wonder drug has consistently given me firm_ long lasting erections.  I never have to worry about losing it during sex and can last as long as I want.  I have a new girlfriend who loves sex and she looks at me like I am superman during lovemaking. I reap all the rewards of fully satifying a woman.  I wait a full hour before drinking a glass of wine or it cancels the effect.  I have to have stimulation for it to work_ but it doesn't take much.  The effect for me lasts at least 18 hours and often 24.  I see no need to ever stop taking it.,M,58,5  years,4/2/2007,Viagra

178, 5, ED,Flushing in the face_ headache_ feeling ill.,My wife tells me to warn her when I take V so she can get herself in the right state of mind.  100mg makes me sick so I cut the tablets in half.  Putting them under your tongue or chewing them up is very bitter but works in half the time.  I haven't tried snorting them yet.  If it didn't work I wouldn't pay $175 for (15) 100mg tablets.,M,41,3  years,3/16/2007,Viagra
179, 5, ED,Flushed Face. Headache.  Upset stomach.,As a Gay Man there is more pressure on me to perform sexually than a straight man.  Viagra helps me to maintain my erection while using a condomn.  Anal intercourse with a very fit man can put a tremendous amount of pressure on your penis and prevent penetration from occurring_ even with copious amounts of anal ease.  Viagra makes penetrating even the tightest manhole a wonderful experience.

184, 4, E D,Flush_ red face and ears_ stuffy nose that lasted on into the next week_ bloodshot eyes.  Also_ some pressure around the eyes.,Significant erection improvement.  My wife noticed a difference in my performance.  Even though they say you do not last longer before climax_ I could tell a difference.  I could have gone a lot longer_ but my wife was getting tired.

186, 2, to increase erectile stiffness,Took 100 mg. in evening_ wakened at 5 a.m. with slight headache_ worsening headache throughout the day_ with stiff neck_ upset stomach and annoying post-nasal drip.,50 mg. dose not effective.  100 mg. causes all-day headaches not cured by Tylenol_ plus an upset stomach definitely not worth the slight erectile assistance experienced.

Returned the pleasure of earlier years_ and this was also gratifying to my wife. The strong side effects makes taking Viagra marginal. I have gotten a new prescription for Cialis to see if it is any better.

I sometimes get migraines_ but for them to occur the day after taking this drug (twice) seems more than a coincidence.,Not particularly effective - I did attain an erection but it was brief and not hard. I tried half a 50mg tab which was nearly useless_ then a full tab the next day and the side effects were bad.

One squirt of a nasal decongestant spray works wonders.  I use 1/4 of a 100mg tablet and that seems plenty - I don't want to take more because of increased side effects.,Works wonders.

After several times taking the little blue pill and experienceing all the side effects I tried taking a smaller dose of the 50 mg little blue pill. I bit maybe a little less the a quarter of the pill off and it worked find_ did not experience any of the side effects. the erection did not last as long but did last long enough to get the pleasure out of the dose and then some_ even had several more sessions with the same dose. I've been doing this for a year now when I use the little blue pills and have had no ill effects and the pills last a lot longer. This may not work for every one but I would suggest trying it. It could save you a lot of money and make your pills last longer and still get the enjoyment out of the sex with your partner. Mike,,M,60,16  days,11/14/2006,Viagra
