5, 3, Mild hypertension,At first I was on 4mg and didn't experience anything and my blood pressure was getting lower. My doctor decided to increase dosage to 8mg. One day I experienced severe heart palpations after not eating for a while and having a big meal and developed constant vertigo and dizzyness/lightheadedness that still hasn't gone away. In March 2016 I started getting palpations after eating nearly every meal and it felt like my blood pressure was dropping after meals. I decided to quit cold turkey but experienced withdrawal symptoms so I decided to go down to 4mg for a while. I have now quit Atacand completely for a week though still experiencing withdrawal symptoms and heart palpations after meals. Hoping these symptoms will go away after a while... The side effects were absolutely ruining my every day life. Will have to look into another drug and I am changing my lifestyle.,,M,28,1  years 1X D,5/2/2016,Atacand

9, 2, Chronic Migraine Prevention,I started on a 2mg dose and worked up to 8mg. I have been determined to keep going as I am running out of other medications to try_ however the side effects have been awful.

10, 1, Migraine prevention,Worsening of migraines_ severe anxiety,I started at 4 mg and worked up to 16 mg over a period of 6 weeks.  Up to 12 mg there was no impact on my migraine frequency.  As soon as I started 16 mg_ however_ my migraines became daily_ which has never occurred before--I usually got about 6 per month.  It took me 4 days to realize the candesartan was triggering the migraines_ but even after I stopped (cold turkey)_ the migraines continued on a daily basis for 6 more days_ stopping only when I started Amitriptyline 10 mg.  As well_ when I went off the candesartan_ I experienced severe anxiety_ panic attacks_ depression_ and loss of appetite.  It took about a week to recover from these symptoms.  For me_ this drug was poison.  To make matters worse_ my neurologist completely dismissed that the candesartan could have been triggering the migraines.

Takes 48 hours for the drug to leave your body_ but the side effects a little longer. This stuff is poison. I can't take any bp meds.. so good thing bp is good from all the walking but my kidney is not protected. Rather have quality of life though.

34, 1, Kidney Protection,This stuff is not good for me. They had me on it back in 2006 and I had wicked panic attacks.. a sinus infection that lasted a year... I felt like I was going insane... I found this board in 06 and saw what someone had written about his panic attacks and realized it was the drug and I took myself off of it.. don't do that_ though.. my bp spiked but it normalized again. Anyway_ because my one and only kidney leaks protein and recently increased the dr convinced me to try atacand again at a much lower dose... same problems starting all over again... started in the sinus... now it feels like my throat and esophagus are on fire... lots of phlegm_ coughing... just feel crappy. So tomorrow back to my water pill. It keeps my bp steady but unfortunately does not have the kidney protection atacand does... not sure what to do about that...,I hate this crap. What really bugs me is you are given something to make something better but it creates a bunch of other problems.. not quality of life to me.,F,48,5  days4 mg 1X D,3/25/2012Email,Atacand

40, 5, High Blood Pressure,No side effects - a miracle!,I am super sensitive to all drugs_ so I can take almost nothing without bad side effects and allergies.  I had been on Tenormin (atenolol) for many years_ but it no longer was controlling my blood pressure_ it was only lowering my heart rate (something I needed in addition to BP reduction).  I (worriedly) added Atacand to my Tenormin regime in hopes of lowering my uncontrolled BP.  What I really liked was I had no side effects and also the fact that there was no cumulative effect on blood pressure or heart rate reduction between the two - the Atacand controlled only my high blood pressure and the Tenormin continued to control only my heart rate.  Another thing I like is that it is short-acting so I knew when I started it that if there was a problem_ I could stop it and it would be out of my system in a few hours.  I started small (1/4 of a 4mg tab) to test it out and found no side effects_ just a reduction in my blood pressure - a miracle for me!  Now I take an amount based on my current blood pressure - that way I don't overdo it if my BP happens to be low and I don't under-dose it if it's high - the smartest way to dose a short acting drug (take only what you need).  So for me personally_ I take (3x a day) 1/2 a 4mg tab if my BP is in the 130's_ 3/4 of a 4mg tab if it's in the 140's and a whole 4 mg tab if it's 150 or above.  I take 50mg Tenormin 3x a day along with it to keep my heart rate below 80.  No sleepiness_ dizziness or cough! GREAT DRUG!!,F,51,1  years2-4mg 3X D,11/13/2011Email,Atacand

However_ I fought with Medco and told them the horrible side effects that I was experiencing when prescribed Diovan and Hyzaar and it was overturned and I now am back on Atacand_ 32 mg.  Yes; it is very expensive compared to the other BPH meds but my life is worth it to take a medication that helps lower my BPH for quality of life.,Atacand is an excellent BPH medicine.

After a week_ I noticed some fatigue but it was mild and I couldn't realistically attribute it to Adacand.  The increase in fatigue and depression was so slow and subtle over a years time that it was like the proverbial ""frog in a pot"" that was cooked to death by slowly increasing the temperature.  After a year the depression was so bad that I almost forgot I was taking Adacand; so_ I decided to stop.  The depression immediately left and I felt normal again.

137, 2, High blood pressure,A week after I started taking 32 mg per day of atacand_ I started experiencing panic attacks and anxiety. I have a happy family life_ good wife and kids and no financial problems. There should be no reason for panic attacks. Panic attack usually wakes me up at 3 in the morning. It can also happen any time of the day. Felt like drowning. Hard to breath. The problem with this is that I knew that there is no reason for feeling like this. I suspected Atacand was causing this because the panic attacks started a few days after taking atacand. I take 32 mg atacand with 10 mg. norvasc. Perhaps this combination is bad for me. I told my blood press. MD about my condiion but he said that atacand will not do that. I belived him and kept on taking atacand for 1 year and 3 months while suffering the panic attacks. I asked my family MD (blood press MD a different doctor) to give me 0.5 mg ativan to combat the panic attacks (more drugs on drugs) and it did help but only when I take it. Finally (1 year,I have high blood pressure_ diabetes and cholesterol problem. I take 45 mg actos_ and 16 mg gluconorm and 500 mg metformin (3x daily). I also take 81 mg aspirin_ 10 mg eztrol and 40 mg lipitor. Also of course with the 10 mg norvasc and 300 mg avapro. My BP is 130/85 average.,M,55,15  months,5/18/2006Email,Atacand
138, 2, High blood pressure,Continuation... previous description got cut (too long?) I said after taking atacand for 1 year and 3 months_ I had enough panic attacks (don't wanna kill myself over it) I told my BP MD to take me off atacand or I will do it myself. He then reluctantly switched me to 300 mg. avapro. VOILA! LIKE MAGIC MY PANIC ATTACKS DISAPPEARED LIKE MAGIC IMMEDIATELY! Doctors_ please listen to your patients (even if only sometimes).,,M,55,15  months,5/18/2006Email,Atacand
139, 5, BP,None,Taking this to reduce BP as I am Typ 2 Diabetic. First tried Altace which gave me a persistent cough.  Switched to Mavik but still coughing although less.  Now on Atacand for 5 months_ I have no side effects at all.,F,53,5  months,5/13/2006,Atacand
140, 2, High Blood Pressure,Nausea_ Vomiting.,I took the atacand for a total of 32 days. I took it because after doing research on atacand_ I thought it would have the least amount of side effects for me_ so I asked my doctor to precribe it.  I had no side effects for the first 2 weeks_ so I thought I had finally found the perfect high blood pressure medicine_ since lisinopril (side effects were nausea_ cough_ bronchitis_ asthma) and norvasc(extreme swelling that would not go away even when taking a diuretic as well) did not work for me.  After the 2 weeks_ I began getting nauseous after meals and in the middle of the night.  This occurred at least 5 times in the last 2-3 weeks of me taking atacand.  The majority of those times I would get sick almost immediately after a meal_ but I had taken the atacand hours earlier.  I was hoping that the medicine wasn't the culprit so I continued the medicine_ but I kept getting sick. After eating dinner out one evening recently_ I had to pull my car over because I got sick.
