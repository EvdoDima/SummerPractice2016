5, 3, Mild hypertension,At first I was on 4mg and didn't experience anything and my blood pressure was getting lower. My doctor decided to increase dosage to 8mg. One day I experienced severe heart palpations after not eating for a while and having a big meal and developed constant vertigo and dizzyness/lightheadedness that still hasn't gone away. In March 2016 I started getting palpations after eating nearly every meal and it felt like my blood pressure was dropping after meals. I decided to quit cold turkey but experienced withdrawal symptoms so I decided to go down to 4mg for a while. I have now quit Atacand completely for a week though still experiencing withdrawal symptoms and heart palpations after meals. Hoping these symptoms will go away after a while... The side effects were absolutely ruining my every day life. Will have to look into another drug and I am changing my lifestyle.,,M,28,1  years 1X D,5/2/2016,Atacand

9, 2, Chronic Migraine Prevention,I started on a 2mg dose and worked up to 8mg. I have been determined to keep going as I am running out of other medications to try_ however the side effects have been awful. The nausea and dizziness hasn't improved and doing any form of light exercises results in me nearly falling over.

10, 1, Migraine prevention,Worsening of migraines_ severe anxiety,I started at 4 mg and worked up to 16 mg over a period of 6 weeks.  Up to 12 mg there was no impact on my migraine frequency.  As soon as I started 16 mg_ however_ my migraines became daily_ which has never occurred before--I usually got about 6 per month.  It took me 4 days to realize the candesartan was triggering the migraines_ but even after I stopped (cold turkey)_ the migraines continued on a daily basis for 6 more days_ stopping only when I started Amitriptyline 10 mg.  As well_ when I went off the candesartan_ I experienced severe anxiety_ panic attacks_ depression_ and loss of appetite.  It took about a week to recover from these symptoms.  For me_ this drug was poison.  To make matters worse_ my neurologist completely dismissed that the candesartan could have been triggering the migraines.  Reading other reviews on this website about side effects helped me realize I wasn't crazy.,F,44,6  weeks16 mg 1X D,9/23/2015,Atacand

My BP is 120/69 with 58 pulse I am spinning and trying to fight with diet and exercise however at nights my legs and arms fall asleep which makes me panic and I can't sleep - only happened since I took tablets - If the BP continues to drop with diet and NO gluten I will ask to get off these awful drugs!

After being prescribed Nexium for upper gastro burning_ I decided to stop Atacand for 1 week to see what happened.,After only 4 days of stopping Atacand_ my heart palpitations have greatly reduced.  I also stopped taking the Nexium_ as I believe the gastro symptoms were likely Atacand related.  My gastro burning symptoms are also gone.

33, 1, Kidney Protection,I posted the note below as well. So second day off of meds and I cannot speak! I went to the Dr. and he said it swelled my voice box up and my sinuses and that I may not talk for a few days yet. He figures up to 5 days. Takes 48 hours for the drug to leave your body_ but the side effects a little longer. This stuff is poison. I can't take any bp meds.. so good thing bp is good from all the walking but my kidney is not protected. Rather have quality of life though. This is misery.,You are not crazy if you are experiencing panic_ anxiety_ sinus infections_ sore throat_ burning throat_ swollen voice box... get OFF this drug!

34, 1, Kidney Protection,This stuff is not good for me. They had me on it back in 2006 and I had wicked panic attacks.. a sinus infection that lasted a year... I felt like I was going insane... I found this board in 06 and saw what someone had written about his panic attacks and realized it was the drug and I took myself off of it.. don't do that_ though.. my bp spiked but it normalized again. Anyway_ because my one and only kidney leaks protein and recently increased the dr convinced me to try atacand again at a much lower dose... same problems starting all over again... started in the sinus... now it feels like my throat and esophagus are on fire... lots of phlegm_ coughing... just feel crappy. So tomorrow back to my water pill. It keeps my bp steady but unfortunately does not have the kidney protection atacand does... not sure what to do about that...,I hate this crap. What really bugs me is you are given something to make something better but it creates a bunch of other problems.. not quality of life to me.,F,48,5  days4 mg 1X D,3/25/2012Email,Atacand

40, 5, High Blood Pressure,No side effects - a miracle!,I am super sensitive to all drugs_ so I can take almost nothing without bad side effects and allergies.  I had been on Tenormin (atenolol) for many years_ but it no longer was controlling my blood pressure_ it was only lowering my heart rate (something I needed in addition to BP reduction).  I (worriedly) added Atacand to my Tenormin regime in hopes of lowering my uncontrolled BP.  What I really liked was I had no side effects and also the fact that there was no cumulative effect on blood pressure or heart rate reduction between the two - the Atacand controlled only my high blood pressure and the Tenormin continued to control only my heart rate.  Another thing I like is that it is short-acting so I knew when I started it that if there was a problem_ I could stop it and it would be out of my system in a few hours.  I started small (1/4 of a 4mg tab) to test it out and found no side effects_ just a reduction in my blood pressure - a miracle for me!  Now I take an amount based on my current blood pressure - that way I don't overdo it if my BP happens to be low and I don't under-dose it if it's high - the smartest way to dose a short acting drug (take only what you need).  So for me personally_ I take (3x a day) 1/2 a 4mg tab if my BP is in the 130's_ 3/4 of a 4mg tab if it's in the 140's and a whole 4 mg tab if it's 150 or above.  I take 50mg Tenormin 3x a day along with it to keep my heart rate below 80.  No sleepiness_ dizziness or cough! GREAT DRUG!!,F,51,1  years2-4mg 3X D,11/13/2011Email,Atacand

They are really bad. Reasearch has found that high Colesterol is not the problem but why higher cholesterol is being produced in the first place? read and research more about this.
