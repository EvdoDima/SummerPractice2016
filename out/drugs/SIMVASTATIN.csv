2, 3, heart desease,although my colesterol numbers are all good now i cant say that it is because of simvastatin. I also changed my diet_ no red meat or fried foods_ mainly no fast food. I eat chicken_ turkey and tuna_ and fruits and salads. I am stopping simvastatin today because of the side effects I've feeling. Mucscle pain and the real reason is that I feel like I have poison running through my body_ arms and legs_I think most people describe it as tingling. I also feel my heart miss a beat sometimes. I will update at a later date to let evertbody how it works out. I think this is a bad drug for people.
