0, 3, SVT,Insomnia and vivid dreams (and nightmares)_ lack of sex drive_ shortness of breath and gave me extreme PVC's to the point where I had to be on bed rest until the ablation. It also stops working over time so the dose needs to be increased and so do the side effects.,At first I felt fantastic and it took away my anxiety but it was all downhill from there. This medication made my life hell. But it also helped my heart. As horrible as it was to take_ it wasn't damaging my heart. It was actually protecting my heart from damage I would have had if I hadn't used them. If use them again if I had to but I wouldn't be happy about it.,F,29,2  months100,7/1/2016,Metoprolol tartrate
1, 2, High Blood Pressure,Side effects creep up slowly.  Felt very tired each day and had to nap to get through the day.  Stomach ache and gas_ muscles and joints ache_ shortness of breath_ vivid dreams and waking up a few times a night_ gaining weight that I can't lose_ lost my sex drive totally_ blurred vision_ depression and bad moods_ just no energy.  I was a happy dad of two and now I'm a moody_ grouchy_ miserable man.,I felt great when I first started taking this.  Side effects crept up on me slowly.  This medication will change the way you feel about life.  I feel like I'm in a fish bowl looking out.  I would do anything to just be my old self.  Make sure you understand that you CANNOT stop this poison cold turkey_ you have to wean off of it slowly.  If you plan on having sex with your partner_ don't use this stuff_ it takes all your sex drive away.  Just too many side effects......  Don't do it!!!!,M,53,6  months50 MG 2X D,6/5/2016Email,Metoprolol tartrate

3, 4, Inappropriate sinus tachycardia,Fatigue_ depression is worse_ no energy or motivation_ wanting to sleep all the time,I was put on metoprolol to control my heart rate. I used to have episodes of tachycardia almost every day and some of these episodes would be quite severe.

Once it got in the 170s for an hour and a half_ and all I was doing was sitting in class. It literally felt like I was having a heart attack. My depression and chronic fatigue have been worse since taking this drug_ but it is controlling my heartrate very well; my resting heartrate went from 100 to 70_ on average_ and I don't have anymore episodes of tachycardia unless I miss a dose.

I stopped immediately and within 24 hours_ I was urinating again. I told my doctor and he got me back in and my prostate was normal. I tried taking the medicine again months later and again it slowly enlarged my prostate to the point of no urination.

Symptoms were lessoned when I took only Half of my 25 mg's a day and it did not make my BP change in any way.. A little goes a long way_ as people are overdosed on their medications. And most of the time people do NOT! need as much as they are taking.,When I was in my mid thirty's after having 4 children_ I began to have a belly and I was gaining weight and my BP was rising slowly. And in my late 40's into my 50's. My BP was up in the mid 200 BP level. So the BP drug Metoporol brought it down to an average level in the 160's to 180's. Then I met a excellent Gyno and he checked my Estrogen and Progesterone levels and found they were both VERY LOW!! What I have NOW! realized_ that before_ when my BP was rising_ that my Progesterone had been depleting. Low Progesterone constitutes high blood pressure.. Same in a MAN! also and low Progesterone_ constitutes Low Testosterone_ no sex drive_ tired etc. and low Progesterone_ contributes to Prostate Cancer_ becomes Estrogen dominant_ very bad!. I have been taking BI-EST NATURAL Estrogen 1.25 mg which is a level perfect for me. I started with 25mg Concentrated Natural Yam Progesterone_ only a little change in BP_ so tried 50 mg normal BP 117/72_ so I tried 75 mg and it dropped my BP so Low_ almost to dangerous BP levels in high 90's/high 60's. Danger Zone is 90/60. I figure it is because I am still taking 5 mg's of Metoporol and trying to WEAN myself off this BP drug_ so I am going back to the 50 mg's for now_ until I am off Metoporol_ then I will be able to judge accurately_ either 50mg or 75mg_ which one will be my perfect set level for ME! but just 5 mg's is causing me a lot of grief_ the yolk of my chest stings and burns inside_ which causes like a soreness_ feel like I am over a,F,,4  years25 MG 1X D,5/22/2014Email,Metoprolol tartrate

Very tired these past few days and today one of my fingers went numb for about 5 hours. I remembered this happened last time i was on this nightmare drug. I really was thinking I might die and then this evening I remembered some of what I'd read and low and behold all these terrible symptoms are attributed to metoprolol. I read (too late) not to stop cold turkey which is what I did 3 days ago. I was on the 25 dose but don't think I should take any more since its been 3 days. Just horrible.,I would advise to avoid this horrible drug. It has so many terrible symptoms that I am amazed it is legal. They make such a big deal about people taking pain meds and the like_ but the really bad drugs like this one_ no one every says_ reports_ or bans. It affects your mind and dreams badly (and therefore your  Spirit). I suffer from chronic pain but am now determined to deal with a great deal more agony in order to exercise to try and get healthier and will add olive oil and apple cider vinegar.

This might be due to the Metoprolol.,M,52,7  years,9/6/2009,Metoprolol tartrate

56, 2, high blood pressure,shortness of breath_ low pulse_ no energy,I was started on this for high blood pressure (155/78)_ my pulse was fine - 25 mg twice a day. After being on this a while I started having shortness of breath when walking only short distances plus having no energy to do much. My doctor and I have been monitering my blood pressure and it was irratic. Sometimes it was in the 120's and 130's and other times it was 140 and above - so the medication was not really working well. Per the doctor_ I tried to up the dose to 50 mg twice a day but my pulse went so low and the side affects so bad I couldn't. About a week ago I decided to stop taking this medication. I did research on other blood pressure meds and came up with Atacand. Went to the Dr and told him this is what I want to try. Only been on it for 3 days_ so hard to tell but so far no side affects.,F,64,6  months,6/19/2009,Metoprolol tartrate
57, 5, Atrial fibrillation,At the very first_ I experienced shortness of breath when I walked a short distance_ such as to the office from the parking lot_ but then the doctor added Digoxin and the two work perfectly together_ no shortness of breath or any other side effect that I know  of.,I feel pretty lucky about this_ even though I don't like the idea of taking powerful prescription medication_ as I don't know what else it is doing to me or how it might be hurting me.   But without it_ my heart rate would be 128_ 135 somewhere thereabouts_ whereas with Metoprolol_ it is kept down to a reasonable 70 or 80.  This does not control my arrhythmia (it's not expected to)_ only keeps the heart rate normal.,M,61,4  months,2/21/2009Email,Metoprolol tartrate

61, 1, High blood pressure,"Massive weight gain_ since my new doctor put me on 100mg_ twice a day. Hallucinatory nightmares and hallucinations_ especially at night. I would wake up yelling that someone was in the room_ when nobody was. I would also see someone standing by my bed during the middle of the night_ but if i blinked_they were gone. I would ""hear"" people talking in the hallway at night..I ""saw"" a woman walk through the closet without opening a door. Of course it wasn't real_ just med-induced. I thought I was losing my mind!I would get extremely tired_ had no hope for anything anymore. Couldn't concentrate at all. I also had heart palpitations almost all the time. Really bad edema in my ankles and feet.I developed a weird red itchy scaly rash on my shins_ and on my left leg in the back too. This started 3 months after taking the pills. It got progressively worse_ and I thought i might lose my legs if it keeps spreading..but it is now finally healing since I stopped the medication.",I had the nightly hallucinations for a year or so before I quit taking the recommended dosage the doctor recommended. I also gained 50+ pounds in a year_ and I couldn't figure out why for awhile. Until I started researching the medication. I drove my husband crazy with the nightmares_ waking him up each time. I started cutting the pills in half_ then fourths_ weaning myself off of them. Since the doctor refused to switch me_ I found a natural alternative (blood pressurex from theherbsplace.com)and am now totally off metoprolol and will never go back. In fact_ i will never again take prescribed medications as long as I live. Since I no longer trust doctors in any way_ shape or form. For anyone that has ever been told by a doctor that you will have a stroke and die if you quit taking the medicine they prescribe for you_ you won't. As long as you ease up on the medicine slowly and find an alternative to help you. Ask any pharmacist how you can wean yourself off of any medication you,F,50,1.6  years,3/7/2008Email,Metoprolol tartrate

66, 1, mild hypertension,weight gain / water retention (15 lbs)_ increased blood pressure_ increased glucose levels_ shortness of breath_ nightmares_ fatigue_ nausea_ cold hands and feet.,Before starting Metroprolol I had undergone a successful thoracic aortic stent and aortic valve replacement operation. My blood pressure was marginally elevated at 135/75 - 145/85.  After starting on 25 mg Metoprolol as recommended by my cardiologist_ I gained 15 lbs water retention in 6 weeks_ causing blood pressure to rise by up to 30 points_ both systolic and diastolic; blood glucose levels shot up between 40 and 70 mg/dl above where they were before. Other symptoms got worse: shortness of breath_ fatigue_ cold hands + feet_ general lethargy_ nausea and malaise. Have stopped the drug and am gradually getting the poison and excess fluids out of my system.  Have since learned that a significant percentage of patients lack the enzyme to metabolize this drug_ and that it is not recommended for patients who have diabetes or are over 60 years old.  This is a bad drug and I have fired my cardiologist for putting me on it.  Avoid Metoprolol if you can. Avoid cardiologists that try to put yo,M,74,50  days,4/28/2006Email,Metoprolol tartrate
