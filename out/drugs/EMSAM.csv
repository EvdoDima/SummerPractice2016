0, 3, for mdd,insomnia is beginning to make it impossible  to continue at this dosage. I don't think 6 mg will do it: but  I'll try.  I can't use trazadone because it causes seizures_ I take 8 mg Klonopin.  and 100 mg of Atarax.. Parnate didn't  give me same problem. at 50 mg; just not as effective_ The washout period will be hell.,,M,51, 9mg 1X D,5/26/2016Email,Emsam

2, 2, Severe major depression,"Insomnia_ irritability_ fatigue_ ""myoclonic jerks_"" ""visions/hallucinations in side vision_ dry mouth_ balance issues etc.",I feel a little dumb_ in that I only just have realized most of the above are side effects of Emsam. I thought most were due to untreated depression. I even went to an ophthalmologistfor the visions--I now know I also have cataracts--tho' the doc said the visions were due to that. 3 yrs. ago_ I had horrible pain and almost every symptopm of depression you can think of. The pain was physical. I got 6 mos of IV ketamine treatments which took the edge off the pain. Then the Emsam plus Ativan for sleep.  It probably helped some along w/ the ketamine--but there's been no further improvement. I am going back to Pristiq which is helpful to me unless the depression is very severe. Or I might try Viibyrd.,F,63,3  years12.5 mg pa 1X D,10/1/2015,Emsam
3, 5, Major depression,Insomnia_ weight loss_,This is the most effective antidepressant I've ever tried.   I was very suicidal and the minute I put on the patch I felt better.   I have energy_ less emotional and less depressed.    It's expensive but any antidepressant that will help me lose weight is worth it to me.   It also doesn't make you fatigued like other drugs.   At 6mg I can eat and drink whatever I want but on 9 mg you have to cut back on caffeine and other foods that interfere with MAOI's.   So glad my Dr. recommended this!,F,49,1  months6mg,9/27/2015,Emsam
4, 5, Major Depression,After more than three years_ I have had no side effects.,"I had tried every Anti-Depressant since 1994_ nothing worked. At my wits end_ I decided to try ECT_ hoping it would kill me_ but the psychiatrist said to try EMSAM 6mg patch. He said it would work. After three weeks of feeling like I had the flu_ I read all of the instructions again_ and it said_ ""Do not cut."" So I cut it from 6mg to 4mg and in 45 minutes I felt better than I had ever felt in my life. Two days in a row_ I would cut 1/3 of the patch off_ and on the third day_ I would use the 2 pieces of 2mgs which equalled 4mgs. Two boxes lasted me three months. My life changed completely; my depression was gone_ except in times of great stress_ but it still worked well enough.",F,69,3  years4mg,9/27/2015Email,Emsam
5, 4, major depressive disorder,insomnia_ anxiety_ muscle twitching,It has made me increasingly anxious (especially before I cut out caffeine) and the insomnia is terrible_ even now that the doctor has advised me to take the patch off around 7.  At first I had really weird muscle twitches in my mouth and hands but those have gone away for the most part. It has given me increased energy and helped me out of a suicidal bout of depression_ though I still feel flat and humorless. I am going up to 12mg tomorrow and hopefully that will help; Ive read that the true anti-depressant effects dont really kick in until higher doses.  This has helped where most other anti-depressants have failed; I just wish it helped a little more.,F,34,6  weeks9 1X D,8/19/2015Email,Emsam
6, 4, Treatment resistant depression,Insomnia_ loss of appetite.,6 mg patches work best for me. I went up to 9 mg but I had major insomnia and greatly increased depression. 6 mg patches greatly decrease my anxiety and help with the depression without the sleepiness caused by most other depression meds. Though it does not make sense to me_ on several occasions I have cut 12 mg patches in half_ and it does NOT work the same as whole 6 mg patches do. I have a huge increase in depressive symptoms_ agitation and insomnia. Last time I cut a 12 I thought I would have to go to the ER for the severe depression I experienced.,M,51,3  weeks6 mg patch 1X D,4/27/2015Email,Emsam
7, 5, Major Depression (suicidal),6 mg made me feel like I had the flu_ so I cut it down to 4 mg (I'm 5 ft tall_ 125 lbs) and that worked perfectly. I had insomnia_ but Melatonin tablets helped.,I've been using EMSAM for four years and it is the only thing that ever worked. It saved my life.,F,69,4  years4mg,4/2/2015,Emsam
8, 4, Severe Panic anxiety and MMD,Occasional orthostatic hypotension_ I find this is helped by staying well hydrated.,I have tried over 10 medications for my anxiety and depression over the past 4 years and the only thing that came close to working was a combination of Effector XR_ Remron and Xanax. I experienced terrible side effects (30 lb weight gain_ brain zaps_ lightheadness_ insomnia_ upset stomach_ and still had periods of depression and occasional panic attacks) on these medications and eventually decided it wasn't worth it. I am a nursing student so when my psychiatrist suggested an MAOI I said absolutely not because at 21 I was not ready to make that kind of lifestyle/diet changes. I was happy to hear that on a 6mg/24 hour dose I would not have to worry about diet interactions. The only concerns are medication interactions which I was used to from other antidepressant/ antianxiety medications. After a week of starting the patches I have not had a single anxiety attack! (I was averaging about 1 or 2 an hour prior - these were untriggered). My heart rate which was a resting rate of 120 before is now within normal range and I only experience rapid heart rate with caffeine intake. I was extremely hesitant to take this step in treatment but it has been the only thing to work for me. I have slightly low days but I am never too depressed to function any more and my anxiety attacks have completely vanished even with old triggers.,F,21,5  months6 mg 1X D,11/1/2013,Emsam
9, 2, Atypical Depression/EDS,No real side effects.  No problems with patch sticking_ even in the shower_ or while sweating while doing yard work.  No issues with alergic reaction to patch site.,Let me first start by saying_ if you're willing to try Emsam_ be aware of the price.  Most insurance companies will still leave you paying close to $600 a month.  The 6_9_12mg patch all cost the same.  If your doctor wants you on the 6mgs patch_ have him write the script for 12mgs and just cut the patch in half.  You will save money and have a two month supply.  This patch did nothing for me_ except suppress my sugar/carb cravings that come with Atypical Depression.  I was really hoping for relief in my excessive daytime sleepiness/fatigue but it didn't help that at all.  I had no issues with following the diet_ though I must admit I had some parmesan cheese and tried 1 tab beer and had no problems.  Caffeine did seem to increase my heart rate a bit_ but nothing over 110bpm.  If you're going to try a MAOI_ start with Parnate or Nardil.  They are the gold standard_ cost MUCH less_ but you MUST follow the diet restriction on them to a T!,M,31,2  months6/9 1X D,8/27/2013,Emsam
10, 5, Fibromyalgia,Yes_ Emsam is inexplicably flying under the radar. I'd been around the block from time to time with antidepressants for dysthymia or depression. Then I developed fibromyalgia and the treatment methods most doctors use are still in the dark ages. They don't understand fibro and they don't care. After fibro_ I became intolerant to many meds that had been effective in the past. Or_ those old meds no longer worked. I also have IBS (common in fibro patients) and everything ruined my stomach for days. Realizing that I needed to try something completely different from the mood stabilizers_ SNRIs_ SSRIs_ etc. it was either transdermal selegiline or Viibryd. My doctor had a eureka moment when I suggested it. It won't go through my GI system_ I don't have to watch my tyramine at 6mg_ and he had samples right there in his desk that no other patient would've benefited from. They were almost expired_ that's how little attention anyone in his practice paid. Since he was more familiar with MAOIs than new Viibryd_ we gave it a chance. I'm not exaggerating: overnight my depression and anxiety began to lessen. Within a week I had sustained energy_ improved mood_ clearer thinking_ and no dude effects.Here's the major breakthrough and the reason Emsam is seriously_ for everyone's sake_ grossly undervalued. Within 10-14 days I noticed that MY PAIN WAS GONE! Muscle aches_ spasms_ parasthesia_ tender points_ all GONE. I had my sense of humor and libido back. No more brain fog.

14, 3, Atypical Depression,Agitation_ insomnia_ weight loss,EMSAM is very stimulating in addition to being a great antidepressant.  My underlying depression feels much improved compared to my 20 years on Prozac. However_ the agitation offsets these mood gains.  The agitation is both physical (reminds me a LOT of my trial of amphetamine salts) and psychological (anxiety_ irritability).  My doctor raised the dose to 9 mg to see if the serotonin would bump up relative to dopamine and norepinephrine_ which EMSAM boosts first apparently.  Unfortunately_ the agitation has gotten worse_ so I am starting Nardil_ which is supposedly less activating.  My doc says EMSAM is less likely to cause hypotension and_ at the 6 mg dose_ doesn't require dietary restrictions.  Therefore_ it seems like a great first try MAOI_ but it's just too stimulating for me personally.,F,40,4  months9 mg 1X D,5/17/2012Email,Emsam
15, 3, Major depressive disorder,"Severe insomnia at first_ constipation_ weight gain_ addictive tendencies_ skin irritation_ headaches_ increased anxiety. I've been on a few antidepressants that would work for a bit and then just peter out. The best one at first was Effexor_ but when I weaned off of that to get on Emsam it was HORRIBLE. I think I was weaned off too quickly. I'm using Emsam 12mg with lamictal and I definitely have more energy_ but I can't say that I actually feel ""good"". I feel okay_ and for how this drug ws described to me_ I should be feeling fan-frickin-tastic. I'm a vegetarian and have had to severely alter my eating habits. No soy products is not good for me. Also_ I HATE that I can't take any form of allergy or cold medicine when I'm sick. Too many restrictions for not having a great effect. I'm going to ask for something else.

20, 3, Major Depression - severe,Emsam worked great for treating many of the symptoms of my depression.  I was on the lowest dose_ which supposedly has no drug interaction.  I had a stroke (TIA /mini-stroke) while on the patch.  It appears to have been caused by a food interaction (I did not take any other medications while on the patch). I wish that their claims of no food interactions at lower doses were true_ because Emsam did seem to help my depression.,The other scary thing was that the ER staff was unfamiliar with Emsam and almost gave me a med that interacted with it and did actually prescribe a take-home med that had an interaction (I realized it before taking the med_ thank God).  I should note_ the hospital that made the error was a highly rated teaching hospital.  I think that providing patients and the medical community with better education and easier access MAOI's and drug / food interactions information would be a responsible step on the part of the drug manufacturer.  ,F,29,2  weeks6 mg 1X D,8/16/2011,Emsam
21, 5, Major Depressive Disorder w/BPD,Chronic insomnia and orthostatic hypotension,After struggling with major depression and finding that the SSRIs and SNRIs kept failing_ I opted to try Emsam (an MAOI) as a last resort. This drug has worked miracles for my depression_ as I literally lived in a fugue-like state where I was non-functional for months and no other medications helped. Although I find the insomnia to be very difficult to deal with_ it is a worthy trade-off for not being in a depression with suicidal thoughts. When I was experiencing orthostatic hypotension_ I actually contacted the PI that ran the clinical trials for Emsam and within about 12 hours he got back to me with some suggestions and thoughts since this is a very uncommon side effect. His responsiveness and caring made me believe in this medication even more.,F,33,3  months6 mg patch 1X D,8/7/2011Email,Emsam
22, 5, Major Depression,"It's been a year since I stopped Emsam_ so my memory of the side effects is reduced to just the most problematic ones.  At the top of the list is insomnia.  I normally sleep 7-8 hours_ but on Emsam_ I only slept 5-6 hours and much of that was ""light"" sleeping.  As a disclaimer_  I was also abusing caffeine (3-6 cups a day) and chocolate (1 very dark bar per day) and these couldn't have helped.Sexually_ I found it difficult_ but not impossible to have an orgasm.  Erectile function and desire were normal - unlike my experience with many SSRI's and SSNRI's.Taste perversion.  This is a term used in the literature to refer to drugs that change your sense of taste.  What I noticed first was that a beer I had been drinking for years all of a sudden seemed extremely bitter.  For the most part_ this change in taste was not a bad thing because I strangely seemed to like only healthy foods (fruit_ vegetables_ nuts_ etc.) and had little desire for unhealthy ones (desserts_ fries_",This is the best antidepressant I have ever been on.  It wasn't perfect_ but it brought me back from a suicidal brink that no other medications could do (or not without intolerable side effects). After decades of living a muted_ desperate and unsatisfactory life_ I was back reconnecting with friends_ and doing activities that I had given up years ago because of lack of interest (surfing_ hiking_ traveling_ photography_ exercise).I quit taking Emsam after 3 years because of insomnia and a gradual lessening of efficacy.  However_ as I noted under the side effects_ I was also abusing caffeine and chocolate as well as alcohol (2-5 beers/day).  These may have played a part in both the insomnia and the sense that the efficacy was decreasing.  I have read some anecdotal evidence that MAOI's can increase addictive behavior.   I am not sure if this is what happened to me or not_ but the key is not to get started with any of these substances in the first place.  Once you are started with them_ it is very difficult to stop. The good thing_ at least for me_ is that I am now off them.After a year of being off Emsam_ I am ready to try again - sans caffeine_ chocolate and alchol.,M,53,3  years9MG 1X D,6/11/2011Email,Emsam

27, 4, Depression,I have redness at the site where I place the patch for several days after placing it.  This has not interfered with my life until I went to a water park with my son last week.  I was very careful to apply sunblock repeatedly throughout the day.  However...I did not burn anywhere except where the patch had been regardless of how long it had been since I applied it to the site.  That day_ my patch was nicely placed beneath my bathing suit top and I had no problem with that_ but... After a few hours in the sun (and re-applying sunscreen) I began blistering in every place I had placed the patch within the last month at least!  Lesson learned - don't take EMSAM and take your child to a waterpark?  Additionally_ if I place the patch on my back shoulder blade area_ I have extreme burning by the end of the day and want to rip it off.  I have to remind myself that the medication is doing more good than harm and resist the urge to interfere with my treatment!,I have had extreme side effects with other antidepressants and this one does seem to work for me!

Overall_ more insomnia_ but of different style- can be overcome w/ mild sedative (doc chose Sonata)_ good sleep hygiene/routine.  slight manic effect of patches. Can't tolerate the 9mg ones- went crazy anxious manic on those. at 6mg\24.

However_ given my cycling onset of depressive episodes_ SSRIs are not as effective (Cymbalta was @1st_then crazy rapid weight gain_ doc took me off it). The continuous_ transdermal dosing of the patch is what has kept Depression at bay.

Instead of giving it a 1_ I gave it a 2 because I think people with severe depression should be encouraged to at least try something to improve their lives.

34, 5, bipolar (rapid cycling),For the first 6-8 months after I began taking EMSAM I experienced severe acne on my upper trunk and arms -- a shock to the system of a 45 year old man who never had acne before.  However_ this very unpleasant and disturbing side effect diminished considerably by the end of the first year.  Oddly_ I found that once I limited application of the patch to my back_ and no longer applied it to my chest or upper arms_ the acne diminished.  I also experience some insomnia_ of a different and less disruptive sort than I experience when I am having bipolar episodes.  The insomnia is usually quite manageable only occasionally disrupting my daily functioning.  Also_ though it may be unrelated to the EMSAM and more related to the discontinuation of my previous medication_ I note that I have gained significant weight(going from 165 pounds to 210 pounds)since starting the EMSAM although my diet and exercise routine are unchanged or better than they were before.,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (rapid cycling) nearly 20 years ago.  I have been on dozens of medications (all the usual suspects)_ abandoning each in turn for lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects (e.g._ toxicity_ dramatic weight gain_ loss of bladder control_ excessive sedation_ mental dullness or confusion).  My doctor finally prescribed EMSAM_ in combination with Lamictal and Deplin_ and I am thrilled to report that is the first regime that has had any modicum of long-term success (now 18 months) in the treatment of my bipolar disorder.  The bipolar episodes are much more muted_ of shorter duration_ and far less frequent than they were with any other medication regime.  As the side effects are very tolerable compared to the other medications I have used and the efficacy quite high_ this is a ""miracle"" drug for me.

The side-effects were always unbearable.  Major anxiety on the SSRI's_ complete insomnia and horrible paranoia on tricyclics.  From the moment I put the patch on there were no unbearable side effects or really any adjustment period.  Then with each passing day I started to feel more and more ""normal"".  It was gradual_ and after about 3 weeks I realized I no longer felt like I was walking through mud every day in order to function.  My attention and memory increased.  My over-all mood improved.  I no longer got irritated about things I used to get irritated with.  I've been in therapy for years and at best I was only able to ""maintain"" in therapy.

36, 5, MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER,Slight sleeping problems depending on dose...either sleep too much or not at all but thats basically normal for me whether on meds or not. Higher dose seemed to bring on a little anxiety & irritation but it didnt last after adjusting to it. When you increase or decrease a dose you have to remember that it may take a little time for your body to get used to it_  if you get side effects they might go away if you're patient enough to wait it out a couple weeks.,Everyone reacts differently to everything...Emsam happens to be the one thing that has finally worked for me after years of trying numerous meds. But yes i still have to try hard to maintain a normal lifestyle because there is no such thing as a perfect miracle pill_ but this has totally made life easier_ better_ & more content. Especially considering that before i used to have suicidal thoughts constantly & cried all the time_ since i started the patch those have basically disappeared!!! YAY!

Your upper chest or middle of outer arm works well as the patch will not crease or fold as you move around.3. You have to take the small peace of plastic off first and stick it to you skin.  Then take the big peace fold it over to the other small peace and press and move it down tell it comes off you may have to try this a number of times before you get it down.  There should not be any creases in the patch or bubbles for it to work good.Hope this helps every one having trouble with the patch_  I think it's the best product out there for depression if applied wrong it wont work as well if at all.,M,30,4  months,6/9/2008,Emsam
39, 1, depression,Don't even bother trying it. Was neutral in terms of mood and just gave me intolerable insomnia and a chronic urinary tract infection.,Went off it 2 weeks ago and I STILL can't sleepThe cure is worse than the disease.,F,45,60  days,6/7/2008,Emsam
40, 2, Depression,Headaches that would last 1-3 days with no relief.  Insomnia.,I started with the 6mg patch and worked up to 9mg.  During this 2 month span I had about 3 episodes of severe migraine-like headaches that lasted up to 3 days.  Made work unbearable.  Mild insomnia.  Did not help my depression but could not give it longer time due to headaches.  I did almost fall over once getting out of bed due to the drop in blood pressure effect from MAOIs.,F,33,2  months,3/3/2008,Emsam
41, 5, Bipolar Disorder,Some hypomania/mania and insomnia_ see explanation,Emsam was a wonder-drug for me. I believe it worked better than all the SSRI's and tricyclics I have tried over the last 15 yrs. My theory_ the MAOI (Emsam) catches your depression BEFORE you can free fall into a full blown one_ like a trapeze artist's safety net.For the mania side effect_ my doctor decreased the patch (9mg) to every other day--worked great until I had some depression and anxiety over starting a new job. Then we went back to every day. Then some insomnia started_ and I asked my doctor about removing the patch 2-3 hours before sleep. He thought that was a great idea and it worked like a charm.Sadly_ I have to give the patch up as the lithium that I've been taking for almost 6 years_ has shown some lousy side effects. However I praise lithium to the hilt--I initially lost 35lbs on lithium. I am soon to start tegretol as a mood stabilizer and you can't be on an MAOI with that. If it works as well as the MAOI_ I'll be thrilled.Talk to your docs about ways to ge,F,51,16  months,1/30/2008,Emsam
42, 5, treatment-resistant depression,There have been few side effects that have bothered me: dry skin and a red mark that persist for 12-36 hours after removing a patch_ the fact that the patches will fall off if I am too sweaty or the skin flexes too much (mostly with exercise)_ and a worsening of the dry eyes that Ive had since my Lasik procedure in August of 2006.  Ive found that I can minimize the first two issues by washing thoroughly with soap before applying a patch_ and by washing and using lotion after removing it.  A doctor at the clinic where I had my Lasik procedure was able to prescribe Restasis eyedrops_ which have eased the dryness back to its pre-Emsam level.,I've been dealing with depression for about 15 years_ and have tried almost everything; I've been on somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 different antidepressants_ had 8 hospitalizations and 3 separate series of ECT.  Nothing worked for more than a few months at a time (aside from the ECT_ at up to a year)_ if it worked at all.  I was finally talked into trying something in the MAOI family of drugs in May 2006; Id hesitated because of the dietary and drug-interaction restrictions.  I noticed  somewhat reluctantly  a gradual improvement in my mood in the first two weeks of taking this medication.  My mood continued to improve until reaching something resembling stability in July or August 2007_ and has remained there  more or less  since.  To quote a journal entry of mine from July_ it seems just a little easier to do what I need to do_ and things don't seem as hard as I remember them being before. I'm not worrying about things as much_ a,F,27,8  months,1/22/2008Email,Emsam
43, 5, SAD_ADD_and life extension,the first couple of weeks I had a pick me affect and better concentration. sleeping was not sound until after two weeks.I had been in wellbutrun sr for the last cuople of years and very much liked that med. But when emsam came out i tried to get my doc to prescribe it for me_ finally he gave me the prescription last month. I used to order liquid deprenyl from England.,I will take this med and life extension med for life and living longer. look up IAS for more info,M,56,15  years,12/15/2007,Emsam
44, 5, depression,*Mild application site reaction - dry skin_ reddness / discoloration.  Itching goes away after 12-24 hours of removing the patch.  Discoloration lasts around a week before it fades completely.*Insomnia - mostly difficulty falling asleep_ occasionally difficulty staying asleep.  Haven't found a solution yet_ but my doc is exploring the idea of sleeping meds with me.,Neither of the above side effects are anywhere near severe enough to warrant going off of this medication.  None of the 7 other antidepressants I've tried have ever touched my depression.  Emsam has given me an almost complete remission.  I feel more motivated_ have more energy_ and my overall mood has improved significantly.  I'm less irritable_ my self esteem has improved and I'm back to doing things I like_ hobbies and seeing friends and such.  It's not an instant cure_ but it's truly made a difference for me.,F,32,9  months,11/26/2007Email,Emsam
45, 3, general depression with hypomania,Skin irritation from patch_ extremely itchy_ red and sometimes raw_ marks remain for nearly 2 weeks. Lack of motivation_ and it deadened my creative energy and imagination_ especially at full 6mg dose. Also terrible insomnia at 6 mg/day. General skin irritation and breakouts_ and frequent cold sores. At full 6mg/day dose_ had unusually high libido but difficulty reaching orgasm!,Still not sure about this stuff after a year! I've cut back to half a 6 mg. patch for half a day every other day (less than 3mg a day) and still feel that it keeps me from sinking all the way down when I start to get depressed and anxious. It lifted the general depression that I was under most of the time for years_ made me feel like it was worth being alive after all. Also makes me less hypersensitive and emotionally reactive to everything_ which is good in some ways but not in others. I've got my imagination back_ which I needed since I'm a writer. I'm not sure if it's still affecting my sleep at this dose. But I still feel completely unmotivated to do daily things_ can't keep track of things at all (like bills and finances)_ have some memory problems and mix up words a lot. I don't get anxious about the future_ but I can't make plans_ either. I had some of the same problems on Celexa: couldn't think clearly and didn't care enough to worry about all the stuff I was messing up. Still,F,50,13  months,10/5/2007,Emsam
46, 2, DEPRESSION,NONE,Felt a buzz the morning of the 2nd day_ but do not believe its doing much now.  I am at 6/24.,M,54,19  days,9/27/2007Email,Emsam
47, 4, Atypical Depression/ Panic Disorder,Took 3.5 weeks to get any benefits at all. At that time_ the panic attacks went into remission for a couple of days and then returned intermittently for a week until I contacted the doc. Upped the dose to 9mg patches at that point. At 9mg after 4 days I began to have a hypomanic onset of anger and hostility. Also had a marked increase in energy which I really liked. Have been having to mix the 6mg and 9mg patches back and forth every few days to keep out of depression/panic on the bottom end and out of hypomania on the top end. Note: I e-mailed a doc that assisted with the research of EMSAM_ turns out that you CAN cut the patch safely and so I have started doing so. Jury is out on the exact amount I need_ I am guessing 8mg.,I had almost given up at 3 weeks_ but am happy now I didnt. The one thing it has not helped with at any dose has been the generalized anxiety but that is usually a GABA related issue and I wouldnt expect EMSAM to help that. Also_ lost weight and began a great workout routine due to the stimulant effects at a higher dose. Started it 12/23/2006 and am still using it today. Overall it is the second best med I have used through the years (I have been on 27 different ones in 15 years) with Celexa being the best but lost its punch after about 3 years.,M,34,9  months,9/19/2007Email,Emsam
48, 1, Depression,The discomfort of the adhesive and the remnants of the patch stay for days or more.,It simply didn't work for me.  There was some early relief_ but it peaked so quickly and tailed off to nothing in a few months.

50, 3, chronic depression,I had terrible nausea the first week I started Emsam but it finally went away.  I started experiencing insomnia about the second week but it comes and goes.  About the 3rd week I had abdominal pain and started having blood in my urine.,I do not feel Emsam is helping my depression much.  I am waiting to up my dosage to see if it might finally kick in for me.  I am afraid it might be causing bladder/kidney problems.,F,40,5  weeks,6/13/2007,Emsam
51, 5, Depression,No real side effects to speak of. I normally get a reaction from adhesives_ I can't wear a band-aid without a rash but I have had no irritation or redness with this patch.  I've had more vivid dreams. There are NO negative sexual side effects_ it seems to enhance sex if anything...but maybe that's just because I'm not depressed anymore.,"LOVE it_ I call it the ""happy patch""   :   )",F,45,4  days,4/15/2007,Emsam
52, 3, Major Depression,Red outline of patch remains several days after removed,"Started 6 mg patch after SSRIs stopped working and nothing else I tried ""stuck"" for depression relief.  I think Emsam is helping_ but jury is out.  6th day on 6 mg had a massive ""rage"" episode - threw everything I touched and slammed every door for a couple of hours before escaping to bed.  After that got depressed again and couldn't control crying.  Upped dose to 9 3 days ago.  First few days of new dose it definitely stops the constant teariness/weepiness_ but it's not the ""rebirth"" I felt when I first took Zoloft 3 years ago and had the most ""normal""_ depression-free year of my life (until it just stopped working).  On Emsam_ I continue gaining weight rapidly (leave it to me to GAIN weight while depressed instead of lose) and feel fat pushing out on my skin which is quite uncomfortable.  Not sure if it is Emsam related or not.  Dr. wants to increase dose.",F,37,13  days,4/12/2007,Emsam
