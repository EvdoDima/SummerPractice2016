2, 5, Low back pain when sitting,None,Firstly_ be advised that I am a chiropractor_ so I know a thing or two about back pain.I began having pain after my wife treated me on one of my chiropractic tables.  Next time I will actually see a real chiropractor.  Anyhow_ the next day I developed spasm and pain while sitting.  It got a little better_ but I still had a lot of pain while sitting_ especially driving.  The pain was quite severe when sittting on a hard surface.  I got sick of it and got this med from my MD friend upstairs in the same building as me.  Within the first dose I could see a big change_ and by the end of the 2nd day my pain was gone.  I took 3 pills per day for the 1st week_ 2 pills per day for the second week_ and then 1 pill per day for 4 additional weeks.  When I stopped taking it_ the pain came back about 25%_ but not entirely.  I have been off of it for about 2 weeks now and still feel significantly better then I did prior to taking it_ but not as good as when I was on it.  Overall_ I am very pleased.,M,38,6  weeks35mg 3X D,12/10/2014,Zorvolex

4, 5, KNEE PAIN,NO bad side effects so far,I Took my first pill about four hours ago. In about a hour I told my husband that I  was feeling less pain. If anything I feel a little euphoric. I don't know if it is because my pain had subsided some_ or if this pill is working as an antidepressant. At any rate I am enjoying it now!,F,69,1  days35MG 3X D,8/25/2014Email,Zorvolex
