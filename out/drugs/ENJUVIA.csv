0, 1, Menopause,Thought I had pneumonia_ steep throat_ ulcers_ dementia_ broken ear drums......HORRID SIDE EFFECTS. Stopped right away_ and felt better in 48 hours. Nausea and dizziness left me unable to walk or function at all.fluid in lungs_ and swollen body.,Horrid plant estrogen.,F,53,10  days0.45 mg,6/6/2015Email,Enjuvia
1, 4, hysterectomy,I have noticed no side effects -other than the obligatory weight gain I would love to blame on Enjuvia rather than self-gratification!,When I missed a pill_ I did not have the immediate headache by morning that I used to have on Premarin. Enjuvia seems to do a better job of replacing my hormones as I noticed increased energy and enthusiasm for life within a week or two of starting it.,F,54,1  years1.25 1X D,8/24/2010,Enjuvia
2, 4, surgical menopause,None at this dose. Breast pain with higher dose_ but that's to be expected.,Not as potent or long lasting as Premarin_ but no side effects. The manufacturer needs to offer higher doses than the 1.25 mg. I have to take a .9mg plus a .625mg daily to feel right and it's expensive.,F,52,6  months1.525 mg 1X D,5/3/2010,Enjuvia
