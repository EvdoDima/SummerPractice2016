0, 2, prevent pregnancy,MOOD SWINGS_ Nausea_ slight weight gain_ migraines_ hair loss,Since starting taking Nordette_ I have had severe mood swings.  I feel 'off' ALL THE TIME_ but worse in the week before I get my period.  I feel literally crazy.  I want to scream one minute_ then cry the next.  I know I'm being irrational_ but can't control it.  I am not like this when off the pill.  When I initially started taking it 6 months ago_ I was nauseaus for 2 months straight.  The nausea still comes and goes.. maybe I've just gotten used to it.  I've also had two terrible migraines which effected my life and work functionality.  I've gained approximately 10lbs since being back on the pill.  And recently I noticed hair loss.  This is a new 'symptom'.  I'm switching to loestrin this month... although they all seem to be awful.  Maybe it'll be the lesser of the evils.. wish me luck!,F,27,6  months,8/28/2007,Nordette-21
