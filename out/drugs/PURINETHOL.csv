2, 5, Crohn's,Hair loss_ fatigue_ low immune system_ easy to catch colds and other illnesses.,Been taking Purinethol for 10 years. When I compare the pain I was in before starting this medication_ I would do it all over again. It has helped tremendously. I am currently coming off the drug since Purinethol isn't meant to be taken on a long term basis due to developing certain cancers. I have been blessed with two beautiful children while my disease was stabilized. I was unable to breastfeed because of the drug. Overall_ my experience was good!,F,37, 50 MG 1X D,11/16/2015,Purinethol
3, 4, crohns,Higher dose of 75_ then 50 mg gave  me a rash. 25 mg daily  has settled  it. I feel  like I  have  a totally different  body since  I  have  been  on 6mp. I feel  it's  slowly  killing  me. However  I'm  too scared  to  stop it. 4 re sections  over 42 years and  many drugs and  therapies  inbetween. My joints are stiff and  im constantly  fatigued.  I've  gained  8 kg and  my  hair  is very  thin BUT  I  am alive  and  doing  better  than  I  have  been  for  years. I'll  keep  taking  it.,,F,54,2  years25mg,8/11/2015,Purinethol
4, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,Very slight nausea/loss of appetite. Easy bruising + some hair loss.,Compared to my severe symptoms of UC this has been the only drug that has helped (apart from prednisone) and made life liveable again.

14, 4, Crohns,Non that I have noticed_ apart from weight gain. but thats a good thing.,I was diagnosed with Crohns in 2007. I have been on many different drugs for it. At one point I had to take 9 pills a day for the first year which worked for a while_ but eventually my body became immune to those drugs_ so in the end it did not help. After walking for almost 2 years with bloody washroom sessions (sorry) and constant pain_ trips to the washroom and losing about 25 lbs_ my Dr. finaly did some more testing and put me on Pretnison together with Purinethol. After 8 weeks I was off of the Pretnison and have been on Purinethol ever since. Even though I know I'm not cured_ I sure do feel that way_ no side effects_ my blood and liver looks good and I can live a normal life again. In the last 5 months alone I've gained back my 25 lbs plus an extra 10 lbs on top of that. I feel great apart from the occasional fatigue_ work out at the gym with no issues_ and as a musician am able to perform without any flare ups right before the shows. Sorry to hear about the others who have issues with this drug_ but I find it a miracle drug!,M,29,8  months50 1X D,5/13/2011,Purinethol
15, 3, crohn's disease,very fatigued_ dizzy_ trouble sleeping_  poor appetite_ and some nausea.,I've had Crohn's disease for over 20 years and was in remission for 15 until 2 years ago_ due to stressful situations in my life. I just worked up to 75mg a day and have noticed that I have less energy then ever before. I noticed my platelet count is costantly rising. I'm not sure what that means_ I will have to discuss this with my Dr_ I suppose. I've taken the next 5-6 months off work_ as I'm too tired and keep catching colds etc.. As a nurse_ working with the homeless_ I'm constantly exposes to various illnesses. All I can say is I hope this works!,F,36,3  months75mg 1X D,3/17/2011Email,Purinethol

17, 5, Crohn's Colitis,Some fatigue_ easy bruising dry hair and skin.,For the most part I feel blessed. I have had Crohn's disease since I was 24 and am now 54! I was on everything you can think of..prednisone_ sulfa drugs etc.I am currently on 50 mg of 6mp and 3 Asacol in the evening and 25mg of 6mp with 3 Asacol at night. I also take a prescription dose of Folate (Folic Acid) 5mg every night. I have had 1 fistula surgery and 2 colon resections. Since starting 6mp in 2000_ I have nearly been in complete remission_ except for a yearly cold and/or sinus infection_ some fatigue and dryer hair and skin. I do bruise a bit easier as well. With that said_ for me_ this was a life saver! I have my blood checked every 3 months and so far so good...Every day without dealing with that awful disease is a gift!,F,54,10  years75 mg 1X D,10/5/2010Email,Purinethol
18, 2, crohns/colitis,Was on immuran_ got too much joint pain_ and hard time sleeping. Purinethol seem to be fine but now that i'm into my 2nd month_ I feel tired_ nausea_ and just fatiged_ sleeping is starting to get bad again_ along with joint pain!,,F,34,2  months75 mg 1X D,9/9/2010,Purinethol
19, 1, Ulcerative Colitis,Exhausted_ Nauseaus_ Weak_ No Energy_ Hair thinned out dramatically_ no appetite.  Complete inability to digest any carbohydrate.  Blew up like I was 6 months pregnant every time.,"I've been dealing with Ulcerative Colitis for 20 years and thought this was finally the answer:  just SHUT DOWN my immune system so it became impossible for it to flare-up again - perfect!  But I was wrong.  I took this drug for a year and slowly became weaker and weaker_ had no energy_ got a cold or sinus infection about every 6-8 weeks_ was nauseaus and could only eat simple carbs because I was nauseaus_ my hair thinned out a lot (I actually have gorgeous Barbie hair_ so this was really terrible)_ but strangest of all:  I am left with a complete inability to break down Fructose.  Apparently it is metabolized in the liver_ and after a year of taking this drug_ my liver seems to no longer have that ability.  So any time anything with Fructose sneaks into my food_ I blow up like I'm 6 months pregnant and have to go to bed.  It is a horrible effect and seems to be irreversible.  I originally thought it was Yeast_ but my GI was able to diagnosis it with a series of hydrogen breath tests and confirm Fructose Malabsorption.  So my advice to anyone contemplating 6MP:  DON'T.  Just get off all meds.  Slowly but surely_ get off them.  Go to an acupuncturist or holistic practitioner.  DRAMATICALLY overhaul your diet to clean_ healthy foods_ and DRAMATICALLY overhaul your lifestyle to keep emotional stress at a minimum.  I've only had one ""allergy-induced"" flare-up in 5 years and I haven't been on any meds since the hell that was 6MP.  You have to change your lifestyle - you",F,33,1  yearsdon't rem 1X D,6/20/2010Email,Purinethol
20, 5, Crohn's,Fatigue_ lack of energy.,I have been taking Purinethol for almost five years and so far so good. I'm getting married in August and I would like to have a baby very soon. I have read mixed reviews on pregnancy and purinethol. At this point I think that I will probably stop taking it but I'm afraid that I might get sick again. Any advice?,F,29,5  years75mg 1X D,5/28/2010Email,Purinethol
21, 1, Crohn's Disease,Nausea_ brain fog_ fatigue. At 12 weeks I got shingles.,I was on 6-MP for 18 weeks. It had clearly suppressed my immune system as I came down with shingles which I've never had before. As I reduced my prednisone it was clear it wasn't working as all my Crohn's symptoms came back. As soon as I stopped the 6-MP the brain fog lifted. I'm now on low dose naltrexone which has been really effective with few side effects - the best Crohn's med I've taken,F,54,18  weeks50mg 1X D,5/5/2010,Purinethol
22, 5, ulcerative colitis,The last 4 years I've had skin cancer; I also have genetic/environment risks however I have had several squamous that required some reconstructive surgery. I have other skin problems as well. Exercise is a must however the body sometimes just can't do it_ never in the morning but I think that is part of the illness.  I have real difficulty with acension work.  I've had a heart stress test and was told the heart was fine however I was dehydrated_ I couldn't completely finish the test because I almost fainted.  I'm thinking it had more to do with the medication and its impact on anemia readings in the blood work.,I was steroid dependent when I started taking purinethol and it took 1 1/2 years to transition.  I have had periodic breakthru bleeding over the years however my current dose plus 3 Lialda a day usually will hold me.  I used to think I could stop the purinethol however it takes me months to get the bleeding to stop and my UC under control_ even with steriods.  I am religious about keeping up with the required blood work monitoring.  I rarely get a cold or flu virus so I think I am at the right dose on this medication_ keeping my immune system from overreacting.  I used to have severe allergies.  I do bruise easier and sometimes with the skin cancer work I don't clot quickly so they cauterize.  I still have periodic joint pain and redness in my elbows. Severe right sided pain flares still occur a couple times of year. For me_ as much as I dislike the side effects_ this drug has allowed me to keep my large intestines and am cancer free (my grandfather died of colon cancer).,F,52,17  years75 mg 1X D,4/27/2010Email,Purinethol
23, 1, Crohns Disease,A severe headache and diarrhoea which caused my Crohns to flare up.,MP6 gave me diarrhoea within a day of first taking it which flared up my Crohns. I was down to 1 a day on my 3rd 8 week session of prednislone but had to go up 4 a day as my CRP was up because of the diarrhoea the 6MP gave me. The next day I woke with a thumping headache and over the next week it got so bad I couldn't sleep with it (I only realised later that the headaches were worse in the night because I took 6MP before I went to bed). The GP said it was because of the increase of steriods and gave me tylex. This had no effect on the pain. 2 days later I went to A+E there after blood tests they found my CRP was 190 but they didn't know why?as my crohns was fine. I told them that it was the 6MP as I had been given Imuran before the 6MP and that didn't agree with me either. after 2 days of testing including a lumberpuncture they stopped the 6MP and within 2 days the headach was gone. But I was left with an enlarged liver and maybe some liver damage. My CRP is still up at 55 and I'm anemic. The doctor said that they had researched 6MP and there were no record of Headache as a side effect. But thats the side effect I got and just as well or who knows what damage this drug could have done to me. I spent a total of 8 days in hospital. If u have to take this drug be careful and just because a side effect isn't on the insert doesn't mean these drugs arn't causing it good luck :-),F,38,3  weeks5mg 1X D,4/8/2010,Purinethol
24, 5, UC,A little tiredness initially but not so bad now,I have had UC for 10 years after stopping smoking. Initially I was  not sure about this drug but since being on the Purinethol I have not had any major flare ups and must say that it is controlling my UC well. I did notice some tiredness at first but that has either reduced over time or maybe I simply got used to it_ Either way I manage to work play and run a few miles a week. I'm fine feeling a little tired if the alternative is cramping pains weight loss and spending half my life either in or seeking a bathroom!,M,54,2  years75 1X D,3/21/2010,Purinethol
25, 4, Crohn's disease,Fatigue_ memory problems_ hair loss but it grows back,Have had Crohn's for 31 years. Other meds did not work as well.  Not sure if I want to risk having a Crohn's flare to try to stop the 6MP and see if my fatigue lessens.,F,49,4  years75 mg 1X D,3/7/2010,Purinethol
26, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,None,"I have been ""on"" 6MP for five years_ after other meds for UC did not prevent symptoms and flares.  It worked for me almost immediately.  Although I experienced no side effects_ I decided to see how low a dosage I could get away with.  I only need to take 100 mg about once every two months in order to prevent return of UC symptoms.  It is true that I had a relatively mild case of UC_ but still_ bad enough to land me in the hospital twice in the first 18 years since I was diagnosed_ and I was never free of symptoms until I started 6MP.",F,56,5  years,12/10/2009,Purinethol
27, 4, ulcerative colitis,tiredness_ lack of concentration_ loss of appetite_ dry skin_ slight loss of hair_ mood swings,i was diagnosed 2 years ago with UC and 6MP definetly saved me from a lot of pain etc etc. however_ i still hopw there is a way of weaning myself of it. i would hate it to effect my fertility,M,18,2  years,11/29/2009Email,Purinethol
28, 3, Crohn's Disease,Bloating_ rapid weight gain_ headaches_ joint pain_ nausea.,Was on Azathioprine for a couple years_ which gave me no problems.  Not sure why_ but doc switched to Purinethol a few months ago.  Since the switch_ I have developed frequent headaches_ nausea (which I have never really had before on meds)_ moderate to severe joint pains and rapid weight gain.  I will be contacting doc to go back to Azathioprine if possible.,F,37,60  days,11/13/2009,Purinethol
29, 3, ulcerative colitis,chronic fatigue_ skin sensitivities_ skin cancers_ joint pain_ depression_ weakness_ difficulty concentrating,I have had uc for 16 years and I take 100mg of 6mp in conjuncture with lots of asacol.  This keeps my colitis from flaring up and my last colonoscopy looked great.  But at what cost?  I feel like it's eating up the rest of my body.,M,44,7  years,10/2/2009,Purinethol
30, 4, Crohn's,Nausea_ faintness_ dizziness and fatigue at first_ which subside after about one month. Still have lack of appetite_ possibly worsening of acne and tiredness.

Took this drug in the past for 3 years.,M,28,4  months,8/19/2009,Purinethol
31, 5, Crohn's,Just a lite fatigue. But I aways feel great.,This is the only medicine that has saved my life. I have had crohn's for 25 years.H Had my share of fistula and was on disability.

32, 4, crohn's,nausia,i was diagnosed with the disease 3m before i turned 11 and have been on an immune suppresant before for about 3yrs but when i started it i was put onto entocort too and had a side effect of nausia. ive only been on purinethol for a short while now but was again put on the entocort at the same time. only real side effect was nausia but i dont know which was causing it. this has since disappeared. my guts arent cramping and only occassionally ache for short peroids and my stools have firmed up quite a bit and im going to the toilet less. food intake is about the same. am alittle tired but thats prob due to the late nights and boredom looking for a job_ but after saying all that i dont know which of the two drugs is helping the most_ or if its the combo or if my body reacts well to these drugs. im having a blood test today_ so heres hoping its all as good as it seems.,F,24,2  weeks,4/6/2009Email,Purinethol
33, 4, Crohn's Disease,None that I'm aware of.,I started taking this along with Remicade infusions.  I take 50mg a day.  This along with the Remicade helped_ but I eventually decided to stop the Remicade treatments.  My GI doctor put me on opium tincture_ and that seemed to kick my flare.  Since then_ I've been pretty normal & just take the 6mp every day.  Anyone who's not having much luck with anything else aside from steroids may want to look into opium tincture or a similar narcotic since narcotics themselves cause constipation...kind of like a reverse effect.  It was an extremely small dose_ so I didn't feel anything & was able to go about my day normally without any side effects.  Just don't overuse any narcotics...I just read on about.com that the OVERuse of narcotics may cause Toxic Megacolon.  Great things we with IBD get to worry about_ right?,F,28,4  years,3/23/2009,Purinethol
34, 4, ulcerative colitis,When I first started taking 6mp i had leg pains for the first 2-3 months_ then it went away. Didn't notice any hair loss_ maybe a little bit of fatigue. I used to take it in the morning now I take it at night to fight off the fatigue and it seems to work. Also noticed recently that my cuticles are starting to crack and became sore.,I have had uc from 1999. Usually had mild flare-up every few months. Had a severe flare-up in 2006 where I had lost 20 lbs in two weeks and was dehydrated. That got me into trying some herbal supplements I read about in Jini Patel Thompson's book. I continued to take asacol until I had my last flare in 9/2007. Had to take Prednisone and then started the 6MP at 50mg a day. I have been free of any symptoms since I (reluctantly) started the 6mp.(No more Prednisone) I am starting to implement more holistic healing so that I can start to wean myself off of the 6mp but it has help me tremendously.,F,51,15  months,1/30/2009,Purinethol
35, 5, CHRONS DISEASE,originally was more tired_ but thats better now. ive had the longest cold ive ever had this year...maybe due to this drug_ i dont know. for the most part_ ive had little problems and its working. blood counts are normal.,,,,120  days,1/13/2009,Purinethol
36, 4, Crohns,slight hair loss_ low immune system_ light trouble sleeping_ little weight gain,I was diagnosed with Crohns 11mo ago. In & out of the hospital for a reoccurring abscess_ took endocore_ pentasa & prednisone & azothioprine together_ finally had surgery to remove a portion of my intestine since it would not go away. My GI doctor put me on Purinethol about 4 months_ I have felt pretty good_ I noticed I get sick easily. I hope that this continues to do good things for my Crohns. My question is it ok to take things like probiotics & immune boosting suppliments for normal health (like colds) or do they counter act the Purinethol,F,23,4  months,1/6/2009Email,Purinethol
37, 4, Crohn's of large,been so long so not sure what is Crohn's_ what is purinethol and what is just me,Been taking for so long I don't know. But recently talked to sister in law who was on it just a year_ and said she felt so much better energy and mood wise after getting off  of it. Got me thinking. I can't remember ever not feeling tired in my adult life_ unless I drink a lot of coffee. Maybe that would be the case anyway. I have had 5 episodes of bad depression in 20 years and still is low grade. As far as the crohn's_ purinethol has always helped and when I tried to get off it_ I immediately had terrible pain. I have only had to have one surgery so far and on 50mg now_ I feel lucky but wonder why my fatigue/ mood issues exist.,M,38,20  years,12/26/2008,Purinethol

Have some days where I can't get out of bed_ which is depressing as hell.,Been on the drug about 5-6 weeks so far_ running to the bathroom less but also unable to eat bc I feel so lousy_ so that may be why. Stomach cramps and joint swelling have not reduced_ was told must be on drug 4 months to see positive results.

So far I've had no colitis symptoms_ but I've only been off the prednisone for 5 weeks.

53, 3, Crohn's Disease,hair loss_ joint & body aches_ excessive sweating_ extreme tiredness,I'm very leary about this medication. I was on it in 2002-2003 and stopped taking it because I hated the way it made my body feel.  I also had Remicade Infusions in 2003.  I cannot tell if it helped.  I was hospitalized this past August for a really bad Crohn's flare up.  My doctors brought up 6MP again and even though I had been against it for the last few years_ I decided to trust them since they stated many patients are on it with high success rate.  I've been on Prednisone since March and am finally down to only 10 mg a day (I wean by 5 mg per week).  I've been on 6MP again since August and started at 50mg a day and now am taking 75mg a day.  My blood work so far has been good but the way I feel is horrible.  I'm tired of waking up every day and feeling like I have the flu.  I don't know which is the lesser of two evils.  I've also come down with a bad cold/cough this week and fear that my immune system is very weak.

54, 3, Crohn's,None initially. However_ after about 2 years on 100 mg. I began to develop skin cancers.,My dosage was eventually reduced after some blood work to 75 mg. and I stayed there for the next 4 years or so. The skin cancers began to appear in greater numbers_ first as basal cell then as the more aggressive squamous cell. No doctor made the connection; they all assumed I spent too much time in the sun. I discovered on my own the increased risk of squamous cell development in patients taking purinethol and I asked both my gastro and my dermatologist about it. Neither would admit it although they acknowledged the studies I found. After developing a new series of squamous cell cancers a few months ago_ I just stopped the medication. If anyone is interested_ try natural flax oil softgel capsules. I feel better than I have in years. Purinethol seems to have stopped the flares_ but it has ravaged my skin. I'm better off without it_ and if you'll research GI studies using flax oil in Crohn's patients_ I think you'll be surprised.

My question is that the doctor told me to no drink more than 2 beers a week simply because I need to take blood tests for the first couple months on 6mp.

66, 2, Crohn's Disease,Made me feel sick in the morning after I took the pill. After the doctor bumped up my dose_ I felt more sick and eventually wound up in the hospital with mild pancreatitis which I believe was caused by the 6-MP.,Initially prescribed Prednisone_ Asacol_ and 6-MP all at once. Prednisone made me feel 100% better but the doctors worried about long term effects and tapered me off. The 6-MP seemed to be making me sick_ esp. after the doctor increased the dosage. I wound up in the hospital for a few days with mild pancreatitis which I believe was caused by the 6-MP. Once off of all medications but Asacol (and over the counter drugs such as Immodium and Digestive Advantage Crohn's) I felt good and was later diagnosed as being in full remission.  SUMMARY: It's hard to evaluate Crohn's medications because they make you take so many all at once.

I believe it has put my crohn's into remission_ and am hoping to try for another baby whilst continuing on the 6mp. Have done loads of research_ and would rather maintain remission on the drugs than risk a flare whilst pregnant!  I stopped taking 6mp for 4 months to try for a baby (with no luck)_ and the crohn's flared_ so was back to square one_ and don't want to risk that happening again! I don't find that I get any more colds/flu/illnesses because of it either.

95, 2, Crohn's,Fatigue_ lowered immune system response_ joint aches_ lack of appetite...etc.,Generally I feel like complete and utter crap on this med.  My history: I was diagnosed with Crohn's 22 years ago_ and have been off and on this med since I was 17. Usually I'm on it for a year or two_ then I go off it for several years. I've heard this medication can do good things for some people_ and by the looks of the responses this is true.  In one and a half months time if my new dose (started a month ago) doesn't show any effect at keeping Crohn's under control my G.I. specialist is going to do some metabolite tests to see if my liver is properly handling the medication (FINALLY!).  Generally I notice no effect from this medication.  Since I've recently fallen prey to clinical depression the appetite supression from the Zoloft and Purenithol have conspired to make me feel sick.  I will probably go off of this med regardless of how the metabolite tests turn out.,M,34,1  years,2/23/2006Email,Purinethol

Rappid heart rate. I also noticed red dots on my feet and itching_ which I didn't attribute to the 6MP-but saw that many others had this same side effect.,Brief History: Found out I had Crohn's when I was 6 months pg (June of 2005). Had two surgies during my pregnancy. Had peritonitis and removed my appendix_ gall bladder and had a colon resection. Then they needed to restich my colon. Baby was born early but is doing great! Have been on prednisone (started at 80mg finally down to 2.5 mg!!)_ pentasa (250mg 16 pills a day)_ and 6-MP for 4 months.The bruising really concerned my dr so after 4 mos. he ordered me to go off the 6MP cold turkey. Today is my first day off it. I'm sure it will take longer to feel better. While I hate the side effects_ I hope the Crohn's stays somewhat under control.

No real side effects to speak of and a healthy weight gain once it started helping. I still flare-up to some degree from time to time but have had success with the antibiotic Cipro which usually helps if I use it for a week or two.

In January 2000 was completely obstructed and had laparoscopic ileocolic resection to fix.

117, 4, Chrone's Disease,Slight fatigue_ nauseous,I was absolutely petrified to start taking this drug due to all the potential side effects and more importantly the controversy over whether it is safe to take while pregnant (although not currently pregnant_ it is definitely in my near future -knock on wood). My Chrone's was fairly inactive up until 2 months ago when I was hospitalized with a severe abscess.  I luckily avoided surgery and the abscess was treated antibiotically. To prevent this from happening again_ my Dr's placed my on 1500 mgs of Cipro (to heal this infection temporarily)_ 3000 mg of Pentasa and 50mg of 6mp a day. I hesitated to start taking the 6mp for about a month as I was too scared based on what I have read about it. After many consultations with top obgyn dr's and gastro specialists_ they advised me it was in my best interest to begin this drug and they would stop it immediately if any of the side effects became unbareable. Needless to say_ I am feeling great (better than ever) and have had minimal side effects. In addition_ my obgyn follows 6mp/pregnancy very carefully and said much of the new research in the last few months is very positive in respect to this issue. I will definitely cross that bridge when necessary BUT...with MUCH hesitation i started this drug and have to say_ It has proven my inhabitions wrong.

I'm in complete remission_ and I'd never even know I had UC.  Before taking purinethol_ I was on Colazal and high doses of prednisone_ which had unfortunate side effects for me.  Once I started purinethol_ I was able to eliminate the steroids for the first time.  I've been steroid-free for almost 9 months after having been dependent on them for a year.  Also_ purinethol is tasteless and is very easy to take (just 1.5 small pills per day).  The blood tests are no big deal.

148, 1, crohn's disease,None_  I have not taken the drug yet.,I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease 5 months ago.  However_ I am sure I have had the disease for at least four years and maybe even as many as 12 years (despite my efforts to uncover the source of my severe discomfort_ I was undiagnosed and may have been misdiagnosed as having endometriosis - none was ever found with laparoscopy.  Based on what I am reading_ I am very lucky that my disease is being controlled by 400 mg of Asacol (9 times per day).  I hope that everyone on 6mp_ especially those that are having severe side effects_ are aware that there is genetic testing that can and should be done to determine your tolerance for the drug before it is prescribed.  I have been tested and can tolerate the drug if needed.  I hope this helps.  Good health to all.,F,40,0  days,8/31/2004,Purinethol

On and off high dosages of prednisone for years. Was in remission from age 30 to current age 41. Recently relapsed and placed on 6mp. Although I never complained about the prednisone therapy_ I did not want to go back on the drug unless absolutely necessary. MD wanted to try 6mp. So far in the last month of usage_ abdominal pain decreasing_ energy level increasing_ stress management more tolerable. Unsure if related to the 6mp but hopeful. Accepting the fact that I came out of remission is harder to deal with than any side effect.,F,41,32  days,8/1/2004Email,Purinethol

157, 5, Crohn's,A little bit of hairloss at the beginning_ but after 2 mos. my hair began to grow back.,I was so afraid to begin this drug_ but like most every drug there are side-effects.  I have a wonderful Dr. who was very up front with me and told me EVERYTHING about this drug.  I decided the risk of taking it was better than what would happen if I didn't.  Slight hair loss bothered me at the beginning_ but that could have been from prednisone_ iron infusions_ etc.  I have been pleased with how I have responded to it and have not had any major problems as a result of the drug.  I do take very good vitamins (probiotics) and have only been sick once with bronchitus and horrible sinus infection.  Amazingly_ I was over it in about two weeks and I attribute this quick recovery to the vitamins I am taking.  I keep my blood work appointments faithfully every month and all my counts are good.  I do hope to be off the drug in a year or two_ but am OK with staying on it longer if necessary.  I too_ am concerned about the long term effects -- liver damage_ etc.  Because that is irreversable!!!  But I must say_ so far_ so good.,F,32,12  months,7/6/2004,Purinethol

I was on 50mg per day_ which isn't too bad. Also_ it can be very expensive unless covered by an insurance plan. By far_ Remicade is more effective but is also much more expensive.

At this time they put me on purinethol and haven't really felt any pain since.  I'm worried about what to do when I'm ready to have children_ but that is my only long term worry.

He was also on Prednisone at the same time. It worked well for him but after about 3 years on 6mp his liver tests started coming out abnormal.  He stopped the 6mp and Prednisone and started Remicade treatments which worked great.  However_ it is too late for his liver.  He is 38 years old with 2 small children and almost died recently due to a gallbladder infection.  He is now awaiting a liver transplant. Having ruled out all other possibilities for liver disease_ his doctor's now say it was the 6mp that was responsible.,M,38,3  years,5/11/2004,Purinethol

I have 2 little boys_ and am pregnant now with a little girl. This medication has been great for me and now my brother_ who has Crohn's Disease as well_ will be starting it soon_ too.  This drug has allowed me to be prednisone free and to be able to take care of my kids_ as well as have another child in a few months.  I was on this drug when I became pregnant with my first child over 4 years ago.  At that time_ they still didn't know what effect this drug would have on the unborn baby_ so I stopped.  I restarted Purinethol soon after my second child was born and was still breast feeding.  He is now a healthy 2 yearold.  In fact_ he fights things off just as easily (or easier) than his older brother.  I am currently on 75mg of Purinethol and pregnant.  All of my bloodwork comes back fine.

Do the vitamins_ people!! I also quit coffee (DUH!) about 6 weeks ago_ and my cramping and bleeding are almost gone!

177, 3, crohn's,Many side effects.  Massive energy loss.  There are periods of time where I can literally not move.  They are incredibly scarry.  During them_ I seem to drift in and out of consciousness.  Prior to purinethol_ on a good day I could bike for 30+ miles.  I would be happy with half that now.  Slow but steady hair loss.  No one in my family has a receding hair line.  I did not prior to purinethol.    Red dots all over my body.  Weight gain.  I expect that is due to an appetite loss which encourages me to eat more junk I like and less food that is good for me (common with chemo).  My doctor said two years ago it's my last chance so I guess still being here is better than other options_ but I'm not sure.  I am a vp in my company and the fatigue is killing me at work.  I am more absent minded and have lost most of my sharpness.  My liver functions have deteriorated.  Joint pain goes from moderate to unbearable.  I was always active in sports including football and basketball.  The last few years have taught me I knew nothing about pain.,The worst thing for me with this med was I was not told that this was chemo for cancer patients until I picked up the first prescription and saw the warnings.  I have faith in my doctor_ but it worries me that he minimizes the dangers.  About six months on the med_ I felt like a new person.  Then the bottom fell out.  My wife was diagnosed with cancer at the time so I assumed that I was having a rough time dealing with the extra physical effort of keeping the house going while she went through chemo_ surgery etc.  When things continued to get worse they realized that there had been a lowering of my liver performance.  The only good I can say is I am still here and the medicine seems to have stopped the really lowest points with the crohn's.  It's a huge trade-off.,M,43,26  months,4/2/2004Email,Purinethol

182, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Slight weakness_ thirsty and weight gain (Could possibly have some effects from the prednisone I'm tapering off currently),Well so far I've been taking this medicine since back in Nov of 2003.  I had been on a max of 60mg of prednisone at one point and I really had all kinds of energy and now that i'm tapering off it my doctor says that this Purinethol is what's going to keep my UC under control.  I can't even imagine having bout after bout and the fact that people will consider the UC symptoms and effects over the side effects from this medicine.  I'm currently taking 75mg (6mp:purinethol) and I'm 25 years old.  6 months ago I was in the worst pain of my life going to the bathroom at a minimum of 2 times per hour nightly and 1 time/hour daily.  I did get a cold and I've noticed some weight gain but I think I can attribute that to the prednisone.  I'm coming off the prednisone at 1mg/week and I'm on 14mg of that right now.  Please for your own benefit give 6mp a try and stay with it....I thought I was going to have a ileostomy and luckily things seem to be working for now.

186, 4, Crohn's Disease,Slight hair loss_ sleeplessness_ increased acne (?),It seems to be working very well for me. I can't drink with out severe nausea. I get VERY thirsty as well. I came onto this site looking for contraindications against drinking while using this drug as my Doctor had said it would be ok for me to take 6 MP and drink. That's so not true (for me anyway). I am now reconsidering this drug. It has helped me a lot. In the past year I have had no flare-ups worth mentioning. I have been on Asacol_ Pentasa_ Prednisone_ Entocort (which I do not recommend at all- lots of bruising and did not stabalise my crohn's) and now finally 6MP. I am now worried about my liver and about developping new problems as a result of this drug. I am goign to start getting blood work done again (probabley shouldn't have stopped).

188, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,Some hair loss (but at 50+ years old I was already down that road). Chronic fatigue and major joint pain_ but I'm not sure those are totally caused by the Pureinthol. The UC probably also contributes. Colds last longer than they did before.,I was diagnosed with UC in late 2001. After two previous attempts to get off Pred during 2002 it was Pureinthol that allowed me to do it on the third try during Jan. 2003. I've been taking 75 mgs a day since. I'm also taking 2400 mgs a day (originally 4800 mgs) of Asacol since my UC diagnosis. The Asacol helps_ but it is the Pureinthol that allowed me to get off Pred and lets me function on a daily basis. It's not perfect_ but I'm grateful that my side effects are not severe and it keeps my UC pretty well in check. My Dr. gives me OK to drink alcohol moderately; a glass of wine or a beer a day if I desire. The Dr. also monitors me with CBC blood tests every 3 months. The thought of possible side effects from long term usage give me pause_ but can they be worse than the absolute hell that UC had me in_ I don't know. Feeling pretty good I got overconfident and correspondingly sloppy with my Pureinthol intake during summer 2003 and my UC symptoms came roaring back with a vengeance.  Some Pred and getting back to consistent dosing with the Pureinthol got me taken care of.  Without good health insurance it is expensive.  I'm fortunate to pay only a fraction of the what without insurance would be about $180 for my monthly dosage.  Higher dosages than the 75 mgs a day I'm taking would obviously cost even more. Some good news on the cost issue is that Par Pharmaceuticals was just given FDA approval (Feb. 2004) to start selling a Pureinthol generic. Mercaptopurine is the actual drug name for the Pureinthol brand name (see www.parpharm.com and click Press Releases).,M,52,14  months,3/4/2004,Purinethol

202, 3, UC,I have not started to take Purinethol as of yet.,I was diagnosed with UC about 6mo ago.  I have been suffereing from IBS since early teens that I can remember.  I have been taking Asacol for 6mo now and cortenema's for 1mo. I realized no difference on Asacol_ however I thought Cortenema's helped mildly.  Mainly with the bleeding.  My doc wants me off the steriods b/c of the bone marrow issue.  He prescribed Purinethol which by book definition sounds very scary for me as I am 25 years old.  I am looking for some good advice as whether to start this or not.  I have been suffering from a really bad flare up for over a year now. I believe due to work related stress and general life style.  My family relatives are Pharmacists and from there perspective it offers to many risks to be on at such a young age.  Unfortunatley every day seems to be worse than the next. Any advice regarding Purinethol would be greatly appreciated.  Has anyone ever tried Welbutrin to help with UC/Chrone's?,M,25,0  days,1/16/2004Email,Purinethol

I have had three surgeries; two were to remove absesses and one was a resection. Pentasa worked for about 1 year but stopped working.  Purinethol has done wonders for me.

But I watched my body very closely.  I started to see a cycle being female.  2 weeks before my period my UC would flare up pretty bad.  I had lots of bad symptoms while on Ortho Erva Patch. There aren't much studies about Birth COntrol and UC.  I have switched to Yamin concetraceptive and am so much better.  I was down to 3 BM's per day and yesterday I didn't even have one.  I'm working with my obgyn and staying on active pills for 9 weeks straigt to see what is happening with my hormones that may be triggering my UC. I was first diagnosed in 1999 during my 7th month of pregnancy and have been battling this thing for quite some time.  Asacol_ Cortenemas_ Prednisone you name it_ nothing worked.  I'm on 50 mg of the Purinethol daily and will be talking to doc about weening off of it.  So_ keep in tune with you bodies.  Also_ to help with loose stools_ go to GNC and buy Millers Wheat.  Sprinkled it over Raisan Bran or make muffins and eat it daily. You will see a tremendous result! It does work. Try to cut back on sugars_ Soda_ cakes and pasta's since the carbs turn to sugar.

I do go for periodic blood tests to keep an eye on the White Blood count. On a whole_ I see this working as I am able to decrease prednisone to a level that I was never able to reach.

I had surgery and they removed the bad part of my intestine along with the valve inbetween the large and small intestine.  Before the surgery_ life was terrible and I couldn't eat anything that wouldn't bring on rediculously bad bloating and cramps.  Since the surgery_ I have been great and have been able to eat almost anything.  The only down side to this drug is that I always feel tired and colds last a couple weeks longer.

My doctor suggested I start taking purinethol. He told me a few of the side effects and I hesitated to take this medication and after reading the comments here there is no way I am taking this.

247, 5, Crohn's,Nothing noticable_ nothing that was unmanagable.  SOme chronic fatigue and sleeplessness_ but is it the drug or other factors in my life_ like ADHD and the Crohn's itself.  Either way_ long term potential side effects can be circumvented and watched for (and are being watched for very carefully) and are worth the risk as far as I am concerned compared to my life without this drug.,I was diagnosed with crohn's in 1991_ I was 21 years old.  I had no insurance and no way to afford medicines.  I survived at first due to an angel in doctor's clothing who gave me samples to spare me the drug costs of Asacol.  I was not perfectly healthy_ but I survived.  I moved serveral times after that_ had some good doctors and some real quacks.  and my disease got slowly worse.  I've tried almost everything_ asacol_ prednisone_ cortenemas_ nothing really worked.  in 97 I ended up in the hospital because I was throwing up_ unable to keep even water down and suffering from raging fevers that I'd break within an hour or two only to start all over again.  I went to the ER.  On call that night was a Gasteroeneurologist who saved my life that night.  He got me on antibiotics and a few other minor drugs and I was home in a week with a scheduled colonoscopy in a month.  the night before I was due for the procedure I was unable to finish the colon flush they give you because of the vomiting again.  I was in the hospital as an inpatient for my procedure the next morning.  He also had me sign for an upper GI at the last minute on a hunch and discovered a bad case of acid reflux and got me on the Prilosec and I've been very happy.  After the procedure he handed me the drug bible and told me to look up Purinethol.  He had me weigh the long term potential side effects versus the potential results and gave me the choice to begin the 6MP treatment.  It was October and he told me I should be in remission by New Years.  He lied.  I was in complete remission by thanksgiving. My relationship with this drug has been a little on again off again due to pregnancies but has in general been better and more open than my first marriage_ and with better results.  the marriage nearly killed me and the drug saved my life.  I just got off an 8 month dalliance with Remacade.  It was nice at first_ the day after I was weak_ suffered inexplicable backaches the week after_ but then I was fine for about 5-6 weeks.  I'd start bleeding 2 weeks before the next treatment.  Last week I suffered a bout of Lupus like symptoms which I had not been warned about_ primarily the wandering arthralgias that had me doubled over in the ER again afraid to move.  I felt like a dead spider_ with dry brittle bones and painful joints that even Darvocet couldn't ease.  I am off the Remacade (though it is a wonderful drug_ and many I have talked with while getting the infusions have been very happy with it (mostly arthritis patients) but it just isn't for me)  I am temporarily back on the prednesone to knock out the pain (which occured in 6 hours thankfully) and am back on the 6MP.  And now that they've declared it safe for pregnancies I'll never go off it again.,F,33,4  years,5/14/2003Email,Purinethol

250, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Tendency to get colds often. Taking Vitamin C helps.,Feel great. The only drug that was affective with my disease. Have energy_ lost the weight from Prednisone_ and I now live my life without ever thinking about the UC. Can get sick easily though - I had a cold that lingered on throughout winter (nothing serious though) - this may be a result of being around people constantly at college. Having to take Tylenol Cold every once in a while is a side effect that is definately minor in comparison to those of other UC drugs.,M,19,2.5  years,4/30/2003,Purinethol
251, 4, U.C.,Nausia especially after eating and in the morning. Lowered Immune system.,Although I fell terrible right now_ I know this med works. THANK GOD for this medicine because it is the ONLY thing that works for me asside from steroids (which I refuse to take again because I gained SO MUCH WEIGHT!) I took this drug about a year ago and it got my UC under control. I had taken asacol_ pentasa_ and others all with NO effect. I was able to stop taking the drug_ and my UC was under control without drugs_ but the slightest bit of stress and darned if it didnt flare right back up again. so I started taking it again about 1 week ago_ and although it takes a few weeks to start working_ I am excited to get it under control again. I dont think I will stop taking it again because I do hate the immediate side effects when I begin taking the drug. The Nausia is almost unbearable and makes me not want to eat_ but if I dont eat I get nausiated too. It does go away eventually but it takes a week or two. SO- overall it works if you want to wait. If anyone else has experienced nausia_ fell free to let me know. I really would like to talk about others experiences. Thanks!!,M,23,1  years,4/29/2003Email,Purinethol

256, 4, CROHN'S,SLIGHT HAIR LOSS_ I'M NOT BALDING OR ANYTHING THOUGH. I HAVE JOINT PAIN_ BUT I THINK THAT'S JUST CROHN'S IN GENERAL_ NOT THE MEDS.. IT COULD BE THOUGH.,I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CROHN'S WHEN I WAS 6 WEEKS PREGNANT WITH MY DAUGHTER IN FEBRUARY OF 2002. I HAD TO HAVE SURGERY RIGHT AWAY. I HAD A RIGHT HEMI-COLECTOMY DONE_ AND HEALED RATHER QUICKLY. DURING MY PREGNANCY_ I COULDN'T TAKE ANY MEDS. SO AFTER I HAD MY DAUGHTER_ I STARTED THE 6MP AND PREDNISONE. I THINK THE THING THAT HELPED DURING PREGNANCY WAS TAKING VITAMINS. ANYWAY_ ABOUT A MONTH AFTER STARTING THESE_ I RELAPSED BAD. I WIND UP IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 4 DAYS_ GOT TESTS DONE_ AND THEY STUCK ME ON REMICADE. MY DOC SAID I'D BE ON 6MP FOR ABOUT 4 YEARS ALONG WITH THE REMICADE. I'M SCARED TO COME OFF OF THEM_ BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT TIME COMES. REMICADE IS AWESOME. I LOOK FOWARD TO GOING EVERY 8 WEEKS. I'M OFF THE STEROID_ *THANK GOD*. I GAINED LIKE 15 POUNDS FROM THE PREDNISONE_ BUT DROPPED THE WEIGHT AFTER I WAS OFF IT FOR LIKE A MONTH. WELL_ I GUESS OVERALL_ I AM SATISFIED WITH THE 6MP. IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING! OH_ AND JUST TO LET THOSE OF YOU QUESTIONING DRINKING WHILE BEING ON THIS DRUG HERE'S WHAT MY DOC SAID: As far as drinking while on 6mp_ it is highly suggested that everyone ask their doctor first_ cause everyones case can be different. Some people may have more severe Crohn's and some may even be on other meds that may not mix well with alcohol_ etc... But I will tell you what my doctor has told me since so many have e-mailed and ask_ it is easier to just post and save you the trouble. He told me that drinking occasionally is Ok_ as long as I don't overdue it. He said the main problem with mixing alcohol and 6mp is it will lower the affect of the 6mp_ therefore it will not work as well. Also_ liver damage is a proven side effect of 6mp_ and liver damage is also caused from drinking alcohol_ so it's only adding fuel to the fire to mix the both of them. But he did say once in awhile would be Ok. I usually drink on the weekends here and there_ and have had no side effects so far except for occasional diarrhea the next day_ but that could just be from the alcohol itself_ i'm not sure. I hope this has helped.,F,26,6  months,4/3/2003Email,Purinethol

My doctor_ parents_ and fience think it is best to stay on but I have a hutch that things might be better if I just stopped.  Maybe I am just too dramatic but I was never this miserably before.

First signs of symptoms reoccuring after 8 weeks_ bumped Purenithol up to 100 mg/day and symptoms subsided after a few weeks.  Pretty much in remission now but still have a bad day every few weeks.Just wish the precautions for this medication were a little more clear.

These treatments all worked for about a month then my symptoms would come back.  I missed a lot of school and a lot of my youth as I look back now.  I try to keep informed and have found two really helpful websites:  www.myucguide.com and www.gihealth.com  Good luck to those who are in pain_ I feel for you_ and just know that things WILL get better with treatment and the best thing you can do is communicate with your doctor and especially with the people around you.,M,20,4  years,1/8/2003Email,Purinethol

I was having terrible trouble out of it over the summer and was hospitalized and told that if I didnt take 6mp that I would continue to have those hosp. visits and they would get more frequent.  I was reluctant to try it for the following reasons:  I want to have kids_ liver damage_ and the horror stories that I have heard about it.  After extensive discussion with my husband and family I decided to give it a try but only after my Doc promised me that I could come off the med and still have children.  I have been on it since this July-5 months now_along with Remicaide treatments every 8 weeks.  It is doing well with the exception of the side effects that I mentioned above.  I am now a little concerned that It may make me infertile_ My Doc says that if I take it for a year and get myself under control that I can stop it and have kids and then resume it if necessary.  It has really helped my Uc_ I havent felt this good in years as far as the Uc goes_ the tiredness and shots and hair loss sucks but my Uc is great.  I can acutally go shopping w/o pinpointing the bathroom immediately upon entrance and using it 6 times or more while I am that one store.  Any suggestions on the infertility?
