5, 3, Pregnancy prevention,Inplanted November 1998 taken out May 2001 due to side effects. Mood changes_ ovarian cysts_ irregular periods_ hair loss_ left arm scar tissue_ left arm shoulder problems_ persistent hair loss.,I was told due to my young age that Norplant would be the best choice for me. I had to take it out early due to side effects. The major issue with taking them out was the time it took to take them out and the scarring after to my muscle and arm.  After I've had it out I have had excessive hair loss even after no birth control in my system after many years (10+). After extensive tests there is no answer to my hair loss and my entire family line has had no hair loss on both sides and no balding for the men. There is no answer to my symptoms except Norplant.  My left arm has had painful issues since with the area around the implantation.,F,33,3  years5 rods in,12/20/2015Email,Norplant system
6, 4, Most effective birth control,Irregular periods (I had these anyway even before Norplant)_ hair loss,Had Norplant inserted at age 16 and removed after the 5 yr period ended. I didn't get pregnant so I'd have to say im satisfied. I'm thin and the norplants were always very visible in my arm. Over the 5 yrs_ one rod separated from the others and eventually disappeared from view. When the doctor went to remove them it took about 3 mins to get the first five and two hours looking for the sixth. She never did find the missing one. I was assured at the time it wouldn't matter and there would be no ill effects from leaving one inside my body. I think to myself now... How would she know what the long term effects would be??? They were put in in 1997 and taken out in 2002... Hadn't been too long on the market at that point. I've had hormonal abnormalities_ ovarian cysts_ migraines_ and pervasive mental illness in the 13 yrs since they were removed. I also became pregnant (for the first time) about 6 months after the removal and miscarried. I've since had two healthy babies_ one in '04 and one in '10 but the little one was diagnosed with autism at 18 months. I can't say for sure how much if any of these events are directly related to the norplants. I won't even try to guess. But I do wonder from time to time whatever became of that little silicone rod thats still in me somewhere.........,F,34,5  years,11/10/2015,Norplant system
7, 1, As birth control,Migraines_ heavy period for 3+ weeks each cycle_ severe cramping_ extreme mood swings_ 50 lb weight gain_ nausea_ vomiting_ joint aches_ depression_ no libido_ vaginal dryness_ digestive distress_ growths on uterus that had to be removed 2 different times.,Had it implanted at 20 yrs old. I was newly married and wasn't ready for kids. I thought it would be more convenient than BC. After 8 months had it removed due to pain and misery. I gained 50 lbs in 6 months. Developed a benign growth on uterus that had to be removed. After removed_ I couldn't loose weight_ I have since been diagnosed as Celiac and have numerous other food allergies.  I have tried to get pregnant for many years and have been unsuccessful. I truly believe that I am infertile and am now 41.

20, 1, To Prevent Pregnancy,I had the Norplant implanted after the birth of my second child in 1993. I suffered severe bruising at the site after insertion_ which lasted about 2 weeks. I also became pregnant a little over a year after having the Norplant rods inserted.,12 months after having implants inserted_ I had a seizure and was placed on Dilantin. I went to see my OB/GYN to have my tubes tied_ because I was told that Dilantin may decrease the effectiveness of the Norplant_ and my husband and I did not want to have more children. The Dr. told me not to tie my tubes_ to continue using the Norplant and not worry because I would NOT get pregnant. That was almost 18 years ago. My daughter suffers with bi-polar disorder_ severe depression and aggression issues. I feel those are the side-effects of her fetal exposure to the hormones in Norplant_ because I was not able to remove the implants as soon as I found out I was pregnant.

Finally one day I got the nerve to do it_ it didn't hurt to remove although I do have a small pain in the spot from time to time. Like a muscle cramp.  My depression lifted about 70% within 24 hours of removal like a heavy weight lifting off my chest.  I still suffer from slight depression; I'm not the go lucky person I was before the Norplant.

Fibromyalgia_ Bursitis in hips_ 2 Very Severe Migraines_ 3 Miscarriages_ Weight Gain_ Depression and Mood Swings_ sometimes violent.,I had no bleeding or other noticeable problems while using Norplant.  But today_ I suffer aches and pains all over my body and no doctor can tell me why in a satisfactory manner.  I feel years older than I am_ and wonder how soon I will be completely disabled.  My back aches_ my hips are unbearable_ and my leg/back/hip muscles always feel like I just ran a marathon.  My two migraines knocked my out for days. Fortunately I was able to control that with Feverfew.  My feet hurt_ I don't get much sleep because I never get comfortable.  I  hurt inside when I see other people my age_ even obese ones_ do exercise and smile.  I don't do much and suffer for it for days.  I believe it was because of the Norplant_ and Provera pills while trying to get pregnant with my second daughter.

47, 1, Birth Control,Increasing headaches over the course of the year I had it in.  Then_ July 2_ 1994 woke up groggy with arm pain and nausea which persisted.  By the time I was able to get it removed_ it had dissolved surrounding area.  I was disabled for a year_ during which time I had episodes of vision loss_ hallucinations_ and other neurological problems.  10 years and a baby later_ still have ulnar nerve damage.  My headaches_ fatigue_ arm and neck pain have become unmanageable.  Norplant destroyed my central nervous system; I am so sensitive to stress since this happened.  My arms and legs can be sporadic and hard to control.  SPECT scan shows 'star' shaped damage on the top of my head_ as well as temporal lobe damage.  I feel tingling_ pain and/or numbness through my head daily.,Note that Norplant is made out of silicone- intended to leak.  It's no wonder they had to pull it from the market because women were getting sick.  I did not get menses for a year following my Norplant going bad_ presumably from the flood of Progesterone.  Friends_ silicone poisoning is still a taboo subject.  Don't expect to get help from doctors.  I have had nerve conduction reports_ a lumbar puncture and other data simply 'disappear' at the hands of doctors.  I now have a brain lesion at 34 years old_ but nothing will be considered evidence of a problem to a system that does not want to accept responsibility.
