0, 2, Wisdom teeth removal recovery,EXTREMELY emotional,Everything someone said or did to me I took personally and I'd go off and cry. Or_ I'd snap at my family and then go off and cry because of the guilt. It made my emotions turn into a roller coaster of basically anger and crying. I was a wreck.,F,16,10  days500,8/13/2016,Amoxicillin

4, 1, Tonsillitis,Stomach cramps and diarrhea after only 2 doses.,I had taken this medication 4 years earlier for a salivary gland infection and had the exact same reaction and stopped taking it. I thought maybe it would be OK this time around but same result. Never had a problem with any other antibiotic. Have stopped taking it and won't be taking it again.,M,42,5  days500,7/9/2016,Amoxicillin
5, 3, Throat infection,This medication didn't really do anything the first 2 days. It started to help my throat on Day 3 but that's when the side effects hit me really hard out of nowhere. I started to get heart palpitations_ and since it's Saturday I decided I would keep taking it until Monday and then maybe get something else. Well it's Sunday morning and I feel extremely weak. I am getting muscle weakness and exhaustion. Lifting my arms and legs makes my heart beat really fast. I'm still getting heart palpitations. I don't think I'm going to take my 3:30am dose. I just want this to wear off. It's too bad because my infection is finally going away (after weeks of suffering with it) and now I feel like this.,It also increased my anxiety a lot. I keep getting panic attacks_ and get panic attacks in my sleep and heart palpitations even when I am not having an attack. The heart palpitations are all day long and it doesn't matter if I'm laying down or relaxing. I had to take these anally...because my infection is related to an ulcer. I have never felt so weak in my life. I don't want to know what will happen if I take it for another day. I don't reccommend this med if you have anxiety or if you start feeling muscle weakness. It's very scary. Little things are leaving me exhausted and out of breath. Time to call it quits and hope for the best.,F,30,7  days500 3X D,7/3/2016Email,Amoxicillin

I drink water by the bottle full!  I have 7 more days to take this.  If this does not work_ then I go back and will start on a 21 day regime.,I don't really care what the side effects are_ as long as it isn't a bad reaction.

15, 1, Strep Throat,Heart racing_ anxiety_ feelings of impending doom_ hard time sleeping,A few hours after my 3rd dose of Amoxicillin (approx. 28 hrs after first dose) my heart started racing suddenly.   Then I had a feeling of impending doom come over me and became totally anxious.  I had nothing to feel doom or anxiety about.  It took a long time for me to finally fall asleep and then I did not sleep well.  The next morning I took my next dose and my heart continued to race_ I still felt anxious and impending doom.  I called my pharmacy who said anxiety can be a side effect.  I've been on Amoxi before with no problem; but I don't believe this high of a dose.  They told me to call my doctor and to not take my next dose.  My doctor prescribed me another antibiotic and I can say that my heart racing is starting to slow down now.  It's been about 16 hours since I took my last Amoxi pill.  I have no idea why suddenly it had this effect on me; but I will never take it again.

39, 1, Wisdom tooth extraction,Writing this for my brother to share a story that will make you piss your pants it did me. He was taking it for wisdom tooth extraction. And 5 days in.. he went to a mental ward cause it induced Schizophrenia! He has been released out 2 week's later and still thinks people are out there to kill him with medication! And mild hallucinations! But there getting better! It's been 2 months now and he's almost back to normal!,Just do your research before you take any meds! Cause if you already have anxiety or depression it can make them worse. Depression can Leeds to suicidal thoughts anxiety can turn into panic disorder. But not forever! Just induces more problems! I take colloidal silver for my infections/bacterium/fugi problems! I just use 20PM colloidal silver 3 table spoons a day for 5 to 10 days depending on the problem! Good luck and stop using fake healers and switch to colloidals! Yes if you use it for 5 months it can make your skin ashy grey.. it's only for short term use! Month at the top! I have lyme disease and I get music in my head that doesn't go away! Colloidal silver for 4 weeks 3 table spoons a day all my symtoms subside for 3 years!,M,26,10  days500,9/18/2015Email,Amoxicillin

41, 2, For a tooth infection,The drug worked by reducing tooth pain in the first day_ but by the second day I noticed itching and soreness on the skin of my inner thighs_ groin and buttocks accompanied by a red rash. By the third day my thighs felt very raw and tender and had begun to swell_ while the rash was spreading downwards. There was itchy skin and spots all around my lower abdomen and buttocks. I phoned the dentist to let him know and he said I must be allergic to penicillins so he took me off the drug_ prescribing erythromycin instead.  The rash slowly disappeared over the next few days. I'm not criticising the drug which worked as an antibiotic_ but it is obviously no use to me if I am allergic to it. I did not know I was allergic...it's about 15 years since I last had an antibiotic and I've never noticed these symptoms before.,,M,64,3  days250mg 3X D,9/11/2015,Amoxicillin
