1, 1, sinus tachycardia,EXTREMELY FAT STOMACH!  ALWAYS HAD GREAT ABS BEFORE!,Before I developed hashimotos disease_ I was in really good shape.  Started taking beta blocker to control heart rate.  Yes!  It did control my heart rate but made my gut stick out ! I felt like I had to stay on the drug or I felt like I would die!  Am now weaned_ which can be murderous_ but am on bp pill instead.  It's worth the switch if done properly under doctor's care!  Don't be dumb about weaning.  It takes a little time.  I lost 5.2 lbs in 3 weeks since being off the meds.  That's huge for me.  I found my stomach again.  In three weeks_ my stomach is flatter than it has been in years!  YEAH!  Way more energy to accomplish things and exercise faithfully!,F,45,2  years50 2X D,8/31/2011Email,Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide
