0, 5, Back Pain,Makes me thirsty_ delayed ejaculation.,This drug is a little bit stronger than an equivalent dose of Hydrocodone. Percodan is a mix of Oxycodone and Asprin_ in my opinion aspirin is safer to your liver over long term usage if your stomach can handle Asprin. Percodan is a wonderful drug and have had absolutely no side effects except being thirsty and some insomnia. Tolerance does build and you can easily find yourself popping more and more to achieve the same effect and is addicting.,M,43,6  months5/325 4X D,12/29/2010,Percodan-demi
