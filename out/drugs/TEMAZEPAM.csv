1, 1, anxiety at night_ couldn't sleep,severe anxiety_ depression_ gagging_ shaking_ vomiting_ tinnitus_ hot flashes_ constant anxiety_ couldn't eat_ many bowel movements_ insomnia_ once i stopped taking it.,Doctor wouldn't admit it was withdrawal!!!! Of course it was_ seriously!  why won't doctors admit the drugs hey prescribe cause serious side effects_ their misinformation is dangerous and immoral!This drug is a benzo and benzos are extremely dangerous_ Do Not Take This DrugÂ…it should have red danger signs all over it!,F,48,37  days7.5 1X D,12/10/2014,Temazepam
2, 3, Sleep,It is ok I took it twice in the hospital and three times at home but I found that the next day I feel a bit shaky and unsteady and have a headache...feel a bit weird on them...plus I've noticed no matter what time I take temazepam I always wake up about 2-3am and then have to force myself back to sleep by myself_ first two times it was easy fell asleep within 5-10mins other 3times took 30mins plus...and I actually don't remember if I've slept or not...I'm going to stop taking it today and see how I go...for very short use if recommended it especially if you're body has been under a lot of stress and you can't stop thinking but long term I wouldn't use it.,,F,25,5  days10,9/28/2014Email,Temazepam
3, 3, Insomnia,Morning muscle pain and stiffness_ like I've done a heavy work out.,Some nights I sleep great using the drug. Other nights it has no effect_ and I am awake up to two days without sleep. Also tend to dream alot_ but mostly good and interesting dreams. That did not happen while on Ambien_ which I stopped after 5 years due to starting to have memory issues.,M,58,4  weeks30mg 1X D,8/27/2014,Temazepam
4, 4, Insomnia,It took me about a week for it to actually work.After about a week_ 20mg would allow me a reasonable sleep.Prior to that_ I had tried oxazepam_ which was not allowing me to sleep through the night and would wear off at about 2am. ,After a month of this drug_ my doctor would not renew the script. The body can build up a tolerance to this drug and then it stops working effectively. It is supposed to be used for very short term only. Anyway_ it was a good month of sleep for me.,F,39,30  days20mg 1X D,4/8/2014,Temazepam

6, 1, sleep,Had a paradoxical reaction and hit tolerance w/d within a month. Suffered HORRIBLE sxs that I NEVER had before. Severe anxiety_ depression_ derealization_ head pain_ dizziness_ blurred vision_ cog impairment etc etc. My ignorant doctor ripped me off in a cold turkey and that was 5.5 year  s ago. I have been in a protracted state ever since.. I have healed approximately 30-40% and still suffering each day. This pill has DESTROYED my life the last 6 years. I have connected with hundreds of other people around the world who have experienced the exact thing as me. Never ever take any BENZODIAZAOINES. Most doctors are totally ignorant of their possible wd sxs and that they can last years for some. Google benzos wd and you will find documentation galore to substantiate this. There are numerous internet support groups which have literally saved my life. Dr. Heather Ashton is the guru of info of this. Please_ do not ever take benzos as it has the potential to send you into a hell you have neve,,M,45,10  months30mg 1X D,4/8/2013Email,Temazepam
7, 3, insomnia,amnesia(would get up in middle of night and not remember what I did),,F,46,3  months30 1X D,9/12/2012,Temazepam
8, 1, Insomnia,Cooking and eating in my sleep.Memory Loss.,I was prescribed by my psychiatrist Temazepam to stop the insomnia. It worked for months_ now all of a sudden for the past few weeks or so I began finding bowls and plates in my bed. My family told me last night I cooked and ate_ and I cannot remember. My cousin told me today after telling her about this that she have noticed here in the past few weeks that I would forget what she told me an hour later.,F,41,7  months60 1X D,1/3/2012Email,Temazepam
9, 4, chronic insomnia,None,I was prescribed Normisom (one of Temazepam's brand names in Australia) initially for insomnia related to anxiety/depression in 2006.  Although I have not suffered any depressive problems for the past 4 years_ I developed chronic insomnia in June 2009_ and have relied upon Normisom since then (my insomnia is so bad that I don't even fall asleep without drugs_ and can be awake for over 24 hours straight).  I think this is an excellent sleep medication.  I have found it very effective and completely free from any side effects_ and it does not interfere with any other medications (over the counter pain killers_ vitamins/herbal remedies_ Nexium) I have taken during this period.  My only comment is that it isn't as effective as it was initially after taking it constantly for going on 3 years (I did try Imovane as an alternative_ but it lost its effectiveness after 3 months_ and left a foul taste in my mouth in the mornings).  I don't know how I would manage without Temazapam in its various guises.  A very good_ effective product.,M,58,3  years10mg 1X D,3/4/2011,Temazepam
10, 4, Sleeplessness,None_ perhaps sleeping an hour longer?,I am taking temazepam to counter sleeplessness associated with depression_ on an irregular basis (anywhere between 3x in a week to once a month). It's nice in that there are no side effects for me and it helps to manage my occasional sleep problems. The only complaint I have is that it's been ineffective on some nights where I've felt particularly bad_ but I am sure that a higher dosage would have helped with it.,F,25,6  months10mg 1X AN,9/22/2010,Temazepam
11, 5, waking at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.,Some grogginess until my cup of coffee_ but it's a relaxed grogginess_ so not bad.,It gets me back to sleep when I wake in early morning (1-3:00a.m.). I have had to take breaks_ usually a day or two_ occasionally to keep it effective.  I recently learned that it works by increasing the efficiency of the brain's GABA receptors_ so when the effectiveness started to diminish I began taking GABA (750 mg)along with it and it began working perfectly again.  I have not had to increase the doseage beyond the 7.5 mg I started with.  It gets me closer to natural unmedicated sleep than anything else I have tried.  I love it!,F,59,2  years7.5mg 1X D,9/3/2010Email,Temazepam
12, 1, insomnia,depression got worst,helped for sleep but made depression really bad,M,47,10  days,9/9/2009,Temazepam
13, 3, Sleep Aid,Although it helped me fall asleep_ I felt horribly groggy the next day_ and found that it was very difficult for me to function physically.,I don't recommend this drug. After discussing my discontent with the pharmacist_ he recommended I take Ambien_ or it's generic form Zolpidem.,M,57,7  days,7/29/2007,Temazepam
14, 1, sleep problem,vicious headach the next day both times i took it,on the bright side_ it did put me to sleep for several hours,M,46,2  days,12/12/2005,Temazepam
15, 4, Trouble staying asleep,Makes you dizzy just before you fall asleep.,I have trouble staying asleep_ I wake up after about 4 hours.  With this drug_ I get about 7 straight hours of sleep.  I read it is addictive_ so I only take it when I absolutely have to_ not every night - maybe once every two weeks.,F,41,3  months,8/8/2005,Temazepam
16, 4, sleepless nights,I did feel a bit dizzy. best to go to bed within 20 minutes after taking,I have been under a lot of stress this past year and found this to really help me get about 6 hours sleep. I try not to take them every night_ so I probably take them 3times a week.,F,53,2  months,1/28/2005,Temazepam
