0, 5, papulopustular rosacea,Minor constipation when I started.   Eating yogurt or taking probiotics while on this or any antibiotic is probably a good idea.,I started having itchy welts and what I thought were zits on my forehead and cheeks about a year before going to the Derm.  He dignosed it as papulopustular rosacea.  I also had some eye problems_ mostly around my lower eye lids.  I started taking the Oracea and within a week my face was significantly better.  The itching has almost completely stopped and I rarely have any welts.  I had forgotten what it was like to not have mosquito bite-like welts all over my face.  I've been on it for about 90 days.  I worry what will happen when I stop taking it.  Other than that_ this stuff has been a god send.,,43,90  days40 1X D,4/22/2012,Oracea
1, 5, Rosacea,I've developed heartburn in the past 3 years_ which I believe is probably related to this medication. However_ the benefits are so phenomenal_ I've just added Prevacid and I'm fine.,This medication has been a godsend to me. I used to experience excruciating burning in my face as well as redness_ but the burning was there whether or not my face was red. It was so painful that I would just want to cry.  I've used the medication for 3-4 years and I have never had even one episode of burning. The acne is virtually nil (occasional flareup) and the redness is nearly gone. I believe I have permanent redness that will never go away_ but overall_ I'm extremely happy with how my skin looks and feels. Sad that the heartburn developed since I really don't want to have to take a Prevacid-type medication_ but the payoff is worth it. I've never had any problem with joint paint or nausea after taking it. In fact_ when I asked my dermatologist if the heartburn could be related_ he said I didn't need to wait an hour to eat after taking the medication.  BTW_ my heartburn usually starts several hours after I've taken my dose_ so it doesn't start right away. Also_ I used to have a lengthy history of yeast infections so I have sworn off antibiotics as much as possible. I have had no yeast infections while on this medication. I love love love it!,F,49,3  years40mg 1X D,3/21/2012Email,Oracea
2, 2, MGD/blepheritis & Rosacea,worked wonders on face and eyes_ like magic. Yeast infection for 8 months however (lingering long after I quit Oracea) was too high a price to pay ... so_ no Oracea for me. Too bad as it delivered on its stated promise. Oh_ and they mean it when state to take and remain UPRIGHT for an hour before eating. Or GERD will develop ...,,F,52,4  months40 mg,12/27/2011,Oracea

4, 3, rosacea,Joint and back pain.  I also had joint and back pain when I used tetracycline in the past.Has caused yeast infections for me in past.  To prevent that_ I take garlic tablets every day.  Oracea does a fairly good job on my rosacea_ but I don't like the side effects.  I feel like I have the flu_ hurt all over.,,F,54,4  days 1X D,6/8/2010Email,Oracea
5, 5, Rosacea,Only recently have I wondered if the heartburn I've had for the last year or so is related to this. Anyone else with this problem?,I'm thrilled with how my face looks. No more red bumps_ no more scaling and flaking. I'm able to cover up my redness (broken blood vessels) with makeup.,F,47,2  years40 mg 1X D,5/4/2010,Oracea
