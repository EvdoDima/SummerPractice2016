0, 3, Suspected infection parasites,Initially I felt better for the first time in months (3.5 days) and I had minimal side effects however this morning 5th day woke up sweating and in discomfort I will give this drug 3 initially and re rate it when I know if it cures me. I had side effects three months ago when I took it for 5 days for suspected Trichomonas the drug is harsh hopefully this will all be worth it.There don't seem to be many posts that give updates in the following weeks_ I will follow this up.,This drug seems to work and if it cures me I will consider it a brilliant thing.I will post an update next week.,M,55,4.5  days400mg 3X D,8/16/2016Email,Flagyl
1, 1, Oral surgery,Horrible nausea and awful taste in my mouth. Ripped up my stomach with bloody_pus filled loose stool .... if any at all. Feel outside of my body. Exhausted even after 8 hours of sleep. Feelings that I would rather be dead then feel so bad. Enough gas and belching  to last a lifetime. thinking and feeling like I was going to die. Very weak and shaky. Severe dizziness at times.,How can this drug be allowed on the market. I am really upset. I've had to go to work like this. After going to Urgent Care $75.00_ being sent to the ER (Only God knows)_ I got to the ER and it was so busy_ I just knew I would be there ALL NIGHT yet I could not imagine having to ever sit there to wait as I needed to lay down. I had to sign Against Medical Advice papers. Was never seen by a Doctor or evaluated but can only imagine what they will charge me for the Triage. Ever I could take your vitals!!!!! After leaving the ER _ I decided I don't care if I'm supposed to take this another 7 days..... I will NEVER take another poison pill again. It's 48 hours later and I started feeling better yesterday but about 4 hours ago_ a wave of this same  sickness came back and I'm feeling just like before....really bad again. Don't trust the doctor anymore. Any advice???? PLEASE HELP???,F,57,8  days500mg 4X D,8/14/2016Email,Flagyl

7, 1, c diff,Extreme tiredness_ loss of appetite_ food tasted awful_ swollen knee with severe pain. Rash that was redish and purplish above elbow. Rash itched and head itched like I had fleas. Luckily my daughter realized these were side effects and pointed this out to the doctor who finally stopped the poisonous drug.,Horrible drug. Unfortunately doctors don't know the side effects and are too willing to add another drug to counter the side effects of a drug instead of thinking outside the box. Doctors are nothing more than drug pushers anymore.  Very sad.,M,90,5  days 1X D,6/21/2016,Flagyl

Peripheral neuropathy which started from ciproflaxin a few years ago perked up_ horrible taste in mouth FIVE DAYS AFTER I stopped taking it.  Horrible stomach issues if you know what I mean.

19, 3, Diverticulitis,Horrible taste_ metallic taste_ flu like symptoms_ dizzy_ headache_ increased heart rate_ fatigue.  Can feel my pulse and heartbeat in my head and ears  from the strength of the heartbeat  and faster pace_ and much worse during exertion like exercise or just going upstairs.  Very weird. These were bad while taking the medicine and persisted for weeks after finishing the medicine.,I have used Flagyl a number of times. During the first several times I remember taking it without side effects apart from the metallic taste. But after stopping the side effects were gone pretty quickly. However I have found with each subsequent prescription my reaction has been worse and the side effects have been worse and they have persisted much longer after stopping the medicine. So I am guessing this is kind of like an acquired allergy or intolerance over time. This past time was a 10-day dose and it was the absolute worst. I hope there is some other medicine that can take the place of Flagyl because I can't do this again.  It knocked out my infection but has just about knocked me out too.,M,54,10  days 4X D,5/22/2016,Flagyl

Waves of despair and paranoia. Horrible metallic taste in mouth. Insomnia. Haven't slept much in 4 days. Tingling hands.,Just Google Flagyl and Cipro lawsuits. There are firms dedicated to nothing but filing suit for people whose lives have been destroyed because of these drugs. I only took 7 pills of this poison and 7 pills of Cipro before stopping. I believe both drugs in concert have caused the severe side affects to double. No way of knowing which one is worse. I've read that both are equally as horrible on their own. Side affects are still present after 3 days of being off. It is bar none the worst most insidious chemical I have ever put into my body. The people who developed it_ sell it and approved it belong in prison. How the FDA allowed this nightmare drug on the market is beyond belief. I thought they were supposed to protect us.,M,59,4  times500 4X D,5/22/2016EmailHistory,Flagyl

I stopped using most of these the last 2 days of treatment and only had some dizziness and mild nasal congestion after that - a breeze relative to what I'd been through. I accidentally used a hand lotion and hair conditioner that had ingredients with the words alcohol but didn't get sick from them. I think it was the wart medication and/or the sprayed facial toner.

I have a severe aversion to nausea and vomiting though_ so I will probably call my doctor to switch meds just because of this side effect.

I've been on a medication that makes my urine not burn my lesions as well_ which also turns my urine a bright orange color.

It is also important to take the pills with food. I didn't think I would be able to survive the 7 days but after day 5 I decided to stick it through.

What you are suffering from has a name--METRONIDAZOLE-INDUCED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM TOXICITY. Basically_ lesions are forming on your brain (specifically your cerebellum)_ and that's why you're having difficulty walking/speaking_ etc. These lesions are reversible in about 85% of cases and almost everyone at least improves over the course of 3 months (people with only mood change problems especially have a better chance). However_ taking more of the drug will cause the lesions to continue growing. The only thing that can detect them is an MRI. If you don't believe me_ put ""Metronidazole-induced Central Nervous System Toxicity"" into Google_ and you can find the case studies. I'm not a doctor; I'm just a victim of this effing drug and did my homework. It's 4 months out for me and I'm still having problems (although no longer debilitated by them).

After my first run with it for 5 days I had abdominal and lower back pains. I didn't start to feel normal for 3 weeks and then I was put on it again for a 7 day course. My main complaint and only symptom for the bv the second go around was burning which never fully went away. Have the stomach issues again which seem to be slowly getting better but I will never again take this drug. The first round took away the itch and discharge but the second round did nothing for the burning.. Medication usually doesn't have any side effects on me but I can say this stuff really screwed me up.. I would recommend if at all possible to stay away from the pills and go with the cream or gel.. I just hope my abdominal issues sort themselves out because it's been hell.,F,47,7  days400,8/18/2015,Flagyl

It really messed up my digestive tract. It has been 6 weeks since I finished_ and I am just getting back to eating raw vegetables. My strength has come back slowly. A good probiotic has been very helpful. I normally get a lot of exercise_ so I feel that the negative side effects were due to the flagyl.

Had a headache for a couple days_ horrible taste in my mouth_ stomach pains_ I was sick to my stomach and my speak was slurred one day. I called my mom to ask her if that was normal she did some research and told me to go see another doctor and to get off this antibiotic. My other doctor said it was a good thing I came in when I did. We switched to a cream. I thought great ok this will be over_ the next day was the beginning of hell. That's when the mirgraines started_ my hands went numb_ along with my feet. I thought it was because I had laid in bed all day_ then my speak got slurred again. The next day felt a little better_ then that's when the fever and cold sweats started_ the moraine came back. My feet and legs became numb and real heavy and sore. The next day I found some relief for a couple hours then it was just a headache and my legs felt slightly better. No more slurred speak and my hands and arms felt better. Sometimes I would have a huge appetite and others nothing sounded good and I was so sick. The fever usually came at night or early in the morning. Then the next day the migraine came back along with the legs and feet pain only worse.

My doctor only said don't drink alcohol with this med due to the fact it would make me very sick. He didn't say anything about feeling so sick otherwise. This medication is important to take because it kills anaerobic bacteria versus aerobic bacteria. Other meds like Cipro_ amoxicillin and clindamycin do not kill anaerobic bacteria. My advice is to try to finish the course unless you have rash or other signs of anaphylaxis. Luckily I am a nurse so I know what to look for regarding side effects.

As far as side effects go: extreme nausea_ extreme fatigue_ cotton mouth_ super taste and smell_ I could actually smell the inside of my nostrils_ dizzy_ loss of appetite_ weight loss_ extreme stomach bloating_ extreme back pain_ muscle weakness_ heart palpitations_ rapid heartbeat_ chest aches_ headaches_ numb tip of my tongue_ tingly toes and fingers_ depression_ paranoia_ EXTREME ANXIETY_ sever panic attacks_ sensation in center of my back which I called ""pill stuck feeling""_ feelings of doom_ somewhat suicidal_ all these side effects started around day 7. I was walking with the family and collapsed to my knees and thought I was dying_ I was yelling at my wife to take me to the er_ I'm dying. She took me home and gave me a Xanax_ and it somewhat subsided_ for that moment. That was the first of many panics. GI dr thought I was crazy accusing Flagyl about these side effects. When I tell you these last 8 months were the worst 8 months of my life it's the gods honest truth.

I still go to church regularly to thank the lord for getting me through this_ and I was never very religious.

If anyone needs any sort of advice feel free to email me at dennisaddessojr@gmail.com. I'm no expert_ but I do have a lot of experience getting through this mess_ and I found that it helps to talk to people who know what you're going through_ because pretty much nobody understood what was happening to me. Just keep thinking the side effects will subside eventually_ for some people it may take longer_ for some it may take less. This medicine was THE worst experience of my life and I wish I never took it. I would rather have lived with the achy pelvis and low back than to have taken this medicine. I think I was misdiagnosed anyway_ I think I had chronic pelvic pain syndrome the whole time_ because it all started with an enlarged prostate. The urologist sent me for a cat scan and it said I had mild thickening of the colonic wall_ and chronic diverticulitis. I never had the normal symptoms of a diverticulitis attack.

The side effects of this drug_ though_ are serious and uncomfortable.  If a person's life were in any way precarious (i.e._ work_ marital or other family difficulties)_ this drug could make you feel as if you were pushed over the edge.  I have had to talk myself back down from all kinds of crazy thoughts about what other people are up to_ etc.  I told my husband I have ""popcorn brain"" -- these crazy thoughts just ""pop up_"" and then I have to deal with them.  It makes you feel sometimes like you are losing your mind.  You also feel depressed_ like what's the point?  Between that feeling and the fatigue and weakness_ it is like walking through corn syrup to get anything done.  I feel I had to basically tough it out the whole time_ and it took a lot out of me at a time when I was already weakened from being sick.  It feels like it will be a long while before I feel like myself again.  Even now_ writing this_ I feel in a cloud and keep having to re-read.  This drug is a bad actor_ and I would not advise anyone taking it unless there is absolutely no other treatment that will get the job done.   ",F,51,10  days500 3X D,2/24/2015,Flagyl
209, 1, colitis,I am prescribed to take 4 x a day but am only taking it 3 x. I already had numbness and tingling in legs_ feet_ arms and hands. I generally feel fatigued as well. BUT this medication has intensified symptoms.  My legs are so weak I feel like I can barely walk. I am also EXTREMELY tired. I haven't experienced weird mental stuff but do feel a bit of brain fog. It has helped a little for the pain but not the severe bloating. I have no appetite either. If what I'm reading is true about not prescribing for people who have nerve issues_ I can't understand why my doctor prescribed it because I am diagnosed with occipital and trigeminal neuralgia.  Main issue for me right now is worsening of numbness and tingling_ tiredness and the aching legs.,Wondering if I'm on too high of dose?

You can't sleep_ and when you do_ you're dreams are totally bizarre. My side effects did not appear until day 3-4.

All reality was yellow_ became opaque with a metallic taste that made my halo written a script for a film where the protagonist was I hallucination_ and suffered a crisis which appeared monstrous beings. Although I have not had diarrhea_ I'm still with these unpleasant effects_ which are much worse than intestinal infection. If you are prescribed metronidazole attempts to go with small doses_ or if you suffer from problems to your nervous system_ be very cautious because if you are intolerant to this drug you feel that you live in the worst possible scenario.

I took an anti-anxiety med after two hours of intensive symptoms but it did nothing for me.  I then decided I needed to be seen at the ER.  They told my they were seeing nystagmus and symptoms were typical of vertigo.  I was put on IV and given a cocktail of a steroid_ meclizine_ Zofran_ Benedryl.  I counted every minute until I felt relief which took about an hour for all to kick in and help me.  I slept on IV for about five hours_ off and on and then was released with a steroid and more meclizine.  When I called my doc's office_ I was told ""gee_ that's our go-to drug for this type of infection_ I've never heard of that happening before.""  Really??!!  Talk about lack of sensitivity!

The best thing to do while on this drug is to get into bed and stay there as nothing good comes from being vertical. I only gave it a 5 because it works but I am NOT satisfied. Too many side effects. I have one dose left and I will be so happy tomorrow. My doc did not give me Cipro as he felt it was overkill but this drug can cause upper respiratory and sinus infections so that must be why they give Cipro in conjunction. Let me up. I've had enough!

My urine is also alot darker than usual_ I drink a lot of water so it's usually very light or clear.I'm glad the med did cleared up my infection. My biggest complaint was the fatigue_ I bartend and waitress. When I first began the med I became so sleepy at work. I literally was not keeping my coordination_ i spilt drinks on multiple occasions and even went from pouring in a glass to pouring on the floor during a sleeping spell. I even spilt a drink on a guest. The sleepiness has gotten hardcore since beginning the meds and I've debated on calling out of work because of it. I also developed some sort of shortlived fear/ anxiety of what could be in the dark. I'm not usually concerned about the dark or of what goes bump in the night_ but since beginning the med_ ive noticed my heightened awareness of those things or my imagination amuck. But I really don't mind_ 7 days isn't that long; I'm greatful that it hasn't made me sick to my stomach or worse whatever that may be. It's endurable and I'm OK with that.,,F,22,7  days500mg,11/29/2014,Flagyl

Metal taste in mouth with a loss of appetite too.  Forced myself to eat each day since I was losing weight. Finally went out and bought some Boost to add extra calories.

So much joint/muscle pain I had to have help getting out of bed. Pill tastes bad but sore and constricted throat was the worst. No appetite and when I forced myself to eat I threw up.

After 4 days it didn't still go away and I got even worse. This drug finished me. I couldn't leave my home_ I couldn't go to work. I couldn't even stay alone in my room for fear that I would die alone. I'd never been in depression before and it scared me. On the physical level_ I felt tired all the time. My arms and legs felt weak and I had constant nausea. But what made me quit the drug was the inability to gulp and breathe. I felt like there was a stone in my throat. This was the final straw. I wouldn't recommend this drug even to my worst enemy.,F,25,4  days500 mg 2X D,11/25/2014,Flagyl

She said to ride it out and finish the prescription. I'm on day 3 and I'm not so sure I can handle this feeling any longer. I feel horrible. Completely out of my element. Horrid eye squinting headachs ... Had a butterfly sensation in my stomach I feel as if I'm pmsing and going Into lala land all at the same time. I haven't slept well in 3 days but yet in exhausted.

264, 3, Blastocystis hominis (parasite),I went to Mexico in May and ever since then_ didn't feel quite right. In August_ I had to take Azrithromycin for another infection and a week later_ I started feeling really sick; food intolerances I never had before_ diareah in the mornings_ some anxiety_ and my body and mind just felt different.  It was finally discovered that I had a parasite and have been prescribed Flagyl to kill this terrible parasite. At first_ I felt okay_ I was still going to the gym and trying to go on with my daily life. I am now on day 8 of 10 and feel anxious_ depressed_ nauseated_ don't want to eat anything_ and definitely tired.  The side effects are pretty terrible but if it works to get rid of my parasite and I don't have to live with a diagnosis of IBS for the rest of my life_ I will be extremely happy.,I don't think this should be prescribed for something such as a tooth ache as these harsh medications can cause other worse_ long-term side effects. If it is effective in clearing conditions such as parasitic infections and C diff_ then it's worth the couple of weeks of hell to be cured for a lifetime. I'm not giving up hope that this will work for me. If you have a story of how this medication helped you_ please let me know!!

Three more days left and not sure if this crap is worth it. My symptoms have gone away_ so that's a plus_ although at this point it seems like a high price to pay--feel like I can barely get out of bed/move_ let alone go to work or function on even the lowest of levels.,As others have stated_ if your condition is very serious and you have no other alternative this may be an ok option. Otherwise_ try to avoid this drug at all costs. Horrible.,F,22,10  days,11/15/2014,Flagyl

273, 1, Bacterial Vaginosis,Immediately after I started taking this medication I noticed my BV symptoms going away. No complaints there. The taste was horrible_ but if you eat something afterwards you won't notice it anymore. Shortly after beginning this medication I began having very severe nightmares and trouble staying asleep for long periods of time. Around day 2 or 3 of the medication I also noticed that I was becoming very irritable and impatient with others. The worst of all the side effects for me personally was the constant drowsiness and difficulty driving. I would literally have to keep my music blaring in my car to keep myself fully awake and alert. This medication should seriously only be taken when there are no other options available.,,F,22,7  days500mg,10/29/2014,Flagyl

276, 3, abscess after appendectomy,Negligence from my surgeon caused me to have leakage and abscess after my appendectomy. After they drained me the first time_ I was in the hospital for 7 days on cipro/flagyl thru IV_ then released where I was on oral cipro/flagyl/fluconazole for another 7 days. Going oral is when I felt the sickness_ after 4 days I felt loss of appetite_ nausea_ bad stomach aches_ anxiety attacks_sweats but I did the course. Had a follow up appointment only to realize I still had another abscess that needed to be drained (no infection tho) so they 're admitted me and I was again in the hospital on iv flagyl/cipro for like 4_5 more days after draining. Now I've been released again where I've been on oral cipro/flagyl for 7 more days and its towards the end of whatever bs course they told me and I'm just feeling all the side effects so I'm quitting this crap. I doubt there's an infection anymore since I've been on these meds for about a month now.

Hopefully the bad side effects will lessen over the next couple of days.,Would I recommend using this drug?....I'm not sure.

I would have much preferred to go on living without knowing I had BV than going through this horror again. I told the nurse at the clinic about my side effects and she said she's never heard of anyone having them_ so I plan to call back again and making her write down all these things that have happened to me so that they can WARN others about this before they take it.

Its hard to take on a full stomach when you are nauseous and on the verge of throwing up. I will continue to take the stuff as the disease is supposed to be very dangerous when left untreated.

On about day 8 I woke up with my skin feeling very hot (like a burn)_ my heart racing & feeling panicky_ dry mouth & constant urination. I talked  with the doctor & I was labeled a worrier & was told to continue taking it. I became so tired & weak I could hardly stand and would shake rigorously. Depression_ foggy mind_ confusion_ despair & sleeplessness were now setting in. I ended up in the ER with dehydration_ low sodium & potassium levels_ rapid heart rate & high blood pressure.

311, 2, C. Diff (lower GI infection),Flagyl was prescribed to be for my C. Diff infection. C. Diff is a terrible infection to have but the side effects of Flagyl made me feel awful 24/7. Everything tasted metallic_ my tongue felt furry and my stomach was so upset that I struggled eating. Taking the medicine itself was a challenged because it tastes really horrible no matter how fast you gulp it down. I suggest eating lots of yogurt with it to rid the bad taste.Unfortunately_ I only lasted 10 doses before I couldn't take it anymore. This caused my infection to recur about a week and a half later. Now_ I must go through another round of Flagyl and stick to it according to my doctor. Flagyl_ is a very effective drug but do try and push through to take every dose_ not miss any and follow through. You don't want to have to take it again! C. Diff is a NASTY infection that you don't want!,I had to take Flagyl as a result of contracting an infection from taking a previous antibiotic called Clindamycin. I was prescribed Clindamycin by my gyno because I had a BV infection. However. the Clindamycin was too high of a dosage to the point where it wiped out the good bacteria in my lower GI causing an infection called C. Diff. Beware when your doctor prescribes Clindamycin_ always question the dosage and duration!!!!,F,22,10  days500 3X D,7/15/2014,Flagyl

Weird white discharge and itchiness_ which prompted me to search message boards and realize that my irritability and tearfulness are probably side effects too. I just got into a new relationship and was fine until I started getting all paranoid and upset_ almost walked away but I really think it's this damn pill.

317, 4, jaw infection,Insomnia was the only really troubling side effect for me. Slight metallic taste in mouth around day 3_ but was gone within 24 hrs. Very mild diarrhea_ stomach was a bit more acidic than usual but nothing I couldn't deal with. Always took with full meal_ had NO ALCOHOL (even mouthwash with alcohol is too much on this med according to my pharmacist) and took every 8 hours with orange Gatorade (helps with bad taste from pill while it's on your tongue).,Be gentle with your body while on this med. I found that not having caffeine_ any NSAIDs (ibuprofen_ aspirin_ naproxen_ etc.) or anything harsh on the stomach lining works best. DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL while on this med - EVEN ONE DRINK. The med causes the body not to be able to eliminate it from your system and it WILL make you very_ very ill. Read the pamphlet that comes with the med. It states this very clearly and it's nothing to mess around with. Overall_ my symptoms are gone from the jaw infection (pain_ swelling) and I would take this med again for a severe infection - all meds have side effects_ but if the alternative is a severe illness or death_ it's well worth it to me. You may have to make a few lifestyle changes while on the med (no alcohol or caffeine_ as mentioned above) but isn't it worth it for a week or two to clear up a raging infection?

GI doc did not know about infection_ waiting for CT scan but recommended taking anyway to eliminate possibility of infection.  Primary care originally had me on 2000 mg a day_ no way on that so GI lowered to 1000 mg a day.  I am an active person_ walk 3 miles a day_ do martial arts_ and hit the gym several days a week after a day on this pretty much on couch watching TV_ no energy to do anything else.  I also live rural and have an hour drive over a two lane mountain road to work_ called GI doc and offered that vision was slightly blurry and driving may not be safe-they offered to stay on the medication for the full 10-day course.  I don't think I can do this as am house bound.  I may offer that for folks who have a verified condition and this drug is ""necessary"" for treatment_ although horrific in regards to side effects_ take it with reservations_ keeping the possible side effects in mind.

Im on my 4th day out of a 10 day script and I cringe each time I have to take it (2x day) because of the Gross metallic taste in mouth_ have to take it with grape soda and eat a snack afterwards to mask the taste. The other side effects aren't too bad ( dark urine_ green stool_somewhat weird dreams_ loss of apetite_ nausea and some fatigue) considering the pain I'm in from having my gut cut open and trying to get up and walk around to ease the pain and swelling.

360, 3, Wisdom tooth infection,Anxiety_ joint pain_ dry mouth_ dull headache,Since I'm allergic to penicillin and have a bad reaction to Erythromycin I have to take this drug. I have found that this medicine has made me feel very tense and anxious. I can only describe it as feeling like I have constant butterflies - like I have a big exam or job interview tomorrow kind of feeling. I am not normally someone who suffers from this kind of feeling at all so until I read the reviews on here I was quite worried. It also made me feel quite achy - my wrists and ankles in particular ached_ and I woke up each morning feeling almost hungover (while of course you cannot drink at all on this medicine so it wasn't a real hangover!) - dry mouth_ hazy_ headachy feeling. I would say though that it has cleared up the infection very quickly so is worth taking for that and ANYTHING is better than the terrible experience I had on Erythromycin for the same infection.,F,23,7  days 3X D,11/16/2013,Flagyl

The side effects are overwhelming. I thought there was seriously something wrong with me and that I'm going crazy with night and day sweats and panic along with anxiety. i was considering seeing a psychiatrist until I read that other people had similar side effects.

Evidently it was the milder choice for my problem though. It has cleared up the non-stop diarrhea but I am wondering if it may be case of the cure being worse than the disease. Tomorrow I go see what it has done to my INR. I have to be on it for two more days.

The people commenting about how this drug is ruining their life and stuff like that crack me up and they are probably still on it because it does mess with your emotions slightly. For me it makes me pretty drowsy I would compare to the calm sedated feeling of a vicodin high. it also did give me a minor rash that itched but benadryl helped.

434, 2, cdiff,I actually posted on here a couple of weeks ago giving this drug a thumbs up however that's until the 13th day of taking this drug turned into a nightmare.  I began breaking out in hives and had severe itching so my dr. took me off the meds. Two weeks later I was still breaking out in hives. These weren't normal rashes and bumps...the more I scratched the more welps and hives appeared. I finally went back to my dr after I notice my palm became red and itchy when I accidentally bumped it on my table. It seemed as if every insult to my skin or body was causing extreme itching and hives.  So the verdict is in....I have developed dermatographism. I am now taking prednizone in attempt to hopefully be normal again. My drs and I are all hoping that this will not become chronic and life long.

Although it helped my C Diff - which was caused by a different antibiotic_ it was the worst thing I was ever on. With each pill I just became sicker and sicker.

446, 1, bacterial diarrhea,This crap has destroyed the last 6 days of my life and counting. I'm a very mentally stable person_ well this gave me the most horrible panic attacks and anxiety compared feeling like dying!  So every time anxiety kicked in it made my gut so stressed that my effects worsen_ I thought I was going to die went crazy and paranoid_ please avoid this crap. Apart from mental issues like it was not enough_ terrible abdominal pain blotted all the time...loss of appetite and nausea...tiredness unbalance unable to concentrate_ weakness_ metal taste and dry mouth_ loss of sex drive totally...gassy_ gut noises_...loose stools yellowish looking. I should stop now,"My dr in Singapore prescribed this crap before even knowing if I had bacteria or not ""to save time"" turned out stool culture came negative once I was done with the 5 days. During the 5 days no significant effects at all. After 3 days of taking it the nightmare started being all alone in Asia and I'm from Mexico imagine! So today is 1 week I'm off this poison and though the original issue of explosive diarrhea is cured_ this is 100 times worse. Today seemed like a good day with reduction of anxiety and my energy got to the point that I played tennis for 2 hours_ then again my tummy blotted after the game and I have now severe abdominal pain. Went to dr this morning and she was saying I should be off the symptoms by now because her ""book"" said it and her book did not include anxiety as a side effect...she related the anxiety to other shit. I will email her this link so she can learn more about this HORRIBLE POISON THAT HAS RUINED me for now.

Nausea and dizziness seemed to wane by day three_ but fatigue continued throughout. By final three days_ began to experience stomach ache/gas pains. In general_ I felt the worst in the morning.,I am on my last day of Flagyl and infection seems to be cured. Side effects of this drug are intense_ but manageable. I took pill after eating_ which seemed to help with nausea and dizziness. I stayed out of the sun and did light exercise/stretching at home (I am a runner_ so this was an especially difficult week for me).

My body aches and my moods are unpredictable. The initial pain in my lower left gut was intolerable and it is subsiding now after taking this medication. I have another six days to go and getting through the first 3 days was hell. My body didn't want to consume food but without it_ I could not keep the medication down. Everything tastes nasty! First night_ I got a Flagyl stuck in my throat and choked on it. It's chalky and filled my mouth with the taste of a 1000 aspirin. I gagged and gagged and am gagging thinking about it.

It's been much of the same since then. I'm currently on day 6_ and I'll be glad when it's over. The worst part is the fatigue and confusion.

Prior to starting this course infection was spreading rapidly through facial spaces_ was quickly brought under control (within 3/4 days.) Seems my experience is more positive than many on here. For dental problems people suffering severe reactions to Flagyl may want to ask their doctor about alternatives such as erythromycin_ which tend to have less extreme effects. Most disturbing effect was a vertigo-like dizziness_ thankfully so far this has been relatively short term though.

After my fourth pill (nighttime dosage) I woke up sick to my stomach with a terrible_ vertigo-like feeling. I was also shaking and chilled. I made it to work_ but went home two hours later after throwing up (more like wretching up stomach acid) twice.

592, 1, Amoebas/Parasite,Intense and unwelcome side effects. The pills worked but by day 3 or 4 I was ready to quit. 10 days was torture. I had an amoeba which caused persistent diarrhea_ stomach pain_ weakness_ nausea and inability to eat. The medicine made all these symptoms a million times worse and added to then intense_ persistent headaches (I get migraines and can tolerate an intense headache but these were constant and unbearable). All I wanted to do was sleep. The pills made me dizzy and i had heart palpitation while on the course. I finishsed the 10 days and now_ 7 months later have gone to the dr for numbness in face/hands/feet_ bizarre organ pains_ dizziness and instability_ weight gain_ heart palpitations and chest tightness....all of which he says are long term side effects of the Flagyl. Im on a 7 days steroid treatment to hopefully relieve these symptoms.,Wouldnt not take this medication again if there was another course of treatment available,F,25,10  days 3X D,10/3/2011Email,Flagyl
593, 4, Giardiasis,nausea_ abd pain were worse already present but made worse by the drug.. 24 hrs after last dose I experienced visual disturbances (floaters)_ vertigo_ presyncope_ tinnitus_ hearing loss_ weakness_ and generally felt like I was out on the open seas in a Force 10 storm.. Can not stand up without falling over..,rapid onset of acute vertigo w/o inner ear issues prior to taking drug .. are listed as 'less serious' side effects.. compared to seizures I guess that's accurate. However_ the Sx come on so fast and furious that they are often accompanied by panic attacks and extreme anxiety!!  Which is understandable since you can't move once they're present.. what's really scary is that neither the Doc or the Pharmacist mentioned that the CURE may be worse than the DISEASE.  Approach this drug with EXTREME CAUTION.. You will potentially need someone available to drive you to urgent care or the emergency room... inner ear disturbances left untreated can lead to permanent hearing damage.,F,52,10  days500MG 3X D,9/27/2011,Flagyl

The extreme nausea and headaches in the first few days were barely tolerable_ but went away after about day 4.  However_ on day 7_ I woke up in the middle of the night with EXTREME pains in my upper abdomen.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  I called 911 and had to be taken to the emergency room in an ambulance.  I couldn't breathe and could barely talk.  The pain was excruciating.  After 45 minutes_ the pain went away.  The doctors couldn't tell me what it was.  They did tons of tests but the only thing that was abnormal was my liver function.  I was discharged and told to stop taking the antibiotics.  3 days later I had two more attacks.  I went to see a gastroenterologist and she did an endoscopy_ which costs a fortune.  She found gastritis_ but otherwise all else was normal.  We suspect it was side effects from the medicine.  My unknown GI infection seems to be gone_ so the medicine did its job on that_ but at what cost???

Had probiotics 3 hours after antibiotic dose (twice a day)_ Liv52 and Vitamin B complex once daily. Drank plenty of fluids. No metallic taste or no change to urine color. some days stomach would cramp and i would have frequent bowel movement.

I am also concerned that the Flagyl has contributed to the increased frequency of migraines I have experienced since taking the antibiotic.  Since this particular antibiotic has potentially serious/fatal neurological side effects - and migraines are_ in part_ neurological - I would avoid taking it again for any reason and would recommend to those with other neurological issues to use extreme caution.  I would also like to add that some of the side effects - tingling/numbness_ lack of balance_ slurred speech/mental fogginess_ bloating - have persisted even after 10 days off the drug.  Although they are fading like the other symptoms_ be prepared to contend with side effects for awhile after completing your course.,F,29,7  days500 MG 2X D,7/13/2011Email,Flagyl

633, 4, Vaginal Infection,insomnia_ anxiety_ nervousness_ increased impatience (just me?)_ stomach pain_ faintness/dizziness_ loss of appetite_ back/neck pain,First off_ the drug DID help treat my vaginal infection (blah_ sorry for the men out there).  BUT the symptoms were definitely hard to deal with.  I'm petite so drugs typically hit me hard anyway_ and I was prescribed 500 MG twice daily for 14 DAYS!  Yep.  14 days.The first few days I experienced nausea and an acute stabbing pain in my stomach.  Then the insomnia kicked in. Around Day 8 I was actually awoken from my sleep from what I thought was a female voice warning me about a fire (ah_ gotta love drug-induced hallucinations).  I ran around the house looking for smoke only to realize there was nothing amiss.There was a growing sense of anxiety/impatience/nervousness which heightened to the point of stopping my meds at Day 12 (under the advice of my doc).About a week in_ I was hit with a cold/virus/flu that took me out of commission for a good while.  So I'm uncertain if the flu-like symptoms were due to that or the meds.  I also experienced back pain early on and neck pain later during my virus-time.All in all_ this did help treat me_ but at a high cost.

After that episode dizziness was off and on. During the last 2 days of treatment_ severe fatigue and confusion set in. I had difficulty concentrating_ speaking_ and staying awake. It was a general feeling of being detached from reality. I also experienced a lot of stiffness in my neck_ and some headaches. I did experience loose stools throughout the treatment period. I did not have any nausea or abdominal pain_ but I always made sure I took the medication on a full stomach.,The medication appears to have helped_ although I never had any symptoms of BV_ it just showed up on my pap. I would say that the side effects were disconcerting until I read more about them. It was disruptive to my work day_ but overall manageable. I took the last dose this morning. I am hoping the residual fatigue_ confusion_  and neck pain will clear up in the next 48 hours or so. I would recommend that anyone who cannot afford to be completely out of it for 4-7 days choose another antibiotic if possible - you really just need to stay in bed - if you experience the same symptoms as I have DO NOT DRIVE OR OPERATE ANY MACHINERY - THESE SYMPTOMS AND SIDE EFFECTS COME AND GO AND WILL CATCH YOU COMPLETELY OFF GUARD,F,32,7  days500MG 2X D,6/30/2011,Flagyl

I could hardly walk_ I felt as though I was carrying 9'lb bowling ball in my pelvis.  My uterus felt like it was being expelled through my vagina due to the pelvic pressure.  My bladder felt battered and I had to urinate every 20 mins to an hour because I couldn't stand,This drug should not be dispensed without a thorough patient understanding of the potential side effects.

DO NOT take both meds at the same time; separate them by at least 1/2 an hour and you may have fewer problems (if you do have any). My pharmacy clearly labels the Flagyl with a warning not to take with other medication unless directed by your doctor.  The only problem I have with these two meds is some insomnia and I altered the dose time and resolved that issue_ making sure my second dose in the day was not so late at night as I had been taking it.

652, 1, BV,The first side effect I experienced was loose stools.  After that passed_ my guts felt bloated and active.  I felt like I was in a cloud_ totally out of it.  On my daily walk_ my legs felt heavy and I felt very lethargic.  My speech didn't feel 100% and I mixed up a few consonants here and there_ at which point I googled for info and found this site.,After my routine GYN appointment_ my dr called to say I had an overgrowth of bacteria and suggested I take this medicine.  I didn't have any symptoms whatsoever.  I joked that it would be hard to take because of my daily wine consumption.  At first I thought the symptoms were related to alcohol withdrawal and dismissed it.  But my research on alcohol withdrawal didn't describe anything like I started feeling on Day 2.  While the symptoms are tolerable_ what concerns me is what is coming... the anxiety_ depression_ insomnia_ nightmares_ dark urine_ nerve tingling_ etc.  It doesn't seem right that a drug should affect the whole body like that.  For me_ who had no apparent BV symptoms_ it was hard to justify continuing it.  Also_ reading that the BV has a high probability of returning once meds are done also didn't sound right to me.  I googled homeopathic remedies for this situation since it seemed to me that I'm suffering a mild bacterial imbalance that is probably diet related.  Which means it'd likely come back once this drug is done.  There is a lot of very good information and tips out there about how to manage this without drugs -- it just seems to make a whole lot more sense.

Chewing gum has helped_ but I could only do that so much before my jaw started to hurt.

You have to remember that most people taking the time to comment on a drug will have had a negative experience.  I'm here to do the opposite to ease some people's minds_ hopefully.  I had no serious problems other than diarrhea which subsided after I finished the medication.  I was kind of lightheaded_ but that was actually kind of interesting.

I have now been off the Flagyl for 2 days and the numbness_ tingling and stomach pains are still there.

679, 4, BV,"Headaches_ dizziness_ bad taste in mouth_ nausea_ general feeling of being ""out of it"" the last couple of days",I only knew I had BV because I got a pap and my doctor told me my bacterial levels were out of whack and it needed to be treated if I was going to try and get pregnant in the next few months (it did explain some periodic bouts of itching over the last year_ but they were never anything tragic - just felt like I about to get a yeast infection that would then go away a day later).  I really noticed very few side effects of the Flagyl for the first three or four days I was on it_ but around the fifth day I noticed I felt a little out of whack while trying to exercise one night_ and had to quit 3/4 of the way through my 50 minute workout.  The sixth night I had periodic bouts of dizziness while walking around the mall that I chalked up to waiting to long to eat dinner and not having drank anything in several hours (eating did help_ but I was also on my couch by then).  On the seventh day I noticed a nasty taste in my mouth that lead me to believe I might be getting sick until my husband pointed out it could be the antibiotics (eating and gum helps_ but it always comes back).  I took my last dose yesterday morning (the eighth day) which was about 29 hours ago and I still feel loopy and out of it_ so I'm hoping once the drug is out of my system (I'm under the impression that will be around the 48 hours after taking the last dose) that I'll start to feel more like myself.

She said that she as sure that it was an STD. I was told to come back in 3 days for the culture results. While there_ I was prescribed 1g of Azithromycin and a shot (I forgot the name) which is used to treat Gonnorhea. The docters felt it best to treat me in case...my cultures came back and they were negative for Onorrhea and Chlamydia. However_ I still had the symptoms! While at the ER_  another docter said that it could be Bacterial Vaginosis or Trichamonias! He said that there was no test for BV and that physicians went off of the patients symptoms to diagnose...thus_ I wasn't given a pelvic exam for Trichmonias either because the docter said that the medicine he was going to prescribe would take care of that if it was present. I was prescribed Flagyl 500 mg 2 x a day for 7 days. I experienced all of the listed symptoms the first 2 days! I discontinued the medication and am awaitng a scheduled appt.

695, 1, C-Diff,WARNING TO C-DIFF PATIENTS! Flagly was not only ineffective in curing my C-Diff infection_ in my opinion_ it contributed to my near death battle with C-Diff nine years ago.  I recently contracted C-Diff again as a result of taking an antibiotic_ and my infectious disease team said they are finding that Flagyl is not effective for C-Diff.  Although I understand that doctors are advised to prescribe Flagyl initially_ I recommend that you closely monitor your symptoms.  If the diarehha isn't controlled quickly_ consider requesting vancomycin.  Finally_ I would highly recommend that an infectious disease team provide medical treatment.

Each time it gets rid of the infection but at the expense of making me feel even worse while I'm on it. The worst side effect is definitely the nausea. It's more like sea sickness as it makes me feel really disorientated and woozy at the same time. The second worst effect is the brain fog_ especially as a university student.

I'm on day 5 now of my 7 day treatment and I'm urinating more normally now. Stomach pains started right when I began treatment and were pretty severe a few times. The metallic taste is horrible_ but I've noticed its the worst (almost unbareable) when laying down. I wake up with horrible acid reflux which I have never had before in my life. What I've tried is drinking some milk and elevating my head and upper body with some extra pillows which helps with the metallic taste and acid reflux a lot. I've also been extremely exhausted_ sleeping many hours a night and still feeling drained when I wake up. I have constant chills after taking the med. It basically feels like a case of the flu. I haven't experienced any anxiety_ panic attacks_ or confusion like some other people have been reporting. I have no appetite_ probably because im not digesting properly. I constantly feel full and slightly nauseas. I haven't vomited or anything though. The side effects are not worth the outcome. I agave never experienced so many side effects with one drug. The sleepiness alone is keeping me from functioning properly. I wake up after sleeping ten hours and I need to go back to sleep a few hours later because I'm so exhausted.

I checked my journal from 4 years ago when I took this drug and realized that I had been to 2 charity events and had alcohol during the treatment. I had no side effects during that time. I am avoiding alcohol this time (okay_ I had one little sip) since I am a little older and on Atavin. I could not find any real research or studies that connected problems with Flagyl and alcohol.My feeling is that some people will sympathetically get a side effect because they read that a particular side effect is possible.I am on day 6 so far and doing okay.,M,63,10  days250 3X D,12/8/2010,Flagyl

I was so shocked when I was told I had Trich bc I had no symtoms. The reason why I went to the docter bc I broke up with my boyfriend and I always get a check up when I go in or get out of a relationship and the guy I deal with must do the same. I was correct to break up with him bc I felt he was still messing around with his ex. I'm piss bc I have to take these pills bc of some female who doesnt take care of herself.

It's hard to tell if your condition is improving when you take this drug.  The doctor recommended I take this drug for a second round because I was still experiencing stomach pains_ though in retrospect I wonder if the pains were just residual pain from the first round!  still_ I've been able to go to work and more or less live normally_ just that my stomach won't calm down and I've lost more weight than I would like.,M,36,5  days500 MG 3X D,10/25/2010,Flagyl

The first time_ I had trich_ it was my fault the pills didn't work because I didn't take them as directed.  For trich_ you're supposed to take 4 pills at once_ and that's it.  But I accidentally took 1 pill per day for four days.  I got oral thrush_ a yeast infection_ and the trich didn't go away.  I got another round of Flagyl (Metronidazole)_ and took all four pills at once_ and the doctor couldn't tell if the trich was gone_ because I had too much yeast infection medicine in me to get a good sample.  Anyway_ the doctor said not to worry_ and that I should be cured.  I'm not sure if I was re-infected by my partner (who took the pills wrong like I did the first time_ and was never re-treated)_ or if the trich just came back_ but about 3-4 months later_ I have trich again_ AND BV this time.So the doc gave me 14 pills_ 500mg each.  I'm supposed to take four at once_ then 2 per day for five more days afterwards.  The first 4 is for trich_ the rest are to treat the BV.  The doc offered a medicinal alternative_ but the Flagyl (Metronidazole) was free_ and the alternative cost money_ so I opted for the Metronidazole/Flagyl again.Today was my first four pills_ and the metallic taste is already horrible!  I'm feeling tired and dizzy_ too.  But I can say that the infection seems to already be clearing up.  It's a very aggressive drug_ but maybe that's a good thing.

I hope that it is completely cleared by my last dosage (today) but I cannot comment on it's true effectiveness yet.  I did not get a yeast infection from this drug because I have been taking probiotic supplements and eating plenty of yogurt.

The first time_ I experienced moderate nausea_ dark urine_ diarreah_ abdominal pain_ and extreme fatigue.This second time isn't so bad. I only got slight nausea from the taste. The trick is to put it all the way at the back of your tongue and swallow to avoid the awful taste. It also helps to eat about half hour before taking medicine to reduce nausea. Dark urine is normal. It makes me go to the bathroom a time or two more than normal.I guess it's better when you get used to it.

I drove home became extremely light headed because I was dehydrated so I made myself drink a cup of water. Immediately after drinking it I became EXTREMELY nauseous and tried eating something. I made sure I didn't throw up that day because I knew I was incredibly dehydrated. I didn't actually vomit until the last day where I had to throw up because it made me feel so gross. After taking the medication I am now suffering from constipation because I was so dehydrated for a week.

Then did the same thing for the next couple days until I was finished with the drugs. Not sure if this was good or bad because I decreased the dosage by doing this but I had to get the pain in my esophagus and chest to stop. Today was the last of the medicine and I am feeling much better. The Matalic taste is still there but the horrible pain in my chest is gone. I never want to take this drug again.

As of the 5th day_ all I've experienced is diarrhea with some stomach discomfort.  I took Pepto-Bismol yesterday_ and that cleared it right up.  The only other symptom I had was some extreme lethargy_ but that could have been due to the infection itself.  I can't believe that some people have admitted themselves to a hospital or have had the severe side effects as reported here (in fact_ it made me wonder whether or not the comments were coming from a competing pharma company)_ but who knows...maybe I have an iron stomach_ and maybe I can handle medication more easily than most people.  I even drank alcohol with it (a no-no according to my doc_ the pharmacist_ and many internet sites)_ and didn't experience any side effects at all.,F,39,5  days500 mg 2X D,7/12/2010,Flagyl

I am on day 5 and don't think I can take it anymore.  I am soooooo tired_ but when I lay down to sleep I feel like every nerve in my body_ especially arms and legs are so fired up I flit and jerk around constantly...as well as feel like my heart is going to come right out of my mouth...it has gotten rid of my diverticulitis symptom_ but created 20 others....my mouth tastes like crap by the way!!!,F,44,10  days500MG 4X D,7/12/2010,Flagyl

Diarrhea was so bad that doctor took me off Cipro but said to continue Flagyl and take Immodium for diarrhea.  The other side effects are annoying but I can tolerate them if it means the meds are working. I only have two more days to go but this is probably the worse medicine I have had to take.  I do get the metallic taste when I swallow the pill but luckily mine does not last.  My pain from the diverticulitis had started to subside before I was put on this medication.  I had already started to alter my eating habits.  I will finish the regimen and hopefully will not have to take this ever again.

828, 3, C diff colitis,The drug flagyl made me as sick if not sicker than the c diff colitis.  I was unable to eat or drink for about the first 5 days. Once I was able to drink fluids Pediolite was the only thing that helped me through.  I truly felt like I was going to die. I have never been this sick in my life.  Constant nausea and diarrhea. I ended up at the hospital 3 different times over 4 days for fluids and medication through an IV. This drug also caused me to have an elevated heart rate the entire time I took the drug. It was very difficult to sleep because my resting heart rate stayed so high. If you can tolerate the drug it will eventually make you feel better but you will feel sick the entire time you take it. I also experienced lots of acid reflux when I was able to resume eating and it took about 5 days for that to calm down. I am 3 weeks post Flagyl and still have lots a gastro issues and food senstivity.  I also lost 22+lbs in a 3 week period. Recovery and digestion is a VERY slow process.,It worked but I was NOT happy with all the side effects. My gastro told me that there are other medications to treat c diff colitis but they are so expensive that most insurance companies will not cover them so they REALLY encourage you to weather through with the flagyl. Eat lots of yogurt and start probiotics right away.  My gastro told me to continue with the probiotics for at least 2 months to hopefully prevent a recurrance of the c diff colitis.,F,36,10  days500mg 3X D,6/26/2010,Flagyl

838, 1, Suspected Ghiardia (persistent),I have a history of anxiety issues - which were brought under control over the last 4 years through holistic medicine to the extent that I had forgotten about them. This medication changed that. Shortly after taking Flagyl I started experiencing panic attacks_ what started out as tingling but ultimately led to pain and burning across my body (particularly the extremities)_ taste sensitivity and burning on my tongue_ euphoria upon taking a dose and feeling a 'crash' before the next_ etc. I have been off the medication for about 2.5 weeks now and am still experience these symptoms_ though they are definitely gradually decreasing (which is awesome and relieving). I expect them to fully resolve_ though it appears it will take some time.,If you are going to try Flagyl_ I would recommend the following tact: take it for one day and see how you feel. If you suspect anything_ immediately stop. I knew within 24 hours that this medication was going to cause problems but I didn't heed my hearts advice and continued to take it 4 more punishing days. I spoke with my Dr and he said the tingling can be present and advised i cut the dose in half_ but I still had problems. I could not complete the 10 day course. I have found that_ given my disposition to anxiety_ I have a hard time taking any medication that can impact the central nervous system. I can take zithromax_ cefzil_ amoxicillin_ etc. with impunity - little to zero side effects. But flagyl_ doxycycline_ cipro/levaquin_ are extremely bad for me. This is to a degree true with my family as well_ so perhaps there is a genetic component to this. If you have problems with medications that affect the central nervous system_ or the medications i mentioned above_ you may want to be very cautious and careful around Flagyl. Bail out after the first 24 hours if you notice any funny business. Don't let your doctor tell you to keep taking it_ *protect yourself* and ask your doctor an alternative! Your health and well being are worth it!(I don't want to scare anyone off from trying this medication if it will benefit them_ just please be cautious and responsible if you notice problems).,M,32,5  days500 2X D,6/7/2010,Flagyl

On day 3 I was floored with flu like symptoms much like I've read from other posters.  I had to stop any form of exercise as my muscles cramped easily.  This is a rough round of meds and I'm still slowly recovering from these side affects after being off of it for more than a week.  My appetite is slowly coming back_ my stomach has intermittent clenching pain_ but my energy has rebounded fully and I'm able to exercise and not feel a need to go to bed two hours earlier than normal like when I was taking Flagyl.  I recommend taking this medication during periods of light work and/or responsibilitiesd because it is very disagreeable.

Taking probiotic 1-2 x per day and swallowing the pill with yogurt (makes it go down easily with minimal taste) and then a big glass of water. C diff diarrhea ended abruptly after first day on Metro (frequency of bowel movements dropped from 10-15 per day to 2-4_ always in the morning). Stools odorless_ loose_ clean (little or nothing on toilet paper afterwards) - but not like post-Clindamycin period. Can't wait to get off Metro and ALL antibiotics.,Background: Before Flagyl I was on Clindamycin 1 week for removal of infected upper molar. After stopping Clindamycin I developed diarrhea (loose_ pellet-like stools_ like rabbit droppings_ odorless_ clean but 10-15x/day_ with great diarrhea-like urgency) which went on for TWO weeks (no other symptoms like fever_ cramping_ bleeding_ etc.). Waited 2 full weeks to make absolutely sure it was not going to go away on its own_ then called my doctor. He did stool test_ c diff showed up_ & he put me on Metro for 10-14 days.

I told my husband that if I kept feeling the way that I did that I would rather just be knocked out until I didn't have to take the meds anymore!! I was miserable. My body ached and I felt like I had been ran over by a BIG truck. I really felt like I could just crawl up in a ball and stay there until it got better. I had a very vary BITTER taste in my mouth and honestly this medication made me feel forse than having the upset stomach for 2 weeks straight! I called the doctor and the nurse told me that the side effects would go away in a few days but it never did!! I was counting down the days until I was finished with the meds!! I don't want to scare anyone but I just want you,Terrible side effects...I took it for the entire week and my stool cultures came back negative so actually I probably never needed the meds in the first place.

I am thin due to a hyperactive thyroid and I lost 8 lbs of suffering with c diff.  I've been many antibiotics this year due to reoccurring UTI's and have become resistant to most of them.  When I was put on 250 mg. of Ceftin twice a day_ the nightmare began three days later. I was then put on Microban for the UTI & doc never mentioned c diff.  Tons of mucous_ no appetite_ scorching pain the lower abdomen_ almost fainting in the bathroom_ dehydrated_ blood pressure dropped to 76/66 & then some more.  In addition_ I had an allergic reaction and broke out in an hot_ itchy rash that started at my ankles & went up to my waist 11 days after stopping the Ceftin.  Flagyl's side effects are super mild compared to what the Ceftin did to me. It has helped me so far.  I have one week left for Flagyl. Going to see the gastro specialist on Tues. & I'm hoping no damage was done & the c diff doesn't come back.

849, 3, bacterial vaginosis,My biggest side effect was hair thinning. If your hair is already short in areas you may experience extreme breakage or a mini bald spot. Once you stop the medicine your hair strengths back to its original stage. Nasty taste especially when drinking water. The fishy odor becomes lighter and discharge diminish; however 1-3 months the bacterial returns. I have taken this medicine for the same thing on many occasions. The side effects can very negative especially to have it return once again. In addition_ I experience yeast symptoms afterwards.,I am beginning to realize that we need to read more and update our knowledge skills. I challenge you all to find out the ingredients that are place in these antiobiotics. I highly recommend trying natural products. Go to a natural food store these products have no side effects. Plus they are very helpful and have books that you can research what you are going to take before purchasing it. It's time to take control of our bodies.

I specialist prescribed flagyl. My primary care didn't test me for c. diff because it was my dentist that had put me on two courses of antibiotics_ always tell your doc ANY antibiotics you have been on if you have stomach pain_ I didn't have diarrhea so apparently the thought never crossed my mind to put that into the symptoms when I checked online. The symptoms are the worst in the morning_ and gradually decrease throughout the day. The worst side effect is the fatigue. I would suggest anyone who takes any antibiotic to also start a regimen of probiotics. It helped me to take the probiotics three hours after the dose of flaygl. I truly believe my side effects were greatly diminished because of the probiotics; Kefir_ ""Good Belly""_ Cultrelle_ and Florastor are all good.

It was a very scary feeling- my entire body felt like it was going numb and I could hardly walk for about 2 hours after each dose.  My heart was also pounding out of my chest.  Called the doctor and I'm switching to Vancomycin tomorrow.  I did find_ as others_ to put it right into yogurt to swallow to avoid the taste.

Believe the extreme side effects this time are related to the high doses and long-duration I have had to take the Flagyl throughout hospitalization_ surgery_ and at home.  Was not educated on serious potential side effects.  Thought I was going crazy until reading detailed side effect information online today.

The metallic taste was evident from Day 1 - I'd even wake up in the morning with it.. Yuck. The throbbing headaches came about on day 6 and only seemed to affect the right side of my head.. It even hurt to touch my scalp and ear on that side. The depression hit around day 3-4_ feelings of low self worth and anxiety.

889, 1, Ano-rectal abscess,Unfortunately_ I had to cease taking this drug due to peripheral neuropathy. Within one hour of ingestion of the second dose_ the calf area around my leg tightened and felt as if it were asleep. To relieve it_ I got up to walk around but no relief. The tightening soon developed into numbness which caused me to remove my socks and massage my leg. After laying down for an hour_ the numbness was not in both legs and developed into pain. I tolerate discomfort and pain very well so I knew this was unusual. After three or four hours_ the pain moved up to the rest of my leg. If anyone experiences this_ they should stop the drug immediately as this is a sign of nerve damage_ sometimes irreversible. Check out this website for more info: http://millercenter.uchicago.edu/learnaboutpn/typesofpn/toxic/drugs.shtml,This was simply my experience. It appears that my reaction is rare_ perhaps even extremely rare. The scientific literature states that this problem occurs when high doses are taken for at least 30 days. But clearly this was not the case in my experience. It occured after 2 pills in less than 16 hours. It appears Flagyl is used widely and most people do not experience any serious side effects so do not be concerned if you are not having any serious side effects. If you are having numbness_ tingling_ in hands or feet or having an allergic reaction_ cease taking the drug and seek medical care. Otherwise_ do not drink alcohol while taking this drug or 48 hours after you have taken it.,M,35,1  days500 mg 3X D,3/10/2010,Flagyl

This round however is unbearable i cant function or do anything that requires energy i can look at food and feel extremely odd like i dont know what to do with myself. Hopefully switching to Vanco tomorrow i cannot take 15 more days of this,F,19,6  days,1/19/2010,Flagyl
915, 4, Diverticulitis,I've been feeling most of the side effects except for nausea thank goodness.  Fatigue_ metallic taste_ anxious_ etc.  The one that is really killing me is the headaches... it feels like my brain wants to crawl out of my skull.  I was diagnosed at an Urgent Care facility... I get to see regular doctor tomorrow... hopefully he'll be able to help me out.,I'm willing to put up with the other side effects_ but the headache is damn near crippling and I am a teacher_ I NEED to be able to function.  Anyone else having this problem?,M,35,3  days,1/18/2010,Flagyl
916, 1, c difficile,Nausea_ anorexia_ anxiety_ depression_ terrible taste in my mouth during and after taking the pill.  Insomnia if I took the 3rd pill of the day so I took it 2times a day instead of 3.  Lethargy_upset stomach_ no interest in anything I usually do.,This is a terrible drug and people should be warned before beginning it to take a probiotic with it and after it.  Never take an antibiotic without a probiotic,F,61,10  days,1/18/2010,Flagyl
917, 1, BV,Extreme nausea_ loss of energy_ loss of appetite_ depression.,On the fifth day I considered stopping it altogether and hoping for the best. However I called the doctor's office and they prescribed the same medication (called Metrogel) to be taken intravaginally. Hopefully this will not produce the horrible nausea. I have never experienced this kind of reaction on any antibiotic and I have taken many over 40 years. Believe me I am not a drama queen or a wimp but I will never take Flagyl again.,F,40,5  days,1/12/2010,Flagyl

919, 4, diverticulitis/bladderinfection,Nausea_ extreme tiredness_light headed.depression.This is my second attack of diverticulitis which seems to infect my bladder as well. The last attack I had was in June 09 and the pain was so bad I had to go to the emergency room. I was given flagyl 500 mg 3 times a day with 500 mg of cipro 2x a day. Beside being in pain the flagyl was the most horrible medication I had ever experienced in my life. I was nauseated 24/7_ tired and disoriented. After 4 days I called my Dr and told him about the nausea and overall terrible side effects of the flagyl. He prescribed me Famotidine for the nausea. I took the Famotidine at the same time as the flagyl and still was feeling terrible and nauseated. I finished the 14day treatment_suffered hell through it all_ but bottom line it worked.,I didn't follow my diet so I have to blame myself for this second attack. This time I saw a different DR that prescribed the same meds except he dropped the 500 flagyl to 2x a day instead of 3x a day saying 3x a day wasn't necesscary. He also told me to take the Famotidine 30 minutes before taking the Flagyl.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  I have not been nauseated or felt even a 1/3 of the hell I went through before. I am not saying this is the wonder pill but it sure helped me.A little bit about me!  I am the type of person that gets nauseated if the elevator stops quickly_ so you know I don't have the best stomach to begin with. I normally go for holistic healing and hardly ever do prescription drugs so this was tramautizing to say the least. Since my infection was in my colon I had to do a liguid diet_ so eating food with this med was not possible. Thank God for the Famotidine!!  I took it with soy milk_ bannana and spiruteen mix. I have also been drinking 100% cranberry juice to kill bacteria. The best price I found on the 100% cranberry was at trader joes. I wish you all a speedy recovery!,M,55,4  days,1/10/2010Email,Flagyl

Much reassured by the comments here as I was having bad depression had no idea why!Was prescribed it for Bacterial VAginosis-the 'cure' is INFINITELY worse than the complaint. Stick to the topical cure of Relactagel or its equivalent. Thank you for this website.,F,31,5  days,1/10/2010,Flagyl
921, 3, C-Diff reoccurance,depressed feeling (Didnt want to do ANYTHING i normally do)_ Felt the urge to go to the bathroom but nothing came out_ brown urine_ dry mouth_ stomach would make girgly noises_ and i felt sick ALL THE TIME!,Flagyl helped get rid of the c-diff. But the side effects of this medication were HORRIBLE. This is my second time having c-diff_ and the symptoms were worse the second time around.  STAY AWAY from Antibiotics,F,19,14  days,1/8/2010,Flagyl
922, 2, suspected SIBO--bacteria in gut,Most bothersome was watery diarrhea. Occasional fatigue was tolerable. Merely inconvenient were dark urine_ metallic-tasting tongue_ dry mouth_ loss of desire to eat.,Took 500 mg_ thrice daily_ for 9-1/3 days. Started concurrently with Cipro 500 mg_ twice daily_ for 7 days. Extreme watery diarrhea persisted for 5 days after Flagyl ended (7 days after Cipro) ended. I started B. infantis probiotic 3 days after Flagyl ended and watery diarrhea continued.The Flagyl-Cipro combination did not help my original symptoms_ which I suspected were caused by SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth).,M,54,9  days,1/8/2010,Flagyl
923, 3, BV or pid?,Metallic taste (drink lots of water anyway cuz this med affects the kidneys_ wash it downI make what I call Scurvy Water which is a wedge of fresh lime squeezed in cold water which I like and drink lots of); got like first-day menstrual cramps in center and off to right side (seemed to worsen after on med); diarrhea stopped after about 4th day; 500 mg. 2x day_ 7 days; very slightly dizzy_ not bad; tad nauseous with or without food_ not bad; hope this works_ I have pain tylenol is ineffective on.  Been forced to use 1/2 tab of hydrocodone 500 which was originally for my occasional migraines in order to sleep.  On day 5 of treatment.  Will give it a few more days.  Hope hubby can stand me_ have the occasional snappishness on this stuff.  Big advantage is the med is really cheap.  In that context_ hope it works.,"The itching has stopped_ but I'm not done with the med yet.  Will try to post a few days after I have stopped the med.  ""I ain't got no amoebas_"" is what I tell my hubbie.  I'm 58 and my estrogen is certainly low_ which is what can make BV very repetitive in a totally alkaline estrogen-deprived vagina (test kits available at drug store).  Already have a heart condition_ so dont need the problems with taking hormones.  If Flagyl doesn't work against the bacteria (and amoebas)_ I'm demanding Floxin or Cipro which are kick-azz in my experience for bacteria.  Just can't need it within 6 months of having used it_ so I'd hope I wouldn't need it again soon.  All I know is_ this BV had hardly any discharge_ just felt sticky and itchy in spite of washing frequently_ I thought maybe it was yeast_ did over the counter yeast meds (failed) then medicated douches_  then things went nuts and pain set in.  EVERYTHING in that area hurts_ like the olden days of the first day of a bad cramping menstrual cycle.  Menopause just blows big time.  P.S.  Was desperate in using the medicated douches_ but douching can cause further spread of the bacteria from what I read so this might be PID.  Sigh.",F,58,7  days,1/5/2010,Flagyl
924, 4, Intestinal Parasites,First few days intestinal symptoms greatly subsided.  Headache in the afternoons.  Thought it was smooth sailing.  By day 6 giant anxiety attack.  Crying and feeling like there was no hope.  Stomach totally upset and bad diarrhea.  Had to go home from work.,Thank you everyone for you comments; they help.  Couldn't understand why I was suddenly in such dark mood and weeping and wailing.  I know Flagyl helped my condition so I'm thankful for that.  The side effects are severe for me at this time; I'm having a love/ hate relationship with this drug.,F,50,6  days,1/4/2010,Flagyl
925, 3, bacterial vaginosis,Tired_ dragging_ out of it_ eyes feel like closing_ hard to do any work.,I felt better overall before I started taking this medicine and I have just gotten through day 2. Before_ just one part of my body felt bad but now my entire body is sluggish and tired. I hope it does not continue to be like this the entire 7 days. I am taking 2 pills per day.,F,39,2  days,1/3/2010,Flagyl
926, 4, H-Pylori (post-gastric ulcer),completely unexpected depression towards the end of the 14 day_ 4x per day treatment (along with Tetracycline_ Protonix and Bismuth); crying (and I never cry_ as it wastes good money on contact lenses that are ruined by tears). No gastric problems noted_ as I take it with food. Just a lot of inconvenient and worsening emotional reactions.,"Flagyl plus Tetracycline did rid me of the horrible spasms that felt like a heart attack_ allowing me to drive and to work without passing out. I'm a doctor_ however_ and knew there was some chance of ""mood change"" with Flagyl...I guess I thought I was immune_ knowing this ahead of time. My kids are so worried; the last two days_ all I do is isolate_ plot ways to resign my job (it seems so unbearably stressful now; perhaps a drug effect)_ and cry. Quite uncharacteristic of me. I have no energy_ have lost 8 pounds without trying_ and just feel like giving up. It helps to see that others have experienced this. My last Flagyl was yesterday; maybe I'm not giving it enough time to clear my system. Thanks everyone for sharing. I'm a young-looking 55 year old. You'd never know I'm in such a funk_ just by looking at me. But all I can do right now is watch sad movies and ponder career changes!",F,55,15  days,1/2/2010,Flagyl

Frequent urination and restlessness.,I am taking this for BV. I have to take 2 250mg tablets 2x a day for 7 days. I am on day 4 and I have seen no results. I still have vaginal itching and a little burning. My skin is so dry and I still have discharge_ but no smell or anything.

General Ill feeling the first few days as it does it job then back to a normal feeling after about 5 days,This is not the first time taking this drug.  What I have found is always take with some form of food_ helps relieve the nauseous feeling.  Sleep and water is the next biggest thing.  I also take Dan-Active (pharmacist recommended even after the recent findings that has been reported.) Along with this and find the combination to work.   I agree that this is a harsh drug that is out there_ but when it works for you there is no comparable drug out there.,M,41,15  days,12/31/2009Email,Flagyl

I take Flagyl three times a day and had heard that it would be bad but went into it with a positive outlook.  Im so jittery. I feel like I have been drinking espressos all day. It is true misery.  They will not allow me to stop taking it either. If you can avoid it all costs. Dont take this antibiotic. There has to be an alternative,F,27,2  days,12/30/2009,Flagyl

I am belching_ passing gas_ and using the bathroom more than I ever have.  I read that taking acidophilus will help with the digestive problems that may occur from taking anti-biotics.

I am taking Florastor and live acidophilis twice a day and I will for a very long time.  I am so afraid of the C-Diff coming back after I stop the Flagyl.  I pray it won't because although the C-Diff was awful_ the side affects from the Fagyl are difficult to live with as well_ and I've heard that Vanco is prohibitively expensive.  Please be careful when taking antiobiotics.  I contracted C-Diff from taking Ceftin after a supposed sinus infection.  Why don't docs culture you for a sinus infection anymore?  I was put on a broad spectrum antiobiotic without the suggestion that I take probiotics with it_ and I ended up debilitated with C-Diff for over a week wondering what the heck was wrong with me until I googled my symptoms and was asked on WebMD whether or not I had taken antiobiotics in the last 6 weeks.

This really helped me decrease the discomfort.For mouth taste:  not much helps here.  Butterscotch hard candies are the best for me_  though the effect doesn't last long_  but it is good to have a better taste in mouth_ even for awhile.,F,70,20  days,12/16/2009,Flagyl

941, 1, bacterial infection,unexplainable mood swings_ crying_ dizziness_ irritability_ nauseau_ and zombie-like feeling overall.,Within a couple hours of taking it I felt like I was suffering from a huge hangover. I couldnt think or walk straight. I flipped out at everything_ and when I couldn't vent out my frustration(over nothing) I just cried and cried. To not feel what the medicine was doing to me I tried to sleep as much as I could.  I didn't even feel human. I was supposed to take it for 10 days (only got through 2)_ but after just having a baby and still being at home I decided there was no way I could handle that with all the horrible side effects.  For someone that can handle the serious side effects more power to you..but I would definitely not recommend it. After being off of it for 24 hours I feel like a brand new person. My dr switched me to doxycycline_ which does not have side effects as severe.,F,27,2  days,12/10/2009Email,Flagyl
942, 3, Crohn's Disease,Dryness of mouth and skin(which caused my acne to become worse). Severe Energy drain. Trouble focusing. Paranoia and anxiety.,I started taking 500mg twice a day for a month. It helped greatly with the inflamation in my lower colon/rectum. I couldn't take the serious side-effects though_ so I dropped down to 250mg twice a day and the terrible side-effects have much improved. The side-effects were so bad that I couldn't consentrate at all at work and I thought I just needed more sleep_ but I was getting 8-9 hours of sleep a night. Once I switched to the lower dose_ I felt like a new person. I need to be on this long-term to manage my disease or elese my intestines become swollen.,M,23,30  days,12/8/2009,Flagyl
943, 1, Possible IBD in my Cat,Not me but my cat was prescribed Flagyl. Within three days she was so down and out I took her back to vet and her kidney values were so high_ she had developed ARF. Only three days prior_ they were normal. She stayed in hospital for three days and fortunately levels went back to normal. Vet does not think it was the drug_ but isn't sure either. I know it was the drug. No other explanation. She will not be taking this stuff again. \,Even after a surgical biopsy for my cat_ and if IBD is the definite diagnosis_ I will not allow the administration of Flagyl to her. Other_ safer drugs exist that will accomplish the same things without these frightening side effects.,F,12,3  days,12/5/2009,Flagyl

Nine days of bloody mucous stools stopped with second dose.  Wonderful drug.,Don't wait for the lab tests to confirm C Diff; start yourself on 2 servings of Stonyfield yogurt everyday and continue thru your prescription with Flagyl.  Eat a small meal first_ bury the pill in applesauce or yogurt on a spoon_ swipe the spoon in your mouth and follow with at least 8 oz of water. I took the pills at 6 am_ 2 pm and 10 pm everyday.DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL. FINISH THE SCRIPT.,F,50,14  days,12/3/2009,Flagyl
945, 4, Post-miscarriage Endometritis,Metallic taste_ dehydration_ dark urine,I read this website before I had to take flagyl and was extremely apprehensive. Luckily_ I haven't had as many side effects as others_ as this drug will affect different systems in varying degrees. I would advise avoiding the taste of the pill and having candies or lozenges if the metallic taste won't go away. I have also been drinking 1-2 microbrew beers without any problems.,F,29,5  days,12/3/2009,Flagyl
946, 4, giardia,Apart from typical wobbly stomach from anti biotics and dry/sore eyes I had no side effects for a few days_ but then trying to get alot done with little sleep I found myself getting realllllllly messed up like never before. I wasn't even sure who I was once day when I woke up for the first 10 minutes_ very similar feeling to when you wake up in the night with bad food poisoning. Anyway I came good :). I also had some very disturbing pains in my head while playing tennis during the course_ I got really thirsty and got a little dizzy and had to take it easy for the rest of the match,The side effects are no worse and infact not as bad as having giardia and I've been living with that for 10 years_ so a few days of this to fix it is nothing.

You can buy these in capsule form at any pharmacy. Taking them constantly helped with all of the symptoms I had. Also_ just from research eating foods that are high in fiber will also help to increase the amount of healthy bacteria in your stomach which will help decrease the symptoms.,F,21,7  days,11/27/2009,Flagyl

951, 2, SIBO - Bacterial Infection,fatigue_ lethargy_ extreme muscle soreness_ skin redness_ headache_ insomnia_ chills_ night sweats_ sensitivity to light_ eye soreness_ flu-like symptoms,I am on my second dose of Flagyl for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).  The first was in late July and I experienced horrible side effects.  My doctor urged me to continue the treatment since she felt this was the best solution to treat my condition.  She is a highly recommended gastroenterologist so I am trusting her opinion.  Unfortunately_ the 250mg 3x/day for 10 days was not strong enough.  I was dreading the thought of having to go on this again_ but am now (after several months of trying to rid my problem through natural supplements) on my second round at a higher dosage_ 500mg 3x/day.  I am on day 3 of a 10 day treatment and am still experiencing severe symptoms.  I am also taking a high dose probiotic with the medication which she recommended for 30 days.  I am trying to help my system cleanse the toxifying effects by drinking a lot of water_ drinking milk thistle tea_ eating healthy foods_ and exercising.  Considering I sit on the couch all day due to extreme lethargy it takes every ounce of energy for me to go to the gym but I think it may be helping me.  I have done very light cardio workouts like walking on the treadmill for 30mins to keep my circulation going and stretching to help with the extreme muscle soreness.  I am normally very active so this is debilitating_ but if it cures my chronic stomach problems_ it just might be worth it.  This site is very helpful because at least I know I am not the only one who is experiencing awful symptoms.,F,37,3  days,11/23/2009,Flagyl

He developed diverticulitis and went to an urgent care center (no insurance) which was closing in 15 minutes. They listened to his description of symptoms_ wrote the perscription for Cipro and Flagyl_ and ran him off with a cheery ""Don't worry_ it won't upset your stomach! Just don't drink alcohol!"" No mention of side effects beyond that_ and we figured if it didn't even upset your stomach_ it must be fairly safe and mild. He was on them for a little over a week_ and it's been Hell. After 7 days of the previously mentioned symptoms_ he called them and they cut the Cipro and switched him to another_ milder antibiotic_ but he was still the living dead with the Flagyl (with gastrointestinal and mental distress)and two days later he called them and said he quit_ he'd rather die of diverticulosis than be like that. The whole time the doctors would answer our calls like we were bothering them and he was just making it up or overdramatizing. It wan't until I got online that I realized how dangerous this stuff can be for some people. I guess it works fairly safely for a lot of people_ but others like the folks here just go crazy and the Doctors need to realize it CAN and DOES happen and show some sensitivity and intelligence. Doctors aren't perfect - feel free to question! This Dr. initially wrote a perscription for a pennicillin-based drug (to replace Cipro)_ even though in his chart it list that as an all",M,52,9  days,11/18/2009,Flagyl
953, 4, c.diff,This is the most nastiest vile drug I have ever taken. The taste in my mouth was almost unbearable. Had terrible heartburn and loss of appetite. Also developed a white furry tongue and sore throat and mouth. Was sick for 2 week between the c.diff and side effects from the flagyl.,The only good thing about the medicine is that after suffering from bloody diarrhea for several days the flagyl did work in about 3 days. I hope I never need to take it again!!!!,F,50,7  days,11/17/2009,Flagyl
954, 3, Bv,Nausea_ drepression_ lack of interest_ mood swings_ vivid dreams_ diarrhea_ dark urine_ decreased appitite_ zombie like throughout the day.,This drug gave me the most vivid dreams. My mood swings were out of control. I cried more than usual. I had no desire to do anything except sit and watch tv. I would be hungry one minute and have no intention for food the next. Helped with my ADD bc it made me more mellow and focused on one thing at a time. Hope it helps with the infection because I don't feel real at this point.,F,21,4  days,11/7/2009,Flagyl

I am a very upbeat_ happy person and this was very unusual.  I asked a few friends_ all of whom of said their friends and family got very depressed and sick.

I thought that I was dying.  I started getting a head ache and dry mouth about 30 min after inserting the gel.  My mouth was so dry that I couldn't feel my throat.  I was told by my doctors that the gel shouldn't do this_ but believe me it did.  I am still having side effects 6 days later.  The doctors just keep saying that it is out of my system_ but you could have fooled me.  I don't advise anyone to take this.,F,38,1  days,10/25/2009,Flagyl

All so severe that I really thought I was becoming a hypochondriac.,Took Cipro and Flagyl together_ 500 mg each 2x day for 14 days. Took Percocets to deal with the nasty side effects of the combination of the two. Well this is my 3rd attempt this year to rid of this bacterial infection in my female anatomy from a ocean swim. I stopped the medication twice because of the nasty side effects and got the bacterial infection back in my uterus this time. Honestly_ I would have rather had the stupid infection take over my entire body than deal with this medicine. I went to the emergency room twice because of the side effects- I thought I was dying from appendix bursting or had blood poisoning. The second time to the emergency room_ the female doctor told me that flagyl is an evil drug that works_ but it's side effects are horrible. She basically said_ suck it up_ take some pain medications (Percocets) to deal with the side effects and finish the infection medicine to get rid of the bacterial infection before it goes into my blood for real. The stuff put me into tears because I was so sick of being sicker.,F,41,14  days,10/23/2009,Flagyl

963, 3, C Diff,Brown urine_ lethargy then insomnia_ VERY shaky legs & arms_ constant nausea_total lack of appetite_ dizziness and confusion_ oral thrush_ metalic taste in mouth_ sore muscles like I just did a mega-workout.,HORRIBLE medication!  Doctor wasn't even aware of the side effects on pamphlet rec'd with meds.  SO glad to read about others with weakness/shaky legs.  Started a couple days after taking it.  After 2 weeks_ can't even put on my pants without sitting down. Dr. told me it was not related to the medication.  One tip: if you have to take it and can swallow a large pill_ I wrapped my pills in a very thin coating of cheese (making sure no pill was sticking out). Not only did it eliminate the gagging & taste_ but it went down much smoother. Not sure yet if it cleared up the C Diff_ but I would NOT take this medication again. Had to miss 2 weeks+ of work simply due to the side effects of this vile medication.,F,45,14  days,10/19/2009Email,Flagyl
964, 3, pid,Constant nausea_ loss of appetite_ lethargy_ severe diahrrea_ sharp lower abdonimal pains.,The first day I took the meds I had that metallic taste n it made me even more nauseas. But what I've been doing to avoid that is chew up my food and shove the pill in the middle of my food..then swallow the food w the pill n the middle and this will avoid tasting the pill and the metallic taste ;) It works for me. I was prescribed 500mg 3times a day for 10 days. The side effects are horrible. I thought it was just me. And for the user that said we're all exaggerating_ no maybe you are one of the few lucky ones who don't experience these side effects. I called my pharmacist n dr concerned because on day 3 I was throwing up and then again 3days later. I'm really small so maybe it has effected me a lot due to my size. But I have to agree with most of you. Bad side effects. I always feel nauseated during the day n can't throw up :(,F,22,10  days,10/17/2009,Flagyl
965, 1, pouchitis,terrible neuropathy in feet,I was prescribed metronidazole (flagyl) for pouchitis.  I was on it for a year and a half with no side effects. Then my toes and feet started tingling and became VERY sensitive.  I had no idea this could have been a side effect since I had been taking the meds for so long.  I went to 2 doctors that couldn't figure out the probem. The 3rd doctor I went to said the neuropathy was from the flagyl and to stop taking it immediately.  So I have been taking flagyl for 6 months while having the neuropathy.  I just hope it is reversible because it is extremely uncomfortable.,M,30,2  years,10/17/2009,Flagyl

967, 1, Suspected Diverticulitis,Major nausea_ no appetite_ dark urine_ anxiety,I took 500mg X 3 times a day for 2.5 days for a suspected diverticulitis attack. This was absolutely the worst experience of have ever had with a prescription drug.  Major Nausea all the time that would not stop 24/7.  I thought I was going crazy.  My anxiety kicked in and that was hell too.  This was a terrible experience for me that I would not wish on any other person.  Thank god for my family sticking with me.  The nausea was the worst but what was almost as bad was that it took 5-6 days after I stopped the medication to actually feel right again.  Listen_ if you need to take this medication_ you should do it but be aware that it is a serious drug for serious infections.  Not everyone will have the same reaction.  I am just glad to have found this board to be able to understand that I was not alone.  You are not either.  Best of luck to everyone and thanks for your comments.  They helped me through a very trying two weeks.,M,40,3  days,10/16/2009,Flagyl
968, 5, gastrointestinal infection,lightheadedness,A follow up on using Flagyl. Don't drink alcohol or use any products containing alcohol. I'm also prescribed Testim_ a gel_ which I must apply to my skin. It contains alcohol. I didn't notice a reaction the first three mornings but I noticed it after that.  Some people don't have this reaction with alcohol but I sure did--mild to severe Nausea. I'm also starting wonder if the lightheadedness is another result of using this alcohol-based gel.,M,47,8  days,10/15/2009,Flagyl

970, 5, gastrointestinal infection,Lightheadedness,"I was prescribed 2x500mg_ one pill in the evening and one in the morning. This stuff is powerful and works very well. Many symptoms that people complain about here on this site are actually a result of ""Herx"" or die-off. In my case_ besides some minor lightheadedness_ I suffered no effects until about 48 hours after taking this anti-biotic. At that point I started feeling really ill_ nausea_ headaches_ weakness_ fatigue_ anxiety_ and insomnia that night. The next morning I felt much better until the following evening when I started experiencing headaches and nausea. Each day has gotten progressively better. This stuff works. Stick with it. When you start getting ill that simply means the anti-biotic is killing the bad stuff in you. Oh yeah_ take time off of work for this stuff. You need to rest and drink lots of water to help detox your body. And don't forget to take a probiotic during or immediately after using any antibiotic.",M,47,4  days,10/9/2009,Flagyl

I can't eat_ my stomach aches and I feel like I want to throw up all the time. My heart was beating so fast last night that I thought I was going to die.

Couldn't stand the side effects so contacted doctor after a week of pill form and he said to reduce it down to 1 per day.

Kept telling doctors she could'nt move any of her extremeties. They wanted her to keep taking it. Said she only had a virus. After a week of harassing them that it wasn't a virus_ they ran bloodwork. She had serum sickness from Flagyl!! After being off the meds for over a month_ her level of serum sickness is 47(normal is 0-13)it was 69. Her doctor's don't want to do anything for her except continue to check her bloodwork monthly. Please let me know if this happened to anyone else!! I don't know what to do for her or how to get this sh** out of her system. She only took 10 pills out of the 30. If I had listened to the doctors and kept giving her the pills_ she could've died.

My doc got his new book in so I am on TINIDAZOLE  (500MG -- 4 PILLS ONCE A DAY FOR 3 DAYS) --look it up on wikipedia.  widely used in europe.  Tinidazole is FDA approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis_[1] giardiasis and amebiasis. A large body of clinical data exists to support its use as a treatment for amoebae_ giardia and vaginal trichomona_ just like metronidazole. Tinidazole may be a therapeutic alternative in the setting of metronidazole tolerance.Tinidazole may also be used to treat or prevent a variety of bacterial infections_ including Helicobacter pylori.Outside the United States_ it has been widely used to treat bacterial vaginosis.[2][3]Now_ I was so paranoid because of the flagyl experience_ i mixed all four pills in honey_ scouped them in a teaspoon and swallowed all of them -- then chased them down with 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream.  Then_ throughout the day_ I would just do a swig of honey and heavy whipcream.  (I'm eating bite size tostitos when i get hungry_ but the honey and whipping cream really curbs my appitite). I still have two more days left_ and I will let you know how it goes!  I slept great last night too!No fowl taste_ a little bloating (baking soda and water did great)_ no headaches_ no nausea_ etc etc.  Of course there's diahrrea involved but who cares after what i went thru with that nasty toxic flagyl!,F,54, ,9/4/2009,Flagyl

This is about the 4th time I have had to take this drug for reoccurring BV. I used to use the gel because the first time I used flagyl via capsule form_ I was extremely sick. Doctor advised that the gel isn't as effective as the tablet_ so I went back to capsule form. Only thing that I find difficult to tolerate is the metal taste which starts after the 3rd day of treatment. I won't drink water because it's horrible. I take the pills with every meal_ mid-meal. If you take it after the meal_ it may not be swallowed properly and then you'll taste it when the capsule dissolves. Other than the extreme gas and bloating_ i'm doing ok.

I was so upset about it i called the doc and the pharmacy to advise them of the deadly side affects.  it was like I injested hydrochloric acid or drano. I cannot believe this is on the market.  Asked my doc for something else_ he had to order a book_ probably a pdr or something_ to find an alternative (if there is one!) I've been looking but there might not be one.  should find out this week sometime..,F,54,3  days,8/25/2009,Flagyl

A massive oral thrush and a vaginal yeast infection_ onset at end of 10-day course on Flagyl.,Flagyl worked to clear up my uterine abscess_ so for that I am grateful.  But I didn't realize how oral thrush is a common side effect of Flagyl.  It has taken me longer to get rid of the thrush than it did the abscess!!  I learned too late about that connection_ and have been on 3 different prescribed treatments for the thrush over the past 3 weeks.  Monistat-7 cleared up the vaginal yeast OK_ but I am still on Nystatin Swish and Swallow 4 times a day for the oral thrush.  In day 10 of that now_ it appears FINALLY to be working.

These comments did help but as a reader not knowing what i was taking this site made me scared to take them. my advice would be to suck it up and be done with it. you are only going to make it worse by stressing about it. your doctor probably didnt warn u about all the side effects because he/she didnt want to scare you prematurely. they are strong drugs so there are going to be side effects.,F,22,7  days,8/20/2009,Flagyl

I could only finish 5 days and switched to vancomycin .  I think I would have died by day 14 of flagyl. I felt like I was going to just die at any moment until this drug was out of my system for a few days.  I would recommend vanco instead of this poison.

1013, 4, Diverticulitis,nausea_ heart palpitations_ dry mouth_ stomach cramps_ diarrhea_ tiredness,I am taking flagyl (500 mg dose) three times a day for 10 days along with Cipro.  I am at day 5.  My symptoms for diverticulitis are disappearing.  I believe the meds are working and are willing to put up with the symptoms to clear up the infection.  One important tip:  TAKE WITH PRO-BIOTICS!  When you are taking an antibiotic that is this strong_ you need to replace the good antibodies that your body normally carries.  I had c-diff two years ago and was sick for over 4 months.  It all started with bronchitis which I couldn't shake.  Taking the strong meds brought on the c-diff.  Once I started studying this all on the internet and found out about pro-biotics_ I immediately went out and got them.  I am convinced that the pro-biotics cleared it all up.  So_ once this diverticulitis was diagnosed and I started on the meds._ I immediately started with the pro-biotics.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TAKE THEM TOGETHER!  Can't stress that enough!  Once my antibiotics are done in another 5 days_ I will continue on the pro-biotics for another month to insure that I am helping my body replace them.,F,50,10  days,8/17/2009,Flagyl
1014, 4, Mild Diverticulitis,Nausea_ severe lethargy/sleepiness_ food/drink taste changes_ diarrhea_ anxiety and mood changes_ pill tastes bad for a while,I developed mild diverticulitis with lower abdominal pain.  I was prescribed Cipro 2x daily and Flagyl 3x daily.  I assume my side effects were from the Flagyl_ as I have taken Cipro before without a problem.  The drug(s) worked well - pain gone in about 48 hours_ so no complaints there.  Diverticulitis was a surprise because I eat a good diet and exercise.  In any event_ this is a tough drug to deal with - I feel like I have the flu - very run down_ want to sleep all day_ general malaise.  Hopefully these symptoms stop quickly after treatment ends (I'm halfway through).,M,28,10  days,8/16/2009,Flagyl

Diarrhea finally did stop but will be glad when my last day comes.  500mg x 14 days.  I am a nurse and we always treated with vanco but Dr told me Flagyl was the first antibiotic of choice now.  If cdiff comes back I am going to run not walk to get Vanco.  Oh when I called the pharmacy about the brown urine he laughed an told me to play the lottery b/c only one in 100_000 get brown urine as a side effect.  I am so glad I found this site.,Patients should be warned about horrible side effects better.

I've also had nausea (not terribly severe) though I have taken it with food.  Feeling a little ""out of it"" but that's not too severe either_ and actually many medications make me feel that way.  Have avoided alcohol like the plague after the pharmacist told me that even a little would make me violently ill (he said it has the same stuff in it that is in Antabuse (sp?)_ which they give to alcoholics to make them completely miserable if they drink any alcohol at all...)  My doctor did not mention any of this to me_ and I had never heard of Metronidazole before_ so I just figured it was similar the other antibiotics I have taken over the years.

I thought it would go away_ until the liquidity did not cease after 2 weeks. Doctors discount it as a possibility_ as their experiences say it only takes a week or two - I disagree. Onset diarrhea from antibiotics may to be blame as opportunistic organisms may have been colonizing.I've spoken to others that have had very few side effects_ but it was their first time on Flagyl for other issues. In my case_ tests were negative for C. Diff_ cultures_ and WBCs in the stool.

Had been sick 8 days before they diagnosed and started me on Flagyl 500mg 3 per day for 10 days (2 days left). Maybe it helped that I immediately started taking probiotics with Flagyl: Acidophilus 120mg twice/day and now switched to Sacro-B (Saccharomyces boulardii) 250mg twice/day.

Take your meds like you are supposed to and you will be fine; the sides are normal and happen with all drugs; they can be negative_ but it's better than the alternative of being sick with a serious problem like Diverticulitis.

No diarrhea I think because I take Benefiber which really prevents that in general.  The fatigue has really slammed me today.  I am hoping the fatigue could indicate the die off of the BV and any other undesirable bacteria.  The pills are quite bitter_ but no problem if you swallow them with a mouthful of well-chewed food.

Doctors are always in such a hurry to hustle you in and out_ that many patients fail to ask or the doctor fails to inform on the variety of side effects. Follow their guidelines on this drug; do not drink alcohol with it or you are asking for trouble! Refrain from excessive sun exposure or it will make you sick to your stomach!

However only a followup stool test can ascertain whether flagyl totally eliminated my c-diff infection.  Side effects (chronic nausea_ stabbing stomach pain_ gut pain_ soft stools and metallic taste) were horrible to say the least and remained for several days after my last dose. The metallic taste remained for a week after last dose.  However_ flagyl reversed my chronic constipation_ bloating and gas as well as flu-like symptoms (probably from c-diff). If I ever have to treat c-diff again_ I might choose vancomycin. I'm now taking a 7 day high dose probiotic treatment (127 live 'good' bacteria per dose) to replace any good bacteria which flagyl killed.

1048, 1, Bacterial Infection,Extreme dizziness_ shortness of breath_ tightness in chest_ nausea_ disorientated and confused_ anxious,I felt tight chested and short of breath after one day of taking this medication_ not knowing what was causing this saw my gp who said it was probably just from having the bacterial infection_ later that day I was taken to hospital by ambulance with chest pains. Nothing showed up in ecg and was sent home the next day I was with my gp again as the seemed worse and I was starting to worry that it may be the medication_ whilst I was there I became so dizzy and nauseas_ cold and clammy and then passed out_ I was once again taken to hospital by ambulance. Whilst in hospital I felt disorientated and anxious. I have never felt so dizzy in my life and could not believe I could feel so nauseas without vomitting. I felt a little better after 24 of not taking tablets and discharged myself_ however as the bacterial infection had now grown from not taking the tablets whilst in hospital I took another and sure enough within an hour I was struggling to breath once again! Never Again will I take this medication_ in fact I'm terrified now of taking any antibiotic!,F,37,2  days,6/16/2009Email,Flagyl
1049, 4, BV,No problems what so ever.,I was scared to death after reading all these crazy reviews. I had no issues with the medication. At least nothing I noticed that I would say was caused by Flagyl and certainly nothing to interrupt my life. My body is very senstive to meds and I did just fine. I guess each person is different and depending on the infection the side effects may be worse. I didn't even know I had a bacterial infection until my doc told me so mine wasn't that bad to being with.,F,26,7  days,6/13/2009,Flagyl

Make sure to have a tasteful drink as water won't diminish the taste very well.Secondly_ the first 2 days taking Flagyl_ I showed no side effects and was fine. By day 3 and 4 (I'm on day 4) I've had trouble sleeping because of stomach cramps_ severe headaches and upset stomach.Tonight_ I shall test the effects of alcohol...,F,20,7  days,6/13/2009,Flagyl

I also have a bad taste in my mouth.  Just feeling ""ill"" and sort of fluish.  I plan to take another dose this evening_ but I am not sure if I am going to be able to finish the prescription through day ten.  I was a little constipated the first couple of days_ but now the symptoms for which I was prescribed the medication have returned--and that is loose stools.",I am on the generic pill_ and this is the NASTIEST tasting stuff I have ever had to choke down.  I am to take it three times a day; it begins to dissolve immediately in my mouth and leaves a horribly bitter aftertaste that lasts for minutes.  Thus far_ the best thing to take it with for me has been chocolate milk.  That has helped to hide some of the taste_ but this is a big pill. I can feel the granules in my mouth as the tablet disintegrates on my tongue.

I will NEVER take it again.  My entire outlook on life changed and the depression was unbearable (I have no history of depression_ but have a history of anxiety).

I am taking 500mg twice a day for 7 days. On days one and two I felt fine and had very few symptoms. By day three all of my BV symptoms were gone_ but I began getting severe headaches and I started to feel shaky and fatigued. On days 4 and 5 I started having severe stomach cramps that were more severe if I laid down_ and found myself constantly tapping my leg out of anxiety. I am currently on day 6 and am having trouble sleeping and am still very anxious. I am not sure though if I am anxious as a direct result of the medication or because I am constantly thinking about how much time is left until I have to take my next dose. I was 4 hours late taking my most recent dose and was feeling very well_ until I then took the dose. Thirty minutes later I felt irritable_ shaky_ began having cramps... I felt restless and anxious all over again. I also began experiencing Vertigo. If I move from A to B too quickly_ I lose my balance and have to catch it. I also feel dizzy when noticing movement in my peripheral. If I need this medication again_ I will ask for a substitute.

My arms and legs went numb and I couldn't stand up. I called my mom crying_ freaking out! I stopped taking flagyl and the side effects eventually went away. Oh_ and don't think you're not at risk if you've taken it before with no serious side effects because I've taken it many times over the years and nothing happened til now.,I was just prescribed flagyl again_ after telling the doctor about the effects last time.

I thought I may be having a heart problem as my heart started racing and I developed shortness of breath after taking the medication for three days. It was a strong dose of 750mg three times a day and I am a petite woman_ perhaps a lower dose wouldn't have caused such aweful reaction. I discontinued after the first three days.

I also feel slightly ""disconnected""_ and very tired.",These were prescribed to prevent any possible uterine infection from a D&C; however_ they don't seem to react all that great to the other two meds I'm on (for example_ they've amplified the tiredness I get from the nifedipine I take).

I swallowed it with some water and it went straight down. I didn't taste any metallic taste at all. Everyone that hates taking this medicine as much as I do needs to try this.

Just finished my prescription this morning and I am praying that these side effects go away quickly. I feel that I could've gone to work with the c. diff and should've taken off of work while on Flagyl_ had I known the effects would be this uncomfortable.

Flagyl is a brutal drug but it did stop the diarrhea and reduce the infection. This is not the best drug for blastocystis but it took 3 weeks to get the lab results back from Metametrix Labs to find out what I had and meanwhile I needed treatment to keep from dying from diarrhea and being unable to eat. So the doctor gave me Cipro (500 mg/day) and Flagyl (500 mg 2x/day) to cover all bases.

1078, 5, protozoan infection,Horribly bitter taste_ and after a few days_ change of taste all the time. But it can be masked with tasty foods and change of taste stops when you stop the medication.,I am tempted to believe that most people who have side effects from this drug have either taken alcohol not knowing that it's present in many products_ or they had a really bad infection and their side effects were actually die-off symptoms. I had no side effects from this medication and thank GOD that we have Flagyl to rid us of things that made my life absolute misery!Some doctors report mixed results with Flagyl. I think that their patients didn't eat proper foods while taking it. To maximise the effect of Flagyl_ one has to eat low GI foods_ no sugar or starches of any kind_ and has to stay on such diet for at least a couple of months after the medication. This medication is tough on liver so you don't want to burden it with junk. Lots of water_ sugar-free lemonade_ salads_ chicken and wild cought salmon are your best friends. Stay away from peanuts and spinach.Also_ for protozoan infections_ one needs to take a luminal amoebicide like Humatin (Paromomycin)_ as Flagyl (Metronidazole) is a systemic antibiotic_ and it doesn't reach intestines_ it's absorbed right away.,M,40,15  days,4/7/2009,Flagyl

By the end of the second day_ my urine had darkened and I was starting to feel waves of nausea but I am tough so I just decided to ride it out. The third day_ I woke to slight tingling in my feet and one of my hands had fallen asleep (it quickly ""woke up"")_ but I took my morning dose anyway. By mid-day_ my hands had also started intermittently tingling_ just like my feet. I couldn't get a hold of my doctor so I called my pharmacist and he told me that the tingling should only occur after long-term use--that perhaps it was the power of suggestion in the drug info sheet that was making me think I felt tingling. So I took my afternoon dose. By the early evening_ I felt EXTREME nausea_ and the tingling had become constant and somewhat painful (like prickly/burning)_ and it had traveled up into my calves and thighs.

First time for a week with Cipro (500mg 2xday)_ this time for a week with Levaquin(500mg 1xday).  First time_ nausea was bad.  This time_ using Zophran before every pill and has kept nausea at bay so far.  Started in hospital where it was IV'ed and went to pill form one day ago.  As per a suggestion from this board_ I bury the pill in a spoon of applesause and just quickly swallow.  Helps tremendously with bitter taste. Also staying super hydrated.,Not exactly sure how I got so sick as I'm a pretty healthy person.  Started with treatment for a possible intestional infection that has now blossomed into colitis.  I hope this second round of drugs gets rid of whatever.  I am on a low residue diet and doing fine thus far.  Was just in hospital (first time ever) for 4 nights due to severe dehydration from diarrhea.  Checking for c-diff but hospital messed up the labs so at this point_ what I'm hearing is that it probably isn't c-diff.  Now that I've started the meds_ it would be hard to test.

Her teacher also noticed that she was quite lethargic in class_ which was certainly not typical. She has stopped the flagyl for the last two days_ but still is not acting right.  I am so afraid that this has caused some type of neurological damage.  She even mentioned during the last week that her hands feel tingly. I would not recommend this medication for children or perhaps anyone. I am sick with worry_ and guilty that she did not even need to be on this medication.,F,43,7  days,1/8/2009,Flagyl

I've been given Phenergan to combat the initial nausea for the first few days. The only advice I can give is to force down some of the BRAT diet even if you don't want to eat.

The only other side effect were minor hot flashes and definitely feeling tired within 1-2 hours of taking the pill.  To mask the horrible taste I ate yogurt and usually a probiotic drink (Dan Active).  I personally suggest eating yogurt with L. Acidophilus to minimize the risk of ddeveloping a yeast infection while taking any antibiotic.  I personally think drinking a probiotic drink will also minimize the risk of GI troubles (coats your stomach too).  Reading about everyone's troubles with this drug led me to call my doctor and see if there was an alternative I could take -- the other issue for me was not being able to drink alcohol -- and he prescribed me Clindesse vaginal cream.

At times I felt my body may literally shut down or I might have a seizure with how bad my twitching and shaking was.  No matter how tired I was I couldn't sleep and the smallest noise would jerk me away in panic. I couldn't eat to save my life. Every time I put food in my mouth I wanted to gag.

He started out on Flagyl and a different antibiotic (augmentin_ I think)_ and had some nausea and cramping_ not too bad.  But that combo wasn't clearing the diverticulitis infection.  So they switched him to Cipro plus Flagyl_ apparently the magic combo for diverticulitis.  But - the combination of the Cipro and Flagyl leads to AWFUL side effects_ particularly the loss of mental function.  It's like watching someone develop Alzheimers in a couple of days_ and there is almost nothing I can do to help.  The infection is clearing up_ but now that he could start eating again he is too nauseous or forgets to eat.  That's after two weeks on only jello and soy milk.

I have three pills left_ and as I'm reading the posts here_ I am just now realizing that the side effects(although minor)that I feel are probably from the medication. I think I can attribute the ""jumpy"" feeling to the medication. I can eat with no problem_ but have noticed that no food really tastes that good. As far as the bad taste_ the pill starts to dissolve on your tongue very quickly_ so I found that if I put it on the very back of my tongue_ and swallow it with water very fast_ it doesn't have a chance to dissolve_ and I don't get the bad taste. Overall_ it has taken care of the problem. Glad I took it_ but glad it's almost over with. This website has been helpful to me.",F,50,21  days,11/4/2008Email,Flagyl

I thought I was cured.  About 3 weeks later_ I got what I thought was intestinal flu.  It would come and go.  When the mucous bowel movements started (psedudomembranous colitis) I knew this was not normal.  I remembered that I had off and on problems since I was on the Clindamycin.  I looked it up and there is was...I called the dentist and told him I needed Flagyl.  I was on it 8 days and my lab sample is now negative.  You can get very sick from C-diff and even though Flagyl has side effects- it is the best choice for this.  I found I needed a full meal with each pill.  I found that putting the pill in a spoonful of yogurt or applesauce and then swallow it all at once was the best way.  I have red excoriation 4 inches in diameter around my anus even tho I didn't have much diarrhea-just fierce urges to go and feel like you are turning inside out.

I haven't started it yet so I can't say for sure_ but most of the negative symptoms described by people taking the drug could be the result of a ""die-off effect"". When large numbers of bad bacteria and other micro-organisms are suddenly killed_ large amounts of toxins are released into the blood stream and could cause a whole host of symptoms including sever stomach pains/diarreha_ nausea depression and other severe flu-like symptoms. Therefore it may not be the drug itself causing the symptoms rather symptoms are manifesting as a result of a bacterial reaction to the drug.

Just fyi_ am also taking probiotic supplements between doses of Flagyl in an attempt to get my normal fauna back up.  Don't know if it's helping yet_ but cross fingers. Annoyed that cipro & augumentin caused c-diff problem_(also that I had to  yell at dr. to get a sample taken to prove/be treated for c-diff) but grateful there's an option to treat it_ rather than dying on the toilet.

The only thing I have noticed is that the side effects seemed to come at the time I assume the pill would be wearing off (twice a day dose). I'd take the next pill and they'd go away. I didn't notice a metallic taste but it did turn my urine bright orange. A little alarming but not uncomfortable. Mostly I'd describe the minimal side effects I had while on this medication as uncomfortable. Even when I felt disoriented and some cramping/nausea it was more uncomfortable than painful.

However_ it is not always reported as mine was not because it was three months before I was diagnosed and a doctor finally asked what medications I had been taking when the initial symptoms arose.  I was very fortunate to regain almost full use of my right arm.  The improvement began about five months after onset and I continued to regain strength reaching full potential after approximately eitht months.

(And I made sure not to read any of the potential side effects on the literature so I wouldn't be influenced by power of suggestion).,After about the 4th day things got a bit better. The nausea lifted for a few hours_ and even that respite made life livable again.

After talking to my regular doctor and telling her about the side-effects (which really are not as bad as you might think)_ she told me to reduce the dosage to 500mg 3x per day and if the side effects don't go away_ to discontinue the medication.

I was one of the ones blessed with ""severe"" symptoms of Giardia and knew the side effects to Flagyl and assumed nothing could feel as bad as I was feeling. Boy was I wrong. Mornings are ok for me_ but once noon rolls around_ I am so dizzy and just walk around sad and end up just laying in bed. Thank god for a husband who understands that I am sick. I did read on a different website that it is not the Flagyl that is causing the side effects but that its the parasite/bacteria dying off that causes everything. So it might be up in the air.

But 3 weeks after stopping_ I still have muscle weakness and tingling which I never had before taking this med.  I'm a power walker so in good shape.  I also think the dose was way too much for a small person like myself.  I wonder when these symptoms will finally subside.  Many years ago_ I took this in a much smaller dosage with few problems.

I'm also taking another antibiotic so I can't tell which medication is the culprit_ or if perhaps my underlying illness is the problem.  But I can say that since taking it_ I've been extremely nauseous_ fatigued and depressed.  I have no appetite and whenever I do try to eat something_ I feel bloated and full after just a few bites.  Again_ whether this is due to Flagyl or the other medications or the illness are unknown to me but my guess is that it's the flagyl.,,M,56,10  days,4/21/2008,Flagyl

Take in the middle of a light meal.Most of these remarks sound like they are symptoms of people's illness's_ not a side effect of the drug. I've been on Flagyl for nearly 4 weeks for C-diff (and a relapse) with life-threatening dehydration. Not any major problems_ and I am very sensitive to medications.,F,48,28  days,4/18/2008,Flagyl

1207, 5, C. diff.,Slight rash after 13 days,Thank God and modern healthcare for this medicine.  I had a horrible 3 days leading up to my diagnosis and suffered many of the torments described here for several days in the hospital and after I left.  But I ascribe these effects to the horrible C. diff. infection.  The medicine slowly overcame all the cramps_ bowel problems_ fever and body aches associated with a severe bacterial infection.  I would love to see each person posting here state whether they used alcohol during the course of their therapy.  With the exception of known side effects_ including bad taste (so what?)_ peripheral neuropathy_ and some nausea_ I would guess most of the side effects reported here are from ingestion of alcohol during the course of the treatment.  Even small amounts in cough syrups_ Nyquil_ inadvertently swallowed from mouthwash_ and the drinks some of you are surely having would cause many of the severe effects reported here. This is a miracle drug that may have saved my life.   ,M,57,14  days,4/17/2008,Flagyl

I'm intending on finishing up with it since I am almost done. I normally weigh 142 lbs_ I've lost 8 lbs because of the C-Diff and during the flagyl I've lost 3 lbs....no appetite_ hungry but feel too sick to eat.  I would never recommend this to anyone because of the horrid side affects.  It reminds me of when i was pregnant with morning sickness!

1213, 3, Parasites_ C Diff and Bacterium,I am posting this to tell people that after reading these posts regarding Flagyl or Metronidazole and experiencing the same fatigue as many_ I called my pharmacist who said that in actuality the opposite should occur if anything_ meaning Insomina or the inability to sleep.  After that I drove over to my doctor's office to ask her what's up.  She and her assistant who went through the same problems as all of us are explained that it is not the medication but the killing off of the parasites that causes the extreme fatigue.  it is part of the healing process.  In fact_ I was told that sometimes when the parasite first come into the body_ there can be a surge of energy then a levening off.  But when you start killing them off with the meds your body undergoes a dramatic change and thus the fatigue.  I hope I've helped some people.  My doc said I know it's not fun but stick with it.,,F,49,10  days,4/3/2008,Flagyl
1214, 4, infection after root canal,Nausea_ upset stomach_ and loss of appetite.  The drug worked as advertised though_ and the side effect profile was no worse than morning sickness when I was pregnant (and I had morning sickness up to my eigth month then).  One thing though; DON'T DRINK EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL WITH THIS MEDICATION UNLESS YOU WANT TO PUKE YOUR GUTS OUT!,I have just finished taking this drug for one week 500mg 4 times per day following a rampant infection after a root canal that three courses of antibiotics couldn't nip in the bud.  Within the first day of being on this drug the infection was noticeably abated_ and appears to be gone now.  Flagyl does make you feel queasy and I am glad to be finished treatment_ but I'd happily take it again under similar circumstances.,F,40,7  days,4/1/2008,Flagyl

I'm on 500mg_ every 6 hrs.  Been on it so far for  5 days.,The pills taste bad_ but I found that if you put it on the back center portion of your tongue_ then swallow a lot of water immediately_ it isn't too bad.  Just keep it away from the front/sides of the tongue_ where the taste is stronger.,F,44,5  days,3/30/2008,Flagyl

Another ugly side effect of this antibiotic for me is thrush (yeast infection in the mouth).,This is my 2nd time taking flagyl for blastocystosis over a 3 year period. First time I didn't experience many side effects_ but this time I'm experiencing more GI disturbances. I thought the blastocystosis would go away after the first round of flagyl_ but it is unknown how/why it has returned. Hopefully this round will clear it up for good. I took 250mg 3x/day for 7 days. Take with food and definitely avoid alcohol - I was told this drug is given to alcoholics as adverse therapy because it causes violent vomitting and seizures.,F,32,7  days,3/29/2008,Flagyl

I took the first dose last night and am NOT taking a second dose tonight. I had minor cramps all night and woke up with severe nausea (just turning in bed gives me waves of nausea) and a horrible headache at the base of my skull.  I am normally very healthy so maybe I'm just being whiny but I have been in bed for 12 hours_ only getting up to use the bathroom. My concern is the chills and the tightening of my chest.

1220, 5, C-Diff and Crohns,I had a metalic taste all the time.  I craved fast food which could overpower the metalic taste.  I always tried to take the pill with a meal to minimize the nausea.  I experienced alot of tiredness_ sleeping 10+ hours a night and laying down as much as possible during the day.  The drug totally wipes me out.  My eyes feel very tired.  I am taking this medicine for 14 days and am committed to finish it since it has always helped my really bad Crohn's flare ups.  This is my first time with C-Diff which occured after taking antibotics for bronchitis.,About once per year I have a bad Crohn's flare up with super bad abdominal pain and bloody diarrea 20 times per day (about 6 times at night.)  The last 3 times this happened I took Flagyl and Cippro for a week.  Within 48 hours the bad abdominal pain would disappear.

The truth of the matter is... It wassnt so bad_ granted I am excited that I only have 1 more dose. In the beginning I did feel nausious and didnt have much of an appetite but I pushed through... I had figured out that about 2 hours after I took the flagyl (along with bioxin and protonix) my stomach would feel a bit grumbly like I might get sick but I didnt. The only complaint_ my tounge felt hairy and I had a dry mouth and throat that was very annoying. I'm feeling much better now_ last dose in the morning. I just wanted to put something positive on here about the drug. When I first started to take the drug I had convinced myself that I would be really sick for the full 7 days. So far so good!

I was wondering how normal this was but apparently not normal at all seeing as how no one else mentioned it. I also experience diarrhea and DEFINITELY gas. I am only on day 3 and am a little concerned because the bottle opened and I lost one pill (oops).. hopes this doesnt mean this whole treatment will be for nothing.,,F,26,7  days,2/2/2008Email,Flagyl
1242, 3, Gum infection,I was prescribed 500mg three times a day for ten days.Took for three days. On third day felt like I had cold water running through my joints. Didn't think anything of it. Next day took first two then as soon as I took third felt like I'd had a stroke.I couldn't speak my face had gone numb and I felt like it had dropped to one side. I was dizzy felt sick and extremely frightened with a feeling of impending doom.I rang the emergency doctor and he said I had had a very rare reaction to it and couldn't take it again. Thank God,Have had many times before without any side effects and sometimes it worked sometimes not.I never want to see this drug again let alone take it!,M,55,3  days,1/29/2008,Flagyl

Take with food or lots of liquid.,Flagyl is nasty stuff_ but it seems to have worked.  10 days of medicne to get rid of chronic giardia was worth it.

1246, 3, BV,Nausea_ headache_ feeling really sad (started on 4th day)_ some stomach pain (much better than what I was feeling before though)_ eye twitching (not sure if it is coming from the med or just coincidence),I am supposed to take this for 7 days_ twice a day (500 mg) but I don't know if I'm going to keep taking it the entire time.  I was recently diagnosed with partial myoclonic seizures_ and am afraid it might make them worse once more gets in my system.  My doctor and pharmacist said it wouldn't_ that they had never heard of that_ but still scary.  The depression today is really bad...just want to cry a lot for no real reason.  This medicine just has so many bad side effects I'm suprised it's given so often.,F,22,7  days,1/24/2008,Flagyl
1247, 1, suspected trich,The first and second day my throat got swollen and was painful when I swallowed_ then the back of my sinuses got swollen and I had severe dehydration which set in about an hour after taking a 500mg pill twice a day then subsided 6 hours later. Flu like symptoms including sneezing & stuffy runny nose developed the third day. I stopped taking it and the dehydration went awy and the swollen throat and sinuses went away by the end of that day. Will try again tomorrow but will cut pill in half and take 2 a day. I happen to be very sensitive to any meds side effects but when I was teen took this med twice before with no problems at all.

Have had at least 3 bowel movements a day since taking it_ wouldn't really say constipation but small thumb-sized lumps that sink straight to bottom of the bowl_ which have in-turn flared up my piles to the extent that i'm now off work as I can't sit [truck driver]Haven't been able to as much as fart for nearly two weeks :-(,Would need to be a life-threatening ailment before i'd take this drug again.,M,42,5  days,1/22/2008,Flagyl
1251, 3, Systemic Infection,I caught an infection.  For two weeks I was fed Flagyl and Cipro (some others I don't remember)intravenously. It smoked my nervous system.  I went back to work after eight months and lasted three weeks. It seems like my whole system is on the rocks.

1253, 3, C Diff,Major headaches_ extreme fatigue_ stomach pain_ flu-like symptoms_ loss of appetite_ nausea_ general crappy feeling,This has to be the most horrible thing that I have ever endured.  It was like being tortured!  I dreaded every single time that I had to take a dose.  When the tiredness hit me_ I had to lay down and rest. You couldn't even get rest - nothing would make the tiredness go away...it hurt just to lay down.  Right now_ I have been off the prescription for 2 weeks and although I was retested for C diff and shown to be negative_ I am experiencing stomach pains and an extreme sense of urgency when using the restroom_ especially in the morning.  I have missed 3 weeks of work because of this whole thing.  Can anyone share with me the length of time I can expect to have problems before this horrid drug works its way out of my system?  Hopefully_ that is what is happening right now.  I would appreciate any insights.  thanks.,M,44,14  days,1/16/2008Email,Flagyl

But now I have to take it for 10 days this year because my Ulcerative Colitis relapsed a little and I haven't gotten any Jell-O yet_ but it is so hard to take this with only water. It dissolves so fast in your mouth and if you don't swallow it in like a millisecond_ you will throw up.

Metallic taste when taken alone.,I got c. diff. from a 10 day dose of clindamycin for bronchitis. I've been on Flagyl for 7 days now and it is worse than the c. diff. It does_ however_ taste fine if you swallow it with a spoonful of apple sauce-- this was a life saver. I've also found that sucking on hard candy helps some. I've tried the ginger_ crackers_ & saltines thing with no help whatsoever. I'm on day 7 & cannot wait to be done. Phenergen given for nausea gives no relief whatsoever. If I test positive later this week for c.diff. I'm going to be reluctant to take another prescription. I'm a student and a teacher and cannot get anything accomplished.,F,27,10  days,1/13/2008Email,Flagyl

Be careful with this medicine and any change in your heart rate or any other side effect that you think is serious discontinue use and consult with your docotor or be smart enough to stop taking it yourself.

Third day: food tastes different and sparks gag reflex_ increased tingling leading to numbness in toes. I called my doctor today and stopped taking the medication.,My mom took this medication for a different issue for over four months and lost all feeling in her toes. She went to numerous doctors to find out the source of her toe numbness (since she is on numerous medications and didn't suspect Flagyl)_ and by the time they found out it was caused by Flagyl_ she now has permanent damage.,F,22,3  days,12/31/2007Email,Flagyl

I'd rather just get it out of the way personally to avoid having to deal with the nasty taste and side effects again. I definitely won't be having any more sex without using condoms.

I stopped taking it(without my doctor knowing) and had scheduled bloodwork retaken.  While not on this medicine_ my numbers went back to normal.  I also am currently feeling very cold_ tired_ nausea (keeping me home from work)_ headache_ ears feel full.  I just found this website and dont think I will be taking any more of this medicine. I only take 500 mg_ 1 Xday! Any suggestions anybody? Maybe I can take a half a one.,I actually started taking this medicine while being treated for a GYN issue_ and found out that this medicine helped my stomach.  I have about 5 different things going on with my Gastro system.  I was self medicating_ and finally I went back to my GI doctor because I told him I was afraid of taking an antibiotic for a long period of time.  He just kind of shrugged and said that I shouldnt be concerned about this_ and then after I requested some bloodwork_ found out that my liver enzymes were all out of whack.  I am not ready to die_ and dealing with your liver is serious business.  I do get over the constipation and can eat again_ but Wow_ these side effects are keeping me home too!  I am scared_ and anxious about this_ not sure what to do at this point.  Yes_ it is also Christmas time!  I ruined my own work Christmas  party yesterday_ being moody because of this medication.

Very glad to find this site and see that the sensation of fast heartbeat is experienced by others; it is not listed on pharmacy sites. Before starting this med_ I had diarrhea plus an anal fissure that was very painful_ much worse than the side-effects of the flagyl. This antibiotic was prescribed because an H2 breath test showed bacterial overgrowth. Doctor wanted to prescribe neomycin but I had an allergic reaction to it once. Some of the side-effects people have to Flagyl may be due to candida flaring up. I am taking grapefruit seed extract_ probiotics and eating yogurt so that helps keep the candida (yeast) at bay.,F,60,5  days,12/1/2007,Flagyl

I will look  at other options before I take this drug again. It is a very scary drug. I can believe it when people say they have lingering side effects.,I'm taking 500 MG three times a day.

However_ beats the h*** out of dying_ or even surgery_ so it's probably a good thing I read up on diverticulitis before hitting this site.  It's nothing to mess around with.  I did decide to cut the flagyl back to 500 mg 3 times/day from the 4 prescribed after reading about other people's dosages.  And start eating (cautiously).

I had stomach cramps_ frequent bowel movements_ loose stools (always)_ bloating_ and I even vomitted once. I became dehydrated from all of this. The nurse who prescribed flagyl said it couldn't be due to the drug_ however_ all of my food poisoning tests etc came back negative. The other doctor I saw believed my symptoms were a result of the flagyl because of these normal test results. I started taking probiotics three days ago_ thinking that maybe the flagyl had wiped out too much of my ""good"" bacteria in my system. I seem to be doing better_ my stomach hasn't been as crampy or bloated_ and my bowel movements seem to be getting less frequent.

1292, 5, Intestinal bug,"Metallic taste_ softened stool_ gas_ mild fatigue_ slight dizziness_ slight disorientation_ just feeling sort of ""out of it""",I found this page while trying to figure out if I was still ill_ or if the Flagyl worked. I had a serious intestinal infection two weeks ago with constant diarrhea for several days. It was torture. Two days after starting Flagyl (500mg/3x day/7days)_ the symptoms cleared up_ but stool remained a bit soft. About 4 days in_ I started to feel fatigued and a little out of it and was worried that the bug was coming back. Found this page and I'm guessing it's the Flagyl. Today's my last day_ so I'll check back in a few days and let you know if these are side-effects or symptoms.,M,42,7  days,11/2/2007,Flagyl

On day three and so far haven't experienced any severe side affects. Do get fatigue_ minor headaches_ a weird restless sensation but otherwise seem fine. BV isn't much of a problem.

1297, 5, Diverticulitis,The typical nasty taste...I call it sour not metalic_ cause I've never chewed on metal.  I've had minor rash on chest_ neck and inner thigh.  Possibly some heart palpatations_ minor lightheadedness and nausea.  All in all completely acceptable side effects.  Completed 14 days 500 mgs. 2 times per day with 14 day 500 mgs. Cipro. Pain progressively subsided within 24 to 48 hours.,Taking this in conjunction with Cipro for Diverticulitis. I've only read a couple of comments that believe that flagyl is a worthwhile drug. If you're diagnosed with Diverticulitis_ you should take the illness very seriously. This is a possibly life threatening illness that could become progressively worse if you don't take the full course of antibiotics. The responsibility lies in the hands of the patient.  If the side effects are to hard to handle_ call your dr or pharacist. Don't just stop the meds. There are other antibiotics to treat this illness. My major word of warning...what works for one doesn't work for another. And anyone's horror story on side effects of a praticular drug may not affect another the same way. Be cautious of what other say about side effects. Be smart...these comments are only opinions and should not be a warning NOT to use this or any drug. Oh_ BTW...my PA not Dr. told me that the pain would subside over the 14 days...if the pain got worse...go to emergency,F,46,14  days,10/28/2007,Flagyl
1298, 1, Yes,Constant fatigue_ lethargy_ and apathy leading to anxiety and deression.  I couldn't concentrate at work or in class resutling in simple tasks taking an extaordinary amount of time.  The constant confusion and irritability made life very difficult.,Flagyl was indicated based on previous experience with infected fistula.  In this instance it was only suspected and flagyl was prescribed just in case.  It is possible the Flagyl served a purpose as the symptoms did disapear.  In future I will wait for diagnostic imaging (CT scan or Barium serries) to confirm 100% before ever taking it_ and even then I will have my doctor investigate alternate therapy.  The side mental health effects are not worth the risk unless there are NO OTHER OPTIONS.,M,,21  days,10/28/2007,Flagyl

Increasing Loss of apetite. During nausea spells_ sensitivity to light_ and to lesser degree_ sounds. Toward the fifth day_ spasms in liver area.Metallic taste on tongue. Some slight dizziness_ and loss of fine balance and other motor skills.,"This medication was the first of two regimes. (Second being Paromomycin - 3 capsules thrice daily for 10 days.) Had to terminate this nasty 750mg dosage (3x daily_ 10 days) prescription 17 doses in (13 remaining) due to overwhelming fatigue_ depression_ and the feeling as if I were slowly killing my internal organs. Liver started spasming (?) five days in_ so I said ""enough""_ and started the other round. Paramomycin is NOTHING compared to this Satan's Brew. I would not wish it on anyone. However.....If this is the only thing that will kill this bug_ then I would take it again in a heartbeat (assuming liver function was not compromised). It's looking like it's killed not only the Entamoeba_ but maybe some other parasites and ""barnacles"" that were freeloading on the hull of this ship I call ""me body"".

I also took probiotics 1/2 hour before the Flagyl. The C diff was from Clindamycin for lingual tonsillitis. Yesterday_ one day after finishing Flagyl_ I had another bout of diarrhea. I am hoping it was from introducing certain foods back into my diet too soon. I haven't had a problem today. If I have to repeat this again_ I heard Zofran is available in a generic form.

Take with food and fluids. Also probiotics like lactobacillus I got over the counter at wallmart. The flagyl takes out good & bad bacteria in the intestional tract so you must replace the good bacteria with (acidophyllis/lactobacillus) and the gas & loose stools go away.This will help you get thru this ordeal while you are taking flagyl.,F,44,7  days,9/6/2007,Flagyl

These could be symptoms of my health problems though as I've had them before_ to some extent.  A couple more days and I've got pain and stiffness in my ankles and knees.  I'm about 1/2 way through my treatment.  The funny thing is this diverticulitis diagnosis was a total shock_ cause I never had any GI symptoms.  So I can't even say that this stuff is working...,Every time I'm prescribed some kind of medication I go online and read about it.  If I listened to what reviewers said_ I'd probably be dead by now cause I would have refused to take all of them.  I suspect a good number of symptoms people complain about are either symptoms of their illness_ or psychological.  No offense but you guys do some serious whining.  I guess the people who have no problems with meds wouldn't be here posting reviews about them though! :)  Flagyl is probably the nastiest tasting sh/t I have ever had to take.  BUT_ on the bright side_ I previously had serious trouble swallowing pills.  I just couldn't get myself to do it - it was psychological.  So I'd swish the pill around in my mouth.  2 swishes with Flagyl cured me_ cause after the 2nd swish the stuff started to disolve and it was either time to swallow_ or time to vomit!  So_ on the bright side_ at least Flagyl's had one positive side effect on me! Let's hope I remember this experience next time I get pills..,M,34,10  days,8/16/2007Email,Flagyl

I had to give up after six days because of the neurological disturbs. Before assuming it I was already in a state of anxiety_ but Flagyl worsened my condition. I had never experienced insomnia before and that was a clear side effect of taking Flagyl. The same applies for nausea_ which I did not have in the past. I did not drink alcohol and took the pills always after a meal. I took 1500mg per day. The first night after I stopped taking the pills_ I slept much better. I did not have diarrhea before starting the treatment. Flatulence was my first symptom and Flagyl did not reduce it.

This medicine WORKS for the abscess_ but the side effects are AWFUL!,I could never HACK taking this medicine again.. I have 5 poills left and I am so upset that I have to take them!

1337, 3, Amoeba infection,I am in day 6 of a 10-day cycle of Flagyl and am starting to feel better from side effects_ which include worse diarrhea than before_ more bloating than before_ urgent discoloured urination_ bitter taste in mouth_ and depression/anxiety. My doctor had to be begged to prescribe it_ he says the infection I have is usually non-pathogenic and it is my colitis acting up but after almost a year and a half of nothing helping something had to be done. He scared me with peripheral neuropathy as a side effect and I am constantly thinking I feel it coming on but so far so good. If this does not help my symptoms I will be even more desperate than before.,I think it is wise for people to know how crappy this drug can make you feel. Also_ that it should be followed up with a round of iodoquinol for amoebic infections_ otherwise the remaining cysts will turn into amoebas again.,M,50,6  days,8/8/2007,Flagyl

I have been prescribed this drug roughly 7 times in 7 months and the last 2 ocassions I developed a severe numbness in my hands and fingers_ I called to see the nurse who advised to_ if possible_ to finish the course. I returned home and threw the rest down the toilet. 5 weeks down the line I still have numbness but I have read this is nerve damage and heals with time_ I will find out the truth when I visit the doctor this week.

That was March 2007. This is now August_ and I still wake up with terrible joint pain in my hips_ and terrible back pain (pancreatis??) after nearly 5 months. I am a young_ athletic type_ so having hip pain at this stage definitely has me worried! I feel like a senior citizen now! I now must research what the heck this chronic back pain is_ behind my left lower rib cage. I think this drug should be banned_ because it is also a known carcinogen in lab rats. WTF!!!

1344, 4, Diverticulitis,The mouth thing - they indeed taste terrible. AGH. Also_ I don't think I should be allowed to drive although I do but not very far! Very spaced out. After a brief period of being able to function semi-normally in the morning_ once I get to about 1 pm I experience an almost total fatigue. Paranoia that I maybe have now got fibromyalgia or that other thing where you are tired all the time :-) BAD cramping about day three or four (almost worse than the diverticulitis - ha ha). I have NOT_ however_ had depression or anxiety...but I'm off - it's summer. I could not have gone to 'work' or done anything normal while taking these pills. I do think people do wax on a bit about the taste_ though. For god's sake - it's keeping you from dying_ in some cases. In the old days you'd bite on a stick and they'd cut your arm off after giving you a shot of whiskey. Life is not always easy_ or fun :-)  Also - I kind of notice my skin is better than it was before. I had a bit of rosaceae on my left cheek a,"I was prescribed 500 ml TID along with Cipro 500 ml BID. So_ it's not easy to know what drug is doing what_ but I sure know they taste like hell. Also with Cipro there's an added treat - you can't go in the sun! It does feel a bit chemotherapy-like (though obviously not as horrendous!) And it increases my compassion for those who have endured THAT. I am DYING for a drink of wine - I read only one comment from a contributor that it made them stop drinking for the first time in years.

Awful headaches_ tired_ thought processes don't go as quickly or coherently which makes it somewhat difficult for my job.  Stomach pains_ low back pains_ never know when you're going to have to go the bathroom.  And when I gotta go_ nothing better get in my way!,My mom found this board today.  When I read it_ my jaw dropped at so many others having same symptoms.  Taking this after having 4000mg/day Augmentin for 7-10 days-which made me feel HORRIBLE! which was prescribed for sinus infection.  I'm not taking this nasty stuff as consistently as I'm supposed to_ because of what it does to me. I've never been so apprehensive about taking medicine before.    Taking probiotics too.  Ready to be done with it-have 4 full days left_ which will probably take me longer because I don't have much of an appetite.  NOt eating before taking the pill makes it more difficult to tolerate.  Catch 22!  I realize I should be more an adult about this and just fix the problem_ but we've all got to sound off sometime!  I'm taking 1500 mg/day for 14 days.  yuck!,F,30,14  days,7/24/2007,Flagyl

I feel constantly nauseous without ever really being nauseous.  And then there is the feelings of being overwhelmed and sad- and that's not like me usually.  Although this definitely isn't a happy time and I'm becoming much more acquainted with my bathroom than I want_ compared to others_ it sounds like I've gotten off fairly lightly.,Taking 500 MG 3 times daily.  The taste is nasty_ and just doesn't quit. I have taken it before in the past for vaginal complaints_ and I don't remember having this kind of reaction.  I am taking it with Cipro_ and at first I thought Cipro was the culprit for the bad affects since I knew of someone who had taken Cipro and had nasty side effects when it stripped all the good bacteria from his intestines and then it took months to make things right-but reading this forum it seems the side effects I'm having are consistently linked to Flagyl.  I am only on the fourth day of this so I cannot attest to its being effective or not in this situation.  I am still having some abdominal pain_ which I had thought was related to the diverticulitus_ but after reading this information_ I realize it could also be a side affect of the drug.,F,55,4  days,7/18/2007,Flagyl

As you know Antibiotics can cause yeast_ so just prepare your self for everything!,I get BV & yeast infection very frequently. The doctors all state that some woman are prone to the Dx and some are not.  The next doctor that tells me this I wont to smack.

I made sure to eat constantly throughout the day and never have an empty stomach.  As soon as I was hungry_ I could feel a headache and nausea.  I also took Acidophillus (probiotics) three times daily at least 1/2 hour before eating and ate plenty of Kefir (yogurt). I also avoided alcohol 48 hours before and after completion.

I lost my mind.  19hours after the last dose I took_ I am starting to feel better.,"My doctor attributes this to ""Post traumatic stress"" from the operation.  I have felt sad over life before.

1357, 1, BV,While on the medication_ I had terrible nausea_ constant stomach upset that seemed to get better when I had something to eat. I did eat lots of food and drank a lot of water with each pill. had the nasty taste from the med as well. I had to move my bowels more often than usual_ had diarrhea or really loose stool. I had lower back ache that was bad sometimes. for the first few days_ I couldnt figure out what was wrong_ then I started suspecting it was the Flagyl. I also experienced crying spells for no reason. when I finished the meds_ the symptoms seemed to go away for about 3 days_ then the stomach issue came back and still persists.,Its now 4 months after taking the medication_ and my stomach problem persists. I go all day every day with cramping_ feeling a need to go_ loose stool and dirrhea occasionally. My stomach seems to have gotten really sensitive because when I eat certain foods_ I have more pain and discomfort the next day. I am usually better at night_ but the stomach problem begins when I wake up in the morning_ after I move my bowel. MY doc and GI doc said its probably IBS_ but I am not convinced. Have had a sigmoidoscopy and have an ultrasound scheduled. I have been taking probiotics for 3 months_ and try to avoid foods that seem to irritate me further. I feel strongly that the antibiotics started this mess and praying hard that it goes away soon because I get depressed and cry about how this has changed my life.

1363, 1, diverticulitis,Was on cipo & flagyl for acute case of diverticulitis. Was told to be on a liquid diet and given the 2 prescriptions in the ER. Needless to say_ someone needs to tell the doctors about the need to have something in your stomach when you take flagyl. I thought is was the liquid diet that was making me so nauseous. I've never had such a reaction to a medication before. After going on solid food_ I was slightly better but still very nauseous. On day 5_ I just couldn't take it anymore. I called my doctor and he took me off of it.,Flagyl is NOT the only antibiotic that will work with diverticulitis.

The headaches were so bad I would sometimes cry.  Motrin didn't touch the pain.  Also_ I am not sure my BV is cleared up.

I then immediately follow with bread which seems to help further remove the taste from my pallet.  Im also taking acidophilus 1 hour before taking flagyl which is helping keep my system in balance & reducing some of the other side effects.,F,48,14  days,6/27/2007,Flagyl
1366, 1, C.  Diff,I was not properly warned in advance of the miserable effects of this drug. Intermittent nausea_ dizziness_ disorientation_and exhaustion. Everything smelled and tasted disgusting and there was a persistent sweetish smell of rotting vegetable matter.  Scariest of all were hours-long episodes of extremely fast erratic heart beats. It was impossible to take this with a full meal when I was nauseous and on a 3 times a day 8 hour schedule There were no instructions to take it with food_ although it DOES help.,My first course of Flagyl was for 7 days and that didn't kill the C.Diff.  I can't believe I let myself be convinced that a follow-up 10 day course was OK.  Until I read this site I didn't connect my symptoms with the drug and thought I was reacting to the C.Diff infection.

At the time physicians were reluctant to prescribe it because of it's severe side effects. Unfortunately today Flagyl and Vancomyocin are the only effective antibiotics for C Diff-which is endemic in many hospitals today. Vancomyocin is extremly expensive but it is also medicine_s last line of defense against microbes. Increasingly we are seeing resistance to Vanco -a bad thing since their are not a lot of new antibiotics ready for release. My suggestion is try to gut out the severe side effects of Flagyl and save Vancomyocin for when you really need it.,M,53,21  days,6/22/2007Email,Flagyl

I didnt realize until today that the reason all these things were happening to me was because of Flagyl.  My irritablity was so severe today that all I wanted to do is cry.  I finally felt so bad that I got on this website (what a blessing!) and read what the other users experiences as well.  It was so nice to see that I wasn't the only one!  What is really scary is that I have been taking 500mg twice a day for 5 days now and I am NINE months pregnant!  The OB said it is safe in pregnancy but that scares me knowing that everything I am enduring maybe happening to my baby too!

My husband thinks I've gone crazy and just looking for an excuse to do nothing and_ not have sex.  At least_ I am not having diarrhea!  I guess if I had read these side effects_ I would have opted for a colonoscopy.

At that point I started having horrible headaches_ aching in my neck and upper back_ blurred vision while out in the sunlight_ and nausea. I felt like I had the flu.,Allbeit_ the medication took care of the infection_ and I've been on it for 8 days_ with two more to go. I honestly don't want to finish it_ but I think I will because I don't want the infection to come back.

Stopped yesterday_ and found this site today.  Never realized that the crying and despair I felt might be due to the Flagyl.  I now feel like I have a bladder infection_ and wonder if that could be caused by the Flagyl_ or if it's a side effect thst will eventually disappear.

I was supposed to take it for 10 days_ but stopped at 7 and 1/2 because the anxiety_ fatigue and depression set in.

1392, 5, perforated diverticulitis,A very peculiar sensation of the scent of stale lillies(this is unpleasant). I perceive this scent and feel quite nauseous.  There is a low level constant nausea for about half of waking hours.  Low levels of energy_ easy fatiguability. I have been taking flagyl in combination with cipro and it may be difficult to attribute precisely which is causing what and also which symptoms are more related to the disease process.,It has become progressively more difficult to take over time because I know that I will feel queasy during and soon after.  I do appreciate previous comments on taking this with peanut butter and milk because that has helped. Considering how I was feeling during hospitalization to how I am feeling now_ this is a strong and effective medication.One other comment(don't read if you don't want to hear about flatulence)- I had very foul smelling large volume gas for years_ and that seemed to have cleared up.,M,50,4  weeks,5/8/2007,Flagyl

1395, 3, Burst appendix - operation,"Extreme nausea. Weight loss because I vomited everything I ate. Felt sad all the time. Auditory hallucinations - could hear music in the sound of running water. This may have been caused by toxins released by fungi growing in my stomach (as a result of the ""good"" stomach bugs beng killed off). Couldn't stand the smell of fruit (they all smelt like fungi or mould). This is another indicator that I had fungi/mould growing in my stomach as a result of the Flagyl.",Rough drug but it must have worked (i.e. killed off the bacterial infection from my burst appendix).

1402, 3, B.V.,Worst side effect was ANXIETY.  Extreme mood swings usually at night.  I was taking 2 500mg tabs a day--I just took my last dose about 20 minutes ago (THANK GOD!) I didn't experience the depression until about 3 days into my treatment but it came on very strong.  Also have had problems with DIARHEA and VIVID DREAMING with more trouble waking up the next day than usual. Also noticed it sometimes seems almost as if my throat is swelling or just that it is harder to breath than usual. Symptoms of ANXIETY peaked last night when i had a breakdown--Uncontrollable crying_ EXTREME emotion swings_ feeling guilty afterwards.  My boyfriend thinks i'm going crazy but I know i'm not because none of this was a problem until i was taking Flagyl.,"I WAS NOT aware of these negative side effects until after i experienced them.... It's not just me reading ""scary stories"" on the internet_ i didn't know so many people suffered from these anxiety attacks as a result of this medicine until i just ran accross all of these comments_ and almost every single one has a form of anxiety listed as a side effect.  I hope not to ever be prescribed this drug again.  It does seem to have helped my B.V. very much so_ but there MUST be an alternative for people who experience this.",F,19,7  days,4/22/2007,Flagyl

1404, 3, C diff,Horrible stomach and intestinal pains.  Hard to know which was the Flagyl and which was the C diff.  I did learn how to manage taking Flagyl after about 2 weeks of feeling awful on it.  You have to eat an entire meal every time you take it_ even if it's 10:00 PM or later_ or it will wreak havoc with your stomach.  When I started doing this_ I had no more problems.,I don't know if it has cured the C diff or not which is why I ranked it a 3.  It definitely did stop the diarrhea but I don't think it cured the problem since symptoms recurred when I stopped taking the Flagyl after 23 days.,F,54,23  days,4/16/2007,Flagyl

These have been completely eliminated by Flagyl_ my appetite reurning in two days and the nausea gone in four. Worst bit was abstinence from alcohol!

1420, 4, Diverticulitis,Inability to sleep.  When I did fall asleep for an hour or so_ I'd wake up in a panic with a sense of impending doom. Extreme nausea.  No energy. Aching upper arms/shoulders.  Headache.,I have never posted on one of these things before_ but feel my experience may help others.  I have NEVER had any side effects from any medications that I know of except this one.  I was prescribed this along with Levaquin. By the last helf of the 7 day course the side effects were much milder.  I was actually able to sleep the last two nights.  Today is my last day_ thank the Lord!  I truly feel that some of the nighttime anxiety and inability to sleep may have been caused more by the battle going on between the bacteria and the antibiotic.  I know that sounds strange_ but that is really the only conclusion I can come to.  Sure_ the last couple of days I have felt a milder version of the side effects I listed_ but the first few days_ I actually almost quit taking it because I felt the cure was worse than the infection.  I also discovered that it is VERY important to take it with AS MUCH food as you can_ it helps ease the nausea. My advice is to grit your teeth and finish the full cours,F,46,7  days,3/24/2007,Flagyl

As I take this medication (generic) I have been taking Acidophilus ( 2 tablets ) first thing in the morning and make sure I eat Activia yogurt as I am taking it.  This keeps the good bacteria up in intestines and keeps the diahrrea away.,Personally_ I cannot stand this medication but it does work.  PLEASE...........try the Acidophilus (you can get it any drug store....it's a dietary supplement ...it also helps to prevent BV in the future) and the yogurt.........good luck all,F,48, ,3/23/2007,Flagyl

1435, 1, flu and non-symptomatic UTI,Already described_ this is an addendum with recommendations,I did not have the terrible insomnia so many folks here report_ despite the fact that I have been prone to it my whole life. I believe this is because I take 100 mg 5-HTP_ valerian_ and melatonin every night.It works and is available through major drug stores and is very safe_ although I recommend purchasing the valerian online as it is much more efficacious_ and in fact all of these are quite a bit cheaper that way. Email me for my source (I do not work for or represent the company in any way)Also_ since 5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin_ that may have been why I did not experience the depression/anxiety so common with this drug. ,F,42,6  days,2/17/2007Email,Flagyl

I suspect the Flagyl is removing ALL bacteria ...both good and bad.  If you have diverticulitis you certainly want (and need) to be aware of your stools.  Check for blood_ etc.  though I've not had that problem_ the loss of odor is strange.",I hate taking this drug because it seems like I'm using a bomb to target a very specific problem.

1437, 5, Giardia,None.,Do NOT let these bad reviews scare you!  I did and ended up waiting a week to take my prescription_ when I could have already been better.  I'm typically very paranoid about taking ANY meds -- even Advil is a big deal for me -- so I was waiting for all the bad side effects_ and then: NOTHING.  I took acidophilus during the course of my treatment_ so maybe that helped ward off any stomach upset symptoms.  The only thing I can say is that the pill tasted bitter_ but no one said medicine tastes good.  With all that said_ I'm very sorry for the people who experienced negative side effects; I'm so grateful I wasn't one of them.,F,36,7  days,2/2/2007,Flagyl

The treatment worked fine both times but_ because there were two drugs_ I have no idea whether one or the other might have done the job alone.  The side effects of flagyl are so severe (for me at least) that I finally called the hospital to ask whether I could cut or space out the dosage in an effort to reign in the side-effects.  To my surprise the on-call Dr. said ""stop it"".  Not being my regular Dr. I suppose he didn't want to go much further out on a limb by explaining how it is that I can stop a 10 day drug regimen at day 4.5_ but his response was immediate and emphatic.Either the appearance of full blown side effects means the flagyl has done its job and is now looking for trouble where there is none_ or the flagyl is a just-in-case side-kick to cipro thrown in to cover all the bases. I think the initial diagnosis and prescription should be done with enough care to eliminate",M,58,4.5  days,12/30/2006,Flagyl

I am a physician myself and was able to diagnose it promptly. Even I Got dehydrated and had to hospitalized.This is a rare side-effect but you should watch out for it.,Flagyl alone only partially helped my symptoms of bloody diarrhea. Later I took oral vancomycin in liquid form which worked much better but then bloody diarrhea recured 6 weeks after stoping vancomycin. This time I started on vancomycin capsules which worked only partially.Two weeks later_ got on liquid form vancomycin with resolution of symptoms.

I've never experienced a side effect from a medication worth mentioning before.  Sure_ maybe drowsiness or dry mouth.  Nothing compares to the side effects you will experience with this antibiotic_ short of perhaps antibiotics used to treat cancer patients.  I soldier through the week long course of treatment because I know it will cure my illness - and it does work - but I really am suffering.  I chose SOMEWHAT SATISFIED because I know of no other antibiotic used to treat bacterial vaginosis that works so well_ but it's a miserable week. The only other medications I take are a low-dose oral contraceptive and a multivitamin. I've heard (anecdotally - not evidence) that oral contraceptives and this med don't get along well together. Perhaps. If I hadn't taken this medication before and wasn't aware of the SEVERE side effects_ I would go to a primary care physician to seek treatment for the flu.

My pill bottle says right on it_ if this upsets your stomach_ eat something with it_ and don't drink alcohol or operate machinery. Maybe your problem is less your medication than it is your pharmacy.

Didn't care about the nausea - when I ate it felt better.  Around Day 10 I had a HUGE panic attack that lasted almost two days - hyperventilating_ crying_ diarrhea (NOT the C Diff kind!)_ confusion_ felt I was going crazy.  Leg weirdness too.  My husband keeps saying he will be happy when I am off of this because it's made me weird_ jumpy_ dizzy all the time.  Had to get some Xanax to sleep.

1477, 5, Suspected Giardia,I have a dull headache_ am experiencing exhaustion_ and right after I take the pill_ a sharp gas pain in upper stomach which is relieved with belching. The general flatulence and diarrhea is attributable to the 'bug' so I can't say the meds are to blame. These effects come in waves_ and thus make me frightened and panicky. I have noticed this after starting the 4th day of treatment. If I lie down and try to stay calm the fatigued feeling passes. It's a weird 'suppressed' feeling since if I take a deep breath I can get lots of air_ yet I feel out of breath during those 'spells'.I am more fearful of what may be wrong with me than of the drug which can be stopped. My tests have so far not been conclusive for Giardia.,Once the intermittent effects pass and I calm down_ I realize that the awful gnawing sensation in my tummy is being helped. I do not know where I would have picked up giardia (I did not drink from a stream_ have no kids_ etc) but since stool tests for other stuff came back negative_ and this fit the symptoms_ I am being treated.

I felt soooo much better though. Unfortunately_ I relapsed 8 days later. I was told that I probably should have had a longer Rx because I was sick for so long_ so I got another identical Rx for 14 days.

Next day after starting F._ I was in emerg.rm. with a feeling of someone choking me and the skin on my neck too sensitive to touch. ER Dr. didn't have a clue. Maybe virus. 4 days later_ back to MD: low blood pressure_ dehydration_ weight loss (9 lbs)_ total inflammation of abdomen/stomach/esophagus. Still no-one made the connection to F.

Personally_ I was doing great with the Amebiasis_ I was one of those who wasn't actually ill from the amoeba. I didn't feel sick until taking Flagyl! My greatest concern is that 5 days after completing my medication_ I'm still slightly dizzy!!!!!! Could I be one of those that suffers irrepairable nervous system damage from taking this drug!?

I have been off of it for about two weeks and still am experiencing all of the above symptoms. I am noticing the metallic taste more now than when I was taking the drug. I really feel bad.  Seems like I just can't go for very long before becomming extremely tired.    I have also noticed that I have been pale lately and this tends to get worse with fatigue.

1485, 1, diverticulitis,Tingling and slight numbness first 2 days on oral meds_ morphing by third day into horrible metal mouth_ alien-looking and feeling tongue and mouth_ no solid stool and no appetite. Total loss of sex drive. From day 5 on_ extreme depression.,Flagyl and cipro IV for 4 days_ then 10 days of 500 mg pills (3 per day Flagyl_ 2 cipro). The fun really began on about day 5 when the heavy cloud of depression descended over me. Thankfully_ had never never really comprehended what real chemically-induced depression is_ and maybe what I experienced was not it_ but whatever it is/was was BY FAR the worst/most intensely bizarre feeling i have ever had. The mental aspects of the drug were for me BY FAR the worst.  Coming across this site was a godsend - the physical side-effects were relatively predicable but I had zero sense that the mental stuff was possible_ and got real confused and scared once the depression kicked in - nobody mentioned these possible severe side-effects.  Been off the meds for 72 hours and beginning to feel a slight lifting of the veil.,M,43,10  days,8/14/2006,Flagyl

I took the generic brand so swollowing the pills were discusting because they left a gross taste in my mouth that lasted for awile afterward_ but that was the least of my side effects. I was ok for the first 3 days on it but on the 4th day and on I was extremly tired all the time had very little to no appeteite and experienced servere nausea and dizziness for most of the day and night which lead to sleep deprevation. I am not sure if the med is helping_ but for all this aggrevation I sure hope it is.

I believed that the vaginal infection somehow entered my uterus because I was experiencing terrible abdominal pain and pressure. Turns out that the side effects from this medication just made me TOTALLY paranoid. Also_ I was running a fever over 100 degrees for several days and constantly woke up drenched in sweat. Today is day 4 of seven and after being constipated for the first 2 days_ I have spent most of the day in the bathroom with serious diarrhea. I wake up with terrible headaches and back pain every morning. I had no idea that the side effects would be this bad--I've taken the same medication two other times with little or no effects. It does work but if there was an alternative_ I would request it. I've noticed a lot of posts note increasing sensitivity to the side effects.

It's even worse because you know it will make you sick soon after you take it.  It took a few days_ but now I'm using a few tricks that work great.  Buy empty pill capsules from a pharmacy_ and stuff the pills inside them.  No bad taste_ and it takes a bit longer for the nausea to hit.  My GI doc also gave me Tigan_ an antinausea drug_ to take with each dose of Flagyl.  What a difference!!!  The first few days were absolute hell_ but now it's no big deal.

I took it around 3 pm_ and was completely fine that whole day and night. The next morning i woke up at 7am_ couldnt go back to sleep so I went to get a drink of water_ it hit me all of a sudden! I had to run to the bathroom. At first there wasnt really anything to throw up cus i hadnt ate yet_ so i was dry heaving....But then about 15 mins later i was full on vomitting. I could barely breath_ i was sweating_ and it was horrible. It continued all day_ about an hour apart...I finally called the doc and she told me it was normal.

I took one dose of 4 pills and don't even know how I was able to swallow them.  I've had bv a couple times_ and they usually give me the vaginal gel for it.  I can't believe that they made some of you take this disgusting crap for 7 days for bv!  Please protect yourself when having sex_ I trusted the person I was with (I've known him for 15 yrs)and this (the infection and the meds) is definately NOT worth it!

Five days into meds._ I felt MUCH worse - burning_ radiating pain in lower left pelvis_ and felt really sick. They couldn't find any other reason for it_ so I was told to continue both meds. It took the fourth doctor to order a stool sample and discover the C-Diff - which was caused by the CIPRO!  Am just finishing my second course of Flagyl_ and for the last two days_ I've had several episodes of sudden hot sweats_ and today some dizzyness.  And lots of abdominal cramping for several days. Thought it might still be the C-Diff - but then found this site and realized it's the Flagyl!  Can't wait to be off it!  Thanks so much_ everybody (especially thanks to those who mentioned muscle weakness with C-Diff - my legs still feel shaky_ especially the fronts of my thighs (if that makes sense).,10 days on both Cipro and Flagyl - then 5 days off both and felt much worse.

1511, 4, For suspected parasites,Side effects for me included mild fatigue_ leg pain_ tingling_   stomach upset_ and thirst.,With flagyl in your system the effects of even trace amounts of alcohol are exactly as if you were taking Antabuse.So you need to stop consuming alcohol 24 hours prior to your first dose and then continue your non-consumption for 72 hours after taking the last dose.  You must avoid condiments containing alcohol ( such as wine vinegar_ certain mustards_ Tobasco sauce_ soy sauce etc.) if you don't wish to add to your stomach upset.  It is also best administered in doses spread as far apart as possible; so_ if you are taking three doses a day_ spread them out over the entire 24 hours_ such as dosing at 6 am_ 2 pm and then again at 10 pm.  I chose to wake up several times in the middle of the night to take my third dose in order to observe the spacing of the doses_ which I believe kept my side effects to a minumum.,F,60,7  days,6/4/2006,Flagyl

1522, 1, Crohn's Fistula/Abcess,I was put on Flagyl for 6 weeks. Side effects: pain_ primarily in my joints and bones in my leg and chest. It started after 1 day of taking Flagyl. My ribs were acing when breading_ my joints became inflamed and my right hip locked in one position. The pain was gone 2 days after stopping the treatment. However the fistula was still infected_ so I was put on it again a few days later. The pain returned.  My doctor says that the pain is purely coincidental and has nothing to do with the Flagyl. My Crohns became very active while taking Flagyl. As a result I was hospitalised. There I was given dexamethasone and prednisolone_ to stop the inflammation_ and fosamax to prevent osteoporosis induced by corticosteriod use. These drugs can also cause osteonecrosis. Now one year later Im diagnosed with avascular osteonecrosis of the femur in/of the right hip. I wish I had never taken the Flagyl.,,M,31,6  weeks,5/11/2006,Flagyl

Afraid to go back to sleep (couldn't because of the severe pain in back and lower abdomen) but forced myself to sit up and stay awake.

Cipro causes enough bad side effects_ but Flagyl made everything worse. Would wake up in the night with heart racing and in terror_ had terrible nightmares. I'm on my last day and so happy to be stopping this - It may work to kill the bugs but makes life hell in the process. Will request a different drug in the future.

I have had 9 hours of sleep in the last 58 hours_ and 5 are only because i went to emergency room and they had to give me a mega dose of attivan to calm my heart down. worked for a few hours_ but right back to square one again. I am now on day 5 and dont intend on taking anymore of this rat poison. doc also gave me tenormin to slow my heart rate down and zoloft to get me through this_ but can take 3 weeks to take affect. im feel like i'm in hell!,F,31,5  days,3/18/2006,Flagyl

1539, 1, Diverticulitis,Near immediate_ never-ending terrible taste in the mouth.  Extreme fatigue_ light-headedness.  Extreme nausea and cramps_ and a complete loss of appetite_ which I had attributed to the diverticulitis.  However_ after 24 hours off this medication_ my appetite returned_ and the cramps and nausea were gone. On day 5_ I broke out in red dots from the stomach to my feet(broken/bleeding capillaries)_ and hives all over the body.  I itched from head to toe.  On day 6_ my doctor took me off it and gave me several anti allergy meds.  Day 8 (as I type this)_ I got a burning sensation from the top of my head to the lower chest.  My upper chest is now extremely hard_ red and dry_ almost as if it's burning from the inside out.  Back to the doctor tomorrow.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone; in my case_ it was a POISON!,I also feel that the ER doctor over prescribed.  I was prescribed 40 flagyl at 500 mg 4x day_ along with 28 500 mg Cipro at 2x day_ or 6000 mg of ab's per day!

A co-worker asked me today how I felt_ and I heard myself saying ""Like I have aliens living inside me.""  There's a tightness/tuging in my chest like someone has tied piano wire around my esophagus and is ever so gentley tugging at it_ continually.  There's a creepy mental  disorientation:  I can be driving down the road_ and suddenly find myself studying my fingernails or digging into my purse for something - instead of driving!  There are also perceptual effects:  sounds don't sound right_ I'll hear myself speaking too loudly or too forcefully.  My husband says I'm acting ""bipolar"" (hyper_ talking a mile a minute_ then depressed). My inhibitions are down (telling a co-worker you have aliens inside you?  Not good!)  Sleepy_ but not like normal sleepiness.  More like some other entity has taken over my body and is draining the energy off.  I imagine this may be what chemotherapy feels like.

My symptoms were knocked out immediately_ but I have to stay the course and take this drug for 7 days total. Two more days to go. I'll be so glad when it's over_ I'm going to celebrate with a bottle of champagne (oh_ waiting another 48 hours for all of the drug to leave my system_ so I won't puke). Flagyl is making me feel so weird_ I have trouble concentrating on anything and I can't seem to get anything done. I'm keeping quiet and trying not to demand too much of myself. It's a good idea to have something to eat with your dose_ then your stomach will feel better. Feeling very strange_ out-of-it and stoned_ with a twinge of nausea_ not at all pleasant.,F,56,5  days,10/17/2005,Flagyl

After 7 days of choking down these pills_ most of the side effects wore off in a day or two.  10 days later_ I am still having headaches_ ringing in my ears and numbness in my fingertips and scalp.  I think it knocked out the Giardia because the diarrhea has gone away.  The lingering headaches and especially the numbness on my scalp are scaring the heck out of me.

EXTREME nausea_ burning down both arms_ a severe burning in my chest_ and I developed something from the drug called_ ""Parkinsonian Type Syndrome"". I trembled and shook for approximately one week. The neurologist in the hospital told my parents that she THOUGHT that the ""Parkinonian Syndrome"" would be temporary.",Would NEVER recommend this drug. I was then put on Vancomycin (which is highly expensive but worth the money) with NO side effects to it. Since then I have had C. Difficile three more times in my life and fear I have it now due to another antibiotic exposure. The last time it was in the advanced stages and my stool was pure blood. I was on Vancomycin for months and it finally went away.,F,35,3  days,9/28/2005,Flagyl
1582, 4, antibiotic induced diarrhea,Took Flagy for suspected C.diff antibiotic induced colitis. Dose: 500mg 3xday for 10days. The first 4-5 days just had the typical nausea_ lack of appetite_ metallic/dry mouth_ furry tongue. I have found taking it with food helps and using milk thistle extract supplement (400-500mg/day) mitigates these side effects. Also Alacer vitamin C packets help.  Day 4 was horrible_ started to feel very toxic.  Day 5_ I had my first normal stool after 4 weeks of serious diarrhea.  Doctor had me cut the dose to 250mg 4xday after Day 6; I was starting to get numbness and tingling in the sides of my arms and hands. I could only manage 250mg 3xday. Cutting the dose for the last 4 days helped.,Gotta love it_ it is one of the only drugs_ and cheap_ that does what it does; killing both amoemba and anaerobic bacteria.  I took Flagyl for 10 days 3 years ago for Blastocystis Hominis infection (along with Bactrim).  It made me so nauseus I wouldn't have finished the treatment if it weren't for the milk thistle extract.  But I tested clear of Blasto after that treatment.This time taking Flagyl I also had dark grey/black tongue fur spots_ which in Traditional Chinese Medicine indicates toxin building up in your body (no I was not sucking on licorice).  Taking about 4-5 days after treatment to clear that dark tongue fur. I have been diarrhea free about 1 week now - fingers crossed.  FYI: I also did limited breastfeeding while on Flagyl treatment. Not ideal_ but under certain circumstances your doctor/lactation consultant will OK if your baby is old enough (mine was 6months).,F,42,10  days,9/22/2005Email,Flagyl

This caused severe diarrhea_ which I've had on and off for a month.  I took 500 mg of Metronidazole (substituted for Flagyl) 3x a day for 14 days.  At the end_ I felt pretty well...not 100%_ but I wanted to eat again.  A couple of days later_ the severe diarrhea came back.  The new sample tested positive for c-diff again.

(Saltines help get rid of the taste.)  I also found that taking my last daily dose of flagyl at least an hour before bed helped relieve the nighttime nausea.  Keep a lozenge or hard candy by the bed with a glass of water to get rid of the bad taste during the night.  The biggest help was putting the flagyl in an empty gelatin capsule (health food stores carry them) - I just broke the pills in two or crushed them - it makes it possible to swallow these foul things without too much trauma.  While this drug seems to work I HATE it.,F,52,10  days,9/2/2005,Flagyl

Lightheadedness_ exhaustion_ abdominal pain_ headaches_ extreme dehydration and depression.,I can't image that I went to my GYN for Bacterial Vaginitis and three weeks later have had non-stop diarrhea_ fatigue_ bloating_ pain_ and headaches as a result. My GYN recommended a parasite exam which had me out of work for 2 days since I was unable to take Immodium during testing. The tests show nothing is wrong_ but my diarrhea tells a different story. My reg doc says there may be a chance that Flagyl gave me a type of bacteria that develops when it's trying to kill off others. Either way_ he's at a loss for answers and has now directed me to a gastroentologist. He says I may need a colonoscopy. He asked me to eat a very bland diet in the interim (bread_ potatoes_ rice_ etc.). This is horrible. My job is complaining about my sudden need to leave during the day due to feeling weak and extremely exhausted. So while my Bacterial Vaginitis is all better_ now I seem to have a different more serious problem and absolutely more pain and suffering. I completely recommend against the use of this drug.

The only side effect I encountered was the metallic taste (akin to chewing on tin foil - ugh).  That being said_ the cure was definitely better than the disease.  I was on a 10 day course of 500 mg/3 times daily.  Symptoms of the c. diff abated after 4 days and while it was tempting to not finish the course of flagyl (I don't like taking medication unless necessary)_ I definitely wanted to make sure this bug was history!  I don't know about everyone else's adverse reactions_ but I made absolutely sure I took each dose with food and some milk for added protection - no stomach upsets.

I was prescribed two types of medicine before that for Salamonella and for parasites.  FLAGYL was the last medication I took.  I took it for four days.  During those four days I was extremely exhausted_ nauseous_ and a little dizzy. The fourth day I really started to feel the adverse side effects and went to the hospital.  Apparently_ I was given too many combinations of medicine in too high of dosages.  I am sure FLAGYL works for a lot of people but be cautious when you take it.  Pay attention to your body.

No side effects that time. This time presribed 500mg. 3 times a day for 10 days.  Got to Day 6_ (took 1 5oomg that morning) and by around 12pm all hell broke loose. Called my Doc and told me to stop the meds.  Not sure if the giardia was killed off.  Can't believe that some Docs still have their patients take this med even with terrible side effects.

1602, 4, diverticulitis,loss of appetite_ extreme lightheadedness_ minor nausea,I've been an RN for 25 years and have learned over the years some patients will state they have every side effect known_ to every drug they take.  And these people are usually chronic pill takers_ or hypochondriacs.  So I read a lot of these submissions with an open mind.  I never take pills unless it's unavoidable. But I will say after wondering if my experiences were common with this drug_ I find they are.  For me to have no appetite is very unusual.  I've never been lightheaded until this drug.   I can give some other useful information.  You can avoid the foul_ bitter taste of this pill on your tongue_ when trying to get it down by buying empty gelatin capsules (they come in every size ) and put the pills in them. I have also done this with my cats who on occasion have had to take Flagyl.  It's the only way to get it down them.  You can get empty gelatin capsules at most health food stores.,F,50,7  days,7/9/2005,Flagyl

Did I mention black urine and diarrhea that lasted a couple weeks_ could not get enouhg water either had to stay up some nights continually drinking water (Dr. would not believe me so would not give an IV of fluids to hydrate me). Pain intense in muscles/joints. Pain and joint mobility got better but CNS and neurological symptoms not so much better.

Veins darkened and skin sagging and seem to have aged 20 yrs. Oh and at one point kidneys didn't seem to function but that may have been the EXTREME dehydration I feel I ought to have water IV_ still_ after many months. Most side effects did improve or go away over several months but this has really sidelined my life_ have not driven a car in all that time due to 'stupor' and fatigue and tendonitis symptoms (can't push pedals).,Am told to seek an immunologist and ask about fungal overgrowth caused by Flagyl and ask for Diflucan_ so I will do that.

I was taking three pills per day for 14 days.  I felt worse before better_ however the medication did work and cured my C-Diff.  It kicked in about a week or so after treatment.  My appetite increased like crazy after medication.  My energy didn't come back for about two weeks after medication.  This is because the C-Diff caused me to be diagnosed with anemia because I had blood in my stools (along with a menstrul cycle) I lost a lot of blood_ and because I couldn't eat or hold anything down_ I lost about 15 lbs. I started ferrous sulfate iron pills_ and it's getting my iron levels back up and helping to rebuild my energy. I'll say I'm at 92%.  My stools are still soft_ but not runny and they're completely formed.  Flagyl works.  It worked for me at least.  It may not seem like it at the time_ but give it time_ you'll see. If you still have diarrhea_ upset stomach_ cramps_ and/or vomiting after taking Flagyl_ you may want to consider going to a GI_ you may have something else going on. You may also still have a few side effects (dizziness_ dry mouth_ fatigue_ nausea)after you've stopped taking the medication_ but don't worry_ it will go away.

I am prone to yeast and bacterial infections. It does the job and within a day you get relief. However_ It has got to be one of the the worst tasting meds out there. I know you are supposed to finish all your meds that are prescribed but this is one that I have only finished a couple times. This time I only made it to 3 days instead of the prescribed week. I agree with the other reviewer that said this must kill all the bacteria and flora (good and bad) in your system so make sure you are taking some sort of probiotics/acidophilus supplement when you are taking this stuff or your tummy will be extra upset!

He said to finish the course (2 more days). You bet I saw another doctor after that! My primary doctor and neurologist agreed that I was definitely allergic to it! I'm still suffering three weeks afterwards from the numbness on one side. Hasn't gotten. Feel dizzy still. Noise and bright lights set off the passing out like feeling. Anyone go through that?

The flagyl was prescribed only as a PREVENTIVE measure so that the mildly invasive procedure didn't cause an infection.  Within 4 days (!!!) I started to feel the disorientiation and pain in my back and legs...called the doc..took me off flagyl....however_ the pain continued to increase over the next 3 weeks!!  I was treated with oxycontin/percocet/valium for the pain.  My doc suspected a back injury_ however ALL tests (MRI_ CAT scan_ X-rays) were normal.  I missed aprrox 3 wks of work after taking just 8 tablets total_ not to mention running my car off the road on my way to work one morning!!!

I've used it occasionally over the past 10 years but only as a last resort and only for a short time_ such as one to two weeks. The worst side effect is the unbearable metallic tase. Sometimes it's so bad I want to rip my tongue out! It does work well in tamdem with Prednisone (synergy) so it can be helpful to quickly quash a flare up before it gets out of hand thus limiting the need for prolonged doses of prednisone or a costly Remicade infusion.,M,46,1  weeks,6/11/2004,Flagyl
