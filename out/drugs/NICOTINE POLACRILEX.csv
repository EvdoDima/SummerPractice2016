0, 1, Replacement therapy for Skoal.,I have had a ringing in my ears for several weeks_ and my jaw has started popping (left side). My wife stated that my hair was beginning to fall out_ in the back of my head_ behind my ears. I have noticed that my hair is thinning_ and one of my children has noticed it also. I used to crave a dip first thing in the morning_ but now_ it's 2 (4MG) pieces. After doing my research to confirm my suspicions_ I convinced myself not to buy another box  while at the pharmacy today. These side effects may not happen to everyone_ but why take the chance. I quit drinking overnight_ and I WILL beat this too. The key is to set a date_ and give yourself some grace to  enjoy it before you quit. But once you do...don't look back. It's like breaking up with someone that you know isn't right for you; after a little while_ the decision to leave makes your life better...in every way. Take control of yourself...you can do it.,Don't replace one addiction for another. You don't replace Meth with cocaine...it just doesn't make sense. Pray about it_ set the date_ and do it.,M,46,3  months64 MG 8X D,12/28/2013Email,Nicotine polacrilex
