2, 5, anxiety_panic attacks and insomnia,None.,This has been a miracle drug for me. No more panic attacks or anxiety! Just your average day to day anxiety. I was on an antidepressant for 20 years and was able to get off of it. My antidepressant didn't work half as well! This wonder drug does a combination of things for me. To lowering my blood pressure_ fixing my heart problem_ and helping me to deal with my overall response to anxiety to any stressful situation! I just can't say enough for this wonder drug!,F,52,2  years60mg 2X D,4/12/2016,Inderal
3, 1, Hypertension,Severe diarrhea and headaches.,Controlled blood pressure. But I could not tolerate the side effects.,F,31,4  days40 x2 day,1/25/2016,Inderal
4, 2, Panic Disorder_ GAD,Low blood pressure_ hallucinations from not enough blood getting to my brain_ dizziness_ low heart rate_ fatigue,This is a dangerous drug if you are small and your blood pressure tends to run on the low end of normal like mine. My blood pressure was 70/50 on this drug and I almost got into a car accident because I started hallucinating while I was driving... I thought there was a house on the turnpike. This was because not enough blood was getting to my brain. I almost fainted several times because my heart rate got so low. It helped my anxiety but these side effects could have killed me. My doctor had the nerve to put me on two other blood pressure medications with the same results. He's not willing to put me on ativan because of a risk of addiction_ but he's willing to give me meds that could kill me? Go figure.,F,20,2  months10 mg 1X D,12/29/2015,Inderal
5, 3, Migraines_ tremor_ anxiety,tiredness_ lack of motivation_ aches and pains_ occasional shortness of breath_ not able to do any cardio exercise_ heart palpitations_ feeling of heaviness/weakness_ dizziness/light headedness if I get up too fast.,For anxiety it has worked wonders. Although it has taken a while to get used to some side effects (which cause anxiety). Physcial anxiety symptoms are gone. Overtime though_ I have noticed that it has helped less with migraines_ in fact not much at all now. Lack of motivation has increased_ and perhaps slight depression has set in. It also causes heart palpitations for me_ a few times a year_ that can last a few hours or re-occure over days. I have attempted to ween off these twice_ with major withdrawls and side effects_ so no luck there. I have also increased dosage due to increased migraines_ which helped - but caused heart palpitations within a day or two.Be careful with this one. I was once active_ playing sport and fairly healthy - but this kills your ability to do any cardio (limits the heart rate) and greatly effects your motivation. Its also very hard to get off this drug.,M,33,3  years20mg 1X D,12/20/2015Email,Inderal
6, 3, Anxiety,After prolonged use I had severe shortage of breadth_ leg and arm tingling_ severe fatigue_ headaches_ dizziness_ nausea and depression.

7, 3, slightly elevated BP and headaches,Sleepy but I take at bedtime; Stomach rumblings making more bathroom runs - not quite diarrhea but still annoying.  I have gained weight but just a few lbs - noticeable with clothes but I needed to start walking more anyway :)  Was already taking Gabapentin for headaches_ still am. This was added due to elevated BP.   So taking both I have no headaches. BP not down to where it needs to be yet.,I have the extended release if that makes a difference.  I am trying to give it a good month before I decide if it is worth the side effects.  I have one refill for another month but haven't decided if I will fill it yet.,M,42,3  weeks60 MG 1X D,6/11/2015,Inderal

9, 1, high blood pressure over active thy,I took 1 30mg pill at noon and less than an hour later I was nausea and sleepy. Felt as though I had been on a rollercoaster ride that spends non stop. I also began to feel lethargic and caught myself taking in large breaths of air and releasing slowing to calm my mind. By 9pm..The side effects were still severe. I went to bed and woke up at 1:00am to the worst stomach cramps and sharp pains in the back. It was non stop all through the night. Please be cautious of these things. If I had taking the recommended dosage of 60mg I definitely would of had to go to E.R.  After taking 30mg I couldn't drive my daughter to school or go to work the next day.

I ate two average meals like normal_ but yet whopped on nearly 2 stone. Be careful not to suddenly stop these tablets it's very dangerous I went dangerously tachycardic_ even with a g.P's titration plan_ can cause nasty withdrawal side affects_ but it only lady's a few weeks.

22, 2, attempt at managing anxiety,Urinary retention_ weakness,The doctor was reluctant to prescribe this_ but I was desperate for something to help with my severe crippling anxiety.  But he was right_ it wasn't for me_ and it only gave about an hour of relief in the 4-hour duration of it's effect.  Still_ not worth it for me_ since I was so painfully bloated in that time from drinking water_ but not having to pee.This is better for those with high blood pressure.  Mine was too low at the time_ which was the main reason the doctor didn't want me on it.  My pulse and heart rate were okay_ though_ so I was able to convince him.I only took that one pill_ and then eventually threw the rest away.,F,42,1  times.10 mg 1X AN,10/25/2013,Inderal

I started off with 10mg 1x per day but was having very strange side effects (IE: Foggy head_ panic_ dizziness_ feeling faint) and I lowered my dosage to 5mg 1 x per day. This has helped my PAC's/PVC's tremendously. The only thing I dislike about this medicine is the half life. I feel it only works for maybe 5 hours before the effects disappear.

Neurology tried me on Inderal and have only had a handful of mild to moderate migraines since!   Most of those were due to having forgotten to take my med or waited too late.

38, 1, Essential Tremor,The first side effect I noticed occurred within the first week.  I had sleep terrors and hallucinations at night_ so bad that I let out blood curdling screams that scared my family to death.  This occurred intermittantly throughout the entire time I took the medicine.The second side effect I had was a feeling of heaviness.  And that makes sense:  I gained 30 pounded within the first few months!!  No matter how healthy I ate_ I continued to gain weight. The third_ rather strange side effect was that my blood pressure went up 30 points!  I actually have always had low normal blood pressure (108/70 generally).  My blood pressure jumped so high I couldn't believe it.The final side effect I had was extreme bloating and distension in my abdomen.,I actually had very little positive effect from the medicine.  My essential tremor had begun to affect my speaking voice in addition to having a jerk in my left arm and hand_ and shaky right hand and arms.  Once I began to take hte medicine_ the only thing I felt some relief with was in my speaking voice.  My hands continued to shake and my left arm continued to jerk.  My blood pressure jumped so much and I have gained so much weight_ I have carefully weaned myself off.  My doctor  never warned me of any of the side effects and in my opinion_ the pros vs cons convinces me... it is not worth it.  My blood pressure has already gone back to normal_ my voice is still pretty good but my weight really concerns me for the possibility of heart problems.,F,60,360  days80mg ExRel 1X D,5/21/2012,Inderal
39, 4, Anxiety_ Panic Attacks_ OCD,Foggy and slower thinking_ memory slower_ a little dizzy and more tired_ slower heart rate_ perhaps a little harder to breathe_ loose stool (some diarriah). Caused slight tremor in my eyelids about 2 hours after taking at higher dosages.,Really helped stop my anxiety and panic attacks. So much so that I was losing motivation at higher dosages. This medicine is best taken for anxiety at a very low dosage_ perhaps only 5 MG twice daily_ then more as needed before a speech or performance.,M,44,6  months10 MG 2X D,5/5/2012,Inderal

45, 1, Headaches,This medicine is evil.  It caused me to go into a deep depression so bad that I almost lost my marriage and my life.  My wife kept telling the doctor over months that I was getting more depressed and he told me to think happy thoughts.  Finally she got me to another doctor that changed my meds.  Now I am two months off of inderal and I still have to take Prozac to try to balance out my head.  The doctor said that it may take as long as I was on the medicine to get me back to normal.  It made my mind grab onto hurtful things from the past and made them feel as though it had just happened.  The doctor said that it created a post traumatic stress disorder.  Luckily my wife held on to me and forced the issue to get me the help I needed because I was completely done living.  I have never had depression so I didn't realize that there was anything wrong with me.  Thank god my wife did.,Do not take this Medicine or if you do please have someone watch you for signs of depression.,M,45,7  months80mg 2X D,3/17/2012Email,Inderal

My heart doesn't feel like it's going to beat right out of my chest when I get nervous.  Overall_ I'm completely satisfied!

However_ I didn't begin to blame the drug until recently and uncovered websites such as this with descriptions of these side effects.  I just thought I was getting older.  It did lessen the frequency of headaches_ no question.  However_ if this weight gain and feeling lousy are due to the drug_ there is no question that it is not worth it.  I have recently started weaning off and will see how I feel.  I'm hoping that I will begin feeling better_ but am so angry that I have felt so miserable for so long_ and no doctor ever warned me about these possible side effects_ or suggested this drug might be the cause.,F,53,4  years80 mg er 1X D,7/27/2011Email,Inderal

I was taking 20MG twice initially then reducded to 10MG twice a day. With this dosage HR is 60 to 65 anf feel less fatigue.. With time wish to reduce the dosage and take only when i have the panic attacks,Very good drug as it has helped in my Work_ else my panic would have kept me in Bed. Along with the drug you need to 1) Excercise every day for atleast 60 minutes2) Avoid Caffine and other junk food. 3) take at the same time and plan on the time. The most stressed time for me is in the afternoon 2Pm to 5PM at work so i am taking the pills in the afternoon and night. This works out well.,M,35,5  years10 2X D,6/24/2011Email,Inderal

However trade off is worth it not to tremor so badly. It keeps them to a minimum so that I am able to work. Weight gain was a concern because of feeling tired a lot you don't get the activity level. I do have to manage my weight because of this. I try to watch what & how much I eat especially when I notice any weight gain. It can creep up on you fast.

63, 1, pounding heart,none when I first started it_ as I increased dose all hell broke loose!,Was on only one 10 mg per day. Then about a few months in had to go up to 4- 10mg a day. So only 40 mg. At 40 mg. I started getting weird vibrations in my head. Not hearing_ feeling them. Like someone took a belt sander and hit on for a second. They would come and go _ but all day long and very scary. I then thought what did I do different 7 weeks ago when they started. I realized it was when I upped this med. I then decreased it to 2 a day. Vibrations were lessened. Today is the first day I have take 0 of this stuff and I have only gotten one little vibration. No where near what I had before. I will not go on it again. If anyone has this let me know!!! I hope it gets outta my system soon!,F,54,4  months10 mgs 4X D,3/27/2011Email,Inderal
64, 5, migraine,No bad side effects so far,When I initially feel a migraine coming on_ I immediately take 80 mg inderal and 20 mg valium. END OF STORY. Within 20 to 25 minutes all aura symptoms disappear and NO HEADACHE. Amazing_ it works every time_ but just the inderal alone or the valium alone will not do it. I have to take both and it took me about 20 years to figure this out.,M,45,6  years80 mg 1X AN,3/19/2011,Inderal

At the 10th year I gained 20 pounds all of the sudden and it didnt control my BP anymore,Im a nurse. Here's what can happen--as you get older sometimes the med will turn on you. Your body basically rejects it. I switched to Ateninol and lost 20 pounds in a month and half. Astonishing. Dont be afraid to switch drugs.

68, 5, suffered migrane for 30 odd years.,initialy tingling in hands_ not sure if the Inderal or life circumstances are causing sadnes / depression. Maybe both,Inderal has been a miracle cure for me. Almost immediately the migraines ceased. I take one before bed (I believe the most important one) and at midday. No side affects like weight gain or lethargy but I play tennis weekly ang go to gym twice a week. The only time I get them now is when I have a headcold. for some reason that triggers the migraine behind the eyes. Once it would only take sleeping in_ bright light_ exercise or stressful situations to set off the 3 day headache. If only I had found a doctor who knew this 30 years ago! I'm going to discuss the sadnes with him and also if it's worth weaning myself off them overtime. Hopefully my body has broken the rebound cycle.,M,55,2  years40mg 2X D,12/27/2010,Inderal

Slowed digestion/sleeping guts_ dry mouth.,I decided to try this for my excess of serotonin and all the headache_ fatigue_ blood sugar problems plus anxiety_ aggression_ and paranoia that comes with it. The very first dose_ I felt so healthy and normal for the first time in years. It was beautiful to be happy and feel good again! But now after only 4 days the debilitating tiredness is robbing me of the power to do anything I need to be doing. As a student_ this is not an option for me and I am just lucky I have school break now.    I'll have to try something else instead even though I liked how it stopped me from beign so wired and angsty all the time.

I couldn't cut back calories anymore or I'd be starving. I'm so disappointed because I was put on Inderal after I had lost 50 lbs... I ended up gaining 20 back.

Within a week my headaches were gone and I was headache free the entire time I took it. It also calmed me down_ and prevented panic attacks. It was a miracle drug for me initially. However I gained 10 pounds (which I lost once I stopped taking the drug). I also started to feel depressed_ tired (I was falling asleep at the wheel) and I lost all motivation. The side effects were just too much for me so I stopped taking the drug.

Postural dizziness with heart pounding in ears.,"I am and RN and my PCP started me on this for migraines.  I had also been having untreated palpitations and panic attacks for several years and mild hypertension.  Propranolol has helped with all of those symptoms.  ANXIETY: I have not ""boiled over"" to a full on attack since I started this med (used to have general low level of anxiety 60% of the time_ and an attack about once a month or so_ now NONE).  PALPITATIONS: I also notice far fewer heart palpitations (from at least one episode daily to maybe one every 3-4 weeks now).  I get a bad headache when I miss a dose and one time missed both doses in a day and had a bunch of palpitations and even chest pains.  Considering going off this med (with MD direction and gradually of course) due to the weight gain and fatigue.

80, 4, Migraine,I didn't think i was suffering side effects_ but now after being almost weaned off I have changed my mind_ I guess the side effects creeped up on me.  I now believe inderal could have been contributing to weight gain and inability to lose weight_ (lost 2lbs without trying in 3 weeks since cutting my dose)_ lethargy_ heart palpitations_ dry and itchy eyes_ blurred vision_ minor depression_ and cold extremities.  It also lowered my heart rate and blood pressure below a normal level.  However_ the effect it had on my migraines was amazing_ but perhaps 4-5 years is too long to take this drug. I haven't noticed any negative reactions to coming off the drug slowly_ in fact i feel better for it.,I started by taking 80mg per day about 4-5 years ago at a time when i was suffering migraines about 50% of the time and a general headache all the time.  It worked wonders and within a month i remembered what feeling normal was again after such a long time! After a few years and an increased frequency of tension headaches my doctor suggested i up my dose to 160mg per day_ which i did_ this helped initially_ but the headaches started to break through after about 6 months.  (I now question the advice to double my dose).  I've now been switched to 10mg amitriptyline per day which i took for a month before beginning to cut my dose of inderal_ first cutting it to 80mg per day for 10 days_ then 40mg for 2 weeks_ now i'm going to take 20mg for a while and then stop altogether.,F,26,4  years80-160mg 1X D,7/31/2010,Inderal

I have suffered from severe migraine all my life and I have tried all with no help.

About a year later I reduced my dosage to 80mg_ and a few years later was able to stop completely.  Still have a very slight tremor but it has improved greatly.  The main reason I stopped was because I noticed my hair thinning.  I'm only 26 years old and there is no history of thinning or hair loss in my family.

Of course I was desperate to try anything to relieve my migraines so I tried it.  I was on it for 9 days and it literally very nearly killed me.  I was so sick these 9 days_ I thought I had stomach flu.  Where my liver is_ it was painful and felt like something poking me in the ribs from inside_ I could not get comfortable. I was bloated and sooooo tired.  I could not walk more than 10 steps without being short of breath and felt like I had ran a marathon.  A week before I took this medicine_ I ran 4 km with no problems and certainly no shortness of breath then.  My heart rate was incredibly slow the whole time too.  I could kick myself for not cluing in sooner that it was the medicine making me feel like this.  After I stopped_ within 3 days I felt so much better_ almost 90%.  I could not stop urinating after stopping this medicine_ I had so much fluid build up I could not believe how much came out.  My liver and ribs felt better after I stopped too.  This is a powerful heart medication and should not have been prescribed so easily and without cautioning me about it_ first from the doctor and then pharmacist_ neither of them explained what it was and what it could do.

I have had tremors in my hands and sometimes limbs that started in my teen years. I am an artist and it make drawing and painting very difficult. I was also a server and a bartender_ who spilled drinks all over people because I shook so badly. It was humiliating! It really affected all areas of my life and it took years until I found a doctor to diagnose me. I had been coping with alcohol and xanax to get the shakes down. I have also had pretty bad social anxiety and this helped some in that a big part of my social anxiety was because I was afraid people were going to be able to tell I was nervous. This drug alleviates all nervous symptoms... shaking hands_ shaking voice_ sweating_ heart rate. It is truly amazing.

The migraines were previously under control with 50 mg of Atenolol daily...however_ after a year on this drug_ it ceased working (thus starting this 6 month ordeal).  One of the subsequent drugs I tried was Propranolol (varied between 80 & 160 mg per day)_ and it worked for a few weeks to keep the headaches at bay.  Then the headaches came back worse than ever. This drug also made me feel completely hopeless and depressed after a few weeks of use...like I would be cleaning the house_ and would suddenly burst into hysterical tears for NO REASON WHATSOEVER...the scariest side effect I've ever had from a beta blocker.  I'll deal with the headaches and vertigo rather than have the depression I experienced on this drug...hopefully I'll find one that works.  I've been off of it for several days_ and already feel much happier than I did during the month that I took it.

The sickening feeling was better than the pounding in my head though. Finally I went to a neurologist. I have tried Imitrex and Topomax_ neither worked. Inderal was my last resort before I was going to throw in the towel and go to a chiropractor. Inderal has given me my life back! I still get minor headaches_ but they don't take over my life. I am able to cope with anxiety without stressing too much. The Inderal makes me calmer.

I've been on it for about a year_ at 160 mg. The first few months_ I experienced fatigue and dizziness_ but this passed after a few months. The biggest challenge has been in regards to weight. I've lost 60 lbs over the last few years_ and have about 20 to go. The Inderal pretty much stopped my slow but steady weight loss in it's tracks. It's very difficult to lose any weight_ and I've actually gained abouot 10lbs. It seems to slow down my metabolism_ and make me crave carbs more than usual.

Nothing else to report...I feel really good!,I suffer from daily_ horrible_ crippling headaches and have done since a young age.  I have tried everything.  Literally.  From chiropractic treatment to accupuncture and everything else in between and pretty much pumped every drug into my system.  I read a post on this site from a fellow sufferer so based on that I forced my doctor to put me on it (I was at the end of my tether and was willing to try anything at that point after having a headache for a solid six weeks_ waking up with it first thing and going to bed with it and taking Relpax and Arcoxia daily and it not even taking the edge off - She wasn't too keen but I made her as I wanted to try anything).  I've only been on it for a week-and-a-half but already I feel like a completely different person and have only had one really bad headache since taking the drug.  I still have a daily ache but its nowhere near as intense as it normally is and this has definitely taken the edge off the pain. I cannot tell you how this has effected me_ just not being in constant pain has really given me a new lease of life.  Its obviously still early days so hopefully it can just get better from now onwards...I would recommend trying this drug and really hope it works for you as it seems to have done for me!,F,32,13  days,9/14/2009Email,Inderal
108, 4, heart palpitations,I'm taking 10mg of Inderal twice a day for heart palpitations and the side effects that I experience are insomnia_ dry eyesnumbing of my arms and hands_ almost like someone put rubber bands around them and very vivid dreams along with extreme tiredness,For me_ the benefits of the medicine far outweigh the side effects_ because when the heat palps start they're really bad,F,44,2  weeks,9/7/2009Email,Inderal
109, 5, Migraines,Absolutely none!,I have tried nearly everything over the course of 10 years to relieve migraines from headache medicines_ epidurals_ daily chiropractic visits_ weekly massages_ diet change_ acupuncture_ yoga_ but none of these things have helped me like the 60mg of Inderal I now take daily. Inderal has been an absolute miracle. In fact_ I get tears in my eyes from the relief I now have after suffering from headaches 4-5 times a week. I do not have any side effects_ in fact_ I have ran 2 full marathons and several half marathons since I have been taking Inderal (2 years). I will take Inderal for the rest of my life_ but it is a godsend. If you are a migraine sufferer_ please try Inderal as it has dramatically changed my life for the better!!! :),F,31,2  years,7/23/2009Email,Inderal

111, 4, Daily migraine,Daytime sleepiness_ lucid dreams (like tripping on acid)_ depression_ increased difficulty achieving goals during workout routine.,Have suffered from chronic migraines with aura for 16 months (possibly due to menopause). Had icepick pain in left temple and left shoulder every day. Neuro had me up to 200 mg of topamax per day_ and all it did was take the edge off the pain. My docs are lucky I have a high pain threshold_ otherwise I'd be hooked on Fioricet by now. Currently_ I take 60mg Inderal 2X per day_ and I have only needed to take an abortive med. for migraine less than a handful of times in the last month. This drug is a GODSEND_ but it is not without caveats. I cry a lot more. I have to FORCE myself to exercise_ when I used to love to run every day. I am having to increase my dosage levels of Prozac and Wellbutrin to compensate for the increased sadness. Hopefully Inderal will help me get through this chemical war that is being waged in my body...ready to be on the other side of it...,F,41,30  days,7/6/2009Email,Inderal
112, 5, Migranes/ fast heart rate,None,I've been taking this drug for about 10 years. I do not notice any side effects that anyone here is talking about. I take 200 mg a day. My hair is thinning_ I've put on a little weight_ my cholesterol is up and my memory seems to be worse.. but all of these things can be contributed to age as I started taking this drug when I was 30 and didn't have any of these issues until just the last 2 years after a hysterectomy. I also have noticed that as long as I excersise everyday and eat well I can drop any extra weight. But there again_ getting older_ metabolism naturally slowing down. No vivid dreams_ have never noticed a calming effect and went from a migraine everyday to one every 3 months or so. Do not like it with Topamax_ that causes severe numbness in arms and legs_ severe enough that it's actually painful.,F,40,10  years,6/17/2009,Inderal
113, 3, Complex Migranes,Tiredness_ lethargy_ vivid dreams/nightmares_ mental slowness_ mild depression. A little weight gain_ but I think that is more due to lack of energy leading to lack of exercise.,Taking Inderal LA_ 60mg once a day to prevent complex migranes (migranes w/ stroke symptoms). No migranes since taking meds_ but massive loss of energy and tiredness. Since the complex migranes were a one time occurance_ thinking about asking my neurologist to lower the dosage.,M,29,11  days,5/21/2009,Inderal
114, 2, Migranes,Exhaustion & breathing issues. EXTREME short term memory loss. Lost ability to exert myself in any way (couldn't walk a flight of stairs w/o resting).  After MANY physical & imaging tests and a psychological battery_ we determined it was this causing the problem.,Helped my Migraines greatly.  Also helped PTSD issues and gave a general sense of calmness.

Stopped when quit drinking 25 yrs. ago.,Essential Tremors are a horrible progressive disease that most doctors' have no clue about. I took Inderal when ET really onset 12 yrs ago again along w/ valium. Inderal didn't seem to do anything_ but the valium did stop the tremors. Worse during day when pressure was highest. Took for 5 more years ... major weight gain ... stopped. Increased meds to Topamax (excellent)_ Tranxene and Valium. ET's are staying constant but docs' are getting sqeeky about their licenses and cutting back on the benzos'. So_ adding Inderal again and cutting back on benzos'. Scares the hell out of me. I never got hooked though since I took the bezos prn. If no big day_ 1 dose_ big day_ full dose or more. Highly relate to ET sufferer about 4 down from me who posted in mid-March. Both of my parents' progressively became alcoholics' and died early from alcohol related disease .. at least one (probably mother) self-medicating FAMILIAL TREMORS.,M,55,3  days,4/7/2009Email,Inderal

Someone told me my eyes looked watery.,"this medication has worked wonders for controlling the ""flight or fight"" impulse associated with public speaking.  i only use it when i know i am going to give a speech or presentation or when I'll need to actively participate in meetings.  only downside is being tired a few hours after taken.  only need 10mg or even less.  but since it only treats the symptoms of anxiety_ I am going to tackle getting over my actual fear/phobia.  i may not always have the pill handy in unforeseen situations.",F,33,4  years,4/4/2009,Inderal

No shaking_ stammering_ panic.  However_ I don't like the side-effects_ so try to only take it in really high-stress situations!  I take 10 mg for big events (speeches_ presentations_ musical performance)_ 5 mg for meetings_ etc.  I don't mind being a little nervous_ but have had one too many public speaking bombs and found myself saying ""no"" too much.

124, 5, Migraines,I'm having vivid dreams and diffuculty sleeping.  No weight gain at all.,Taking 80 mg once a day and I'm absolutely ecstatic that it's greatly reduced the number and intensity of my migraines.  I've had them all my life.  2 to 3 a week and now I'm down to the one hormonal headache a month!  I occasionally feel a migraine coming on at other times_ but it's never full blown and usually caused by a known trigger.  Triptans side effects are much nastier and unsafe.  I'm glad my PCP suffers migraines and is very sympathetic to the best treatment that works for me.  I didn't get that from my neurologist!,F,43,6  weeks,2/4/2009,Inderal

Was awakened within the first few nights of taking this drug by weird and disturbing dreams.  Noticed tingling and numbness in my fingers and toes as well.  The last straw was waking up with a skin rash across my chest_ shoulders and back.  I know my doctor is trying to be proactive in preventing migraines before they occur_ but this drug is not for me.  Although sumatriptans are a reactive solution to a migraine_ the inderal is just not worth the side-effects.,F,31,7  days,2/2/2009,Inderal

127, 5, High blood pressure when stressed,Vivid dreams_ vision changes (light sensitive),I was a cardiac nurse and feel this is one of the most manageable beta blockers out there - been around forever.  It can be easily titrated (adjusted) to your needs.  My suggestion is (with the doctor's ok_ of course) is to take you blood pressure frequently and adjust the dose accordingly.  I have had horrible side effects with Bystolic_ Altace_ even Metroprolol.  I take 10-20mgs in the am and 10mgs pm.  If Bp low I take less.  A large dose would put me completely out of commission.

My PCP prescribed Inderal 60 mg because I also suffer from migraines primarily during periods that are debilitating. He told me to take it at night due to it causing fatigue however it COMPLETELY knocked me out. My family had a very difficult time waking me and I basically become a zombie after taking it. I am freezing cold wherever I go. I feel like a shell of the person I used to be. I don't feel much ambition for work or my life in general. I have 2 young sons that I need to be available to and I just don't like who I am on this medicine.

I have titrated up to 80 mgs since I started taking it due to migraines increasing and hope that I will not have to go any further up the chain_ I am considering not taking it anymore just to see if my metabolism gets jump started_ I often feel like a prisoner in my own body.,F,47,2  years,12/22/2008,Inderal

Recently diagnosed with essential tremors and Neurologist doubled dose to 80mg twice a day about 2 weeks ago. Extremely tired.,Tremors greatly reduced. Before was having trouble writing and using mouse for computer. Now much easier_ but hope exhaustion goes away as body adjusts to higher dose.  I had taken topomax initially to prevent migraines-- hated it-- made me STUPID!!!! It's also used for tremors and I'll avoid it at all costs.

136, 1, high blood pressure,HORRIBLE DEBILITATING TIREDNESS. After a yr of taking 10mg/2x per day_ HBP was rising_ so MD increased dosage to 60 mg timed-release/once per day. Most horrific drug experience of my life. Became a zombie_ demonic nightmares most nites for first time in life; all drives_ inc sexual_ disappeared. Couldn't work_ think_ be sexual_ plan anything_ lost interest in everything. 8 hrs sleep no longer enough. After 60 days not being able to get out of bed most days_ went back to 10 mg/2 x per day. Immediate relief_ but mind still fogs out. Creativity still diminished; feet/hands still go numb_ dizziness_ constipation_ graphic nightmares still a problem. Is this the only med's the prof's can come up with for HBP?? What a joke.,For the 60 days on increased dosage_ I suffered DEBILITATING HORRIFIC symptoms with no warning from MD. I'm shocked to read ALL my NEW symptoms listed in many other postings by people who aren't necessarily attributing their symptoms to this medicine. I'm shocked to read just how many people are being putting through this hell too for a solution for migraines_ not HBP!! Why is the medical community putting us through this?  After reading what I have_ I'm going back to my MD and making him answer a lot of questions_ first off_ why did he tell me he hadn't heard of my symptoms until now considering they seem pretty commonplace on these message boards!

I thought that the 40 was too strong..  I would feel sort of some strange sensation in my chest.  If I walked much at all-- even from the parking lot into the car-- I would feel really tired.  I was so hesitant to keep taking it and the migraines were still happening..  then after about 2 weeks I decided just to try it full on_ I decided I would take the full dose until my follow up appointment. The side effects went away in time.  It really took about 4 more weeks before I realized it was helping my migraines and also my daily headaches.  I now don't notice any side effects_ my body must have adjusted.  I recommend it_ but give it a long time to start working!,F,35,3  months,10/30/2008,Inderal

The scond time I took it I had terrible side affects that my Dr. and pharmasist said were unlike the effects of this dru. Basically I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I has hot and cold flashes_ epetitive thoughts similar to OCD that persisted for years after stopping INDERAL. I also had severes panic attacks. I had to go off after a couple of weeks. No one could explain the strange reaction and even told me I was exagerating which was very frustrating.,Will never take this again_ or anything in this class of drugs_ even though I need the benefits it may be able to produce. So scarey that it triggered years of fears regarding taking any medication again.,F,44,2  weeks,10/8/2008,Inderal
139, 5, migraine,Lethargy_ weight gain_ high cholesterol and triglycerides_ vivid dreams,I've taken Inderal for 15 years to prevent daily classic migraines with visual aura.  I could not function without this med but have had to increase dosage over the years from 60mg LA QD to about 100mg LA QD at present (I remove graines from capsules to reduce dosage).  Now my cholesterol and TGs are very high and I suspect beta-blocker because my diet is healthy - low fat and low carb.  I recently added 300mg CQ-10 QD and it helps greatly with the brain fog and lethargy and prevented the necessity to increase dosage of inderal again.

Of all the drugs I have taken (and I've been on prozac since 1993) to control my depression and horrible pervasive anxiety_ besides the prozac_ Inderal has been a wonder drug.  I know I'm off the bell curve here_ but of trileptal_ ativan_ xanax_ clonipine_ cymbalta and_ god help us_ modafanil at $10 a pill_ this cheap ancient drug has helped me more than anything.  I take it PRN_ 10-20 mg one to three times a day_ and I feel calm and rational.  I think it is best for people who have very high resting sympathetic tone (those of us who sweat_ yell_ and think that 5 days is way too long to wait for a gun permit).

Once I gained the weight_ I remained stable (weight-wise)_ but now_ I would love to lose 15 pounds and can't.  I eat much less than I did when I was trying to gain (I now consume about 1800 calories/day as opposed to 3500 prior to inderal) and stay at a  consistent 160 lbs (I am a woman 5 feet 8 inches).  I would love to lose even 10 pounds_ and can not.  I do have VIVID dreams....sometimes nightmare-like_ but I rather enjoy this aspect of the drug.

156, 3, PVC's_ Migraines_ Anxiety,Tiredness at first_ went away quickly. Taking 20 mg's twice daily.,Works really well to quell the pvcs and helps somewhat with anxiety_ although if the anxiety is bad I need Xanax as well. For the migraines it has done nothing_ but to be fair I am probably not taking a high enough dose. Don't think I could handle more due to low blood pressure.,F,,3  months,4/9/2008Email,Inderal
157, 3, Migraine,Extreme weight gain :(  Went from 118 lbs to 140 in 7 weeks.  IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT ON THIS DRUG PLEASE EMAIL ME @ THETAOISINU@HOTMAIL.COM!!!!!  I think it slows your metabolism.  Also I get winded easily_ so it's hard to exercise.,At first it did help with the severity of my migraines.  It took them down to migraines almost every day (I had to get FMLA from work)  to a moderate headache with migraine maybe once a week.  I am on 80 mg twice a day.  Now the migraines are coming back.  I'm not sure if I can go up higher due to the weight gain.,F,28,7  weeks,4/2/2008Email,Inderal
158, 3, headache prevention,none,i was on propranolol at 60mg_ twice a day_ for about a month. it worked for a little while_ then just stopped working. it's a good drug though because there's the smallest chance of side effects.,F,19,1  months,3/25/2008,Inderal
159, 3, for tremors and anxiety,Felt quite tired and had a sort of sureal feeling. Concentration was poor and did not sleep well,I did what it was supposed to do in my case_eased the anxiety and took away the tremors but I think the strength was too high 40mg. Will go back to doctor and ask to try 10mg.,F,534,4  days,3/12/2008,Inderal

161, 3, sinus tachycardia,It makes me soooooo tired! I have constipation also_ possibly related to inderal_ but not sure yet.,I am taking 10 mg 2x a day_ and it just makes me so tired_ I can barely do my normal routine_ and normally I am always_ always on the go. It does help with keeping my heart rate at 100 or below. I also have anxiety and stress which my dr. thinks brought on the sinus tachycardia. Though it helps to relax me somewhat_ it does not rid me of my anxiety. So even though I am so very tired_ I am still jittery and nervous at the same time. It's weird. I have only been taking this for three days_ so I will post again when I have been taking it longer if there are any other adverse effects. I am also taking xanax as needed_ and the combination of the two seems to be helping me. I only wish I wasn't so darn tired from the inderal! I do take the inderal on it's own in the am_ and do not take the xanax as frequently_ so I know for sure it's that making me so tired. I do hope it subsides.,F,31,3  days,1/26/2008,Inderal
162, 5, Migraine/Tension Headache,Slight Weight gain_ reduced erectile status. Reduced ability to undertake extended strenuous exercise as my heart rate refuses to climb to meet the blood demand.,But then again I was oversexed_ over-aggressive_ too skinny and getting headaches every few days so all of the above side-effects are perfectly acceptable. Tried weaning myself off it a couple of times and became wired/shaky/pounding heart/nervous so I guess it will be with me for life.,M,44,14  years,1/19/2008,Inderal

164, 4, Migraines,Rapid weight gain (40 lbs 6 months)with lack of energy to exercise_ heart palpitations_ extreme fatigue,I have had migraines since I was 18 yrs old.  Sometimes migraines would last 2-3 days without relief in sight.  No medications that I was prescribed made as much of a difference as Inderal.  Migraines are rare now and I only take 60mg daily.  I only wish that the weight gain was not a side effect.,F,43,3  years,1/5/2008,Inderal

167, 4, migraines,weight gain_ sexual dysfunction,Taking 160mg LA.  Reduced migraines from 3 a week to less than 2 a month_ which I successfully treat with Maxalt when I feel them coming on.  To be fair_ if I led a less stressful life_ I would have fewer still.  I gained about 20 lbs since taking inderal that I haven't been able to shed & keep off.  Over the past year_ I've noticed decreasing sexual desire_ and most recently_ bouts of impotence.  I can't say for certain whether it's the inderal causing the sexual dysfunction or whether it's just because I'm getting older.  I'm very grateful to be without the migraines_ but I'd like to have my sex life back.,M,41,3  years,10/19/2007,Inderal
168, 4, taken PRN for panic attacks,slight loss of mental acuity_ loss of focus_ fatigue_ possible short-term memory loss,"While it might not help the mental sensations associated with panic attacks_ it works wonders on the physical symptoms: no sweaty palms_ no racing heart_ no hyperventilation_ etc...  However_ I find that it dulls my mind a bit.  I have slower recall and reaction time_ and I find myself ""spacing out"" a bit for about an hour after I take it. I only use this drug PRN (""as needed"") before taking exams or when I have to give public speeches_ so these side effects might only be incidental.",F,29,18  months,10/10/2007,Inderal

171, 5, Arrhythmia-PVC's;Mitral Valve Prola,None now.,I ended up in the ER 32 years ago with an arrhythmia (Premature Ventricular Contractions) and Mitral Valve Prolapse. It was was so bad that I would faint when I raised my hands above my head (washing my hair_ getting something down from a high shelf_ adjusting an IV flow rate).  This was not acceptable as I am an RN. I have been on Inderal since nursing school days which is 32 years ago.  Inderal gave me my life to live with no side effects. I am on 40 mg three times a day. I once was on it four times a day but I gradually reduced the one time because I don't like to take anything more than I need. I beleive in very gradually decreasing a medication.  I substituted one dose a week with 30 mg and then if successful I raised it to twice a week_ and then three times a week etc.  After I was on 30 mg for the one dosage I then repeated the process going down to 20 mg then 10 mg and then none. It takes awhile to get off of something but I have found the success rate to be very good.,F,51,32  years,7/10/2007,Inderal
172, 4, Severe Migraine,"Slow_ pounding heart. Breathlessness.  Tiredness and fatigue.  Dry eyes.  Embarrassing short term memory loss - sometimes I forget the names of everyday items.  Very upsetting weight gain - over 14 lbs in 5 months and as I still don't feel up to exercising_ I can't lose it.  A general feeling of not feeling ""quite right"".",Although I am definitely suffering some unpleasant side effects this drug has been wonderful in that I now at least have some quality of life.  The tiredness is a problem as I work and have 3 children.  Before this drug my life was hardly worth living with migraines so severe I had to have emergency medical treatment on several occasions.  I am at least mostly pain free now and haven't had a full-blown migraine attack since starting the drug.  I'm on an 80mg slow release once a day tablet - which I have found better than remembering to take smaller doses throughout the day.  I would recommend anyone try it for severe migraine - but ONLY agree to it if it is a last resort and you have tried other things first.,F,45,6  months,6/16/2007,Inderal
173, 5, Migraine,Weight gain - approx 35lb. Very vivid dreams. Some insomnia. Tiredness in afternoons. Cold feet and hands. Breathlessness when walking up hills (this might be due to the weight gain though).,Taking Inderal LA 80. I find that this drug works very well in controlling my headaches. It also has the side effect of making me very calm - people remark that I always seem to be bomb-proof_ never panicking_ even when the going gets tough! The weight gain has been a problem. I have a very healthy diet_ but continue to gain weight. In all_ I would say that the benefits outweigh the problems. I've just been taken off this drug and started taking Ramipril today. I'm hoping that this will also help me to lose some of the weight I gained while on Inderal. If I don't feel that Ramipril are an improvement_ I may go back onto Inderal.,F,50,10  years,6/4/2007,Inderal
174, 5, anxiety & migraines,Perhaps a little insomnia and fatigue at first.  Nothing now.,Have been taking Inderal for about 5 days now_ 40mg 2xper day.  It has done wonders for my anxiety.  I was suffering extreme panic/anxiety attacks which kept me at home unable to go anywhere or do anything.  I also suffer horrible migraines too so after trying many SSRI's (which didnt suit me at all) the doc decided to try Inderal to combat both the anxiety and migraines.  I'm like a new person - going out_ socialising again and the horrible physical symptoms of anxiety have almost gone. No more delibating migraines either. Now I can concentrate on looking after myself_ exercising again and enjoying myself once again.,F,33,5  days,6/2/2007,Inderal
175, 5, Public Speaking,None as yet. I only take it as & when needed.,I have had some very embarassing situations when giving presentations. Like I could not complete it and just stop and freeze on stage.. I once had to just hang up in middle of a phone conference during my talk.. Taking inderal 1.5 hours before I give a talk has worked like magic for me. The relief that I have now found a solution to my phobia is the best part!,M,34,3  months,5/27/2007,Inderal
176, 5, Migraines,A bit tired but cannot sleep at night_ erectile dysfunction.,I have been dealing with migraines since I was about 6 or 8 years old not properly diagnosed until I was in 6th grade.  I have tried many drugs and they usually work when I just get the migraine_ but recently I was waking up with them so the drugs were not helping.  For the past two months I have not had any.  Life with the migraines was so disrupted I think I am willing to deal with the side effects.,M,40,2  months,5/20/2007,Inderal
177, 5, Migraines,For the first month or so I had a lot of problems sleeping...I was waking up exactly 5 hours after taking the Inderal. The doctor switched me from taking the pills 12 hours apart to 6-7 hours apart (9 am and 3 pm). I started sleeping better and now have no sleeping problems (none after 5 weeks or so). At first I also was having some vivid dreams...went away.,My Migraines are GONE. I haven't had a migraine in 9 weeks (been on Inderal 10)!!! I haven't gone more than 7-10 DAYS without a migraine since I was 14 years old. This is amazing. I'm really glad I stuck it out for the first month because I really thought I was going to have to stop taking Inderal due to the side effects. Now the side effects are gone and I don't have to worry every day about when the next migraine will hit. When you've lived your whole teen & adult life never knowing if you'll have a migraine the next day the FREEDOM is amazing.,F,32,10  weeks,5/11/2007Email,Inderal
178, 3, migraines_ tension headaches,weight gain 15lbs in 3 months_ lack of energy,I've was taking 60mg originally_ but just got up to 120mg.  My migraines are thought to be hormonal so it's not much help for those but in the last few weeks I have noticed a change in the frequency of my headaches.  I was getting about 4 a week and I've only had about 1 a week for the last 3 weeks. I think the higher dose is working for me.,F,24,4  months,5/10/2007,Inderal
179, 5, Severe migraines,Drowsiness_ severe dizziness if I get up too quickly after taking it (I have low blood pressure)_ bloating_ some loss of creativity_ more memory loss than usual_ strange scalding/burning sensation in my mouth and down my throat (not sure it's this drug),I've been suffering from near constant migraines for years and this has taken a lot of the severity away_ making it so I can function better.  I take 60 mg at night_ which makes the drowsiness/dizziness easier to handle_ and had been losing weight at an alarming rate before taking it (although that's started again).  I've also noticed that a lot of the tremours in my legs from a separate back injury subsided_ which was a pleasant surprise.  As far as vivid dreams go_ I've always been blessed with them so that hasn't changed.  I do find myself waking often some nights with one obsessive thought running through my head over and over.  It's usually something I have absolutely no interest in_ which is really irritating.,F,42,3  months,5/9/2007,Inderal

Blood pressure is down to normal_ before on average it would be 160/110_ started out 80 mg a day of Inderal_ now down to 20 mg a day. So no side effects. Doctor had to add cymbalta because of my major depression and I feel sooo much better. So far have lost 11 pounds which is a good thing.,F,55,4  months,5/7/2007,Inderal
182, 5, daily migrains/tension headaches,heartburn,I was told that it could take up to 4 wks to see results.

I've been put on 4 other meds before this and this works wonders. I feel so great thanks to this med.,F,25,3  days,4/27/2007,Inderal
183, 5, migraine,Constipation seems to be my main issue. Not sure if it effects weight gain_ but I started a weight loss (good diet) program the same week I started taking the meds_ and I have managed to lose 10 lbs in 2 months regardless. I do need a lot of sleep_ but not too tired to exercise 4x per week for 30 minutes. I also dream a lot but no bad nightmare.,I have not had a migraine in 2 months_ when I was sure to get at least 1-2 per week before. I also had hypertension_ and it has taken that under control too.,F,49,60  days,4/10/2007,Inderal
184, 5, performance anxiety,none,Have only taken this twice to give presentations. It definitely kept the pounding heart_ blushing_ and stage-fright brain freeze at bay. You don't feel at all drugged_ you just feel like a normal person instead of a palpitating wreck. I have a lot of job interviews and other anxiety causing events approaching_ so my doc gave me this just to get over that hump. Just started taking Buspar for social anxiety_ so hopefully once that kicks in fully_ I won't need the Inderal(I know it has more potential for side effects-like hair loss). But for now_ the Inderal provides some much needed calm,F,33,2  days,4/9/2007,Inderal

Never again after that.,My tremors had been tolerable for many years_ then at age 36 they increased in my hands and head.I couldn't sign a check or hold a fork anymore.The Inderal slowed the tremors until they're only noticeable if I'm late for a pill or had too much caffeine.  Inderal has given me the ability to lead a quality life.I take one 80mg. tablet three times per day.Bonus--No more migrains or racing heart beats!,F,55,19  years,3/16/2007,Inderal

Always tired never feel like I have a lot of energy.,It has really helped me with the migraines I use to wake up with them almost everyday and now I get one about twice a month and they are not as severe.

The quality of my life was not good.  If was affecting my family and work life.  Now after taking Inderal_ 10mg twice daily_ for 3 weeks I feel like I'm getting my life back!  I would recommend this medication to anyone who suffers from migraines.  I was also experiencing heart pounding at bedtime but the Inderal has   helped with that too.  The only drawback for me is that it does make me tired.  I would much rather be tired than sick in bed with a migraine though.,F,39,3  weeks,1/10/2007,Inderal

Then came the weight gain.30 POUNDS IN 3 MONTHS!!!After dozens of doctors telling me to lose weight (btw_ I have Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain_ so w/o pain management_ I CAN'T EXERCISE!) I decided to ween myself off of propanolol (REALLY not reccomended_ my father has extensive experience with it. Seriously_ don't do it unless you know what you're doing).I've been off it for a month_ I've lost 10 pounds_ the swelling's gone down_ and I have energy.I get a little dizzy every now and then_ but I feel great.*I don't reccomend this drug unless you REALLY need it*,,,3  years,11/23/2006,Inderal

Sense of calming and minor sleepiness but that also went away after the first week or so.,Helped my migraines immensely.  I was having 4-5 headaches a week for 6 months prior to taking Inderal.  They stopped almost immediately after I started taking the drug. 80mg twice a day.

I still cry easily (though this could be hormonal) and I find it difficult to lose weight (I gained 16 lbs since I started taking it_ but that was 23 years ago_ so it could be due to age).  My blood pressure is normal with it_ without it_ it goes to 180/120 also_ I used to suffer from horrible migraines almost on a daily basis_ now I get a small migraine before or during my period only.  For me the medicine was a godsend.  I had been suffering with migraines for at least 10 years and had been placed on codeine and other ineffective medications.

I usually take 40mg; migraines were previously weekly with nausea and vomiting and were uncontrolled by stong doses of codiene. The events were taking 1.5 to 2 days out of each week. My background use of panalgesices and codiene have been reduced by around 70%.,M,46,7  months,9/21/2005Email,Inderal
213, 5, anxiety,a bit tired,AMAZING take it if you have social anxiety....you will feel like a anew calm person..i will take it forever......little or no side affects....still have great sex life...taking 40mg twice daily...please talk to your doctor about it...IT HELPED ME SO MUCH,M,27,5  days,9/20/2005,Inderal
214, 5, tremors_ anxiety,Some eye fatigue,This has been a drug that has enabled me to just plain live life without fear of going out of control with the shakes.  I have had that problem since a young child.  When I read about Inderal 25 years ago and my doc prescribed it_ I was in awe!  25 years later it still works.  I take it only as needed.  The dose is only 10 mg.  The heart calms down_ the tremors don't even start.  It is a wonder drug for someone who manifests anxiety by shaking out of control.  The only drawback is it takes about 30 minutes to kick in.  I can usually predict when I may need one.  I probably take 3 or 4 tablets a week.,F,58,25  years,9/19/2005Email,Inderal
215, 5, migraine vertigo/dizziness,none (20 mg twice per day),I was dizzy 24/7 from migraine related vertigo for 8 months straight before starting Inderal. I can play the piano again and not fall over when I walk down the stairs. It has also helped make me a lot more calm. No side effects like tiredness or anything. I plan on staying on it as long as the doctor says it's okay. Highly recommend.,F,32,5  days,7/20/2005,Inderal

217, 4, essential tremor,Tunnel vision--could hardly read.  Some chest pain.  Depression which was very possibly unrelated.,The tremor (a twitch in my head) became less severe but would still come back on some days.  Chest pain after upping the dose worried me_ but the tunnel vision made me want to quit the most.  I've never seen it listed as a side effect_ but it's hard to believe I was just imagining it and it seems to have lessened as I reduced the dose.Either it reduced the tremor or made me stop noticing it.  I don't really care either way.,M,23,4  weeks,5/13/2005Email,Inderal
218, 5, Arrythmia_hypertension_tremors_migr,The positive effect of this medicine has been so overwhelming_ I really havent noticed any significant negative side effects.,I am taken a daily dose of 120mg..Body weight: 195_lean muscular build_6'1,M,40,2  years,5/7/2005,Inderal
219, 4, Migraines,Huge emotional volatility. Worst on first day_ better after 5 days,I've been taking this for 5 days and it has prevented 2 migraines I should have gotten (based on triggers). But the first day I took the medication I totally lost it emotionally over something at work that wasn't actually a very big deal. Crying_ wrote nasty rageful emails (thank god didn't send them)_ etc. The next day I didn't understand why I had been so upset--I definitely could see I had overreacted.  I have continued to have more moderate overreactions to negative things_ but not to that extent. (At least I can now hide my reaction from co-workers.) This type of overreaction is very much not like me. I plan to continue this medication for 3 weeks to gauge more fully its effectiveness and see if this side effect gets better.,F,37,5  days,4/18/2005,Inderal

222, 4, chest pain/heart murmur/valve defec,sleepiness about an hour after taking_ reduction of anger!,My husband was given this drug due to a valve defect that causes him severe chest pain_ body aches and bad circulation.  It has helped greatly with only small_ infrequent episodes of pain now.  If he forgets to take it the sypmtoms come back immediately.  One very nice side effect was to seriously calm his temper which we hadnt realized was all that out of control.  We call it the Happy Pill!  The only problem is that if he runs out he has overwhelming rage and small triggers.,M,31,3  months,2/6/2005,Inderal

229, 3, High blood pressure and Migraines,I have been very dizzy since starting this medication.  Other than that no side effects.,I started taking Inderal because I started getting high blood pressure when I was pregnant and I kept getting sick after I had the baby.  Every time I went to the Dr. My blood pressure was always 156/99 or higher.  We switched from Elavil to Inderal to help with my migraines and knock out my blood pressure problem at the same time.  It worked with the migraines pretty well at fist_ but then stopped_ I had to up the dose to 120mg.  Now my blood pressure is going up again.  Not sure if I will stay on it or not.,F,22,7  months,12/16/2004,Inderal

232, 5, performance anxiety (stage fright),slight mood changes when taken several days in a row,I am a professional musician (French horn) in a symphony orchestra and used to suffer from pounding heart_ shortness of breath_ dry mouth_ and shaking when playing exposed solo passages.  For years I was told that beta blockers turn you into a zombie with no creativity or artistry.  I have found it to be a godsend - my mind remains totally clear and focused_ and instead of having a negative effect on my creativity_ I now find I can communicate musically much better without all the shaking.  I only take 10mg a few times a month when the need arises_ so the chances of side effects are practically nil. Highly recommended.,F,34,2  years,9/29/2004,Inderal
233, 3, Restless Leg Syndrom,Often get dizzy as hell when I stand up after sitting for more than 10 minutes.  The kind of dizzy that makes you need to lean on something_ quickly.  Fortunately_ it only happens once or twice a day.,If helped a little the first month.  My episodes went from about every 40 seconds when I was resting to maybe a few dozen times a night.  Then Doc added Clonazepam and a little later Mirapex.  My symptoms are way down_ but still not completely controlled.,M,42,2  months,5/13/2004Email,Inderal
234, 3, pvc's,slow heart rate_ even after discontinuing use for 2 days,very effective for me in controlling pvc's.,M,35,5  days,1/11/2004,Inderal
235, 5, anxiety,Slight depressed mood if I take it regularly.,This drug helps me so much with the physical symptoms of anxiety.  It seems to stop my anxiety from spiralling out of control.  I only take it when I know I'm going to be in a situation which will cause higher levels of anxiety than what I usually feel. (I have general anxiety too.)  I can now do things I never thought I would be able to do as long as I remember to take my little pink pill about an hour before.  Exams have become annoying and inconvenient insted of terrifying_ I can talk in front of groups of people too_  still don't enjoy it_ but I can do it and remain intellegent and calm.,F,41,4  years,5/20/2003,Inderal
