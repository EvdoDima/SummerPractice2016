2, 5, anxiety_panic attacks and insomnia,None.,This has been a miracle drug for me. No more panic attacks or anxiety! Just your average day to day anxiety. I was on an antidepressant for 20 years and was able to get off of it. My antidepressant didn't work half as well! This wonder drug does a combination of things for me. To lowering my blood pressure_ fixing my heart problem_ and helping me to deal with my overall response to anxiety to any stressful situation! I just can't say enough for this wonder drug!,F,52,2  years60mg 2X D,4/12/2016,Inderal
3, 1, Hypertension,Severe diarrhea and headaches.,Controlled blood pressure. But I could not tolerate the side effects.,F,31,4  days40 x2 day,1/25/2016,Inderal
4, 2, Panic Disorder_ GAD,Low blood pressure_ hallucinations from not enough blood getting to my brain_ dizziness_ low heart rate_ fatigue,This is a dangerous drug if you are small and your blood pressure tends to run on the low end of normal like mine. My blood pressure was 70/50 on this drug and I almost got into a car accident because I started hallucinating while I was driving... I thought there was a house on the turnpike. This was because not enough blood was getting to my brain. I almost fainted several times because my heart rate got so low. It helped my anxiety but these side effects could have killed me. My doctor had the nerve to put me on two other blood pressure medications with the same results. He's not willing to put me on ativan because of a risk of addiction_ but he's willing to give me meds that could kill me? Go figure.,F,20,2  months10 mg 1X D,12/29/2015,Inderal
5, 3, Migraines_ tremor_ anxiety,tiredness_ lack of motivation_ aches and pains_ occasional shortness of breath_ not able to do any cardio exercise_ heart palpitations_ feeling of heaviness/weakness_ dizziness/light headedness if I get up too fast.,For anxiety it has worked wonders. Although it has taken a while to get used to some side effects (which cause anxiety). Physcial anxiety symptoms are gone. Overtime though_ I have noticed that it has helped less with migraines_ in fact not much at all now. Lack of motivation has increased_ and perhaps slight depression has set in. It also causes heart palpitations for me_ a few times a year_ that can last a few hours or re-occure over days. I have attempted to ween off these twice_ with major withdrawls and side effects_ so no luck there. I have also increased dosage due to increased migraines_ which helped - but caused heart palpitations within a day or two.Be careful with this one. I was once active_ playing sport and fairly healthy - but this kills your ability to do any cardio (limits the heart rate) and greatly effects your motivation. Its also very hard to get off this drug.,M,33,3  years20mg 1X D,12/20/2015Email,Inderal
6, 3, Anxiety,After prolonged use I had severe shortage of breadth_ leg and arm tingling_ severe fatigue_ headaches_ dizziness_ nausea and depression.

7, 3, slightly elevated BP and headaches,Sleepy but I take at bedtime; Stomach rumblings making more bathroom runs - not quite diarrhea but still annoying.  I have gained weight but just a few lbs - noticeable with clothes but I needed to start walking more anyway :)  Was already taking Gabapentin for headaches_ still am. This was added due to elevated BP.   So taking both I have no headaches. BP not down to where it needs to be yet.,I have the extended release if that makes a difference.  I am trying to give it a good month before I decide if it is worth the side effects.  I have one refill for another month but haven't decided if I will fill it yet.,M,42,3  weeks60 MG 1X D,6/11/2015,Inderal

9, 1, high blood pressure over active thy,I took 1 30mg pill at noon and less than an hour later I was nausea and sleepy. Felt as though I had been on a rollercoaster ride that spends non stop. I also began to feel lethargic and caught myself taking in large breaths of air and releasing slowing to calm my mind. By 9pm..The side effects were still severe. I went to bed and woke up at 1:00am to the worst stomach cramps and sharp pains in the back. It was non stop all through the night. Please be cautious of these things. If I had taking the recommended dosage of 60mg I definitely would of had to go to E.R.  After taking 30mg I couldn't drive my daughter to school or go to work the next day. I won't continue this medication.,,F,35,1  days20MG,4/23/2015,Inderal

I ate two average meals like normal_ but yet whopped on nearly 2 stone. Be careful not to suddenly stop these tablets it's very dangerous I went dangerously tachycardic_ even with a g.P's titration plan_ can cause nasty withdrawal side affects_ but it only lady's a few weeks.

22, 2, attempt at managing anxiety,Urinary retention_ weakness,The doctor was reluctant to prescribe this_ but I was desperate for something to help with my severe crippling anxiety.  But he was right_ it wasn't for me_ and it only gave about an hour of relief in the 4-hour duration of it's effect.  Still_ not worth it for me_ since I was so painfully bloated in that time from drinking water_ but not having to pee.This is better for those with high blood pressure.  Mine was too low at the time_ which was the main reason the doctor didn't want me on it.  My pulse and heart rate were okay_ though_ so I was able to convince him.I only took that one pill_ and then eventually threw the rest away.,F,42,1  times.10 mg 1X AN,10/25/2013,Inderal

I started off with 10mg 1x per day but was having very strange side effects (IE: Foggy head_ panic_ dizziness_ feeling faint) and I lowered my dosage to 5mg 1 x per day. This has helped my PAC's/PVC's tremendously. The only thing I dislike about this medicine is the half life. I feel it only works for maybe 5 hours before the effects disappear.

Neurology tried me on Inderal and have only had a handful of mild to moderate migraines since!   Most of those were due to having forgotten to take my med or waited too late.

38, 1, Essential Tremor,The first side effect I noticed occurred within the first week.  I had sleep terrors and hallucinations at night_ so bad that I let out blood curdling screams that scared my family to death.  This occurred intermittantly throughout the entire time I took the medicine.The second side effect I had was a feeling of heaviness.  And that makes sense:  I gained 30 pounded within the first few months!!  No matter how healthy I ate_ I continued to gain weight. The third_ rather strange side effect was that my blood pressure went up 30 points!  I actually have always had low normal blood pressure (108/70 generally).  My blood pressure jumped so high I couldn't believe it.The final side effect I had was extreme bloating and distension in my abdomen.,I actually had very little positive effect from the medicine.  My essential tremor had begun to affect my speaking voice in addition to having a jerk in my left arm and hand_ and shaky right hand and arms.  Once I began to take hte medicine_ the only thing I felt some relief with was in my speaking voice.  My hands continued to shake and my left arm continued to jerk.  My blood pressure jumped so much and I have gained so much weight_ I have carefully weaned myself off.  My doctor  never warned me of any of the side effects and in my opinion_ the pros vs cons convinces me... it is not worth it.  My blood pressure has already gone back to normal_ my voice is still pretty good but my weight really concerns me for the possibility of heart problems.,F,60,360  days80mg ExRel 1X D,5/21/2012,Inderal
39, 4, Anxiety_ Panic Attacks_ OCD,Foggy and slower thinking_ memory slower_ a little dizzy and more tired_ slower heart rate_ perhaps a little harder to breathe_ loose stool (some diarriah). Caused slight tremor in my eyelids about 2 hours after taking at higher dosages.,Really helped stop my anxiety and panic attacks. So much so that I was losing motivation at higher dosages. This medicine is best taken for anxiety at a very low dosage_ perhaps only 5 MG twice daily_ then more as needed before a speech or performance.,M,44,6  months10 MG 2X D,5/5/2012,Inderal

45, 1, Headaches,This medicine is evil.  It caused me to go into a deep depression so bad that I almost lost my marriage and my life.  My wife kept telling the doctor over months that I was getting more depressed and he told me to think happy thoughts.  Finally she got me to another doctor that changed my meds.  Now I am two months off of inderal and I still have to take Prozac to try to balance out my head.  The doctor said that it may take as long as I was on the medicine to get me back to normal.  It made my mind grab onto hurtful things from the past and made them feel as though it had just happened.  The doctor said that it created a post traumatic stress disorder.  Luckily my wife held on to me and forced the issue to get me the help I needed because I was completely done living.  I have never had depression so I didn't realize that there was anything wrong with me.  Thank god my wife did.,Do not take this Medicine or if you do please have someone watch you for signs of depression.,M,45,7  months80mg 2X D,3/17/2012Email,Inderal

My heart doesn't feel like it's going to beat right out of my chest when I get nervous.  Overall_ I'm completely satisfied!

However_ I didn't begin to blame the drug until recently and uncovered websites such as this with descriptions of these side effects.  I just thought I was getting older.  It did lessen the frequency of headaches_ no question.  However_ if this weight gain and feeling lousy are due to the drug_ there is no question that it is not worth it.  I have recently started weaning off and will see how I feel.  I'm hoping that I will begin feeling better_ but am so angry that I have felt so miserable for so long_ and no doctor ever warned me about these possible side effects_ or suggested this drug might be the cause.,F,53,4  years80 mg er 1X D,7/27/2011Email,Inderal

With time wish to reduce the dosage and take only when i have the panic attacks,Very good drug as it has helped in my Work_ else my panic would have kept me in Bed. Along with the drug you need to 1) Excercise every day for atleast 60 minutes2) Avoid Caffine and other junk food. 3) take at the same time and plan on the time. The most stressed time for me is in the afternoon 2Pm to 5PM at work so i am taking the pills in the afternoon and night. This works out well.,M,35,5  years10 2X D,6/24/2011Email,Inderal
