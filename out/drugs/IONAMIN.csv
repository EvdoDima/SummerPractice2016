0, 4, Weight loss/ energy,Extremely happy_ tons of energy_ problems sleeping.,"The first day I took this I was so full of energy I couldn't contain myself. I literally wanted to run up to everyone I saw and yell "" Good morning "" to them. I felt like an over excited puppy. Which isnt such a bad thing considering im usually very shy and anti social. I have not lost weight on it because I am not longer taking it.  However when I was I lost about 8 pounds in that month. I've always had issues sleeping so the lack of sleep wasn't too much for me considering I barely sleep as is. I loved the energy it gave me_ it made me feel very out going. But unfortunately I have an addictive personality and I knew I was enjoying it too much which is why I stopped taken it to keep from substance abuse. I would recommend to those who have tons of self control. An addict of any sort should stay away though",F,19,1  months,11/19/2015Email,Ionamin
1, 1, weight loss,couldn't sleep_emotional_excessive thirst_ headache,DO NOT TAKE! This is a pill from the devil. I've done all sorts of weight loss pills & this is bad. I couldn't sleep for about 2 weeks. Had severe unquenchable thirst_ slight shakiness & slight rapid heart beat. Became extremely depressed & sad_ crying about anything. Cried cause the wind blew my hair into my eyes_ & cause I dropped my pencil-seriously. I became very easily annoyed_aggravated & angry over the most petty things. I wasn't hungry & barely ate which was good. I only lost 3lbs in a week_ so I made myself eat a bit more & started exercising. I lost 8 lbs in 3wks_ but was miserable from the other side effects. I'm normally a fun joking person_ but became horrifically upset over everything & my crying was out of control_so I decided to quit taking. This pill is difficult to come off of_ so I took 1/2 pill/day to wean off. It took me OVER a year to rid my body of all the side effects. I would NOT recommend this pill to anyone & also told my Dr.,F,50,3  months30mg,2/5/2015,Ionamin

4, 3, first_ weight loss,dry mouth_ funny taste in my mouth_ sore tongue_ chewing lip_ gas,i really cannot say that i have lost a lost of weight with this.  i have taken it for over a year and since then have lost 9-10 pounds.  however_ i have some type of problem being able to stay awake in the daytime.  after starting this med the dr. told me to stay on it since it was keeping me from being so fatigued and wanting to just lie around.  that is one thing i can say_ it really gives you enery and i can't say that it makes me have heart flutters or anything like that and i REALLY have to be careful about anything that does make my heart flutter_ but so far_ no problems.  Just hope I see more weight coming off!,F,51,1  years,6/3/2008Email,Ionamin
5, 3, to loose weight,insomnia_ anxiety_ mood swings_ complete loss of appitite_ thirsty all the time_constant need to chew(make sure that you have plenty of chewing gum),this drug is very effective in assisting with weight loss but i urge you to be very careful that you are not replacing one addiction with another. I found it extremly difficult to stop taking this drug because it is just so much easier to take one pill every day than it is to find the time to excersise reguarly along with having to cook and plan a healthy diet also this drug works almost instantly and has amazing results diet and excersise takes time. Once you stop taking this drug you will most likely find that you are stacking on the pounds at a rapid speed. It does the job as i have lost half of my body weight  but be very_ very careful as it IS also an addictive drug!!,F,25,6  days,3/1/2008,Ionamin
6, 5, Weight loss,in the beginning_ maybe 2-3 wks my sleeping was worse than usual. took a really long time to fall asleep & then woke up about every 2 hrs the rest of the night. Dry mouth & shakiness if taken too much to start until you get used to it.,Really like it. Has helped me loose 42 lbs but after taking it for almost two years_ with little breaks of my own choosing - say 1-4 days w/out about every 4-5 wks_ I have finally gotten to the point where it is no longer effective. Too bad. I have switched to Tenuate for the next month or so to see if that will work as well but if not then my doc will give me the Ionamin (phentermine) again. I took 1/2 tablet at first (don't recommend the time released capsules as you can not control them as well as the tablets)_ maybe 6 mos_ then 1 full tab_ then 1.5. When I had to take 2 to still get any effect my doc & I decided to switch for a bit. I have taken the Tenuate for about 2 weeks and it is_ for me_ inferior to the Phentermine.,F,46,21  days,5/31/2007,Ionamin
7, 5, weight loss,insomnia - first 2 days,I took Ionamin on and off for several years.  It is incredible.  Unfortunately my current doctor will not prescribe it to me.  I definitely recommend it to anyone with weight to lose - in combination with reducing your caloric intake and increasing your exercise.  This medication increases your energy so you're wanting to do more.,F,28,6  times,2/19/2007,Ionamin
8, 5, difficulty losing weight,Duromine - occasion dry mouth when stressed_ gassy,I took duromine for 3 mths_ had 1 mth break and now am back on it. The first 3 mths I lost over 15 kgs_ gained 3 on the break (my own error) and have now lost 6 kgs after 3 weeks of being back on the pills which is a total weight loss of 18 kgs. I have had weight problems since I hit puberty and this is the only thing besides killing myself with over-exercising that works. The first night I had problems sleeping but only because I read too much about the problems that I may have. The best thing to do is just to tell yourself you don't have sleep problems and close your eyes (this worked for me_ but it's a case by case thing). I can manage to eat two pieces of fruit and dinner in a day and weigh myself twice a day as the weight differs morning and night - it's a good guide to know what does and doesn't make you lose weight each day. The first week I stayed off the scales and thought I had gained weight as I didn't know what time of day I am at my lightest.. I feel much more confident_ h,F,23,4  months,1/14/2007,Ionamin
