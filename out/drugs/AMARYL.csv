0, 1, Diabetes type2,Horrible side effects: extreme itching and hives. Weight gain. After researching websites about the medication_ I found out it interacts with 4 other medications I take. The result is a raise in blood sugar level. I was also disturbed with the other information about the drug and its effects on the body.,Please do a lot of research on this drug before taking.Not all websites listing information on it provide all the facts. Search several because the list of medicine you should not take with it is very long.,F,46,3  weeks,10/24/2015Email,Amaryl

4, 4, Type 2,No side effects.,However_ when taken just before breakfast_ after 2 to 3 hours_ my sugar level drops below the normal level and therefore I have to take some juice or heavy snacks every day 2 hours after the breakfast to avoid dropping of sugar level.I took HbA1c every 3 months and it was 4.2. So it works!,M,50,1  years1 mg 1X D,7/7/2012Email,Amaryl

6, 4, type 2 diabetes,dizziness_ sleepiness (would fall asleep mid-sentence_ hypo_ tremor,I took it along with Byetta_ Humalog_ and Lantus SoloStar. Think I will try leaving the Humalog. Have to watch what I eat because Byetta takes away my appetite_ and sense of taste. But I have to make sure I eat enough to keep my sugar up. Last night it fell like a rock after supper and I was shaking so hard I had to lay down. My husband had to run out and get me a milkshake to get my sugars back up and have protein. I was VERY NAUSEOUS and couldn't think of anything to eat but the shake.,F,41,1  weeks1mg 1X D,4/27/2011Email,Amaryl
7, 1, type 2 diabetes,some nausea to begin with but subsided,Does not work for me. At best it dropped me down about 20 points but I am up at 270-80 fasting plus I take 30mg Actos once a day! Was on glucovance 500mg/ day with Actos_ but got too low and hypo (40-50!). Asked Dr. to reduce this but switched me to amaryl. I watch my diet and exercise daily_ so I am going back to glucovance if possible. Don't rate amaryl at all.,M,42,5  weeks8 1X D,12/26/2010Email,Amaryl
8, 5, Type 2 diabetes,No side effects,Began at 2 mg after breakfast and after 2 weeks with it pushing blood sugar to mid to upper 30's went to 1mg after breakfast and it will maintain good levels daily.

10, 5, Try something new,Amaryl threw my blood sugar very low the first few days_ maybe because I was in a turmoil  of decluttering my house and doing a lot of physical stuff.  It definitely is a wonderdrug_  I was on Actos 45 mg for quite a few years with swollen face and very swollen legs that hurt.  I have lost 10 pounds and feel wonderful.,I love this drug and hope that it will continue to let me wake up in the morning to 95-100 blood sugar instead of fighting a 150-160 all day long with metformin and actos.,F,54,1  months,7/19/2009Email,Amaryl
11, 4, Diabetes Type II,When I get up later in the morning_ Amaryl tends to drop my readings into the 60s and 70s in the afternoon.  I'm learning to anticipate the symptoms of empty stomach_ weak legs and a general sensation of weakness_ and have some sugar to control it.  But it's quite unnerving.  It seems to work_ though...,I've been on 2000 mg of Glucophage plus Actos for years... but did not observe a diet at all and my last A1C was 7.7... my doc got upset and gave me Amaryl.  I have a suspicion I could drop Amaryl and avoid flour_ potatoes_ sugars_ etc. and maybe achieve similar results.,M,72,2  months,3/31/2009,Amaryl

13, 4, Type 2  Diabetes,Low blood sugars.,I have followed the appropriate eating plan and have been exercising_ and the doctor has already cut the Amaryl down to 1 mg a day. I suspect I'll be getting off of it soon. It's doing its job too well. The bad thing is that I have to eat to the blood sugar level when it goes down and that negates any weight loss efforts_ which in the long run are a major goal in control of my type 2.,F,53,2  months,8/10/2008,Amaryl
14, 4, lower blood sugars,some nausea_ dizziness,BS levels dropped like a brick! was already taking Actos & 2 metformin--doc added amaryl and 2 more metformin. I also gave up refined sugars but still eat fruits. fasting BS in the 80s and 90s (whoa!)--evening BS in the 120s-140s,F,48,4  days,3/24/2008,Amaryl
15, 4, Type 2 Diabetes,Late afternoon hypoglycemia. Not much of a problem for me.,I tried Avandia and Actos with no apparent improvement in blood sugars. Recently added Amaryl to metformin plus Actos (which I've taken for several years) and saw improvement in FBG levels and after dinner values as well within 3 weeks. Very happy so far. Remember Type 2 is a heterogenous condition hence some T2s benefit more than others.,M,63,8  days,2/5/2008,Amaryl
16, 1, Type 2 Diabetic,Took in A.M. Went to bed at 10:00 P.M. with ice cold hands_ lower legs and feet. Thundering irregular heartbeat began and ran in intervals for several hours.,I would not recommend to anyone sensitive to drugs.  Apparently I am.,F,64,1  days,1/17/2008Email,Amaryl
17, 4, diabetes,None.,It does not bring my blood sugar down to an acceptable level. I will have to take meds to assist the amaryl. I take 8 mg a day and do not have any side effects that I have noticed.,F,37,30  days,1/9/2008Email,Amaryl
18, 5, Type ll,Took 2mg in the morning and wow_ it would lower by blood sugar down into the 70's.  I could feel it when it was low.  So now I take 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night.  Morning readings are in the 90's vs 130's + before taking the drug. Also on a strict weight loss program...modified ( Optifast ) and hope to get off meds with sufficient weight loss.,"Also have been taking Glucophage for a number of years....no real affect on my blood sugar...also Actos for several years...still not much affect...Amaryl seemed to be the "" magic bullet "".",M,57,8  days,7/31/2007,Amaryl

20, 5, Type 2 Diabetes,None at all-- however it took a few weeks to start working-- blood sugar is now normal.,I take this with Avandia (called Avandaryl_ made by GSK) and 2 500MG tablets of Metformin_ and it works great at keeping my blood sugars normal-- I eat pretty much a normal diet too.,M,38,5  months,9/11/2006,Amaryl
21, 5, diabetes II,none,I didn't like takeing it in the evening_ it would keep me awake. I am highly sensitive to caffine_ so maybe some connection. Lowered my A1c from 7.5 to 5.5 in 4 months time.,M,48,9  months,10/27/2005,Amaryl

23, 4, High blood sugar - Diabetes II,,I am reviewing this on behalf of my 93-year old mother. Amaryl worked well in keeping her blood sugar levels down.  She took 1/2 of a 2mg pill every morning after breakfast.  If we didn't make sure she had some carbs from lunch onward_ her levels would sometimes drop into the 70s.  The pill tended to lose some effectiveness after about 12 hours_ and her numbers would be in the 120s pre-breakfasst.  I wanted to give her a 1/2 pill a.m. and 1/2 p.m._ but her doctor said it would be too difficult to cut the pill evenly enough to get the dosage consistent.  After a few low p.m. readings_ he took her off Amaryl in September.  We're trying to manage by diet alone_ which is quite difficult.  We only do 2 readings per day_ and I worry about how high her levels go after meals.  I had tested her after Oatmeal for breakfast (when taking Amaryl) and it would get her levels up 80+ points post prandial.,F,93,1  years,10/22/2004,Amaryl
