0, 1, ,I was relieved to see so many reviews describing what I was feeling after taking this!  I thought something was very wrong.  I fortunately did not experience the terrible gastrointestinal problems some people have described_ but my experience was no good.  Took two pills before heading to a concert.  By the time I got to the concert_  I felt like I was drunk.  So lightheaded and woosy_ almost like having an out of body experience.  I felt like I was going to fall out of my chair.  Did not like that feeling at all.  When I came home and went to bed I had an unusual amount of gas and felt so bloated; felt like I had indigestion.  Took me forever to fall asleep.  Feeling slightly better this morning but still not back to normal yet.,,F,31,1  days2 Pills,8/8/2016,Excedrin (migraine)
1, 3, Migraine,Severe stomach pain; restlessness,Sometimes I only take a half of a tablet because of how much it hurts my stomach. I still get horrific stomach pain.

4, 1, My friend was taking 4 migraine,No bad side affects_ med just didn't do as advertised_ which was relieved migraine headache.,"As a retired nurse I can tell what is actually in this ""magic formula"". You know it by brand name Aleve & Tylenol_ with some caffeine added. If you want to use this type of formula_ you can come very close @ a much better price. Go to Walmart or any pharmacy_ find the name brand Alieve & Tylenol.Look @ chemical name under the brand name.@ Walmart_ I look right beside the same medicine and see Equate for less than 1/2 the cost.Buy a bottle of each. Next I recommend that you Always consult with a pharmacist. These are the people who have had specialized training in the field of medicine that our doctor prescribed. While they aren't allowed to tell you what you should take_ other than Always consult with your family doctor. If I were to take 1 Equate brand Tylenol and 1 Equate brand ALIEVE_ then drink a very strong cup of coffee_ I've solved the problem of identity the formula. Now if you asked if it doesn't work_ why do so many people give positive reviews? 1St Haven't you heard of these companies where for the Right Price you can Buy positive reviews for your company? 2.Always go by ""word of mouth"" ask friends and family on your social media sites if they have personally tried this product for migraine and did it WORK? As a nurse_ we not only reviewed meds that way but doctors as well. Didn't matter how good your diagnostic skills were_ if you had a Rude attitude towards any nurse you got put on ""the list"".",F,30,3  days,6/26/2016Email,Excedrin (migraine)

6, 1, For migraine headaches,Excruciating stomach cramps_ gas_ bloating_ fever_ chills,Ok_ so here's the good and unfortunately the bad of this medication. When I first took excessive migraine (2 tablets) it definitely knocked out my migraine headaches. I admit that my migraines come about once every three weeks and are relatively mild (compared to some that I've heard of) however are still debilitating. Loss of concentration headaches_ extreme sensitivity to light_ etc) So I thought I had found a magic solution to these as the excedrine was quite effective for keeping the massive headache part at bay. However_ over a few short months I have started having vicious stomach problems. Sharp shooting pains_ bloating gassiness_ diarrhea. This last for at least three or four days after taking the medication and has gotten progressively worse each time I take the pills. The latest bout has been so brutal that I would actually prefer the migraine to the stomach pain. Both are horrible and debilitating but the stomach pain is truly scary and the headaches go away after 24 hours. I can't recommend excedrine unless you have stomach of steel. I wish I could.,M,46,1  days2 pills,5/14/2016,Excedrin (migraine)

It was very very scary and I will never take it again!,I used to take Excedrin every single day before it went off the market. Now that it's back I took some after running out of my regular anti inflammatory. I suddenly felt very nauseous_ and uncontrollably shaky. It lasted about thirty minutes and then my body started to calm down enough to handle. It was so bad I couldn't work I had to just sit shaking and feeling like I was going to pass out and wanting to cry for fifteen minutes when I got to work.

14, 1, Cramps,I don't think I took the migraine pills but I took excedrin extra strength and it seems to have the exact same effects. The label read that it relieved menstrual cramps so I took 2 pills and almost immediately after I started feeling anxious. I struggle with anxiety already and this amplified it times 1000. I was feeling worried_ paranoid_ anxious_ scared_ jittery and I suffered a panic attack. I thought I was having a heart attack and I thought I was going to die.

21, 1, all-day headache,I get really bad headaches at work because I stare at a computer screen all day at my job. After about 12 noon I started getting really bad_ burning_ headache in my left side of my face (eye_ neck_ face_ shoulder) I don't know if it's a migraine or a tension headache but either way this is all I had the choice to take. After about 1 hour_ I had really upset stomach_ cramps_ bubbly stomach(like before diarrhea)_ super jittery_ anxiety_ slightly nauseous and lightheadedness/weakness. I am just waiting for the diarrhea since having these bubble guts_ and not to mention my headache is just as bad or worse than before I took it_ and I only took one. My body feels like I drank 5 red bull. This medicine is horrible. I have stomach problems anyways but definitely will never be taking this ever again...it didn't help_ and it made me feel horrible. I probably won't be able to sleep tonight either_ I don't know how I could when feeling like this. Terrible_ should not even be allowed on the market.

33, 4, Morning headaches_  muscle pain,Before they took it off market I would have stomach pain. After they brought it back with the new binder ( tabs were hard like the generic brands ) I developed ulcers. They changed the formula again some time in either late 2014 or 2015 to a tab that disolves easier. I have less stomach pain_but I just don't think it works as well as the formula before they took it off market. I have actually taken this drug for over 30 years_ sometimes 4 tabs with a migrane_ or 2 tabs in the am and 2 tabs around 5pm. I am addicted to Excedrine...but I do feel physically better when I take it.,Go back to the formula before you took it off market. Actually_ if I crush the harder generic brands and take them with water they work just as well as the new formula Excedrine_ but I think the new Excedrine formula has a buffer of some kind since my stomach has less pain when taking it so I will a a little extra for the Excedrine...for now.,F,62,10  years2 tabs,6/21/2015,Excedrin (migraine)
34, 5, Migraine with auras,no side effects,Ive been taking excedrin for my migraines (true migraines - ie._ throbbing vascular pain in head that gets worse with even slight activity (ex. standing up)_ sometimes with auras beforehand (shapes in vision_ traveling numbness on arms and face_ and difficulty using the correct words)) for about a year and a half_ and I can't recall ever having a serious side effect. I also have a moderate anxiety disorder_ but it never triggered an anxiety attack. The only problem I have with it is that the caffeine makes it hard to fall asleep soon afterwards_ and the caffeine sometimes makes my slight mitral valve prolapse worse ( = makes my heart skip beats more often when I'm laying down) but this is a very normal reaction for me when taking caffeine.I try to only take one pill so as to be easy on my liver and heart_ but if the migraine is really intense_ I'll take two. Either way it almost always works to get rid of the migraine (or at least reduce it significantly) and no serious side effects for me.,F,23, 1 capsule 4X M,6/18/2015,Excedrin (migraine)

45, 1, Migraine Headache,,This is a dangerous product. I took this product four times over a two-month period (the recommended 2 tabs in 24 hours).  The first two times I took it_ my migraine disappeared in 10 minutes and no side effects.  I was thrilled.   However_ when I took this product the third time a couple weeks later at 4:00 am_ I figured all would be fine-  BIG MISTAKE.    Within 15 minutes_ I started getting morbid thoughts_ extreme anxiety.  I started walking fast around the house and felt very weird and faint.  It was so alarming that I almost called 911! Since it worked so well the first two times_ I thought maybe it was a 'fluke' so when I encountered my fourth migraine I took it again (just 2 tabs) and had the same horrible reaction so this was NO FLUKE.  I threw the rest of the tablets down the toilet and I will NEVER take this medicine again.

58, 5, Tension Headache,,I LOVE Excedrin. It's the only thing that works on my headaches. My whole family takes it. I can't take regular Excedrin with the aspirin because it upsets my stomach. I had a really bad migraine a few weeks ago and I took 1 1/2. If I take 2_ it makes me to shaky. That's why you should only take 1. If one doesn't help withing an hour_ take another 1/2 a pill. Taking 2 will make you jumpy and your heart races.  Its from the caffeine in the medicine.

He sat down saying his body felt weird and he felt like he was anxious. Thinking that it was a possibility he may be allergic_ I gave him one benadryl capsule.

Well_ I ate a few crackers and I took 2 pills. 30 mins later I started feeling weird and disconnected and irritable. 30 mins after that.. FULL ON panic attack. Legs going numb_ can't think straight_ trouble speaking_ tight chest_ nausea_ black stool_ terrible terrible drug in my opinion.

But since it came back it only comes in the oblong white pills - not the round green coated ones - and the stomach discomfort and nausea are awful.  I replace the headache with another form of discomfort.  I thought they went off the market because of some minor tainting in the production line .  Now I question that.  It took forever to come back and it seems they came back with a lesser product.  I still use it but I prepare to stay in bed even when the headache is gone.

I switched to generic and stopped feeling poisoned_ I thought I'd try Excedrin again and I'm feeling weird and slightly poisoned again.  Not good.

For me_ it's hit or miss. Sometimes it works great and only leaves me a bit jittery but feeling better in 20 minutes to a half hour_ other times it takes more than an hour to kick in and leaves me with this nasty feeling in my stomach like its ripping itself apart and I wanna throw up_ sometimes making me feel worse off and wishing I just dealt with the migraine and tried to sleep instead. I get horrible migraines that make me throw up and excedrin migraine so far has been the only thing that worked_ unfortunately_ which leaves me with a sort of love-hate relationship.If you're going to take it_ always take it after eating food_ never take it on an empty stomach_ it will only amplify the side effects. And when you take it_ avoid any and all caffeine_ as these pills are like drinking 2 cups of coffee. Hell_ avoid anything that even bears a slight resemblance to caffeine.

My mom sufferes from stage 4 migraines and myself stage 3. We have been taking EM for many years with no side effects at all. I would take them after the migraine started and within the hour it was gone. If I caught it before the migraine it would be gone within 15-20 minutes. I even take them before I went to bed and EM didn't effect my sleeping routine. I used to get migraines 4-6 times a month mixed in with some smaller headache and the EM actually reduced the ammount of headaches I would experience. 23 years after using EM my monthly migraines reduced to 1-3 with no smaller headache anymore.

151, 1, Migraine,Extreme anxiety_ stomach pains_ nausea_ shaking_ restlessness_ hot/cold sensations,I have experienced chronic migraines for over a decade. At the onset I was taking Excedrin Migraine like it was going out of style - and experienced no adverse side effects. Over time it became less effective and I have been on 15+ different medications since. The only thing that has ever worked is triptans (imitrex or treximet) but overuse made headaches more frequent_ and my doctor will no longer prescribe it. He suggested I try Excedrin Migraine since it worked for me years ago. At first_ the headache persisted and I just felt all around ill. I surprisingly did not experience the extreme adverse side effects until about 8 hours after taking two pills. I am jittery_ nauseous_ restless_ very anxious_ hot/cold. The headache has subsided but is still present. I had to take Ativan to combat the severe symptoms. I do have a sensitivity to caffeine_ but I must say that I have never experiences such awful side effects from any of the 15+ prescription drugs I have tried.

Later on around 7pm I had a bad stomach ache out of nowhere as did my boyfriend. We weren't naucious but our stomachs just felt very strange. I did not even consider that it could be the excedrin until I read this. Then at about 1am I became extremely hot. My skin was burning but I was freezing so much that I had goosebumps and my fingernails were turning blue (that occassionally happens to me when I'm cold) I had on a t shirt_ a hoodie w the hood on tight and 2 blankets and still had chills goosebumps and chattering teeth but my entire body was burning hot. I'm on vacation and since it was so late nothing was open so again I took one excedrin migraine cause that's all I had.

168, 5, Migraines,None,"Amazing product. Over the years_ I tried just about every OTC product available for migraines. Most did not work and the others were fair. And_ yes_ Excedrin Migraine and Excedrin Extra Strength are the exact same product_ BUT there's a very good reason they're sold separately. Excedrin Migraine was approved by the FDA to treat migraines ONLY. That's why the instructions are to take only 2 pills (30 mg each) in 24 hours. If you are taking it for a migraine and take more than that_ you are very likely to get rebound migraines. In other words_ your migraine problem will get WORSE. Exedrin Extra Strength's instructions allows 8 pills in 24 hours because it is meant for ""standard"" headaches_ NOT migraines. One final warning: always take either product with a FULL GLASS OF WATER. Otherwise_ you are asking for a big tummy ache. And although most people do not need to eat food before taking either product_ eating a little something first is a good extra step to prevent a stomach ache.

Then yesterday_ I took 1 pill at the begining signs of a migraine_ and began to feel jittery w/chills dizzenss and stomach pains.  Then my shakes became uncontrolable and my speech became slurred and I began to stutter for the first time in my life.  That is the scarriest thing I have ever experinced in my life to not be able to focus or stop the stutter.  I was rushed to the hospital ER from work_ and a CT scan was done as well as blood work_ there was no abnormalities found.

Within the hour_ my limp was gone and I had no pain and no side effects!

My migraines will last for three days every time if I don't catch them in time with the excedrine. Nothing else works for me at all. None of the over the counter prescripton drugs the doctors prescribed have worked for me. They all make me sick and do not get rid of the headache.

I feel like a walking excedrin commercial because I recommend the stuff to others.  Because it contains ibuprofin (which is what motrin has)_ you need to eat when you take it (or drink some milk) as ibuprofin can cause ulcers and stuff like that.

As long as I eat beforehand and can close my eyes and remain still_ I don't think I have ever had this drug fail to relieve the headache.  People complaining about nausea: You must remember to eat beforehand or immediately after ingestion of the medicine.  I did forget to do that once and suffered intense stomach pain.  The shakes and panic attacks that people are reporting are also likely due to caffeine intake and dehydration due to cold sweating and anxiety.

I do agree that it is important to eat before you take them and not to take more than 2 within a 24hr period. I believe the reason I feel better fast is because of my water intake.

233, 5, Migraine headache,None,(continued) Also_ for migraines specifically_ finding a product that truly gets rid of them can be very difficult for many people. It's trial and error. If one product doesn't work_ you try another until you hopefully find one that does the trick. So a product not getting rid of your migraines is one thing_ but having painful or uncomfortable side effects is another. Follow the directions and you most likely will never have the bad side effects. Whether it works to get rid of your migraine is a coin toss_ but at least you won't have the bad side effects in most cases. I hope this helped. Good luck to all migraine sufferers.

So if you have migraines and want to buy Extra Strength Excedrin_ instead of Excedrin Migraine_ that's totally fine_ but be sure to follow the Excedrin Migraine directions! If you're taking the product for migraines and you take more than 2 pills in 24 hours_ you can definitely except to experience the bad side effects that many people have talked about on this site! And keep in mind that although you should NEVER take more than 2 pills in 24 hours (if your using it for migraines)_ that doesn't mean you can't take just 1 pill in 24 hours. For some people_ just 1 pill will get rid of your migraine. If 1 pill isn't working for you_ then you can always take another one during each 24 hours. So less is fine_ but more is a huge mistake. I hope I've made my point. Review sites in general tend to attract people who have bad things to say about a product. People who have a good experience with a product are much less likely to post their comments on a site like this. Why? Because angry people want to vent. This is not to say that some people who complain are insincere or haven't followed the directions of the product. There are always going to be people who a product just doesn't work for. But most people who properly follow the directions will not have bad results. (continued in next post),M,45,1  daysTwo 30 mg 1X D,2/21/2010,Excedrin (migraine)
236, 5, migraine headache,None,"Like all medications I've ever taken_ I followed the directions exactly (""take 2 caplets with a glass of water"") and the product worked great_ with no side effects. With regard to those complaining that the product was ineffective or gave you bad side effects_ PLEASE read the following. Although Excedrin Migraine and Excedrin Extra Strength are the exact same product_ it is vitally important to follow the Excedrin Migraine directions if you are taking the pills for a migraine_ NOT the directions for Extra Strength Excedrin! Here's why. Many people have incorrectly assumed that because the two products are exactly the same_ which they indeed are_ that the directions are also the same. THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE. The reason that there is a separate product solely for migraines_ and the FDA approved it solely for migraine use only_ is because the amount you take for migraines is completely different than for general pain relief_ including ""regular"" headaches. The reason Excedrin Migraine instructs you to take only 2 pills in 24 hours (vs 8 pills in 24 hours for Extra Strength Excedrin) is because taking more than 2 pills in 24 hours (for a migraine) is likely to cause rebound migraines for many people. In other words_ taking more pills than the directions tell you to will make your migraine problem worse! You will note on the Excedrin Migraine package that the ONLY use for the product is ""treats migraines."" Think about that!

237, 4, Migraine headache,I had some anxiety/jitters for about 45 minutes after taking the pill_ but I don't handle caffeine well_ so this same thing will also happen after a cup of coffee or sugary/caffeinated drink. I felt MUCH better within the hour and my headache was dulled.,The dosage calls for 2 pills in a 24 hour period_ but I don't handle caffeine well so I only took 1 pill even though my headache was brutal. I was anxious and jittery for about 45 minutes. But after that_ I felt much better after a day of excruciating migraine pain. I also took the same dosage of this medicine a few months back and had pretty much the same experience. I would recommend only taking one pill even for a bad migraine. This is very strong stuff and one pill will get the job done. I should also mention that I am NOT on any other medications_ and rarely take aspirin_ so I might have less of an immunity than those who frequently take aspirin.,F,25,1  days1 pill 1X D,2/19/2010,Excedrin (migraine)

239, 1, Migraine and Headache,After taking it on an empty stomach I felt so sick as if all my systems were going haywire.  My wife had to take me to the E.R.  After the ER nurse took my vital signs_ the staff rushed me in and hooked me up to an EKG.  My blood pressure and heart rate was alarmingly high to the point the Doctors kept asking me if I was on any illegal drugs.  I don't take drugs_ smoke or even drink alcohol.  They gave me fluids through an IV and released me about 2 hours later when heart rate and blood pressure came down.  After running many test and blood work (all OK) they couldn't determine the cause.  They said maybe stress or anxiety.  For months after this_ I have had very rapid heart rate and lots of anxiety (panic attacks) before realizing the trigger was this medicine.

244, 4, daily headaches,None_ worked great to get rid of headaches. Addictive. I rated it a 4 because it works_ but it is not something that you should take everyday. I haven't taken it in almost a year.,I was addicted to Excedrin for 11 years. At first I thought it was a great thing because it got rid of my daily headaches. But then I started noticing that when I woke up I had even stonger headaches. So sometimes I was taking more than I should have. I tooke 2 pills ever morning. From that time I have probably taken around 11_000 pills. That's about $4_500 spent for excedrin by myself alone. I finally broke my addiction and life is great! It's not worth your migraines.

Since I don't have health care insurance anymore (military vet)_ I wanted to stop taking my prescription drugs and start taking OTC meds. Looks like Tension Headache may not be the way to go.People complaining of dizziness_ and confusion. That's a symptom of the migraine. NOT the medication.

I also get nausea and vomiting no matter what medicine I try_ because those are migraine side effects.

283, 5, Migraine,Caffeine Jitters_ sweating,I have been having migraines for about 5 years_ including one that lasted 8 months. I tried various prescription medications_ IV's_ injections_ and the only thing that did the trick was Excedrin Migraine. The caffeine gives me slight anxiety attacks and jitters_ but as anyone who suffers extreme migraine pain knows_ caffeine jitters are a far better alternative. I often get an upset stomach_ but I believe its a side effect of the anxiety attack_ not the medication.,F,19,3  years,2/5/2009,Excedrin (migraine)

Excedrin Migraine ALWAYS helps relieve pain. I usually take one tablet. Rarely do I need a second_ but if need be it always gives relief. Rough on stomach. Must eat food with dosage. Migraines related to food preservatives. MSG and excitotropins are real killers. Learned about Excedrin from grandmother who took Excedrin for arthritis pain.

286, 5, Migraine,No side effects for me except absolute relief!,I've been getting these really bad headaches (sometimes nauseating) for the last couple of years. When I get one (not that often) it puts me down. Nothing ever seemed to help (aspirin or ibuprofin) so I just suffered with the pain. I don't know what triggers them but think it has to do with stress_ sinuses_ and/or caffeine or a mixture of the three. I'm not really sure. Anyway_ I had a really bad one a few days ago and somehow made myself crawl to the drugstore to try something new as it was the worst ever (extremely nauseating). I knew there was an over-the-counter medication specifically formulated for migraines_ EXCEDRIN (MIGRAINE)_ as I had seen it in the drugstore but never tried it. I'm skeptical when it comes to most over-the-counter medications_ however_ this headache was so bad & lengthy I figured I had to try something new. To my amazement after two (2) pills_ a tiny sip of diet Coke_ and a prayer in 10 minutes I felt a reduction in the pain beginning. I thought to myself,M,52,1  days,1/12/2009,Excedrin (migraine)

After reading the other entries I guess my excedrin consumption COULD be aggravating the condition.,I got my first Migranie when i was 4 years old.I spent the majority of my childhood trying everything to avoid my triggers; bright light_ over excitement_ windy weather conditions_ smells. etc. I continued to have severe migraines throughout my life well into my teen age years.I got headaches everyday and a full blown migraine about twice a month. I have tried several perscription meds._ including imtrex which did nothing_ zomig which helped a little but gave me incredible tightness in my chest and I always got a rebound headache that was worse then the original. I started taking excedrin in high school and then excedrin migraine as soon as it came out. Like most others_ when taking it at the first sign of a headache_ it dimishes or decreases the intensity enough that I can make it through my work day. Since I began taking excedrin migraine(about 15 years ago) I only get about 1 severe full blown migraine a year with vomittng_ sensitivty to light and soumd_ etc. However I do agree that,M,31,15  years,12/31/2008,Excedrin (migraine)
288, 3, Migraine Headaches,I've taken Excedrin 4-5 times a week last month and I started having stomach aches_ serios acid reflux and diarrhea. And in the past_ I took 2 of these pills at a time without knowing how strong they were and I thought I was dying. I had dizziness all over my arms and hands and I had to leave work and go home and lay down. And I am one of those who does not drink coffee_ so that's understandable. But the bad stomach aches and the diarrhea is scary! I stopped taking Excedrin and started using stomach and diarrhea medicine to cure myself.,This medicine works great with the headache but it has other scary side effects!

I also made sure to eat before taking it_ and drank lots of water ... so I didn't get an upset stomach like I've heard many people get.,I actually took Excedrin Tension Headaches because I couldn't find Excedrin Migraine at the drug store.  From what I could read_ the only different is that instead of containing aspirin it had twice the amount of acetaminophen.

Taken on an empty stomache the side effects can be pretty bad.,While every once in a while the side effects hit me pretty hard_ even at their worst they are far better than the headaches they cover. The medice only really works perfectly if taken at the beginning of the migraine_ however_ even if taken too late to completely cut off the headache_ the strange caffeine high I get at least puts a sort of buffer between me and the worst of the pain.

But I have been carrying it with me in my purse and taking it when I need to for about 6 years now.Bad pain in right side of head/sinus/eyeball.  Thought it was my sinuses_ turned out after finally doing an MRI that it is a deviated septum (from a birth defect) touching slightly inflamed sinus.  The Excedrin knocks the swelling down_ the septum stops touching the sinus_ and I can continue on with my day just fine.  Life saver since I can stay at work now instead of having to push through or just give up and go home.  I also drink extra water which helps.,F,35,6  years,10/7/2008,Excedrin (migraine)

Check the ingredients. They all have 250 mg of aspirin_ 250 mg of acetaminophen_ and 65 mg of caffeine. So save some money and buy the generic.

I was used to spending a day or two in bed every month. Imitrex only worked if I took it in the early stages of the headache_ often only dulled the pain_ and always made me nauseous and fuzzy-headed. Migraine strength Excedrin removes my headaches completely_ quickly_ and reliably_ whatever phase of the headache I'm in when I take them. Often I only need one tablet_ and take another a half hour later if I need to.  The headache is usually gone for good_ I rarely need a second dose.

If I take Excedrin migraine at the onset of my auras_ I have no problems and barely notice the migraine. However if I'm not lucky enough to take it while the aura is still going on_ it takes about 1-2 hours for it to work. Additionally_ I've found that usually one pill does the trick_ however two on an empty stomach will leave me jittery_ sick to my stomach and miserable.

I do get headaches that aren't true migraines if I go without the Excedrin though.

The resulting headaches (from suddenly stopping use)/side effects just worsen and you are never really ""normal"".  Use this in moderation and note the acetaminophen in this drug can be just as bad as prescription meds if abused.",Excedrin works like no other for my migraines or headaches/toothaches.  I taken early in the event of a headache it works flawlessly but not as good if I wake up with a migraine.  I always took 2 a time at first but now only take 1 (2-3 times a week) to try to prevent any rebound headaches (these can be worse than the migraine).  Since I vomit w/ my migraines usually if I take the Excedrin w/ sprite/7up immediately after vomiting and it will take effect and eliminate the headache before getting sick again.  The problems come when I take more than 3 or 4 times a week.  Then it's like I need it to not get a headache.

Always eat something and take with full glass of water. Keep hyderated. In addition do not take at bedtime_ otherwise you will stay awake. Apart from this_ the medicine works well for me who is a migraine patient for 18 years. I cannot bear any more headaches with intensity close to 7 / 10. I have tried all the preventions but I guess that I have to suffer no matter what. Hence this medicine atleast reduces the intensity and helps me and family.

I have tried every prescription rx under the sun (some worked_ some didn't_ all are expensive) as well as every OTC migraine med.  Excedrin Migraine is THE ONLY OTC pill that is effective in treating my headaches.  If I take it right away (as soon as I feel a headache coming on)_ I can prevent a full outbreak about 95% of the time.  There is that point of no return--as others have mentioned_ and your doctor is likely to tell you--beyond which nothing will really be effective.  Even if I'm past that point_ I'll still take it because it keeps them from lasting soooooo long.  Of course everyone reacts to meds in different ways_ and YOU should always be the judge of how YOU feel after taking something.

338, 4, Migraine Headaches,My daughter 12 yrs old started getting migraines in the last years.  Some are so bad that she vomits and gets really out of it.  We have tried several types of medication.  I live in Canada so Excedrin Migraine is not available here.  This works so well on her it is amazing.  She takes one pill at the start of a headache and it gets rid of it sometimes in less than 20 min.  The most she has ever had to take in one day is 2.  I am concerned about the longterm effect on her.  She has been taking them at least 4 to 5 times per week.  I can only hope that she grows out of these headaches.  It is worth the long border lineups and the treck down to the states to get this medication.  She is a very lively girl and into a lot of sports.

351, 4, headache,I'm writing in response to everyone else's bashing of this drug. I'm not going to advertise the drug_ but point out some obvious facts. Because this drug contains aspirin_ which can be harsh on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus_ stomach_ small and large intestine)_ side effects may include upset stomach_ indigestion_ heartburn_ and sometimes lower GI upset and cramping. If people experience severe stomach pain_ they should probably see a doctor as this might suggest the presence of an ulcer. An ulcer would become very irritated while taking aspirin. This is especially true if you have dark_ tarry_ foul-smelling stools. This kind of stool is often indicative of upper GI bleeding (possibly caused by an ulcer...)_ because as the blood travels through the digestive tract_ it becomes digested_ producing that characteristic stool. As for the nervousness_ anxiety_ shakiness_ sweaty palms_ rapid heart rate_ etc._ this is the caffeine working its magic. It's no surprise caffeine has th,Many people complain about the drug. But it's funny that most also report that the drug actually did its intended job of diminishing/eliminating their headache. One person reported that it did not get rid of their sensitivity to light_ sound_ and smell. That's because while Excedrin can help with the pain_ it does not work intricately in the brain to control these classic signs of a migraine. Most people probably cannot tell the difference between an actual migraine and a tension headache. And while I can attest to the drug working to reduce a tension headache quite effectively (I've never had a migraine)_ I would guess that at least some of the people dissatisfied with Excedrin were unhappy with its effects because they weren't using it to treat a true migraine. The caffeine itself could have also brought about a headache. One of the reasons an actual migraine occurs is because of blood vessel dilation in the brain. Caffeine acts as a vasoconstrictor_ helping to control that aspect of,M,19,2  years,4/13/2007Email,Excedrin (migraine)
352, 4, headache,,It cut off even more...As I was saying_ the woman gave Excedrin a rating of 2 when she experienced ringing in her ears and vomited all night after taking ten tablets within nine hours. If you ate so much junk food you vomited_ would you call food bad? No. Of course bad things are going to happen if you take that much medication. Vitamins are good for you_ right? Well if you eat a whole bottle_ you obviously aren't going to be the healthiest person around...,M,19,2  years,4/13/2007Email,Excedrin (migraine)
353, 4, headache,As I was saying (it cut off a large chunk of my comments)...It's no surprise caffeine has these effects. If you are sensitive to caffeine_ expect to get these side effects if you take Excedrin. Also_ if you take Excedrin for something like_ say_ erectile dysfunction (someone actually commented on this_ and called Excedrin an upper)_ do not expect it to work. Why would anyone take a headache medication for E.D.? And if you want to call Excedrin an upper_ then call your morning cup of coffee an upper as well.,Continuing this section...Caffeine acts as a vasoconstrictor_ helping to control that aspect of the migraine. People just need to realize that every single person is different and just because they got a terrible stomach ache doesn't mean that Excedrin should be taken off the shelves. Do some research. Look up the active ingredients that are in a drug and find out the side effects and the way in which the drug works. Something simple like finding out that a drug contains aspirin or caffeine may help you avoid a stomach ache or uncomfortable anxiety. For example_ if you have a bleeding problem_ you might find out that aspirin inhibits clotting_ so either don't take this medication_ or_ if you choose to do so anyway_ expect your bleeding problem to get worse and don't say that Excedrin is terrible because of that effect it had. Also_ you cannot expect a drug to work without any side effects if you take more than the recommended dosage_ such as the woman who gave this drug a rating of 2,M,19,2  years,4/13/2007Email,Excedrin (migraine)
