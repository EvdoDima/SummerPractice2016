0, 2, To try to reduce a thick uterine lining,I had a brutal 9 day bloodbath in the middle of my cycle (filling multiple pads and tampons daily.) The cramps were more than I'm used to_ but not unbearable. I assumed it would have been done with the bleeding after the 9 days in the middle of the month_ but sure enough my period showed up right on time. My period was a normal flow for me. I didn't continue taking the pill after the first month of use because it caused far more problems than benefits. My acne came back_ I was irritable_ and everything felt somewhat off emotionally and physically. I've been off of it for a few weeks and I have a bit of cramping and some weight gain as a result. I'm hoping I'm just bloating and my body is trying to adjust to the hormonal change.,I do believe this pill can be useful in some circumstances and is worth trying_ but discuss the risks and side effects with your doctor. My doctor said all of these symptoms were possible and we decided it was still worth trying for the condition that I have. Not the worst thing in the world_ but not for me.,F,22,1  months,8/15/2016Email,Lo loestrin fe

I feel so sick I can't even sleep.  It's actually 145 AM right now! So not worth it.,F,39,1  days,7/30/2016,Lo loestrin fe
3, 1, heavy bleeding.  how ironic,"Started this on the first day of my period as directed.. Same time everyday.  Have been bleeding in various amounts every day for 22 days straight.  The first ten days were a light bleed followed by eight days of very heavy clotting running down my legs mess.  The past four days have been spotting/very light bleeding.  I feel crampy all of the time_ all month long.  Im extremely irritable & going off in rages followed by depression and guilt.  I feel like im in a very dark place now.  My libido has dropped.  I have insomnia for the first time in my life.  I feel afraid to go to sleep    and must take a sleeping pill every night.  I eat everything thats not nailed down.  My weight is quickly going up.  By far the worst is the low dark depression that has gotten worse & worse since i started Lo Loestrin Fe.  Im supposed to start my withdrawal bleed in a few days and i wonder how thats gonna go.  Everyone including My dr says i need to give this med three months.   So i feel like i need to wait for the magical day when my body finally ""adjusts"" to the pill.  But  this just seems unreasonable.  This  pill is just a complete nightmare and women are made to feel bad if we dont ""stick it out"" for 3 months!  Why???  Dont we deserve better than to lose months of our lives in a crazy mental and physical distressed state just so we can see if it will work??  Ugh please!!",I was on bc pills for nearly 20 years and have never had side.effects like this.  This is NOT acceptable!!,F,,3  weeks1qd,7/22/2016Email,Lo loestrin fe
4, 1, Heavy periods and heavy bleeding,So I was on Lo Loestrin Fe for 12 months and I had so many issues. The first came three months in. My periods got worse_ and I had abdominal pain that impaired my breathing. 4 months in I gained 50 pounds and had severe cramping. My periods became unpredictable and I couldn't tell when they would start again_ most of the time I was having periods every two weeks. Finally stopped taking them after I had horrible pains that required an ambulance and a trip to the er.,This is literally the worse pill I've been on and now because of it I weight an unhealthy amount. Devastated me and my life. Also now my hair is brittle_ falling out... I'm off this pill. I'm still having trouble loosing this newly gained weight and that is unacceptable.,F,22,12  months30 MG 1X D,7/21/2016,Lo loestrin fe
5, 1, For heavy periods and anemia.,Started Lo Loestrin on day 1 of my period.  By day 4 I had developed terrible mood swings including extreme irritability and rage.  The headaches started and my head had a fuzzy feeling.  I wanted to stop the pill but my husband and mom said to give it more time.  My period was lighter instantly BUT its day 11 and I am still spotting all day and I have terrible cramps.  The rage is a little better but.headaches continue.  One bothersome side effect is sleepyness.  I'm SO TIRED!  Its such a tremendous effort to get anything done.Wish this spotting & cramping would stop.  From the other posts i've read_ it can go on for months.  Ugh.  The pads/tampons irritate me if i wear them this long so i take them off at home and just mess up my undies so i can get a break.  I hate this pill so far.  Hope it gets better soon.  Right now i'm in my bed with horrible cramps googling about it.  I'm so miserable but my Dr.  Says i need to wait the full 3 months before switching.  If men had any idea what we endure ...ugh.,I used other birth control when I was in my twenties and never had problems with any of them like I do with this one.,F,43,2  weeks,7/11/2016,Lo loestrin fe
6, 1, Multiple painful periods a month,Helped with period however gained close to 10lbs. Also broke out in horrible cystic acne. Could not figure out why. I have always had perfect skin to the point where I would skip school if I had a single pimple. This medicine made me have disgusting cystic acne all over my face. I lost all confidence. Would not leave the house. Now my clothes don't fit. 3 days not taking the pill and my face has already totally cleared up. Hopefully the dark spots do not last. Very upsetting. Worst medicine ever. I would rather have 3 painful periods a month than take another one of these pills.,DO NOT TAKE!!!,F,18,3  months1/10,7/6/2016Email,Lo loestrin fe

I cry I don't sleep well I sweat all the time and I am very snappy! This was suppose to help regulate my cycle but instead I have no cycle. I have also been breaking out in hives for 2 months and now this makes sense it's the pills!! I am miserable on it! My Dr told me all pills will cause nausea at first but to try and get through it. Well I did and I have had nothing but problems from this pill.,F,25,2  months,7/5/2016,Lo loestrin fe
8, 1, Prevent pregnancy,My doctor prescribed this birth control for me because it had lower dosages of hormones. However since the first pill I haven't been myself. Headaches_ dizziness_ fatigue_ sweaty all the time_ upset stomach_ and today was the final straw. I had a vomitig episode. Then I started to get light headed and dizzy and I passed out. I've never had any of this happen to me prior to taking this pill. Would not recommend.,,F,22,3  days,6/11/2016,Lo loestrin fe
9, 1, Contraceptive,Horrible side effects. I've been on this pill twice. Both times I experienced the SAME side effects. I forgot how nuts it made me the first time around. It's made me feel like I'm on anabolic steroids with my rage. My boyfriend can't say anything to me without me snapping_ I want to kill everyone_ I eat everything that isn't nailed down_ and I haven't been exercising like I usually have. I am going back on Seasonique because I feel like a normal human being on that medication. DO NOT GET ON THIS PILL. I'm stopping it a few days before my period because I threw tupperware at my boyfriend yesterday and it's turning me into the HULK. Ah.,,F,28,3  months 1X D,6/9/2016,Lo loestrin fe
10, 4, To prevent pregnancy,Breast Tenderness_ weight gain (~15lbs)_ sometimes no menstrual cycle,I honestly think this is a great birth control but I'm starting to think it is not good for long term use. I have had a pretty pleasant experience with this birth control. This is the only birth control I've ever taken in my life and I started a couple weeks before I got married for family planning purposes. Occasionally I have missed my cycle which always causes me to take pregnancy tests. And now I am starting to speculate that the 15lbs of weight I have gained is because of birth control because my eating habits have not changed drastically. I would recommend this pill but after 1.5 years_ I think you should find an alternative.,F,25,2  years 1X D,6/3/2016,Lo loestrin fe
11, 2, prevent pregnancy,I have been on this medication for almost 2 yrs and I am just realizing that its no good I have gained about 20lbs just this year at first my periods would come every month now I haven't had one.

My Dr recommend this_but it has been nothing but an annoyance. I always had clear skin minus the one or two small breakouts here and there.

14, 1, Painful ovulation,Breast/nipple soreness_ weight gain_ mood swings_ increased blood pressure,I started taking Minastrin for pain I was having during ovulation_ but my blood pressure increased a great deal so my doctor switched me to Lo Loestrin. BP went down slightly_ but I stopped the pill when I started having pretty severe breast pain that I just couldn't handle anymore. I also didn't care for the fact that I didn't get a real period on it_ and I wanted to stop before I started getting more severe side effects. I think the pill is just not for me_ but I definitely wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.,F,30,2  months,5/15/2016,Lo loestrin fe

This is the second pill I have tried and so far I have not been satisfied with either. I can't stand being depressed and anxious_ and now I have no sex drive so it makes the birth control pointless.

23, 1, Birth Contrpl,This is the worse birth control in the entire world. I was previously on Ortho but switched to this as my doctor said it would help with my moods. No way. I've become a raging hormonal monstor_ my boobs hurt all the time_ my periods are not regular_ I've gained weight_ and have the worse cramps I've ever experienced. And then_ to make matters worse_ I got pregnant while taking this everyday at the same time without ever missing a single pill. I literally set an alarm on my phone.

24, 1, Avoid Pregnancy,Prolonged spotting between periodsCrampingFatigueMood swings,I've been taking various types of birth control since I was 15 years old_ and I've never had as many issues as I have with this pill. I'm relieved to hear that many other women are experiencing similar side effects that I am. I switched from the Nuva Ring due to irritation of my cervix and my OB/GYN recommended Lo Loestrin. I'm on my 3rd pill pack and I absolutely HATE this mediation. The first month I took it I bled for about 2 weeks in-between my cycle. It wasn't really heavy_ but it was definitely more than just spotting. The second month it got a little better_ but again_ right around ovulation_ I started bleeding and it lasted for about 10 days. My periods are practically nonexistent_ probably because I bleed so much in between. I've also experienced pretty significant swings_ which I believe are rather uncharacteristic for me. I seem to fly off the handle about minor issues and lose my cool more often than I retain it. The magnitude of side effects from this drug are rather astounding considering how low the dose is_ but after 3 months of this nonsense_ I'm stopping this BCP.,F,29,3  months 1X D,2/19/2016,Lo loestrin fe
25, 1, Painful periods_ birth control,Insomnia_ severe nausea_ night sweats_ diarrhea_ bloating,I'm very sensitive to medications and rarely take them but I couldn't stand my painful periods anymore. Dr prescribed this pill as the lowest dose available. Only took it two days but it's horrible. Wide awake with nausea and diarrhea in the middle of the night and the nausea lasting throughout the mornings. Gained two pounds in two days_ most likely due to water retention/bloating. Unusual hunger for junk food. Am stopping immediately. Based on all the previous reviews_ I do not want to gain 20+ pounds_ be depressed_ anxious_ mood swings_ etc. Will have to deal with period pain.,F,33,2  days,2/17/2016,Lo loestrin fe
26, 1, Extreme painful periods,Spotting_ loss of appetite_ weight losss_  depression_ lack of motivation,I switched to Loestrin from a stronger BC because it was causing nausea and vomiting. The first two months seemed great because the nausea was finally gone and all I had was some light spotting. I was feeling depressed about something going on in my life_ which depression usually kills my appetite when it's bad enough_ so I assumed that was it. But when things cleared up in my life_ my appetite didn't. I've lost over 5 lbs in a couple weeks on my 3rd pill pack_ weight I really didn't need to lose. I can hardly get myself to eat and I hate how I feel towards food. I have been feeling bouts of depression and extreme lack of motivation_ like life has no luster for seemingly no reason. I am normally a very happy person. Also_ during my third month_ I started spotting more heavily dark discharge halfway through the pack_ and it hasn't stopped. It's gotten heavier as the week for my period has arrived_ but it's black and clotty! I have headaches_ maybe from the pill or not eating enough. I feel miserable. I'm done with this crap.,F,23,3  months1-20mg 1X D,1/22/2016,Lo loestrin fe

28, 4, Constant horrific menstrual cramps,Breast pain_ possible weight gain_ possible decreased sex drive_ gastrointestinal issues at first,I started this medication because i was in constant horrible pain and my hormones were fluctuating wildly_ to the point where I'd have random periods throughout the month and be perfectly emotionally stable one day and suicidal or aggressive the next. It's possibly caused by endometriosis but whatever the case this pill has definitely helped me fight that.I say possible weight gain because I've gained about seven lb (when i had a menstrual cycle my weight would fluctuate up to six lb depending on the cycle and I took this from the average) but that might be because i switched from a job where I was standing and walking all day to a job where I have to sit for four hours a day_ and later because I've been actively trying to gain muscle mass (and it seems to be working-I can see the results). I've been hungrier lately and I think i might have more fat too but i think my metabolism is just trying to adjust to the new muscle and I haven't checked my body fat percentage in a while...that being said_ if i gain too much more fat I'll have to say it's probably the pill.I say possible decreased sex drive but that may just be stress or something and sometimes it DOESN'T seem decreased-usually I'm insatiable and can't afford to go a day without masturbating but lately I've been able to miss a few days...if that continues I'll be worried_ but even without medication I'll occasionally have times where it's not as strong_ just like I occasionally have times where I'm even worse tha,M,21,3  months,1/15/2016,Lo loestrin fe

39, 2, periods and pregnancy,weight gain_ no periods at all_ crazy mood swings,"When I first started taking lo loestrin fe I was 15 going on 16 in two months my sophomore year of high school April 2014. I weighed about 115-120 lbs. and I was a happy girl always. Now I am a senior in September 2015 and just turned 17 almost 3 months ago and I weigh almost 140lbs. I don't know if I should blame it on a rough winter last year or this pill_ but I have a hard time believing that my naturally tiny and thin body randomly gained weigjt from poor health habits. Nothing about my diet or exercise changed since I started taking this but it seemed as though this happened during the winter of my junior year. All of the sudden I tried on my old prom dress and realize ""Wow. I am NOT as skinny as before"" being able to hardly zipper it. It is a confidence crushing fact I deal with every day with looking through old pictures of me from before and looking at myself now. Everything on my body has gained weight_ not just tummy or thighs. Everything. I am planning to see a doctor/gyno soon about it because I really believe it's from Lo Loestrin as a long term side effect. This random weight gain happened over Winter 2014. Also_ my mood swings are AWFUL and I didn't have a period while on this pill until this summer. It's a horrible feeling to feel as though you are not yourself.

40, 1, Birth control/heavy painful periods,I gained so much weight and became completely uncomfortable in my body. None of my clothes fit right. I was miserable. I constantly complained to my husband about my weight gain and got on his nerves. The weight was mainly in my lower stomach. Not cute!! My self-esteem and body image was ruined. I also could not get a good nights rest. The bags under my eyes were unbelievable. I would cramp all month! Just random cramping out of the blue.,My periods were shorter but the pain was still the same. I used to pass blood clots with my period and that stopped as well. I am so frustrated because I can not choose between having a shorter period and being overweight and uncomfortable in my skin. I took Microgetstin 1/20 for 3 months and lost the weight but my periods are longer and I started passing clots again. I would not recommend Lo Loestrin to anyone!

My beautiful_ athletic_ active daughter started using this birth control method four years ago. She has fought a twenty pound weight gain ever since while staying very physically active in college.  Her acne which she kept under control in high school worsened significantly.  She complained of gas_ nausea_  and stomach aches. She went from being very happy and well adjusted to mood swings of being extremely fatigued_  moody_  irritable_  stressed_ sad_ and flat out angry at times. She didn't understand it. I put it down to a highly active and demanding college schedule and changing  majors and schools once. However_ she has not felt good for most of this time.  We never thought of her birth control.  She even went to her physician and they found nothing out of sorts. Being young one would have no idea that hormone birth control could do that and I did not have that trouble. I stumbled across this forum while researching lo loestrin fe and pregnancy symptoms thinking her hormones were out of whack for that reason. I am devastated this birth control severely affected her for four years and I thought she was suffering from college stress and fatigue.,F,22,4  years,7/26/2015,Lo loestrin fe

Then the second month I started to experience mood swings and constantly feeling tired. I lost my sex drive completely. By the end of that pack my mood swings turned into a psychotic rage over the littelest things. I finished 22 of the pills from my 3rd pack and I am now having insomnia for the last 3 nights. I cry at the drop of a hat and when I'm not crying I'm screaming. My husband and I have agreed that this pill is not for me and I have discontinued as of last night. I also have not had a period the entire time I've been taking it_ not even spotting.

Swelling of breast.(painful),I was on this pill for 1 full month and 15 days into month 2. Then i just couldnt take it anymore.At first i noticed i was gaining weight at a very rapid rate and im very active. Then my breast started to swell to the point where it felt like i was breast feeding again. Im a smaller chest size woman so any change in size is going to hurt like all hell i went from a 34 nearly b to a 36 D in this short period of time and i was in pain all day every day i just wanted to cry. Then the breakthough bleeding started to happen and i took the pills as prescribed didnt miss a beat. my hair began to come out in clumps in the shower and my stomach stayed upset 90 percent of the time. Then by the end of month 1 i was angry all the time didnt matter what it was i was upset. no sex drive whatsoever and i couldnt sleep i would sleep then get up or sleep all day and feel even more tired then before. I told my husband i couldnt do this anymore and i am going to try a natural cream instead. i went off of these horrible pills 3 days ago and still no relief just a lot of heavy bleeding and cramping. my best advice to any of you run away and tell the doctor not just no but HELL NO.

The third month was a short period and by the 4th month I didn't have a period at all. I literally thought I was going crazy or something was seriously wrong with me because I felt horrible. It wasn't until recently that I realized it was this BC pill that was causing me to experience all the ridiculous symptoms... I was literally exhausted but couldn't get to sleep. Once I fell asleep I was up 2 hours later. Definitely felt depressed and sooo angry all the time. Hair came out in clumps in the shower. I seemed to be nauseous quite a bit and had diarrhea almost every day. It is just not worth taking the pill with these side effects.

This pill so far has had the most dramatic side effects. I bleed for two weeks straight when I first started. I have always suffered from anxiety and depression.The first month on this my anxiety was really bad but I can't say it was the pills fault. It might of just been legitimately my nerves. Any way after the first month my period was very light_ not painful_ and after getting used to taking the pill every day my nerves have subsided and I feel level. The dizziness hasn't gone away though. It comes in spurts and I know I just need to drink some water and sit down for a second. DO NOT SMOKE!!

Now I don't feel dizzy or nauseous_ thankfully_ and everything's going well. My body hasn't fully adjusted yet though_ and I'm getting my period randomly for several days in the middle of my pack_ and not when I take the placebos. But_ it is lighter and much less painful so far_ which is great. The acne is definitely calming down and any pimples I do get aren't too bad and are easy to manage (ie they go away quickly). Although my boobs are sore as hell_ I don't mind because they've definitely gotten bigger (which is never a bad thing :)).

I told my doctor that and she prescribed this. My moods were insane! The slightest thing would set me off and I'd go through about 20 moods in 10min. My periods were no longer normal. I bled for two weeks every two weeks for the first 6 months. I called my doctor's office every couple weeks but they continued to tell me keep taking it.

I have never had children_ butI wonder if it is the same thing as pregnancy brain? I stopped it 2 days ago. It was like a brain fog. I researched that some BC can suppress parts of your brain including sex drive and memory. No one else listed that here_ but it affected me in a big way! I will rough through the pain.

Sometimes I'd be bitter_ others just sad_ and other times I'd be pissy. I sort of just dealt with it_ knowing that it was coming_ but also knowing that it would eventually go away. But whatever happened this time (about 18 month in)_ it was worse than ever. As of 9/24_ I began to have the worst breakdowns I could ever have. It made me so unlike myself_ so unhappy and scared of everything...for no real reason. Even silly things that I logically knew were stupid would make me burst into full-out sobs and tears.

93, 3, lower blood pressure,upset stomach_ cramping_ light headaches doesn't last long tho_ spotting_ bloating_ sometimes emotional,ive been on this pill for about 4months now_ im down to my last 2 pills in the pack and have really experienced a period_ about 1 1/2 week proyer to the week of my cycle I spotted on and off just about every day_ when the week of my cycle came down I didn't see anything bout a little spot of blood on the first day my cycle originally starts_ I liked the pill before I was getting my cycle regular the first 3 months now all of a sudden I guess a change in hormones_ trying to stick it out the best way I can before I find something else to do_ im just glad to know im not the only one experiencing these symptoms,F,26,4  months 1X D,7/25/2014Email,Lo loestrin fe
94, 2, Painful cramping and heavy periods,Painful headaches and acne 3 days into taking Lo Loestrin. I attributed it to my period (since you start on the 1st day of bleeding); however_ after being a week out from my period I am still experiencing painful headaches and acne. I am normally a happy person but I have noticed that I have been extremely unhappy the last 10days. Uncharacteristically unhappy. The other day I was ANGRY_ very angry for no reason. Everything angered me_ even the way my shadow looked. This has never happened to me and I suspect it is due to the hormones.,This doesn't mean that Lo Loestrin won't work for someone else. I just don't react well with hormones. I would say for that if someone else tries the medication that they give it a fair go but be aware of their emotional state. Side effects seem to come out of nowhere_ so be aware.,F,25,2  weeks 1X D,7/9/2014Email,Lo loestrin fe
95, 4, Bad cramps,In my first month I had a regular period after switching from reclipsine (another great BCP). With in first six months I had become very emotional and had dreams to nightmares just about every night. Around 7-8 month things seemed to lessen. Sex drive is non existent and the weight gain sucks _but it's a price to pay for not having painful cramping and heavy irregular flow.,,F,26,1  years1mg,7/1/2014,Lo loestrin fe
96, 5, I am still taking this pill.,Only side effect. My period comes every 3-4 months. Only last 1-3 days. Most cases its over in 24 hrs. In other cases its so light that I only use a panty liner. I've had the same box of tampons for 2 years. I only use a tampon if I am going somewhere_ where there may not be a bathroom. No headaches_  no weight loss or gain. I highly recommend this pill.,,F,36,1  daysnormal,4/29/2014,Lo loestrin fe

98, 1, birth control,After a month of taking this I stopped getting my period which was awesome but after being on it for a year I started getting my period every ten days. But besides that it caused me to break out and I started geting cystic acne badly which I have never gotten until I started taking this_ I gained 5 pounds every month_ and I started getting migraines 5 times a week and I don't have a history of migrains.,,F,24,1  years,3/3/2014,Lo loestrin fe
99, 2, birth control,Weight gain over time_ low sex drive_ difficulty when stopping,Almost immediately regulated my cycle_ but 10lb. Weight gain over time that I was only able to lose after stopping.  Very irregular_ difficult periods with extreme PMS when I quit.  Also_ very high co-pay with my insurance (United healthcare).,F,29,10  months 1X D,2/26/2014Email,Lo loestrin fe
100, 5, birth control_ regulate monthly cyc,during months 1 and 2 I had mood swings and a low sex drive_  but after that everything went back to normal - My period does not come every month,I didnt have break through bleeding - I would get my monthly every other month and only for 2 days with minimal bleeding (enough to get by with a panty liner) - I take my pill the same time every day and I have never missed a pill since starting - I have not gained or lost any weight - I really like the pill because I dont get my usual PMS systems during the month (headaches_ lower back pain_ painful cramping_ heavy bleeding),F,38,9  months 1X D,11/23/2013Email,Lo loestrin fe
101, 5, Birth control,Irregular periods for first 3-4 months.,I FINALLY feel normal on BC! I have been on BC since age 16 (now 26) and have run the gamut of side effects. From headaches_ to mood swings_ to acne and pain_ low sex drive has been my biggest complaint over the past few years. My gyno prescribed this due to my complaints of low libido. I tried it and for the first 4 months I really didn't notice a change. I missed a couple of periods all together which freaked me out_ and I started looking into the copper IUD. However_ by months 5/6_ I started to realize my sex drive returning. I thought maybe it was a fluke_ but it stuck around. I realize now (on month 11) that I have had a period every other month_ so I'm less concerned about pregnancy. I take the pill every evening between 9 and 12 usually. Have not had any breakthrough bleeding except for when I missed a day and a half and had super light spotting. My periods on other BCs have been very heavy_ but on this_ even having a period every 2 months_ they are light and end within 4 days. My moods have been very stable_ my face is usually pretty clear (except week before my period when I get some breakouts)_ and I just feel great overall!! My cramps have also lessened. I will definitely stick with this pill_ as I finally feel like I found the right match for me! I love that it is low in hormones. The only downside is the cost. Luckily_ I have great insurance that makes it about $33/month when I get it in packs of 3. Yay!,F,26,11  months 1X D,11/19/2013Email,Lo loestrin fe
102, 2, Birth control/Extended Periods,Anxiety levels skyrocket while on this medication; I have gained nearly 15 pounds in 5 months with no change in diet or exercise. I had light bleeding for the first two months on this pill.  People who claim that they take it an hour late and start bleeding are 100% correct.  If I do not take it exactly on time_ I will start feeling cramping almost immediately.  I have an almost constant upset stomach and I am always worried that I am sick or pregnant.,I'd like to know where everyone is getting this for $50 - something a month.  It's $108.00 at my local Rite Aid.  Ugh.  Cheaper than formula and diapers_ I suppose.  My boyfriend and I are grandparents_ but still young enough to conceive ourselves_ so we find ourselves with this.,F,43,5  months 1X D,11/14/2013Email,Lo loestrin fe
103, 3, Dysmenorrhea,My period has been on for THREE WEEKS. And I have CRAMPS as well.,I am trying to wait the three months and allow this bc to level it out but it is getting harder and harder each day. My period has been on for three weeks. I feel like an emotional rollarcoaster but I'm a very emotional person normally so I don't know if it's the pills or my natural self. I vomit during my regular cycle and I have extremely painful cramps so I'm hoping this pill will make things better. I have to decide which is more tolerable_ painful periods or nonstop bleeding.,F,33,3  weeks 1X D,10/22/2013Email,Lo loestrin fe
104, 3, Birth Control,First three months were great. Light spotting sometimes_ a little edgy emotionally but nothing too crazy. I also felt a little extra tried and less motivated. The best part was no weight gain so I was happy. Randomly would get period - it was very unpredictable. Then on month 4_ I started to feel extremely tired and could not focus at work_ was losing sex drive and I started to have extreme anxiety for no logical reason. NOT WORTH IT.,,F,26,4  months 1X D,10/14/2013,Lo loestrin fe
105, 5, heavy periods- pregnancy-anemia,Loss of period. Always wondering if I was pregnant. No weight gain with easy weightloss. Some hair loss. Not ass emotional as other BC. Was on mirena before which was horrible with crazy emotions_ painful cramps_ migraines.,,F,25,3  years1,9/21/2013,Lo loestrin fe
106, 5, Birth Control_ Heavy Periods_ PCOS,None whatsoever,The only BC pill I will ever take. Lowest possible dose of hormones_ which means I barely get my period at all anymore after the initial 3 months. Due to PCOS I used to get unbearable cramps/back pain and had majorly heavy bleeding for a week. Now it's pretty nonexistant! I like having the extra dose of Iron_ too.,F,27,1  years10mcg 1X D,9/19/2013,Lo loestrin fe
107, 2, pregnancy,Irritated!!! Since Lo Loestrin I have Lo LoPATIENTS!  Within the week I have been on this pill I have been ANGRY. Everything pisses me off. I can't focus because in so mad. I have no problem expressing my anger either. I feel sorry for the people around me. I'm tired and groggy. When I'm having a conversation my speech is slurred and I don't make sense. Like I'm confused and disoriented. Before I fall asleep my mind races thinking of the most stupidest things like scenarios and I hold conversations with myself. I wake up with headaches because I haven't allowed myself to relax my brain. Oh and I get cravings like I'm on my period. So do your self a favor. Stay away!,,F,29,8  days,7/30/2013Email,Lo loestrin fe
108, 3, Menstral back pain,The 1st 3 months I didn't get my period which was great because I initially began BC for the terrible back pain I would get before and during that time of the month. I'm on my 7th month now and have had a few periods but they are very sporadic even though I am very diligent about taking my pills. I'm only off by a few hours. My periods are fairly light with minimal cramping but it sucks not knowing when they're coming. I've had bad reactions to BC in the past so I'm happy with the lack of terrible side effects with this one_ I just wish there was more consistency.,,F,38,7  months,7/20/2013,Lo loestrin fe

110, 1, Painful cramps/birth control,This medicine robbed me of four months of my life. I got horrible insomnia_ anxiety_ copius hair loss (hair coming out by the handfuls) I literally have bald patches_ constant spotting_ 2 periods a month. It didn't even help my cramps. This pill is not only expensive_ its absolute toxic trash. The doctor kept telling me to give it time_ that I would adjust. I can't imagine they care about their patients insisting they keep subjecting their bodies to this crap. Whoever designed this drug really hates women. I DO NOT recommend. No weight gain AT LEAST. How horrid. I just want to cry with what it has done to my life. Not to mention I have no sex drive at all. Yes_ this is GREAT birth control! It ensures you never ever have sex!!!,,F,37,4  months1/10 1X D,5/24/2013Email,Lo loestrin fe

112, 4, ,loss of sex drive,In the beginning_ I bled for almost 2 weeks during the first 2 months. It was better during the 3rd month and now I barely even have a period_ which is awesome! You have to be patient and give it 3 months. I think it's worth it. It has helped with my menstrual migraines as well. However_ the worst side effect is I have no sex drive and my husband has noticed. I'm considering trying another pill but I'm afraid since this one seems so easy. It's the lowest dose of estrogen on the market which is safer for older women. It's also expensive though since there is no generic yet. I pay almost $90/month.,F,41,6  months 1X D,1/1/2013,Lo loestrin fe

Was told by the doctor to take the first day of bleeding - well i did that and have had spotting every since.

116, 3, birth control & prevent migraines,spotting if i took a pill even an hour late. this stopped after a few months.  just realized that my anxiety & paranoia started around same time as I started the pills.  around week 3 of the cycle i start to get really anxious and paranoid.  I suspect my fiance is cheating even though there's absolutely no reason_ get really short tempered at work. I do not have a temper at all_ but I start to get really aggrevated in week 3 and am really crabby.  I've also lost my sex drive_ which in 40 years has never happened to me.,"in my late 30s I started getting severe menstrual migaraines the week of my period.  i would have to call in sick every month.  These pills stopped the monthly migraines_ but I have to take the pills continually and skip the ""fake"" pills at the end.  On other pills i wanted to eat all the time_ but my appetite is ok on this pill. I get the urge to eat a lot the last week in the cycle_ but I would get like that when I'm not on pills too.  I hate the anxiety/paranoia/cranky side effects_ but I feel like I have to stay on this pill since it's preventing my crippling migraines.",F,40,10  months 1X D,8/15/2012Email,Lo loestrin fe
117, 1, Borderline anemia - regulate period,Racing thoughts at night_ waking up in the middle of the night_ hot flashes_ disoriented_ dizziness_ anxiety_ painful breasts_ heavy bleeding_ dry mouth.,I started this medication the first day of my period with the fist dose at 8pm. That night I tossed and turned and could not stop my thoughts. I normally do not have a problem sleeping.  I also had hot flashes (never have hot flashes!) and a very very dry mouth. The next day I felt groggy and disoriented but it eventually wore off. I decided to take the pill the following night - same thing - woke up in the middle of the night with hot flashes. The next day at work I would not come out of my office because of the anxiety_ my breasts were very painful and I was bleeding quite heavily - more than normal. My heart was fluttering and I felt as if I couldn't walk correctly and my mouth was dry.  I had so much water weight that by the end of the day I could not button my pants and I am not blowing this out of proportion.  By around 2pm I felt well enough to actually work. I NEVER feel like this so I can only assume it's the medication. For me it's not worth it to see if it would get better.  I would not be able to work and I don't even want to imagine feeling like that for days. If this pill makes you feel this way - do your self a favor and quit right away.  Synthetic progesterone is known to cause emotional and mental liability - you are not going crazy - it is the pill. After one day of stopping the pill all the symptoms practically vanished. I was really hoping this would have worked for me but the side effects were deal breakers.,F,,2  days 1X D,8/14/2012,Lo loestrin fe
