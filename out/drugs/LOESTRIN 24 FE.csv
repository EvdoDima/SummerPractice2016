0, 4, Regulate periods and prevent preg,headaches weekly no period no weight gain ,since I am sexually active it was scary not getting my period until I did a little research and other people hadn't gotten theirs either. it's nice but kind of stresses me out. the only thing I can't stand is the headaches I've been getting weekly from it.,F,,1  months1,6/2/2016,Loestrin 24 fe
1, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Extreme mood disorder_ anxiety_ hopelessness. Anxiety_ paranoia_ anger_ cramps_ restlessness_ acne_ weight gain_ problems with appetite,I've been on this pill since january. At first I thought it was going to be a good fit as I'd been on it years prior. My face_ back and arms started to develop sever cystic acne. I thought this was normal until my body adjusted. I was wrong. I have been incredibly moody to the point that I'm either disconnected from family and friends or I'm tearing my relationship apart because of how severe my mood swings are. I've also become paranoid and have been experiencing anxiety. I've had one full blown panic attack and have felt like I was on the verge of several more. I'm stopping this pill now. I need to get back to my normal self. I do not recommend this form of birth control at all.,F,28,1  months,4/28/2016Email,Loestrin 24 fe
2, 1, Prevent pregnancy,EXTREME depression_ anxiety_ panic attacks_ anger_ sensitivity_ OVERWHELMING FEELING OF SADNESS. Drove me to see a psychiatrist for mental issues. Completely affected me as a person. No longer had a drive for life. I do not recommend this medication at all. It also caused slight acne but this was nothing compares to the mental drama this out me through. I am so happy I finally got to the bottom of why I lost my passion for life.,,F,28,1  days,2/24/2016,Loestrin 24 fe
3, 5, Birth control & pms,When starting the pill some cramps and spotting for the first 2-3 months but after that cramps and spotting stopped completely. At around 7 months I was getting my period every 2nd or 3rd month After a year I rarely have a monthly period and when I do it's very light and you could almost consider it just spotting (every 4 months or so),This pill has helped my pms symptoms_ since I don't get much of a period anymore_ I don't have cramps.,F,19,2  years1 x D,2/15/2016,Loestrin 24 fe
4, 1, Acne,HIGH ANXIETY_ depression_ acne (in areas associated with hormones).,I have always had anxiety but it was to a tolerable extent. This BC greatly exacerbated my anxiety and caused me to even seek out a therapist because of it. I would not recommend taking this BC if you are already prone to anxiety or depression or have dealt with it in the past. It also did not seem to help with my acne in the slightest_ which was the reason I went on it in the first place.,F,18,3  months 1X D,1/20/2016,Loestrin 24 fe
5, 2, To prevent pregnancy,I feel so cheated. The last month I have been a complete B to my boyfriend and my mom because of this pill. I have random temper spikes and the fact that it's messing with my relationship makes me so angry. I have basically 0 period and a huge loss in sex drive. Like complete loss. I'm so unhappy with this pill.,At least it did its primary purpose.,F,17,1  months30 MG,6/15/2015,Loestrin 24 fe
6, 3, Regulate period/Prevent Pregnancy,Nipple sensitivity_ minor spotting.,I've been on it for three months now. I had gotten a period two weeks ago. Still heavy but shorter than before. I haven't experienced anything unusual while being on it. I do like it.  For my periods I'm giving it another month until I visit my doctor_ and if there's no change I may switch.,F,22,3  months,5/10/2015,Loestrin 24 fe
7, 3, heavy and unregulated periods,seriously increased appetite. extreme mood swings. increased sadness. increased anxiety. burning and itching sensation of the nipples,personally I feel it counteracted my ADHD medicine_ which was very annoying and unproductive. it did help regulate my period_ but I felt it had more side effects than helped. I didn't really want to start BC but my doctor recommended I do for health and family medical history. I don't think it was a horrible drug but for me it had generally annoying side effects.,F,20,3  months 1X D,3/18/2015,Loestrin 24 fe
8, 1, Contraceptive,Nipple discharge_ slight weight gain first month_ weigh loss on third month_ no period_ breakthrough bleeding_ anxiety_ frequent urination_ dry mouth_ shortness of breath_ heavy discharge on brown pills_ night sweats_ not able to sleep_ nausea.,I have yet to experience any consistency with this pill. I am taking Lomedia FE_ the generic equivalent to Loestrin FE. The first month I started on the first day of my period and did not have a period at the end of the pack. One day of spotting on the second pack. Not many side effects at that time besides breast growth and acne. Period came heavy and 3 days before brown pill. Then_ the third month came along. I immediately dropped weight on the first pill_ started to experience breast discharge_ anxiety and a full period on the second week. The whole month I had frequent urination_ I was convinced it was pregnancy. But how? We used back up 3 times over. Major anxiety fluctuating through each week_ no appetite_ sensitive to smell.  I knew it was the pill. Has this happened to anyone else? I am switching bc methods ASAP.,F,,3  months 1X D,2/5/2015,Loestrin 24 fe
9, 4, Prevent pregnancy,"Irregularity of period - spotting almost every month in addition to monthly ""period"" which evolved into just the spotting during active pills. SLIGHT anxiety at start of each pill pack. Infrequent heart palpitations and slightly elevated blood pressure_",This pill is the best ive been on and ive tried at least 6 kinds over the past 13 years.  It never regulated my period_ and it makes my libido very cyclical and predictable. It seems to control the fluxuations of mood_ and overall i find that it really doesnt cause me any day to day issues. it obviously works to prevent pregnancy! breast size has steadily grown over the years i am on it.,F,29,4  years 1X D,12/31/2014,Loestrin 24 fe
10, 1, to control heavy menstrual cycle,heavier periods_ exhaustion and massive hair loss,In 2012_ my then doctor prescribed that I take Loestrin 24 FE because my cycle was ridiculously heavy and unpredictable.  It was not uncommon for me to have more than one heavy cycle in a single month.  There were many side effects but the worst_ by far_ for me was that the medication caused 2/3 of my hair to fall out; my hair fell out in clumps/handfuls_ leaving my scalp sore for 6 months or more.  I stopped talking this monster medicine after 4 months of torture.  So_ not only did my period not get any better . . . I became perniciously anemic -- but I also now had to deal with the loss of my perennially thick hair.  That was two years ago.  Thankfully_ my hair has grown back . . . not the length (yet) but certainly the fullness/thickness.  My periods are_ unfortunately_ the same.  I now take a prescription iron supplement which has been a God send.  Stay away from this birth control.,F,50,4  months 1X D,12/29/2014,Loestrin 24 fe
11, 3, Birth Control_ PMS_ Bad Cramps,I was switched to this drug_ due to their no longer making the drug Loestrin 24FE. They now_ have a generic equivalent called Lomedia 24 FE_ which I am on. I can say this_ I do not believe in birth control pills really doing anything much_ besides helping to keep you from pregnant. I suffer with PMS_ it does nothing to help with that. I suffer with heavy bleeding and it does nothing to help that either_ nor does it help with menstrual cramping as well. I experience mild nausea with it_ whenever I start a new pack.I am able to deal with it_ since it eventually subsides with a few days anyways_ and doesn't keep me from eating at all.  I do find that this pill does cause weight gain_ and that weight gain is hard to get rid of. Luckily_ I have not had problems with experiencing daily headaches while on this pill_ which is a plus. But_ other than keeping my menstrual cycle coming down at the same time that its schedulec to_ it really doesn't provide any other pisitive benefits to my body. I,My best advice is to use condons_ unless you have a special need that requires you to start taking birth control pills.,F,39,6  months 1X D,8/18/2014Email,Loestrin 24 fe

13, 1, prevent pregnancy,Suicidal thoughts_ anxiety_ depression all the lovely mental health side effects which also went along with cystic acne and migraines. I'm a very happy to the point of being bubbly person_ I can't believe it took me this long to realize it was the birth control that was doing this to me. Horrible! it's also effected my relationship since I have anxiety and freak out on him for no reason. I'm trying the non hormonal IUD I'm so done with the hormones.,,F,24,1  years,8/19/2013Email,Loestrin 24 fe

15, 1, birth control,4 bloodclots in my leg and pulminary embolism. I had no prior health issues & have never smoked. Doctors said it was because of my birth control pill. 2 years later had a heart attack and now a year later I have gallbladder disease due to Loestrin 24Fe. Please do not take this pill your health is too important and your life is too precious..,,F,32,5  months,8/4/2013Email,Loestrin 24 fe
16, 5, Contraception_ cycle regulation,None really.,Been on this a while and have had no issues with weight gain_ mood swings_ acne_ etc. My periods are very light (more like spotting) and last maybe 3-4 days. Cramps are virtually non-existent. I do get a bit bloated and break out just a bit before my period (neither of which was really a problem before taking this pill) but it's not bad at all. One thing: for the past few months I've been spotting about 2 weeks into pack - lasts for a few days and I still get my period as normal. I thought maybe I needed a stronger dose of hormone but my school's gynecologist suggested waiting as I've been under some intense stress finishing up med school and that spotting was a problem she commonly saw in other students. So I'll heed that advice since I've been on this for years and prefer not to switch unless absolutely necessary.,F,27,3  years 1X D,5/13/2013Email,Loestrin 24 fe

24, 3, Contraception,Anxiety_ Leg Tightness_ Problems Sleeping,I started taking LoEstrin 24 Fe as a birth control almost a week ago.  I was pleased the first couple day and then I started noticing that I have been very anxious.  I thought it was from too much coffee on an empty stomach or from wedding planning.  I then noticed today that my legs felt heavy_ tight when bent_ almost as if they were swollen.  I was very skeptical about taking birth control.  I guess I read the manual that came with it every day for a month until starting it.  I was satisfied with it until I noticed my legs and realized how anxious I have been.  I am going to contact my doctor and see what he thinks.  When he prescribed this BC to me he said that everyone loved it and that it would be the best option for me.  I have no medical problems_ am not over weight_ and do not smoke.  The only reason I am taking this is because I will be getting married in a week and want to use BC as my form of contraception.  One other side effect is less discharge_ which is a plus for me.  I have always suffered from alot of discharge and I noticed that it is gotten so much better.  I no longer have to wear panty liners everyday.  If you have ever had this problem_ I know you understand how that feels.,F,22,5  days 1X D,7/12/2012Email,Loestrin 24 fe

26, 3, for birth control,pretty bad mood swings/recent heart flutters or palpitations/ no period whatsoever the entire time I have been on any brand of loestrin,I was extremely against taking birth control_ i think it is completely unnatural_ and I was very scared about it. However_ even though my boyfriend and I try not to have sex_ we sometimes mess up and because I didn't want to get pregnant_ I decided maybe I should do this. I took Loestrin 24 FE for a full year_ and not once did I get my period which made me skeptical because I believe every woman should have one_ it's only natural. The only other side effect I had was occasionally_ usually by myself_ and in the car for some reason_ i would have these EXTREME anger issues. I don't cuss_ but when this happened_ I would scream_ cuss_ you name it. Then after me screaming and crying because I was so pissed for the stupidest reasons_ I would be fine. (That is not me!) I discussed changing it with my doctor and she recommended Lo Loestrin because it has a lower dosage of hormones and since I didn't like the foreign not real hormones in me in the first place she said i may like this option. I was on it for about 5 months and didn't have any issues except still no period. I went to go pick up more from my doctor_ and they were out. she gave me a pack of loestrin 24 fe again saying that it wouldn't be a problem_ but after not even 2 weeks of taking it I am experiencing heart flutters. My OBGYN said that it couldn't be from the Loestrin_ but I think it is. My main doctor told me stop taking it immediately. I am nervous about how my body will react to me stopping in the middle of a pack.,F,22,18  months 1X D,5/31/2012Email,Loestrin 24 fe

I have lost  10 pounds this month because I just don't want to eat I have to force myself_ nothing seems appealing anymore. I am def. not myself and I am not starting the second pack.

I am hoping for less acne and lighter periods. I haven't had any trouble with my period in the past. The continuous spotting is a drag and I think it's my body regulating and getting in line with this pill.

32, 2, Moderate Acne_ Sexually active.,For the first month I experienced severe mood swings_ I felt angry all the time and began to break out even more with painful cystic acne. Thought by month 2 it would subside but it didn't ! Mood swings would come and go but the acne issue is still there and my main reason for going on this BC was for the acne. It's worked well with my period _ cramps are very light as well as my period but overall I'm not pleased.  I would stick around for month 3 since your body is suppose to get use to the hormones around this time but this BC is not for me.,,F,26,2  months,3/5/2012,Loestrin 24 fe

41, 2, Avoid Conception,3 months on Loestrin 24 FE - Cramps_ moody_ breakthrough and heavy bleeding early but no period during iron pills_ bloated_ acne breakouts_ swollen breasts_ exhausted all the time_ lack of desire for relations,"Tried Loestrin 24 FE about 8 weeks after a miscarriage because bf and I didn't want another unplanned pregnancy_ first week was fine. I noticed I was bloated and breasts were swollen and I was getting PMS-y...Then two weeks in the break through bleeding started and it lasted for about 6 days then I had a full on period soaking SUPER tampons.  That lasted about 3 days and tapered off.  When my period was supposed to start there was nothing.  I continued taking it thinking my body was just adjusting to the hormones_ and a week and a half later the break through bleeding starts again for about 6 days again_ then a full period for 4 days complete with cramping and bloating and clots.  This happened again the following month.  I was also napping like I was prego again_ that was enough to scare the BF and he wanted  me to take a pg test after the first month. I gave the pill 3 months but with the crazy bleeding_ bloating_ cramping_ and being exhausted all the time I'd rather go back to condoms and counting days (we've been together for 8 yrs with this method and only 1 pregnancy). Along with the pill I take Adderall XR for adhd_ this BC has me exhausted while on the adderall. That's a little frightening to know this medication takes that much out of a person that even with prescription ""uppers"" all I wanted to do was nap.

46, 3, PMDD,terrible rash_ chronic watery diarrhea_ terrible mood swings_ bloating _ headache. horrible cramping on lower left abdomen. chronic itching_ diabetes_ nausea_ hot flashes_ night sweats_ no sex drive_ lack of concentration_ migraines_,I writing about LO LOESTRIN FE - there wasn't another place to put this information. I started taking LO LOESTRIN FE in 2/11...It is now 10/11... I started this prescription in 2/11 when I went to see a new OB/GYN after having my period for 6 weeks. They found fibroids and removed them and prescribed LO LOESTRIN for my PMS ( horrible) My period stopped almost immediately - YEA! And for the first 2 months everything was going well. Then the rash started. This was not a normal rash. My skin was bright red across my upper torso - everyone thought I had sunburn. Then came the lesions. They would start off as small pimples almost and they would ITCH horribly. They burst with just a touch and drained clear fluid. For the longest time I thought it was an allergic reaction to a body wash. No one_ not even the doctors knew what it was. If that wasn't bad enough_ when I scratched_ they scarred. I currently have bright_ round purple scars all over my body. Then of course came the mood swings - crying for no reason_ depressed _tired_ voracious appetite... MY OB/GYN said it was my meds for depression_ My shrink said it was my inability to cope. I can't begin to tell you how many days I missed at work because of it_ I had to get FMLA because I would have lost my job without it. As it was_ I fell so far behind on my bills that I get constant shut off notices and my bank is threatening foreclosure. Added to all this was the chronic watery diarrhea.

47, 2, Acne_ menstrual pain,Hair loss_ dehabilitating mouth ulcers_ boil-like lesions on body (specifically by buttocks/abdomen region)_ breast tenderness_ appetite increase,As soon as I started taking this_ I developed awful mouth ulcers.  For months_ it literally felt as if I was walking around with Lemonheads clamped in my jaws constantly.  I couldn't eat any food that was the slightest bit spicy or acidic without being in pain.  I also developed painful boil-like sores on my body_ particularly on my buttocks/abdominal regions.  I typical have thick_ strong hair_ but it came out by the handful every time I would shower on this BC.  I also skipped a period for the first time since I was 12_ and my skin broke out worse than before (I was previously on oral antibiotics for my skin that helped immensely but unfortunately also gave me oral thrush).  I quit on the last row of my second pack because it was affecting my body too negatively.,F,21,2  months 1X D,10/25/2011,Loestrin 24 fe
48, 3, Birth Control,period every 2 weeks_ spotting_ mild acne flare ups_ weight gain_ high blood pressure_ yeast infection,The best thing about this BCP is I had no changes in mood or depression and felt overall pretty good while on it. I'm not pregnant_ so that good as well.The WORST thing is the non-stop bleeding. I'm lucky if I can get through a whole week without spotting or starting a period. I went to see my doctor today and she decided to take me off Loestrin because it has caused me to have high blood pressure and gain weight in a short period of time. She's switching me to Safyral (a new variation of Yasmin). I tolerated Yasmin well in the past_ so we'll see how it goes.,F,26,1.5  months 1X D,10/15/2011Email,Loestrin 24 fe
49, 2, Birth control,Terrible mood swings_ Depression_ No sex drive what so ever,I was in Zovia 1/35E for a year and then switched to Loestrin 24 fe because I gained weight on Zovia but that was a terrible mistake. I want to switch back to Zovia or try something new. But no sex drive_ and being in a relationship a year & a half of that 2 years was the worst feeling.,F,19,2  years1/20 1X D,10/12/2011Email,Loestrin 24 fe
50, 1, Birth Control,Bloating_ headache_ weight gain_ hair loss_ appetite increase.,I have been on Ocella since 2006 and I was starting to get melasma from it. My OBGYN told me that a lower estrogen pill may fix it so I went to this. A week into lolo_ I had bleeding and severe headaches. I continued to spot and I just now finished the first pack. My hair is a little bit more oily but not bad and no acne. I am 26 years old and I have always weighed around 116. I am now 120 and I have extreme bloating during my first period timeframe on this pill. I feel very self concious about it and my work clothes are pulling to make me look like I'm pregnant. I will give the pill a month or two more and if the symptoms don't improve I will get off birth control completely. It is not worth the symptoms you have to experience in my opinion.,F,26,1  months10 1X D,10/12/2011Email,Loestrin 24 fe

52, 3, endometriosis,I am taking the new LO LOESTRIN FE 1-10 tablet- I experienced anxiety for the 1st month that has gone away_ weight loss_ decreased appetite_ breakthrough bleeding.,(on the new LO LOESTRIN)- I have tried everything for endometriosis.. most of which had bad side effects due to the high level of hormones. This is the lowest hormone pill on the market currently and has less estrogen. If high estrogen birth control does not work well for you I highly recommend this one. I have been able to lose weight unlike on any other birth control. I take a pill every day so it stops my cycles for treatment of endometriosis and it has worked pretty well with occasional breakthrough bleeding and cramps.,F,22,5  months1-10 1X D,10/9/2011Email,Loestrin 24 fe

54, 2, heavy bleeding,this pill has turned me into a crazy bitch. i used to be very light hearted and chill and don't let anything get to me. now i have insane moodswings_ everything gets to me_ i randomly get upset over something meaningless and can't stop crying_ i say mean things and then feel overcome with remorse about it later and apologize over and over_ i'm overcome with fear_ sometimes don't feel like living.. then i snap out of it and i'm fine. this is miserable and i can't believe it took me this long to figure out it was this pill. definitely not for everyone.,,F,18,4  months 1X D,9/28/2011Email,Loestrin 24 fe
55, 1, Acne,Severe depression_ cramps_ tiredness_ couldn't eat,"On the third day of taking this pill the side effects reared their ugly head and I tried to ""tough it out"" but when I couldn't eat and was losing 2 pounds a day_ I decided to stop taking the pill. The side effects were awful while I was on the pill but a couple of weeks later most of the side effects disappeared. However_ it is two months later and the depression still looms over my head everyday. Since I have always been happy_ the girl that always saw the glass half-full_ this has been a disturbing change and has forced me to seek therapy to elevate the dark cloud. I wouldn't recommend this pill to anyone_ unless they are willing to spend more money on correcting the side effects that occur when taking this pill.",F,20,5  days 1X D,9/21/2011,Loestrin 24 fe

Also got a canker sore on my tongue.,I experienced worsening side effects with each pill. I finally had to quit taking them when I had 10 pills left on my second pack.

59, 1, Heavy period & later b/c,Chest pain_ 2week periods twice a month_ MAJOR depression_ distant feeling_  major weight gain and unable to lose weight,"I first went on b/c to have lighter periods since I was taking JROTC in high school. I thought the chest pain was from working out since I normally don't work out and I thought being emotional was from a friend moving away until I became emotional over everything and went from ""daddies little girl"" to not being able to stand him. I decided maybe the sideffects would eventually go away so I continued to take the pill. After being on it around 8 months I decided to go off it b/c it wasn't helping except for cramps. I had to wear a liner almost every day for 8months and got tired of it. When I went off the pill everything went back to normal. 3months after stopping I went back on it b/c my bf wanted me too BIG MISTAKE!!!! I was on it for a little over a month and gained over 20lbs. Since I'm overweight to begin with it worried me. One night I couldn't go to sleep because chest pains were so bad it felt like I could bairly breathe. (I thought chest pains were from Exercise the first time_ the 2nd time I wasnt exercising as much) I threw the 2nd pack away after taking 6pills (during period) and my period was 2weeks long. Which started July 14th. It is now Aug. 19th and I haven't gotten my period yet as of now. (I haven't had sex after I stopped taking it) I do not recomend this b/c to anyone.On a side note_ my friend is taking the same b/c and lost her appetite.",F,16,8  months 1X D,8/19/2011Email,Loestrin 24 fe
