0, 3, Panic attacks_ anxiety_ insomnia,Weight gain_ tiredness_prolonged sleep_ lack of energy_ food cravings (especially carbs)_ restlessness immediately after taking the pill_ strange sensation in the throat,I took the Sandoz brand for 30 days_ which was prescribed to me for insomnia and anxiety/panic attacks. While it helped get my sleep back and provided reliex from anxiety and panic attacks_ it seemed to have worsened my depression. I had no energy_ was unable to exercise_ had trouble waking up in the morning going to class_ was constantly tired and sleepy. I had gained a few kilos during and felt pretty depressed about food cravings and inability to exercise. After a month_ I decided to terminate the therapy .The withdrawal symptoms were pretty bad..I had also quit smoking at the same time so I can't say for sure if they were drug or nicotine withdrawal related_ or both. I completely lost appetite for a month_ had no desire to eat and could go an entire day without food without feeling hungry. Kept waking up at night having strange sensations and unable to breath properly at times..this lasted about 2 weeks.It has been 5 months since I discontinued taking Mirtazapine and haven't had any major panic attack episodes and have been sleeping well and exercising regurarly_ however I still suffer from anxiety and depression .,F,34,30  days15MG 1X D,4/29/2015,Mirtazapine

2, 1, Insomnia,Worse than anything! I felt tired but could not seem to actually lay down and sleep. I was roaming around the house and ate a huge bowl of ice cream that I had left over in the fridge from Christmas. I never sleep eat. That made me feel like I was going to throw up this morning I didn't even get out of bed for a few hours because my stomach felt horrible.,I feel shaky_ I have a headache_ I will not put this drug into my system again. I feel spaced out today tooÂ…,F,56,1  days15 1X D,6/19/2014Email,Mirtazapine
3, 3, Depression,Weight gain was biggest side effect with Mirtazapine for me.  When I started taking it I weighed around 180 lbs.  Now I am at 220 lbs. which is way to much weight for me.,I read a lot of stories about coming off of Mirtazapine_ but I needed to get off of it because I read there is an interaction between Mirtazapine and Clonidine.  Even though Clonidine is a B/P med these two together can make your B/P real high.  I wanted to come off the Mirtazapine for that reason and for all the weight I gained.  Since I quit the Mirtazapine cold turkey I started taking 0.2 mg. of Clonidine twice a day instead of 0.1 twice a day.  It has been over a week now and I haven't noticed any withdrawal symptoms at all from the Mirtazapine.  I take one Clonidine in the morning and the other one just before I go to bed.  I also take Lunesta so I don't know if there would be any insomnia without taking it or not.  I feel a lot better and I been eating mostly protein foods to get this weight off which worked before but not while on the Mirtazapine.  The Mirtazapine makes you gain weight no matter how you eat or how little you eat.  I am so glad to get of the Mirtazapine because it makes you not be able to feel your emotions.  I was scared after reading a lot about all the withdrawal symptoms of Mirtazapine.  Clonidine is also used for ADHD which I don't have.  If you can take Clonidine without your B/P going too low this is a good way to get off of Mirtazapine.  Hope this helps somebody trying to get off of Mirtazapine.,M,63,6  years30 mg 1X D,12/17/2013,Mirtazapine
