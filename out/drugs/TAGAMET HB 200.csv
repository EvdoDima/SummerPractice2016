0, 4, ulcer,none,I've suffered from ulcers in the past. Recently started to get another one which caused abdominal pain and nausea along with headache and insomnia. Not wanting to go to the doctor this time_ I tried Tagamet hp 200. I took 2 pills (400 mg) in the morning and 2 in the evening and my symptoms and pain were gone the first day and did not return. Saved me a trip to the doctor and from having to by an RX drug. Though I wouldn't recommend taking an OTC drug like this (against the label dose which was only take up to 2 a day) before consulting with a doctor or pharmacist.,M,27,7  days,1/25/2005,Tagamet hb 200
