1, 1, trouble sleeping,I bought SLEEP II at Walgreens which is the same thing. Like 15-20 minutes later I began do feel drowsy but my mind was racing . I could't sleep because it was as if I had lost control of my mind thinking about a bunch of negative stuff that made no sense. My heart was also racing. Even the next day when I woke up_ I felt anxious. I got really scared because my hands and feet felt cold. I thought it was never going to end which made me even more anxious. It was horrible.,,F,25,1  days25mg 1X D,4/5/2013Email,Diphenhydramine hcl
