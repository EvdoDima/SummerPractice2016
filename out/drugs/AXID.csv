0, 1, Acid reflux,Horrific bloating_ next day none of my rings would fit_ whole system became totally stuck (constipation)_ incredible sleepiness as if I'd taken a sleeping pill_ stomach ache_ weight gain_ flu like feeling_ instant depression... This was the worst experience ever!,Adverse effects were so severe I had to quit taking this. Effects only wore off 5 days after taking it. I also have Sjogren's syndrome_ I wonder if this has any bearing on the side effects.... Irony is that clinical studies claim nizatidine might acutally be beneficial for Sjogren's as it could increase saliva production. Unfortunately_ I did not notice this effect either_ but maybe I gave up too soon....,F,47,2  days150 2X D,12/6/2014Email,Axid
1, 4, heartburn,None,This works very well.  I take 150mg/day. I used to have heartburn before and after each meal & I rarely have flareups now. It's made a big difference.,F,51,5  years,1/15/2009Email,Axid
2, 5, Acid Reflux,None,My son_ 8 months old_ has been on Axid since he was two months old as well.  It does not stop his spitting up but it does seem to make him less uncomfortable.,M,0.8,6  months,4/19/2007,Axid
3, 5, Acid reflux symtoms,I experienced no side effects from using this drug.,My doc initially prescribed Prilosec and Prevacid_ each of which caused me stomach pain_ diarrhea and other side effects.  Axid gave me relief with absolutely no side effects.   I was curious why AXID which has no known side effects is prescribed after first trying others which each have several KNOWN side effects.   I suspect that it's because AXID doesn't have a a billion dollar ad campaign and an army of drug reps hyping it to the nation's doctors everyday.   If you've experienced side effects with Prilosec_ Nexium or Prevacid which are equal to or worse than the symptom for which they are prescribed_ ask your doc to try AXID for you.,M,55,3  months,3/18/2007,Axid
4, 4, Reflux,None,My son has been taking Axid for about 5 months (since he was 2 months old).  He has Reflux and while the Axid doesn't do much to eliminate the Reflux_ it has made his discomfort much better.,M,0.5,5  months,9/4/2005,Axid
