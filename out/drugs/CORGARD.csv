1, 1, HTN,This drug made me extremely drowsy so if you have or care for small children I definitely wouldn't recommend it. The worse side effect of all is hair loss!! Every time I shampoo my hair I lose a palm full. Especially across the top. I haven't ever had a problem with hair loss until I started this medication. I am going to my physician tomorrow and demand a new medication.I would only recommend to a bald person. No offense. Thank God for wigs and extensions.,,F,36,2  months20,11/19/2015,Corgard
2, 5, Mitral Valve Prolapse & A-Fib,From the beginning this drug has caused NO side effects. My daily dose is 10 MG_ which controls the MVP_ but when I feel  A-Fib trying to start up_ I can up the dose to 20MG.,,F,72,35  years10 -20 MG 1X D,5/21/2015Email,Corgard
3, 5, Migraines,No side effects at all,I have taken corgard 40mg q day for 25 years.. It truly gave me my life back!! No migraines at all and I was going to the ER at least four times a week in horrible pain!!!,F,52,1  days40mg,12/26/2014,Corgard
4, 4, Performance anxiety_ tremor,Very sluggish; easily out of breath; hard to exercise; aerobic exercise seems pointless to even try; diarrhea sometimes,Miracle drug for performance anxiety. Slows the heartbeat down to normal when you're in a normally fearful situation like public speaking. Even if you try to make yourself scared you can't. For tremor (essential tremor in my case) it works fairly well but is not 100% effective (maybe 50%). That's assuming I'm relaxed. For essential tremor due to great stress or pressure it is more like 90% effective as it really curbs the major shakes. The side effects are not horrible but are the reason I won't take it daily.,M,45,17  years80 1X AN,5/19/2014Email,Corgard
5, 1, Hyperthyroidism_ Migraine,Breathlessness_ hair loss_ extreme fatigue,I didnt like this drug at all. It slowed down my heart rate but caused extreme fatigue which badly affected my daily life. Pale_ puffy face_ huge shadows under eyes..sort of drug user apperance.After 2-4 hr after taking it I had a feeling that I cant breathe...sort of too tight clothes feeling. And hair loss - mostly top of scalp. Then hair started regrow sort of curly with reddish tinge. Migraines? They got worse_ lasting up 72hr. Disaster not drug.,F,36,30  days80 MG 1X D,4/5/2014Email,Corgard
6, 5, Migraines,Low heart rate_ cold all the time_  fatigue,This med gave me my life back.  It decreased my migraines from several per week to only 1-2 per month.  After about 7-8 years it became less effective and I had to add many more meds and surgeries to try and keep a life worth living.,F,45,15  years40mg 1X D,3/25/2014,Corgard
7, 5, vascular mediated syncipy,None_ except after a year I have had some urinary retention problems... maybe unrelated.,I have a low heart rate and experience fainting symptoms during my sleep. that condition was occurring every night I had just finished a significant mentally testing effort... such as finishing a big project at work... post stress anxiety... was on metropolol before_ but my specialist changed me to nadolol and have not had an event since!!! it worked well for me.take at night before going to bed...,M,58,2  years40 1X D,3/9/2014Email,Corgard
8, 1, Long QT Syndrome_ A-fib,Dizziness_ cold hands & feet_ hair thinning/loss,My heart went into atrial fibrillation in my 7th month of my pregnancy and it was then discovered that I have long QT syndrome. Thankfully_ my son was born healthy! I was put on Nadolol a few months after he was born.  Now_ almost 3 years later_ I know why my hair is horribly thin_ my hands and feet are constantly cold and why I have dizzy spells. The Nadolol has caused me all these problems. I was never told any of the possible side effects with this medication by my cardiologist or my pharmacist. Unacceptable! I am going to wean myself off and rely on a change in diet for my heart issues.  I went to see a dermatologist recently to voice my concerns over my hair thinning/loss and she said that since I didn't notice a 'change' with my hair within 4 months of using the medication_ that it couldn't possibly be the Nadolol! Baloney!,F,29,3  years20 mg 1X D,1/29/2014,Corgard
9, 2, Sinus Tachycardia_ migraine seizure,Heart rate has not decreased.  Migraines absent for a few hours only.  Sleep walking.  Increased fatigue.  Nausea_ increased loss of appetite.,So far_ I am not impressed with this medicine.  Everyone keeps telling me to give it time_ but I will be speaking with my neurologist.  A heart rate of 130+ is just not acceptable to me.,F,36,4  days40 mg 1X D,4/24/2013Email,Corgard
10, 1, Rate control - A-fib,Terrible panic attacks would come over me without warning.  I thought I was cracking up and never suspected the nadolol since I figured all beta-blockers were the same.  The panic attacks worsened to the point that I was winding up in the emergency room on a weekly basis with blood pressure as high as 190/110.  I finally decided that perhaps the nadolol was the culprit.  I asked my doc to switch beta-blockers and he put me on betaxolol.  Within 2 weeks_ the panic attacks all but disappeared.  I've been on betaxolol for nearly 3 years now_ and I am so much happier now than when I was on the nadolol.  I'd never say that nadolol is bad for everyone_ nor would I say that betaxolol is good for everyone.  But_ I will say with absolute certainty that not all beta-blockers are the same!  If you're having trouble with one_ insist that your doctor try another.,,M,48,1.5  years20 2X D,8/21/2012Email,Corgard
11, 5, blood pressure,None,My overall health has been positively advanced by Corgard. I weigh the same as I did when I graduated from high school and the medication has not made me gain any additional weight.,F,76,11  years40mg 1X D,7/29/2011,Corgard
12, 5, migraines,Little to none. I was a bit tired the first few days.,This medication brought me from three severe migraines a week to maybe one a month_ life changing.,F,26,6  months80 mg 1X D,9/9/2010,Corgard
13, 5, Stage fright_ social phobia,Weight gain_ fatigue_ maybe depression.,Works like a charm for stage fright and social phobia but at a high price_ I've had a steady substantial weight gain over the years and profound loss of energy. But I was desperate for help with social phobia and it was the only thing that helped. It also pretty much cured my migraines. At this point I'm considering tapering off to see what happens as I really need to lose weight because of high cholesterol. I never had a weight problem until I started this drug. In the first couple of months after taking I gained about 15 pounds and have continued to gain at a slower rate over the last 10 plus years.,F,54,10  years40mg 1X D,6/19/2010,Corgard

15, 1, Daily Migraine Sufferer,I have put on approximately 20 lbs since I started this med.  My once thick hair has become so thin I'm concerned it'll all come out before it starts to grow again!,My doctors didn't catch this problem!  I talked to my neurologist and he missed it.  I just finished a bunch of lab work at my family doctor.  I was hoping he'd find something...not cancer!  Thanks to this site_ I have been able to discover so much!  Thank you for this site.  I am going off my Corgard...Forever!!!,F,49,7  months20 1X D,2/15/2010,Corgard
16, 1, Blood Pressure control/migraines,Am 51 yrs old_ have been on this for 3 weeks_ have had nausea that won't seem to go away_ general loss of interest in things I like to do_ and 3 severe migraines since start date.  Shortness of breath and BP isn't going down and staying there.,I would NOT recommend this to anyone_ I tried it because of its possible dual purpose.  Horse hockey_ It works for very few people and if you are prone to migraines_ don't take it. It does help with sleep related troubles but the zombie feeling the next day is not worth this_ NOR is the migraines that caused me to miss work.,F,51,3  weeks20mg 1X D,2/4/2010,Corgard
17, 2, Migraines/MAV/High Blood Pressure,Worsening headaches; extreme lethargy and lack of energy/interest in doing anything; nausea,"A bit of background on my situation: I've had high BP and migraines for years. It was previously under control with 50 mg of Atenolol per day (worked for about a year). One day_ I had sudden dizzines and worsening migraines; numerous tests have concluded it's MAV (migraine associated vertigo)_ and I have been working from home (unable to drive due to dizziness) for the past 6 months. This is one of about 6 beta blockers/calcium channel blockers I've tried in the past few months. The one positive thing I can say is that it made me sleep VERY soundly...it damn near knocked me out at any dosage I tried (I'm only 5'5"" and weigh 115 pounds).  In addition to making me feel like a zombie_ it actually seemed to make my headaches/migraines worse in intensity and frequency...not a good combination for me!  It also made me nauseous...not fun when I deal with nausea from migraines anyway.  I'm back to Atenolol until I find something that works better_ I guess.",F,25,30  days,1/2/2010Email,Corgard
18, 5, palpitations,slow heart rate but no ill effects of that,I have been on this drug for 25 years and love it. I take a very low dose (10-20 mg daily). It does not make my palpitations go away completely_ but it helps a LOT. Without it_ my heart races all the time and I feel unsteady. This medication makes me feel normal.,F,43,25  years,12/27/2009,Corgard

24, 5, stage fright,none,"Using nadolol for stage fright is an ""off-book"" usage_ but is a dirty secret of professional classical music performance. Nadolol_ dosed properly_ seems to totally wipe out flight-fight response without affecting fine motor control_ which makes it a great drug for anxious performers and speakers_ especially as part of behavioral retraining. After years of severe stage fright issues_ I started using it_ first all the time_ but now hardly at all_ because it allowed me to have positive experiences on stage_ which reduces the anxiety_ and thus the need for the drug the next time. This was a fantastic drug for me.",M,37,75  times,4/18/2008,Corgard
25, 5, Atrial Fibrilation,I'm taking Nadolol (Corgard) for 10 years. It was very hard to adjust to it from beginning. I had a very unpleasant feeling that my heart is slowing down but after couple of weeks it went away and I am using it until today. There are no any side effects. My heart rate is good_ ECG_ ECHO and all tests are very good.,It's worth to give it a try and start with just a 1/2 of dosage your doctor prescribed. In a week (if everything is OK) increase dosage to normal.,F,58,10  years,3/26/2008,Corgard
26, 5, A Fib,I was on Corgard for about 8 years and really liked it.  Kept my heart beat regular.  No side effects.  Then my cardiologist changed me to Coreg and I hate it.  I've gained 17 pounds in 4 months with no change in diet or exercise.  I will ask my doctor to put me back on Corgard.,My 60 year old sister has been on Corgard for about 15 years and her doctor says that although it is a old medicine_ it is still a good and effective one.  She has no complaints.,F,63,8  years,3/3/2008,Corgard

A cardiologist who was doing a stress test on me told me NOT to take Corgard.  When I stopped and changed to Toprol_ the symptoms subsided completely.  I regained my strength and appetite.  I told my patient about my experience_ and she stopped the drug with her physician's consent_ gained 22 pounds (she had gotten very thin and frail) and felt so much better.,F,63,12  months,12/14/2007Email,Corgard
