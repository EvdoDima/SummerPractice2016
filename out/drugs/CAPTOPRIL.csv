1, 1, High blood pressure_ kidneys,Had a severe allergic reaction_ itching rash that moved from my chest to my entire front side of my body. This went on for two weeks and the Dr's. said it will go away. Do you think they could stand two weeks of this? The itching was like being bitten my misquotes from my neck to my feet. A back ache that felt like I had been beaten by a mugger_ that started at my mid back and radiated to the left and cramped my muscle up so bad that it hurt to just breath. Sweating_ wheezing_ coughing_ wee.,This drug was to promote longer life to kidneys for diabetics.The side effects are not worth the longevity of kidneys that you don't know if they will even fail. Nothing is worth this misery. DonÂ’t take this drug it is pure poison.,F,47,15  days,2/19/2007,Captopril
2, 1, high blood pressure,UPSET stomache even tho I took it as directed,,F,71,90  days,9/4/2006,Captopril
