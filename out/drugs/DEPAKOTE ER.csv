4, 5, Bipolar Disorder 1,It took care of my mania but I_ too_ was a little slowed downed & unmotivated.  But over time my body got used to it & I was able to function better.  Did cause some weight gain.  (I'm also taking 2 other drugs that cause weight gain_ so I got a triple whammy!). I found out that working out has_ at least_ kept my weight the same.,Because of the potential side effects of the liver_ I make sure that I get periodical testing to monitor my liver function. I will continue taking this drug the rest of my life however_ because of my age_ in the future I will have the dosage re-evaluated so I'm not over medicated.,F,59,18  years1000 1X D,7/14/2015Email,Depakote er

6, 1, Bipolar,Loss of physical and emotional connection to anyone. Very foggy mind. Couldn't think through anything clearly. Difficulty expressing feelings.  Gained 30lbs in 2 and a half years. Slept 10-12 hours every night and had to take a nap during the day. Showered only once a week and had no desire to look pretty or be hygienic. It took my life away and since stopping it I've noticed a remarkable difference for the better.,I hated Depakote and will NEVER take it again. I'm now going to have liposuction to get rid of all the traces of having taken this miserable drug.,F,38,3  years500,3/24/2015,Depakote er
7, 5, Bipolar 1 with psychosis,Can of course put a bit of weight on_ but I think that this side effect is grossly exaggerated. Drowsiness_ so take before bed.,It's the best mood-stabilizer that there is_ in my estimation. I've taken it for 12 years now without incident.,F,51,10  years1_500,3/16/2015,Depakote er
8, 5, Manic/Intermittent Explosive Disord,Insomnia/Constant Headache,Only problems so far are I don't sleep (great for anger control lol)_ and seem to constantly have a low grade headache.  I really think that the headache is from the lack of sleep.  If I can find something that will help me sleep without knocking me completely out... I think I'll be great. The Depakote ER has GREATLY improved my anger outbursts and frustration.  I had previously begun a low carb diet so I feel this will help with any weight gain issues that may arise.,M,39,2  weeks1000,2/23/2015,Depakote er
9, 5, Epilepsy,Mild weight gain. Occasional headaches.,This drug has been very helpful for me. As a man with epilepsy who has suffered from a few partial-complex seizures_ this drug has allowed me to be seizure free for 3+ years. The downside is no alcohol consumption_ but other than that I definitely recommend it for someone who suffers from epilepsy.,M,21,5  years1500 MG 1X D,1/9/2015Email,Depakote er
10, 5, Bi-Polar / Sleep Disorder,Slight weight gain / dry mouth,Depakote has been a great drug to keep me stable and prevent the ups and downs of Bi-Polar. I also take Seroquel with the Depakote at bedtime because I have a sleep disorder as well and this has worked great for the last 8 years. I take 2 - 500mg at night with 400mg Seroquel. Depakote does have a few side effects such as weight gain but for me the benefits are worth it.,M,48,8  years1000mg 1X D,12/22/2014Email,Depakote er

13, 1, Bipolar 1,As soon as I took this_ I felt searing pain in my liver area.  Basically_ the right side of my belly_ underneath my ribcage and all the way around to the back.  I know this medication can cause liver failure_ so I quit it immediately.  I felt the GABA in my brain increase_ and I'll admit_ if I didn't have liver issues_ I would love to take Depakote.  Talk about calm.  Dang.,I already had fatty liver when I took the Depakote.  The extra GABA in my brain felt amazing.  It's what I know I'm missing out on_ but unfortunately_ I'm not willing to risk death in order to feel better.  Nobody knows about this drug for bipolar_ but Keppra.  Look into it!  If you suffer from ultra-rapid cycling on a daily basis like I do_ this drug could be your savior.  The side effects are practically nothing compared to Lithium and Depkoate.  People who are manic depressive probably already have issues with their bodies and organs.  I know I do_ from all the drinking and drugs done in the past.  I needed something that wouldn't drive my liver enzymes up and cause me chest pain_ like both Lithium and Depakote did.  In comes Keppra_ a novel anticonvulsant.  It can work for rapid cycling_ you guys.  Look into it.  Request it.  You can take it with a bad liver too.,M,28,1  days500 mg 1X D,9/7/2014Email,Depakote er
14, 3, Bipolar/ mixed episode,Started during a mixed episode. Every attempt to bump up to 750 mg resulted in bad side effects... Ringing in ear_ insomnia and when I slept it was more of a sleep paralysis with EXTREME nightmares. Headaches_ nausea and depression. Am currently on 500 mg and feel ok,,F,38,2  months500 mg,8/14/2014,Depakote er
15, 3, Bipolar,I like it because it gives me time to filter and process my thoughts. It makes me really freaking tired though. I got put on bupropion and it has helped a lot but I'm still so damn tired.,,F,23,6  months500mg,5/25/2014,Depakote er

Almost all of these side effects have went away over time it was mostly just the first year. I'm still tired alot and will randomly have huge bruises appear on my legs_ and I feel like I forget alot of things but that could just be a coincidence.  It's the only thing that stopped my seizures so the side effects are not a big deal considering the alternative.,,F,29,10  years500mg,6/19/2013Email,Depakote er
18, 2, Bipolar 1,Memory loss_ insomnia depression/lack of motivation causing life events_ anxiety,"Pretty much was ok with a DepakoteER/Lamictal combo for Tx but I have come very concerned about memory retention through the last several years_ general sadness and depression.  If I miss a couple doses_ severe agitation kicks in.Marked negativity the last several months.  Doc seemed ok with ""flat"" mood most of the time during followups. Last appt. he recommended therapy for the depression but increased Lamictal. I just lost my 2nd job of 6 years_ this last one due to oversleeping 2X (company policy -- termination). Brain fog with the job and performance_ but have been concerned for a long time.  I really don't want to increase Depakote_ caused brain fog before_ or add a drug_ have had it with this. I feel like I have lost a decade off my life_ cannot even remember events where kids were growing up due to memory. Sometimes wife says ""don't you remember that"" I don't _ it just makes me feel awful. Never had issues with the hair loss_ just a little weight gain. God bless to everyone with mental health issues_ there will be a special place in heaven for all of us_ I am positive of that.",M,52,15  years1500 1X D,2/25/2013Email,Depakote er
19, 4, Bipolar II + Borderline,Weight gain_ about 10 pounds but that may be my own fault. Tiredness the first few weeks.,Mood seems much more stable_ I was manic when it was prescribed. Titrated from 500mg to 1500mg over 3 days. I was initially reluctant to take any meds_ but I feel much calmer and yet energetic at the same time_ rather than agitated as usual in a hypomanic mood.,F,39,30  days1500mg 1X D,2/5/2013Email,Depakote er
20, 4, Bipolar,initially spaciness and sleepiness as well as difficulty concentrating.  Weight gain and extreme hunger as well as some hair loss-this can be controlled with a multivitamin!  The weight gain and hunger are slowing down and after a couple of weeks_ the thinking improved greatly.  Still get weird dreams_ but I  have had much worse side effects than this from other meds_ so I handle it well.,This is a good drug; anyone who says take lithium or another drug before this doesn't know what they are talking about_  everyone is different! Don't make general accusations about medicines and scare people away from something that may help them. Research is showing that people with different genes respond differently to bipolar medications_ in fact lithium made me much worse_ and there is new research that supports that apoptosis may increase in people who don't do well on lithium.  My mood is much more stable_ irritability_ jealousy and anger are all but gone_ and I exercise to keep the depression at bay.  This is my second time on the drug_ it worked wonders the first time too_ but my liver enzymes shot up_ not happening this time though_ and God willing_ it won't.  Do I like taking medicine? No. Do I have a choice. No. So I will go with the one that works best_ and no drug is perfect.  Realize that now and you will be better off.  As long as they are tolerable.Thank you God for letting me be successful on this!,M,,3  months1500 mg 1X D,11/26/2012,Depakote er

23, 1, Bi-Polar,weight gain_ tremors in hands_ menstrual irregularities_ short term memory loss_ tingling in arms_ swelling of lower legs and ankles_ heat sensitivity.,I was tapered of Depakote and have been off this medication for 3 weeks.

24, 5, BiPolar I,The first month I was doing 500mg/day and felt no side effects. I researched the heck out them_ so I knew that weight gain was very possible. I immediately quit soda! lol I love soda. I did not lose nor gain the first month_ so I think that I counteracted the weight gain. The last 2 weeks_ I have been increased to 750mg per day at bedtime_ and I have experienced some quickness of the digestive system. No problem_ though. Makes me feel detoxified! I do not feel sleepy_ rather more energetic. Sometimes mildly manic. For the increase these last 2 weeks_ I have started running again (well_ it is 1/2 run and 1/2 walk right now). Still_ no weight gain_ but I am ready with more ammunition if I see any creepers.,I was on Lithium 750mg for over 2 years_ from when I was first diagnosed_ but my blood tests showed that my thyroid went haywire (hypo) and my kidney(s?) started struggling_ so we switched me to Depakote. I was nervous because I FEAR change_ but I honestly feel better! I feel like there was a fog (maybe from the Lithium) has cleared and I am happier. I went through a few different antidepressants the last 2 years because I think the Lithium had me a little smothered. When I first switched_ I went through a couple of weeks where I was EXTREMELY agitated and irritable...over-sensitive and over-reacting. I think that was the withdrawal from the Lithium. I feel better now_ although I will admit to some excited anxiety...another scary way to say mania. My biggest fear of all of the side effects was weight gain_ but I hope to be able to control it. Most of the other side effects were the same as Lithium_ so I have already been dealing with swollen hands and feet_ hair loss_ and tremors for over 2 years. My hair fell OUT with Lithium. I lost half my density...but I got a shorter style and did a Keratin strength treatment and my hair has not felt better in 10 years. The Depakote is better than Lithium for me_ so far. Should have tried it sooner_ but the weight gain scared me away.,F,36,1.5  months750mg 1X D,5/26/2012Email,Depakote er

27, 3, Epilepsy,Stomach Pain_ Nausea_ GERD_ Foggy Brain_ Memory Problems_ Verbal Problems_ Slowed Speech_ Extreme Fatigue_ Tremors_ Bone Loss_ Mild Hair Loss_ Loss of Sex Drive and life in general.,"Prior to taking Depakote I did not have any of the symptoms stated in side-effects.  I was a very active_ hard working young career woman.  I was diagnosed w/epilepsy after having a grand mal seizure at 32 yrs old.  After bad experiences w/tegretol and mysoline it was determined Depakote was the best drug for me.  After all these years I am still having these ""side effects"" which some have turned into real health problems.  Such as:  I have severe osteoporosis - broke 3 ribs and my foot getting out of bed 2 yrs ago.  I struggle with major stomach pain_ nausea and GERD on a daily basis.  I literally shake now.  And last but not least I feel like I have early onset Alzheimers because of the brain fog and memory problems.  Seems like I can't put 2 words together.  I have an appointment w/ my neurologist next week to discuss going off the medication.  I have not had a seizure since 1988 and most of my EEGs have been good.  Don't get me wrong_ I think Depakote does a great job_ but for me the side effects just don't seem worth it.  I can't work.  I want more out of life.",F,56,22  years500 MG 2X D,3/14/2012Email,Depakote er

29, 5, Bipolar Disorder,Very mild sexual dysfunction (slightly delayed orgasm)_ mild nausea if taken with no food_ otherwise no nausea.,So far my side effects have been far fewer with Depakote than with many of the other mood-stabilizing drugs I have been tried on.  Some sedated me_ others put 40 pounds on me_ one gave me tremors.  I've experienced none of that with Depakote.  Not every drug is for every person_ but this one has worked very well for me.,M,30,6  weeks500 2X D,10/28/2011,Depakote er
30, 2, Seizure control,My daughter began taking Depakote for years_ ages 3-7 on a high dosages due to seizures. It controlled seizures.  Her mood swings where terrible_ anger_ could not learn in school. Kicking biting_ hitting and self injurious behavior. Again it controlled her seizures but the behaviors are not acceptable. We are now on Lamictal doing better for about 2 years now.,Never give up on your kids.

32, 3, Severe Migraines/Clusters,I started at 250mg Depakote ER 1x/night.  After a week I took myself off of it due sleeping 10-13 hrs. a night and still feeling extremely tired/drowsy during the day.  Due to the severity of the daily pain and migraines I was having and at the recommendation of my Dr. I went back on it w/in 2 weeks. I increased the dose from 250mg to 500mg after a week. I figured that since I was incapacitated by pain every day maybe the Depakote would help_ and that even if I was sleeping all day/night_ at least I wouldn't be in pain.  Besides extremely vivid dreams_ the extreme tiredness is the only side effect that I've experienced.,I've been on Depekote for 4 weeks now and went from having daily migraines/moderate to extreme pain every day to having none/dull headache after 10 days on the med. Been mostly pain free since.  HOWEVER_ the side effect of sleeping 10-13 hrs every day and still feeling like I could sleep all day is making me consider whether or not to continuing taking this med.  Dr. said these side effects would mitigate but they have not.  My main goal is to get back to work_ but cannot do so if in pain everyday or unable to function due to extreme drowsiness - catch 22.Background:  I've suffered from migraines for 10 years with increasing frequency/pain within the past five years averaging 8-15 a month.  This fall and last fall have been especially bad.  Over the years_ I had tried every preventative and they have either not been effective or the side effects were too extreme. This fall I suffered from especially severe migraines/possible clusters that led me to the brink.

Severe saliva which is completely embarrassing if you're talking to someone. I was told to give everything at least 4 weeks but from these comments it doesnt sound like it will get better.

So his father stayed up all night and took care of him while I slept. She lowered the dose at bedtime to 500 mg. I really like that they help threwout the whole day. Certain times of the early afternoon or night I get worked up. I dont like that it causes weight gain though. I will see if there is another medicine that I can take for mania that doesnt do that. I also take Buspar 20 mg twice daily and 300 mg of Wellbutrin Xl. The combination is helping so far.,My mother took Depakote and Serequol and Lithium for Bipolar Disorder.

43, 1, Bipolar/Severe Anxiety Disorder,"Going against my better judgement_ I agreed to start Depakote from my new psych. even after I had heard countless of horror stories_ thinking maybe it would be my ""miracle"" drug....and I was dead wrong. I was started on a medium doseage of 1500mg and within a week I couldn't leave my house. I was so detached from the world. I had no emotion_ no connection to reality. And even worse_ it didn't treat my anxiety. So I was trying to function in a zombie-like-state with a constant high-anxiety. I didn't even want to talk. And I'm one of those annoying girls who can't keep her mouth shut. My friends were literally scared of me. I called my Dr. crying at the end of the week before I was supposed to get my blood levels drawn_ crying_ the only emotion I had_ telling them that they either medically had to take me off of it or I was just going to flush the pills dow the toilet myself.

I was stable until 12 weeks ago when I decided to quit smoking. since then I have had uncontrolable rage and my mood swings are changing within hours.

Am now really focusing on diet and exercise_ but have never had a seizure while on Depakote - can't say that for any other of the meds I've tried other than Keppra which is also a good one for me.

I care nothing about the feelings of others_ I indirectly hurt others if I think it will benefit me_ I don't care what people say about me_ I tell people whatever I want (bad in customer service)_ and I cut out many people in my life because I stopped caring about them.

He finally was taken off it and his regular personality is starting to emerge_ but I think some damage was done to his memory. It's hard to prove at his age_ but I think we all should be suspicious of medications given to older people_ especially when there are not enough studies to justify using them.

Not only did it cause concentration problems_it also dropped his IQ by 17 points. This is a ""new"" side effect that is just being discovered. Most doctors don't know anything about it. The main study groups were in Europe_ with only one here in the US. If you are having this symptom_ please notify your doctor and get off the medication.

I was comorbid with epilepsy and bipolar 2 and able to have monotherapy for both disorders with this drug. It's not perfect_ but it has helped me to live a normal life.

I believe major metabolic changes have occurred due to my old methods of weight loss no longer applying.  Based on personal experience it's the type of weight gain that sticks and is extremely stubborn.  Went from a solid 6'1"" 215 to 265 since late September 2006.  I stopped the medication in December 2006 after the realization that my physical health was in rapid decline.  A sound physical body takes years to achieve.

121, 1, Bipolar type II,EXTREME lethargy; excessive sleep; terrible nightmares,1000mg/daily.My doctor prescribed this as a supplement to Lamictal to prevent mood changes.  Fairly soon after taking this medicine I was nearly unable to function.  At first I was instructed to take this at night before bed.  When I would wake up in the morning it was absolute hell; I could not pull myself out of bed.  I was completely exhausted_ no matter if I got 8 hours of good sleep.  If I were to take a nap and set an alarm_ there was no way I could wake up.  Waking up from sleep on depakote was like trying to get out of bed with a 6 ton weight on top of me.  To make matters worse_ I experienced very frightening and realistic nightmares several times a week - the worst dreams of my life.  My dr suggested taking it in the morning yet that did not help - I only suffered lethargy throughout the day and was not capable of functioning.,M,19,1  months,2/8/2007,Depakote er

Also take Wellbutrin EX for depression half of bipolar. Haven't ruled out lowering dose or switching to different med_ as I am newly diagnosed. If I can't get weight off with diet/exercise and hair back with vitamins_ I'm not sure I will stay on it.,"Regarding recent comment on this site that ""women should not take Depakote""_ it could be said if you were a woman of childbearing years and had NOT had children yet or were hoping to have them soon (next 1 - 2 years). You SHOULD NOT GET PREGNANT on Depakote ER_ the inserts with the med states that it is KNOWN (not possibly_ in mice) but KNOWN to cause birth defects. While I am of childbearing age_ I have 2 children and have no plans to get pregnant. My Drs. explained to me the protocol for an ""unplanned"" pregnancy wouldn't be pretty: immediate removal of Depakote_ probably within the safety of a hospital and a switch to a different med or no meds at all - but would be humanly possible with a probability of no ill effects on the child. OBVIOUSLY_ I don't plan on taking the risk but accidents do happen.

Occasional mild depersonalization (a feeling that you're watching the world through a camera_ though you still think and act and speak normally)_ and occasionally_ while talking with someone_ I'll kind of feel my eyes glaze over (always wonder if it's noticeable to the other person).,I was having partial simple seizures (spacey_ light-headed feelings that last a minute or so) and then had a grand mal and was put on Trileptal.  As the neurologist ramped up my dosage_  I started getting partial simple seizures again_ commensurate with the increasing dosage.  I switched neurologists and my new one put me on Depakote and the partial simple seizures immediately stopped.  She ramped me up to 1500 mg a day and got me off the Trileptal.  After a couple years I ramped myself down to 750 mg a day of Depakote and remain seizure-free with less depersonalization and that glazed-over feeling--I'm quite pleased with Depakote.,M,47,3  years,12/10/2006,Depakote er
