0, 2, Opiate addiction,Always tired_ no energy_ weight gain_ back pain,Dont get me wrong I am very greatful for the program I'm in. My doctor is absolutely wonderful! Its way better than the alternative. I have much better relationships with the people in my life. When I first started in the program I was on 16mg of SUBUTEX for about 9 months. My energy was the best it has ever been. I was sleeping through the night and up ready to go the next morning and my weight was maintained . Then I had to switch to suboxone and my energy was completely depleted and I starters gaining weight even though nothing in my diet or routine had changed. Contrary to popular belief I didn't feel better on subutex BC I was misusing it like some people do. It went under my tongue just like the suboxone. I don't know why its such a big difference but it is! I just feel it should be my choice what I'm taking. I know how I feel and what is helping me.,F,26,2  years16mg,7/5/2016Email,Suboxone

3, 1, Chronic pain,Mouth sores and nausea_ vomiting. Can't be due to terrible taste which makes me vomit I feel nauseous_  hallucinations which is something I have never had_ extreme dizziness_ confusion_ insomnia_ rash that goes off and on  and basically feel like I zombie_ can't even put a sentence together due to brain fog_ extreme itchiness_ headaches daily_ extreme anxiety and agitation,Was on  Dilaudid TID for seven years after a near fatal accident which has cost me several physical problems and pain  for seven years after a near fatal accident which has cost me several physical problems. I was not given this to detox  but for chronic pain. I have tried everything I have a sensitivity to many drugs. I also have fibromyalgia which was a direct result from the accident.  I don't understand why my doctor would switch me to Suboxone when  Dilaudid  was providing adequate pain relief. I have never asked for an increase and Jose or ask for an increase and how often I take it  at this point the side effects outweigh the benefits_ and would rather deal with the pain then the side effects. I'm scared about the hallucinations and that alone makes me  not want to take it. I have concerns regarding acute injuries or surgeries that are not booked in advance  and terrified that if something serious happens_ I won't have pain relief. I also understand that this is incredibly difficult to withdraw from.  Dr.  Tapered the  Dilaudid  over a two day. And I was extremely sick_ don't want to go through that again and since I've only taken it for 10 days_ I am hoping I won't have withdrawal symptoms.  I want to go back to what I was taking because I believe if something isn't broken_ don't change it and feel that my doctor gave me this Suboxone even though  she knows I take it for pain and due to the Mount of years I have been on it_ I certainly don't get high and so I don't u,F,53,10  days8mg,4/14/2016Email,Suboxone

5, 5, Opiate Addiction,I've been on suboxone for just about five months now. When i first started taking suboxone I had so much energy. I couldnt sleep because I had so much energy_ I just wanted to clean or work out. I also noticed I wasn't hungry anymore. Within the first two weeks of starting suboxone I lost 20 Pounds. Within another month and a half I lost another 20 pounds. I'm not complaining about the weight loss but it worries me because I'm not trying to lose weight anymore and the weight is still falling off me. Another thing I've noticed_ when I sleep I have very bad aches in my bones so im constantly tossing and turning. Its really annoying.,,F,24,5  months8mg 1X D,3/22/2016,Suboxone

8, 1, Coming off vicodin,At first severe night sweats and insomnia (lasted for weeks_ nothing to do with the original addiction).  Later_ after about a year_ extreme drop in testosterone_ extreme fatigue and narcolepsy (I would just fall asleep at work_ and every day take a nap in my car).  Also_ even taking the medicine twice a day_ I would wake up with extreme anxiety.  Towards the end_ I would only feel like moving or thinking within two to three hours of taking a dose.,I am beginning to see more reports like mine.  My doctor told me none of my symptoms were related to Suboxone_ that it was all from the original addiction or depression.  I was on this med three times as long as I was addicted to vicodin.  I have been taking SSRI's for 20 years for depression and the stories coming out about suboxone remind me of trying to explain SSRI withdrawal to my psychiatrist.  He absolutely denied it could be possible.  It wasn't until forums like these began to appear that doctors were forced to acknowledge 'SSRI discontinuation sydrome'.  They even had to make up a nice_ medical sounding name for simple withdrawl.  I am amazed that these intelligent but apparently naive or corrupt physicians would rather believe pharmaceutical sales reps whose only concern is profit than patients who just want to feel better.,M,43,2  years12mg,2/24/2016,Suboxone

MAYBE THAT'S WHY THE CALL IT SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE_ THEY WANT YOU TO SUBSTITUTE AND BECOME A LIFELONG ADDICT. MY PLAN WAS TO TAKE IT UNTIL I WAS READY TO STOP AND HAD MY LIFE IN ORDER ECT.

11, 2, I had a Big ass monkey on by back.,Was great in the first year. Then I thought I was normal for the last 6.5 years. Now reality is giving me a bitch-slap worst feeling ever. OMG,"Like I said Donkey Kong had a permanent residence on my back from age 20-25. If I could go back and throw one of those damned barrels at the 20yr old me the day I took that first Watson 540. Who knows where I'd be. But unfortunately I can not. Please take it from me. I've read lots of these forums over the years. Some of them will scare you too death from the withdrawal of quitting suboxone. Then every ass hole_ that only had a short binge run with what ever drug they took_ to get them on suboxone. Will say it's easy if you just... and only... you just gotta want too get clean... I call them the live at home free loaders who just need attention_ so they claim to be opiate dependant.Then have the nerve to say how easy it was.    I am know doctor_ I am just your average middle class American_ with a wife_ 14yr daughter_ 10yr son. Full time job. And bills that come to my mailbox every day I wish I had the luxury of saying TIME OUT!!! ""I'M READY TO CLEAN UP NOW"". Thence a week later hit that little red button at staples. ""THAT WAS EASY"".    To those of you who have done it (for real). I know you won't take offense_ cause you KNOW.  Now that I got that out of my system. Hope this can help someone fresh in the suboxne game. Wish I had read or heard Of course  when I got started  in the program I was a full fledged addict.

12, 3, addicted to vicodin,EXTREME TIREDNESS.  Tired like I never felt before.  I used to leap out of bed after 7 or 8 hours of sleep.  Now I sleep at least 12 hours a day_ sometimes more.  And I agree with what other reviewers had to say.  You don't feel much of anything.  I felt very disconnected to my husband.  No sex drive.  The disconnection carried through to my spiritual self as well.  Felt less connected with God.,I detoxed off the vicodin by myself.  It took about 6 days.  I felt 100% like myself for the first time in years.  I went to the doctor and he put me on Suboxone.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to go on it because of side effects and being addicted to something else.  The only good thing about Suboxone is I am sure it kept me from starting up with vicodin again but I don't think it solved my problems.  Me and my doc believe there was an underlying cause to my addiction.  I have a personality disorder or ADHD perhaps.  I needed the vicodin as a mood elevator to help me concentrate when I was busy.  And I am on medication for depression but I don't think it's enough.  I believe I need a different type of medication to keep me motivated_ focused_ and happy.  Since it can't be vicodin I hope there is something else that does that.  I want to wean off the Suboxone.  I don't like it.  I am tired of feeling the way I do.  I want to feel like myself again.,F,36,1  years8 mg 2X D,1/12/2016,Suboxone

I had no job_ no roof over my head_ no car or license_ non-custodial rights to my daughter.  My family wouldn't talk to me and my bank terminated my accounts.  I remember only having my purse_ my duffle bag of clothes and only a few dollars to my name and not knowing where I was going to sleep that night.  We won't go into my criminal background_ jail_ rehab or the degrading_ shameful things I wish I could forget.Since I've been on Suboxone_ my life has done a complete 180°!  I've gotten everything back.  I own my own car_ I have 50% custody of my daughter after fighting back (because I straitened out my life).  I've been pre-approved for a mortgage I'll share with my daughter_  fiancé and 11 month old bundle of joy.  I've cleared my criminal record and don't even have SR22 on my license anymore.  I work as a professional dental assistant and make acquaintances and even friends with some lawyers_ police officers_ entrepreneurs_ doctors_ politicians....All sorts of people I never thought I would cross paths with in my prior life.  People who know me now would be shocked to know of my past or even know that I am taking Suboxone.

29, 5, Opioid maintenance therapy,Nausea_ itching_ and headaches_ all of which completely subside after a few weeks for me.,This drug is a lifesaver for me. Without it_ I continue to relapse even with the help of addiction programs and treatment. I have gone cold-turkey off of Suboxone before and the withdrawal is better_ in my opinion_ than full-agonist drugs like oxycodone. People like to say it is much worse_ but my question to them is: how was tapering off of a full opioid like? Nobody tapers using oxycodone; it is too difficult. If that were otherwise_ then no one would use Suboxone. With this drug it is able to taper off - which I will do next February. The Suboxone program I am with is only for one year. This is ridiculous - research shows that lifetime maintenance is much more effective than going without any chemical assistance. Almost all opioid addicts will relapse upon discontinuation of beprenorphine or methadone. I plan on finding another doctor to prescribe Sub for me next winter.Don't listen to the people that say it is a horrible drug! If you have a daily opioid addiction_ Suboxone can give you your life back. Don't worry about tapering off. Yes_ it will be uncomfortable_ but if you are focused you can manage it. I've done it both ways - tapering and cold turkey. It can be done. Medical detox with clonidine will help tremendously when the time comes_ so seek out medical help. I have been on and off Suboxone for the better of 4 years_ and I plan to stay on it indefinitely.,M,32,4  years12 mg 1X D,2/12/2015Email,Suboxone

35, 4, opiate abuse_ fibromyalgia,I was put on suboxone after around 5 years of opiate abuse starting with Vicodin for pain and ending up at 400-600 mg of oxy or 4+ bundles of snorted heroin a day. I went to inpatient rehab and was started on suboxone. At first I just wanted to do a short taper_ but realized without something for my fibro pain I would end up right back where I started. I couldn't find a dr_ and I relapsed for 3 months. When I finally found a doctor_ I got on at 16 mg a day. I raised it to 20 because I still was having cravings. I still have cravings and probably always will_ but with help from bluelight.org and suboxone.com_ I was able to stay mostly clean and taper. I find it to help more at the lower doses. At 20 mg a day_ I either felt sedated or restless. I have had trouble maintaining any kind of sleep schedule_ even at 2 mg_ but it's a lot better. The drug does not cause constipation for me_ it actually makes me go shortly after I take it. I do think methadone would cover my cravings better_ but ins covers my suboxone_ and I don't have to start out chained to a clinic. The main side effect of suboxone is the drs who prescribe it. A lot of them are just in it for the money. If you have a light addiction_ do yourself a favor_ and just cold turkey it. If you must use suboxone_ use a low dose. There are many reports from people who were hooked on a few Norcos/day and now have a much bigger monkey on their back. Even though you don't feel high_ it is a potent narcotic.,,F,29,7  months20 mg -> 2,9/24/2014Email,Suboxone

38, 3, Pain_ Opiate Addiction,Lots of energy_ didn't sleep well and lost 75lbs. No sex drive at all.,This medication is far better than Methadone for addicts to stay clean off opiates and stay clean. No urges to do other drugs at all and you don't gain the weight that Methadone gives some people. It's been a difficult drug to take for me since I have anxiety issues and insomnia problems and this stuff keeps you awake if taken too late in the day. If you're going to take this stuff to get off opiates you only need a very small amount_ 2mg or so and I wouldn't take for more than 2-3 days unless you plan on being on it for awhile. This medication is extremely difficult to get off of and I should know since I've done it all. If you are willing to taper off very slowly than maybe this is for you. Otherwise I've almost tried to commit suicide a few times in my mind when getting off of this and never has that problem with other opiates. Something very mental about the withdrawals from it. Very hard and I am in search of help as I write this to get under 2mg is so hard. Go super slow once you get under 4mg to taper.,M,47,1.5  years8mg 3X D,8/10/2014,Suboxone
39, 1, roxy,At first sub was like a miracle. Made me feel normal again,When I was first tapered ..... Had a job and the withdrawal and lack of sleep made me seek another doctor. Did his program _ followed all his rules. I wanted rid of this problem. Then.... Out of the blue after two years of seeing him was told because laws were becoming stricter _ he could no longer see me. He gave me my last prescription and told me how to taper. Didn't work. I couldnt afford the other doctors in my area when the withdrawal got so bad I couldn't handle it. It wasn't a 3-5 day thing like foxy. I ended up where I started.... Buying off the street. A higher tolerance so roxy didn't help either. Then one day_ I said f*** it all. I had lost my job_ my boyfriend and was about to lose my home. I quit cold turkey. Now_ 3 months later _ I still don't feel normal. Normal _ comes and goes. I have good days and then.... Bam. It's like_ I have mild withdrawals_ upset stomach_ diarrhea_ stuffy nose_ can't sleep. Then it's gone as fast as it came my advise to anyone who wants or thinks suboxone is a good idea... Don't do it. I am 3 months clean and still have no energy. Withdrawal comes and goes. My moods are everywhere and I am just making myself stick it out hoping I didn't do permanent damage to myself. If I had KNOWN that the acute withdrawal would be almost a month and the lingering effects would still be happening_ I would have been sick my 3-5 instead. May have been rougher_ but when you can't sleep and feel normal as long as me_ it looks like a much better option.,F,29,3  years8 mg 2X D,8/10/2014Email,Suboxone
40, 1, mild withdraws,hiccups_ vomiting_ nausea_ cold sweats,this drug is ridiculous_ I am now certain it is a ploy by pharmaceutical companies to get people to purchase more of they're products. I have taken it once and now 17 hours I am still vomiting. I was a opiate addict for 1.5 years using somewhere around 120mg per day when I was done I sweated it out on the couch and was just fine. this time around I'm barely using and only for about three weeks. I took suboxone_ and my experience  is way worse than any opiate withdraws. If I were looking to get off opiates_ I would seriously consider all other options before taking this. at best this is a good diet pill as I have violently_ projectile vomited everything I have put in my body.,M,33,1  days7mg 1X D,8/9/2014Email,Suboxone

Those side effects ruin your lifestyle not just how you feel physically. Everyone is different. If you take any medication and it doesn't work for you then stop taking it. But don't have to tell other people that its a crummy drug because everyone is different. If you take a medication and you find it beneficial then keep taking it.

No side effects ever!  I have been so lucky.  Also I am in Australia and Suboxone is free here.  I pick up my doses every week and it costs me nothing.  I hate to think where I would be now without Suboxone in my life.  Also Sub. has a pain killing substance which helps with my chronic pain and that coupled with Topamax_ I have never felt better.

59, 3, 6 years of using opiates..,I have been taking opiates for 6 years after 3 surgeries. I was prescribed narcotics and then I eventually got hooked on them. I have been  to 3 diffrent rehabs but when I got out each time I would start back taking them again. So today 6/7/2012 I went to see a doctor to get me off of these pain pills. So he put me on Suboxone ( 8 milligrams/ 3 times a day) well I just took my 2nd dose of the buprenorphin pill and I have got severe sleepy and I am very nausiated . I got real  weak and jittery. I hope that someone reads my post that maybe of some help to me. I want to get off of the percocets for for good and I want my life back just be normal again. Will these side effects go away ? I am praying so !! I spent $ 230.00 for my doctors visit today plus my suboxone prescription was $ 180.00 to get it filled. It is worth the money to me if this Suboxone treatment helps me. I just want to be normal again and off of the pain pills. If anyone out there reads this please reply. This is the first time I have tried the Suboxone treatment so I'm praying this helps me. I have put it in my head over and over that I can and will overcome this addictition. If someone reads this  post please do reply. Any help_ comments_ etc; I would greatly appreciate it.

I am in HELL because I am an opiate/addict and the addiction switched from pain pills to Suboxone.  I eventually asked for help to get off the SuboxoneI ended up in the emergency room with pancreatitis.  My doctor asked me if I wanted to taper off Suboxone or get medication that helps with the withdrawals.  I chose not to taper (I didn't trust myself to taper as I loved this miracle drug). The withdrawals are severe little sleep chronic shaking lethargy depression_ weakness_ flu like symptoms_ since they wld not allow xanex or valium_ anxiety thru the roof!  I also don't want to interact with anyone .Trust the people writing the worst about this drug replacing opiates. I too excelled in life with this drug only to find out it gave me enough of a high that I never was my REAL self_ in my humble opinion it's a dependency trade off. I felt like I got back to my drug seeking behavior as could not be out of Suboxone. I believe you when you call Suboxone a miracle drug_ yes it's short term use_ great but the longer you are on it_ the less the magic.

At first hard to transition due to the opiates I had been taking for chronic pain (much more than prescribed) I have been extremely happy with this medicine and it helps my pain very well. I had arthroscopy on knee 2 mo ago and my doc gave me same drug I had abused. At first it seemed work good and then remembered all the negative side effects with opiates. Especially how I isolated and was extremely irritable with children. I stopped taking_ got rid of them and restarted suboxone_ without abusing_ thank god. It is awesome medication and I am lucky to still be taking it. So far doctor plans keep me on indefinitely. My worry would be detoxing from it....

I have chronic pain and depression_ and my psychiatrist (I'm in treatment for depression) said Suboxone would be a way to control the pain without the neurotransmitter side effects of the oxycodone (1-3 tabs per day) that I have been taking for a couple of years. My depression is better but not completely resolved_ and my psychiatrist thought my oxycodone use might be playing a role in that.  By comparison_ he said your brain cannot down-regulate your neurotransmitters in reaction to Suboxone treatment like it can with regular opiates.I don't know if there's any way to know whether you'll be in agony like me_ versus helped like other patients_ but this seems related to a horrible experience I had with Stadol spray once_ which is also apparently a long-term opiate.  I also have a bad ""dystonic"" reaction to Reglan and compazine (anti-nausea drugs).

I was even told to start taking it again after I had been going through it for 8 weeks - but there was no way I would go back to that drug. I am now hooked on Xanax which I had to take to get through the withdrawals of suboxone. I did not sleep for 2 months and the panic attacks were awful. This is not the ""miracle"" cure for opiate addiction - it seemed like it at first but this is a very powerful drug and doctors should educate their patients first before prescribing it.

76, 3, Heroin Withdrawal,Euphoric_ constipation_ when placing under tongue do not move_ talk_ drink fluids or anything for at least 20 minutes or you'll mess up the sublingual effects. Hard to withdrawal from Nothing opiate-like is easy to kick.,I have used this medication not only to help withdrawal discomfort from short acting opites like oxycontin_ heroin_ diuladid but also from methadone at a dose of lower than 30mg. You have to wait until your into your withdrawal before taking or you will get very sick. Just wait as long as you can then you'll feel much better. It's expensive if you have no insurance but I find it much superior to methadone for withdrawal due to being able to get a months prescription immediately and not like a methadone clinic which you have to go to it everyday for 2 months before you can even get a weeks worth of carry homes. Now I would also say unles you want to be on methadone or suboxone for a long time and go through very difficult withdrawals that those 2 opiate therapy drugs should just be used for less than a week to get off short acting opiates and they work great that way. If you choose to get stable than taper very slowly if on it for a month or more or your withdrawals will be quite intense and drawn out. I much prefer suboxone to methadone. You don't gain weight_ sweat like a pig and nod out. Of course everyones different but thats been my issues when starting out on methadone. If you are just wanting to get off short acting opiates it's a great drug if you_ once again_ only use for a week or even 2 days would be fine because of the long half-life.

78, 4, Opiate addiction,none at the right dose_ when I take too much it makes me sleepy_ constipated_ and kills my sex drive.,I think it is a great drug if you have an opiate problem and need to get off of them. It can give you your life back to a degree_ although as long as you're on it you're still on a very powerful narcotic. You have to be ready to get off the opiates for it to work. If you don't need maintenance you can detox fairly quickly with it and this is probably the best way to use it. However some people such as my self can only clean up their act to a certain extent_ for me a daily dose of sub gives me the ability to live a normal life again. I have detoxed off of subs a few times but ultimately relapsed and have just stayed on subs since then. Great drug if you're ready to get off opiates for good or stay on an opiate maintenance drug. The lower the dose the better_ since it is very powerful at even the 1mg range. 1mg would probably knock out a person who has no opiate tolerance. Bottom line is yes you don't need as much as your doctor may prescribe you most of the time_ but some people need a higher dose and need to stay on it for longer periods of time. I think it's the lesser of the two evils since it allows an opiate addicted person to balance out their life.,M,32,9  months8mgs 1X D,6/10/2011Email,Suboxone
79, 5, addicted to Norco,A little bit of sleepiness_nothing more.,This is my second day at posting a blog and tomorrow will be my fourth day taking Suboxone.Once again_ I've had no side effects other then a small amount of sleepiness. Maybe there will be more as I progress but I dont think so. I had been taking Trazadone prior to starting Sboxone for sleep issues so I believe thats playing a part.      I've been reading alot of comments regarding the effects & also how much time they've been on the medication.I'm really not understand it! I have insurance so I only paid $25 for the Dr. visit & my insurance covered over half the price of the medicine. Also_ I dont get WHY some people need to take or are advised to take this medicine as long as they've been told to take it for! My dr. told me that if all is well next Monday that hes going to start weaning me down. He said one should start weaning down as soon as the body can tolerate things & that the sooner one can get off the medicine the better.                             He stated that I should definitely be off in under a month. However_ my dr. isn't one of those fly by the mill docs who get a kick out of prescribing people who are completely clueless about the drug to taking it for unecessarily long periods of time. Thats just plain sad for these dr.s to profit off of people in life threatening situations.

80, 5, addicted to Norco,I'm on going on my 3rd day of detoxing with Suboxone and have had not ONE side effect.,"I had been addicted to Norco for about a year & a half. I was taking enough at one time to kill 3-4 people & really knew if I didn't put a stop to it I'd wind up dead eventually. So when my script was up I decided to & definitely with my husbands support to finally stop the cycle.I made some phone calls & was referred to a dr. at an Urgent Care facility nearby.$25 later I was put on an outpatient Suboxon regimen & on my way to recovery. As said_ Im going on day 3 tomorrow & just cant wait to see what the future holds. I dont really have the ""wanting"" or craving for the Norco either. My Suboxon was only $40 due to my insurance but I realize so many people out there that dont have that privelege & i wish them all the best of luck!",F,37,3  days16mg 1X D,4/4/2011Email,Suboxone
81, 4, Heroin/methadone addiction,MASSIVE constipation. Sleepy after taking it. Lack of sex drive. Lack of appetite. Lost 30lbs in 3 months.,"Tried detoxing off heroin using methadone. Was on MMT for 5 years_ the last 2 1/2 detoxing. Could not get past 32mg's w/out ending up in the E.R.. Decided to try Suboxone. Started at 16mg's/day and weened myself down to 1.5 mg's/day_ NOT following my drs' orders. I know enough that you should get off this as quick as possible_ unless you use it as treatment_ or you become very dependant_ and w/drawals will last longer than needed. People need to know that you need to get to a VERY LOW dose_ (less than 1mg/day)_ for w/drawals to be tolerable. Everyone trying to detox off this should learn about the ""liquid taper"" method. That's the only way to get your dose real low and accurate. I use an empty asprin bottle_ crush up an 8mg pill_ then add 8ml's of water to make a liquid_ then use a childs med dropper to suck up what I need. This way I know I'm getting .5 mg's everytime I dose. It's WAY better than methadone detox_ but if you can_ detox off your DOC instead of either of these two drugs. The half-life is a real bitch to get use to. Plus the cost is insane. $350.00 just to see the dr._ then almost $600.00/month for the script. Massive rip-off. So far_ on a scale of 1-10_ 10 being super sick_ detoxing off Subs is a 5 or 6.

83, 5, oxys,energy when taking the subox but not mucg energy when not taking sub,this drug was amazing BUT sorry but doc DONT use this drug the right way. I was taking 8 - 80 mg oxy's/day and decided to use suboxone. I did 8mg/2 days_ 6mg/3days_ 4mg/3days_ 2mg/week and no side effects or withdrawl. It only took three weeks. DO NOT USE THIS DRUG HOW YOUR DOCTOR WILL TELL YOU. DO NOT STAY ON IT FOR MONTHS AND OR YEARS. Methadone/suboxone clinics are horrible money making schemes. for every pill your doctor prescribes you they make a despensing fee off it_ therefor the doctors will tell you you need to be on it for months or years because everyday they get make the fee! they want to keep you on as long as they can thats why they recomend 1/2 year treatment plans_ and for methadone its even worse_ its totally unecessary and all about the money. The reason you dont stay on sub for more thAN A month is because your body will gain a tolerence_ and once your body has that tolerance you become addicted to it and when you decide to quit the subox you will withdrawl. If you are only on for a couple weeks or one month your body doesnt take that time to develope a dependance_ and along with the constant weening_ you dont experience anything. SO use subox as quickly as you can and dont listen to the methadone doctors or pharmacies because they want to make that $10 fee for everry pill you are perscribed. the methadone doctor here in T.O runs like 3 clinics here and three in peterborough and makes $25 000 a week of despensing fees......RIDICULOUS!!!

I was having difficulty coming off the diluadid when it was cut in half. My pharmacist Uncle suggested to give suboxone a try. I didn't have an addiction to the medicine but a tolerance and just needed help to slowly decrease the medicine.

I went on the suboxone for about 2 weeks but do not like it.  I'm severly tired_ constipated and feel that this medicine many not be for me.

Also had insomnia_ constipation_ weight gain_ sadness_ over-emotional_ food cravings_ felt like a wet blanket thrown over me_ foggy. But still a God-send.,Now down to 1 to 2 MGs twice a day. Tapering down slowly. Experiencing extreme lethargy_ tiredness_ yawning and sleeping a lot. Happy and excited when i take it_ sleepy and lifeless when i don't take it.

90, 5, roxy and oxy addiction,headches slight depression,i am very happy with my decision to go on suboxen. i am sure i do not have to share with you the exacts of how bad my life was before (broke homeless_ scared_ ALL FOR PILLS. WTF???) i have been expeirencing bad headaches but totally worth it. i am concerned after reading some comments about coming off of suboxen. but my doc has me on a 2 year de tox plan and he stressed to me the only way i will get better is if i go to NA meetings. i guess by making myself find time to go to these meeting( full time job and single mom to a 6 month old) three times a week it makes the part of my brain that was messed up from the opiate addiction start working again. Obviously i have not been on the suboxen long so only time will tell. But i think everyone should try to attend some NA meetings it was truly amazing how good feel after listening and talking to other addicts. Especially because i now know that i am not alone.

If I notice I have NOT gone in 2 days_ I will take 3 softeners and that always does it.  The Suboxone has such a long half life.  You just cannot feel sick on this medication even if you miss an entire day.  Once I had to take myself off of it for other reasons and I used Tramadol quite liberally after I felt my self coming off the Suboxone but I handled that fine_ the ultram worked.  Suboxone has HELPED ENTIRELY WITH DEPRESSION AND GAD (ANXIETY). It took my craving for oxy's away and for that I am soo grateful.  For those who don't like keeping the pill in their mouth for that long try different things! The best way for super fast absorption is by crushing the pill into a fine powder and sliding the powder under your tongue.  It melts in 2 minutes!  This med is one med I Do recommend!  Think of all the trouble you used to get into getting and doing drugs!  Just try the medication it might SAVE your life!

93, 5, opiate addict / depression + GAD,NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL.  I have only wonderful things to say about it_ it gave me my life back and made it even better than before my addiction.,For me this drug is a miracle and gave me a life better than anything I ever believed possible. For the people who complain about trading one addiction for another_ what exactly is the problem with that as long as the new addiction has almost no negative side effects and dramatically improves my life? My life was a living hell before suboxone.  I had been addicted to opiates for 15 years as I found they were the only thing that eliminated the severe depression/anxiety that was coupled with an extreme fatigue that devastated my life.  Addiction has its own and worse evils. Previously I made a attempt at sobriety that lasted 4.5 years during which I went to doctors for treatment + meds_ and made every lifestlye change possible and all were futile in improving my condition.  My depression and anxiety were just overwhelming_ and I always felt tired no matter how much rest or positive lifestyle changes I made. I eventually relapsed and ended up on Methdaone. I hated the clinic and the effect methadone had on me. I started researching alternatives and discovered suboxone. This drug is miraculous.  It gave me a life I never thought was possible.  My depression/GAD + fatigue are gone.  There is no high on these so there is limited abuse potential_ and I only take them as prescribed. For the first time in my life I am truly happy and moving forward. Please email me if you have any questions.,M,35,30  days,1/9/2010Email,Suboxone
94, 5, 6 Yrs of OxyContin Addiction,No side effects what so ever.  FYI: This site has this medication classification wrong.  It's not an opiate agonist_ it's a 'PARTIAL OPIATE AGONIST MIXED WITH AN OPIATE ANTAGONIST'.  I've researched it extensively and to call it an opiate agonist is similar to comaring it to methadone: false.Early on_ I had some strange muscle spasms just as I was about to fall asleep but have not had them for a very long time.,I began taking suboxone at the age of 25_ after 6 years of serious opioid dependency.  FOR ME_ SUBOXONE HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE MIRACLE DRUG.I went from being a very successful person_ to being a college dropout with $65_000 in student loans_ most of which went toward OxyContin.  In the end_ I was snorting between 2 and 8 OxyContin 80s a day.  Every part of my life was failing. i.e-no drivers license_ no insurance_ no girlfriend_ no job_ dropped out of school_ etc.3 years of suboxone treatment later_ my life has completely turned around!  I have a great job_ a great fiancé_ and a nice car. (drivers license_ insurance and all)I highly recommend finding a doctor that does not view suboxone as a short term solution_ but rather a long term slowly weaning treatment plan. (I was once on 4 8mg suboxones a day_ and have come down by 2mg every 3 months for 2 years now.  2 years from now Ill be off suboxone_ but will have taken it for 5 years total)Very good medicine that CAN work for you if youre addicted to opiates!,M,28,3  years,12/23/2009,Suboxone

97, 5, Prescription opiod dependence,I began taking Suboxone at the highest dose_ three 8mg tablets a day.  At that dose I had a fairly severe allergic reaction (rash_ itching_ sores in the mouth) probably because I'm allergic to codeine.  However_ the doctor lowered my dose to 8mg twice a day and the allergic reaction disappeared.  Now my only side effect is increased sweating.  And_ oh yeah_ a newfound ability to live a life free of sickness_ near death overdoses_ and criminal charges/arrests.  Suboxone is a miracle MEDICAL treatment for the MEDICAL disease of opiod dependence.,"Literally_ from the first few hours I started taking Suboxone I was freed from the vicious cycle of opiod addiction which has been destroying my life for the last ten years.  Now_ taking this drug_ I have no opiod cravings at all.  I never_ ever spend any more time thinking about and planning to get high.  This medicine doesn't make me feel ""high"" at all; in fact_ I've been taking it almost 2 months and I don't feel any mental effects at all anymore.  Luckily_ I found a very good general practicioner who prescribes it.  Unfortunately there seem to be some doctors charging hundreds or even thousands of dollars to prescribe this drug.  Shop around for a doctor_ I found one who charges $100 a visit and gives me 90 days of Suboxone.  Anyone who thinks taking Suboxone is to 'trade one addiction for another' is flat-out wrong.  Suboxone does not have the negative consequences associated with abusing opiods.  It allows the user to calm the cravings while focusing on treatment.  I'm going to take it for an indefinate time_ maybe even the rest of my life.  It's a small trade off to have to take two orange pills a day rather than constantly be sick_ overdosing_ and getting arrested for writing false prescriptions.  The half life of buprenorphine (the main ingredient) is up to 72 hours_ so if I miss a dose I don't get sick or feel unwell at all.  Buprenorphine is a PARTIAL opiod-agonist_ which means it satisfies your brain without producing the euphoria associated with oxycodo",M,27,2  months,11/1/2009Email,Suboxone

I told my doctor this and he said its just migraine headaches. but i haven't had migraines since i was a little girl and even then the migraines i remember having did not feel how this feeling feels. Ive heard from some people that suboxone creates headaches in some people and their doctors switch them to subutex. i dont know what the hell this is that is happening to me maybe my body just doesn't agree with something in the medicine. this medication is so new there isn't nearly as much research on it as i wish there was. id def rather be taking this med everyday than what i was doing i just hate having to miss things like school_ events_ etc. because of this sickness I get out of nowhere. if anyone has any info please e-mail me.

I knew to possibly expect the ""precipitated withdrawal"" which they say you can avoid by being in mild to moderate withdrawal_ but you can't tell that subjectively when you're kicking. I guess that is one downside to doing the induction illicitly_ that is without medical supervision or a proper prescription I mean. My brother who was a heavy heroin user for a solid year detoxed with me_ and we waited the 24 hours after our last hit_ still hit him like a ton of bricks. He suffered badly for 2 days and nights straight_ crying out and unable to be still_ I suffered less_ I was less dependent though. I had almost zero side effects the 1st time I used subs to detox_ but then again I was even less dependent at that time. Wish I'd stuck with it after the 1st time. Maybe I'll be smarter this time.",F,30,4  days,1/22/2009Email,Suboxone
110, 1, pain management,Severe constipation_ nervousness_ insomnia_ suicide ideation.,Never take this drug_ it is substiting another way stronger drug. Good luck ever trying to get off. Look forward to months of lethargy_ depression_ insomnia. Stay Away from this awful drug that doctors push like crazy cause they charge outrageous fees that must be paid in cash. Dont believe them_ they know nothing about this drug. Only an 8 hour online course is reqd to perscribe.,M,42,4  months,1/19/2009,Suboxone

113, 5, vicodin dependence,A little sleepy at first_ now I take a very low dose,For me_ anything but vicodin addiction is a Godsend_ I agree.  I now take 1mg_ but have not thought much about getting off of it completely until reading this message board.  I've taken it for a few years without a thought.

114, 1, Addicted to Oxycontin,"Ummm.... is ""living hell"" a side effect?  I agree with the person below.... you're simply prolonging the inevitable.  And the TASTE... I think I'd rather lick the inside of a litter box than to put one of those nasty things in my mouth ever EVER again.  Lots of nausea from that. OK_ it helped me get off Oxycontin_ great... so what drug gets you off of Suboxone????  NONE!  And the REAL kicker is when you EVER HAVE LEGITIMATE PAIN AGAIN IN YOUR *LIFE* -- you know_ like a C-SECTION_ opiates will never relieve your pain again.  On June 30_ I went into labor_ so they had to do an emergency C-Section_ because I had 3 previous ones so I couldn't have a baby the ""normal"" way.  The doctor had put me on Suboxone for a month in NOVEMBER to get off Oxys when I found out I was preggers with my 4th daughter.  After the surgery in JUNE_ what_ EIGHT MONTHS LATER??_ they could not stabilize me in recovery_ because there was NO DRUG that would relieve the pain.  Demerol_ morphine_ di","And to this day_ although I've kicked the opiate habit_ if something happens (like last Saturday_ I fell down a flight of steps) had to go get X-rays (hairline fracture in the spine)_ got a scrip for Darvocet (whoopee... what a useless drug) and it didn't help at all.  I don't know why I even bothered filling it.  And if I take Lortab or Percocet_ i.e. for menstrual cramps or something_ I will get somewhat of a slight buzz_ but NO PAIN RELIEF AT ALL.  I honestly believe that this drug ruined my body to the point of not being able to release endorphins myself_ so my pain tolerance plummeted_ and my drug tolerance SKYROCKETED.  Withdrawals from this drug are lengthy and miserable.  I don't even think my body completely ""withdrew"" from it.  Now my SHRINK has me on Adderall (great! now I'm a speed addict...) because that DRUG completely changed me for the worse_ (mentally and physically) and left me miserable_ STILL_ a YEAR after I last took it_ so my psych had to give me Adderal",F,30,1  months,12/13/2008Email,Suboxone
115, 5, Heroin Addiction,A little bit of constipation_ Suboxone (not subutex) made me very nauseous. The Subutex is what I'm on now...I really can't think of any side effects_ besides how nasty the Suboxone tasted.,There is Suboxone and there is Subutex. I have been on both. The Suboxone worked_ no doubt about it_ however_ it was so disgusting_ I would rather go sick sometimes. If I got too sick_ I'd take it_ but I hated it_ I truly hated it. Luckily_ my doctor switched me to subutex which doesn't have the Naltrexone_ its pure Buprenorphine. The Subutex tastes like a bitter pill_ just like you'd imagine maybe an aspirin would taste if you crushed it up_ but it is a hell of a lot better than that nasty orange suboxone pill. It absolutely works_ 100%. I have no side effects_ at all. I used to get a little constipated_but after a while my body adjusted. I shoot it sometimes_ which I know is still addiction type behavior_but it works so well and immediately_ plus you don't taste a thing. I love it. It doesn't make me high_ I'm just perfectly normal_ like a normal person. It is a safeguard knowing I cannot get high after I take it. The Buprenorphine attaches to your receptor sights so tightly_ if you,F,33,1.5  years,12/6/2008,Suboxone

117, 3, heroine/pain pill addiction,Ummm... another addiction...  Although it did help me quit opiates_ I ran out of suboxone early this month_ and my ins. won't pay for a few days_ now I'm back in the same dark place I thought this med helped me crawl out of - feeling withdrawal_ and like a dope fiend searching through coat pockets and purses to see if I have any bits or pieces to get me through. Just like I did with opiates. I'm feeling sick_ and the anticipation of feeling sicker is the worst. If you are reading this_ just quit cold turkey_ or take suboxone as a detox aid (short term)_ not a maintenance drug. Otherwise_ it will only delay the inevitable.,"There's no mystery here_ suboxone works wonders because it gives a constant supply of relief to people used to kicking cold turkey (usually not by choice). If you've ever gone through the shakes_ the chills_ the skin crawlies_ you don't want to go back. But with suboxone_ you are just delaying that withdrawal_ not escaping it. I thought this drug saved my life too when I started on it two years ago. I was so happy to be a ""normal"" person again_ but I am now wondering if I just traded one addiction for another more socially acceptable_ more ""sustainable"" one. (And if you read my ""side effects"" comments_ you'll see that the supply is not always so constant).If you do go on it_ get off as soon as you can_ I've been on the lowest dose for a year now_ so trust me_ it only gets harder to quit.",F,24,2  years,8/31/2008Email,Suboxone
118, 5, Heroin Addict,Constpation_ beacame naseaous sometimes after taking the pills. But learned to spit out the juice and that reduces that side effect along with feeling light headed.,I was on methadone a couple times and suboxone is so much better!! Would recommend to anyone. The quality of life so much better. Only problem is getting a Dr to give u a RX. It has turned my life around and I am on a low dose of 12mg. I feel normal and not like a zombie like methadone. I have my sexual appetite back and feel things again. Methadone I was like a hermit and didn't know any better and thought I was ok. I detoxed from methadone from 130mg to 7mg in 3 a day increments thining I was going to kick. It was if not worse than dope sick. I got my period one week after quitting methadone. It does alot more to your body than keeping your opiate addiction at ease. 10 months later I am still not back to normal from methadone. Made me gain like 60 lbs in 2 months and my metabolism got all wacked out. They fail to tell u in the methadone clinic. But at the time methadone was a way out of the heroin hole.

120, 5, Prescription Pain Med Addiction,The only side effects I had in the beginning was a slight headache.  About the 3 week on it I went through about 2 weeks where it made me rather sleepy after taking it.,I can not believe what a God send suboxone has been for me. Had I not started this drug when I did I would now either be in jail or I would be dead. I had made up my mind after failing with weaning_cold turkey etc after doing all kinds of research on suboxone that I HAD to do this.  From 30 minutes after taking my first dose I finally feel like ME again. It has been 4 months and my dose is now half of what I started on.  Which was 16 mg a day.  I plan on weaning very slowly and taking my time.  If you wean slowly from this you have no problems.  I am not in any rush because the way I see it_ this protects me. I no longer crave pain medication and I had no withdraws.  If I was a diabetic I would take my diabetic med daily.  Addiction is a diesease just like diabetes and high blood pressure.  I am taking my medicine to control my diesease.  Please_ if your an opiate addict give this a try.  You will be amazed at how you feel. How much of your life you will get back.,F,47,121  days,4/16/2008Email,Suboxone
121, 4, to treat opiate dependence,nausea_ considerable itching_ tiredness_ dizziness.,Suboxone works!  It does not give you the intense buzz of a normal pain pill but rather a consistent low level euphoria that seems to last for several hours.  So far_ it has been working well.  I've been taking 1 8mg pill per day and just 1 pill lasts a while.  Yes_ it is a narcotic itself but it is much better than spending a ton of money on abusing oxycodone...  The other drug in it Naloxone is an opiate antagonist which deters abuse of suboxone itself.,M,21,2  days,3/18/2008,Suboxone

123, 1, to get off oxycontin,The worst side effect of this drug is what you feel when you go off it. It's supposed to be used strictly as a detox med_ but doctors are prescribing it as maintenance_ which after two or three weeks simply gets everyone addicted. When you go off it_ it takes about three months to go through the withdrawal symptoms_ which aren't as acute as cold turkey_ but rather extended for a long period of time. One feels complete apathy_ listless_ no appetite_ and insomnia_ to name but a few. It's an awful awful drug. You have a great sense of well being while on it_ but it hooks you far worse than any other opiate.,Read the posts about Suboxone at www.heroin-detox.com.
