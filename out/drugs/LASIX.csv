I see my regular doctor_ cardiologist and nurse on a weekly basis and they have confirmed the rapid weight loss is actually good for me since I was so overweight. Lasox along with my HBP (lysinopryl) and CHF meds (Coreg) plus a high fiber and low sodium diet has lowered my Blood Pressure and the weight loss has me feeling like a new man.  It looks like I've hit the plateau at 170 but docs want me to get to 130 to get the fat from my belly and liver. Just hoping I can keep up with the lifestyle to maintain my new eight.,M,37,2  months20 MG 1X D,11/28/2011Email,Lasix

18, 3, High Blood Potassium,Hate having to be in the bathroom so much_ etc. Very dry mouth. In the night my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.,I do also have leg swelling_ which Lasix helps. I think it also causes me to have less energy. High potassium is a serious problem_ so unless there is another way to reduce it_ I guess I'll just continue to know where the bathrooms are at every store I go to.,F,64,9  months20mg 1X D,3/10/2011,Lasix

I buy over the counter potassium...it is cheap and I take one or two when I get the cramp's or while taking the Furosemide. This is a great drug if you have CHF...when I feel a heavyness on my chest and have a hard time breathing_ I take one of two of these pill's..along with using my Nebulizer..in 2-4 hour's_ the swelling in my leg's goes down and my breathing become's easier.,M,66,3  years40mg 1X D,8/14/2010Email,Lasix
22, 1, swollen ankles -h.b.p,at first this drug was ok worked good and got rid of swollen ankles! however within aprox 3 weeks of taking it at 20mg per day with verapamil at 240mg  I began to have sudden wake ups at night with very high blood pressure readings! and rapid heart beats ! my breathing was messed up from this drug hard to explain but had drop outs and deep breaths off and on happen when sleeping or trying to sleep! got very bad internal shakeing  jittery feelings threwout my body that traveled head to toe ! however when sitting up right and awake it stopped ?,after reading online and talking to RN and Pharm at the local cvs store_I found I had allergic reactions to the medication- I also broke out in Hives on my back and stomach and arms itching bad and burning hot feeling. the excessive peeing at first had stopped and was back to a normal deal again as before taking this drug ! the ER doctor told me to stop it -dont take it again.  im now on spirolactone it seems to work better with less reactions to it. but we will see ?  im not a fan of taking drugs !! and this one lasix  is a one Nasty medication to take ! to strong !,M,57,2  months20 1X D,7/17/2010,Lasix
23, 3, high blood pressure,muscle cramps and spasms of inner thigh area.  often at night it will wake me from sleep.  also high creatnine level reading that was reduced by stopping my night dosage 80mg and I also take coenzyme 10 now.  But lasix helped me extremely when I was admitted to hospital weighing 400 lbs. and fluid almost went into my lungs.  Lasix works fast but overtime_ you can develop leg/muscle cramps.,,F,59,4  years 2X D,7/8/2010,Lasix
24, 2, blood pressure high,dehydration rapid -dry mouth -tightness in chest off and on! headaches bad ones ! vision blurring while on it_ not lowering b.p at all - no sleep at night and when sleep comes nightmares and vivid dreams going on ! stress feeling ! internal jitters when wakeing up or trying to sleep threwout body from it,this stuff works for swelling ankles and legs but does not help with b.p lowering at all -its distroyed my sleep at night and also dehydrates rapid the side effects from this med are bad !!  not worth taking at all   I have stopped it totaly !  and wont take it again ever !! bad stuff !!,M,56,2  weeks20mg 1X D,6/27/2010Email,Lasix
25, 4, Edema from other prescription drugs,If I don't eat foods rich in potassium_ I can start to feel very ill.  Lethargic_ extreme sleepyness_ almost flu like symptoms.,It's helping keep the swelling and bloating away thatI always get from taking another prescription med. In the past I would stop talking the medication because I could not deal withthe bloating and swelling.,F,43,3  weeks20 mg 1X D,6/26/2010,Lasix
26, 5, Peripheral Edema in Feet and Ankles,Feeling a little tired but managed it with High Potassium foods.You need a bathroom available at all times.,I had Elephant feet_ literally and Lasix 80mg twice a day solved the problem within a week.I still have the swelling but way less than without Lasix.I recommend this medication.Before taking Lasix make sure it won't intract with other meds you may be taking.Always ask your doctor or pharmacist.,M,40,2  weeks,9/17/2009Email,Lasix
27, 5, idiopathic edema,muscle spasms in calves and feet_ postural hypotension,make sure to take potassium.  it usually takes about 1.5 hours to start working for me.  i take 80-160 mg as needed for fluid retention in my face and hands.  if i have to go somewhere or on a long drive_ i'll take it at about 2 am so it's out of my system before i have to do anything.  you have to be close to a bathroom!,F,52,10  years,7/16/2009,Lasix
28, 4, Lower extremity edema_ SLE kidney,Charlie-horse sort of sensation in lower extremities. My legs would cramp up and it would be the most excrutiating feeling! After supplying myself with more potassium_ the sensations slowly went away. It was probably due to the hypokalemia you can get with the lasix.,Works within 5-10mins of use! So_ be prepared!,F,21,6  months,6/21/2009,Lasix

30, 5, fluid after aortic dissection,light - headedness_ ringing in the ears,I took three rounds of lasix while in the hospital. Lasix successfully pulled the excess fluid out of my body_ including the fluid around my lungs. I literally lost 10 pounds in one weekend during one round of lasix. I have been off of my last round now for a week_ and again I am having trouble breathing. I highly recommend this drug for patients with serious edema_ however do not take it if you feel inconvenienced by running back and forth to the bathroom.,F,28,3  months,1/22/2009,Lasix
31, 4, water retention,Just some shakiness if I didn't supplement my potassium level.,This is a great diuretic_ however it works very quickly so you need to be prepared to go to the washroom within an hour of taking it.   I tend to retain water a lot_ so when I take it_ it works quickly.  Unlike other diuretics that can keep you in the bathroom throughout the day at fairly regular intervals_ I have found that Lasix works quickly (done in about 3 hours).  However_ keep bananas around to help supplement your potassium levels so that you don't get shaky.,F,41,2  years,1/10/2009,Lasix
32, 4, fluid build-up around lungs/heart,cramps in legs BUT with potassium added the cramps are gone,If you are getting leg cramps talk to your Dr re: potassium deficienc e due to urinating so much -and loss of this potassium,M,,2  weeks,3/22/2008,Lasix
33, 3, mitral valve regurgitation,Worked well with only dry mouth side effect for one year.  Then started to develop muscle cramps in both hamstring muscles.  These became so severe that I could hardly walk or sleep.  So have stopped Lasix.  Gained 6 lbs of water right away; hope muscle cramps will go away.,Good diuretic_ as long as you don't get any major side effects as I did.,M,76,1.5  years,1/25/2008,Lasix
34, 4, Fluid build-up,dry mouth,removed some of the fluid but not all of it_ also it makes you have to hang out by the bathroom door also causes dizziness,F,47,12  months,11/26/2007,Lasix
35, 1, Congestive Heart Failure,"After about 3 yrs of Lasix (20mg) I developed an unknown allergic reaction that caused blistering on my hands and feet.  My feet would get 20-30 at a time and my hands would get hundreds at a time.  I had to take medication to keep the breakouts minimized.  This slow torture lasted 2 years or so.  Due to a situation on my part that engaged my stubborn streak I was without lasix for a month.  I realized that since I wasn't taking the lasix I also wasn't needing the pill for the blisters.  Started lasix again... blisters.  Stopped taking lasix... no blisters.  After 2 yrs lasix wasn't really working anymore for me so it didn't really matter that I stopped.  I could drink a liter of water have a lasix and still not urinate to excess.  I am still sensitive to processed foods and drinks however that are flavored with the wrong ""fruity flavoring"" (somehow related to a chemical in lasix).  No more blisters or claritin though.  Yeah!",Lasix is definitely not for me.,M,41,5  years,9/19/2007Email,Lasix
36, 5, heart failure - leaky mitral valve,dehydrated and thirsty but what do you expect from a chemical dehydration pill that tells your kidneys to flush all fluids now.,Great drug.  Pulminary edima it's my first choice.  Ate them like candy.  But while dying of fluid in lungs you learn how to survive.  I highly recomend SALT reduction as far better solution.  Food tastes like crap but it's better than chemical dehydrate you pills.  ,M,43,2  years,9/1/2007,Lasix
37, 5, insulin edema,helps with the edema from my frequent insulin dosage (ie keeps weight down) freq urination_ thirsty_ dry skin.  I couldn't live without lasix_ works like a charm.,Be careful about overexposure of sun.  Lasix can intensify sunburn. esp on backs of hands.,F,36,1  years,6/17/2007,Lasix
38, 4, Edema for now !,"none that i can actually say. I feel that a little tiredness is from peeing a lot.I'd rather pee a lot then put my heart all through that extra water fluid to carry. And_ i am not a small lady. i am 5'7"" 3/4.So_ weighing what i do now which is close or on 200 is an awful feeling of unwanted retention.",I would tell you all to just give it a try. Of course_ it may be a life saver for Me. I have had no relief from swelling (edema) for over 3 years or more now_gained over 50 + pounds more then i wanted to.I don't eat a lot of garbage and_ food really has nothing to do with it. Its the fact that HBP_Heart Disease and_ Edema are my biggest targets. Give it a few days to atleast Work. No_ one likes going pee a lot but_ I'd rather pee a lot_ feel somewhat tired and_ know that i can sleep and_ not feel so bloated all the time. I have lost close to 5 pounds already. Now_ thats unwanted water (fluid) as far as i am concerned .I don't need to carry that around everyday.My heart doesn't need to work that hard because my Body can't get rid of the bad toxins naturally. Now_ i could end up not liking all the peeing and_unusual little tiredness but_ people believe me when i do say_ PLEASE---> give it sometime. I will keep you posted as to how i feel and_ what happens. It has only been 1 Day ! =],F,41,1  days,4/14/2007Email,Lasix
39, 2, hypertension,Not many side effects yet_ other than not sleeping well and dry mouth.  Only on it one week so far,The potassium supplement seems to be more of a problem than the lasix but I am afraid to stop it without doctor approval.  I have had bleeding stomach ulcer this past year and reading the side effects does not make me feel comfortable!,F,59,7  days,2/21/2007,Lasix

And_ need to visit the bathroom every l 1/2 hour about 5-6 times a day.,I am better.  I took what the doctor prescribed...lasix_ potassium_ diovan for my bloodpressure_ and correg for my heart since 2004 so that is 3 years but always felt tired with no energy and hardtime breathing.  In late 2005_ I was desperate condition...I found a natural alternative product called stem enhance that after 1/2 hour taking my first two pills.. made me breath better again_ able to talk on the telephone_ climb upstairs_ and walk in the mall. So there is hope...stem enhance gave me back my life.,F,63,3  days,7/17/2006Email,Lasix
43, 3, EXTREME swelling in both feet,20 lb weight gain since taking lasix_ even though I urinate 30-40 times per day - I also have intercistal cystitis.  During the night my hands draw up like I have severe arthritis.  Bloated stomach_ short term memory loss_ extremely dry mouth_ very lethargic.,While the lasix did relieve the swelling in my feet_ which the doctor's never determined what caused it_ and I lost 6 lbs. overnight_ the weight was back up the very next day.  I have gone from 126 lbs to 145 lbs since september_ and I am not eating more than I use to.  The pain in my hands and drawing up in them at night is very painful.  I also have dizziness and am very sleepy in the a.m._ even after a good nights sleep.  Well_ I wouldn't call it so good_ due to the fact that I am up every hour on the hour urinating_ and I take my pill early in the a.m.,F,47,2.5  days,7/17/2006Email,Lasix
44, 5, Hypertension_ slight edema,Perhaps slightly tired at times but that might be my imagination and the dark days of December-January!,Diuresis is remarkable and 3 pounds in several hours is welcome. It's doing a nice job on my blood pressure. I had hoped that 40 mg. in the morning would be enough but I need to take an additional 40 mg. in the evening for more consistent BP control.It replaced thiazides which I had been taking for decades which gave me consistently low serum sodium. Blood tests in the works to see the effects of Lasix on sodium and potassium. Fingers are crossed.Extremely low price is a nice plus.,M,62,40  days,1/17/2006,Lasix
45, 3, congestive heart failure,its supposed to work for six hours. it worked for maybe two with me. i'm going to try demadex( torsemide ) instead. i take 40mg three times a day and still have to take an extra here and there.,from what i have read and experienced_ although both are loop diuretics_ people do not respond to them the same and often do better with one than the other_ but its trial and error to see which is better for YOU.,F,36,6  months,9/13/2005Email,Lasix
