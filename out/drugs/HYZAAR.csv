16, 1, Hypertension,I did not realize for a long time the horrible cognitive problems_ weakness_ fatigue_ malaise_ dizziness_ and  could be from this drug. I have seen a neurologist_ been evaluated for MS and other neurological issues since starting it. The last 6 months my functioning has gone down to almost zero. I have a chronic health condition that causes chronic pain_ and could not understand how or why my health had gone downhill so fast at 40 years old! My son asked me if I was going to have to go to a nursing home! I have repeatedly asked my doctor and pharmacist if I could be having an adverse reaction or interaction_ and now I believe it was both_ but the doctor(s) did not  connect any if this. When I read the comments here_ I actually cried tears of relief...especially the person who said they would rather have dangerously high blood pressure than be a brain-dead invalid. I thought I must have had a stroke already_ but it was adverse drug reactions.,Doctors_ pharmacists_ and patients need better warnings about possible adverse effects!,F,40,6  months50mg 1X D,5/1/2014Email,Hyzaar

18, 5, High blood pressure,Although Hyzaar has done very well at controlling my bp_ I am having hair thinning/hair loss_ dry mouth_ leg cramps and more recently (in past year or so) have had a nagging right-sided neck pain that radiaties into right shoulder - it feels like a bad cramp in neck/shoulder muscles. I did not associate this with taking Hyzaar until a week or so ago when I accidentally ran out of it and was not able to get it refilled for about a 5 days. While I was off of the Hyzaar for those five days I had NO more neck/shoulder pain!! When I started taking it again yesterday_ the neck/shoulder pain are back! I really doubt that this is coincidence - I believe there is a direct correlation between the drug and these symptoms/side effects and will be speaking with my doctor to see if we can come up with an alternative.,,F,61,3  years100/25 1X D,2/19/2014Email,Hyzaar

31, 4, hypertension,I've been on BP meds for more than 10 years. Altace gave me a nagging cough_ Norvasc gave me horrible edema in my legs. Hyzaar is the best for me_ although I've gained 15 pounds since starting it. I'm now over 200 pounds and I hate it! Although_ the weight gain could also be attributed to doubling my dose of anti-depressants. Who knows?,Despite the weight gain_ Hyzaar controls my blood pressure very well (BP consistently averages 125/70) and I've had few other side effects_ except maybe a little dizziness here and there.,F,55,1  years100 1X D,4/22/2012,Hyzaar
32, 2, HBP,Worst is the throbbing leg pain and back pain.  The ringing in my ears is extremely loud.  Weight gain just keeps happening.  I had gastri bypass several years ago and don't eat very much.  On this drug I just keep gaining.  If I exercise_ I don't lose any weight. I've had HPB for 30 years and am scared to stop taking this drug_ but I cannot put up with the muscle cramps in my legs any longer.,I think docs need to read this page as there are a lot of people having the same side effects from this drug.  I will have to find another alternative for reducing my BP.  I think I was fine with just Norvasc.  First I'm going to cease all the prescription meds I take and see if I feel better before starting up with anything new.,F,54,10  years50 1X D,3/19/2012,Hyzaar
33, 3, High Blood Pressure,I have experienced nothing like the severe side-effects mentioned by others on this page. I am not allergic to sulpha drugs. However_ I do have a runny nose daily_ and I believe this stops when I've forgotten to take or run out of Hyzaar. I have many aches and pains_ but since I have osteo-arthritis_ I attribute these pains to that. In the last year_ my eyesight is getting blurry. I thought it was age_ but now_ after reading these comments_ I'm going to ask my doctor if it could be the Hyzaar. I also have thinning hair and weak fingernails. No one else has mentioned this as a side effect.,Hyzaar controls my blood pressure well. My doctor prescribed it after my previous BP medication resulted in my having a continuous cough. I am overweight_ but no heavier than when I started the Hyzaar -- probably less heavy. I have no cough from the Hyzaar.

My doctor ignored my complaints. Switched doctors- they ignored my complaints_ too! Finally I took myself off for a month_ felt 100 % better_ then confessed to the doctor_ who then put me on a beta-blocker_ which works great! Hyzaar felt absolutely fine at first_ but eventually felt like poison. Watch out if you are prescribed this! The side effects are not well documented_ and your doctor may not believe your symptoms are from the drug! Awful medicine.,,F,39,5  years50/12.5 1X D,7/10/2011,Hyzaar

Developed pain and tingling in the arms_ fingers went numb. Went to neurologist for many expensive tests_ everything was fine. Constant menstrual-like cramps. I am 64! Tossed and thrashed all night with legs twitching and severe cramping in calf muscles that woke me up screaming in pain. All  joints started to swell and hurt.

Now I couldn't walk to the mailbo,Be warned_ the side effects creep up on you gradually and they are so diverse you will probably not think to connect them with the Hyzaar. Your doctor will deny that Hyzaar is the cause. If you are not sensitive to sulpha you will probably not have a problem. Only 2.5% of users have a problem. If you ARE one of those_ this stuff will ruin your life! You don't have to be a genius to figure this out. If you have sensitivity to sulpha DO NOT TAKE Hyzaar!  A year ago I was prescribed Bystolic in addition to Hyzaar. It almost killed me. I threw it away. Guess what_ it is a sulpha formulation. My BP is very high_ 186/120. Hyzaar brings it down somewhat but I will not live like a brainless invalid in constant pain_ so I am looking for another doctor and another medication.,F,64,3  years100-25 mg 1X D,5/9/2010,Hyzaar

However_ my blood pressure can go as high as 300/250_ and Hyzaar controls it pretty well. Now I am taking 50/12.5 and was fine until they switched me at the pharmacy to the generic_and that is not controlling my BP well and_ thus_ gives me a headache and makes me not feel well. I also use Resperate. It is a small_ portable machine that plays music and guides your breathing. It always lowers the blood pressure immediately_ about 20-30 mm/Hg. systolic and 10-20 diastolic. The treatment must be done daily for 15 min. for three weeks to have the effect carry through the whole day and sometimes for two or three days.

72, 3, ,Frequent urination_ dry hacking cough_ swelling in lower legs_ some occasional leg cramps_ weight gain and trouble with concentration.,"The first couple years I experienced only frequent urination which I expected and decided I could live with.  I suppose along about this time I really started to gain some serious weight which I attributed to my office job and just being less active than once.  However_ thinking back to before I started taking Hyzaar_ I had always maintained my weight fairly well.  Nonetheless_ it was helping manage my high blood pressure to near normal levels. The last two years or so I have experienced an increase in problems that I attribute to Hyzaar.  There are two that I am very troubled over - 1) trouble with concentration_ 2) dry hacking cough.  Both have had an impact on my job.  The cough comes on in the late afternoon and lasts until I cough myself to sleep at night.  I know it bothers my co-workers and my wife and kids.   I have also noticed that my concentration level and ability to recall routine information has diminished in the last few years.  There are some days that I remain in a ""fog""  from sunup to sundown.  You might wonder why I attribute this to Hyzaar?  Well_ several months ago I ran out of medicine as I was switching to a new doctor.  I did not take my Hyzaar for three days.  During this time I did not experience any coughing and I felt completely alert and was able to deeply concentrate on my work.  The problems returned upon taking the medicine again.",M,44,6  years,7/7/2009,Hyzaar

111, 4, HTN,DIZZY!!!!!!!!! I am so dizzy! Not all the time and not always really severe but enough to notice and be really uncomfortable at times. I have had spells where I have had to hold onto things. Feels like sea legs. I have not noticed any insomnia or racing/pounding heart. In fact this med has helped control my racing pulse. Slight runny nose with some congestion at times however I do have a preschool age child and it is allergy season so.... we will see!,I was on Micardis 80/25 and the cardiac side effects were soo extreme that I had to switch. Bp was also way too low at 100/60. I stay around 125/84 now. I was a 160/110 while up and 140/90 resting before meds. Otherwise am a healthy young women. No cause for HTN no family history .. renal scans_ ECHO_ EKGS_ 24 urine_ serum tests all come back normal. I am kind of hyper and now am always stressed due to the demands of nursing school and being single mom. I hope to continue this drug. So I am hoping that this dizziness goes away.???,F,23,6  days,4/20/2008Email,Hyzaar
112, 2, ,Dizziness_ nausea_ bloating and abdominal pain_ pain in legs_ total loss of energy_ weight gain_ fast pulse,This is an update of my earlier comments about this drug.  I keep gaining weight (which certainly can't help my blood pressure)_ my abdominal area is constantly bloated and achy_ I have no energy to do anything_ my legs hurt like crazy and my pulse is always fast.  I was originally on two other bp medicines which I gave up because of severe side effects_ and when my doctor prescribed Hyzaar I thought at first that this pill was a better fit because the side effects didn't seem so severe (at first).  Over the course of the last few months I have been miserable - I can't remember what it's like to actually feel good.  When I tried to wean myself off the Hyzaar_ my blood pressure went back up. I am getting ready to go and see my doctor (again)_ but I have a feeling he won't do much more than prescribe something else (probably whatever is the newest bp medicine to come out on the market).  Totally discouraged at this point.,F,56,8  months,4/3/2008,Hyzaar

I have to contol food intake more now to avoid weight gain but that could be my age and activity level.  My memory recall isn't what it used to be_ maybe the Hyzaar?  I normally like to work hard_ physically_ not now.,I started on Cozaar but it didn't achieve the desired BP level.  Hyzaar has my BP at 120/80.  I don't want to take meds for the rest of my life but can't tell if other options are better.  I had an episode when my BP spiked to 190/120 and I felt terrible.  That is when I started the meds.

I do not attribute them to hyzaar.,It brought my BP down from 160/100 to 140/80 so it has been beneficial in that regard.

170, 1, bp med sular wasn't keeping bp down,severe nausea_ diarrhea_ vomitting,I was taken off all other meds and only taking this one. I would wake up feeling fine_ eat breakfast_ and then take hyzaar. Almost immediately_ I would get severely nauseated_ and be in bed most of the day nauseated and having diarrhea. They would then give me a shot to help the nausea_ which by about 8pm I would start feeling good again_ only to go through tthe same process each morning for over a week_ until I was released from the hospital. Because of the nausea_ and not being able to eat_ I became dehydrated to the point that IV was needed to rehydrate. I do have a sulfa allergy_ and this drug has some components of sulfa_ and as soon as I stopped taking this med_ I was better_ with no symptoms returning.,F,65,7  days,1/28/2003Email,Hyzaar
