0, 1, Iron Deficiency Anemia,125 mg over 1 hr w/100mL NS. All well until end of infusion when I suddenly developed SEVERE bilateral thoracic/lumber spasming which we thought was my kidneys. So excruciating upon inhalation that my SpO2 (O2 saturation) dropped below 70 & I went into tachycardia. VERY scary. This Rx may work but there are simply too many serious side effects. No thanks. I was terrified of anaphylaxis during my whole infusion so at least that didn't happen.,After research_ Dr. said severe muscle spasming was side effect. Said from what he could tell it only affected skeletal muscle but_ I wanted to let others know.,F,36,1  days125mg,4/1/2015,Ferrlecit
1, 4, Iron deficiency anemia,Blurred vision_ lightheadedness_ edema.,Have combated the first two side effects by doubling the amount of saline to 250ml and slowing the infusion time down to 100.  Using diuretic to combat the edema.  Have recently cut dose in half to 62.5 every four weeks.  This drug is a lifesaver for me since I don't absorb iron at all.,F,54,4.5  years,12/28/2009Email,Ferrlecit
2, 1, Sickle cell anemia,Blurred vision_ nausea and light headedness_ and severeabdominal pain,I would not recommend this drug to anyone! I have been afraid ever since I took it of what the long-term negative effects may do to my body. I just checked it all about a year ago and started my Oxygen Therapy Program. Today I am healthier than I have ever been.,F,53,6  months,11/3/2009Email,Ferrlecit
