1, 5, Knees,None,This drug enables me to be much more physically active with less dependence on pain relievers.  I can bike at fairly high levels of intensity for as much as 25 miles.  I haven't tried longer but I'm sure I could and getting to that level was a great accomplishment.  I have had 6 knee surgeries including 2 partial replacements.  Use it before exercise.  Reapply after shower and before bed.  Highly recommended!  It has not eliminated the need for oral pain meds in all situatations but has helped.,M,56,18  months1.5% 3X D,7/7/2012,Pennsaid
2, 1, Hip bursitis,I only used it 3X but developed kidney pain each time and elevated BP. Within an hour of the last time I applied it_ my heart rate jumped to 106 & my BP 145/95. I also experienced horrible anxiety. I thought I was going to have heart attack or stroke.,,F,51,1  days10 drops,3/21/2012,Pennsaid
3, 5, joint pain in wrist and shoulder,My God_this stuff is great! Used on my extremely painful shoulder and within minutes felt relief.(I thought it might be the Advil I had taken earlier kicking in) However_ several days later_had a flare with joint pain in wrist. Squeezed out a few drops and rubbed it in and pain relief was almost immediate.I read that this is prescribed for knee pain but my doctor gave me a sample because the voltaren has worked ok for me and I can't take Advil a lot because of the gastro effects. Boy_I love this stuff and will ask for a script next time I see the Rheumy.,,F,52,2  days15 drops? 1X D,1/8/2011,Pennsaid
