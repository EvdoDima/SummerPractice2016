0, 2, Breakouts,Dry skin_ itchiness_ lots of peeling and redness around corners of mouth and eyes_ burning face,I loved this so much the first week. My face didn't look different with or without foundation and I have no pimples. However after the first week my face become incredibly dry and my skin had started peeling around my mouth. Just before this I had to stop using any makeup at all due to the fact it burned to put on and take off_ so unfortunately I couldn't even try to hide it. I assumed it was my dose so I used it every other night and my condition still worsened to the point it was peeling all over my face and it would burn to even put my face on my pillow at night. No acne but not worth the burning and peeling I have everyday.,F,17,1  weeks,3/9/2016,Differin

2, 1, Under the skin acne,Burning sensation on face and very red and sore.,If your skin is in any way sensitive do not use this product. I was on roacutane for a year and did not experience side effects as awful as this. After using a thin layer over my spots on one night less than 24 hours later my face started to develop red blotches which soon turned to burning red areas encompassing my forehead and right cheek. I was so worried I even called the NHS helpline number and went to my GP. I repeat do not use if you have in any way sensitive skin. The cons far outweigh the pros.,F,19,1  days1 / night,11/27/2015,Differin

5, 5, Face Acne/ Hidradenitis Suppurativa,If I used the cream for more than 7 days continuously my face would get VERY sensitive and even water would cause it to burn. Not good when at the gym eather as the sweat would also cause my face to burn. Even rubbing with a towel hurt. It basically felt like SUNBURN. But this was using it constantly. I'm now taking breaks. Also it does ger worse before it gets better but after the 'worst' part you'll never have acne again like that after using it.,Take breaks between using it. Cover your face with a towel if you want to use sun beds. Apply moisturiser in the morning after using it during the night.,F,21,3  months,2/26/2015,Differin

7, 4, breakout,micro peeling_ gets worse before gets better,I used to have clear skin until November last year. I tried using apple cider vinegar diluted with water but it was to drying for my skin and caused morw breakout. I went to the dermatologist and she prescribed me with adapalene_ though it can be bought otc here in the Philippines. On my first week it  really gotten worse I got pimples even on areas I didnt have before but it seems to dry easily. Tomorrow it is already my 3rd week of using it I am really satisfied with it since my derma said that normally it would take 3 months before one can see a result.,F,27,3  weeks,2/10/2015Email,Differin
8, 5, Acne,Burning sensation the first week or so,This really worked for me when nothing else did. It gets worse before it gets better but my skin never looked better once it started working and eventually after about a year or so I didn't even need to use it. My breakouts stopped until I got pregnant. It was a miracle drug for me and the burning will stop once you use it for awhile you have to use it every day though and just try to deal with the burning while it last it's worth it in the end or at least it was for me.,F,20,3  yearsthin film 1X D,1/2/2015,Differin

20, 1, Adult Acne,Two years later still get pimples on chest and have scars on back caused by Differin gel. Never had pimples in those two places prior to taking Differin.,At first I felt like the Differin gel was working_ but the many side effects outweighed the benefits for me.  The redness_ very unsightly peeling_ burning_ and acne in places I never had acne before were just not worth it for me. I would NEVER take this medication again.  Now two years later_ I still get some pimples on my chest and have scars on my back from the pimples caused by Differin_ both places I never had acne before until taking this medication.  I would NOT recommend this medication to anyone based on the fact that the side effects are far greater than the benefits. Hope this helps some of you.

I am a very patient person_ but I was prescribed this medication after using a low dosage of Retinol-A for about a year. It was too intense and I saw no relief.Now_ this seems to be far worse than Retinol-A because the dryness is even worse and it SPREADS!!!! I have no idea why.

28, 4, Acne and blackheads: face and back,So for the first three or so weeks I had horrible_ horrible burning_ feeling and redness all over my face. Not really much reaction on my back. I suggest for the initial week_ start with putting some Cetaphil or other light moisturiser underneath before the Differin.After that_ slowly (after what felt like honestly_ years!) the pimples started clearing up all around my forehead and down the hairline oh my face. I kept applying it for about 3 more months and it definitely kept the large pimples at bay. before I got lazy and stopped for a while.,So far_ I'm fairly happy with Differin_ it takes some dedication to use it erryday for a few months_ but it does make quite a difference. I find it only really clears up the acne bumps extremely well and not really blackheads that much_ but that's alright.,F,15,6  monthssmall blob 1X AN,6/3/2012,Differin

But after I would stop taking accutane_ I would always return to retin a_ benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. With accutane_ I rarely get big sits_ just little ones.  It is much more effective than retin a and I will never need accutane again. I have the oiliest skin known to man kind.

32, 1, Acne,Extreme burning and peeling!,Well_ I'm 14 years old and I started using differin (adapalene gel 0.1%)to cure acne and that's what the derma told me to use_ in fact it was so expensive and takes time for me to buy it. I applied it nightly and didn't even last at least a week! On the first day after I use it_ seems like nothing just happened but just drying of the face (the parts where I applied it). On the second day_ I notice some parts of my face got red and acne got worse!(probably_ this is where I applied the differin). Then after the third time of using it_ my face really did hurt a lot after taking a bath and putting some products like vaseline men etc. on my face. In fact_ washing it with soap also hurts and causes peeling of the skin. I would really not recommend it to you 'coz it will really cause an extreme burning and peeling of the skin. Now_ I don't know what to do_ but just wait for the time for my face to be back to it's normal color again. I regret using this product and I will never ever use this again.

33, 4, moderate acne,I am now 13 years old and am on this medicine again. I used this about 6 months ago. I experienced redness_ redness_ redness_ redness_redness_redness_ and dryness. I discontinued use becuase of how red it made my skin. Later_ i reliezed i was using too much of it a nights. I ran out of the differin every 2 weeks which proves that I used WAY TO MUCH. you are only supposed to use a pea size amount over your acne. I wouldnt reccomend putting it all over your face if u want a sunburned_ dry_ and burning face for the next week or so. DO NOT STOP USING THIS. Iknow it seems worse before its better_ but thats the point. It makes acne come to the surface so it comes out. The side effects are not great and I know how it is to feel very selfconsious about it_ but take a deep breath and be optimistic towards your acne getting better. do not pick or pop zits unless their at the surface_ (when acnes infected)  I would reccomend a mild face wash.

34, 5, moderate adult acne,very mild dryness,I had perfect babybutt smooth skin until about 23 yrs old_ I began seeing a dermatologist after about a year of suffering and my acne was scarring my face. I can't remember over the course of ten years all the RX and OTC's I tried and went to  aprox. five different dr's. I even did a round of accutane which made my moderate acne so much worse _ I began getting cystic acne sometimes with cysts the size of a plum. At 33 I went to a new dermatologist this was my first visit in five years after the accutane nightmare_ I was skeptical  but wanted to try one more time_ She prescribed Differin gel.I applied a pea sized amount every nite and a moisterizer_ I didn't notice any changes for weeks_ after about a month or so I was still breaking out but also noticed some small hard whiteheads . Around the four month mark BAM! perfect skin _no zits_ blackheads or whiteheads after six months my acne scars were nearly gone. From that time on it just got better my face looked perfect . unfortunately I can't afford it anymore_after stopping use for a year and ahalf my skin stayed clear  for about two years and then the acne returned _ I still don't have insurance (it's been about four years) and when I do have the ability the first thing i'm doing is getting an RX for differin again .,F,40,18  months3% 1X D,1/1/2012Email,Differin

The retinoids today have less side effects if used correctly.  There is less scaling and burning if you wait 20 minutes to apply after washing your face.  Mix only a pea sized amount to a moisturizer and apply.  There will be side effects for the first few weeks and results may not appear for 1-3 months.  Be patient and DO NOT use too much.

Some mornings after applying it I will wake up with very oily skin_ but it wipes off easily. Caused some mild  flaking when I used it in combination with my make-up which contains salicylic acid.,I have seen a marked improvement in my mild acne_ but so far have seen little to no change in the small cyst on my face which is what it was primarily prescribed for.

38, 4, Hormonal Cystic Acne_ Blackheads,I have very sensitive_ oily skin.  At first_ my skin looked horrible_ but once the top layer started flaking off_ things got better.  Now I can put it on my forehead_ nose and chin without irritation.  I have dermatitis on my cheeks and above my eyes_ and I have constant flare ups_ so unfortunately I have to avoid those areas of my face.  However_ I am able to use it where the acne is (my T-zone & chin) so I'm happy with it.  So far I can tell it's working on clearing up those stubborn blackheads that I haven't been able to get rid of since I hit puberty!  I'm 30 now_ and I wish I had used something like this early on because my pores are severely damaged now.,DO apply it every other night_ or even every 2 nights at first.

My skin isn ́t too oily_ so after having read the reviews am worried about the extra dryness. I can ́t say I ́m satisfied with the results just yet_ however will try to see if it works.,Differin is said to promote the formation of collagen which helps not to scar.

42, 5, Mild_ Moderate_ and Hormonal Acne,Burning and dry skin,PLEASE PLEASE READ!When I first started using Differin_ I was using it incorrectly. This may be the issue with some of the dissatisfied reviews. Yes_ this is an annoyingly lengthy routine_ but it works. In most cases your acne will get worse before it gets better. This wasn't a selling point to me_ as I'm *very* self conscious about my acne_ but I tried it.I have sensitive skin_ so I know how the burning side effect can be an annoyance_ but please read.AT NIGHT_ THIS IS MY ROUTINE1. I wash my face with Fragrance-Free Neutrogena Original Formula. This is the bar soap for sensitive skin.2. I PAT my face dry_ wait a few minutes (I usually brush my teeth during this time).3. I apply Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner (from the Body Shop). Here_ you'll notice all of the excess dirt/oil that is hindering Differin's effectiveness.4. I wait 20 minutes and apply a pea sized amount of Differin all over my face.5. I wait another 20 minutes and apply Neutrogena's Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin. It is absolutely imperative that you use a moisturizer. Small whiteheads will start to appear after using this product for a short time. This is the medicine working. Your pores are finally expelling all of that embedded oil. If you have moderate acne_ I strongly recommend this product. It is worth it.,F,25,2  months.3% 1X D,7/11/2011Email,Differin

I look like I have the strangest sunburn and the peeling is a bit embarrasing.  Make sure to pick up a moisturizer to stick in your purse while you're out.

55, 4, Severe Acne,For the first 2 weeks I had really painful_ dry_ and itchy skin. Afterwards it went away but redness didn't go away for about 2 months or so.,It has REALLY helped_ I recommend this because it's a topical that actually gets rid of the acne instead of temporarily making it disappear. I do admit_ though_ that it does take a while- I'm halfway into my fourth month and I have very little acne but it's close to going away. I visited my dermatologist last week and she said I was doing really well; I still have about another 6 months until I can go off of Differin but other than that I'm really happy that it's actually doing something. Looking at my pictures from several months ago I see that it really has made a difference_ although I couldn't tell before (since it took so long).,M,17,4  months45g 1X D,11/23/2010,Differin

When I was about 11_ I started developing severe acne on my forehead_ cheeks_chin_ forehead and back. They where large_ painful cysts. I went to the derm after about a year and she has done nothing but torture me_ the whole visit she tried to sell me acne pills that you have to take a pregnancy test to be on (nothing doing!!) and told me that my acne was horrible!! She perscribed Differin and the first couple of months it worked pretty well_ it got rid of the painful cysts and a lot of the redness_ but then the side affects hit. They are even worse than the acne was_ I have to put on lotion and sunscreen 2 or 3 times a day to avoid killing my self for the itching on my upper arms and neck_if I get the lest little bit upset_ that makes it itch too_ and if I sweat_ it burns like crap plus all the other effects I listed above. I am currently not taking it and praying that my acne won't come back.I'm going to make and appointment with ANOTHER derm and get perscribed something different.

62, 4, moderate to severe acne,I am on Differin for the second time in my life. Had to stop taking it before because I did not have insurance. This product initially causes flakiness and sensitivity but it gets better the more you use it. You can start by using it every other day or so and use it nightly after your skin gets used to it.,My doctor specifically said only a pea sized amount and only at night. The sun makes the medicine ineffective so if you are putting it on in the morning_ you are wasting your time! Also you MUST wear sunscreen with this product - it makes you very sensitive to the sun. My doctor also told me that when you apply it_ the differin spreads itself once your skin absorbs it. so AVOID ANY AREA BY YOUR EYES! you have to account for the medicine spreading to this area on its own so be careful! Differin changes the direction in which your skin grows_ so it is less likely to be clogged by dirt and oil. It is a prevention medicine that only works while you continue to use it!,F,27,6  days.03% 1X D,6/1/2010,Differin

I stopped using it in August(may right now) and my acne slowly came back because I irritated my skin while shaving to much and started takin protein which made my hormones crazy and caused me to break out. Now my acne is SEVERE. I used retin-a for a week n almost cried when i put my face on a pillow because it hurt so bad!The first 3 days of using Differin once again my face felt like a face again and not an open wound.

71, 4, adult acne; hormonal acne,Dryness and burning_ appeared to age overnight especially around the eyes,The first week I had severe burning then dryness and peeling.  My eyes appeared to age overnight.  However_ the peeling is revealing newer skin with smaller pores and a glow I have not had in years.  The product dries out the skin's upper layers as it is supposed to.  The aging appearance is your skin drying out like a layer shedding snake skin (a little embellishing)  that needs to shed to reveal the new skin.  If you can endure the burn torture it is well worth the youthful look you get in a week or two_ if you are over 35.  If you are younger you might want to try something else.  As for the acne_ mine did get worse over the first 1-2 weeks but dried out and is now healing.  I am on week 2 still.  I think it shows promise but Differin def has a price to get you where you want to go.  Oh_ just a good laugh for you: I was chopping chiles the other day and rubbed my cheeks on accident.  Now that together with the 3rd day on Differin and my face was red like a sunburn and wow did it hurt.  I guess the days following that were nothing compared.I did use this product years ago in my early 30s for spot treatment during PMS.  It worked really good.

80, 4, Teenage Acne,Inflammation_ Flaking_ Dryness,"Over the last 4 years or so dealing with acne I've tried many prescriptions. Many of which either relieved my acne on a short-term basis or simply none at all. My dermatologist prescribed me differin. As a tip_ follow the instructions except for one thing: it is not necessary for you to apply 3-4 pea size drops as it mentions. You only need enough to cover ""affected"" areas. For me it's one and a half pea size. Combined with a moisturizer such as cetaphil is highly recommended otherwise you can expect excessive dryness and a lot of flaking during the next few days. Dryness and flakes gradually reduce over the course of usage. I apply differin every three days or so ever since I had experiences similar to another user in regards to swollen eyes. Keep it as much as away from the eyes_ that includes washing your eyes after applying as you might scratch your eyes or something while sleeping. When my skin started burning I stopped and waited until most of it subsidized and I reapply. Also apply a layer of 30fps sunscreen as any long periods of sun/light source exposure can further make your skin burn. Overall_ your skin will get better. I've seen major improvement and there are areas of my skin where it has become smooth. Patience is the key to differin.",M,18,2  months,12/1/2009,Differin

I'm glad I did_ because my skin is 100% clear and I can go out without makeup and still receive compliments_ which makes me feel very confident. During the first 3 months I would get one or two very deep_ very tenacious pimples that have left red marks_ but the red marks are slowly fading. I was prescribed a combo of Differin and Metrogel_ which seems to be helping to fade redness and old acne marks. I noticed that I get a build-up of dry_ rough skin depending on how much I apply - too much and my skin gets flaky - so really use Differin sparingly and it will help with the dryness.,F,29,5  months,10/13/2009,Differin

I saw immediate results in removing blackhead on my nose.  My skin is more evened out and I am more comfortable going in public without foundation.  Also is removing fine lines and brown spots.

87, 1, hormonal cystic acne,The day after applying Differin for the first time_ I experienced flushing and burning_ similar to a mild sunburn all over my face.  By that night_ my face was completely covered with miniscule water blisters that began spreading down my neck and chest_ even though I only applied a pea-sized amount of Differin to my face.  My face then began to swell_ with fine wrinkles appearing around my eyes and mouth_ and my face is now burning fiercely. I am also experiencing the formation of some pimples_ but the pimples are nothing compared to the water blisters.  Due to the water blisters that were not listed as a side effect on the medicine label_ I have not applied any more Differin to my face_ although I was supposed to use it twice weekly.  It has been almost a week since I first applied Differin_ and my symptoms are getting worse_ rather than improving.  I am_ of course_ still waiting for the phone nurse from my dermatologist to return my calls regarding what I should do.,Regardless of whether or not your dermatologist believes you can use this product_ if you have sensitive skin_ a fair complexion_ and/or mild acne_ I would strongly recommend that you do thorough research about Differin and only do a small spot test to begin treatment.  I am sure this product works well for some people_ but like any medication_ there are always exceptions. I  would much rather suffer from acne than use this product again_ which is a strong statement_ as cystic acne is excruciatingly painful.  Please exercise caution when considering the use of this product.,F,25,5  days,7/22/2009,Differin

After awhile this goes away your skin will adjust and you'll be left with flawless skin.  BE PATIENT!!! Most of those comments are from people using it less than a month.  It does work! Trust me.

I had tried just about everything over and under the counter for acne_ and I had hoped that Differin would be my miracle drug. Now I just wish I had never used it! Trying to put on makeup's a joke_ because it just all clumps and flakes all of the dead skin into massive bits that are impossible to peel off. Using any soap or water or moisturizer after you've used this feels like your face is on fire_ and the itching is unbearable. I'm a 13 year old girl with enough image problems as it is.

95, 1, Acne,Horrible sunburn type rash that itched mercilessly all over my neck where Differin was never even applied (I know because every time I stopped using the gel_ the rash would miraculously disappear from my neck and then reappear once I restarted again). Miserable rash that lasted 6 months until I finally made the connection to this product!The rash felt very systemic. It was never raised or bumpy. It looked like I had a terrible sunburn and itched like crazy. It's been weeks since I've stopped using this gel and my face still feels hot. I also notice that I can no longer use the products I use to use without any problems because now they all burn and cause extreme sensitivity. In fact if I use anything of any strength (even weak Salicylic Acid)_ it starts to make my neck red (although not nearly as bad as when I was actively using the gel). I am guessing my skin thinned terribly and will never be the same as a result of this crap. Think carefully before using this product. Wh,Please use this product with extreme caution though I would not advise anyone to use it period! Please see side effects for what this has done to me. If you google Differin with the words rash_ irritation_ harmful_ etc you will find posts from other people asking if others have gotten a strange rash on their necks or chests after using Differin on their faces (some getting a rash by simple exertion or exercise when they never got this before using Differin). All kinds of odd little systemic flushing and rash like problems that coincidentally only occurred after beginning this topical! I wish I could turn back father time.,F,37,180  days,1/2/2009,Differin

102, 2, Breakouts,Dryness_dull skin_light peeling,I was prescibed this by a dermatologist that told me if I used nothing else to use this and I would get fantastic results.  I saw nothing at all.  I waited month after month and the same under skin bumps just stayed exactly where they were with no impovement.  In fact the product made my chin worse and I developed several deep pimples as a result.  I stopped using Differin and used benzoyl peroxide instead sparingly with a good moisturizer and my skin cleared.  The differin seemed to bring the pimples out and not let them go away. I saw no clearing with Differin.  Very disappointing.  I only give it a 2 rating because the irritation I expected was not as bad as I thought it would be_ it just doesn't heal pimples at all.,F,28,3  months,10/1/2008,Differin

106, 2, mild acne,huge breakout of whiteheads_ drying_ peeling_ bumps_ far worse than when started,i used differin a few months ago just for the blackheads on my nose and that seemed to help. recently i put it over my entire face to unclog my skin and it is horrible. i have 20-30 whiteheads when i've never gotten whiteheads before. yesterday i made the mistake of using differin right after the shower when my pours were open and that evening i woke up with a burning face and peeling skin everywhere. dont use it on open pours or right after washing your face. you'll be sorry. ive heard good things about this product but i dont have a year to wait for it to work or even 4 months. i like mario badescu drying lotion. it works immediately on pimples or minor acne. i think my skin has become too used to it though because it used to do wonders when i first started it years ago and it still helps but not as much. if u rather have a quick fix and differin isnt working for u i would give it a try. also neotrogeuna blackhead scrub and blackhead pore mask/cleanser work well to keep my face clear,F,21,2  weeks,9/6/2008,Differin
107, 5, Persistant Acne,Mild drying of the skin,I have been taking differin since i first turned 20 years old. I have always had MAJOR acne and had begun to get a TON of scarring from it. My dermatologist told me to use differin and now my skin is flawless. Not only does it help me skin control oil_ but it minimizes my pores and makes my skin so smooth. i believe it helped the scarring fade too. you can still see the acne scars SOMEWHAT_ but my makeup covers it. I reccommend that when yo start using the gel_ put on a light moisturizer afterwards. use it every other night then work your way to every night. I actually use mine in the morning and the night without a moisturizer now and people can't believe how nice my skin is now. On a scale of 1 to 10_ this product gets a 20. My confidence has never been better.,F,21,1  years,8/19/2008,Differin
108, 1, light acne,redness_ dryness_ burning sensation_ and peeling.,This has been by far the worst acne product avalible. do not use it leaves you worse than when you started. the pimples clear up but i developed side effects that made me want to have the skin i had before.,F,16,2  weeks,8/17/2008,Differin

And a burning sensation when any OTHER product was applyed the following morning_ making it really sensitive to touch.,I have only been using it for a week but i can see a big difference already. the first couple of days my acne worsened- just got more red and broke out. But today i can already see a good difference in my skin.,F,16,7  days,8/6/2008,Differin
110, 5, Ongoing acne,Flaking without moisturizer_ intial dryness_ occasional isolated pimples when taking more than two days off of the medication.,Differin honestly changed my life. I got SO many compliments on my newly smooth skin and I never experienced any breakouts while on the medication. Occasionally a pimple would appear IF and ONLY IF I went off of the medication for more than two days. Some may feel sticking to this regimen is annoying but the results are truly worth it. My dermatologist switched me to Retin-A and it's not nearly is good and I hope to get another prescription for Differin.,F,18,1.3  years,7/8/2008,Differin

112, 5, Teenage acne.,At first_ my face was drying out. It was peeling and burning. But I used the oil-free lotion my doctor prescribed and that helped. Now_ it isn't dry or peeling at all.,I've tried Proactiv_ Clearasil_ Clean and Clear_ everything! Nothing worked. It would dry my face completely out or do nothing at all. But Differin has been working for me. I can definitely see an improvement. My acne is slowly fading away. You have to be patient with Differin. But it does work.,F,16,2  months,6/17/2008,Differin
113, 5, little pimples and cystic acne,Dry skin_ Itchiness_ redness_ very increased acne until it got much better.  Side effects were bad at first but after 6 months its gotten much better.,The first couple months were awful... I counted down every day to 4 weeks... then 8 weeks... then 12 weeks.  Need to be patient to experience good results!  At first I experienced extremely dry_ peeling skin_ redness_ itchiness.  My face became worse than ever before and I was embarrassed to go out in public.  I also went through phases where my skin was really dry (also during the winter) so I used Cetaphil strong face moisturizor.  But then_ my skin started to get oily (when the weather got warmer)_ so I switched to an oil free Neutrogena face moisturizor_ and covered up with Clinique Advanced Concealer and Clinique Powder (Clinique has worked great as a great coverup of acne for me!).  After about 4 months on Differin .1%_ I still wasn't completely satisfied with my results. I went back to the dermatologist and was prescribed Differin .3%.  This has worked with amazing results_ and now I'm happier with my skin than I have been in a long time.  Bottom line... it takes time to work.,F,24,6  months,6/13/2008Email,Differin
114, 1, mild to moderate acne,dryness_ burning_ tingling_ tightness_ wrinkles_ peeling,After the fourteenth day or so of taking this medication I started to experience a burning sensation where the application was applied (cheeks and chin).  Also_ my whole face started to peel a lot and my face felt very tight and dry.  The most alarming side effect of this medication is the wrinkles it produced.  I got new fine lines under my eyes and near my mouth and nose.  It seems like the places near where I placed the cream wrinkled.  Before I started using any vitamin A products I had no wrinkles.  I used Retina-A two years ago for a few days.  After I used this product I saw a fine line under my left eye.  But I thought maybe I never noticed it before because I wasn't paying close attention to my face.  After the first wrinkle_ I've been paying very close attention.  I now have fine wrinkles under both eyes and near my mouth and nose.  These wrinkles were not here before I started using differin.  To me it isn't worth wrinkles to have very clear skin.  If wrinkles bother you_ do,F,26,14  days,4/30/2008,Differin
115, 5, acne,Initially_ had to start with every third night and work up to every night due to burning. Also had a mild increase in acne_ small bumps all over_ for a few weeks.  And some initial peeling.  Was annoying but I could live with it.  After that_ I still get some dryness/peeling every once and a while but nothing else.,I love Differin.  It has helped both my acne and my acne scars.  It also has greatly improved my overall skin texture!  I saw some change at 3 months_ but real change came around 6-8 months.  So do be patient and keep using it!  Far too many people quit before the medication has a chance to work.,F,27,9  months,4/9/2008,Differin
116, 4, adult acne,I didn't have any major side effects_ but it seemed like my skin became much oilier for a few weeks (and it is back to normal oiliness now).  My skin didn't turn red_ dry or flaky ever_ nor did i have any irritation.,I had acne in late high school and early college.  I started on ortho-tri cyclen and had terrific results for about 8 years.  My skin was as close to flawless as I could have hoped.  For a couple of reasons_ I had to get off the pill 2 years ago and within about 3 months_ my face started to break out again. I thought I could handle it but in the past 6 months it's really gotten worse and I felt pretty self-conscious about it.  As an alternative to the pill which I know will clear me up_ I started Differin 1% at night and Clindamycin lotion in the morning.  Like many_ my face got worse.  It was bad and pretty horrifying as I was just starting to date someone.  But after about 7 weeks_ my face started to clear up.  I'm on week 8 and my face is pretty smooth.  I still have the marks from zits past_ but i'm hoping they will fade in time and the medicine keeps new ones in check.  So_ to add more testimony to the others'_ this might work for you if you are willing to stay on it for several w,F,31,8  weeks,3/17/2008,Differin
117, 5, ,very little drying,Those of you who reported an increase in acne when starting dont stop! This is what the drug is supposed to do! Its bringing out pimples deep in your skin.  After 6 months this stopped. Then_ my acne disappeared for good. Let it work. The pay-off after a few months is well worth it. A little acne now_ then gone for good. Ive been almost acne free for 3 years. Be patient_ and let it work. I think its a miracle drug.,M,39,3  years,1/20/2008,Differin
118, 5, severe acne_ in combo w/other drugs,Initially_ burning and peeling. Had to work up to every night.  Started with every 3rd night_ then every other night_ then every night due to burning.  Peeling was more of a nuisance and subsided in a couple of weeks.  Did notice an increase in acne during the first month or so_ lots of very small pimples in places I usually didn't get them.  It was frustrating but bearable.  It eventually subsided and now it's smooth.  I still experience occasional burning and peeling but overall no more side effects.,I really like it.  It's helped my acne and my skin tone is really good.  Fine lines are gone_ skin tone is more even and brighter overall.  It also seems to have helped some of my pitted scarring.  I noticed some improvement in the scarring around 3-4 months_ but not much.  I'm at the 6 month mark now and I am really seeing some good results - both with scars and with overall skin tone.  My skin looks really good overall. Very happy with Differin.  You really do need to give the drug time to work though_ many months.,F,27,6  months,1/2/2008,Differin
119, 5, Acne problems.,My face was dry for the first two weeks.  I used a prescribed facial lotion on my face morning and night along with only using differin every other night for the first two weeks.  My skin is still dry if i forget to apply the lotion_ but its not as bad as those beginning days.,It really works!  It's not a cure-all though.  Nothing is.  You just have to be patient and endure the annoyance of applying it on your face EVERY night for 12 weeks to get the full results.  But its totally worth it!  It doesn't get rid of acne scars majorly_ but does help them fade.,F,15,14  weeks,12/3/2007Email,Differin
120, 4, Adult acne,Dryness_ tightness_ redness_ mild discomfort_ peeling_ irritation_ sensitivity and headaches.,I have had mild but chronic acne since puberty and hoped once I hit adulthood it would go away.  Instead in my mid to late thirties it got a little worse. It got even worse when I went through seven months of army training (eating only army food and daily physical training which raises testosterone level). I decided to get something for it so my skin would be halfway decent when my husband returned from his third deployment in Iraq.  There was some initial discomfort and it is absolutely neccesary to use strong sun protection and moisturizer. I have been using the product for about four months.  Overall I am very pleased.  However it is extremely drying and I have experienced headaches which I believe are associated with dehydration.  I think has something to do with my age.  I'm all dried up anyway. Ha ha.  I have found that it really helps to drink a ton of water which is also good for the skin.,F,43,4  months,11/28/2007,Differin

Now_ some red marks from previous zits are still there but they will fade in time....it looks worse at first but after 3 weeks I am seeing improvement_ and the scars are red marks_ not indents_ I think they will fade in time.  Keep using it...the redness and peeling isn't so bad after a couple weeks.

126, 5, Acne Vulgaris (Mild to Moderate),None,I have a lot of patience with retinoids because I used Retin-A for more than 10 years beginning with my late adolescence.  As I've gotten older_ Differin has been a miracle because my skin just can't handle the harshness of Retin-A anymore.  Here's the thing.  Not every retinoid is right for everyone_ but if you're using these products_ you have to use them exactly as directed_ be consistent and patient.  I would NOT recommend starting retinoids within a few weeks or months of a major life event (i.e. wedding)_ because your acne will get worse before it gets better.  I noticed an overall improvement in my skin in 2-3 days_ with a major improvement after using Differin for 6 months.  Judging by my prior experience with these drugs_ it takes app. 1 year to really get the full effect of the retinoid.  Again_ there are different retinoids for different people.

I took Accutane in my early 20s and it worked great_ but the risks and side effects are too high now that I'm wiser.  This is the next best thing.,My doctor told me there was a generic available_ but there isn't!

163, 3, Acne,I am curious to see if anyone else is affected by headaches from using this product.  Years ago I was on Accutane which I believe is similar to differin but taken orally rather than topically.  Accutane caused headaches while I took it.  Since I began applying Differin_ I have noticed a recurrence of headaches.  I have also noticed that I have broken out in areas where Differin is not applied.  That is_ I have used Differin on my face but not on my chest; my chest has broken out while my face has improved.,It has certainly helped where it has been applied.  My skin looks much better and it has caused no real irritation to the skin.  You use a very small amount of the medication which is nice since it is very expensive and most insurance companies do not cover it for those of us suffering from adult acne.,M,37,60  days,7/19/2004,Differin
