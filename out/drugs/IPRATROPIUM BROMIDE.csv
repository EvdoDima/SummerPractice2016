0, 4, chronic rhinitis,dizziness_ a little nausea_ dry nose_ not serious enough to stop using it.,Helped my symptoms from the first use.  I tried EVERY nasal spray out there but I always suffered from a post nasal drip and severe congestion and I was miserable.  This is the first one that actually cleared up my nose.  I got to stop taking my Stahist (which was making me very anxious and giving me insomnia) because this adequately relieved my symptoms!,F,24,7  days,8/24/2007,Ipratropium bromide
