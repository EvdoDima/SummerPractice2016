1, 1, sacroiliac joint pain,The doctor gave these with lansoprazole.  Took one in the morning. By mid afternoon I was able to walk with an aid_  but only to the toilet as by this time I had severe diarrhea. Took a whole box of immodium to try and stop it to no effect.  Took one more dose of naproxen. Back to the loo for a few more hours! It was great being able to walk_ however not much good if the only place you can walk to is the toilet. !!,,F,50,1  days500 2X D,5/25/2016,Naprosyn
2, 1, Arthritis,Severe chest pains_ headaches_ lightheaded_ indigestion_ belching_ ringing in ears_ anxiety_ extreme tiredness_ constipation_ extreme tightness in chest.,Stopped taking the drug after third day as the inflammation to my right knee had gone away. Then began to suffer with the symptoms described. Pain in chest progressively got worse over the next few days_ eventually ended up in A&E with a suspected heart attack! I am now nine days on from taking them and things are still not right. Still got most of the symptoms but they have begun to ease. It was only after going to hospital that I began to wonder if Naproxen might be the cause_ and after reading on the web about all the side effects I am now convinced that this is the cause. I am now waiting to see if and how long it will take for my body to recover_ reading some of the comments from other users_ I am very worried that some of them might be permanent.,M,61,3  days500mg 2X D,3/20/2016,Naprosyn

19, 1, Anti-inflammatory for joints,Severe stomach cramping_ diarrhea_ muscle and joint aches_ dull ache and occasional sharp pain in upper abdomen.,"The doctor_ aka Pharmaceutical drug whore_ pushed this drug on me to help resolve some mild inflammation issues. I almost immediately experienced all of the problems listed. I stopped taking it after 2 weeks and never returned to the doctor again. I went to a new doc because this did soo much damage to my stomach in 2 weeks that it gave me an ulcer. The new doc said it was an ""allergic reaction"". lol. This was a wake up call for me. I am now only using Eastern_ natural medicines for my body. Since going all natural_ I fixed my stomach and lost 16 lbs in 1 month. Be aware most Family Doctors are nothing more than the Pharmaceutical companies's drug whores.

24, 3, RA,none (if taken with milk or food) but it wears off and is not sufficient alone; also elevates blood pressure.,It is well known that these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ('NSAIDs'] like naproxen (with the generic familty of names) are not sufficient to deal with RA and must be used with disease modifying anti-arthritis drugs (DMARD's) like methotrexate_ if drugs are to be used. However I have recently discovered natural remedies are superier even if you doctors do not want you to know; such as honey and vinegar and vitamen B complexes. I now consider myself effectively cured at the cost of about $10 per month with nature's solutions and no side effects instead of hundreds for drugs that are promised to eventually wear off.I was also disappointed to discover that this drug is available much cheaper over-the-counter with the name Aleve. If you have complete confidence in the medical profession try reading about Michael Douglas_ Bill Clinton (both whom were misdiagnosed until it was nearly too late) or Dennis Quaid and the service waiting for you at the hospital in high priced America) etc. Aberrations? I think not! Check out Michael Moore's documentaries. Why the skyrocketing autism? Try government 'acceptable' air and water pollution; and cancers_ ADD etc. We are not being told the truth; it's sorta like being told 'everything is fine and go back to the 2nd tower on 9-11; somebody misdirected a plane at tower 1' I make these comments so that hopefully it might save a life like mine!,M,55,18  months500 mg 2X D,9/4/2010Email,Naprosyn
25, 2, Back pain,Gastrointestinal problems. Left a weird_ burning feeling in my throat every time I took a pill.,Naprosyn is crap for pain. Doctors say it works for moderate to severe pain - that is a BUNCH of horse pucky.

30, 2, Prostatitis,Agitation_ insomnia_ skin discomfort,I was prescribed twice daily 500 MG tablets along with CIPRO for Prostatitis.  After a day or so_ I started feeling extremely agitated and could not sleep for three nights.  I also experienced periodic involuntary movements/muscle spasms in my shoulder while trying to sleep.  My doctor suggested eliminating the naproxen and giving it about three days to clear my system.  Sure enough_ the symptoms subsided.  I have since read that some NSAIDs are contraindicated with CIPRO and other Fluoroquinolones due to risk of central nervous system reactions.  I'm not sure if this is what I experienced_ but am just passing along.,M,45,4  days,6/12/2009,Naprosyn

38, 4, Shoulder tendonitus,Extreme drowsiness.,"This drug was not ""supposed"" to make me drowsy_ but it did so I had to take it only at night.  It did not have to necessarily be at bedtime; I could watch TV.  But I couldn't do anything else.  It might not have been just the Naprosyn_ since I was taking Flexeril and Tylenol w/codeine too.  But I had severe pain and partial loss of my range of motion.  These medications were needed so I could do the painful exercises to regain my mobility.  I think I took it about 2 weeks.",F,46,2  weeks,5/24/2008,Naprosyn

43, 1, menstrual cramps/breast pain,None,This was like taking nothing at all.  It didn't touch my cramps or the breast pain that occurs before menstruation.  Taking ibuprofen (which still doesn't eliminate the cramping pain)does more for the cramps than this stuff.  I've taken darvocet in the past for cramps and those actually worked_ I think my doctor is afraid to prescribe them for me though because he is worried I might be a druggie or something.  Maybe naprosyn works for some people_ but this has done NOTHING for me.,F,32,30  days,1/21/2008,Naprosyn

I now weigh in at the heaviest I have ever been in my entire life.  All in all I do not feel that this medication is worth taking.,M,57,2  months,12/12/2007Email,Naprosyn
46, 1, cramps,I developed a stomach ulcer because of this drug.,I used this drug several times a month for over twenty years. It relieved my cramps really well. I now have a ulcer due to this drug.

Go figure.  If you have tendinitis stay away from this drug!  Also check out the findings that elderly patients have a 50 percent higher risk of heart attack when using this drug.

81, 2, chondromalacia patellae,Light headedness_ dizziness_ and drowsiness,I was prescribed this medication because the doctor misdiagnosed my condition by saying I had a dislocated kneecap. This medication is good for arthritic pain but not for a condition like mine. I would take two 500 mg tablets a day and still be in pain. It would provide some relief but not enough to create comfort. I finally got relief when I was diagnosed by a good doctor and put on Vicodin. Not very good in my opinion. If you are suffering from arthritis or mild pain this medication is good_ however for chronic pain I would not recommend it.,M,23,2  months,6/20/2002,Naprosyn
