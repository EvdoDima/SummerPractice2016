1, 1, Allergies_ sinus congestion,Besides Azelastine causing me to have blurry vision_ it made my eyes look like someone who has completely lost her mind. Azelastine_ caused me such embarrassment. Since the first things that people look at are oneÂ’s eyes (face)_ Azelastine disrupted that. Totally preventing me from making that one to one eye contacts with individuals that I come into contact with.,I am very grateful to have come across your site_ helping me to put things into perspective instead of living in limbo. Azelastine is a very serious drug_ having experienced it first hand_ I can definitely attest to it.,F,53,2  years137mcg 1X D,7/8/2014,Azelastine hydrochloride
2, 4, Enviromental Algeries,Bad Taste for about 30 min. after taking the spray_ and sometimes a LITTLE drowsy_ but these are normal ( and listed ) side effects. No Other Side Effects Noted.,"Both I and my 7 year old son take it for our enviromental allergies. I do 2 sprays in each nostril twice a day_ and he does 1 in each nostril twice a day. They have helped both of us to breath more normally. After some research ( and some use )_ I've found this drug to have almost no bad side effects. I tried it from a recommendation from my ENT ( Ear_ Nose_ Throat doctor )_ after having recurring sinus infections every 5 months_ and having to take Albuterol and Flovent 220 ( An Inhaled Steroid ). After charting all the data I found that the cause was that the enviromental allgeries started up and then the Flovent would ""tip the scales"" until I'd end up on BiAxin_ or it would turn into Pneumonia requiring Avelox 400 ( Definately not a drug you want to be on !! ). Since stopping the Flovent and using the Azelastine ( Generic for Astelin )_ I've been feeling great_ and no Penumonia's even 1 year later !!!As for my son_ it has been helping him to breath easier without any side effects but bad taste !!!All-in-all I'd highly recommend this drug to anyone who has bad enviromental allergies_ and is worried about other drugs side effects as we were.",M,41,3  months0.1% -30ML 2X D,1/6/2011Email,Azelastine hydrochloride
