0, 3, Extreme high blood pressure,Horrible charlie horses if I barely moved in my sleep. Would wake me up from a dead sleep. Also developed shoulder pain that makes it hard to sleep on my sides.,I told my docs I didn't want to take HCTZ again and they snuck it in under the name Amiloride. This is the only med that has brought my bp down_ but I'm not sure I can live with pain. It feels like I've torn a rotator cuff now in right shoulder.,F,52,6  months10 mg 1X D,7/4/2016,Amiloride hcl and hydrochlorothiazide
