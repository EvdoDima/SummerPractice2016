0, 3, Acne,Took this drug twice_ the first time I experienced diarrhea anytime I ate chocolate and ended up with yeast infections all the time.  The second time I took it I didn't have the diarrhea but ended up with a horrible yeast infection again that refused to go away.,This drug works wonders for my skin_ it clears it up really fast without drying it.  Overall I was very happy with how it made my skin look but I can't live with continuous yeast infections.  I already seem to be very prone to them_ maybe that's why I get them with this drug_ but whenever I take this I can't seem to get rid of the infection as easily as normal.  I would recommend it to others who suffer from acne (this is the only thing that actually works that good for me) but women who take it need to make sure that they are very careful in regards to the infections.,F,23,3  months,9/15/2008,Trimeth/sulfa
