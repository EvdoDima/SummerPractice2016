0, 5, Allergic Rhinitis_ congestion,Excitability if i do not avoid caffeine also. No side effects as reported by other people. it can raise blood pressure if taken longterm. It helps to go off and on this medicine for a few weeks . off 2 weeks in intervals between when its most needed. I go off it for entire seasons when it's not needed and it still works once it is initiated again.,Safe and more effective than Zyrtec or Claritin.  Non drowsy with or without the decongestant formula.,F,,8  years180 1X D,6/16/2015,Allegra d 24 hour allergy and congestion
1, 1, congestion runny nose and drainage,Really helped my congestion but I noticed after 2-3 days I developed a slight pain around my right kidney which worsened for the next few days. I discontinued the drug on day 7 when I saw another person had the same problem. Its been 3 days now since I stopped taking it and pain is still there . I saw someone else posted that it takes a week to leave your system so maybe it'll stop soon. Had a urine test today that showed no infection.,,F,50,7  days180,4/7/2015Email,Allegra d 24 hour allergy and congestion
2, 1, Allergies,Extreme Anxiety,I normally take things with a grain of salt_ I don't get anxious very often. A day after taking the first dose_ I felt Stessed and Anxious for no reason. I couldn't shake it. I still had allergies and now this horrible side effect. After 3 days of taking the medication_ I looked up the side effects and realized Anxiety was listed_ I stopped taking it. After a  week of feeling extreme anxiety all day and night_ I started thinking maybe it wasn't the medication_ bc it should be out of my system by now. It was really effecting my life. I had a discussion with my husband and we had decided that I would call my doctor and talk about getting on anti-anxiety medication. After a week and a half from the last day I took Allegra_ I started feeling a lot better_ more like myself. I looked up how long Allegra can stay in your system and found that it can remain in your system for over a week. Thank goodness I thought to look that up. This medication may work for some without side effects_ but if you start feeling anything out of the normal for you_ stop taking it_ look up side effects and how long it remains in your system.,F,34,3  days 1X D,8/18/2014Email,Allegra d 24 hour allergy and congestion

4, 4, Seasonal Allergies,Weird dreams,_ yep you heard it right. Last year I took allegra and I didn't have any side effects and it worked great! This year I took zyrtec for a while and then realized I had stopped taking it last year because it didn't work. I took Zyrtec from age 6-13 from serum_ to pill_ when it was prescription to over the counter pills and it started to lose lots of the effect it used to have. I then started taking allegra and it was a miracle to me. My allergies were the best they had been since I'd really developed them. Started taking Zyrtec this year then discovered it didn't work so I took an emergency run to wal-mart last night to pick up some allegra and took it last night. last night's dream was fine_ in fact I didn't even have one but i took a nap at around 11-11:30ish and slept very very lightly and had a strange dream that I almost controlled but was twisted a bit by my brain. it was rather odd as the subject changed many times_ and I was insane in pretty much all of it. it was actually rather entertaining and I'll have a great load of fun telliing it to my friends lol. this isn't really a bothering side effect for me but some may have nightmares rather than just strange dreams_ which may be disruptive or disturbing.,F,15,1  daysNot sure 1X D,4/4/2012Email,Allegra d 24 hour allergy and congestion
5, 5, seasonal allergies,Absolutely no side effects that I am aware of,I used to get shots_then eventually allegra twice daily and finally Allegra D 24 hrs.When I think _how I used to suffer with the itchy eyes_headaches_running nose_even while sleeping...I have been thrilled with this medication !!If the spring season is worse on rare occasion days _I take 1/2 of a 25mg Benadryl tablet_ with good results.So glad it is an OTC med now_ as it is less expensive for me_and I can buy it ahead of time during sales and using coupons. I recommend it!     Patti,F,55,12  years80 1X D,3/25/2012,Allegra d 24 hour allergy and congestion

9, 3, Allergies,Drowsiness. Dry mouth.,I have no official complaints about Allegra D. I was taking it when you still need a prescription and the only problem I had was that the pill was giant!

13, 1, allergies and congestion,Allergra D changed my menstrual cycles. My periods were only 2-3 days long for most of my adult life. I was in my late 30's when I started taking it. I thought I might be in perimenapause. Over the 4 years of my taking it my periods grew to be 8-10 days long: a bright cranberry-red color. I would even bleed when I wasn't on my period during sex. I was getting worried and I was about to have an endrometrial ablation. But_ I happened across this site and found someone else had a similar experience. I stopped taking it right away and I had a normal - 3 day long menstruation the following month. I'm trying Claritin D now. I've heard it doesn't have this side effect.,I just found out the FDA approved of this med being offered OTC this month.
