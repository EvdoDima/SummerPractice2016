0, 1, Over active bladder,Dry mouth. Blurred vision_ foggy brain_ feeling sick and cold like symptoms.,I had to stop this medication as it dried my mouth out that much it left sores all in my mouth and my tongue swoll up. Felt depressed and the foggy brain was awful. Confusion and problems with my memory as well as head aches. I wish the doctor had of explained these side effects before hand. Haven't took a tablet in 4 days and I feel loads better already and my mouth has cleared up and appetite slowly returning. If you are like me and get side affects from tables don't take these.,F,31,3  weeks5mg,6/21/2016Email,Vesicare
1, 3, DSD from Multiple Sclerosis,It snook up on me_ first brilliant_ then constipation of epic proportions for which I needed weekly enemas_ Blurred vision gradually worsening_ and then headaches started after 3 months.,I wish this had worked. As the side effects got worse the efficacy of the drug reduced. I had some major incontinent episodes. Constipation that stopped me wanting to eat because of nausea_ and vomiting.Blurred vision that changed my glass prescription significantly_ dry mouth - drank so much water all the time_ but the headaches which started last month are too much to bear_ so I am having Botox next week.,F,46,4  months5mg 1X D,6/17/2016,Vesicare
2, 2, OAB,At first_ I did not experience any side effects_ and this was the only medicine that helped my OAB. This was very effective in curing my OAB which had been severe prior to me using this medication_ and other medications did not work at all. However_ over the past year_ I have started to have memory issues and word recall issues and am only 30 years old. I wasn't sure what could be causing this_ but I recently read an article that this medication can cause dementia/ memory loss.  I have stopped taking it immediately and am looking for other options. I hope the memory problems stop but am not optimistic (given what I have read). I wish I would have had this information initially as I never would have taken this.,,F,30,4  years10,6/7/2016Email,Vesicare
3, 4, Overactive Bladder,At first I developed I have a rash across my chest and then a week later across my forehead. Not sure if it is an allergic reaction. I've never had these issues until I took this medication. Ocassional blurry vision.,Overall it works and I don't have to run to the restroom every 10 to 15 minutes. But with the rashes_ I may have to discontinue.,F,37,2  weeks5mg,6/3/2016,Vesicare
4, 1, Overactive Bladder with pain,Although Vesicare did stop the bladder pain it did not stop me from running to the bathroom 15-20 times in a 24 hour period. Within 48 hours of starting this medicine I saw swelling in my knees_ legs_ thighs_ feet_ ankles_ arms_ and hands. I stopped taking it three days ago and I've noticed that my lips and face are now swollen. This is really scary!,I'm really happy for those that are having great success with Vesicare_ but for me this is a nightmare.,F,43,6  days5 MG,5/12/2016,Vesicare

6, 5, Over active bladder,Just a dry mouth,Having had bladder and bowel prolapse repair surgery I was at my wits end with the need to urinate so frequently.I was waking at least 5 times a night for a wee and my life was affected during the day by the need to be near a toilet.I no longer have the urgency to wee and I have a life!,F,60,30  days5mg 1X D,3/20/2016,Vesicare
7, 1, Urge Incontinence,Although the medication helped initially_ the side effects were unbearable. Increasingly alarming blurred and double vision_ dry mouth_ dry eyes_ dry skin_ extremely chapped lips_ headaches_ memory issues_ constipation. After eye exams_ the opthalmologist expressed concerns with some shadowy places on my eyes_ as well as my complaints about recent blurry vision. I stopped taking the medication and hope that my eye issues can be resolved.,This medication produced unbearable side effects. Initially dry mouth and eyes_ constipation_ headaches_ progressed into memory issues_ unbearable dry lips and skin_ blurry and double vision. Finally_ after eye exams when the doctor expressed concern about some showy place in eyes_ I did more research and discontinued this medicine. It is horrible and should be reevaluated. Perhaps because the majority of people taking this medicine are women_ drug companies think complaints of side effects are insignificant.,F,63,2  months10 mg 1X D,2/17/2016,Vesicare

9, 2, Overactive bladder,Dry mouth fatigue dry eyes,I initially took 5mg but they did not stop my overactive bladder..there were no side effects with 5mg.  My gp started me on 10mg. This is my third day on 10mg and I have side effects as described above plus now my breathing seems to be affected. I dont feel good so will not be taking anymore of the 10mg. My gp will probably say to give it a bit longer but I dont think I can tolerate the adverse side effects. I will go back on 5mg because the vesicare eased the pain I had in my pelvic/bladder region.,F,64,9  days5mg & 10mg,12/9/2015,Vesicare
10, 1, Overactive Bladder,Extremely nauseous_ headaches and migraines_ extreme dry mouth_ excessive thirst_ dizziness_ more tired than usual_ dry eyes_ dry sinuses_ vivid and terrifying nightmares.,I tried it thinking it was a bladder med. What could go wrong. Didn't research. BIG mistake. Am stopping this drug immediately even though it has been nice not to have to use the restroom continually. It just isn't worth the side effects. And I am terrified to go to sleep.,F,51,1  months10mg,11/6/2015,Vesicare

Very graspy memory_ headache_ kidney ache_ bladder contraction pain_ sore dry throat_ fatigue_ dry skin_ dry eyes_ reduced perspiration. I could go on....,I would avoid this like the plague_ I would rather the inconvenience of wearing pads and the frequent toilet visits than to stay on this awful medication a day longer,F,47,6  weeks5mg 1X D,10/12/2015,Vesicare
13, 5, OAB_ urgency,Really none if taken with food,It is the best drug that I have tried for the pesky need to urinate suddenly and immediately. (Others were: Detrol LA_ and oxybutinine (or something like that) Both did not help at all and I could not hold my pee. Vesicare is extremely helpful and has not lost its effectiveness like the Detrol did after about a year.,F,47,3  years,10/7/2015,Vesicare

15, 1, Bladder spasms,Flu like symptoms_ dry mouth_ headaches_ mental confusion_ lethargy_ dry eyes and blurred vision,I have polycystic kidney disease and kidney stones.  My urologist initially put me on 5 mg. of Vesicare to control bladder spasms and then increased it to 10 mg.  I would rather have the pain of bladder spasms than constantly feeling like I've  got the flu and mental confusion.  Over the weekend I finally looked at side effects of Vesicare.  I called my pharmacist and she said to stop taking drug immediately and call urologist first thing Monday morning.  Having surgery on Thursday.,F,53,6  weeks10 1X D,8/29/2015,Vesicare

Mostly worried about my vision_ which was compromised before the med...and also the confusion.  Want off this stuff.  Will tolerate it a few more weeks_ when I see specialist again.  Physiotherapy doesn't help either.,Was on Detrol first but didn't help at all.  Only one side effect of dry mouth with that med.  Then saw specialist who switched me to Vesicare.  Helps...a little.  Side effects nasty.  Worst side effect now gone....that is constipation and intense abdominal pain.  Had to tolerate that for 3 weeks_ before it went away.  Hopefully specialist has a third option I can try.  Otherwise_ I will just live with it rather than be on med.,F,51,3.5  months10mg 1X D,7/6/2015,Vesicare
18, 1, Urgent and frequent urination.,Muscular weakness and cramps.  Feelings of agitation. Dizziness.  Fatigue. Blurred vision.,Whatever the positive values of Vesicare may offer_ the offsetting negative side effects more than cancel them out.  A very powerful drug that can cause more harm than good in those who are sensitive to it.  In my opinion_ it would be prudent for the FDA to reevaluate the efficacy and dangers of Vesicare_ and_ perhaps_ order another set of studies before continuing to permit its widespread distribution.,M,74,6  weeks10 MG 1X D,6/26/2015,Vesicare

20, 1, To alleviate frequency and urgency.,extreme dry mouth. blurry vision in one eye. erectile dysfunction.,This seems to be a very dangerous and toxic drug. The side effects are extensive and intensive. I would not recommend that anyone take this pharmaceutical without doing a great deal of research first.,M,72,4  weeks10 MG,6/24/2015,Vesicare
21, 1, Overactive Bladder,I went on Vesicare because I was going to the bathroom 12-18 times a day.  It did elevate that issue.  I started stumbling over words_ grasping for thoughts & I had hair loss.  I had no idea that Vesicare was linked to memory loss until today.  I also developed pelvic floor weakness.  I will not continue to take this medicine & I plan to make a report to the FDA.,All bladder control drugs can have memory loss.  Please research any medicine your doctor prescribes to you.  I didn't realize that this could happen to me.,F,45,1  years5 MG 1X D,4/8/2015,Vesicare

23, 4, Overactive bladder_ nocturia,Mild nausea_ low mood_ blurry vision,It took a few weeks for my body to get used to this drug. I find taking it before bed is best time. Definitely helps in that I take less trips to loo during night and day. Still get leakages when sneezing / coughing sometimes. Overall_ drug has been worth taking. Currently contemplating come off for a while as nausea an issue_ what with still having to work.,F,61,3  years5mg od,3/14/2015Email,Vesicare
24, 1, Overactive blader,It helped BUT I stopped taking it after coming across a researches study that Vesicare builds up in the body & can lead to major memory impairment that appears to be irreversible. Then I looked at all the foods labels I had been buying & found they were loaded with salt. Reduced my salt intake to more more than 1_000 mg per day. Frequency now under control. You can add Benbedryl to your list of drugs that build up in the body and acerbate memory loss. Big Pharma won't tell you this stuff_ & your doctor probably doesn't know about the dangers.,,F,55,8  months10 2X D,2/20/2015Email,Vesicare

I have had cancer and I have been through worse.  A dry mouth is helped by a teaspoon if coconut oil swirled in my mouth and spit it out before going to bed.

42, 1, OAB,Next to chemo- one of the worst meds I've taken! Disappointing- I had high hopes for this drug but instead of alleviating my bladder problems it produced more.I can't wait for it to leave my system_ I've never been thirstier. I feel like someone shoved a fist full of sand down my throat. Now I really appreciate the doctor giving me samples instead of the hassle & expense of the Rx. My eyes are so dry & I'm so exhausted. I actually feel like I smoked a joint w/o any of the fun benefits. I could drink a gallon of water & not quench my thirst. Why would they put this Rx on the market. I wish they would require pharm reps to try their own samples.  This Rx should be reconsidered for sale.,,F,39,3  days5 mg,1/12/2012,Vesicare
43, 1, Overactive Bladder,Severe dry mouth_ dry eyes_ violent headaches and excruciating right eye pain and photo-phobia that would last for days.  Stopped taking it on a regular basis after 6 weeks due to awful side effects. During that 6 week period I was taking the drug only 3 to 4 times a week due to the side effects. I am already on a lot of medications that dry out my mouth and they are destroying my teeth. With the addition of Vesicare my dentist is frightened I will have a mouth full of cavities and risk losing my teeth.  DRY MOUTH IS THE WORSE THING FOR CAUSING CAVITY PRODUCTION!!!! My Pharmacist told me to stop and get an ophthalmology appt. ASAP!,As a Registered nurse who is a specialist in bladder care I have never seen or experienced a drug that had such awful side effects and symptoms in my 30 year career.I quit taking the drug as i was terrified of glaucoma_vascular disease and a mouth full of cavities.  I am having to have Veneer's placed on my front teeth due dry mouth.  I had to buy prescription tooth paste and all biotene products for dry mouth.FDA needs to pull this drug until more research is done and they have done more clinical trials. It is worth being incontinent instead of risking your health and possibly your sight.  Write to the FDA to have this drug pulled off the market.  The worst thing is my urologist did know patient education.,F,55,6  weeks5 mg. 1X D,12/18/2011Email,Vesicare

The side effects were horrible_ I have stopped taking them. I have 5 months before they take the stent out. This medication has so many side effects.,,F,43,3  days,12/6/2011Email,Vesicare
45, 5, Overactive bladder,I first started on Detrol LA and was having severe drymouth and heart palpitations. I was then taken off those and put on vesicare. I've been on it for 3 weeks now_ side effect free. The first few days I had it_ I noticed drymouth and dry eyes again_ pretty bad but subsided after 3 days or so. No other side effects to report_ and now I pee 2 times a day instead of the usual 30. Its a tad more expensive than Detrol la_ but with no side effects after my body adjusted to the pills_ vesicare is where I'm staying. :),,F,24,3  weeks5mgs,11/30/2011Email,Vesicare

47, 5, bladder spasms,Just takes a long time to pee. I feel like I am sitting on the toilet for hours.,I really like to way it works. I don't have to run to the toilet every 30 minutes. It also took away the spasms I was having in my bladder. I have IBS so I guess bladder spasms go with the IBS. I really like it when I go places like shopping_ eating out because I don't have to go as much. I used to hate that. I had to be near a bathroom no matter where I went.,,40,2  years5 mg 1X D,11/29/2010Email,Vesicare
48, 1, overactive bladder,I was given samples of this drug by my gynecologist for overactive bladder. I asked her if it would interact with my rythmal I take for heart arrythmias. She said that she didn't think so. I took one pill after I left her office. I got home and did some research and found that if you have any electrical problems in your heart and problems with QT waves_ that you should not take it. The next morning_ my pulse was 130 after I just got out of bed. I have taken two cardazam pills as my rescue pill and I am still having up and down heart rate. I would not take this drug again no matter what!!,,F,48,1  days5 mg 1X D,8/13/2010,Vesicare
49, 2, Urgent Bladder,My upper sinuses were as DRY as the Mohave Desert.  Every time I inhaled through my nose I felt a blinding electrical SHOCK-like pain behind my eyes - OUCH !,I started on Enablex and that gave me a dried out feeling in my sinuses (come to find out - a MILD dried out feeling)_ but it helped my urgent bladder.  So my doctor had me try Vesicare. OH MY GOD - OUCH. It was like electrical charges going off behind my eyes when I inhaled. I was SOOOO dried out it felt like every nerve in my upper sinuses was exposed. I couldn't standit. So I went back to Enablex - and compared to Vesicare - Enablex was easy to live with (and it worked).,F,52,2  weeksLowest 1X D,7/27/2010,Vesicare

52, 1, Bladder control,Horrible headaches.  Severe eye pain.  Double vision & blurry vision_ night blindness by headlights and any lights.  BAD MEDICATION!,After months of thinking my eyes were getting bad and going to the eye dr & a sinus dr - - I finally heard a bit on a commercial about it affecting eyes & causing headaches - - I recalled the dr saying possible side effects are glaucoma_ eye pressure_ eye pain... at the time I wondered what eye pressure & eye pain could feel like... it took me a while to figure out that is what it was.  Since there are VERY LIMITED reviews/ patients on this medication there's not much info out there on it. It was a horrible medication! (It helped with slow bladder leak but didn't control sneezing/coughing bladder issues. I liked what it did help - - but I'd rather SEE & pee than take this med - LOL). I quit taking it 5 days ago & still have headaches & eye pain - the blurred vision and double vision went away within 2 days...  anyone else??????,F,42,5  months5 mg 1X D,3/2/2010Email,Vesicare
53, 1, bladder control,swelling_ caused angio-edema (Anaphylactic reaction) which made my lips_ tongue_ and throat swell where I could not breathe. I had taken a pill before going to sleep_ and the doctors said if I had not had a phone call that woke me up_ I would have died in my sleep. I was admitted to hospital for 3 days.,"I would NEVER want someone to take this med. It was given as a sample by a urologist. If I had researched the internet I would have seen (example WebMD and other sites) ""Some side effects with VESICARE_ while occurring infrequently_ are potentially serious and should be reported immediately to your healthcare provider. These include but are not limited to: Severe constipation_ Worsening of glaucoma_ Difficulty passing urine_ Confusion_ Depression_ Signs of an allergic reaction_ such as unexplained rash_ hives_ itching_ wheezing_ and unexplained swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat)_ severe dizziness_ trouble breathing.""
