1, 1, Bacterial throat infection,Voracious hunger pangs that could not be sated_ mild stomach cramps_ flatulence,"About two hours after taking the second pill (with a large dinner at about 8pm) I started to get incredible waves of hunger pangs throughout the evening_ lasting until about 2am.  I tried having a bowl of cereal at about midnight but this did nothing and they continued_ growing in intensity_ finally leaving me squirming_ sweating in bed and swearing quietly. The next day after taking 3 more I got to about 5pm_ having had a the same intense hunger pangs and gut rumblings all day_ which ended up bordering on stomach cramps.  I stopped taking them at this point having read some of the reviews here and contacted my doc who said they were a ""gut rotter"" and suggested clarithromycin. I saw a review somewhere else which tagged erythromycin as ""gut wrenching germ-buster"" which is so apt I nearly spat my seventh bowl of cereal all over my laptop.Needless to say_ ask if there's an alternative because this stuff is serious.  I got off lightly looking at some of the other reviews here and I'm thankful I looked.",M,34,2  days500 MG 4X D,2/4/2010,Erythrocin stearate
2, 5, Dental Infection.,I failed to read the little waring label on the side so a stomach upset is constant wothout food. it didn't flair up until 24 hours after taking the second pill.,I slept on my side to keep the cramps down. You must take it with a fairly large meal to avoid the cramps.,M,38,32  days,8/24/2005,Erythrocin stearate
