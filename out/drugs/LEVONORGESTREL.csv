0, 1, Emergency contraception,Horrific - Over the course of four months_ I gained 27 pounds.  This weight was largely all in my hips and thighs_ and was cottage-cheese-like cellulite. I had not changed my activity level or eating habits whatsoever (I eat a spartan_ gluten-free diet). It's a year later and I still have not been able to take off the weight. Additionally_ I have a high SHBG level.  It remains high at 250!  This is one year - ONE YEAR - after I took the Plan B pill.  Don't let anyone tell you this stuff leaves your system quickly.  It lingers forever.,,F,41,1  times1.5 MG 1X D,3/21/2015,Levonorgestrel
