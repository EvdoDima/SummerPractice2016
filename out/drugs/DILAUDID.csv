0, 5, Tonsillectomy,This is by far the best pain med out there. Pain went from like 10 to zero in minutes _ it's amazing! Not happy that the doctor only gave me such a small dose of it. I was taking Tylenol with codeine for the pain at first and it did NOTHING! All in all great pain med despite all the side effects.,My side effects: Drowsy_insomnia_ nausea_ hallucinations,F,41,1  days1mg oral l,7/13/2016Email,Dilaudid
1, 5, After spinal surgery,No side effects,The best post operative pain reliever I have ever experienced after major surgery . I was first on morphine and it felt like they were still inside of me working . I asked them to please change it to delaudid because I had experience with it three times before . My pain level went from 10 to zero in seconds,F,64,3  days? 6X AN,7/2/2016,Dilaudid
2, 4, Chronic low back pain_ post surgery,Constipation_ more then likely due to surgery and amount of hydrocodone taken trying to relieve pain.,I've had chronic low back pain since I turned 20. I was having to take hydrocodone everyday to get through work. By the time I turned 24 I was taking 10's. Over this year it's began to not work as wel and after I just had surgery to remove cysts from both ovaries the surgeon told me that I may have to take two 10's being I've been on it since I was 18_ that I may have a hard time managing the pain. He was both right_ and wrong. Taking two 10's didn't help with the pain at all. On Wednesday the day after surgery I couldn't take it anymore and he prescribed me hydromorphone 4mg tablets to take every six hours. Being i was already constipated_ it helped some but hardly took the edge off_ after finally going to the bathroom there's been a bit more improvement but still painful. I'm not an abuser of any medication but I've been tempted to take two to see if it helps more with relieving the pain. My pain level on a scale of 1-10_ I'm currently at an 8/9 the lowest I've reached is about a 7. Better then the 12/13 hysterical level I was at this morning. Any advice is much appreciated from other chronic pain suffers. I think this would be a better medication for me then the Vicodin as even on a bad day taking two tens does nothing anymore.,F,28,3  days4mg,5/27/2016Email,Dilaudid

4, 5, stomach obstruction,None,This drug is a miracle. I have been in the hospital 3 weeks for a stomach obstruction & I grind my teeth too_ my tooth broke from having vitamin deficiency for so long. This medicine has helped for both issues_ helps to calm my achy body_ & helps my pain for longer than hydrocodone. Not everyone feels this way_ but everyone is different.

10, 3, back pain,The medication helped only a little bit. The problem was that I had to take so much oral to work and it didn't last that long.  The long acting dialiud is worthless. I was taking 2Ã— 32mg a day. The I.R was better relief then the E.R. Anyway I was a little tired and had weird dreams.,Me and my doctor honestly thought that going from oxycodone to Dialiud would work better because it's much stronger.  That's always not the case. I know everyone is different but after reading so many others response to dialiud_  I was surprised to what I read.  So many others though the Samething as me.  That dialiud's half life was very poor and that it really didn't help with the pain compared to oxycodone.  The I.V dialiud was so much more effective and I didn't need a much.  Compared to the 32mg oral I was taking.  I only needed 8 mg of I.V to equal that.  I wish they could formulate the oral like the I.V. It would really be a great pain medication if they could do that.  But the half life is crap and it also has low Bio.,M,46,5  weeks32,6/29/2015,Dilaudid

15, 5, migraines_ post op pain_ iv in er,First time I had this was after my hysterectomy_ nurse pushed it way too fast and almost stopped my heart. I usuallyget this in IV form in the ER for migraines that last weeks. I always make sure they give me the anti-nausea meds first to stop any vomiting and headache nausea. I get compozine_ dilauded_ toradol_ and benadryl (in that order) and the headache stops immediately. The cocktail makes me very tired_ but sleep is best for migraines anyway. The benadryl helps with the itching_ too.,I have so many drug allergies that finding a cocktail that works is a miracle. I just wish drs would stop treating me like an addict because I ask for what works and what I'm not allergic too.  I have a great neuro that closely monitors my meds just to prevent addiction.  I've tried occipital nerve blocks and many other treatments. Can't afford Botox.  Will stick with what works.,F,44,  1X D,5/5/2015,Dilaudid

18, 4, Severe digital ulcers - Scleroderma,none,My ulcer on my first finger was excruciating_ to the point where I asked my doc to chop off my finger. She wisely suggested we get the pain under control before such a drastic measure. She prescribed Dilaudid 4mg every 4 hours. At first_ after researching on the net_ I was reluctant to take it so I only took half the prescription (2mgs). While the pain lessened it was not under control. Pharmacist kindly reinforced the need to take meds as prescribed (4mgs). Pain now under control as long as I do not skip doses. Wound clinic suggests I take the meds before coming in for next treatment. I will. For my severe pain_ so far this medicine works. I will only be using the meds short term_ hopefully I'll not have withdrawal symptoms as described_ but if so_ so be it.,F,47,6  days4mg,2/7/2015Email,Dilaudid

I slept for most of the next 48 hours. 4 days later I am having stomach cramps_ constipation_ goosebumps_ nausea_ tremors. I haven't taken anything else so I assume these are side effects as well.

22, 4, gallbladder,Hospitalized for gallstone blocking liver duct_ which resulted in jaundice and infection of the gallbladder_ and start of pancreatitis. Once admitted from er_ doctor only gave me half the recommended dose of 2 mg. Relieved my pain_ but would give me huge head rush when administered. Also had sever itching_ but was most likely caused by the jaundice since I was already itching.. Next day_ the new doctor put me on the full 2 mg dose to ensure pain management. Within 10 seconds of the full dose being administered_ I was doubled over in horrible pain from back spasms. This would only last for about a minute_ but happened with each dose_ so I was given a dose of valium beforehand. Never heard of pain meds CAUSING pain. BUT.... once the spasms stopped_ my pain was relieved. Some nausea_ but was on Iv anti nausea meds. I give it a higher rating because it did make the pain go away until they were able to get my surgery done. Everyone reacts differently with meds_ I guess I just have a weird reaction.

Some areas of severe pain on my neck went away but other areas on my neck were still there full force just as before. The symptoms all lasted until the medicine finally wore off. I could actually feel when it was wearing off. I will never allow this in my body again_ I have never in my life felt as much pain as I did when I went in the hospital that day_ and when I left I still had the pain and all of the symptoms above to go along with it.

I had a PCA pump for the spinal surgery and was only on Dilaudid about 12 hours or so. I wish I'd been able to do that with the hysterectomy--I had to call and request it_ which meant I was already in a lot of pain by the time someone got there. They only allowed 3 doses over a 24 hour period_ which wasn't sufficient. For post-op pain_ this is the best thing I've had. However_ I know it doesn't work well for everyone--sorry about that and hope you can find something that does.,F,46,2  days 3X D,12/17/2013,Dilaudid

Once the pain pump was implanted and I starting the Dilaudid my life totally changed. Was able to go back to work and do things with my family again. Still can't lift or do any physical things but my quality of life improved so much. That's why this inching concerns me now.

60, 4, ER visit - back_ ER visit - knee,"First time I was administered this was after I threw my back out in 1998. I was breastfeeding my 4 month old daughter at the time and rolled over while in a side laying position to adjust. The pain I had was unbearable sitting_ standing_ laying down. I was admitted and given this through IV and the relief was instant. It would make me fall asleep mid sentence though LOL. Since I was a mother of 5_ and they had kept me over a week_ I asked for a pill form so I could go home even though the pain had not subsided with physical therapy. They gave me Vicodin but that made the room spin_ it was a completely different side effect to the sluggishness I felt with dilaudid IV. The second time I had dilaudid was for my knee yesterday. I have arthritis and my miniscous is gone so I was in extreme pain from my knee joints being bone on bone. I was overdosing on ibuprofen to no avail so having had the dilaudid work well 12 years ago I was relieved they were going to administer this for relief. It was a different experience though. I felt immediate mild pain as it rushed through every vein in my body_ not excruciating_ but irritating. I also felt like I was going to vomit_ but attributed that to not having eaten for 9 hours also. Crackers helped with the nausea. Also the same sluggish or drugged up feeling as before_ but oddly the pain relief was not the same. The prior back pain went from a 9 to complete relief_ but the knee pain went from 7 to maybe a 4.

The subcutaneous administration_ which was suggested by the nurse and approved by the treating doctor_ was an excellent choice for extended pain control.  Was able to sleep comfortably at home and managed to make it into the urologist's office the next morning with minimal residual pain.

I was in an auto accident about five months ago and got a mild TBI and have had severe ongoing migraines ever since even though I'd never had a migraine before in my entire life! They are completely debilitating. I had to go to the ER because it got so bad (they'd been this bad before_ but my cognitive functioning had not returned enough to allow me to be able to recognize that I needed to go to the ER before this point to reduce the pain... I know it sounds strange_ TBI is a strange way of living.) the dilaudid cut the 8 level pain to a 4 level pain within minutes and then down to a 3 after that. I did not get or feel high whch was my number one concern with taking it. They administered it by injection I guess and if I am in that level of pain again I would not turn it away.  My biggest disappointment with it is that the doctor suggested that it might stop the headache altogether_ which it did not_ but it reduced it for several hours and I was able to sleep for most of the day. A full_ deep kind of sleep that I felt I hadn't had in months-since the accident occurred most likely.

I was first given Dilaudid in 2007 for what turned out to be a pulled chest muscle (thought I was having a heart attack) after the ER doctor discovered I was opioid-tolerant (I take MSContin for a chronic pain condition).  1 unit was all it took to knock me for a loop_ then knock my pain from 8-pushing-9 to 3-pulling-2.  Ever since_ if an ER doc asks ""what works for you when you have high pain levels?""_ I have no hesitation saying ""a unit of Dilaudid"".  In an IV_ it's a VERY fast-acting med--I can always tell when it's gone in because I can feel it spreading through my body; that's how dramatic the pain relief is.  If you're what ER docs sometimes call ""narcotic-naive"" (that is_ you don't take a lot of opiate-based meds and/or seldom take any kind of strong painkiller)_ Dilaudid might be a bit much for you (I watched a narcotic-naive woman go completely unresponsive after a single dose before coming back around once the initial shock of the drug faded).   don't know if I could ever take it as a regular maintenance medication like some people here_ but as a method for stopping immediate pain_ there's almost nothing better.",F,46,10  times1 mg 1X O,5/28/2010,Dilaudid

116, 4, Breakthrough pain,Itching.  Uncomfortable itching on my back and head.,I've been taking meds for pain for a couple years now and my doctor wanted me to try Dilaudid for the breakthrough pain for a change to vary the meds so I didn't build up a resistance to Vicodin.  Dilaudid works fine.  About the same as Vicodin.  But after a week or so I realized that when I needed two pills (my dose is a 4mg tab) I had a really uncomfortable itching.  Not a real big deal_ I can control that with Benadryl but that makes me drowsey and kind of messes with my plans for the day.  So for pain it works fine but I'm switching back to Vicodin at my next monthly appointment.,F,60,1  months,12/28/2009Email,Dilaudid
117, 4, Chronic Back Pain,slight dizziness,I was having chronic back pain caused by a herniated disk pressing against my sciatica nerve to the point I was bedridden till surgery. Until the surgery_ they gave me Morphine and it wasn't working well. Then they gave me Dilaudid. It worked very well but didn't last long. Only last 2 hours. They also gave it to me post surgery.,F,34,5  days,12/23/2009,Dilaudid
118, 4, Kidney Stone,Nausea - bad_ I went into the ER for a kidney stone. I went in on a pain level of a 6 out of 10. When the level got to a 7 I was given morphine IV. About 1/2 hr later the pain got to a 10/10. I was then gicne a mixture of morhine and 1mb Dilaudid and within 5 minutes the pain went to a 3. Another hr later the pain was creeping up to a 7 and I got another 1mg of Diludid and with in 1/2 hr the pain was gone. All was fine until I tried to stand up and get off the bed. The room started to spin_ a wave of nausea set it in_ and I had the through up but had nothing in my stomach. I got a taxi home and spent from 8:30 am to 8PM in bed not being able to lift my head due to getting nausea. I then found a prescription I had for nausea. took that and about an hr later was finally able to sit up long enough to watch somne tv for 2 hrs and then back to bed.,I tool the pain away_ but the nausea was alot for me. However armed with the knowledge I can take something for the nausea I would take Diladid again,M,47,2  times,11/30/2009,Dilaudid

120, 5, Laminectomy and Failed Laminectomy,Constipation. Vivid dreams.,Was given IV Dilaudid in hospital post op and that was always sufficient for pain relief. After discharge I was switched to 2mg tablets cut in half q4h/prn (1mg) for pain. Again_ the drug was sufficient for breakthrough pain. I am now using Norco and Zanaflex on a regular 4 hour cycle now_ plus Neurontin and Lyrica_ and have found that half of a half tablet_ or half a milligram of Dilaudid will ease the pain away in ten minutes. It's easy to see this drug as being addictive; the euphoria from just 1mg is quite high and the dreams are very pleasant and vivid and that's a good reason for my decision to take the smallest dose. Yes_ it constipates_ but what drug doesn't? It takes the pain away and that's worth everything when pain has you in its clutches.,M,69,4  months,11/4/2009Email,Dilaudid

After taking the med at 10:30 am_ I had extreme nausea when walking around or doing anything --- talking on the phone even made me sick. I slept most of the day until around 6 pm when I got a severe headache. I took 800 mg ibuprofen and it didn't help the headache at all.

I took the Dilaudid about 30 minutes before and it still hurt. I've never been in so much pain. I would have to say that without the pain killer I probably would have passed out.

126, 2, In the ER for prolonged headache,Restlessness_ nausea_ shakiness_ inability to sleep_ lightheadedness_ dizziness_ loss of appetite,I went to the ER as I had been having migraine-like symptoms for a total of eleven days.  After the doctor in the ER again classified it as a classic migraine_ he told me_ EVEN THOUGH my pain was only at a 3 or 4_ that my only option was to be given Dilaudid intravenously if I wanted to get rid of the pain.  I consented_ and within the first few minutes after being given the drug I felt quite strange and uneasy.  My headache did seem to go away_ but the effects I felt afterward were_ to me_ not worth it.  Immediately following_ I could barely move_ and felt like I needed to sleep for a year.  Unable to walk_ I had to be wheeled out of the hospital in a wheelchair_ and I expected to just fall asleep once I got home.  However_ once I got into bed_ I tossed and turned for at least five hours_ completely unable to sleep a wink even though I desperately wanted to.  After finally getting some rest_ when I awoke the next morning_ I felt restless_ anxious_ nauseous_ and I couldn't stop moving my body.  I paced around my apartment the whole day_ and I cannot remember ever feeling quite so terrible in a very long time.  For the amount of pain I had had (which was not severe)_ it was completely unnecessary to give me such a strong medication.  I don't recommend IV Dilaudid unless one has very severe or chronic pain.,F,19,1  times,8/9/2009,Dilaudid

I only take the medication on rare occasions when I am in real pain.,F,86, ,8/8/2009,Dilaudid
128, 5, Kidney Stone,Dry mouth_ dry eyes_ light-headedness_ mild delirium.,Amazing drug.  Did not even know it existed before my hospital visit. Works within minutes when taken by IV (I never took it any other way)_ and you can feel it coursing through your system via a warming sensation.  On a 1-10 scale_ it takes the pain from a 9-10 down to a 0-1 in a matter of seconds once it hits the affected area.  My personal opinion is that the benefits of this drug FAR outweigh the side effects I experienced.  The one unfortunate thing is that the pain relieving effects did not last the length of time between prescribed doses.  I tried to make a point of falling asleep immediately after an injection so as to get as far toward the next dosage time as I could.,M,37,3  days,7/26/2009Email,Dilaudid

Everytime they gave me something it would work for awhile then my body would get use to it and it stop working. I ended up in the hospital again one day and I was in alot of pain and my doctor at the time decided to give me Dilaudid in IV every 3 hrs around the clock. I most tell you_ after a day I felt so much better. My pain level was at about 95% gone. When I needed to beable to rest I was without pain so I could rest. And when I had woke up I realized I had more of my strength again_ after having a condition like mine for so many yrs you cant expected your pain to completely go away. So_ to me 95% is just fine. When I went home I was still taken it_ but by injecting myself(I can't take the pill form). Now I'm looking for a doctor that will start me on it again because I don't have the sameone anymore.

Used in conjunction with MS Contin. I find that it works best for me in the evenings or if needed_ at night_ rather than the Percocet_ which keeps me awake. Optimally_ for me_ I prefer to have both available for breakthrough and manage them to avoid tolerance.

Then on to lung tumor_ bone cancer_ and many other probing test. In the meantime they had to control my pain_ they compared it natural child birth (for about 45 days)First I was given Tylenol and Codeine_did absolutly nothing_ then Morphine_ very little relief_ then came the Dilaudid_ 2 mg into my IV. The releif was almost instant_ I could feel it traveling up my arm_ when it hit my shoulder the pain was completely managable_ also gave me slight euphoria.My stay in the hospital was 6 days before they I was fianly diagnosed correctly.

I weigh 112 and at 5'8"" 2mg every 4 hours SHOULD have knocked me out cold! -it didn't... this medicine goes into the system quickly & leaves it quickly (and when it leaves_ you NOTICE)If you have a very high metabolism I'd recommend that you opt for Percocet since it doesn't seem to fly out of the system!",F,21,2  weeks,5/30/2006,Dilaudid

163, 3, Chronic Back Pain,None,Some relief_ then no relief after about 1 weekWas put on Dilaudid b/c of Percocet tolerance from the last 3 years...  Dilaudid is a clearer pain Rx_ once adjusted to proper dose can be helpful,F,27,10  days,4/15/2006Email,Dilaudid
164, 5, RSD/CRPS/FIBROMYALGIA,I have been on Dilaudid for over eight years and the only side effect has been consitpation_ which two other pain meds I take could also cause it. I try and drink lots and lots of water to keep the constipation at a tolerable level.I have been on so many pain meds for the RSD and to date the Dilaudid (generic form) is the 0NLY ONE THAT TAKES MY PAIN DOWN TO A TOLERABLE LEVEL. I was on Methadone_ a very high dose for the pain and it made me very sick and didn't do anything for my pain.I now take a pretty hefty dose_ down from what it was under a different pain doc_ but it's enough to control my pain_ which is all I care about.When hospitalized_ I also get it in the IV form_ which causes sme itching and nausea_ symptoms I don't get using the oral form. I get no warm feeling_ no feelings of being high_ only pain relief.,I was surprised to find one of the people who commented about getting it for headaches. It doesn't do anything for mine and they have better drugs for Migraine headaches that work within 15 minutes.,F,59,8  years,2/5/2006Email,Dilaudid
165, 5, migraine,was given some in the er for a migraine... wish i could get some to bring home.. my fioricet just does not cut it when my head is splitting....it seems that the drs. do not like giving the stuff for migraines_ but the nurse that was working that night suggested it...,if anyone can get some or knows of a place to get some_ or order some let me know seems like something worth having around the house_ especially since i suffer from migraines.... anyone wants to sell any let me know,F,44,1  days,1/27/2006Email,Dilaudid
166, 2, Extreme pain,At first it seemed to work great_ I had nausea_ constipation_ but I felt no pain.,The trouble with this medication that your system gets use to it and you have to keep increasing it.  I began to have no feelings whatsoever so I quit taking it.  Now I am in pain again and don't know what to do.  But I was beginning to feel like an addict.  Enough was enought. I was up to 16mg a day and floating but if I took less I was in pain.,F,59,1  years,1/18/2006,Dilaudid
167, 5, Breakthrough pain from AS,Dizziness_ warm feeling all over.,I use this maybe once or twice a year when my Norco is unable to make my breakthrough pain from my ankylosing spondilitis manageable again and I am unable to get into my pain dr.

172, 4, Recreation_ menstrual cramps,Extreme Euphoria_ slight nausia but very comfortable. After throwing up_ you feel absolutly amazing. Your body feels like its floating. You get quite itchy but it feels really satisfying to scratch. Amazing dreams and visions.,One of the best drugs i have ever done. VERY ADDICTIVE but one pill can last through the whole night. You become more and more tollerable so your dossage may have to be increased.,M,19,2  months,2/3/2005Email,Dilaudid
173, 4, Stomach pain,Nausea_ vomiting_ severe headache,Had problems with gallstones a couple of years ago and was given 2mg tablets.  The dilaudid did a great job of getting rid of the pain but ended up with a severe headache afterwards (though not as painful as the stones).  I've been still having abdominal pains and have been given dilaudid injections twice_ both times I experience nasty nausea and vomiting.,M,35,2  times,2/1/2005,Dilaudid
174, 4, severe chronic pain disease,nausea_ vomiting_ excessive thirst_ memory loss,I take Dilaudid so I can have some type of quality of life & without it_ I would be in excruciating pain.  I suffer from DDD_ RSD (CRPS) & MS.  Though it allows me to live pain free_ its very hard on my body and mind.  For myself_ the first two hours of absorbtion cause a frenzy talkative stimulated effect_ and Im burning up hot like on a desert.  I also have excessive thirst and hunger.  Even though I take Phenergan with every dose to help the nausea_ I still vomit often. Ive noticed it happens more with increased motion. I have a calmer sense after the first two hours go by. It last about 6-8 hours for me. Sleep?  I can't sleep till it starts wearing off. I also am beginning to have serious memory loss...my dog's name_ my mother's phone number_ what I was doing_ difficult to recall specific words or vocabulary when I _ at one time_ had an extensive vocabalary.  Im forced to choose a simpler elementary word to express myself. I often forget what Im talking about in mid sentence. Ive been told the memory loss from using this drug long term is permanent. Maybe I'll one day forget Im in pain. This drug isn't enjoyable or a high for me. Its only a means to stop the insane pain.  If you dont suffer severe intractable pain_ stay away from Dilaudid.,F,46,2  years,1/27/2005Email,Dilaudid

Long Term; Insomnia_ Constipation-dry stool_ head aches_ No sexual libido&impotence_ Always hot-night sweats_ Memory loss.,When taking Dilaudid_ your sleep will be completely screwed up. If you actually can sleep_ your sleep will be heavy and almost dreamless. Your mind never fully gets proper REM sleep_ making your body feel like it hasn't had a good sleep in along time. Forget about watching movies_ because someone will ask you ten minutes after its over about a certain part_ and you wont remember much at all. After extended use_ you become almost emotionless_where as what used to get you extremely excited_ eg; when your favorite hockey team scores the overtime winning goal- You dont feel any rush of excitement_ or adreniline. The same goes with movies_ or any television you would really enjoy. You watch feeling almost emotionless through the entire thing_when you would normally be excited. And your memory won't be there.

I nonetheless will always recomend this drug should your illness warrant it.  And the threshold of pain for each and everyone of us is different_ so use with caution and be functional again.,M,24,9  years,1/2/2003Email,Dilaudid
