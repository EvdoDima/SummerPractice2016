1, 1, for sinus infection and congestion,Worked good for sinus congestion but nearly felt I was dying by fourth day taking it had full blown panic attack thought I was losing my mind it has been two weeks since stopped taking and still have anxiety everyday er doc told me to give it a month but will never take again and I have anxiety to begin with.,wouldn't recommend for someone with anxiety it will make you worse and will take a long time just to for it to come out of your system,F,29,4  days120 mg,7/7/2016Email,Sudafed 12 hour
2, 1, Hayfever & sinus congestion,Insomnia. Erectile dysfunction (couldn't maintain an erection). Also made me pee a lot after taking it.,It worked and cleared my sinus after only one pill but the side effects are not worth taking this. Took it once_ never again in my lifetime. Considering my medical history my doctor should have never prescribed me a medication that is very likely to cause insomnia (1 in 10 according to the notice). In my case the risk/benefit ratio is strongly against this medication. If you're prone to sleep problems_ anxiety etc. don't take this and look for a safer alternative.,M,43,1  days120 MG 1X D,7/2/2016Email,Sudafed 12 hour

I am a very healthy person normally- exercise_ eat right_ etc.  This is the first time my allergy systems have been this bad- usually just sinus pressure.  But this year (everyone is saying because of mild winter and dry spring this is a very bad allergy year) my one ear was very congested and I was having loss of hearing. So based on coworkers advise I took Sudafed; the pharmacy suggested 24 hr version.  This medicine should be labeled with more warnings!!!!!!!,F,60,8  days240 1X D,6/12/2016,Sudafed 12 hour

10, 1, Congestion,I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE last night after taking Sudafed around 7 PM_ I went to bed at 10  and took a while to get to sleep. I woke near midnight and was feeling tingly all over and the room was spinning. Then my heart palpitations started. It got progressively stronger and stronger until I could only hear my loud_ fast heartbeat and it felt like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest. This feeling lasted a few minutes_ during which I nearly called 911 but didn't. I focused on my breathing and my heart rate came down. For the next 2.5 hours I lay wide awake_ with the racing heart coming and going in waves. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. I will NEVER take pseudoephedrine again. I read on this site that 2 women my age had heart attacks from it. That could have been me. I am feeling very lucky this morning.,The side effects are SO much worse than dealing with a little runny nose or congestion.,F,37,1  days120 mg,3/5/2016,Sudafed 12 hour

27, 3, Nasal congestion or stuffy nostrils,Having hard times falling asleep; giving an uneasy feelings (sort of nervousness); heart-pounding; and finally_ feeling restlessness. As a whole not good feelings from taking Sudafed. I am not sure whether it help that much. As long as I am taking Sudafed_ it seems helpful; but after a while or not taking it_ symptoms seem to return. Possibly a decade ago_ when my Ear_ Nose and Throat doctor placed me on Sudafed_ I was unable to sneeze for days. I was only able to sneeze upon my visit to the doctor described_ who placed the long mirrored tube through my nostrils to check for possible cause that was when I was able to sneeze. For me_ this was very serious. Since_ as a human person_ sneezing should be automatic_ not being forced or coerced into doing so. I have been on Sudafed off and on for possibly 20-years.

My dr. told me it was safe to take as often as needed. In 2005_ I was put under anesthesia for a hysterectomy and my heart rate went up to 200 beats a minute. I had to be taken out from under the anesthesia. We could only guess it was my long-term decongestant use. I was tested and had a messed up ""hyper adrogernic"" (sp?) issue_ my ""flight or fright"" responses were way out of line so was put on lexapro_ or I was offered a beta blocker to cope with severe dizziness.

Everything was amazingly interesting and the feel of anything I touched was awesome. My inhibitions were lowered and I had a tendency to make a lot of creative connections_ albeit expression was occasionally disrupted by slurred speech. After a while it got kind of old_ and I got a couple of dizzy spells from standing up too fast. After a while I just wanted it to stop.

After taking Sudafed for years_ it lost its effectiveness_ but I could not function without it.  I really think I went though withdrawals (chills and hot flashes in addition to the expected horrible sinuses) when I got off this stuff after 10 years.

54, 1, A terrible cold - Xmas 2006,Last year_ Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) caused my massive heart attack_ and I needed an emergency triple bypass to save my life.  I was a lifelong non-smoker_ age 37_ thin and fit_ without any cardiac risk factors.  The warnings on the box are totally insufficient; there is no mention that this type of chemical is a vasoconstrictor that can cause artery spasms and lead to blood clots (as it did in my case).  Sudafed can have the same impact on the heart as cocaine_ and this fact has been documented in the medical literature (Annals of Emergency Medicine_ November 2004).  It was a devastating experience and I can only urge others NOT to take this very dangerous drug.,Keep in mind that an identical chemical (ephedrine a.k.a. ephedra) was banned by the FDA in 2004 for causing heart attacks and strokes in healthy people.  Yet pseudoephedrine remains on the market -- you can buy it at any pharmacy for about $5.  Why???  How many more people have to die or become injured before the FDA does something?  I almost did_ and left my two-year-old son without a mother.  All because I had a bad cold!,F,39,6  days,5/3/2008,Sudafed 12 hour
55, 1, A bad head cold with congestion,Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) caused my heart attack last year at age 37.  I am a woman with no cardiac risk factors_ thin and fit_ and was in perfect health.  I needed triple bypass surgery to correct the blockage that resulted from a coronary artery spasm (that's what can happen when you take a vasoconstrictor).  This stuff can be as dangerous as cocaine to the heart_ but it's still on the market without the proper warnings.  I can't state it strongly enough:  don't ever use Sudafed or any product containing pseudoephedrine.  This was just devastating to me_ my husband_ and my young son.,If it can happen to me_ absolutley ANYONE is at risk for a heart attack caused by Sudafed.,F,37,6  days,4/29/2008,Sudafed 12 hour

It is good for temporary relief but wasn't great for me long term.,F,33,5  years,1/15/2008,Sudafed 12 hour

59, 5, Allergies_ serious nasal congestion,I take Zyrtec which makes me sort of tired even though I take it at night but since I have been taking the Sudafed I am much more alert.,Growing up I always took Sudafed it was usually the D portion of many of the antihistamines I have taken over the years. For the past 5 years I have not taken Sudafed but have instead used Nasonex or Flonase and they just haven't been doing the job. I have had numerous sinus infections since I got off Sudafed and would have one now thanks to Ragweed season had I not got back on Sudafed. Sudafed is a Godsend_ I will be sticking with it from now on. I can breathe again!,F,37,3  weeks,9/25/2006,Sudafed 12 hour
60, 1, Sinus and allergy,I took Sudafed and generics for years.  I formed blood clots in subclavian arteries and ischemic colitis.  Had to have surgery. Doctors -- Stanford University -- and my cadiologist blame Sudaphed.  It was part of my life.  I did not read the directions!  DO NOT USE MORE THAN FOR 7 DAYS.

61, 2, Chronic allergies & sinusitis,Usually only mild stimulant effect_ sometimes jittery and nervous_ dry achy sinuses and throat. Recently had ischemic colitis linked to my sudafed use - very dangerous intestinal bleeding!,I have taken Sudafed for years due to chronic sinus allergies. It worked very well on my congestion. Recently had intestinal bleeding that required hospitalization. Diagnosed with ischemic colitis_ very serious injury to colon_ and was told Sudafed can contribute to this because it acts as a vasoconstrictor_ making blood vessels tighten up. Ischemic colitis is a rare side effect_ but wanted to post here as a caution to others. I'm in good health and never had problems with Sudafed before_ never knew this could be a danger. Now_ I can never take it again.,F,39,15  years,3/24/2006,Sudafed 12 hour
62, 3, sinus congestion from a cold,It dried up my sinuses but left me feeling absolutely wired and jittery with a racing heartbeat.  Think caffeine times 50.  It was pretty scary.  I spent the whole night *wide* awake even though I took this to clear out my sinuses so I could sleep.  My mood was also very snappish which is unlike me.,I used to take Sudafed for sinus congestion but the last few times I've taken it (and other meds with pseudoephedrine) I've had these reactions.  I now rely on Vaporub to clear my sinuses at night when I have a cold.,F,23,1  days,4/15/2005,Sudafed 12 hour
63, 2, sinus problems,I hope this review helps.. I come from a family with sinus and allergy issues. Needless to say_ during my time growing up_ I had experienced some pretty heavy sinus pressure  (cough_ fatigue_ soar throat_ stuff head/nose) So my mom put me on Sudafed when I was in about 6th grade. At about that time_ I began to develop HEAVY emotional anxiety issues which my parents thought was natural since I was having trouble making friends in school. Not so. Until yesterday_ I lived everyday with an extremely rapid heart beat_ anxiety_ VERY fast and nervous speech_ chronic insomnia etc. I had no idea that the sudafed and anxiety were linked so tightly. I figured I was just a nervous_ uptight_ high strung_ and emotional person. Eventually I was diagnosed with depression_ and after nothing helped_ I quit the antidepressants and saw very little change in my mood. It was then that I began to think that MAYBE the pseudo-ephedrine (remember those crazy diet pills?) were linked to my mood. I recently (VERY recently) switched to Mucinex_ which doesn't nearly help as much_ but has different ingredients in it (not ephedrine). I'm doing so much better in terms of anxiety and mood. SOOOOO much calmer. The change is incredible. The side effects are CLEARLY the worst part of this drug experience,Please use Sudafed with caution. I'm not saying don't use it at all - it surely can be a great help if you ever have a cold or something. But I wouldn't ever use it again past a few days. Too powerful.,M,18,7  years,2/19/2005,Sudafed 12 hour

There is a prescription called Entex PSe that contains a high does of sudafed _ plus and expectorent. Excuse the spelling. I have been taking it for 4 years. 12 hours pill that not only lets you breath_ but helps release the crud in your head so you can spit it out.,M,48,4  years,1/9/2005Email,Sudafed 12 hour
