Difficulty sleeping at night but very fatigued during the day. Over the past 3 months I have started to have increased joint pain in my knees_ shoulder and hips. I have also developed chronic pain in my lower back. I have also developed tingling in my hands and feet.  I feel a bit foggy with my short term memory.

71, 3, Hypertension,My hypertension is hereditary from my fathers side. Since 2005_ I've been on Clonodine_ Lisinopril_ Benicar_ now I am taking 100mg of Losarten (Cozaar)a day. Pros: Does keep my BP around 130/80 80% of the time. Don't have the displaced_ anxiety/insomnia feeling like the previous drugs.Cons: Like the previous drugs_ still have the mild depression/crankyness. The worst being the lethargic_ dragged out feeling. I used to go to the gym 4-5 times a week. Now I'm down to 2 days. No incentive. Hard to concentrate trying to get things done. Regular exercise and BP meds don't mix. It's one or the other. I want to tell my doctor but he already thinks I'm nuts for changing the meds all the time. I'm employed but have no heath insurance. $450 to see my doctor for 10 minutes.Good luck stay positive.,,M,47,3  months100mg 1X D,2/8/2012Email,Cozaar

75, 4, high blood pressure,Fatigue when I first started on medication.  Later_ intermittent episodes of light-headedness/dizziness.,My blood pressure was borderline-high (130/90) for about two years and my internist decided to put me on a generic b.p. medication. I felt so tired that I stopped taking the medication and my internist just shrugged when I told him.Then in 2008_ I developed breathing problems after exposure to a toxic substance.  My b.p. shot up so high that my new internist insisted that I go on medication; after I told her my reaction to the previous medication_ she decided I should take Cozaar.  As I was pretty sick from the toxic exposure_ I don't know if I had any side-effects from the Cozaar but my b.p. readings were much better and the internist said to stay on the medication.Earlier this year_ I was told I would need to switch to Losartan_ the generic of Cozaar.  My internist then remarked at  subsequent office visits that my b.p. readings were very low.  I purchased a b.p. monitor and started taking my b.p. in the mornings but the readings were fine.  However_ I started having short episodes of light-headedness_ usually when walking my dog in the afternoon.  They started occurring more frequently so at my last check-up in October_ my internist cut the dosage in half (from 50 mg. to 25 mg.).  It took a few weeks but the dizziness and light-headedness no longer occur.  ,F,62,1  years25 mg. 1X D,12/6/2011,Cozaar

This is after I spent a ton of money on allergy medicines_ cough syrup_ cough drops_ and doctor appointments. I finally googled a cough and found out that is a side effect.  I went off - and about 2 weeks later the cough was gone.  I went back on my Diovan.  Had no problems.  I decided again_ Hey lets save some money.  (You would think I would have learned by now.)  I have now been on Losartan for about 14 days.  About 3 days after taking the pill I had a mild cough that would only happen a few times  a day.  3 days after that I got a sore throat. I also have noticed mild nasal congestion at night_ and headaches.  I have been treating myself for a cold that is not really there!!

When I woke-up a few hours later_ the pain in my back had worsened and now had migrated to my chest and my right arm was slightly numb like when you barely hit your funny bone in your elbow.  I had talked to a different doctor than my usual doctor and told her of my symptoms and that they were getting worse.  She didn't appear too concerned and told me to take something OTC for pain.  I had had a collapsed lung 12 yrs. ago and the pain was similar to that.  I also wondered if I was having a heartattack.  I decided to go to the hospital.  Luckily I was admitted to the cardiac unit and they did several tests and after giving me a CT scan of my chest using a dye_ it showed that I was in the beginning stages of pneumonia.  I found a UK site which lists pneumonia as being a very rare side effect of Cozaar.So please_ if you have severe muscle pain in your back_ ask your doctor to order you to have a CT scan using the dye and make sure that you don't have pneumonia.  This ia an extremely dangerous drug that should be taken off the market.Right now_ I'm very scared and I'm hoping that this is all that will happen to me.,F,52, 50 MG 1X D,4/29/2010EmailHistory,Cozaar

(I had an identical response with Atacand_ so my cardiologist decided to try Cozaar because it's supposed to be milder.  The only difference for me was that Cozaar took a little longer to produce the same side effects as Atacand.),"When I told the cardiologist about my symptoms_ he didn't believe Cozaar was to blame because the muscle aches/joint pain didn't start right away.  (Since stopping Cozaar_ the pain is gone.) Physician arrogance continues to amaze me.  How is it that some doctors won't accept the uniqueness of their patients' personal physiologies_ preferring to attribute drug reactions to ""imagination"" rather than listening to_ and validating_ what is clearly valuable patient feedback?

At least until my doctor has a better understanding of what's wrong with me. Doctors think I have Marfan Syndrome_ but we're in the early stages of any type of diagnosis.,On the flip side_ it took down my BP when other meds wouldn't and I had a lighter feeling in my chest.

158, 1, Protect Kidneys from diabetes,I begin taking two 500mg Metformin tablets in 2003 to regulate my blood sugar.  With excellent functioning of my kidneys and no sign of problems_ in 2007 my doctor recommended going on a daily regiment of 25mg cozaar to protect my kidneys over time.  For over 20 years_ I've been an avid walker.  Early into the cozaar regiment I experienced no problems taking the pill.  However_ after about the 13th month into the regiment I begin to feel numbness in my left foot and loss of feeling in the knee joint of my right leg.  In 14th month I begin experiencing extreme difficulty in getting and maintaining an erection.  Additionally_ when an erection came_ it was not firm at all.  In about 18th month I could not get an erection at all.  Prior to both the numbness and erection problem I had never experienced a problem in these areas.  Recognizing that I was doing fine before taking cozaar_ I decided to search for an Internet chat room to see what others might be saying about this drug.  This lead,While I thought cozaar was just a kidney protection drug when it was recommended by my endocrinologist_ the research revealed that its being used for a variety of medical conditions_ i.e._ high blood pressure_ hypertension and a few others.  This suggest that the drug is still being tested to see which_ if any_ of these conditions it is best suited.  Cozaar may prove to be very beneficial as a kidney protector for some persons with Type II diabetes_ but for now_ its not for me.  Much more data is needed that provide definitive results on cozaar.,M,61,20  months,7/12/2009,Cozaar

The doctor said that there would be no side effects. After the 7th day of 200 mg all of a sudden my urine turned brown and a tea color. I was immediately taken off of the Cozaar and my BP was about 108/50. My BP is back up to normal after two days but the jury is still out on what happened. There was no blood in the urine and all blood work_ urine and EKG were normal. The M.D. is now researching this as to what may have happened. I just hope that I did not lose any kidney function. The creatine level did not go up,,M,67,7  days,1/31/2009,Cozaar

Cozaar_ the latest of several medications that have not been effective in treating my bp problems_ actually seemed to cause the pressure to elevate (tonight_ 204/124!) over the 2 weeks I have taken it. As others noted_ several side effects seem to be directly connected to this medication.

196, 2, HBP,After switching from Procardia becasue it was ineffective in reducing my Bp_ I took the Cozaar for about 2 months without issues. Bp went down from 150/100 - 120/80. Then the daily headaches started. They were debilitating mucle tension type headaches in the back of the head and behind my eyes. Nothing would help these. Went to a different Dr. who put me on Benecar(sp)for a month. After 1.5 weeks headaches went away. After my Benecar ran out I went back on my Cozaar to see if the headaches would return_ they did in 2 weeks. Now Dr. is trying Diovan 320 mg. I looked at the side effects for that - holy crap!

197, 5, high blood pressure,none - it worked great.,I'd been on cozaar for over 5 years to control my wild bp (too high sometimes and too low others; averaged out too high)_ and it worked great - controled the bp as well as I can ever expect_ and no side effects. A recent change in job brought a change in health insurance and of course the new insurer won't cover cozaar_ so Dr. is trying others (currently diovan_ which has caused insomnia and 5 lb weight gain in 2 weeks). I'm debating just paying for the cozaar out of pocket_ despite the high cost. But I'll call the Dr. today and will probably try another drug (atacand?) before giving up and paying it out of pocket. If he'll try hard enough_ my Dr. should be able to convince the health insurance company to cover cozaar for me_ but I'm not holding my breath - I've been dealing with the medical industry for a rare and little understood condition for over 20 years_ and know they don't like to listen to patients.,F,50,5  years,9/22/2008,Cozaar

235, 5, Hypertension,For the initial 2-3 weeks after starting cozaar I felt like i might have been experiencing some mild adverse mental effects like drowsiness or cloudiness. However I am also on beta blockers_ and I changed from a different medication. This could explain the cloudy feelings. No other overt adverse side effects.The only issue with the medicine is that it won't be available in generic form for at least another 2-3 years. I'll go broke.I think alot of you guys that have these crazy side effects are hypos. I think you need to get a doctor you trust_ and give the medicine clear_ objective consideration before discontinuing. If you don't take the medicine_ there are far greater consequences than being tired or having diarrhea... like death. It's been 1.5 years since i started taking cozaar.,"If I take Cozaar at night_ I sleep better. If I take my dose about 1.5 hours before I plan to sleep_ it's easier to sleep.For the longest time I had pretty bad palpitations. When I started taking cozaar_ they diminished and they're basically gone now. This could be purely coincidence.For the most part_ my blood pressure is stable_ with no big spikes or troughs in between or just after taking the med.On an even more positive note_ I read in some studies that cozaar  was beneficial to people that have brain diseases like parkinsons or alzheimer's.

I started researching about Cozaar today because that is the only thing that is different in what I due or take on a everyday basis so I had figured to start there and while reading on here I basically come to find out that it is most likely from cozaar.  I also realized that I have some tiredness (although not extreme) in trying to wake up in the morning and it is harder to ""get out of bed"" then what I can remember.  I've had some palpatations_ but very rarely (only if I rush and loose m breath I get a few ""miss"" ticks of the heartbeat that I can definetly recognize)","I have been on Cozaar 100mg for almost a year after having some of the same side effects by taking Hydroclotothizede 75mg last year for about 1 yr time.  Initially cozaar worked great (went from 50mg to 100mg) but as the summer started (in AZ) just like with Hydroclorthizide I started feeling real dizzy.  I had a bad episode July 5th where I woke up for work and took a shower and had what I would describe as a TIA (although my doctor and the hospital did all the tests and it all came back fine_ even though you can't really test for TIA since there is no ""damage"") where my left arm went completely dead for about 30 sec and it fealt really sureal (no pain_ no loss of consescnous_ no confusion_ etc)and that really scared me.  I think it really had to do with cozaar.  My dizziness is not everyday and I would describe it as having episodes where it will run for a few days and then go away for a week or 2 and come back.

305, 5, High Blood Pressure,I feel a little woozy even when I take it at night and I feel a little fatigue too. Many people said that those side effects will disappear after 2 weeks or something but when you compare COZAAR to other drugs it wins.,My blood pressure was 150/100 and I felt that I have something wrong with my vision.

I'VE BEEN ON IT FOR 4 MONTHS NOW. JUST GOT ANOTHER SIDE EFFECT. A TICKLE IN MY THROAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S NORMAL TO CONTINUE TO GET SIDE EFFECTS STILL. IT WORKS ON MY B/P_ BUT ONCE IN AWHILE_ MY READING IS ALITTLE HIGH ON EITHER MY SYSTOLIC OR DIASTOLIC. AFTERWARDS_ I TAKE IT LATER & IT'S FINE. MAYBE MY STRESSFUL LIFE AT TIMES. B/P WILL NOT ALWAYS BE PERFECT_ BUT BETTER THAN IT WAS. IT WAS CONTANTLY HIGH BEFORE. THE LATEST SIDE EFFECT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I HAVE A TICKLE & NEED TO CLEAR MY THROAT OR COUGH IN ORDER FOR IT TO CLEAR THAT FEELING_ BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T.,IT HAS SIDE EFFECTS_ BUT EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. I AM ALSO ON ATENOLOL & I NEVER HAD A SIDE EFFECT FROM THAT. JUST WHEN I STARTED THE COZAAR.

327, 1, For edema_ I THOUGHT!,EDEMA!  Also insomnia_ pretty much about 75% of the side effects listed on Rx List!  IT ALMOST KILLED ME.   Also it kinda made me like a zombie.......READ THE SIDE EFFECTS of ANY MEDICINE BEFORE YOU TAKE IT!   Go to http://www.healthsquare.com for the REAL TRUTH that Rx List MIGHT not tell you_ Rx list.com is a COPY verbatim of the package insert - duh_ like they are going to tell allllllll the bad stuff so you won't take the medicine??  There are other sites_ too: Drugs.com_ a pharmacist-sponsored site_ but mostly HealthSquare will give you THE WHOLE TRUTH_ ALL side effects etc.  Go to ALL OF THEM and COLLECT INFO BEFORE YOU TAKE ANY DRUGS >>>>>>>>>>I WISH I HAD,People are not sufficienty warned about the side effects_ especially is someone is having problems with EDEMA.....and notice change in personality or activity level.  INDERAL has been around for a LONG TIME_ it's safe and not much side effects_ I've been on that for YEARS!!!!!  COZAAR IS TOO NEW_ they just got it apporved in 2003_ stick with the ones that they KNOW THE SIDE EFFECTS and will PRINT THEM_ because people have taken them long enough. COZAAR MESSES WITH TOO MANY SYSTEMS_ and the way it works or its benefits are NOT CLEARLY STATED.  ITS A RISK YOU DON,M,43,90  days,11/18/2003Email,Cozaar
