0, 1, Asthma flare up from getting blasto,Mkes it harder to breathe for 30 minutes after taking it. Getting worse and doctor wants to put me back on prednisolone again. I notice that if i use ventolin I dont get better. If i take just the steroid I get better within a couple of weeks. Symbicort keeps me illand going downhill,,M,58,2  months,7/31/2016Email,Symbicort
1, 1, COPD,Started on 160 and after heart palpitations dose reduced to 80.4 BID.  The medication gave me tremors_ slight weight gain_ moon face_ and excess sputum production.  Leg cramps were horrible and every physician I questioned had no suggestions to relieve them.  After 4 horrible years on it I asked my pulmonologist to get me off Symbicort and  was recently prescribed Anoro.  This works much better for me and I am glad to be off the steroids.  Haven't used a rescue inhaler since changing medication.,,F,65,4  years80.4 2X D,7/18/2016,Symbicort

3, 5, COPD_ Pulm. Sarc._  Bronchiectasis,Since on Symbicort I've only experienced hoarseness. This is an extremely minor thing compared to not being able to breath properly.,I was hesitant about starting this inhaler because of the black box warning.

4, 5, breathing well controlled,hoarseness_ bruising.,Advair did not work well for me. I constantly had to run inhaler under water to get it unplugged. I was thrilled when my insurance switched me to Symbicort. I breathe better and use my rescue inhaler less often. I also use Synthroid for hypo_ which I had previous to using any steroid inhaler. It has not affected my thyroid or dosage in the slightest. The benefits outweigh my side effects.,F,44,2  years160 2X D,4/23/2016,Symbicort
5, 2, Asthma,I took Advair for years and loved it. My insurance made me switch to Symbicort because it was cheaper and they required that I failed on Symbicort before they would pay for Advair. I have had to use my rescue inhaler more frequently on Symbicort_ I'm experiencing an irregular heart beat and worsening of msk pain. I've also gained 20 pounds and my thyroid has gone from normal to hypo. I stopped taking it this week and am hoping to see some of the negative symptoms subside.,I've had lifelong asthma and know how to manage it well with meds.  Not a fan of symbicort. It's cheaper than advair by half_ but I have to take 4xs as much to get an affect and the side affects are far worse.,F,41,9  months 2X D,4/6/2016,Symbicort

8, 1, As a preventative asthma pump,Heart palpitations which caused dizziness_ shortness of breath_ chest discomfort and mood is low.,I have had asthma all my life. I've always been on the pumps and most recently I was on seretide 250 which I was perfectly happy with. On a routine asthma check they decided to move me to symbicort_ obviously I asked them why because I was happy. They showed me a little medical book that belongs to them. Seretide cost something like £65_ symbicort £7.50. I appreciated their honesty and gave it a go_ but the difference in price is shown through how horrible a drug this is. I've never had problems ever with any asthma pump or with my health_ yet this week I've seen the doctor twice and also went to a&e through these absolutely horrible side effects. I could barely walk let alone jog without the heart palpitations stopping me in my tracks and it alarmed me. I'm fit yet I'm worried to do anything at the moment. Obviously I'm off it now and have been for 4 days_ I'm still getting symptoms so I'm hoping it's working it's way out of my body. It's a horrible cheap drug and I would NOT recommend it.,F,35,2  weeks200,3/18/2016,Symbicort

24, 1, Wheezing_ and shortness of breath,My doctor prescribed this to me after me thinking for 2 weeks back in the beginning of Nov. I was having my normal allergy symptoms. Then I started having shortness of breath and wheezing. She diagnosed me with Bronchitis_ and put me on Zythromax and Prednisone. That didn't help_ and I developed a slight cough. I just realized today that it has been this medication that was causing me to begin itching_ and breaking out in hives after using it(2 puffs 2x dly). Also began experiencing leg cramps about 5 days ago_ stomach bloating and cramping_ elevated blood pressure from day 1 (already on meds) which was controlled_ AND I've gained about 5 lbs!!,My symptoms have not gotten better although_ they have not worsened. I'm a singer_ and I'm unable to hit my notes. My singing_ and speaking voice is very raspy and sometimes I can barely talk. This was occurring BEFORE the Symbicort_ but I thought it would help clear it up. I'm waiting to call my doctor on Monday_ but will not be using this medication anymore!

26, 1, asthma,For the first two weeks I was able to breathe with the Symbicort product very well.  Then I began to develop mucus and coughing_ which caused breathing to become more difficult then before I used the product.  I was not advised that you could not quit this product cold turkey.  When I did stop using it abruptly_ my breathing was completely shut down.  I almost passed out. I was able to get to my rescue inhaler_ which saved me.  I had to use the rescue inhaler every hour then every two hours just to be able to breathe.  This is not shortness of breath I am talking about.  I could not breathe.  After a few weeks of stopping Symbicort I developed allergies.  Especially food allergies.  I had asthma attacks over practically every thing I ate.  I lost 35   pounds in just a few months because I could not breathe after eating with out reacting severely.

27, 3, Asthma,* Eye's have a harder time adjusting to small print or pictures close to the face and overall slowed eye lens adjustment and reaction time.* Bloating and/or weight gain noticeably in the stomach and face areas of the body. * Occasional painful muscle cramps and/or contortions in the chest (when stretching)_ legs_ fingers/toes.* Lethargy. * Occasional headaches.* Excessive coughing up of phlegm in the morning upon waking.,This medicine does work in regards to relieving serious asthmatic breathing symptoms for long periods of time (12-24hrs). However_ one needs to be aware that there are side effects that come along with the product and may vary from person to person with some overall similarities. Noticeable weight gain is an issue and one cannot eat their previous normal caloric intake without gaining weight. The only way around this is to eat less caloric dense food and focus more on foods that have a higher nutritional value. Minimize or eliminate processed foods_ simple carbs_ sugars and other additives. I've had to go with eating only one large meal a day_ with a smaller 2nd meal or snacks throughout the day to refrain from gaining too much weight. I also drink an energy drink in the morning with fresh squeezed lemon/lime juice to wake me up from the lethargy this medicine brings upon you (I don't like coffee and consume one of the various pre-exercise energy powder products on the market_ this does the trick for me). I don't eat out much and cook all my own food at home to monitor exactly what and how much I'm eating. If you continue to eat like you did previous to using this medicine you will gain serious weight_ i.e. 3 meals a day_ not paying attention to where and what food is being eaten_ etc. Maintaining some kind of exercise routine and a healthy lifestyle is a must on this medicine as it will slowly ruin other parts of your health while allowing you to breathe normally,M,41,2  years80mcg 1X D,11/15/2015Email,Symbicort

It had suddenly become completely out of control & dangerous. I had been taking it 5 days_ but it wasn't until my parents saw the commercial for symbicort and called to tell me to research it_ before I realized the side effects were the culprit for my other sudden issues. Within 5 days I noticed I was bloated (almost could pull off being a pregnant woman)_ my Albuterol was no longer helping_ rapid breathing_ the feeling an elephant was on my chest 24/7_ dry & horrid taste in mouth_ trembles_ insomnia (totally not normally an issue)_ getting out of bed became dreadful_ raspy voice_ and my abodomen_ neck_ and joints started to hurt. After realizing these issues were side effects of Symbicort_ my usage was abated on day seven. If I am on the verge of asthma attacks landing me in the hospital_ why take a preventative that causes difficulty breathing and decreased effectiveness of your rescue inhaler. Worst inhaler ever.

I have gained 15 pounds_ but exercise regularly and eat a very healthy diet - no sugar_ no white flour_ lots of fruits veggies and lean meat_ so there was no reason for the weight gain.  Also losing my hair now and have developed bald spots.  I am stopping the drug immediately after doing a lot of research.  I could just kick myself for not following up with my pharmacist when I first had the symptoms_ but the drug did relieve some breathing issues and I thought maybe I would ""get used to it"".

The med helped my asthma almost better than Advair but the eye trouble was terrible and scary.  I've only been off it 3 days and my eyes still aren't completely back to normal but close.  I'm probably going to set up an eye examine to make sure it didn't cause any damage. The eye pressure was so bad that it may have been considered an acute glaucoma attack but I don't know for sure yet.  Luckily once I stopped it my eyes started feeling normal again.  If I hadn't stopped it when I did it might have caused permanent damage.  Online it says if you experience eye pain_ blurred vision_ eye redness contact doctor immediately.

I said only the Sybicort. Now within 2 months of my last hip replacement_ I was hospitalized for severe pain in my upper torso. After a whole lot of every testing and 6 days in the hospital with heavy painkillers_ it was discovered that I have two unexplained very seriously broken vertebrae in my back causing this massive amount  pain. Upon numerous x rays_ MRIs _ CT scans_ and Dexa Scans_ My second orthopedic Dr asked me that same question. ""Have I been taking any Steroids long term""?.  Again_ I said only Symbicort. Now the surgeon is asking the same questions and why is  a 52 year old man with no family history of bone problems has had so much serious  surgery done on his bones with no explanation ? After telling all of these doctors that I have been on Sybicort for the 4 plus years_ I have noticed that each one of them will not comment about the Symbicort if it could be the reason. The best answer I have received is_ "" Its Possible"".

I am contributing my consistent hoarse voice to this_ but I also was not consistent with rinsing my mouth after usage. Now I am. I have always been anxious_ but it's probably due to being on asthma and allergy medication since I was a kid. I sometimes get nausea in my stomach area_ been happening since only last year_ not sure if from anxiety or Symbicort. I saw Symbicort can cause stomach upset so it could be possible after all these years. Honestly_ Symbicort has worked the best for me_ and I've tried everything. My asthma is under so much more control now_ and I only need rescue nebulizer once in awhile_ maybe once a month_ if that. It almost works as well as a rescue inhaler. My hair has NOT fell out from using Symbicort_ and I have had NO weight gain. I have maintained the same weight for years_ but I work out and eat small meals. The only annoying side effect is the hoarse voice. Other than that_ nothing serious_ headaches could be from anything_ and my mom gets migraines so I could just be like her.

168, 3, Asthma,Weight gain_ eye strain_ depression_ experienced a slight amount of disorientation or the sense that my balance is out  of whack.,Wake up at night_ then in morning with a ticklish_ scratching feeling in my airways.  Taking Symbicort aleviates the symptoms. This did not happen before Symbicort.  It likes my body is addicted to the med now.,M,47,1.7  years,5/10/2009,Symbicort

170, 4, asthma_ chronic bronchitis,Weight gain_ very raspy voice_ sore throat on a regular basis_ throat feels like it is completely dried out.  Some eye and chest pain.,I have been using Symbicort for the past several months_ and even though it has helped my breathing much better than Advair_ Spiriva_ Foradil_ Asmanex_ and various rescue inhalers_ it seems to have made my lungs very dependent on the medicine.  My lungs feel different than normal_ like my lungs are feeling dried out and sticky if that is possible_ all at the same time.  It seems  they are becoming lazy_ like now they cannot miss a dose.  Even with the strange lung feelings that I have_ I still will take it because is absolutely works better than all the other products that I have tried.,F,50,190  days,2/12/2009,Symbicort
171, 3, Asthma,Eye strain_ dehydration_ depression_ weight gain_ decreased erections and limbido_ and bad dreams. Also_ my family and I have noticed that my voice has changed a bit - gotten quieter and raspy at times. I have also experienced a slight amount of disorientation or the sense that by sense of ballance is out of wack.,Symbicort (along with Singulair) has really helped my asthma_ but all the side effects really make me wonder what will happen as I continue to take them over time. I also took it upon myself (I don't suggest this to anyone)to cut my dose of Symbicort in half. This greatly reduced the headaches and eye strain.,M,36,2  months,11/17/2008,Symbicort
