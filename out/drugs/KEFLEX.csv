0, 1, Post-surgery,Deep fatigue_ lasting headache_ nausea_ vomiting_ no appetite_ 103 fever_ aching joints_ severe dizziness_ general sense of dread. Two full days after I stopped taking it I am still very sick. KNOW THIS: you CAN stop taking an antibiotic in mid-course. The alleged damage related to doing so is overstated.,If my input stops a single person from taking this accursed medication it was worth the time to offer a review. I have taken numerous antibiotics but never one that produced debilitating side effects like KEFLEX. Avoid this drug and its criminal impact -- demand an alternative! I would not be surprised if this drug has killed people_ especially those already in a compromised state. Thanks to this site's owners for providing an outlet to those of us who have suffered due to a dangerous drug.,M,51,2  days,7/30/2016Email,Keflex
1, 1, bacterial infection,This medicine is just not for me. I think I got just about every side effect. 2nd day 6th dose_I am totally crawling out of my skin! Short of breath_cold clammy skin_when I say cold I mean freezing! My pulse was at 40 @ one point. Chest pain elevated blood pressure_frequent Urination_diarrhea.

5, 1, To prevent infection from a cut,My daughter received a deep laceration on her leg and was prescribed Cephalexin generic for Keflex. On the third day my daughter started experiencing horrible headaches and a severe stomach ache. By the 5th day taking this drug she was miserable throwing up with a migraine.,This is a horrible dangerous drug. I regret ever giving this to my daughter. She suffered for no reason!!,F,10,5  days500 2X D,6/13/2016,Keflex
6, 1, UTI,Bad headache_ ringing in ears_ anxiety_ depression (I've NEVER had that before!) pain in lower legs - shins_ swollen ankles_ high b.p._ insomnia_ weke up at 4 a.m. no matter what time I go to sleep. Lethargic_ weak_ tired_ indigestion. On day 7 it feels like my UTI is coming back. Ribs are sore. Increased appetite (could be because I'm too exhausted to do anything).,I HATE THESE PILLS!!!,F,67,7  days500 MG 4X D,6/9/2016,Keflex
7, 4, prevent infection had lip biopsy,Day 6 into it. Prescribed a total of 2_000mg a daily to prevent infection after a salivary gland/lip biopsy. Two 250mg capsules 4 times a day. No gastro side effects_ but within an hour of taking each dose I am peeing like crazy_ volume and urgency. I have interstitial cystitis as well_ so this is really making the urination frequency off the charts.,,F,51,7  days1000 4X D,5/21/2016Email,Keflex
8, 1, UTI,Extreme GI distress,I must have had an allergic reaction or oversensitivity to this drug. I had taken in the past with no major issues. Was given as treatment for UTI. Took 1st pill and felt fine_ for about 2 hours.. then I felt upper abdominal/reflux-like pain that gradually worsened until I began vomiting almost uncontrollably for about 3 hours.. then_ it was weird_ I could almost feel the pill moving down my GI tract! I then had severe cramping and shooting pains_ along with the accompanying diarrhea. In total_ the reaction lasted 6 hours. Being a total dope_ I thought this was a fluke.. and the next day I took another pill. Well.. the exact same thing happened. My husband wanted to take me to the ER_ as it was so severe_ but I rode out the 6 hours again_ then all was over. I rated it low because of my personal reaction_ which does not seem to be norm_ but just wanted to report in case someone else experiences the same thing.,F,59,1  days500mg 2X D,5/20/2016Email,Keflex

12, 1, UTI,Extreme fatigue! I was taking 500 mg 4x's a day. Had to stop taking it. Everything I ate which wasn't much had me running to the bathroom. Not good for someone with a history of colitis. I had a lot of anxiety and depression. My heart rate went to the moon. I've never taken this med before and I will never take again.,,F,65,4  days500 mg,4/23/2016,Keflex
13, 1, UTI,I was supposed to take it a week_ but could not manage.  Horrible G.I. effects_ diarrhea_ stomach pain_ bloating_ mucous.  Insomnia_ brain fog_ heart palpitations_ feelings of despair and anxiety_ joint pain_ back pain_ generally wanting to give up on everything.  Headache.  Body chills and freezing hands.  A wretched experience all in all.  People over 50 generally don't do well on this drug.,Two things can help if you are stuck taking this:  1.  Magnesium supplement for the heart palpitations_ the drug depletes MG.; and 2. a specific probiotic which has Saccharomyces Boulardii in it.  Most drug stores and groceries have it mixed in with the usual probiotics.  Read the labels and find this--it REALLY helps with Diarrhea and G.I. pain.  I will never again take any antibiotic without supplementing with this.,F,60,3  days500 mg 3X D,4/23/2016,Keflex

15, 2, UTI_  Diverticulitis,Prescribed this because original scrip of Cipro and Flagyl gave me 'flying out if my skin' anxiety attacks. First 2 doses were fine_ but after 3rd dose noticed headache starting to build. Also felt utterly exhausted and wanted to crawl back in bed. Anxiety attack hit 2hrs after 4th dose. Not as bad as with other meds_ but pretty unpleasant. Read that it may stop after I get used to the drug. Just want to get thru the next 5 days so I can get better and never have to take this again.,,F,53,2  days500,4/13/2016,Keflex
16, 1, Infection,Anxiety_ depression_ suicidal thoughts_ felt helpless_ confusion_ sadness etc.,My 12 year old daughter was prescribed Keflex for an infection.  Within a day of taking this her anxiety had increased drastically.  After day 2_ she had a major panic attack and confessed she was having suicidal thoughts.  By nature_ she is an anxious person_ BUT she's NEVER had a panic attack and certainly had never had such terrible thoughts.  She was scared!  This drug is horrible.,F,12,14  days500mg 3X D,4/10/2016,Keflex
17, 4, Kidney infection,It's the only antibiotic so far that's got rid of my recurring kidney infections although it caused almost-unbearable pain in my legs_ muscles and joints.

18, 1, Cyst abscess,Dizziness_ blurred vision_ extreme fatigue_ heat sensations in legs_ pain in legs_ swelling in stomach and legs_ dry mouth_ rash,I advised the NP I was sensitive to antibiotics and already had a reaction to another drug in same class. She wanted me to try 2 a day instead of 3. I took 1 the first day since it was late_ and then 2 for next 2 days. Alter reading reviews_ I ate several yogurts with each dose. On day 3_ I was driving and had 30 minutes of feeling like my leg vein was squirting. That has NEVER happened before. Hours later_ I have swelling in weird places on my leg. With this and other progressive symptoms_ I am scared to take any more. I took 2 Benedryl and called the pharmacy to add this to the allergic list.  I will also advise my doctor. The abscess felt better_ but I will try something alternative. The cure is causing more severe issues than the cyst.  I will not take this med again and advise caution if you are sensitive to meds.,F,60,3  days500 3X D,3/25/2016,Keflex
19, 4, infected cuticle,Extreme fatigue grows stronger after each dose. By day 5 could barely stay awake. Nausea. Lack appetite. Day three hit with diarrhea. Body aches. Day 6 troubles walking legs weak plus all the above. But finger is now fine. I figured there would be side effects. Yep. On to lots of pre and probiotics. i hope this killed off any other infections not detected. Could be some symptoms could be a form of herxheimer reaction. Because this has been a full flu like thing. Now that i know how I react to this drug I Will have it noted in my chart. But will take again If indicated. Not fun but effective.

24, 3, Abscessed Tooth,Severe Vaginal Yeast InfectionManageable abdominal cramping and diarrhea.,"Keflex worked wonders on the infection that was creeping around in my gumline from a bad tooth (that was later pulled and replaced).  The pain from the infection decreased dramatically in just 1 day. HOWEVER_ Keflex also killed all the good bacteria in my vagina_ which made it very easy for candida to have a field day in my ""lady cocoon"".  It was the first yeast infection I'd ever had_ and I'm 40.  It was *terrible*.I strongly encourage anyone (male or female for that matter) to eat yogurt...and lots of it_ while taking your course of Keflex.  Florajen3 (a probiotic supplement) would also have been good for me to know about prior to this mess.I also strongly encourage any female to wait to have sex until a week after your Keflex course to be on the safe side.  Yeast infections are NOT an ""STD"" but they can be passed to your partner_ and trust me...nobody wants it.",F,,10  days500mg 1X D,2/3/2016,Keflex

I was forced to take the piercing out and was given this Keflex stuff. The infection got a bit worse before it got better when I first started taking it. It did the job but it was a pain in the butt taking it three times a day. The GI side effects were horrid_ but I have a sensitive digestive system.

I continued the meds and after his third dose of 2.4ml he had little to no urine output and his pimples turned into blistering hives that covered his face. His ped confirmed this as an allergic reaction to Keflex and changed our prescription.,Keflex is a sulfa drug and should not be taken if you have allergies to sulfa drugs.

Had the usual antibiotic-induced g.i. distress_ which responded well to taking a probiotic and drinking kefir 2x a day.  The worst was the malaise and severe depression.  Wanted to quit job_ quit hobbies_ give up on life.  Being made to feel this way while sick is MOST unfortunate.  It did not go away quickly once off the drug_ either.  Continued enough that I felt half crazy.  It is possible it interferes with absorption of my anti-depressant.,Will beg for an alternative if a doctor tries to give me this again.

I HAVE HAD NEAR FATAL REACTIONS TO THE CLASS OF POISONS CALLED LEVAQUIN AND CIPRO AND ALL THAT GARBAGE. THIS DRUG (TAKEN WITH A PRO BIOTIC AS ALWAYS) CLEARED THE INNER EAR PAIN AND INFECTION THE 2NE OR 3RD DAY OF TAKING IT.,WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE_ ESP.

143, 5, UTI,nothing really.  A little dizzyness.,This is my go-to drug for a UTI.  I had a really bad experience with Macrobid_ and Keflex is much gentler on my system.  This works to clear my UTI in 3 days.  It's not as potent as Macrobid (which seriously cleared my UTI in one day_ but also made me sick and gave me weird numbness).  I am happy with Keflex.,F,27,3  days500 2X D,11/14/2010,Keflex

151, 4, UTI,Only a little diarrhea,This is one of the ONLY AB I can take that doesnt give me severe stomach cramping_ muscle pains_ and brain fogg. If this type of med is appropriate for your condition-go for it-way better than fluoroquinolones.,F,30,7  days,7/8/2009,Keflex
152, 1, Ear infection - staph,At first_ none.  Very slight loose bowels.  I was in a better than normal mood because I've started having strange reactions to other meds lately.  However_ this didn't even touch the infection.  So it was worthless.  Now_ I have a burning pain on my shoulders and face like I have subburn.  I may have lupus so maybe this is why I'm having issues.  Very scared also because I have tons of little bumps on my skin that are slowly turning red and when rubbed_ bleed.  I hope I don't die from this or any other antibiotic to try and cure a staph infection that won't go away.Now I have a ringing in my ear that won't go away.  YAY_ thanks medical community for probably killing me.,Doctors should be ashamed. They really know very little about the human body but come off as if they have a clue.  Reality is_ they are throwing us to the wolves with antibiotics.  The more we take them the more we are at risk for serious diseases like thyroid problems and other auto immune issues.  A healthy body can become very unhealthy from taking dose after dose of these poisions made to kill bacteria AND everything else in your body.  ,M,37,10  days,4/24/2009,Keflex

156, 1, Abscess on upper ear cartilage,Absolutely nothing_ no side effects.,In addition to no side effects_ there were no effects at all whatsoever! After 4 days I was switched to another antibiotic_ and my doc told me he tried me on the keflex at first because it was cheap! They made me fart_ and well_ open up the bottle and smell them. They smell like farts themselves.,F,21,4  days,2/23/2009,Keflex
157, 1, paronychia,loss of appetite_ confusion_ gas_ tiredness_ moody,Took 1500mg a day for 2 weeks and it did nothing for the infection in my finger. Proved to be worthless except to make me more uncomfortable.,F,30,2  weeks,1/19/2009,Keflex
158, 1, cut hand to bone,I got diarrhea and loose bowels for months and I'm not sure I needed the damn drug in the first place.

159, 1, Sinus Infections.,NIGHTMARES.  I am anxious by nature_ so I cannot concretely attribute anxiety to Keflex as well.  I just woke up from a nightmare that has thrown me into a panic attack and shot my blood pressure thru the roof.  I NEVER have nightmares_ but have taken Keflex on 4 or 5 separate occasions and had nightmares each time.  I have 2 doses left but I am DONE.,I have trouble finding antibiotics that do not aggravate my colitis.  I thought Keflex was going to be my drug of choice for the sinus infections I keep getting because of allergy attacks I have been having.  I guess NOT.  My pharmacist has 'never heard of nightmares from Keflex' so if you have experienced this and would like to email me about it please feel free to do so.,F,40,9  days,9/29/2008Email,Keflex

162, 1, infected tooth,Nightmares_ hallucinations_ lack of judgement_ panic attacks_ depression,I had taken the drug one time previously_ also dentist prescribed and experienced thrush.

170, 3, Toe Wound,Severe gas when taken with ibuprofen_ mild diarrhea_ bloating_ trouble sleeping_ lethargy.,Sleeping problems may be non-related. Tiredness is common for me with any form of antibiotic. The gas was a surprise. I was taking the pills for a while before I had this reaction. It seems my anti-viral medication was acting as an antacid. Taken alone it causes some mild gas and bloating. Taken with ibuprofen the gas reaction is severe_ especially on an empty stomach. Taken with the anti-viral medication and no ibuprofen the reaction is very mild_ almost non-existent. The diarrhea is another mild side-effect.,F,37,7  days,6/27/2007,Keflex
171, 3, impetigo,my doctor told me that cephalosporin antibiotics (keflex_ omnicef_ etc.) frequently cause yeast infections and to take a probiotic supplement with it_ so i did...and i still got a yeast infection!! ugh!! but it did to what it was supposed to do as far as clearing up my skin infection.,,F,19,10  days,6/16/2007,Keflex
172, 2, Post-op infection;cellulitus,NONE,I took this on two separate occasions: first for a severe bacterial infection in a wound caused by a rose thorn and it did nothing (cellulitus); second incident was for a surgery site (appendicitus) infection post-op with the same non-result. The cellulitus was cured by intravenous antibiotics and the post-op by amoxicillin. For cellulitus dosing was only for 1 day as infection spread up full arm length and required emergency intervention; for post-op: 10 days.,F,52,10  days,5/11/2007,Keflex
173, 3, Infection in teeth (root canals),"Well_ I can't really say if these ""side effects"" are really side effects_ but I have been getting heartburn mostly everyday. I think my heartburn is Acid Reflux and not related to Keflex. Since this is not a pain medication-I don't think there is any side effects.",I would like to know if Keflex is okay to take with an antacid like Mylanta or Tums. Since I have been having horrible heartburn almost everyday- I HAD to take Mylanta today. I am on 250mg and I take 4 of them per day. I only have a week supply. I am sure the infection will NOT go away until I get the two root canals done.  (I am taking Vicodin for the pain and I only take that when I really need it-at night).  Other than that-I don't have any concerns about Keflex.,F,31,3  days,5/6/2007Email,Keflex

It wasn't until I kept bitting my toung a few days that I realized it was swollen & I was having problems swollowing which indicated my throat was also swollen.,I had taken keflex many years before & never had this reaction but it just happened this time I took it.  I had been hospitalized due to anemia & mal nutrition & the PICC line that they put in for the IV nutrition became infected so keflex was prescribed for it.,F,52,2  days,2/16/2007,Keflex
