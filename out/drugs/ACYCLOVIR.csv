1, 2, Shingles,I've had a lung transplant and am immunosuppresed. I'm also in rejection with poor lung function. I got shingles and was prescribed this. I started to feel very weak. Have more difficulty breathing_ I felt like my blood pressure increased_ and like I couldn't catch my breath. Was tired all the time and had trouble just moving around. At first I thought my lungs were getting worse_ but when I stopped taking Acyclovir those symptoms cleared up. Doctors of course don't believe me_ but the symptoms were very real and return when I just take 1 dose.,I can't take this drug. I would rather go through the pain of shingles again. Not sure if I'm allergic or what_ but I don't see many people reporting what I feel_ so I wanted to share.,M,43,10  days400mg,7/23/2016Email,Acyclovir

12, 3, herpes simplex of lips and mouth,Only odd side effect is neon.green urine and stools,If my son did not take this medicine every day his lips and mouth would be a crusted oozing wound. This medicine is a god send that works most of the time if you catch the onset immediately. He uses liquid oral and the cream. It's very expensive and have to jump through hoops to get insurance to pay for it. Our insurance pays half because it's considered a specialty drug. We pay $550 a month. I wish it wasn't so expensive but well worth it and our family is blessed to be able to afford it but a huge hardship to a family that can't.,M,3,2  years800 mg liq,10/28/2015,Acyclovir

17, 3, shingles,At the time I did not seem to have any side effects but I did notice a rash/raised little red bumps on my face.   However since then I have been diagnosed with PMLE which is an allergy to sunlight. I can only assume that this reaction was triggered by taking this drug.  I have suffered with this now for 2years and means I have to be extremely careful when I go out in the sun. With hindsight although the drug probably prevented me suffering too badly with the shingles I seem to have developed a life long condition re allergy to the sun_  so wish I had never taken it,,F,59,7  days,8/14/2015,Acyclovir

I seemed to always get them on my kneecap and below the shaft of my penis which generally speaking hurt extremely bad! I would get swollen lymph nodes in my groin and feel extremley tired before an outbreak would occur. Acyclovir cleared a bad outbreak up in the matter of 3 days! Totally worth it if you ask me!,M,24,10  days400mg 5X D,7/4/2015Email,Acyclovir
23, 5, Genital hsv-1,No noticeable side effects,I was taking Valtrex for nearly six months at different dosages and it barely taking away any of my symptoms so finally I decided to go with a different medications and even through the first few days of taking this I can already tell that it is working much better than any other treatments I was recieving. With my constant unending breakouts and symptoms I thought that I would have to deal with this bull for the rest of my life_ but it seems that things are becoming better. Seriously good luck and if you're having any trouble have no fear in speaking to your doctor about it. I know I did_ but that's their job and if they don't like it dump them and find a new one. Good luck.,F,18,4  days3 daily,6/1/2015,Acyclovir

Lips and gums swell to the point of visits to the ER. Better results with this med than with valtrex.

66, 4, Cold sores,Ive suffered from cold sores as long as I can remember. If I can catch it at the tingle_  I can prevent it from ever becoming a visible sore to anyone other than myself with acyclovir pills.  It's amazing. If I catch it later it drastically cuts healing time down. I've used it as a preventative medicine as well if I feel like getting sick or going on a trip and realllllly don't want to worry about getting one. I also use tea tree oil with it. Side effects: severe acid reflux- regardless of what I eat or drink and I'm not prone to it otherwise. I also have pain in my back and head and just feel kinda lousy overall for the couple days of the heavy dose while killing the thing. I'm willing to deal with it. The pain_ embarrassment and general discomfort of the cold sore is far worse in my opinion.,,F,34,4  days400mg,1/28/2013,Acyclovir

71, 5, Shingles,At first the drug only caused chronic diarrhea_ and G.E.R.D..  Then as time passed_ I developed fatigue_ joint pain_ weight gain_ loss of sex drive_ muscle stiffness_ and mood swings.,Prior to taking this drug I had constant shingles for almost 25 years without any relief.  I participated in many studies (as a subject) on shingles without any signs of relief.  Much of the time I also had cases of Staff infection from the open sores and blisters getting infected.  I always had to be careful of anything causing physical or mental stress (loud music_ too much sun_ catching a cold_ becoming angry or agitated_ etc...) for fear that the shingles would become more prevalent.  When I began my treatments_ within a week 25 years of constant agony was gone!  I do occasionally get brief bouts of shingles with only a fraction of the previous severity.  I have developed Krohn's disease-like symptoms (without having the genetic disposition for it)_ but it is STILL worth taking the pills for me not to have Shingles.,M,50,7  years800mg 5X D,10/25/2012Email,Acyclovir
72, 5, Cold sores,Bad taste in mouth for last month.  Nothing else unusual.,I have had cold sores since I was a baby.  I discovered Chapstick SPF 15 when I was in my twenties.  That has helped me as I spend a lot of time in the sun.  However_ stress and illness still triggered breakouts.  I averaged about 6 to 8 breakouts a year.  After a lifetime of enduring random painful breakouts_ I decided enough was enough.  I consulted my doctor and he put me on Acyclovir 200 mg daily.  After I had two minor breakouts the following 2 months_ he upped it to 400 mg daily.  Worked for almost 8 months_ and then I had three breakouts in less than a month.  This third one is on top of my bottom lip and it is a large one_ but it crusted over the next day.  I have been taking 1600 mg (800 mg 2xdaily) for five days.  I still have it but it is almost gone.  Before this medicine_ it would have taken a week or more to reach the crusty stage.  I am going to talk to my doctor about upping the dosage to 800 mg daily.  Hope it works to prevent future breakouts.  I do use a topical product called Oil of Mercy.  That helps as well to heal sores.,F,47,9  months400 mg 1X D,8/21/2012Email,Acyclovir
73, 5, genital herpes,I had no bad side effects. It doesn't make the outbreak go right away_ but it definitely shortens the time_ and cut the severe pain I was having in half. Sucks to have to take it so often though.,,F,21,3  months400mg,8/2/2012,Acyclovir
74, 1, genital herpes- prevent shedding,abdominal pain_ lower back pain_ gas_ fatigue_ spotting in between period,I wanted to get started on suppressant therapy just because I never want to experience an outbreak. I chose acyclovir because I did research and determined that it had a pretty good success rate and the side effects are minimal_ plus it is cheaper. Well of course my body doesn't go for the affordable medication and I have been experiencing a dull pain in my back and abdomen. I can mostly deal with this_ but the gas and the spotting are a big nuisance. I haven't seen spotting as a possible side effect_ but I know I'm not getting my period because I just had it. And I never experience this much gas during a period either_ so I really know it's not that. Any other females experience spotting between their periods? I want to switch to famvir_ but I'm afraid it will put me in the same situation_ same with valtrex. Plus they are both way more expensive than acyclovir and I don't have insurance.

After reading various other sites_ i do believe that perhaps i need to take the 200 mg 5x a day or increase dosage to 400mg (various suggestions for frequency of dosage were listed)in order to get the maximum effectiveness from the medicine..and possibly even shorter healing time--- but i'll have to discuss it further with my doctor first.i do use abreva and curasore as topical meds to ease the itching/burning.,F,33,10  days200 mg 4X D,11/3/2010,Acyclovir

But the side effects have helped me with being chronically fatiqued all my life.  The back and muscle pain could be due to not drinking enough water.

86, 5, SHINGLES*(on back and chest),The drug made me feel tired_ and I was constantly thirsty--but my doctor warned me of these likely side effects_ so I expected to be tired and drank lots of fluids/water.  I noticed that my urine was dark yellow every time I peed_ no matter how much water/fluids I drank--that was mildly disquieting_ as I worried about kidney function_ but it returned to normal the day I stopped taking the drug_ so it's temporary kidney stress.  I would not use the drug if I had kidney disease_ and many elderly people have that without knowing it.  *(perhaps that's a really good reason for elderly people or people with kidney disease to get the new live shingles vaccine--to prevent needing to use a kidney-stressing drug)**,"This drug(generic ACYCLOVIR) is MUCH cheaper than many other anti-virals_ and it really worked to reverse the wicked shingles on my back and chest----and it did so in 5 days!  I have never had oral or genital herpes_ and this was my first episode of shingles_ but from what I've read and been told_ my shingles episode was really minor compared to ones not treated with Acyclovir.  i heard horror stories about shingles lasting 6 months in some people!  OUCH-UGLY-NO THANKS! I have very minor pain in the area where the shingles lesions have healed_ but i don't really expect this to bother me even if it takes a while to disappear.  I was told that untreated shingles often lead to horrible post-herpetic pain and that the drug is mostly used to prevent that--thus_ the reversal of the painful and ugly blisters is just a superficial side-benefit and not the main goal.  I would definititely recommend this drug to anyone with shingles_ unless they have kidney disease.  I am young and healthy so could use it in the strongest oral(non-IV) dose as needed.  I was warned that even with use of the drug_ I remained ""highly contagious for Chickenpox"" to any baby or other non-immune person_ so I didn't let it's effectiveness allow me to forget that.  I had to be careful who I was in close proximity to until the lesions were healed.  I can see the effectiveness of the drug being a negative--persons might be so happy with the results that they accidentally forget they have a contagious di",F,47,5  days800 mg 4X D,6/26/2010,Acyclovir
