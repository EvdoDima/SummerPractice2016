0, 5, Diabetes,No side effects whatsoever.  Could cause lows if timing is not just right before eating.,I think this is an effective medication for preventing after meal spikes in blood sugar.  The most difficult thing about taking it is having to remember to take it at the right time before eating a meal.,F,57,6  years2mg 3X D,3/30/2011,Prandin
1, 5, Type 2 Diabetes,If you take the drug and then only eat a small amount of carbs it can lead to a low BG 2-3 hours later. It works best when used with low glycemic index carbs. I cannot identify any other sides effects of the drug.,It is an excellent drug in my opinion as it allows you to eat whenever you want_ and skip meals. It does a great job of lowering BG to 125 or less one hour after eating.,,59,7  years,11/9/2008,Prandin
