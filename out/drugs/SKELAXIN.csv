Leg cramps severe.,I was prescribe skelaxin along with lyrica and celebrex for fibromyalgia_ osteo arthritis and neck pain from a cervical fusion. I cant sleep_ feel sick all day and nauseas. It does very little for my pain. I suppose it would be slightly more tolerable during the day. I really would not recommend this drug.,F,51,6  months800 mg,6/11/2016,Skelaxin

5, 5, lower back spasm,extreme drowsiness_ pressure in my ears_ sensitivity to noise.,The benefits of this drug far outweigh the side effects. I couldn't move before I started taking this medicine. Within an hour_ I felt relief.,F,55,3  days800mg 3X D,5/14/2015,Skelaxin
6, 5, lower lumbar pain,I am taking this in combination with Daypro and Vicoden. I noticed lightheadedness but again this could be from the combination of meds.This drug has been highly successful thus far. I could not walk without being in excruciating pain and the muscles around my spine and hips would seize and I could not fully move my gait. Within hours I could walk with only minor discomfort and would not get stabbing pain every time I got from a sitting to standing position.,,F,32,1  days800,5/6/2015,Skelaxin
7, 4, Muscle spasms/pain in upper back,Initially maybe a tiny bit of fogginess_ but not sure attributed to the drug,I have had an ongoing issue with muscle pain_ knots and stiffness in my upper back between the shoulder blades. This was aggravated recently and went into one of the worst spasms I've ever had. Pain radiated down my arms and side. Doctor prescribed skelaxin. I found this site and read up on this drug prior to taking it. I was hesitant due to the number of negative experiences. I had also taken a muscle relaxant years ago (think it was flexeral) with no relief. I was also given nabumutone and started taking that first (as I've taken this before for tendinitis). After 2 days I was no better_ so took the skelaxin. I had relief within the hour. I was sure to take it with a full glass of water to avoid the chalking taste or burning others have commented on. I'm on day 2_ and I'm not completely pain free_ but I'm probably 75% better . So far_ no notable side effects.,F,60,2  days800mg 2X D,4/5/2015,Skelaxin
8, 3, Herniated disc_ pinched nerve,Some woosiness_ can definitely tell when 5-6 hour mark since taking pill is approaching. Harder stools.,Does help with burning/muscle pain along shoulder/neck. Doesn't do anything for nerve twitches_ tingles. I am able to work about 8 hours/day. No drowsiness.,F,54,3  weeks800 mg 3X D,3/30/2015,Skelaxin

10, 4, pinched nerves from muscle spasms,Heartburn_ tightness in chest_ chalky taste and smell that doesn't go away for about 12 hours...which would be next does_ bloated,Skelaxin works very well and almost immediately for painful spasms. Better than most muscle relaxers I've used. And it doesn't make me as tired as others_ like soma or flexeril. But I hate the side effects_ so I will only take it if I can't move. Like this morning. I woke up at 4am and couldn't move my neck. Sharp searing pain. You'll take anything to get out of that pain. So I took one 800mg and by 5am I have full ROM_ no pain. Still 6hrs later_ pain minimal. But I am drinking fluids constantly to alliviate burning and H2O tastes like chalk. Not fun. So I recommend getting a sample first from doctor_ bc it seems so many people have very different side effects_ some have none. It's a drug to use cautiously in my opinion_ but it does the job.,F,36,4  weeks3x day 800,1/8/2015,Skelaxin

This drug made zero impact_ though I was very hopeful / thankful my PCP decided to try it ...  did nothing but fill me up with intolerable ""side effects"" (how about the medication doing what it's promised to do ?).

But as soon as it started working it made daily life bearable and I am able to sleep at night.I still feel stiff but no pain to speak of.If you are looking for immediate relief_ stick with the narcotics.I noticed a lot of folks only took it for a day or two.

Worked like a charm..almost from the start it seemed to ""block"" the spasms which were 10/10 painful....allowing me to recover and heal faster.",M,50,7  days800 3X D,10/2/2013,Skelaxin
23, 2, Back pain,30 minutes after taking this pill my tongue felt like I had burned it on hot food_ which I didn't. I tried eating an apple with peanut butter and I had to stop because my tongue was so sore. 4 hours after taking the pill (bedtime now) I had bad cramping in both legs. The feeling was like the bad cramping you get after your legs had fallen asleep and the blood was finally rushing back to them. Also_ had about 8 palpitations or heart fluttery feeling.,I may try taking it again once more since it did help my back pain. Hoping all those sensations were just a coincidence and not side effects.

I have not come in contact with latex while taking skelaxin as far as I know_ when I do come in contact with latex on my face my whole face swells not just my mouth. After taking skelaxin my lips are swollen to the point the skin is peeling. Blisters forming in mouth_ the blisters form quickly and burst shortly after.  Within an hr of taking a skelaxin pill developed severe genital itching that lasts a few hrs and then goes away. I did the in home yeast infection test kit thinking maybe it was a coincident_ but that came back negative. Just feel I have to say it_ I was at my obgyn a week before taking this med and got a clean bill of health and have not engaged in any sexual activity since then so I am confident the intense itching correlates to skelaxin and not a separate issue.Not noticing a diffrence in the pain or spasm when taking it_ the adverse reactions outweigh any benefit I could be getting from this med.,F,28,1  weeks 3X D,7/29/2013Email,Skelaxin

30, 1, leg muscle cramps & spasms,"insomnia_ feeling of ""swollen muscles""_ sore & tingling leg muscles","My doctor prescribed Skelaxin for muscle cramps that were continuing after a bout that landed me in the emergency room.  While in the hospital they treated me with Flexeril_ which worked very well.  I'm not sure why Skelaxin was prescribed instead of Flexeril afterward_ but the nurse said they were equivalent.  The Skelaxin prescription was filled by Sam's Club with a generic (don't know the manufacturer_ but it's a pink oval scored tablet).  I had asked for a muscle relaxer because I was having difficulty sleeping_ due to the muscle cramps/spasms and twitching in my thighs_ calves_ and toes.  I could cope in the daytime_ but not at night_ so decided to take it only at night.  I took 1/2 of a 800mg tablet Friday night about 11pm. At 3am I was still wide awake_ and took the other half.  I never slept that night_ and did not notice any difference in the cramps/spasms.  Basically_ a sugar pill would have had the same effect_ except for the insomnia.  Saturday night I took one entire tablet before bed.  I never slept that night_ though I felt extremely tired.  After several hours_ I noticed my leg muscles felt ""swollen""_ sore_ and slightly tingly.  I was more sore after generic Skelaxin than before.  Before_ I had ""troubled"" sleep; with the pills_ I had no sleep at all.  Another reason not to take this med - on my drug plan_ 30 generic Skelaxin cost $106_ and 30 generic Flexeril cost $4.

48, 5, lower back pain,No side effects,I pulled my lower back back in april and I reaggravated it about 3 weeks ago. The pain moved from my lower back and spread up towards my right arm from ribcage to shoulder blade. The spasms I had would send searing pain through my shoulder and into my abdomen. I couldn't breathe in deep and moving hurt. Went to the dr thinking all sorts of things wrong and he prescribed metaxalone(skelaxin). First day I took one and I didn't really see a diff. Next day I took all 3 doses and felt awesome. The last two days I've only had to take one pill and its done the job. No pain. However I talked to the pharmacist and he said that if you take pill without food_ its actually a lower dosage_ apparently taking tthis pill WITH food u get all 800mg...so maybe that's why I havennt experienced any side effects at all.

If skelaxin doesn't work for you fine!  Find one that does.  But don't scream and throw fits to take skelaxin off the market that actually works for others.  Live and let live.

I had bruises forming on all pressure points of my body just from sitting or sleeping.

I almost died because of their medication!! I am really upset that a drug company can use us as lab rats and get away with it. I have read that this has happened to many people.

I took one pill on 3 separate occasions several days apart.  After the first dose (that did not help my back at all) wore off I noticed my muscles felt very tight - especially in my legs.  A couple days later I thought I'd try it again. I took one pill before going to bed.  I woke up with pain in my right leg from my hip down to my calf_ and muscles so tight I could barely bend over.  I thought it was a fluke - that I must have just slept wrong or something. I had the same symptoms when I woke up for the next 3 mornings even though I had not taken any more doses. After the pain and tightness went away I stupidly thought I'd try one more time and took a pill before bed.  That was over a week ago and I have been woken up by the pain in my hip and leg every morning since.  Once I am up for awhile it subsides but comes back the next morning.

184, 1, Torn muscle in shoulder,Mental fog - irritability - headache,I get the feeling that my Dr prescribed this because some pharm rep brought a tray of cookies and a box of pens to his office.  Initially_ my upper back was cramped up after tearing a muscle in my shoulder - the medicine seemed to loosen it up on the first day - but after taking it for 2 more days - the headaches_ irritability & mental fogginess outweighed any initial benefits.  Thank god the pharmacy didn't have enough pills for my full prescription - there's no way I'd take this for more than a few days - and it's expensive as hell - there's older drugs that work much better than this stuff.,M,,3  days,2/23/2008,Skelaxin

189, 1, severe whiplash after MVA,"oggy neural processing""", After taking approx my second dose of skelaxin_ noted I was iching all over.  Didn't connect the itch to the drug because I had been rear-ended in a high speed- collision on the interstate and attributed my FOGGY thinking to the shock of the impact. It's been 8 days since the accident_ and almost a week since I quit the medication.  Saw my allergist a few days ago who suggested I take zyrtec_or benadryl until the IgG-mediated response to skelaxin I'm experiencing (ie allergic reaction) goes away.  This could take a number of days!  Taking Benadryl at night which gives relief for sleep_ then I itch all day long_ in a pattern that comes and goes.  I am at least the seventh person I have noted who has reported allergic-type reaction to this medication_ and I am also noting that many who report the itch are female in their 30's and 40's. ,F,34,3  days,2/11/2008,Skelaxin

For me the only positive effect of Skelaxin was that it did help with pain and relaxation of muscles in my lower back.,For myself it's not worth taking. It gives me too many severe negetive side effects. With Flexeril I only get a feeling of drowiness and dizzy_ witch I don't mind compaired to what Skelaxin does to me.

While I find the comments of many people here on this page hard to believe_ I grant that they may have had hives_ may have swelled up_ may have had depression_ may have had constipation_ etc.  I just doubt any of that was caused by this innocuous drug.  I find great relief from Skelaxin.  I have taken it for several years.  Sometimes I take Flexeril and sometimes Skelaxin.  I find Skelaxin makes me less drowsy than Flexeril.  My muscle pain is quite dimenished from Skelaxin.  I recommend it to anyone with muscle pain.  I have bipolar disorder and have never experienced any depression while taking Skelaxin.,M,38,5  years,1/13/2007,Skelaxin
239, 3, chronic shoulder/neck pain,sleepy_ skin itches a little bit,I have been looking for a muscle relaxer that does not leave me in  a fog. I have a baby and lifting him causes spasms in my shoulder and neck. I have tried flexural and can hardly function. This seems to have similar effects_ perhaps not as severe. I have tried taking 1/2 a pill and the side effects seem to be less. I am not sure this is the drug for me yet.,F,31,3  days,1/7/2007Email,Skelaxin
240, 5, disc bulge L4-L5_ muscle spasms,tired_ slightly dissorientated_ sometimes short term memory was hard to recall,This is the ONLY drug when paired with Motrin 800mg that has helped my pain and spasms. I have tried Flexeril which is HORRIBLE and left me feeling irritable and lifeless. I have also been on Valium_ Naproxen_ and Tylonol 3. Nothing else has worked. I take 400mg of Skelaxin every 6hrs and sometimes take 800mg before bed. After 4 days of being on the medication I had noticed a big improvement. It's not a cure for my condition_ but it does help control the pain and spasms.,F,21,2  weeks,11/18/2006,Skelaxin
241, 1, Muscle pain from to auto accident,Rash and hives on hands_ forearms_ neck.  Sleepiness.  Increase in depression.  Fogginess.  These occurred after one 1600 mg dosage (doctor had me take two 800 mg pills in the morning_ then two in the evening).  I took one morning dose.  By evening_ had all these symptoms.  I will NOT take any additional dosage.,,M,41,1  days,10/15/2006,Skelaxin
242, 1, degenerative neck disease,Dizziness_ faintness_ numbness_ difficulty breathing.,Am on Effexor and began taking Skelaxin. The adverse side effects began immediately. I had to rush to my doctor right away and they took me off of it and put me back on soma_ which I have never had any bad side effects from. The Skelaxin did not relax my muscles at all_ but it may work on people who don't have as severe nerve/muscle pain as I do.,F,37,2  days,10/11/2006,Skelaxin
243, 2, Neck/Shoulder pain spasms,Difficulty sleeping_ dry mouth,This drug did not help me at all_ I hope my dr. can prescribe something better.,F,34,1  months,9/19/2006,Skelaxin
244, 3, herniated disc,Where do I start. i took it before work the first time and could barely stand. I finally just slumped to the floor behind the cash register. Several months later I took it two nights in a row (2 and 3 days ago)and I've had a debilatating migraine complete with flashing lights (which I've never had with my migraines before),It took the pain away and let me slip but if this horrible_ horrible migraine goes on much longer I'm going to go crazy! Not at ALL worth it. Rather have the back pain.,F,51,3  days,9/8/2006Email,Skelaxin
245, 4, severe sciatica and muscle spasms,Experienced drowsiness on 800/mg so cut dosage in half taking 400/mg - one at breakfast and one at lunch...then 800/mg at bedtime which enabled me to sleep quite well.,Sciatic pain along with PT has gone from a 10 to a 4 in just a week so for me this medication works well. I will continue to take this as long as it helps.,F,65,8  days,9/6/2006,Skelaxin

247, 2, 3 herniated discs long term pain,N/A,I figured it would be like Soma_ it's predisesor.. but not only did it not help the pain at all_ it didn't help me to sleep.  After reading these comments I guess I got out lucky I didn't react to it.  Sure wish soma weren't addicting.,F,22,3  days,6/12/2006Email,Skelaxin
248, 4, Severe neck and shoulder pain,I have several neck disks out of line_ and trying to prevent surgery.  Skelaxin though a great blessing has caused a fast weight gain perhaps_ and exercerbation of the depressive part of my manic depression; however the pain is not there.  I am cutting back to 800 mg once a day from 3 times a day.  I have cerebral palsy have more trouble walking on 3 times a day.,All muscle relaxants do make depresssion worse,F,54,3  weeks,6/6/2006,Skelaxin
249, 1, DDD_ back/neck pain,No side effects,Agree with some others; this drug seems to be do absolutely nothing for me.,M,27,30  days,5/26/2006,Skelaxin
250, 4, acute low back pain due to spasm,First two days felt tired_ disconnected/light headed_ had nausea.  On two occassions in the first 24 hours I almost passed out while standing.  My wife noticed I was white as a ghost_ sweaty and shaking.  Also eyelid twitching...very annoying.,I must admit that the back pain improved quickly_ but I was also taking Percocet and Nabumetone (NSAID).  Not sure which drug helped the most.  After 2 days_ my body got used to the medications and I stopped the Percocet and felt much better. Continued taking meds for 2 wks. I never had an issue w/ Percocet before. Troubling though_ is the fact that ever since stopping the Skelaxin my top right eyelid is always twitching.,M,37,2  weeks,2/25/2006,Skelaxin
251, 1, Lower back pain,None,What a joke! I'm thinking this is a placebo or something because I haven't seen any interruption of pain.  I take 800mg/4 times a day.  This drug is definitely weak.,F,30,2  months,2/22/2006,Skelaxin
252, 5, Seperated shoulder_ strained neck,,i seperated my shoulder and sprained every muscle surrounding the joint. I took 400mg before practice and 400mg after.  the pain went from a 10 to about a 6. considering football is a contact sport_ and strain is always put on the shoulders_ this drug is god like,M,18,3  weeks,1/30/2006,Skelaxin
253, 4, neck pain/TMJ,nothing noticable,Originally prescribed for neck pain with little effect_ BUT it surprisingly worked better than anything previously prescribed to relax the tight jaw muscles associated with my diagnosed TMJ. I continue to take Skelaxin for the TMJ with ongoing positive results.,F,48,11  months,1/29/2006,Skelaxin
254, 1, neck injury,I remember not being able to think clearly that morning_ but I kept going back and forth to the mirror because I thought my face was swelling. I kept trying to call my husband at work_ but couldn't get him.  So I called a friend.  She found me on the floor and called 911.  My husband latter told me that my whole body was swollen and cold.  Our family doctor even came to the house to help stabilze me.  He said that if I had not had an epi-pen and used it that I would have died.  I was hospitalized for two days.  But I had brain damage as a result of oxygen deprivation.  For 1 year I could hardly carry on a conversation because I forgot every other word.  I still have word finding problems_ but not as bad.  Three mounths after this reaction I developed uncontrolled seizures. This happened in 2000  when I was 32 y.o.,,F,37,1  days,1/13/2006Email,Skelaxin
255, 4, neck shoulder pain,Help me relax and sleep but some nausea_I also take 10/500 mg vicoden and beed haveing a hard time sleeping_but since takeing skelaxin sleep has been no problem_ Hope it works for you,,M,41,3  days,12/28/2005Email,Skelaxin
256, 3, pulled neck muscle,None,Helped some_ but not much. 3 (spaced out) doses of 800mg seems to do as much as taking regular Tylenol_ which is precious little. I've taken it for 2 days with poor effect_ though it's better than nothing. Will continue to take_ because something is better than nothing for this awful pain.,F,35,2  days,12/28/2005,Skelaxin
257, 3, neck pain,medicine in powerful_ but it will make you constipated_ and have troubles with bowels.,you most judge the outcome yourself_ It will work and help get rid of your muscle trouble_ but in it's place give you bowel trouble.,M,30,1  weeks,11/17/2005Email,Skelaxin
258, 3, Neck and shoulder muscle spasms,It makes me feel a little disconnected.  It sometimes inhibits sound sleep.,This medicine is usually reliable at lessening the intensity of all but the worst muscle spasms although it only lasts for about 4 hours for me.  It is more reliable than the Norflex that I used for 5+ years.,M,58,4  months,11/13/2005,Skelaxin
259, 2, Acute sharp pain near calf,The prescribing sheet suggests it interacts with antidepressents and may cause depression.  I take two antidepressants_ an anti-convulsant_ and lithium.  No side effects were noticed; then again_ there are plenty of side effects from everything else.,It hasn't touched the muscle tension or pain.  I have been taking the 800 mg dose 4 times per day adjunct to ibuprofen and Tylenol.  The pain has been so intense that standing was difficult.  Percocet kills the pain and allows me to flex.  My opinion is that there has to be something better than Skelaxin.  Metaxalone has been around since 1964 and wasn't seriously studied until 20 years later.  The human studies are remarkably small.  I suspect the developer found the results to be too marginal to market the product.,M,43,4  days,11/3/2005,Skelaxin
260, 1, Chronic lower back spasms,I slept through an entire weeks vacation only being up 4 hrs day!I remember NOTHING AT ALL. Bloated and gained 15 lbs and now 4 months later I am having the same reactions again!  Here go another 15 ibs!  I took 800 mg 4X a day. Very   Dizzy_ unable to speak clearly_ remember short term memory 0r write legibily. Craving ICE water_ Diarrhea_ seeing double!,Don't take it!  Its not worth it. It did nothing for the spasms. Apparently I react to the slightest Central Nervous System medications. I get better results from 1/4 Soma Tabs!,F,54,3  days,8/29/2005,Skelaxin
261, 4, Herniated disc_ upper back pain,I could not take 800 mg because I felt nervous and felt breathing was uncomfortable so I discontinued medication.  After more servere pain_ it occurred to me to take a half dosage 400 mg (broke pill in half) and had a substantial decrease in pain and few side effects.,The first time I could not take at all.  Now for last few days_ I am taking as needed and the lower dose is helping.,F,53, ,8/14/2005,Skelaxin

Only taking in PM.,I am also taking neurontin like the F 37 y.o. gal and have never experienced tiredness on neurontin alone.  Skelaxin + neurontin must = tired.  There is an indication for antidepressants such as Zoloft_ maybe one for anti-seizures should be added.,F,30,3  days,6/23/2005Email,Skelaxin

267, 1, Chronic back pain,Deep depression.,Actually worked to relieve pain.  I took one 800 mg. tablet with one 5-325 MG Percocet_ as per doctor's instructions.  I hadn't been able to even stand up straight for days.  It allowed me to sleep and function again_ which was wonderful_ but I suddenly started to experience this bizarre depression.  Nothing else was wrong with me; it was just out of the blue.  As soon as I stopped_ the depression stopped.  Very weird.,M,39,3  days,6/13/2005,Skelaxin
268, 4, chronic muscle spasm,Have not noticed any,This is a MUSCLE RELAXANT not a pain medication. It does_ indeed_ perform as it is prescribed to do. The muscles lose their rigidity_ this allows the pain medication to do it's job. It cuts down the number of days that I am out whenever I have a flare up. If you are looking for sleep or altered consciousness_ try a narcotic.,F,36,6  months,5/18/2005,Skelaxin

272, 4, Muscle rigidity from poisoning/pain,Can be slightly disorienting/foggy-making_ and affect memory--especially after cummulative use from consecutive days.  I had a little fender bender after taking it several days in a row.  It seemed like I was in better control_ so side-effects seem subtle.,I am happy with Skelaxin.  I take it intermitantly to relax muscles_ not really to address pain.  It does help_ but there are probably more potent meds.  I like how Skelaxin does not strongly affect brain function or make me sleepy.  A good balance.,F,35,8  months,4/18/2005,Skelaxin
273, 1, Neck and  Shoulder muscle pain,I developed hives on my neck_ chest_ and back. This was after one 800 mg dose.  My doctor said that allergic reaction that was so localized was probably the result of being exposed to paint while painting the interior of my house.  I waited a few days_ and took another pill. The hives were even more severe.,I observed no other effects or results.,M,62,2  days,2/10/2005,Skelaxin
274, 4, chronic whiplash symptoms,slight drowsiness,I've taken it intermitently_ only as needed. It has helped in getting the muscles to loosen up a bit.

I began seeing colored light flashes after chemo & radiation (dec 2001)_ although I had 10 years of No seizures until last week. I took the skelaxin for 12 days with no side effect.
