0, 3, IgG4 related disease,Sleeplessness_ numbness in hands and feet_ insomnia_ periodic shortness of breath_ cramping in feet_ dizziness_ moon face_ weight gain.,Drug is easy to take. Side effects less easy to manage. Weight gain and moon face not attractive. Doctor said side effects should go away once my taper schedule is over.  Kidney function affected but not sure if CDK is compromised because of drug or disease.,F,70,7  months30mg 1X D,7/17/2016,Deltasone
1, 1, Sinus infection,Insomnia severe anxiety blurry vision heart palpitations sweaty hands trouble concentrating,After taking this medication the second day I stopped after I couldn't sleep the whole night. I ended up in the ER for severe insomnia. I was prescribed ativan to go to sleep. Do not take this medication horrible side effects,F,25,7  days,6/16/2016Email,Deltasone

3, 1, i was taking 4 inflamation in neck,Strong heart palpitation really fast. Shortness of breath. Mild chest pain from heart rate so fast. Weakness and dry eyes. Feeling of panic but controllable. Heavyness in the chest. Increased thirst.,,F,42,1  days1,4/21/2014,Deltasone
4, 5, Rash/hives,I was given this on a taper_ 8 1rst day_ 7 2nd day etc. I had a reaction to bactrum and neosporin_ and my body was covered in both hives and a rash that looked like a chemical burn. Granted I am only two days into a 7 day prescription_ but I've had no bad side effects. Even if I did_ I couldn't function with the rashes (it was all over my lips and tongue_neck_ chin_ hands_ arms_ knees_ stomach and back) and would choose to continue this. A TON of the inflammation had gone_ as well as about 60% of the itching (which was previously unbearable). I have noticed I am very thirsty_ but it might be a side effect of the Benadryl I had taken for two weeks before taking this.  I might also be tired_ but again_ that might be due to not sleeping for weeks bc of the rashes. I will also add I usually am really sensitive to drugs_ most do give me bad effects_ and I don't drink bc my stomach can't even handle one drink.,,F,31,2  days,3/21/2014,Deltasone
5, 4, tmj/ear pain and discomfort,heartburn afterwards...take with breakfast or lunch...otherwise ocassionally a little more easily irritated but that's about it.,seemed to help with my tmj pain and myofacial pains.,M,39,7  days30mg 3X D,7/12/2011,Deltasone
6, 4, persistent cough_ rib fracture/pain,almost none. maybe some dry mouth and leg cramps_ but hardly noticeable!,i was terrified of taking prednisone. you hear so many horror stories about even the smallest of doses and the shortest of treatments. i am SO HAPPY i took a chance and did it--it helped my cough and somewhat lessened the pain from fracturing my ribs while coughing. i still need a big dose of ibuprofen for my rib pain_ but the prednisone_ after 4 days_ seems to have settled my cough and opened my airway. there were almost NO side effects_ and i really mean NONE. i have serious health probs and am amazed that someone like me had no problems with this drug.,F,37,4  days40mgs 1X D,4/28/2011Email,Deltasone
7, 4, Sudden hearing loss,weight gain_ acne_ moon face_ joint pain_ insomnia_ frequent erections at first_ followed by a impotence and complete loss of libido.,"I loved it and hated it. I had sudden sensory hearing loss and received a very high dose of 80mg per day for a month before tapering down in 10mg increments each week after that. It worked within weels but with side effects like amazing weight gain from a trim 165 lbs to a soft 185lbs in a few weeks. I had terrible acne on my face and upper back_ my face was red and swollen and_ yes round like the moon. I had the beginnings of the 'buffalo hump"" just as I tapered off. The first week_ I got erections all the time_ like a high schooler. By the next week_ that was a thing of the past. I had no sex drive and couldn't do anything about it if I did. I also had trouble sleeping. I'd get on the computer_ read or watch TV all through the night. After I finally tapered back and off the drug I slowly returned to normal. The weight took a year to lose. This is powerful stuff. I'd use it again to save my hearing.",M,30,3  months80mg 1X D,6/2/2010,Deltasone
8, 1, allergic reaction,fast heart rate_ shortness of breath_ paranoia_ insomnia.,The drug worked at getting rid of my allergic reaction_ but it really wigged me out.  I was supposed to take it 7 days but i only made it until day 6.  My symptoms grew progressively worse as the days went on.  By day 6 i was too scared to continue. All of my reactions were listed on the side effects section except one.  Ive looked online and asked around but i cant find anyone else who had this experience.  I play music as a hobby and was doing a charity show at a college.  I was really wigged out that night and i swear i remember watching myself play that show! I dont use illegal drugs or anything so it had to be the prescription. I stopped taking it after that night. It did kill the allergic reaction though.,M,27,7  days 1X D,6/1/2010,Deltasone
9, 1, Colitis,Couldn't sleep the whole seven months I took it. Got high blood pressure and never had any problems with that before.,Constant hunger and even though I am a slim guy I gained a lot of weight. Never had a problem with my weight before. Not even around holidays. Got acne and my face got real large and swollen. Was losing my hair. I looked very sick. My wife was embarrassed to go places with me_ she stopped asking. Can say for certain we wouldn't be married if she were just meeting me today. You learn things about people on this drug.,M,39,7  months,1/27/2010,Deltasone

11, 1, UC,Extremely blurry vision. Extremely dry eyes. Vision went from -3.25 to -8.50_ eyes became dry so can no longer wear contacts. This means huge glasses even when I pay extra for thin lenses. Prednisone basically prematurely ages your entire body. The reason why old people have so many health problems is because when you age you naturally experience the things prednisone does to a person. Hair loss. Thinned skin. Dry skin. Dry scalp. Dry mouth. Stretch marks.,Knowing what I know about UC now_ I would never take prednisone. I also would not put blind faith in my gastroenterologist. It's painful to think back at how inept he was. He even would give me rectal exams without a glove and then when I looked at him (because that is a weird thing to do) he would say_ Oops_ I must've forgot. It's like: if you were giving someone a rectal exam_ wouldn't that be the FIRST thing you think of? Personally I would use several. I really think the typical person who becomes a gastroenterologist is either a pervert or someone who's very greedy but could not manage to become a specialist in another field. Usually when you hear about doctors who rape_ sexually assault_ or commit sex crimes and abuse against their patients_ they're gastroenterologists_ and more often than not_ the ones from third world countries.,F,19, ,12/18/2009,Deltasone
12, 1, UC (misdiagnosed),Depression_ rage_ thoughts of suicide_ cystic acne_ acne scars_ blotchy skin on face_ red eyes_ SEVERE dry eye (my eyes barely have any moisture at all now; my eyelids actually stick to my eyes)_ dry mouth_ sweating_ high blood pressure_ thyroid problem_ moon face. Before_ when I heard about side effects of drugs_ I thought about things like headache_ GI symptoms maybe--not these sorts of things can cause--and prednisone can do much more this! What is outrageous is that I've had doctors go out of their way to tell me minor symptoms for safe drugs--but in this case my doctor simply lied to me (to get me to comply) and told me this very dangerous drug was actually safe....,Anyone who tells you pred is safe is nuts_ lazy_ or simply doesn't care about you. This might not be a bad drug to take if you're 80 years old_ but if you're young_ prednisone could really_ really mess up your life. I wish I had known that...it really_ really messed up mine. I was told it was safe (by my doctor at the University of Iowa_ Anne Sullivan); at that time I thought you could trust doctors. I was wrong. She proved that to me. I had perfect skin_ now I have blotchy_ scarred skin--which is a great thing to have when you're 18_ right? (I was also put on Imuran_ had a neoplasm develop on my face_ so also have large surgical scar on a very prominent portion of my face.) I used to actually get compliments on my complexion_ now people just wonder what happened to me. Turns out I didn't even have UC--had nothing seriously wrong with me. (Advice: If you're diagnosed with UC or CD_ definitely_ definitely get a second opinion_ particularly if you're diagnosed at the University of Iowa),M,18,7  months,11/27/2009,Deltasone

14, 3, Over active immune system,Nervousness_ Weight-gain_ bloating,My immune system was having some kind of hyperreactivity response and it wouldn't stop so I was given prednisone to calm it down.  It supressed my immune system and the hyperreactivity response stopped_ but in the meantime I was a nervous wreck_ I gained weight and I got bloated in the face.  It was awful.  Unless a doctor told me that I really needed it_ I wouldn't take it again.,F,37,3  months,11/8/2009,Deltasone

I do not like the side effects_ but there is no choice. Have been on for 10 mos_ weaned down to 13 1/2mg from the 60; possibility will be on for rest of my life.

20, 1, Crohn's,Clinical depression_ thoughts of suicide_ anxiety_ cystic acne_ scars_ skin atrophy_ hair loss_ yellow skin_ thyroid disease,I had no idea any drug--legal or illegal--could be so dangerous. My doctor_ Bushra Sulieman_ gave this to me_ smiling_ and said I'd take it for a few weeks and be back to normal. It didn't work. And its side effects have been devastating. Some are permanent. Skin on my face thinned and atrophied. I also have scars on my face. They'll never go away. Facial scars are devastating to a person's body image. I don't even want to leave the house.,F,17,7  months,12/7/2008,Deltasone
21, 1, Severe SLE (Lupus),Where do I start ? This drug has completely ruined my life. Had mega amounts of steroids over 3 years. Still suffering from the terrible effects as the body tries to adjust back to normal. Severe weakness_ severe anxiety_ severe tremors_ complete loss of sexual function_ rage aggressiveness_ extreme sweating_ unable to think_ severe weight gain and the list goes on.,Was prescribed steroids along with other drugs because of life threatening organ complications. All steroids do_ is suppress the bodies natural inflammatory process/response. They don't cure or heal anything. Dr's need to make sure_ that when prescribing these drugs_ patients are fully aware of the side effects. I was never fully informed. Now once the hormonal effect goes_ my organs will fail. I would rather die from severe sle rather than ever take steroids again.,M,32,3  years,10/15/2008,Deltasone

Go here to read what the Mayo Clinic has to say about the psychiatric effects of corticosteroids: http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/inside.asp?AID=4187&UID= Here are some excerpts: ""It is important that clinicians in all specialties become aware of the potential psychiatric adverse effects associated with corticosteroids and explain these effects to their patients.""""The corticosteroid dosage is the most important risk factor for the development of psychiatric symptoms."" ""Psychiatric disturbances can occur at any point during corticosteroid treatment_ including almost immediately after initiation and even after cessation of treatment."" ""Patients should be evaluated for any suggestion of suicidality."" ""Corticosteroid-induced psychiatric disturbances are common and include mania_ depression_ psychot","""Educating patients about potential adverse effects and asking about such effects at each patient encounter can enhance early intervention for adverse corticosteroid-induced psychiatric reactions."" ""Although a powerful therapeutic option_ corticosteroids are associated with serious adverse effects_ both physiologic and psychiatric."" ""In our literature review_ we found that the potential psychiatric adverse effects of corticosteroids span a symptom spectrum from subtle mood changes to full-blown affective syndromes and frank psychosis.""""Cognitive deficits_ particularly declarative or verbal memory deficits_ have been well documented during both long- and short-term corticosteroid therapy."" ""More severe cognitive impairment consistent with delirium or dementia has also been described.""",F,, ,9/27/2008,Deltasone

The doctors I go to now don't even prescribe it_ they think it's evil too and aren't so cold hearted to give it to their patients.

24, 1, Crohn's Disease,Prednisone gave me Cushing's Syndrome - which for guys means a lot of bad things_ like Erectile Dysfunction_ weight gain_ high blood pressure_ hypertension_ depression and anxiety_ thin_ fragile skin that bruises and scars easily; facial flushing; rounding of face; pink and purple stretch marks; slowed healing of cuts; infections and even insect bites; muscle weakness; and acne.,This stuff is worse than drinking battery acid.

He said that prednisone's effects are long-lasting and you can't undo the damage. Even for the people who think they didn't have side effects_ they most likely did and still do. For example_ prednisone reduces your ability to heal for the rest of your life.,F,26,4  months,8/20/2008,Deltasone

Headaches.,Before I took prednisone_ I had perfect skin_ and_ besides an occasional pimple_ never really had much acne. Prednisone changed that; it ruined my skin_ and_ as a result_ destroyed my self-esteem. People I haven't seen since taking prednisone don't even recognize me. My eyes_ from prednisone and all the other drugs_ barely produce tears at all anymore. My eyes are so dry_ I can't wear contacts. The whites of my eyes are almost entirely red. My skin is still yellow. People stare and ask about it; pretty embarrassing. I have lost faith in doctors completely. I've only been to one doctor about my yellow skin. He mentioned the possibility of it being drug-induced hepatitis. I loved my life_ but_ because of this drug_ I hate my life. It didn't even help my disease. I wish my doctors had told me about the side effects and other treatment options--I found a strict diet and probiotics to be more effective than prednisone and all the other drugs combined.,M,19,6  months,7/26/2008,Deltasone
