0, 5, Parkinson's Disease,I can't think of any because the benefits were so great_ I didn't even think about side effects.  However_ my pharmacist and doctor both warned me that it was an MAO inhibitor_ so I was extremely careful about drug interactions and my diet.,By the time I started taking it_ a generic was out and it was simply called selegeline; I hope this is the brand we're discussing.  It helped the tremor in my left hand within a few days and the stiffness in my legs.  Taking sinemet caused the most dramatic reduction of my PD symptoms_ but selegeline caused the second most dramatic improvement.  The doctors and I were amazed.  I've since switched to Azilect_ which is also an MAO inhibitor_ as there's a possibility that it may slow down the progress of the PD.  I've not noticed any side effects with it.  Since starting the selegeline and replacing it with Azilect_ I've been able to cut back on my sinemet.,F,52,7  months,2/7/2007,Eldepryl
