0, 3, crohnd,Similar to prednisone.  Anxiety. Insomnia. Hunger. Rage.  Moody.  But these are milder than pred.  It does not cause nausea_ acid reflux_ gerd_ or other stomach problems as it does not release in the stomach; because of this reason it is most definitely worth trying.,It is very expensive in America.,M,41,2  weeks6mg,6/21/2015,Entocort ec
1, 4, Microscopic colitis,I took 3 mg a day of this for maintenance_ up to 9 mg a day (3 mg three times a day) for flare-ups_ for 10 years. In the eighth year i developed extreme thinning of the skin and easy bruising - any bump turned into a huge red or purple mark. Went off it to find that_ right now at least_ condition is in remission and controllable with Imodium or Pepto Bismol. Bruising has ceased_ skin still thin. However_ as soon as I went off it my arthritis_ which had been very mild_ grew more severe_ and the pollen allergies I thought had gone away came back with a vengeance. Sigh.,This was a miracle drug for me. Asacol had no effect whatsoever and plugging myself up with 12 tabs a day of Pepto Bismol was beyond miserable. If the colitis flares again I will go back on it_ perhaps trying 3 mg every other day. 3 mg seems to be the lowest possible dose as it comes in capsules.,F,60,10  years3 to 9 mg 1X D,7/20/2013Email,Entocort ec
2, 3, Crohn's,"None for the first several months.  After taking it for 9+ months_ I started to notice ""prednisone-type"" side effects... slow and steady weight gain (up to 20 pounds now)_ mood swings_ etc.  My Dr. then informed me that this has been happening to many people who stay on it for an extended period.",Entecort REALLY helps my symptoms at the 9mg dose but when I was trying to wean_ I found I was having a resurgance of symptoms on the 6mg and had to go back to the 9mg.  We're going to try a new drug now.,F,32,1  years9 MG 1X D,3/2/2011,Entocort ec
3, 5, Microscopic colitis,None.,Entocort has been very effective for me in controlling symptoms Microscopic Colitis (Collagenous). Initially the dose was 9mg. per day and that dose was gradually reduced to 3mg./day. This medication has been effective for me_ where the 5ASAs  -- Asacol and Pentasa  both failed miserably. In fact_ I can maintain good copntrol for weeks at 3mg. every other day with  some assistance from a gluten REDUCED diet.,F,73,2  years3mg 1X D,3/1/2011Email,Entocort ec
4, 3, Crohn's,None that I can tell,If you have Crohn's symptoms exclusively in your colon_ this is made for you. I get problems from mouth to backside_ doesn't seem to be helping anything north of my large intestine. Not helping my diahrea (sp?)_ or severe pain in my stomach.,M,40,3  months6mg 1X D,9/28/2010,Entocort ec
5, 4, Crohns,Nothing I can pinpoint on the drug.  I have the usual Crohns stuff_ like arthritis and fatigue_ no matter what drug I'm on.,This drug has helped.  It seems to be more effective than purinethol or asacol was for me.  I have occasional bad flares and some symptoms while on it.  If I watch my diet and stress levels_ then I have mild symptoms.  I had more flares when I was on the other meds.,F,33,3  years3 pills 1X D,6/12/2010Email,Entocort ec
