0, 4, Prevent Pregnancy_ Lighten Periods,Weight gain of about 5-10 pounds_ moodiness/crying for a couple months_ breast growth_ lower sex drive_ vaginal dryness,I don't totally mind the weight gain_ as I hadn't been exercising lately anyway_ and it wasn't a whole lot. I have not had cravings for fast food at all. For the first couple months_ I was pretty moody and easy to upset_ but I attribute that mostly to it being a tumultuous time in my life. Things have smoothed out recently_ and I feel great. My breasts are definitely bigger_ though I originally attributed that to weight gain. However_ I've begun working out again and the boobs have stayed_ so that's nice. I suppose my sex drive_ though low to start with_ is kind of lower_ and I have to use lubricant for comfort. However_ it's not a huge problem to me_ so all in all_ I'm a fan. I mean_ I've taken it every day and haven't gotten pregnant.,F,20,9  months 1X D,5/19/2016,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

3, 2, Contraceptive,I started taking ortho ovum 777 when I got  together with my fiance (4 years ago) when I was a junior in high school and started becoming sexually active.  I noticed weight gain slightly about 5 pounds but my diet hasn't changed and it seems the longer I take it the more I crave.  I crave pop and fast food_ greasy foods like a mad man.  I have gained probably 30 pounds in the past year because of it.  I stopped taking it a week ago and I have noticed that I sleep a lot better and do not have to constantly eat or want food.  I noticed that my sex drive wasn't great while I was on it.  I am 21 years old and so is my boyfriend so I feel that it is kind of important.  I need to get my birth control changed though ASAP.,I do not recommend.,F,21,4  years 1X D,2/18/2015,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

Also every time i start the dark orange section of the pill cycle i break out horribly. I just woke up with it the first morning after the first orange pill. I hadn't experienced acne like that since back in middle school. I also lack the motivation and confidence i had prior to this birth control pill. Before this contraceptive_ I was taking Loralyn 3mg birth control for 2yrs and it was AMAZING but then insurance stopped covering it (almost $90 a month..prob why it worked so well). I highly recommend that versus this drug.,,F,18,2  months1x day,4/7/2013Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

14, 1, PMS_ cramps and Migraines,Nausea_ weight gain_ SEVERE depression and anxiety_ rage_ extreme fatigue_ intense cravings for fast food_ uncontrollable sobbing,My doctor thought this pill might help with my severe cramps and menstrual migraines.  Within 2 days I was nauseous all the time but the worst part was that I am usually a positive_ social_ happy_ motivated and active person and I felt heavy and exhausted and I was so depressed that I started having suicidal thoughts and felt completely hopeless.  I gave it a few more days_ hoping my body would adjust_ and had to stop because I felt like I didn't want to live anymore and my outlook and perspective were purely pessimistic.  I was extremely anxious_ my heart was racing and I felt nervous and uncomfortable and didn't want to leave my house or talk to anyone.  Also I eat a micronutrient-dense diet_ always healthy_ don't eat grains and suddenly I had crazy obsessive cravings for McDonalds and Taco Bell_ neither of which I've visited in about a decade!

During that time_ on the third week of the pill (highest dose)_ I would feel an increase in anxiety_ extreme vaginal dryness and I got a pretty bad yeast infection.  This happened twice in a row.

18, 3, Regulation,In March 2012 I developed severe blood clots in my lungs.,I had experience extreme discomfort in my right buttocks area around the beginning of March to the point that I could not sit. I pushed it to the back of my mind like I do everything else and went on with my life. About two weeks after that the rain decreased but moved up the right side of my body. The pain got paralyzing. I could not laugh or take deep breathes. I felt a pain in my chest put also my back. I could move and stretch without any changes in pain. I went to the walk-in and they treated me for muscle-skeletal discomfort. that night the pain reached it's peak. I could not move so my friend dressed me and drove me upstate to the emergency room. 6 hours later they decide to test me for PE (pulmonary embolism) and I soon found out it was positive. I had 3 blood clots that traveled through my right lung_ through my heart_ and lodged in my right lung. one blood clot remained in my right lung. I was in the hospital for 10 days. I am now 4 months into my recovery and it has been such a struggle. Besides all this_ being on Ortho Novum 777 was great. my periods were amazing; very light and short. I knew exactly when I would get it right after a month of being on the pill. Even all my PMS symptoms were gone.

33, 4, birthcontrol,First few days I felt nauseous and bloated but went away within a week. It shortened my period to 3 days and is light as well. Increased my appetite so that would explain why I've gained a few pounds not much though.,Before I started taking birth control the first thing that worried me was increased acne and gaining weight. It actually helped my acne clear up but I still get a  pimple here and there. It did increase my appetite..instead of feeling hungry when I should_ I feel REALLY hungry and get cranky if I don't eat. I would say I gained maybe like 5lbs but that's also lack of eating healthy and not working out as much as I used to. so with a healthy diet and exercise-you should be good.

44, 5, birth control,none,Been on this pill since age 19; briefly switched to Loestrin for 8 months due to sudden irregular bleeding and diagnosed with a uterine fibroid. Had the fibroid removed_ then switched back to 7/7/7. What I like about this pill is how the different levels of hormones mimicks the body's natural fluctuation; hence very few side effects. Unlike the newer mono-phasic (single dose) pills which seems to produce negative side effects (I had no periods/irregular bleeding_ mood swings and hair loss w/ Loestrin) Every body is different; this pill works great for me. Regular and timely periods. Just be sure to take good quality pharmaceutical grade multivitamins while on any birth control pill. I've often read that pills reduce the body's absorption of certain nutrients. No issues with weight on this pill either. However on the Loestrin I dropped 10 pounds. I know many docs prescribe the lower dose mono-phasic pills to older women (35+); but I think i'll stick to this classic formula.,F,37,17  years 1X D,5/19/2010,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

I have since changed my oral contraceptive medicine to Lybrel_ which is the first FDA approved_ 365 day hormonal birth control with NO placebos.  All of my unpleasant side effects have since disappeared_ I'm thrilled to feel like myself again.  While Lybrel is a little expensive_ it's worth it.,F,28,13  months,9/14/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
55, 2, Birth Control,Headaches and some shortness of breath.,"I took the pill throughout my 20's for birth control with no problems - when I went off of it to become pregnant I didn't ovulate and had to go on medication.  After my first child I didn't go back on it and ovulated fine and got pregnant after having my period for 2 months (nursed for a year therefore I didn't get pregnant that soon).  Just recently I went back on it for BC (believe it was the generic) and was getting bad headaches and some shortness of breath.  I talked to by OB-Gyn and went off it - I had ""break through"" bleeding (a period) a few days later.  I am now at the 31st day after that time_ still no period and not pregnant - not sure if this pill does something to mess me up.",F,34,10  years,8/8/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
56, 3, to prevent pregnancy,at first_ ortho novum 7-7-7 was working great for me. but then i ran out of pills_ and was refused more pills by family planning for a week. after i got back on them_ i've experienced heavy bloating and gas on almost a nightly basis_ i've gained 10 pounds_ and i'm more prone to sadness and depression.,,F,18,5  months,8/4/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
57, 5, to avoid unwanted critters,none really. probably some weight gain though hard to say cuz i do like the kibble,i am actually on the 777-28 but i guess they are about the same. have been on them for 20 years. i think it is a reliable product if taken as DIRECTED! I was thinking of a Mirena but after all the negative press i have read I think i will stay with what works for me. i recommend the 777-28's as long as you are willing to remember them everyday and are willing to give your body a month or so to adjust.,F,39,20  years,7/12/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

Every time I go off it for whatever reason_ and start back on_ I spend the first 1-3 months feeling rather like I have stomach flu. It's AWFUL_ but it does go away over time.,F,24,10  years,6/28/2009Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
59, 4, Prevent pregnancy / ovarian cysts,When I was 14 my doctor found cysts on my ovaries and wanted to put me on BCC to get rid of them.  I was first put on Ortho Tri-cyclen and gained about 10 lbs._ so my doctor tried me on 7/7/7.  My pain from the cysts went away after 3 or 4 months. I have really regular light periods and hardly any cramps.  I have been dealing with depression and low libdo for as long as I can remember_ it may be related to this drug.  I've been on 7/7/7 for 14 years and I think next month I'm going to quit taking it to see if this goes away.,,F,27,14  years,5/11/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
60, 4, Prevent Pregnancy,Over the years I have experienced weight gain not sure if the BCP is contributing to this issue.  It has been more difficult to lose weight in the past few years.  After several years of taking this pill_ I did begin to have hair growth on my breast and in the more recent years hair growth on my face.  I have periodic acne breakouts on my face but I am getting older so I am not sure how much I can contribute to the Ortho-Novum or is it just that I am getting older.  I have no obvious side effects that I can absolutely without a doubt contribute to the BCP.  I have experienced heavier bleeding within the past few years but I too afraid to change pills as my Dr. has suggested.,My insurance no longer pays for Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 which costs me approximately $55 per pack.  The Necon 7/7/7 only costs $3 per pack but I am afraid to change to the Necon.  I would like to stop taking the birth control but feel that condoms won't work well in a marriage.  Considered having a tubiligation but afraid of surgery.  Trying figure out what to do but afraid of getting pregnant.  Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 has prevented pregnancy for me all these years.  Choosing a BCP that's right for your body is very important_ take the time to research and find what's best for you.,F,40,21  years,4/6/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

I do not know of any family members who have a history of gall bladder problems. Just 4 months after taking the necon birth control pills_(to help with extreme heavy bleeding) I suddenly had an acute gallbladder attack which resulted in having it removed.  I have since read that estrogen is a possible culprit in gallbladder problems. hmmmmm...I recommend finding another solution!,F,48,4  months,3/30/2009Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
62, 5, BC_ regulate period_ shorter cyle,It took my body a good 7 months to adjust to this pill. Every month 2 weeks into the pack_ my breasts would ache for a good 7 days and I'd have spotting. I was about to give up on BC pills altogether_ then the side effects went away. Now I have no pain_ barely any cramps_ and a 1 day period. I've also lost weight that I'd gained on a previous pill_ 13 pounds approximately. Totally worth the pain of adjusting to it. My hair_ skin and body are totally normal.,I've had issues with side effects from BC for years. I've always taken mono-phasic pills_ but as a last resort I decided to try a tri-phasic pill. Even though the first 7 months were hell_ it's been perfect ever since. If you have issues with breast pain and spotting_ switching to a different type of pill like I did might help you. I also found that limiting my daily intake of vitamin C to be a huge factor_ as some multi vitamins contain high doses_ and can actually cause spotting on BC pills. Apparently some women need more than 3 months to adjust to a new type of pill_ give it some time and hopefully things will work.,F,33,1  years,3/16/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

64, 4, Bad monthly's_ Prevent Pregnancy,Occasionally I will come down with a very sudden urge of diarrhea mixed with nausea. As soon as I relieve myself the feeling goes away. I assume the pill has caused this to happen. Other than that_ I have had absolutely no negative side effects. It's helped to regulate my period_ and the bleeding has been lighter.,I would recommend this pill.,F,19,1  months,3/13/2009Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
65, 5, Major cramps and irregularity,At first none. It worked great and took away my horrible cramps that I had as a teen. As the first few years went by I developed depression_ anxiety_ oily hair_ mood swings and weight gain. I though nothing of it. Thinking it was just me and stress. Then as I got older I started getting vaginal dryness_ headaches_ fatigue_ more weight gain_ a sore near my clit_ no sex drive and always tired. I talked to my GYN just last month and she said that necon 777 is a very high dose and that's why I was having so many side effects so she started me on Yaz. I have been on Yaz for 4 weeks now and feel great. I felt alittle blah for the first 2 weeks but now I feel great. I feel much happier. My chronic stomach aches are going away and I don't feel as depressed or stressed as I did. Not sure how long it will take to get the necon completely out of my system but hopefully more of the side effects will go away. Hopefully the Yaz won't cause too many side effects if any.,Necon 777 was great for atleast 10 yrs but now I'm thankful I'm off of it and praying Yaz will be better for me.,F,35,16  years,1/18/2009Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
66, 2, period regulation/cramp reduction,Severely increased acne-cystic acne to bootIncreased headachesIncreased length of flowPain in upper thigh_ which I'm concerned could be the start of a blood clot.,I swapped to this BC pill about 6 months ago from Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ which I was on for a couple of years.  The OTC made my skin gorgeous_ but also added 10 pounds to my already overweight frame ( mostly in the boob area ) and caused heavy clotting ( very unpleasant_ and extra painful ).  Although my period overall was very short.Unfortunately_ while the Ortho Novum 7/7/7 has rid me of the clotting issues_ it has turned my skin into the nightmare it was when I was 16 years old ( 21 years ago ).  It started slowly with increased oiliness in the first month or two_ and now the multitude of recurring blackheads and cystic acne are too much for me to handle.  At the very least with the Ortho Tri-Cyclen_ the discomfort lasted only a day or two each month.  This current all month long discomfort with the increasing skin issues_ and increased severity of headaches/migraine/dizziness issues_ which I am prone to_ is not cool.It seems the progestin in Ortho Novum 7/7/7 just doesn't agree,F,37,6  months,1/12/2009Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

I have been on orthotricyclene which made me have the same symptoms i described above_ but also to have vomiting and larger breasts.  Which would be ok_ if i wasnt already a DD.  I was on yaz and lost my hearing.

I've gained weight despite being an avid gym goer and healthy eater. I'm sure some of the weight gain is from the fluid retention these pills seem to be causing.

I feel as I get older I get more sleepy than usual. My weight has boosted with age_ or maybe just b/c I eat more and less athletic but I'm not overweight. I do plan on getting off BCP b/c i am wanting a baby now. I do recommend Ortho Novum 7/7/7-28 It's great. Sometimes I'm offered Necon but I choose not too buy it b/c just a fear of trying something ""NEW"". Not my cup of tea.

I decided to go back on Necon 777 and have had nothing but problems now.  I've gained weight while trying to lose weight_  Low sex drive_ depression_ breast tenderness_ and sick to my stomach.

Even at that_ the worst thing I can say is that I become slightly more irritable_ but that might simply be due to PMS!,This pill did indeed clear up my acne - in fact_ with far more efficacy than tetracycline!

The instructions were NOT clear at all...it said to start so many days after my period...well I hadnt had one in two years so the pharmacist told her to start taking at day one.   After starting it must have forced a period as I started bleeding again.  My old cycle was a breeze...2 maybe three days.

My first and only experience with oral contraceptives_ so I don't have much to compare it with. I usually don't flow at all during menses_ maybe a one-day spotting every other month. I'm told this is normal on Ortho for prolonged periods of time (and good with regard to endometriosis remaining dormant and non-threatening to my state of fertility). Somewhere along the line for insurance reasons no doubt I began taking NECON_ the generic version. I do not even recall this switch_ hence no differences were noted. Severe cramps and PMS prevails_ the curse of being female. Ibuprofen (600 mg) enables functionability (never take ibuprofen on an empty stomach_ even if it's just a cracker_ you need the buffer!)

91, 4, to prevent pregnancy and pms,"I loved this pill for 15 years.  However_ I am stopping the pill because I'm realizing the progetin in it has caused tremendous hair thinning over the years.  Also_ I realize now it is likely responsible for my ""mound-like"" acne on my chin. This pill has andryognous effects due to the progestin.  Were it not for this_ I wouldn't quit taking it.  I can't take the generic of this either.  It made me feel sick as did ortho tricyclen lo.  I am on day one of Yasmin-but nauseous and my thinking feels foggy.  However_ the progestin in Yasmin is unique as it has no androgynous effects as does Ortho-Novum 7/7/7.

92, 5, Birth Control,To this day_ I usually get a little nauseated during the first week of each pack (nothing major_ but worth noting).  Other than that_ I've enjoyed this brand a lot more than others (I've previously been on Estrostep_ Trivora_ Loestrin_ and Levlite).  I've had to switch brands a lot because I used to experience pains in my legs (which I'm guessing was due to the hormones because I've never smoked and am an average weight of 125 lbs).  With Ortho Novum_ though_ I've never experienced these pains_ so I'm sticking to this brand for as long as I can!  One major negative side effect worth mentioning is that I was off this pill for one month because I ran out and was out of the country.  During that month_ I had the worse acne I had ever seen in my life.  This was really shocking because I had never even had a zit before_ and here I was with really large_ deep_ cyst-like acne.  Even though I experienced that negative effect_ while I've been ON the pill_ I've never had anything like that h,With this pill_ I haven't notice any mood swings_ weight gain_ or other physical changes.

93, 5, Birth Control/Help with Acne/Cramps,I am actually on Ortho-Novum 7/7/7-28 but it wasn't an option to select that specific pill.  I love this pill. I have been on Ortho Tri Cyclen_ Ortho Tri Cyclen-Lo_ Ortho Evra ( the patch ) as well. Both Ortho Tri Cyclen pills caused me to gain some weight ( about 10lbs each time ) although they both made me extremely moody. Bonus was my naturally small breasts grew to a lovely full B cup. Out of what I thought was going to be convenience_ I switched to the patch. That was a mistake for me. It often folded over in the middle of the patch and stuck together over the course of a few days_ it collected lint from clothing so I had that annoying 'band-aid' fuzz_ stuck around it and on really hot days when I got sweaty_ it would literally slowly slide down from where I had it stuck ( I generally placed it on my bum or pelvic area so it was easier to hide. I didn't want to broadcast to everyone I was on BC by wearing it on my arm ) My gyno put me on Ortho-Novum 7/7/7-28 and my usual 6-8 day H,I had my gyno appointment today and for insurance reasons she is trying to get me onto Alesse. I adore my Ortho-Novum so much I am scared to switch. I am going to fight to stay on my ortho. My best advice_ shop around. Follow your gut.

94, 4, Birth control/regulate periods,I was 16 when I started on Ortho-Novum 7/7/7. Very light spotting rarely during the first few months. Then no problems whatsoever until around age 24 when I smoked infrequently_ had some spotting & break-through bleeding. I quit smoking altogether_ no problems. Last 6 mos_ I started having break-through bleeding occurring closest to the last week of the pill_ my libido lessened & I started to get moodier. Dr said my uterus may have changed & my body was responding neg to the different levels of hormones each week. She put me on Ortho-Cept 28. Same dose each week. Only on day 2 of that.,This bc worked well for me for a number of years. I had predictable mood changes_ didn't gain any weight_ & haven't been pregnant. I would have stayed on it but it makes sense that our bodies change & therefore respond differently after time. I'm also lucky_ my body isn't sensitive to medicines.

I switched to Loestrin 1/20 after two years when I began experiencing extreme moodiness which I attributed to the pill_ but later realized that mere life situations were causing my moodiness_ I'm quite sure it had nearly nothing to do with the pill.  HATED Loestrin (NO sex drive) and came back to my old friend Necon recently_ moods have been normal_ sex drive is back to normal.  I shall never stray again!,F,20,3  years,6/9/2007,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

97, 4, Lessen Cramps,I've been taking the necon 777 for 4 months and it has me feeling so jolly sometimes_ it's almost unbelievable_ then comes the lows of mood swings. I did gain a cup size though. My sex drive is at an all time low. I had really bad dryness in the first 2 weeks_ then that sorted itself out. All in all my periods are a bit lighter though I expected it to be a lot lighter_ but since this my first try on any pill_ I have to be thankful.My PMS monster has toned down. I'd say give this pill a try_ give it a few weeks to settle down though.,Slightly lighter period_ . Lighter period =less pain_ a plus any day....,F,30,4  months,5/11/2007,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

Maybe ill be like one said and have a 1-2 day cycle. I take my pills regulary_ and on time. So i hope I am not pregnant. I have had an extremely low sex drive...and my boyfriend blames it on my mental state. Also I have experienced painful cramps (as i have always done without the pills)_ and heavily bleeding at first. Obviously Not anymore.,I would suggest you find birth control that works for you. Some birth control makes you sick_ or have extreme spotting. Others work just fine. But So far so good.,F,17,2  months,5/10/2007Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
99, 5, ,I've been on Ortho -Novum 7/7/7-28 since I was 17. I was placed on it b/c i had a very irregular period. I am 26 now_ so it's been about 9 years. I have literally had NO side effects to date. My periods are regulated_ I have never been pregnant_ and my periods are normal. about 3 to 5 days long_ minor cramping_ and of course_ a little bit emotional right before the period starts_ but other than that i can't complain. i really think that the side effects of a few cramps and a little emotional would probably happen no matter what b/c i am a female. i think ortho 777 has been around for a long time compared to other bc pills... i think that each woman reacts differently to each bc pill. you just have to try one until you find one that suits you. obviously_ from these postings_ other women have had trouble with this pill. i luckily_ found the one that works for me the first time. it sucks some of us have to keep trying one until we find one that works.,,F,26,9  years,5/3/2007,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

I developed the blood clot in August_ but did not now what it was.  I started have severe pain in my calf in Jan of this year.  I went to the doctor_ but she told me I was probably a cyst behind my knee.  I went back 2 weeks later and they did a doppler of my leg and found a blood clot that starts in the middle of my calf and ends above my knee.  I have never smoked either.,F,24, ,3/6/2007,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

I almost died_ and am lucky they expect me to make a full recovery. My clot will take 6 months to a year to dissolve with the help of blood thinners. I saw a hematologist and he is CERTAIN it was the pill. My blood clots normally now. He told me all hormonal forms of birth control change the coaguluation of your blood.",I'm not saying this will happen to everybody. Just beware of the risks. Go see a doctor immediately if you suddenly start to experience migraines. 2 days in a row of these headaches were my only warning signs before things got really critical.

(Just as the woman mentioned previously.) As soon as I started taking the pill again the acne went away. My sex drive did lessen however I can't entire blame that on the pill_ it may just have something to do with age and experience.

113, 1, Birth control,None while I was on it. I had very minor acne before taking it (I was taking this for birth control). Two weeks after going off of it_ I woke up one morning to find  6 cystic blemishes on my face. This drug gave me cystic acne (I never had a cyst before in my life) which I am still suffering with. It also caused hirsutism (didn't have that either) and I never had a regular period in the years I've since I stopped. I went from a normal 28 day cycle pre Ortho Novum to a 21 days cycle and sometimes a 14 day cycle. If I could turn back the clock_ I never would have taken it. It completely messed up my hormones and my skin.,If you are taking this to control your acne_ if for any reason you have to stop_ be prepared to have a much worse case of acne than before you started.,F,50,12  years,12/7/2006,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

My normal pimples turned into giant mounds on my face and neck. I never had many but it was like I always had one huge one somewhere.  My period was really light on it in for first couple years (as in pantyliner_ no tampon needed). Then it got a little heavier but it was never very heavy. I was moody on this pill a week before my period. I didn't have any really bad side effects. I went off it for OTC to clear up my acne (didn't work).,F,26,4  years,10/31/2006,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
