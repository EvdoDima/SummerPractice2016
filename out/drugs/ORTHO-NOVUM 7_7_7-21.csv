0, 4, Prevent Pregnancy_ Lighten Periods,Weight gain of about 5-10 pounds_ moodiness/crying for a couple months_ breast growth_ lower sex drive_ vaginal dryness,I don't totally mind the weight gain_ as I hadn't been exercising lately anyway_ and it wasn't a whole lot. I have not had cravings for fast food at all. For the first couple months_ I was pretty moody and easy to upset_ but I attribute that mostly to it being a tumultuous time in my life. Things have smoothed out recently_ and I feel great. My breasts are definitely bigger_ though I originally attributed that to weight gain. However_ I've begun working out again and the boobs have stayed_ so that's nice. I suppose my sex drive_ though low to start with_ is kind of lower_ and I have to use lubricant for comfort. However_ it's not a huge problem to me_ so all in all_ I'm a fan. I mean_ I've taken it every day and haven't gotten pregnant.,F,20,9  months 1X D,5/19/2016,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

3, 2, Contraceptive,I started taking ortho ovum 777 when I got  together with my fiance (4 years ago) when I was a junior in high school and started becoming sexually active.  I noticed weight gain slightly about 5 pounds but my diet hasn't changed and it seems the longer I take it the more I crave.  I crave pop and fast food_ greasy foods like a mad man.  I have gained probably 30 pounds in the past year because of it.  I stopped taking it a week ago and I have noticed that I sleep a lot better and do not have to constantly eat or want food.  I noticed that my sex drive wasn't great while I was on it.  I am 21 years old and so is my boyfriend so I feel that it is kind of important.  I need to get my birth control changed though ASAP.,I do not recommend.,F,21,4  years 1X D,2/18/2015,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

Also every time i start the dark orange section of the pill cycle i break out horribly. I just woke up with it the first morning after the first orange pill. I hadn't experienced acne like that since back in middle school. I also lack the motivation and confidence i had prior to this birth control pill. Before this contraceptive_ I was taking Loralyn 3mg birth control for 2yrs and it was AMAZING but then insurance stopped covering it (almost $90 a month..prob why it worked so well). I highly recommend that versus this drug.,,F,18,2  months1x day,4/7/2013Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

14, 1, PMS_ cramps and Migraines,Nausea_ weight gain_ SEVERE depression and anxiety_ rage_ extreme fatigue_ intense cravings for fast food_ uncontrollable sobbing,My doctor thought this pill might help with my severe cramps and menstrual migraines.  Within 2 days I was nauseous all the time but the worst part was that I am usually a positive_ social_ happy_ motivated and active person and I felt heavy and exhausted and I was so depressed that I started having suicidal thoughts and felt completely hopeless.  I gave it a few more days_ hoping my body would adjust_ and had to stop because I felt like I didn't want to live anymore and my outlook and perspective were purely pessimistic.  I was extremely anxious_ my heart was racing and I felt nervous and uncomfortable and didn't want to leave my house or talk to anyone.  Also I eat a micronutrient-dense diet_ always healthy_ don't eat grains and suddenly I had crazy obsessive cravings for McDonalds and Taco Bell_ neither of which I've visited in about a decade!

During that time_ on the third week of the pill (highest dose)_ I would feel an increase in anxiety_ extreme vaginal dryness and I got a pretty bad yeast infection.  This happened twice in a row.

18, 3, Regulation,In March 2012 I developed severe blood clots in my lungs.,I had experience extreme discomfort in my right buttocks area around the beginning of March to the point that I could not sit. I pushed it to the back of my mind like I do everything else and went on with my life. About two weeks after that the rain decreased but moved up the right side of my body. The pain got paralyzing. I could not laugh or take deep breathes. I felt a pain in my chest put also my back. I could move and stretch without any changes in pain. I went to the walk-in and they treated me for muscle-skeletal discomfort. that night the pain reached it's peak. I could not move so my friend dressed me and drove me upstate to the emergency room. 6 hours later they decide to test me for PE (pulmonary embolism) and I soon found out it was positive. I had 3 blood clots that traveled through my right lung_ through my heart_ and lodged in my right lung. one blood clot remained in my right lung. I was in the hospital for 10 days. I am now 4 months into my recovery and it has been such a struggle. Besides all this_ being on Ortho Novum 777 was great. my periods were amazing; very light and short. I knew exactly when I would get it right after a month of being on the pill. Even all my PMS symptoms were gone.

33, 4, birthcontrol,First few days I felt nauseous and bloated but went away within a week. It shortened my period to 3 days and is light as well. Increased my appetite so that would explain why I've gained a few pounds not much though.,Before I started taking birth control the first thing that worried me was increased acne and gaining weight. It actually helped my acne clear up but I still get a  pimple here and there. It did increase my appetite..instead of feeling hungry when I should_ I feel REALLY hungry and get cranky if I don't eat. I would say I gained maybe like 5lbs but that's also lack of eating healthy and not working out as much as I used to. so with a healthy diet and exercise-you should be good.

44, 5, birth control,none,Been on this pill since age 19; briefly switched to Loestrin for 8 months due to sudden irregular bleeding and diagnosed with a uterine fibroid. Had the fibroid removed_ then switched back to 7/7/7. What I like about this pill is how the different levels of hormones mimicks the body's natural fluctuation; hence very few side effects. Unlike the newer mono-phasic (single dose) pills which seems to produce negative side effects (I had no periods/irregular bleeding_ mood swings and hair loss w/ Loestrin) Every body is different; this pill works great for me. Regular and timely periods. Just be sure to take good quality pharmaceutical grade multivitamins while on any birth control pill. I've often read that pills reduce the body's absorption of certain nutrients. No issues with weight on this pill either. However on the Loestrin I dropped 10 pounds. I know many docs prescribe the lower dose mono-phasic pills to older women (35+); but I think i'll stick to this classic formula.,F,37,17  years 1X D,5/19/2010,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21

I have since changed my oral contraceptive medicine to Lybrel_ which is the first FDA approved_ 365 day hormonal birth control with NO placebos.  All of my unpleasant side effects have since disappeared_ I'm thrilled to feel like myself again.  While Lybrel is a little expensive_ it's worth it.,F,28,13  months,9/14/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
55, 2, Birth Control,Headaches and some shortness of breath.,"I took the pill throughout my 20's for birth control with no problems - when I went off of it to become pregnant I didn't ovulate and had to go on medication.  After my first child I didn't go back on it and ovulated fine and got pregnant after having my period for 2 months (nursed for a year therefore I didn't get pregnant that soon).  Just recently I went back on it for BC (believe it was the generic) and was getting bad headaches and some shortness of breath.  I talked to by OB-Gyn and went off it - I had ""break through"" bleeding (a period) a few days later.  I am now at the 31st day after that time_ still no period and not pregnant - not sure if this pill does something to mess me up.",F,34,10  years,8/8/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
56, 3, to prevent pregnancy,at first_ ortho novum 7-7-7 was working great for me. but then i ran out of pills_ and was refused more pills by family planning for a week. after i got back on them_ i've experienced heavy bloating and gas on almost a nightly basis_ i've gained 10 pounds_ and i'm more prone to sadness and depression.,,F,18,5  months,8/4/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
57, 5, to avoid unwanted critters,none really. probably some weight gain though hard to say cuz i do like the kibble,i am actually on the 777-28 but i guess they are about the same. have been on them for 20 years. i think it is a reliable product if taken as DIRECTED! I was thinking of a Mirena but after all the negative press i have read I think i will stay with what works for me. i recommend the 777-28's as long as you are willing to remember them everyday and are willing to give your body a month or so to adjust.,F,39,20  years,7/12/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
58, 3, Contraceptive_ PCOS,Nausea_ vomiting_ diarrhea. Worst during the first 1-3 months on this medication.,I've taken this stuff as birth control off and on for the last decade. Every time I go off it for whatever reason_ and start back on_ I spend the first 1-3 months feeling rather like I have stomach flu. It's AWFUL_ but it does go away over time.,F,24,10  years,6/28/2009Email,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
59, 4, Prevent pregnancy / ovarian cysts,When I was 14 my doctor found cysts on my ovaries and wanted to put me on BCC to get rid of them.  I was first put on Ortho Tri-cyclen and gained about 10 lbs._ so my doctor tried me on 7/7/7.  My pain from the cysts went away after 3 or 4 months. I have really regular light periods and hardly any cramps.  I have been dealing with depression and low libdo for as long as I can remember_ it may be related to this drug.  I've been on 7/7/7 for 14 years and I think next month I'm going to quit taking it to see if this goes away.,,F,27,14  years,5/11/2009,Ortho-novum 7/7/7-21
