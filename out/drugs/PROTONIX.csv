5, 1, Gastric ulcer,Nausea_ acid reflux_ bad stomach pain_ heartburn_ muscle and joint pain_ insomnia_ low back and leg pain.,In 2002_ I had an ulcer that hemorrhaged. I tested negative for H. pylori and the presumptive diagnosis was overuse of NSAIDs. I was put on 40 mg of Protonix twice a day to allow the ulcer to heal_ and got annual endoscopies. The Protonix dose was reduced to 40 mg/day and eventually the endoscopies discontinued after 14 years of only mild inflammation in my stomach. I decided to discontinue the Protonix because of the recent articles about increased risk of cancer_ osteoporosis_ and dementia. I have been B-12 deficient for years_ and have to give myself B-12 injections. My symptoms during the taper have been terrible and I'm only 7 weeks into it. I have read that it can take as long as 3 months before stomach acid levels calm down and the taper symptoms resolve. However_ DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG FOR YEARS. I've had GI docs tell me it is perfectly safe and that I would have to take it for the rest of my life. That is simply not true. Short term is another matter_ but it has not been approved by the FDA for long-term use. The package insert says 6-8 weeks.,F,68,14  years40 MG 1X D,4/29/2016,Protonix

18, 1, GERD,Head aches_ irregular heart beat_ lethargy_  chest discomfort_ frequent urination_shortness of breath_  constant fatigue_ acute depression_ anxiety and high blood pressure. My bp was 110/70 but shot up to 160/110 while on this poison! I never felt so depressed in my life-ever.  I felt like a depressed zombie with a bad heart and no energy!  This drug exemplifies why we need to  stop taking synthetic meds and explore natural remedies & life style changes when dealing with non-life threatening health issues.,I was so glad to find this website-what a relief. I almost went to ER like so many other patients on this website. Protonix can give you_ unfortunately_ so many terrible & life altering  side effects  in one convenient pill. I would rather suffer from GERD than live with the most horrific side effects from taking Protonix.  How in the h#@l did FDA approve this medicine?!! FDA has a long history of being in the pockets of giant pharmaceutical companies and this is a pretty good proof. If you research the track record of FDA_ you will think twice about taking most doctor prescribed meds.  Change in life style and natural remedies is the way I am going. Stay away from Protonix and don't let your doctor convince you. The chances are your doctor never took this medicine from hell. My life is back to normal after throwing away these poison pills. I am sure  Protonix  helps many who suffer but the horrific side effects suffered by many trusting & unsuspecting patients really should be of a major concern to the FDA ( wishful thinking).

19, 1, GERD,Diarrhea_ constipation_ gas and occasional nausea.,While I  have had a long history of intermittent diarrhea and constipation prior to taking Protonix; I never thought twice that this drug was exacerbating these symptoms. About a month prior to stopping Protonix_ I developed increased diarrhea and intense gas pains. I usually manage with a combination of OTC products as well as diet coke_ which relieves the gas. I decided to stop taking  Protonix as an experiment having heard recent stories related to long term use.  I have been off Protonix for over 3 weeks and have not had one episode  of diarrhea_ constipation or gas and feel significantly better.  I am managing the GERD with D-GL (deglycerized licorice).,F,62,10  years40mg 1X D,2/17/2016Email,Protonix

Had cramp in my legs. More intense headache. Stomach pain and burping a lot. I also felt anxious for a reason I could not explain. I was wondering what was happening to me. I thought I got a virus...My GP made me a blood test and everything was perfect.- the third week I had chest pain_ unberable anxiety and panic attack_ tetany_ a lot of gaz : I couldn't eat the third of my normal portion_ felt weaker and weaker_ diarrhea_ could not breathe normally_ tinglings in my hand and feet_ cramping in my hand. I went to A & E cause I though I was having a heart attack. They checked my heart and found I had arythmia but nothing dangerous according to them. They advice me to go to my GP and ask something to be treated for major anxiety. I went back home. -The next day_ I was trying to cross the street to go to my GP again and I felt inconscious in the midden of the street. Back to the hospital with an ambulance this time. Intense abdominal and chest pain. They checked my heart but it was ok however arrythmic. It seem I was dehydrated because of diarrhea and probably had a vasovagal syncope. As I had abdominal pain they made an ultrasound scan to chek my liver_ pancreas and gallblader but no sign of inflammation. My bloodpressure w,F,42,3  weeks20 mg 1X D,1/30/2016Email,Protonix
23, 2, reflux/GERD,extreme fatigue_ abdominal pain_ brain fogNOTE:  whenever you take PPIs take a full daily vitamin and maybe B complex because these meds block your absorption of these.,Was on omeprazole for 1.5 years and it was working ok until I started getting extreme abdominal pain.  Dr switched me to pantoprazole and the pain never really went away after 1 month.  Also had extreme fatigue and apathy.  Got a 20mg prescription and weened myself off by 1 week of 40mg/20mg every other day_ 1 week of 20 mg_ 1 week of 20mg every other day with Zantac_ then 1 week of Zantac. Stomach pain disappeared after a couple weeks being off these meds.,M,44,30  days40 1X D,1/27/2016Email,Protonix
24, 1, Difficulty swallowing/acid reflux,Extreme dry mouth_ daily diarrhea_ nausea_ shooting pain in head_ neck_ and by far the worst was severe sharp low abdominal pain.,Have been able to work very little in the last couple of months due to extreme low abdominal pain. 2 trips to ER_ gastroenterologist_ gynecologist_ back surgeon_ and general surgeon_ and none have been able to determine what has caused the severe abdominal pain. I believe that at least the largest cause is the pantoprazole. I have weaned myself off the pantoprazole and the pain seems a little better. I am still dealing with nausea pretty much all day and have horrible indigestion and gas that I didn't have before going on the med. I would recommend being very cautious about going on this medicine. I'm hoping I can get back to my old self soon. I have been unable to pay my bills and haven't felt up to doing anything. I just want my life back.,F,57,3  months40 MG 1X D,1/24/2016,Protonix

I thought this was a miracle drug! IT ISN'T! Such severe headaches (I get migraines)_ I have seriously felt like I've been hit in the head & it's going to explode from the pressure.

26, 5, stomach probs/duodenum inflamation,Hunger_  lump in upper back of throat_ sleepiness which may or may not be related to medication.,All of us are unique just as our body chemistry is unique within us. All of the horrible side effects I'm reading here I began experiencing within 1 dose of omeprazole_ another PPI_ along with a weird odor like a musty incense was stuck in my nostril. I couldn't sleep_ I had anxiety_ I was severely constipated for 3 days & I had severe muscle pain_ especially in my arms. At one point my chest got so heavy I thought I was having a heart attack. THAT WAS AFTER ONLY ONE DOSE of Omeprazole.   I just began Protonix 2 weeks ago_  but had previously taken it for 1 full year w/out complications. This time around I do have a slight lump in my throat_ which seems to be subsiding. Other than that_ I feel like I'm starving to death all the time. It's wonderful! I don't care if I gain 20 pounds. After being nauseous for so long 24 hours a day_ day in and day out_ with severe stomach pain every time I ate_ I love being able to actually eat a meal and not feel sick. The bottom line is_ if you have severe symptoms that can cause problems like bleeding ulcers or cancer from chronic inflammation and one PPI don't work for you_ you should try another.  Also_ if you notice severe onset of new or worsening symptoms_ it's more likely related to your newest medicine. As soon as I noticed the horrible symptoms after one dose of omeprazole  I stopped taking it immediately and my doctor prescribed the Protonix again.  Some of us have no choice but to take these medications. I have no stomach linin,F,49,1  years40 mg,1/7/2016Email,Protonix

I swear I thought I was going crazy_ I was not understanding why I'm feeling all of a sudden depressed and anxiety. I'm a very upbeat person that enjoys life and enjoys being a mother and a wife. This made me scared of life. My doc switched me to Nexium after telling her it was working for me. The Nexium was even worse. I will never take these medications again. I'm only 2 days off but I'm still feeling the side effects. I hope this goes away fast and I can get back to my normal self. I feel so bad for my family for going through this with me.

66, 1, Ulcer,SEVERE DIARRHEA!_ Mild anxiety_ & restless leg syndrome. The diarrhea is by far the worst & most debilitating!! Every single thing I eat goes right through me. I was prescribed Protonix 40 mg 1x daily in March for an ulcer. At first they thought it was a gallbladder issue & they did an EGD & found an ulcer. Weeks later I still had symptoms_ they upped my dosage to 2xs daily. I still had issues so hey removed my gallbladder and said to continue the Protonix.  Once my gallbladder was out I have had non-stop diarrhea. I can't even go grocery shopping or in public anywhere unless I KNOW that there's a bathroom_ where it is_ & don't need an employee to unlock it! And heaven forbid I'm in a traffic jam! And there's no way I can work like this! At one appointment they were talking about putting a pic line in_ (a portable IV that I can have at home)_ which they mentioned before but I didn't want to do. Instead they wrote me a prescription for Lomotil which stops diarrhea_ in my case slowed down some.  Yesterday they mentioned the pic line again since I'm getting dehydrated & losing nutrients_ at this point I don't care_ I just want to feel good again!! Im normally an active person.  Fed up_ I googled to see if Protonix can cause diarrhea & sure enough IT CAN! Possibly even C-Diff which I was tested for & luckily it was negative. Which getting the stool sample was disgisting!!! I work in OR so knowing what C-Diff is_ this possibility was ver,This should not be used except in dire situations.

69, 1, GERD,Severe Anxiety,I am not one to take medication but because of the amount of nausea I was having I decided to try this. I took one 20 MG pill before bed which was at 11. I had nightmares and woke up in the morning with severe anxiety. By noon the anxiety started to calm down but did not go away until around 5:00. I had taken this medication a few months prior for esophagitis. At that time I believed the anxiety was being caused by the stress of a newborn as well as being sick. I thought I was going crazy and doctors were quick to agree. They believed I had postpartum depression. As I gradually stopped taking the medication life got so much better. At the time I thought my diet changes were causing me to get back to myself. I had not realized that once I stopped the medication the symptoms had all stopped. This recent experience was a flashback to the worse experience in my life (and I have gone through cancer). I am not one to post comments but I want to warn those who are considering this medication. Anxiety is a real symptom caused by this medication.,F,27,1  days20 MG 1X D,4/14/2015,Protonix

Extremely dry mouth_ loose stools.,When first prescribed_I thought this stuff was amazing. My lifelong reflux issues had gotten to the point where I sometimes had trouble swallowing. Protonix helped so much and it was great to not have frequent heartburn and trouble swallowing. Then I developed a weird pain in my left knee_ I thought maybe I had pulled it at the gym_ but it kept getting worse. I am in decent shape for my age_ I work out regularly and ride my bike to work. Suddenly_ I could barely get down the stairs in the morning. I felt 50 years older. Some days_ I felt like I had been beaten with a bat. My whole body hurt. It was depressing and exhausting. At first it didn't occur to me that Protonix could be the cause. I asked my Dr. About side effects but she said the drug had none like this. Then I looked on the internet! I stopped taking it immediately and started to feel better almost immediately. Unfortunately_the reflux is back and worse than ever_ but it is the lesser of two evils.

Dr suspected I was suffering from malabsorption based on symptoms. I went off all medications in preparation for a stool study and once I stopped the Protonix_ things returned to normal. After a few days of heartburn I took Protonix for 2 days_ and the stomach issues came back.

165, 2, Acid Reflux/Gastritis,I thought this drug was great because it kept my acid reflux at bay and I didn't have to worry about it_ but now I just found out that I have several gastric polyps (30) and they most likely were caused by long term use of PPI's (proton pump inhibitors) like Protonix and Prilosec_ which I was on before the Protonix.  This is not good_ so now I had to get off (slowly) but I am having to deal with the heartburn/acid reflux every day again now. I am very mad that none of my doctors that knew I was on this stuff for years didn't even warm me that this could happen with long term use.  My advice is to stay off the stuff unless it's completely necessary_ then only take it for a while_ not several years.,I am trying all the natural stuff I can find_ (aloe vera_ apple cider vinegar_ baking soda_ etc.) but so far_ they don't work as well as the protonix did.,F,50, 40 mg 1X D,2/1/2012Email,Protonix

It was about 100 BPM vs normal at 56-60 BPM. This took a while to subside. I almost called an ambulance because this condition can be indicative of a blood stream drop in magnesium which can cause heart failure. Frequent urination and vivid dreams with shoulder pain persisted throughout the night.,If you take this medicine and start getting fast_ slow_ or irregular heart rate_ consider going to the emergency room if the symptoms do not stop in short order.

Several years ago_ I did quit taking it and had to eat tums like crazy but I quit taking it.  Yes AR was worse for a couple of days but I was determine.  I am 58 years old and will do what I can to quit taking this drug and with the guidance from the nutrationalist.   BTW-a small cup of Dairy Queen ice cream stopped AR in its tracks for me as well :)  but I do not eat it anymore with my new reducing plan.

I drink 8 oz of water every time before I eat. I have also elevated my bed_ eat 5 meals a day with smaller portion_ and stay away from food which causes acid reflux. But the major difference comes from drinking more water. After stopping taking Protonix_ my joint pain/muscle pain also went away.,M,57,11  years 1X D,11/18/2011Email,Protonix
172, 1, acid reflux,headaches_ nausea was terrible_ light headed_ very tired_ and my blood pressure dropped. (The b/p dropping was a plus_ but I don't like it sitting that low when I know it's not in my normal range.) I had orthostatic hypotension upon standing.,I would not suggest anyone taking this drug unless you have no other options.  I'd rather have the acid reflux and try to change my diet and deal.,F,41,3  days40 1X D,10/29/2011Email,Protonix
173, 4, Mild GERD and bleeding,Bloating cause by slower digestion (because lowered stomach acid)_ slight regurgitation cause by slower digestion_ softer stool.,This med is effective at reducing acid in the stomach.  But be aware that with lowered acid levels_ your digestion will be a lot slower which means bloating and some regurgitation after meals.  I started taking it after stomach pain and black stool.  I took it for almost 2 months but decided to make diet changes instead.  It turns out it was soda that's causing my stomach problems (I drink about 2 to 3 cans a day).  I stop drinking Coke and slowly go off Protonix in 1 month period and it works out fine for me.  Now there's no stomach pain.NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU GO OFF SLOWLY.  With the lowered stomach acid level for a whole month_ your body produce a large amount of chemical signals telling you stomach to produce acid.  If you go off it suddenly_ you will get extreme amount of acid in your stomach!  You need to introduce acid back into your stomach slowly so you body stop producing those chemical signals.What I did was 1 day Protonix_ next day take 2 150mg-Zantac; after a week of this_ I take 1 day Protonix_ then 2 days of 2 150mg-Zantac; another week_ I take just 2 Zantacs no Protonix_ then 1 Zantacs a day_ then I stopped completely.  Your schedule might vary; talk to your doctor.  On hindsight_ I should have done a lower dosage Protonix 20mg instead of Zantac since I have no side effects with it.  If stomach pain comes back then maybe is something else in your diet that needs to change (think about what ever that's unhealthy or listed as possible causes)_ but in the me,M,31,2  months40mg 1X D,10/14/2011Email,Protonix

175, 2, acid reflux,sinus pressure and headaches_ dizziness_ ringing in the ears_ stomach cramping_,I could initially tell a difference with reflux in taking protonix_ but started having headaches and pressure on left side and ringing in the ears_ which I presummed was due to sinus infection. Also had to really watch my diet and felt like acid reflux worsened over time. Stopped taking protonix because I really don't like taking any medications and did not feel like acid reflux was worse than the side effects. Having been on no other medications_ I know it was from protonix. Started taking magnesium supplement and all symptoms_ including acid reflux stopped. I would recommend researching how magnesium plays a role in bodily functions_ especially how it reduces acid in your stomach naturally. Now I only take a magnesium supplement and have complete relief.,F,34,2  months40 mg 1X D,9/30/2011,Protonix

When i started taking this i ha rdly had any reflux problem_ but after taking it continuously for  months my symptoms worsened. I experienced more side effects than its benefits. Now when i try to stop this medication i feel acid rebound_ and i am now stuck up with this.....feel like crying .....this has become a multi billion dollar industry and doctors and pharma companies are playing with the lives of the people...i..i earnestly plead everyone to start spreading worldwide awareness about the side effects of these  PPI's .....and we should try to stop this ever flourishing industry....i wish i had never consulted a gastroentrologist for such a minor problem.....,M,24,6  months40 mg 1X D,9/1/2011Email,Protonix

One night the pain was so severe went to ER (again) and this time they did a CT ""with"" contrast and low & behold a huge gallstone - immediate/emergency gallbladder removed and ER surgeon told my husband it was the worst one he'd ever seen (not largest but grossest). My recommendation if you're having GERD and it gets worse on protonix_ have your gallbladder checked and removed.

181, 2, Occasional Heartburn,I have been on every PPI and this is the best one. I have weened from 80 mg to 60 to 40 to 20_ soon I will go to 10. I eat a strict diet and take many enzymes and DGL with every meal. The belching and discomfort and burning (most likely gastritis_ caused by the PPIs as it started after I took the drugs) have 90 percent gone. I am dreaming for the first time in two years since I started this med.  Every time you go down in dosage you get rebound. 20 to 10 mg is essential as I tried cold turkey and after 4 days you are hurting badly. Let your gastrin levels slowly go back to normal. The funny thing is_ I only had heartburn in the first place because I would eat pizza late at night after singing in bars and such with cigarette smoke_ around alcohol_ etc. On top of a horrible diet I was asking for it. The doctors who prescribe this sure do get their bonus_ but I wonder if it's worth the price of their souls haha. Most of us don't even need this_ we just need a wake up call. If we stopped e,I gave it a two only because it stopped the reflux. This is NOT A CURE. It makes you completely dependent. Cyclical profit needs cyclical demand_ and cyclical demand in the pharmaceutical world means cyclical sickness. What major cures have their been since Polio? There is too much money in sickness.

If not taken - miserable.Note: endocrinologist told me calcium citrate would get to my blood_ bones better than Tums (calcium carbonate) which needs acid in stomach (this was true for me - my low blood calcium from parathyroid surgery was better with citrate) Also_ if you ever get your gastrin hormone level checked_ it will be high while on a proton pump inhibitor as there is a feedback loop where your body raises gastrin hormone to turn on your stomach acid pumps.  I was told incorrectly I had a gastrinoma (inoperable tumour) as my gastrin  level was high - wrong - she consulted with gi who said it was nothing_ just the ppi - all ok now.

188, 1, Acid Reflux,burning mouth_ burning tongue_ burning gums_ swollen gums and lips_ bleeding gums_ dry mouth,This mediciation worked great on my acid reflux_ which was keeping me awake at night and very painful.  However_ after about a month I started noticing the burning and swelling oral symptoms listed above.  They continued to worsen_ and my mouth would be so dry that despite waking up 2 or 3 times a night to take a drink of water_ in the morning my mouth would be dried out and my gums would be bleeding_ with my lips stuck to my gums and teeth with dried blood.  I had no problems whatsoever with my gums or mouth or teeth before.  The burning mouth was constant_ making it painful and difficult to drink anything other than water_ and I was only able to tolerate the mildest foods_ like mashed potatoes and oatmeal.  I literally had to take ibuprofen or tylenol to be able to eat any food with any taste or salt or heat at all. Suspecting the protonix_ as it was the only new medicine I was taking_ I weaned off it and the symptoms began to subside right away.  Now a month later I am still experiencing a slight burning in the mouth and lips and a slight swelling in the gums but it is almost all gone.  It's a shame because it did a fabulous job with the acid reflux_ but the side effects were worse than the acid.,F,47,3  months40 MG 1X D,2/15/2011Email,Protonix

The side effects did not happen immediately so I did not realize it was a stomach drug causing the issues.  By the end_ I felt like I had one foot in the grave_ and thought I was seriously dying.   My physician missed that it was sides effect from the drug_ as he had been treating me for other_ earlier symptoms - minor by comparison.   It took about 48 hours off the drug and I started feeling better although I had a bad headache for a couple days.

My endoscopy showed no problem with my stomach but had infectin in my estro..._ and hiatal hernia. I had an endoscopy 7 years ago and had no hiatal hernia at that time. Don't know if hiatal hernia is caused by the drug.  The first 9 years_ I took the durg only when I had heart burn that I could not tolerate. But the heart burn got worse last year. I would like to limit it to 1x40MG daily now. Will talk to Dr. next month when I see her.

I tried prescription Nexium_ Prevacid_ Aciphex_ also the OTC brands as well and none of them ever worked like Protonix does. The OTC brands made my throat burn.

Ended up at the urgent care clinic cause I woke up with my throat closing and tongue swollen with sores and a rash.  The doctor said it was the protonix and not to take it any longer. Did help my reflux but I am allergic to it.,F,53,30  days30mg 1X D,5/12/2010,Protonix

226, 2, Gastric bleeding ulcers,Didn't realize that most symptoms were the side effects of the protonix.  Wow.  Migraines_ Fibromyalgia pain symptoms_ restless leg sensations_ joint pain_ blood pressure issues.  THe protonix blocks all absorption of many VItAL vitamins that our body NEEDS which is where most symptoms stem from.  You can't take oral supplements because they will not be absorbed through the stomach due to the protonix so you either need sublingual or through injection.,It did help the ulcers heal_ but the side effects completely outweigh the benefits.,F,33,9  months40mg 2X D,4/2/2010,Protonix
227, 5, Acid reflux,None really,I take this med off and on. When my reflux really acts up and not getting relief from OTC's (Pepcid Complete)I take this for a few months about every 2 - 3 years. I also have a Hiatial Hernia and I think it just gets inflamed. A few month on this med helps it heal I think. I also sleep better. This really works for me but for those who would like to try this option be careful coming off this drug. You need to wean yourself off or you can get a rebound effect.,M,55,2  months40 MG 1X D,3/16/2010,Protonix

229, 5, Eosinophilic Esophagitis,Massive leg cramps & possible sciatica,I started taking this medicine about 2 years ago for Eosinophilic Esophagitis. I was having choking spells and nighttime acid reflux. I was on this medicine for a year and felt fine. I switched at my doctors request to Prilosec OTC because with my insurance plan it would be free. It also worked great w/o any side effects.  Recently_ I received several samples of Protonix from a drug rep friend. I took the first yesterday and woke up today with the worst aching leg feeling_ feels like I ran 10 miles.  We'll see how I feel tomorrow.,M,38,1  years40 1X D,3/4/2010Email,Protonix
230, 2, Schatzki Ring,Dizziness,Took medication after endoscopic dilation of a Schatzki ring.This medication made me so dizzy I could not stand without holding on to something.  It was the only medication I was taking and the dizziness decreased once I stopped_ taking a full two weeks for the dizziness to go away.  I work in construction and felt further use would be a safety hazard.,M,50,1  months40 mg 1X D,2/27/2010EmailHistory,Protonix
231, 3, acid reflux,diarrhea,The only PPI I have had success with so far is Aciphex.  Protonix_ like Prevacid etc - gives me diarrhea.  My insurance will not cover the Aciphex_ so I'm trying Protonix now.  If I only take one_ it does not help.  They added Pepcid_  so together my acid reflux is OK_  but I have to take Immodium daily to battle the side effect.  I'm not sure that's a good thing.,F,43,45  days40mg 1X D,2/20/2010,Protonix

236, 1, Yes,Extreme tireness_ right arm & shoulder hurting,Doctor started me on Protonix for pain between my shoulder blades(mid back) called it acid stomach. I was not experiencing heart burn only pain in my mid back. I stopped taking Protonix 4 days ago. I am not certain my pain was from my stomach. Curious to know if anyone else had these symptoms,F,59,90  days,11/23/2009,Protonix
237, 5, Acid Reflux,Insomnia_ dizziness_ anxiety and headaches for the first few weeks.,I had been prescribed 80 mg/day for a month for acid reflux. It helped but the side effects were troublesome_ especially in the beginning. Fortunately they do improve after a few weeks. I now take it for a week or so at a time as needed during flare-ups. I had no problems tapering off it as far as rebound acidity which can happen. Although thousands of people take PPIs on a daily basis I strongly believe that these drugs should not be taken for more than a month at a time. My doctor agrees with me.,F,37,30  days,11/16/2009,Protonix

240, 5, Acid Reflux,None,Love this medication.  It totally takes away my acid reflux.  The only down side is that if I miss a day the reflux comes right back until I start taking the protonix again.,F,41,3  years,10/22/2009,Protonix
241, 4, Gastritis/Non-Ulcer Dyspepsia,I took Aciphex last time I had this problem and after a few weeks started feeling some scary side effects like shortness of breath and dizziness.  I was scared to try another PPI but the pain had gotten really bad and I had lost weight.  I went ahead and tried protonix and it's been wonderful!!  I am on my 6th week.  Haven't had any side effects at all.  My stomach is pretty much back to normal_ but will finish the full 8 week course.  I guess it is true not all PPI are made equal so don't be afraid to try different ones until you find the one that works.,,F,36,6  weeks,10/19/2009,Protonix

244, 3, Hiatal hernia acid reflux,I will say that this medicine stops all my acid BUT if you take it for a few months and then stop you may get worse heartburn then even when you started taking it. I weaned myself from the whole pill to half to half of half and I am afraid I will have to go back on it. I am sticking it out but am in pain.. Been off it for 2 weeks and am in cronic pain with hot buring in my chest and worse heartburn then ever. I wish I would have just took tums. I cant understand why it says it heals you and then you can go off it because I am not healed at all I am worse.,I also think this drug was giving me severe head aches that felt like they were in my throat going into my head.,F,35,2  months,8/22/2009Email,Protonix

Looked at pinched nerve in the neck_ allergic reaction to food_ among other things. Lost all side effects 2 weeks after stopping the medication.

248, 1, Gerd,I had all the Adverse Effects listed. Anxiety_ weakness_ tingling in arms and legs_shortness of breath. Developed a UTI and my gums began to bleed.(Less than 1% experience this)Severe abdominal pain and severe esophageal spasm)Three trips to the ER and tons of bloodwork they couldn't help me. Had a 12 hour anxiety attack where I couldn't come down. ER gave me Ativan. Finally slept. Loss of appetite.,I was on 40mg for 14 days and 80mg for 3 days. During that time I didn't associate the sharp abdominal pains(trip to ER got Percaset)with the meds. Finally saw my GI doctor and he told me to double the dosage 40mg twice a day because I wasn't getting relief. Insomnia was incredible. I didn't sleep for a good 8 days. The last 3 days I took it at the double dose which required another ER trip for Esophageal spasm and intense anxiety and insomnia. I have been off the drug for 4 days. Had a massive anxiety attack after being off of it for 2 days. (Hospital trip got Ativan) Have heartburn which I will tolerate for now. Still experiencing tingling in arms and legs and strange surges of light headedness and dopiness.(Feel kind of high)My ears crackle and pop alot too especially in response to high pitches. From the reviews I have read my symptoms were pretty severe. I am hoping that all these strange effects will diminish. Poison control keeps telling me the drug is out of my system. I can see from the other reviews that it could be up to 2 weeks till most of the effects are gone. I'm scared these side effects won't go away. Obviously will never take again.,F,40,17  days,8/4/2009Email,Protonix
249, 1, Acid reflux,Horrible muscle aches and weakness after the fifth day - so bad that I could barely walk and could not use my hands to carry anything.  No pain relievers worked.  Upset stomach as well.  I used the generic Pantoprazole instead of Protonix.  Don't know if that made a difference_ but I would much rather live with acid reflux than try either again.  This was extremely painful.  I have been off the medicine for two days and pain is better but not gone.,,F,63,7  days,8/3/2009,Protonix
250, 4, hiatal hernia,I do not experience any side effects.,After being on Protonix for 6 months_my doctor recommended I start taking it every other day.  The pain resumed_ so he put me back on it once every day.  He renewed RX for another two months.  Seems better_ but still get infrequent attacks which are debilitating and scary.  I am scared of possible long term side effects from this drug.,F,52,6  months,7/28/2009Email,Protonix

256, 5, GERD and Crohn's Disease,None,I had GERD and tried everything...prevacid_ prilosec_ nexium_ zantac_ etc.  None of them did anything for me.  My doctor finally switched me to Protonix...I LOVE IT! I have been on it probably 8 years now and have no plans to stop.  I do have to limit my diet (no coffee_ citrus_ spicy_ alcohol_ etc) and if I miss a day or two of this medicine_ I definitly start with the reflux symptoms again. But_ when I take it regularly and eat smart_ I have no problems. I know everyone can experience different side effects_ but I never noticed a single one.,F,33,8  years,7/8/2009,Protonix
257, 1, GERD,Severe Constant Daily Migrane Headaches_ Dizzyness,About 3 days after starting on Protonix I began getting what I thought were severe sinus headaches.  The pain was over my left eye and behind it.  At times the pain was so unbareable I didn't know what to do.  It didn't matter what pain medicine I took_ Tylenol_ Excedrin Migrane_ Sinus Headace Medication_ the pain would not go away.  I went to my GP twice for the headaches_ the first time he said it was a sinus infection_ even though I had none of the symptoms.  When I went back after a full 20 days of antibiotics_ he said it must be alergys_ once again_ even though I had no symptoms.  Then out of the blue I thought maybe it was the Protonix_ and I found this website.  It took 2 full weeks for my headaches to go away after I quit taking my medication_ and I was only on it for a month. I wanted to write this detailed discription of the types of headaches I had since headache is a side effect of Protonix_ but no one ever described the type and length of the headaches.  Honestly I thought I must have a Brain Tumor for it to hurt this bad!,M,33,1  months,7/6/2009Email,Protonix
258, 2, Diffuse Esophageal spasm & reflux,stomach cramps_ diarrhea_ gas_ burping_ nausea,I stayed on this drug for one week.  I tried to be positive and not imagine things. Barium swallow diagnosed diffuse esophageal spasms and small hiatal hernia. I have constant burbling_ and pain in my throat. Had upper endoscopy which showed mild stomach focal inflamation. Dr. said motility study is an awful test and didn't want to put me thru it if drugs would help. Drugs haven't worked so far. Diet changes help but not totally. I feel worse with Protonix than without. After 1 week I stopped using Protonix as the stomach aches & nausea was too much on top of the throat pain. Swallowing problems continue and I'm very discouraged and losing weight which is ok for now.,F,65,7  days,6/15/2009Email,Protonix

260, 4, GERD and hiatal hernia,Bloating and cramping,Have been taking for about 3 weeks_ and has helped tremendously.  I no longer have to take daily doses of antacids.  The drug does seem to cause me to feel bloated with some cramping (especially in the mornings) but I will try to ride it out as it has otherwise helped with my GERD symptoms.  I have been advised to stay on the prescription for 3 months.,M,46,3  weeks,6/6/2009,Protonix
261, 2, GERD,Hot feeling_ jaw pain on one side_ small bladder,Didn't seem to help any more than Prilosec OTC.  Will continue to take it to see if it starts helping more unless jaw pain gets any worse,M,35,10  days,6/2/2009,Protonix

I  lost 60 pounds due to severe epigastric pain. Tried all kinds of medications but had no luck.  Suffered for 2 years and my doctor was about to send me to Mayo Clinic when he  finally tried me on protonix.  It took 3 weeks to kick in but I finally  became pain free.

269, 2, reflux_ choking feeling,dizziness; diarrhea; twitching (face and arms and legs to a lesser degree); esophageal spasm (different from tight feeling in throat before meds); increased anxiety; irritability; gas_ bloating and increased belching; tingly face and eyes,This is my second day off the drug_ which I recently associated with my side effects.  I reckon that a lot them (side effects) may be due to the drug having unsettled my magnesium (and possibly potassium and calcium) levels; this mineral (magnesium) regulates nerve function.  There have been a few recent studies linking PPI's to hypomagnesemia (an electrolyte disturbance in which there is an abnormally low level of magnesium in the blood).  The PPI's may have exacerbated a pre-existing problem in my case.  Not much change yet (went to the ER last night because of the esophageal spasms_ in fact). The spasms are worse after chewing or talking_ and are causing major anxiety.,F,28,37  days,3/15/2009,Protonix
270, 1, Stomach pain,Took protonix for several months and stomach pain got worse. ( severe pain upper and lower stomach and feeling extremly tired.) Then noticed that after I took the pill in the morning stomach pain followed. Quit taking Protonix and stomach pain has stopped and has not returned.,If you are taking protonix and still have stomach pain try stopping for a few days and see if symptoms get better.

Stopped taking it after only 2 days - the flu-like symptoms took another good week to get over.   Will look into natural remedies and diet makeup - no more PPI's for me.,It seems some can tolerate this_ but I sure can't.  My advise is tomonitor it for side effects very carefully.,M,49,2  days,3/5/2009,Protonix
272, 5, GERD,Bad headache when I first started but after day 3-4 it's gone and has not come back. Lack of appetite in the beginning_ slightly nauseas but honestly I welcomed that because I need to lose 20 lbs. But that feeling is also gone. I feel fine! It works.,I tried prilosex OTC and it did nothing. I went off the protonix because one doctor didn't want me to take it for more than 2 months. In 2 days symptoms were back. I teach and the GERD was giving me chronic laryngitis and sore throats. A new gastro dx. put me back on it. After 2 days that sandy throat feeling was GONE. I felt like I had a new throat.

I have never had a flare up while taking it.  A couple times I have gone on vacation and forgotten my prescription at home.

I know it worked for the reflux.  I Started it last night and today I have been very sore in the back_ chest_ neck_ jaw_ shoulder_ etc.  Have not been able to do much today due to the pain that I think is caused by this drug.

281, 4, Chronic Heartburn,Occipital Neuritus (24/7 head pain in the back of head),"I was on Protonix for 6-1/2 years.  It was life changing when it came to heartburn. I went from being up 3-4 nights a week with extreme heartburn_ to sleeping throughout the entire night every night. BUT_ after being on it for 5-1/2 years_ I started getting a burning/throbbing sensation in the back of my head. Then it started to become painful to touch my scalp. Kept asking doctor and neurologist if the Protonix could be causing it. Every doctor said ""NO WAY!""  So_ continued on Protonix and tried every pain killer around_ tried meditation_ yoga_ hot/cold compresses....nothing worked.  Finally went off Protonix and switched to Nexium.  After 3 weeks_ I woke up without a headache or pain.  Withink 3 months_ ALL symptoms went away. I have a few different side effects with Nexium_ but the occipital neuritis is GONE.  I know that the Protonix caused it.  My doctor now agrees with me.",F,39, ,11/25/2008Email,Protonix

Headache_ fatigue/no energy_ vitamin/mineral deficiency_ occassional stomach burning/bubbling (did not completely stop acid)_ lightheadedness_ sleepiness_ chest pain_ shortness of breath_ face/jaw pain_ nausea_ weight loss_ loss of appetite_ eye twitching.,I had bad acid bubbling and severe cramping in the upper stomach. Protonix took about 3 days to take affect. Most of the stomach pain/cramping/bubbling stopped and was able to sleep throughout the whole night. But then I felt nauseous and had no appetite. I lost 10 lbs in less than 2 weeks. I have really bad headaches constantly now. From the lack of eating and not being able to absorb certain vitamins I feel I am deficient. I am extremely weak and tired. My anxiety has gone up which makes things worse. Some foods cause me to cramp. I have not been eating adequately. I am having an endoscopy in a week to check for ulcers or any other problems. I tested negative twice for H. Pylori. My mom passed away from stomach cancer in January so I am hoping my test is negative. Overall_ Protonix does stop acids 85% of the time for me but the side effects are getting bad and would like to stop soon. I am scared I will have bad side effects from stopping or withdrawls. I hope I can find another solu,F,25,9  days,10/31/2008,Protonix
285, 5, acid reflux / irritable stomach,NONE _ I THOUGHT_ TILL I READ THIS REVIEW,Loved it from day 1_ prescribed to me by a physicians assistant_ I was so amazed that it worked_ I went back to his office and told him that it was first time since I was in the 10th grade that I didn't suffer.  I had went to many doctors and no one ever helped me till this.  After 7 years_ I realize from reading these ratings that maybe the Protonix is causing blisters under my top lip which I get every few weeks and have been getting them for approx 5 years.  Going to dr tomorrow and will have him check this out.,F,57,7  years,10/19/2008Email,Protonix
286, 1, bloating,Severe acid reflux when discontinuing protonix.,I really was not having any noticable reflux when this med was prescribed_ only bloating which my internal medicince Dr. said it could be related to reflux. Protonix did help the bloating so I continued it until I was told that continued use could be bad for calcium absorption and since I am menopausal and need my calcium I decided to quit the Protonix. My reflux is so bad_ burning_ unable to sleep.  I am really concerned that this might cause erosion.  I will see a Dr. next week for this.  I have made all the dietary changes and still feel terrible.  I really think this is all from taking the Protonix.,F,57,2  years,10/4/2008,Protonix

Stomach pain_ feel hungry most of the time_ even after just eating.,I do not know if my side effects are caused by this drug_ but I think they may be. I was first given Nexium (Purple Pill) samples. It did not help much. My doctor gave me 15-days of Protonix samples. They do not feel like they work any better than the Nexium. The abdominal pain got a little worse than it was on Nexium. The Protonix samples ran out 5 days ago. I started getting the burning feeling in my leg yesterday and its gotten worse today. Along with the burning in my leg my lower back has hurt more than normal. I've read that long term Protonix use may make it difficult for your body to absorb vitamin B. Vitamin B helps with the nervous system and that my be my back and leg issues. I'm due to see my doctor within the next couple days.,M,28,15  days,8/27/2008Email,Protonix

The reflux at night was helped somewhat but the side effects continue. I plan to discontinue this medication as the side effects are to disabeling for me to tollerate!

316, 1, Gastritis_ Nonulcer Dyspepsia,Drug effectively eliminated my nonulcer dyspepsia after a few days. But_ at day 12 I noticed strange cramps & spasms in my legs_ mostly in the right thigh. Then I started getting a mix of sharp / dull pains in my left rib cage (I thought it was my spleen)_ over my heart_ left arm_ and all over my back and shoulders.  My hands and fingers were tingling. The pains would come and go_ constantly moving around_ lasting 10 mintues to hours at a time. I almost went to the ER several times due to chest pains over my heart_ but I thought it was just anxiety.  But the pains would hit me even when I felt relaxed. I couldn't sleep.  At day 18_ the lymph node under the left side of my neck started swelling_ and my chin tingled_ scared me to death.  It went away after a few hours_ but the swelling came back stronger the next day_ and only then did I suspect Protonix!  I immediately stopped (on day 20) and I felt much better after a few days (see my comments:).,Six days after stopping protonix_ my gastritis came right back (but the bad side effects of Protonix were not completely gone).  On day 26 I started on Pepcid AC 20mg twice daily.  It worked well.  However_ at day 30_ the chest pain_ sharp rib-cage pain_ back pain_ and lymph node swelling came RIGHT back_ stronger than ever!  Perhaps any strong acid reducer would have caused the side effects?  Two days after stopping the Pepcid AC_ the pains went away again.  I'm writing this on day 35 and the side effects are 99% gone.  Overall_ the side effects were FAR worse than my gastritis.  Maybe I developed a nutrient deficiency?  I've read that calcium deficiency can cause many of these odd symptoms_ and calcium requires stomach acid for absorption_ but who knows. I get plenty of dietary calcium. Maybe calcium citrate supplements (absorbed without acid?) can help.

When older started eating earlier_ taking 4 Tums Ultra and eating a bowl of vanilla ice cream every night to kill the acid before going to bed. Didn't always work. Iwent to my doctor (after getting medical coverage through my job) and was prescribed 40mg Protonix.  Slept through the night for the first time in YEARS! Have had no problems.

I called the distributor for my pharmacy and asked them to make the 20 mg. readily available to my pharmacy.

They took me off it for 2 months and recently put me back on it and the cramps are back again_ along with a whole bunch of new side effects.

352, 2, GERD,The first two days_ some abdominal pain and headache.  Days 2_ 3 and 4 I experienced a strong flushing reaction - I felt like I was being heated up from the inside of my chest outward_ about 1.5 hours after taking the pill.  The feeling lasted about 3 hours and was scary and uncomfortable.  I really disliked the flushing_ so I discontinued taking the drug.,It did help my chest pain from GERD within two days.  I wish I could have stayed on it.,F,36,4  days,12/15/2005,Protonix

355, 5, GERD,None at all.,I experienced relief the very first day.  It was amazing to sleep through the night after years of waking up with acid reflux.  I did build an immunity to it after a few years and switched to Aciphex which has also given me marvelous results.  I have tried going without either of these and after 3 days_ GERD hits me again.  So I'll just go on pleasurably sleeping while switching back and forth between Protonix and Aciphex.,M,41,5  years,8/20/2005,Protonix
