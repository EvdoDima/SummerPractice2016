0, 2, Hypertension,I took half of a 10 MG tablet every morning along with the Atenolol I am already on. I had to stop taking the medication after just 13 days due to a severe dry cough that developed_ accompanied by dizziness_ drowsiness_ and headache. I was very disappointed_ as the medication kept my blood pressure well controlled.,,F,49,13  days5 MG 1X D,2/25/2016Email,Prinzide

2, 3, hypertension,My blood pressure went down in about three weeks_ but I began to cough after about a week and eventually coughed so much and so hard my ribs were sore.  I've stopped taking it.,I have read in some sources that a cough in these circumstances is often accompanied by other problems that are not so obvious.  I'm no expert_ but it's worth asking your doctor about if you have a cough from this medication and s/he recommends you continue it anyway.,F,65,3  months,12/17/2007,Prinzide
