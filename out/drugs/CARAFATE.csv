0, 1, Ulcer,Severe mouthwatering_ mild nausea_ stomach upset_ intestinal cramping_ diareah,Tried for 2 days but by day 2 the mouthwatering/ nausea lasted all day then the cramps and diareah began.

10, 5, C Diff caused gastritis_ IBD,Dizziness_ dry mouth,I have severe gastritis and inflammation through out my small and large intestines. With in the first week it calmed down a lot. I am on other medications so I always check interactions and side effects. This drug does cause a lot of interactions with other meds so be careful how and when you take it. I only take on an empty stomach and go exactly by directions for time between medicines. Since I am on blood pressure medicine its very important it doesn't interfere with that. Right now after so much pain and being so ill I went through with C Diff this is my only option to hopefully I will get back to normal again. So I am making sure to follow everything to the letter. Or I could progress to ulcers and surgery. So that makes me so glad to have this and take it.,F,57,90  days1 GM 3X D,12/20/2015Email,Carafate

24, 1, I have two very large peptic ulcer,I was prescribed carafate 6 weeks after the ulcers were found by an EDG.  I was not getting any relief taking 40 mg of protonix twice a day.  Because of the flavor I gag so bad I throw up right after taking it_ so it has done nothing for me... My symptoms seem to be getting worse_ not better although I have completely changed my diet.  I do not smoke_ rarely drink alcohol and tested negative for the h paloyri_ I have in the past taken NSAIDs quite regularly_ but have not touched them in almost two months_ yet I have had no relief.,,F,38,10  days10ml,6/21/2014Email,Carafate
25, 4, botched endoscopy,It WILL block other meds you take_ which really sucks (take other meds well before this_ and work out schedule for drugs you're supposed to EAT FOOD with). It leaves thick layer of chalk feeling in throat but really helps with ulcer pain.,"I'm only on day 3 of a 14-day course of Carafate (but I think I'm only going to do 7 days_ long enough for the Protonix to start working well). The ER gave it to me after they found their surgeon had dug a little too deep for a biopsy during an endoscopy. In other words_ I have a sudden ulcer now that I didn't have before the endoscopy_ and the pain from that was truly indescribable (maybe because it was so sudden?). The on-call surgeon sent me to the ER about 36 hrs after the endoscopy; the ER dripped Dilaudid for pain after my heart checked out okay_ even when I said Vicodin hadn't touched the pain. Sure enough_ Dilaudid did nothing for the pain_ either (though ice packs helped a lot). They put me through a bunch of tests and scans_ FINALLY gave me a ""GI Cocktail""_ and that worked like magic! But GI Cocktails wear off_ don't really heal anything_ and that's why they gave me 14 days of Carafate Â— until the new Protonix script (and double Ranitidine dosage) could kick in. The first dose or two doesn't seem to help at all_ but by the third dose_ and sticking with just the low yield BRAT diet (banana_ rice_ applesauce_ toast)_ the incredible pain was essentially gone. YAY! But WARNING: I can't get my other meds (thyroid_ propanolol for heart rate_ even melatonin for sleep) to work! It turns out you have to be REALLY CAREFUL scheduling meds around this stuff_ because Carafate WILL BLOCK ABSORPTION of meds. I get up super early to take Protonix.",F,36,7  days1 gram 4X D,5/6/2014Email,Carafate
26, 5, Gastritis,Had a terrible case of gastritis. Had gastroparesis (paralyzed stomach) along with the gastritis.  Gastritis pain unbearable.

37, 4, Duodenal & Stomach Ulcer,Diminished mental capacity and memory.,"This medication works well and allows the ulcer to heal.  BUT I just found out that it contains a HIGH CONCENTRATION OF ALUMINUM!  The only reason I started researching into this medication was because after taking this medication for 1 1/2 months_ 4 times a day_ my dad is now complaining of a diminished capacity in brain function and memory.  He's saying that he's becoming more ""slow"" and he's becoming more ""forgetful"".  If anyone else is considering taking this drug_ please take that into consideration...the link between aluminum and alzheimer. But_ in terms of the effectiveness of the medicine itself_ it works really well!  It does what it's supposed to do.  But it's probably not a good idea to take this long term.  Definitely consult with your doctor regarding the potential side effects.",F,64,1  months10 ml 4X D,9/3/2011,Carafate

50, 5, Reflux at night,No side effects at all.,I experienced nighttime reflux for many months. I almost choked to death several times. I was so afraid of it that I would only sleep sitting up in a chair. You can imagine what that was like along with work and caring for my child. My husband tried sleeping sitting up in the living room with me for support_ but why ruin his life and career too.The GI that I was seeing tried everything and I followed every tip and guideline out there. Endoscopy showed nothing. The GI finally precribed Carafate.IT WORKED IMMEDIATELY!!! I take a two teaspoonful dose (that's all!) prior to going to bed and I sleep with a fifteen degree wedge pillow and have not experienced a single episode since. It is truly a wonder drug.

I currently take three to four tablets a day depending on what's needed.
