1, 5, Constipation,No side effects.,I take Miralax for constipation that is a side-effect of another medication. I take Miralax maybe three times a month. It works very well and produces a bowel movement either the same day or the next morning if I take it at night. It doesn't cause me any cramping and produces what seems just like a normal bm. I don't think I could take this for colonoscopy prep because of dehydration issues_ as I have a medical condition that makes dehydration very dangerous for me_ but for occasional use in low doses_ it works great.,F,26,1  days1 cap full,7/25/2016,Miralax

3, 1, colonoscopy prep,I had the preparation before and had similar results.  The last time_ I mixed it with powdered yellow Gatorade.  I sipped it (without a straw- no one mentioned this) and vomited after before finishing one 8 oz glass.  This time I just mixed with water b/c someone recommended that it doesn't taste that bad.  Taste was OK and drank small sips with a straw.  Same result_ after first 8 oz I vomited.  It was around 6pm and I was not able to eat anything else that day without vomiting.,"I asked my Dr. for an alternate prep_ but his answer was for me to get the ""constipation prep""  This was the same prep with an additional 10 oz dosage of Magnesium Citrate.  There were no instructions for mag citrate_ so I called the Dr office and she said to just take it. When? how much?  UGH!  Then she argued with me about Gatorade - like that made me vomit the first time. My beef is that my Dr. blew off my concerns about this prep and ignored my request for the Mag Citrate prep that I had with my first colonoscopy.  I am allergic_ or have a severe reaction to something in this_ and while this is probably rare_ I am probably not alone.",F,59,1  days230 grams 2X H,6/27/2016Email,Miralax

Day after colonoscopy am passing brown mucus and twice didn't make into the bathroom in time and soiled myself.,"Thought I was choosing an easier prep_ since I had no problem drinking this down in 8 oz gatorade over a 2 hour period.

I didn't start to have problems until after midnight with nausea_ dry heaves_ numbness and tingling in my hands_ dizziness and weakness. Called the on-call doctor twice_ first time he told me to try to ""stick it out"" and the second time he told me to go to the ER to be evaluated. ER staff said they weren't surprised and that they've seen this before.

I occasionally have to bump the dose up but not often.  I am truly amazed at some of the negative comments here.  Of course Miralax is going to cause some gas!  It's also going to cause diarrhea if you take a large dose i.e. prep for a colonoscopy--that's kind of the idea.   Miralax did not cause your sore throat_ your runny nose_  your itchy dry skin or foot pain.   It takes several days to work if you start with a small dose.

24, 3, Colonoscopy Prep,MiraLAX was mixed with 64 oz. of Gatorade2_ total 4 Ducolax pills for colon prep. I drank 8 oz. every half hour from 5pm - 8pm. After first two 8 oz._ I started feeling dizziness and abdominal pain. After the next two 8 oz._ I experienced very severe abdominal pain that radiated to lower back pain; all on right side. My first thought was that it had exacerbated sciatica nerve pain I had a few years ago. After completing the solution_ I was in acute_ excruciating abdominal and back pain -- worse than child labor pain. It was constant pain whereas I could not stand up straight. I couldn't lay down on either side without excruciating pain. I sat up in a chair to try to sleep; and I was up literally all night. My colon procedure was next day @ 2pm. The pain never subsided_ and I informed nurse and doctor of the pain; but seemed to be of little concern. Three days later I'm still experiencing pain in my mid stomach area and lower back. I've taken a couple of pain meds_ to no avail. Thankfully_ I never vomited_ but any standing or lying position this pain is severe. I may have to go to ER.I was not in any pain before starting the prep_ so I have concluded that this pain is caused by either or both the Ducolax pills and the MiraLAX. After reading about MiraLAX_ it is conceivable to think this severe pain is from the MiraLAX. In addition_ the pain worsen when I breathe (so it is constant)_ and when I cough_ yawn or sneeze. It has been torture and pure misery the last 5 days.,The MiraLAX worked for its intended purpose in cleansing my colon for the colonoscopy; however_ its side affects are terrible and seemingly long-lasting. I will never take MiraLAX again_ and I pray it has not caused irreparable damage to my stomach and other organs. The pain is contained to my right side only tthus far_ but seems to radiate across my lower back area. MiraLAX may work well for most_ but I will never forget this painful experience.,F,59,1  days8.3,11/15/2015,Miralax

37, 3, chronic constipation,My Dr. told me to take Miralax every day for the rest of my life. A few months after I started taking it_ I was really sick and diagnosed with staph infection in both kidneys.  The regular physicians gave me medicine after medicine and couldn't get rid of my staph infections.  They even sent me to specialists and it came to a point that people thought I was making up my illness.  I lost my job of 11 years because of this medicine.  I also fainted for the first time_ because it caused me to get dehydrated.  I went to the E.R. twice from fainting a total of 4 times. The doctors just couldn't figure out what was wrong.  I brought up the Miralax_ but they didn't think it was a problem and I would quit taking it for a few days_ but it never helped and I needed it for my constipation.  I finally decided 3 years of being sick_ was too much.  I decided to quit.  I was tired of not going outside in the summers because of the heat and I would get sick every day from dehydration (I had to keep Gatorade stocked up).  Please just be careful with this drug.  It works well for constipation_ but some side effects that stink. Including the constant bloating.By the way_ if you're new to taking Miralax_ you may need to take 2-4 caps per day (per my Dr)....it worked to get me going and then I cut back to 1 cap per day.

When I was 25 my colon basically shut down_ causing constipation so severe that it caused agonizing pain_ extreme toxicity_ chronic fatigue_ food insensitivities_ and insomnia_ forcing me to quit my graduate studies and move back home so my parents could care for me. I took every test imaginable_ but the doctors could find no visible cause for the constipation_ leaving it up to ""colonic inertia."" No medicine (herbal_ over the counter_ prescription)_ lifestyle_ or dietary change offered any relief. I was drinking miserable pre-surgery bowel cleansers like GoLytely like water. In desperation I finally went to the Mayo Clinic and they prescribed Miralax. It instantly relieved my constipation_ making my bowels soft and easily expellable. What a glorious feeling to be cleaned out! It is tasteless and gentle on my body_ and I have gradually overcome my other health problems as toxicity is no longer an issue. There has been no side effects after 2-3 doses a day for 3 years. My colon still doesn't function on its own_ but because of Miralax I have gotten my life back. It is MARVELOUS!",F,30,3  years 2X D,3/5/2011Email,Miralax

135, 2, Crohn's constipation,sore/dry throat_ headache_ fatigue_ bloating_ dry eyes_ hot flashes,It has helped me go to the bathroom more regularly_ but I feel like I've been getting sicker in other ways the longer I've been on it.  I've been trying to drink more water to avoid the side effects_ since they seem related to dehydration_ and that helps a little but I can't seem to drink enough to completely resolve the problems.  I've taken it for 7 weeks twice/day.  Xrays showed I was still constipated so my dr recommended doing 3 nightly enemas_ then taking 4 Dulcolax & a 235 g bottle of Miralax with Gatorade (like a colonoscopy prep).  My symptoms got much worse after the prep/cleanse.  I am supposed to continue taking it twice/day then do the prep/cleanse again in 2 weeks but I am concerned because of the side effects.  My dr recommended taking it once/day after I'm done with all the cleanses indefinitely to prevent constipation in the future. I do not think my body is reacting well to this medicine and would like to try something more natural.,F,29,7  weeks 2X D,2/24/2011Email,Miralax

141, 5, Painful Hemmroids,No side effects Yay!!!,I have delt with severe constipation and painful hemmroids for a year now.  Nothing_ I mean NOTHING worked.  I increased my fiber and water - all of that and nothing helped. My hemmroids were internal and so painful that I would almost need to pull over on the side of the road while en route to work.  It hurt to sit or stand or lay.  I was in so much pain.  The quality of my life was greatly affected.  Thank goodness I had a supportive boyfriend who would just sit with me while I would have these episodes of pain.  I was literally taking 16 200 gram ibuprofen pills a day (4 every dose) just to take the edge off.  After I couldn't take it anymore_ I went to visit a colon/rectal care doctor who scheduled me for laser surger but put me on prescription strength Miralax in the meantime.  Miralax is hands down THE BEST thing that has ever happened to me.  I take one capful at night and by the next morning I have a soft_ easy_ full bowl movement.  Within a week my pain was gone and I no longer had the bloating due to unmovable waste. I am so happy to be off of the Ibuprofen that I was popping like tic-tacs. It's oderless_ tasteless and does the trick.  I am actually considering not havin the laser surgery.  I'm going to ask my doctor if I can do the once daily dose indefinitely and hope he says yes.  I have at least one bm a day (usually two) but my stomach has flattend out and did I mention my pain is gone????

My bloating has gotten better (since I've been able to release the stool) and my stomach has been less upset while experiencing a lot less discomfort. I have been diagnosed with IBS (which I do believe I have some form of it) but also had a terrible case of gastritis (waaay to much build up of acid in my stomach). I think most of my bloating and pain came from that. I would recommend Miralax to anyway--I'm just afraid I may become dependent on it.,F,20,1.5  years1 capful 1X D,12/27/2010,Miralax

I've been told by doctors & pharmacists ""there's no problem with a permanent daily dose"".  Others say ""drink more water and eat fiber"".  That hasn't worked for me_ but adds  confusion.  I've stopped Miralax from times-to-time in fear of becoming dependent;  then resume it after a few days.  This on and off routine is two yeas old.

My mom would give me Fleet enemas or big spoonfuls of Mineral Oil when it would get really bad. As an adult_ I would notice the occasional bit of blood after passing a stool. ""Just anal fissures"" I thought_ because my poops could be pretty hard at times and I figured they were tearing something on their way out.Then a few months ago I got my first external hemorrhoid. I'm sure I'd had internal ones for years_ and all the straining (even though I squat on the toilet) and whatnot finally gave me varicose veins in my anus. Awesome! I'd been using docusate sodium for a few days_ but was worried about dependency. If I missed a dose_ I wouldn't poop. I dreaded going to the bathroom because my roids would hurt. My friend's b/f (med student) highly recommended MiraLax_ because it's a safe (osmotic) laxative and non-habit forming. I've been taking it for 5 days at night and have been consistently doing soft well-formed stools every morning.I eat lots of natural fiber such as broccoli_ carrots_ root vegetables & nuts_ but they still didn't help the dry stools I'd been having. I also drink a lot of water every day_ and am well-hydrated (as evidenced by how often I have to pee). I also stay away from diuretics such as coffee_ tea_ soda & alcohol.I would like to gradually decrease my intake to where I don't need it any longer_ but if that means I get constipated again_ I'd rather take MiraLax for",F,28,5  days17mg 1X D,11/26/2010,Miralax

If I'm home_ a warm bath after voiding really helps. But I am not home today and am in severe pain.,"Probably lessened the bowel movement pain_ but afterward the stinging pain grew steadily. I want to believe the ""miracle_"" so I'll give it a couple more days_ as I have run out of remedies.

I had previously been taking Miralax upon awakening; but have now switched to taking my daily dose in the evening.  This product causes temporary diarrhea and bloating_ relieved by administration of a dilute Fleet enema.  It also causes increased urination_ which became a challenge when driving to work.  My daily weekday regimen (with the full knowledge of my family physician and gastroenterologist) now usually consists of 1-2 glasses of  warm water and a dilute Fleet or 1500 mL enema - followed by 20 or more minutes of exercising to cover a minimum of 2 miles - each morning.    On Saturday and/or Sunday_ I start the morning with a dose of Miralax (after first drinking a bottle of Magnesium Citrate every other or third  weekend); followed 1 to 2 hours later by a series of enemas_ and lastly my exercise routine.   Exercising has been found to increase the peristalsis_ making the laxatives and enemas more effective; besides exerting a positive impact on the cardiovascular system (blood pressure_ etc).  The regimen_ though time-consuming and not common for distance runners (who often seem to have just the opposite concerns when they compete)_ enabled me to complete (in under 2 1/2 hours) my first half marathon in May 2010.

I read about Miralax online (Heathers IBS website)and decided what the heck. Not to overstate the issue-but this has dramatically improved my life. As I noted it's a little hard to regulate yoruself on this. You need to find ""your"" dosage and it can take a month or so to do that. Now I take 1 capful each morning in my coffee-it is undetectable in any way. Sometimes I cut down to every other day_ sometimes I take it twice a day_ depending on how I'm ""going."" I usually go every day-sometimes several times a day. This is unheard of in my life! It is always easy to pass. I have not had IBS-like cramping pain for at least a year_ which used to put me to bed for days at a time it was so bad. The GI says there is no harm in taking this daily forever. It is not a drug-it just pulls water into your intestines. My granddaughter's pediatrican also recommended it for her and she is only 3. It's very safe.

185, 5, Constipation due to medication,Occasional gas. Stool too soft at times (switch to half a dose).,I take this daily for constipation due to another medication and it works great. It is safe for long term use if it is not your diet that is causing you to be constipated. If you aren't on any medications that make you constipated change your diet first and check with a doctor if you feel you need to use this long term.  Also_ if my stools are getting too soft I switch to half a dose. Be wary of the generics. Kroger Miralax was not as effective for me and tastes awful. It also doesn't dissolve very well. Dulcolax Balance (same compound) works extremely well and almost has less taste than the Miralax. I am assuming this is due to small differences in the manufacturing process. So for decreasing solubility and tastelessness Dulcolax Balance > Miralax > Generics. I have only noticed a difference in effectiveness between generics vs. brand but no difference between Dulcolax Balance and Miralax.,F,20,5  months9-17 g 1X D,5/13/2010,Miralax

Miralax was used to clean out my colon prior to my surgery. after further research I started using this daily. since then I have not needed to use any other medications_ enemas etc. Miralax is a miracle medicine for me anyway. I mix it in my coffee every morning and by the next day 15 minutes after I get up I have a bowel movement and then maybe one or two more during the late morning with full control.

228, 5, severe constipation,none besides difficulty figuring out how much i need to stay regular,its amazing. i was miserable. my entire life since a baby i have had constipation problems_ apparently my intestines are too long for my body. i have been put on absolutely everything_ changed my entire diet numerous times and nothing ever helped. i have stayed home plenty of days from constipation pains_ lost sleep and actually gained 8 pounds because i constantly had that much stool in me ! (gross i know) but i have been on miralax and i now go to the bathroom 2 times a day with 1 and 1/2 cap full in water every morning_ its great ! honestly changed my life.,F,18,4  months,1/2/2010,Miralax
229, 4, Anal fissure,None,I've had painful and bloody bowel movements for the past few months_ and it finally ocurred to me that this started at the same time I started taking Effexor for depression. My doctor suggested Miralax_ and so far it has provided some relief. No complaints.,M,28,2  days,12/30/2009,Miralax
230, 3, Post-Colon resection/Diverticulitis,Ever since less than  week after taking Miralax I developed very painful spasms in my neck and shoulders. I was unable to stop taking it because it's the only thing that makes me able to have a BM. I have had diverticulitis_ part of my colon removed_ and still unable to function. I stopped taking Miralax two weeks ago and switched to Lactulose - pain in neck_ etc_ decreased dramatically but didn't fully resolve. I returned to Miralax three days ago out of total desperation and muscle spasms have never been worse. Pain dramatically increased an hour or two after taking it. I am now nearly paralyzed with severe pain in neck_ upper back_ tendons. I've read that certain drugs can trigger an autoimmune disease that causes tendonitis and never goes away. I'm starting to wonder if Miralax can cause the same problem.,Otherwise.....I thought Miralax was the best laxative I've ever used. It's amazing stuff_ if you don't have sensitivity issues with it. Had I found Miralax before I had part of my colon removed_ I probably never would have done it.,M,51,6  months,12/15/2009,Miralax
231, 5, Preschooler holding her poop,Excellent.  Has done wonders for my daughter,My daughter has been on Miralax since her 3rd b-day.  She had been holding her poop and only going every 4th or 5th day.  She would then only go in the middle of the night_ when I'm assuming her muscles were more relaxed. (She was potty trained_ but used a pull up at night)  The doc put her on miralax.  It worked wonders. The only tricky thing is finding the perfect dose.  Too much and she gets stomach aches and poop that is like pudding.  Too little and it gets hard and she reverts to holding it.,F,3,1  years,12/10/2009,Miralax
232, 5, sever constipation with back ache,none,MIRALAX is a lifesaver.  It really has changed my life.  Before I spent so much time in the bathroom trying to go and now I am in and out.

I now have a flat stomach and my clothes fit.,F,44,2  months,12/6/2009Email,Miralax

234, 5, Chronic Colonic Pseudo Obstruction,Bloating and increased urination,I have been taking Miralax (single dose on a daily basis) since 2003.  I take it upon awakening and then follow up with an  enema (usually a dilute Fleet enema during the week_ and a larger enema on weekends or before travelling)_ since my GI doctor diagnosed my condition as caused by slow colon motility (due in part to life-saving abdominal surgery -treatment of volvulus which resulted in temporary colostomy - performed in 1981).  When first prescribed by my GI Specialist_ I found Miralax to be a good laxative; but noted that it also caused extensive and uncomfortable bloating.  My GI Specialist suggested that those side effects might be offset by an enema.  As I write this in November 2009 (after a visit to my GI Specialist in Sept 2009) - Miralax (along with 2-3 additional glasses of water)_ followed up with an enema_ than by 20-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise (which increases peristalsis) has dramatically improved my quality of life.  The above comments have been shared with doctors_ nurses_ paramedics_ PA's and other medical professionals; who all concur with my strict daily regimen.   This regimen (according to my GI Specialist) has prevented the need for decompression or to remove my colon.,M,55,6  years,11/22/2009,Miralax

239, 5, constipation,none,I am a normal weight_ otherwise healthy woman.  I went to see my doctor for constipation issues. I was having severe back problems for 6 months.  The back pain was the worst when I tried to sleep.  I had a feeling it was related to my constipation issues which I have suffered with for years. The doctor insisted I have a colonoscopy first which came back normal.  The GI doctor told me that miralax is a safe laxative- not addictive.  one of the nurses told me she had been on it for years and it made all the difference.  I ate raisen bran for a year_ drank prune juice for a year_ ate prunes for a year. You tend to get sick and tired of always worrying about what you can eat that may make you go.  The back problems were the last straw.  So far Miralax works for me.  I go every day and have had zero side effects.  I am actually eating normal for the first time ever.,F,44,7  days,11/3/2009,Miralax

At first_ this worked well_ then after about 10 days_ I found that the medication was doing nothing but bloat my abdomen and cause me to frequently urinate.My gastroenterologist then suggested that I increase the dosage to a full dosage as he felt I was not evacuating enough.  He also added that increasing the dosage would ease the frequest urinating urges.  He was wrong.  I took the full dosage for 3 days and I had to stop.  I was so bloated and distorted in my abdomen that it hurt to even breathe.  The frequent urination continued so much that I was up all hours of the night to use the bathroom.  I still have the issues where I do not evacuate enough.  All my tests including the colonoscopy were normal.  I have had a prostate biopsy which was also normal.

I'm currently having some muscular/neurological problems (muscle twitching and weakness in neck). Does anyone think this might be related to Miralax?,I've struggled with constipation since I was a child. It got worse in my thirties and caused sever hemorrhoids. Doctors kept telling me to ingest more fiber_ avoid red meat_ drink more water - all of which I was already doing. (I even became a vegan.) After a miserable hemorrhoidectomy_ I continued to have problems (fissure). I found a new doctor who knew about chronic (genetic) constipation and Miralax_ thank goodness.

She was taking lac to lose at the time. So then early March 2009 She went in again  for stomach bloating_ vomiting_ diarrhea_ stomach pain and they put her Glyco 3350 NF Miralax so she was on it every night well 2 weeks later she had the symptom again but ever worst. So i had a feeling it was the Miralax they said no it cant be that well after 6 days in the hospital her stomach went down_ no more vomiting no more discomfort except for the tube in her nose and the IV_ the tube was used to clean out her stomach for 6 days she on that. So she was back to eating regular foods finally after that and sent home_ But this is the clincher 1 hour before sending her home they gave her Miralax and now her stomach is bloating again.

I am terrified to take laxatives because of the dependency the body can get. Fiber_ prunes_ etc does NOT work on me. Well_ for fear that more was going on_ I saw the DR. He said that 99% of the time it's a motility problem. He said to clean out (drinking Citrate Magnesium...under $2 a bottle at the pharmacy)and start that night on Miralax. He said start for 5 days on one dose_ if that didn't work_ start 2 doses for another 5 days_ and so on until I find what works...but no more than 3 doses a day. He said if THAT didn't work_ call him back...it took almost 2 weeks for Miralax to work...I was almost doubtful because of all the great instant results people had.

When I had these attacks_ I would try all kinds of fiber supplements to move matter through my system. Each had side effects - UNTIL_ prior to surgery_ the surgeon recommended Miralax_ along with eliminating all seeds & nuts from my diet. She said that Miralax is gentle & has no side effects_ which has proven absolutely true for me.

309, 4, IBS-C (narrowing tubes),Worked right away..same day I took it. No noticable side-effects. The one thing I notice is if I double the dose...take it twice a day_ it causes bloating/mild gas and I won't use the bathroom til the next morning. But I take it once a day (I only took it twice a day just twice). I take the whole capful and I go at least 7 times a day. Maybe more. Sometimes a lot comes out_ sometimes one little drop comes out_ which fustrates me because I know there's more. I think I have to cut the dosage in half though because I'm going too frequent and I got a rash from it (from going too much) and my sphinters hurt a lot. I think if I cut the dosage in half I'll go normally. I'm looking to go 3 times a day honestly. Maybe 4. But although it helped me a lot with my constipation which I suffered with for 2 and a half yrs and excessive gas which I don't have anymore_ I still don't like the fact I got a rash_ it's painful and sometimes I don't go all at once.

She gets 2 teaspoons every other day in juice or milk_ she is now 18 months old.  If she is not on it_ she is really constipated - she likes to hold it in.

After years and years of chronic constipation_ Miralax has been a huge relief. It isn't a laxative in the sense that it makes you have to go_ it simply makes 'going' a whole lot less painful_ as it only softens stool.

Anyone out there had the Nissen fundoplication procedure done where they have to wrap your stomach around your esophagus just to tighten it enough so your food won't come up in your throat?  well_ after that surgery you cannot burp anymore_ therefore it has to come out somewhere.  I also have SOD (sphincter of oddi dysfunction) and if I get really constipated_ I have terrible_ terribe spasms like labor contractions.  Constipation is one of the worst things anyone can have to constantly deal with and it also does LOTS of other things to our bodies with the toxins that build up.  The smell that everyone is talking about with the poo that is coming out_ well_ imagine what must be stuck up in there!  I drink this at night with a glass of Nestle's Quick before bedtime.

In a two week period_ I had only two BMs which was normal for me.  He was shocked.  He told me to get Miralax right away and take it every single day and he would guarantee it to help.  I was on the Atkins Diet at the same time_ which has very little fiber_ so I wasn't expecting good results.  I now have a BM at least 4 out of 7 days with no side effects.  I have never gone to the bathroom this much and it feels awesome.  Since the large bottle is almost $20.00_ I will be asking my doctor for a prescription for the generic.  I can't say enough about Miralax.  It has been a Godsend to me.,F,60, ,3/15/2008,Miralax
333, 3, Constipation due to PPI use,"The taste was horrific_ my gas smelled like someone had died inside my colon and was slowly being excreted in a vaporous form_ and it caused me to feel like I had to go poop even when I didn't.  My crap was also watery and came out in a skinny_ straw-like form that broke apart every 1 inch because it was so soft.  I must say though_ that the taste in and of itself was almost prohibitive to me taking it.  Everyone says that it is ""tasteless"" but I can always taste it unless I put it in strong coffee.  It has almost a ""stale"" or ""bitter"" taste and aroma; it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new plastic toy.  Yuck!",Maybe I didn't need a laxative after all.  After I started taking PPI drugs_ my poop was less consistent (I only went like once a week)_ but the consistency was never a problem.  I would often poop large amounts at once of normal-consistency poop.  Now_ however_ I'm pooping like 3 or 4 times a week_ but it is watery_ smelly_ and disgusting.  My anus actually got dry and started to bleed from all of the excessive wiping.All in all_ it is probably good for people who are actually constipated -- as in_ have hard poops -- but for those of us who are just not pooping often enough_ I'd suggest something else.,F,18,3  weeks,3/12/2008,Miralax

As with all malabsorbtion problems one wonders if something digested could be ""blocking"" the vitamins from being taken up by the body ????????",Miralax has completely changed my life. I have had chronic constipation since birth and I had been using rectally inserted bisacodyl for over 20 years in order to even get a bowel movement. All the fiber and pshyllum husk in the world just was not enough to make my bowels function. I was developing very severe rectal problems with all the bisacodyl. My doctor suggested Miralax and I take half a dose once a day together with a cup of dissolved pshyllum husk. I can now have regular movement without bisacodyl for the first time in 20 years! If I go to much I skip a day of the Miralax and if I have trouble going I up the dose a little so I kind of play it by ear. I had totally given up hope of ever being able to quit the bisacodyl but I am finally free of it! I am ofcourse concerned about taking Miralax on a perpetual basis but my doctor says it is safe.

After many years of chronic constipation which had become worse_ a colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis of the colon. Adding extra fiber to my diet did not help; it only created gas. My doctor prescribed polyetheylene glycol (the generic form of Miralax) and it saved me. I take 1 tablespoon in a glass of orange juice every evening_ and have normal BM's every morning.  No more constipation.  It does not give me diarrhea or gas.  I take no fiber supplements_ and keep the fiber foods moderated_ because fiber gives me gas.  I also take simethicone regularly_ to keep that under control.  This stuff is truly a godsend for me_ and my doctor says I can take it forever. I believe this will keep me from ever having serious colon problems like diverticulitis.  I have the pockets in my colon_ but I believe they are healing.  This just might have saved my life.

I had my first gentle bowel movement only three days after the first dose (capful). Here is something you may not know - Eating is the trigger for Miralax to really work.  Put it in your morning orange juice_ eat something and then wait - it won't be long before you go.Now if that Glycolax didn't cause so much bloating_ it really would be a miracle.

Nor did conventional stool softeners with docuate sodium (which also contains some version of e-glycol). I take a half a cap of Miralax in the evening and my system just runs more smoothy.

I hope someone out there can tell me to keep up with it that it will get better_ because right now_ although my intestines are emptying_ I just can't figure out when.  There is no cramping_ it is just now.  I hope that it will regulate sooner than later.,F,36,3  days,5/24/2007,Miralax
381, 5, chronic constipation,no side effects,I wrote below that it didn't work for me after 5 days and I was so disappointed. Well_ I stuck with it and used a babylax each day to have a bm. After 3 weeks_ I no longer need the babylax or any other laxative. I take the 17 grams in the morning and I have 2-3 small bm's per day now. They are very soft and ribbony_ and I may try the citrucel as recommended below. For now_ I am just amazed and glad I didn't stop trying. After 25 years of laxatives_ I am quite amazed at this success. I am still concerned that one day it will no longer work for me_ but time will tell.,F,47,3  weeks,5/19/2007,Miralax

Still had chronic constipation with pain and bleeding hemmorhoids. Have had problems since I was a baby.  Now my medication for high cholesterol aggravates the problem. The gastroenterologist prescribed Miralax_ she said there are no side effects and it was safe for long term usage.  It has helped me tremendously.

A week after we took gluten out of our daughter's diet_ her ""functional"" (i.e._ supposedly no anatomical and/or physiological reason for it) constipation cleared up (we had already taken milk out of her diet_ which many people who don't fully digest gluten in this way also have the same problem with).

386, 4, Colectomy- removal of 24 inches,Because of the sigmoid colectomy two years ago I am unable to have a bm without stimulant. I used sennacot s for two years which is not good to do. I now take two to three doses a day of Miralax prescribed by my gastro along with two doses of citracel and a very high fibor diet of at least 30 grams. I drink lots of fluids. I may go twelve times a day_ but at least I do not have the bag and I can live with this. If I had used Miralax years before my surgery_ I probably never would have developed diverticulitis.  I also have a very slow digestive system and my colon never was able to do its job.  Using Miralax for only five days is not enough time and probably the person that wrote about that should up the dose to two and then to three times a day until they have a bm.  Also_ add the citracel and start counting your fiber.  Fiber One will give you 13 grams and their bars another 9 grams.  You have to drink lots and lots of water.  It took 4 days for my first bm and that was on a very hig,Miralax really is a wonderful stimulant and will work. Anyone trying Miralax for the first time must be patient and if by the third or fourth day there is no bm take two doses a day and then maybe three.  Cut back after your bm to a dose that will work.  The initial dosing may have to be high.  Take the citracel liquid or caps twice a day and DRINK LOTS OF WATER. It will work and can be a lifetime treatment.,F,59,1  days,5/5/2007,Miralax

I've had constipation issues my whole life_ and found out at age 17 that it was due to Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Miralax can produce soft stools_ but you must drink plenty of fluids and have a healthy diet. I take about 10grams/day with coffee (a natural laxative) and a bottle of water for success. The drug helps_ but if you overeat or eat IBS trigger foods (high fat_ etc)_ your system can get backed up regardless of the drug's presence. Although Miralax is gentler than OTC stool softeners_ it is not perfect and I worry about long-term use. These are serious chemicals_ and I can't find any long-term studies on it.

435, 4, withholding/constipation,"No real side effects.  Our only complaint is that it is very difficult to find the ""magical"" dose.  If we give too much it is impossible for him to control bowels.  If we give too little he can't go.  We need to play with the dose everyday.",Our son started on Miralax 2 1/2 years ago (he started at age 1).  At that time he was having a very difficult time going to the bathroon.  When he was able to go it was dry and he would tear his rectum. We went to two different GI specialist.  One at Hasbro Childrens Hospital and one at Boston Childrens Hospital.  They both assured us that it was a safe drug for children and for long term use.  They suggested that we keep him on it until he is potty-trained.  So far so good.  He is well on his way there!!!!,M,3,2  years,9/30/2005Email,Miralax

437, 5, life-long constipation,some bloating_ but still far more desirable than the side effects of chronic constipation.  i recently injured my tailbone due to the constant straining resulting from constipation.,i eat a high fiber diet and drink lots of water but have always had chronic constipation.  miralax has been very reliable and effective since I got the dosage just right. the tailbone injury has now had a chance to heal.  my gi doc advised me that I can take this forever without any long term effects_ dependency or tolerance issues.  far safer than most otc alternatives and I find it far more effective than anything else I've ever tried.  this is how it was explained to me: the drug does not enter the blood stream and is not absorbed from the intestinal tract. it stays within the gut and pulls water into the intestine thereby increasing the volume and frequency of bowel movements. it is also FDA approved.,F,35,2  months,4/19/2005,Miralax
438, 5, Constipation,Not at all_ it is great medication_ I am taking it for the past 3 years,Without taking Miralax_ I used to have a very hard time and even bleeding. Bleeding stopped magically after Dr. T in Stanford suggested I take 2 X 17g per day. I am afraid for long term effect_ but it is better than bleeding and staying in the washroom 2 hours!,M,37,3  years,4/3/2005Email,Miralax

443, 1, Irritable Bowel Syndrome,I got a horrible inflamation of the stomach. It looked like I had gained about 70 pounds. I also had bad flatuence very frequently. I had awful muscle pain in my stomach_ but not a stomach ache or gas pain_ muscle pain.,It did help the constipation immensly. The side effects were dehibiltating though.
