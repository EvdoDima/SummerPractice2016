0, 5, insomina,Most effective medication for sleep. Taken properly with a glass of water and lying in bed you will sleep in 15 min.  Shame for people who used responsibly that so many others abused it. I worked rotating shifts 8/4  4/12 or 12/8.  when I needed sleep fast and for less than 8 hours this was very effective_,,M,55,2  years750 1X D,9/30/2015Email,Placidyl
1, 4, Recreational,Though used to treat insomnia etc. I managed to have the opposite effect. Everyone around me would be wiped out and I was climbing the walls_ready to go out and have fun.,"A very good drug if used properly. If used to catch a ""buzz""_ rated by me as one of the best drugs ever.",M,50,2  years500-750mg 2X D,7/31/2015,Placidyl

3, 5, recreation,Took them in my early 20's in the 80's and remember just a wave of calming feeling coming over me and we always add alcohol with it stuporous_ blacking out_slurred speech- When a bunch of us took it we just stumbled around and laughed and fell asleep.between 1975 And 1985 I went to some parties and saw substances used to excess in ways that I've never seen since and never will again the experiences in that time of my life between 16 and 25 were some of the most intense memories that Im ever going to have bought a 70 Plymouth Roadrunner with the big block and a pistol grip 4 speed for $650 - the girls were gorgeous the cars were fast the drugs were everywhere and we did it all -  I'm not going to lie and tell you that I hate all those times I loved every minute of it but I could never go back to it but what a hell of a time to remember for those of you that came later I can't put into words it's one of those things where if you have to ask I can't explain you had to have been there and in a way I'm glad I was - may the 70's live on - 0 and oh yeah - Mopars forever!!!,,M,50,5  years750  mg,9/15/2013Email,Placidyl

5, 5, Insomnia,Some gait disturbances if did not retire immediately.,Very smooth drug. Unable to get in US now.,M,41,21  days,5/14/2009,Placidyl
6, 5, Insomnia,one incident of sleepwalking,This is not a sneaky pill.  Placidyl makes your brain spin_ and your head hangs forward as your neck muscles get weak.  Your extremities feel half paralyzed.  Your speech slurs.  It is not a euphoric effect_ but you KNOW your're going to sleep.  No worries about no effect.  I like this kind of emphatic medication; slow-acting and subtle sleep aids help me not at all.,M,63,2  years,8/23/2007,Placidyl
7, 3, Migraine headaches,Slurred speech_ loss of muscle coordination_ strange dreams_ blackouts_ bad aftertaste,This drug got rid of my headaches_ but had some very weird and dangerous physical side effects for me. I was not cautioned to take it ONLY before going to bed_ or in a situation where I could immediately lie down somewhere. I took the drug when I got a migraine at work once_ and experienced side effects that made me look like I was drunk! I had to be driven home_ and nearly got fired. I had to get a doctor's permission to return to work_ was ordered to take a drug test_ and had to get all kinds of documentation from my physician stating why I was taking Placidyl. Plus_ there were rumors that I was an alcoholic or a drug addict! It was horrible.,F,40,6  months,12/4/2006,Placidyl
