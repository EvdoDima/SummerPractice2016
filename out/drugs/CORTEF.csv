0, 1, Adrenal insufficiency,Rapid weight gain -- 30 pounds in less than a year. I continually asked my doctor why I was gaining weight and never got a straight_ direct answer.,I was not aware until I attempted to wean off that I may NEVER be able to get off this drug.  I should have been told this prior to starting; if I had known_ I never would have taken it.New doctor said my lab tests did not justify my taking this!  And now I am stuck.,F,61,15  months15 1X D,8/14/2016Email,Cortef
1, 4, Addison Disease,Headache 30 mins after taking meds also light choking little nausea and anxiety.Had these side effects 2 or 3 times daily. Ate more gain a few pounds. ,My energy during the day was so much better. Sleeping all night was wonderful. I could not take the side effects.,F,69,1  months30mg,5/7/2016,Cortef
2, 4, Addison's Disease,I gained 30 lbs and at times i can become irritable......not very often.,I started lowering my dose from 30 mg per day to eventually 20 mg per day.  This is suppose to help with my weight and live a longer life.,F,72,3  years10 3X D,2/19/2016Email,Cortef
3, 5, Adrenal Insufficiency,Update as of Feb/2016. Still taking the same dose and feel remarkably better. This winter I managed (so far) to catch a cold only once_ compared to fourteen times last winter! I still workout regularly_ and overall have more energy. No more awful PMS. The only side effect: Despite working out/eating well_ I have GAINED weight_ about 10 lbs. Not too happy with this_ but I suppose I'd rather be a little squishy than sick and tired.,,F,38,5  months1.25 - 2.5 1X D,2/3/2016EmailHistory,Cortef
4, 4, Addison's disease,When I was first put on this_ I was put on 100mg a day because there was no endo at the hospital and the doctors had no idea how much I was supposed to take. I gained weight like crazy -- starving all the time_ gained almost 70lbs. When I was finally able to get into an endo after 4 months (we don't have many in our town_ so they're overbooked)_ he tapered my dose down to 20 mg a day_ divided into 2 doses. I've stopped gaining weight but can't seem to lose even a pound even though it's been over 2 years. This is very distressing to me. I do like feeling good and not like the walking dead_ but I hate the way I look.,,F,20,2  years20mg 1X D,11/8/2015,Cortef
5, 5, ,Only from Maltodextrine - sugar substitute in it. I am allergic to all sugars. No side effects when took with ginger.,I was taking it according to my Saliva test (4 times a day test) It showed that my cortisol is low in the morning and barely normal during the day. I was not able to tolerate other supplements that usually help with adrenal fatigue due to allergy. So I took 10 mg in the morning_ 7_5 for lunch_ 5 for dinner and 2_5 before bedtime to support blood sugar. My blood sugar drop at night and my adrenals depleted as a result. Initially mercury fillings_ synthetic hormones and following Candida infection_ damaged them. Now I feel much better and can work with help of other supplements whole day. Never take such strong drugs without saliva test.,F,57,6  months25 mg 1X D,4/25/2015Email,Cortef
6, 5, Adrenal System Deficient,Weight gain_ and depression though I am on other steroids and it may be a cumulative effect.,After having my Pituitary Gland removed steroid replacement was my only good option. I haven't experienced any of the highs mentioned by others though sleep can be an issue. That issue has been resolved with taking low doses of Ambien on occasion. When I don't follow the daily dosage protocols_ I forget or get busy_ headaches become an issue.,M,45,4  years5 3X D,5/25/2014Email,Cortef
7, 1, Doctor had no reason to prescribed,"I went in the hospital and came out a different person.  Steroid psychosis for 3 weeks. Cleveland Clinic said the Doctor here in Louisville ""had no right to give me this drug""  He did not even do a Total Cortisol.  Two test results normal and one slightly off.  I can't find it now as my memory is gone too.  I had 40 seizures per day and it took the doctors 14 months to find out.  Also Frontal Lobe Dysfunction_ Short term memory loss_ meningioma that has doubled in size in six months. 40 seizures per day.  This drug should never have been given to me!","This drug has devastated my life.Dr. Poorkay writes down that ""patient seems to be high"" - I wasn't on any medication to make me ""high"" - I took thyroid med_ insulin and Lexapro - same for many years.  I have not been able to function to clean my home at all.  Worst of all_ the hospital did not believe me when I said I was not absorbing nutrients from my food.  Cleveland Clinic told me I was ""absolutely correct in my diagnosis of myself"" - I had not been in a Louisville_ KY hospital for 15 years because of incompetence like this. I've always come out in worse shape.  Now_ my life has been destroyed and I am devastated at what this drug has done to me.  I had a photographic memory - It is gone.  I could write anything_ spell anything and now nothing.  I didn't sue him.  It would not bring back my sharp mind.  I am very upset and ill with other things.  This should never have happened when he didn't even do the correct testing.  My body is very ill after 35 years with Type I diabetes and now collegenous colitis.  After Cortef I have lost total bowel control at 57 years old.  I've lost two years of my life.  Pfzier should pay me as I live on Disability and this doctor wiped out what little savings I had for trial and error drugs I couldn't afford.  Now_ it is either food or meds for me.  The Hospital doesn't care either.  The worst part of this is that I felt God with me every day.  It was Joy not being ""high"" - Pure Joy.  I have been hurt",F,57,3  weeks10 mg. 2X D,5/8/2013Email,Cortef
8, 1, NO MEDICALLY NECESSARILY REASON,Seizures_ Frontal lobe dysfunction_ short term memory loss.  Has devastated my life.,"Cleveland Clinic Doctor told me that Dr. Poorkay in Louisville Norton's Hospital Endocrinology ""had no right to put me on this drug according to my test results""  She took me off the drug in three days.  I have never recovered.  My life has been devastated.",F,56,3  weeks10 mg. 2X D,1/17/2013Email,Cortef
9, 1, Cortisol was slightly off-Mistake,As a result of taking Cortef which I should never have been prescribed as the doctor did not do all the tests required. I told him in the hospital I did not want to be on a steroid. He told me he was only putting me on 5 mg. twice daily.  I would have no side effects from the drug.  He lied to me.,"I went into steroid psychosis and was out of my mind. I had to go to Cleveland Clinic and the Endocrinologist there_ Dr. LeeAnn O'Lansky said_ ""who put you on this drug!"" I told her and she said_ ""He had no right to put you on this drug!""  You need to get off asap.  I did over three days which was a little fast.  The psychosis lasted 3 weeks_ then my memory was gone_ I was having seizures_ getting lost and now have a menegioma in the rt. frontal lobe.  I have no short term memory and have Frontal Lobe Dysfunction.  This doctor has devastated my life.  I cannot write or spell as I used to.  I was a champion speller_ photographic memory and could write a letter to anyone quickly.  All I can do is type some now and remain confused most of the time.  I cannot clean my house. I function very slowly. I am on seizure medication as I was having 40 seizures per day. Prior to the Cortef I was fine.  I am so devastated I don't know what to do.  I was on disability due to other problems with Type I Diabetes_ but my Mind was FINE.  This doctor has ruined my independent life.  Does this sound competent to you? - He comes in my room and starts messing around with my insulin pump_ doesn't tell me what he is doing_ but he changes something.  In one minute a nurse comes in my room and says Dr. Poorkay says to put your pump back the way you had it. - His name is Medhi Poorkay.  I cannot tell you what this has done to my life.  I am beyond devastated as I can no longer functi",F,56,3  weeks10 mg. 2X D,1/14/2013Email,Cortef
10, 5, Lupus_ exhaustion from CFS,Only remote negative side effect is that I wake up bright eyed at 4:00 am. (not idea to only sleep 7 hours a day-actually caught on while typing this that is normal-would like to get in 8-9_ but 4:00 am wake up is small price to pay for me.   Which is better than me waking up at noon before and still being to exhausted to do anything beyond climbing back to bed an hour later.,"As I typed above- I just realized I sleep like a ""Normal person"" now vs requiring 14 hours and still not bring able to do much. I fought taking this medication for the 3 years it has been prescribed. I get 90 day supply_ but never touched it. Heard to many ""horror stories"". I'm kicking myself for not listening to Dr. much sooner. I wasted 3 years of my 30s resting.  I get slightly revved up feeling if I don't need as much so I adjust dose (with Dr's permission) as needed.  Some days I need 20mg. Some days 5 mg. I listen to my body. My entire family noticed a change immediately (even those who have no clue I take it). I feel like I felt prior to getting sick.  I've actually lost a pound. Starting to exercise (baby steps) water aerobics has been amazing for me starting out.  Obviously do research and listen to your Dr_ but please don't discount this med because of some random Internet post about how ""evil"" this med is. Saved my life and gave my husband/children their wife/ mom back. I have hope for my future. Good luck on your journey~",F,42,14  days10-20 1X D,6/21/2012Email,Cortef

Somewhat more  drinking and peeing.,Cortef gave me a life back when before I could only lie down_ doing next to nothing except for 4 hours per day of low/moderate energy.

14, 5, Adreanal Failure_ CFS_ FM,"Maybe once a week I will take a dose and I will experience a 20 minute period when it feels like I am taking ""speed"" instead of Cortef.",I was tested using the saliva method and was determind to be in adreanal failure. I started taking Cortef 4 times a day - I have never felt better. It literraly was a lifer saver. The only problem is that it is so artificial - if I forget to take a dose or a day's worth - I can't move. That's what scares me. Sometimes I think Cortef fools me in to thinking I am ALOT better thank I am.,F,24,3  months10 4X D,12/28/2010Email,Cortef

17, 4, Adrenal insufficiency,Some moodiness/mild depression_ small weight gain (less than 5lbs)_ but considerable stomach bloating (went from size 4 to size 8-10 in pants),Overall_ this medicine has helped a lot! I could barely move a lot of days_ and this has allowed me to return to working considerably more hours. Although taking something like this long term isn't anyone's ideal_ I don't know what I would do without it. The side effects are tolerable considering the huge gain.,F,25,3  months,12/4/2009,Cortef

20, 1, Adrenal Insufficiency,Psychiatric emergency.,"My very first (low) dose sent me into 48 hours of extreme agitation and suicidal behaviors.  During this entire period_ I did not sleep at all.  I could not stop pacing and crying and flailing my arms about.  I begged my husband to hide the car keys because I wanted to drive off a cliff.  The only reason that I did not allow myself to be taken to the hospital is that I was afraid they would lock me up in the psych ward for good.  It was only the vigilance of my dear husband that saved my life during this time (he didn't get a wink of sleep either_ for two days straight).  My understanding is that what I experienced was a very rare adverse reaction_ but I would advise anyone trying this drug for the first time to exercise extreme caution and make sure someone is there as a ""safety net"" in case things go very wrong_ as they did with me.  I cannot emphasize this strongly enough.",F,49,1  times,5/16/2009,Cortef
