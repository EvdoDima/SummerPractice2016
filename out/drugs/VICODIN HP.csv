2, 5, Swollen lymph nodes in stomach,Itchiness_ headaches.,After a long night in the emergency room with what seemed like appendicitis (it was actually swollen lymph nodes in my stomach)_ I was prescribed 15 Vicodin. It gave me the most solid sleep I have ever had in my life (causing me to sleep less than usual) and I had never felt more rested. When it would wear off I would get headaches almost worse than the swollen lymph nodes that lasted an hour or so_ but that negative was outweighed by how much better I felt.,F,18,7  days 1X D,3/26/2012,Vicodin hp
3, 4, ,Nausea _ irritability _ itching _ drowsy _euphoric feeling when I take this I feel extremely happy about random stuff. The next day I feel like I have a hangover .,Can be very addictive luckily I don't have anymore .i was prescribed this medicine after having laparoscopic surgery it gets rid of the pain pretty fast. I took the rest of the medicine to relax And to help me sleep but using Benadryl is non habit forming and more effective for sleeping. Be carefully taking this if you have a history of addiction .,F,19,  1X D,3/17/2012,Vicodin hp

6, 5, Helped me COPE with reality!,Euphoria! Feel great_ social_ active_ energized.,"I was taking the highest dose (cant remember the MG's). If you could only seperate the ""good stuff"" from the ecetominophen_ you would be ""all powerful""!! The world's greatest drug! Percodane and percocet dont do it. My Mom was elderly and on it for years and she didnt mind sharing. She is dead now_ and I really miss my Vic's :( I suffer from social-paranoia_ depression and panic attacks. This works better than ANY SSRI's or benzodiazipines to help me cope with social situations_ but no Doc on earth will give them for that reason.",M,57,2  years 2X D,9/2/2010Email,Vicodin hp

8, 4, Neck and back pain,"I cannot take this at night due to insomnia but that's about the only side effect I've ever had.  I do not get drowsy with this medication nor do I have an nausea or vomiting.  It's a ""lighter than air"" feeling in my head.","I can see how people could get addicted to this drug.  It makes me very ""happy"" but when I took it 10 years ago for back pain_ it didn't do anything at all.  No effects whatsoever. I only take it about 2 times a week at the most and will not be refilling my script for it.",F,35,5  weeks5-500 2X W,5/21/2010,Vicodin hp
9, 5, for cramps and muscle pain,helped me sleep when i needed to sleep so just drowsy when laying down otherwise was able to function at work on it,I was put on 10-325mg first after i went through a still birth...I had very bad cramping and although it did not take the pain away completly it did help enough that was was able to sleep when i wanted and was able to work when i had to...the last time i had it was for back and stomach pain from the depo shot...it was just the 5-325mg so not as strong but still helped enough again to sleep when needed and work when needed...way beter then what i was given next (Toradol). First time i was on it for about 4 or 5 weeks the second i was on it for only 3 days,F,24,3  days,1/3/2010Email,Vicodin hp

11, 4, hydrolectomy,The best hydrocodone pain reliever if it satisfies the pain for me it did at the begining but wore of fast. Simply the best,Don't have a hydrolectomy!!!,M,15,2  weeks,3/20/2009,Vicodin hp

13, 4, Cracked Wisdom Tooth,I didn't experience any negative side effects. I felt euphoric_ hard to concentrate_ finding pointless things to be amusing_ and a slight stomach ache that went away with a piece of bread_ crackers_ and some water.,It did the trick. I had been suffering horrible sharp shooting pains attributed to a cracked and exposed wisdom tooth. The pains were so bad that I would sweat and almost pass out. The vicodin did the trick_ and other than what I listed as the couple small side effects_ the pain went from horrible to nothing.,M,26,10  days,12/15/2008,Vicodin hp
14, 4, BACK PAIN AFTER ACCIDENT,A LITTLE CONFUSED_ VISION BLURRY_ AND MILD EUPHORIA_ INSOMNIA,THIS MEDICINE IS PRETTY GOOD_ I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MEDICINE OVER PERCOSET. HELPED THE BACK SPASMS I HAD IN MY BACK!,F,31,1  days,10/16/2008,Vicodin hp
15, 5, for pleasure,A few times were bad_ but soon enough my body became very tolorent to it. DO NOT take this medicine on an empty stomache(obviously) and do not snort if not absolutely needed. taking this medicine too much for pleasure (expecially snorting) may cuz the bones in the back of your neck to warp. yee not fun!. be careful everyone!!,,F,14, ,7/11/2008,Vicodin hp
16, 1, Chronic back pain,Sleepy_ dry mouth_ headaches.,Made me hyper and very_ very sad. I felt like I was having a breakdown. I would cry for an hour straight for the smallest reasons. It didn't help with my pain at all.,F,50,2  months,6/10/2008,Vicodin hp
17, 5, Pulmonary embolism,None.  It was a terrific pain killer with no down sides for me,I took the 10/500 tablets.  I needed two to kill the pain enough to sleep in the hospital and for the first three weeks or so after I got out.  Also took one occasionally during the day the first couple of weeks to deal with pain.  As the clot has started to dissolve_ I have now gone two weeks without taking any in the day_ and five nights in a row without any to sleep.  My spouse gets insomnia if she takes it at night_ but I have not had that effect.  I don't get any euphoria from it_ so I'm not worried about addiction.  It's the best pain reliever I've ever had; since I'm on coumadin_ I can't take aspirin or ibuprofen_ so this is great.,M,62,30  days,5/30/2008Email,Vicodin hp

20, 4, Wisdom extraction - all 4 impacted,Nothing too bad_ if I were relaxing and lying down_ it would knock me out_ but I also took it while I was at work_ and it didn't make me drowsy.,Really helped with the pain; almost too well_ as I could feel the pain coming back the second it started to wear off. I also decided to take one when I got a migraine and it actually helped.. it didn't get rid of it_ but it felt better. Keep in mind almost NOTHING helps my headaches.. so the fact that this did help somewhat_ was great.,F,23,7  days,2/12/2008,Vicodin hp
21, 2, Tooth pain,Anxiety_ panic attacks_ hives_ flushing (rash?),I have pre-existing anxiety_ but Vicodin puts me over the edge and sends me into a panic attack a few minutes after taking it.  So I would advise others with anxiety/depression issues to look into other options.After taking it a few times I began developing a few stray hives on arms_ hands_ legs_ face.  It only helped with the pain for a very short period of time_ about 30 minutes (and doctor directed to take once every 6 hours!).  I switched to Percocet instead_ problem solved.,F,22,5  days,12/29/2007,Vicodin hp
22, 4, Endometriosis,Extreme itchiness_ but no hives or anything.,"Didn't work all that great for my pain_ but it did offer some relief. I haven't felt ""high"" or anything like that.",F,41,2  days,12/6/2007Email,Vicodin hp
23, 4, root canal_ gum surgery,mild nausea_ talkativeness_ euphoria_ constipation_ hemmorhoids,"Vicodin is very good for pain after root canal. I've had two prescriptions and the dentist both time overprescribed; all I really needed was 6 or so and both times they gave me 30. Both times I went through the scripts_ sometimes for legitimate reason ( occassional mouth pain) but usually to get euphoria. The first time I got constipated at end of run & came down with hemmorhoids. So the second time I was more careful and took them ocassionally.When the script ran out_ I had no desire to obtain more (or look for some scag_ which is pretty similar!) because I'm very aware of addiction potential.You know the second time I said_ ""all I need is several"" to get through two days after surgery_ but he gave me 30 anyhow!",M,55,30  days,8/31/2007,Vicodin hp

25, 4, fractured wrist,I felt somewhat drowsy_ very constipated (rare for me)_ relaxed.,minimized the pain.  I  suggest you drink water and stay away from alcohol (can really damage your liver).  I didn't feel addicted_ maybe because I only took it for 3 days.,F,33,3  days,4/30/2007,Vicodin hp

28, 3, Herniated discs in back,I have thrown up a few times and experienced nausea from this drug but I LOVE vicodin... a lot... too much.. my dosage continues to increase,It really helps with my pain.  It is kind of scary though because I have noticed myself freaking out if I am getting low on my meds.  very very very addictive.,F,22,6  months,5/11/2006,Vicodin hp

30, 4, back surgery and related pain,sense of well being _ talkative_  headaches_ probably contributes to increased inability to sleep well.,currently reducing amount of vicodin_ hope to eliminate altogether.,F,64,18  months,8/10/2005,Vicodin hp
31, 1, Broken Shoulder,I felt angry and agitated.  Could not sleep.,This drug did nothing for my shoulder pain and made me want to grind my teeth.  I have no idea how anyone could get addicted to feeling angry and to the sleeplessness.  There are many better pain killers than this.,F,32,12  days,6/22/2005,Vicodin hp
