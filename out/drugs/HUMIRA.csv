0, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Suffered with chronic sinus infections which I attributed to humira_ other than that nothing to really speak of,It has worked wonders in both the joint pain issues and skin issues. Would recommend it to anyone suffering with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. It is very costly and you will definitely have to have insurance to afford it.,M,54,10  years40g 2X M,8/6/2016Email,Humira
1, 4, PsA,None so far,Noticed immediate improvement in joint pain and the numbness from the carpal tunnel caused by the PsA. Expected the injection (pen) to be painful based upon the doctor saying it's the most painful of the injections but felt nothing with my first two injections. Happy so far.,F,57,2  weeks40 mg 2X M,7/26/2016,Humira

4, 1, pyoderma  of the lung  crohns,My hands and feet r freezing like ice. I need quick relief between the pyodermagangrenosum and the crohns can't leave my house. If I had known it takes a month to work I would have yelled no!!,,F,49,6  days4Ã—40,7/24/2016Email,Humira

6, 1, Psoriatic Arthritis,Breathless_persistent cough_extreme fatigue_allergic reaction to Humira,Worked very quickly to clear psoriasis and stop pain in joints with no problems until recently after a chest infection. Didn't take when ill and after 2 courses of antibiotics thought it had cleared so did next injection. Next day I was covered in hives and coughing uncontrollably. Face swelled. Went Dr and sent for chest X-Ray told stop injection until results back. I have no energy at all. Sweating night and day_feel anxious/depressed generally unwell.,F,54,2  years40mg 2X M,7/20/2016Email,Humira
7, 2, Reactive Arthritis and UC,Severe fatigue_ depression_ anxiety_ impaired memory and cognitive ability_ increase in already terrible hand and wrist pain_ headaches_ widespread itching_ general feeling of being unwell.,My rheumatologist had told me Humira had helped his other patients so much_ and I was desperate for relief_ so I tried it. Sadly_ I have felt much worse since beginning treatment. My husband told me he definitely notices the negative changes_ and he is very concerned because I am always exhausted and in pain far more than I was prior to taking Humira. I am happy for those Humira helps_ and I had wished I could be one of them_ but that is not the case. I hope someone will discover another option for people like me. One that is safer_ has less side effects_ and will provide permanent relief.,F,44,5  weeks40 2X M,7/11/2016Email,Humira
8, 1, Psoriatic Arthritis,Caused my arthritis to worsen (it now affects all my joints. Before it was only my knees and occasionally ankles). Severe muscle weakness and pain (so much so that it is a struggle to take my own shirt off_ for example). Esophageal spasms that make it difficult to eat and are quite painful. Pustular psoriasis. I had never had any of these problems before humira_ and I truly believe humira caused them.,Wouldn't chance taking this drug. Wish I'd known the horrors it would could cause beforehand because I never would've taken it. I am now way worse than I ever was.,F,30,4  months40 mg,7/7/2016Email,Humira
9, 5, Crohns disease,Initial injection site pain and redness. Fatigue.,I take one shot a week. It's put my Crohns in remission. I do have increased fatigue_ but it's a small price to pay for not having active Crohns.The injection is VERY painful.,F,33,4  years.8 mL,7/6/2016,Humira
10, 4, Psoriasis,Diagnosed with fungal (thrust/yeast) infection in my throat and mouth. Now a cough. Going to go on a candida friendly diet and limit sugar as this feeds yeast. If you are not in balance when the immune system goes down the bad stuff has a party! A little scared I can't get it under control. Hard to swallow and very uncomfortable!,Helping the psoriasis big time!,F,42,1  months,7/6/2016Email,Humira
11, 3, Severe chronic ulcerative colitis/,I would get the occasional headache and get very itchy at injection site. Now I have sores in my mouth and the sides of my mouth are cracked and won't heal.. 7 months already.. Reg Dr said it was a fungus. I have a clear discharge from my nipples thought I had cancer went through a crap load of tests was told it was nothing. A year later still happening..  severe leg cramps to where it wakes me up at night_ to the point of me crying.. Brain fog_ moodiness_ crabby_now I have hives and I'm itchy from head to toe. Thought I was allergic to my soap and deodorant..  hair loss. Weight gain.always tired. Nose bleeds at least once a week.. sores in my nose.. constantly feeling like I have phlem in back of throat..  difficulty swallowing ( feels like I'm trying to swallow a golf ball) severe dry eyes..  Addressed some of these symptoms to my GI Dr before and my regular Dr. And not once did they say it could be the Humira.,I was on Remicade for about 6 years after I had my first bout with Pyroderma Gangrenosum which is caused by the Ulcerative colitis.  They took me off of that due to they were afraid that it would stop working. They put me on Humira.  Wasn't having too many issues at first. Now it seems I have the whole damn list of problems.  Stopped taking it.. hope all these new issues go away fast and the pyroderma doesn't come back,F,43,3  years40 mg / 2x,6/14/2016Email,Humira
12, 5, RA,I really never experienced any side effects other than fatigue_ which is expected with RA.,I have been on Humira 40 mg. for about 6 years. This is a Wonder Drug!  I don't have any joint pain like I did when I was first diagnosed. I realize some people have developed certain cancers_ but no one knows if it was already occurring before they took Humira.  I will stay on Humira the rest of my life if Medicare decides to help with payment!  Humira is a life changing drug!!,F,66,6  years40mg,6/9/2016Email,Humira

14, 2, Ulcerated Colitus,Fatigue and a 30 pound weight gain-,I am concerned of the long term side effects- My gastroenterology insist that the weight gain and fatigue is not a side effect from the Humira,F,53,2  years40MG 2X M,5/27/2016Email,Humira
15, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Just a liitle fatigue the day after injection,"Mercaptupoline (6 MP) almost killed me.  Put me in the hospital with a red blood cell count of 4.3 (normal about 17) making numerous transpusions necessary.  I was almost out of options for a very stubborn case of U.C. when my Doctor prescribed Humira.  What a miracle!  I have been taking Humira bi-weekly for a little over two years and my symptoms improved dramatically!  In fact_ after my most recent colonoscopy_ I wsa declared in remission.  My quality of life is back to where it was before my diagnoses!  I know there are certain risks and sideffects to every drug_ but I had very few options left other than the dreaded ""S"" word (Surgery!!)  Thank you Doctor_ and Thank you Humira for giving me my life back!",M,55, 40 1X O,5/26/2016,Humira
16, 5, Ankylosis Spondylitis_ Crohns,Very happy. Weakness for first 3 months then no side effects.,Best results for Spondylitis. Not so much for Crohns. Had 3 hospital stays for Crohns.,M,66,10  years40 mg,5/25/2016,Humira
17, 3, Ulcerative Colitis and Spondylitis,Small red bald spot in my hair. My hair just slid out my hair about 2 weeks ago and no new growth has started. Also I have Weird disturbing dreams the first few nights after the shot.,I don't know how much the Humira is helping. I still have blood in my stool every bm. If I eat normal portions of food or most foods no matter how little I get pain in the side. At the moment I am only eating jar fruit ( the kind in the fruit juice ) and eggs. I can't seem to tolerate any form of starch ie bananas_ raw veggies_ most veggies even if cooked_ dairy is a big no_ white sugar_ heavy fats_ tap and some spring water (distilled_ reverse Osmosis and other flat waters seem fine). I can handle bone broth and veggies juice from my juicer that does a good job removing fiber. But I don't have time to juice. I see my G.I. tomorrow to discuss this. I don't have diarrhea so perhaps the Humira has fixed that. I don't have a lot of blood in stool like before so perhaps it is helping. I think it is. I wish I could eat more food and I wish I didn't have this bald spot in my scalp. I don't think it helps with my AS or Uveitis at all so far. I will up date this (Lord willing) next month. I started Humira February 25_ 2016 and today is May 25_ 2016. I do not take any other medication.,F,41,3  months,5/25/2016Email,Humira

22, 4, Crohns,nothing major.  A little lightheaded and anxious.  6mp gave me high fevers. I had one resection of illeum_ before my first Humira treatments.,Was on it for 1 and 1/2 years and it stopped working.  Was put on Remicade which was terrific but would not last a full 4 weeks due to my antibodies attacking the medication. Doctor put me back on Humira starter pack and so far it seems to be working but again for how long. A friend with RA contracted lymphoma from Humira.but thankfully recovered.,,72,1  months40mg,5/20/2016Email,Humira
23, 5, Psoriasis,Hard to tell if I really experienced any side effects. One thing I noticed is that I had to start taking allergy pills and high blood pressure medicine shortly after I started the Humira. But_ none of them can be directly related to the usage of Humira.,Humira is actually my second stint of a 99% cured psoriasis. I used Enbrel for 2 years until the insurance denied it. Then I was put on Humira and up until recently was 99% free. Now I have about 50 spots of red all over (100% sure it's psoraisis. I am going to contact my dermatologist.
