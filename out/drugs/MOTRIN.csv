2, 3, Period cramps,Depression_ constant urination_ feeling like I have a fever only at night_ drowsy,The 600mg Motrin doesn't work that well.. So then I have to take two which adds up to 1200mg and that's a lot,F,15,3  days600mg,4/8/2016,Motrin

5, 3, wisdom tooth pain,Helped with pain and relax my body overall the first 2 days.Day 3 I started feeling disassociated with my surroundings and developed nausea. That night I experienced vivid dreams that eventually turned into full blown anxiety attacks. I was so scared to sleep I stayed up trembling the entire night until it was time for work the next morning. My tooth pain has returned but I'm too afraid to experience the psychological effects again. I'm shocked because I've taken motrin before and NEVER experienced anything like this before.,,F,23,3  days800,5/11/2015,Motrin
6, 2, Carpal tunnel,Never worked at the non prescription 400mg to help with my carpal tunnel syndrome. So I started taking 800mg and it helped but not very much. After a while of taking it my stomach would get upset and I would get worse acid reflux so I desided that since it barely worked that I would only take it when my wrists hurt too bad to do things like chopping veggies and brushing my teeth.,,M,15,10  days400 to 800,6/28/2014Email,Motrin
7, 4, in pain + needed to sleep,"The first time I started taking Motrin PM_ under my parents consent_ I started having really vivid dreams. by the third night of taking it_ the dreams turned into nightmares and they were SO VIVID_ I woke up with the sweats and crying. I went off of it after about a week_ but I decided to take it again_ not knowing that the medicine itself caused the dreams_ and some say I experienced ""inception."" And for some reason_ the drug also gave me premonitions. These premonitions_ I didn't know we're premonitions until the next day. Well in my dream_ I was dreaming_ and I had a premonition_ so I woke up inside my dream_ and what I was dreaming about in my dream happened in the dream I woke up to_ and that's when I realized I was dreaming_ and it became a lucid dream. I probably will take it again_ mainly because I like the feeling of being afraid_ but if you get really worked up over nightmares_ this will let you live your greatest fears_ so I do NOT recommend.",,F,16,1  days76 MG,2/1/2014Email,Motrin
8, 2, joint pain from old sports injury,I've taken Motrin in the past and don't remember any problems. But this time around_ I had nightmares so vivid that I forced myself awake and had a slight anxiety attack. The worst part is that the pain is now back. I won't be taking this again.,,F,24,1  days600,6/12/2013Email,Motrin

13, 5, Pain in back,Sleepiness,I love Motrin and will take this whenever I have any sort of pain. Why are people rating this so poorly? It works great_ no side effects_ except for sleepiness because the pain was keeping me awake. I ahev alot of back problems and it helps.,F,18,5  days600 2X D,8/15/2012,Motrin
14, 1, Hip pain,Extreme Stomach cramps_ bloating_ constipation,Helped with pain_ side effects weren't worth it :( perhaps because I took it without food.,F,31,3  days400mg 1X D,8/15/2012,Motrin
15, 3, shoulder pain,I could not figure out why I had sudden water weight gain_ to a shocking degree.  I found this site here where others report the same issue.  I will stop motrin today.  It helped only slightly with pain management.,,F,35,3  days600-800mg 1X D,6/22/2012,Motrin
16, 1, Torn ligaments_Swollen knees,Extreme Fluid Retention_ Wheezing_ Acid Reflux_ Anxiety_ Depression_ Nightmares and Panic attacks,Okay...allegedly this drug is supposed to aleviate pain and reduce inflammation; however_ it did none of the above.  In fact_ I quit taking the motrin 800 and began taking the standard excedrin (I had some pre-recall excedrin left) and it worked wonders.  Anywho_ since ceasing motrin 800 my body has naturally began relieving itself of access fluid and my ligament pain isn't as agitated anymore since it isn't experiencing pressure from the swelling anymore....well maybe the celery and dip I've been eating has helped aleviate fluid retention since it is a natural diuretic.  Best wishes to you all for a speedy recovery.,M,32,8  days800 mg 2X D,5/11/2012Email,Motrin
17, 1, headaches,I got asma. After I stopped taking motrin it went away.,If you are allergic to motrin it can cause asma.,F,65,  1X AN,4/12/2012,Motrin
18, 1, pain after breast augmentation,*severe* and painful constipation,I never normally have constipation. Once I worked out that the ibuprofen was causing it I immediately stopped taking it; other pain medications work just as well without this side effect.,F,36,14  days200 mg 1X D,4/4/2012,Motrin
19, 2, Rheumatoid arthritis & Fibromyalgia,Water retention in my legs that was so severe that when I elevated them to alleviate the swelling...the water pooled around my heart and landed me in the ER with arrhythmia and sky high BP!  This happened to me several times before I realized that the cause of my edema was NOT any of my health conditions but rather was caused by my pain medication.  Thankfully I finally made the connection and have had ZERO edema since stopping the motrin.  I am currently relying on hot baths_ Traumeel and the occasional Tylenol to manage my pain.,While this medication is_ without a doubt_ one of the best I have found for pain it also comes with a large kidney insult as a price tag.  I won't ever take it again.,F,47,3  years400-800MG 3X W,3/25/2012Email,Motrin
20, 1, arthritis,raised blood pressure_ relief wears off after 2 weeks,Natural cures are better; apple cidar vinegar can effectively cure arthritis and headaches; vitamin C crystals can help pain at high doses; see doctoryourself.com. Hyaluronic acid cured my sprained ankle which I believe happened due to a lack of synthovial fluids in our joints as we age.

21, 1, sciatica pain,wasn't effective treating pain and woke me up in the middle of the night repeatedly (about every hour) with major anxiety and panic attack. racing heart_ loud sharp ringing in ear and nightmares.,never will use again!,F,29,3  days38 1X D,12/4/2011Email,Motrin
22, 3, Level 2 to 3 Ankle sprain,Ringing in the ears_ like when you put a sea shell over your ear. Very Vivid dreams_ no panic attacks_ but I'm  susceptible to them.,Dr. doubted me when I told him about noise in ears. First time I've had the dreams_ but don't generally take Motrin. Glad I found this site_ today is the last day_ will switch to Aspirin tomorrow.,M,57,15  days600mg 3X D,10/24/2011,Motrin
23, 1, headache,Stomach cramps_ bloating_ panic attacks_ anxiety_ weird dreams depression.,I usually take Equate Ibuprofen but in hospital they have MOTRIN.  Same medication supposedly.   It made me have cramps and still have them over a week later.   After the 3rd pill I found myself being nervous_ then panicky_ then anxious and when I went to sleep I had weird dreams.   I finally had the nurse walk me up and down halls at 2:00AM because I was so figidity.  Since I can take ibuprofen brand Equate without this happening_ Motrin must have an additive to make patient feel good so they'll use it but it made me a psychological mess.   No more Motrin.   I'm glad to read I'm not the only one who had psychological problems from this medication.   Try Walmart's Equate brand.,F,73,3  days 3X W,1/10/2011Email,Motrin
24, 1, Tooth pain,Dizziness_ heart racing_ felt like I was having a heart attack.,"I took Motrin regulary for at least a year for bad tooth pain.  Then I started having these ""panic attacks.""  I made the connection - on days I took Motrin_ I would have a ""panic attack"" that night.  I quit taking the Motrin and I haven't had another ""panic attack"" since then.  Also_ I have two friends who had been taking Motrin for long periods of time for back and neck pain.  BOTH of them started having ""panic attacks_"" and their doctors said they needed anti-anxiety meds.  Both of them stopped taking Motrin_ and no more ""panic attacks.""  Doctors need to be informed about this side effect so that they won't be prescribing anti-anxiety meds unneccessarily!",F,51,1  years 1X D,12/13/2010Email,Motrin
25, 5, for pain after surgery_ etc.,Never experienced any bad side effects_ but you have to follow directions and take this medicine with food or milk_ to prevent stomach upset.,I have always been exceedingly happy with this medication_ it works better for me than any other pain reliever. After I had my children_ it was the only thing that could take away my pain. I had tried darvocet_ tylenol 3s_ vicodin_ and others but only ibuprofen eased my pain and never made me feel loopy.,F,22,2  years800 mg 4X D,11/30/2010,Motrin
26, 3, Degenerative Disc Disease_Migraines,I developed severe GERD_ with esophagitis,This was prescribed in a formula with 30mg of Codeine_  It works good for me for moderate pain_ but I developed severe gastric problems because of it that took 6 months of Prevacid and complete abstinence from Ibuprofen to heal.  I now take it ocassionally (1-2/day_ 2x per week)  with Prevacid and have had no side effects.,M,48,2  years400 3X D,8/30/2010Email,Motrin

29, 5, Chronic Back pain,There was a time that I stopped taking Motrin and when I went back to it_ it gave me small bumps under my cheeks. They went away after 1/2 hour.,I surf every weekend and could not if I didn't take Motrin.,M,49,20  years600 MG 2X D,3/25/2010,Motrin
30, 3, inflammed trapezius muscle,Severe discomfort of upper abdomen and extreme bloating.  Could not wear my normal clothes without extreme discomfort.  Clearly no digestive issue; but did not know what it was until recently,The doctor suggested I take anti-inflammatory meds for my muscle problems.  I will now discontinue using Motrin and try to find a substitute,F,56,60  days220 mg 2X D,3/25/2010,Motrin
31, 5, FOOT BONE SPURS,NO SIDE EFFECTS,I literally could not walk without Motrin.,M,67,20  days800 3X D,3/8/2010Email,Motrin
32, 4, Back pain; anti-inflammatory,Stomach pain; ulcers,This stuff is HARD on my stomach.  I have to take omeprazole to protect it when I use Motrin or Advil.  But it really is effective for my sciatica and as a general anti-inflammatory.,M,45,2  years600mg 3X D,2/18/2010Email,Motrin
33, 5, pain_ inflammation,None until I over-used it_ and now if I take it my guts are sore for three days afterward.,Ibuprofen is the best NSAID I have used. Unfortunately I over-used it (in an anti-inflammatory regimen on the recommendation of my doctor) and developed a sensitivity to it so that if I take more than 400 mg or so I have lower abdominal soreness for three days afterward. I still use it occasionally for severe pain as it's the only OTC painkiller that I can count on to really knock out the inflammation.,F,23,10  days,1/1/2010,Motrin
34, 4, depression,Helps boost my Zoloft response for depression without triggering anxiety unresponsive to Zoloft. I would take Cymbalta_ which works similar to NSAIDS_ but that would make me too hyper. I take a small dose of Lithium Carbonate at night to make sure the Motrin doesn't give me the stomach nasties and to make sure the Motrin doesn't turn up the borderline hyperthyroid and make me anxious and nervous.  I do have back spasms. That's why I discovered how Cox-2 inhibitors are serotonin and norepinephrine enhancers and actually boost an antidepessant's effects. No wonder I had a depression-free summer. I was taking Motrin for back spasms and was wondering why I was feeling better than I have had in four years.,For those who have anxiety_ depression_ and mood swings_ please keep in mind that Motrin can deplete folic acid and that *can* lead to depression. You may try folic acid rich foods to see if that may be the problem. Over time I eat lots of folic acid foods but find that they make me hyper_ so I also get a plus from Ibuprofen's anti-folate effect.  I have high blood histamine that is worsened by folic acid.,F,45,5  months,11/16/2009,Motrin
35, 3, Severe Menstrual cramps from  IBS,none.,It helps some of the pain from severe cramps but that's it.,F,26,7  days,11/6/2009,Motrin
36, 2, back/neck pain,I had an increase in gas/bloating_ hemorrhoid pain_ and bruising. I've had bouts of vertigo_ ringing in the ears_ and nausea.,,F,48,10  days,8/11/2009,Motrin
37, 3, inflammation post hysterectomy,After taking for 3 weeks it as prescribed 3x daily after a total hysterectomy_ I developed significant stomach upset and chronic heartburn (which I've never had before).  I did not how hard Motrin can be on the stomach until I looked on the web.  Wish I had known.  I don't think my post surgical pain was much from inflammation_ so I could have stopped it sooner_ or just taken a lower dose_ like Advil.,,F,51,25  days,6/23/2009,Motrin
38, 5, rheumatoid arthritis,malabsorption_ pernicious anemia_ GERD,I have taken 800 mg 3x a day for 27 years-yes_27.  From time to time the doctor would make me try another NSAID but Motrin has always been by far the most effective w/ inflammation. I would sometimes forget I had arthritis (dx'd at age 16) but if I didn't take the motrin_ after a couple of days literally could not move. Never had any obvious side effects-HOWEVER...recently after long and winding series of tests discovered I have GERD (no heartburn_ didn't know this was possible_ but diagnosed via endoscopy) which caused complete lack of B12_ neurological damage in legs_ and various other GI issues including slightly enlarged liver (and I am a non-drinker). Who knew? Sad_ though because now I have to find another NSAID and Motrin just worked so well.,F,43,27  days,6/14/2009,Motrin
39, 2, Severe Lower Back Pain,Headache and stomach pains,I've been taking 800mg tablets and as the medicine starts wearing off I get a headache that doesn't go away untill I take another tablet.I also get occasional stomach pains that come really fast and go away really fast. It's odd.,F,39,4  days,6/8/2009,Motrin
40, 1, post cesarean abdomninal abscess,I had ongoing abdominal pain after my abscess healed_ but kept taking motrin for the pain. After a CT Scan & colonoscopy_ it was discovered that the extended motrin use had caused inflammation in my large intestine. As soon as I stopped taking ibuprofen to treat the pain_ the pain stopped completely. I felt 100 times better within a week.,None of my doctors warned me about prolonged motrin use. I thought it was safer than narcotics with a new baby. I only thought to mention it to my GI specialist after my nurse friend warned me that I had been taking it too long. It is really dangerous to take it regularly for extended periods of time.,F,35,5  months,4/24/2009,Motrin
41, 2, Knee injury,the first day or two_ just had the water retention_ now severe vertigo which can't be attributed to anything else,,F,46,4  days,4/13/2009,Motrin
42, 4, Wisdom Teeth and Head Pain,Very mild Dysphasia_ cannot concentrate on typing that well or any common task_ lose track of thoughts easily.,Works good and I like how it doesnt give you the high feeling like Vicoden does but the dysphasia bothers me the most but not too much.,M,17,3  weeks,3/26/2009,Motrin
43, 3, shoulder pain_ arthritic,mild relief in a.m. when it is intense. On motrin 600 mg daily as needed,Unusual nosebleeds. Stopped_ but will try again.,F,70,3  days,2/17/2009,Motrin
44, 1, pain,Anxiety_ depression_ insomnia. Anger and weepiness. On 800+ mg/day per doctor's order for pain flare-ups. Also taking maintenance oxycontin and oxyIR and Lyrica for osteo pain.,Very sneaky drug. Rxlist.com shows 1% or fewer taking Motrin get anxiety_ depression_ and insomnia. No one would suspect an nsaid could do this_ but I finally figured it out. No more Motrin for me!,F,54,3  months,1/31/2009,Motrin
45, 2, plantar  fasciitis,After two weeks of being on 800mg three times a day I became very bloated. I'm normally a size 6 and had to wear size 10. I was suppose to stay on it 3 X's a day for three weeks_ however_ I would rather deal with the pain than have stomach problems not to mention I wasn't sleeping well.,,F,48,2  weeks,1/23/2009,Motrin
46, 5, broken ribs,none,,F,42,9  days,1/21/2009,Motrin
47, 4, pain from possible staph infection,Certainly nausea_ copious gas and I guess accompanying bloatedness; maybe some sleep interruption.,Seems surely to relieve the pain and burning sensation at the infection site.  So much so that I mistakenly think the wound area is better healed than it really is.  Pain relief? Great_ so far.  Side effects?  Jury is still out -- its been only 2.5 days.,M,50,2.5  days,12/2/2008,Motrin
48, 3, fever,,,F,20,2  days,11/2/2008,Motrin
49, 1, Severe back pain...,Terrible stomach aches.,After I had my baby_ I suffered from severe back pains. I was prescribed this to reduce pain in my back_ but it did NOTHING. All it did was give me terrible stomach aches. It didn't touch the pain at all. It was a joke medicine to me. I have switched to Flexeril_ which is working wonders.,F,22,14  days,9/25/2008,Motrin
50, 5, Absessed Tooth,None-I usually eat before I take it_ so I am not sure how it would be on empty stomach.,600 motrin and 500 tylenol killed the pain_ exept at night time. If I took it Tylenol PM with the Motrin early enough I can actually get some sleep,F,29,5  days,8/25/2008,Motrin
51, 3, Post-hysterectomy pain,Nausea_ headache,I took 600 mg every six hours for almost six days. The first three days it worked great. Day four I had nausea and a headache. Day five I switched back to Darvocet-N for temporary relief to get a break from the Motrin. Day six I tried the Motrin again -- nausea despite taking with food and the headache was worse than ever. Tomorrow_ I'll go without. If I get a bad bought of pain_ I'll try regular strength acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead.,F,49,6  days,8/21/2008,Motrin
52, 5, Osteoarthritis,Slight stomach upset_ slight dizziness,Motrin in prescription form is Ibuprofen in a large 800 mg dose. The large 800 mg dose worked well for me but b/c of the stomach upset_ I take Advil or Motrin IB over the counter(same medicene_ lower dosage). It comes in 200mgs so I can take the smallest effective dose. Taking the smaller dose helps a little with the stomach upset. The smaller dose took away the dizziness as well.,F,31,5  years,7/22/2008,Motrin
53, 1, knee_ hip and back pain,SEVERE stomach pain.  Ringing in ears.  Some dizziness_ but the worst was the stomach pain and nasea.,This isn't fit to take.  All docs want to do is push medication_ rather than actually fix the root cause of the problem.  I never didn't take the med_ even after the doc prescribed because I don't like to take any sort of medication.  But the pain got so bad_ I gave in and took one 800 mg. pill on a full stomach.  Was fine for about 8 hours_ but then had horrible stomach pain and nasea for 20 hours-plus after taking just one pill.,F,45,1  times,5/25/2008,Motrin
54, 3, Shoulder strain/injury,Bad constipation_ gas.  I had to to take Metamucil.  A high-fiber diet did not do the trick.,"I was prescribed 800mg to take 3 times a day for 2 weeks.  It took a week before I felt some relief.  With what sounds like a high dosage_ I expected it to work better.  My first time taking it was over 25 years ago (I believe it was pretty new on the market then) when I got severe menstrual cramps.  Back then_ I would have rated it a 5.  It worked FAST_ and I don't remember side effects.  But I just took it the first or second day of my cycle_ and I think I only took one each day.  About 6 years ago I was prescribed Motrin to ease the ""killer cramps"" I got occasionally which was related to a previous major surgery even years earlier.  It was like eating candy.  It did NOTHING.  I would have given it a 1 for that.  My doctor gave me Vicodin instead when I said Motrin wasn't strong enough. (Vicodin WORKED)  Also_ since the cramps were so bad_ it'd make me throw up.  That would make me not only throw up the food I was to to take Motrin with_ but up would come the medication as",F,46,2  weeks,5/24/2008,Motrin
55, 5, Menstrual cramps,none,Motrin tends to work better than Tylenol for menstrual cramps.,F,18, ,4/28/2008,Motrin
56, 1, Rheumatoid Arthritis. joint pain,high blood pressure,Never had a blood pressure problem until I began taking this drug on a regular basis to control pain/inflammation.  This NSAID is definitely not for me!,F,45,4  months,4/16/2008,Motrin
57, 1, plantar fasciitis,severe cramping in upper abdomen,After taking 800mg motrin every 8hrs for two weeks_ my plantar fasciitis was better but I developed a severe pain in my right upper abdomen. So severe that I went to the emergency room and ended up having my appendix removed and IT WASNT MY APPENDIX!!!I will never take a drug again unless it is a life threatening reason to do so.,F,50,2  weeks,3/31/2008,Motrin
58, 4, fever,peeling of skin on hands,after 6 days of giving my son motrin for a fever noticed skin was peeling from his hands. Bottom of the soles of his feet also very dry.,M,7,5  days,3/23/2008,Motrin
59, 5, tendonitus bursitus shoulder,If I take 800mg on an empty stomach it will give me a bad stomach ache.,Motrin is better for me than even any perscription painkiller I have taken. It reduced the inflamation in my shoulder enough so I could sleep at night and have so far avoided surgery. After suffering with debilitating pain in my shoulder while 9 months pregnant I was thrilled when I had my baby and could take Motrin.(You cannot take it in the third trimester of pregnancy due to blood thinning),F,33,2  months,2/19/2008,Motrin
