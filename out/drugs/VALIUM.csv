0, 1, Anxiety,Joint pain and muscle weakness.,Highly addictive_ never touch it,M,64,8  months10,8/4/2016,Valium
1, 1, Dr was an imbecile,Memory issues_ zero rem sleep_ fatigue_ tolerance and withdrawal,A coworker offered me this after I mentioned I was dealing with depression/anxiety...that was the second biggest mistake of my life. The first biggest mistake was being in a relationship with a controlling fiance that ruined my life_ how I didn't see the red flags from the start and ditched the relationship will forever haunt me. I started dealing with depression/anxiety not long after the relationship started and I don't usually take crap from anybody but this person was a professional manipulator and I was an unsuspecting victim. My Dr at first wouldn't prescribe it saying it was addictive and after giving me something else that made me worse he gave me a bottle of over a hundred pills and kept me on it over two years. After awhile the drug did nothing and had to increase my dose...this was a sign to stop. After awhile I developed tinnitus and came across a terrible website ran by a person that despised big pharma_ the site said value can cause tinnitus and right away I started tapering off without telling my Dr which wasn't the best idea but I was sick and tired of my Dr leaving me on meds forever. Two weeks after a one month taper I started having severe w/d and didn't realize it was from stopping the valium since I stopped it weeks before. I mentioned to my Dr that I needed something for anxiety and he never asked about the valium!  The other pill was too short lasting and I ended up getting much worse.My Dr wasn't paying attention to meds and was beyond careless.,M,41,2  years,6/27/2016Email,Valium
2, 1, Panic attacks,None,I take 2.5mg twice a day.been taking them 3 years now and I go 2 to 3 days without on the weekends. Don't have any side effects that I know of.,M,,3  years2.5mg,6/12/2016,Valium
3, 1, Social anxiety disorder,None while on the medication except for occasional loss of memory. Worked wonders for my anxiety.,THIS IS POISON!  DONOT START TAKING IT!!!  Yes_ this worked wonders for my anxiety_ in fact_ it's the only thing that really works for me; however_ if and when you decide to get off whether by choice or because you've reached tolerance_ you will go through absolute hell because of withdrawal. Be prepared to experience hell on earth for about 18 months after you stop. DO NOT stop cold turkey. You can have seizures or die. Talk to your doctor about tapering off but even then you will go through hell. Valium is meant to be prescribed for temporary use (no longer than 2 weeks). My doctor and many other doctors prescribe benzos (Valium_ Xanax_ klonipin_ Ativan_ etc) for months or years. Benzos are dangerous!!!  Do your research before you put this poison in your body!!!,F,34,3  years20mg/day,5/8/2016Email,Valium
4, 1, Anxiety from depression,Lack of deep sleep_memory issues_fatigue and tolerance.,A coworker offered me some valium one day when I made the horrific mistake of mentioning I was dealing with depression/anxiety. Never should he have offered me any and taking it was retarded. Right after I took it I had a severe headache and my coworker_ said maybe it wasn't for me. I should've brought the rest of the pills back the next day!!! Instead three weeks later I decide to take another one and no headache and almost coma like calm. I asked my Dr for valium and he refused saying it was addictive and gave me something else that made me much worse. I then went back to my Dr saying a coworker gave me some valium and right away the Dr gave me a massive bottle of pills...I guess it wasn't addictive after all. Dr kept me on it for over two years the fool and I ended up taking myself off and went through delayed withdrawals and my Dr never even asked about the valium!!! Don't take this stuff_ never! You read good things about this but when you go off good luck_ these drugs should be banned and the inventors behind them sued till they end up taking them themselves. Thanks Dr Sloan for ruining my life. DO NOT TAKE BENZOS_YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY_ I wish I never touched any big pharma med...EVER! Peace,M,41,2  years,3/21/2016Email,Valium

8, 5, Anxiety Attacks - Panic Disorder,None,This is a wonder drug for anxiety sufferers_ if it works for you_ if it stops your panic_ then take them and get back to living your life!! I was agoraphobic and thought I was seriously losing my mind_ then Valium was prescribed 3 X a day and wow!! I got my life back! I stop taking them for periods of time_ I've never been addicted to them. I can go months without taking them_ then take them daily for a few weeks_ then off them cold turkey for a year! It's just as needed really....... I have just been switched to Ativan (Lorazepam) 1mg twice a day as I'm relocating interstate and my panic is back badly. So will see how I go on this new med,F,32,10  years2.5,3/8/2016,Valium
9, 1, GAD/Meiners/panic attacks,It helped with the vertigo but doesn't help the anxiety or panic attacks at all. I had a huge panic attack driving today and I've already taken 10mgs.,I was never told this drug would have to be tapered and I'm stuck having to take it. I have read all the forums and with my anxiety I'm scared to try to taper reading all the bad reactions ppl have with it.,F,46,3  years20mg,3/2/2016,Valium
10, 3, bruised ribs,Nausea,Allowed me to find a comfortable position as bruised ribs hurt worse than natural labor (no epidural or meds). After 5 days of no sleep I finally got a few hours of sleep thanks to the valuim however it all went down hill after becoming nauseated and throwing up. Ultimately I don't like being in excruciating pain from having bruised ribs and being violently sick as it only made my ribs and chest muscles hurt 10x more.,F,29,3  days2mg,2/29/2016,Valium
11, 1, Panic Disorder,Made my body feel very heavy_ and like my legs were rubbery. Had difficulty with walking and coordination. Also felt dizzy and somewhat high; eyes felt heavy and sleepy. Did not like.,Prescribed an alternative to lorazepam saying it wears off more quickly. I definitely prefer Ativan. It find that it works quickly and effectively to relieve panic by calming the mind and relaxing the body_ but not so much that it makes it difficult to function.,F,43,1  days5mg 1X AN,11/20/2015Email,Valium
12, 5, Back spasms,No negative side effectes to my knowledge.,I have been suffering severe back spasm pain every few days for the past week. The first day I was injected with Valium at the ER and it helped a great deal. The second time_ which was about five days later_ I tried EVERYTHING and it didn't relieve the spasm or the pain; heating pad_ 600 mg of Motrin_ icy hot_ lying down_ hot shower_ nothing. I finally went to my last resort of oral Valium. It took about half an hour to kick in but when it did_ I finally felt relief in my back and was finally able to sleep. I don't want to rely on this drug because of addiction that runs in my family_ so I will be seeing a primary care doctor to see why my back is doing this and take the actions necessary to deal with this problem. Bottom line: great drug for back spasms_ as long as you take it as a last resort to lessen the risk of dependence on it.,M,21,4  days5 mg,11/14/2015,Valium

15, 5, Pain_ Anger_ Tension_ GAD,NONE,Valium has changed my life. Im a Police Officer and fitness enthusiast_ with an extremely stressful life. Have suffered from anxiety since a teen. The repressed anger from dealing with scumbags daily and some pretty intense spinal injuries_ has left me in a state of pure tension and uneasyness. Valium totally erases all of my issues. I have increased my dose from 5mg to 15mg over two years. But occassionally i will go a week only taking 10mg a day. The key is abstaining from alcohol. Alcohol +Valium = BAD. Stay very hydrated and exercise. The name brand is much better than the generic. If you have insurance_ tell doc u want name brand only. If you are uninsured_ youll have to stick with generic because the name brand costs $575.00 for 60 pills without insurance. I will take valium indefinitely. The quality of life improvement outweighs the only negative factor of valium_ which would be coming off of it.,M,40,2  years10-20 MG,9/28/2015Email,Valium
16, 1, Back pain,People love this drug because they think they can stop taking it and not get any withdrawal symptoms. Diazepam has a half life of 100-200 hours and it builds up massively in your body if you take it every day_ or worse still_ multiple times a day. If youve been taking 10mg a day for a year then you will have 2000mg-3000mg of it in your body when you quit_ so you won't experience any withdrawal symptoms for around a month. This has been scientifically proven. So just because you quit for a week cold turkey and get no Withdrawals_ don't think you're past the most difficult phase.,This drug accumulates massively in your body_ causes dementia/ brain damage (been proven in recent studies) and will ruin your life once you come off it.,M,55,10  days10MG,9/28/2015,Valium

20, 5, Muscle spasms/sleep,Dry mouth_ lethary in the morning_ dizziness.,This drug in low doses helps with muscle spasms and the pain associated with this. This will in turn reduce anxiety caused by pain. It also helps the body heal because it is relaxed and resting at night. It is longer acting than other drugs in this same family given for muscle spasms or anxiety associated with pain_ such as lorazepam. The longer acting aspect of the drug allows for a longer rest period because if the peak and decline of the drug.

24, 1, Insomnia,None,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG OR ANY BENZO'S. I had no idea that I had to be weaned off of 5 mg of Valium. I went into acute w/d and I had terrible anxiety (never suffered any anxiety prior to taking it) high blood pressure_ fast pulse_ muscle cramps_ blurred vision_ tininitus_ walking felt odd_ terrible irregular periods_ sweats_  short term memory loss_ my hair was shedding and breaking for 5 weeks_ terrible insomnia_ I lost 7 pds in one week_ agoraphobic_ terrible fear_  auditory hallucinations. I am currently off the drug 20 weeks now and most of these terrible side effects have all abated. I am still dealing with short term memory cognitive issues_ and a little anxiety. I never had any anxiety prior to taking this drug. DO NOT TAKE VALIUM OR ANY BENZO. THEY DOWN REGULATE YOUR GABA A RECEPTORS AND THEY TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO UP REGULATE!!

Taking 5mg of Valium 30 mins prior made getting and IV and laying in the MRI machine a breeze. Second time was when I was to get a pin and wire removed from my fractured finger (in Dr's office w/no sedation or pain killer). I felt no anxiety whatsoever when the nurse called me back. The procedure went so smoothly b/c I wasn't anxious. I had no side effects at all_ just a nice calm feeling.,F,37,2  days5 1X D,4/27/2015Email,Valium

32, 1, anxiety due to Claritin-D,HORRIBLE--From the first dose_ it CAUSED muscle spasms...I thought I was having a seizure so I immediately took more!  Muscle spasms_ brain fog_ suicidal thoughts_ burning sensations of lava pouring through my body_ and a burning the size of a grapefruit on the right side of my head non-stop for a month; full body shakes_ chills_ spasms_ complete loss of appetite_ severe constipation_ and interrupted sleep (only let me sleep 2-3 hours at a stretch)_ leading to insomnia_ severe tinnitus,I wish I had never taken this_ and after only 8 weeks_ I don't know if it has permanently ruined me.  I tried to cold turkey Jan 27_ but by a week later I had to take 1 dose_ and by the second week I was going to jump out the window...I had been up non-stop for 4 days and nights_ and had only slept 2 hours a night the days before that...going from bed to bathtub with severe spasms_ complete inability to cope or interact...From the first dose_ I started running to neurologists thinking I had some rare disease that caused burning sensations in my body_ and I had 2 MRIs_  a CT_ EEGs_ BAERs_ EMGs....a $10_000 work up only to be told everything was normal...but how was that possible when I was in this much pain? Finally when the third ENT doc prescribed Klonipen for my tinnitus (which THANK GOD I NEVER TOOK) did I find the benzosupport.org website_ and I discovered all my problems were caused by the valium. I am not on week 3 of withdrawal_ after re-instating a 4 day taper last week after the failed cold turkey attempt (NEVER NEVER try cold turkey_ I do believe now it can kill you).  I almost lost my job over this ( I am an RN) and started making scary mistakes at work.  Luckily I only work 2 days a week so I could spend the rest of time in bed or the bath.

36, 1, Migraine_ neck pain,I began taking generic Valium for migraine relief & associated neck pain. During menopause_ I had severe migraines almost daily. Valium helped with the intense neck  pain & at first it worked very well. However_ I kept upping the dose when 10 mgs stopped working and then I became physically dependent.,I reached my max at 40 mgs per day. After 5 years_ I began to experience deep muscle and back pain. I never associated this with Valium until I read an article about long term use of Benzodiazepines causing RA-like pain. My back_ knees & leg muscles ached constantly. I could barely walk. I began to taper down to 5 mgs a day. My pain did not subside until I began tapering the last 10 mgs. I noticed a marked difference in pain level. The withdrawal was not bad. I barely remember it. Of course_ I barely remember anything anymore. My short term memory has been severely compromised. I don't know if it will ever return. It is a definite side-effect of Valium_ including the joint & muscle pain.,F,67,20  years10 4X D,1/11/2015Email,Valium

This in combination with Zoloft_ also taken at night has helped a great deal.  I can now sleep again with minimal night terrors and the cry valve has been adjusted appropriately.

The beauty is I don't need to take them every day. When my mother was dying of cancer_ Doctors put me on every type of anti-depressant_ each gave me a horrible side effect.They made me sick and did nothing to relieve anxiety_ actually they made me feel more anxious. Valium has been the only drug that not only helps me sleep_ but relieves the anxiety. Actually_it proves to me that ""nothing horrible will really happen""_ so I can deal with life's dilemma's without taking anything. It has been a type of ""behavior modification"". Doctors and laypeople have a tendency to give this drug a bad connotation_ even so far as to accuse us of being ""drug addicts"". I know this has been a ""lifesaver"" for the victims of horrible traumatic experiences. It has allowed us to function as ""normal individuals"" and not dwell on the unfortunate.",M,61,40  years5 0r 10 1X D,1/23/2014Email,Valium

Ativan and Xanax far more effective for short-term immediate-release anxiety treatment.  Yes_ Valium is the most sedating of these anxiolytics_ however_ I was up to 45 mg (15 mg 3X a day) of Valium_ quite a high dose_ and it just never did the trick for me.  I took more and more and my anxiety wouldn't be quelled.  Depending on your own situation_ I would recommend Klonopin or especially a combination which I am now on of Xanax and Xanax XR for effective anxiety treatment_ which_ while less sedating than Valium_ is a great mixture of long-release and immediate-release relief.,M,29,3  years15 mg 3X D,12/22/2013,Valium
