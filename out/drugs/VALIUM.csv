0, 1, Anxiety,Joint pain and muscle weakness.,Highly addictive_ never touch it,M,64,8  months10,8/4/2016,Valium
1, 1, Dr was an imbecile,Memory issues_ zero rem sleep_ fatigue_ tolerance and withdrawal,A coworker offered me this after I mentioned I was dealing with depression/anxiety...that was the second biggest mistake of my life. The first biggest mistake was being in a relationship with a controlling fiance that ruined my life_ how I didn't see the red flags from the start and ditched the relationship will forever haunt me. I started dealing with depression/anxiety not long after the relationship started and I don't usually take crap from anybody but this person was a professional manipulator and I was an unsuspecting victim. My Dr at first wouldn't prescribe it saying it was addictive and after giving me something else that made me worse he gave me a bottle of over a hundred pills and kept me on it over two years. After awhile the drug did nothing and had to increase my dose...this was a sign to stop. After awhile I developed tinnitus and came across a terrible website ran by a person that despised big pharma_ the site said value can cause tinnitus and right away I started tapering off without telling my Dr which wasn't the best idea but I was sick and tired of my Dr leaving me on meds forever. Two weeks after a one month taper I started having severe w/d and didn't realize it was from stopping the valium since I stopped it weeks before. I mentioned to my Dr that I needed something for anxiety and he never asked about the valium!  The other pill was too short lasting and I ended up getting much worse.My Dr wasn't paying attention to meds and was beyond careless.,M,41,2  years,6/27/2016Email,Valium
2, 1, Panic attacks,None,I take 2.5mg twice a day.been taking them 3 years now and I go 2 to 3 days without on the weekends. Don't have any side effects that I know of.,M,,3  years2.5mg,6/12/2016,Valium
3, 1, Social anxiety disorder,None while on the medication except for occasional loss of memory. Worked wonders for my anxiety.,THIS IS POISON!  DONOT START TAKING IT!!!  Yes_ this worked wonders for my anxiety_ in fact_ it's the only thing that really works for me; however_ if and when you decide to get off whether by choice or because you've reached tolerance_ you will go through absolute hell because of withdrawal. Be prepared to experience hell on earth for about 18 months after you stop. DO NOT stop cold turkey. You can have seizures or die. Talk to your doctor about tapering off but even then you will go through hell. Valium is meant to be prescribed for temporary use (no longer than 2 weeks). My doctor and many other doctors prescribe benzos (Valium_ Xanax_ klonipin_ Ativan_ etc) for months or years. Benzos are dangerous!!!  Do your research before you put this poison in your body!!!,F,34,3  years20mg/day,5/8/2016Email,Valium
4, 1, Anxiety from depression,Lack of deep sleep_memory issues_fatigue and tolerance.,A coworker offered me some valium one day when I made the horrific mistake of mentioning I was dealing with depression/anxiety. Never should he have offered me any and taking it was retarded. Right after I took it I had a severe headache and my coworker_ said maybe it wasn't for me. I should've brought the rest of the pills back the next day!!! Instead three weeks later I decide to take another one and no headache and almost coma like calm. I asked my Dr for valium and he refused saying it was addictive and gave me something else that made me much worse. I then went back to my Dr saying a coworker gave me some valium and right away the Dr gave me a massive bottle of pills...I guess it wasn't addictive after all. Dr kept me on it for over two years the fool and I ended up taking myself off and went through delayed withdrawals and my Dr never even asked about the valium!!! Don't take this stuff_ never! You read good things about this but when you go off good luck_ these drugs should be banned and the inventors behind them sued till they end up taking them themselves. Thanks Dr Sloan for ruining my life. DO NOT TAKE BENZOS_YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY_ I wish I never touched any big pharma med...EVER! Peace,M,41,2  years,3/21/2016Email,Valium

8, 5, Anxiety Attacks - Panic Disorder,None,This is a wonder drug for anxiety sufferers_ if it works for you_ if it stops your panic_ then take them and get back to living your life!! I was agoraphobic and thought I was seriously losing my mind_ then Valium was prescribed 3 X a day and wow!! I got my life back! I stop taking them for periods of time_ I've never been addicted to them. I can go months without taking them_ then take them daily for a few weeks_ then off them cold turkey for a year! It's just as needed really....... I have just been switched to Ativan (Lorazepam) 1mg twice a day as I'm relocating interstate and my panic is back badly. So will see how I go on this new med,F,32,10  years2.5,3/8/2016,Valium
9, 1, GAD/Meiners/panic attacks,It helped with the vertigo but doesn't help the anxiety or panic attacks at all. I had a huge panic attack driving today and I've already taken 10mgs.,I was never told this drug would have to be tapered and I'm stuck having to take it. I have read all the forums and with my anxiety I'm scared to try to taper reading all the bad reactions ppl have with it.,F,46,3  years20mg,3/2/2016,Valium
10, 3, bruised ribs,Nausea,Allowed me to find a comfortable position as bruised ribs hurt worse than natural labor (no epidural or meds). After 5 days of no sleep I finally got a few hours of sleep thanks to the valuim however it all went down hill after becoming nauseated and throwing up. Ultimately I don't like being in excruciating pain from having bruised ribs and being violently sick as it only made my ribs and chest muscles hurt 10x more.,F,29,3  days2mg,2/29/2016,Valium
11, 1, Panic Disorder,Made my body feel very heavy_ and like my legs were rubbery. Had difficulty with walking and coordination. Also felt dizzy and somewhat high; eyes felt heavy and sleepy. Did not like.,Prescribed an alternative to lorazepam saying it wears off more quickly. I definitely prefer Ativan. It find that it works quickly and effectively to relieve panic by calming the mind and relaxing the body_ but not so much that it makes it difficult to function.,F,43,1  days5mg 1X AN,11/20/2015Email,Valium
12, 5, Back spasms,No negative side effectes to my knowledge.,I have been suffering severe back spasm pain every few days for the past week. The first day I was injected with Valium at the ER and it helped a great deal. The second time_ which was about five days later_ I tried EVERYTHING and it didn't relieve the spasm or the pain; heating pad_ 600 mg of Motrin_ icy hot_ lying down_ hot shower_ nothing. I finally went to my last resort of oral Valium. It took about half an hour to kick in but when it did_ I finally felt relief in my back and was finally able to sleep. I don't want to rely on this drug because of addiction that runs in my family_ so I will be seeing a primary care doctor to see why my back is doing this and take the actions necessary to deal with this problem. Bottom line: great drug for back spasms_ as long as you take it as a last resort to lessen the risk of dependence on it.,M,21,4  days5 mg,11/14/2015,Valium

15, 5, Pain_ Anger_ Tension_ GAD,NONE,Valium has changed my life. Im a Police Officer and fitness enthusiast_ with an extremely stressful life. Have suffered from anxiety since a teen. The repressed anger from dealing with scumbags daily and some pretty intense spinal injuries_ has left me in a state of pure tension and uneasyness. Valium totally erases all of my issues. I have increased my dose from 5mg to 15mg over two years. But occassionally i will go a week only taking 10mg a day. The key is abstaining from alcohol. Alcohol +Valium = BAD. Stay very hydrated and exercise. The name brand is much better than the generic. If you have insurance_ tell doc u want name brand only. If you are uninsured_ youll have to stick with generic because the name brand costs $575.00 for 60 pills without insurance. I will take valium indefinitely. The quality of life improvement outweighs the only negative factor of valium_ which would be coming off of it.,M,40,2  years10-20 MG,9/28/2015Email,Valium
16, 1, Back pain,People love this drug because they think they can stop taking it and not get any withdrawal symptoms. Diazepam has a half life of 100-200 hours and it builds up massively in your body if you take it every day_ or worse still_ multiple times a day. If youve been taking 10mg a day for a year then you will have 2000mg-3000mg of it in your body when you quit_ so you won't experience any withdrawal symptoms for around a month. This has been scientifically proven. So just because you quit for a week cold turkey and get no Withdrawals_ don't think you're past the most difficult phase.,This drug accumulates massively in your body_ causes dementia/ brain damage (been proven in recent studies) and will ruin your life once you come off it.,M,55,10  days10MG,9/28/2015,Valium

20, 5, Muscle spasms/sleep,Dry mouth_ lethary in the morning_ dizziness.,This drug in low doses helps with muscle spasms and the pain associated with this. This will in turn reduce anxiety caused by pain. It also helps the body heal because it is relaxed and resting at night. It is longer acting than other drugs in this same family given for muscle spasms or anxiety associated with pain_ such as lorazepam. The longer acting aspect of the drug allows for a longer rest period because if the peak and decline of the drug.

24, 1, Insomnia,None,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG OR ANY BENZO'S. I had no idea that I had to be weaned off of 5 mg of Valium. I went into acute w/d and I had terrible anxiety (never suffered any anxiety prior to taking it) high blood pressure_ fast pulse_ muscle cramps_ blurred vision_ tininitus_ walking felt odd_ terrible irregular periods_ sweats_  short term memory loss_ my hair was shedding and breaking for 5 weeks_ terrible insomnia_ I lost 7 pds in one week_ agoraphobic_ terrible fear_  auditory hallucinations. I am currently off the drug 20 weeks now and most of these terrible side effects have all abated. I am still dealing with short term memory cognitive issues_ and a little anxiety. I never had any anxiety prior to taking this drug. DO NOT TAKE VALIUM OR ANY BENZO. THEY DOWN REGULATE YOUR GABA A RECEPTORS AND THEY TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO UP REGULATE!!

Taking 5mg of Valium 30 mins prior made getting and IV and laying in the MRI machine a breeze. Second time was when I was to get a pin and wire removed from my fractured finger (in Dr's office w/no sedation or pain killer). I felt no anxiety whatsoever when the nurse called me back. The procedure went so smoothly b/c I wasn't anxious. I had no side effects at all_ just a nice calm feeling.,F,37,2  days5 1X D,4/27/2015Email,Valium

32, 1, anxiety due to Claritin-D,HORRIBLE--From the first dose_ it CAUSED muscle spasms...I thought I was having a seizure so I immediately took more!  Muscle spasms_ brain fog_ suicidal thoughts_ burning sensations of lava pouring through my body_ and a burning the size of a grapefruit on the right side of my head non-stop for a month; full body shakes_ chills_ spasms_ complete loss of appetite_ severe constipation_ and interrupted sleep (only let me sleep 2-3 hours at a stretch)_ leading to insomnia_ severe tinnitus,I wish I had never taken this_ and after only 8 weeks_ I don't know if it has permanently ruined me.  I tried to cold turkey Jan 27_ but by a week later I had to take 1 dose_ and by the second week I was going to jump out the window...I had been up non-stop for 4 days and nights_ and had only slept 2 hours a night the days before that...going from bed to bathtub with severe spasms_ complete inability to cope or interact...From the first dose_ I started running to neurologists thinking I had some rare disease that caused burning sensations in my body_ and I had 2 MRIs_  a CT_ EEGs_ BAERs_ EMGs....a $10_000 work up only to be told everything was normal...but how was that possible when I was in this much pain? Finally when the third ENT doc prescribed Klonipen for my tinnitus (which THANK GOD I NEVER TOOK) did I find the benzosupport.org website_ and I discovered all my problems were caused by the valium. I am not on week 3 of withdrawal_ after re-instating a 4 day taper last week after the failed cold turkey attempt (NEVER NEVER try cold turkey_ I do believe now it can kill you).  I almost lost my job over this ( I am an RN) and started making scary mistakes at work.  Luckily I only work 2 days a week so I could spend the rest of time in bed or the bath.

36, 1, Migraine_ neck pain,I began taking generic Valium for migraine relief & associated neck pain. During menopause_ I had severe migraines almost daily. Valium helped with the intense neck  pain & at first it worked very well. However_ I kept upping the dose when 10 mgs stopped working and then I became physically dependent.,I reached my max at 40 mgs per day. After 5 years_ I began to experience deep muscle and back pain. I never associated this with Valium until I read an article about long term use of Benzodiazepines causing RA-like pain. My back_ knees & leg muscles ached constantly. I could barely walk. I began to taper down to 5 mgs a day. My pain did not subside until I began tapering the last 10 mgs. I noticed a marked difference in pain level. The withdrawal was not bad. I barely remember it. Of course_ I barely remember anything anymore. My short term memory has been severely compromised. I don't know if it will ever return. It is a definite side-effect of Valium_ including the joint & muscle pain.,F,67,20  years10 4X D,1/11/2015Email,Valium

This in combination with Zoloft_ also taken at night has helped a great deal.  I can now sleep again with minimal night terrors and the cry valve has been adjusted appropriately.

The beauty is I don't need to take them every day. When my mother was dying of cancer_ Doctors put me on every type of anti-depressant_ each gave me a horrible side effect.They made me sick and did nothing to relieve anxiety_ actually they made me feel more anxious. Valium has been the only drug that not only helps me sleep_ but relieves the anxiety. Actually_it proves to me that ""nothing horrible will really happen""_ so I can deal with life's dilemma's without taking anything. It has been a type of ""behavior modification"". Doctors and laypeople have a tendency to give this drug a bad connotation_ even so far as to accuse us of being ""drug addicts"". I know this has been a ""lifesaver"" for the victims of horrible traumatic experiences. It has allowed us to function as ""normal individuals"" and not dwell on the unfortunate.",M,61,40  years5 0r 10 1X D,1/23/2014Email,Valium

Ativan and Xanax far more effective for short-term immediate-release anxiety treatment.  Yes_ Valium is the most sedating of these anxiolytics_ however_ I was up to 45 mg (15 mg 3X a day) of Valium_ quite a high dose_ and it just never did the trick for me.  I took more and more and my anxiety wouldn't be quelled.  Depending on your own situation_ I would recommend Klonopin or especially a combination which I am now on of Xanax and Xanax XR for effective anxiety treatment_ which_ while less sedating than Valium_ is a great mixture of long-release and immediate-release relief.,M,29,3  years15 mg 3X D,12/22/2013,Valium

I have tried to come off of it but feel so bad until I had to restart. I hope it works. It is weak compared to some of the other benzos. I wish I did not have to take these drugs. Overtime_ they start to work less for some ppl due to tolerance altho a few people don't seem to experience tolerance and the drug seems to work for a lifetime in these people. Please e-mail me and share your Valium experience. How long before this drug accumulates enough in the bloodstream before you start to experience relief.

He kept me on it at doses ranging from 15-40mgs per day and never mentioned the nightmarish withdrawal syndrome.,DON'T TAKE IT! It is so easy to become addicted as it becomes part of your brain and very being. It clamps down on your emotions and turns on you after  a while so you just have to take it to avoid w/d syndrome. After 12 years I tried coming off it and after 9 months had got down to 1mg_ then 0.5mg_ then all living hell broke loose in my body. Imagine a heroin user and think worse! Shaking_ chills_ cramps_ no sleep_ showers hurt my body_ vertigo_ nausea_ fatigue_ anxiety_ terrified of the world_ sexual blunting. Imagine hell and call it diazepam withdrawal. I HAD to go back on it as I was raising my daughter alone and my mother had cancer.

84, 5, GAD_ PD_ Depression,The withdrawal from Valium is a walk-in-the-park compared to Effexor or Cymbalta!!! This medication is harmless. I feel no addiction at all_ and my brain feels like its come out a seizure state (anxiety_ panic disorder). I just feel normal! Avoid the 5 mg tabs as they contain tertrazine (yellow dye # 5) which 50 % of the population is allergic to. I get the 10 mg blue tabs and snap 'em in half. This drug is highly under-used. It makes you feel normal so you can get on with life without anxiety or panic. Added bonus is the muscle relaxant qualities that other benzos do not have. So say goodbye to the physical pain associated with GAD & PD. SSRI's and SNRI's need to be re-examined. Not everyone with anxiety and or PD can be lumped into one bin - Serotonin. Some of us lack the neurotransmitter GABA_ which is what Valium targets. ,,M,40,6  years10,7/3/2012,Valium

After a period of time I learned to squint my eyes ignore the pain and work through the day with nearly no human interaction. Through-out the next six years I suffered insomnia due to the migraines leading me to extreme measures including downing several bottles of the sleep aid diphenhydramine (nearly 200 times the normal dose). All the testing four doctors can do and all the treatment they tried in seven years including a brief stint on morphine did nothing to show a cause or treatment. THC(meridol) has provided pain relief and allowed me to sleep and think for just over a year; however the headaches persisted. I began self medicating on Valium with incredibly high doses (160+mg sublingually ~equivalent to 250+mg orally) following a very traumatic car crash. I felt disconnected from the world_ but noticed that even on lower doses I was not experiencing migraines. After speaking with my doctor I stopped taking valium(as doses in the range I was using should have left my 125lbs self unable to move) and was put on zanax which left me feeling the equivalent of restless-leg syndrome over my entire body. I then tried clonazepam and found myself taking high doses to relieve the headaches causing me to forget large chunks of time (nearly the entire month I was on them).

116, 5, anxiety/sleep disorder,Valium is the BEST drug for anxiety and sleepness_I take it_ sleep for 7 to 8 hours and have absolutely no side effects_ if I feel anxious_ I take 5mg and it goes away.,Doctors do not like to prescribe it because it is addictive_ but so are cigarettes and I am sure millions of people die from lung cancer than from Valium. It works wonders,M,44,4  years10 1X D,4/10/2011,Valium

118, 3, sleep_ anxiety,Weight gain_ slow thinking_ irritablity_ lazy_ compulisive eating_ erratic behavior. If you need something for sleep_ anxiety depression definetly go with a non addictive class of medication. This stuff was just awful to get off of. I did it in one try though but took at least three months to feel normal. I never craved it and took 10 mg at first then 20 mg but looking in hindsight it was not benificial for long term usage or if you smoke pot. Made me look like I had bloat and often got nausia and made me erratic and irritable.,This is a great medication for a very short time or if you take once in a blue moon. I thought I was doing the right thing by taking one at night and never took during the day. I never felt that high the movie stars got from it nor it make my quality of life better. It made me feel sluggish during the day and tired most of the time. I never craved it like when I smoked cigarettes 15 years ago but there was a comfort every night knowing I could take something to relax my mind and sleep. Problem is it relaxed my mind all day often wanting a nap in the afternoon and then not going to bed til after midnight when i would take at 9 or 10. I finally had to come to the realisation that it did not help at all for sleep or mood. I really regret taking this medication. Also the withdrawal was bad. Not in regards to craving cause I never did but the physical withdrawals_ convulsions_ mania_ insomnia etc was terrifying. Its been over a year since I quit on first try but after many years of procrastination and four months later felt alot better and a month ago went on a small dose of Elavil at night and that has done wonders. Never again on valium though a big misjudgment.,M,41,6  years20 1X D,3/3/2011Email,Valium
119, 5, Occasional insomnia,I did not experience any_ unless you count a very slight taste in the mouth_ the morning after.,As you see_ I have used Valium almost an entire lifetime.  However_ I determined from the beginning that I would not become addicted or dependent and resolved not to take it two nights in a row.  If I were sleepless the night following a previous night of taking the drug_ I would have to remain sleepless.,F,80,45  years2.5-5.0 mg 4X M,2/8/2011,Valium
120, 3, sleep/anxiety,groggy and foggy till noon the next day.,"if you take this drug for more than a year everyday or even three times a week you will become addicted physically and mentally and getting off it is very hard to do.  The withdrawal symptoms are just horrible and you will struggle to beat it.  The withdrawal symptoms are anxiousness_ confusion_ chest pains_ no sleep for a day or two_ depression and a general sick feel9ing....lasts for a week or so.  The tricky part of getting off all benzos is that it takes longer than you think becauase they stay in your system for a week or longer qand then as the benzo leaves your body entirely that is when you reall y feel the withdrawal.  If you cold turkey stop...not a good idea....you will be ok for a day or two but in a week your body will be screaming out:  ""wheres the ^&%$*#^ valium????",M,55,5  days10 1X D,1/7/2011,Valium
121, 3, anxiety_ muscle spasms_ insomnia,a little grogginess_ blurred vision_ heavy eyes_ feel like a sticky film on my skin (anyone else have this?)_some flu like symptoms in my mucles but seems to be improving..,was prescribed 5mg after taking xanax and/or ativan for many years to see if this would also help my muscle spasms..I am only taking 1-2mg of it per day so far and it seems to be helping but many more side effects than the other benzo's. never had any side effects from the 2 mentioned. have a high tolerance for most any meds_ always have...so i am still trying to comprehend how this little valium is making me feel like this..weird...not sure if i want to continue if this keeps up..will decided in the next week or so i guess..the worst is the blurred vision_ heavy eye feeling (not really sleepy_ but almost like my eyeballs are swollen) and sticky feeling on my skin. anyone have these symptoms?? i had taken some valium years ago in college and had none of these affects...wondering if i just have to adjust to it or what...? will update later on...,M,38,5  days5mg 1X D,11/15/2010Email,Valium
122, 4, Benzo withdrawal,I am using it to come off Klonopin.,The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it's easier to come off of than Klonopin_ whatever you do.. just don't touch klonopin!,M,31,1  years45mg 1X D,11/10/2010,Valium
123, 4, anxiety and just because,A wonderful calmness at first when taking the drug.,i started to take valium to try to have something in common with my high school friends at the time. the pills were never mine i stole them from my mother who uses them for their intention. i however began abusing them and quit cold turkey once. it was a horrible time for the short amount of time i used it. i was off of it for a couple of months then used again and now i quitting cold turkey again. this past time i have been using it a little more often than the last time and now i do not know when the cold sweats will happen again. all i do know is that i am very anxious and wanting to take the anxiety away but i know that will be the wrong thing to do. another thing is that valium can make you pack on the weight,F,18,8  months5mg-15mg 1X D,11/4/2010Email,Valium
124, 4, Vertigo,"Very ""chill"" and mild headaches",After battling unrelenting dizziness_ my doctor prescribed valium.  I can honestly say_ much to my surprise_ the pills REALLY worked.  I took once before bed every night - helped tremendously.  The only bad thing is it didn't CURE my dizziness.  I still have vertigo on a daily basis_ but because I recognized the potential of addiction to this substance_ I no longer take the drug.,F,30,30  days10MG 1X D,11/1/2010,Valium
125, 4, closed MRI,asleep_ double vision_ lack of coordination,First MRI was closed_ then 2 open when I found out I was claustrophobic_ then surgeon requested another closed MRI because of better quality images.  Took 1 Valium 2mg one hour before procedure.  Husband drove me 45 minutes and I slept all the way.  Woke with double vision and staggering uncoordination.  He had to hold me up to get me to the MRI. I don't do well with CNS depressants.  Just like Soma a few years back. I was extremely relaxed during the MRI_ though I will put this on my list of drug sensitivities.,F,60,1  times2mg 1X D,10/31/2010,Valium
126, 1, Anxiety & Panic Attacks,While I I was taking the pills it worked wonders.  I have been off Valium for approximately 4 days and it has been the worst 4 days of my life.  I stopped cold turkey versus tapering off of the medication.  The withdrawl effects have been horrible.  My anxiety and panic attacks have kicked in worse than when I started taking the meds.   I have had almost all the withdrawl side effects described_ heart palapitations_ sweating_ major anxiety_ rage_ tremors_ severe depression_ nausea/dizziness.  The list just goes on and on.    I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TAKING THIS MEDICATION.  IT IS HIGHLY ADDICTING AND THE WITHDRAWL SYMPTOMS ARE JUST SIMPLY NOT WORTH IT!!!,,F,46,1  years5MG 1X D,10/20/2010,Valium

For her_ the over the counter medications like Unisom Sleepgels have worked very well. But my insomnia was worse. I was prescribed seconals and Ambien_ which worked very well for sleep. But in the daytime_ I would become anxious. The valium really helped calm me down_ and I hever had any side effects. I have not taken any in a couple of years.

Finally saw a neurologist_ and he connected the migraine vertigo relationship_ tried other migraine medicines but side effects were too severe. Needed something as I lost my job because of being sick 3 to 4 days every wk. Now take 5mg of valium as needed some days none some days 1 or 2 tablets but has transformed my life. Wasn't able to travel by auto or any other method because of the severe motion sickness that would come with the migraine and vertigo. Have suffered no side effects or addiction issues.

135, 4, ,lazy_ more of a body buzz because of the muscle relaxer effects.,I switched from 3mg of Xanax a day to 30mg of Valium a day. My xanax tolerance was too high. Also I didn't like the withdrawls that came with missing one day of xanax. Xanax half life is 6-12 hours. Valium is 100-250 hours_ so it's damn near impossible to have withdrawls as long as your taking at least one a day_ because like I told my doc_ somedays I take 5 and somedays I take 1.,M,30,1  months10MG 3X D,8/24/2010,Valium
136, 3, Severe Anxiety,addiction_ lethargy_ depression_ withdrawal_ hyperactivity due to long term use.,I was prescribed this for 3 weeks to get through a severe anxiety episode_ and got addicted. I had multiple doctors giving it to me for years_ and combined it with antidepressants and alcohol. After about 3 years_ I took it one night and it had the opposite effect - it was like taking speed. I confessed my substance abuse to the doctor and they said I'd filled my body with so many legal drugs they had stopped working. I had to quit cold turkey_ and had night sweats_ cramps and nightmares_ but my alcohol habit kept the worst at bay. I soon after decreased and went of the antidepressants (Cipramil) and had bad withdrawals. I relapsed into Valium a few years later_ but 7 years later I'm now totally clean and have quit alcohol as well. I'm amazed at how often doctors offer me Valium_ and more amazed that I have the strength to turn it down. VALIUM IS EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE!,F,30,3  years5 3X D,8/9/2010,Valium
137, 1, anxiety and then pain,I started taking Valium for anxiety! 5mg 3x a day! And at first I felt great! There was defiantly a high that came with taking them. I had taken valium and xanax for short periods of time in the past with out really remembering if I had problem with withdraw? I have tried a few times to taper off of these things and these things have ruined my life! I no longer get a feeling of well being (maybe slight).If you think you are going to take these and escape the damaging effect_ you will be one and a million!,Please heed my WARNING and stay as far away from these as possible! I have studied many cases of Benzo addiction (for 6 years) and almost all would agree_ it may seem like a great thing the first few days or months; but let me assure you these pills have been described as more additive then heroin by many! The drug makes a home in your brain_ and doesnt want to leave! I regret ever taking them for more then a week! I would like to have anyone who is suffering getting off of these to partner with; to taper off of or just support!,M,54,10  years5 2X D,7/29/2010Email,Valium
138, 2, Insomnia_ anxiety/PTSD,Agitated_ hot flashes_ increased anxiety_ dry mouth_ itching,Took 2.5 mg (or half a tablet) after a week of insomnia following a traumatic experience.  Did not help me sleep at all.  Seemed to make me more agitated.  Tried it again 4 days later (after trying Benadryl & then Ambien during the intervening 3 days.)  Took 2.5 mg in the 8 p.m. hour_ but it took until ~ 10:30 p.m. to make me drowsy.  (Only got drowsy after using the sleep technique of going to another room for 20 minutes.) Slept for 3 hours_ then was wide awake & agitated with dry mouth & hot flashes.  Had to put a cold washcloth on my upper back. Took another 2.5 mg at 2:30 a.m.  Made me drowsy quickly.  Slept another 3 hours_ then awoke very warm & agitated. Could not go back to sleep.  I do not believe that any of the sleep I got was REM sleep.

I did  my own taper with no help from useless md. I knew more about valium then he did by time I was off of it. Took me 6 weeks to wean off of and that was to quick.

141, 2, Withdrawal from Benzodiazepines,I used Valium for withdrawing from benzodiazepines. I converted over from Klonopin (and prior Triazolam).,Benzodiazepines are dangerous medications. They are important in life saving situations_ but they should not be taken for long periods of time. Nowadays there are as_ if not more_ effective and safer ways to address anxiety issues (holistic medicine_ counseling_ etc.). I initially took benzodiazepines for a short time for sleep (Triazolam) and my body quickly became hooked. When i tried to stop I experienced withdrawal symptoms. At first I was told I had an anxiety disorder and I needed more benzo's. So I was prescribed Klonopin. Experienced same withdrawal symptoms 2 months later - but by this time I was wise to the situation and used the Ashton Manual to withdrawal (GOD BLESS! - www.benzo.org.uk). I used valium for my taper over 9 months. It was markedly easier to withdraw from. I've been Benzo free for 7 years and feel MUCH better. The Benzo's did permanent damage to my body (I am now very sensitive to just about any nervous system impacting medication_ get phantom withdrawal pains every time i have bad anxiety) and I was on them for a short period of time. I can't imagine what those who took higher doses over longer periods have had to deal with. Valium gets a 2 because it's the best route for withdrawal and the tablets come in much smaller doses_ etc. But I would steer clear of benzo's unless they are absolutely necessar. If you have anxiety issues_ consider the following book (was great for my healing!): 'The Instinct to Heal'_ by David Servan-Schreiber.,M,23,9  months10 --> 0.5 1X D,6/7/2010,Valium
142, 5, insomnia_ benzos withdrawal,short memory loss.,it is fantastic to relax yourself and to have a great sleep. it's also very functional to stop take short halflife benzos and stop to take benzos at all. i recommend it_ althougt it is a bdz.,M,24,1  days5 mg 1X D,5/27/2010,Valium
143, 5, severe  anxiety and panic attacks,none,It helped my anxiety and vertigo within 10 minutes of taking my first dose. No more vertigo.  I  could never take any anti depressant drugs without every side effect possible.I tried almost ever single one. I tried all the natual remidies and nothing worked. Valium worked every time. Why is alcohol legal and not a prescription when there are so many people driving drunk and hurting their families and themselves. You don't hear about someone taking valium and killing anyone or hurting their families. Why doesn't the FDA make the makers of valium take out the so called addictive part of the medicine and let us take it without making us feel like drug addicts. I have never abused my valium.  SSR's are so dangerous and are worse for you in the long run.,F,50,1  years5 1X D,5/25/2010Email,Valium
144, 1, anxiety and depression,I got addicted to it_ needed more and more for it to work and the more I took the more anxious i got.,The first time I took this was heaven. I was seriously depressed and I felt brilliant.  I spent years trying to recapture the feeling of that first tablet and I never did. In the end it didn't work for me at all.  I'm now coming off slowly and hope to be free of it by the end of the year. It's great it seems to help so many people but please be aware of the potential for addiction,F,40,11  yearsvarious 1X D,5/14/2010,Valium
145, 5, Insomnia_ anxiety,Forgot where I would put stuff..short term memory was a bit off...it also made me a bit dizzy in the morning but that stopped as I got used to the drug.  My doctor thought it may be habit forming and only gives me 30-5mg every 2mos.  It works good and I only take it about 10 times a month unless I am really hurting and cannot sleep.,"My father used to take this drug when they gave it out in the late 60's-70's.  We used to call it the ""forget things"" drug as he would not remember where he put things and they would be in his back pocket !

147, 1, After Rhinoplasty,I didn't really feel the drug at first_ but I felt great and slept better than I had in a long time_ so I kept taking it and even asked for a second prescription from my doc.  BIG mistake.  The scary thing about this drug is that you don't realize what it's doing to you.  It feels like nothing in particular_ but you feel good and relaxed and you sleep.  I should've researched what the heck I was doing while taking this drug!,Withdrawal from such short term use was HORRIBLE for the first week although going from 30 mg on my last day to zero was probably a bad idea.  Also_ I would NOT recommend drinking while coming off of this drug_ which I hadn't realized would be a problem.   I was extremely depressed and almost suicidal and could barely sleep.  My skin also broke out really badly and I used to have perfect skin.  The symptoms are getting better now since I've cut out caffeine and alcohol for a couple of days now and it's been approx 8 days since I've stopped taking it.,F,37,20  days10mg 2X D,4/11/2010,Valium
148, 1, Insomnia,At first_ I thought it was some sort of wonder drug_ but last time I took it_ I had a paradoxical reaction and it was horrible.

149, 5, cervical spasm,None except that it completely knocked me out... I had to take my dose at least 4 hours before going to bed to avoid oversleeping the next morning (this was at 5mg). First dose made me sleep through my alarm and I was late for work because I took it too late at night. I was also groggy for several hours the next morning (but I'm sensitive to most meds). Was only on this drug for one week_ and didn't really experience any other side effects besides that.,I had a recurring cervical (neck) muscle spasm for over 3 years before I was finally prescribed diazepam. The muscle spasm was EXTREMELY painful_ preventing me from swallowing or even moving my head/neck during an attack. Took diazepam for one week about 4 years ago and I have NEVER had any problems since. Worked great!,F,38,7  days5 mg 1X D,4/4/2010,Valium

I decided to stop using it. my doctor advised me to start using valium which has been doing great and better than alprazolam. it is safe medication_ no addiction to it at all. it is the best medication for anxiety so far.I am on 5 mg only a day_ you can split it to four pieces and use one piece every 6 hours. contact me if you need more advise.,M,50,1  months5MG 1X D,4/3/2010,Valium
151, 2, Anxiety,Not really any side effects because the drug itself is so weakTaken in larger doses_ i did find it helped me sleep but that was it,Compared to Clonazepam and Atitvan_ the Diazepam is very weak_ its 120MG to 0.5MG of Clonazepam (klonopin) and 0.125 of triazolam so you need about 100MG to feel normal_ maybe for some people it works and i give it a 2/5 because it was non addictive for me and safe to take,F,24,5  weeks5MG 3X D,3/14/2010Email,Valium

I am addicted to it_ psychologically if not physically. That said_ it works well to reduce anxiety and provide comfort. Has also helped with symptoms of degenerative disc disease. I am not a medicine fan and it is the best medication I have ever had and probably has obviated the need for me to take other meds many times. My dosages have varied over the years. I take as I feel the need_ but generally dosage has ranged from 2.5mg/day to 15mg/day with avg being 5mg/day.

I got prescribed it whilst in Spain as having 'crisis' and psychiatrist in UK now wants me to reduce this with a time limit of 4 weeks_ as he says their team don't prescribe valium as it is addictive and eventually makes people worse. He cant offer me any therapy though says therapy is the way forward and I'm on citalopram which has helped a bit but doesn't take the crippling panic away that I still experience from time to time.

160, 3, Anxiety and back pain,No side effects_ only very slight sedation.,I know Valium is the gold standard of anti-anxiety and muscle relaxers. I was actually pretty suprised that it didn't seem to work as well as hoped. It did nothing for my panic attacks and only slightly eased my back spasms. I was switched to Xanax for my anxiety issues and it works much faster and packs more of a punch. I know it's habit forming so I only take as needed. I wish I had better success with the Valium because it lasts 12 hours rather than only 6 with Xanax.,F,32,90  days,12/11/2009,Valium
161, 5, benzodiazepine withdrawal,Sedation,So far so good. My Doctor is using Dr. Heather Ashton methodfor my benzodiazepine withdrawal. I took a high dosageof Klonopin for years and did a switch over and almostoff the diazepam. It is Ok to take a benzodiazepine but shortterm use is better. ,M,32,4  months,12/9/2009,Valium

163, 4, Anxiety from prostate cancer diagno,Nothing new..  Same old Valium.  It's a wicked good drug. Too good_ actually...  Occasionally spacy but generally good.  I suspect it also reactivated my depression to an extent.,This is my 2nd go around with Mr. V. I was on it from 1982-99 for Meniere's Disease and GAD. But I'm a recovering drunk with 10 1/2 years sober and I can't have this stuff. But when I got my cancer diagnosis_ my Meniere's came back some and I had chest-crushing anxiety. So_ I went on 4 mg/day from April until now.  I tried to taper off on my own and am having trouble.  So_ I went to the psych and she is tapering me and giving me Remeron for depression. Anyhow_ the cancer is gone now (so's my prostate_ BTW) and it's time to get off this crap and go to more AA meetings.  God bless you if you can use this stuff without getting habituated. I can't.  For me_ it's like my brain is one side of the velcro and valium is the other. Perfect fit and hence_ dangerous.  It's a wonderful drug though and served it's purpose at it's time.,M,57,6.5  months,11/17/2009,Valium
164, 5, Anxiety,Slight sedation... I personally reserve this for ocassional use as needed as the only down side to this medication is possible addiction and withdrawl.,Fantastic! It provides just unimaginable release to hellish anxiety symptoms (ssri's side effects were unbearable)relaxes your mind_ muscles and makes you feel normal... it's long acting so wears off very gradually preventing symptoms coming back when it wears off. I buy this off an internet site as doctors don't like to prescibe it because a few people abuse it and so treat everyone else like children- I am very responsible with this drug in order tokeep it at its most effective.,F,24,1  days,11/12/2009Email,Valium

My current specialist won't prescribe it (except maybe in VERY limited quantities). I should show him some recent photos I took of my face and body after a severe vertigo attack. I have a black eye_ and the side of my face is black and blue in addition to other parts of my body. Had I had this available_ I could have gotten out of this attack quicker and suffered less damage to my body. Those with Meniere's know what I'm talking about.

Valium is an invaluable tool in combating anxiety/panic attacks during dental procedures. I am normally hesitant to use prescription medication due to possible adverse side effects_ but Valium is exceptional: it my made my endodontic treatment infinitely more tolerable. My dentist could have drilled all afternoon. Expect slight drowsiness or a bit of light-headedness; when the Valium wears off it may leave you feeling slightly ""hungover."" All in all_ a wonderful experience.",M,30,1  days,9/23/2009,Valium

I've taken Xanax for anxiety and couldn't believe that the doctor gave me Valium for pain (since they're both Benzodiazipeins).  This completely stops a migraine_ even if I don't take it right away like you're supposed to with headaches_ however it does knock me out for a few hours_ but with pain like that- I didn't mind,F,25,10  times,9/18/2009,Valium

I was suffering from panic attacks and bursting into tears at the drop of a hat. This drug works.,One thing_ I am not sure if this is normal but my sex drive has markedly increased. I find myself checking men out and leering a bit at times. Has anyone else experienced this? My doc initially prescribed Xanax_ which was a bit strong_ but I noticed that in the morning after the first time I took the Xanax I was so aroused_ like a teenaged boy.

175, 5, lower back pain/spasms,only beneficial effects,I use 10 to 15 mg valium per day in conjunction with pain pills when my back pain flairs up. It really enhances the effectiveness of the pain medication and reduces spasms. I stop taking it when my back gets better and have never had any withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately_ the doc wants to take me off because of recent adverse publicity about prescription med abuse - but this is just because he is too spineless and wants to go along and get along. He is afraid of adverse scrutiny and meanwhile I will be denied a med that really helps.,M,60,2  years,7/29/2009,Valium
176, 5, OCD and mild depression,n/a,Valium has really helped me out. When I took it with Risperedon_ I was able to fall asleep really easily and it was amazing. I felt incredibly relaxed.

177, 5, acute anxiety_ panic attacks,none_ maybe sleepiness,"Three years ago_ my now retired doctor prescibed valium to me for my anxiety_ 5mg daily_ and when I felt it necessary_ 10mg but no more. It worked like a miracle!!! After only a few days on valium_ I was no longer afraid to go outside my apartment_ talk to people_ no more day long panic attacks_ It really saved me. When my doctor retired_ he suggested another doctor to see in his place_ but then he had a heart attack_ he retired_ and I have not been able to find a regular doctor since_ so I must go to the local clinics. Since then_ those doctors have decided that my problem is depression and put me on anti-depressants_ which did me worse than I already was. I have told these doctors that valium works best for me_ but they will not give me any_ saying it is too addictive. I didn't find them to be addictive. After a few months on valium_ I actully stopped taking them on my own_ then since the panic was starting again_ I went back to them_ but not every day. This drug has helped me to understand my problem_ so I am coping better now_ but still have ""those days"" when it comes back with a vengence. I have seen that some drug websites will send valium through the mail. Is there anyone out there who gets valium from a website? I would appreciate any advise on one that is reputable_ as I hate giving out too much personal info to a website.Please email me if you can help me with any information.

As I am breastfeeding I need to keep my dose as minimal as possible_ and I do - in the past week I've only taken 4mg in total (2mg each on two days). Valium is the only thing that has suppressed my ""buzzing"" nerves enough to allow me to easily fall asleep and stay asleep_ and cope with my night-waking baby and two older children as well. I have significant nerve damage in my thoracic spine from a botched spinal anaesthetic_ which is both painful and distressing_ and a frequently feeding baby_ plus a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old to care for_ and my husband travels every second week for work. Without the mild relaxing effect of the valium once or twice a week_ I simply do not get enough relief from the nerve disorder and enough sleep to function. I find the valium great because at this low dose_ it does not make me groggy or unresponsive_ just relaxed and it suppresses the nerve buzzing enough for me to feel some comfort in my body. Oh and my 4-month-old has shown zero signs of being affected and I HAVE been watching! But at such a low infrequent dose_ that's as expected.",F,36,3  weeks,6/8/2009,Valium

Chronic anxiety with panic attacks followed and soon I was so overwhelmed with constant worry that I couldn't function normally. Was prescribed Celexa with no results. After prescribed Valium (5mg_ as needed)_ for the first time in almost 4 years_ I wasnt insanely afraid of everything and could go out without panic. When I feel PA about to hit (usually starts with racing thoughts and rapid heart beat) I immediately take half 5mg pill. This stops heighten anxiety from developing into full blown PA.

After I borded the plane and took my seat_ I remember the flight attendents going through their flight safety thing_ I closed my eyes_ and the next thing I knew the captain was announcing that we were landing shortly.  Best flight ever!  My doctor told me to take one an hour before takeoff_ then another right at takeoff...but I didn't even need the second one.

187, 4, Sleep Problems,Few side effects other than what it's supposed to do.  It is sedating and helps a lot with anxiety.  Too much for too long can cause depression.,I take Valium to counter the side effects from Wellbutrin.  For me_ it's terrific.  I need only about 3 - 5 mg before bed_ it takes effect after about 20 minutes (an added bonus is that when it takes effect it feels very nice but that's not why I take it...) and then I just sleep!  My problem is staying asleep and Valium definitely works.  The BEST PART for me is that when I wake up I feel clean.  I don't feel groggy or stupid.  My doctor says it has lifespan of 24 hours but I don't experience that at all.  When I get up in the morning I'm basically ready to go.

I am careful not to increase my dose as I know that way lies madness. It's not easy_ though_ and I wish I'd never started it.

I took 5 mgs daily for approx. 2 years until the drug pooped out on me. This is the third benzo to quit on me leaving my fragile CNS in a train wreck. Benzos are great meds for very short term use. If the human brain didn't develop a tolerance for them_ they would be the ideal drug for panic and GAD. Problem is you build up a tolerance and eventually the drug quits working as has been my case. If you take benzos long-term in high doses and they poop out on you_ may god have mercy on your soul. The physical and mental pain is indescribable. Much_ much worse than heroin to come off (detox) after long-term use. Avoid if you can and take only for very brief periods if you must.,M,47,2  years,3/10/2009Email,Valium

Effect decreases over time_ so you need a higher dose.  Habit forming.  Wears off quickly.,This and Celexa/Citalopram_ for depression_ have totally changed my life!!!  If I have a job interview_ I take 10 mg of Valium.  If I have to go into crowds or Las Vegas Strip_ where I live_ I take the Valium.  Stuck in traffic_ take the Valium.I do NOT take it daily.  It is habit-forming and addictive.  Also_ the effects lessen_ I was on 5 mg for about a year_ now I am on 10 mg.  My husband loves it as well.  It really numbs you to many annoying things in life_ sometimes I can get work done without a care in the world.I hate crowds_ I have to deal with them_ I take the Valium and I am fine.  I will say pretty immediately after taking a dose_ you feel the effects_ but after a short time_ they disappear.  In theory they last 12 hours_ but that is definitely 100% not true_ maybe 2 hours at the most for me.But they have made it easy for me to deal with the general public_ to sit in traffic_ to go to job interviews_ to deal with my husband and 10 pets_ everything.

194, 4, social and anxiety,No side effects other than slight tireness,Valium has helped me slightly in performing social tasks (speeches/presentations)while I'm in college.  I take 5 mg whenever I think I will be in a situation that usually makes me nervous and shakey.  I still get nervous while speaking in class but the after effects (thinking I performed horribly) have decreased as well as the trembling voice and shakes.  Overall I would say this drug can be useful if you avoid situations due to anxiety.  If any thing it gives you a placebo like boost in confidence.  I only take it when I need it and I think that is important as far as becoming dependent on it.  I think it has given me confidence even when I don't take it.,M,23,3  weeks,1/15/2009,Valium

I noticed after having a wisdom tooth out my pain was better_ why? becuase they use Nitrapam which is guess what? a benzo_ no wonder I went and got the rest out. Valium - great for tmj short term.

It was a last resort after all other meds for vertigo did not work or had side effects that interfered with my daily functioning too much.  It has worked wonders for me.  I take 5mg twice daily.  Surprisingly_ it does not make me sleepy at all.  It completely takes the vertigo away.  The specialist I see (a neuro-otolaryngologist) said my body will not get used to the drug and increases in dose are not needed when used for vertigo.  Hopefully it is the answer to my prayers and will continue to work for me long term.  My doctor said he has many patients that take it daily and have done so for many years.  I would highly recommend it if you are suffering from vertigo.,F,31,7  months,12/18/2008,Valium

I had been seeing a psychiatrist for about five years (never taking any medication) because of depression and anxiety from divorce among other things.  In that sort of emergency situation_ he prescribed me 5mg of valium in order to help me sleep and I had a very favorable response to it.  I was able to relax even in tremendous pain from the surgery and I switched to a single vicodin.

Took intermittently 5 or 10mg and had great sleep and plenty of energy during the day.  Returned and went off cold turkey.  Big mistake.  Within 2 weeks_ increasing irritability_ insomnia and anxiety.  Did not know I was in withdrawal.  Thought it was jet lag but did not go away.  Contacted internist and his nurse prescribed sonata which did not work.  Finally ended up in the ER a week later with severe vertigo.  Be very careful about tapering off slowly from valium.  I should have been warned to gradually reduce amount taken_ then every other day for a week... could have avoided many problems and expense.,The good news is that I'm back on low dose 5mg valium before bed and sleep great.No apparent tolerance or dependence so far.

New internist tried to get me to take lexapro but have read too many negatives about it.If it ain't broke_ why fix it.  The valium has also increased sex drive but not in excess.  Too many internists out there red flag valium because they think you are an addict who wants it to enhance other drugs or they want to hook you on more expensive antidepressants. Go to a psychiatrist for such matters.  Also_ I talked to a psychiatrist and confirmed that low dose valium daily is no danger.

Unlike Xanax or Kolonopin_ I have had no sleepy or groggy feelings from the Valium.  On the contrary I can go out in public without having panic attacks_ I no longer spend a day and a half crying over a sad movie.  Not that I don't still cry a little at the sad parts_ but only until the scene changes like a normal person.  I consider this drug a God send and because of it feel as though I not only have a new lease on life_ but my life back.  I know it may not work for everyone_ but if you've tried the SSRI's for depression or Xanax or Kolonopin for anxiety and found it did not work or even if you've not tried anything at all yet_ give Valium a chance.  It's been around forever (my grandmother who was born in 1920 took it for the latter 30 years of her life with wonderful results) and if you're like me the newer pills are sort of like the,F,28,3  weeks,8/21/2008,Valium
210, 5, sleep,A little foggy in the morning but it clears up in two hours after I wake up.  No real problem_ no irritablity_ great sleep,Valium is a safe and proven tranquilizer.  I have tried all the sleeping meds: Ambien_ Restoril_ Lunesta_ Sonata_ Halcion_ and even Klonopin.  They are all garbage.  They have awful side affects and I consider them to be a waste of money. Valium (Diazepam) works very very well for me in that I get a full night of deep REM sleep.  I wake up a little groggy but in an hour or two I am clear headed and in a good stable mood. Some Docs don't like to prescribe Valium because there are so many newer(but less effective)drugs available now to treat sleep disorders..... so find one that does! Valium is the best and most effective drug I have taken for getting a good nights sleep which is critical to my success as a Sales Rep.   I take a 10 mg at bedtime and get a full night of deep sleep.....NOT LIGHT SLEEP....which is what is was getting before the Valium_ which is useless.  Valium is a wonder drug. Docs should not be so afraid of allowing patients have this drug for anxiety and sleep problems.,M,54,1  days,8/11/2008,Valium
211, 3, GAD,Sedation_ depression_ constant low mood.,Diazepam seems pretty good at relaxing muscles and nudging you off to sleep after a hectic day_ but apart from that it seems like a pretty week drug even at 30mg/day.  I have found Clonazepam(Rivotril) to be much more effective and also helps co-morbid depression rather than making it worse.  Valium is probably ok for short term use but I would never say that it's a recipe for long term respite from panic-anxiety.,M,30,1.5  years,8/9/2008,Valium
212, 5, Irrational Anxiety_ Panic & Nerves,Euphoria (Good thing!)_ Ocassional hangover effect in the mornings.,Absolute god-send drug_ have been struggling on and off with severe panic and anxiety for over a decade. I have a high profile job with regular board level meetings. At times I found myself avoidant of the things that have made me successful (meetings etc) as they took me outside of my comfort zone and thus irrationally fearful_ nervous and then subsequently panicking about the possibility of a panic attack ! (Bizarre the way the brain works!). People suggest that this drug leaves you blurred and dis-orientated whereas I feel totally focused when on valium and at times perform at my very best (simply because the limiting_ paranoid and bull-shit negative beliefs are eradicated in my head)_ I feel calm_ focused and in control. Is a real shame that doctors treat us all like children when it comes to prescribing this drug (re addiction etc).. Alcohol is addictive_ but hey_ the majority of people can use alcohol effectively and furthermore sensibly without ever encountering problems. Valium,M,28,3  years,7/30/2008,Valium
213, 5, anxiety- pelvic and back pain,very little for the 3 months taken last year. I should have continued_ but there was very slight depression (only after 3 months) because I only took 1mg. at bed and nothing during the day. I should have considered taking up to 2mg. a day. This is what I will do now_ but at the present I only need around 1 mg. again like last year.,I took valium -only 1 mg. a day- last year for 3 months. Then I went to Klonopin for 6 months (including withdrawal. I'm back with Valium. It's the best for me. Easy for my system to take and I don't need large doses. Klonopin was way too strong andthey don't make in small enough doses. .5 mg klonpin tablet is ten times stronger than 1mg. of Valium.,M,59,3  months,7/29/2008,Valium

Withdrawal of Xanax was a pain_ and I switch from 3mg xanax (1mg_ 3 times a daily) to just one pill of 10 mg of Valium daily. No withdrawal on me. So for me is better to stay just in one pill than taking 3 a day. Im planning to cut valium slowly to ""0"" benzos.

I feel that doctors are very judgmental and act as if you're trying to find something to get high off of if you ask for a presciption. It has helped me with anxiety 100%_ even if I was ever depressed_ it helped then as well. It helps me relax because I have back problems and an overall feeling of wellness. I was prescribed this about 5 years ago and have been taking it ever since. I can't see any reason why I should try to get off of a drug that is actually very helpful to me. Most doctors try to give you those cruddy anti depressants. No thank you!!! I have seen what it has done to other people_ (not good)_ I have read the side effects_ (even worse). No way in heck are they going to give me that junk. Doctors need to leave well enough alone. If it works_ leave it alone..what's the big deal. It has helped me a great deal. I find no reason to get off of it and I don't plan to. Highly recommended.,F,32,5  years,6/24/2008,Valium

I did not experience the euphoria others talk about! One positive side effect: somewhat improved my libido.,The effects of Valium were very mild for my anxiety attacks. In fact_ I could hardly feel it working; unless I had taken it constantly every day for a week or longer (the build up effect_ which is necessary for long acting benzo's). But then still_ the anxiety dampening was week & the depression the stronger. I tried it out for 2 seperate periods: 10 mg/2x/day. And also: 10 mg/4x/day. I took Valium as a monotherapy.,F,40,1  months,5/21/2008Email,Valium

227, 5, Stress_ Anxiety_Phobias_Obesessive,Sleepy sometimes_ dependency_ aggressivness from waking up in the morning. Forget things sometimes,I love this drug. I am 27 years old and have suffered from major panic attacks since a very small child. I have been prescribed my many doctor's SSR's_ which I hate and make everything worse and the side effects are way to much to bear. I do reccommend this drug if you have severe panic attacks or if you are bipolar_ I had 1 doctor tell me I am_ I do not believe him. I think it is just anxiety. I have to order my Valium online without prescriptions. I can not get a doctor to prescribe them longer than 2 weeks. They are always trying to give me SSR's. It works for me and many other I know. I am a better listener and I can speak in front of large groups at work_ I am calmer around my daughter and family. I am not so much worried about the addiction_ I am glad the anxiety is gone and if I have to take this for the rest of my life I will. I have taken this on and off for 5 years. This is the longest I have taken it on a daily basis.,F,27,2  months,4/1/2008Email,Valium

231, 5, insomnia,none,If I need a good night's sleep_ I take 5mg valium an hour before bedtime. I will then get a solid sleep and wake up feeling much more refreshed than I usually do. It's very effective.,M,46,2  years,3/7/2008Email,Valium
232, 5, CFS_ anxiety_ guilt_ doom feelings,I'm taking between 5 and 10mg a day and this helps me get a grip on things_ so I can function and not suffer as much.Valium. 5mg_ 20-30 minutes in you will notice a good relaxation and bit of a social buzz_ this wears this wears off within an hour but stress and anxiety and muscle tension don't return for at least 12 hours. Valium is also a great muscle relaxer and could be used for this alone. 10mg valium I would say is equivalent to 800mg skelaxin if you are familiar with it. Skelaxin with valium also is better than Skelaxin alone_ which can cause feelings of agitation as well as insomnia. On that note_ valium is good for insomnia unlike these next two benzos I will mention.Many people are confused about which benzo is best for them (because it's so hard to get doctors to give you the one you want if you had a choice) but I have been able to try a few others. Xanax .5mg_ possible headaches_ harder to notice_ a bit blunting of emotions. Less sedating. Not that useful to me.R,Valium is one of the few drugs I can endorse for CFS and I've tried many types of drugs for my condition. I find it superior to an SSRI in dealing with my neurotic guilt and depression. Without valium. I can't clean more than 5 minutes without worrying about something else or being so fixated on my constant pain and muscle aches I have to stop. With valium. I can calm down and spend 2 hours or so doing chores. Still tired_ but I can take it slow without becoming frustrated at myself and illness. Talk about night and day. I was also given the stimulant Ritalin to try for fatigue and brain fog. This made me stress worse and become even more up tight. So ironically_ I am far more motivated and less fatigued taking Valium which is a sedative. Go figure.I also believe it is not as good for pure panic disorders. In which case like Klonopin or Xanax are more suitable. If you have a hard time getting valium or aren't sure what to say to a doctor_ complain of muscle fatigue_ insomnia_ s,M,23,1  months,3/4/2008Email,Valium

235, 4, Anxiety and Depression,None,Valium is a weaker version of the popular Xanax but last a lot longer. Valium doesn't make me forgetful and just kinda mellows me out if I'm in a enclosed space. It doesn't really make me fall asleep and it does make me function normally. A 10mg of Valium equals a .50 of Xanax. I think though Xanax works faster than Valium. I have no real side effects with Valium though. If your kinda not sure about taking anti-Anxiety medications_ I would ask your doctor if you could try Valium. It might be all you need for Anxiety issues.,F,30,3  months,2/16/2008,Valium
236, 5, Back pain/anxiety,forgetfulness_ drowsiness,"I was on Valium for a bout a solid year on a fairly low but regular dose (2MG twice a day).   Gradually faded off and now take only once in a blue moon.   With other life changes_ this drug has helped me tremendously.  I was diagnosed with mild scoliosis_ and when situational anxiety would occur_ the muscles in my upper back would spasm and I would also experience symptoms of panic attack.  The valium absolutely stopped these reactions in their tracks.  But the real key to changing was also making lifestyle changes also; left a very stressful job for one and also got a new matress to help my back!  Tapering off the daily dose was no problem_ and I maintain a prescription on hand with refills_ but must say that right now I don't feel the need to take the drug at all.  Comming off experience can sort of be described as gradually ""waking up"".

It's the only thing that really works to loosen up my neck and jaw muscles after I was in a car accident two years ago_ other than myofascial release performed by a physical therapist. My only beef with this drug is that doctors are paranoid about prescribing it due to the addictive properties_ even for those of us who don't use it daily.

Mild euphoria gave way a couple of hours later to an out of control crying session with severe hostility and some paranoia thrown in for good measure.

258, 4, Followup from 6/15 posting,Headaches have gone away. Muscle cramps have gone away and muscle twitching is less frequent. I only take 5 mg of Valium  four times a day_ not the 20 mg substitution as recommended for each 1 mg reduction of Klonopin. Extreme mood swings but I don't know if that's from Klonopin reduction or from Valium. Some depression and at times feelings of hopelessness_ thinking Ill never get better. Insomnia following each titration downward. Worst of all_ I had a seizure when I reduced Klonopin too quickly_ far more then the recommended 10% every 2-3 weeks and without a concurrent Valium substitution. Stupid!!!!!!!,I found a Dr. through the VA who has used this method of tapering off the more potent benzos using Valium (Diazipam) substitution. Valium has the longest half-life of  any benzo without most of the nasty side effects. Even so_ this has not been easy. Im down to 2 mg of  Klonopin a day. Valium definitely helps with the worst of the anxiety_ but theres no way of avoiding some withdrawal. Some of this may be because I have not followed the exact equivalency substitution advised. I have substituted less Valium for Klonopin than recommended. I am too afraid of  becoming addicted to another benzo_ even thought Dr. and support groups say this is unlikely.

Valium is the only benzo to use to taper_ if anyone wishes to get off these horrid_ addicting poisons. Here is the wedsite: http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/index.htm. It contains the rationale behind using Valium to taper off. There is also a message board w/ others who are withdrawing_ for support: http://benzoisland.org/index.html. No matter what your doctor tells you_ benzo drugs like Valium_ are addicting and will ruin you physically and psychologically_ eventually. It will catch up with you_ don't fool yourself. Withdrawal_ be it interdose or tolerance withdrawal_ WILL happen; it's only a matter of time and it is very unpleasant. There is NO good or legit reason to take any benzodiazepine drug (Xanax_ Valium_ Ativan_ Klonopin_ etc) - except Valium_ in order to get off them.

262, 4, Using it to titrate off of Klonopin,Headache_ drowsiness in the morning. Hard time getting my Dr. to prescribe and go along with treatment program. Valium supposedly is far less addicting than some other benzos_ with far fewer side effects. I hope that turns-out to be true.,I decided to get off of all benzos after much reading and having a friend who was abusing Xanax kill himself (may have been other issues_ too). I was taking about 4 mg of Klonopin daily. I read a lot of the reseach on benzos by Dr. Heather Ashton_ one of the world's leading authorities on benzos. I was shocked to see her equivalency table for Klonopin and Xanax. 1 mg of Klonopin or Xanax is equel to 20 mg of Valium. That's right_ 20!! Plus_ Klonopin and Xanax have nasty side effects. That did it for me. No more benzos!! Because Valium has the longest half-life of any benzo and the least side effects_ I'm using it and water-titration to get off Klonopin_ a method widly used in Europe. 10% reduction every 10-14 days. So far so good.,M,55,20  days,6/15/2007,Valium

266, 1, muscle spasm shoulders and back,No immediate side effects except slight drowsiness_ but over 2 years_ emotional dullness_ dull-wittedness_ and depression/sadness. It made me less human.,Don't take this for more than a few days_ and then only if absolutely necessary for pain or panic. It is wonderful for anxiety and muscle spasms_ true. You'll sleep deeply and long. But when you try to quit_ you'll experience anxiety/panic/insomnia like you never thought possible_ as well as headaches and irritability. 5-9 days after tapering down from 2 yrs of a maximum dose of 10 mg a day to 0.5 (this took 4 weeks because of headaches) I was anxious_ irritable and completely unable to fall asleep for more than 1 hour. This can last for 2 weeks after you quit. Don't take for more than 2-3 days unless you get major help tapering off_ including sleeping pills for the insomnia you will no doubt experience. Also_ don't quit abruptly or you can have seizures. Is this drug really worth the trouble? I wish I had never started it_ even though it relieved my pain so well. Not worth it.,F,52,2  years,5/22/2007,Valium

I initially was prescribed valium to treat symptoms of Meniere's Disease_ an inner ear disorder that produces vertigo and nausea. Later_ I was diagnosed with GAD and my psych kept me on it.  Valium worked very well for me for both diagnoses. However_ although I never abused it per se_ I had to stop taking it in 1999 when I had an alcoholic crash and started doing the AA thing. But it really did work for me.  I just want back and read all this and see how strange it sounds. All true though...,M,54,17  years,5/2/2007,Valium

269, 3, Panic Anxiety,Not really many - less then most_ it is a good long term solution with few side effects - I have taken it many times over the years but I just got a prescription for the first time in 4 years today.,IMO 5 mg of valium is a joke_ if you have anxiety I would ask for the 10's. Truthfully it takes about 25mg to really do anything for me that is effective and I only take it for a month or so every few years. i just got a script for 100 5mg and I had to take 5 straight away to get satisfactory results. It should really be available in 30mg tabs for panic anxiety_ but it has none of the bizarre side effects seen with xanax. Klonopin is a good alternative which is stronger but does have more side effects_ enough so that it is my second choice.,M,36,1  days,4/19/2007,Valium

I have only recently been prescribed Valium and I feel like a normal person again_ after all this time. I'm now relaxed at social events. No more panic attacks.

I am one that idealy would NEVER want to take a pill to reduce my intense anxiety_ but it seemed to be the only solution.  I do not agree with the idea of ""getting high"" and altering your state of mind when not necessary (as it necessitates ""fake happiness"")_ but valium calms me down enough to feel the ""normal"" anxieties that most people feel.

He does not seem worried as long as I am at the same dosage as I was all along_ which I am--10mg a day. If I do take an extra dose_ it has no effect--in fact it seems to mitigate the effects of the others. It's weird. I think my body is just very_ very used to it.,F,54,5  days,3/14/2007,Valium

275, 5, Severe Anxiety,No bad side effects at all,Valium has been a life saver for me.  I have suffered from anxiety for almost a decade now and I have found it hard to keep it under control.  Behavioral therapy did not control it nor did most other non-benzos.  At the age of 17 I was prescribed Xanax and by the age of 19 I was on the maximum allowed dose and addicted.  Not only did I have to face my addiction...I had to face the fact that I didnt have my anxiety under control.  I was weened onto Klonpin which did absolutely nothing for me and I eventually was prescribed Valium.  I now take it on an as needed basis.  I am allowed up to 10 mgs twice a day but I can take it or leave it.  I find it less addictive.  I have been on it now for about 5 years and I am doing great.,F,26,5  years,3/3/2007,Valium

Tranxene at a very low dose was reluctantly prescribed by my therapist who didn't believe in drugs.  I was concerned about addiction and used it only for emergencies.  For the last 10 years or so I have been taking Serax at 30 mg. daily.  Finally It was not acceptable due to the very short duration.  For the last 3 weeks I have been using valium at 10mg. once a day in the morning.

However_ the spasms got worse and I couldn't sleep at all. My wife  could even see and feel knots on the back of my head from where the muscles were bound-up like marbles. Valium is the only thing that completely eliminates the spasms- within an hour. Pain goes from a 5 to ZERO! Valium has been a Godsend when I was at the end of my rope.

Increased libido (interest in sex).  Elevated liver enzymes (GGT and ALT).  All of these side effects are mild and don't cause me much concern.  Benefits outweigh the risks.,A psychiatrist first prescribed me 5mg QID (4x/day) in 1989 for panic disorder after medications failed or had dangerous side effects.  I was switched to high dose Xanax later on but Xanax was too short-acting.  Tapering Xanax was impossible_ so my doctor put me back on Valium and tapered me down to 10mg BID.  It is very easy to taper Valium as it is long-acting.  I feel calm and rarely have panic attacks anymore. I don't like the sedative effects_ but there is no other drug out there that helps my panic attacks without dangerous or intolerable side effects. I'm on a French antidepressant called tianeptine (Stablon) and it works very well for my depression and anxiety.  Along with Valium_ I feel relatively normal_ except that I wish I had some of my motivation back_ but I had a lack of motivation prior to being on Valium.  Overall_ this is a great medication.

I take it at night which greatly minimizes the fatigue from Valium_ while still working as well.  Since I was 14_ I've pulled or cut or picked my split ends_ sometimes resulting in bald patches_ because of my obsessive compulsive disorder.  I stumbled across valium after trying zoloft_ prozac_ wellbutrin_ and several other drugs.  I was prescribed valium for surgery and has a very pleasant side effect - a complete cureall for my OCD!  Do you know what a good feeling it is to be able to grow out your hair again?  I am very pleased this worked for me but I don't know why because they do not traditionally prescribe this drug for trich.  NOTHING else worked at all.

This is a great drug.,Without Valium my mind would not stop at bedtime.  This drug worked perfectly (let me sleep)and let me wake refreshed [5mg at bedtime].

I now use Valium for headaches and occasional leg shakes(5 mg at night).  Now_ I do not take it every day; more like every other day.,M,55,2  years,3/27/2005Email,Valium

335, 5, Panic disorder_ generalized anxiety,Drowsiness,I can't say enough good things about Valium. Contrary to some popular opinions_ it isn't a widely-abused drug.  Most people who take Valium need it.  When I can't get a hold on my anxiety with cognitive behavioral methods or I'm having many panic attacks_ I take a Valium and it helps me calm down_ rest_ and then get back to my life.  I have taken it on an as-needed basis for about 5 years.  I sometimes go weeks and weeks without taking any Valium_ but I know it is there when I need it_ and it works great.  I just wish there weren't this sort of stigma attached to it; some people think you just want to get high when in reality it is a lifesaver for those of us who are terribly nervous and anxious.,F,29,5  years,9/21/2004,Valium

I don't consider myself to be addicted to it.
