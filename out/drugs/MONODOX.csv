0, 1, rosacea,This drug worked well to reduce the Rosacea initially but my body became toxic over time. (Took it as a maintenance drug 3 x week) Liver enzymes elevated and it created Antibiotic induced Liver Disease.  The only clue it was hurting my body was a horrible case of pruritis ani.  Only use topical for Rosacea and eliminate health problems.   It took 3 months to resolve itself with strict diet and elimated alcohol.,,F,45,3  years 1X D,1/21/2011,Monodox
