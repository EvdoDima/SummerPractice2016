0, 5, Wisdom tooth pain,I experienced  diarrhea shortly after I started taking the capsules. The dentist told me to stop taking them for two or three days_ then resume. I did this and the diarrhea didn't happen again. I experienced tightness  in my throat immediately after taking the capsule. The pain in my tooth subsided then stopped. I've noticed that since taking this drug_ that my defecation has become more normal. It used to be on a weekly or longer cycle_ with large bowel motion. It is now on a two day cycle with smaller bowel motions. An interesting drug!,,M,78,7  days300mg 4X D,7/30/2016,Clindamycin hydrochloride
