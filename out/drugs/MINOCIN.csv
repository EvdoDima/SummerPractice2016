8, 3, Acne,I was on minocycline for a while and it worked great_ but I had these pesky pimples that would not go away for anything. So I asked the dermatologist to put me on something stronger and he put me on Bactrum. Well_ Bactrum did not help at all so we switched back to minocycline. A few weeks later I was experiencing unbelievable joint pain_ swelling and fever symptoms. I couldn't move without every joint aching. We went to a bunch of specialists_ but none of them thought it was the medicine. My aunt finally told me that a friend of my cousin's had a similar reaction. So I stopped the minocycline and have been recuperating.,,F,17,4  months100,4/28/2015,Minocin

However_ the side effects indicated that I was allergic to the medicine.  I would definitely recommend this medicine to those that know they aren't alergic to it.,F,22,5  days 1X D,6/16/2010,Minocin
15, 1, acne,weight loss (water weight)_ ringing in the ears_ weakness_ yeast infection_ possible LUPUS!,I took it a few years ago when I had a bad breakout. Got rid of my acne_ but when I started to feel weak I went right off. Honestly I don't think anybody should go on this drug or anything in the oral acne treatment category. People should be warned of the possible life changing side effects of ORAL acne medication. I went back on another low level acne treatment called solodyn despite my resistance. I gave in anyway to cure another bad breakout (due to stress). After three to four long months I finally saw results. My acne got worse before it got better though. Unfortunately_ as soon as my skin cleared up I got a BAD case of ringworm. Turns out the solodyn changed my immune system and I couldn't get rid of the nasty fungus until I went off the med. After taking a blood test my lab report came back positive for antibodies. Now I have to go back for more tests to see if I have drug induced lupus. I'm writing about solodyn b/c it is in the same class as minocycline. Everyone should be aware of the risks involved with all oral acne antibiotics. If I had a choice I would rather live with the occasional acne than have lupus.,F,23,4  months 1X D,2/12/2010,Minocin
16, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis,Occasional yeast infections,This drug has worked amazingly well for my rheumatoid arthritis. I was taking the chemotherapy drug methotrexate and after beginning to take Minocin every second day  I was eventually able to stop taking the methotrexate completely. That was almost a year ago and my Rheumatologist says my disease is in clinical remission! The only downside is that when you're taking minocin you have to also take probiotics and eat a lot of probiotic foods so that you don't get yeast overgrowth. Compared to the pain and disability that arthritis often causes_ eating probiotic foods is not a high price to pay. Minocin gave me my life back!,F,43,2  years,11/11/2009,Minocin

18, 2, tooth ache,dizziness_ headache_ depersonalization_ i felt ill,i was perscribed minocycline for acne but i never took it. i had a toothache and the dentist said to start taking this because it would kill the bacterial infection i had. i took it for 3 days_ 100 mg at morning and 100 mg at night_ and the swelling on my tooth went down but i had to stop using it because it made me feel like a zombie and like i was on my death bed. im not suprised that it puts people in the hospital. it also turned the whites of my eyes a little bit yellow. it's yucky,F,19,3  days,1/17/2009,Minocin
19, 3, Acne,None while taking the drug. Flare up every time I tried to stop taking it. Possible hyperpigmentation.,I loved taking this drug as my skin cleared up completely and I had no side effects. However_ I become a slave to it_ every time I tried to stop taking it a had a flare up and had to take another course of tablets. 2 years later I become worried about the long-term side effects I decided to stop it for good. Had a flare up again but eventually it cleared. More worryingly every time I have a cut or scratch it scars quite badly and the scar won't fade for ages. Same thing with bruises_ for example_ I bumped into some furniture and the bruise in my leg wouldn't go for ages_ even after weeks when the purple/blue cleared I still had a a greyish mark. Eventually it cleared. Beware_ the doctors don't tell you about the risks_ I asked my doctor more then once about the consequences of taking this drug for a long period of time. Do some research on the web before taking it. I'll only take it again if there's no other option.,F,30,2  years,10/12/2008,Minocin
20, 3, acne,none!,"I took this medicine for about 5 months for my acne. It worked pretty good at first_ it kept it under control_ but didn't really get rid of it fully. My doctor ended up switching me from this medicine to another antibiotic. I only took 100 MG then had it reduced to 50 MG after three months. I had absolutely NO SIDE EFFECTS at all_ and I'm not a very ""tough"" person_ I've had my share of odd reactions from medicine. I recommend this for people with mild to slightly moderate acne.",F,18,5  months,9/5/2008,Minocin
21, 1, rosacea,nausea_ dizziness chemical hepatitus,this medication should not be handed out by dermatologists. I was incredibly ill with a virus according to my PCP_ because the minicin did something odd to my immune system. I recovered quickly once off the drug_ but this is not a drug to take lightly. I'm happier having the rosacea.,F,51,7  days,8/24/2008,Minocin
22, 2, Rosace flair-up,Extreme headache pain_ primarily on the left side of my head_ pressure and pain behind my left eye with swelling of the tissue around the eye_ and blurred vision.,It did seem to help calm my rosace flair; however I was not made aware that the Minocin could cause these side-effects.  I was in so much pain from the side effects that it drove me to see a primary care doc for what I thought (and so did the Dr.)was a sinus infection.  I was treated with Augmentin 875 for 18 days which caused a whole other set of side-effects - fatigue_ insomina_ more headache_ numbness and tremor in my left hand.  In short_ my health has taken a downward spiral all because of meds. I've since stopped all antiobiotics and am trying to flush this junk out of my body. I used to be in really good health for my age and I want it back.  I will try a more natural approach if I have another flair up.  If anyone else has experienced similar side-effects_ please e-mail me.,F,59,3  weeks,7/23/2008Email,Minocin
23, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis,Limited jaundice which corrected after dose reduction_ some limited dizziness at original dosage,I've been taking minocin for three years with continued improvements except for a flare up here and there.  My sed rate was still a little high but that was due to unrelated hypertension which is now corrected with diet and meds. Highly recommended if tolerated.,M,52,3  years,1/29/2008,Minocin
24, 4, acne,jaundice_ increase in liver blood tests results_ fatigue,I took minocycline for 1.5 years and noted suddenely that my skin and eyes became jaundice.  My Nurse Practitioner stopped the medication and my jaundice went away and my blood work became normal in 3 months.  I was so happy because I thought I may have had some more serious disease. It did help my acne though,F,17,1  days,12/2/2007,Minocin

26, 2, Acne,aches and pains_ difficulty breathing_ headaches_ fatigue_ general sick feeling_ dizziness/vertigo,I took this about 2 weeks.  The first week was ok_ just some headaches.  But right around day 10 or 12 the other side effects kicked in.  I stopped it for 3 days_ restarted_ only to have them return within hours.  I had a bad reaction in the past to doxicycline (also a tetracycline drug). I don't recommend taking this if you have had a bad reaction to any other tetracycline drug. I wasn't on it long enough to see improvement in my acne.,F,26,2  weeks,7/10/2007,Minocin
27, 4, acne,weight loss- that's a GOOD thing,I first took minocin at age 18 b/c of an acne cyst.  It cleared promptly and I also ended up losing 10 pounds in a month- not at all a problem for me!  My first experience with minocin only lasted 2 months since it was just for that one cyst.  At 22_ I was put on minocin again for a continuous basis b/c I'd suddenly developed acne that wouldn't go away with ordinary cleansers.  I'd never had an issue with acne- ever- other than that one cyst.  This time around_ it took about 5 months worth of minocin to get results.  My body is now resistant to minocin_ so I am no longer taking it.  My skin looks great compared to how it was before treatment_ though.,F,23,8  months,4/10/2007,Minocin
28, 4, cystic acne,Upset stomach-I would get nauseous and sometimes throw up.  One time I got so sick I actually had to go to the hospital.,"I have been taking this drug on and off for years. I have to eat yogurt or take acidophilus to replace the ""good bacteria"" that the mincoin was taking out of my stomach.  Apparently this is common when taking any antibiotics but none of the doctors ever told me.  After I knew that I just eat some yogurt every couple of days and I'm fine!

30, 1, acne,"""Lupus-like symptoms""_ severe & chronic arthritis",Years ago I took minocycline for a year or so without problem then went off it for the summer (cause it makes the sun worse on you if you go outside a lot).  The first day I took it again after the summer ended_ I got severe and chronic arthritis everywhere.  It kind of dissipated a bit after a few days_ so I decided to try another pill a few weeks later just to make sure that was what caused it - yep.  It was TERRIBLE!!  I've had pain before_ but nothing before or since could have prepared me for it.  24/7 EVERYTHING HURT!!  Walking across rooms HURT.  The only time I was remotely OK was when I was lying completely still.  My parents freaked out because I was in so much pain and when I had to move I moved like an old lady.  I must have gone to 10 different doctors and none of them knew what caused it (because obviously it couldn't be the wonderful minocycline!).  Bullshit.  Eventually my father found some other people online who had similar symptoms and we went to a doctor who would a,F,23,1  years,1/28/2007Email,Minocin
31, 1, acne,"""Lupus-like symptoms""_ severe & chronic arthritis",# just wanted to finish my last entry...#...a doctor who would actually believe that this was the cause.  She prescribed me an anti-inflammatory and it worked amazingly well.  For several months later I felt mild arthritis_ but nothing compared to those first 5-6 months.  About a year and a few months after I took those 2 pills_ the minocycline had finally left my system and I felt fine. Apparently there's a 1/10_000 chance of this happening to anyone who takes the drug.  Don't believe the pharmaceutical companies - their interest is in $_ not in your health.,F,23,1  years,1/28/2007Email,Minocin
32, 3, acne,The drug worked well to clear up my acne and I ended up staying on it otherwise my flare up would continue.  Years down the road I had to have surgery and afterwards my bruising would not go away.  The doctor who did the surgury could not figure this out_ so he quized me on how long I'd been on Minocin for.  It had been about 5 years.  He then pulled out his medical book and read that Minocin_ after being on it for an extended period of time_ can leave deposits in your body which caused my above condition.  The bruising eventually faded and went away completely.  Another problem I experienced is the deposits ended up in my teeth.  I have grayish colored teeth and my dentist blames this on the minocin.  This will never fade or go away.  Watch your teeth color and bruising.,,F,38,5  years,1/7/2007,Minocin

It was unbearable_ drove me mad but I tried to persevere as I could see good changes in my acne!  My doc said to stop the pills immediately as I had a rare allergy to them.,Definately worth a try for acne sufferers_ I hate that I developed an allergy_ but as I said_ it is rare to have this so you should be okay.
