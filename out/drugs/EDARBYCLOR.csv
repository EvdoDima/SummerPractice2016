0, 1, High Blood Pressure,At first things seemed fine. My bloodpressure almost immediately went to normal  But in May (after 6 months on it) my doctor decided to check my blood chemistry. WHOA!!!  My numbers were so off ... Monocytes had dropped to 100 (should be 200-900)_ my Creatinine was 2.10 (indicating renal problems which I'd never had!) my kidney function dropped from 87% (before taking Edarbyclor) to 25% after ... and my uric acid SOARED to 12.1 (6 or lower is the norm).  I developed gout which had to be treated with shots in my feet.  And in the last 2 months I was having bouts of coughing which I had not related until the results came in and all these horrible side effects were realized.,I have not had such an INSIDIOUS reaction to any medications. If your doctor does put you on this_ take baby steps. Agree to a blood panel monthly to catch the moment the problems begin so you can stop in time. You will not feel negative effects until the internal damage has been done.  I have no idea how long it will take to recover from this. HORRIBLE!!!,F,51,7  months40/25 1X D,6/18/2015Email,Edarbyclor
