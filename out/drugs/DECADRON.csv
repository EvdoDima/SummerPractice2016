20, 5, Addison's disease,Slight muscle ache sometimes_ usually in my arms or wrists. I was put on this medication when I was first diagnosed with Addisons. I noticed an increase in my appetite_ but somehow I actually lost several pounds on this medication without even trying. It was really nice because I did not lose weight from Addisons itself_ which usually causes weight loss before it is treated. It improved my symptoms completely_ I felt normal again_ with enough energy to live life! My doctor worked me down to 1 mg a day_ and then switched me to hydrocortisone. Since starting hydrocortisone 3 months ago_ I still feel normal and energized_ but I have gained 30 lbs. I wish I could go back on dexamethasone because it didn't have that side effect for me_ but since I have to be on steroids for the rest of my life_ I can't (dexamethasone builds up in the body_ hydrocortisone doesn't). Anyway_ I liked this medication.,,F,20,3  months4mg-->1 mg,10/1/2014,Decadron

24, 1, brain tumor that spread from lung,Mother in-law took it.it did its job of keeping the swelling in brain down after radiation treatments.she was however never able to get off of it because her body was so used it to it and couldnt adjust to being off of it.when she tried getting off of it all she did was throw up and lost alot of weight. When on it she had major muscle weakness_couldnt get up on her own and could no longer walk.and as it was upped she had halucinations and began to have some dementia.decadron is evil and it kills. I firmly beleive its what killed her because her cancer was responding to treatment.She ended up having no quality of life and died 9 months after starting it. There are other steroids out there_ so only use decadron as a very last resort.i wish it was never made and hope one day it is no longer used because all it does is kill you.,,F,64,9  months2mg-6mg,4/20/2014Email,Decadron

I forced myself to not attack her and I've never felt anything like that in my life. When I returned the next day for my second day of chemo the nurse asked me what I was feeling and as soon as I told them I felt like I was dying THEY KNEW it was Decadron and removed it from my treatment.  I gradually felt better within days but I was told I had the opposite reaction to the drug that was supposed to give me euphoria.  I also have the opposite reaction with other steroids.  Once with a frozen shoulder I received a steriod shot for pain and the following pain was truly unbearable for days.

Blood pressure issues_ Very low hearth rate ( under 50 while sitting). Fog minded,This is my DAD. My mom is the main caretaker. The main issue was the jekyll and hyde like switch of the person. When the steroid hit his system he became Mr Hyde. A completely different person. when the dose was reduced to 1MG a day be was then become like a very old 90 year nice man that just sites and watches TV only of others turn it on first. Also the lost of balance stopped and he whent from a whell chair to slow walking with no help. Now with a new treatment they have infected him with more steroid with the other chemo and again Mr Hyde is back and mean as ever. Now that we know what is causing the issue we will be looking into stopping the steroid use. My dad is completely incompatible with the hellish drug.

36, 3, Bee Sting - intense swelling,Agitation/Anger/Rage,My 14 y/o son was given this medication through injection just above he buttocks to help with swelling and pain from a bee sting. He seemed crabby on and off all afternoon_ but by about 8:30 that night he was beyond aggitated. He got mad about not being able to watch a movie and flipped out. Screaming and yelling and babbling about things that made no sense. My son NEVER behaves this way. I thought almost immediately that this had to be a reaction the that shot. This fit lasted about an hour_ to the point that I was about to get him in the card and take him to the ER. He got himself so worked up that I was certain he was going to pass out because he couldn't breathe. When we finally were able to calm him down and get him to catch his breath_ we settled him into his bed and I listened to him cry himself to sleep. This is not normal behavior. I called the Doc's office this morning and was told that it was_ indeed_ a reaction to the Decordron.,M,14,1  days1 Shot 1X D,5/29/2012Email,Decadron
37, 1, Cancer,My mother was on this drug for 2 weeks after receiving radiation treatment for a brain tumor. She had stage iv breast cancer that had spread to the lungs and then the brain. Up until she took this drug she was her normal_ wonderful self. Decadron robbed my family of the final 2 weeks of my mothers life. She became the EXACT OPPOSITE person. Yelling hateful things at us_ acting crazy and refusing any help. She was a strong Christian and on this drug as she was praying she would pray to the 'dark power' and ask for the good to be overcome by evil. It was the most difficult thing I have ever experienced. Months later I researched and found countless other similar stories_ including many here. There are better options and this drug should be taken off the market.

Negative - Taking this medication on a busy day at work when you can't eat.  Your blood sugar will drop suddenly and you will have to stop and eat.  Pros- No pain anywhere on my body.  I organized my house and cleaned it from top to bottom_ manicured my yard at 3:00 am with a flashlight in hand.  I had the energy of 10 people and got more done in that one week on decadron than the whole year off of it.   This drug was like an energy pill for me_ physically and mentally.

She was given haldol to take to counter hallucinations. I'm wondering how long this will last. This is not my wife and it is terrifying.

The tremors are constant and the moon face is surprising although I monitor my diet and haven't gained as much weight_ but cravings are unbelievable....difficult to manage and make sure I don't go overboard on things.

Impossible to get a full night of sleep (3 uninterrupted hours was a GOOD night).,Decadron was a necessary evil.  If I hadn't been taking this nastiness_ my brain would have continued to be inflamed_ causing me more massive headaches and making my life hell.

Doctor says I have no choice because radiation can cause brain to swell_ which would not be good.  Has me on low_ low dose now.,Decadron is the pill from HELL.

It's been 12 hours and the side effects still haven't worn off. I was screaming and cussing like there was no tomorrow_ and I never behave that way. It's repulsing. My sore throat is gone but I would gladly welcome it back if my side effects would disappear. I suggest asking if there is ANYTHING else you could possibly have in place of decadron because you WILL be miserable. I feel like i'm in hell and when my mom reported it they said it can stay in my system for up to 10 days.

I believe the drug just weakened his legs so severely that he could not walk. And that it just wore him out completeley_ as well as those who were privileged to care for him.  I would never recommend this drug_ I believe it contributed greatly to killing him. The doctors say it is now in my blood also. Be sure to wear gloves if you have to handle the bed clothes and undergarments of a person taking this drug.  I also feel very strongly that oral Temodar for chemotherapy is a cruel_ painful_ dangerous_ ineffective way to treat brain cancer.  They don't even know if it passes through the brain/blood barrier.,The doctors and hospice people tried to convince me this is a good drug_ but from my experience with it 24/7 for 4 months I just can't believe it.

104, 5, Brain Lesion,Was originally put on this because I was told that I had a brain tumor in my brain stem.  Effects while I took this was mania_ roid rage_ extreme insomnia_ moon face_ weight gain_ and tired easily.  Found out that the doctor misdiagnosed me as the lesion in my brain got smaller (thank God).  Have been off for nine weeks and this stuff is still not out of me.  I have swollen hands_ join pain that makes it hard to stand at first and walk.   This stuff did it's job but I hate it with a passion.  God willing I will never have the need for it again but if I do_ I will ask the doctor for something else.  Does anyone have an idea how long this stuff takes to completely leave your system?  Forgot to mention_ last three weeks I have broken out in acne all over my chest_ shoulders and back.  My dosage of this stuff was 12 mg per day when I was on it.,Words can't describe how much I HATE what this stuff does to you.,M,41,3.5  days,2/22/2009Email,Decadron
105, 2, ITP,I experienced all of the side effects listed_ was on up to 40mg per day for over 6 months. ITP eventually went into remission_ but I have had teriible joint pain and fatigue since getting off the medication in September. This is ruining by quality of life and no doctors can figure out why I have these symptoms or long they might last. Has anyone else had a simular experience. I used to run and work out every day; now I can barely get out of bed. I alsdo took predinisone for for 3-4 months prior to the decadron_ but it did not work on my ITP.,,F,52,180  days,1/2/2009Email,Decadron

108, 1, Pinched cervical nerve,"Was given large IV dose then ""tapered off"" via oral (30 mg/day!).  While the IV dose did eliminate the intolerable pain nearly instantly_ after affects were terrible.  While taking_ my hands swelled considerably and I was extremely apprehensive.  Worst problems began about 12 hours after last dose.  I felt like I was ""slowing down"" and leaving my body.  Looking down to the ground from a 3rd floor balcony looked no different than looking down at my feet.  Completely lost my sense of taste and feeling in my mouth though it did not feel numb.  Was hospitalized with steroid psychosis and truly felt I would die the first night by falling asleep.  Monitor technician repeatedly came to room to check connections as my vitals became extremely low.  For over a week I could only walk--VERY slowly--by shuffling my feet.  Took nearly two weeks for my sense of taste to return.  Could barely stand riding in a car as I involuntarily moved with the motions of the car to the point th",While the IV mega-dose did appear to releave an acute situation_ the after affects were terrifying_ dangerous and extremely costly.

Dehabilitaiting loss of calf muscle leading to inability to walk 2-3 months).  Extreme arm skin discoloration.  Uncontrolable appetite. Dangerous increased uncontrollable blood sugar (non diabetic) beware of this!,The cascade of side affects of this drug drove the adminstering of a cocktail of drugs to counter all the effects of the decadron.  This drug lead caused my mother to become to uncontrollable and debilitated that she could not be cared for at home.  As a result of the effects of the Decadron_ she was then overdosed with other drugs to counter her uncontrollable anger and force her to be bedridden.  After she could no longer walk more drugs were administered.  Her blood sugar climbed so high that it would not register on the meters.  The doctors were so intent on escalating the dosage all of these drugs they totally lost site of the basic requirements to support life.  After being diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor_ my wonderfully healthy Mother deteriorated every minute after she was given Decadron.  There was no medical treatment that provided any benefit to her.  There is not enough room here to explain_ but I warn you that I am 100% certain that Decadron destroyed my Mothers,F,85,180  days,6/17/2008Email,Decadron

There was no pain during or at the injection site_ nor was there any burning or soreness afterwards.  I did however feel a great relief in my shortness of breath within an hour of receiving the injection.  I was also given Symbicort_ an inhalation aerosol_ in addition to the ProAir HFA that I was already using.  My doctor suggested that I get the Decadron & Kenalog injection at the beginning of every Spring and Fall_ since this was the time frame I normally have problems with my Asthma.  I was told it would last up to 3 months.  It was a life saver for me!,THANK YOU!,F,49,1  days,6/7/2008,Decadron

114, 2, Inflammatory Skin Condition,I took a short burst_ of .25 pills.  5 pills the first day_ 4 the second_ down to 1 on the 5th day.  Despite the lower dose-I had significant side effects that did more harm than good.  Extreme feelings of stress_ anger_ irritability_ etc.  Feeling like I was fed up with everything and had no tolerance.  Some agitation_ anxiety_ revved up feeling.  Ravenous--eating everything in sight at night.  Increased metabolism_ feeling like I was on speed.  Also-more flaring/inflammation in some areas.  Constant dull headache-back of head.  Some more acute pain at base of skull when moved head.  Started having what felt like deep-rooted bone or muscular pain in legs and lower part of body.  I did have some enhanced cognition-as if I could suddenly understand things more clearly_ more efficient_ think smarter_ etc. but I was too hyper.  I also noticed a dramatic increase in Obsessive Compulsive thoughts and behaviors.  This was not a good drug for me_ and I don't intend to take it again.  The side,Although some skin areas seemed less inflammed at first_ and were drying up- they were outweighed by increased inflammation and flaring. The drug not only seemed to cause some inflammation; but it increased my stress level_ anxiety_ and OCD to the point where it was much harder not to react to the skin.  I felt on a very acute edge of stress_ aggravation_ etc.  Not good to help the skin!  The secondary effects on emotion and behavior did more harm to my skin than any small benefits originally.  By increasing my stress/anxiety level_ it probably increased skin flares.  I could not handle how I felt on this drug_ even at a short burst on a lower dose.  Felt like it was making me crazy_ with some confusion.,F,48,5  days,3/18/2008Email,Decadron

This stuff is wicked and I was on this (assume a higher dose) after having brain tumor removed surgically years ago.  I understand that I was IMPOSSIBLE to deal with when I was on the drug the first time.  My wife thought that they had cut a wire when they were in removing the tumor.  She told them that was not the man she married 15 years ago.  This drug managed my issue_ headaches post treatment but wow_ the price I paid in all the uncomfortableness and side effects.  This time_ I was on this drug for 11 days total and completed my last dose today and thankful I don't need to take it again.
