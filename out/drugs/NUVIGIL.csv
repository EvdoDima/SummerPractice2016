0, 4, sleep apnea_weight loss,didn't sleep first night taking full pill-took at about 1130 AM_ trying half now but want to go back up to full pill and early as possible in AM,Seems to be helping me stay awake during day. Don't work during the summer and combining it with better eating habits/dieting and gym workouts. Have chronic pain made worse by inactivity and weight gain and sleep apnea/ pre diabetes because of weight. Never even snored until weight gain. Ruined my joints from exercise addiction in 20's. Have not experienced the side effects others describe and hopefully wont. While it is helping to stay awake_ I think my doctor was using it as a psychological placebo to say I would lose weight. Hasn't reduced my hunger. I know I have the willpower to lose the weight_ just whether I will be able to mainting eating right/ exercising as a lifestyle with temptations and life getting in the way. Hope this helps someone out there. I have hit rock bottom with the pain_ weight_ addiction to pain meds(almost off completely now so am trying to figure out what is real and what is withdrawal pain). This med cant be any worse than the f-ed up docs getting me hooked on opioids. Stay strong_ believe in yourself_ find happiness_ and hold on to the ones you love. Peace.,M,54,3  days250mg 1X D,6/6/2016Email,Nuvigil
1, 5, EDS/Narcolepsy,I am a registered nurse and I have narcolepsy. When I started_ I knew I would have a day or two of hyper activity and sleeplessness. That is why I started on a Saturday. By Tuesday (day 4) I had a mild sore throat_ my jaws were clenched_ my neck muscles were very tight and sore_ the sides of my tongue hurt_ and I had developed an abnormal repetitive movement of my tongue against the roof of my mouth that was uncontrollable and constant. I stopped taking the drug for 3 days and let the symptoms resolve_ then started the drug again. After 2-3 days the symptoms would return. By the 3rd week_ I decided to cut the tablets in half then in half again and just took a quarter pill. I did this for about 5 days_ then increased to a half a pill for 5 days_ then up to my full dose. The symptoms did not return_ and I have been able to take the full dose for 10 months now.,As I said_ I had some odd neurogenic response to the drug that resolved as I let my body develop a tolerance and over come its sensitivity to the drug. I wanted to share my experience because now that I took the time to slowly let my body get used to this drug_ I am now able to take it without any problems. But so many people have these side effects and they just declare that they cannot tolerate the drug. But if you slowly introduce your body to these types of medications_ you can overcome many of the side effects. Then you can reap the benefits of a great drug that will really help improve the quality of your life.,M,43,10  months250 1X D,5/6/2016,Nuvigil
2, 5, Hypersomnia,mild headache_ sensitivity to caffeine_ increased desire to talk_ feeling happy_ fidgeting_ reduced appetite_ dry mouth,If I take Nuvigil daily for more than 3-4 days_ I have trouble falling asleep. I do get a slight headache after restarting the medication after a break. I recently weaned off caffeine_ and I have noticed the medication works even better without caffeine and with fewer negative side effects. I do not have the crash after it wears off. Not only has my appetite decreased_ but I crave healthier foods and drink more water. I sometimes forget words. Occasionally I notice a slight twitching. But I'm not sure if these are a side effect or just a coincidence. Nuvigil has changed my life! I am able to spend more time with my family and doing things I enjoy. I no longer struggle to make it through the day and am not exhausted. I am more active_ and this makes me a much nicer and healthier person.,F,41,4  years75mg 2X D,4/8/2016,Nuvigil
3, 5, idiopathic hypersomnia and sleep ap,Some anxiety and tension headaches and rise in blood pressure and some rapid heart beat,Been getting a 3 months supply of this medicine for 9.5 to 10 months now. I tried provigil beginning of last year. I was taking 400mgs but by 1 or 2pm the provigil would stop working and the massive headaches provigil gave me was when i had enough of that med and asked my sleep doctor if i could try nuvigil. Nuvigil worked better and it felt cleaner than provigil except for some minor side effects its been working out great don't feel tired and can get through my day and do my chores and run arans that i have to do. I take 250mgs of nuvigil but sometimes I only take half of my dosage it makes me feel enough energy through out the day. I can't believe I finally found a medication that actually works for me. I also take lorazepam for sleep. I take 1 MG of lorazepam and i fall asleep like a champ after a full day of being up. I would recommend this medication.,M,25,10  months250,2/17/2016Email,Nuvigil
4, 5, Chronic fatigue & shift work disord,Dry mouth_ thirsty_ occasionally slight headache,When I started taking Nuvigil_  I was also taking bupropion xl 300 strictly for fatigue.  I started on 75 mg_  and felt no effect.  I though it wasn't working at all.  My Dr.  Up the dose to 150 mg and when I took it_  I was getting sooooo sleepy_  I was dosing off at work_  having sleep micro burst while driving and all through the day.  So_ after a month of this problem_  I thought it would get better when I got over this side effect..  It didn't!!!  I was going to stop taking it_  but decided to try one more thing.  Since I was taking bupropion only for fatigue I decided to stop taking it cause that's what the Nuvigil is for.  NIGHT AND DAY!!!!  OMG!!!  I could not believe the difference.  I felt amazing after taking the Nuvigil.  I was felling tired and sleepy like I alway do_  even after taking bupropion.  I wasn't dozing off or wanting to nap all the time.  I wish I stopped the bupropion sooner.  Don't know if it was counter acting the Nuvigil or maybe just too much stimulater together that it was just making me sleepy.  I can definitely notice a huge difference now_  and can actually live my life and not sleep through it.,F,41,2  months150,2/11/2016Email,Nuvigil
5, 5, MS Fatigue,none,I was diagnosed with MS about 1990.  In January 1991_ I had a relapse that included mind-numbing_ body-stopping fatigue.  IIn 2010_ I was given a month's free prescription of 150 mg Nuvigil.  I was prescribed Provigil about 1997_ and continued to take it through about 2005_ although the effectiveness was negligible.  I left my work on disability in 2003 .  I was unemployable because of mind fog_ inability to concentrate_ organize or prioritize my work.  Even with Provigil!  I would fade_ noticeably_ between 1 pm & 2 pm.  All I could do was go to bed.On Nuvigil_ I lost the mind fog_ could think_ organize & evaluate my daily chores;  in short_  I felt almost as good as I was before 1991.  I had the stamina to exercise 3 times a week_ take up my participation in my church & choir_ and lost the 50 pounds that I had gained over  10 or 12 years of hellish fatigue.  In 2013_ my insurance refused to cover Nuvigil any more --  only Provigil.  I've been taking it even though it does no good. (just to prove a point and keep the insurance company from profiting by refusing - in spite of repeated appeals - to cover Nuvigil!  I know that is spiteful_ but I am very angry about anyone second-guessing my neurologist especially when I KNOW how effective it is for me.)  I am in Purgatory without Nuvigil_  I can't think_ be active_ be productive_ or have anything like a normal life.  The situation has put me in therapy for depression and in an effort to treat the depression,F,70,3  years150 mg 1X D,1/25/2016Email,Nuvigil
6, 3, Circadian rhythm disorder,Headaches_ excessive sleepiness_ numbness in face and hands_ difficulty breathing_ nausea_ jaw pain_ thirsty.,First couple days were okay. Despite side effects_ could tell the difference in my mind's ability to think more clearly. Did not sleep the first night_ have slept well for the rest of the week which was mind blowing to feel what it's like to really SLEEP!! But the pill makes me dizzy and groggy during the day. I've been in bed for days. I thought this was supposed to stimulate to keep me awake? I don't understand. It's been a week_ and I think I am going to stop taking it now_ and re-evaluate my options_ focusing on something to help me get good sleep_ and hoping my body will naturally give me the energy I need during the day if I can sleep well? Nuvigil is certainly not giving me energy. I like the effects it had on my mind the first few days_ but it was very short lived_ and the side effects are getting worse_ not better.,F,42,7  days150 mg 1X D,1/16/2016Email,Nuvigil

8, 4, Narcolepsy_ Excessive daytime sleep,Bad headache_ severe stomach pain_ irritability_ thoughts of suicide_ anxiety_ extreme tiredness when wear off_ nausea,I used to asleep driving_ but still somehow make it home. Also while standing & working_ I did things I wasn't aware I was doing(sleep walking). At first half a pill was helping_ then as the days go on I became more tolerate_ but would still only take other half when I feel it wearing off. I'm very irritable w my spouse_ have depression_ & for the headaches if I take 1 extra strength excedrin w the nuvigil_ it's ok. While at work it i let it all wear off before taking the other half_ the sleep walking is 10 times worst than before. My stomach pain is almost unbearable_ & hurts to the touch (not sure cause exactly). really helps tho.,F,21,4  weeks250,1/3/2016Email,Nuvigil

11, 2, Hypersomnia,Dehydration_ migraine headaches_ foggy brain_ irritability_ tiredness_ twitchy jerky muscles,Nuvigil is unpredictable for me. Some days it works ok. Others it's not very good.  I don't feel like I sleep very well at night. When it wears off_ sooner than they claim_ my eyes start to throb and burn with exhaustion. It'll the irritability doesn't wear off though so I'm left feeling tired and irritable and not refreshed when I wake up.,M,38,3  months250,12/3/2015,Nuvigil
12, 1, Narcolepsy,Bad rash_ blisters_ dry mouth_ sores in mouth_ swelling in throat_ irritability_ anger_ depression_ pain in my feet_ stomach issues_,I have been taking this drug for four years. It worked great in the first two. I always had dry mouth and darker urine. My doctor never showed concern over this. Over the past two years I've gone through a bunch of puzzling issues only to learn now what was the cause. I could not afford the medicine that last year or so. The result was taking less only when I felt extremely tired. I started getting bad blisters all over and itching.now that I know why_ I haven't a clue what to do. I told my doctor and all she wanted was to run more sleep disorder tests.,,46,1  days150mg,11/24/2015Email,Nuvigil
13, 3, Excessive daytime sleepiness_ADHD,Muscle tension_ loss of appetite_ hyperfocus_ migraines_ sleepiness_ dullness in personality.,When I first started taking Nuvigil 2hrs after daily dose I experience drowsiness and feelings of laziness.

14, 3, Mild Narcolepsy;TBI Hypersomnia; MS,Increased wakefulness; increased concentration; improvement in cognitive function; improved memory; Severe headaches; anxiety (which can sometimes lead to feelings of parnoia); intermittent tachycardia episodes; tremors; occasional OCD episodes; increase in pain level--and/or reduced effectiveness from narcotic pain meds; increased muscle spasms_ nausea,My review is identical for Nuvigil and Provigil: The medication is very effective for drowsiness and improved cognitive functioning; standard treatment for narcolepsy. However I am unable to maintain a daily schedule due to side effects: terrible headaches_ tremors_ negativity_ OCD_ and anxiety--Sometimes feeling watched or that people are working against me--even when I KNOW this isn't true. The combination makes me very irritable and not very nice to be around With daily use and higher doses I've experienced OCD episodes and panic attacks--probably triggered by physical anxiety_ which I've NEVER had before taking these meds.  It's terribly disappointing as hypersomia is ruining my life--NO one can get anything done sleeping. Worse_ when I take the nuvigil I either have to be selective as to when--so that my pain levels are relatively low--or up my narcotic due to increased pain and spasms.  Nuvigil & Provigil do what they are supposed to do_ but on balance the side effects are miserable_ even after years. With dr's permission I take them PRN--but they aren't as effective; So I live like Rip Van Winkle_ or suffer in pain and act like a nut_ pushing everyone away. I can't take anything sedating which means going without certain treatments.  Driving is out of the question.  I'm lucky that the narcotics don't sedate me (when sleeping 36 hrs I'm not taking anything let alone pain meds). Or eat. Or drink..Or let my poor dog out...FYI: Adderall and amphetamine were not helpful,F,59,  1X D,8/1/2015Email,Nuvigil
15, 4, idiopathic hypersomnia,breathing_ increased heart rate_ still have some daytime sleepiness,I have been diagnosed with Asthma and Idiopathic Hypersomnia right around the same time; the asthma was diagnosed first_ but I was also beginning to go through testing to find out why I was falling asleep all the time. Since I've been using Nuvigil I have noticed an increase in energy and wakefulness_ still seem to have some trouble driving longer than 20-30mins. But my biggest setback is it seems to be affecting my asthma more than what it says it should be. My doctor says I just need to continue doing breathing treatments and am on 2 different inhalers and a pill for it. I want to keep taking the Nuvigil but not sure how much longer I can handle the asthmatic symptoms. Oh and I took Provigil but it give me horrible headaches and they didn't give me any kind of energy!,F,32,10  months150 1X D,5/28/2015,Nuvigil
16, 3, idiopathic hypersomnia,"burning eyes_ breathing problems_ clogged ears_ a meshing of mental slowness an clarity_ ""I don't care"" attitude in a time of great stress_ muscle tension juxtaposed against heaviness",I have a history of depression and anxiety/OCD and haven taken 100 mg of Pristiq for years to combat these conditions. I started out on 150mg of Nuvigil which hardly touched the sleepiness. Since I upped to 200mg_ I have changed from a hyper type A to a slacker who wants to watch TV and tune out the major issues in my life. I have increased energy to be indifferent towards everything around me. This is VERY new and counter to my former OCD perfectionist personality.

19, 1, wife takes it,"My wife was prescribed this back in 2008 to counteract the daytime sleepiness from a opiate needed for lifelong_ chronic pain from a genetic disease.It immediately changed her personality. She saw everything negatively_ and blamed me for anything she did not like -- which was suddenly EVERYTHING. She opened secret bank accounts_ became VERY EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE_ etc._ etc. The ""doctor"" who prescribed it (a NEW Dr._ as per pain Dr. did not want to prescribe psychiatric drugs for any length of time) would not act on my information_ as required by NYS law -- he even called me back (against the law!) to say ""If you call me any more I may have to tell your wife.""

After being in 2 wrecks for falling asleep at the wheel_ I'm no longer scared to drive for longer than 30 min. 9-10 time I would fall asleep while driving. I am more alert and actually pay attention better. Over all I feel so much better on NuVigil.

I had to try Adderall_ then Provigil_ then the generic of Provigil_ each time the insurance wouldn't insure it even though they recommended some of them. Finally yesterday they insured it_ but by then I had taken so many different medication the 175mg didn't work anymore and they had to up it. I feel like my heart is beating 100 miles an hour and my arms are shaky. But I'm finally able to be alert and enjoy life a little better.

This does however go away.The second time I started these meds however_ I got terrible headaches_ and aches in the muscles of my neck. Mild upper stomach irritation was also present intermittently.,NuVigil make life seem like less of a torture. The side effects are minimal_ and seem to fade over time as you get used to the drug. I had to stop taking it for a few months when I swapped insurance_ as the new one didn't cover it initially. Being on it_ having to go without_ and getting back on it proves it's like night and day.

35, 5, Lupus fatigue,Therapeutic effect great.  I feel like a new person.  Actually can get through the day with energy and focus.Side effects :  not so great. I take my dose at 9 am by 8 pm and I can set my watch by it.  The itching starts and it is significant.  A generic Zyrtec usually takes care of this but sometimes I have to take two.   Arms and eyelids itch the most but generally its all over. No rash.   About mid day I get the heart flutters and a split second of panic but it goes away quickly.  It is worth it to me because now I can LIVE and not lay in the bed all the time.  Nuvigil is great for me with manageable side effects.  Thank you to the nurse who gave me a sample I would have never known about this.  Top rheumatologist never recommended it.  I don't know why?  Sometimes specialist are so protocol driven that I think they forget about innovation and critical thinking.  Lupus fatigue can't make it through the day?  Hang in there is what you get.  My PCP rx for me when I told him how great I felt.  Thank you for docs who a willing to listen and try something off label with out fear.

36, 4, Sleep Apnea,The canker sores are the worst side effects for me personally.  I have not experienced the tension and anxiety others have reported.  However I do take 1 mg of Klonepin 3 x a day so that is probably why. For those of you who did ok on modafinal or generic Provigil ask to go back on it. I have a hard time believing that an insurance company wouldn't rather cover a generic. Nuvigil gives me energy and allows me to live a normal life. My sleep apnea left me tired and exhausted halfway through my day. If it weren't for the canker sores on my tongue and cheeks it would rank as one of the best meds I have ever taken.  I should say it does still rank among the top 3 as it does what it was intended to do. The canker sores are a painful inconvenience but not enough to make me stop taking it.,,M,52,6  months250 MG,4/6/2014Email,Nuvigil

For me headache_ tinnitus_ complete loss of appetite_ muscle soreness in neck area_ sinusitis_ allergies_ hay fever_ really really bad nausea_ brain fog and tension.,I had used modafinil with relatively good results_ but was forced to use this drug as a replacement.  This drug is a nightmare; really no good effects and if you read the majority of the reviews you will see so much similarities in their negative experiences.  It leaves you in the majority of the day with this tenseness_ head-achy_ nauseous feeling that is just unpleasant.  Not smooth at all.

Sometimes I still fall asleep when I take it. However_ for the most part I feel like I come out of the fog and process thoughts again. The biggest downside is the muscle pain.

So far_ this has been a great boost. The first day I took it in the afternoon when I received a sample. That was a mistake. I didn't sleep a wink until after the next morning and skipped it the next day. The days following_ I took 150 mg and have not felt the need to sleep during the day_ which has been great. But_ it also adds productivity_ alertness_ and humor to the mix with few side effects. When I take it in the morning_ it's fine to sleep at night_ at a normal time. When I don't sleep enough the prior night_ I can nap from being tired. From what I've seen is that if you're taking this legitimately and for the same thing I take it for (excessive sleepiness) and without other drugs_ it will work wonders. But_ the depression and other terrible side effects only happen if you add in all the caffeine and other drugs. While I'm using Nuvigil_ I am more aware of my chest cavity_ almost like my lungs and heart are pushing harder on my rib cage. It's not really a nuisance; just an awareness. It's not palpitations either_ whereas I'm not skipping beats. That only lasts for a few days at first. I am very motivated during the day_ my speech is more articulate and I find it easier to smile.,M,37,4  months150 MG 1X D,12/4/2013EmailHistory,Nuvigil
41, 5, Hypersomnia,I really cannot identify any that are negative,I would have to say that taking this medication has allowed me to operate at a regular everyday level. Not only has it solved my hypersomnia (no reason yet known for the onset) but it has allowed me to participate in life - before I would be so overwhelmed with lights_ noise_ and crowds that I felt myself to be in a blender spinning as if I was in a vertical centrifuge. I am now organized in thought_ speech_ and action. And I am awake_ and I am able to sleep better at the end of the day.,F,45,1  months 1X D,11/11/2013,Nuvigil
42, 5, Never hit REM cycle!!,I have not had any adverse side effects on the nuvigil except for fact that I start to lose weight immediately it wipes out my appetite I do make sure to keep hydrated I like it . because other than that my other .alternative is I would be tracking from never hitting that one cycle.  I have never experienced adverse  side effects from the medication for very safe taking it. With MS_ fibromyalgia_ and Chronic fatigue syndrome sometimes you don't know what's acting out it's hard to identify however the nuvigil helps _ But it does it really really does so that I can be awake and alert taking care my family's ideal seven-year-old daughter. Good luck to anyone out there who is going through what I'm going through wish you the best Gina!!!,,F,43,1  days150,11/3/2013Email,Nuvigil
43, 2, sleep apnea and fatigue,I don't feel it is working well. I am very tired and fatigued most the time.  My arms and legs and sometimes head/neck muscles feel weak.  It is strange.  I took Nuvigil before whenever I could get free samples or free month supply from pharmaceutical company.  My current insurance covers it at $60 mo.  I was taking generic Nuvigil from India for several years due to the huge cost savings.  It worked great. Maybe I will go back to that.,,F,59,30  days150 mg 1X D,8/30/2013Email,Nuvigil
44, 5, Narcolepsy,Anxiety_ immediate need to delicate.,It's excellent. I don't take it every day. My excessive sleepiness I help counteract by hitting the gym and doing cardio around 1 pm. I counteract the short-term anxiety with small dose as needed of diazepam or Valium. On weekends I just take a nap if needed. It helps. To those who say they took days to get Nugivil out of their system_ pharmacology of nyvigil is that it's out in 24 hours. No residual which is why I'm able to take as needed. No build up or withdrawal required. My dose is achieved by cutting pill in half. So.... It's not the drug. Go get some exercise and sweat out the toxins from our insane food supply.,F,41,1  years125 1X D,3/31/2013,Nuvigil

46, 4, Profound narcolepsy,Awful dry mouth_ sore mouth_ stiff jaw and mouth_ rash on both eyelids and around eyes that makes it look like I have red eye shadow on,I have had narcolepsy my whole life and never knew what was wrong with me. I could never stay awake in school_ college classes or at work. I would fight to stay awake within minutes of sitting down at a meeting. I finally had a sleep study on the recommendation of a physician friend_ where narcolepsy was diagnosed. I initially took Provigil but my insurance made me switch to Nuvigil. I like the effect of both and have no trouble sleeping at night  at all. The drugs have truly changed my life and for that I am thankful. However_ 4 months after switching to Nuvigil_ I developed such severe dry mouth I was convinced I had Sjogren's disease. All testing for that was negative. Then I developed a red discoloration around my eyes and eyelids_ it looks like I am wearing red eye shadow.My eyes are so dry_ also.  I actually thought I was allergic to my eye makeup and so stopped using any!!After reading about side effects others have described I realize these must be Nuvigil side effects. I had no side effectsat all  on Provigil_ am considering asking my MD to change me back. I am thankful to have found this website.,F,57,9  months250 mg 1X D,2/18/2013Email,Nuvigil
47, 1, Hypersomnia,nausea_ no appetite_ headache_ jaw clenching_ dizziness_ jittery_ dry mouth_ sweating_ body aches_ insomnia,I will preface this by saying that I am very sensitive to drugs and have had very similar side effects from anti depressants. I took 1 pill (150mg). That was yesterday morning. Tonight_ I am still suffering the side effects. First of all_ I didn't feel any increase in energy. I still felt very tired all day. The first noticeable side effect is no appetite_ I mean NONE whatsoever. I literally ate nothing at all yesterday. I tried to eat a salad and couldn't do it. And if it weren't for the other side effects_ I'd probably continue taking it for that alone. Next was nausea and dizziness. I am still super nauseous_ almost 36 hours later. I was jittery and felt like my nerves were shot. My head was very cloudy. Several hours later the headache kicked in and jaw clenching. By night time_ I was having obsessive and paranoid thoughts (minor but annoying). I was sweating.  Dry mouth was noticeable but not a big deal_ I drank a sweet tea and that was all I consumed the entire day. Basically I feel like I have the flu x 10. I went to bed 11 hours after taking it_ feeling very tired. I literally laid in bed ALL NIGHT LONG_ from 10pm to 9am. If I slept at all it was only a few short bursts after 6am. It was absolute torture. I was able to eat today but still no energy_ very sick feeling_ very nauseous_ headache_ and jaw clenching. Plus added body aches. I still feel like I have the flu and it has been almost 36 hours.,F,32,1  days150 1X D,2/10/2013,Nuvigil

49, 3, Narcolepsy,Sore neck and shoulders. Irritability. Fogginess.,"I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy about 2 years ago. I am taking 150mg of Nuvigil in morning with 30mg of Adderall XR and 40mg of Prozac. Throughout the day_ I take 2 additional 20mg of Adderall. Nuvigil was added to my list 2 weeks ago. Taking Nuvigil does keep me awake and focused as it's supposed to_ but I feel like there are some negative side effects that come with it. I constantly feel irritated or unsatisfied. I feel very sore in my neck and shoulders all the time_ and I also feel like I have bruises all over my legs even though there are not ""bruised spots.""",F,26,2  weeks150MG 1X D,2/2/2013Email,Nuvigil
50, 5, Obstructive sleep apnea,Dry mouth_ which is improving. This drug changed my life. I was sleeping 12 hours per day even though I used a C-pap. From the first day I have been alert and clear headed. I have also lost my appetite for sweets and have lost 12 pounds which is a good thing. I sleep soundly. I wonder if I was self medicating with sugar to increase my energy level? I have renewed interest I things I haven't done for a long time. I haven't felt this good in 30 years.,,F,59,1  months150,12/6/2012Email,Nuvigil

52, 5, psoriatic spondylitis/ parkinsons p,Extreme rebound crash if I go with out dose longer than 2 days it gradually gets worse the more days without. Hyposomnia. Dry mouth. Jitter like tremors in the AM as I am waking. Expec tant apprehension and acute memory recall with hyper atentivness... I have severe sensory nerve damage as well as cataplexy attacks.  I also have fused facet joints in spine. I have a fused sternum. My si joints are fused solid.  Now my hip are over 80% non functional. I also have 60% tendon inclusion in my legs and shoulders.  I walk but very limited. If I don't drop seize from cataplexy I jerk out then drop from the parkinsons. I have very little flexability do posture change is not easy.  NUVIGIL is the only medication that I don't drop as much on. I get so exhausted and fast. I will take the side effects because they are better then the other. I was on provigial and found it can cause an autoimmune. Skin condition Nuvigil is less sensitive that way.  But they are the same medication somewhat so it may be the same issue,,M,41,2  months500 daily,10/28/2012Email,Nuvigil

56, 3, Somnolence (secondary to OSA),Burning skin_ allergic blisters on extremities that take a while to go away and leave Nasty scars (I cut my dose in-half and these subsided FYI---but you probably should stop this med if this happens btw)_ decreased skin quality (acne)_ decreased/absent libido_ increased allergies/itchiness_ muscle spasms_ dry mouth/dry eyes_ mucous gland sensitivity_ arthritis activation_ sharp joint/muscle pains_ blood circulation problems from swelling aka hypersensitivity vasculitis (be very careful!)_ jaw clenching_ hyper-aware attentiveness to EVERYTHING including minor/trivial things (your family/close friends will not like this I promise you)_ fear from side effects worsening into delayed hypersensitivity reaction or Stevens-Johnson syndrome_ not to mention the psychological effect of the drug which a majority of people just can't handle because it can get pretty intense.,"The way this medication works is not entirely understood_ but it effectively increases your body's histamine levels (the opposite effect of anti-histamines).  This is a really messy biological hack of a way to get people to stay awake during the day.  You will be shocked and scared by all the side effects_ which I have listed above (and I really experienced them all).  You should only take this medication if you've been down the road of taking stimulants in the past and you've come to the conclusion that you cannot do it (long-term) again.  There are much ""cleaner"" ways to get a boost (Concerta)_ which do not cause you body to go haywire like this medication does.  DO NOT take any other stimulants while on this medication---caffeine or any other type of 'upper'...you will have a bad experience if you do.  Also- do not take this medication after say 9 AM because you will not be able to fall asleep at a normal time.  As for the medication it works the whole day evenly (which is great)_ but you cannot drink alcohol EVER if you take it (seriously).  Be very careful when taking this medication.  IF it is something that you MUST take I recommend taking it no more than once or twice a week_ spacing it out to both monitor the effects and also give you body time to adjust back to normal.  Try Rosavin by Ameriden or Mind Body Spirit Rhodiola Rosea if you are looking for nature's cure for chronic tiredness/fatigue people.  Thanks for sharing your experiences everyone!

57, 5, idiopathic hypersomnia,excessive talking_ excitability,Began Nuvigil due to strong sleepiness during the day.  Sleep study was conducted which led to prescription.  Would fall asleep anywhere and any part of the day_ including while standing if I were leaning against a wall_ sitting across from someone talking for an extended period of time_ bathroom stalls_ watching tv_ etc.  This drug has made me feel more alert and not sleepy during the day.  For as long as I can remember (I'm 44)_ I never knew what it was like to not be extremely SLEEPY and walking around half dazed bec I was.Love Nuvigil; however_ am experiencing extreme excitement and continuous talking.  I CANT shut up!!  Just tooooo bubbly as I was told by someone today.  It's weird bec it's an abnormal happiness...too giddy and out of control!Will see about halfing my dosage_ but in the meantime_ I feel great!,F,44,28  days150 mg 1X D,8/10/2012,Nuvigil

I take it about one to three times per week. It really helps my stamina -- my muscles still get tired and my balance is off_ but I don't have the feeling of increased gravity and soul-numbing fatigue that I usually get. I feel much more clear-headed_ which I love_ and just a tiny bit ""jacked up_"" which I don't like but am willing to put up with for the good effects.",F,65,30  days250 mg 1X O,7/31/2012Email,Nuvigil
