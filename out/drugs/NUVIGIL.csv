0, 4, sleep apnea_weight loss,didn't sleep first night taking full pill-took at about 1130 AM_ trying half now but want to go back up to full pill and early as possible in AM,Seems to be helping me stay awake during day. Don't work during the summer and combining it with better eating habits/dieting and gym workouts. Have chronic pain made worse by inactivity and weight gain and sleep apnea/ pre diabetes because of weight. Never even snored until weight gain. Ruined my joints from exercise addiction in 20's. Have not experienced the side effects others describe and hopefully wont. While it is helping to stay awake_ I think my doctor was using it as a psychological placebo to say I would lose weight. Hasn't reduced my hunger. I know I have the willpower to lose the weight_ just whether I will be able to mainting eating right/ exercising as a lifestyle with temptations and life getting in the way. Hope this helps someone out there. I have hit rock bottom with the pain_ weight_ addiction to pain meds(almost off completely now so am trying to figure out what is real and what is withdrawal pain). This med cant be any worse than the f-ed up docs getting me hooked on opioids. Stay strong_ believe in yourself_ find happiness_ and hold on to the ones you love. Peace.,M,54,3  days250mg 1X D,6/6/2016Email,Nuvigil
1, 5, EDS/Narcolepsy,I am a registered nurse and I have narcolepsy. When I started_ I knew I would have a day or two of hyper activity and sleeplessness. That is why I started on a Saturday. By Tuesday (day 4) I had a mild sore throat_ my jaws were clenched_ my neck muscles were very tight and sore_ the sides of my tongue hurt_ and I had developed an abnormal repetitive movement of my tongue against the roof of my mouth that was uncontrollable and constant. I stopped taking the drug for 3 days and let the symptoms resolve_ then started the drug again. After 2-3 days the symptoms would return. By the 3rd week_ I decided to cut the tablets in half then in half again and just took a quarter pill. I did this for about 5 days_ then increased to a half a pill for 5 days_ then up to my full dose. The symptoms did not return_ and I have been able to take the full dose for 10 months now.,As I said_ I had some odd neurogenic response to the drug that resolved as I let my body develop a tolerance and over come its sensitivity to the drug. I wanted to share my experience because now that I took the time to slowly let my body get used to this drug_ I am now able to take it without any problems. But so many people have these side effects and they just declare that they cannot tolerate the drug. But if you slowly introduce your body to these types of medications_ you can overcome many of the side effects. Then you can reap the benefits of a great drug that will really help improve the quality of your life.,M,43,10  months250 1X D,5/6/2016,Nuvigil
2, 5, Hypersomnia,mild headache_ sensitivity to caffeine_ increased desire to talk_ feeling happy_ fidgeting_ reduced appetite_ dry mouth,If I take Nuvigil daily for more than 3-4 days_ I have trouble falling asleep. I do get a slight headache after restarting the medication after a break. I recently weaned off caffeine_ and I have noticed the medication works even better without caffeine and with fewer negative side effects. I do not have the crash after it wears off. Not only has my appetite decreased_ but I crave healthier foods and drink more water. I sometimes forget words. Occasionally I notice a slight twitching. But I'm not sure if these are a side effect or just a coincidence. Nuvigil has changed my life! I am able to spend more time with my family and doing things I enjoy. I no longer struggle to make it through the day and am not exhausted. I am more active_ and this makes me a much nicer and healthier person.,F,41,4  years75mg 2X D,4/8/2016,Nuvigil
3, 5, idiopathic hypersomnia and sleep ap,Some anxiety and tension headaches and rise in blood pressure and some rapid heart beat,Been getting a 3 months supply of this medicine for 9.5 to 10 months now. I tried provigil beginning of last year. I was taking 400mgs but by 1 or 2pm the provigil would stop working and the massive headaches provigil gave me was when i had enough of that med and asked my sleep doctor if i could try nuvigil. Nuvigil worked better and it felt cleaner than provigil except for some minor side effects its been working out great don't feel tired and can get through my day and do my chores and run arans that i have to do. I take 250mgs of nuvigil but sometimes I only take half of my dosage it makes me feel enough energy through out the day. I can't believe I finally found a medication that actually works for me. I also take lorazepam for sleep. I take 1 MG of lorazepam and i fall asleep like a champ after a full day of being up. I would recommend this medication.,M,25,10  months250,2/17/2016Email,Nuvigil
4, 5, Chronic fatigue & shift work disord,Dry mouth_ thirsty_ occasionally slight headache,When I started taking Nuvigil_  I was also taking bupropion xl 300 strictly for fatigue.  I started on 75 mg_  and felt no effect.  I though it wasn't working at all.  My Dr.  Up the dose to 150 mg and when I took it_  I was getting sooooo sleepy_  I was dosing off at work_  having sleep micro burst while driving and all through the day.  So_ after a month of this problem_  I thought it would get better when I got over this side effect..  It didn't!!!  I was going to stop taking it_  but decided to try one more thing.  Since I was taking bupropion only for fatigue I decided to stop taking it cause that's what the Nuvigil is for.  NIGHT AND DAY!!!!  OMG!!!  I could not believe the difference.  I felt amazing after taking the Nuvigil.  I was felling tired and sleepy like I alway do_  even after taking bupropion.  I wasn't dozing off or wanting to nap all the time.  I wish I stopped the bupropion sooner.  Don't know if it was counter acting the Nuvigil or maybe just too much stimulater together that it was just making me sleepy.  I can definitely notice a huge difference now_  and can actually live my life and not sleep through it.,F,41,2  months150,2/11/2016Email,Nuvigil
5, 5, MS Fatigue,none,I was diagnosed with MS about 1990.  In January 1991_ I had a relapse that included mind-numbing_ body-stopping fatigue.  IIn 2010_ I was given a month's free prescription of 150 mg Nuvigil.  I was prescribed Provigil about 1997_ and continued to take it through about 2005_ although the effectiveness was negligible.  I left my work on disability in 2003 .  I was unemployable because of mind fog_ inability to concentrate_ organize or prioritize my work.  Even with Provigil!  I would fade_ noticeably_ between 1 pm & 2 pm.  All I could do was go to bed.On Nuvigil_ I lost the mind fog_ could think_ organize & evaluate my daily chores;  in short_  I felt almost as good as I was before 1991.  I had the stamina to exercise 3 times a week_ take up my participation in my church & choir_ and lost the 50 pounds that I had gained over  10 or 12 years of hellish fatigue.  In 2013_ my insurance refused to cover Nuvigil any more --  only Provigil.  I've been taking it even though it does no good. (just to prove a point and keep the insurance company from profiting by refusing - in spite of repeated appeals - to cover Nuvigil!  I know that is spiteful_ but I am very angry about anyone second-guessing my neurologist especially when I KNOW how effective it is for me.)  I am in Purgatory without Nuvigil_  I can't think_ be active_ be productive_ or have anything like a normal life.  The situation has put me in therapy for depression and in an effort to treat the depression,F,70,3  years150 mg 1X D,1/25/2016Email,Nuvigil
6, 3, Circadian rhythm disorder,Headaches_ excessive sleepiness_ numbness in face and hands_ difficulty breathing_ nausea_ jaw pain_ thirsty.,First couple days were okay. Despite side effects_ could tell the difference in my mind's ability to think more clearly. Did not sleep the first night_ have slept well for the rest of the week which was mind blowing to feel what it's like to really SLEEP!! But the pill makes me dizzy and groggy during the day. I've been in bed for days. I thought this was supposed to stimulate to keep me awake? I don't understand. It's been a week_ and I think I am going to stop taking it now_ and re-evaluate my options_ focusing on something to help me get good sleep_ and hoping my body will naturally give me the energy I need during the day if I can sleep well? Nuvigil is certainly not giving me energy. I like the effects it had on my mind the first few days_ but it was very short lived_ and the side effects are getting worse_ not better.,F,42,7  days150 mg 1X D,1/16/2016Email,Nuvigil

8, 4, Narcolepsy_ Excessive daytime sleep,Bad headache_ severe stomach pain_ irritability_ thoughts of suicide_ anxiety_ extreme tiredness when wear off_ nausea,I used to asleep driving_ but still somehow make it home. Also while standing & working_ I did things I wasn't aware I was doing(sleep walking). At first half a pill was helping_ then as the days go on I became more tolerate_ but would still only take other half when I feel it wearing off. I'm very irritable w my spouse_ have depression_ & for the headaches if I take 1 extra strength excedrin w the nuvigil_ it's ok. While at work it i let it all wear off before taking the other half_ the sleep walking is 10 times worst than before. My stomach pain is almost unbearable_ & hurts to the touch (not sure cause exactly). really helps tho.,F,21,4  weeks250,1/3/2016Email,Nuvigil

11, 2, Hypersomnia,Dehydration_ migraine headaches_ foggy brain_ irritability_ tiredness_ twitchy jerky muscles,Nuvigil is unpredictable for me. Some days it works ok. Others it's not very good.  I don't feel like I sleep very well at night. When it wears off_ sooner than they claim_ my eyes start to throb and burn with exhaustion. It'll the irritability doesn't wear off though so I'm left feeling tired and irritable and not refreshed when I wake up.,M,38,3  months250,12/3/2015,Nuvigil
12, 1, Narcolepsy,Bad rash_ blisters_ dry mouth_ sores in mouth_ swelling in throat_ irritability_ anger_ depression_ pain in my feet_ stomach issues_,I have been taking this drug for four years. It worked great in the first two. I always had dry mouth and darker urine. My doctor never showed concern over this. Over the past two years I've gone through a bunch of puzzling issues only to learn now what was the cause. I could not afford the medicine that last year or so. The result was taking less only when I felt extremely tired. I started getting bad blisters all over and itching.now that I know why_ I haven't a clue what to do. I told my doctor and all she wanted was to run more sleep disorder tests.,,46,1  days150mg,11/24/2015Email,Nuvigil
13, 3, Excessive daytime sleepiness_ADHD,Muscle tension_ loss of appetite_ hyperfocus_ migraines_ sleepiness_ dullness in personality.,When I first started taking Nuvigil 2hrs after daily dose I experience drowsiness and feelings of laziness.

14, 3, Mild Narcolepsy;TBI Hypersomnia; MS,Increased wakefulness; increased concentration; improvement in cognitive function; improved memory; Severe headaches; anxiety (which can sometimes lead to feelings of parnoia); intermittent tachycardia episodes; tremors; occasional OCD episodes; increase in pain level--and/or reduced effectiveness from narcotic pain meds; increased muscle spasms_ nausea,My review is identical for Nuvigil and Provigil: The medication is very effective for drowsiness and improved cognitive functioning; standard treatment for narcolepsy. However I am unable to maintain a daily schedule due to side effects: terrible headaches_ tremors_ negativity_ OCD_ and anxiety--Sometimes feeling watched or that people are working against me--even when I KNOW this isn't true. The combination makes me very irritable and not very nice to be around With daily use and higher doses I've experienced OCD episodes and panic attacks--probably triggered by physical anxiety_ which I've NEVER had before taking these meds.  It's terribly disappointing as hypersomia is ruining my life--NO one can get anything done sleeping. Worse_ when I take the nuvigil I either have to be selective as to when--so that my pain levels are relatively low--or up my narcotic due to increased pain and spasms.  Nuvigil & Provigil do what they are supposed to do_ but on balance the side effects are miserable_ even after years. With dr's permission I take them PRN--but they aren't as effective; So I live like Rip Van Winkle_ or suffer in pain and act like a nut_ pushing everyone away. I can't take anything sedating which means going without certain treatments.  Driving is out of the question.  I'm lucky that the narcotics don't sedate me (when sleeping 36 hrs I'm not taking anything let alone pain meds). Or eat. Or drink..Or let my poor dog out...FYI: Adderall and amphetamine were not helpful,F,59,  1X D,8/1/2015Email,Nuvigil
15, 4, idiopathic hypersomnia,breathing_ increased heart rate_ still have some daytime sleepiness,I have been diagnosed with Asthma and Idiopathic Hypersomnia right around the same time; the asthma was diagnosed first_ but I was also beginning to go through testing to find out why I was falling asleep all the time. Since I've been using Nuvigil I have noticed an increase in energy and wakefulness_ still seem to have some trouble driving longer than 20-30mins. But my biggest setback is it seems to be affecting my asthma more than what it says it should be. My doctor says I just need to continue doing breathing treatments and am on 2 different inhalers and a pill for it. I want to keep taking the Nuvigil but not sure how much longer I can handle the asthmatic symptoms. Oh and I took Provigil but it give me horrible headaches and they didn't give me any kind of energy!,F,32,10  months150 1X D,5/28/2015,Nuvigil
16, 3, idiopathic hypersomnia,"burning eyes_ breathing problems_ clogged ears_ a meshing of mental slowness an clarity_ ""I don't care"" attitude in a time of great stress_ muscle tension juxtaposed against heaviness",I have a history of depression and anxiety/OCD and haven taken 100 mg of Pristiq for years to combat these conditions. I started out on 150mg of Nuvigil which hardly touched the sleepiness. Since I upped to 200mg_ I have changed from a hyper type A to a slacker who wants to watch TV and tune out the major issues in my life. I have increased energy to be indifferent towards everything around me. This is VERY new and counter to my former OCD perfectionist personality.

19, 1, wife takes it,"My wife was prescribed this back in 2008 to counteract the daytime sleepiness from a opiate needed for lifelong_ chronic pain from a genetic disease.It immediately changed her personality. She saw everything negatively_ and blamed me for anything she did not like -- which was suddenly EVERYTHING. She opened secret bank accounts_ became VERY EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE_ etc._ etc. The ""doctor"" who prescribed it (a NEW Dr._ as per pain Dr. did not want to prescribe psychiatric drugs for any length of time) would not act on my information_ as required by NYS law -- he even called me back (against the law!) to say ""If you call me any more I may have to tell your wife.""

After being in 2 wrecks for falling asleep at the wheel_ I'm no longer scared to drive for longer than 30 min. 9-10 time I would fall asleep while driving. I am more alert and actually pay attention better. Over all I feel so much better on NuVigil.

I had to try Adderall_ then Provigil_ then the generic of Provigil_ each time the insurance wouldn't insure it even though they recommended some of them. Finally yesterday they insured it_ but by then I had taken so many different medication the 175mg didn't work anymore and they had to up it. I feel like my heart is beating 100 miles an hour and my arms are shaky. But I'm finally able to be alert and enjoy life a little better.

This does however go away.The second time I started these meds however_ I got terrible headaches_ and aches in the muscles of my neck. Mild upper stomach irritation was also present intermittently.,NuVigil make life seem like less of a torture. The side effects are minimal_ and seem to fade over time as you get used to the drug. I had to stop taking it for a few months when I swapped insurance_ as the new one didn't cover it initially. Being on it_ having to go without_ and getting back on it proves it's like night and day.

35, 5, Lupus fatigue,Therapeutic effect great.  I feel like a new person.  Actually can get through the day with energy and focus.Side effects :  not so great. I take my dose at 9 am by 8 pm and I can set my watch by it.  The itching starts and it is significant.  A generic Zyrtec usually takes care of this but sometimes I have to take two.   Arms and eyelids itch the most but generally its all over. No rash.   About mid day I get the heart flutters and a split second of panic but it goes away quickly.  It is worth it to me because now I can LIVE and not lay in the bed all the time.  Nuvigil is great for me with manageable side effects.  Thank you to the nurse who gave me a sample I would have never known about this.  Top rheumatologist never recommended it.  I don't know why?  Sometimes specialist are so protocol driven that I think they forget about innovation and critical thinking.  Lupus fatigue can't make it through the day?  Hang in there is what you get.  My PCP rx for me when I told him how great I felt.  Thank you for docs who a willing to listen and try something off label with out fear.

36, 4, Sleep Apnea,The canker sores are the worst side effects for me personally.  I have not experienced the tension and anxiety others have reported.  However I do take 1 mg of Klonepin 3 x a day so that is probably why. For those of you who did ok on modafinal or generic Provigil ask to go back on it. I have a hard time believing that an insurance company wouldn't rather cover a generic. Nuvigil gives me energy and allows me to live a normal life. My sleep apnea left me tired and exhausted halfway through my day. If it weren't for the canker sores on my tongue and cheeks it would rank as one of the best meds I have ever taken.  I should say it does still rank among the top 3 as it does what it was intended to do. The canker sores are a painful inconvenience but not enough to make me stop taking it.,,M,52,6  months250 MG,4/6/2014Email,Nuvigil

For me headache_ tinnitus_ complete loss of appetite_ muscle soreness in neck area_ sinusitis_ allergies_ hay fever_ really really bad nausea_ brain fog and tension.,I had used modafinil with relatively good results_ but was forced to use this drug as a replacement.  This drug is a nightmare; really no good effects and if you read the majority of the reviews you will see so much similarities in their negative experiences.  It leaves you in the majority of the day with this tenseness_ head-achy_ nauseous feeling that is just unpleasant.  Not smooth at all.

Sometimes I still fall asleep when I take it. However_ for the most part I feel like I come out of the fog and process thoughts again. The biggest downside is the muscle pain.

So far_ this has been a great boost. The first day I took it in the afternoon when I received a sample. That was a mistake. I didn't sleep a wink until after the next morning and skipped it the next day. The days following_ I took 150 mg and have not felt the need to sleep during the day_ which has been great. But_ it also adds productivity_ alertness_ and humor to the mix with few side effects. When I take it in the morning_ it's fine to sleep at night_ at a normal time. When I don't sleep enough the prior night_ I can nap from being tired. From what I've seen is that if you're taking this legitimately and for the same thing I take it for (excessive sleepiness) and without other drugs_ it will work wonders. But_ the depression and other terrible side effects only happen if you add in all the caffeine and other drugs. While I'm using Nuvigil_ I am more aware of my chest cavity_ almost like my lungs and heart are pushing harder on my rib cage. It's not really a nuisance; just an awareness. It's not palpitations either_ whereas I'm not skipping beats. That only lasts for a few days at first. I am very motivated during the day_ my speech is more articulate and I find it easier to smile.,M,37,4  months150 MG 1X D,12/4/2013EmailHistory,Nuvigil
41, 5, Hypersomnia,I really cannot identify any that are negative,I would have to say that taking this medication has allowed me to operate at a regular everyday level. Not only has it solved my hypersomnia (no reason yet known for the onset) but it has allowed me to participate in life - before I would be so overwhelmed with lights_ noise_ and crowds that I felt myself to be in a blender spinning as if I was in a vertical centrifuge. I am now organized in thought_ speech_ and action. And I am awake_ and I am able to sleep better at the end of the day.,F,45,1  months 1X D,11/11/2013,Nuvigil

I have never experienced adverse  side effects from the medication for very safe taking it. With MS_ fibromyalgia_ and Chronic fatigue syndrome sometimes you don't know what's acting out it's hard to identify however the nuvigil helps _ But it does it really really does so that I can be awake and alert taking care my family's ideal seven-year-old daughter.

I took Nuvigil before whenever I could get free samples or free month supply from pharmaceutical company.  My current insurance covers it at $60 mo.

I counteract the short-term anxiety with small dose as needed of diazepam or Valium. On weekends I just take a nap if needed. It helps. To those who say they took days to get Nugivil out of their system_ pharmacology of nyvigil is that it's out in 24 hours. No residual which is why I'm able to take as needed. No build up or withdrawal required. My dose is achieved by cutting pill in half. So.... It's not the drug.

46, 4, Profound narcolepsy,Awful dry mouth_ sore mouth_ stiff jaw and mouth_ rash on both eyelids and around eyes that makes it look like I have red eye shadow on,I have had narcolepsy my whole life and never knew what was wrong with me. I could never stay awake in school_ college classes or at work. I would fight to stay awake within minutes of sitting down at a meeting. I finally had a sleep study on the recommendation of a physician friend_ where narcolepsy was diagnosed. I initially took Provigil but my insurance made me switch to Nuvigil. I like the effect of both and have no trouble sleeping at night  at all. The drugs have truly changed my life and for that I am thankful. However_ 4 months after switching to Nuvigil_ I developed such severe dry mouth I was convinced I had Sjogren's disease. All testing for that was negative. Then I developed a red discoloration around my eyes and eyelids_ it looks like I am wearing red eye shadow.My eyes are so dry_ also.  I actually thought I was allergic to my eye makeup and so stopped using any!!After reading about side effects others have described I realize these must be Nuvigil side effects.

47, 1, Hypersomnia,nausea_ no appetite_ headache_ jaw clenching_ dizziness_ jittery_ dry mouth_ sweating_ body aches_ insomnia,I will preface this by saying that I am very sensitive to drugs and have had very similar side effects from anti depressants. I took 1 pill (150mg). That was yesterday morning. Tonight_ I am still suffering the side effects. First of all_ I didn't feel any increase in energy. I still felt very tired all day. The first noticeable side effect is no appetite_ I mean NONE whatsoever. I literally ate nothing at all yesterday. I tried to eat a salad and couldn't do it. And if it weren't for the other side effects_ I'd probably continue taking it for that alone. Next was nausea and dizziness. I am still super nauseous_ almost 36 hours later. I was jittery and felt like my nerves were shot. My head was very cloudy. Several hours later the headache kicked in and jaw clenching. By night time_ I was having obsessive and paranoid thoughts (minor but annoying). I was sweating.  Dry mouth was noticeable but not a big deal_ I drank a sweet tea and that was all I consumed the entire day. Basically I feel like I have the flu x 10. I went to bed 11 hours after taking it_ feeling very tired. I literally laid in bed ALL NIGHT LONG_ from 10pm to 9am. If I slept at all it was only a few short bursts after 6am. It was absolute torture. I was able to eat today but still no energy_ very sick feeling_ very nauseous_ headache_ and jaw clenching. Plus added body aches. I still feel like I have the flu and it has been almost 36 hours.,F,32,1  days150 1X D,2/10/2013,Nuvigil

This is a really messy biological hack of a way to get people to stay awake during the day.  You will be shocked and scared by all the side effects_ which I have listed above (and I really experienced them all).  You should only take this medication if you've been down the road of taking stimulants in the past and you've come to the conclusion that you cannot do it (long-term) again.  There are much ""cleaner"" ways to get a boost (Concerta)_ which do not cause you body to go haywire like this medication does.  DO NOT take any other stimulants while on this medication---caffeine or any other type of 'upper'...you will have a bad experience if you do.  Also- do not take this medication after say 9 AM because you will not be able to fall asleep at a normal time.  As for the medication it works the whole day evenly (which is great)_ but you cannot drink alcohol EVER if you take it (seriously).  Be very careful when taking this medication.  IF it is something that you MUST take I recommend taking it no more than once or twice a week_ spacing it out to both monitor the effects and also give you body time to adjust back to normal.

Weight loss.,I got diagnosed with narcolepsy a month ago_ my doctor placed my on Nuvigil (I have never been on a prescription medicine and have never taken any form of birth control). Every day I have been awake the entire day without needing a nap (unless I thought it was a great idea to get less than 6 hours of sleep_ then I would be tired during the day but still awake.) At night the first week or two I still woke up constantly but after that I have been so exhausted when I go to bed I cant even remember if I wake up or not_ and I cant remember my dreams like I normally can. A really nice effect of Nuvigil (at least for a young person like me) is that Nuvigil removed my hunger almost. I still make sure to eat three meals a day but I don't have hunger cravings all day and if I do get hungry my stomach complains but it doesn't hurt like it normally does. The bad thing I want to complain about is the memory loss. Its really important for a student like me (studying for a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering) to be able to study and memorize things. I pay attention in class_ take good notes_ and study like i always have but even in my easy classes I failed every exam. I could tell you things the day I studied them but the next day I would go back to study and not remember a thing or how to do it.

My heart started rapidly beating_ sweating_ and just unable to settle down for any sleep. I should say I had 8 cups of tea and 1 cup of coffee - perhaps if I left out the caffeine this wouldn't have happened. Or_ perhaps a much smaller dose.,Why do people with day time sleepiness due to chronic sleep apnea use a drug such as Nuvigil to be more awake when obviously what they need is SLEEP??  I did like how Nuvigil kept me awake and alert but if it causes elevated blood pressure how is that going to effect my health? Now I am back to 2 cups green tea (using 4 tea bags) one cup black tea (using 1 tea bag) 24 oz green ice tea (using 4 tea bags) and sometimes one cup of coffee. I have tried to cut tea or caffeine use off at 2p and when doing so slept better. I also try to nap - but often if I let me self lay down my nap is 1.5 hours long - I awake feeling refreshed but that is not really a nap - that is someone who NEEDS sleep.,F,54,2  days150 1X D,11/9/2011Email,Nuvigil
76, 5, Idiopathic Hypersomnia,Nausea_ dizziness_ upset stomach_ headaches_ dry mouth_ difficulty sleeping at night,The majority of side effects I only experienced the first day or two.  Headaches went away by day 3 (but were really extreme first 2 days). I still have a little difficulty sleeping because I don't feel sleepy when it's time for bed (unless I didn't get much sleep the night before) but I found that if I just try to relax and fall asleep_ I can. The only side effect that has stayed throughout is the dry mouth_ which is bearable (just annoying at times). At least it gets me to drink a lot of water_ but it never goes away. Overall_ the drug helps me feel very alert_ functional_ and (best of all) normal. After the first 5 days_ the drug didn't seem as effective and I was falling asleep all day. However_ I think it's because I was having trouble sleeping the first few nights so I was really sleepy. During the 2nd week_ I was able to fall asleep better each night and stay at the 150mg dose for the most part. I took the pill at 5:00 AM each morning and if by 8:00 or 9:00 AM_ I still felt a little drowsy_ I took 1/2 of another 150 mg pill to total 225 mg. It seemed to help. The next day_ I just went back to 150 mg and was fine. The drug isn't perfect but it's definitely better than feeling sleepy all day.,F,29,14  days150-225 1X D,10/29/2011Email,Nuvigil
77, 5, Idiopathic Hypersomnia,Headaches.  Headaches faded over period of a week. Goes away with 2x extra strength Tylenol (ibuprophen_ and everything else doesn't work).,"Originally started on Modafinil. I started to feel more like myself after a day. That effect lasted two weeks and I fell about half-way back to pre-Modafinil state. Mayo clinic worked me up to 800mg a day. Benefit seemed to stop around 600mg. On Modafinil alone I never returned to that first two week state. There was a slight improvement each time the dosage was raised_ but my body adapted to it quickly. On Modafinil alone I never returned to that first two week state. About 1.5 years later doctor prescribed Nuvigil (Armodafinil). The dosage is 1/2 of Modafinil (its supposed to be 2x as strong). I had heard it was a waste of time - a pharmaceutical company's way of extending their patent. It appears there is some difference because when first started taking it_ the headaches returned for a week. Now I rarely if ever take naps. I reverted to Modafinil for 2-3 weeks and I could tell there was a difference. I still haven't gotten back to work_ but I am conscious_ able to work on the house and be present-even if I am not quite alert. It's not the correct use of the term_ but I refer to myself as ""minimally conscious"". For a short while Ritalin (15mg) was added to the mix and I was about 1/2 way back to work. Sadly_ the doctor who prescribed it left/retired and the new one doesn't ""believe in it.""

80, 1, Narcolepsy,For the first day or two it went great i was awake than went to sleep at night; without passing out numerous times randomly during the day. Than this medcine started making me more depressed and it was as if i lost my memory. I ended up having to have a friend come take care of me. I was writing everything down trying not to forget what i did with stuff.It was the biggest mess i've been in. I've never been so depressed_ i went to the hospital because i felt so crazy and off and the docters kept telling me that this drug has no side effect of memory loss. After talking to other people and reading results. It does. I also without some kidof medicationg to bring me off of the Nuvigil_ i ended up staying awake more than i was sleeping. I quit taking it obv. now my memory is beack and after the medicine was fully out of my system i wasnt depressed.,,F,20,2  weeks 1X D,9/7/2011Email,Nuvigil

Seems to cause some sleepyness that I do not need anymore of.,Tried provigil and that put me right to sleep.  Nuvigil does not interupt my sleep and helps me to not wake so often.  Somedays after taking it_ I feel I am drunk but this only last about an hour then I'm awake.

83, 4, Narcolepsy,Dry mouth_ headache_ nausea_ easily bruise_ anxiety_ irritable.,I love it_ and thank it to being able to live my life.  Before I was sleeping over 20 hours a day.  I would get up eat and go right back to sleep.  I didn't feel like doing anything or being around anyone_ I just wanted to sleep.  While I have had side effects_ I know that for me the pros outweigh the cons.  I have learned to cope and deal with most of them.  The headaches went away after a week or so_ now I only notice them when I forget my pill.  My doctor had recommended that I not take anything for the headaches because it would probably only make them worse if I ever do come off of it.  Dry mouth I have been able to treat and I think is important to treat with an over the counter tooth paste and mouth wash called Biotene.  I found out that dry mouth causes extra plaque to build up on your teeth and causing gum disease to form.  Since I began the Biotene (which doesn't taste bad at all_ just no extra minty flavor) I haven't had a problem with dry mouth.  I found out that it does effect hormonal forms of birth control_ so I convinced my doctor to put me on the ParaGard which uses no hormones and works for 10 years.  The only long term form of birth control that I have complete control over.  I still get nausea though I'm used to it by now.  I still can go out and enjoy my friends...though I just feel a little sick to my stomach sometimes_ when I do I just don't eat.

84, 5, Narcolepsy & Idiopathic Hypersomnia,headaches_ loss of appetite_ short bouts of nausea_  some anxiety and increased irritability,"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia at 19. After many years of taking naps after sleeping 12+ hours and falling asleep during meetings_ classes_ or driving_ I had a sleep study and was diagnosed with Narcolepsy and Hypersomnia. I hate meds (I only take IB Profen for the fibro)_ so I was leery of the Nuvigil. The first day on Nuvigil I felt like I had never felt before: My mind felt awake for the first time in what seems like forever. I had no jitters_ extreme energy_ or shakes. I did not feel any more energetic_ instead I just felt clearer and more focused. I did not want to nap throughout the day_ and I have little problems falling asleep at night. The few side effects are headaches (some mild_ some sharp ""ice pick"" headaches. I've had severe migraines for years so they do not bother me much)_ loss of appetite (I have to remind myself to eat. Usually the headaches are relieved by eating)_ and short bouts of nausea throughout the day (I have severe IBS and my stomach is very sensitive. Also dairy products make me nauseous and I've read this drug contains lactose). Some anxiety and irritability as well_ especially during stressful situations at work. After day 4_ still the same. Overall this drugs benefits outweigh the side effects for me. I feel my age for the first time ever! My worries are developing a dependency and the fact that it interferes with any hormonal BC. Neither doctor or pharmacist told me this_ so I'm glad I read up on the drug before I began it!",F,22,4  days150 MG 1X D,7/23/2011Email,Nuvigil

The first weekend I started taking this I couldnt sleep for 4 days. But_ I thought if i fought through it_ I would be fine. Which I was. I quit taking it for a whole weekend and I physically could not function. Slept all day and all night. My anxiety is at the most extreme high_ was prescribed Valium for Jaw/Teeth clenching.

I was nervous about continuing but at the end of my rope & so desperate to feel awake that I stuck it out.  It was so worth it.,I was nervous about the initial side effects but after a few days of adjustment I absolutely LOVE Nuvigil.  I have autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis_ psoriatic arthritis_ and IBS_ so I've been tired for as long as I can remember.  It was getting progressively worse to the point where I was starting to worry about driving after nodding off for a few seconds at a red light_ and worried I would fall asleep at work and get fired.  I tried Adderall for a couple months but it's short acting and I felt a crash when it was wearing off.  I also got debilitating migraines from it which affected my job.  Luckily for me my insurance covers Nuvigil with a $50 co-pay and it works great.  I finally feel normal again_ it's been so many years.  There's no highs and lows_ jitters_ or crash.  It's smooth and I don't feel like I am on anything at all.  I get occasional mild headaches easily cured with Tylenol.

Third month I though I had an inflated balloon in my left lung cavity and could not breath. Never thought it could be the Nuvigil... after 6 months of unsuccessful asthma treatment_ sinus surgery_ and allergy treatment I decided to go back to the beginning and rule out any changes I had made beginning with Nuvigil. One day off Nuvigil_ using Provigil most all breathing symptoms were eliminated. Three weeks after changing to Provigil I no longer fear I am dying - I can breath!

So far this is one of the best_ even with the negative list of side effects. I like the smooth feeling it has compared to Provigil because with the Provigil you could definitely feel it wearing off as you crashed towards the end of the day. I dont feel that with Nuvigil. The anxiety and muscle tension is less than most amphetamines I have tried in the past. The only thing that is really bad about Nuvigil for the side effects is the jaw tension and clenching. It is killing my mouth!! Overall the best medication I have taken for Narcolepsy is Xyrem_ but I cant take that at this time so I think Nuvigil is probably the best alternative that I have found.

The only side effect I am experiencing and worried about is the sudden onset of euphoria and crashing shortly afterward. This happens roughly 3 or 4 hours after taking Nuvigil in the morning_ and lasts until I go to bed at night. I do not feel the need to sleep during the day_ but don't know how I am supposed to function when fluctuating between extreme awareness/hyperactivity and brain fog or very low energy.

The first thing I noticed was a mental clarity of years past...  My mind seemed to be clear & I finally realized I WAS experiencing mental fatigue and didn't even realize it.  This alone_ makes me feel healthy again.  I would say this is the best effect_ but it's not everything.  I painted my backyard fence and vigoursly swam laps and slept well that night.  The next 2 days were the similiar.  I read books and never got tired of reading...  I will cut my next dose in half because I don't want to become dependant.

124, 3, EDS_ CFS_ FMS,Muscle tension in head and neck causing bad headaches. Extreme dry mouth.,Bottom line? Not sure what I think yet. Day 1: 1/2 pill (125mg) Had tons of energy! ZERO appetite. Got stuff done for a change_ but wound up with a killer tension headache by late afternoon. I always get headaches anyway_ so no biggie. Day 2: 1/2 pill again - didn't notice anything like the first day_ but didn't nap. Another tension headache. Day 3: 1 pill (250mg) felt pretty awake_ no naps_ but didn't want to do much. Felt anxious and had to lie on heat to ward off the tension headache. Also had such a dry mouth that I could hardly speak! All my meds say dry mouth_ but it's never that bad. Day 4 (Today): Back to 1/2 pill. Awake so far with just tight head/neck muscles. If the headaches get better_ this would be pretty good for me as I sleep night and day and am unable to do anything. My biggest issue if it DOES work out? I have no insurance and am on a 7 day free trial. I seriously doubt I could afford it_ even with the special card discount promo.

I also had extreme nausea and was not able to eat much of anything--almost zero appetite.,I am not going to continue taking it as my Ritalin does a much better job for me without the health impacts.  Since I am bipolar_ I have to watch for drugs that cause mood disorders or exacerbate them.

Unbelievable miracle pill with high energy_ concentration_ and clarity.  Almost like being on a slight dose of LSD(college flashback) but evenly controlled and sustained throughout the day.  My cognitive skills and mental accuity became sharp as a tack.  Felt so good I fixed every square foot of the entire backyard landscaping_ analyzed the entire curriculum and registered for and started Grad School all in the same first week!  Then_ during interpersonal interactions requiring high concentration_ I started to catch myself with uncontrollable jitters_ shaking_ and racing thoughts.,"I caught people looking at me oddly in conversation and I would think to myself ""I am walking/talking/shaking too fast_ whats wrong...slow down_ contain your composure...something is odd...that was wierd""  I felt so good I would wake up at 5am and go non-stop till midnight_ go to sleep wake up at 2am and work for a couple hours and get up again at 5:30am to start all over again.  During the second week_ I forced myself to stay in bed on regular hours but would wake up at 3 or 4am ready to run a marathon.  Over the last several days I thought I might be having symptoms of sleep deprivation although I struggled to get 5-6 hours worth.  I had odd periods of severe anxiety_ severe depression_ and racing thoughts that led to unexplainable impaired decision making_ confusion_ and judgement.  Spent all day yesterday stuck reanalyzing the same information over and over again thinking to myself racing thoughts and ""is there something wrong with me...or am I just tripping...""  Got up this morning exhausted_ anxious_ mentally confused and found this website.  Surprised by what I have read as I was really stuck on deciding if I was just scared_ stressed_ anxious_ or if I was in need of mental help...today.  From what I have read_ people can't make this stuff up!  So glad I read this site as it seems other individuals may have had similar experiences.

Was taking 10 mg. of Adderall morning and noon and did great on that. But sleep doctor wanted me to try Nuvigil  since it's supposed to be better... 150 mg. did nothing for my sleepiness so he upped it to 250 mg. This DID start really helping the sleepiness - like others_ I still felt tired but like it was masked and I could at least stay awake during the day to get some things done. However_ after being on it for 3 months now_ I've started having really bad tremors (hands shake and I can't write straight!) - and also ringing in my ears (a buzzing sound that is CONSTANT) - this is driving me NUTS. Did anyone else get this ringing in the ears?! I stopped the Nuvigil  a little over a week ago and the tremors are gone_ but the ringing is still going on in my left ear - right ear finally stopped ringing 2 days ago. I'm hoping my left ear will quit ringing soon.

Day 1- More energy than I've had in the past 15 years. Almost euphoria. Greatly decreased appetite Day 2- I woke up at 3:30AM. I started working around the house. I didn't stop until 9:00PM_ but I wasn't even slightly tired. Only ate a very small amount. Day 3- Woke up about 5:30AM. I cut my dose by 50%. I was suppose to take my Daughter's truck to Firestone for brake work.  Instead_ I decided to do it myself (I do a lot of my auto maintenance). I worked on her truck for 12 hours.  I didn't stop to eat_ but my wife insisted I eat.  I ate 1 doughnut.  I drank a lot of water_ tea_ and soft drinks. After I finished_ I ate a small dinner even though I wasn't hungry. Then it hit- nausea_ dry heaving for a few minutes....Odd thoughts.  I can't exactly explain them_ but anxiety.

Also_ to the last poster- Take this for what it is worth_ but I took Vyvanse a few years back before switching to Concerta (Ritalin) and the EXACT same things happened to me as you mentioned in your post.

In 3 days_ I went from extremely happy/manic to a suicide attempt to not feeling anything (anger/love/pain/pleasure/hunger/thirst). After only taking it 3 days_ it took 2 weeks for this garbage to ""wash out"" of my system. Make sure a loved one watches you for reactions to this garbage. Also be leery of prescription regimens that just don't seem right or of free samples of powerful meds like this.

Very bad side effect for me was heart palpitations.  If I drank more than 1 cup coffee in the morning_ if I worked out_ and if I didn't eat much...heart palps_ racing heart rate.  It made me very anxious.  I have also lost about 8 lbs...I have a decreased appetite and seem to eat less each sitting as well.  Another odd side effect which I am not sure if due to the Nuvigil is I started getting bad acne on chin and around mouth (deep thick blackheads over and over in the same and new spots).  I have since cut my pills in half...75mg a day now for about 3 weeks.  I feel sooooo much better!!!  Heart palps gone!!!

SEVERE: Attention_ recall_ and short-term memory deficiency_ manic and obsessive-compulsive behavior_ loss of appetite_ dry mouth_ crashing around 3:30 PM.,I was also taking Ambien daily.  I haven't been able to find anybody else with these symptoms.  They started 2 weeks after upping the dose to 250 MG_ and again after a break of a few days_ when a 150 MG pill was again taken the morning after I took Ambien.  I'd have no problem attributing the memory issues to Ambien_ but I think that the manic issues are more telling_ so I'm going with the Nuvigil on this one.  It could be an interaction (I'm also taking antihistamines)_ but I haven't been able to find anybody else with this combination of side effects.

Was taking 5mg Dexedrine XR which suited my lifestyle_ only took it when I had to drive. New neurologist insists Nuvigil is the only drug she will ok me to drive with. Says Dexedrine is to addictive_ addiction not a problem since I was making 60 5mg XR's last 4-5 months. Really feel like I'm part of this Dr.'s pharmacutical ""agenda"". My research shows Provigil/Nuvigil can be just as addictive as Dexedrine & Dr. wants me to take it every day_ no breaks.

I am concinced I am experiencing a drug interaction between one of the other meds I take and Nuvigil.,I have Sleep Apnea_ fibromyalgia_ epilepsy_ and lupus. Taking pain meds (fentynal patch and methadone) but suspect the interaction to be with one of the following oher medications I take: Neurontin_ Dilantin_ LYRICA_ SAVELLA_ ZOLOFT_ Abilify.If anyone else experiences similar symptoms and is taking ANY of these drugs PLEASE EMAIL ME as this will be the only way to detemine what might be happening. I take all my meds at night_ so in the morning they are still in my blood system. I generally need to take Nuvigil about an hour after awaking. I've noticed if I take Nuvigil late in the afternoon (around 4pm) the resulting drowsiness is NOT as bad as in the AM. I suspect that is because most of last nights meds are out of my system.

I started taking 200-400 mg/day of Provigil about 10 years with no problems at all. About 5 years ago_ I switched over to Ritalin because of a drug interaction and took it for about 4 years. After taking Ritalin long term_ I developed high blood pressure and went back to Provigil. Again_ no problems at all for the past year. 19 days ago_ I was put on Nuvigil 150 mg/day. After 7 days_ I felt that I needed a higher dosage because I was still sleepy and lethargic. I then changed to 250 mg/day and felt a little more awake_ but then everything hit the fan and I thought I was losing my mind. At first_ I blew it off as stress_ but when Nuvigil really got into my system_ it was clear that it was the culprit. I stopped taking Nuvigil 3 days ago and am just now beginning to feel close to sane. My doctor has now prescribed Vyvanse_ but I am afraid to take it because it sounds the same as Ritalin.

140, 2, Incapacitating sleepiness,Tearing in one eye (assume this is due to Nuvigil),I am writing for my husband who suffered a stroke last November.  Other than partial paralysis_ he has had unremitting sleepiness which_ unfortunately_ seems to be getting worse.  He started taking 150 mg of Nuvigil a month or more ago.  The first 2 or 3 days were awesome.  He was much more awake and able to do things he hadn't been able to do for a long time.  Then everything shut down again.  He tried halving the dosage_ taking it twice a day. Then_ with a neurologist's approval_ even doubled the dosage.  He is now taking 250 mg once a day but has had no apparent relief.  We are even wondering if Nuvigil is making his sleepiness worse.  We will see a sleep specialist later this month to see if he has any insight into this.  In the meantime_ my husband_ who has enough problems trying to recover from the paralysis_ has no life because he sleeps all the time.  We're very disappointed that the Nuvigil isn't helping at all.,M,74,30  days250 1X D,7/13/2010Email,Nuvigil

Concerned because I didn't expect to have any side effects since I thought Provigil and Nuvigil were so similar from a chemical perspective. Took Provigil for 4 years prior to Nuvigil.,I was on Provigil for 4 years & it profoundly changed my life. I am healthy but diagnosed with mixed sleep apnea and circadian rhythm disorder at 26-couldnt wake in AM & had to be physically woken by co-workers. I was AD military instructor and fell asleep while teaching! I lost time_ couldnt think_ moved in slow motion-lived in a fog. Still sleepy with CPAP-started Provigil200 and felt transformed. It reset my clock. Gave me life! 6 m after taking Provigil_ I hit a wall at 2PM- extreme sudden tiredness-increased dose to 300/day-split. It helped but got headache & stopped feeling hunger-had to set alarm to eat after losing 30+ lbs. Medically retired from AF after 12 yrs. Last month Dr suggested Nuvigil250. First day was great. No wall & wakefulness was gradual_ unlike Provigil. First night-thought bugs were crawling all over me and felt crazy! Next day I felt hungry and wanted to smoke-quit 6 yrs ago.  Havent felt hungry in 4 years. Bug sensation stopped_ but started clenching my jaw and chewing my cheeks_ then came headache and irritability. That passed but 2 w after starting- nausea like clockwork-3-4 hrs after taking pill. Nothing will alleviate it. I hope its temporary-trying to decide whats worse-this nausea and my sleepiness are debilitating.  If it doesnt improve I may have to go back on Provigil.

I wasn't even getting the calm_ happy_ focused feeling anymore; just felt hyper and as if every cell in my body was vibrating. It freaked me out. Nuvigil helps in keeping me awake_ but without the craziness of Adderall. The dry mouth is quite annoying; I feel as if I can't drink enough water.

151, 3, Neuropathy & excessive sleepiness,Horrid nightmares with intense sur-real feelings when waking up_ acne break-out all over my back_ difficulty sleeping thru the night_ jittery_ nausea & loss of appetite.,47yo male that was given Nuvigil by my Neurologist treating me for continued nerve entrapment pain and assist with treating the feeling sleepy/tired all day long from taking Lyrica_ Fentanyl Patch and Oxycotin for the management of the pain caused by the nerve entrapment.  He has done a couple radiographs with cool water laser and the pain remains constant.  The challenge has been I suffer from TIA and have to remain on Plavix; and stopping the Plavix days before surgery and then re-starting it each time has increased the frequency of small TIA attacks. Thus_ I'm living with this daily pain because I don't want to increase the risk of having another TIA attack. I also take Wellbutrin-XL and Buspar daily for anxiety and depression.  Getting the Nuvigil approved thru my insurance was more complicated than moving a mountain.  Finally got it approved but concerned with the side effects and if they will lessen in the long run.If anyone has been taking this medication while treating nerve pain and depression at the same time_ I would really appreciate feed back and insight to what you may have experienced.  I'm trying to decide if continuing this medication is beneficial in the long run while dealing with the side effects mentioned above.  One of the posts from another person mirrors my description of taking the Nuvigil--it's like taking an approved form of crack or strong dose of some stimulant.  Any comments and/or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!,M,47,5  days250mg 1X D,6/6/2010Email,Nuvigil
152, 2, Shift work sleep disorder,Overwhelming need to suck or chew_ jumpy_ moody_ nauseated,"I tried Provigil_ and I loved it! I have to play the insurance companies games_ though; try and fail Nuvigil prior to using Provigil. I acted like a junkie. I kept licking my front teeth and chewing my tongue. I was paranoid and jumpy- I kept thinking people were sneaking up on me. I was itchy. I had waves of nausea_ and couldn't get to sleep. I woke up this morning with a huge headache_ and have no intention of taking the ""legal crack"" again.",F,34,2  days150mg 1X D,5/29/2010Email,Nuvigil
153, 5, Fibromyalgia - Extreme Fatigue,Hard to fall asleep at night,Been on Provigil 200mg twice a day for over a year & it helped tremendously for a while_ but found it wasn't as effective as it had been. Instead of increasing dose (and because there was a great offer to cover $50 of the co-pay for Nuvigil)_ I started Nuvigil this week & can say that I haven't felt this productive (work & home) in 2-3 years. Hope I don't get any side-effects_ because I'm loving being the person I remember being!,F,37,4  days150 1X D,5/27/2010Email,Nuvigil
154, 2, chronic fatigue w/fibromyalgia,increased fatigue; dozing off at work; severe dry mouth & dry eyes,Nuvigil was prescribed to me because I am on shift work and have a hard time staying awake. I am usually unable to function without taking a nap every day. The first few weeks I took Nuvigil_ I didn't notice much of a difference in the way I felt but after taking it for approximately a month_ I feel it is making me feel even more tired. I have slept through my alarm clock several times recently; something I have never done before. I do not feel this medication is working for me as intended.,M,36,1  months150mg 1X D,5/23/2010Email,Nuvigil
155, 1, Fibromyalgia/exhaustion,Day 2: I felt anxious so I started taking 1/2 tablet (125 mg). Day 7: Awoke with severe nauseau_ vomiting_ shivers_ feeling like I was dying.,I'm not trying to be overdramatic here_ but I felt like this med was poisoning me. It is now day 3 since I stopped taking it_ and I'm still as sick as 3 days ago. I can hardly keep anything down. I am so depressed because this med was supposed to increase my energy. I'm now looking at being sicker than ever for at least 4 days. How am I supposed to be able to hold down a job when meds make me so sick? Please email if you have any encouraging words.,F,53,7  days250 mg 1X D,5/23/2010Email,Nuvigil
156, 3, ,None,I had been on provigil 200mg twice a day and it really helped keep me awake. My doctor (a shrink) told me I probably had narcolepsy although no formal testing or sleep study was done.  Last week he put me on Nuvigil 250mg one in the morning but it is not as effective as provigil.,M,59,8  days 1X D,5/4/2010Email,Nuvigil
157, 1, Terrible sleepiness during the day.,1)Sores in my mouth; 2)Tendency to create suction in my mouth; and 3)Waves of nausea which began on day 2.,I Suffer from sleep apnea and my dr prescribed this drug because I have trouble staying awake at work and during my commute.  The first day I took the medication I was on cloud nine.  I was euphoric.  It reduced my hunger.  I felt more optomistic than I have in years.  I thought ... what a wonderful set of side benefits.  I had a some trouble getting to sleep (even with medication).  The second day_ I decided to reduce my dose and took half a tab when I awakened and half midday.  The waves of nausea started about 2pm.  They didn't last long_ but I felt completely incapacitated for maybe a minute or two. I probably had only 3 or 4 episodes but they were unpredictable and overwhelming.  Much to my dismay_ I stopped taking the medication.  Based on the information I've read on this website_ I asked the dr for Provigil to try.  We'll see what happens.,F,57,2  days250mg 1X D,4/30/2010Email,Nuvigil
158, 4, Depression,headache a few hours after taking it_ trouble sleeping_ even 9 hours after taking it. Nausea.,I was given this to help me focus in school and it did its job. The first day I got so much done_ I didn't sleep at all that night however. Now I'm almost afraid to take it because it keeps me up no matter how early I seem to take it. I've not tried taking it right when I get up yet..,F,26,3  days150 1X AN,4/22/2010,Nuvigil
159, 5, MS fatigue and narcolopsyc,,Better than provigil...stays at a constant level in the body all day long...no wear-off effect,F,56,18  months250 1X D,4/12/2010,Nuvigil
160, 4, significant muscle weakness,some nausea,I can really notice a difference before I take it and when it has worn off at night_ so it seems to decrease the weakness during the day.  Before I take it or at night my muscles feel so weak_ it feels like an effort even just to hold a book.,F,40,5  days150 mg 1X D,4/8/2010,Nuvigil
161, 3, OSA / multiple-cause fatigue,Nervousness,"Moved from Provigil due to manufacturer's price games. Researched extensively and found that Provigil is actually 50% Nuvigil anyway. The remaining 50% is essentially a mirror image of Nuvigil on a molecular level. Nuvigil is just further refined to include only the more active of the two nearly identical molecules. (A questionable trick to extend patent protection.) After learning this_ I was expecting to react similarly to Provigil_ which had always produced a smooth_ wakeful_ but not jittery state. Unfortunately_ and to my surprise_ Nuvigil affected me much more like traditional stimulants_ producing nervousness and a ""jump out of my skin"" sensation. I quickly started taking only half a dose and had better results_ though still not ideal. Lately_ I've started quartering the tablets and taking 1/4 as soon as the alarm goes off at 6:00 and another 1/4 around 10:00. The end result is on-par with Provigil_ but not identical. As soon as Provigil hits generic in 2012 I'll be swapping back_ but I'll be doing so for effect rather than price.",M,34,1  months250 1X D,3/16/2010,Nuvigil
162, 5, Fatigue from MS,Headache several hours after taking the dose. Better if I take only half a dose.,Best thing in the world! This medication has made me able to work part time again. I wasn't able to work due to the inability to do my ADL's.I have friends again and am enjoying a better quality of life!,F,40,5  months150mg 1X D,3/8/2010,Nuvigil
163, 5, autoimmune related fatigue,Mild abdominal cramping for an hour after taking dose_ which went away after ~2weeks. Moderate-Severe headaches 6 hours after dosing_ which sometimes resolve with pain medication.,This medication has been a life saver as far as keeping a job has gone. I am much more alert and awake at work_ able to function better and quicker.  Haven't felt this good in many years.However_ I wish it lasted longer than it does. 150mg dose gives me about 6 hours of wakefulness_ after that I develop a bad headache and my usual fatigue I have sets in hard.  We may adjust my dose in the future_ but I am willing to wait it out for now. I don't really want to see if the headaches with a higher dose!,F,45,3  months150 mg 1X D,2/23/2010,Nuvigil
164, 3, Shift work disorder/depression,ACNE.  Horrible acne that starts deep in the skin and forms clusters with multiple heads.  Cant pop them and they hurt,Works like a charm_ makes me awake without jitters_ puts in a good mood but not high.  Causes acne.  I started and stopped this med a few times_ and each time I stopped the acne cleared up immediately.  New acne forms within a day of taking it.  Frustrating because it works so good_ but I look like I have a contagious disease.,M,34,5  months150mg 1X D,2/15/2010Email,Nuvigil
165, 4, depression,,I started out on half a 250 mg Nuvigil once per day for depression and mild anhedonia but it made me feel very disconnected from what was happening around me and I could not sleep.  I now split the 250 mg tablet into 62.5 mg quarters and take only one quarter in the a.m.  This dose is just right for elevating my mood_ keeping me very focused at work_ and I sleep normal at night.,M,39, 250 mg 1X D,2/12/2010Email,Nuvigil
166, 5, MS related fatigue,Often a headache that is resolved with Midrin or Fiorcet. Sometimes waking up too early therefore getting less sleep than normal.,It made me feel like I had gone back in time to before the fatigue of the MS got so bad. I could do task after task. It was a good kind of energy_ not a nervous kind. My insurance company denied it_ but I found a dr. that had free samples.,F,43,3  months,1/20/2010,Nuvigil
167, 4, S.A.D.: Seasonal Affective Disorder,"Stomach upset. Some difficulty sleeping. Must take it first thing upon awakening and no added stimulants like caffeine--no more than 1 weak cup of coffee_ also in a.m.First day taking it is a big ""high"" but after that just feel more awake.","Suffered horribly for decades with depression beginning with low hours of winter light AKA S.A.D. disorder. Felt tired even if I slept all night; couldn't seem to get ""off the couch."" Nuvigil 1/2 of 150 mg. gets me moving but not hyper. And this is antithetical to stoking depression -- the getting up and going keeps me from ruminating about feeling worthless b/c of doing nothing and subsequently becoming more depressed. And I don't need to take it every day. I'm not slap happy (didn't expect to be) but I'm productive.",F,53,10  days,12/17/2009,Nuvigil
168, 3, extreme daytime sleepiness,muscle pain; mood changes_ depression_ fatigue,Pros and Cons.  It does help me think more clearly part of the time_ but also a little paranoia in there.  People_ if you are lactose intolerant_ be sure to take Lactaid tabs with Nuvigil or Provigil.  For some weird reason_ the formula for both includes lactose.  I also feel less stomach discomfort if I take Nuvigil with food.,F,55,3  days,12/17/2009,Nuvigil

170, 2, fatigue,headaches_ nausea_ dizziness_ rage_ and_ believe it or not_ increased fatigue.  Can't stand to take it more than the 5 days I have.,Going back to Provigil for now.,F,36,5  days,9/20/2009,Nuvigil
171, 4, ADHD,Minor nausea_ diarhea_ and headaches in first week_ some increased agitation.,This was a last ditch effort for me. It took a year to get to the ADHD diagnosis for a start_ since my initial state was anxiety and depression_ but with traditional therapy alongside medication_ it became clear that ADHD is the culprit.  Nuvigil has been great after three weeks_ I had started on Provigil_ but after a month of increasingly painful headaches_ I had to move off it.  I had also tried Vyvance_ Ritalin_ and Adderall with various problematic side-effects.  My physician was skeptical that the nuvigil would be any better given the general reports_ but to our mutual surprise_ it has worked fine.  In the first week_ I had one major headache_ but a couple of aspirins kicked it_ and after that nothing.  Also was very easily agitated the first week as well_ until I acclimated to the effects.  Still having some periodic issues with nausea and diahrea_ but they are very minor.,M,41,3  weeks,8/30/2009,Nuvigil
172, 5, Narcolepsy - EDS,Headache that goes away with aspirin_ increased thirst_ increased urination.  Also_ I'm a smoker_ this drug has made me chain smoke_ badly.  I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy_ so this has been my only treatment.  Unfortunately_ I can't compare it to other treatments.,Miracle drug! I hope I don't develop any reactions to it that'll force me to go off of it. I've spent 1/2 my life (15 years) using all the energy I could muster to stay awake. I didn't remember what it was like to be awake until yesterday and today. The bags underneath my eyes are gone! I stopped slurring my speech! I can speak and not trail off to nowhere. I'm not achy or grumpy! I'm just awake_ effortlessly! I'm amazed. A normal sleeper will never be able to fully relate to a narcoleptic; that's fine_ this pill lets me relate to a normal sleeper and I'm happy about that.,M,30,2  days,8/19/2009Email,Nuvigil
173, 5, excessive daytime sleepiness_ fatig,tension in jaw and mouth; mild headache; dry eyes,"Nuvigil is a new_ purer form of Provigil_ available since June 2009. It's advertised as longer-lasting_ stronger and having fewer side effects than Provigil_ and after three weeks_ I believe it. Provigil in the morning would wear off in the late afternoon or early evening; Nuvigil lasts several hours longer. And the feeling is ""smoother"" and ""cleaner"" as I describe it; fewer headaches_ less nausea_ still some jaw-clenching tension but not as bad. And I seem to feel better the next day - not so much need to take it daily. It comes in 50_ 150 and 250 mg doses. I have been taking 150 mg or sometimes just half a pill.   The company has raised the price of Provigil and made Nuvigil cheaper - for now: they want everyone to switch to Nuvigil because there will be generics for Provigil in a couple of years. It's a marketing ploy_ but so far_ it works for me.",M,63,3  weeks,8/6/2009Email,Nuvigil
