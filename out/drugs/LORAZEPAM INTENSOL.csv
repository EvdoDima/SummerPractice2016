2, 4, Anxiety,Drowsiness_ very mild dizziness,I take 1MG before I go to bed usually to wind down from my day and I notice the difference_ it helps to calm me and put my mind to ease so I can get to sleep instead of just thinking and thinking which kept me up at night.,M,24,5  months,6/30/2009,Lorazepam intensol
3, 5, Anxiety,Deep relaxation quickly,Probably because it was in liquid form it worked so quickly.
