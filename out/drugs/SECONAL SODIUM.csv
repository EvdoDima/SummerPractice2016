0, 5, home,None,The best pill for insomia and cronic anxiety whrn taken as perscibed..i donÂ’t understand why Docs say no to seconal,M,62,10  months200,7/18/2016Email,Seconal sodium
1, 5, Insomnia,"I used as needed and slept each time.  I did not become ""addicted"" or crave the drug.   This medication is so far superior to Ambien and the like.",It is too bad that physicians are so hesitant to prescribe Seconal and that pharmacists act like you have a prescription for  an illegal substance when you present the hard copy to them.   I know all of the horror stories about Seconal..I know all of the dangers and precautions.  I simply follow the prescription (use as needed) and I have never had a problem.  I do not drink alcohol when I take the medication (common sense and also listed on the bottle)   Seconal has become so vilified for reasons that could be attributed to any drug_ even OTC drugs_ Tylenol is so dangerous and damaging.   This is not because it is inherently bad_ it is because people do not follow the instructions....period.,M,50,90  days100 1X D,6/9/2015Email,Seconal sodium
2, 5, For sleep,I had heard about possible side effects. But I never experienced any of them. It worked very well.,My seventeen year old daughter and I have both been diagnosed with insomnia. Over the counter sleeping pills like Unisom have helped her_ but I needed something a bit stronger. For a while_ my doctor had me on seconals. I slept profoundly with it. It would knock me out within minutes. More recently_ I have been going back and forth between Lunesta and the Unisom that my daughter takes. But seconals seemed to work the best.,F,49,3  years 1X D,10/1/2010Email,Seconal sodium
3, 5, I suppose so,For chronic insomnia? it dose its job perfectly.As good as this medicine is for insomnia_ it is brutally addictive.If you do have access to it_ proceed with exquisite caution.,I had been a chronic insomniac for about 10 years_ when finally at age 16_ a Dr prescribed to me the infamous non barbiturate_ Doriden- I say that fast acting barb's are addictive_ but nothing tops Doriden for abuse potential- So they switched me to Seconal. but after a few months_ I was taking more then I should- I was hospitalised for detox_ and suffered a series of gran mal seizures- I could have died. Dont taste this forbidden fruit if given the opertunity_ or you will soon be self increasing you dose- this is a truly dangerous substance.,M,62,2  years,1/19/2010,Seconal sodium
4, 5, Sleeping problems,"A sleepy ""hang over"" effect in the day.","I've had problems with sleeping issues/insomnia on and off for years now. I've tried many over-the-counter and prescription sleeping pills before without much luck until using ""Seconal"" (secobarbital) sodium. Although barbiturates are considered ""old time"" medications and are rarely used today because the risk of addiction and lethal overdose - they still can be a real blessing for those who use them responsibily. Seconal works a whole lot better than the newer seditives like Ambien or Lunesta. I highly recommend this med.",F,20,2  months,5/16/2009,Seconal sodium
5, 5, Major Insomnia,Dizzyness_ euphoria_ laziness.,Well I was only prescribed one time because I had tried every possible sleep med on the market and was about to turn myself into a pscyh ward due to sleep deprevation. My PCp finally said I want you to try this and don't ever expect to see an rx again this is a one time thing so hold onto them as long as you can. I took one as soon as I left the pharmacy and drove home fast. When I got home it was 3pm and I ate a small meal. I had a feeling of being drunk without the full stomach or needing to pee. As soon as I hit the pillow I just smiled a big ol smile and slept straight for 16 hours. I woke up feeling a bit groggy but man o man was that a great sleeping pill. I only had 15 so I used it once a week and it was a nice chance to catch up on the sleep I lost during the week. Once I ran out I was very sad because I've tried everything on the market and this was the ONLY drug that ever worked so well. I guess there were alot of people that od'ed on the stuff in the 70's. I say how many peo,M,38,15  days,11/6/2005,Seconal sodium
