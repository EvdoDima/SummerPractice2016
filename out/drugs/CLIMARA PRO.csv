0, 2, menopause,Anxiety_ depression_ feelings of fear. Increased hot flashes. Everything I had in 2008 when this crazy menopause started.,I was on Activella from 2009-2012. Then switched to Combipatch 2013-2016(April) and my co pay went through the roof due to a new Rx company.  I switched to Climara Pro and it's not 1/10th the help that Combipatch was. The only positive thing I can say about Combipatch is that I sleep better. The rest is a train wreck.  I'm having panic attacks again_ not wanting to leave my house. Overwhelmed by daily activities.  It's crazy I know that the change between synthetic estrogen/progesterone types would do this_ but it has.  I am a medical professional and I just can't be like this again. Something has to give.  Will report later.,F,,2.5  months 1X W,7/7/2016,Climara pro
1, 3, Menopause,22 cm2 Climara Pro system contains 4.40 mg estradiol and 1.39 mg levonorgestrel. Only comes in 1 concentration. Better than oral which left me with severe diestive issues_ reflux_ depression_ headaches_ dizziness_ nausea_ bad taste in mouth_ dry mouth_ sore throat_ ringing in ears. On full patch_ sleep better_ flushes reduced. Thinking slightly clearer. Memory still impared. However_ sore throat cough_ are decreased from oral. Half patch seems better. Fewer side effects_ and still can sleep. However my doctor says do not use half and wants me to see a GI doctor. All these side effects are listed in the packaging materials.,Only comes in 1 size/dose. Patch comes off if you are not careful. Still leaves gooey residue at end of week.,F,53,2  weeks,6/6/2015Email,Climara pro
