2, 1, Migraine,I had panic attacks and heart palpitations.,I was given this med for headaches. My heart rate shot up from 78 to 191. I thought i was having a heart attack. I could not yell out because i was too weak. So i started to pray. I felt stuck like it was never going to stop!!! The nurse had to give me adivan to calm me down. The nurse had to sit by my bed side to monitor my heart rate. It never went back to 78 it stayed in the 90's. This is the worst feeling ever id rather feel pain. Please take this med and get rid of it before it claims someones life. This happened 2 weeks ago and im still a nervous wreck!

6, 1, Nausea and vomiting,Ten minutes after getting an IV dose of this med_ I felt like I was going nuts. My skin was crawling_ I had very bad panic_ and I was close to pulling my IV out and leaving the ER. This was absolutely the WORST physical feeling I have ever had...mind you_ I've given birth and had multiple surgeries. Stay away!

7, 1, Neasea,Well I was taking compazine because I kept vomitting after  my wisdom teeth removal. Well turns out I'm in the 2% of people allergic to it. I had severe dystonia_ my lip and jaw drooped_ I looked like I was having a stroke. My teeth would not unclench and the worst was my neck muscles were out of control and I looked like I was the exorcist. Scariest experience of my life. I couldn't stop looking up. Thank god they gave me iv Benadryl and my neck finally went back to normal,,F,21,1  days,6/29/2016,Compazine
8, 1, Nausea from stomach flu,Jittery_ anxious_ angry_ restless_ muscle spasms_ profuse sweating. I was given this garbage via IV for nausea in the emergency room due to me losing 10 pounds from vomiting/diarrhea from the stomach flu. After about 5 minutes I noticed that my legs wanted to kick and they began cramping. I started sweating and I wanted to start punching people and rip out my IV and start running as far away from the hospital as I can (even though I drove lol.) I started to calm down about 20 minutes later and when the nurse came back I asked her why I reacted like that and she said that it happens with some people. The doctor gave me a script of this crap (which I will never fill_) I'll just stick to Pepto Bismol. Avoid this medicine.,Don't ever take this shit. Ever.,M,32,1  times,6/19/2016,Compazine
9, 1, As a part of migraine protocol,"Restlessness_ muscle aches_ extreme discomfort_ the feeling of wanting to ""crawl out of my skin"".",I received this drug as a part of migraine protocol IV cocktail (Benadryl/Compazine/Dexamethasone) in emergency room after experiencing 3-day long severe migraine bout. Immediately after the IV push I experienced the feeling of restlessness and muscle cramps similar in sensation to what happens during rising fever. It felt as if anything touching my skin was giving me the feeling of great discomfort and irritation (clothing_ blanket). I realized that it might be a reaction to one of the medications in the cocktail but wanted to give them a chance to work anyway and did not alert the nurse. The cocktail worked in the sense that it broke my migraine but even 2 days later I'm still experiencing same side effects of restlessness and muscle cramps_ although diminished. Just waiting for Compazine to leave my system at this point.,F,43,1  days10mg 1X D,6/3/2016Email,Compazine

I went home and although my headache was gone I still felt dizzy and anxious. I had a panic attack and had to go back to the ER. They gave me an IV to try and flush my system. I went home. The next day I still felt dizzy and drowsy. I went to the doctor and they gave me a medicine to control the dizziness. They said the compazine would just have to run its course. This is day three and I'm still having trouble sleeping_ dizziness_ and anxious feelings. I'm hoping it wears off soon.,I would not recommend anyone taking this drug!!!!

18, 1, Dizziness - moderate vertigo,Increased dizziness_ felt worse than before. Dry mouth_ anxiety_ tiredness/fatigue_ just wanted to sleep_ didn't want to do anything. Disturbed sleep_ woke up in night and couldn't get back to sleep,Prescribed Stemitil - Prochlorperazine maleate 5mg three times a day for vertigo. Dipping and swaying feeling_ not spinning sensation but feeling off balance_ even sitting still. I woke up with it one morning. Doctor tested me for Epley maneuver but said it wasn't crystals inside ear canal. I suggested Stemitil because it worked for me 30 yrs ago when I had extreme dizziness and nausea from a damaged inner ear after a road traffic accident. Ive had dizzy spells come and go over the years from my ear damage. I haven't had dizziness for many years so I thought the tablets would help me like they used to_ but now I am menopausal and my body has changed. I only took them for 3 days but the dizziness got much worse so on day 4 I stopped taking them. I felt anxiety_ dry mouth_ exausted_ and more dizzy. After researching online I am now trying sublingual under tongue methylcobalamine vitamin B12 high dose but I need to try it for a few weeks to find out if this will help reduce my vertigo.,F,56,3  days5mg 3X D,3/11/2016,Compazine

21, 1, nausea,My husband was given IV Compazine for nausea. Almost immediately he became severely anxious_ and his heart rate rapidly increased and he began sweating. He is not an anxious person and this was extremely out of character. He told me he felt like he was going to die and begged me to help him! He also had feelings of paranoia that he's never had before. The nurse gave him some Ativan to counteract the results and he was able to get calmed down slightly. However_ now 2-3 weeks later he has been up several times in the night still experiencing the same side effects. He never experienced this prior to taking Compazine! DO NOT Take this medication!,,M,43,1  days 1X AN,2/21/2016,Compazine
22, 1, Stomach virus. (5 days),While not being able to hold down any food for days_....my stomach started hurting very bad.  I couldn't take the stomach pain anymore.   Called mom to take me to the E.R.  I know I lost 10 lbs that week_ and shouldn't have waited THAT long!   I was admitted & they gave me some phenegran thru I.V.  My stomach was still hurting very bad_...it didn't help at all.   They then gave me this horrid Benedryl/Compazine cocktail.   The next thing I knew I felt like I was suddenly going to die.  I wanted to rip my I.V. out right then and there.  I thought about it_ and didn't say anything to mom or the nurses_....but nothing but bad thoughts entered into my mind.   I couldn't stop thinking about taking that I.V. out myself though.  I'd never experienced anything even close to this before.  I dealt with it on my own_ was released from the hospital as it did eventually work_ & the bag of I.V. fluids did help as well.   .......was then dropped off at my house and continued thinking/feeling,,M,33, ? 1X H,2/1/2016Email,Compazine
23, 1, Migraine and nausea,"I was given a cocktail of benadryl then compazine and fluids due to a migraine I had for 2 weeks. At first I thought the crazy feeling was just me as I deal with anxiety anyway. In the next week I experienced random attacks of impending doom_ like I was going to die. WORST feeling ever! I ended up back in the ER shortly after (still had migraine/nausea) and was given same cocktail. I wanted to rip out my iv and run. I knew then it was from the compezine. The only thing that kept me there was knowing I was getting a dose of valuim (which hardly helped the impending doom feeling) for my brain MRI. After reading these comments I regret not telling the nurse right away how I was feeling. Other than the impending doom I also felt trapped_ like I was never going to leave that hospital room. I was so tired and wanted to sleep but felt like I would never wake up if I did. The ""cocktail"" did make me feel better temperaily but I can't say that it was worth it. I would rather stay puking my guts out with a pounding migraine then feel like that ever again!",I suggest you please tell your nurse or doctor right away if you have any negative symptoms of compazine!,F,,1  days,1/9/2016,Compazine
24, 1, Severe Migraine,Extreme anxiety for entire 48 hrs Panic attacks + shakiness Insomnia Difficulty breathing,Dear hospitals_ PLEASE for the love of God STOP giving this POISON to your patients! I was given this garbage for a severe migraine and within seconds I was shaking like crazy and I had the worst anxiety of my life for 2 whole days. I couldn't even sleep it off because it was preventing me from sleeping and at one point I was even having trouble breathing. It didn't even work for the pain I was in_ it only made me feel like I was going out of my mind. To make matters worse_ the nurse gave it to me even when I asked her not to_ and then told me to stop freaking out while I was having a panic attack. Always make sure that you ask your doctor or nurse what they are about to give you. Don't let yourself or your loved ones get injected with this panic poison!!!,F,23,1  days10,1/8/2016,Compazine
25, 1, Concussion,I wouldn't wish this drug on my worst enemies. I've never been suicidal in my life before this. It's been over 72 hours since they shot me up with it in the ER_ and I'm still not focusing the same. I'm listless in my desires_ but man_ I couldn't even sit still. I looked like I was crazy. The only thing that's helped is Klonopin.,,F,26,1  days5mg/mlx100 1X D,1/6/2016Email,Compazine
26, 1, Nausea/vomiting,I was young_ 12 or 13. Was given a shot in the buttocks at the ER. That was the most painful injection I have ever had in my life. 24 hours later I could not relax my stomach muscles and began feeling jittery like I had to run away. My mother took me to the clinic and while sitting in the waiting room my mouth turned into a grimace and my tongue protruded out_ heart was racing. They rushed me to an exam room and while lying on the table my back arched to the point that the only thing touching the table was the top/back of my head and my heels. My tongue came out and curled down my chin. I remember the Doc coming in and ordering the nurse to get Benadryl shots stat! After the B shots(s) I was able to relax and felt better after a few days.,Prior to this reaction_ I was very outgoing_ loved to get up in front of the class to read my stories_ do speeches or just clown around. Afterwords I was withdrawn_ anxious and started suffering panic attacks. The rest of junior high and high school was hell! That was in the late 70's so you didn't talk about your fears. There are no panic disorders or any other type of mental illnesses running in my family so I just suffered for years until seeing a shrink and getting on some mild meds around 1999 or so. After reading all the experiences of others_ I am convinced this drug affected a big part of my life. My anxiety was so severe it kept me from furthering my education. The good news is_ it does get easier over time and I never ever had a desire to do drugs because after that reaction it took several years for anyone to even get me to swallow an aspirin. LOL! I noticed on some of the comments that people have a desire to correspond with others about their experience. I would be very interested in that myself and am leaving email address. I f this drug is still available_ do not take it!,M,53,1  timesUnsure 1X O,12/8/2015Email,Compazine

Went to EC last weekend after fiorecet and phenergan failed and I was vomiting green bile and drooling. The IV compazine_ benadryl_ toradol_ steroid cocktail worked immediately. I did experience the flight stage and wanted my IV out. However_ it ended the pain_ nothing else mattered. I fought the irritability and went to sleep. I could not work or drive the next day. After that I was fine. I take the oral form of compazine now with benadryl and pain meds for migraine and it's working so far. Good luck to all you other migraine sufferers. I pray for us all to be pain-free.,Careful with IV use,F,32,7  days10mg,11/7/2015,Compazine
28, 1, migraine,I have to say that I know now that giving someone compazine IV without pretreating them with a beta-blocker and ativan is just asking for trouble. Unfortunately_ at the time I didn't know and sadly they usually don't tell you what they are giving you. Some doctors absolutely refuse to treat anything but obvious pain (broken bone_ bad burn..etc) with opiates. It turned out I was given a large push of straight compazine and about the same time the nurse left I started feeling burning and jitters. I then felt waves of tingling coursing up my body. I started to feel restless and anxious as if something bad was happening and then I started to cry. I don't know why but I just knew I must be having a reaction to the medicine and that I could very well die. I slammed the emergency button and the nurse came in and said it was just normal side effects. ?? wtf_ I was freaking out and going out of my mind but how can you relate that? I now know I did have a reaction but that it precipitated an anx,Terrible drug_ I know it has it's uses and if given orally or as a injection into the arm or butt that cuts down on the side effects a lot_ but just hearing that drugs name scares the crap out of me.,M,50,1  days? 1X D,8/23/2015,Compazine

I felt like I needed to get out of the hospital immediately_ like I was trapped and was never going to get to leave. I became extremely agitated and demanded that the nurses remove my IV so I could leave. I thought once I got home_ the anxiety would be gone. I was wrong. I was anxious the rest of the evening along with feeling foggy_ disconnected and having thoughts that nothing would ever be okay again. It has been 24 hours since the IV dose_ and I still feel very anxious and disconnected.I would tell anyone to NEVER take this drug.

39, 1, Migraine,This drug is HORRENDOUS! I was told that any side effects would last only a few hours after leaving. The side effect of this medication were worse than the migraine. It took 48 hours for the effects to diminish. Within 10 mins.of it being administered I was restless_ fidgety and exhausted at the same time (which is a terrible combo). Once I got home (which by the grace of God_ I was able to drive myself home...which I should not have been allowed to do) I couldn't sleep_ yet was too groggy to stay up. I lost my appetite and urinated incessantly! I mean I must have peed every 1 1/2 hrs. It stunk really bad too...for about 3 or 4 days. I had jaw clenching that was so bad that my jaw was sore for almost 4-5 days after the injection wore off. I took about a week for the restlessness to dissipate. Still having trouble sleeping almost 3 weeks later!  After the 48 hour period...the migraine came back for almost two more days!I am a spiritual person and believe that life events can shape us,This drug SUCKS!,F,,1  daysIDK 1X O,4/9/2015,Compazine

Went to ER to just find some relief to get comfortable_ COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE!! 1ST time I had this cocktail. I already suffer from panic attacks_ especially with any morphine/opiates. Within 5 min of the IV cocktail- full blown panic attack. Crawling out of my skin to get up and walk around- in way too much pain to do it. After lying there for another few minutes felt like a heart attack was coming_just wanted to get out of there and get that IV out of me.

By the third day I had convinced myself I was loosing it. I had social anxiety symptoms_ the feeling I needed to get out of the room I was in and then just keep ""escaping"" is the best way I can describe it. I couldn't function because I was so agitated_ insisting on leaving (which I finally did by that evening)....just a bunch of different symptoms that were not easy to deal with. They finally gave me some Benadryl and then some Ativan to calm me down. I was being treated as though I was just a random crazy lady who was just f.ed up. They had psychiatry come talk to me (3 different drs at three different times) who all said there's nothing  wrong with your mental status at all....the medical team just needs something to blame your symptoms on and this time this won't work for them. I left AMA that evening & went to a different hospital for the rest of my inpatiet time. Once the compozine had been flushed from my system I was back to normal. I seriously would have slept on a bench in a park in a bad neighborhood next to a crazy homeless guy than to stay there one more second.

59, 4, Headache from TIA,I was given compazine with Benadryl  to help my headache. I was at the ER for a TIA (mini stroke). I had been begging for meds to help my headache since I arrived at the ER and was put in a room. The doctor could not give me narcotics because I was gonna be transferred to another hospital to have a work up. Anyway as soon as the nurse put the medicine in my IV my heart rate jumped in the 100s and my BP jumped to 168/138.  I started feeling tired and then it immediately stopped and I started getting so nervous. This feeling was crazy. I felt agitated and anxious. I started having and uncontrollable cry. I wanted to take off running and scream at the same time. I told the nurse that I wanted to go home and begged them to give me something to calm me down and the doctor said no I'm sorry we can't . So I signed papers to go home and needles to say today is the third day home and I'm still jittery and nervous. I can't sit still. I can't believe the doctor couldn't give me Ativan or something in my IV to calm me down. And on top of that I have a bad heart ( PFO) _ angina and high BP  so this definitely didn't help my BP and angina.

60, 1, Migraine,"To start off I am a psychiatric social worker and very aware of med reactions. I was instructed to go to the ER for a migraine that had lasted approx 5 days. In the ER I was given a ""migraine cocktail"" to include benadryl and compazine. Almost immediately After being administered the compazine I developed a side effect that I now know is common for this drug called extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS). My main symptom was akathisia or the feeling of anxiety_ panic_ and the need to constantly move. I felt as though I needed to get out of the ER and I needed to crawl out of my skin. Unfortunately_ I didn't tell the doctor I was experiencing this and didn't even recognize what it was until the next day because I had only seen EPS with antipsychotic use. Needless to say I called the ER the next day and was immediately told to come back. I was given bags of IV fluids and more IV Benadryl to counteract the akathisia. It worked and that symptom immediately disappeared. However_ the next two days I was extremely anxious so I was given a small script for Xanax and have felt fine since. In conclusion_ if you are experiencing any symptoms of EPS_ even days later_ get to an ER and get treatment IMMEDIATELY. This was a terrifying experience and I now understand what some of my patients experience during treatment. You will feel better!",,F,28,1  times10mg,11/8/2014Email,Compazine

I didn't wanna tell them how I really felt because I was afraid they'd give me something else that might make it worse. I honestly thought I was gonna die.

On top of my mental breakdown_ I had uncontrollable muscle spasms which just made me so thrilled. Finally_ I fell asleep. My dreams were horrendous_ of course.

Never even said my nausea was very bad so I don't know why they gave me this terrible drug in the first place. Almost immediately after the injection_ I felt an awful rush through my body up to my throat and all the sudden I lost all grasp on reality. I felt this overwhelming urge to kill myself and everyone around me to get off of this terrible drug. I felt it was the only way! I was sobbing and asking the nurse what was wrong and she was very rude and said to calm down- that's all! I felt like I could not understand a word anyone was saying. My muscles felt like they didn't work and I felt like my skin turned to rubber. Every breath felt like a struggle. My BP went up so high the nurses came running in and all they did was tell me to calm down again. Like I could help it! I wanted to rip the IV out and hang myself with the bed sheets! I've never felt this way in my entire life. Almost 24 hours later and I feel jittery_ upset_ and traumatized from the incident. I want to sue whoever made this terrible drug.

Second day I had to go to school_ and as I was about to walk home_ my head just locked in an upright position_ my eyes started rolling back_ and my neck was twisting_ it was painful and I was scared_ because I thought I was going crazy.

It was probably one of the worst feelings I have ever had.,I think that this drug should only ever be a last resort!

105, 4, migraine headache,Note! If you are too nauseated to keep the pill form down...ask your Dr. for rectal suppository .... works quickly....Europeans take many mere via this. method as it absorbs quickly through the intestinal wall. My Dr.was surprised when I asked if it was available...as she had never heard about it. It is cheap....very cheap in comparison to the fancy migraine meed. Only problem is it must be kept in fridge...melts easily. When people tell.me of their headaches being awful and object to this suggestion....I know they are not in REAL.PAIN......Another tactic that works is to take whatever mere...wait 20 minutes.Get in shower. Point water to your head. Turn as hot as you can stand then switch to cold as you can stand then hot then cold back and forth till you cant take it any more.....this will expand and contract blood vessels and pump mere through your system. Idealnif you can go to bed and take a nap after the shower. People who object to this method because it willL mess up their hair are not in REAL PAIN.!!!

Within five minutes of having the drug administered my legs began to shake uncontrollably while my breathing began to be labored and my throat began to close. The nurse literally ran to get the doctor in charge. As I am laying there thinking I'm going to die the doctor injected Benadryl and the reaction began to immediately subside.  The doctor said in all his years practicing medicine had had never seen a reaction to Compazine. He assigned a nurse to stay with me at all times during my ER stay to ensure that I was not going to have any further reactions.  Like others have noted here_  I continued to experience a reaction after the initial event.  I had very restless legs for a solid month after the event.

111, 3, Severe Migraine,I have been given Compazine through an IV about 4 times in the past year. I've had a concussion for about 10 months now and I had migraines beforehand. Now_ the migraines come much more often and are extremely painful_ much more so than prior to my concussion. One night_ I experienced severe pain that I had never felt before. My head felt like it was about to explode because of the pain. After taking Fiorescet and Maxalt with no relief_ I went to the hospital and they decided to give me Compazine. After about 30-45 minutes on the IV_ I started feeling lightheaded and shortness of breath. I started hyperventilating and I felt like I just wanted to run around screaming. I demanded that the doctors take the IV out because I desperately wanted to get out of there. Once I was home_ I couldn't get to sleep because I was still breathing funny. I think I had this reaction because Fiorescet was a caffeine tab and Compazine is a depressant so they were counterattacking one another. Fortunately_ the medicine helped my headache so my neurologist gave me a prescription for Compazine. I find the pill doesn't result in the crazy side effects_ but my legs do get restless and my toes twitch uncontrollably if I'm not hydrated. The only problems with the pill (10 mg) is that the hangover from the migraine is so intense that the headaches last for two or three days afterwards and it also causes severe drowsiness.

He jumped out of the bed and started yelling at the doctor he nearly tried to rip the IV out. We were so afraid to give him anything else but finally they gave him Ativan to counter the compazine.

130, 1, Cluster headache,"While I have taken compazine orally before with no problem_ the I.V. compazine for me_ as well_ caused such a severe panic attack I DID rip my IV out the first time because no one was at the hospital with me and they just left me in the room after administration. They got me set back up and gave me some ativan_ but it was one of the worst feelings in my life. I have a pre-existing anxiety condition to begin with_ so I think I am also more susceptible to this compazine-induced anxiety_ but clearly others have had a terrible reaction as well. It seems to me it was a very specific panic_ too... it was not only that I wanted to get out of the hospital room_ I suddenly feared I would never leave. Claustrophobia also set it and the having the IV in_ being ""tethered"" to something_ made it that much worse. I might have been a little better off if I had asked to go to the bathroom and just get out of the room. Skin crawling_ racing thoughts_ racing heart.

I have never had a worse psychological reaction from any other drug in my life. I love being a mom and am looking forward to our new baby.

I did not know where to attribute my feelings and assumed I was just sick of being in an ER for 5 hours. Luckily I drove home OK_ and then things got much worse. What a nightmare.

140, 1, Chronic Nausea and Vomiting,Besides the restlessness and anxiety_ I experienced very unusual symptoms including a locked jaw and involuntary movements of my tongue. The first symptoms after taking this drug were subtle. I felt restless and tired at the same time. My mind was out of control_ though I sensed my body was exhausted_ my brain remained restless and would not allow me to sleep or rest. At this point_ I didn't make the connection between these symptoms and the drug. A day or two go by and I was still taking the medication_ until I realized my tongue was slightly arched toward my throat beyond my control. Still_ I thought nothing of it and hoped it was just my imagination. Eventually it got to the point where it made my breathing difficult and my jaw started to act up as well. My jaw would open_ again involuntarily_ to the,fullest extent_ painfully stressing my jaw bones and muscles. Then my jaw would close shut_ pressing my teeth together with a crushing force. It cycled back and forth several times and I could almost feel the drug rushing through my face as I experienced these symptoms. I finally went to the hospital and they gave me an IV of Benadryl and the symptoms faded away. By far the worst drug I have ever taken. This should be off the market_ and banned universally. I was told that only a few people were allergic to this drug_ and I was one of the few_ but I think that's just an excuse for drug makers to extend their profit margin regardless of it's dangers.,M,21,2  days 1X D,8/30/2011Email,Compazine

I honestly thought the anxiety was coming from being in the hospital but when i was discharged i went home and i got an anxiety attack. I remember me shaking and having trouble breathing. This has been by far the worst feeling ever!!!!! I could not sit still and i felt as everything would annoy me.

They gave me morphine and ativan to calm me down and sent me home. I went back to the ER yesterday (Friday) because I wanted to kill myself.

They did not help me with side effects_ or even belie,It was the single most traumatic exeperience of my life_ and I say that as someone who_ for her age_ has gone through a lot of tough things. I would not recommend this to anyone. It seems more people have trouble with it than are helped by it_ and there are better drugs to treat the things it's used to treat. The risks outweigh any possible benefit. I don't see how use of this drug is at all ethical and it should removed from the market entirely. No one should have to suffer like that when there are better ways. I wouldn't wish the horrible side effects it gave me on my worse enemy. I believe I will forever be afraid now to seek immediate medical attention again due to my experience with this drug. I can't trust ER docs and I don't want to risk ever feeling that again.

170, 1, Migraine,I went to the ER with an unusually strong and horrible migraine today. They administered Compazine 5mg via IV and within about 5 minutes the fear was overwhelming. I feel like my experience has been literally copy+pasted as most of you sound just like me! It's crazy! I wanted to pull out my IV and the most disturbing effect was feeling as if I wasn't getting enough air. When I tried to take a deep breath I didn't feel the oxygen and felt like I was suffocating. I rang for the nurse on the call button and she never came. My chest felt like it was tightening and I felt like if I fell asleep I wouldn't wake up. I got very warm feeling and remembered thinking that maybe the excruciating migraine was better than this impending wave of fear. I wanted to scream_ I wanted to jump up out of that ER bed and grab someone and scream at them to make this stop. I didn't_ I just stayed in the bed and realized while I was contemplating these different scenarios in my mind I MUST have been breathing or,,F,26,1  days5mg 1X D,2/22/2011,Compazine

172, 1, Migraine/Nausea,Extreme anxiety_ restlessness_ and body shakes,I have regular migraines_ that are so severe_ I'll become nauseous. I went to the emergency room with a severe migraine and nausea. As the nurse was injecting the Compazine into my IV_ she proceeded to tell me about the time she was given Compazine_ and freaked out. She said after being given the medicine_ she thought the world was gonna end and completely freaked out. She pulled the IV from her veins and was trying to rush to pick up her kids and save them_ and she felt like she was going crazy. When she told me that_ I was instantly pissed because it was too late to turn down the medicine. About 10-15 minutes later I felt so anxious and I couldn't sit still. I was going back and fourth through the ER_ and couldn't sit still. I began to jump up and down_ trying to release the pent up energy and anxiety. My arms and legs became shaky and I just felt the need to move and go. The feeling was so overwhelming and made me feel so crazy. The nurse said the side effects would go away in about 12 hrs. That was not true_ the feelings of anxiety lessened_ but still lasted for three days! I wanted to rest_ but couldn't_ I tried to sleep but my body was still alert and jumpy. This was in June of 2010_ but to this day_ I will experience small waves of inexplicable anxiety. I have NEVER had problems with feelings of anxiety of ANY kind in my life.

As soon as the IV started my hand and veins felt like they were on fire. I kept saying to my husband I had to get out_ I just needed to leave the ER_ I just could not stay there. I wanted to crawl out of my skin_ I kept begging my husband to rip the IV out of my hand. I kept saying to him that if it didn't stop I was going to die. I never act like this_ I was in so much panic and did not know why. Two hours later the doctor came in an apologized for what had happened. She told me she had seen the last few patients have the same reaction and thought the Benadryl would help me. The doctor went on to say that iT was a bad batch of Compazine.

I had received Compazine in the pill form before for nausea without the side effects.  The IV Compazine does just what a lot of people here said it does.  Makes you feel like you are going crazy_ anxious_ restless_ etc.  I actually did pull my IV out and walk out of the hospital.  This was after I basically begged the nurses to do it and my wife told them I was going to pull it out but they didn't listen.

The doctor offered more pain medicine and gave me IV Compazine with Benadryl!  I have never experienced anything like this.  I knew within a couple of minutes that something wasn't quite right.  I felt like I had no control over my body and also felt ""trapped"" like other reviewers have described.  I am two days out now and still feel very edgy and not myself.  I plan to visit my regular doctor on Monday to make sure no permanent damage has been done by this drug.  The doctor or nurse neither one explained the drug to me before giving it.

I took this medication and 20 minutes later I couldn't see straight_ it was like I was in a different world_ I was anxious_ I wanted to pull my IV out_ I didn't want to look at anyone. I couldn't sleep for three days! I had to induce sleep by taking homeopathy sleeping pills. I felt hopeless like there was no point of living. I couldn't concentrate_ my vision was cloudy. Imagine living like this! Like there is no point to your life. I felt like I was somebody else. This is the worst experience I've ever had in my life! I felt paranoid and I was afraid to leave my home. My muscles are all tense and they hurt. I felt trapped in my own head and I couldn't escape the thoughts I was having. I was questioning my existence and the existence of the world. I think that doctors need to warn people of these side affects before giving this medication. I will never ever take this medication again. And after all of this...I still have a headache.,Before taking this medicine please try to find an alternative.

That was two days ago and I am still having problems sleeping_ problems with paranoia and hopelessness. I have never felt this way in my life. My headache is gone but I would gladly deal with that instead of these odd feelings of uneasiness. I have been crying because I cannot shake this feeling.

I am planning on taking Tylenol PM to sleep because I refuse to go through this again tonight. I don't think it's fair that this drug has this terrible side affect and the patients aren't made aware. When I get over these jitters (hopefully soon) I plan to make a full complaint and that this drug be pulled off of the market.

She took it as directed but after the 3rd time she had a bad reaction and began to panic.  She was walking around the room nervously when i came home from work saying she didnt know what to do that something was wrong.  Within minutes of being there with her she started complaining about her eye sight being blurred.  Minutes later her jaw began chewing on its own.  A few more minutes and her whole face was frozen in a surprised look and she couldnt walk straight. Benadryl was the fix but i dont ever want to see her like that again.,Even though my wife had a terrible reaction i cant condemn the drug altogether.

I paced for a second and then sat back down.  Soon after I sat down_ I had no control of my body.  My head went back_ my arms slumped over the chair and my legs flung out.  I could hear the nurses asking me questions but I could not respond.  I was mumbling but nothing came out clear.  My worst was the nausea.  I believe that I could handle any pain better than the nausea that I was experiencing.  It was the worst feeling I had ever had.  I thought I was going to die.

I also have a panic disorder which at first made it hard to figure out what was going on.  Was at ER for flu symptoms and they gave me compazine in my IV_ then released me.  Within minutes I felt the scariest panic attack of my life_ my stomach was on fire and I could not sit still.  Heart started to race.  As we were driving home my tounge began to twist violently_ so hard it was hurting.  Then I suddenly kept holding my breath for sometimes 45 seconds at a time_ I could not control.  Went immediately back to ER_ just gave me two benadryl and send me home_ where all night long I could not sleep.  the holding breath stopped but still felt like I couldn't get air fully in my lungs. I thought I was dying and I lay there for 8 hours before I called 911 and went back to ER.  4 weeks later my throat still feels like like some pressure_ will NEVER EVER take again.  really made my anxiety disorder worse and scared of happeneing again.,F,32,1  days,9/25/2009Email,Compazine

I thought it was a panic attack & took 2 Vistarils & 2 Xanaxes_  I was scared to death & thought I was dying_ called 911_ ambulance came_paramedics thought it was a panic attack &  and drove me Slowly to the hospital (not where I had surgery).. I felt like jumping out of my skin_ jittery_wanted to pull the Iv out_would have happily shot myself in the head to escape that horrible crazy feeling. The Dr's thought I had od'd on drugs &  told me if I didn't quit crying for help I would be sent to a psychiatric hospital.. refused to treat me. Had CAT scan & said I had blood clot that made me crazy_ gave me Coumadin. I paced the hospital room all night_ ripped my IV out& bled everywhere.All I got was Xanax -didn't help.

I had nausea and vomitting earlier and had been given to start an iv with fluids_ zofran (to control throwing up)_ and an anti-inflamatory shot of toradol. The throwing up had completely stopped but I was still in great pain so I was given an iv shot of only 9% morphine_ compazine_ and a little benadryl. I could feel the pain medicine working for about 5 min. and then it hit me and I was scared for my life. There isn't really a way to describe it I started feeling as if I was at the top of a roller coaster when it gets your belly and you never seem to plane back out. I became aggitated_ jittery_ my skin was crawling from inside out and I had a severe dry mouth. I immediately couldn't find the nurse button so I started caling for my nurse but I couldn't hardly speak it was gibbersih and I sounded like I was having a seizure and my heart was beating out of my chest. The nurse came in and just kept saying your ok sweetie I promise you are ok_ as she began putting me on the ekg and affixed the sticky monitor pads all over me. I thought if I am ok why are you doing this? She said I am just hooking you up to the monitor you are having a reaction to the compazine we see it all the time don't worry there is a cure and kept talking and yes like everyone else I wanted to pull the iv's out but didn't.

251, 1, migraine,This medicine is a nightmare. I came to the hospital with a blood pressure averaging 190 over 110 for some time as well as a migrane. Morphine was administered intraveneously followed by an intravenous administration of compazine. This medicine gave me delerium_ ataxia_ tremors_ as well as a large increase of jittery energy. The nurses were not helpful whatsoever. Fortunately_ the physician overheard my cries for help and then administere diphenhydramine invtravenously. 3 different medicines were administered intraveneously in total; the morphine and compazine interacted with each other in a negative manner. To my understanding_ compazine is a beta blocker while morphine works on mu (opiod) receptors. No doctor in their right mind should use compazine to treat nausea caused by opiods_ synethetic or non-synthetic. Additionally_ I did not make any complaints regarding nausea post morphine administration.

It was a feeling similar to apathy but somehow worse. I was unbearably restless while simultaneously exhausted. Feelings of fear and anxiety were overwhelming. I was terrified the feelings would last forever. This was absolutely the worst experience of my life.","I experienced severe side effects for about 3 days after my one dose of compazine and did not feel like myself for a full week.

The Compozine worked wonderfully. The only side effect was that about 20 minutes after taking it_ I would feel just a little drowsy for about an hour or so. After reading all the negative ratings here I have to wonder: #1 Is this one person with a grudge making multiple negative postings or #2 It seems that many of the negative side effects came after I.V. administration and not oral - could that be the difference?

I couldnt get comfortable and i just wanted to crawl out of my skin.  I couldnt talk_ or even drive.  It was absolutely horrible!  I worked in the ER so I called a nurse I work with and she told me to take benadryl. I did and the symptoms got much much better.  I had the jittery and uncomfortableness for a few days afterwards_ but my migraine was gone!  My recommendation- only use if you are given it with benadryl!

They gave me morphine for the pain and after a couple of hours_ while waiting test results_ they gave me this.  I was not nauseous so it was probably preventative.  Within 10-15 minutes of getting this drug_ I started to get really anxious.  I was taken for a diagnostic test and thought that I was maybe just feeling worried_ but I could not get the feelings to subside.  It got worse and worse and I had to sit up and then pace my room.  Finally the nurse came in and I told her what was going on.  She was great - she knew right away that it was the drug.  They gave me a shot of another drug to counter it - not benadryl because I can't tolerate that.  It worked and within 3-5 minutes I started to feel better.

Within 10 mins. of the Compazine entering my system (I could feel it_ it stung a bit) I had a strong urge to rip out my IV and pace the room_ leave the hospital_ anything to get the restless feeling to go away.  I called the nurse to discharge me asap_ she did but didn't recognize the symptoms.  I told her I was having a bad anxiety attack_ I knew I was being weird but couldn't help it.  I am SO glad I found this_ I thought I was going crazy.  It was so scary_ one minute I was grateful to be in the hospital to be getting rest and be taken care of_ the next I was losing my mind.

I was told I was having a severe reaction which doesnt happen to many but as I see here it happens to more than I thought. It was hell and I make sure every dr. knows that I'm ALLERGIC.

My mom said the first thing I said after 15 minutes of having it was that I wanted to get out of my body.  I couln't ly still in the hospital yesterday and I felt like I wanted to just jump out of a window.  I haven't slept since I got it yesterday at 1:30 and I just got back from my doctor's who gave me Benadryl. This has made it more barable but I am still unable to sleep.  They also gave me toridal which made me tired so needless to say it has been horrific.  I feel like I'm trying to escape from myself.  This website has made me feel a little better though because I know I'm not just crazy and that it will go away even though it doesnt feel like it. And on top of that_the hospital doc's are really stupid because I told them I was allergic to sulfa in medications and Compazine has that too so on top on feeling like I want to die_ i have a rash on my palms and bottoms of my feet.

It felt like my skin was being burned from inside/out!  The nurse flushed the IV site and it still continued for about 5 minutes.  The drug almost immediately worked on the nausea_ I have to say that!  About 10 to 15 minutes later I had a horrible panic attack.  I felt like my skin was crawling and I was going to die.  At one point I seriously considered jumping from the hospital window.  My husband was so shocked with my behavior he immediately called the nurse.  They did not give me benadryl (I did take it the next day once I read this site) and these feelings continued through the night in the hospital.

I thought I would get Demurral_ but assumed since I'm pregnant this was a safer option. I wasn't even GIVEN an option_ they just put it into my IV without even telling me what it was or its side effects. I would have rather suffered through the migraine pain.  As soon as the drug got into my system_ I felt like I entered into hell.  I am just now getting over the SEVERE anxiety.  In the hospital I felt like I was going to FLIP OUT if I didn't get out of there.  I made them discharge me without running the needed tests because I thought the room was closing in on me.  I was completely paranoid_ and felt that way for 2 1/2 days after.  I thought I had been possessed by a demon_ turns out_ I was just poisoned.

My jaw began to clench so tight I thought I would break my own teeth and my neck made my head turn to one side. My boyfriend at the time took me to the campus health center where I began to have my muscles react in the opposite direction_ my jaw opened so wide I thought it would break and my back arched. The entire experience was horrific. Benedryl finally saved me. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.,I am now 47 but I was given this drug when I was 21_ I can't believe it is still on the market if there are this many people with this same reaction.

I had been dealing with frequent nausea from severe acid indestion and I panic whenever I feel like I'm going to vomit so the compazine was most welcome.  It would take an average of 20 to 40 minutes to kick in and always worked.  Sometimes my stomach would feel a little weird_ but I didn't feel sick anymore.,F,31,5  months,1/22/2008,Compazine

I left hospital through a window_ and never signed out (obviously).  I figured that if I were going insane_ I wanted to be alone-forever.,This drug should absolutely be banned.

My mom and my dad's sister both had spasms in their face after taking compazine but since it is a cheaper anti naseau med I decided to take it. I knew that taking benadryl would counter-act the reaction so I took it for a while but since nothing bad happened I stopped taking it. After the benadryl left my system my hands started getting tense and causing me a lot of pain where I had the surgery and I became very irritatble. Later that night my tongue suddenly wouldn't stay in my mouth and my face started to skew. I couldn't stop laughing even though I didn't think it was funny and no one believed I was serious until my back started tensing up sending my head back and my eyes rolled up into my head.

It was 4 miles away via freeway! I was was never so scared in my life. The last 2 miles I was doing nearly 100mph - and couldn't get there fast enough! I was afraid she was going to pass out and suffocate! At the ER the doctor was exceptionally calm. He got an IV of Benadryl started immediately. He said this is a very common reaction - as a matter of fact he had another patient just down the hall with a reaction as well.

Within 45 minutes she was extremely restless and was unable to get into any comfortable position_ she seemed almost like she was having some sort of panic attack and really could not explain what was wrong. I thought it was because she was so exhausted from the migraine pain and vomiting. We were released and she came home_ fell asleep for a few hours but was worse after she woke up.

It was without a doubt the most horrible experience of my life--all from a drug that was just supposed to take away my nausea. The experience lasted for approximately 13 hours  and from what I understand it was a horrific experience for my wife and family as wellto see me basically in a zombie like state for so long without any clear indication if and when I would come out of it.

326, 1, nausea from migraines,I was taking compazine for the nausea from the migraines I was having on top of taking thorazine which was being tried to control my depression & extreme anxiety attacks I was having.  All of a sudden_ I wasn't able to walk without help & couldn't coordinate my hands to feed myself.  I went to the ER at first & they suggested that the compazine might be the cause of the parkinson symptoms.  I stopped the compazine immediately but the symptoms didn't go away.  After a few weeks_ I went to a neurologist & he realized that the thorazine also could cause the same symptoms.  After then stopping the thorazine_ it took almost a month more for the symptoms to finally go away.  Both Compazine & thorazine can cause the parkinson symptoms which was why after stopping the compazine at first_ the symptoms continued until the thorazine was stopped.,I was on the combination for around 6+ months before the parkinson symptoms showed up.  The compazine worked well for the nausea but the side effect was so extreme that it was necessary to find another med that did the same thing with out the extreme reaction.,F,46,6  months,2/16/2007,Compazine
327, 1, Uncontrollable vomiting,I got the drug through an IV since I couldn't keep anything down. I was released_ but back in the ER only a few hours later. Felt like my skin was crawling off my body and I could not stop moving. I had this urge to walk and do yard work_ trying to make it stop. Thought I was going crazy and went completely hysterical. Got some Benadryl back in the ER and was so thankful the doc knew what it was. SCARY STUFF!!,If you have a reaction_ put it on your allergy list_ and make sure you have some Benadryl around just in case.,F,35,1  days,2/11/2007,Compazine
328, 1, nausea and vomiting,"This was given to me through IV.  I immediately started feeling utterly horrible.  Some of the feelings are almost impossible to put into words.  I was incredibly paranoid and thought the person giving the injection was trying to kill me_ and I was angry.  I wanted to kill him.  I told him to STOP giving me the drug_ and not to give me anything else.  I repeated_ ""No more drugs!""  But he ignored me_ of course.  I wanted to pull the IV out_ and I wanted to stab the man with it.  I also wanted to stab myself with it.  I wanted to die.  I felt completely detached from reality; I wasn't real_ and neither was anyone or thing else.  I started hearing voices_ and everyone said there was no one there.  The sensation was that I was a figment of imagination. I was utterly terrified_ and went into a full-blown panic attack about the time they gave me something to knock me out completely.",I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  It didn't even stop my nausea.  I was still unable to eat for another day or two.   It was almost a month since this drug was administered_ and yet when I think about the feelings it induced_ I start to panic all over again.  This drug REALLY messed with my head_ and I think it should be pulled from use.,F,37,1  times,1/25/2007Email,Compazine
329, 1, migraine and nausea,I had it through an IV mixed with benadryl (which I now know is to counteract these side effects) while in the ER. My nausea did fade but I'm not sure if it was because the migraine was fading or because of the Compazine. The side effects though were not worth taking the drug. I immediately felt it going through my veins. I felt my body slow down and for a terrifying moment it got extremely hard to breathe. I felt as if I were suffocating from the inside out_ as if the process of breathing in and out was shutting down.  I know that I panicked some because I became afraid that I was going to die. The numbness focused on the left side of my body; it became difficult to lift my left arm up. My dad was talking to me_ and I had great difficulty coming up with and voicing responses. I managed to roll onto my right side with difficulty still and dozed off so that I could escape the nasty numb feeling. At home_ the numbness and feeling of not being able to sit still continued. I stayed asleep,Find something else for nausea_ the akathesia is not worth it.,F,18,1  times,1/10/2007,Compazine

My jaw was misaligned. Probably other things going on_ but I was most concerned with my face. The tonsillectomy doctor had told my mom this sometimes occurs in patience which don't use their jaw enough after surgery. Fortunately_ my father came home from work and said we're going to the ER. ER doctor knew compazine was the culprit. Two shots of Benadryl did the trick. Jaw was very sore for about 3 days.,Wish the internet was around in 1988!

333, 1, Terrible Migraines,On the evening of March 29th_ 2006_ I started getting a very bad migraine and my mom took me to the emergency room.  He gave me two shots of medicines_ one of them I am also allergic to_ in each butt-cheek.  Then_ he prescribed me compazine to take orally.  Then_ on the evening of March 31st_ 2006_ I realized that my head started twitching to the right and I couldn't control my hand to do my homework.  So_ I got up and told my mom and she said its probably a reaction from the medicine.  So_ I tried to eat my dinner and it started to get worse.  I couldn't control my mouth. As it started to pull the corner of my mouth_ I put my down and got up and called my from her room.  I told her something was wrong.  She looked at me and she thought I was having a stroke or something.  As she rushed me to the emergency room_ again_ it kept getting worse.

After that_ I started shaking_ starting with my jaw and all the way down to my legs. The shaking got so uncontrolable that I was moving the gurney. The nurse had asked if I was cold but I could barely answer ""No"". I had to have a shot of benadryl and 2 other drugs to stop the reaction.",It did take away the nausea but after a reaction like this I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone.,M,21,1  times,12/2/2006,Compazine

They gave me a small 25mg dose of Benadryl to help ease the side effects but it wasn't enough. The doctor wouldn't let me have any more so they pretty much just tied me to my hospital bed and let me thrash around for next 6 hrs or so. Related drugs such as Reaglan have the same effect. In the 25 years I've been batteling cancer though they have come a long ways from the barbaric dark ages of Compazine. Modern medicine such as Anzamet and others help a lot more and have far less agravating side effects.,,M,30,3  times,11/28/2006,Compazine

I am taking it only as needed rather than as a regular maintenance dose.","I believe that this site gives an exaggerated opinion of Compazine's side effects because people with bad experiences are more likely to post a rating than people with good experiences.

This feeling slowly intensified until I felt like my body was trying break out of my skin.  My cogitive functions became depressed and I generally felt like I was in hell_ not being able to feel comfortable in any position.  My limbs felt like they were moving at 100 mi/hr despite the fact that I was lying still wondering what the hell was going on.

345, 1, nausea from kidney infection,Immediate feelings of terror and feelings of numbness swept rapidly through my body. I felt as if I had been poisoned and was going to die. Became intolerant of noise and had feelings of uncontrollable rage. I became severely agitated and_ paranoid_ thinking that the nurse who gave me the drug was trying to kill me. Violent urges and a feeling of being completely out of control. Strange hallucinatory effect of seeing what looked like tiny traintracks on my ex's skin.,This drug was given to me intravenously in a hospital without my consent. I had a kidney infection and was pretty sick. My ex insisted that I go to the ermergency room. The staff assumed that the infection must have been making me feel nauseous but I actually did not feel sick to my stomach at all. I even told staff this when they asked if I had any nausea symptoms.

I had been pretty sick and had passed out due to dehydration. I don't remember if they gave me any compazine at the hospital_ but I did take one on my own the next day at home. Anyway_ a few hours later I slowly noticed that I couldn't form my words correctly - I was slurring my speech and had a lisp. It was strange_ so I didn't mention it to anyone and just didn't say much out of embarrassment. I thought maybe I was tired. But it got worse and within a few hours_ my lower jaw had slowly pulled itself over to one side of my face. By the time I got to the ER_ the lower half of my face was contorted very violently and painfully where I felt as though the tendons were tearing.

My parents thought it was a reaction from the codeine.  At the hospital they did blood work and the doctor had no idea what was wrong with me.  Finally one of the head nurses came over to me and realized I was on compazine.  She had seen that reaction once before.  It had to be the scariest thing ever.
