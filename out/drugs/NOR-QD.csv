9, 4, breastfeeding and birth control,This medication was great when I was breastfeeding.  I didn't notice a difference in the amount of milk I produced.  There were no negative side effects.  I took this birth control after the birth of my first son and then again after the birth of my second son.  I nursed each for a little over a year.  Once I stopped nursing I could no longer take it because I had almost continous break through bleeding.  When on the combo pill I usually get migraines_ with this pill I would get occasional headaches_ but nothing severe.,,F,29,2  days,3/15/2008Email,Nor-qd
