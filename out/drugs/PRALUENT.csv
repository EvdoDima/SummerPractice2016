0, 5, High Cholesterol,Amazing decrease in all cholesterol levels except LDL_ which went down.  With three injections_ one every two weeks_ my total cholesterol went from 222 to 107!,Fantastic drug.  Couldn't take statins because of muscle pain side effect.  Been on this drug for two months and it's fantastic.  Only side effects are a day of a runny nose after injection_ that's it.
