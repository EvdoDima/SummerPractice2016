0, 5, Migraines,nasal congestion,Migranal nasal spray works much better for me than any triptan and the only side effect is nasal congestion. Gets rid of headaches totally about 99% of the time.,F,34,1  years2 mg 1X D,9/7/2011Email,Migranal
1, 1, Migraine have a few times a week,Severe nasal congestion_ nausea_ muscle soreness,I took this for the first time today to try something other than imatrex nasal spray which I have no side effects from. I took it at 1pm and fell asleep_ woke up and was running a fever and threw up. Then at 3pm I started getting nasal congestion so bad I was gagging. Now 7pm and it's worse.,F,33,1  days1 2X D,1/24/2011,Migranal
2, 2, migraine,vomiting_ bad taste_ nasal congestion,I took the first dose as the box said and then again 15 minutes later. I still had a horrible taste in my mouth for hours afterward. It did cure my headache_ but an hour later I was wretching my guts out. Not sure whether I would prefer the migraine or the vomiting? And my nasal passages were inflamed for the rest of the evening.,F,30, ,3/16/2008,Migranal
3, 3, frequent migraines,extreme muscle soreness within 12 hours of taking migranal.,soon after takign migranal my headache would get really bad_ but after a nap_ my headaches were completely gone. However_ soon after_ I would experience extreme muscle soreness and stiffness. I thought it would be a one time thing_ but I took Migranal atleast 10 times with the same side effects.,F,24,3  months,10/27/2007,Migranal
4, 2, migraine,I really didn't have any trouble with side effects; it just didn't work very well or very reliably.,If you need quick relief_ get your doctor to prescribe the injectable form_simply DHE. First_ it's generic_ and_ therefore_ cheap. Next_ it starts working very quickly_ and usually eradicates even a bad migraine in less than an hour.  Sometimes_ I have to take a second dose_ but only the very worst migraines are resistant to the injectable DHE_,F,40,4  years,2/14/2007,Migranal
5, 3, For migraine headaches,No side effects to speak of.,If you don't spray it properly you may have it go down your throat which does not work to alleviate the head pain.  My doctor said to take a deep breath and then swallow - as I spray each nostril I close the opposite nostril and then pinch both nostrils shut with my head pointing down a bit for a few minutes.  I wait 15 minutes to do the second dose.,F,49,1  months,1/2/2007Email,Migranal
6, 3, migraine,bitter aftertaste_ nasal stuffiness,marginally effective_ for me triptans (Imitrex) work better_ expensive per dose_ use as an adjunct to other abortive meds such as triptans_ norflex (muscle relaxant)_ and depakene (anti-convulsant),M,49,1  weeks,5/4/2006Email,Migranal
