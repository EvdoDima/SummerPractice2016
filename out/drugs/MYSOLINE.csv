1, 1, epilepsy,extreme suicidal depression_ lack of apetite_ very bad sleepiness,almost lost my life to this stuff; drs. did not tell me it was related to phenobarbitol which I got too depressed to take.  Recovered my mood once I was off it.,F,51,12  yearsdo not rem 2X D,1/23/2011,Mysoline
2, 5, Epilepsy,I was originally prescribed phenobarbital as a 12 year old_ but it made me too sleepy.  Dr. switched me to mysoline at 13 which has had no side effects to mention.,I have lived virtually seizure free most of my life except when off my medication.  I have had only one seizure in 13 years and that was the result of a new neurologist taking me off mysoline in 1997.  I had a seizure after 4 days without medication. I had gone seizure free for 11 years prior to that. I have been able to live a full life and accomplish my goals due to this medication. I took the name brand until it got too expensive and have been on generic for the last 5 years,M,55,42  years250 3X D,9/20/2010Email,Mysoline
3, 4, ,familial (essential) hand tremor,started with 25mg daily for couple of days_ then morning and bedtime_ then 50mg daily etc_ then titrated up to 250 am and bedtime.  Face feels flushed_ headache a lot but tremor is lessened.  Don't know if I want to increase it more or not at this point.  Will discuss with neurologist.  I doubt there will be any added benefit by increasing dosage vs side effects. For those still searching suggest www.essentialtremor.org for detailed info.,M,73,3  months,1/11/2009Email,Mysoline
4, 2, essential tremer,drowsiness_ confusion_ unsteadiness_ losing words_ so slowed down mentally I feel stupid and can't function,I am taking 200 mg a day and it hasn't helped my tremor at all.  I can't take inderal because my blood pressure is already too low. I'm trying to give it a chance_ but I can't live like this much longer.,F,48,1  months,6/14/2008,Mysoline

7, 5, epilepsy,none,After my diagnosis in 1999_ I spent years trying different drugs that had side effects I couldn't tolerate. This drug has worked perfectly for me. Ironically_ my Dad_ who is a GP_ tells me that Mysoline is a step away from the phenobarbitol I was given for a time as a young child.,F,45,6  years,2/1/2008,Mysoline
8, 5, Epilepsy,some headaches,I have been taking this medication to control myoclonic seizures_ I take a small dose and it works very well in controlling them.  I got pregnant a year after taking it and continued to take it throughout the pregnancy. The doctor thought the worst thing that would happen to the baby would be a cleft palate or lip.  I had preterm labor with my first baby_ but not as bad as with my second.  Not sure if the medication caused this or it I would have had it anyway.  But I do have 2 very healthy babies_ without any side effects from the meds. I was also able to nurse both of them for a least a year each.,F,27,5  years,5/3/2007Email,Mysoline
9, 3, essential tremor,dulled down_ extreme exhaustion about 5 hours after taking it_ intensifies the effect of alcohol,I am a reasearcher and take mysoline to do laboratory work.  I took inderal first_ but I have asthma and it ended up exacerbating my asthma. Anyway_ mysoline does help a little_ I found I take 12.5 mg (1/4 of a pill) 2 hours before what I am doing and it helps - but I need be done before five hours or I become stupid and screw up my experiments.  I once took it once a week for an ongoing experiment for 12 or so weeks and I do think by the end the side effects improved.  I really wish I could just take inderal.  That is a great drug for the shakes. Note_ I take this drug as needed.,F,27,4  years,11/4/2006Email,Mysoline
