0, 5, Facial Acne,None,Best acne medication I've ever used! I've tried 26 different acne medications (including proactive) before I tried Aczone. This was the only one that worked! I was prescribed this by a doctor and not a dermatologist! No reactions_ and I'm allergic to benzyl peroxide so it's hard to find acne medication that does not include this. Best drug in the world!,F,17,6  yearsDime size 1X D,8/22/2014Email,Aczone
1, 2, Acne,Dry skin but manageable,Saw little to no improvement with this cream after 3 months. It didn't make it worse_ though.,F,25,3  months5 mg 1X D,8/10/2013,Aczone

4, 5, acne-jawline/forehead/chin/chest,NONE! I was surprised too- because all of the other topicals I've used usually will dry my skin out or irritates my skin. This does NOT!!!! It actually reduced my redness and I am less oily when I use Aczone! It's amazing!,this new medicine works fast- if you use it day and night after you cleanse your face. my pimples were red_ tender_ some pus-filled and within a week Aczone Gel 5% was working on my the redness and tenderness associated with my acne. It goes well under makeup and doesn't dry me out like Benzoyl Peroxide combos. I can use on my chest acne and as much as I want without irritation_ even when I use with other products! It's a no-brainer- it works and my go-to!!!,F,26,6  months60 2X D,9/6/2010,Aczone
