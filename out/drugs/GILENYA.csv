13, 4, MS,Breathing problems (2 weeks)Weight gain (10 months)Receding MS related symptoms,Initial side effects were trouble breathing_ similar to chest pains or a slight asthma attack for about 2 weeks.

Also I gained 15 pounds the first month with no change to diet or exercise.  Two months later I lost almost 10 of it_ again_ no change in diet or exercise.  Since then I keep gaining.

Its only been three weeks but I dont feel like I am walking around with that lead jacket any longer...Still have my MS related spasms and ""electrical shocks"" but none of those ""flu like"" sysmptoms or red blotches any longer...Hopefully wont grow a third eye in a few years !! LOL   but seriously_ I would recommend to anyone with MS",M,45,3  weeks 1X D,3/6/2011Email,Gilenya
16, 4, RRMS,GOT FAT,It seems to be working.  Beforehand_ I had experienced 3 exacerbations within 5 months while taking Copaxone.  I haven't had any attacks in the 5 months since starting Gilenya. No side effects at all. HOWEVER_ alot of weight seemed to appear out of nowhere...and quickly attach to my hips :(  And when I say alot_ I mean +/-30 pounds_ which is significant. I can't say FOR SURE that it's from this medicine_ but I can't find any other cause.  I suppose it's still better than the alternative--I choose fatness over numbness.  If you are considering this drug_ take heart; I seem to be the exception rather than the rule.  Weight gain is not considered to be a side effect_ so please don't let my experience stop you from trying Gilenya--it could change your life!,F,42,5  months12.5mg 1X D,2/28/2011Email,Gilenya
