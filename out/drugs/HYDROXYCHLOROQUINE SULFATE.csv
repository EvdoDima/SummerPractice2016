0, 4, SLE & SS not drug induced,In 2005 I was administered this pill at full strength.  Soon after I got a shoulder rash and some blurry vision at BREAKFAST time when I would take the pill.  Was told not to take it soon after.,"Since late 2015 I eat with food and drink at nearly same time--LUNCH time.  I gradually increased from 50 to 100 to 200mg.  Include eating dark leafy greens cooked every week to MAINTAIN vision.Still continuing and I hope it suppresses my immune system so that I can ""slow down"" and increase WBC.  During 1997 I was checked by an MD and was told I could get SLE_ SS_ RA from having low WBC.",F,60, 200 1X D,3/20/2016,Hydroxychloroquine sulfate
