0, 1, BCc,Trouble breathing_  and horrible weakness. I have never felt this bad in all my life. Can't get my strength back.,It works_ but I guess it's different for everyone. I wouldn't use it again.,F,59,6  weeks5 mg.,7/8/2016Email,Aldara
1, 5, HPV,Itching_ redness_ flakiness.,My treatment includes TCA and Aldara. I use the Aldara as directed and apply a small amount directly to the areas that need it 3 times a week and rub it in until you can't see the cream_ per the directions. I'm not sure why the consensus of many people seems to be that clearing up warts should be symptom free and painless. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.I got the expected redness_ itching_ and flakiness expected when healing up an abnormal skin condition. Also_ the cream is working quickly in conjunction with the TCA treatment.I have zero abnormal or unexpected side effects.,F,29,3  weeks 3X W,6/27/2016,Aldara

3, 2, hpv,I was diagnosed with hpv in my anal areaAfter about 10 freezing treatments and the outcome bleak I was put on this creamI was somewhat disappointed as I was expecting a bit of discomfort to give me an Indication of whether or not this aldara treatment is working but had nothing till the second week and then the only thing ive had is pain in my groin glands and a tiny bit of itching but im unsure if its the cream working on the hpv or the hpv multiplying as ive recently felt a new wart. Im only the second week so I shall continue_ tonight is my 5th application ive read tbis cream is more responsive in females than males and can take along has 16 weeks. So as if yet im staying positive and carrying on. If this cream is uncomfortable I can imagine people will feel shite excuse my french. But isnt the short term discomfort worth it for ur sex life and to make you feel attractive again? I have no clue who gave me this but I curse them everyday my advice us its 16 weeks of hell if you have a reaction but atleast u know its working. I have no idea yet an that does my tree in.Im assuming it is having some effect as my groin glands are  tender so fingers crossedUnless you plan on being a nun or priest guys id advise complete treatment,I rated not satisfied only as I cant tell if its working yet,M,32,10  days,5/25/2016Email,Aldara
4, 2, GW,Extreme fatigue_ migraine_ depression_ anxiety attacks,The burning sensations whilst uncomfortable was manageable.

5, 2, Gw,Swelling_ rash_ intense pain_ hypersensitive to pee/water as if I have several cuts down there_ bleeding.,My treatment involves both freezing and using Aldara after to speed up the process to rid gw. First time I used Aldara_ only had mild irritation. Was grateful not to have experienced the possible side effects mentioned by my doctor. However_ after my last freezing session_ I used Aldara for 3x a week and after my 3rd application_ it began to swell and itch. A few days have passed since my last Aldara application but the swelling only got worse and adding more side effects to it. The itching was replaced by unbearable pain despite taking NSAIDs. I started bleeding and my inner folds of my vagina is clearly inflamed as well. I used the cream really sparingly every time! So I don't understand why it is acting up when I was fine with it before. It's really bad. I'd recommend just go with freezing only. It isn't as painful as the side effects I'm experiencing from Aldara.,F,,1  weeks,5/4/2016,Aldara

7, 1, BCC on chest,This is an update to an entry I submitted on 9/10/2014. Unfortunately I cannot seem to update my original post. I had been advised to used Aldara once daily for 5 days per week for a total of 6 weeks.I had severe symptoms of fever_ dizziness_ muscle aches and feeling teary. I stopped using Aldara upon my doctors orders due to the severity of the physical wound- the size of a 50 cent piece_ even though I had been very cautious to use the bare minimum of cream to a BCC not much larger than a grain of rice.,I stopped using this cream after week 5 and hoped my symptoms would abate- they did not. It has been 19 months since I used Aldara. The dizziness I developed while using Aldara has never totally gone. I also developed tinnitus so consulted an ENT who diagnosed ATYPICAL Ménière's disease. I do not suffer rotational spinning (typical to Ménière's)_ rather a constant disequilibrium_ like having been on a boat too long. It's exhausting and has affected every aspect of my life. I have questioned doctors as to whether this could have been caused by Aldara_ all have said no_ even though it came on at the same time I was using it. All doctors have said even the flu like symptoms I was experiencing were unrelated to Aldara (they had never heard of that despite it being noted as a side effect!) -that I must have had a virus! In the past 19 months I have spoken to others that have used Aldara. Some who have experienced no ill effects whatsoever_ and some like myself who have_ in our opinions_ had our lives screwed up to varying degrees because of this drug. To others reading this and considering using this as a treatment_ consider ALL of your treatment options before making a decision.I thought a topical cream would be a safe_ non invasive form of treatment. But to me_ Aldara is a horror of a drug wrapped up with a pretty name.,F,49,5  weeks 1X D,4/3/2016Email,Aldara

10, 3, HPV Genital Warts,My balls are in agony.Soreness_ blistering and dryness.,I've been using Aldara for just over 3 weeks_ every two days. I have ten warts_ all about the size of a pin head (thanks_ ex!). The two largest warts have nearly gone but I still have a few around the base of my penis. I made what seems to be a common mistake and used too much cream in an attempt to speed up the process.Mistake. Woke at 4am with a fire in my groin and it's been like that since. Can't sit down or work. I have a line of five sore_ open blisters on my scrotum and all I can do is lay in bed with my legs open.My fault for going a bit gung-ho with this stuff but I didn't expect a reaction like this. I've been feeling sick and depressed for a few days too_ but I'm not sure if I can blame that on Aldara or my love life.,M,41,3  weeks.5mg x2 d 1X D,3/21/2016Email,Aldara
11, 1, GW,This medicine was absolutely awful. I experienced extreme pain and ulcerations that developed from using this cream. I missed 2 days of work because of the pain. It felt like I was peeing razor blades. My labia became so swollen that I couldn't urinate. My doctor told me it WAS NOT a reaction to the cream and that I had genital herpes despite blood tests coming back negative. Needless to say I am firing my doctor.

Run from this cream.,,,30,3  months,3/7/2016,Aldara
14, 1, GW,Please be SO so so careful and fully informed before using this cream! Absolutely fuming_ when I was prescribed this medication the nurse did not inform me at all of the risks...she told me to dab bits on the warts_ not rub it in and wash off whenever i wake up. All she explained was it helps fight the virus. Due to being completely uninformed I applied the cream to the warts_ got dressed for bed and went to sleep.In the morning I have not experienced pain like it_ its excruciating. Every part of my vagina has swelled up and it is completely unrecognizable_ it is red raw and when I urinate it is like urinating razor blades. My vagina skin is purple_ blue and black. I held an iced pack wrapped in a towel as pain relief and co-codamol which helped slightly. Things seemed to be improving today with less pain but still ridiculous swelling... when suddenly i started bleeding and my skin has burst in places. I cant move/walk. I am so upset because if the nurse had taken the time to explain,Once everything settles down_ i will build up the courage to use it in the correct way. It is so frustrating that a health professional has not informed me correctly and it has resulted in this. Its not the kind of medication to just lather on AT all which I thought it was. Make sure you are very well informed before considering using this dangerous cream.,F,20,3  days1 month 3X W,2/28/2016,Aldara

Unfortunately_ I had a shoulder surgery and as that healed up fast_ my warts came back. Treating them now. It is only one wart that sprouted. As opposed to the first occurrence which was about 5.

19, 3, GW,"Ok_ I'm really hoping this helps someone.  I started taking Aldara for a flat wart (I couldn't even see it or feel it but it was itchy). After 5 days (every night before bed)_ I was a horrible mess; severe pain_ blisters_ bleeding_ oozing_ swelling_ scabbing_ severe back pain and horrible headaches.  I couldn't walk_ or go to the bathroom / shower & laid in bed crying for 3 days.  I basically ""burned my vagina off."" I stopped using it and began using Lydicane_ Triple Antibiotic Ointment with pain relief and Vivadin for the pain.  It took about 5 days before I was completely back to normal.  DO NOT USE ANY OTHER KINDS OF RELIEF OR STEROIDS- it'll make it worse. And even though one Dr. said it ""looked"" like a Herpes outbreak_ it wasn't.   Now my original symptoms are back even though everything looks completely normal.  My Dr. has me trying it again only 2-3 times a week.  So far_ so good.  Here's what I'm doing: only use a little bit and only on the spot(s) necessary.  Prior to application_ put Vaseline around all the other areas to protect it_ and again_ just a little bit on the area needed.  I'll follow up when I'm done_ but I've been told 3 months.  Good luck!! It will get better!",,F,33,1  weeks,12/12/2015,Aldara
20, 3, Anal Warts,Itching_ Soreness_ Sensitivity,I have just finished week 3 out of 4 week treatment plan. I think overall the warts around my anus have reduced in size and look as though they could be getting better however i think it will take more than the 4 weeks. Had to miss a treatment in week 2 as area around anus was very painful and even hurt when having shower/bath.No feelings of nausea or headaches.A lot of negativity on this thread_ I think the important thing is to keep your doctor updated on the process and not to give up if the treatment you have been given doesn't work. If this treatment doesn't work for you then tell a doctor. Having GW makes you feel uncomfortable and disgusting and can make you feel depressed. DON'T LET IT.

I'm about to start my third week on Imiquimod_ and my semi-large wart is all but gone.  It just vanished_ almost overnight!  My doctor recommended taking a multivitamin with folic acid in it_ and I think that helped a lot too (I have a horrendous immune system_ and folic acid boosts it).  I also second that you don't need to use a lot of cream.  I got 6 uses_ or two full weeks_ out of one packet_ and obviously I'm having a ton of improvement.,F,23,2  weeks 3X W,10/22/2015,Aldara

I could not urinate without experiencing terrible pain_ It even hurt to walk_move and sleep at night. I wish I would have looked at the reviews before using this medicine.

26, 5, Genital warts,Irritation and itching.,I had a bout of several genital warts_ all spaced all over my genital area (clitoris included people.) After having read about this treatment on line_ I was so scared that I did not use it for about two weeks but for me the liquid nitrogen was way too painful_ especially on my lady button.I really want to spread this news as much as possible; EVERYBODY REACTS DIFFERENTLY. Please_ please do not be discouraged. I am very sensitive to pain (translation_ wimp. I also tend to react very easily to things) and have gone through this with no burning sensations_ absolute no side-effects like the flu symptoms and/or headaches etc. aside expected sensitivity and by the first week of use I noticed a considerable difference.DOSAGE:I do not know if the frequency with which people are using it is what is causing problems but I will note what I did;-3 times per week on alternating days e.g. Monday_ Wednesday and Friday-Left on for no less than 6 hours and no longer than 10 (I always left it on for 8-10)-The first week I used it certain areas got very sensitive so I put off using it for a week (perhaps leaving it for a week let it do its work instead of bombarding my system)-After the week of rest I went back to using it for a week_ then left it for TWO weeks due to sensitivity(Warts are all practically gone by this point except a tiny remnant)I have now just finished the three sachets for the third week of treatment and am wart-free.Do take into account that people,F,22,3  weeks250mg 3X W,8/15/2015,Aldara
27, 1, Genital Warts,Worst pain in my entire life. If you are reading this and your doctors have given you this do not put this on your genitals. Myself and my boyfriend have had flu like symptoms and then severe burns on our genitals. I cannot pee or walk or even sit without being in pain. I have been prescribed numbing gel from my doctor yet this has only caused more stinging. On inspection I have noticed blisters forming that are now unbarable in any position. It is ruining my life. I would rather suffer with the warts than go through this again. DO NOT USE ALDARA. Instead go through cryotherphy which is what I intend to do when or if my vulva returns to normal. This virus has affected me hugely and after thinking I was going to be cured and instead slammed me with these excruiciating,pains_ is heartbreaking. NEVER USE ALDARA. Even as sparingly as I did it has taken 3 applications with more than 4 days inbetween each one for this 'cure' to ruin my vagina. DO NOT USE this_ it is not worth the risk. Go for freezing the warts_ that pain is minute compared to what I am feeling.,,20,  3X W,7/15/2015,Aldara
28, 5, HPV Genital Warts,I had some swelling and minor irritation/redness near my labia (burning) but nothing unbearable like many of the testimonials I read prior to starting the drug. The key is to use a TINY amount on the tip of a Q-tip or toothpick and applying it SPARINGLY to the wart. I sit with my legs spread open so it has time to dry and won't spread to other unaffected areas.,This is 100% a miracle cream. I had about 4 GWs and was mortified at their formation. I applied before bed 3x weekly (every other day) and all GWs miraculously disappeared within 2 weeks - about 6 applications. Thankfully I have a drug plan that covered the entire cost because I hear it is extremely expensive when purchased outright. Even if you have to purchase it you can get by on very few packets if you use sparingly. I was GW free for 5 months and just noticed 2 new ones appear_ so am restarting treatment with leftover packets (that aren't expired). I'm hopeful that their disappearance will be just as fast as last time.,F,27,3  weeks30mg 3X W,7/6/2015,Aldara
29, 5, GW,Burning_ Itchy_ flu like symptoms,I promised myself that I would write here if it all went well because I like to be positive! And for anyone that is about to use this cream for GW please know that it will be painful but it will be worth it!!! I saw a reduction of the warts immediately. I obviously put too much cream since I was desperate to get rid of them and got horrible flu like symptoms but I just went on about my day because I figured it was the cream and normally you get a fever when you have a cold to kill the virus (that's the bodies mechanism) so in a weird way I was happy I was having side effects it meant it was working! At times I got discouraged because I felt like they would come back. I had to skip some of the treatments since my genial area was on fire super swollen and burned so bad_ I knew adding more cream would cause other serious problems down there. So I would put desitin and that would help a lot. Since most of the warts had cleared up I only used a little bit of cream only on the warts but to be honest I would put it all over to be safe. I figured out a way to help the rest of the skin not to get hurt by the cream so I would break a cotton ball and line it around the inside of my v*** so that only the lips had the cream on. In a month or so I am all cleared!!! I never gave up and even when I could barely see them I still finished the whole treatment.,F,25,1  months,6/25/2015,Aldara

31, 3, GW,Chemical burns - very painful,I saw a lot of comments here and wanted to help. Doctors should be advising to administer very tiny amounts to the specific areas - use a cotton bud. If you mess up and apply too much it could be very painful. If you have a lot of pain and chemical burn situation you need to stop using it until it clears up. A lot people have been asking what they can do to speed up healing for the chemical burns they got from Aldara. I bathed the area in salt water 2 or 3 times a day and put aloe gel (not cream) on the area. This REALLY helped. For a while I was really worried and freaking out. The GWs all cleared up. The whole experience has been pretty terrible - the pain of chemical burns is unimaginable. Luckily it wasn't as bad as some of the situations I read about here. You have to be SO CAREFUL with this stuff. If you start getting burns STOP USING IT. Use Aloe gel to soothe the pain and accelerate healing. If you still need to use the Aldara be very careful and be sure to use only on the GWs in very small amounts.,M,25,7  days1MG 3X W,6/20/2015,Aldara

Joint pain_ runny nose_ occasional insomnia that is unaffected by Lunesta and clonipan_ hives on untreated areas.,I am using Aldara on two large BCC areas_ one on the left shoulder and one on the right back/shoulder areas. The left shoulder is where I have had the most problems. The original bcc was approximately 6cm by 6 cm. the inflamed and areas of rash now covers an area of 12.5 x 12.5. I have a number of other medical issues including recent surgery for a double inguinal hernia_ a number of other bccs that have been removed by MOHs and other conventional surgical procedures. I am also on various medications for PTSD and severe major depression and elevated cholesterol (something new but probably attributable to non- Aldara medications). Recently I have suffered occasional insomnia_ a previous issue taken care of by medication_ but the new bought_ if caused by Aldara_ defeats all sleeping meds.  I have also recently begun experiencing joint and hip pain. My dermatologist keeps telling me to keep the affected areas covered in Vaseline_ but this seems to exacerbate the problem. My main concern with the amount of Aldara I use Dailey (2 packets/ .5 grams) that I I may suffer permanent side effects. I am willing to continue because_ if it works_ it will allow me to avoid surgery and grafting in a difficult location. I will update this blog after my remains 2 to 3 month therapy remaining.

42, 1, Vulvar dysplasia from HPV,I was prescribed aldara for mild vulvar dysplasia causing painful intercourse. I was having painful intercourse with my husband and went to the GYN. She did a bopsy and said I have mild vaginal dysplasia caused by HPV. I had no warts or lesions. She prescribed aldara to the area of biopsy/pain 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The only thing she told me was to wash it off after 8-10 hours with mild soap because it can cause irritation. After I had used aldara for 3 applications_ I had a severe headache_ fever_ body aches_ and fatigue. I thought I had a virus so I kept using it.

43, 5, AK,Redness_ overnight itching on application nights_ burning_ sores and scabs in infected areas,I just completed the whole 16 week regimen. It seems_ for me_ there was a big response in the earlier weeks with overall redness and scabbing quite pronounced. After the tenth week or so_ the skin was mostly soft and healed_ with smaller sections around the fringes still reacting (perhaps due to spreading the medicine more after the worst areas were cleared). The last four weeks or so were pretty much a non-event. The skin areas that were affected are cosmetically nicer than before; but_ more importantly_ the AKs are gone. Time will tell how long this will last_ but at least the few scaly growths are not present. Clearly_ some seem to bail early in the treatment. I would encourage you to tough it out as the end is worth the inconvenience.,M,55,16  weeks 2X W,10/24/2014,Aldara

They are so painful that I can't get out of bed and I take 800 mg of ibuprofen during the day and Hydrocodon to sleep.

45, 2, Genital warts,I'm having a horrible experience with aldara. I partly blame the doctor for this. I got diagnosed with genital warts over a month ago and they tried freezing a couple of times which didn't do anything_ so they gave me the cream. I got told to put the cream on 3 nights in a row every week and to put it 'all over' and was not warned of any side effects. I'm now in agony having one of the worst experience of my life. But i know it's because i've been using it wrong_ clearly i have overdosed now i'm suffering extreme pain_ can't move from my bed had to call in sick at work_ i can't pee_ they are oozing liquid and it smells horrible. PLEASE make sure you use it correctly_ i had no idea this would happen nor the importance of not overdosing. Apparently this is a sign it is working in fighting the virus though_ i plan on leaving it for a coupl or weeks till it settles then going back to it correctly_ so it may work yet.,,F,19,7  days,10/5/2014,Aldara
46, 5, Genital warts,3 weeks using Aldara now. Skipped a couple doses in the middle due to soreness. Wasn't bad at all_ just being extra cautious considering all the horror stories on here. I'm applying 3 nights a week. Had prob fifteen perianal warts_  a few quite large. As of last night I have 2 tiny warts left. All the others are GONE. THIS STUFF Works. Just don't get greedy and slather the stuff on any more than 3 nights a week or you're running the risk of some serious side effects. Be patient_ use common sense_ take a break if needed_ and this stuff works wonders.,,M,27,3  weeks,9/23/2014,Aldara
47, 5, AK,Redness_ sores_ scabbing on forehead_ cheeks and around eyebrows (treated areas). Earlier weeks_ when the response was more pronounced_ general fatigue the day after application.,I was originally hesitant to use_ based on some of what I read about side effects. Clearly_ the first six to seven weeks were rough. But_ I just kept going since I understood that the more the visual signs_ the more the hidden damage that was being exposed. Truth be told_ I shudder to think about all of those ticking time bombs that were not visible (there were perhaps three visible AK areas before I started treatment and the treatment exposed dozens more). For those that may be interested_ the payoff at the end is clearly the end of those abnormal cells. But_ for those that may be interested_ if you continue on the treatment_ you will have soft_ baby like skin after the regimen. I can't say it's been a panacea to me_ but my wife loves touching the soft skin now. Basically_ there is a cosmetic upside that some would consider worth the pain by itself. Would do this again.,M,55,16  weeks 2X W,9/22/2014,Aldara
48, 5, GWs,Irritation in treatment area. Oozing of clear fluid. Muscle aches.,It's me again! One of the things I hated when reading was people who posted during their first couple weeks and stopped. I wanted to hear from people thru the whole treatment. So I decided I will do that. I am now at 7 weeks. All of the original warts are gone. I have a appt with Doc next week. He gave me no instructions to stop before then so I won't. The treatment area expanded as time went on because as areas got red on the perimeter of the treatment area I expanded the area thinking there was virus there. I now have a large treatment area and it is inflamed but not unbearable. There is oozing of clear liquid from some spots. Lots of dry skin and pealing. On treatment day I soak in the pool and then use my finger and literally scrape the dead skin away prior to new treatment. I believe I am wart free now but will post after my doctor appt and again later to let you know about the healing process.,M,55,7  weeks 3X W,9/15/2014,Aldara

Diagnosed with a bcc on my chest_ I was prescribed this with no mention of side effects other than scabbing at application site. Applied for 5 days on_ 2 days off. At week 3 started to feel unwell_ by week 5 I felt like death. Went back to the doctor who discontinued use. I have been off it for a week now but still the flu like symptoms persist- if anything they are getting worse. Extreme fatigue and body aches and very teary_ not like me at all.

50, 5, GW,I started using aldara cream on Monday for genital warts_ I have quite a few small warts like skin tags on different areas of my vagina. I wanted to write this review to give others some hope_ because I know when I got diagnosed I didn't have any hope at all. After seeing various doctors and reading a lot online I've come to the conclusion that hpv isn't for life. If you have a healthy diet and strong immune system then you can get rid of this virus quite easily_ yes it may take time and it may return but it isn't forever! I used the aldara on Monday and Wednesday_ today is now Friday and I have my 3rd treatment tonight. Slight burning but nothing major. I think the trick is to only apply a tiny bit of the cream_ if you use too much you'll have bad burning and itching(used too much on Monday) my warts have gone down massively in the few days that I've used this cream_ if the treatment continues to work like this I would gladly recommend this cream to anyone! I also starting taking immune system enhancers which I assume are helping too. If it isn't working as fast for you then I advice to stick with it_ finish the 4 week treatment and see what the doctor has to say after that.,,F,21,4  days3 per week,9/5/2014,Aldara
51, 5, GWs,Side effects started to subside after 3 weeks. Only had sore and inflamed skin.,I'm the one who wrote on 8/20. It is now one week later. All of the warts are either gone or crusted up and are days from being gone. In the last week something interesting happened. That is that the skin is no longer sensitive and painful. It is almost as if it is healing during treatment. The areas where the warts were is still red or purple. But the warts seem to be gone. So for me it was 3 weeks of discomfort and then it went away. My follow up with the doc is in 4 weeks. He never said I could stop before then so I guess I will just continue the treatments up to 4-5 days before the appt and let everything heal so he can get a good look. At this time I believe that I'll be clear at 5 weeks and the doc will suspend treatment at 8 weeks.,M,55,4  weeks 3X W,8/27/2014,Aldara
52, 4, GWs,Soreness around coverage area.,Today is exactly 3 weeks for me. I have a few warts in a cluster on the scrotum and then 2 other areas on the shaft with a cluster of 4-5 warts. The redness and tenderness was certainly uncomfortable but not as much misery as others have said. After the 2nd application the skin under the treated areas literally pealed off leaving the underneath very raw. I waited 3 days and let it heal then resumed and at this point the areas are red and tender but the warts are diminishing. All of the warts are black scabs or have disappeared.  The thing I did notice however was that I would develop red/purple areas in places that weren't being treated. My doc said this stuff goes into the skin and surrounding skin so I guess I wasn't surprised to see this. I think this may be what other's have said that more warts developed on this treatment. I don't think these are warts but possibly areas of the virus where future warts would develop. The areas were never raised and I could not feel a bump. Just a red or purple area about the size of a pimple. There are about a dozen of these and I expect them to clear up during or shortly after treatment.My doctor said this was a 16 week treatment but then as I was leaving he said 16 weeks or shorter. I have a appointment at 8 weeks_ 5 weeks from today_ but as I look at the progress so far and read others who said 3-4 weeks cleared it up_ I'm not sure if I should stop when I see no more warts or continue putting this stuff on.,M,55,3  weeks 3X W,8/20/2014,Aldara

The cream has bought up three spots on my nose and also a few on the tops of my cheeks.

Wash it off after you wake up and DO NOT leave it on or yes it will burn. The redness is no big deal. The burn isnt a chemical burn. It's actually your imune system that is doing that.

65, 5, Anal Warts,slight itching and sensitive skin around the anus..,All I can say is that I probably read about 15 sites with comments about Aldara. Needless to say_ I was terrified to take it. I had 4 genital warts around my anus - two fairly large ones about the size of my thumbnail and two smaller ones. I went to two different doctors and both said that I would need surgery to have them removed. One of the doctors_ a Colorectal Surgeon_ prescribed Aldara but indicated that he thought it would not work_ because my warts were too large and kind of deep around the anal sphere. I am now going into my fourth week of taking Aldara and ALL of my warts are almost gone. I had NONE of the symptoms aside from slight itching (it was not bad and went away in the morning after taking a bath) and the skin feeling slightly sensitive around the same area. Nevertheless_ I noticed changes in the size of my warts after two weeks of using Aldara three times a week and now going into the fourth week_ two of the four have gone and the other two big ones are almost gone. The reason I'm writing this post is because when I was researching Aldara_ I saw almost no positive feedback and was therefore terrified to take it. I want people to know that while perhaps all of these negative side effects could happen_ I had NONE of them that were of serious consequence and the drug worked for me within weeks. As I do not have insurance_ I would have had to pay for the operation myself.

82, 1, Genital warts,Zero reduction in wart quantity or size. New warts continued developing while on the cream. I only used one packet every 3-4 times_ so I was not over applying. I also made sure to wash the cream off in the morning. Since the warts were inside my labia minora it was impossible to prevent the treated area from coming in contact with healthy tissue. It took about 3 wks before I developed extreme itching_ burning_ swelling and redness. The swelling wasn't anything major_ but combined with the angry red color of my vagina it looked AWFUL!! This cream is extremely uncomfortable to use. I am constantly aware of clothing touching me on a minute by minute basis due to the pain. I developed ulcerations but I was also undergoing acid treatments_ so I can't fully attribute that to the aldara.

I suffered horrid side effects like wearing of the skin_ blisters_ burning_ itching_ thrush and bv infections. BUT I've recently restarted using the cream AND for some reason its working much better with hardly any side effects! The only thing I've done differently this time round is to thoroughly wash and DRY the area and allow the cream to soak in or dry BEFORE standing up and moving around. Maybe this allows the cream to ONLY be absorbed by the area you put it on! You know what I'm saying girls :-) I've used it 2-3 times per week for the last 2 weeks and things are looking much better!

85, 1, Genital warts - HPV,I was prescribed the generic form of Aldara_ called Imiquimod cream.  First time applying I used half the packet and put on vaginal warts that were not internal. About an hour or so_ I had burning.  Since_ side effects not too bad I applied cream 2 nights later at the same dosage and awoke with itching_ burning_ severe white vaginal discharge_ white lesions scattered throughout my vagina and a burning on my labia an inch long.,"Called the doctor the next day_ got an appointment for the next day. In the meantime_ I suffered extremely terrible burning pain during urination. I can compare this pain with giving childbirth. I could barely walk or even sit and be comfortable_ it was a constant burning type of pain. Went to doctor_ he gave me 2 antibiotics_ one for viral_ one for bacterial and he basically applied numbing cream_ and treated discharge and all the ""white dots."" Felt good the rest of the day then the burning pain came back at a vengeance_ it was at its worse. Doc recommended pee in bathtub water and that's what I had to do. I then took baths every morning using Aveeno Oatmeal_ nothing else. I used Vagisil Medicated Wipes for burning and itching_ but a good cold washcloth helps you keep your sanity.  I just had my follow-up with the doc and he says my tests came back negative for any STD's. This was basically a chemical reaction to the creme. I think my initial visit to him was that I had a full blown case of the herpes. I advise anyone NOT to take this medicine. I feel it should only be put on by a doctor or further tests need to be done on side effects.

94, 5, BCC,Please study the medicine you are taking before using it IMPROPERLY and complaining about the side affects. I will explain many of the side affects of this medicine.It is known that imiquimod activates a potent immune response through the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)_ which causes and increase in cytokines (primarily interferon) natural killer cells_ macrophages and B-lymphocytes.If you get canker like sores or major flu symptoms then it is a CLEAR sign that you are using WAY TOO MUCH cream. Use the MINIMAL amount possible to get the result you need. Be patient and after several weeks increase the dose if needed. In this case more cream DOES not equal a faster or better result. Please dont listen to me_ ask your doctor_ do your own research and be logical.,After doing some basic research on wiki and pubmed I found this1) Aldara causes a potent immune response_ increasing interferons. It is normal for the human body to have symptoms such as aching muscles and fever related to the production of IFNs during infection. E.G. The Flu virus.  Interferon (IFN)-alpha is known for causing high rates of depression and fatigue which makes sense because if you are sick your body is using energy to mount an immune response and telling you to stay in bed and rest.2) You will see Imiquimod has a strong anti-proliferative effect. This means it inhibits cell growth which is good for cancer but is an obvious explanation for all these canker like sores people are seeing. If you use FAR TOO MUCH cream then you will get massive antiproliferative effects and cell death_ large dead areas of cells on the skin will give you sores.3) People spoke about Aldara messing with your immune system_ I have no proof but this seems totally plausible because if you use too much Aldara on your skin it gets into your blood stream it will cause a potent increase of interferons in the blood which will affect your immune system in some way. It is plausible for example if you have if you have leaky gut syndrome_ this increase interferon will cause antigens to be produced against all the undigested foods in your blood. These proteins are similar to those found in human tissues so autoimmune problems could develop.,M,37,2  months25mg 1X W,9/28/2012,Aldara

So much so that I cannot bear to wear underwear or have anything touching it. Even walking hurts.  I have another two & a bit weeks to go on this cream & am hoping the burning pain subsides soon. On the plus side_ I do think it is having some effect on the warts. They seem to be swollen & hard & I am sure a few have gone already. I guess having them gone will be worth all the pain in the end!

Won't know the results until the skin heals. But I wanted to share my experiences. I had five surgeries (2011) to excise an unusually extensive lentiga melanoma on my eyelids and upper cheek.(Each surgery turned up more cancer_ despite having first had five mapping biopsies.) Last June_ my oncologist judged that the melanoma had returned to the margins of the skin graft. More surgery would have been severely disfiguring_ it's a huge area. So we are trying  Aldara_ which is off label for melanoma. a) It works BEYOND the area of application. Maybe this is good. Areas of my face are inflamed that I have not applied to cream to. b)  BE VERY AWARE THAT DOSING IS NOT A SCIENCE!!! I started using one packet a day_ for eight hours. I am however_ super drug sensitive. After two weeks I had severe systemic side effects described above. (These come from the production of alpha interferon by your stimulated immune cells. Alpha interferon is the source of the depression and fatigue.) My doctor told me to halve the dose_ and use it every other day. The canker sores went away_ but not the intense surface reactions. I am still exhausted_ depressed and short of breath.  BE VIGILANT ABOUT SYSTEMIC (CHEMO) SIDE EFFECTS--NO ONE KNOWS THEIR LONG-LASTING EFFECTS. REPORT THEM TO YOUR MD_ JIGGLE THE DOSE. I am hanging in_ however The alternative is a Phantom of the Opera Mask.Good luck everyone!,F,65,12  weeks.25 grams 1X D,8/15/2012,Aldara
98, 1, GW,I was prescribed this drug for a minimal gw_ with doses every M_W_F. I put a very small amount on the wart but could only do it once a week due to burning and itching. I was never told to wipe it off_ but later read you're supposed to. Up until recently_ my side effects were only headaches and fatigue. I may have put more cream on then normal_ but I developed bad white/black burns around my labia which also got extremely swollen and red. It has been three days and I still cannot walk normal and dread peeing as it burns beyond belief. I have a very high pain tolerance (i.e natural childbirth) but cannot tolerate this. I've found so many reviews consistentwith mine that had I read before I wouldnt have used. I went to my Dr who just doesn't believe its from the cream and actually told me it could be a herpes outbreak! My herpes test came back negative_ which now has him in disbelief as he still doesn't think its the cream. He said he prescribes this a lot and has never heard of this. Well_ check the internet because tons of ppl have experienced this. I would never recommend trying this cream for gw. There are alternatives. Not to mention the gw has not changed in 12 weeks.

102, 1, sBCC,"I took Aldara per the direction of my dermatologist.  She prescribed for me to put it on the side of my neck to treat a ""sBCC"" for 6 weeks.  5 days treat before bed_ 2 days rest.  She indicated to just use a pinhead size for the cream.  After starting I immediately got flu-like symptoms just before a big vacation.  I had runny nose_ achy muscles and joints_ and itchy eyes.  I thought it was just allergies at the time.  The BCC on the side of my neck became red_ puffy and encrusted within a few days.  It didn't hurt_ but it was unsightly.   After a while it scabbed over and I called the dermatologist they told me to keep using it for 6 FULL weeks.   At this point I feel that I have some side effects from the Aldara treatment but I am still trying to figure out what it has done to me.   Search the web and you'll find plenty of stories on how this drug has permanently ruined healthy people's lives.","If you are considering taking this ""topical chemotherapy"" drug I would seriously do your own research on it.  It seems like a harmless little cream_ but 3M has created a way for the powerful drug Imiquimod to be delivered directly through your skin into your body and cause temporary and permanent serious medical conditions.   Please don't use on genitals_ anus_ nose or around face (eyes_ mouth_ etc).  If your sores become red and bloody do not use Aldara on the open sores as the powerful drug Imiquimod will go straight to your bloodstream and wreak havoc with your immune system.

Next day started coming down with a fever_ chills_ body aches_ and headache. Took Tylenol and symptoms subsided.

That night I experienced severe itching and burning to the point where it woke me up in the middle of the night. The next morning I couldn't take the itching so I washed all the cream off. Then the same side effects happened but worse than 2 fold. I came down with the same flu-like symptoms but my labia and everything else down there was completely swollen. It burned like hell when I peed and it hurt so much to touch with anything_ soft tissue and water.

Because the side effects were so unbearable_ I only used the cream twice the first week and once the second week. This allowed my skin to heal in between doses. My skin looked and felt horrible. I was very concerned that the medicine was not helping me at all and only making my condition worse. BUT_ by the time the third week came around and I was ready to apply my fourth dose_ nearly all of my warts were cleared (just a couple very small flat ones remained)_ my skin had healed_ and it looked healthy as ever. Although the side effects were severe and painful_ this medicine works!,If you are serious about getting rid of your warts fast_ Aldara works! I read a user comment about Aldara that said it gets worse before it gets better. This is so true. If you are experiencing the uncomfortable side effects_ try to stay with it. Take a break and skip a dose or two if you need to to let your skin heal. Also_ ask your doctor for lidocaine jelly. This really helps with the pain and itching. And remember_ only use a TINY TINY amount. Use a flat toothpick to apply to the skin. Even if you think you are not applying enough_ you are! If you put too much on_ you will most likely experience the painful side effects. The key to minimizing the side effects is using the smallest amount. The side effects usually last a couple of days.

I took herpes tests for 5 months before my doctor was satisfied that I did not have herpes.

134, 4, Genital Warts,Extreme Burning !!,I just found out about a week ago i have HPV. My doctor prescribed me Aldara. I used it once last wednesday_ once thursday and than once again sunday and monday. All my doctor told me was to apply it 3 times a week before i went to bed and to wash it off in the morning. I didnt have side effects until my latest use on monday. Tuesday i woke up with extreme discomfort...burning_ itching_ and barely being able to pee without shedding a tear. I didnt read all the reviews on this site until today! Now with it being wednesday I am still in such pain. I cant walk_ sit_ or lay down without being in excruiating discomfort. I have not used Aldara since the side effects and am going to wait until they are over to begin treatment again. From reading the reviews and for people who have had the same problems i just have a few questions: Will the burning sensation go away? And when i start using the cream again should i apply it only to the warts? The prescription says to use it 3 times a week_ should the 3 times a week be apart from eachother? Like Sunday_ Wednesday and Friday perhaps? ALSO on the Tuesday I did not wash the medication off can they have anything to do with the fact i cant even walk without being in pain!?! My doctor didnt tell me any of these side effects nor did he or the directions itself say to place cream on only the warts! When will the pain go away :(,F,22,1  weeks 3X W,9/21/2011Email,Aldara

138, 5, hpv/ gw,The morning after the first use I felt nauseous_ flu-like symptoms but this was the only time I experienced these symptoms.  Now_ swolen labia (similar symptoms to yeast infection ie: itching_ swelling)_ raw skin_ stinging_ extremely tender_ a few red bumps around the area.,The first time I had gw (6 yrs ago)_ I was treated once a week for 4 weeks with liquid nitrogen which was successful.  This time (a different gyno) perscribed Aldara and it seems to be working great as far as getting rid of the warts.  Mine were very tiny -around the vaginal opening and a few inside- and seemed to have disappeared after the first week and a half of using the cream.  The side effects however_ were quite disappointing. Although I believe all warts are gone_ I was going to continue with treatment for a few more days just to make sure but now have to take a break as I am experiencing very raw skin.  I used the cream as dirrected but from reading other's reactions to the cream_ I think I am still using too much.  My side effects seem to be getting a bit worse dispite not having used the cream for a few days. I now appear to have red_ raw skin along the inside walls of my labia and around the vaginal opening as well as several small red bumps.  I have had two outbreaks of herpes in the past 6 years and although my symptoms at the moment are similar to that of herpes_ after reading other peoples reactions_ I believe it is just a reaction to the cream (I take a daily dose of Valtrex as preventative measure just in case_ so I figure a herpes outbreak is highly unlikely anyway).  I am wondering if others have had a similar reaction_ thinking it may be herpes when in fact is is just a reaction to the Aldara cream? Has anyone used vit.

I was fortunate enough to be given aldara for free from my local sexual health unit.Being over zealous I applied far too much of the medication_ and far too often and suffered extreme negative consequences.  I experienced extremely painful ""chemical burn"" type sores which would weep fluid.  It became too painful for me to walk due to the sores_ and I was unable to urinate unless I was sitting in a bath.Despite the side effects (which I suffered only due to my own errors in attempting to apply too much_ and too often in attempts to speed up my results) this product was a god send.  Almost immediately the warts diminished.  Within three weeks I was free of genital warts.My advice is to use the product very sparingly (other reviewers have suggested using a toothpick which I think is a great idea) and to use the product exactly as prescribed by the physcian.

141, 2, Genital Warts,Zero Side Effects!,I've been using Aldara for about 2 weeks now_ applied to warts once a day and have absolutely zero effects from it.  When I say zero effects_ I mean NO effects whatsoever_ positive or negative.  As a matter of fact_ my index finger feels more irritation (which is barely noticable) shortly after applying Aldara to warts.  The 2 warts look exactly as they did two weeks ago_ if not slightly bigger. I know that this is early_ and 2 weeks may be to soon to be reporting_ but I expected this expensive medication to at least appear to be doing something within the first two weeks.  I used Condyline for my other warts and they burned away_ very painfully_ within two weeks time.  Condyline was not effective on these two last warts that are located above my pubic hair (the other 2 were located on the bottom of my shaft and a wart the size and length of a pencil eraser was on my scrotum).And by the way_ I am kind of pissed that I caught genital warts even though I have been an avid user of condoms that did absolutely nothing to prevent the spread of this virus.  Don't get me wrong_ I already knew condoms cannot fully protect anyone_ but in my head_ I naively believed that the condoms would work for me.  Stupid me.,M,32,2  weeks 1X D,7/28/2011,Aldara

I was quite worried after reading that so many people have had bad experiences with the cream_ so I made sure I was extremely careful with application. I used some Vaseline to protect my healthy skin around the warts and a Q-tip to apply it just on them. They were very tiny so it was kind of difficult but I took my time and I didn't have any problems with it. My skin became just a tad more sensitive and I had some very mild itching (less than a mosquito bite).

It was not diagnosed definitively as she did not want to do a biopsy and risk the scarring.  It worked_ in that the cancer is gone.  I was left initially with a hole in the tissue of my nose which was quite deep.  Over time_ it seemed to fill in a bit and is now a faint white scar which is easily covered by makeup.  I think the scarring would have been much worse with surgery.  I will carefully think about whether to use aldara again though.  The side effects were absolutely terrible and my doctor did not tell me anything about this at all.  I actually stopped using it before the five weeks were complete.

Now I am just waiting for the redness to disappear.  It has been 3 weeks_ and I can still see exactly where the medicine was used_ but it is getting lighter.

I found a site that recommended apple cider vinegar. I was extremely skeptical_ but I felt like I didn't have any other options because after reading all these horror stories I was NOT going to take my chances with Aldara. Long story short_ it worked after one night. Do yourself a favor and try ACV first. There's really nothing to lose...except your GWs.Procedure for the Removal of WartsUsing Apple Cider VinegarFor this simple procedure_ the removal of warts using apple cider vinegar requires just 3 things:Apple Cider VinegarCotton balls (end of Q-tip will do)Band-aidEach night before going to bed soak a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar_ apply it to the wart and then hold it in place with a band-aid. Leave it on all night_ or if you like_ 24 hours a day but change the soaked cotton and band-aid each evening for a week.The wart will swell and may throb as it reacts with the vinegar and then start to turn black within the first two days and after a week or two will be completely gone.**It is important to continue the treatment for a few days to a week after the wart has fallen off to help ensure it does not come back.,F,25,  1X D,3/29/2011,Aldara

171, 5, HPV - GW,mild pain/itching,Great results after only 2 applications.  I read this site before using and was very frightened_ almost didn't go ahead with treatment. It is very important to apply a very small amount with a Q-tip and ONLY apply to the warts - I think people with chemical burns are using way too much and using it on skin without warts. I had 3 large warts (about the size of a pea) and 6 smaller ones - after 2 treatments 2 of the smaller ones are gone and the large ones have shrunk in size by at least half! Because Aldara works with your immune response_ what I think helped alot was I waited 4 weeks and boosted my immune system before starting treatment.  Lots of fruit & veg_ exercise_ vitamin supplements_ and echinacea strengthened my immune response BEFORE starting Aldara & my results are amazing to me_ thus far.  I've stopped the echinacea as some research indicates a possible contraindication with Aldara_ but continue to do everything I can to keep immune sys. strong and enhance the effects of aldara.  Do your research and use it properly (only a small amount_ only on actual warts) and hoping you have the same results!,F,35,5  days 3X W,2/17/2011,Aldara
172, 4, basal cell carcinoma,Been using Aldara for last two weeks on bcc behind right ear. Have previously(3years ago} used this drug on ears and nose with very good results.  Side effects tend to be headaches_ tinitus and flu like symptums. They are depressive but I suppose no pain no gain. I use the cream very sparingly and each sachet lasts about 8 to 10 applications.  Obviously for larger areas of coverage_ greater quantities would be used.I apply before going to bed at night and shower next morning.  This is repeated for 5 nights and then a break of two nights before recommencing treatment for next 5 nights. Total period will be 6 weeks.  My previous usage was spectacularly successful and I have had no repetition of the previous bcc. I can only endorse the product for my own use but accept that there may be patients with bigger problems and correspondingly unacceptable side effects.

She failed to mention that a very small amount would do the trick and I proceeded to slather the whole pack on the affected area all 3 times. As you can imagine this led to some VERY adverse effects. I have since noticed painful urination_ my clitoris and labia have become very sensitive and painful and have discharged a clear liquid from the sores. It has become very painful and at times has brought me to tears and caused me to lose sleep. I have found that by applying vitamin E oil over my groin area has greatly helped both in relieving the pain and in healing the burns more rapidly. After 3 days I have went from extreme discomfort to a slight annoying irritation. While I was not fully informed by the doctor about the adverse effects_ and the pamphlet from the pharmacy wasn't much better_ I fully plan to continue my use of Aldara after allowing the sores to heal. I will use minimal amounts only on the remaining warts_ as the Aldara cleared my warts up almost completely!

We should have been more aggressive back then_ as now I have much more to treat again. It was bad advice to only treat visible AKs in 2009. The formerly treated areas are not inflamed this year_ so they were eradicated. This time the dermatologist suspected more hidden AKs so I'm covering scalp 100% down to ears and totally bald again. Some cream got on top edge of one ear to open up a hidden AK there_ so we've added it into the plan.

I am miserable_ though get some relief from Lidocaine Cream and hydrocodone to enable sleep. It was taking more than one packet of Aldara to cover the area each day_ difficult to resist using part of another.

I live with the knowledge that I will probably treat some area of my body yearly for the rest of my life - a little depressing but i deal with it.

I know it says not to bandage the area that you're applying the medication too... but quite frankly_ I didn't want to apply this stuff again and have it burn the heck out of the already irritated area.

195, 4, HPV - Genital Warts (Men),My first experience with Aldara was with a wart on my finger. I had an enormous disgusting stubborn DEEPLY EMBEDDED wart on my finger for 2 yrs until I got the nerve to see a dermatologist. He basically cut it_ gouged it_ then decided to torch the thing off which was ridiculously horrific to watch (my finger was numbed prior). But certain parts of the wart still remained after the healing began. So then he performed freezing on those parts. He told me to apply Aldara once a day to the open wound. Because here's the deal: There sooo many layers of skin. For maximum penetration the Aldara sets off your immune system when it's closer to wart and your bloodstream. My finger cleared up completely after 2 weeks.,So flash forward to a few months. I found out I had HUNDREDS of genital warts around my anus_ in the area  close to the base of my scrotum_ and even two big ones on the actual hole itself_ with parts of it being inside. So imagine the horror this is my case. So the doctor performed a folgoration (sp?) which is basically putting me to sleep and then torching all the warts off in one swoop. The two weeks of recovery that followed were ok. I was in pain_ but the pain went away more and more every day. My anal area seemed to be smoother when I could touch it with soap in the shower. However_ it's expected that some of the warts may return_ in which case my doctor says is not uncommon.So I went back after the folgoration and yep_ there are a few warts that popped up again. So applied a cream_ that burned a bit_ to the warts and then told me to use Aldara (as prescribed) in the area for the next 3 wks. He told me that the way to cure this is thru relentless treatment. I believe him. Aldara worked on my 2 yr wart on my finger and I'm hoping it works on all these damn little ones on my anus. I'll keep you posted!So far it's treatment #2 and my anal area is sore as hell. Luckily I have lidocaine cream to numb that area if it gets too unbearable.

203, 5, Genital Warts/HPV,NO side effects,"I read this website before I used this. So I was nervous and VERY VERY careful with the application. I used vaseline to protect the non infected area and just applied a q-tip with the Aldara directly on the wart and wiped away any extra off my skin. I only had one small wart down below. I thought I was imagining that it was getting smaller until my 9th application when I had to really hunt for it. By the 10th application I couldn't see it at all but I know it must still be there so I applied the Aldara to the small area. I have two more applications that I will use in the same way just to be sure.

205, 3, GW,Massive swelling_ Chemical burns_ Excruciating pain!,I wish I had found this site a few days ago. I discovered I had GW about two months ago_ but was not confirmed until two weeks ago by my OBGYN. I was very upset as I have been with two people. The first week of applying Aldara went okay_ I experienced minor swelling_ itching and irritation. This week I applied the cream two nights in a row. I am in so much pain I had to call in sick to work. I have been crying all day_ I need to sit in a tub just to urinate. I have been Icing and applying bacitracin to avoid any infecting just in case these burns decide to open. I tryed hydrocortisone cream but it was too painful. My vagina is so swollen my inner labia is outside my outer labia. I have sever muscle ache and a bunch of red/brown burns all over my vagina. It seems to be getting worse even though I have not applied cream the last two days. I am freaking out and don't know what to do. If anyone has any suggestions or advice please email me. Does the pain go away??? HELP,F,24,  3X W,9/5/2010Email,Aldara
206, 4, ,severe swelling_ burning_ itching_ sores.,Continued: I am wart free after only 3 applications. I had 2 lines of warts on my inner labias which were small_ in clusters with some larger ones.I had a terrible reaction because i was not advised how to use this product or the possible side effects. MY ADVICE ON HOW TO AVOID BAD REACTION:- Rub vaseline all over your genitals where Aldara DOES NOT need to be applied- Leave aldara on for 6-7 hrs to see how you react.. my first application was 10 hrs_ second was 7.5 and third was 6 hrs.- Apply with a Q tip and with an EXTREMELY minimal amount. I still used the smallest amount and still had a severe reaction.- DO NOT WASH YOURSELF WITH SOAP USE A NON SOAP PRODUCT LIKE CETAPHILWHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE A REACTION: I had 2 large sores appear and lots of red & white bumps appear. DO NOT STRESS your skin will do bizarre things its MOST LIKELY not new warts. I wet paper towels and gently dabbed my vagina throughout the day to keep area clean to prevent infection. Take neurofen to reduce pain and swelling_ take ANTIHISTAMINE to reduce itching. I took the drowsy kind at night so i could sleep. Within 5 days most swelling was gone_ bumps dissipated. 2 large sores practically gone within 6 days.  i am wart free. This was a terrible experience but WORTH it.

This confirmed CCs where I suspected I had them on my face_ but I got a similar reaction where I had some acne at the time of treatment.  I am to be assessed by doc in one week.

I feel betrayed by my doctor who prescribed this drug to me as a preemptive strike against future ACs - I didn't even know that there might be any of them simmering under my skin's surface.  She prescribed the drug ten days before Christmas_ and didn't warn me about the side effects_ thereby negatively impacting the entire holiday season for me.

211, 1, Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma,Initially I had a sharp pain in my lower right abdomen (near appendix) and went to the ER. Over the next 6 weeks_ multiple CT scans showed 2 enlarged lymph nodes_ enlarged pancreas_ enlarged kidney_ splenomegaly_ enlarged thymus. Myalgia_ muscle weakness_ bone pain in arms and legs_ joint pain_ difficulty breathing_ jaw stiffness. Bloating and distended stomach. Gastrointestinal discomfort_ pain after emptying bladder.,After the initial pain and ER visit (during week 9 on Aldara) I experienced widespread myalgia. I did not know Aldara had caused my pain at that time. My muscles ached and I felt weak_ I easily pulled/strained muscles during normal activity. I woke up in pain every day and it hurt to roll over or get out of bed. I switched to a low-sugar veggie focused diet which helped a little with the GI issues. I was told by a GI doctor_ after my second CT_ that I had lymphoma and I was sent for a biopsy. I spent 8 weeks in and out of doctors' offices before the symptoms began to subside_ as I had stopped taking the medication.,F,31,12  weeks.05 MG/day 1X D,8/21/2010Email,Aldara
212, 3, gw,itching_ MILD burning_ sensitive_ redness.,I have been using Aldara for 3 weeks now. I had about 10-15 small warts total. A lot of the warts are still there. A few have went away on week 2 but you can still tell where the wart was as there's a red blister like scar in replace. To me_ Aldara doesn't seem to be working now since after week 2. I agree with everyone that using this stuff makes it extremely itchy_ but it burning so much that you can barely walk or pee? I haven't experienced any of that. I've had maybe mild burning but at most its just a little sensitive and red. My doctor told me to use it 4 times a week during bedtime and wash off when you wake up. So  I'm using it an extra day more than most people and sometimes I even forget to wash the cream off and still the warts are still there and the same size. I'd definitely keep using it and pay for the entire 4 months if I knew it was going to work_ but I'd rather not waste $500 or $600 and the warts still be there! I think the Aldara cream cost $160 for 1 months worth for me.,F,19,3  weeks 4X W,8/20/2010,Aldara

It began to itch and I had to make sure that I read the label properly .. ""mild to moderate burning"" .. and boy_ does it burn. There are a few blisters and my entire vaginal region is swollen and red. My clitoris is even swollen .. walking is a bit painful .. sitting is as well. This is all the consequences of unprotected sex. I never in my life want to have unprotected sex .. because it was a foolish mistake. The way my vagina is feeling_ right now .. I don't want to have sex at all! Whatsoever. I refuse to go through this pain .. somewhat_ torture again. I will take someone's advice and use some petroleum jelly on the days when I don't have to use it.",In addition_ ALDARA obviously is effective. I mean_ I wished that the process was going to be easy as pie_ but c'mon now .. it's fricking warts. I never imagined myself being put in this situation .. but I guess I have to roll with the punches .. and continue on with the treatment until I am healed. I plan to get the gardasil shot as soon as possible. I don't want to run the risk of getting cervical cancer or anything of that nature. All of this pain is definitely a life lesson LEARNED!

I started out with one bump on the outside of my vagina. my doctor first prescribed me with podofilox  which made the wart go away_ but then about two weeks later  10 tiny ones popped up around the opening of my vagina. I wish my doctor had just prescribed Aldara the first time..since Aldara actually stops them from reappearing.. Before i used Aldara the first time_ i read the comments on this page and i was so scared. but i had to do something...so i was extra careful in applying the cream. i put just a tiny amount on each of the warts and after the first couple days i was really tired and it was a little itchy down there_ but it was completely bearable! im on my second week of using it now and almost all of my warts are completely gone! My advice on this product is to be Extra careful and use a Q tip when applying the cream_ to make sure it gets on the warts ONLY. it also helps if you have a boyfriend or someone to apply it for you..since it's hard to see the area clearly. But if you're applying it on your own make sure you hold a mirror so you can see what you are doing. You may feel like applying a tiny amount won't get rid of the warts..but this product is so strong that a little dab each time is all you  need! it really does work so don't be afraid.If you use it CORRECTLY and you have a good immune system..you will be happy that you did.,F,21,2  weeks 3X W,8/5/2010Email,Aldara

One important thing to note is that freezing the warts do not help you get rid of the virus. It is simply to make them disappear. Aldara is the one building up your immune system and making sure they don't come back. After the second week_ a few more appeared_ which I was told_ is normal. It is just your immune system reacting to the treatment. However_ now after a month of using the cream 3 times a week and and two freezing treatments_ I only have 4 small ones left!

The warts are almost completely gone within the 2 weeks I have been using it and will be calling my Dr. today to see how long I should continue to use it after they are fully gone. I have noticed the day after treatment I feel a little tired for some reason and I am only slightly sore in the application area with only slight burning sensation around the 7-8 hour period which is when it should be removed. I will say though... reading all the negative reviews of it had me very scared to use it since I have had many bad drug reactions in the past.

After reading TONS of testimonials just like this one from other patients_ including my experience with Aldara_ the most important things to do is be consistent with application 3x/week_ NOT applying too much of it_ and patience.

I got flu-like symptoms almost immediately and then over the next few days my nose had redness_ swelling_ green-colored oozing_ blistering_ scabbing ... all the Aldara side effects you could possibly get (really ugly) ... but I didn't get those side effects until the Restylane was injected.  That was the middle of January and my nose is still red and has a few hard blisters on it.

I have not had intercourse in about 2 1/2 months and have never had a problem related to Herpes. I am waiting on my test results from the doctor. I do feel so much better after reading the reviews on this site as now I feel confident this was just an allergic reaction and not HERPES!

249, 4, HPV/GW,Pain_ Redness_ Some swelling_ Soars around the site_ Itching_ Burning when urinating_ Soar to touch.,I think the symptoms that everyone is explaining is exactly what is supossed to be going on. I was first diagnosed with HPVGW and given the AlDara cream to diminish the warts and it was successful_ however_ I do think that most of you are using this incorrectly_ which is causing you to have the very painful and blistering side effects. If you see the wart is shrinking then you need to ease up on the amount of cream you are using. This cream is like an acid and will eat away at your skin causing you to develop an open soar and yes it can look similar to herpes but don't be alarmed. The bottle says to use 3X's at week at nighttime_ rub into the affected area but try not to touch un-infected areas. Rub directly onto the wart and no where else is what my doctor had explained to me. You don't have to use it until you develop a soar_ I believe with experience in using this for a year and half now_ if you just keep applying it until the wart disappears_ then you might only need one or two more applications. The best thing for you to do is not itch the area_ it will just cause you to be soar_ try rubbing vaseline or some type of petroleum jelly on the area to keep form rubbing other areas as well. This is the best advice I can give and it seems to work for me. I have only had a max of maybe 4 warts in 2 years and they all have been diminished my the cream.,F,23,1  years30 MG 3X W,3/13/2010,Aldara

Pain in the pelvic area and down both legs. Hemorrhage in my right eye.,"My dermatologist prescribed Aldara twice - in March 2009 and October 2009. Each course of treatment consisted of 12 applications_ for which there were 12 sachets of the drug. I was to apply Aldara (mainly to my forehead) for five days_ take two days off_ apply it for another five days_ take two days off_ and then apply it for two days. I didn't have bcc; just a few minor lesions. My dermatologist said the Aldara would clear these up and reduce the risk of bcc developing in the future. There was no warning of possible side effects_ except that I would look ""a bit of a mess"" for a while. And I have to say that_ the first time I used Aldara_ I suffered no side effects that I remember (apart from the local effects on the skin). But five days after I started using it in October_ I came down with flu-like symptoms. At first_ I thought I did have a touch of flu - and continued to apply the cream. But after six days of pain_ for which I took codeine_ paracetamol and aspirin at night_ I suspected the Aldara was to blame_ and did a Google search for ""Aldara+side effects"". I read some of the testimonies I found on the first page of Google results_ which were enough to persuade me not to use the three remaining sachets of the drug. The pain continued for about five more days_ but affected a smaller and smaller area until it was eventually confined to my lower legs and ankles. I then suffered a hemorrhage in my right eye_ which left half of it badly bloodshot for more",M,69,2  weeks,12/25/2009Email,Aldara

First 2 days or so nothing happened_ then between day 3 and the middle of the second week all my GW started to turn red. Afterwards_ the GW started to be destroyed (the larger ones over three to four days) so that I was completely cleared by the beginning of the third week. At the end of the third week_ I stopped the treatment.The head of my penis was then starting to turn red in some parts because the drug is really powerful (use *very* little of it and *never forget to wash it off*; please_ please_ read this again out loud: VERY LITTLE OF IT: this is *extremely powerful*).

I thought I had herpes until I called my gyno and she explained it was a bad reation. I definetely used too much of this stuff. Please be careful and apply it correctly. Im still suffering with the herpes like sores and its been a week_ this is exteremly uncomfortable.,F,24,3  days,12/6/2009,Aldara

My scrotum has become extremely irritated and it BURNSS. I cant sleep without pain_ I cant walk withou pain_ wtf! Cursed the bitch that gave me moluscum!,,M,23,3  weeks,12/5/2009Email,Aldara
278, 4, hpv,Minor itching_ some burning_ some erosion/sores.,Talked to my doctor about the burning and sores_ and he has me doing 2-3 weeks on_ taking a week off and starting up again. You shouldn't put the medication on any open sores_ so if you've got them_ STOP_ wait til they clear_ and start the Aldara back up. I've used Aldara for three outbreaks over the past 6 years and it's worked for me every time.,F,26,3  times,11/30/2009,Aldara
279, 5, GW anal,mild itiching after 2 weeks,I posted on here on Nov.12_ right before I was to start using the drug and was horrifed about some of the side effects I read about.  I feel compelled to now report my result from using Aldara on Anal Warts.First of all_ no matter who gave it to you_ how or where you have warts. Stop treating yourself like a victim. I assume most people have educated themselves on the transmission of HPV and the chance of having warts.  My boyfriend and I got all the facts and although he has not shown any signs of having HPV_ more then likely he has it. I am still waiting for my follow up appointement from my doctor to be sure_ but after 2 weeks of using Aldara_ with 2 day breaks inbetween_ there are no more visible signs of warts. Again_ waiting for a doc to confirm this.  Everyone reacts differently to medication_ but I almost backed out from trying the drug after reading other peoples side effects.  You need to try this for yourself!  I had mild irritation on the non affected areas of my bum.  No loss of sleep_ no spreading etc.  The hardest part was trying to turn around trying to see exactly where to put it.  I really hope if you are feeling down about this that my post cheers you up.  I also stronly suggest you call your local anonymous STI hotline and get the facts from a medical professional.,M,33,2  weeks,11/29/2009Email,Aldara
280, 4, HPV/GW,Itching ranging from mild to moderate the day after I apply. The second day afterwards_ I feel fine!  The itching is no worse then the itching I experience when I have an outbreak of warts (I've never had pain with them like some people_ only INTENSE itching).  Also I follow the directions exactly:  apply at bedtime only to affected areas; rub in completely; wash off in the morning; apply 3x/week.  With some of the side effects listed on this site_ it seems like people may have been using too much of the creme_ or using it too often.  Also_ my doctor said that if I have additional irritation_ to hold off on the next dose until the skin irritation clears (so use it less than 3x per week). Always follow MD recommendations!,I've had TCA treatments_ and liquid nitrogen treatments with varying sucess.  The warts would clear (but not completely) but would come back within a short time (and were actually WORSE after the liqid nitrogen).  So far_ after three treatments with Aldara_ there has been a significant decrease in the number and thickness of the warts.  Here's hoping this does the trick....,F,33,7  days,11/29/2009,Aldara
281, 4, HPV/GW,Slight itching_ keeps me really fatigued.,"Well_ I am glad I was put on this medicene before reading all the comments on this site. I just applied the 3rd packet_ so this is my first week being on Aldara and I am already seeing results. Yeah it is itchy but you know I would rather a little itching at night rather than a lifetime of ""holy crap what is on your crotch!"". Grow up people. BTW. Make sure you are in a monogamous relationship_ hopefully this will not happy to you. :)",F,19,3  days,11/27/2009,Aldara
282, 1, actinic keratosis,Applied to chest area--entire chest broke out in red blisters that oozed_ itched_ burned_ and after 8 weeks of using Aldara is still not showing any signs of improvement.  Also_ each day after using the drug_ experience anxiety_ low-grade fever_ chills_ muscle aches_ flu-like symptoms--pretty much incapacitated on the day after using twice each week.  Does anyone out there have any insight as to when I will see improvement?  Will I have to go the entire 12 weeks and finish the last dose before I start to heal?  I feel like I'm scared for life--this is sooooo bad!,Was not even aware of actinic keratosis until physician's assistant brought to my attention and prescribed Aldara.  Did not warn me of side effects.  I'd rather take my chances with the actinic keratosis than use this drug again.  Has been prescribed for 12 weeks--am into 9th week now.  Will continue to the end_ but would never do this again.,F,63,8  weeks,11/24/2009Email,Aldara
283, 5, HPV Anal Warts,Slight itching/burning,I had several anal warts that are now all gone thanks to Aldara!  I used the medication for two months.  I had no side effects for the first month_ but as the warts disappeared I did get some itching.   I think the itching was due to using the same amount of Aldara when the warts disappeared.   I think it made healthy skin itch.  So_ I cut down on the amount applied and the itching went away.   I highly recommend this drug.,M,33,60  days,11/23/2009Email,Aldara
284, 1, actinic keratoses,Two days after applying to forehead started experiencing body aches_ fatigue_ chest pain and severe acid reflux (day and night).  After second application (4 days later)constant headache.  After researching this product on the internet_ I have decided to discontinue.  It is not worth it!! I have not slept for three nights due to acid reflux.,I'm so disappointed in my doctor. I trusted her opinion that there were minimal side effects from using this drug. I'm only relieved that I realised before making any more applications.,F,41,5  days,11/15/2009,Aldara
285, 1, GW,None Yet,Ok people I am freaking out_ just came back from my Doc with a prescritption for Aldara. He told me to try it for a month.  I've read some comments and horror stories on here and honestly I could vomit!  Is there anyone who hasn't had these horrible side affects?  Mt Doc also mentioned it could be burnt or frozen off?  Has anyone tried this type of treatment?  I would rather have a week of agonising paing then months and months and months of this!,M,33, ,11/12/2009,Aldara
286, 3, Don't Even Know...bumps on scrotum,Dryness_ then Redness_ Sores with puss. Tender scrotum,So I've have these bumps on my scrotum. NOT GW (One Doctor said Molescum not sure they look like hair bumps). Early 2008_ I got them frozen off_ and they went away for a bit_ but not 100%.  When they came back_ I wanted to get them frozen off.  However_ Doctor recommended NO INSISTED on Aldara. I've been using it for a little over 2 weeks now_ and 2 days ago is when I noticed first my entire scrotum was dry and felt very sensitive.  So that night I decided to slobber it with some moisturizing lotion_ and sleep on it.  The next morning_ I was actually woken up at 4am.  I was in pain.  There were blisters_ and sores.  Scrotum's been red ever since_ very sensitive_ puss. It's been getting worse.  Any touch to the scrotum hurts...EVERY STEP I TAKE IS AGONY... Have been trying not wearing underwear_ but that's also no help.  The worse is where the scrotum touches the thighs. I feel every hair poking.  Don't know whether it was even worth it... don't even have GW.  I've been consumed only by the pain. I'm on my knees legs spread apart writing this right now_ and can still feel the stinging/burning sensation. I hope it's working.....MISERY loves company_ so it's been sort of comforting and helpful reading all your comments_ and I'll certainly minimize on the usage in the area. Don't know if the freeze would have been better (I kept asking for it_ but doctor said no...I think he was trying to punish me.)... anyone has any feedback or tips on how to ease the pain... or how log this pa,M,23,2  weeks,11/11/2009Email,Aldara

289, 1, HPV/GW,Took for only 3 days.. in a row. By day two I developed mildly sore red bumps (rash-like) on the inside of both sides of my outer labias by the next day they looked redder_ felt more sore to the touch and possibly open wounds. The next day they turned into tiny bubble-like bumps with a white pus in the middle and they're mildly itchy. The area may be a little swollen as well. The wart I had was VERY tiny_ looks like it's going away already.  I have no other symptoms since I stopped using the cream but I only used it 3x.  Is this normal?  I do not have herpes but I'm worried if I get checked my OB/GYN is going to automatically assume I do.,I do not recommend this cream as I'm sure my symptoms are side effects.

I really thought that between the biopsy and cauterization_ the cancer was gone. After 3 weeks_ went back to Doc._ she thought it was gone as well.  Wrong.

Be very careful with this medication_ do not blob it on and always ask a doctor if your going to apply it to a new area of your genital area because it might not be meant to be applied there_ generally I found going to the doctor to burn the warts off more effective with that freezing stuff I don't know what they call it but once a week for 3-4 treatments has worked for me in the past_ I would not recommond this product as I find it way too harsh on my skin even when I used it properly and it's expensive too_ made me itchy and takes a long time to start working_ not worth the time_ money or pain,F,24, ,9/6/2009,Aldara
301, 4, Genital Warts,intense itching_ redness_ open sores_ mild nausea and diarrhea,Used properly (really rub it in people_ don't just glop it on) it does clear up the warts. I noticed it cleared up the soft warts near my vagina within a few applications_ and the harder warts in the general groin region took a few weeks. I continued applying it after they disappeared because I did not want them to come back_ and ended up with several extremely painful open sores. I also have had constant mild nausea and periodic diarreah_ but nothing really intolerable. I am about to take a break and see if the warts come back.,F,23,4  months,8/29/2009,Aldara

I'm laying on the floor as I type because it has caused a few of my anal warts to become extremely sore and sensitive. I've also been up since 2 am due to the pain and nausea. Despite all this_ the cream is working. I was told it would take several weeks to begin working but it worked after the first night I used it. Granted I'm in a lot of pain_ but for the time being I think it's worth it. I think if you can manage to ignore the pain it is definitely something to try. Just remember to use as directed. Overusing it thinking it will work faster will just end up replacing the pain of warts with the pain of not knowing how to follow directions. Good luck!,M,20,2  weeks,8/10/2009Email,Aldara

My doctor originaly prescribed Condylox (podofilox) which is a solution that is used to destroy the skin of the wart. It worked within a week the warts were gone but the solution irritated my skin. A few months later they were back and I was prescribed Aldara instead. I used this medication for a month 3 times a week and did not see any results. The warts begain to grow larger and rapidly speaded. My Dr. infomed me that I would have to use this medication for atleast three months before they would disappear.

Aldara has worked very well_ it takes about a week or two before it triggers sufficent immune response_ once it does_ you'll see redness in the application area_ then you know it has begun to work.

For the first month of using Aldara it was fine to use with a mild burning sensation. The more I used it the greater this pain got. I rang my doctor as I was concerned as I was never told about these side effects. She advised to continue using the product. So I did. I then noticed red like blisters which made it painful to walk and urinate. I went back to my doctor who then told me I had herpes and also prescribed me Valtrex. I continued using both medications with no success. I then went and got a second_ third_ fourth and fifth opinion as the pain was so bad and I had now had 2 months off work. They all said the same thing. I then went to a sexual health clinic and the lady here told me never to use Aldara as one single application can lead to life long problems and that she had seen some horror stories. She also told me I did not have herpes phew! She told me to stop using any medication and have salt baths daily to cleanse the area to help it heal. Once it had healed she simply burnt them off. This caused no pain and they were gone the following day. Although the aldara got rid of the warts_ it caused immense pain and they still came back.

317, 4, Genital Warts,A little soreness on the skin around the site.,I was diagnosed with HPV almost 2 years ago I was horrified but the dr gave me Aldara to treat the 6 or 7 warts I had. Sadly it didn't work the first time and I had to have them all burned off with acid. I was very happy with the results of that and it didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would. Recently I had two more come up and started treating them right away with the Aldara. I have noticed a huge change in the size already and it has only been two weeks. I did however get it on other parts of my vagina and it left horrible open sores. I have herpes as well and these are nothing compared to a herpes out break but they are not fun either way. Be careful to put it only on the warts and let the cream really dry before moving.,F,24,2  weeks,4/23/2009Email,Aldara

GW became less in quantity and size! Nevertheless I'm looking for other options and stopped using it because of extreme naussea and pain. First was ok_ no problems at all. But after second application I couldn't go anywhere_ lost my appetite_ had headaches_ was really tired and not myself anymore & had terrible pain when walking_ sitting_ sleeping..

I started noticing redness around the scrotum area and discontinued use_ the next couple days the area then started getting worse and was moist and within about an hour it forms what looks something like puss. This started about three days ago and if doesn't go away soon I will check with my dr. Advice would be is to ONLY apply on the actual wart itself and be sure not to get it around any other area and to clean off the medication thoroughly.,M,20,21  days,4/11/2009,Aldara

Dermo prescribed aldara_ one packet a day for six weeks.  After 3-4 days I had a weeping scabby sore_ deeper and uglier and spreading a little.  I continued_ and it continued weeping.  After a week I made one packet last three applications but still weeping_ bleeding_ tender. It was a mess. I was a little fatigued.  By the middle of the third weeks it was so deep_ weepy_ tender and spreading to about 2"" diam. that I called the dermo.  She was not available but her advice nurse said stop using it.  I didn't even wait and call back to the dermo_ I was so happy to have SOMEBODY medical tell me to stop.  I stopped.  It started to heal so fast I could not believe it.  Big improvement every day. It started drying up right away_ within 36 hrs.  Then scabbed over_ nice and dry.  I was careful not to loosen scab.  Then the crusty little thing jus",And I was using 1/3 prescribed dose.

321, 4, HPV,Hey guys.  I'm writing this as encouragement for anyone with HPV.  I am a 24 year old healthy female that was recently diagnosed with genital warts_ which was extremely devastating to me considering I'm engaged to be married in October and have been in a committed relationship for 2 and a half years.  I had one perianal wart for some time that I always thought was a hemmorhoid until my latest doctor visit.  I first had the warts burned off with acid which was EXTREMELY painful and unpleasant and the warts grew back about 3 weeks later.  DEVASTATING!  I've spent the last month doing extreme research and I wanted to share my findings.  First_ my doctor recommended taking daily Folic Acid supplements to help PREVENT future outbreaks.  This seems to be helping.  I have also been seeing an acupuncturist to help strengthen my immune system to fight off the virus_ and he also recommended changing my eating habits to prevent future outbreaks.,Just make sure that before you put on the Aldara you cover all of your surrounding skin with vaseline so that if the aldara cream touches it it won't burn your skin.  You have to be super careful just to get the cream on the wart itself.  It kills skin cells_ so if it touches any other part of healthy skin it is going to make you sick.  Put the vaseline on first on surrounding skin (even the sides of your legs just in case) and then rub the aldara just on the wart with a q-tip.  I try to lay down right away and sleep for 6 hours (try to keep your legs open) and then wash off first thing in the morning.  I have only used a couple of treatments and I feel great and can tell the warts are decreasing.Worth a shot if you use it right!,F,24,1  weeks,4/2/2009,Aldara
322, 1, BCC,My doctor prescribed Aldara to treat 27 BCC's on various parts of my body. I've had over 30 BCC's removed previously via every method known and nearly all reoccurred_ sometimes several times (I'm treating one spot that's been surgically removed 4 times). I've been prescribed Aldara twice before (to treat just 2 spots) both times were unsuccessful_ but my doctor says there are no treatment alternatives left.I'm in week 2 and feel HORRIBLE - I ache everywhere_am lethargic and exhausted_ cough constantly and feel like an elephant is sitting on my chest. Just leaning back in my chair at work is painful. Forget the actual application sites (huge_ weeping_ scabby messes)_ the systemic effects are so dehabilitating I'm ready to throw in the towel and just live with the cancer. Why is this minor skin ailment so impossible for doctors to concur?,Be ready for lots of major side effects - you'll be unproductive and useless at work and at home for the entire course of treatment.  Use Aldara only as a very last resort_ and be ready for the treatment to be unsuccessful - it seems to be a crapshoot.,F,50,2  weeks,3/31/2009,Aldara

I have not been sexually active in the last 3 years_ however_ I just recently saw 4 small bumps on my pelvic area and was given aldara to treat it 3 times a week for 4 weeks. I have been using it as directed_ as of the 2nd week_ I saw no change in size of the bumps and started to develop open sores. The lotion never burned when applying it. I am now entering week 4 and still have bumps as well as new open sores. The sores don't burn or hurt_ they are just ugly and annoying.  NOT HAPPY.,F,24,3  weeks,3/24/2009,Aldara
325, 3, basal cell carcinoma,I am taking Aldara because I have had many spots burnt off with liquid nitrogen on my face_ hands and back over last 10 years (South African sun is vicious on a freckly skin).  Nitrogen treatment does not  remove the skin cancer for more than a few years. Every so often I have to go back and have new skin cancer on the edges of the old sites or the old sites themselves burnt off.  So now I am trying Aldara. Aldara causes the sites to which the cream is applied to flare up as well as other surrounding seemingly clear areas where there is hidden skin cancer.  For instance on my back the 2 large older areas measuring over 1 inch by 0.5 inch are now surrounded by about 15 other smaller spots where the aldara has activated my body to find skin cancer.  The result is series of crusts measuring the size of my hand. On my face I was treating 2 main spots. The aldara has found several old sites and a few new ones. The  7- 10 sites have crusted over and the crusts are now beginning to break off_,I will persist with Aldara. It is finding the skin cancer and killing it. Burning off with Nitrogen has not worked in the long term. So I do not see other solutions insight.,M,46,20  days,3/22/2009Email,Aldara
326, 4, GW,Itching_ burning_ EXTRAORDINARY pain when urinating.,The instructions say to wash the stuff off in the morning.  For God's sake_ do this!  This is unfortunately by second outbreak...I stopped using it the first time after 2 weeks because I was in so much pain_ so it's possible it never totally went away in the first place (the one wart I have is in the exact same spot it was in before).  Again_ be positively sure to WASH IT OFF in the morning.  The doctor told me how to apply it_ but failed to mention the washing off_ and acted shocked when I told her that I was so uncomfortable.  Keep in mind_ this is one ghetto doctor_ and said that it was probably my hair that was causing the discomfort...flawed logic_ I think.

327, 3, HPV (GW),So far minor soreness/itching_ some redness_ and scabbing,Taking it every other day_ I have applied it VERY lightly every other day (making one packet last a week as recommended by my Doc) I ahve now put it on 3 times. When I saw the doc_ he put acid on two of the warts_ which burned a little_ but he said would help jump-start the aldara because it would perforate the wart on a cellular level. The acid has scabbed and left one of the warts semi-open. Today I started to get a runny nose - it is unclear if im catching a cold or this is a symptom. I have also notices another tiny possible new wart forming. In addition my balls seem a bit tender. This all sounds worse written then I mean it too. overall I would say that if this works then these are VERY minor prices to pay. my question is_ is what ive experienced so far normal. and also_ my doc said that i dont need to necessarily apply it to every wart - as long as i get the main ones_ the rest will go away too.

My doctor ran tests for Herpes which I'm guessing will be negative_ and I was really upset about the possibility of Herpes. She didn't seem to know that this was a possible side effect even though it's listed in the literature that comes with the cream. The sores may have been from misuse because once I got the fever/sore throat/flu-like symptoms_ I felt sicker than I had in years and tried to use the cream anyway. I don't think I washed it off within the recommended time frame and I think it may have spread to an area near my vagina where there were no warts due to not rubbing the cream in completely.

I believe the sore developed because I was using too much Aldara. You really only need use the least bit of cream like the prescription says. The discomfort of the sore was worth it. I have been clear for 5 months and am crossing my fingers for forever.,I recommend Aldara. Maybe it's not for everyone but I think it is worth a try. Be patient and follow the directions.

I got over excited with the dissapearance of the intervaginal wart that I figured the more the better_ WRONG!. This resulted in a painful sore on healthy skin that wasnt effected by my gential warts.

370, 1, bcc,I'm one of those people who have had a plethora of debilitating side effects from my use of Aldara a year and a half ago. The worst symptoms are extreme muscle inflammation and deterioration_ joint deterioration_ and skin rashes. The most recent diagnosis is an autoimmune disease called dermatomyositus (literally means inflammation of the muscles and skin). My rheumatologist agrees that my problems were likely induced by my use of Aldara or something similar. I was very healthy before Aldara_ and since I used no other drugs_ I fully believe Aldara was the cause. To treat the symptoms_ I've been on high levels of prednisone_ as well as plaquenil and am now taking CellCept (an anti-rejection drug approved for kidney and heart transplant patients). These drugs suppress the immune system (which is causing the inflammation)_ and they have_ in turn_ indirectly caused a ruptured appendix (because it's suppressed_ my immune system didn't react to poisons that had gathered in my appendix) and a,Per a dermatologist's prescription_ I used Aldara for 3 months straight (every day). It did a wonderful job of eliminating the small BCC that I had on my torso. For me_ noticeable affects on my immune system didn't start until near the end of my 3-months of use. Had I known of the systemic effects that it would have on the rest of my body_ I NEVER WOULD HAVE USED IT! Many people appear to be lucky and have no long term effects from Aldara. However_ you don't know if you will be like those of us who end up with permanent health issues - even if you've used Aldara in the past. I wish that I had simply had the BCC surgically removed. Instead_ I ended up with permanent immune system problems_ extensive pock-scarring on my forehead and scalp from the shingles_ skin rashes and a host of additional possible issues related to the drugs I need to take.

Even though my post-treatment biopsy of the scar tissue was not malignant_ I have read in Merck Manual that scar tissue can hide future malignant cells. Would have been better to have surgically removed the cells. FDA should take this drug off the market!,F,61,8  days,9/6/2008Email,Aldara
394, 4, GW,Very itchy_ sore and red_ hurts when i pee...a lot_ ugh!,"I was actually perscribed aldra for a couple of stubborn warts on my hands because im afraid of the dry ice.  i happened to notice a little bump near my vagina one night and it started to slowly get larger. i thought ""SHIT! this sucks"" so i started using the cream down there. Yes_ its friggen painful but it is completly worth it. ive been using the cream down there for a couple of weeks now and i do see a difference. and as for my hands_ they are slowly getting better_ so i recomend this treatment for warts on other parts of the body also.

395, 3, GW,Burning_ itching_ stabbing pains_ aching. pain when urinating,I feel everyone's pain!  It seriously hurts. One thing I haven't noticed mentioned to help alleviate the burning and itching is ice packs- sounds mad I know but when it gets bad I wrap and ice pack in some cloth and hold it between my legs. It numbs the pain and the itching_ aqueous emulsifying ointment bp is also soothing- have a cold shower and apply to affected area then gently rinse but don't rinse it off completely and the cold and the moisturising helps dull the itch and burn!  Hope that helps,F,23,4  months,9/1/2008,Aldara
396, 4, genital warts,I have been applying Aldara to the entire area_ not just on the warts themselves_ which is something I will be changing. I have a patch of warts on each side of the base of my penis_ none on the head. I usually apply it around 4 or 5 days a week. I will usually keep applying it each night until the side effects get bad enough that I need a break. The minor side effects I've experienced after a month are slight itching and burning on the application area. The major side affect which is causing me the most problems is the two sores I have on each of my balls. They burn really badly (especially when cleaning in the shower). I found that laying off Aldara for a day or 2 is usually enough to let them heal enough that I'm not in pain. I also put antibiotic ointment on the sores to try to speed up the healing process. I think the main cause of these sores is from putting a whole packet of Aldara on during each application (too much)_ and applying to the whole area_ when it should just be on t,I have only been using Aldara for about a month. So far_ many of my warts have actually scabbed up and fallen off_ leaving behind a red area. This gives me hope that this will happen to the remaining warts. I am pretty happy with the results of using it_ even though I dread buying it because it's extremely expensive. I'll admit_ I feel very lonely and depressed having this virus_ even though my best friends know I have it. It's really depressing to me knowing that it's nearly impossible to totally get rid of this virus and that it can possibly reappear in the future. Having this also makes me depressed about how I will deal with my next sexual situation once I (hopefully) get the warts cleared up. Having this virus makes me not even want to talk to girls_ because I'm afraid of getting into a situation where I would have to embarrass myself by explaining my problem.,M,24,30  days,8/31/2008,Aldara

401, 4, Genital Warts,Severe itching_ broken skin as a result of itching the infected area_ redness_ and roughness following elimination of the wart,I have been using Aldara for about three weeks now. Slowly but surely_ it has been effective. Don't give up! I spent many nights awake with extreme itching in my genital area and sometimes I even had to wash the cream off when the irritation was too severe to handle_ but anything is better than walking around knowing you have genital warts. I did develop more warts in other areas of my genitals after starting treatment as noted by many other users_ but then you just have to attack those warts with the cream as well. I've also been getting at least two nightly treatments out of each packet. Use this stuff sparingly as it is extremely powerful! Good luck and things will get better for you...,F,19,3  weeks,7/1/2008,Aldara
402, 1, Gental wart,After a tiny 'flesh mole' on the very top of my vulva was diaganosed as a genetal wart_ my gyno prescribed aldara. I began using the medication and on fist aplication I felt a slight burning sensation (the pamphlet in the box said that is a sign that it is working)_ after continued use came the swelling and the beginings of what turned out to be the most horrific experience I have ever had using any medication. Both sides of my vulva swole up with hardened skin and soresed appeard all over my vagina (even my clit). It became painful to move_ walk_ clothes my legs_ sleep you name it and the tiredness just would not go away I slept and slept. I have not been able to go to work for the last 5 days and I dont know when I will be able to.,I would not recommend Aldara to anyone. It is not worth the pain and suffering.

I have been on heavy iron pills for a long time. Dr. just added Folic Acid to that in hopes that the iron pills will help get me started making bloodI could not expel water from my body_ I was sore all over and that dying would be better. My blood and it is now 2 years later I am still having problems. Of course the arrogance of the medical proffesion backing the 3mm company is no help to us.One Doctor would not listen he just said can not happen.

However_ this site has me relieved. I was thinking now I have HSV2_ but looks more like side effects of the medicine. It seems to work well for others_ but not for me. How rediculous to have a drug with severe side effects to treat something that is already awful? I'll deal with the GWs as before_ laser treatment. In the mean time_ can anyone recommend a good herbal_ or something_ to deal with GWs?,M,41,4  days,6/6/2008,Aldara
406, 1, Genital Warts,Nothing on the warts themselves.  They seem the same as they were when I started.  The WORST part is that recently I've begun ejaculating small amounts of blood in semen_ and that's NEVER happened to me before this medicine.

It burned and itched and atone morning a scratched too much in the shower and caused bleeding.  Once I finished the treatment I healed up except not all of my warts were gone.  Also_ I have two huge patches of depigmented skin which are not atttractive.  The dermatologist says that my skin colour may come back but is not promising anything.

Once a year I dreaded the process putting up with the nasty lesions for weeks_ but I thought I was at least getting ahead of my bcc's.  Decided to rethink the whole process_ because I was getting more and more lesions every year.  Found out through research and a great website Topicalinfor.com_ why I kept having so many reoccurences.,I have followed the protocol through Topicalinfo.com (a personal journey of another bcc person) WOW!!! It has been life transforming.  Detoxifying the pancreas_ learning about enzymes_ applying enzymes topically and taking orally_ without unnatural side effects has been great.  Boosting my immune system to heal myself using daily healthy (well researched) nutritional supplements_ 3000 mg Calcium and 3000 mg. Vitamin C_ pro-biiotics_ whole nutrition multivitamins_ on and on.  Great online support system too.  Long and short Aldara after 5 consistent years didn't help.

I applied the cream 3 times and now I can barely walk because I'm in soo much pain. Going pee is a chore in itself. I cry everytime I have to go and therefore have not been drinking fluids which in turn will probably dehydrate me. I have discontinue use of the cream for now until the area heals. I may start again and use a minimal amount as well as vaseline to protect the healthy tissue. Wish my doctor would have made me aware of these side affects and stressed how important it is to use a minimal amount. Hopefully I can make it to work tomorrow :(,F,23,3  days,4/28/2008,Aldara

It is hard to believe that a small amount of cream can do this to a healthy person.  This drug is very dangerous  dont be fooled if you start to get a servere headache within 2 hours of putting on the cream you are probarly going to have a bad reaction.

414, 2, Genetal Warts,Open sores on my balls(maybe because of overapplication) although i use it strictly according to the prescription_ i tend to rub it all over the whole area in sum weak attempt to kill all potential warts. But in actuality the cream got on my BALLS and i got two eye-sized blisters on each side of the sack_ with a new sore arriving closer to my thigh.  hasn't gotten rid of any of the warts_ but i have faith because i had chamydia during the time when it got really bad but when i got cured frm chlamydia the side-effects started to die down a notch. I wouldnt suggest it_ but at the same time i have faith and i took a break from using it for a little while until the sores clear and im going to take a different approach and be more careful with my application. Only applying it to areas that need tender love and care.,Yes I had all those nasty symptoms_ but im a warrior and i don't give up. Im gonna kill these bastards and there is nothing that is going to stop me. It was hard for me to walk_ sleep_ stand_ bend_ shower. I had to go through crazy amounts of pain. But im a warrior_ there is no pain that is going to stop me from killin these little bastards and i suggest every real man take that same approach unless you are in a situation where you really need to stop which is understandable. Just apply with care and have faith and be a warrior. besides_ nobody wants to deal with the consequences of having warts for a long period of time.,M,20,1.5  months,4/12/2008,Aldara
415, 5, Genital Warts,Slight redness/tenderness in the area applied.,I had the wart removed with Trichloroacetic acid by my doctor_ and then was prescribed Aldara to apply Mon_ Tuesday_ Wed_ for 4 weeks.  By burning it off first and then using the cream_ I could not even see anything after 2 weeks.  I just continued applying the cream to where it had been for the next 2 weeks to finish the 4 week treatment. Only apply a think layer_ and apply only to the area visibly affected_ and the side effects are minimal (or at least they were for me.)  I liked the 3 days on_ 4 days off method my doc prescribed_ even though most documentation says every second day.  I believe this helped with me not experiencing severe side effects since my skin had a 4 day break from the cream every week. Haven't seen a wart since treatment.,F,25,4  weeks,4/7/2008,Aldara
416, 4, Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma,Tingling_ Itching_ Redness_ Swelling on area,I have used the cream every night for 8 hrs. I have not noticed any flu like symtoms are anything not to be expected. I am only 27 years old and this is my first cancerous spot. It looks like a tiny dry spot on my shoulder blade. You wpuld not even be able to notice it. Now since using Aldara you can see it. It is small but very red!

I go for my 2 week check up tomorrow and I intend to discuss with the dermatologist some of the things Ive heard on here. However_ my sore does burn_ and ooze this clear liquid_ Its all scabbed up and ugly but it is a small price to pay if it works...I am a little worried about it though_ from some of these comments.,F,26,2  weeks,3/12/2008,Aldara
418, 4, genital warts,redness_ swelling_ herpes like blister on clitoris,overall i loved the medicine. the side effects were minimal and the warts were gone in under 3 weeks. however_ i had a small pimple/blister on my clitoris (probably got the medicine on it by accident.) it appeared one day and went away overnight and then a month later came back and stayed a week. it didnt hurt but was sensitive to the touch. had it tested for herpes and it came back negative. So if you develop a pimple looking thing from the medicine dont freak out like i did_ its most likely a side effect.,F,21, ,3/1/2008,Aldara

420, 1, gentail warts,OMG.... STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG. I was prescribed Aldara for 2 genital warts that were close to my leg between testicles and ass. I applied Aldara to the area with the EXACT amount and time period. Not only didnt it do a thing to the warts_ but it burned and scarred my testicle and penis. Something called Vitaligo due to the Aldara cream. My left nut now has white hair and is void of all pigment. Half of my penis is de-pigmented as well because it hung down over the area. WTF. The dermatologists tell me i'll mostlikely never regain pigment.,Aldara may be a good treatment for basil cell carcenoma and other cancers_ but its a friggin NIGHTMARE otherwise.

421, 5, ,GW - 4 years ago_ I had the LEEP procedure to remove the GW infected skin_ both externally and internally.  After the surgery_ my dr applied Aldara intravaginally 1/week for 10 weeks.  Surgery was painful and the aldara treatments were uncomfortable_ but never stopped me from living normally.  I tested negative for abnormal paps since then.  Stress increases your chances of GW and over the holidays_ while showering_ I discovered a 3 small GW's and still had leftover Aldara (expired by now) packets so I decided I would just apply the cream myself until my ob/gyn apt - WRONG THING TO DO!  I used an entire packet last Thursday night_ both externally and internally as my dr had done before_ went tanning the next day too - another HORRIBLE idea.

Aquaphor has been a great help. I use it on my lips during the day to keep them supple (and not crack)! At night before treatment I wash off the Aquaphor_ then use it to block the area_ and apply the Aldara.

In fact_ in the  beginning it was looking worse.The redness slowly dissapated and a scabby_ then later_ a browning started to appear on my forearms (the only place I have AK).6 months later I am very happy with the healing which has taken place.  Very mild redness in a few spots persists_ but overall my forearms are fairly clear of obvious lesions.  Many have been 'browned' over_ many are almost invisible.The healing on my arms continues_ and I am confident that in another 6 months they will appear even better than now.All in all I am very happy with the results of the Aldara therapy.,M,59,30  days,9/4/2007,Aldara

I ran a high fever_ and was unable to walk for weeks. I could not use the bathroom without crying from the pain. I went to the doctor and they told me it was probably herpes. They did the test_ and determined it was not. It was just a reaction to the medicine. No one warned me of these horrible side effects_ because if they had I would never of used this treatment.

Waiting for 2 month follow up with doc for all clear.  Did not need to use a lot: only went through two dose packets for entire 30 days.

All I can say is be sure you get a proper diagnosis from your doctor.  Three doctors I went to thought I had genital warts.  The final doctor told me I had molluscum (which acts like gw only instead of cauliflower clusters you have small pimple like growths).  She also said that my ""perianal"" gw was actually a very unhappy hemorrhoid! My doctor's son and daughter had an infantile form on their legs and arms. Though the aldara treated these molluscum just fine_ my doctor prescribed a special medication which she called ""Beatle Juice) and applied it in the office.  (You can get the molluscum de-cored and popped if you prefer.)  Within days my molluscum were GONE!  Make sure you get the proper diagnosis and get your partner treated.

My doctor says it really needs to be put on dry skin_ so the areas I have warts (somewhat moist areas inside my labia_ below my urethra_ etc) aren't ideal...it can easily rub off or not soak in. To those of you who have experienced results --is this true for anyone in a moist area_ or only more external/perianal areas? I'm rating a 2 because no improvement.

I used the aldara cream and I have to say i am amazed by what the cream as done. They have amazininngly decreased in size. I have to say to all of the people in here wining about the pain_ IT DOES HURT. But would you rather walk around with warts or try your hardest and deal with whtever you have to to get rid of them? It burns like a bitch but their is also only a 4-13% chance that theyll come back unline the other treatments that are 50%. Im dealing with the pain and I can seal a huge difference already.

Well it was. I experienced such painful and burning itching that I could not sleep and basically wanted to die. Yes_ for the first week or two my skin did seem to be a little bit better_ but then I grew some new GWs too. I took myself off of the medication a month later I have taken vitamins every day since i was diagnosed_ approximately 3 months ago.

Some people may want try that_ thuja is an antiviral essential oil ( VERY strong) It should NOT be taken if you are PREGNANT and it should NOT be taken internally.

I'm saying this because if you have herpes-looking symptoms from aldara and a doc gives you a blood test and BAM! you've got herpes- THAT MIGHT NOT MEAN THAT WHAT THE DOCTOR SAW ON YOUR GENITALS WAS A HERPES OUTBREAK! Please make sure you talk to your doctor about this! I once took a blood test for herpes which came back positive_ though I never had symptoms_ just an ex-boyfriend with cold sores_ so i was curious (the doctor told me that she generally doesn't encourage symptom-free ppl to get tested because it's sort of a pointless reason to worry).

Aldara was working perfectly for my smaller ones but not yet had started to change the bigger one_ which after much reading i think just needed more time to be penetraded!! but seriously the other treatments are mostly painful and some days hurt to walk and sit down_ they werent unbarable BUT Aldara really is heaven sent_ im going to the doctors tomorrow to ask to be put back on it! Also I just bought that online book about natural remedys im gonna print it and bring it into my doctor and see what she says!! but we shall see i will keep you all updated on whether its worth buying or not!!

435, 4, Genital and Perianal Warts,Slight itchiness/tingling and tenderness to areas applied_ a bit of skin discoloration and strangely enough_ an increased number of minor warts during application.,"Don't be afraid to use Aldara.  I was completely nervous after reading the postings on the board- so nervous I initially passed up the medicine and began looking into laser therapies_ etc.  After gathering up my courage_ I tried this medicine and it is worked wonders!  I had little to no itching_ almost no pain (ie none that was worse than having a painful pimple) and good results.  Follow the directions exactly and don't buy generic brands.  My regime included: clean area throughly.  apply vaseline around infected ""sites"" to avoid burning my healthy skin.  Use a q-tip to apply a thin layer.  Let dry.  Wash off at recommended time.  This stuff has significantly shrunk my large perianial wart (50%) and I have been using the medicine for three weeks.  The other minor warts are slowly disappearing.  I've accidently forgotten a few times to put the medication on_ but still have seen results! My only complaint is that it seems like I have an increased outbreak.

436, 5, Basal Cell,This is my third round of Aldara over a 3 year period for three different areas of Basal Cell. I am happy I had the option of Aldara instead of surgery. The hard part comes at the end when the medicine really begins to cause a reaction and the fatigue sets in. Other than red_ itchy and ugly_ I have no complaints,This is what I do know about Aldara. The Basal Cell people who gut it out are delighted with the results. The HPV people have mixed results and seem to endure more pain. I did not allow myself to be put off or swayed by what some of the fringe people (those with web sites) had to say about the drug. For me_ it was a blessing.,F,55,29  days,5/2/2007,Aldara
437, 3, GW,Burning_ itching_ small sores,I have been using aldara for about 4 weeks now. I have been using it 5 on and 1 off. I started with three little white warts around my clitoris and one near the opening of my vagina. These are all gone.  Today I noticed a few small dots about the size of a pen dot and look quite a bit like freckles.  Does anyone know if these are new warts or maybe just the skin discoloration side effect?  I have experienced most of the skin irritation side effects.  I have felt a little tired also.  Other than that I seem to be fine.  I found that using a vaginial antitch cream helped with the burning and itching. Overall I am pretty satisfied so far. I will be extremely satisfied if I don't develop any more warts. Has anyone tried liquid garlic supplements? I have read that garlic helps to naturally fight viruses.,F,27,4  weeks,5/2/2007,Aldara

Was very well pleased.  I wasn't sure if I needed to continue to take the medicine all the way through so I stopped for about 1 month...maybe less.  I got 3 more_ began using it again_ and noticed I had some on the inside.  Before reading the instructions about applying it to moist areas_ I applied some to both sides inside...where I should have just applied to areas with warts.  I did this the first time and thought that I was getting more_ but I think I was having an alergic reaction to it.  So the next time I put more on. Now I have 30+ sores and it hurts sooooo very much to pee.  I've just consulted my doctor_ and am waiting for an answer.  I would just suggest anyone to consult your doctor for proper application techniques. And don't think by adding more your helping. :-(  I'm not sure how to rate it though.

Unfortunately two more developed_ but have been mild and receding quickly. Two words to describe the past two weeks: fire crotch. Incredibly itchy. I've also had some redness that has the potential to develop into an ulcer_ afraid it was herpes. Highly improbable I have herpes since I've only had one partner_ and he doesn't have it.

The Dr. said that was what it was suppose to do_ the worse the better.  Ok_ I made it through that and I thought it was over.  But no!I have now been battling a face that is bright red with sores and a bright red rash.  The Dr. then issued 5-6 creams over the next 7 months.  (Every cream was over $100.)He was telling me I had Rosacea and then Seborrheic Dermatitis.  No it was all a reaction to the Aldara.  I went to another Dr. and they finely told me what it is.

After my first week of applications I saw that one of the warts had started to disappear. A new wart seemed to appear but i applied a small amount on it and it hasnt gotten bigger.

In some areas that I'm appling aldara_ I'm experience rawness -- not an open sore_ but could get there. She recommended laying off that area until it heals a bit (but applying on my other warts)_ and continuing in this way moving forward. She also recommended squatting in a warm/tepid bath to  help healing/ease discomfort. SHe suggested applying aldara with a Q-tip (to more easily avoid getting on healthy skin) and applying either zinc oxide or vaseline to the healthy surrounding skin *before* applying aldara to the warts - to help keep aldara off the healthy tissue.

452, 5, Genital Warts,Mild itching/discomfort_ slight reddening_ sensitivity to touch.,Here are my suggestions to those using Aldara to get rid of HPV/genital warts: 1) Wash off after 8 hours. It significantly cuts back on the side effects. 2) DON'T use on LARGE or GROUPS OF genital warts. Mine were small and in 3 separate locations_ namely just below my pubic mound_ my clitoris_ and just above my anus. If your doctor gave you the option of chemical burning or Aldara_ choose the burning; it might be temporarily more painful_ but the wart is more likely to disappear. 3) Take as prescribed on the package. More than 3X a week is an overdose and will significantly increase the side-effects. 4) Be patient and regular. Choose a time to apply the Aldara so you don't forget. I applied mine at 10am and washed it off when I came home from classes. 5) Apply only to the spots you need Aldara.

475, 5, Genital Warts :(,The only side affects that I have noticed at this time would be redness and severe itching even after I have washed off the cream.  Sometimes pain with urination but only because of the itching.,So far I haven't noticed anything else but let's hope it works cuz I'm sick of going to the doctors every two weeks for the acid treatments,F,22,2  weeks,3/6/2007,Aldara
476, 4, Genital Warts,The morning after my initial application I felt a little more tired than normal_ but was relatively fine_ aside from a runny nose. The next day I felt a little better. After my second application I was definetely feeling sick and tired_ the next not so bad. Now it is the day after my third application and I feel like I got hit by a bus_ runny nose_ itchy eyes. sore muscles and joints_ ear ache_ very sore throat_ extremely tired and fatigued.,I dont get sick that often_ and i dont ever remember being quite this ill. But the medication is working_ from what i can tell_ my warts are reduced in size_ from what i have been reading 3m should consider modifying their medication because of all the miserable side effects_ but you do have to give to get i guess.,M,22,6  days,3/6/2007,Aldara
477, 5, genital warts,swelling_ blisters_ soreness_ flue-like symptoms,yes I will agree with what everyone else seems to be saying_ the side effects are pretty awful. they can be very very painful_ and in my case have been. however_ it works. within 2 application about half my warts_ and i had a lot of them_ were gone. i also have internal warts_ which have also reduced in size even though i cannot place the cream on them. my suggestions are to use it very sparingly_ i wasn't careful to do this and i think that is why my symptoms have been so bad_ however this virus is something i have faith my body can overcome with help. i think this is a great medicine_ and however painful and unbearable the syptoms are_ to me its worth it.,F,18,2  weeks,3/5/2007,Aldara
478, 5, keratosis,I am currently using Aldara on two areas_ one area has been treated with Aldara before and another area never treated. I have had a number of large scabs form_ redness_ tenderness_ and slight itching on previously untreated area. On area previously treated a year ago there have been minor spots of scabbing and of redness. The previously treated area was already well cleared of keratosis so the reaction to the second application wasn't as extreme as it had been before. The aldara had done it's job.,I requested the second treatment of aldara from my dermatologist_ knowing that I would probably have a reaction of scabbing_ crusting_ and redness but I was willing to put up with the possible reaction for the benefit of not having to have my hands and arms constantly being treated for precancerous lesions by being frozen off with liquid nitrogen.,F,60,4  weeks,3/3/2007,Aldara
479, 3, genital warts,swelling of the external vagina area_ sores_ pus like oozing from sores_  chills,last week_ i had my first treatment. the doc applied Trichloroacetic acid to the warts and gave me aldara to take home. now i have these sores and i've been thinking that she applied the TCL to unaffected areas corroding good skin! now_ i'm wondering_ after reading these posts_ if it's the aldara causing these horrible sores. or both?

481, 3, To  treat basal cell carcinoma nose,My entire nose had sores all over it with cracking and bleeding. It burned as I applied it. I did feel very tired during tx. My face swelled and became red on the right side. My eyes were swollen. My back ached a few times as it had during my menstural periods. I took tylenol to relieve symptoms.,"I wanted to try aldara since the basal cell cancer on my nose returned after  I had MOHS surgey just two years ago.  My dermatologist said that the MOHS surgery could have spread the cancer. A nurse said she had never seen anyone look as bad as I did from using the aldara. My dermatologist said the I was ""done"". He said that I had alot of sun damage and that the aldara did what it was supposed to do. I was to use it nightly seven days a week for six weeks--washing it off after eight hours.I made an appt to see my Dr. toward the end of my fourth week. That is when he immediately took me off of it. My entire nose is red and bleeds some. My Dr prescribed an antibotic cream to apply 2x day. I am to return for an appt. in two-three months. The Dr won't do a biopsy but will jsut look at my nose and see if cancer is gone.(?) I am concerned about scarring. I always wear makeup with 15 SPF-- that's NOT enough protection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",F,54,4  weeks,2/25/2007Email,Aldara
482, 5, Genital warts,Very minor redness_ itching_ swelling and burning during the first week or two of treatment. Side-effects faded later into treatment period.,Don't listen to the horror stories here or anywhere else. I did that and was nearly put off using the cream. Now it's working wonders for me. Use the cream sparingly and at the right times and you'll be fine.,M,19,4  weeks,2/21/2007Email,Aldara
483, 4, genital warts on the penis,redness_ sore_ pain_ sensitivity,First of all yes genital warts completely suck. Secondly here's what I've learnt so far. Use vaseline to keep the aldara cream from coming into contact with non afected areas. I was applying the cream directly to the warts_ which I have under my foreskin_ but I found the area that were becoming red/most painful were the seconary areas which contacted the cream when I pulled my foreskin back down. This was obviously very annoying_ but using vaseline has really sorted that out. I do now however have a small red blemish on my penis head which doesn't appear to be going away. I read that permanent discolorment of the skin can happen from using the cream. Even more reason to use the vaseline_ and target only the affected areas.,M,26,4  weeks,2/19/2007,Aldara
484, 3, Genital Warts,Intense burning_ red sores_ itching_ body aches,I used it for about a month but not regularly and it was workin so i stopped but then they came back so i've been using it for 8 weeks now regularly and i think it's workin good again_ but i'm soo sore from it and i put it on at night so it really messes up my sleep when i put it on..but i guess if it's workin i gotta keep usin it! ooo and lately i have episodes like i have a UTI_ but i def don't it just has given me the sensation i have to urinate but then i really don't have to.,F,22,8  weeks,2/18/2007,Aldara

486, 3, HPV,Blisters_ swollen labia_ extreme itching_ burning when trying to urinate_ nauseous feelings by the 2nd week of application.,I found out I had HPV and my doctor originally tried an in- office procedure which all but cleared up my symptoms.  The only ones that are left are the original warts_ so I was perscribed Aldara.  I have all the side effects that are listed_ and have had blisters since the 2nd application in the first week.  The warts initially appeared to whiten in colour and are now back to a redish colour they were before I applied the cream.  I am really worried about the blisters not healing and ending up with scars.  I've started to apply polysporin to the areas that I accidentally put cream on (LESS IS MORE!!!!).  I wish I had known about the Vaseline thing earlier_ but I will try that now.  I haven't seen any of the warts diminish yet so I'm not quite sure about the cream's effectivemess_ but the side effects are NOT MILD-they range from MODERATE to SEVERE.  Take Advil while you're on this to avoid feeling tired/sluggish.,F,22,2  weeks,2/17/2007,Aldara

Did not know this was because of Aldara until I went for my checkup last week.  Dr. is all excited because I am having such a strong response.  THEN she asked my if I was having any of these symptoms.  I feel horrible.,This is my second round_ last year did this and it was no where near as severe-no side effects_ but not such a strong response.  Have been to Mexico twice and through a Colorado summer since last application.  So_ I sustained a lot of damage between then and now.  I know Aldara works_ but this sucks.

I want to continue use_ because I saw that some people got through the pain and are now wart-free. Having said all that_ I was applying it wrong_ as I have read here. I read the warning label of only applying it to the affected area and not to the skin around it_ but I thought it would help more if I applied it to the entire area. BIG MISTAKE! I will do it correctly next time_ and hopefully it will hurt less. I'm going to try to be optimistic_ but it burns so bad to pee_ sit_ stand_ walk_ lay down_ wear underwear_ etc. that it will be very hard. I'll try to post again if it gets any better.

500, 1, bcc,It is almost one year later_ and after various visits to specialists_ I had the good fortune to find a behavioral pain doctor who had studied immune system modifiers_ and a phd student who had written papers on the topic.  Previous medical doctors wouldn't even read about this medicine; very weird.  So the pain guy said that basically what I thought was wrong_ really was.  The cytokine storm induced by Aldara was indeed attacking my muscles and causing them to ache.  The solution he gave was to go on pain killers over a long period of time and he said that my body will slowly recalibrate itself if the reaction is prevented from occuring.  I was so thrilled... I had been feeling hopeless and nuts.,So I've been taking Ultram (3/day) and Vicoprofen (1 1/2/day) since June 06_ and it is working.  I feel about 2/3 less pain than I did 4-5 months ago_ no problems walking and functioning.  I just cut back from 3 to 2 doses per day.  I estimate in another 6 mos_ I hope I don't feel achy at all!  It would be nice to wake up in the morning and not feel crappy.  This may be a rare reaction_ but it has been horrible and I appreciate the forum to share about it.,F,49,14  days,1/29/2007Email,Aldara

Before using the medecine i didn't have any effect on my penis_ but after 2 weeks using it (3 times a week) the result is awfull. I don't know what to do_ if I have to keep using it or not. The doctor say it's normal_ but I'm sceptical. I'm supposed to stop using it in less than a week but my penis is in a very bad shape. If you hace any advice to give me_ please I will be gratefull.,The strange thing is that before I didn't have ANY effect_ and after using it_ my penis is in a very bad state. But when I use it in the night_ the day after the side effects starts to go away. It is totally contradictory_ and I don't know what to do???,M,33,3  weeks,1/28/2007Email,Aldara

After about two weeks I noticed a small rash developing which was a little itchy (nothing one scratch couldnt stop)_ but other than that_ no side effects.

504, 4, actinic keratoses,I never had any major skin problems such as acne_ with just the occasional AK that were removed with cryosurgery. However_ I noticed some red and rough bumps over the right side of my face in the cheek area that seemed to be growing. I have comsiderable sun damage from growing up in Texas and being fair-skinned. I have had a squamous cell carcinoma removed from my lip with MOHS surgery. My doctor told me about Aldara_ and warned me that i shouldn't plan any photo-ops in the near future when I decided to undergo treatment. She said there were just too many lesions to treat with cryosurgery. She didn't really warn me how ugly this would be. I'm now starting the 3rd week of 3X/week treatment over my whole face. As you might imagine from the other comments_ the results so far are dramatic and not pretty. having never had troubled skin_ I now know what it must be like. I feel like a 16 year-old with acne.

505, 5, GW,FYI - PUT 5 TO BE ON TOP. I had absolutely no side effects from the medication until about 1 week ago. I started having a minor itch on the area being applied and now it's burning like crazy_ I've had some skin breakage (with bleeding - minor) and a blister in the surrounding area. I stopped using it for now and it's sloooowly getting better. The warts are almost gone though and I've been using it for a few months now (3x's a wk). THIS CRAP BURNS! I think I will make an appointment to have my doc take a look at it to make sure everything is A OK!,When I first had the reaction I thought I had something more serious (even though I'm married and don't sleep around). Now I think I feel better to know I'm not the only one experiencing these horrible side effects. I also think I was applying a little too much and maybe should have stopped when the itching began. If you're starting to use this cream just apply a thin layer on the affected area_ don't over do it!,M,27,3  months,1/16/2007,Aldara

Had common side effects but were bearable. On the 12th week I had a severe reaction - very painful_ extremely swollen_ blistered skin and had to stop using for 2 weeks. Resumed again and on 14th week all external warts have gone but I now have several internal ones which weren't there before! My consultant says the aldara acts on the immune system and so will deal with the internal ones too_ but I'm sceptical. I have tried many other remedies and suggestions for boosting my immune system too. But I have had this for 10 months now. I can only say dont be put off if it doesn't work immediately. I would welcome any suggestions to rid me of internal warts. The only alternative my consultant has suggested is cryotherapy but I am too much of a coward.,F,40,14  weeks,1/12/2007Email,Aldara
509, 3, HPV genital warts,The first time I found the lumps I was mortified. I never thought this would happen to me. I only have ever been with boyfriends and I am always careful. I started using Aldara and after the second application I was feverish_ my muscles ached_ I thought I was coming down with a flu and by the third app. my genitals were red_ blistering and I couldnt walk it was so bad_ I couldnt urinate it was the most unbearable pain. I stopped using for a month_ then resumed with 3 applications (mon_wed_fri). The same side affects accured. I stopped for another month then did three more applications had another month break then another 3 apps and they were then gone. (12 applications all up with month breaks between) It took a long time and the pain was so sever and intense_ but it did eventually work. It has been 9 months since the first occurance and the GW have returned. Im using Aldara again and now it is moreso unbearably itchy than sore_ maybe my body is getting used to the medication? While I,I was wondering about reoccurances_ could anyone tell me? How many more times will I get this on average throughout the next year or years of my life? I have had one recurance and now the warts are internal aswell. Will these keep reccurring? I want to have a normal life again.,F,21, ,1/12/2007Email,Aldara
510, 5, HPV - Genital Wart,Had HPV (male) used for 8 weeks - after week 6 noticed great improvement.  Saw my consultant again after 7 weeks and informed me that the warts had gone.Side effects:pretty much all of them shown in the leaftlet accompanying the medication.  Experienced flu like symptoms_ acheing in joints and hot / cold flushes.  I have also experienced what the consultant called chemical burns on the area where the cream has been applied_ he has prescripbed me some ointments to relieve this.  IT has got rid of the warts though so may be the side effects were worth it.,Use it as directed by your doctor / consultant so do not exceed the dose or it can cause even more severe side effects.  Most people that Aldara doesn't work for have weak / deficient immune systems so it can either take longer or not work on them.  Good luck,M,28,8  weeks,1/9/2007,Aldara
511, 3, Genital Warts,After about 1.5 weeks of using Aldara I noticed peeling sore skin surrounding the warts and slight itchiness.

520, 5, Basal Cel Carcinoma-Gorlin Syndrome,Redness_ itchiness_ clear discharge_ scabbing_ A redness which continued (but gradually went away months after using)_ occasional bleeding.  Never had any flu-like symptoms (and dont believe they are related to Aldara).  Because of genetic disorder (gorlin Syndrome) took for a long time (1 year) on differing parts of body....got swollen glands (under chin_ by neck_ and armpits) and am not sure if this part was do to the aldara---but I stopped applying and the swollen glands stopped a week or so later each time,I have had numerous (100 plus) basal cell carcinomas.  With the genetic disorder I hvae called Gorlin Syndrome and being fair complected_ I wish I had discovered it earlier...before the multiple surguries and consequential scars on my face to have them removed.  What it allows you to do is control when you apply it (and even when you can stop) and you can always go back to the area if all of the bcc was not gotten.  I have used it both on superficial basal cells and with success on basal cells which were already lumps... The stuff works.  The stuff avoids surgery....Its just a question of weather you can accept the redness_ itching_ scabbing_ etc.   I do not believe it when people say they have flu-like symptoms due to Aldara.  I have never had those.  Then again_ maybe it affects people differently.,M,37,1  years,12/24/2006Email,Aldara
521, 5, Solar Keritosis on hands & head,I experience cold symptoms after two weeks of using miniscule amounts. The recuring/non healing sores are responding nicely after 3 treatments/week for 2 weeks. Scheduled for 4 weeks on/4 weeks off.,Using pinhole in packet and pointed tooth pick to get the smallest amount possible amount which is then applied with the tooth pick and massaged to clearness with the finger of a rubber glove. I apply at night_ wash it off well in the morning. I am ammazed at the progress I have observed already. The nonhealing sores are skinned over already and looking much better. I will be checking with my doctor in another 2 weeks and will post further if there is more to tell.,M,65,2  weeks,12/23/2006,Aldara

I went and saw a real derm. (also friend ofthe fam) and he told me to take the aggressive approach of 5 nights on_ 1 off.  Worked great.  basically_ he said that what we are going for is irritation.  For those of you who are getting no affects and no results_ step it up.  for those of you getting too many side affects_ back off.  Remember_ everybodys body is different and will react differently_ pay attention.  as of now_ they are almost gone.  Here is a quick description ofthe healing process; w/application 5X a week_ gws became red and irritated with slight itching after application.....after ~3 weeks of this they became a little harder and a little whiter.  then itchiness increased and they became even harder...then_ very itchy_ a little sore_ they kinda turn into a scabish type thing_ but not because of a open sore_ they just kinda turn scabby and shrivel from the inside out...then,M,24,5  weeks,12/15/2006,Aldara
528, 5, genital warts,I first had chemical treatments applied to my small outbreak of warts and then go tried of going to the doc. So she prescribed aldara I first started using and would have such intense itching that I would wake up from it and would continue the following day even after washing off_ but no other side effects. After using for about 4 weeks I had severe results of bright red skin all around area of treatment and a couple ulcers. This scared me greatly that I had herpes until I saw this website I am not as scared since it seems common_ but I am still went to get tested and am waiting for results. I think the reason I have these problems is because I have sensitive skin and I used too much cream each time I used so pls be careful and under use instead of over. The only good thing that came from aldara is that my warts are almost gone I have one that has decreased is size left_ but I am waiting to use medicine again until the sores go away.,It works_ but the side effects suck pls use small amounts its worth it in the long run.,F,20,5  weeks,12/14/2006,Aldara
529, 4, HPV - Genital Warts,Intense itchiness_ excrutiating pain_ swelling_ redness_ discharge... etc.,My doctor should've warned me about the side effects_ which_ apparently_ occur quite frequently while using this cream. I wasn't prepared for the pain. It hurts to walk_ sit_ pee and do other normal everyday activities. I don't move from my bed unless I have to. The warts seem to have gotten smaller_ but it hurts enough to make me cry. And trust me_ I'm big on pain. I have been miserable for the past two days. I've been smoking chronic to ease the pain. It works. Well_ just as long as I don't move too much. Tattoos don't even hurt this much. I apply it three times a week with a check up in mid january.

None have worked and condition deteriorates daily...am very concerned that these are not warts and now the side effects from the cryo/podo treatments are disfiguring.

For instance_ putting the cream on Tuesday night_ by Thursday morning I'm feeling better. I also had the flu-like symptoms but those only lasted a few days. I'm just afraid the warts aren't actually gone and it this is a bit of beginners aldara luck_ and soon they will reappear as is possible.   one tip: use vasoline if itchy or in pain_ it doesn't burn the open sores and seems to do something_ even if its just a mental thing,,F,22,16  days,11/29/2006,Aldara

I have so much pain_ I cannot sleep for two nights. Burning and throbbing pain. Then I have two days of headache and flu like symptoms. What is this doing to my system?

After 8 days_ one spot was a small open sore_ but skin reaction still pretty mild (compared to the Efudex I'd used before as a preventative). The day after applying Aldara to the open sore_ I experienced severe systemic effects: worst nausea I've ever had in my life_ severe headache_ dizziness_ body aches. Stopped using Aldara and called dr. Told me to wait until I was back in town (was visiting friends when bad effects happened) to re-start treatment. Have not re-started treatment and don't plan to. Will discuss alternatives with dr. Since stopping Aldara 4 days ago_ most symptoms resolved except dizziness/loss of balance_ which is very noticeable when I stand/walk but not while seated. Hope that resolves soon too. I have had problems before with an over-active immune system_ and after doing more research_ I realize now that Aldara is not the right medicine for me.,F,44,9  days,11/28/2006,Aldara

So I tried Aldara.  I followed the package insert as written_ only applied to the spots where there were warts and washed it off in the morning.  I used a mirror to make sure I applied it accurately.  I felt horrible the day after use for the first week and a half with the symptoms described.  However_ my warts were 99% cleared after 1 week.  It was like a miracle.  The skin irritation started occuring after about 2 weeks_ I had open sores in the spots where I still had warts left.  So I haven't used the cream now in 5 days and will start again once I am healed for the last pesky wart that hasn't gone away yet.",F,27,18  days,11/27/2006,Aldara

I took it for three weeks with no results_ losing faith quickly. And then all of a sudden in two days 90% of them were gone. I am extreamly pleased with this medicine_ i still have one more week to take it so I am hoping for the leftover 10% to leave during this time.

My vaginal area is very swollen and very painfull_ and is constantly burning. Even standing in the shower if the water hits it its extremely painful_ it is worse than getting a tattoo. However i am fairly certain that this is beacuse i applyed to much of the cream in an eager attmept to be rid of it. I stress to you to only use the smallest amount_ one sachet of 250mg should last you about 3 applications and be sure to rinse it off after the 10 hours. I know you will want to be free of it as soon as possible but follow strict instruction and you will be much better off. My warts have decreased in size slowly but not without extreme pain. Though in all i suggest giving aldara a try if you plan on using it correctly.,F,18,2  days,11/26/2006,Aldara

I noticed that a lot of people posting on this site wanted to know_ as I desperately did_ how long it takes for the symptoms to go away.  After stopping the use of Aldara_ it took approx. 4 days for the sores to go away and pain to subside.  The wart did begin to grow again.

Shows that the drug is working.,I apply it according to my dr's instructions:  1/2 packet 3x/wk every other day.  I grew up in L.A. and went to the beach alot in the summer when young.  I take vitamins and herbs daily and I know some of these things have a detoxifying effect_ don't know if this is why I have not suffered the side effects mentioned by others.  I wonder why some are getting the severe headaches/muscle aches/etc.   Seems that there needs to be more research into this drug's side effects (and how many other drugs!)_ as this does have me concerned.

The warts are definitely not getting worse but theyre also not getting that much better.  The itching really does wake up in the middle of the night tho its horrible.  A few days ago a couple little red sores popped up and I got so scared thinking it was herpes.  Thank god I found this site and not I'm pretty sure its just a side effect of the medicine_ it sounds pretty common.

I have been deadly upset that I might have herpes.  I haven't been to a doctor yet_ but I'm still going to get tested just to make sure.  Since my last partner I have been tested for everything under the sun_ and I only should presently have GW. This is the second drug I am trying_ the first did work not too badly_ but it smelled so strong my secret didn't feel safe.  You can find it at FONOILS.com if you're braver than I am.  It's natural_ and burns a little_ but you won't get these herpes like sores.  This site has comforted me that these sores are most likely not herpes.  I feel like using Aldara is hell_ but it will be worth it in the end.  As for those of you who are ridiculing the people who can't use the aldara anymore_ go fuck yourself.  You have to realize that some people have harsh reactions as my ex girlfriend did as well.  I saw first hand the difference of how we both reacted to Aldara.  She could NOT continue treatment.

ALONG WITH SOME PEOPLE'S SKIN JUST GENERALLY BEING TOUGHER WHEN IT COMES TO THIS CREAM_ IT WOULD APPEAR DIFFERENT ZONES OF THE GENITAL AREA REACT DIFFERENTLY. THIS MAY BE A DANGEROUS THING TO SAY_ BUT I THINK THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR FREQUENCY OF APPLICATION ARE JUST 'GUIDELINES'. I WOULD SUGGEST EXPERIMENTING WITH IT IF ITS NOT WORKING- WHETHER IT IS BECAUSE OF A SENSITIVE AREA_ TOUGH AREA_ SENSITIVE SKIN TYPE IN GENERAL_ OR TOUGH SKIN TYPE IN GENERAL. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THEY COULD CONSTRUCT AN APPLICATION REGIME THAT IS THE SAME FOR ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE_ SO EXPERIMENTING THE FREQUENCY OF APPLICATION IS THE WAY TO GO.

I'm trying again_ but it's my second week and the itching is horrible. My doc told me that it wasn't a common side effect and I probably just had recurring yeast infections. Funny what typing ""aldara_ itchiness"" into a search engine will bring up. This site cleared my suspicions of an allergic reaction causing the itch. I'm glad to hear there have been so many success stories. I guess I'm just not one of the lucky ones. Interesting how it seems to cause acne in a lot of people.

Whole area incredibly swollen_ ulcer like sores developed_ discharge_ incredibly burning when urinating_ hard to sit an walk. I haven't used for four days and my symptoms are slowly improving.  I recommend taking a break if sores develop_ let the sores heal and then continue treatment.  Do not apply treatment to area where sores developed.  Resting the area as much as possible so it's not irritated as much (sitting_ laying down) seems to help.  I just gritted my teeth and took the pain as best I could.

After the first month I started to clear up by each use and only experienced itching on the night of use or day after.

I had a terrible reaction_ went to the doctor.  He took one look_ said I had herpes and left me crying in the office.  Why herpes now?  Usually the first outbreak occurs within two weeks of exposure.  I've been w/ my boyfriend for 5 months_ and he does not have it.  THE SIMILARITY OF ALDARA SIDE EFFECTS AND HERPES MUST BE NOTED BY HEALTH CARE PRACTIONERS!  I've now stopped Aldara and am eagerly waiting for these excruciated symptoms to go away.

I now suffer leg muscle pain if I have to walk even a short distance_ previously I was walking to walk three days a week (45mins)_ this is not possible at the moment.  Have been to my doctor and am awaiting blood test results.

564, 3, HPV/Condyloma,Sometimes this medication did not bother me at all.  Other times_ there would be extreme itching.  This might be too much information_ but I'll share it because I think it's important for people to have some idea about what to expect with HPV and Aldara.  I had approx. 4-5 small warts on my anus that were itching and actually started to bleed slightly after wiping.  I was very distressed about this and made an appointement with my doctor.  I was very embarassed about this and I knew from looking on the internet that it was HPV.  During the doctor visit_ I have cryotherapy (not sure about spelling) done - but this is where they use liquid nitrogen and freeze them.  This was moderately painful_ but not that bad.  Five days later_ I started Aldara.  It has been five weeks now_ and the warts are gone_ or at least not visible.  It was my understanding that I needed to take the medication for 3 months_ so I have quite a while to go yet.   It is difficult to apply Aldara to the anus_,This medication seems to have worked well over all.  I would emphasize_ however_ that the local irritation can be intense.,M,28,5  weeks,10/22/2006,Aldara
565, 1, HPV,I am so glad I found this website to know that I am not alone in  these side effects...I have been in the worst pain of my entire life_ and I only used three applications on external GW's. My doctor did not tell me anything about possible side effects and then I got a 102 degree fever out of no where after my second application. A day later I could barley walk and I feel like screaming when I pee. I have huge open sores on my vagina that are not going away very fast. This has been a nightmare. I dont even know it it is doing anything for my warts because everything is so swollen I can't see my actual skin underneath. I doubt this pain is worth it.,Unbearable pain while urinating.

After around 3 weeks_ the area was scabbed over.  I stopped for a week and then continued and it healed up very well.During this time I had what I would describe as a bad cold and then the flu.  Body aches_ bronchitis_ the whole lot.  Seemed to be hard to get over.I am now treating another small area on my forehead and am 3 weeks into that.  Same side effects.  I haven't had a cold or the flu for 3 years_ but have had it 3 times now whilst using Aldara.  Thought something else was wrong_ so was actually a little comforted to read it's a common side effect.

I asked my Dr if I could try Aldara but very scared at the side effects that I have heard it might cause. However_ in desperation I am trying it. Had my 3rd application last night and warts seem bigger. I will persevere though as I haven't had any pain and it is early days.

I have noticed no real affects on anything external.  Last week_ I felt something like a cut on my labia mejora (right side). Put iodine on it like an idiot_ so not sure if raised raw patch is due to that.  Now noticed a similar patch on other side closer to anus.  No MC there though_ and have not put aldara there.  Like everyone else_ it has made me think I have herpes_ even though I haven't had sex since December!

I burns a little bit when the pee goes over the site but I've found a way to avoid that.  When you pee_ lean forward so that your chest is paralell with your lap.

580, 5, sBCC,All: The most debilitating are the bodyaches and fatigue.  I have been using a full packet 5xwk for the past 3 wks on a large area of my chest and stomach. Ibprofen helped some with reducing the bodyaches. Now I'm trying Aleve and it seems to be helping more in curbing the flu symptoms. Still_ two days out of the week find me sleeping all day due to fatique. I am cutting back on using the entire packet and will probably reduce it to half to see if the side affects can be reduced.,I've used it three times over the past five years: on my cheek_ jaw and chin with good results (my chin took two seperate treatments to resolve). In many cases of minor (early) diagnosis my doc likes to apply light cryosurgery followed with 1-2 wks of Aldara every-other-night. It seems to work -very_ very limited scarring. Doc has found that many patients won't complete the more intense therapy so he tries this more limited approach. He says that it has worked well for some of his patients_ especially the ones who would otherwise give up. Now_ I'm trying the 6wk 5xwk therapy on my chest and am struggling with it since the area is fairly large and involved -80+ spots. Doc thinks a lot of what I see in rection is not sBCC_ but AK and/or ohter more routine skin problesm like infected hair folicles.

I wish my doctor had explained more of the side effects and what to expect_ because all sorts of things ran through my mind (herpes? yeast infection? etc).  No--you're going to feel itchy_ burning_ pain_ etc. but it won't last forever and decreases the amount of virus in your skin to help reduce another outbreak and the chances of you passing it on to others.  I can't believe how expensive it is though!

598, 5, HPV,mild to moderate itching_ which went away after treatments ceased.,First_ let me say that i'm not advocating the next paragraph as a viable option_ i'm just describing my experience and course of action with Aldara. I am a regular cannabis user. I developed perianal warts and was prescribed Aldara by my doctor. After looking up the way that it works_ I found out that it stimulates the immune system into a more 'aggresive' mode. The downside is that Aldara does not specify what to attack exactly_ so people with very responsive immune systems can develop complications from the drug. A friend of mine (and fellow cannabis user) had used Aldara some years back_ when he was not consuming cannabis_ and it caused some very nasty side effects_ but his warts were cured. The warts reappeared some time later. He was prescribed Aldara once more_ used it_ and surprisingly_ his warts went away after a few weeks of treatment without any major side effects. (continued),F,35,3  weeks,7/25/2006,Aldara
599, 5, hpv,continued...,The only difference was that during the time of the second treatment_ he was using Cannabis on a regular basis. The same results happened for me when I used Aldara while using Cannabis. I wonder if the immunosupressant properties of THC 'calmed' my immune system into a more benign response. Definitely not a recommendation to anyone who doesn't already use_ but just an observation of what occured in this case. Good luck!,F,35,3  weeks,7/25/2006,Aldara

I don't mean to be insensitive about this_ and i'm sorry you've had such horrible experiences_ but instead of telling people to never ever use this medicine_ you should just recommend cautious consideration to potential users. I was VERY paranoid after reading all these negative posts to the point where I seriously considered scratching Aldara off my list. After researching my options and consulting with unbiased health care professionals_ I was put at ease about using Aldara. The results? after ONLY 3 applications to the affected area_ my warts began to dissapear. Within a matter of a few days_ they were completely gone_ leaving no scars_ blisters or oozing at all.

I applied the thinnest possible layer ONLY to the infected area_ being VERY careful to not let it touch unaffected skin. I left it on overnight and washed it off when taking a shower in the morning. I also did not use it every day_ but every other day_ fearing that excessive applications would worsen the condition. As i've said_ 3 apps later and I saw the results beginning to take place. Mild ithcing was the worst discomfort I had... matter of fact_ I was bitten by a mosquito during treatment and the itch from the bite was more distracting than the Aldara was. I am still clear and I feel as if I never had HPV at all. I personally would recommend Aldara as an efficient treatement_ but i'll take my own advice and also recommend that you research all options and all resources/opinions to formulate an educated treatment decision_ keeping in mind that paranoia n,M,30,2  weeks,7/25/2006,Aldara

Everyone should be VERY wary about using this drug.,Aldara acts on the immune system in a way that even the makers (3M) dont fully understand.It works by firing up the immune system without telling it exactly what to do or where to do it_ therefore if you are a highly responsive person your immune system can become WAY over excited and attack your body causing anyting to happen. I just survived a brain tumour from using Aldara and I know of many more people who have had terrible experiences using this drug.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

607, 4, HPV,I am in my second week of using the drug and am not done yet. This drug works by stimulating your immune system and helps it fight off the virus. It sounds great on paper but once you use it its a whole different story. My penis developed open sores that hurt really fucking bad. I was in so much pain I was having trouble sleeping. My penis became wrinkled and flakey. Another thing... You wont be able to masterbate for a long time or have sex_ and even having an erection is painful because it streches out the sores. Washing my penis in luke-warm water every couple of hours actually helps with the pain_ but at night it feels like my dick is in acid.

I have had 100's of squamous & basal cells carcinomas that are a result of growing up in S Florida as a child in the 1940's (pre sunscreen years). Add the teen years and 300 days of sun shine_ blond and fair and what a mess!,I used the creme every 4 days (1 packet on a portion of my upper chest)for 1 month.  1 month break and then repeated the application for 1 more month.  The spots that were going to become more basal cells really showed up and looked very red and sore.  No big deal.  Better to get them now than wait for more scars & surgeries in the future.  Any news on long term results?    I sincerely hope that this is the cure I have been waiting for over thirty years since my first basal cell showed up.,F,60,3  months,6/22/2006,Aldara

663, 4, Basal cell carcinoma,The first time i took it i was under the supervison of a dermatologist who had never prescribed Aldara before. She neglected to tell me to use vasalin around the area outside the BC to prevent spreading. As a result_ some Aldara got on my lip which swelled and scabbed. Now I know better and am careful when i put the cream to make sure not to touch any other areas. I have no other side affects.

Area quickly flared up again so I was told to use the ointment just twice a week for the next 5 weeks. My skin coped with this and I had no further trouble.

A couple of the warts bled.  I used vasaline after I washed off the medicine to releive the pain.  I noticed that the warts on the more delicate skin turned white_ and formed a blister-like appearance_ others became much harder.*Week 2: mild itching_ but not too bothersome.  I could sleep in the night without discomfort.  No more bleeding_ but some spots were still a little tender.*Week 3: no side effects.,I used as directed (Monday Wednesday Friday - bathed first_ applied a thin layer overnight_ washed off approx. 8 hrs later).  By week 3_ over 10 warts were unnoticable.  Three warts remain_ and I plan on contining treatment for another two months.  I started treatment early (I knew that I had been exposed_ so as soon as I saw the first bump_ I went to my dr. and started treatment ~1 month after noticing the bumps).  I am very satisfied with the treatment_ however_ I know that some people do have bad side-effects (my husband has developed large blisters over his warts; we are planning on continuing treatment for now).

It has even been listed as a laboratory chemical hazard by the US Occupational Safety Health Agency.  Yet_ doctors worldwide are prescribing it_ willy-nilly_ to cure skin cancers_ even though there are entirely safe vegetable-based creams and other safe and proven remedies.This chemical is imiquimod (IQ)_ and is the only active agent in the popular drug known as Aldara_ which is marketed worldwide and promoted very heavily by 3M Pharmaceuticals as a benign salve to cure skin cancers.I have been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder called Graves Basedow disease.

When my doctor applied it this way_ I did not burn. I'm so glad I found this site. It reassured me that my excruitating pain was from the Aldara and not herpes! Has anyone ever used or heard about Condylox Gel 0.5% to treat these warts?,F,32,1  weeks,8/25/2005,Aldara
702, 5, basal cell,3 biopsy's on my face confirmed basal cell.  I use meds 5x week for 6 weeks.  Other than the visual effects_ I am extremely tired.  Week one: no visable changes.  Week two: small blisters around the biopsy sites.  I enlarged the application area.  More blisters_ which subsequently dried up and scabbed.  Beginnig week four the scabs turned flaky and fell off (don't pick).  I'm starting week 5_ now I'm itching_ red_ swollen.  But very tolerable.  There should be no scars at the end of this.  I think its a miracle!,,F,54,6  weeks,8/23/2005,Aldara
703, 4, basil cell carcinoma,Using for 2 tumors on my face.  Had one bout of nausea_ itching_ extreme redness_ scabbing; redness and inflamation in areas near tumor but not related to it -- doctor said Aldara is causing pre-cancerous cells near my tumors to react too_ perhaps preventing future tumor formation.,The doctor told me to try to remove scabs by soaking them_ because the medicine would soak in better if there were no scab. I found myself picking at the scabs_ and developed an infection -- no fun.  Had to use antibacterial ointment for several days.  The doctor suggested putting vaseline on the inflamed areas to keep scabs from forming.,F,42,4  weeks,8/15/2005,Aldara

It cleared up my small cluster of warts_ but larger warts on my anus have yet to be affected after several weeks. a few blisters have appeared around vaginal opening. They are very sore to the touch and when urinating they burn. Seem to resemble herpes_ but after reading other peoples comments about Aldaras treatment on genital warts rethinking that the blisters are just a side effect.

I went to the doctor today and they are testing me for herpes_ I really hope its some sort of chemical burn.  Any ideas for the pain and to help the healing of the sores?

It's been 3 days with this pain and it doesn't seem to be letting up. I am quitting the application for a little while. BTY_ it is clearing up the warts because my skin is falling off.

709, 3, HPV,Gosh_ isn't this great... Okay_ so just like everyone else_ I've been in excruciating pain. Only because I managed to not follow the directions entirely. However_ I did find some stuff that helped the irritation. It's called Candula gel_ and it's usually found at like Whole Foods markets...places like that. It stings at first_ especially if it's an open cut/wound/burn_ but then relief is amazing...and it helps with the healing. I recommend the gel_ just for that added cooling effect.,As for aldara_ I'm not sure how well it's working because I took a break considering I had a burn/blister that gave me the worst pain ever. I think doctors need to emphasize how aldara should be used once you've healed from whatever recent procedure you just had done. I just had the warts burned maybe a week and a half before_ and so although healed_ that particular area of my skin was a lot thinner...thus the adara not only irritated it but burned me.  And then on top of that I had some surgically removed. So be patient_ heal up a bit_ and then apply aldara...otherwise you're uncomfortable and in pain a lot longer than you need to be. Do look into the candula stuff...it's some sort of herbal home remedy crap_ but it works -even for burns/cuts.,F,23,4  days,7/16/2005Email,Aldara

Oh_ and the warts (which were small anyway) do seem to be getting smaller.,Use as little of the cream as possible_ and try to not get it on ANY areas other than right on the warts - this can be very difficult as the cream can rub easily on to other areas_ especially when you sleep.

I was crying and everything I was about to go to the ER.I put some aloe on it after applying ice all night and it finally subsided. I was real red and very swollen down there. I have never felt so much pain in my 25 years of life. I really thought I was going to die. Eventhough it was painful I am glad that it is not herpes.

After i wash the Aldara off in the morning i put tea tree salve on there to help with the burning after the day goes by and i wash that off_ my skin feels fine with NO BURNING.,F,27,3  months,12/22/2004,Aldara
758, 4, Genital Warts,redness_ open sores_ swelling_ peeling of skin_ discharge_,I have herpes and was recently diagnosed with hpv as well. *shrugs* life goes on. Aldara was prescribed to me_ within the first week... things got pretty bad_ the side effects are potant with this medication_ but at the same time_ the medication is VERY effective. Aldara also has a reacurrence rate lower than ny other med. i had what i thought was a herpes o.b_ but thatnks to the website_ i may stand corrected. I believe one should try this med_ it will clear ur warts (the smaller onse especially)_ and will benifite you for years to come.,F,18,3  weeks,12/21/2004,Aldara

760, 4, HPV,itching_ dry skin_ redness,The cream worked very quickly. I had a small flat wart and after using the cream 3 times a week for 2 and a half weeks it has disapeared. I also had it burned too_ so i belive this helped.  The itching SUCKS but its worth it... they say aldara really stimulates memory cells to aid in fighting you from getting them back again. I hope it works! I wouldn't say the side effects are painful_ its like having a bug bite down there. I can deal_ cause i know its worth it. OH and... sex is still great!!I think the cream has aided in stimulation or something...lol (not using cream while having intercourse though),F,21,3.5  weeks,12/9/2004,Aldara

762, 3, Genital Warts,I have used this medication before and it was successful.  This is my third outbreak in as many years.  However_ my reaction this round was quite severe.  I am experiencing blistering and what looks to me like Herpes.   I have never had symptoms like this before_ so I went to get tested just to be sure.  After reading some of these testimonials_ I feel a bit better_ but if this is a common side-effect of the medication_ it needs to be made more public - even my doctor had never heard of it.,,F,25,2  weeks,11/27/2004,Aldara

765, 1, HPV,For over a year and half I have been suffering from severe itching and redness on my vulva.  The pain and anguish is pretty bad.  Sex is horrible.  No doctor ever knows what to do or even believes that there is a problem.  I would way rather have a few warts that don't hurt then this suffering. :(,The redness and itchiness has gone on for so long_ does anyone know if there is any relief to this chemical burn??  I was prescribed a steriod cream but it never cures it_ just masks the pain for a bit.  Please write to me if you have similar problems_ I want to sue these guys or at least get enough people together to make some doctors pay attention and get us some help.,F,23,3  weeks,11/12/2004Email,Aldara

769, 4, HPV - Warts,For first few weeks_ there was nothing.  Then I experienced a burning patch and redness on the vulvar area.  It went away but I made the mistake of getting a bikini wax.  Don't do it!  Ended up ripping off some skin and causing me discomfort for 4-5 days. It's been a week since I've used it and another red_ sore area has developped.  Not sure if it's after affects from the cream or herpes!  After reading other testimonials I feel slightly relieved that most of the time it's just been a skin reaction but am getting tested anyway.  Warts cleared within 4 weeks but be prepared for the side affects resembling herpes...it does your head in!  Wish me luck on the results!!,,F,28,4  days,10/15/2004,Aldara

I had about 3 bigger size approx .002cm flat warts and 4 smaller  flat warts altogether. the smaller ones like I said are all gone the 3 bigger ones are turning red.,M,30,5  times,9/20/2004,Aldara
773, 2, Genital Warts,Chemical burn_ swelling_ burning,The documentation that come with Aldara does not tell you that you are only supposed to put it on the part of the very narrow part of the skin that has warts. I mistakenly put it all over the surrounding area and got burn all over it.,M,27,2  months,9/10/2004,Aldara
774, 4, Genital Warts,Itching_ small open sores_ redness_ little swelling.,I've been using aldara for almost 2 1/2 weeks. My warts are about 99% gone. the side effects are not too bad for me. It burned a few times when i urinated. i don't recomend having sex while your on the medication wait til you stop using it_ it will make you skin worse and more irritated. as for my sores not sure if it is herpes or not. it was well-worth it for me to go through a little pain to make this stuff go away. for those of you who have irritation and itching_ use desetin cream. My gynocologist recomended it to me and it helped out a lot. You can find it in the baby isle. good luck to all of you who have this disease i wish the best for all of you!!,F,20,2  weeks,9/1/2004,Aldara
775, 3, moluscum contagiosum,MC warts are on my theigh.  One wart has disappeared since starting on drug_ I think aldara might be responsible for it since this virus has an ave lifetime of 6 months_ but i guess i got some of the medication on my testicals because I have severe redness and burning on them.  It's the worst pain I've ever experienced.  I don't know if this drug is working_ but I do know: Don't get any of it on places you don't need it_ especially more sensitive areas.  Walking makes me want to cry like a schoolgirl.,,M,26,3  weeks,9/1/2004,Aldara

780, 1, genital warts,Redness_ iritation on scrotum; one open sore also on scrotum,I noticed the side effects after about 2 weeks.  Nothing on my penis_ but scrotum became Very irritated_ including one open_ extremely painful sore.  In_ fact_ a regular Dr. diagnosed it as Herpes!  Tests later revealed that not to be true_ but it was a miserable few days.  After 3 weeks I was forced to stop the Aldara due to the pain and irritation.  My understanding is the drug affects different people differently_ I'd suggest trying it but be aware of_ and on the lookout for_ some of these very unpleasant side effects.,M,36,3  weeks,7/25/2004,Aldara

783, 3, HPV _ molluscum.,Open Sores (very shallow_ technical term is erosion_ and is supposedly a side effect for 33% of patients.),First:  If you don't have health insurance_ a free clinic that does cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen) is probably your best bet.  This stuff is WAY MORE EXPENSIVE than the results are worth_ so far anyway.  I have full drug coverage so the espense isn't an issue for me; if that's the case for you as well_ read on.I caught my HPV soon after it became detectable at all - I had probably less than 0.2 cm2 of warts when I went in.  Cryotherapy was effective (but itchy when healing) and after 3 weeks of weekly cryotherapy I was still getting new warts.  Thus_ I requested a perscription for Aldara_ hoping to head off any new ones and keep the one I had tiny.  I am still willing to go in in 4 weeks and have them burn off anything that's still around; then_ hopefully_ another 4 weeks of Aldara to ensure nothings coming back_ and we'll be done.  That's my plan_ anyway.Bad:* Itchy:  Number one comment is that it's very itchy. (and 60% of people say so.)  It's about as bad as a yeast infection_ if you've ever had one of those; or_ as bad as healing cryotherapy burns. =)  That said_ you do get the weekends to recover_ and it's only really bad in the mornings when you wake up.* lesions: I have a shallow_ bleeding lesion where there wasn't one before.  I expect I might get more.  If you get these IT MOST LIKELY IS NOT HERPES.  It doesn't hurt but (sensing a theme_ here) it does REALLY itch.* More cost: when I go into the doctor_ as someone else said_ I'll likely end up getting tested for herpes because of the lesions.  And if you are not on a full health plan_ that could suck.  On the uphand_ most likely not herpes.* Not a miracle cure: In trials it cleared 70% of women after 16 weeks... so 30% of people took $800 (in canadian drug dollars_ no less - it's way cheaper up here I bet) worth and still needed other therapies in addition.I think so far_ using Aldara as a booster after clearing anything visible with liquiod nitrogen is working pretty well.  There are very few new visible (really_,F,22,14  days,7/22/2004,Aldara
784, 2, genital warts,I was thrilled to come across another therapy for my recuring genital warts problem.  Unfortunately_ my doctor did not explain to me the potential dangers of over-using Aldara and as a result_ I experienced burns on my penis which were quite painful.  I urge newer users of this medication to error on the side of caution when first using this medication!,,M,33,5  days,7/12/2004,Aldara
785, 3, Genital Warts,Intense itching_ burning_ swelling_ redness_ cuts_ dry skin,This cream gets rid of warts_ but the pain that goes with the application of it will put you in pain. I have used it 3 times a week for 2 months and my vagina is red and raw.  The warts have gone almost 100% away_ but I can't urinate without burning. Sitting and moving hurts as my underwear rubs against the soreness. I am bleeding a little too from being dry and the clothing rubbing on my vagina. The itching is almost unbearable. It is impossible not to itch.,F,22,2  months,7/4/2004,Aldara

I was so scared and alone at the time_ especially after reading the attached information. However_ Aldara worked for me and did so a lot faster than I was told it would. After 4 times_ more than half the warts have gone. Yes there is some discomfort and side effects connected with this drug_ however they are all a small price to pay for eventual relief.,F,18,4  times,7/1/2004,Aldara
787, 1, genital warts,this was the worst thing to ever happen to me so far in my 24 years. i thought getting hpv was bad. well_ when i went back for my check up to see how i was responding to the aldara_ i told the doctor i was really sore and i didn't think i could get my next tca done. he told me it was because i had HERPES!!! i told him that couldn't be right. anyway he prescribed me meds and creams for herpes. meanwhile i got worse. my vaginal lips swelled four times larger!! i couldn't sit or walk_ and i cried in pain when i peed. i did that last application on monday was in severe pain buy thursday now it's monday and it still hurts a little_ but soooo much better. i wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. after research on the net i found out this type of reaction is extremely rare. i found out today i was negative for herpes. it was a horrible_ horrible chemical burn from the aldara. thanks for nothing aldara!!,,F,24,1  weeks,6/14/2004,Aldara
