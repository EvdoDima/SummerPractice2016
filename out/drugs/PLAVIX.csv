1, 4, stent,bruising_ fatigue,Its only been a little over 3 weeks_ but my arms are so bruised they would scare children and old people! I am experiencing some fatigue especially in the a.m. However_ thankfully I feel pretty good otherwise and I attribute that to the fact I am continuing to exercise one hr. per day 5 days a week with weights_ stretches and walking/jogging which I have been doing for the past 41 years.  Also_ with my wife's cooperation I am on DASH diet. The blender drinks she makes help a lot!  I called my cardiologist and complained about the bruising and fatigue and she practically pleaded with me not to stop the Plavix_ saying it would be only for one year. I intend to go off it by stages at that point and let the DASH diet do the rest. Mostly though I'm thanking God for an already long life.,M,83,29  days75 1X D,6/9/2016,Plavix

Family Doctor and Cardiologist said it is not due to Plavix but I never had any pains before stent.  Also_ platelets and white bloods cells markedly different from before.Please comment or email.  I'm afraid that Plavix is killing me and no one wants to listen.,Stent should never have been placed.  I thought that I only agreed to heart cath to determine why my BP was elevating for no reason.  I was knocked out and stent was placed.  I found out after review of angiogram by non-interventional cardiologist that I had no more than 40% stable plaque.

16, 2, Post TIA attacks,I had 4 TIAs on the same day and was put on Plavix. I was already taking 81 mg aspirin before I had them and the hospital doctor told me to keep taking the aspirin with the Plavix. On my first visit to the neurologist_ I was told to stop aspirin because taking with Plavix could cause bleeding in my brain. It seemed I did OK over several months' time except that I also took Clonidine around lunchtime and about 50 minutes later_ I am useless. Now I am noticing I'm getting very tired BEFORE I take the Clonidine. My legs and arms feel like weights are tied to them and I cannot think clearly enough to take care of paperwork. Sometimes I get a strange feeling running all over my body after taking Plavix. When it's time for Clonidine_ it's a double whammy until late at night. I am also getting bruises and my skin looks like crepe paper. My teeth have discolored over this past year and I can't help but feel it is due to one of these medicines.,My TIAs weren't due to blood clots_ but caused my BP shooting up. The neurologist said I would never have the TIAs again if my BP was kept under control_ which it is now. Don't really understand why I was put on Plavix_ but asked my doctor about going back to aspirin three days ago. She said when I decide to go off of it_ to take two 81 mg aspirins for a few days_ then go back to one. I am fed up with the life being zapped out of me day after day_ so I plan to start back on the aspirin soon.,F,66,1  years75 mg 1X D,11/19/2015Email,Plavix

23, 3, TIA 4 years ago,Cured all symptoms of the TIA_ I was told by my doctor that I would probably be on Plavix for the rest of my life. After 2 years I started having abdominal/bladder area pains only at night. I had ultra sounds_ MRI's but nothing showed up. THEN_ I was scheduled for some minor surgery and was told to get off Plavix for 6 weeks. After 1 week of being off Plavix_ the pains went away ! After the 6 week period_ I went back on Plavix and the pains started after 1 week. My doctors and surgeon did not know of any side affects like this_ but I am taking myself off this drug and I will start an aspiring regimen,If you have any pain on the right side of your bladder while lying down_ these are the same symptoms I have and I would like to hear about it !!,M,61,4  years75mg 1X D,8/28/2015Email,Plavix

26, 1, TIA/Stroke,"PLEASE READ.  This website saved my sanity and quality of life...I will explain.I had a TIA and immediately was placed on plavix.  All evidence of my TIA was gone within 48 hours and I felt back to normal.  I was told that Plavix is easily tolerated with little to no side effects.  After my TIA I spent the next three weeks feeling back to myself but for anxiety after what I had been through.  Then...BAMMMMM!  CRUSHING_ TERRIBLE LIFE ALTERING FATIGUE.  I could barely leave the house.  When I did I worried I could not safely drive home.  This was not ""tired""...this was something completely different!  I had never felt like this.  I contacted my Neurologist and was told fatigue is common in people who have suffered a TIA or stroke. She reassured me it is normal_ and not due to any medications.  I took her at her word.Then I started to experience tingling in my extremities and my face.  Over the next month the quality of my life deteriorated.

27, 1, stent _ drug eluting,Loading dose of 300 mg gave me such headache I felt like vomiting. You want to kill yourself at the thought this could be irreversible. Actually_ it is irreversible in the sense that the drug never comes off its target. Off-target information is lacking. On target information is worrying as the receptor is a bit everywhere in your body_ including the endothelial epithelium. Are my arteries going to heal better if I get rid of possibly essential dominos? Didn't think so...Anyway_ I was given two tablets of panadol and the pain disappeared within the hour. Nobody at the hospital would mention that what I went through was probably a side effect. Surprisingly_ I got very little attention at that stage_ as if a code of silence prevents talking about these issues. Is that the price to pay to keep the medico-pharma complex running? Small price for the complex; rather large price for many of the patients who take this type of poison.Good thing about the drug is that you are not hungry_ so I am loosing weight_ which I can afford right now.Having gone through some of the literature_ it is not clear why not to stick to aspirin. There is 100 mg of it in my tablet_ so let' go to 200 mg per day_ and reach a better outcome than current dual platelet therapy. Eat garlic_ cut added sugars totally_ eat less_ exercise much more_ and move on with your life.The day after receiving the first shot_ I had some memory issues.My urine smells weird.

At the same time Plavix is usually prescribed_ and the blame is passed on to Plavix.  I went off Plavix at my insistence a year after triple bypass surgery_ I thought I had the problem knocked.

Since then I have been careful with what I eat. My weight since highschool has not changed much hovering around 62-64 kg.

118, 1, stent,Chest Pain.  Tired.  Bleeding in the eye.  Depression,I have had chest pain off and on (currently on) and no one seems to think much about it.  I wake up with a dull pressure in the middle of my chest.  It feels as if I need to stretch it out_ but that does not help.  Nitro Glycerin does not help either.   Yesterday I developed a broken blood vessel in my right eye.  I am waiting to see a specialist tomorrow at noon.  I have slight pressure and a little pain.  one half of my eye is blood red and slightly bulging with bleeding and no place for it to go.  It is freaking me out.  The Plavix warning list says to get immediate help if you have bleeding in the eye or chest pain.  I have had chest pain for two weeks this time around and no one seems to be in a hurry to see me.  the eye situation started yesterday morning and I had to drive myself to  the cardiologist office and insist someone look at it immediately.  They wanted me to wait until Thursday at 3 for a regular appointment.  If a warning on a medication says see someone immediately_ I assumed that meant NOW.  This is not how I was treated.  I hope to God it is nothing_ but I feel 100 years old on this drug.  I am also very depressed since my stent in January and now all these pains and problems.  I hate this drug.  I don't want to die_ but I am not sure I want to live like this either.  I was never  a depressive person until this drug.,F,57,8  months75mg 1X D,8/16/2011Email,Plavix

After which a cardiologist had placed her on Plavix.  She had lived by herself and was very independent.  Although she cannot drive_ she could function independently and had no problems with taking care of herself.  We had her stayed in a nursing home for cardiac rehab and later moved her to an assisted living facility after that.  We had noticed that she started to develop a cough while in the nursing home.  She was placed on antibiotic by her primary physician but it did not seem to subside.  What was more concerning was her level of sedation and confusion.  She was screaming help every night to the point of disturbing other residents from getting any rest.  Her appetite does not seem to be there as well.  There was concern that we would have to put her back into a nursing home which was truly not in her best  interest given that was coherent about two months ago.  We had thought hard about the possibility of Plavix as being the culprit and the risk of removing a medication that may prevent future heart attack.  We had decided to have her taken off of Plavix on grounds of mental confusion and ultimately lack of quality of life.

The PFO procedure went well - easier than i thought_ but had a little trouble after surgery (catheter/femoral procedure) due to bleeding that took a few (7) hours to stop.  I don't think I lost more than 1/2 pint_ so no big deal really compared to a stroke.,I've only been on it a month and I don't have any complaints yet.  Something interesting since my TIA and it might be related to Plavix - I am not color blind anymore and seems like someone turned up the color saturation on my eyes - I never new such vivid colors in everday life_ especially blues and reds.  I'm sure the Plavix helps me get to sleep much easier_ but not drowsy during the day_ or night if I wake up. I have many dreams whenever I sleep and I love that part.

The third month I began waking in the morning to find my right hand and wrist swollen substantially and extremely painful. My hand and finger joints are still quite painful to use. Serious shortness of breath after ascending one flight of stairs_ flu like symptoms_ very cold fingers and toes_ total lack of energy_ serious loss of physical strength_ loss of libido_ rectal bleeding_ split fingers that just would not heal_ mental confusion. Prior to taking this medication I could run up and down three or four flights of stairs several times with no shortness of breath. I thought I was coming down with the flu for two months but never got it. I've lost my sense of taste and appetite. Nausea and gastrointestinal upset constantly.

The whole time I was on it I was sure it was just a matter of time before I had a life ending brain bleed--everything else was bleeding.

I ended up in emerg with the worst 20 hr nose bleed of my life. no one paid any attention to my fears and complaint. I only took plavix for 30 days. I then started lipitor 10mg / day 4 days later I was admitted with respitory failure-the inability to produce or synthecize oxygen no solution was offered other than watchful waiting-big help that was...

164, 1, Leg vein bypass surgery,My mom had a leg vein bypass surgery in march 2010 and she was prescribed Plavix_ but then almost immediately she started noticing these side effects - Light-headedness_ ringing in the ears and making tinnitus worse_ shaky_ sweats and numb all over. I didn't realize how bad the side effects could be and the potential for heart problems until recently and especially finding this site and seeing how many of you have had the same issues. My mom had a few heart problems while she was in the hospital_ so it's pretty upsetting to see how dangerous this drug can actually be. I'm really thankful to this site and all of you that have submitted your stories. Thanks to reading all of this_ we talked her doctor into taking her off the Plavix and now she's taking 325MG Bayer_ coated tablets. I'm curious about something though. She's still experiencing some of the side effects and she's been off Plavix for 4 days. Have any of you still had side effects after stopping?,I highly recommend to get 2nd and 3rd opinions on if you really NEED the Plavix_ or if you can take something safer such as simply good old fashioned aspirin.

Have difficulty in holding on to a good firm erection as the blood flow is improved somehow. It is affecting sex life.,My cardiologist prescribed after stent inplant to take 75mg Plavix and 100 mg aspirin. I had 5 stent inplant 3 1/2 years ago and I actually requested and doctor agreed for me to stop Plavix after 6 months. There is always risk of excessive bleeding in accident or medical emergency. I had the 6th stent inplant 4 months ago (after 5 stents 3 years ago)and on the same dosage of Plavix and Aspirin again and going to stop after 6 months but continue with the 100mg aspirin.

167, 2, Rule out TIA,I am not sure if any of my symptoms are due to Plavix. Singificant hair loss is my primary symptom(may be from an antifungal med?). When I called my neurologist yesterday she took me off Plavix and switched me to a full dose Aspirin.  She feels that I did not have a TIA. I am being treated conservatively due to a terrible (cardiovascular) family history.  The Neurologist was planning to switch me to Asprin soon anyway. ,I also feel very anxious (like I am really over reacting internally to everything) and have a terrible pain in my neck that is not related to an injury that has caused me to wear a neck brace and have massage therapy so that I can continue functioning. The pain in my neck gets worse the more anxious I become.  I am a busy highly functional professional used to multitasking but it is no longer working. I will let you know if these symptoms get better off the Plavix. Yes_ hair loss can be due to stress- but what comes first the chicken or the egg?,F,52,5  months75MG 1X D,10/12/2010,Plavix
168, 1, stents to heart,"I was prescribed this drug in Nov. 2009 after a TIA.  Had bad side effects with a ""hurt"" behind the left eye_ high anxiety_ some shortness of breath_ and an almost headache constantly on the front left side of the head.  Took myself off and started taking full aspirin up to 2-3 times a day...later agreed to by my Neurologist based upon some later studies...all improved but also found out had a arterial clogging going on to the heart so had bypass surgery 3 months and but lost a couple of grafts and just had two stents also placed five days ago.  The cardiologist ordered Plavix.  Like a dope I started taking it the next day and have had the same worsening symptoms so will no longer take another dose of this drug.  I think it is criminal that the medical pill pushing establishments doesn't followup in any meaningful way that I have ever been able to tell about side effects.",While I am sure that Plavix can be successfully taken by many just can other drugs be taken by some patients and not others.  But I firmly believe that this can be a very dangerous drug as well and should be monitored by prescribing doctors from the first day that it is prescribed until it is clear the patient is one that will be successful with this medication.  But then that would require a doctor actually following up with a patient like they use to do when I was a kid.  I am sure anyone else my age might actually remember that.  Today the almighty dollar rules medicine...it's all about the numbers.  It is my (your)life_ better educate yourself best you can (at least these days we at least have a chance for some information).

173, 1, medicated stent,3 weeks after starting Plavix I experienced a painful UTI that eventually cleared on its own. 3 weeks after that the finger joints of my right hand became swollen_ extremely painful and totally inoperable. That also cleared on its own after 2 weeks. 3 weeks after that I woke up with a horrid boil on the lower right edge of my palm. That cleared in a week. A week later I woke up with my throat swollen shut and I could not swallow. That throat condition cleared on its own in 4 days. On the 5th day my temperature started to climb into the 102-103 degree range and the killer headaches set in. In a couple of days I was battling temperature swings up into 104-105+ degree range. I was hurting big time. My right knee started to swell up and the knee joint became hyper sensitive to any load and just locked up. I was a cripple. The knee eventually had to be drained. By this time I had been to my GP several times. My GP tested the heck out of me over several visits_ prescribed several HD antibiot,"If you happen to be among the 7% or so of the populace that is somehow sensitive to Plavix you are pretty well screwed. If you are in the 7%_ figure out a way to get off of the Plavix before it kills you. All of the Plavix allergic symptoms tend to drive all of your normally pretty good medical diagnosticians nuts. Virtually all of the Plavix allergic symptoms tend to look like other diseases_ but the big clue is that there are typically no normal testable organic disease causes in evidence. All of my standard analytical disease tests keep coming back negative. In the end what you have to do is to convince your medical diagnostician to take a leap of faith with you and assume that the compendium of all of your weird medical symptoms have been caused by a Plavix allergic reaction. It is only then that you can get ""fixed"".

174, 1, TIA,Began experiencing sharp pain in right forearm several days after starting Plavix after a TIA in 1/05 - pain then spread down to my wrist and hand/fingers and was so painful that I could not turn a doorknob_ pick up a bowl by its' edge_ etc. - I asked my internist about this at the one-week follow-up after my TIA and he said it had nothing to do with the Plavix (although he had no explanation for this pain) and to continue taking it!  After another week_ the pain had also moved all the way up to my shoulder so I called my internist who sent me to an orthopedist - after a brief exam_ the orthopedist_ even though acknowledging that the symptoms were NOT typical of carpal tunnel_ gave me a steroid injection in my wrist!  Fortunately_ I went to see my psychiatrist the following week and he could see that I was not well - when I told him about what was going on_ he consulted his PDR which indicated that one of the rarer side-effects was nerve pain in the extremities.  So_ I stopped the Plav,I was so disappointed with my internist's dismissive response and tunnel vision - he never even asked about my arm when I saw him a month later.  Residual effects lasted for about 8 months (puffy palms_ side of my hand as well as the pinky and ring fingers were numb_ and the bony area above the wrist was painful).  Needless to say_ I changed internists and the first thing I told my new internist was to note on my chart that I am allergic to Plavix!  And the orthopedist had the nerve to send me a postcard to return for a follow-up - sorry but I already paid for an exam and useless injection and won't ever go back to a doctor who admits they are giving you treatment not indicated by the symptoms.,F,61,3  weeks 1X D,8/17/2010,Plavix

Whe I stopped taking plavix the symptoms gradually worsened for maybe a day and then started weakening----,Cont: All though my knee started improving all most immediatly and at this point is 95% good. I was literally to the point where walking was very difficult.  The dissapation of pain also started at the severe chest pressure. I could feel relief in 5 minute to 30 minute increments over days.  Sleep was poor. BUT--the pain migrated.  It moved from my shoulder blades into my left shoulder joint alone and then into my spine between the shoulders.  Then the scary part.  It moved into my head with the accompying dull but persistant headache and I got a low grade fever--highest temp was 100.7 and I reached it twice.  The headache took 24 hours to go away.  I believe Ibuprofen actually helped in spots along the way_ especially the head--but don't count on it. It's Monday morn and I'm about 95%--compared to four days ago when I literally thought I was dying--am printing this and taking it to the Dr this afternoon.,M,50,7  weeks75 1X D,3/8/2010,Plavix

Was given plavix as a post stent treatment 3 years ago.  After being on it for 18 months it felt like someone hit me in the lower back with a bat.  Stopped Plavix after trial and error.  Had another stent inserted 7 weeks ago and currently_ I sit here in terrible pain reading others descriptions and thankfully now know what is going on. Tonight is my first missed pill. I know what it feel like to have a heart attack--and guess what--It's really close to the symptoms and pain I am experiencing right now.  I'm probably gonna have to call in sick at work tomorrow.  I thought the problem was the Benazepril because I've never taken it before and found it to have the same symptoms (thank you internet) NOTHING helps the feeling of indegestion or the shoulder pain.

I asked my Doc about getting off Plavix (the only drug I take)and he said I shouldn't but couldn't give me a reason to keep taking it(other than he's encouraged by the drug companies to do so). Had taken 81mg aspirin for 30yrs before TIA and would like to go back on it. Now that I've read others comments about Plavix I plan to make an appointment with my Doc to discuss getting off of it. I have also discovered that garlic and saw palmetto work similar to Plavix and when taken with 81mg aspirin_ may have the same results with fewer harmful side effects.",In my opinion_ some people may need to stay on Plavix after certain health issues or procedures. However_ I question_ given the side effects_ doctors continually prescribing it for patients with low cholestrol and normal blood pressure_ who have had minor TIA's with no ill effects.

Then the burning in my torso started.  The burning got really bad in my chest.  This was accompanied by tingling of the skin thoughout my body.  The suffering  from the burning became so severe that I could barely work.  I was becoming debilitated.  I was about ready to go on disability when I finally figured out that it was the plavix.  I spent over $30_000 going from specialist to specialist trying to find an answer to why my health was degrading.  They would all take my list of meds_ put it aside and then go about their specialty.  I finally asked an allergist if I could be allergic to the plavix.  He said it was possible.  So I stopped taking it.  It took almost two years to recover my health.  Fortunately the reason for which I was taking it was fixed and I don't need it any more.

(including asprin)I was not happy about taking plavix or any meds. So when I came home I started doing research on alternative meds to cover what the drugs were for.....and found them. But then my kids started hammering me about the plavix and saying to at least stay on it for awhile_ so went back on it for 2 days and the headaches returned along with the joint pain so went off it again and it all went away. Haven't taken it (or any drugs)since and feel just fine. My thought on this is: if you can find an alternative herb for the drugs you are told you have to take_ DO IT. Once you take a drug for any length of time it is like a snowball rolling down hill......you gather more drugs for symptoms the first ones are causing. Your body is made to heal itself if you give it the right stuff. That's why God put herbs on this earth.

Once home I started on Plavix again and all the symptoms reappeared. For 4 weeks I lost weight_ threw up_ could not stand the smell of food and had extremely vivid nightmares. I was exhausted. I suspected Plavix caused all these side effects. Off Plavix now for 3 days and I have no signs of these side effects. I am still weak but eat well and have no stomach discomfort. The cough is gone. Now I am on 1 adult aspirin daily. My cardiologist is not happy_ but I am happy. He said he has never had any patients with all these side effects.

I stopped taking it after 8 months and had some more severe blood clots so the doc put me back on it. The bruising came back of course_ but bruises and bleeding is a small price to pay if it keeps the blood clots away. Since going back on Plavix I have not had any further strokes or blood clots.

358, 1, To stop clots post-strokes,Lowered hemoglobin (eventually down to 5) and subsequent fatal heart attack.,I am writing on behalf of my deceased father who was on Plavix and a baby aspirin daily in the hopes of preventing more mini-strokes.  He had developed some internal bleeding possibly from or made worse by the Plavix.  I do not know that the drug alone is what caused this_ and I do believe that he could have been saved if the doctor at the rehab/nursing home had been paying attention to his hemoglobin levels.  Still_ as a drug to stop clot formation it certainly encouraged bleeding which led to lowered red cell count- meaning my father became extremely anemic_ meaning not enough oxygen was getting to his organs... which led him to have a heart attack and die 11 days later.  If you or a loved one go on this drug_ be sure to keep a check on your red blood cells aka hemoglobin and check for internal bleeding!!!,M,82,3  months,6/29/2007,Plavix

372, 4, Have 2 medicated stents .,Bruise easily_ some seem spontaneous.  Bleeding from minor cuts takes longer to stop.  I have taken Plavix for 14 months since two med. stents put in left artery for 90% blockage.  Side effects are annoying but cardio. tells me to continue_ perhaps indefinitely_ because med. stent could attract a clot and lead to coronory thrombosis....something you want to avoid!,Med. stents have become controversial since I had them implanted in Jan. 2006.  Long term studies are not yet available to determine if Plavix must be taken indefinitely to prevent clots.  Meanwhile_ better safe than sorry.  I notice many of the  side effects described here by others(arrythmia_ dizzyness_ difficulty concentrating_ fatigue_ sleep problems) may be due to post op anxiety.  I suffered from these also.  I was not able to tolerate statins......tried them all.  The combination of the cardio telling me I should take them combined with my intolerance of them caused a great deal of anxiety_ together of course_ with post op. concerns that I had a life-threatening event.  Anxiety can cause all these effects.  Regular exercise_ yoga_ meditation and an occasional xanax helped me get thru the anxiety.  I am also trying statin alternatives such as fish oil_ Cholest-off_ dietary fiber and drastic reduction in saturated fat intake to lower chol. and LDL.

I came off for 10 days (successfully) for colonoscopy and a gall bladder surgery but skipped the surgery.   Medicine needs to come up with a method to check the stents to see if they have been overgrown and it is safe to come off the Plavix.   Feel like I am playing Russian roulette with an automatic.

Perhaps have some rectal bleeding though not sure. I have pains in my knees never had like that before. Started 1 week after my stent placed. Got off of Lipitor after reading research and reading ""Cholesterol Myths"" by Ravnskov.","Read ""bypassing bypass"" by Cranton_ the chelation maven and found the real highly documented research about chelation as effective if done right and will clear arteries. Most physicians simply don't read this stuff and instead read falsified research done by drug manufacturers. Also  Rath's work ""Why Animals dont get heart attacks and people do"" re Vitamin C very important plus others. Now taking 100mg of co Q 10 2 times a day. also got eval of thyroid using blood and saliva tests to take proper Thyroid NOT SYNTHROID!!! take naturethorid. I am looking into substituting various vitamin Es for plavix. It's tough as I remain worried until I get the complete course of Chelation which takes a lot of time and is not available under insurance and costs about $4_000 for the complete series each session is 3 hours long.

It can be very large in size. Unfortunatly this is the case for my grandmother.  I thought it important to list this information as this was the first time anyone mentioned this in the 1 year she has been on it. This does not sound like the miracle drug it was promised to be.

I find that I'm a bit tired but this could be due to the workload I have to deal with.  I don't have the tyoical highs or a sex drive like I used to and am wondering if it's the Plavix that's responsible.  Perhaps it's due to the diet I've put myself under_ which has resulted in my losing 8 lbs. in 6 weeks....perhaps it's the sugar withdrawal?  I've been taking baby aspirin_ Lipitor and atenolol_ the latter of which I have no idea why I'm taking it since I have good blood pressure and have not experienced a heart attack.  My sex drive was slightly affected (as I was told) by the atenolol_ but now I find it even less enjoyable_ probably due to the Plavix.  Has anyone else experienced that?

466, 1, Coronary Artery Disease,This is to comment on the statement by denise about Plavix working while taking it and anything can happen when you stop.  Plavix works by altering the platelets.  Palatets have a life span of about 10 days_ which means about 10 days after stopping Plavix_ there will be no more platelets in the blood stream that have been altered by Plavix.  Our neighbor agrees anything can happen after stopping Plavix.  She took it for the prescribed year after receiving a stent_ and a few weeks after stopping Plavix she had the first of several mini strokes.  She says it was the result of taking Plavix and then stopping.,,,,1  years,2/4/2005,Plavix
467, 2, heart attack with stint implant,Difficulty stopping bleeding even from minor cuts. Sever bruising.,After 2.5 years on it_ developed rectal bleeding that required hospitalization and platelet transfussions to stop the bleeding. Now I'm off all blood thinners.

If it starts backup_ I'll stop plavix completely.  May as well die of a stroke or heart attack as I had to bleed to death.,M,74,4  months,1/27/2005,Plavix
469, 5, Heart Attack  ... one stent ...,take it w/ an aspirin every morning ... not sure how you recognize minor body symtoms from getting older & life itself ...I believe I have experienced zero side effects ...

I had a stent implanted 2 years ago and was put on Plavix for 30 days and had no problem from the stent or Plavix. With this stent they said take it for 6 MONTH.

Stopped Plavix and immediately disappeared.  Considering going back on but talking to my doctor.,Concerned about its long term effects and riding a racing bicycle and otherwise being active and injuring myself which results in bleeding.  May be a great drug but does have unwanted side effects and hard to get info as to consequences of side effects over the long term.,M,63,1  years,11/16/2004,Plavix
479, 4, Angioplasty/2 coated stents,Shortness of breath but I don't know whether that is from Plavix.   I never had the shortness of breath before the procedure and am now using an Atrovent inhaler by prescription.   This seems to have helped.,I don't feel that Plavix is as detrimental to me as most of the others who have posted.    But time will tell.,F,78,5  weeks,11/9/2004,Plavix

482, 1, 2 coated stents on 8/13/2004,I hate this drug. I have been on it for 6 weeks now and even though I have complained to my doctor about the abdominal pains_ the nausea_ the reflux and CHEST PAINS_ he said these are not related.  I am told I need to be on this for 3 years!!!!Helllooooooooooo.  I will not make it to 6 months with these side effects that,There just has to be an easier way to keep these coated stents open than PLAVIX!~!I am considering cutting them in half and taking only 1/2 one every other day.  I am not encouraging others to follow same...I am just doing this on my own.  If you are having severe side effects talk to your doctor and make him listen to you.,F,59,43  days,9/26/2004,Plavix

484, 3, open heart to remove tumor in heart,dizziness,I had open heart surgery on 7/30/04 to remove a tumor inside my heart. Started Plavix day after surgery until cardiologist discharged me from it on 8/19/04. I am not sure if the dizziness is still from the trauma of surgery or the Plavix. I also broke out in hives and lip was swollen for one whole day (Last Thursday)_ although this could have been from me taking Motrin 2 to 3 x a day for approx.4 days (but that seems a bit odd for me to have such a drastic reaction to Motrin).  I called my pharmacist and he said that because I was on Plavix for 3 weeks it will not be out of my system for 5 days after the discharge date. I think dizziness (headaches too) is from Plavix. Not to sure if this is such a great medication or not_ it may be just me.,F,36,3  weeks,8/22/2004Email,Plavix
