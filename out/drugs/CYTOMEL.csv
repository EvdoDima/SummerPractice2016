1, 5, Hypothyroid/Major Depressive Disord,Increase in energy_ no longer feel like all I want to do is sleep_ daily crying has greatly reduced,Have been on levothyroxine for about 8 years and just never felt any benefit to being on it_  had crazy weight gain of synthroid (18lbs in 3 months).  After a ton of research and lots of debate with in primary care doc_ I went off of synthyroid_ she wouldn't even consider cytomel. My shrink prescribed the cytomel for depression and so far I am very optimistic.  I will never go back to synthroid or any other T4 drug.  If cytomel continues to lift my depression and hopefully my panic attacks_ my goal is to get off of lexapro/buspar.,F,45,4  weeks25 mcg 1X D,7/6/2016Email,Cytomel

3, 4, Hashimoto's thyroiditis,"I've only been on it two days_ but already feel a difference: more awake_ more energy! I have been hypothyroid for DECADES_ and given Synthoid (a.k.a. ""Syncrap"") for decades_ by TSH-obsessed_ ignorant doctors. I never felt much better on Synthroid and physicians always told me ""your TSH is fine""_ and insinuated that my complaints were 'all in my head'. What jerks! Endocrinologists were particularly useless and especially uncaring. Last winter I discovered Stop The Thyroid Madness book and website & learned about NDT (natural dessicated thyroid). I found a naturopathic doctor who was knowledgable about NDT_ and got on it asap. What a HUGE difference! People_ if your doctor focuses on 'what your TSH level is""_ RUN! Find a good healer who prescribes NDT! Recently my dr said I needed to add T3 to my NDT_ and I started. Cytomel 2 days ago. I feel my brainfog lifting & am thinking more clearly already! Good stuff!",I have no side effects_ so far. I may need to up my dosage level over time. This stuff is great (for me)!

4, 4, hypothyroidism/ weight gain,stomach cramps approx. 5-6 hours after taking.  It goes away after an hour or so. May or may not be related_ but only occurred since I've been taking it. Sometimes I feel hyped up mentally.,For three weeks I've been on 25mcg once a day 30 mins. before lunch_ or 2 hours after lunch. Seemed to work right away for me as far as energy and feeling good. I don't take afternoon naps anymore and instead of falling asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow_ I'm awake longer. It hasn't helped with my weight gain this far_which was what I was hoping for.  I've gained 40lbs since December 2014 and no matter what I did I couldn't lose it.  I workout and never stopped_ because my thyroid was out of whack I slowed down.  I went longer to compensate_ but I kept gaining.  I'm hoping this kicks in so I can start losing. My endocrinologist said this should jump start my thyroid /metabolism.

8, 5, Hashimoto & Thyrodectomy,So far I have had no negative side affects.,"I am a male 74 years old and an avid writer.  I had been on thyroid replacement therapy since age 17.  I was feeling foggy_ sleeping 10 hours every night_ lethargic_ my mind was gone on vacation and I was unable to write.  I argued with my Dr. about not reducing my T4. but he reduced it anyway.  He said I needed to go the ""Quack"" in Spanish Fork.  As I left his office_ I ask him_ ""What is the address of that Quack?""  I went to the Quack who turned out to be my Savior. She started me with 5mcg twice a day then she prescribed 10mcg twice a day.  My T4 was reduced to by the first Dr from 150mcg to 125mcg.  The Quack reduced my T4 from 125mcg to 100mcg_ but also increased my cytomel_ now at 10mcg twice per day.Overall I have lost about 20 pounds all belly fat_ but that was just a plus.  What is important is_ I got my life back.  I am now sleeping 8 hours a night_ instead of 10.  I wake up invigorated_ rested_ and refreshed.  My mind decided to function again and now I am back writing.  I got my life back!  I am so thankful that I went to see that Quack!  I had no idea that T3 even existed.  My family Dr was wrong_ he was ""old"" school and refused to treat me for T3.  My life would have been over had I not gone to the Quack in Spanish Fork_ UT.  She treated me with cytomel and now the foggyness in my mind is gone.  Without my ability to write_ my life was meaningless.  I am here_ 100%.  It is good to be back.

9, 1, Hashimoto's Hypothryoid,headaches_ migraine with aura_ tinnitus_head buzzing_ blurring of vision_light sensitivity_ eye lid swelling_  dizzy spells_ tired_ weakness_ night sweats_ high blood pressure spikes with high pulse_ heart palpitations_ nausea_ dehydration_ diahrrea_ caffeine and exersize intolerance_ memory loss_ some hair loss_ eventually swelling of full face and shortness of breath.,"My doctor added this to my Synthroid 125mcg. that I have been taking for many years.  At first she started me on 5mcg.  I thought I was doing okay_ not realizing at the time the the mild headaches and slight blurry vision was due to this drug until she upped it to 10mcg. After I started on the higher dose_ the other more severe symptoms started and I ended up having a ""Thyroid Storm"" that was a severe life threatening condition and t-3 pooling.  It took weeks to get out of my system_ not 24 hours as the Doctor said.  It was very difficult and scary.  Be very careful with this drug.  It goes directly in to your blood bypassing your liver.  Don't take it at the same time as t4 and definitey don't take it at the same time as estrogen or estradiol.  T4_ T3 and estrogen will dialate the blood vessels which can cause a stroke or heart attack! The pharmacy gave me the generic Liothyronine and I don't know if this had anything to do with the bad reaction that I had or that I'm allergic to it.  But I will never take this drug again!

Once I separated those two meds everything was great.,I took 25mcg for 5 years. Over time I guess my thyroid function decreased and I realized I prob needed a dosage increase.

11, 4, Metabolism_ weight gain,The first time I was on it for the two years_ I lost 65# in 2 months doing ABSOLUTELY nothing different.  She started me on 2 wks 25s_ then 2 weeks 50s_ then the 75s.  My temperature went from a regular_ always  96 to 98.6_ my eyebrows grew back_ I wasn;t going from cold to hot to cold to hot anymore.  Then I went in the hospital for something else and they took me off every medication I was taking and put me only on the ones they felt I needed for the kidney problem I was in for..  When I came out my primary care put me back on_ full strength - 75 mg.  Within 3 days FULLY HALF my hair fell out.  HALF.  It was awful.  It was coming out in chunks and handfulls at a timre.   Finally_ after thinking about it_ I realized it had to be the full dose of cytomel right away.  I myself stopped it and waited a couple of weeks and then did it the way my other dr did.  2 weeks on 25s_ etc.  This time_ however no weight loss.  Everything else cleared up like the first time_ but not a pound of weight,Can be a really good medication.  I particularly liked that 65# gone in a flash.  But was SO disappointed the second time around.  I am also (for 25 years) been taking generic synthdoid.,F,61,2  years75mg 1X D,6/8/2015Email,Cytomel

18, 1, low thyroid,It seems either this drug is heaven to some hell to others. In the 3 months I was on it had extreme rash & itching. Little bumps on both breast & legs. Extreme swelling of legs_ ankles & feet. Hair in front fell off! Gained 20 lbs in 3 months. Brain fog.,Thank God for this forum. After reading some of the bad comments here I realized all my symptoms were due to Cytomel. From the day after I took myself off I got relief. It's been 2 weeks & I'm 95% clear of all symptoms. Some dried up bumps here & there & mild itching every now & then. Lesson learned..listen to your body. Cytomel may work for everyone else but you may be the one it doesn't work for.

25, 5, Augment Antidepressant,Maybe some slight anxiety at first_ slight sweating. Not many adverse side effects noticed.,So far_ Cytomel has worked tremendously for my treatment resistant depression.  I was prescribed a small dose of Cytomel to help augment the antidepressant I had been taking but seemed to no longer work.  I tried the generic form of Cytomel and had anxiety_ more tearfulness_ I just felt awful.  The doctor then switched to brand name and those symptoms totally went away.  Within about three weeks time I noticed a tremendous difference in my depression.  I was far less anxious and that terrible feeling of dread/impending doom was gone.  I because more interested in things again and within two months of taking it I am back to myself again.  I was having some symptoms of hypothyroidism but my tests always came back within normal range.  I was losing hair_ gaining weight_ the outer third of my eyebrows were gone.

Also gone off synthroid for last two days to see if more energy comes back.,On 75 mcg synthroid for 4 1/2 years high TSH. 15. Doc guilted me into continuing the synthroid. Synthroid completely exhausted me. Took all of my energy away and couldn't hardly get out of bed I was so tired. Doc said due to depression not synthroid. Took Prozac and did nothing. Had to get off synthroid to get any energy back. Got back on synthroid when symptoms came back each time. Discovered first doc only testing for TSH. Not t3 or t4.looked at two endos that couldn't help. Strange_ I think they might have been diabetes endos not thyroid endos.   When new doc tested t3 and t4 both at the very lowest level in each range.  OnInternet looked up books written by Mary showman about thyroid.  This is where I found cytomel. Have new doctor the last 6 months. Who also put me on provil upon my request and saved my life. Now has me on cytomel. And finally getting my energy and health back.

I didn't do well on Synthroid alone. Cytomel suppresses TSH_ but my endo says that TSH can be meaningless after treatment has begun and he doses based on free t4 and free t3 levels and how I'm feeling. I feel fantastic!

40, 3, Hypo/hyper thyroidism,Feel back to normal after morning dose of 5mg_ more energy_ clarity.,I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 28 yes old after my second child was born.  Was put on 100 mg of levithroid for 15 years with very minimal dosage adjustments.  I did great on it.  In 2009_ all hell broke loose with my hormones.  Went into perimenopause and my thyroid was out of whack.  For 3 years I have been suffering with dizziness_ fatigue_ weight gain_ heart palps_ irregular periods and horrible pms.  Saw a homeapathic hormone specialist the last year and she has been tweaking my thyroid as it keeps fluctuating from high t4to low t3 and reverse t3.  She put me on a high dose of t3 compound_ for 10 months I was fine on it but the last month has been complete HELL with major fatigue dizziness and heart palps and anxiety attacks.  Was finally referred to an endocronolgist from my regular insurance just this week.  She put me on 3 days (taper down) of cytomel twice a day 50 mg to 10 mg.  Starting 150 levithroid tomorrow once daily.  The cytomel feels like a burst of energy to me for about 5 hours_ then I plummet into extreme fatigue again be foe my second dose.

41, 1, ,At first_ my levels were a little on the low side_ so my doctor put me on 5 mcg cytomel. After only 1 week she checked my blood again and said that there was no change. I thought this was weird because usually you wait 3 weeks after starting a new medication. She bumped me up to 25mcg. I was on the small side (120_ 5'6'') and I thought that was quite a jump. Well after 3 weeks on 25mcg_ I have INTENSE chest pains_ and diffeculty breathing. And now I am only 112 lbs. My endo told me to stop it right away. I am now on the hyper end for my thyroid_ and my endo wants to put me on synthroid. I do not understand this at all seeing as his a hormone replacement_ and if my levels are already high_ why would he want to give me more? This is the 3rd doctor that has tried to do this to me here.

Most of my research shows that a good endocrinologist will treat with a combination on T3 and T4. If yours is saying no_ and you don't feel good on T4 alone_ demand that they let you try the T3. If they still say no_ write the head of the hospital where they work_ or find another doctor. It is your life! Make sure you feel good and demand answers if you don't!,,F,45,14  days5mcg 1X D,3/5/2012,Cytomel
45, 2, Hypothyroidism (Low Thyroid),Generic version (12.5 mcg ? half of a 25 mcg. Tablet) ? Experienced fatigue and sleepiness along with some very slight burning in my nostrils.  I also felt a little ?foggy-minded? and dizzy.,I don't think I even needed this and that the initial fatigue I had with the Levoxyl was due to my body having to take the time to convert the T4 to T3 (since I stopped the Armour Thyroid and it had T3 in it already).  [Note:  I was taking Armour Thyroid prior to this and it didn't seem to do much].,M,49,7  days12.5 mcg 1X D,3/5/2012,Cytomel
46, 1, Depression,Tremor_ forgetfulness_ slight weight gain_ really messed up thyroid_ shortness of breath,"I recently went to my primary doctor for my quarterly checkup and he told me that when he saw my blood tests_ they read that my thyroid was ""really out of whack"" and recommended I stop taking it. He was also going to send the recommendation to my psychiatrist. I took his advice_ threw the remaining pills down the toilet and will seek an adjunct antidepressant. It also did nothing for my depression anyway.",F,48,3  months25 1X D,12/24/2011Email,Cytomel
47, 2, hypothyroid; reduced T3,"Started at 1/day and had increased appetite and weight gain-- 5lbs the first week.  My MD told me to up to two times a day if I wasn't feeling relief from my symptoms(always cold_ tired etc) and I did that about 3 weeks ago.  My appetite normalized BUT I have gained about 8 pounds in 6 wks.  I still feel cold_ tired and ""brain fogged"".",,F,34,45  days5mcg 2X D,10/15/2011Email,Cytomel
48, 5, Hypothyroid_ Deppression_ & Fatigue,Much less Agitation and nervousness than in the past so far,My personal experience has shown me that the benefits of taking T-3 far outweigh of side effects of T-4_ If T-3 is started at very low doses (5 mcg) and is gradually increased over 2- 3 Months. I remember what the agitation was like when I tried to increase my dose to 25 mcg. of T-3 too quickly. I started my dosage at 5 mcg/day and then up to 5x day at 3 to 5 hour intervals. I then increased my dosages up to 10 mcg 3X day. Sometimes the afternoon doses can be reduced to 5 mcg.for the entire day. For about a year_ I needed 30 to 35 mcg. of T-3 a day to prevent real nasty depression and to avoid memory loss associated with Hypothroid. Thyroid Resistance may be the issue in my case. I've been very blessed in the last 3 days in that I seem to be holding out on just 15 mcg/day(5mcg at 7:00_ 11;00 & 3:00) believe that it's possible for some people on thyroid medication to have more complications with T-4 than T-3. You might want to check out Dr. Lowe's website regarding this: http://www.drlowe.com/ If you find that T-3 works better than T-4_ you will probably eventually have a suppressed TSH(in taking at least 25 mcg. which is normal & temporary although endocrinologists don't like the notion  When taking T-3_ you really have to adjust your dose and ask yourself which is worse: a little nervousness or more depression_ poor memory& focus?  Very small amounts of the right tranquilizers can offset the nervousness.I am only partially in agreement with Wilson's Temperature,M,62,16  months5mcg 3X D,9/22/2011EmailHistory,Cytomel
49, 4, Depression,Perhaps increased appetite,This is an update to when I first started taking Cytomel and experienced extreme anxiety. That has abated_ thankfully_ and I'm 150mcg synthroid and 25 mg Cytomel. It hasn't quite cleared up my depression yet_ nor my afternoon fatigue_ but at least I can get out of bed in the morning. I'd give it a 5 if my depression and fatigue were licked; maybe I need to give it more time.,F,48,2  months25 1X D,9/17/2011Email,Cytomel
50, 4, Hypothyroidism_ chronic fatigue,Blood pressure increased.,Finally I have some energy and brain fog is reduced after adding 15 mcg cytomel to  50mcg dose of synthroid. On synthroid alone my labs looked good_ but I felt tired and foggy-headed. Cytomel reduces that tired foggy-headed feeling. My blood pressure got high when I experimented with a 25mcg dose of cytomel_ so went back down to 15 mcg which is bringing my blood pressure down some.,F,53,2  years15mcg 1X D,9/7/2011Email,Cytomel

Adjusted med (5mcgs)to take 1/2 pill in the am and the other 1/2 in the pm and this helped decrease side effects. Slight nausea_ but this two subsided.,"It's done wonders for me.

Have tried (literally) every SSRI_ SNRI_ MAOI_ RIMA_ Tricyclic antidepressant medication ever made over ten years.  None of them helped me. Cytomel made my depression disappear in two days. It was like someone turned on the life switch. My thyroid tests were normal_ and remain normal. Do not start this drug higher than 5 mcg's! That's ""micrograms."" move to 10 mcg's maximum for depression. You will feel what it is like to be alive for the first time in your life.

53, 2, To augment Wellbutrin,ANXIETY!!!!!!!!!,It may have been because my pdoc didn't reduce my dosage of Synthroid_ which is 150mcg_ but the first time I took 25mcg it did absolutely nothing. The second time I took it_ it took eight valium tablets_ four propranolol tablets and four over the counter sleep pills to even begin to calm me down. After that I slept forever_ but I was up at 1 this morning and_ like a fool_ took another pill and went through this all over again. How long does this last? Can I cut the pills in half? Can I take them later in the day? I was so counting on this to help me with my treatment-resistant depression because I had tried everything and my bed and pillow have become my best friends.,F,47,4  days25mg 1X D,7/25/2011Email,Cytomel
54, 1, RT3 issues,Horrible_ anxiety_ depression_ crying_ feel out of control emotionally. Panicky_ feeling very sweaty and over heating. very rapid pulse_ high b/p swollen feet and hands. headaches. all this on only 2 days on this drug. I thought it was going to be a miracle drug for my severe Reverse T3. it's been nothing but a nightmare. I am using the generic form of cytomel by Paddock Labs. I may (if I want to continue) try the compounded T3 or ask my doctor for the real thing. Generics have fillers and this one has talc in it too. and to think I am supposed to raise the dose? I don't think so. I want to stop but I don't know if you can just stop. I have only been on it for 2 days and it's been a real nightmare. Oh_ did I mention insomnia too. I would think twice before taking it.,,F,55,2  days5 MCG's 2X D,7/24/2011Email,Cytomel

Severe hair loss.,This drug has been a complete nightmare.  Be very very careful when taking this drug. I do not have a thryoid and have been on Synthriod for the past 18 years.  I was feeling very tired and T3 levels were very low so my Dr. prescribed Cytomel starting with 5mcg then to 25 mcg.  Immediately I had nausea and could not eat.  I lost 10 lbs in two weeks and my bmi in now 17.  Anxiety levels were very high and I could not sleep properly.  I have discontinued the drug and finally am able to eat a meal and enjoy it.

57, 5, Hypothyroidism,None.  More energy but that's a good thing :),After years of living in a fog I was prescribed cytomel.  I was previously kn levothyroxine and tried armour... Adding cytolmel to the levothyroxine helped tremendously.  The first day I had a headache but the day after was the best day I had had in years.  Every once in a while I'll feel sluggish again but nothing compared to the suffering I was experiencing prior to cytomel.  Also_ I was prescribed cytomel 5mg 2x daily... For the first few weeks_ I only took 1/day.  When taking T3 it is important to start at a low dose to avoid heart palpitations and chest pain.  I saw a few of you posted about that along with anxiety.  Try starting out with a very small dose and gradually increase it.  Hope this helps :),F,24,2  months5mg 2X D,6/29/2011Email,Cytomel
58, 1, Hypothyroidism,ANXIETY!! No relief from hypo symptoms_ total loss of appetite_ weight gain_ nausea_ diarrhea_ joint pain_ irritability_ nail ridges_ painful menstrual cramps_ suicidal thoughts_ depression.,Despite a super low freeT4_ my endo gave me cytomel thinking I would go hyper on a T4 drug. First week felt more alert and energized. After that it was all down hill from there. After 2 blood tests and a list of horrible symptoms on this alone my doctor was finally willing to prescribe me armour since cytomel suppressed both my TSH and T4 to almost 0. Cytomel will naturally suppress your t4 because it is replacing what your own thyroid does. This drug should only be used if someone has a hard time converting t4 to t3. I am now on Nature-Throid  which is another brand like Armour Thyroid. It has alleviated most of my symptoms_ but still working on finding the right dose. If your doctor is not willing to prescribe it_ I would recommend changing doctors.,F,24,12  weeks25mcg 2X D,6/21/2011,Cytomel
