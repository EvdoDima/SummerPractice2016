1, 5, Hypothyroid/Major Depressive Disord,Increase in energy_ no longer feel like all I want to do is sleep_ daily crying has greatly reduced,Have been on levothyroxine for about 8 years and just never felt any benefit to being on it_  had crazy weight gain of synthroid (18lbs in 3 months).  After a ton of research and lots of debate with in primary care doc_ I went off of synthyroid_ she wouldn't even consider cytomel. My shrink prescribed the cytomel for depression and so far I am very optimistic.  I will never go back to synthroid or any other T4 drug.  If cytomel continues to lift my depression and hopefully my panic attacks_ my goal is to get off of lexapro/buspar.,F,45,4  weeks25 mcg 1X D,7/6/2016Email,Cytomel

3, 4, Hashimoto's thyroiditis,"I've only been on it two days_ but already feel a difference: more awake_ more energy! I have been hypothyroid for DECADES_ and given Synthoid (a.k.a. ""Syncrap"") for decades_ by TSH-obsessed_ ignorant doctors. I never felt much better on Synthroid and physicians always told me ""your TSH is fine""_ and insinuated that my complaints were 'all in my head'. What jerks! Endocrinologists were particularly useless and especially uncaring. Last winter I discovered Stop The Thyroid Madness book and website & learned about NDT (natural dessicated thyroid). I found a naturopathic doctor who was knowledgable about NDT_ and got on it asap. What a HUGE difference! People_ if your doctor focuses on 'what your TSH level is""_ RUN! Find a good healer who prescribes NDT! Recently my dr said I needed to add T3 to my NDT_ and I started. Cytomel 2 days ago. I feel my brainfog lifting & am thinking more clearly already! Good stuff!",I have no side effects_ so far. I may need to up my dosage level over time. This stuff is great (for me)!

4, 4, hypothyroidism/ weight gain,stomach cramps approx. 5-6 hours after taking.  It goes away after an hour or so. May or may not be related_ but only occurred since I've been taking it. Sometimes I feel hyped up mentally.,For three weeks I've been on 25mcg once a day 30 mins. before lunch_ or 2 hours after lunch. Seemed to work right away for me as far as energy and feeling good. I don't take afternoon naps anymore and instead of falling asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow_ I'm awake longer. It hasn't helped with my weight gain this far_which was what I was hoping for.  I've gained 40lbs since December 2014 and no matter what I did I couldn't lose it.  I workout and never stopped_ because my thyroid was out of whack I slowed down.  I went longer to compensate_ but I kept gaining.  I'm hoping this kicks in so I can start losing. My endocrinologist said this should jump start my thyroid /metabolism.

8, 5, Hashimoto & Thyrodectomy,So far I have had no negative side affects.,"I am a male 74 years old and an avid writer.  I had been on thyroid replacement therapy since age 17.  I was feeling foggy_ sleeping 10 hours every night_ lethargic_ my mind was gone on vacation and I was unable to write.  I argued with my Dr. about not reducing my T4. but he reduced it anyway.  He said I needed to go the ""Quack"" in Spanish Fork.  As I left his office_ I ask him_ ""What is the address of that Quack?""  I went to the Quack who turned out to be my Savior. She started me with 5mcg twice a day then she prescribed 10mcg twice a day.  My T4 was reduced to by the first Dr from 150mcg to 125mcg.  The Quack reduced my T4 from 125mcg to 100mcg_ but also increased my cytomel_ now at 10mcg twice per day.Overall I have lost about 20 pounds all belly fat_ but that was just a plus.  What is important is_ I got my life back.  I am now sleeping 8 hours a night_ instead of 10.  I wake up invigorated_ rested_ and refreshed.  My mind decided to function again and now I am back writing.  I got my life back!  I am so thankful that I went to see that Quack!  I had no idea that T3 even existed.  My family Dr was wrong_ he was ""old"" school and refused to treat me for T3.  My life would have been over had I not gone to the Quack in Spanish Fork_ UT.  She treated me with cytomel and now the foggyness in my mind is gone.  Without my ability to write_ my life was meaningless.  I am here_ 100%.  It is good to be back.

9, 1, Hashimoto's Hypothryoid,headaches_ migraine with aura_ tinnitus_head buzzing_ blurring of vision_light sensitivity_ eye lid swelling_  dizzy spells_ tired_ weakness_ night sweats_ high blood pressure spikes with high pulse_ heart palpitations_ nausea_ dehydration_ diahrrea_ caffeine and exersize intolerance_ memory loss_ some hair loss_ eventually swelling of full face and shortness of breath.,"My doctor added this to my Synthroid 125mcg. that I have been taking for many years.  At first she started me on 5mcg.  I thought I was doing okay_ not realizing at the time the the mild headaches and slight blurry vision was due to this drug until she upped it to 10mcg. After I started on the higher dose_ the other more severe symptoms started and I ended up having a ""Thyroid Storm"" that was a severe life threatening condition and t-3 pooling.  It took weeks to get out of my system_ not 24 hours as the Doctor said.  It was very difficult and scary.  Be very careful with this drug.  It goes directly in to your blood bypassing your liver.  Don't take it at the same time as t4 and definitey don't take it at the same time as estrogen or estradiol.  T4_ T3 and estrogen will dialate the blood vessels which can cause a stroke or heart attack! The pharmacy gave me the generic Liothyronine and I don't know if this had anything to do with the bad reaction that I had or that I'm allergic to it.  But I will never take this drug again!

Once I separated those two meds everything was great.,I took 25mcg for 5 years. Over time I guess my thyroid function decreased and I realized I prob needed a dosage increase.

11, 4, Metabolism_ weight gain,The first time I was on it for the two years_ I lost 65# in 2 months doing ABSOLUTELY nothing different.  She started me on 2 wks 25s_ then 2 weeks 50s_ then the 75s.  My temperature went from a regular_ always  96 to 98.6_ my eyebrows grew back_ I wasn;t going from cold to hot to cold to hot anymore.  Then I went in the hospital for something else and they took me off every medication I was taking and put me only on the ones they felt I needed for the kidney problem I was in for..  When I came out my primary care put me back on_ full strength - 75 mg.  Within 3 days FULLY HALF my hair fell out.  HALF.  It was awful.  It was coming out in chunks and handfulls at a timre.   Finally_ after thinking about it_ I realized it had to be the full dose of cytomel right away.  I myself stopped it and waited a couple of weeks and then did it the way my other dr did.  2 weeks on 25s_ etc.  This time_ however no weight loss.  Everything else cleared up like the first time_ but not a pound of weight,Can be a really good medication.  I particularly liked that 65# gone in a flash.

18, 1, low thyroid,It seems either this drug is heaven to some hell to others. In the 3 months I was on it had extreme rash & itching. Little bumps on both breast & legs. Extreme swelling of legs_ ankles & feet. Hair in front fell off! Gained 20 lbs in 3 months. Brain fog.,Thank God for this forum. After reading some of the bad comments here I realized all my symptoms were due to Cytomel. From the day after I took myself off I got relief. It's been 2 weeks & I'm 95% clear of all symptoms. Some dried up bumps here & there & mild itching every now & then. Lesson learned..listen to your body. Cytomel may work for everyone else but you may be the one it doesn't work for.

25, 5, Augment Antidepressant,Maybe some slight anxiety at first_ slight sweating. Not many adverse side effects noticed.,So far_ Cytomel has worked tremendously for my treatment resistant depression.  I was prescribed a small dose of Cytomel to help augment the antidepressant I had been taking but seemed to no longer work.  I tried the generic form of Cytomel and had anxiety_ more tearfulness_ I just felt awful.  The doctor then switched to brand name and those symptoms totally went away.  Within about three weeks time I noticed a tremendous difference in my depression.  I was far less anxious and that terrible feeling of dread/impending doom was gone.  I because more interested in things again and within two months of taking it I am back to myself again.  I was having some symptoms of hypothyroidism but my tests always came back within normal range.  I was losing hair_ gaining weight_ the outer third of my eyebrows were gone.

Also gone off synthroid for last two days to see if more energy comes back.,On 75 mcg synthroid for 4 1/2 years high TSH. 15. Doc guilted me into continuing the synthroid. Synthroid completely exhausted me. Took all of my energy away and couldn't hardly get out of bed I was so tired. Doc said due to depression not synthroid. Took Prozac and did nothing. Had to get off synthroid to get any energy back. Got back on synthroid when symptoms came back each time. Discovered first doc only testing for TSH. Not t3 or t4.looked at two endos that couldn't help. Strange_ I think they might have been diabetes endos not thyroid endos.   When new doc tested t3 and t4 both at the very lowest level in each range.  OnInternet looked up books written by Mary showman about thyroid.  This is where I found cytomel. Have new doctor the last 6 months. Who also put me on provil upon my request and saved my life. Now has me on cytomel. And finally getting my energy and health back.

I didn't do well on Synthroid alone. Cytomel suppresses TSH_ but my endo says that TSH can be meaningless after treatment has begun and he doses based on free t4 and free t3 levels and how I'm feeling. I feel fantastic!

40, 3, Hypo/hyper thyroidism,Feel back to normal after morning dose of 5mg_ more energy_ clarity.,I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 28 yes old after my second child was born.  Was put on 100 mg of levithroid for 15 years with very minimal dosage adjustments.  I did great on it.  In 2009_ all hell broke loose with my hormones.  Went into perimenopause and my thyroid was out of whack.  For 3 years I have been suffering with dizziness_ fatigue_ weight gain_ heart palps_ irregular periods and horrible pms.  Saw a homeapathic hormone specialist the last year and she has been tweaking my thyroid as it keeps fluctuating from high t4to low t3 and reverse t3.  She put me on a high dose of t3 compound_ for 10 months I was fine on it but the last month has been complete HELL with major fatigue dizziness and heart palps and anxiety attacks.  Was finally referred to an endocronolgist from my regular insurance just this week.  She put me on 3 days (taper down) of cytomel twice a day 50 mg to 10 mg.  Starting 150 levithroid tomorrow once daily.  The cytomel feels like a burst of energy to me for about 5 hours_ then I plummet into extreme fatigue again be foe my second dose.

41, 1, ,At first_ my levels were a little on the low side_ so my doctor put me on 5 mcg cytomel. After only 1 week she checked my blood again and said that there was no change. I thought this was weird because usually you wait 3 weeks after starting a new medication. She bumped me up to 25mcg. I was on the small side (120_ 5'6'') and I thought that was quite a jump. Well after 3 weeks on 25mcg_ I have INTENSE chest pains_ and diffeculty breathing. And now I am only 112 lbs. My endo told me to stop it right away. I am now on the hyper end for my thyroid_ and my endo wants to put me on synthroid. I do not understand this at all seeing as his a hormone replacement_ and if my levels are already high_ why would he want to give me more? This is the 3rd doctor that has tried to do this to me here.

Most of my research shows that a good endocrinologist will treat with a combination on T3 and T4. If yours is saying no_ and you don't feel good on T4 alone_ demand that they let you try the T3. If they still say no_ write the head of the hospital where they work_ or find another doctor. It is your life!

48, 5, Hypothyroid_ Deppression_ & Fatigue,Much less Agitation and nervousness than in the past so far,My personal experience has shown me that the benefits of taking T-3 far outweigh of side effects of T-4_ If T-3 is started at very low doses (5 mcg) and is gradually increased over 2- 3 Months. I remember what the agitation was like when I tried to increase my dose to 25 mcg. of T-3 too quickly. I started my dosage at 5 mcg/day and then up to 5x day at 3 to 5 hour intervals. I then increased my dosages up to 10 mcg 3X day. Sometimes the afternoon doses can be reduced to 5 mcg.for the entire day. For about a year_ I needed 30 to 35 mcg. of T-3 a day to prevent real nasty depression and to avoid memory loss associated with Hypothroid. Thyroid Resistance may be the issue in my case. I've been very blessed in the last 3 days in that I seem to be holding out on just 15 mcg/day(5mcg at 7:00_ 11;00 & 3:00) believe that it's possible for some people on thyroid medication to have more complications with T-4 than T-3. You might want to check out Dr. Lowe's website regarding this: http://www.drlowe.com/ If you find that T-3 works better than T-4_ you will probably eventually have a suppressed TSH(in taking at least 25 mcg. which is normal & temporary although endocrinologists don't like the notion  When taking T-3_ you really have to adjust your dose and ask yourself which is worse: a little nervousness or more depression_ poor memory& focus?  Very small amounts of the right tranquilizers can offset the nervousness.I am only partially in agreement with Wilson's Temperature,M,62,16  months5mcg 3X D,9/22/2011EmailHistory,Cytomel

The thyroid fluctuates between hyper and hypothyroidism and can be very frustrating.  I had been taking 50 mcg of generic Levoxyl and yet the TSH level dropped lower.  My endocrinologist suggested we could either increase Levoxyl to 75 mcg or stay at 50 and add T-3 (generic Cytomel) so I went along with Cytomel.  For the first 2 weeks_ I felt fine_ but then the terrible symptoms started in.  The first was tingling in the face and left fingers_ then blood pressure of 165/105.  Some days I might feel OK and then symptoms would start again going from anxiety attacks to bouts of anger lasting over an hour about once a week.  Every couple of days_ I spent hours feeing chilled from the inside out.  Once I went off the drug_ it took a full 6 weeks for all the side effects to abate.

Today_ I've split both tablets and going to take 12.5 daily with 75mcg daily of Syn.  I can add on as needed_ but I think I need to gradually work up. I have to take the generic because of Tricare refusing to cover the brand.  I've heard a ton of negative about the generic_ but I have no choice_ it's $3 for a month or $47...I have to be practical.  Mine is from Paddock_ which seems to have better review than the other generic company Mylan_ who has been under investigation.

Now I am totally off the antidepressant and have lost 12 lbs. My TSH is 1.23 and my cholesterol is down to 173 from 257. I am not taking a T4 supplement. Cytomel has been great for me.

85, 4, Hypothyroidism small goiter,Problems with generic Cytomel.,"I have been hypothyroid with a small goiter for many years_ I just got a doctor to treat me a year and a half ago. I have been on a roller coaster with drugs starting with the old Armour thyroid_ then levoxyl and and cytomel. Didn't stay on Armour long enough to see what it could do before it was unavailable. Went up and down with Levoxyl and cytomel. Finally settled on 25mcg levoxyl once a day and 10mcg cytomel twice a day. Stayed that dose for four months then bumped the cytomel up to 15mcg twice a day. When I first started cytomel I took the non-generic_ but because of the high cost I tried to switch to generic. After three days on the generic I was climbing the walls. It was a very bad trip. If you are having trouble with Cytomel and are taking the generic I suggest trying the non-generic before you give up. Non-generic made a very big positive difference and worth spending the extra money. The only thing now is that I am having a very bad case of the ""blues."" But it may just be ""life.""",F,67,1  years15mcg 2X D,8/20/2010,Cytomel
86, 2, Thyroid,Throat tightness and pain_ voice cracking_ lump in throat,I couldn't continue this drug because it caused too many throat symptoms for me.  It activated my thyroid to the point where it was constantly swollen_ which caused throat pain_ caused my voice to crack_ and it felt like I constantly had a lump in my throat like I was about to cry.  I waited two weeks (per doctor's recommendation) to see if it went away_ but I felt like it was interfering with my daily life and it never went away.  I did not work up to a high enough dose to take away any of my hypo symptoms because of this.

87, 2, to supplement T4 (Synthroid),Even with this tiny dose (I cut a 5 MCG tab in half) I had seriously heavy break-through bleeding.,I've been on Synthroid for 14 years and was currently alternating between 112 and 125mcg.  I decided to stay on just the 112mcg dose for two weeks before starting the Liothyronine (Paddock Laboratory's generic for Cytomel) in order to reduce my T4 a bit.  I am also on the contraceptive_ Lutera_ but I never bleed at this time of the month.  Within a couple hours of taking the Liothyronine (at 3PM_ 12 hours after Synthroid)_ I had spotting.  The heavy bleeding happened overnight.  It could be coincidental that this happened exactly at the same time I started on the new medicine_ but that's not likely.  I tend to be very sensitive to drugs and perhaps the Liothyronine stimulated the reproductive part of my endocrine system.  I did NOT experience any heart palpitations or dizziness.  I had some anxiety_ but it was related to the bleeding.  I will stop taking the Liothyronine.  Right now_ it's the next afternoon and I'm still bleeding lightly.  We'll see how long it lasts.  If it stops soon and doesn't come back_ I may try the medicine another time_ just to make sure this wasn't a fluke.,F,52,1  days.25 MCG 1X D,8/3/2010,Cytomel

89, 5, Hypothyroidism,The only negative side effects that I have noticed is a skipped heart beat every so often. Usually occurs when I'm idle or before going to sleep. I never notice this during the day or while excercising. I think as I continue to reduce my Synthroid(T4) dosage_ this should subside.,"T3 has been great. I was apprensive as I approached my doctor about adding T3 as he is in his late 60's and I thought he would be old fashion. To my suprise_ he said ""sure"". I was so happy. I am 6' and 180lbs. I take 12.5mcg 4x per day. I don't see how 5mcg can do anything for people_ even small women. 5mcg is an incredibly small dose 1 time per day. No wonder those people don't notice any increased energy and continue with hypo symptoms. Bodybuilders_ celeberties and athletes take up to 100mcg per day of T3. And those people are not even diagnosed with Hypothyroidism like we are. Of course T3 is much stronger and faster acting than T4_ so 100mcg is a lot. But they are essentially abusing T3 for incredible/substantial fat loss purposes. I was originally on 50mcg of T4 as a starter dose. After being on T3 I have reduced the dose in half and now have stopped. I spread out my T3 throughout the day. With T3_ I no longer need any naps in the afternoon. I think more clearly and am more productive. I am no longer cold all the time and I have lost 2 lbs of bodyfat. I am an athlete so I am in pretty good condition_ so the bodyfat reduction is basically carving out the last bits of stubborn fat. I think sedentary people that were overweight to begin with_ would see substantial weight loss with a reasonably substantial dose. I spread my doses out every 3-4 hrs starting around mid-day and finishing before bed as it keeps my metabolism up throughout the nightime.",M,50,8  weeks12.5 4X D,7/26/2010,Cytomel

I have been on T4 since 2006 and_ according to my new endocrinoligist (the one who prescribed Cytomel)_ have likely been under/mistreated the whole time.  I never really felt better or had my symptoms lessen on T4.  In fact_ in the past few months_ I've been experiencing quick and mild (but noticeable) flutters in my chest.  They stopped the FIRST DAY I took Cytomel.  I also felt profoundly calm and even_ which I have not seen many people report feeling on this board.  I didn't feel like I was ""energized""_ but I did notice that I was NOT feeling fatigued...something altogether new to me at this point.  Over the past four days_ I have felt a very even-keel_ steady sense of alertness and calmness that is wonderful.  I literally can't remember the last time I felt so at ease_ so the Cytomel seems to be doing something for me.  In addition_ I have been sleeping VERY SOUNDLY.

At age 41 I still had these symptoms plus developed depression and anxiety. My blood pressure went up_ I began to cry for no reason. I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed wellibutrin and klonopin. This helped my symptoms but I still did not feel completely myself inside. My husband a school teacher has a wellness test offered at his school so I registered for it. The results were my thyroid was not working properly. I knew it but the doctors always had reasons for my symptoms. So when I got those results I showed my psychiatrist and he put me on cytomel.

110, 5, hypothyroidism,If I take too much over time I feel hyper so I just drop back on the dose.  It does suppress TSH and T4 so most doctors want some addition of T4 if they are even willing to give you T3. Over the 10 years that I have used T3 I found the compounded formula to be easier to adjust than Cytomel although it is always a good back up if the compound formula looses its strength.,In addition to hypothyroidism I also have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia.  With CFS patients it is fairly well established that they have problems converting T4 to the active form T3.  The T3 is what goes to work in many body functions_ not the T4.  Most doctors only test T4 and TSH and can miss if you are hypothyroid.  Insist on having your T3 tested.  If using T3 it is best to supplement with T4 to maintain a balance in the thyroid chemistry.  Other important condsiderations that many doctors do not know of are the interaction of thyroid hormones with a protein pump inhibitor like Prilosec or Omeprazol.  A PPI will reduce your thyroid function.  So do some SSRI like Cymbalta.  If you are taking any other drug do a search of that drug and how it interacts with thyroid medication.  Wait for the eye-opener your doctor does not know about!  Always take T3 4-6 hours from calcium which seems to be in all our foods and iron as they compete for the same receptor sites in the body and they win out over the T3 usually.  If you are female you most likely already know the biggest challenge is HRT as it interfers with the use of cytomel or any form of thyroid medication.  It takes time and patience to get the dosing right and it is important that you have blood work done every 6 months in the beginning so you do not go hyper or stay undermedicated.

124, 4, low-end normal thyroid,None.,It has given me extra energy. I am giving it a four_ though_ because it is not a permanent solution to the thyroid problem itself. I am on the low end of normal and that has to be watched.,F,41,1  years,7/3/2009,Cytomel
125, 3, underactive thyroid,Endless list_ depression_ weight gain_ period problems_ fatigue_ memory loss so bad couldn ́t even remember every day words.  Used to drive my car and not know where I was or where I was going! Since taking Cytomel all of my symptoms have improved to some degree but I could do with more help.,I take 12 mg of cytomel plus 100 mg of thyroxine daily.  I have just started taking provera (progesterone) for multiple uterine polyps and it has helped my depression and loss of appetite.  I don ́t feel so overwhelmed.  I believe that I have the polyps as a result of my underactive thyroid. The combination of my meds means that I am feeling better than I have been for the last 30 years.,F,44,5  years,6/21/2009,Cytomel
126, 5, fibromyalgia,None! Well_ a slightly elevated heartbeat.,My nurse practitioner slowly raised my dose. When I began feeling somewhat hyper she dropped the dose a bit. My body tolerates 50mcg well even tho my thyroid tests indicated low-normal readings before I started Cytomel. The advantages for me have been nearly endless. More energy_ less aching_ a happier outlook! Love the stuff!,F,46,1  years,6/5/2009Email,Cytomel

128, 5, Severe Depression,Dry brittle hair_ some falling out_ burning scalp_ some weight gain/edema.,Tried 35 antidressant drugs for severe treatment resisitant depression - the kind where you are in bed 23 of 24 hours a day.  It's a bad place to be.  And it's not a mental thing only_ the physical is as bad_ or worse...wondering if you have the energy to climb the stairs_ to get to the bathroom.  Cytomel changed that in one day.  20 years of depression gone in one day.  It was like someone gave CPR to my soul.  Very hard to describe.  You take a look around at your house...not cleaned in 6 months_ and you can't quite contemplate the change.  It's actually quite scary the change - you're alive again.  Cytomel gave me my life back.  And at only 5mcg's twice a day. There really needs to be some more research done on depression as the drug co's seem to have settled on the neurotransmitter model.  Well_ I'm living proof that they are wrong.  Try it!,,40,1  years,5/9/2009,Cytomel
129, 3, Hypothyroid,With the fast release I would get palpitations and felt shot of breath jumping and anxious in the morning - later I would feel cold and sluggish.  I now use the Cytomel compounded for slow release - works better. 50ug synthorid and 5 ug cytomel.,I can't think of any good reason for the standard drug to not be slow release.,M,54,2  years,4/24/2009Email,Cytomel
130, 5, no thyroid function,none,Took synthroid starting in 2003 was never happy with that. No Dr would beleive I was allergic to it. 3 mts ago started on cytomel and got my life back.

Why don't Dr listen to there patients so many years and so many tests. Thank god my struggle is over.,M,54,3  months,3/27/2009,Cytomel
131, 4, thyroid cancer (surgery 3 yrs ago),Insomnia,"My endo reduced my Levoxyl from 200 mcg mon-sat to 200 mcg mon-fri and 100 mcg on sat because my TSH was below normal. TSH checked three months later and it dropped lower but I was not having signs of hyperthyroid. My endo suspects my cancer may have returned so she wants me to have another thryoid scan. I was supposed to have only blood test with thyrogen since last three scans were ""clean"". She wants me to go through hormone withdrawel and has me taking cytomel 25 mcg 1/2 a pill every 12 hours for 30 days and no Levoxyl_ then nothing for two weeks_ then scan.  I expected to start feeling hypothyroid but instead am feeling great - normal again. I didn't know if this is normal or not. Cytomel is not a common drug used in my area because the pharmacist had to retrieve it from another store (their branch). I've only been using it for 9 days and I don't want this great feeling to go away. I also don't feel the urge to eat all the time and I have energy that I havn't felt in year",F,44,9  days,3/11/2009,Cytomel

I now take 25 mcg in the morning_ 25 mcg in the afternoon_ and 12-1/2 mcg in the evening.,I was on Synthroid_ then Armour thyroid -- neither of which provided me with much relief from my chronic fatigue.  Cytomel gave me a life I never had.

So far so good on the itching (none) and lesions are going away and when my husband touches my back it is not like nerves shooting all around.......I ALSO HAD PARATHYROID taken out - becuase of overgrowth - no cancer!  THAT helped me immensley with clarity of mind etc.  I feel pretty good and would feel better IF I COULD GET 30 lbs off me.,F,46,2  years,2/21/2009,Cytomel

140, 5, thyroid cancer - total thyroidectom,,I am currently on combined dosage with synthroid.  At first_ when only on the cytomel post op_ I felt amazing.  Had energy_ no depression_ weight loss but after being on combined therapy_ I rapidly gained weight (6lbs) and cannot lose it_ I am fatigued.  Endocrinoligist wants my tsh suppressed but I feel like the synthroid is counteracting what my cytomel has done to help me.  There are three comments posted by women within my age group who have gone through surgery but have not posted their email.  I am hoping they will read and contact me via email.  I am really frustrated and wonder if it would be ok to just take cytomel alone.  I am tired of being sick and tired.,M,41,8  months,12/31/2008Email,Cytomel

142, 3, t3 levels mildly low,wondering if anyone has experienced an inflammation similar to rosecea or worse_ with the use of cytome?  It may have started gradually over the course of 5 weeks and then totally blew up (on my face only)looks like the worst sunburn that i have ever had.,other than that i have found the cytomel .25 in conjunction with the levo .75 to work fine.  wonder is there is a connection or if something else could be happening with with deficient thyroid?,F,51,8  weeks,12/22/2008Email,Cytomel
143, 4, T3 at low end of range_ hypo signs,The first time I tried it (2.5 mcg) I went hyper so had racing heart_ extreme heart palpitations_ pounding heart_ extreme dizziness_ headaches_intense ringing in ears_ probably should have gone to the hospital it was so bad.  Only took me 4 days to go hyper.  Am trying it again starting with 2.5 mcg.  On that dose I had no side effects and it was making me feel better.  After 2 weeks (just today) am upping to 5 mcg.  Am having some irritability_ sweating_ some pressure in my eyes.  Will see what happens in a few days.  I know these may subside.,Am writing this for the lady who posted 11/02/08 who has had hypothyroidism since she was 12_ I hope you find this it may help.  After my first epxerience I found out the reason I went hyper was because I was adrenally fatigued.  I had done an adrenal saliva test 2 years before I started the cytomel and the test showed I was fatigued.  I guess the doc thought I was all better and prescribed the cytomel without doing another test.  Well I found another doc (Dr. Lowe) and he had me do another adrenal test.  He said it was likely I was still adrenally fatigued.  Sure enough I was.  You are not supposed to do thyroid meds if you have an adrenal issue.  It will cause you grief.  It even says this in the literature that comes with the cytomel.  So I have been taking Isocort for the last 2 months to help my adrenals and am know trying cytomel again.  The Isocort was very helpful.  If you've been taking thyroid meds for a long time and didn't have an adrenal problem you can still develop one o,F,53,2  times,12/12/2008Email,Cytomel
144, 4, Added cytomel to synthroid,Not as cold or tired; T4 absorption mildly improved per blood tests.,Dosage of synthroid is only .125 mg._ allegedly to 'prevent osteoporosis.' Sure doesn't prevent getting fat! Tiny amount of cytomel really helps without giving any 'hyper' symptoms. Have lost 2 lbs. in 3 monthsnothing dramatic_ and may be due to more exercise_ because now I feel more like exercising. Much better to feel alive than dead....,F,63,3  months,12/8/2008,Cytomel

150, 1, Hypothyroidism,I was taking Levothyroxine 200 mcg before my doctor put me on cytomel.  He hoped the cytomel would help me to lose weight.  He reduced my levo to 125 mcg and put me 50 mcg of ctyomel.  I have seen no weight improvement in six months_ in fact I gained 4 pounds.  My pulse is always to fast and I often have chest pain.  My doctor recently reduced the cytomel to 25 mcg a day but so far I have had no relief in the chest pain.  I was much happier with just regular levo_ I had no side effects from that.,,F,31,6  months,10/23/2008,Cytomel

I feel like my old self. Increase in feeling of well being_ sex drive_ energy_ and motivation. I have taken just Armour and Thyrolar2 in the past... I could not stay with Thyrolar due to it's lactose base...so I had to return to Armour which is lactose free....the Armour and Cytomel combo is awesome. My depression which was mild is now gone.

I have heavy menstrual and my thyroid levels were at 34 which from what I was told_ they need to be at 8 and that is why i was told take to cytomel. I havent noticed any change as far as in weight but the side effects_ especially the tachycardia i can't handle. oh_ and the hair loss in the front_ scary. One more_ muscle pains lower back_ cramping on my legs. I cant very well sleep_ also i have increased urination at nights. I normally would go twice per night and it's now at 5 times per night. Maybe that is why i am also so tired when in the mornings.,F,34,1  weeks,10/20/2008,Cytomel

I have been ""jittery"" with some hand shaking and a mild headache for a short time in the am after taking the dosage(5mcg)_ but I have energy now to do things I have not been able to do since surgery.   I know that 5mcg is not alot and 5 days is a short time_ but I can tell a difference already.  I have noticed that my hair has started to fall out again (it was prior to having my thyroid removed)_ but it is mild and a small price to pay for feeling better.

154, 5, hypothyroid,"Before cytomel I was puffy and swollen and still very foggy.  I also take 50mcg of levoxyl.  The combination pulled me from depression and helped me to lose weight.  I love it and am glad I tried it.  I first read about it in ""The Thyroid Solution"" book_ took the info to my doctor and she prescribed 5mcg_ which was not enough.  The second week I went to 10_ still was not enought and then spent 2 weeks on 25.  Finally!  After I got the dose in my body for several weeks_ my blood levels went down and my doctor reduced again to 5.  So far so good!  I went to the doctor over a year ago for hypo symptoms_ lethargy_ extreme fatigue_ weight gain_ depression.  My blood test was normal but high_ my doctor did not know the levels have changed!  When I went back a year later_ my levels were well above normal_ I was  barely functioning_ could hardly drive a car.  Forgot where I was going.  I was really swollen_ pale_ dry skin_ hair falling out and getting fat!",Cytomel and Levoxyl helped me get my life back!

I was a wreck. Doc just switched me to 25mcg in the a.m. and 12.5 mcg in the p.m. The only noticable side effects have been sweating more - haven't done that in years! I have a diminished appatite. Also slight insomnia.  However_ I do suffer from sleep apnea and use a c-pap at night.,I am praying that the cytomel will work. I am tired of being tired and pretending that everything is fine. It's not and hasn't been for 14 yrs. If you tell someone how you really feel everyday_ then they think that you are a whiney crybaby.

156, 4, total thyroidectomy/cancer,Intolerance to heat - doesn't take much to work up a sweat; some muscle aches and restless legs; fatigue; tingly feeling all over at times but not much change in weight.  Really screwed up monthly cycle. Some days I feel absolutely useless. Nevertheless is better than being hypo with no meds at all as was the case before taking the radioactive iodine treatments. Will never do THAT again.,So far so good but wnder what long term will bring now that I must take this daily for the rest of my life.,F,46,8  months,8/11/2008,Cytomel
157, 4, total thyroidectomy,had surgery a year ago.  on 150mcg Synthroid (was on Armour before surgery).  docs were good about adding cytomel a few months post op.  It has made a huge difference - lifting depression_ making it possible to workout - no more shortness if breath_ and could get through the day AND evening without a nap.  As far as side effects go_ during the first week_ cytomel gave me muscle twitches.  these subsided after a couple of weeks.  palpitations continued for about 6 months.  I still have some chest pains on occasion_ and still get a tingly feeling around my lips 20 minutes after I take a pill.  (I'm up to 15mcg_ split into 3 doses throughout the day.)  Some skin symptoms improved - less acne/oily_ less dry_ but I'm still losing my hair and my nails developed ridges for the first time.,"I can't live without cytomel but I would like a better thyroid replacement.  When I still had a thyroid gland_ the supplements seemed to help more.  I believe the mysterious thyroid hormones - T1 and T2 - play a larger role than are suspected.  timing is also important - if I don't take my synthroid by 6:30am I feel jet lagged all day.  My endo says all his STT patients say ""there is a window"" of time in the morning you've got to get your meds on board.  my TSH is lower than 1 (suppressed to prevent cancer regrowth)_ and the antibodies are no longer detectable.  But It is very hard now to lose weight and frankly_ the fat just seems a lot more flabby and inaccessible.  I call cytomel my ""happy pills"" - but if my hair and nails don't improve I'm going to ask my doc to try something else. Thanks to all of you for describing your experiences.

Despite this_ I was bloated_ puffy extremities_ my skin was extremely dry_ my hair was brittle_ nails were getting ridges.  I asked my endocrinologist to try me on some Cytomel and she dropped my Synthroid dose to 75 mcg and added 5 mcg of Cytomel twice a day.  Hair seems thinner but puffiness of extremities seems better since adding Cytomel.  Not sure of dry skin changes since the weather has also changed during this period of time.,I notice that I am very tired in the late afternoons before taking my second dose of cytomel and am wondering if I am undermedicated.  My current TSH after taking the combination of Synthroid and Cytomel for 7 weeks is considered optimal so she is reluctant to make any changes other than to return me to the 112 mcg of Synthroid only with out Cytomel.  How do doctors determine the dosages of Cytomel and Synthroid when they drop the dose of Synthroid to make room for Cytomel?  Is there a chart?

If I stay on thehigher dose for more than a week_ I start feeling edgy_ so I alternate every otherday from the 2x to 3x/day levels. Remember that you can split your pills and do nothave to stay with a dose because it's the manufactured mcg. level.,I have recently changed Endos.  While the new one is tops in his field_ he is notsupportive of Cytomel.  If he requires that I stop it_ I will leave his practice as Ido not do well on Synthroid alone.  I feel best with a TSH of 1.0...He and I haveagreed that the combo results in the 1.0 TSH_ so he has taken the pressure off.,F,59,3  years,5/9/2008,Cytomel

Switched to Syntheroid but felt depressed and bloated all the time. Just switched over to Cytomel and don't feel as bloated but have severe light-headedness with moderate headache. Doctor prescribed 50mcgs_ and on the third day (today) decided I can't take this feeling so I cut the pill in half_ so far_ I still feel light headed with a slight headache. Feeling desparate and considering not taking anything at all_ and may turn to a holistic/alternative D.O.

175, 5, Hypothyroidism,Increased Hair Loss.  Was over active_ felt jittery and had difficulty sleeping initially when I first took T3_ which disappeared after about a week and have not returned.,After taking increasing amounts of levothyroxine for over 2 years_ I still suffered from a lot of hypothyroid symptons.  My endocrinologist agreed with me that I was still hypothyroid and so prescribed a combination of T3/T4.  During the first 5 weeks I  took 10mcg T3 with 75mcg levothyroxine and within days was feeling a lot better_ but noticed my hair loss had increased.  In the last 3 weeks  I have increased the T3 to 20mcg daily with 75mcg.  As a result_ I feel 100% better and my hair loss has diminished.  So hair loss could be a temporary side effect of T3.  I sleep well_ feel warm_ have softer skin and more energy.  For the first time in 2 years_ I can now exercise_ my breathlessness has vanished.  Also_ brain fog and depression have disappeared. For myself_ combining T3 with T4 has produced a remarkable improvement in my health.,F,66,8  weeks,3/19/2008,Cytomel

Side effects included: dry brittle head hair and head hair loss but significant hair growth on mustache_ chin and breasts; hundreds of pimples and rash bumps on face_ neck_ back and chest; clitoris swelled to three times normal size with compulsion to masturbate several times daily and arousal with any clothing touching the area; genital skin changed from cream color to dark brown; weight gain of three pounds per week for a total of twelve pounds by months end.,Was taking only 2.5 mcg which is half of the smallest dose available.  Cytomel was better than any anti-depressant I had been on for mood enhancement and it was great to feel a touch of youthful sexuality again.  However_ I had more testosterone than three men on steroids and it might have proved deadly for me had I stayed on any longer. After stopping Cytomel it took three weeks for my testosterone level to return to normal.  Most of the pimples have subsided and so far I have lost half of the twelve pounds I gained.,F,52,4  weeks,6/10/2007,Cytomel
216, 5, hypothyroidism,My doctor added cytomel to my Synthroid since my TSH levels and T3 and T4 were all inconsistent - had significant fatigue_ dramatic weight gain (15 lbs in one month!) and puffy neck and face.,Cytomel has made a HUGE difference!  I can focus and have clarity all day_ I have lost all the weight that I gained and my blood tests are ALL within normal range - this T3 supplement did the trick and was able to decrease dosage of Synthroid.  My doc has me take the Synthroid at bed time and the Cytomel first thing in the morning to aleviate false high TSH levels - I have the BEST doc in WORLD  ;-),F,45,7  years,6/6/2007,Cytomel

220, 1, Hashimotos Disease,severe mood swings_ HAIR LOSS_ weight gain of 20 lbs. in 3 months with no increased intake of food_ lethargic_ foggy_ eyesight strained_ nervous_ anxious.   My dr. placed me on Cytomel 25 mcg in combination with Synhroid 88 mcg.  I took this combination for three months_ and I felt like I was losing my life!!!    HAIR LOSS was very substantial!   Skin very dry!!I had been on Synthroid for 9 years prior to being placed on the combo of Cytomel & Synthroid.   After feeling so tired and exhausted_ plus depressed_ I went back to my doctor and explained how I felt.  He now has  me on Synthroid 1 mg.  As soon as I stopped taking Cytomel_ the perspiring went away.   I've started to lose a few pounds.  But_ my self esteem has beenseverly damaged by the weight gain and other side effects.     I want my life back!!!   I will NEVER take Cytomel again!  Never!,,F,53,3  months,4/30/2007,Cytomel

223, 4, Hypothyroid,I have been very happy with cytomel for the most part.  I have experienced increased heart rate_ palpitations_ excess sweating_ heat intolerance_ shaking legs and hands.  I was obliviously on to high of a does which I then lower and have been taking 85mgs for a few months now.  I did lose weight at first but now I cannot seem to lose a pound even with intense exercise.  The symptoms I mentioned earlier went away with the lower dose and the best thing of all and the reason I am satisfied so far with Cytomel is because I am having no fatigue.  I am so happy about that but I am concerned with the potential side effects like loss of muscle and potential burnout of my thyroid gland along with a heart muscle that could be affected. Has anyone out there been on this medicine most of their life that could help me with some of my questions?,,F,36,9  months,3/21/2007,Cytomel

233, 5, low T3,fatigue_ sad_ not able to drop weight.,I've been on synthroid for about 10 years and am up to .137 mcg.  T3 levels are low (40) so Dr. Prescribed 5mcg 3x/day.  It wasn't working at all so after a week I called the manufacturer and they told me the FDA recommends 25mcg - 75mcg daily in one dose.  I tried the 25mcg and immediately improved.  It's only been about 10 days since I've started but I'm better already and I think I still have to play around with the dosage.,F,42,10  days,4/18/2006Email,Cytomel

244, 5, fibromyalgia,Increased energy_ clearer thinking_ lost weight_ more positive mood_ and increased sexal interest. I slept better at night because it relieved the pain at my trigger points. Therefore I wasn't tired all day and no longer needed the afternoon cat nap. Additionally_ my hands and feet were no longer ice cubes; it relieved my cold intolerance and I was then able to do outdoor activities all year long. People thought I was depressed_ but I was just in constant pain. Cytomel removed the pain. Now I am more active and more outgoing which is the reason for the wieght loss. As well I have increased self esteem which has resulted in more sexual desire. As for side effects I only experience rapid heart rate at 125mcg and it stopped when I dropped back to 100mcg. In addition I do sweat more_ but I also work harder and play more vigorously. This medicine dosen't mask the pain_ it removes it.,Doctors try to scare patients with horrors of heart-attacks and preach on the dangers of Cytomel (T-3). People with fibromyalgia have recovered by taking high amounts of T-3 without the side effects of over-stimulation. (Visit drlowe.com for more information.) I was lucky I got help when I did because I couldn't live in that pain any longer and was planning suicide. I was rescued by a wonderful doctor that started me on Cytomel at 25mcg. He increased my dose gradually to 125mcg. I have stabled out on 100mcg daily for the last two years. Most doctors would say that 5mcg is the maximum dose for Cytomel. I disagree_ I would rather ignor their warnings than take all the pain killers and mind altering drugs they prescribe.,F,35,2  years,3/1/2004,Cytomel
