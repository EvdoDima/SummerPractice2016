0, 1, Joint pain,Helped with pain from the start. I took it at bedtime about 3-4 nights a week. About 3 weeks in_ I became ill- thought I had flu or food poisoning. I was dizzy_ sensitive to light_ and felt like I couldn't keep my eyes open. I felt like I could only close my eyes and lay in bed- hoping it would pass. I was sweaty_ flushed_ and had no appetite whatsoever. I had diarrhea as well.  I thought I was going to vomit every second. This went on for 2 days. 3rd day in I went to Dr. - hoping for anti emetic and relief. Dr. ordered a host of labs and did a thorough neuro exam. No answers- all labs normal. After going through everything myself to figure out what was wrong- I realized Ultram was newest RX. Read medical info- and clearly this was the issue and cause of my illness. Ugh!,I will never take Ultram ever again. What horrible side effects I experienced. Not to mention loss of work and family time. This RX should not be used lightly and without upfront discussion with Dr. and pharmacist. Research and discuss other options.,F,46,4  weeks50mg,8/12/2016,Ultram
1, 3, interstital cystitis pain,muscle stiffness_ joint pain. Feels like the worst case of Fibromyalgia!!! This is a rare side effect of the drug. I could not even squeeze a bottle of shampoo so had to get off the drug. I now have permanent damage from this drug .,Worked great for the burning pain of Interstital Cystitis . My body adapted and I found that I continually had to increase the dosage .,F,48,3  years200,6/18/2016Email,Ultram

4, 5, permanent neck & back injuries.,Mental energy..and verbal diarrhea lol I can't stop talking for like 2 hrs after taking it.

6, 4, cervical kyphosis and DDD,sweats,I increased the amount I take very slowly and have avoided most side effects.  I also take with food.  I'm now up to 2.5 50mg/day heading towards 3/day.  It helps the pain but doesn't remove it completely--I take it with ibuprofen.  My conditions are inoperable and worsening with age.  I can't believe I hesitated to take this because of the addictive qualities.  Not only am I never going to be able to go off of this_ even if I do have to some day_ I'll just taper off gradually.  I recently completed a 6 mo. withdrawal from gabapentin (2700 mg.) without having to miss any work.  If I can do that_ I can withdraw from this_ no problem.,F,58,3  months50mg 3X D,8/30/2015,Ultram

15, 5, back pain _arthritis,had to take the last dose 6 hrs before bed or had trouble getting to sleep,excellent pain med for moderate acute and chronic pain. I had no trouble quitting it when I was pain free. It does raise the norepinephrine level a bit giving an energy boost. I had also read it stimulates the immune system to an extent unlike opioids which suppress it,M,,30  years50mg 2X D,10/30/2014,Ultram
16, 5, Post surgical pain (cancer),The only bothersome side affect that I have is a very dry mouth.  I was on dilaudid 4mg every 4 hours for 6 months after my upper left lobectomy. The doctor wanted me off of it of course so switched me to tramadol. The scar on my back is 9 inches long and my muscles and nerves were cut so I will always have pain. The tramadol definitely takes away my pain and gives me a mental boost. If I forget a dose_ I really feel it in my back and my mood. I am cancer free today and very happy! Stage 3b lung cancer.  As far as withdrawal when I no longer need it_ I doubt I will ever come off if it.  If I'm addicted I feel it's ok because at least I'm able to live a good quality of life!!,,F,51,2  years100mg 4xd,7/2/2014,Ultram

18, 5, Severe chronic pain (Lupus_ FM),constipation_ increased sweating,This drug has been a miracle for me. It takes a while to kick in_ and I wished it would be more fast-acting. However_ it does take away the severe pain I have been living with for 5 years. Without Tramadol_ I wouldn't be able to function_ and now I can lead an - almost - normal life. If I have some breakthrough pain during the day_ Tylenol Arthritis takes care of it. Very rarely do I need to take 100mg at bedtime.The constipation is greatly relieved by taking two soft gels of Liquid Magnesium Oxide (important as Magnesium comes in different formulations/ only the oxide one helps; also works as a muscle relaxant) at night.,F,44,10  months150 1X D,5/26/2014,Ultram

21, 5, sciatica_arthritis,It makes me feel very alert but relaxed_kind of don't care feeling.It feels like I could go to sleep but I can't. I call it twilight sleep b/c when I try to sleep_ I am in and out every few minutes untill it wears off_ which it takes up to 18hours. Next day I have bad headache.,"I only take it as needed_ 30 pills last me easy one year.It does work like a magic and I like the feeling when on it.I have OCD and SPD so being on it makes me feel relaxed but very alert and ""aware"" and ""friendly"". One pill lasts up to 18 hours. I use to suffer from Migraines and it did help with the pain some_ however now without Migraines_ it gives mi headache the next day.My boyfriend on the other hand gets very sick and throws up. He has very bad Dermatitis but can't take it. I only take it when absolutely needed b/c I worry it might have bad effect on my heart long term plus I don't want to go on other pain pill like codeine b/c it makes me very sick.I know someone who takes it every day and it affects him the same way_ very relaxed feeling almost like antidepressant.This is the only pain pill that works for me very well.Few years ago I had abcessed tooth and took 2-100 pills every 3 hours and it killed the pain but I was VERY dizzy and could not drive.",M,52,12  years50-100 1X AN,1/13/2014Email,Ultram
22, 4, fibromyalgia,First noticed itching but that went away in time. I lost almost 30 pads and I was already thin due to ed.

No withdrawal symptoms from true opioids but this was awful. This drug should be taken off the market!,,F,31,5  months400,8/6/2013,Ultram
25, 5, chronic pain,none,I have to stand or walk most of the day at work and suffer from chronic pain in my feet.  Doctors have not agreed on a diagnosis_ from tendinitis_ or nerve damage_ to prolapse of bones or tissues.  This medication allows me to function almost normally when I need to.,F,61,6  months25 mg 2X D,8/3/2013,Ultram
26, 5, Lupus_ FM,none whatsoever,When my doctor prescribed this medication and I took it for the first time_ I couldn't believe how I had survived without it for so long. The pain in my joints and connective tissue can be excruciating and would normally force me to stay in bed all day. I now take 3x50mg tablets at 6:00am every morning_ and by 9:00am I am usually able to get up and get ready for work. Without Tramadol/Ultram I couldn't even lift my arms to take a shower. Wonder drug for me.,F,42,1  years150 1X D,7/13/2013,Ultram
27, 4, Lupus and Fibromyalgia pain,Hard to say exactly what symptoms are caused by Tramadol_ as I am on numerous meds_ but I do experience mild relief from sometimes MAJOR lupus pain. It does not make me confused_ sleepy_ or dizzy. Weight gain when I started this and 2 other meds_ but it doesn't seem that is common with Tramadol_ so I don't think it's the culprit. I sweat like a menopausal woman or chemo patient just by vacuuming. It may be the lupus_ but my doctor feels that it is the Tramadol causing it. Yuck.,I like this medication. For most people with mild to moderate pain_ this is a great choice. My lupus affects my joints and tendons_ and it often feels like someone is injecting battery acid into my joints_ so I'm on the high end of pain many days. It is not strong enough for all of my pain_ so I have a breakthrough pain med_ but it is a good daily medication_ and when I miss it_ I do not feel any side effects_ i.e. it is not addictive for me. The only downside is the sweats. Keep a handkerchief handy just in case. Also be careful not to take too many. It slows your breathing_ and can cause you to stop breathing in your sleep if you overdose.,F,38,1  years100 mg 4X D,7/2/2013Email,Ultram

29, 4, Headache caused by chemotherapy,Itching_ euphoric,I personally like this medication; it just dulls the pain_ doesn't really take it away but it's better than nothing and I like that I don't have to have a hard copy of the prescription. It did cause a lot of itching at first so I took it with Benadryl and then I started to get over the itching. It doesn't put me to sleep like some other pain meds and I stopped taking it a couple days ago (as chemo is over) and I don't feel any discomfort_ i.e. withdrawal. Maybe that will come later but for now_ I'm satisfied with the results and would take it again.,F,48,2  months50 2X D,5/31/2013Email,Ultram
30, 1, shoulder pain,I took one dose at bedtime and woke up in the middle of the night itching_ but it wasn't severe and I fell back asleep.  In the morning I was so dizzy and sleepy_ I had a hard time getting kids ready for school.  I was too dizzy to drive so someone else had to drive them to school.  I went back to sleep for 3 hours.  I remained dizzy the rest of the day with a slight headache and even took another nap.,This drug did NOT help my pain at all.  I will not take this drug again.,F,35,1  days50 mg 1X D,5/23/2013Email,Ultram
31, 5, Fibromyalgia pain_ chronic fatigue,Itching around my nose if I take a dose too close to bedtime. I use Lanacane to help relieve the itch.,Thank God for Tramadol! Without this med_ I'm curled into a little ball in my bed due to my fibro pain. It also gives me a little energy_ especially if I drink caffeinated tea during the day. Other than the itching_ NO side effects.Even though I've been taking it for 4 years_ it is still effective - so no tolerance build-up is happening so far. I ran out one time_ and I didn't feel withdrawal symptoms like I've experienced with some antidepressants and other pain killers - I was just back to feeling my normal_ unbearable pain. Remember that meds work differently for different people. I hope this med works for you like it did for me. -F.L.,F,56,4  years50 mg 8X D,3/25/2013Email,Ultram

33, 3, Recreational Uses for depression,While my body was getting used to it_ when I took 5_ i would sometimes vomit and my heart rate would get fast. I would also lose appetite and be fatigued.  Even after my body was used to it_ I would still have a loss of appetite and I would be tired.,It isn't addictive,M,16,4  months450mg 1X D,3/17/2013Email,Ultram
34, 5, Sciatica/Mild Depression,Dry mouth_ constipation_ severe difficulty waking up_ sexual dysfunction_ slight dizziness.,I have been taking Tramadol for 4 years_ and just recently attempted to wean myself off of the drug. HUGE mistake. While I did not have severe physical withdrawals (as my weaning process was lengthy) I still had mild fatigue_ a little weight gain_ and could feel myself falling deeper into depression everyday without the drug. This went on for a month. I finally went back to the doc_ and am now back on 50mg 2x daily. My depression went away after 2 weeks_ energy levels are back to normal_ the 5 pounds I gained is gone and my pain is in check. However_ the trade-off is dry mouth_ some constipation_ trouble experiencing orgasm_ low libido_ dizziness even when sitting_ and difficulty waking up in the morning. The latter is probably the worstI will hit snooze for an hour or two in the morningor just sleep right through without even hitting snooze or turning it off. Once_ my husband said he wanted to see how long I would let the alarm go; he clocked 42 minutes of the alarm blaring and me barely moving. I could only imagine how I'd be if I were to take the max dose of 400mg. To sum it up_ Tramadol works well for my pain and depression_ but now I wonder how in the world will I get through my next attempt at weaning off the drug.,F,35,4  years50mg 2X D,3/16/2013Email,Ultram
35, 2, Kidney Infection/Kidney Stones,Severe Muscle Twitches_ Anxiety_ Lack of Pain Control.,Didn't necessarily take pain away_ but 'disconnected' me from it (and most everything else). Second day started noticing mild muscle twitches in my eyelid and base of my thumb in my hand. This quickly progressed with 24 hours into a constant spasm of the hand muscle. Also_ found it very hard to urinate. Twitches eased off within 6 to 8 hours_ of single dose_ stopped taking for about 36 hours. Then took two for onset of severe kidney pain in the evening following day. Within two hours severe muscle twitches (all over) rapid heart rate_ restlessness_ shallow breathing_ jaw clenching_ unable to sleep_ minimal pain control_ nausea. I thought this must be a what a panic attack feels like. I have never had one_ before though. Called nurse and she made me feel like a child_ and didnt' have a clue as to why I would react like this way. Needless to say_ I discontinued use. It's a month and a half later_ and I am still noticing alot of random muscle twitches. Never again!.,F,33,4  days50mg 3X D,2/20/2013,Ultram
36, 5, Fibromyalgia,I have seen a lot of Ultram reviews about how addictive and difficult this med is_ but it worked well for me. When I stopped taking it_ it was no big deal. I didn't have any withdrawals_ sickness_ or anything else. As with any med_ you could be allergic to it. It is very effective for me. It does cause dry mouth!,,F,44,2  years300,2/19/2013,Ultram
37, 1, Fibromyalgia,I had seizers_ horrible headaches that made my face tingle_ severe sweating and so much more! I was hospitalized for a week in the ICU due to the seizures I was having as a side effect from this drug. And went through severe withdrawal when the hospital took me off of it. NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG! Horrible.,,F,17,2  months50 MG,2/15/2013Email,Ultram
38, 4, Back pain,Loss of appetite_ irritability_ anxious & jumpy,The medicine seems to help with the pain but I have no appetite...probably not a bad thing for me though.  The worst immediate side effects were severe irritability & jumpiness.....like I feel like I want to fight & can't get still.....like I could run a marathon or something.  It's a very weird feeling....not sure how long I'll take this stuff.,F,27,1  days30 mg 1X D,2/8/2013Email,Ultram
39, 1, back pain,suicide,My son (age 30) cannot speak for himself and I wonder how many other people have experienced what he did. Within 4-5 hours of taking Ultram for the first time_ he picked up a pistol and put a bullet through his brain. I am the caretaker of his memory_ so I'm putting his age and gender.,M,30,1  times50 mg 4X D,2/8/2013Email,Ultram
40, 1, Kidney Infection,Some itching on the skin.  But more than anything: persistent & intensely severe headaches (felt like my entire skull was being hammered over and over).  Even the bones on my face ached with pain.  This drug pained my sinus cavities and caused me to have uncontrollably runny nose out of the blue.  Could barely open my eyes because I was too exhausted from the pain_ but couldn't even fall asleep because the drug kept me awake.  So I just lie awake with the pain_ or pace around like a lunatic until I became too weak to stand up.  Tramadrol drove me to the point of insanity.  I even resorted to banging my head against the wall to give minor relief to the unbearable headaches.  Couldn't focus on anything else because the headache was constant and extreme_ unlike any other headaches I've ever had. In fact_ I would rather much go through childbirth than have the headaches from Tramadol.,I quit after 3 days.  Yes_ it concealed my kidney pain_ but it caused me even more pain than that.  It was a nightmare I never want to go through again.  Felt like hell.  Funny thing was_ I called the doctor's office and the nurse acted surprised and said that Tramadol does not cause headaches.  Look at the Rx warnings_ moron!  It says to call my doctor ASAP if I get severe & persistent headaches!,F,32,3  days50 4X D,2/3/2013Email,Ultram

42, 5, Significant Back Pain,After pill wore off (about six hours) experienced headache_ slight nauseous_ and very sleepy and tired - needed nap and I never nap. Thought this was perhaps co-incidence the first day. Symptoms repeated on the second day- Also became a bit sweaty and nauseous in the car - a sip of soda and some crackers seemed to help - not serious. I think it is withdrawal symptom when drug wears off.,If I can get adequate relief from heating pad and tylenols_ I won't take it again. I can never take NSAIDS like Motrin or Advil - they might work - but I develop hemorrhagic coliis even after one dose of them. The Ultram_ fortunately_ did not cause this. My GI doctor said it was OK to take - although he thought the orthopod should have prescribed a muscle relaxer like Flexeril instead of this.,F,60,2  days50 mg 1X D,12/8/2012,Ultram

48, 4, Fibromyalgia Pain Control,No side effect for me at all.,The only bad thing is that I am about to be moved up to a much stronger drug for pain management because it no longer does the job. But if you are in need of pain relief and haven't had Fibromyalgia for 20 years like I have when no one had ever head of this sydrome and those who had wasn't for sure it was for real. It will take the edge off but be aware.....nothing will take away all the pain ever in my experience and I have been on so many different medication over the years and up to 8 at one time. I have cut back on almost everything and try my best to live each day dealing with the pain but it does get very depressing but I elected not to stay on anti-depressant for long periods. WARNING: DO NOT allow any doctor to put you on any BENZOS (klonopin_ ativan_ xanax_ valium_ etc) these are diabolical drugs and I learned the hard way what they do to you and how dependent your brain become on them and how long it takes to recover. I feel like they stole 10 years of my life and didn't realize I had changed so much. Google Benzo withdrawal and  go to you tube and you will never do allow a doctor to put you own these. When I was given BENZOs was prior to the internet so the info was not available but the doctors knew back then how bad these drugs were because they have been around since the 1950's and 60's. They lie. Don't lose your life to the Benzos. If you need help with Benzo withdrawal you may email me and I will support you.,F,47,8  years100 mg 3X D,9/7/2012Email,Ultram

I recommend it for occasional severe pain_ since it is habit forming and you can quickly build up a tolerance for it_ and withdrawal symptoms are inevitable if you take more than a few doses in a row. When taken as I do_ though_ it is effective at making the worst pain of endometriosis more bearable. If I take it continuously_ though_ my body doesn't get a chance to re-regulate my digestive system and the constipation/diarrhea from withdrawal makes everything worse.

I wish I'd found this site before I just took my last dose of Ultram/Tramadol half an hour ago. I was given Tramadol four times a day at 40mg starting the day after my caesarean section for routine pain relief. Initially I was happy that it worked to control the pain_ and I was okay with the fact that I was also feeling extremely dizzy- I thought it might have been due to the operation that I couldn't walk ten steps without having to grab at a wall for support. After four days of increasing dizziness and nausea_ I took a dose later than usual (after midnight)_ and for the first time I noticed that my pulse had dropped to around 50 beats per minute. I was trying to sleep while my new baby was sleeping_ but I began to get the awful sense that my breaths were way too far apart as I was dozing off- like I was going to pass out rather than go to sleep. The breaths I could catch felt too shallow to do much. I lay there in an anxious sweat for a couple of hours before calling the nurse_ who told me that panic/ anxiety attacks were a common side effect of Tramadol_ an that's probably what I was feeling. Definitely true to an extent- my calf muscles were twitching in a really strange way_ and in the end I was awake the entire night feeling paranoid about DVT. Anyway! At that point she told me to take only one tablet next time_ but I didn't take any for a couple of days. My dizziness continued just as strongly the whole time_ to the point,F,30,4  days20-40 4X D,2/13/2012,Ultram

I took ONE pill and 20min later i felt extremely weak and tired so I laid down then started to feel nauseas which got worse by the minute. Then my heart started racing soi guess it was a panic attack. I did not feel real_ i couldnt see straight_ had very loose foul stools about 5x a day. This medication totally messed with my brain it was CRAZY and the the most scariest thing i had ever experiened in my life. The symptoms continued for weeks. I literally could not eat solid food for almost 3 weeks_ i lost 35lbs_ had racing thoughts_ insomnia_ sick twisted nightmares and the list just goes on...It is now almost 5months after that experience and i am not the same person i was before taking this drug. I suffer from extreme Anxiety and occasional panic 24/7 with many many physical symptoms like chest pain_ difficulty breathing_ heart palpatations_ etc.  I am seeing a Theralist and taking Xanax for the extreme Anxiety (as needed)  as a   result of this. How the heck one pill of this Ultram could do this_ i dont know! But it is true and it has ruined my life for right now. I did google this drug and i think it said that it affects the brain in a similar way that Anti-depressants do so I honestly believe it f@#ked my brain chemistry up. I am also sensitive to Meds so if you are_ think twice_ this is a powerful drug! If anyone had a similar experience to mine from this drug_ PLEASE Email me,F,24,1  days 1X D,1/26/2012Email,Ultram

Besides the opioid qualities_ ultram is also like an antidepressant.  I've been feeling like crap for a month.  The 10mcg Butrans patch didn't even help me get over the ultram.

Reading about this online has led me to feel that increasing the dosage to deal with the pain will only lead to more dependence. I am hoping to find something to add to or replace this drug. The muscle cramps associated with withdrawl are most significant problems.

I'm finding that it really does help calm me from effects of ADHD enough to focus and write as I am a writer. It helps me accomplish things much more methodically/organized than usual_ and then sleep well at night.

Why does this stuff put everyone else asleep but gives me energy and makes me feel great!,I started taking Ultram/Tremadol about a year and  a half ago when a friend let me try 2 of hers because and it gave her energy. Well lets just say that's all it took for me_ I was hooked!  Now i've been ordering them on-line (no prescription) since and I can't function without them. The ultram really makes me feel so good_ i'm finally awake_ focused_ my metabolism is faster_ happy_ positive_ i could keep going.  However with out it_ i'm the complete opposite.  I've recently gone to the doc to try and get off of it in fear of it harming me long term. He prescribed Nuvigil for the chronic fatigue_ that did nothing to stimulate my mind_ just made my heart race.  I've tried red bull_ 5 hr energy drinks_ of course coffee and nothing works like the ultram does_ they just don't stimulate my mind.  Does anyone else have this reaction? doc told me only 3% of population has opposite reactions like this.  Guess I'll keep taking it and just have to rely on it_ don't want to stop and don't want to suffer the withdraws i've read they are horrible.,F,26,1  years50 mg 6X D,3/4/2011Email,Ultram
101, 4, Fibromyalgia,Dry mouth_ nausea_ not sure if euphoria would be the word since there is no feeling of joy with it_ but I can't think of another word to describe it_ also antihistamine (?), I actually started taking Ultram (Tramadol) twice. The first bottle I only took one or two and then stopped because of the dizziness and nausea. (I don't take any meds unless I am absolutely convinced the benefits outweigh the trouble.) Then a few months later_ I tried again and found that it made a significant difference in how long I can sleep before waking up from pain. (5 or 6 hours as opposed to 2 hours) The odd thing is that I'm now allergic to my cat. (?) I found by coincidence that within an hour of taking Tramadol_ the sneezing_ coughing_ watery eyes_ etc. clears up and I'm fine. I'm wondering if the allergy developed because of the Tramadol_ OR if it simply coincided with initiating the drug and the drug has this nice antihistamine side benefit? I have determined that if my current dosage is not enough_ I will not up the dosage. It will have to be good enough_ or I won't take it.,F,50,1  years50 MG 3X D,1/29/2011EmailHistory,Ultram

104, 1, Depression & Anxiety,severe constipation_ sexual dysfunction_ prolonged sleep(12-14hrs),Tramadol is a unique drug.  While it is technically not a narcotic_ it  does have narcotic effects by acting on Mu opioid receptors.  It also is a SNRI (similar to effexor)in the way it increases serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition.  Tramadol is not a controlled substance and is often said to have a low potential for abuse and addiction.  It helped me significantly for depression and anxiety but I quickly built up a tolerance and had to up the dosage and it eventually quit working. I have experienced horrendous withdrawals from it (for a week now...and it's still not over)_ both of the opiate type and SNRI discontinuation.  I have been through withdrawal syndromes from the strongest opiate narcotics in existence (including heroin) and tramadol withdrawal is almost as bad and longer lasting as well.  I'm not a health professional of any kind...I just want to warn people that tramadol is very addictive and carries a severe withdrawal syndrome making it extremely difficult to get off of.  Avoid it if you can.,M,23,1  years 3X D,1/2/2011,Ultram

Ultram can almost completely remove my pain for a few hours.  Because my problem is 2 fold_ I also take Neurontin for the nerve damage.  Combining Ultram & Neurontin has changed my life for the better; so far.  I was as good as dead before; could not get pain off my mind.  I've learned that you really need to take as little as possible with any pain med. Tolerance is always a problem.  The rewards can be great_ but be very careful with any drug; paying attention to every change your body experiences_ at the same time don't think about your problems all the time_ they will be made worse from it.

After on 1 week in detox everything was fine_ But week two seamed to be bad as I began to retain Fluid's horribly badly. The Adema began in my legs and in my Abdomen.

125, 5, Chronic hip/lower back pain,Constipation the first month but my body now seems to have adapted. Slight euphoria_ nothing like Vicodin 5/500 though.  Sexual side-effects have been my biggest complaint.  I have a noticeable decrease in sex drive and it takes longer for me to reach orgasm.  With the immediate release form I can time the inability to reach orgasm to a period that starts one hour after taking the med to ~5 hours after.   It's annoying but living with the pain is MUCH MUCH worse.   So far no tolerance to the medication (~4 months of daily use).,Prior to Ultram I was taking Vicodin 5/500 as needed.  I find that Tramadol works better than Vicodin for me.  It has been a life saver and I seem to be tolerating it well with no (or at least no noticeable) tolerance.  I was initially started on 200mg Ultram ER per day_ but my insurance would not pay for the ER formulation so I am on 50mg four times per day.    I occasionally will need to pop a half 50mg pill durring the day for break-through pain_ very rare do I need to do so (so fare ~ once per month).  Also_ taking 500mg of Tylenol every six hours seems to increase the pain killing power sometimes.    I initially had constipation but that quickly subsided.  The biggest downer for me has been sexual side effects!!!  My sex drive has taken a nose dive since taking this med...and when I engage in sex it takes me a while to orgasm (I think this is due to the SSRI component of this drug).   That said_ I am willing to live with this because my chronic pain has been under control for the first time in my life.  Prior to Ultram I was using Vicodin_ which has its own bag of troubles.  I recently moved to a new state...and convincing my doctor to prescribe Vicodin for my pain management was a HUGE problem (even with letters from my previous doctors).  Seems like many doctors just don't want to hassle with Opiates these days.  Anyhow_ I am 100% satisfied with Ultram...crossing my fingers I don't build up tolerance.

At first gave me happy euphoria effect where it made me feel warm and tingly_ but now just takes the edge off.  Like a cup of coffee (perk up) and a couple of sips of wine (life's good). Can make me a little chatty cause it makes me happy and makes the pain bearable.  I think would be good for depression as someone else stated.

There is no one ""MIRACLE CURE"" for any of us with chronic pain.  You need to take responsibility to find your own individual plan.  I work full-time and have an active life because I choose it.

But the worst thing for m I guess it that the pain never really goes away it is just more dull.,When I went back to the dr. for a refill she wouldnt give me the tramadol anymore she said there is a 'better' drug for fibro pain now!

158, 2, fractured ribs,sever insomnia_ weird/ uncomfortable feeling of being hollow or weightlessness (hard to describe)_ not wanting to sit or stand (felt less odd when lying down)_ inability to achieve orgasm,This medicine did NOT agree with my system.  I would try to go to sleep_ but it didn't really happen for like three days.  I would just lie in bed with my eyes closed praying to fall asleep. Then_ of course_ the next thing I knew the sun was coming up.  I would be wide awake in bed and throughout the day all I wanted to do was lie down to keep from feeling like I wasn't in my own body.  I quit taking Ultram after I realized I wasn't able to orgasm.  I tried doing so in efforts to fall asleep_ which usually worked well.  HA  So it was either A. suffer from the crappy side effects of Ultram or B. suffer from the pain of 3 fractured ribs.  I opted for option C. and went back to my doctor and told him what he gave me wasn't working.  So_ I got my prescription for Lortabs and lived comfortably for the next few weeks until my ribs healed.  As long as you don't have an addictive personality_ they are a God send.  Ultram SUCKS.,M,27,3.5  days,1/9/2010,Ultram
159, 4, Chronic back pain,The worst side effect is the inability to orgasm with any dose.,I am surprised there are so few comments about sexual problems with this drug. Am I alone or are others just hesitant to admit it?  As a pain killer it is good.  It doesn't produce a high and doesn't totally relieve the pain but it alows life to go on.  Rather than increase the dose I sometimes need 50 mg of demerol in the evening to reduce the pain enough to sleep with a mild sleep aid. The only real side effect for me in going off this drug for about a week was a return of my pain. The sexual complaint was gone but I was miserable with the pain. I would like to know if others have the problem I have mentioned and what they do about it.,M,63,3  years,1/6/2010Email,Ultram
160, 4, chronic back pain_ fibromyalga,When taken in doses exceeding recommended dose I experience some hesitancy in speech.,"I have used this drug for over ten years. I took it to get off of taking daily narcotics. To that degree it worked OK. I experience no ""high"" from the drug and never did. It does cause some constipation. My problem is that it no longer keeps me mobile unless I take huge quantities (500 mg). If I take 10 pills before I leave my home I can sometimes keep up with my husband in the shopping mall or grocery store. Just spent two months in Europe doing all the tourist things_ only about five times more slowly. On days when I do not expect to be physically active I do not take Ultram at all. I experience no withdrawal. I generally try to manage on 800 mg of Motrin and save Ultram for times I need to be active with my family. Have no idea what this abusive behavior of this drug may be doing to me_ but it keeps my marriage and family working.",F,65,12  years,1/3/2010,Ultram
161, 3, taking for 4 buldging disks,euphoric feeling didnt get a tolerance as fast as any other pain medications (vicodin norco even percocet) it seemed to last alot longer but be less intense.,tramadol is a great drug i have been on it for 3 years now. i was involved in a car accident leaving me with 4 buldging disks and a pinched nerve. taken at a 150 mg does 3 50mg tabs would help the pain. the reason why you feel high when you take these is because of the reuptake in serotonin and dopamine. these are your happy chemicals in your brain. actually ppl with adhd and add get benifet. like many adhd pills like riddlin if effects the dopamine nuerotransmitter in the brain. although tramadol does not effect dopamine as much as ritalin or adderal.. this can put you in a steady positive and also energizing mood for hours .  the pain might be there but its a mood boosting drug.  it has helped me live more comfortable in my life and doesnt containe any acetiminophen.  i dont wanna ulcer this is a good drug! better for you than any narcotic.,M,19,3  years,12/26/2009Email,Ultram

164, 4, off label for anxiety & depression,CONSTIPATION_ DIZZINESS_ insomnia_ confusion_ difficulty urinating_ sexual side effects.,Tramadol is a really good medicine for anxiety and depression.  SSRI's never worked for me_ but tramadol is great.  It has side effects buy they are bearable.  Constipation has been the most bothersome side effect_ but taking fiber/stool softener helps.  I also suffer from frequent lower back pain and tramadol is an excellent pain reliever.  Tramadol has really increased my energy as well.  More doctors should be prescribing this med for depression and anxiety because traditional anti-depressants don't work for a lot of people.  The first few weeks in taking tramadol_ it made me feel very euphoric_ but that faded to a degree.  There is a withdrawal syndrome in abruptly stopping tramadol.  It is an opiate type withdrawal_ but other withdrawal symptoms similar to stopping an SSRI are also present because of tramadols effects on serotonin and norepinephrine.  However_ it is a relatively mild withdrawal.  Though Tramadol has a similar mechanism to narcotic analgesics_ it is not a narcotic and not a controlled substance and is available with a regular Rx.

How this stays on the market is a mystery to me and it should be a scheduled drug for sure.  Good luck to everyone.,F,43,2  days,7/21/2009,Ultram
195, 4, degenerative cervical disc disease,an added benefit of a reduction in depression and more energy.,Cannot take any NSAIDs due to stomach upset/ulcers. Tylenol alone does nothing_ and celebrex costs a fortune and did almost nothing. Tramadol_ 50mg with 2 tylenol_ twice a day_ helps the pain. FDA says you should not take more than 8 - 500mg tylenol a day_ so make sure other medication doesn't contain tylenol (acetaminophen). I don't know if there will be withdrawal when I stop taking tramadol. I think I'm on a low_ effective dose.,M,58,1  years,7/19/2009,Ultram
196, 5, hip fracture injury,headache_ dizziness_ constipation_ excessive thirst,A co-worker first introduced me to tramadol six months ago. At the time I only took it once a day and it helped alot for relieving my hip pain and it helped me work faster and was friendlier to customers. Over time it only relieved pain for 1-2 hours_ or didn't work at all_ depending on the severity. When she moved and I was no longer given tramadol_ I had a bout of depression and insecurity. I thought it was from PMS_ but now reading these ratings I realize it was partly me coming off the dependance of tramadol. I found a doctor and told him of my 20yr ago hip injury in a car accident. He prescribed 50mg 4X daily. I took it as prescribed and it worked great the first dose but any doses after that it gave me a headache and at the end of the day I was dizzy and sleepy.  I cut back to 3X a day. If I sit still it makes me sleepy. After 3 wks it lost it's effectiveness so I'm 1 and half pill at a time_ or in severe pain 2 at a time. I take 4-6 fiber pills (generic metamucil) before bedtime_ and drink lots of water. I love the energy_ confidence boosting_ and weight loss it has provided me. I don't care about the dependance_ I'll be sure to make appointments with the doctor in advance to avoid withdrawal. Maybe he will up the dosage. It affects everyone differently. It makes my hubby sick to his stomach.,F,31,6  months,7/17/2009Email,Ultram

I've had less pain and a great perk is that I'm more social than I was before and have a lot more patience. I have four teenagers and found that this helps me deal with everyday life better_ which is a good thing for everyone in my household:-) I'm sad to hear of those that are addicted..they should have stuck with the dose the doc prescribed. They really do know what's best for you. I just hope that if someone is experiencing pain they should read the more positive reviews and a least give it a try. Everyone reacts differently.

201, 3, Sore Back / Migraine,Slight euphoria_ sleepiness_ sweats_ difficulty in urination_ pleasant side effect of loss of appetite which equals about a 10 pound weight loss,OK....I first was given Tramadol in Ireland for a hurt back.  I have now_ somewhat ashamed to say_ been on and off it for five months.  It is PHYSICALLY ADDICTIVE.  I have had to non-voluntarily de-tox off it once when I ran out...and boy...it was awfull.  Terrible feelings of extreme nauseau_ insomnia (five days with less than 3 hours total of sleep)_ restless legs_ chills_ body aches_ vomitting and terrible headaches.  You turn into bascially a Zombie for a week or so... unable to lie down and rest and unable to focus on anything.  I was too ashamed to go to a doctor and would of paid $100 a pill if I could of.  Then my delivery came and I proceeded to go back on it due to a four day migraine_ back up to 400mgs to 600mgs a day.  Now I am in week one of my planned 5 week VERY SLOW detox.  I am sure this drug has value when taken in a low dose as recommended_ but abuse due to the euphoric feeling that exsists only when you first take it can easily escalate.  If you have a history of addiction I would try my best to avoid it.,F,44,5  months,7/3/2009Email,Ultram
202, 3, Possible RA or Lupus,None.,I get horrible pain in my hands_ arms_ shoulders and legs.  To the point where typing_ driving a car or even moving becomes nearly impossible.  Laying in a bed can even suck.  The doctors don't really know what it is_ but suspect something autoimmune.  I was on all kinds of NSAIDS and the more traditional OTC painkills_ but those didn't do squat.  During my most difficult months I was taking an Ultram ER 100mg twice a day with intermittent dosing of 50mg of the regular Ultram when needed thoughout the day.  It really helped take the edge off.  I saw the best benefit over a period of a couple of days_ but I never really got immediate relief from it when I'd take it.  I haven't had to take it in a while now as I'm feeling better than I had.  No withdrawl symptoms.  It just didn't feel like that strong of a drug_ I still had some pain while taking it and as there were no side effects for me it didn't feel like it was doing too much (which can be a good thing).,F,25,9  months,6/29/2009,Ultram

204, 5, moderate pain,Dependence_ constipation_ nausea (rare)_ euphoria_ dry mouth_ insomnia (rare)_ drowsiness (rare),Been taking this drug since I was 15 for moderate pain. I was first treated with NSAIDs_ but could not tolerate side-effects. Tramadol was introduced to me and brought relief immediately. Not only does tramadol alleviate levels of pain it also seems to work well for depression. This must be due to it's SNRI properties. The only bad thing about this drug is_ when used for extended periods_ can cause dependence. Withdrawal from tramadol is extremely unpleasant and some literature points out that tramadol withdrawal is more severe than with opioids such as hydrocodone. Same source says that slowly lowering your tramadol dose under supervision of a doctor can mitigate withdrawal. You should not suddenly stop this medication. Withdrawal symptoms mimic typical symptoms from other opioids and has some of it's own_ including severe depression.,M,21,6  years,6/14/2009,Ultram

However_ it totally screwed up my ability to focus my eyes. Was driving on a long distance trip one day and had to stop and pull over as could NOT make my eyes focus. Had no idea it was this med until I spoke w/ the pharmacist. I also used to get migraine auras (flashing lights in eyes) w. no migraine. All this stopped when I went off the med.

210, 4, Herniated L5-S1 and damaged L5,I have been on Tramadol for 2 years. Someone seeking information on it should know:1. It is not just a painkiller (opioid analgesic)_ it is also an SNRI - which causes the psychotropic effects (happy_ good mood_ etc) patients talk about.2. You will likely build up tolerance quickly_ causing you to take more than prescribed.3. IT IS VERY ADDICTIVE. Unlike reports that it is less addictive than Vicodin_ it is way more addictive. I am on both - I can do without Vicodin_ not Tramadol.4. Getting off the drug is hell. It takes a while and you need a gradual down dosing and a lot of space around you as you want to strangle people and you want to jump out your skin when you try to sleep. 5. It seems to seriously affect your eyesight at high doses as well as ear ringing.,It does help the pain - it has been effective in that manner. It is also a great mood stabilizer. But proceed with caution. Only take this if you must and for chronic pain - go with Vicodin or Norco (less Acetaminophen) for short acute pain problems.,M,40,2  years,6/1/2009,Ultram

I felt less pain_ more relaxed_ and overall in a way better mood.  I'm usually pretty cranky with my depression but these pills make me very patient and kind to others lol. My libido is also through the roof_ so that's good! I was using them for pain assoicated with my Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome.  I find them to work just as well as some narcotics.  The main complaint I have is with my eyes.  I have a twitch under my left eye now that lasts for weeks after stopping the pills.  My vision has also seemed to be permanently damaged from just a short time of taking the pills.  I now need glasses---i don't think it's a coincidence!,M,27,2  months,5/13/2009,Ultram

It does make me a little drowsy and I suffer from Insomnia and Anxiety but I have meds for those issues. I need it to STOP THE CHRONIC AND SEVERE PAIN. I can't barely walk on most days and my knees swell up and my hips feel like they are on fire from the arthritis. I walked hunched over b/c I can't strighten up b/c of the pain. I am 51 and feel like I am 81. The arthritis has deeply affected my life_ I do not go anywhere_ I have no social life and I am depressed. So this medication does nothing for me. I take 50 mg occassionally praying it will help. I just want some sort of relief. I am supposed to take 2xs daily but I do not. This is the second time I have been prescribed this medication and it did not help me then either. I love Celebrex however am not able to get it any longer. Insurance doesn't pay for it and my doctor no longer gets samples to give me. It was my miracle drug. I wish I could afford it at $150.00 per 30 with my bootleg health insurance from the State of Georgia.

219, 1, interstitial cystitis(bladder pain),depression_ uncontrollable emotions_ morning headaches_ extreme difficulty waking,If you go off this drug_ you really should consider seeing a doctor to take something like Ativan for at least the first week to help in case of extreme anxiety and insomnia.  Tramadol affects your serotonin (see Tramadol entry on Wikipedia) and can cause severe depression upon withdrawal like you've never imagined before.  I was a wreck and would not have gotten through it without my family's support.Initially tramadol 100 mg 1/day helped immensely with my kidney and bladder pain and frequency.  After several months_ I began to become extremely emotional when the drug would wear off.  I had to go off the drug entirely and went through at least a week of severe depression_ hysteria_ and anxiety.  I tried Ultram ER 200 mg at the suggestion of my doctor_ and I had moderate depression and spontaneous crying during the six months I took it.  Eventually I had to go off it_ and had the same horrible symptoms again.  This time they lasted longer and I had to go on Lexapro for depression_ which I am just getting off of three months later.

Today i took 5 tramadol in a 10 hour period at work instead of the usual 2 lortab doses because i left them at home. Trams lasted way longer than lortabs do. I felt no withdrawal since ultram is a synthetic opiate/opioid. Its great with coffee too. Very SPEEDY.  Took the pain away! I think i'll keep the lortab for bedtime since it makes me drowsy and keep the trams for daytime.  If your looking for a high_ you probably won't like these but if you need pain relief these may help. I also take with 1-2mg zanaflex.  Together they blew lortab away!

The slight palpitation happens very seldom and goes away after a few minutes.

228, 1, Chronic Lower Back Pain,This is a worthless and harmful drug. If you are replacing an opiod such as hydrocodone as I did (to get away from the side effects of narcotics)_go back to the narcotics as soon as possible. The worst side-effects have been a constant ringing in the ears_ loss of hearing_ inability to have emotions_ memory loss and sexual impotence... I've been off of it for three days now and my ears are still ringing. I've also had major memory loss_ bad dreams and my emotional state has been a blank slate. Do NOT take this drug. This is a truely evil chemical that has not been properly tested. If you take this_ you are a lab-rat!,DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. It does nothing for pain if you have a chronic condition and have been using standard opiods such as hydrocodone for more than a few months. This is also very hard to stop taking. I only used it for a few weeks and the withdrawl symtoms are 10 times worse than anything. Read the other comments and avoid addiction; this is harder to kick than major narcotics even if you have been using the prescribed dosage -- don't bother exceeding the 200mg per day either because it won't help. This stuff should be taken off the market. I'm sure it won't be long. I switched-back to hydrocodone 10mg 3x a day and it's just starting to work after three days.

I have almost no pain and several other benefits as well: for me it has amazing anti-depressant properties_ and like someone else said none of the intoxication effect like with narcotics. I read someone on here said it was an opiate: IT IS NOT. It acts on the brain in a similar way to opiates but it is not one.

237, 1, trigeminal neuralgia,insomnia; brain fog; fatigue all symptoms much worse in withdrawal plus anxiety; heart palpitations & orthostatic intolerance_ (wild fluctuations in blood pressure).,There are obviously some people who have biochemistry that is more suited for this drug.  However_ it is an opioid_ (a synthetic drug that acts on opiate receptors).  Tolerance is a physical inevitability with opiates_ no matter how strong minded you are.  To all you hard opiate toughies_ there are no end of long term heroin_ percs & vic users on the Medhelp addiction forum who say that tramadol is harder to detox from than any of the harder opiates. Plenty of people_ including me say that their original pain is better or certainly no worse once they stop taking it.  I never took more than 100mg per day & it took me so long to stop once I realised it was the cause of my problems because I couldn't handle the withdrawals.  If it works for you_ great_ just realise that in long term use tramadol has most of the side effects of other opiates.  More States are now scheduling it because of this evidence.,F,47,5  years,1/29/2009,Ultram
238, 1, arthritis,Extreme lack of concentration. Confused and unable to make the simplest of decisions. Nervousness. Memory loss.,After a couple of years the side effects were so bad I almost could not function. I had tried to stop before and the withdrawal was so bad I was suicidal. Had to start taking them again. Started tapering off about 2 months ago from 4 a day to 3 and so on. For the last couple of weeks I have been taking 1/2 twice a day. Have not had any in a day and a half and no withdrawal! I have to find another remedy for pain but I'm glad to be almost free of this awful drug. Don't let your doctor tell you they are not addictive.  They are physically if not psychologically addictive. My mind is almost back to normal. This has been easier that I thought it would be. Just go slow. Not cold turkey.,F,53,2  years,1/24/2009,Ultram

I am concerned about withdrawal and the psychological effects of the drug- the confusion and forgetfulness. Another post mentioned this drug has helped with depression_ my experience could lead me to believe this is true.

Weightloss.,I am so pleased with tramadol. It works wonders for my bone and muscle pain. I take it right when i wake up and it works pretty much all day. The only thing that I find negetive about the drug is that it does not go well with most other prescription drugs. You have to be very careful what you take with tramadol- for the side effects could be very bad. OH and withdrawls from this drug are the WORST!!,F,29,4  months,1/19/2009,Ultram
242, 4, Pinched nerve and carpal tunnel,Insomnia_ a bit of an elevated mood_ sweating_ teeth clenching_ constipation_ dry mouth,"I like Ultram because_ unlike other pain killers_ it does not make me feel ""out of myself.""  I don't like being constipated_ sweating_ clenching my teeth_ or dry mouth_ but I can deal with it because it eases the pain without making me feel drugged-up.  The constipation is helped by increased fluid and eating more fiber (cheerios help a great deal).  The worst side effect for me is insomnia.  I go for days where the only sleep I get is two or three hours at night.  This is mostly alleviated when I take it only in the morning or early afternoon.  If my pain is bad and I take it at night_ the pain is relieved_ but I'm up all night long.  It's a trade-off I'm willing to endure because it is an effective treatment for me.",F,47,4  months,1/13/2009,Ultram
243, 5, Herniated discs_ arthritis_ fibrom.,Mild constipation,For me this is one of the best prescription pain medicines out there.  After reading some of the comments I was concerned (or more like scared) about withdrawals when stopping. I have been taking 50  150 mg per day for some time. I usually take it every other day unless things are too bad. Last week I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped for a week. Well_ there was a day I didnt feel to great. That was it! Of course the pain I take it for came back. But I did not experience any of the horrible withdrawals described. So in my opinion_ this seems to work different for everyone. For the people who want if off the market_ please know that there are people out here who really need it.,F,46,4  years,1/12/2009,Ultram
244, 4, herniated disks in neck,In the beginning_ severe nausea and constant vomiting every time I took it_ but that wore off after a few weeks. Also_ intense itching all over_ especially the legs. This side effect also wore off after a time.  Constipation is also a problem but I just counter it by taking Ex-Lax.,Despite the side effects_ it soes work well to get rid of pain and_ importantly_ it lasts for a long time.  I have been on Vicodin_ Percocet and others_ but Ultram works the best so far.,F,38,1  years,1/8/2009,Ultram
245, 5, TMD_ ARTHRITIS,some cotton mouth_ most side effects will be from my impatience with waiting to take my next dose on breakthrough pain days and overlapping dosage a bit_ other than that all other side effects are manageable. And by my opinion much less than most prescription drugs these days.,I started taking tramadol/ultram about 3 years ago. I have a jaw malformation that resulted in tmd. As I've gotten older the pain from this has become unbearable. About a year ago I was also diagnosed with arthritis that mainly affects my jaw area_ my hands and also my hips. Ultram is the only pain reliever that has worked for me. I am a very healthy_ active_ intelligent young woman who is the mother of two. The last thing I need on top of this struggle with chronic pain and maintaining a normal lifestyle would be a drug problem. I've tried everything. Ultram is the only thing that works for me. I've researched and read all the horror stories. I believe that everyone's experience differs_ as I've read some people cannot sleep while taking this drug_ and I'll sleep like a baby on it. I do believe there is a risk of addiction. But you have to be disciplined. Do not continue to increase dosage on your own because you think it will work better_ it won't. You will only give yourself a page,F,28,3  years,1/7/2009,Ultram
246, 3, arthritis,totally stoned feeling_ nausea starting several hours AFTER I took the pills_ extreme dizziness_ lack of concentration_ affecting my vision.,I cannot say that this medication is relieving the pain_ but it getting me so stoned I dont care about the pain.  I take this in combination with Lyrica_ and I believe the combination is why I am dizzy to the point of falling.  I call them my drunk pills_ because I feel totally sh**-faced drunk when I take them.  After reading about all the side effects of both of these meds_ I am scared to continue taking them_ but also scared to stop them.,F,47,3  weeks,1/4/2009,Ultram
247, 5, Pinched Nerve In Neck,None_ I rarely have any side effects to drugs because I don't dwell on them like many people on this board do,Addiction?  Please! This drug is a non narcotic_ listed in the same category as Excedrin and Tylenol.  I'm not doubting that it doesn't have the potential for abuse (everything can be abused)  I found the overall pain reduction fair to good,F,45,2  months,1/2/2009,Ultram
248, 4, neck injury; PCOS;myofacial pain,"There is a definite ""high""... mild constipation. Not one to jump off of.",I've been on this medicine for almost ten years. In reading the posts it's clear this drug has vast potential for good and evil_ depending on each person's chemical make-up. Advice: start out slowly and see what happens_ if this is suggested. Has always helped me with the pain_ no doubt.,F,33,9.5  years,1/2/2009,Ultram

Makes me chatty_ which is great for an introvert who wished to be more extroverted.On the bad side:  Unfortunately_ mild-moderate withdrawal symptoms are a reality for 2-3 days.  If you take too much to get rid of a headache you may end up very dizzy and sick.  Itchiness for the first week or so.,"I've dealt with depression for quite some time.  After having it prescribed for migraines_ I realized its anti-depressant qualities.  At this point_ it seems like the only drug that has ever been able to pull me out of my shell.  Of the 5 years I've been taking it there have been multiple 6-10 month gaps where I didn't take any.  During each interval my depression returned and did not subside.  For those of you who may believe this drug causes depression I hope that you seek psychiatric help.  In my experience_ the depression is not caused by Tramadol...it is simply more apparent when you stop taking it.  Most people ease out of depression while taking an anti-depressant and return with a vengeance when they stop.  Only to ease out of it when trying a new medication.  Overall_ this is my ""good responder"" drug and it scares me to think most physicians refuse to accept its anti-depressant qualities.",M,21,5  years,12/31/2008,Ultram

It works way better for me than Vicodin. I've taken it for almost a year now.  I take 100 mg. as needed - usually twice a day. I haven't tried to go off it_ so don't know about withdrawals. Occasionally it makes me feel a little dizzy_ queasy_ and headachy_ but those symptoms are much better than the pain I have if I don't take it.  I'm really thankful I have this medication.,F,55,1  years,12/20/2008,Ultram
253, 3, arthritis in hips,At first a euphoric feeling that tapered off after a few weeks. Helps the pain a lot but I frequently feel disoriented and have a hard time concentrating.,I have a situation that I'm sure is not common and I've not read about it here. I found out by accident that I was physically addicted to this drug. Ran out and figured I'd be okay for a day or so. Thought I had the flu but was puzzled that I had no fever or sore throat. Had all the other awful symptoms though. Refilled my ultram and felt better almost immediately. Then did some research and found this message board. That was over a year ago. Got diagnosed with cancer 2 months ago. There are days when between the radiation_ chemo and other meds I forget to take the ultram. Yet...no withdrawal symptoms. I am going to take this opportunity to try and taper my dose down and see if a lesser amount will still handle the pain. Anyone else ever heard of this? I have not been able to find any correlation between cancer treatment and ultram. As many of you are I am furious my doctor didn't warn me about the addiction. I am an 18 yr recovering alcoholic. I didn't need this.,F,53,3  years,12/17/2008,Ultram

Pay attention to the possible interactions with OTC meds.,While everyone reacts differently to medication_ this pain reliever has worked reasonably well for me without any serious drawbacks. It has certainly worked better and caused fewer side effects than comparable opiates. As for addiction_ what Ive seen among the users I know is that normal usage does not lead to addiction: abuse will (as with most prescription pain relievers).,M,59,2  years,12/12/2008Email,Ultram

261, 5, migraines_ broken vertebrae,Cotton mouth_ Euphoria_ falling asleep every time I hold still even while standing up_ VIVID TERRIBLE NIGHT TERRORS/NIGHTMARES_ nausea,I have taken this for about a year for migraines.  Couldn't take it on an empty stomach at all_ or even right before food_ because it made me vomit.  No problems with withdrawals at that time; only took 50 mg a few times a month.  Currently taking for pain due to broken vertebrae.  Been addicted to several narcotics_ so they are unacceptable for me.  Now taking it with Reglan for the nausea and no problems.  The only real problem I'm having is the nightmares with the increased dosage (50 mg every 4 hours).  I continue to wake up sobbing and screaming_ which I was prone to before but hadn't dont in years.  Also wondering if this might be a latent effect of the accident that caused the broken vertebrae.  It has increased my teeth grinding tremendously_ but the side effects are worth the pain relief at this time_ I think.  Titration is the way to get off of any medication_ anyway_ and I've done it many times before_ so not worried about withdrawals--they may suck but I'll get through them,F,28,1  years,11/16/2008,Ultram

My heart pounds so much it keeps me from sleeping-which is what the PN did! :),I see all the negative comments here_ and I would suggest to anyone considering it to build a relationship with your care provider that allows you both to trust each other. Try things in small doses_ then move up as needed.I told my doctor that I hate drugs_ and don't take any nerve/pain killers at the dentist. He was so intrigued that he referred me to the pain clinic in NH_ CT_ where I still see the chief of neurology-even after his promotion and offload of cases. Why? Because I took the time to give very accurate information to them_ and tell them that I was looking for diagnoses_ cures_ and management of symptoms-in that order. I see a lot of complaints here about their Dr's_ and with my work with many charities and family support_ I guarantee I have more experience with this than most here: A lack of_ or incorrect communication is the source of all your problems.Don't _want_ a better doctor; Become the patient someone _wants_ to help.,M,48,5  years,11/15/2008,Ultram

This has left me with a depressed feeling 4 days later that seems to come and go but almost to the point where I could just breakdown completely_ I just hope this goes away soon as it is very unlike me.,I was changed to Tramadol despite requesting that I was not put on this medication. I first took it last Saturday after letting my previous medication clear from my system as advised by the doctor. I took a single 50mg dose instead of the 100mg I was prescribed as I wanted to be sure about it first and I am only glad I did. I took the first dose at 11.45am and by 1.15pm it had crippled me. I began to overheat and sweat and became confused_ I was actually trying to get out the house and lay in the rain as I felt I was burning up but instead managed to make it to the lounge where I ended up on the sofa. It was then that the shaking started_ I went completely white and clammy and became very restless and then started to get stomach cramps and felt very nauseous. About 2.15pm I started needing to toilet about every 30 minutes or so which was just watery_ this continued on until Monday morning where it slowed down about 2 hour intervals and today Tuesday seems a little more controlled.

Now a days_ I'm the one who is always hot and everyone else is cold.  I sweat a lot but I rather sweat than be in pain and cold.  I also noticed that I feel more alert and happy with this medication.  The only thing I don't like about it is that I don't sleep on days I take it close to bedtime.  It completely makes my sleep go away_ even without sleep_ as long as I continue to take it through the day_ I can function fine thanks to the effects of tramadol.

283, 4, pain from knee tumor,high energy_ a slight 'high'_ better sleep_ excellent pain relief_ maybe headaches?,I had severe pain from a large tumor growing within my knee joint_ and then afterwards from two surgeries and a bought of radiation. I was taking the traditional narcotic pain relievers and felt like they induced too severe a high for me to function in my thinking intensive job.  I mentioned these concerns to my doctor and he prescribed Ultram.  While I was still very high I liked that it gave me more energy than the other medications which allowed me to complete a lot of work...though not tasks that required my full brainpower.  I am very conservative in my use of these kinds of pain killers and only take one or two pills a day when in severe pain.  Now that I am fully recovered I take about 1 or 2 a week to deal with the persistent arthritic pain from the radiation.  I suffer from chronic insomnia and this actually helps me sleep while keeping my energy high during the day.  I get headaches from time to time that may or may not be related to this medication [or a few too many pints :,F,28,2  years,8/8/2008,Ultram

I use it recreationaly for my favorite vice of all - sex. It can make it a challange to reach orgasm - which I leverage and love. You have to find what dose works for you because it can make it impossible. I'm happily married_ monogamous_ christian ""family man"". And this drug is great. Instead of trying NOT to have an orgasm you have to try TO have one - which changes the game dramatically - it's a blast. Wifey likes it too for the same reasons. I don't abuse it because I don't want to build a tolerance to it. I never take it more than 2x per week. I take 1-2 tablets aprox 4-6 hours before ""show time"" and it gives me great control.

I finally woke up and quit when I lost the opportunity for a major job advancement.  I failed to finish the qualifying test in time because of an Ultram induced stupor.

If you take this drug on a daily basis it will not work as well and you'll risk withdrawl symptoms.

Then when the constant buzzing and ringing in my ears began I realized this stuff is really bad so I stopped taking it.  Horrific pain ensued_ not so much withdrawal symptoms - just severe pain and headaches. I had to go back to taking it again (I also realized that by making it possible for me to do more - I'd actually been hurting my back). I gradually lowered the dose over several weeks and now I'm feeling my normal severe pain again. I still feel like I've been consuming a toxic substance. I've cut my dosage from 250mg per day down to 50 mgs per day and can't wait till the day I'm off it completely.,This drug is supposed to be a pain releiver_ but it is really more like an antidepressant or a stimulant_ (and like most antidepressants - makes it possible for a person in pain to do more_ or work harder_ when they should be resting).

It sort of feels like a mild ""speeder""...I have lots of energy during my workouts...very little to no back pain.  I only take 50mg a day_ which is a rather low_ therapeutic dose.  However_ even on a low dose...I felt simply AWFUL when I ran out of pills and had to go without them for a few days until I could get over to my doctor for a new script to be filled.

I get nauseated if I take too much.",This medicine has TREMENDOUSLY reduced my pain.  I only take it when needed for extreme pain.  I started on 25 mg and now take 200 mg as a first dose_ and if I need more later in the day I take 25 to 50 mg more.  I'm thrilled that I have found a non-narcotic that works to take the edge off the pain as much as Ultram does.,F,31,3  weeks,12/31/2007,Ultram

The problem I have is that it is hard for me to work in the middle of the day if I need a Lortab_ so I was given Ultram (Tramadol) to take during the day. At 50MG_ it just didn't work_ nice mood_ feel better_ but pain is still there. At 150MG_ I felt exactly like I do when I take a 10MG Lortab. My good dose is 100MG_ which eases the pain_ and does not give me the ""high"" quite as bad as 10MG Lortab_ however it is still there. My conlusion was I need 100MG to ease the pain to the level I need it_ but the euphoric high is still present_ but not as bad as Lortab_ thus it somehwat helps in that area.",M,37,1  months,12/28/2007,Ultram

There are some days that my Ultram does not cut it and I need to go to the ER for something stronger_ but for the most part I am pain-free and able to lead a normal life like I used to before my chronic back problems began. I would recommend this medication to others_ but would advise that they wean down over the course of about a month if they are on high dosages for long periods of time and have to come off of this medication for any reason. DO NOT suddenly stop taking this medication if you have been on it for a long time or else you will feel AWFUL. Many doctors proclaim that withdrawals are not likely_ but I can assure you that I have been to hell and back by suddenly stopping this medication because I was on such a high dosage. I take 8 tablets per day (the maximum dosage) and experienced painful and agonizing withdrawal_ but if I weaned down I was alright.

I only take 50mg first thing in morning and 50 mg mid day.  If I take any more I cannot sleep and the effect lasts 10 hours.,It is the only medication that helps my back pain.  It is fantastic as it also gives me lots of energy and I become very productive.  I have to muck out and look after six horses so I can't afford to be out of action.  Without ultram this would not be possible.

When I got my perscription_ I would only take it when I had pain then I noticed a pattern.  The days after I took it at night_ I would wake up fully rested and pain free.  The difference was noticed by everyone who knows me.  I stopped my Lyrica and have been takin my ultram before bed and have not had aches or restless nights while taking it.  I ran out one day woke up tired and stiff.  I had pain all day and felt chills_ just as I felt on a daily basis before taking this med.  I also notice that my mood enhances.

Since it works on neurotransmitters (specifically_ Serotonin) it can produse some interesting side effects that other analgesics do not. I required a higher dose for relief which probably contributed to my less that stellar results. It might be just the thing for some_ but I did not like the side effects.

I am more motivated_ sleep better every night_ get things done early_ spend very little time in front of the TV now_ and just feel great. I never realized that my serotonin levels were low until discovering this on accident. I honestly feel like it has given me my life back.

It's very effective when you go a few days between doses. This drug has saved me many trips to the ER!,M,42,18  months,2/11/2007,Ultram
387, 3, Arthritic pain,High blood pressure_ constipation_ vision changes_ sleep too much_ loss of motivation_ total loss of libido.,I've been on 200mg a day (400mg on a bad day) of Ultram for around 5 yrs due to general arthritic joint pain & am now much more aware of its downside. It can have a slight mood enhancing effect but this can lead to people taking it for this and the way it raises blood pressure could be dangerous in older people. I only realised the downside of the drug after stopping taking it. Once through the unpleasant withdrawal period I realised how I had been in a drug haze_ even though relatively mild_ for the years I had been on it & regaining my old acuity of mind was great. Taken for arthritis it can actually increase pain levels because you tend to sleep longer than normal. Nevertheless it can be a Godsend if used sensibly & having regular breaks from it.,M,54,5  years,2/9/2007Email,Ultram
388, 2, Back Pain,None,Is this drug a placebo? Because It does absolutely nothing at all for my pain_ and i feel no different what - so- ever. I might as well just swallow a piece of corn and pretend its pain reliever.,F,24,1  months,1/28/2007,Ultram
389, 4, Shoulder and arm pain,inability to achieve orgasm,NOTE: I am actually taking Ultracet (which is tramadol plus acetominophen)_ but I'm putting this here because Ultracet isn't listed yet_ evidently.This has helped with my pain (when nothing else would_ except narcotics_ and no one would give me those)_ but it came with a strange price for me: inability/difficulty in achieving orgasm. For this reason_ I'm now only taking it when I absolutely MUST take it.,F,34,14  days,1/25/2007,Ultram
390, 4, CFS and severe Fibromyalgia,None,This medicine provided very good pain relief for me for about 7 years.  It did not take all the pain away but it made it much easier to deal with.  I could focus on other things besides the pain when I took it.  I took four 50 mg pills a day.  However when I had a very bad flare up this year the medicine stopped working for me.  I'm currently tapering off so that hopefully with it out of my system for a while_ it will start working for me again.  It does provide a little bit of euphoria which helped me with depression.,F,53,7  years,1/21/2007Email,Ultram
391, 5, Vulvar Vestibulitis,None!,I have suffered from chronic nerve pain which affects the opening to my vagina.  I am always feeling pain and burning in that area_ and intense pain 4-5 days after sex.  Ultram literally saved my life.  It keeps me from feeling constant pain. I can go about my daily activities. With ZERO side effects.  Since I have started it_ my doc has put me on a ton of other meds (3 different tricyclics_ neurontin_lyrica_ effexor_ etc) and I have had surgery_ acupuncture and physical therapy.  So far_ Ultram is the only thing that helps my pain. It also seems to be th eonly one that doesn't give me side effects.,F,37,7  years,12/16/2006,Ultram
392, 4, Peripheral Neuropathy,Started it over 7+ years ago. I remember some dizziness the first week_ but not anything I couldn't deal with.  I'm fine taking it with Lyrica for pain - it helps reduce my neuropathic pain greatly in combination with my other meds_ but the withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose_ are comparable to a very bad case of the Flu. I feel terrible. I would suggest some form of replacemnt medication_ or weaning off it very slowly.,Warning: DO NOT MISS DOSES!If stopping_ wean off slowly- do not stop abruptly! I would suggest some other medication to help titrate down if stopping the med. Withdrawal symptoms would be significant and difficult.,M,62,7  years,12/16/2006,Ultram

395, 5, abdominal adhesions_ tmj,Itchy face and scalp_ relaxed arms and legs_ slight euphoria_ less anxiety_ calm/friendly mood,I like this med!

The itchiness is a little annoying_ but well worth it.,F,35,6  weeks,11/14/2006,Ultram
396, 5, Neck/Back Pain From Trauma,Some itching at first.  Energy_ motivation,Started taking for a fractured jaw and neck injury.  Works great on pain especially when taken with Ultram.  Makes me a working machine.  I feel no pain and can swing a hammer all day long with minimal neck pain.  It is addicting_ but who cares when you can't get up out of bed without it?  I'd rather be addicted and immobilized.,,,2.5  years,11/12/2006,Ultram

I have experience no highs from this med and no addiction or dependency issueees. Please keep in mind when reading these posts that most confuse the difference between dependency and addiction. They are not one in the same so educate yourself so you know the difference and minimize misstatements_ thanks.

399, 5, Endometriosis,Drowsiness_ euphoria_ slight nausea_ quick to experience stress and anxiety in non-tranquil situations.  Mild serotonin crash (headache_ feel a little low) after the painful part of my period is over and I stop taking it. Other symptoms of withdrawl along with the serotonin crash like sweating_ a little agitation_ some more nausea_ crankiness. Good hydration can alleviate some of the withdrawl effects.,I use about 2-5 50mg tablets in the most painful 48 hours of my period along with lots of ibuprofen and an herbal/mineral preparation containing cramp bark_ valerian_ black cohosh_ ginger_ magnesium_ B vitamins_ etc.  Ginger is excellent for reducing the nausea symptoms.  Ultram along with the other things gave me my life back.  HOWEVER - be mindful of symptoms of depenence and/or addiction.  It can happen. I only take it at the stage of my period that gives me the pain that can result in vomiting and blackouts. Milder pain doesn't warrant it_ nor do symptoms of withdrawl.  I never use Ultram for anything other than the menstrual pain. That can lead you along the path to addiction.  I don't wish to go there.,F,33,5  years,10/28/2006Email,Ultram

I was given Naprosyn (sp?) for its anti-inflamatory qualities as well.As for side effects: nothing unpleasant during the week I took it...300mg/day.  It produced a mild euphoria_ but not like a traditional narcotic such as Darvocet_ etc.  I take Xanax 3 times per day for AD and have for 9 years.  Ultram tends to make me a little hyper but not in the way that I experienced while seeking treatment for real AD - it makes me alert and active.  I tended to want to clean up or tackle some project I'd put off for weeks.A bit of nausea if taken on an empty stomach_ but not bad.  I also had a tendency to clench my teeth a BIT.

After I quit cold turkey I developed horrible flu like symptoms_ and terrible hip pain and I was unable to walk for 2 months. I finally had to buy an electric wheel chair. I had several cats scan done after that. My Doctors think that it could have been a bad allergic reaction to tramadol. By the way I also developped bloody stools.,Tramadol is great.

416, 3, low back pain,Good pain relief_ but horrible stomach problems--like I ate rocks.,My doctor gave me some samples of Tramadol ER today--evidently the new_ improved Tramadol (Ultram is the generic of Tramadol).  this is a time-released pill_ 200 ml._ taken once a day_ as opposed to 50 ml for the Ultram I was taking every 6 hours.  According to the literature_ it takes 4 days for the levels to build up in your system_ then you maintain the level with once-a-day dosing.  Evidently it's for long-term chronic pain.  He said there would be fewer stomach problems because it dissolves as it passes through the intestines instead of immediately in your stomach.  I haven't tried it yet_ because I'm trying to let my stomach recover from the regular Tramadol.  Has anyone had any experience with it?  It's so new that I couldn't pull it up on this website.

It doesn't take all the pain away_ but does take the edge off of chronic pain in my leg/feet/tendons when I walk.  It also helps with the ache from valves damaged by a blood clot.  It does nothing to tame the shooting/burning neuropathic pain from post clot nerve damage.   I feel a little nausious and loopy sometimes_ but nothing like the narcotic pain killers which wipe me out.  I think I have adjusted to it and take more when I need it.

I've talked to other people who have had experience with this drug and have been told that discontinance can lead to withdrawals worse than hydrocodone.  I would advise anybody to stay away from this drug.  Some people seem to respond well to it_ but it is pharmacological Russian Rulette.  If this is all you'r doc will write you find one what will write you Tylenlol #3 or a lower dose of hydrocodone (preferrable Vicuproffen since it has no tylenol).

I usually take 2 tablets twice a day and combine with 400mg ibuprofen twice a day. No gastrointestinal side effects for me. Be careful when combining with antidepressants_ I had a seizure when taking Celexa and Ultram_ but never one from Ultram alone. The Ultram seems to work as well as any antidepressant I have tried anyway_ so I am no longer taking one_ just the Ultram.,M,35,2  years,8/13/2005,Ultram

I only take it 2 or 3 times a month_ so I expected it to be potent and useful.  It has consistently under-performed_ and only seems able to handle rather low-level pain.   It does help_ though_ and is better than nothing or OTCs.  For intense cramps_ only Vicodin really works for me.

The pain level is lower although it is not gone completely. The medication gives enough relief so I can function without being doped up.

I don't think its as effective as some of the other opiates for relieving pain.  However_  I find it helps to take the burning/nerve pain away better than any of the over the counter meds you can get.  I've been taking it for about 6 months and usually take it in the morning and  at night.  I do think I'm somewhat addicted to it...I don't really crave it when I don't take it_ but I do feel uneasy and anxious when I don't.  I do think it has an anti depression effect for me.

Not as good as other pain medicines but this one is good for moderate pain BEFORE it happens. I found that this medicine taken every four hours (2 pills_ 100 mg)is the only way it helps manage the pain. If you have an onset of severe pain_ I suggest to take another medicine stronger and more for severe to modereately severe pain (even percocette or something along that line).. Good as a pain managment system along with your Dr and managed prescription. PS...do not take yourself off suddenly..very unpleasant. I was very surprised. But it lasts for about 1-2 days and gradually you feel better. Not at all as bad as trying to get off opiods though. I was so pleasantly surprised that this medicine worked and it was not a narcotic or anything like it..but it tells you if you are allergic to those type of medicines be cautious.

It gets rid of a great deal of pain and makes it easier with daily activities. It does not cause the grogginess and lethargy you get in taking a conventional narcotic prepartation.  The only drawback I've noticed is withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing this medication which has happened on several occasions over the last 7 years.  I had been taking narcotic-based meds in the years prior_ and never have I had such symptoms of withdrawal as I have had with Ultram.  These include inability to mentate_ bodyaches_ jitteriness_ and basically feeling mentally and physically incapacitated.  It has worked better for me than the other mild narcotics such as Darvocet_ etc_ and when I've asked numerous doctors in regards to addictiveness_ they deny it being a problematic drug.  Yikes!
