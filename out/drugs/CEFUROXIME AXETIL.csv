0, 3, sinus infection,The medication did dry out my sinus somewhat_ I still had a lot of drainage during all days. 4th day started to shut down the drainage.  It kills the appetite_ upsets the stomach slightly and makes constant need to poop after eating w/in 30-40 minutes.  No matter if the food is just liquid.  Exhaustion is constant.  Hard to focus.,I am to take it for 10 days_  if I can make it that long. I may just stop it before then.,F,78,5  days500mg 2X D,6/16/2016,Cefuroxime axetil
1, 5, Serious UTI (kidney),I had some nausea the first few days but I'm not even sure it was caused by the cefuroxime_ as I was extremely nauseous from the infection before starting this med. After the 2nd or 3rd day_ zero side effects.,I actually had to take this drug for a total of 15 days_ not counting the IV dose of it that they gave me at the hospital. This was my first experience with antibiotics and I was extremely nervous about it_ having heard many horror stories about what antibiotics can do to you. I finished about 1.5 weeks ago and have had none of the terrible effects I was expecting_ and it cleared the infection.,F,46,10  days500mg 2x D,2/26/2016,Cefuroxime axetil
2, 5, Sinus Infection,Tired but this is probably because the medicine is killing the bacteria.,I had a bad sinus infection and had no energy to even drive to see the doctor. Took one 500 mg pill and it knocked me out. The next day I felt better_ took 500 mg split in half. No side effects_ day 3 and I feel like a human being again.,F,40,5  days500 mg 1X D,10/27/2015,Cefuroxime axetil
