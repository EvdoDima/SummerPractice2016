0, 4, A-fib,Other medications I have tried did not alleviate my symptoms and they also caused severe headaches. I take the Toprol er each night before bed because it does make me sleepy. I wake up feeling rested. It keeps my heart rate down during the day (without medication my resting heart rate is around 130 bpm). I am also on 10 MG Adderall XR and the Toprol continues to keep my h/r down.,,F,37,2  months25 MG,11/28/2015Email,Metoprolol succinate

3, 2, high blood pressure,So tired I can hardly keep my eyes open. I tried 3 other b/p meds that didn't agree with me and b/p was 185/115 so I had no choice. Either itchy or skipped heart beats_ was in the ER because of side effects from others. I am on pain meds and half of one at night and I still can't function all day.I just want to sleep_ its awful. Doc said I am just sensitive to it but I need to find something that doesn't make me feel like I am so drugged and no its not the pain meds I have been on them for yrs with no problem. Docs uses scare tacticts rather then work with me. I really can't work to tired . Also the dreams are so vivid but its the drugged feeling all day that has me off balance.

( dizziness_ profuse cold sweat ) They could never find a problem_ and the last time I think they thought I was just trying to get time off of work.

I weaned myself off over 2 weeks time and have never had the symptoms since.

10, 1, Hypertension,Started at 25 mg for a week and my blood pressure did not decrease_ it stayed the same.  My generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) did get a tad worse.  My GP increased the dosage of the metoprolol succinate (generic) to 50 mg.  Anxiety significantly increased_ and the tinnitus that was part of my anxiety increased as well.  That was troubling_ but my blood pressure actually went up from borderline 145/90 to 160/110.  I was at this dosage for a week and convinced my GP I needed to go off it.  She told me to taper over 5 days.  At the end of the taper_ I started having jaw_ arm_ and chest pains.  Went to the ER_ no heart attack_ but probably just angina.  About a week later I felt much better_ but my tinnitus has stayed at the same elevated volume.  It has gone from slightly noticeable to intrusive at almost all times.  It did not help with my blood pressure_ it ramped up my anxiety significantly_ but it did lower my pulse to about 60 bpm.,"This drug_ unlike most other beta blockers_ can cross the ""blood brain barrier"" and can interact with central nervous system tissues. If you have anxiety_ tinnitus_ depression_ etc. I would steer clear of this drug.  ",M,44,30  days50 mg 1X D,12/31/2012Email,Metoprolol succinate

Each time_ I get the same symptoms.  When I get my AstraZenica Toprol back_ the symptoms disappear almost overnight.  Some of the Metoprolol was recalled back in 2009.  It was supposedly corrected_ so I tried it again.  Guess what?  It wasn't corrected.  Sorry I won't be able to update_ because I'll NEVER take generic metoprolol ( Watson ) again.,F,62,21  days25mg 1X D,10/4/2010,Metoprolol succinate
