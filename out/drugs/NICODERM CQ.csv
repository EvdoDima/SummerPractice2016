0, 1, Quit smoking,I am at fault first for not investigating side effects of the NicoDerm patch and I became addicted when using the patch to help me quit smoking. I have had moderate hair  loss at the front and crown of head.    After trying to change different things in my life style thinking the patch was not the cause_ nothing seem to remedy the hair loss for many months.! I am just putting it together now that the NicoDerm patch has caused a lot of thinning and dryness in my hair I am quitting the patch today.   Today is July 2016_ and I will repost in a few months to advise patients as to if I can regrow my hair with increased protein  in my diet_  and  continue to take my biotin supplement to help support hair regrowth.,,F,44,2  years14 mg,7/4/2016Email,Nicoderm cq

2, 3, Control of Ulcerative Colitis,Restlessness_ heart palpitations_ increased pulse rate_ increased blood glucose dumping_ increased bowel movement (but decreased bleeding)_ bad flu like symptoms without fever or sore throat such as body aches_ chills_ fatigue_ drug dependence_ appetite suppression_ weight loss.  The flu like symptoms (chills_ body aches) didn't start right away - may be a month to month and half after starting nicoderm cq.,I am not a smoker.  I have a presumed auto-immune disease called Ulcerative Colitis.  I've read research that nicotine helped control the symptoms of UC.  It did for me_ but the trade off in side-effects was not worth it for me.  I am now trying to get off this stuff and I am dependent on nicotine.  I would use the 7 mg patch a few hours a day until I couldn't stand the side-effects anymore_ then rip it off (man what a negative glucose ride that is all by itself).  Then sometimes I would put a new patch on several hours later.  Anyway_ I hope my UC doesn't flare back up again that I have to get back on nicotine.Health History:  Diagnosed UC in 2001. Otherwise healthy.Current Flare History:  Started end of Jan 2007 till early April 2007.  Treated with prednisone Feb 07-Apr 07_ nicotine (feb 07 - jun 07)_ lialda (ongoing)_ MSIR (for pain and diarhea. ongoing taper down).  If anyone has similar experience please post here.,M,40,3  months,5/23/2007,Nicoderm cq
3, 5, Nicotine (smoking) addiction,Intense_ very lifelike_ insane_ vivid dreams (only happened first two nights I wore the patch sleeping).,For me_ it felt as if I had just got done smoking a cigarette all day_ so there was no urge (other than oral fixation). Worked great! The only thing is_ I had been a smoker for over 10 years (1-2 packs a day) and I quit easily without following all the steps they listed.,M,29,1  months,4/5/2006,Nicoderm cq
