The mental stuff I manage through homoeopathy.Long term ligament and tendon dysfunction.Neurologically never the same.The list goes on. Do not take this drug.Acne is a symptom of an underlying problem. Usually related to toxicity or hormones which can be corrected by homoeopathy. Please do not take this drug. You might be one of the unlucky people who end up struggling for the rest of your life.I'm studying medicine now and I might have to stop because of this.,,F,37,7  months40 mg,5/6/2016Email,Accutane

Also I'm bubbly_ I don't seem to be myself I'm not as bubbly as I usually am I'm a lot more mellow...almost dull & boring at times_ easily confused. Lethargic I haven't been to the gym & I went every wk prior to these tablets. & recently I'd say a week or so I've had bad joint ache in my ankle. My periods have been mega heavy since taking this drug my dermatologist said its not related?? Headaches_ nose bleeds_ skin peeling_ dry nose,Ok I'm 34_ still currently taking this. I tried everything prior to this drug it's been the last resort. My acne is not as sever as other people but it was bad enough to make me unhappy as when I'd get a flare up the spots would all come at once & were huge & sore & red. I've always used body shop concealer pencil to cover my spots it's the best product I've ever used for my skin. Anyway I'd say take photos whilst your on this drug so you can see how far you've come in stages with this drug. The first week on it_ I definitely wasn't me_ I was mega irritable. My skin started to peel at first (like when you've been sunburnt & your skins peeling off) my spots started to improve within a couple of days I was well happy. Then they started to get worse. If any of you want to email me you can I will send you pics of what my skin looked like & what it looks like now. Anyway a week into it my skin was awful red & sore & mega sensitive I had to stop using my usual cleanser it was too harsh. I started to get headaches persistently for a long time  (which I don't seem to be having problems with at this stage now) I found peppermint tea helped with headaches also my mood swings oh & also vasaline is best for your lips!

13, 1, moderate acne,I have suffered with acne ever since i started high school and i have always been so self conscious and been ashamed of myself for the way i look. I have always known accutane is a dangerous drug to take but it was a last resort as everything else i tried didn't work. I was very dry but had no side effects until 3 months into my treatment. I got pink eye and it wouldn't go away even with antibacterial eyedrops it was still quite bad. My dermatologist told me it was very unlikely the accutane would be causing this. I went off accutane as i also started getting head aches_ even after going off the accutane my side effects are now continuing even worst_ i have terrible sinus pain_ back pain_ head aches_ droopy/puffy eyes_ i have had bloating and this is all happening once i have gone off the accutane which is really scary. 1 month after being off accutane these side effects are still bad_ i'm glad i wasn't on it longer and on a higher dose. The dermatologists àre making mega bucks off this medication and they won't tell you how bad for your body it really is. The number one cause of disease is dehydration and that's what accutane does it sucks your body dry. These side effects are so much more common than you realise and the list goes on and on of possible side effects you may receive while you are on the medication or in a lot of cases like mine once you come off it aswell.

14, 1, Acne,Well_ I never thought I'd ever share it_ but yeah.Accutane destroyed my sex drive.It's not that I can't get an erection or anything_ it's just that.. When I start having a sexual intercourse withmy girlfriend_ I don't last long at all. I can barely ever get her to come and it's pretty hard on my self esteem. You may say - 'Why don't you foreplay more?' There's a limit to foreplay_ get real.Regardless_ I'm not going to die from this_ I've been through worse.However_ I completely recommend AVOIDING ACCUTANE AT ALL COST.You'd rather have problems with sex than having acne? That's the worse mistake you can ever make.That's.. The worse mistake I ever made.My acne did go away - not completely_ but it did prove to be very efficient after a little over than 6 months.Regardless_ it was not worth it.If the only reason you want to get rid of acne is to get a girlfriend or a boyfriend_ then you're an idiot.

18, 5, Resistant acne,Dry lips which started right away_ lips would get so try if I forgot to put on lib balm my lips would dry_ crack_ and swell. Aquaphor was a godsend (and cheap!) and so was Dr. Dans Cortibalm (order online). The Cortibalm helped when my lips would swell_ Aquaphor kept them from drying out the longest. Back pain_ noticed this when dose increased to 60mg (this was helped GREATLY by drinking 1-2L of water a day_ also fish oil)_ dry skin (had to get a steroid cream from the doc)_ thirst (once again_ water helped the most) and fatigue (felt like my body was being taxed),"Accutane gave me skin I thought I could never have and I couldn't be happier. Since middle school I had acne that just wasn't being controlled with over the counter washes/creams and prescription lotions/retinoids. Antibiotics worked_ but what's the point? The acne comes back when you finish and you can't stay on antibiotics forever. The topicals WERE helping_ but just not enough. I was working too hard and spending too much to still be breaking out (when I went on Accutane I was using Aczone 2x a day_ an antibiotic lotion 2x a day_ a retinoid 1x a day_ and an antibiotic by mouth 2x a day) and still my acne was not controlled. It was like treating a wildfire with a garden hose. I was hesitant to go on Accutane because of all the stories you hear about it but I made sure I got my blood work done monthly and saw my doctor and I was fine. Take your time with it_ there's a dose cumulative that you should reach for it to work the best with the least chance of relapse (120-150mg/kg of body weight). I did 30mg for the first month_ 40mg for the second. and 60mg for months 3-6. Month 3 is when the magic happened_ up until then my skin was ""purging"" - oily_ big breakouts_ etc. I used a gentle face wash and good moisturizer and that was all on Accutane and it completely cleared my skin. I'm one month off and the side effects have almost entirely gone away and my skins still great :) Accutane has given me more than clear skin_ it's given me my confidence and self esteem back.",M,17,6  months60,5/29/2015Email,Accutane

31, 4, Acne,Accutane did wonders for my face. I had very severe acne that basically made me ashamed to show my face in public. I began to take Accutane and began to see miraculous results in 1 month. The side effects I got consisted of dry skin and dry eyes mostly. Dry skin is easily treated with lotion and dry eyes were very annoying. I ended up downing a few gallons of water probably each day and eye drops to combat that. Otherwise_ no major side effects for me.,I would recommend this IF you are incredibly desperate. The above peope had some bad experiences but I had none. If anything I got happier as the months passed and my face cleared up. I am 6 months past my course of Accutane now. My eyes continue to be dry and acne slowly creeps up every once in awhile but I know take a much less dangerous medicine as needed to get rid of acne. Again_ read the side effects over and over_ everyone is different. Also_ watch your vitamin A intake on the medicine. You get way over your DV with the medicine alone.,M,18,6  months,2/12/2015Email,Accutane

Like being trapped in a waking nightmare with no way to stop it. Totally physiological_ no life circumstances triggered this. Decided to end my course a month early and admitted myself into the ER for emergency psychiatric intervention. I now know why so many people have killed themselves on this drug. The psychosis it can cause is truly Hell-ish. Without medical intervention_ dying would have been preferable to living with unending Accutane mind-poisoning. It's essentially the same experience that occurs when you severely overdose on vitamin A. The real fun side effects began shortly after my course finished. While taking Accutane_ my hair completely changed it's texture. It became weak_ thin_ lifeless_ dry_ and wire-y. It all began falling out a month after my course ended. It continues to shed to this day. There is no baldness in my family. My face then began wrinkling. Fine lines began to appear around my mouth_ on my forehead_ and beneath and around my eyes overnight. It was like the collagen suddenly vanished from my face. My eyes became sunken and my skin became red and hyper-pigmented. Waking up each morning a","Very few things in this world are truly awful enough to be deserving of the description ""life-ruining"". Accutane is one of them_ right up there with thalidomide (made by the same company!) and agent orange. History will remember Accutane was being one of the most devastating_ unethical_ and entirely preventable tragedies ever inflicted upon modern society. This drug will not be on the market ten years from now_ as the body of evidence continues to grow that this ""acne medication"" is actually poisonous chemotherapy with irreversible_ gene-altering_ long term side effects.

37, 1, Acne,chills_ intense headache_ slight nausea_ difficulty breathing in bed_ pain in abdomen area,"I feel stupid for even considering a drug with such horrific ""potential effects"". As Most accutane users can admit however_ the depression and social withdrawal that acne causes can lead a person to consider drastic measures. I am 100 pounds so doc put me on 20 MG (10 twice a day). Took one first night_ next day took two. Within an hour after taking my second pill on the second day I felt extreme fatigue. The third day I once again took 20 MG in total and my body reacted instantly. Within an hour I had a wicked headache and crazy fatigue. This continued throughout night with insane chills... I couldn't keep warm in my bed. Felt exactly like battling a bad flu. I knew the next morning I was done with accutane. Your body is so smart and only reacts like that if it's got POISON in it. Stop now_ I am so thankful I got bad enough side effects early. Some people on here are saying even a few weeks has caused them lasting grief. I can't even believe other stories I'm reading. If you think clear skin is a good trade for your health you've got to smarten up. I'd much rather enjoy fantastic sex with a face full of zits than have clear skin. Same goes for bowel problems. Most of the people rating this drug as a 4 or 5 have just come off of it. I'm noticing a trend that it is correlated to severe damaging effects that tend to show up later in life.

39, 4, Acne,From week one until I finished the treatment: Dry chapped lips. From about 2 months on accutane and until I finished the treatment: Feeling og being tired and exhausted most of the time.  Every now and then: Dry or watery or red eyes_ stiffness: ancles_ hips. Chest pain,It cleared my acne after I had tried everything else. My skin hasn't been as soft as it is now since I was 12. But the side effects are horrible. I just finished my treatment. If the acne is gone forever or at least for 1 year or more it was worth it.,F,24,132  days60 1X D,11/11/2014,Accutane
40, 2, severe facial and body acne,Chapped lips_ dry eyes_ nosebleeds. Unusual itching and peeling of skin (to the point of bleeding)inside of one ear_ which I still dig at out of habit.  I did also expierence neck_ shoulder and backaches which I subsequently saw a chiropractor for_ and did not realize it could be due to side effects_ until I read this rating! My cholesterol skyrocketed during treatment.  I am left with severe depression and anxiety.  Seeing a therapist and phychiatrist for treatment and possible medication to help these effects.  My grades in school have suffered and I no longer participate or have interest in my usual school sports. I feel very sad and seeing my reoccurance of acne hasnt helped matters.  Of course my dermatologist wants me to try this medicine again at a higher dose!  My mother will not allow it.,Acne is back on forehead and will not go away_  I was clear for 3-4 months only.  Dermatologist has put me on an oral antibiotic now. Definitely not worth the side effects.,F,17,5  months40/10 2X D,11/9/2014,Accutane

Many good things come with a cost. It may not be for everyone. Hell_ I don't even know if I will get the FULL results with me being on 3 more medications.

44, 1, Years of cystic acne,Acne was clearing up_ but my joints began to ache after one month. My doctor told me it was common but went away with every patient she treated. It got so bad she took me off. 6 months later and I have severe joint pain in my feet_ knees_ wrists_ elbows_ shooting pain and burning sensations. I have now seen an arthritis specialist who is running a battery of tests. I never had any joint related issues prior to taking it. My cysts are slowly returning and now I'm trying to figure out how to deal with all of this pain I never had. I hold out hope that maybe these horrible side effects will begin to go away_ or at least doctors can help me manage my pain better than they have so far.  I know this medicine has helped people_ but if you begin to experience pain in your joints_ you better think hard about continuing the medication and as my doctor asked me to tough it out_ as I needed 6 months of treatment for it to work_ I wish now I never went for help.

I plan on going on a second course of accutane after i have my baby. this is truly a miracle drug. The side effects are worth it when you have clear skin in the end.

The nail on my thumb still sometimes splits lengthways_ although very rarely and it isn't really an issue_ just looks horrid. But my main problem now is my skin on my arms and particularly my legs is so thin that I just scratch an itch and I draw blood. My legs look absolutely awful_ so I tend to keep them covered.

I recently started getting skin rashes on the top on my hands and realized I've been subconsciously itching myself creating these rashes. Also in the last week I woke up one morning with a puffy lower eye_ it looked like I got punched in the eye. After it didn't look swollen the skin around it was dry & that eye looked like it lostit youth & looked old. I suspect that I was itching & rubbing my eye in my sleep & may have been dehydrated. Now I'm dealing with my eye issue & try hard not to itch my eye or hands & arms. So far on my body I've exp no improvements taking 20mg a day currently inweek 6. I got a prescription for 40 mg a day to  carry me into month 4. So 2 months 20mg+ 2 months 40mg.

Wrinkling all over my face. Bloody stool. Dry sensitive flaking skin_ dry peeling scalp_ dry nose_ stomach issues_ thyroid problems. Severe Depression. I was perfectly normal before this ridiculous ignorant use of a drug. I would trade anything in the world to go back in time and have my acne back. My acne wasnt bad at all_ my doctor was a complete idiot. I never took antibiotics or any prescribed topicals first_ just straight to accutane. They (Roche) doesnt even know what it does. Everyone who ever took this drug should recieve compensation and massive studies should be done to figure out how to help everyone out.,Dont take it. The absolute most horrific drug ever. I probably wont make it until im 25 because i can barely stand to look at myself in the mirror anymore. I cant play all sports like i used to because of shoulder and back pain. I cant workout like i used to. I cant be out in the sun or i painfully burn. I cant style my hair or you can see my scalp.

70, 1, Acne,I took roaccutane 8 yrs ago and it destroyed my health. I had the usual side effects while on it but the worst side effects came in the year after finishing treatment. I developed lower back pack which has spread to every joint in my body_ i have a chronic pain in neck_ shoulders and knees. I have arthritis in all my fingers. My skin is constant dry_ irritable and gets red very easily. I have constant dandruff. My hair and fingernails are extremely weak. Ive suffered a lot of hairloss. About 2 years after roaccutane i developed chronic ibs. My eyes are constantly dry and extremely sensetive to light. I also have frequent pressure headaches and erectile dysfunction. There is no doubt in my mind roaccutane caused or played a major roll in all of these problems. Roaccutane is a toxic chemo drug that is not worth a clear complexion. You have no idea how your body will react to poison. I thought it worked great right after taking it_ boy was i wrong.

He is now 22 years old so it has been a while since he took the drug.  This anger thing is very worrisome and we are looking into counseling for this.,So far the Accutane worked wonders.

77, 1, folliculitis,"I was given accutane (amnesteem) for folliculitis that had failed to respond to all other treatments.  My face was always very greasy_ so the doctor felt that a low dose of accutane for a short period would cure it.Pro: Within 2 weeks my face cleared.  I have been off the drug for two weeks (after a 6 week course) and no recurrence of the folliculits_ but its a bit soon to tell if I'm ""cured"" or not.If I knew then what I know now_ I would have stopped taking this drug as soon as I had the result I wanted.Con:  My inner sense of well being was completely destroyed.  I could not sit still without panicking.  I lost the ability to be happy about anything or to sense any enjoyment or sense of well being at all.  I have never in my life experienced the type of anxiety and depression that I experienced when on this drug.  If I had knowledge of my experience before I took this drug_ I would never have taken it at all.  I want nothing to do with accutane at all.  Howe",I started taking the drug 11/5/12 last pill was 12/16/12.While taking the drug_ I noticed that within 1-2 hours after taking it I would get very irritable_ so I decided that I would take it about a 1/2 hour before bed_ so that the aggression would express itself while I was sleeping.Within 2.5 - 3.5 weeks I started waking up in the middle of the night with a sense of utter despair and hopelessness.  I'd tell myself it was just the drug and to shut up and go back to sleep.By 12/10_ I wanted to stop taking it_ but I had a Dr. appointment 12/17_ so I kept taking the pills.  The Doctor prescribed a different type of accutane to combat the depression..The next morning_ I woke up in a total panic at about 5:30 am.  I went to the fridge and drank a lot of water and then laid back down_ but the panic would not subside. For the rest of the day_ I was experiencing sheer terror.  I decided to skip the pill that night for fear of the side effects.By the week of Christmas_ I was still having panic attacks that last for about 4-6 hours each.  The panic was accompanied by a tingling and throbbing sensation in my head.  Thankfully_ there were parts of the day where I felt nearly like my old self again.Now on December 28_ the panic attacks are much more mild and last about 1-2 hours.  My fear is that they will never entirely go away.

I would say that if you are a sensitive character your natural worries and feelings will be enhanced and you will pass from waves of feeling worthless to feeling angry.

I also had some changes in vision_ as well as sensitivity to sun. One of the worst side effects was that the corners of my mouth got really dry to the point where I couldn't eat without causing it to bleed. Depression was another thing_ but I was also dealing with many outside factors that could have played a part in getting the depression_ but I think that the accutane had some effect on it as well.  However_ most of the side effects were treatable and I have been able to cope with them and I think that it will be worth it to have clear skin. I have been told that my skin had cleared up_ but for right now the psychological side effects of the drug have kind of made me feel like there wasn't much of a change_ but as soon as the side effects wear off_ I will probably be greatful that I decided to go on accutane.,,F,17,4  months40 MG,5/10/2012Email,Accutane

I believe everyone who claims they got depressed from it probably already had a mental issue. I would also like to know about everyones diet when they were on accutane.

91, 4, Severe acne since age 14,Mild joint pain. Dry lips and very sun sensitive skin_ especially arms. Got a severe sun burn on hands that took more than a month to heal. Just stay away from Sun - hat_ hat hat!!! and Sunscreen too. Just avoid any optional trips that will expose you to sun. I had a horrible burn just with the sun rays falling on my hand while travelling in a car for few hours.,I have had acne problem since age 14 - tried various medications and stopped going to the dermatologist since 2002. Finally decided to do something about it in 2011. The pain of having acne was so suicidal - there was not a day/night that I was not conscious about my face. I felt so horrible and my self esteem was so low. I was terrified to meet people_ go to weddings etc. I moved from US to Australia and was suggested to go to this derm in Sydney. It has been 4 months since I have been on Accutane. I still have the scarring from years of damage. But except for 1 breakout_ my skin has cleared up. I have a habit of picking_ so some dry spots on the face is taking time to heal. I can look myself in the mirror now_ take close up pictures and no longer get scared to meet people. My dermatologist said because my condition is severe_ I might have to be on the drug for another few months. But I already feel so much confident. My acne cleared up so much and with little make up_ I can totally look nice. I did think I was depressed/had a lot of joint pain in the beginning. But I try to stay hydrated_ active and confident and not to think about the side effects. Having Acne is more suicidal than the cure by accutane. So_ I am glad that I am taking this drug. This was my last resort and I am glad it is working. For a period of 2 weeks_ I had stopped the medicine_ as I did not get a refill. Believe me_ the chapped lips got better and my face was much smoother. I have heard that on,F,37,4  months40 2X D,4/14/2012Email,Accutane

93, 1, Light acne,I had some acne_ not lots_ but acne that wouldn't go away. I was prescribed this drug by doctors (outside the US) who are incented to prescribe it because there is probably a majority rate of success_ and in their perspective the benefits outweighed the risk. I started getting depressed but not realizing it was from the accutane which is not as highly monitored overseas. I started trying to figure out ways to committ suicide as everything irritated me. I began to hallucinate that there was a man inside my apartment and needed to stay with friends. I began having severe memory loss where it disrupted my daily activities. For instance_ I'd leave the house_ forget where I was going and have to go back home but I'd realize I'd forgotten my keys and locked myself out and couldn't remember phone numbers etc. I'd forget whether I'd already taken my accutane that day so I'd have to write it on post it notes ie date and dosage. I'm sure I'd taken multiple doses on days I'd forgotten to write it down. My brain felt like Swiss cheese. I couldn't remember names of people. I eventually did commit suicide and woke up in the hospital. This is in addition to severe weight loss ie my shoe size went from an 8.5 to a 6 and I had dry chapped lips and still do to this day. I lost years of my life from this drug since even after stopping it_ my memory didn't immediately return.

96, 5, Cystic Acne,I suffered from severe chapped lips and sensitive skin.,"I have suffered from acne since I was 13_ through time_ it progressively got worse and I was diagnosed with cystic acne. How it was explained_ the cells in my body which produced sweat was somehow mutated and produced it at 2x the normal rate. The excessive amount of sweat caused oil to often fill up my pores and cause cysts all over my body. I was told cystic acne was incurable_ my dermatologist suggested Accutane. At first I was hesitant because of the immense waiver I had to sign_ but I had reached my limit and willingly signed. This drug changed my life. I suffered from chap lips and sensitive skin_ but after 1-2 months_ it reduced the production of cysts on my body about 95%. I am not saying this cured my cystic acne_ but dealing with a bad cyst 2-3 times a year_ is better than dealing with a cyst 3-4 times a month. This helped my self-esteem immensely because having such a severe case of acne causes unwanted attention constantly. ""Did you get punched in the face?"" _ ""Did you try to pierce your ears?"" My dermatologist mentioned side-effects such as depression_ and wanted me to notify him immediately if I had any feelings of increased depression. What anxiety / depression that occurred during the period_ it was caused by having the acne for so long already_ and in my opinion_ had nothing to do with the drug and did not increase during the treatment. I would highly recommend this drug.",M,24,3  months30mg 2X D,1/12/2012Email,Accutane

103, 1, acne,severe dry eyes_ eye irritation due to lack of oil in tear film_ dry tight facial skin_ weight loss.,Accutane cured my acne but I have been left with life long troublesome side effects. Most of them are due to the lack of oil produced in my skin and tear glands. Accutane works by shutting down your oil glands in your skin but also your eyes. Some doctors will tell you that you don't need the oil (sebum) but obviously god gave us this for some reason and I know why. My eyes are constantly irritated by environmental and other factors because I have no oily tear film and none of my meiobiam glands secrete oil. I can't even put into words how upset I am about this. I know accutane works by reducing the oil being secreted but I was never told that it was also happening to my eyes at the same time. I also know something happened to my digestive system or hormones because I lost 25 pounds while on accutane and have never been able to put on the lost weight in 18 years. So for me definately wouldn't take it again. Basically you are trading your health for clear skin.,M,44,5  months80 mg 1X D,12/6/2011Email,Accutane

Been on isotretinoin for about 9 weeks now (little over 2 months).

I had about 30-40 at one time and it was red_ a lot of hard ones and some with whiteheads that were ready to ooze out- it was so frustruating and hard for me.  To give you some idea on what my skin was like before this and why I decided to go on it: I struggled with my skin all my life.  I am 35 but look early 20s and usually_ most people think I have great skin because I am a full time model and I know how to cover them. I've always had stubborn acne that would take forever to go away or come up and when it did_ it would become a whitehead and I would either pop them myself to flatten them or go to a facialist and have them do it (which heals better and doesn't look as scabby and big)  But towards the end and right before starting isotretinoin_ my skin was hard to control. Esp. hiding it from my bookers and casting agents_ etc. was becoming impossible.  I knew if I didnt have this in control_ my career would be down the drain overnight.  I took a 'leave' from my work and took the plunge to take this controversial medication.  I did my research for months before this and knew exactly what I was getting into.

I have been into fitness since I was a kid and was truly in the best shape of my life.While on accutane I began to have joint pain in my knees_ shoulders and back. I increased my water intake and continued with my active life style. Within 6 months_ my knees were so bad I had to stop playing basketball. I went from jamming the ball to sitting on the bench. At 20 years old_ both shoulders hurt and my mid and low back began to give me trouble. At 21 my back was so bad I could not work and went back to school. Accutane drys your body out so much and your joints end up taking significant abuse. Now after 3 knee surguries and cortizone shots in my back to function_ I am living with joint pain beyond my years.

131, 1, Mild Acne,dry skin_ eyes_ reduced vision_ floaters_ dizzy spells_ panic attacks_ MAJOR depression(post-usage),Wow_ I feel a comraderie with the rest of the victims here whose lives have been devastated by this drug.  I am 42 yrs old_ and like many others_ took it in the mid-eighties when I was a junior in high school (16 yrs old).  I had a hypochondriacal mother who took myself_ my brother and sister to the dermatologist often because she wanted us to look perfect!(yes_ I partially blame her_ but I mostly blame the doctor and the evil pharm companies).  None of us had anything worse than mild to moderate acne_ mine being mild.  I thought it was amazing at first_ as it permanently rid me of acne.  However_ shortly after I started to have dizzy spells/panic attacks several times a day(in school_ nonetheless)_ and I slipped into a depression for which no one could figure out why.  I went to a semester of college_ dropped out_ and my father pretty much forced me to join the Army or get out of dodge(which was actually good for me).  However_ I have continued to have on and off bouts of depression and vision problems for the rest of my life.  I feel a common bond with the rest of you with similar issues.

I have been on the medicine for 3 months now and am starting to see great results. I had so severe chest pain in the first few weeks and my doctor said it was not from the medicine but something tells me it is. If you talk to your doctor about this medicine make sure you feel comfortable and trust them. I don't think my doctor is the best and he doesn't monitor my blood levels and says I don't have to have blood work done anymore_ which I find odd because my brother went on it(with a different doctor) and had blood drawn EVERY month. Other than a few bothersome things I have a lot of hope in this drug.,F,16,6  months80MG 1X D,3/7/2011,Accutane

135, 4, Acne,Dry lips_ dry/flaking skin_ eye irritation_ eyes ache and turned extremely red when wearing contacts_ reduced vision_ hair became dry and more curly. It is hard to say if I've had real psychological changes in mood or behavior due to the drug but I think it is possible.,I had acne for about 8 years solid and started taking Accutane (isotronin) at 23 years old. Previously_ no over the counter or prescription topical treatment or antibiotic worked. After a few weeks of accutane I stopped getting breakouts. In the 6 months of taking accutane I probably had under 5 new pimples_ versus that many each week or two prior. Immediately after starting accutane I had dry lips and skin. Be prepared to use plenty of lotion_ get something that is light_ non-oily_ includes vitamins and will absorb in your skin like Cetaphil or Eucerin_ and a quality non-oily lib-balm like Blistex. I am hoping the aching eyes and dry hair will go away after I stop treatment. Accutane is truly a miracle drug but all the side effects are worrisome. I recommend exhausting your options before starting this treatment.,M,24,6  months60mg 1X D,2/16/2011,Accutane

Everyone is DIFFERENT! Sure_ some people have had terrible reactions and others have had great success with the drug. Your body will react differently...I took 5 months of Isotretinoin (Clavaris) and saw fantastic results! Tried everything prior to my cycle_ AcneFree_ Proactiv_ creams_ gels_ etc. and nothing helped clear up my skin the way Accutane did. This drug has come such a long way. PLEASE just be sure to ask your doctor questions_ go for blood tests and pregnancy tests (if you're female) and watch yourself closely.

137, 4, Acne with open pores and bad skin,Very dry lips and dry facial skin especially around the mouth_ skin looked very wrinkly_ muscle pain towards the last month but otherwise I could cope with being on the drug. In the 3rd month I got chest pains under my ribs_ so painful but did not last long only a few days but it was scary_ I do believe it is one of the side effects.,I have just finished a 5 month course and can already see an improvement in my skin_ my pores have closed up but they are still small and I have small white spots under the skin on my cheeks and chin which have white pus in_ if I try to squeeze_ the pus comes out like a small worm but it marks my face as my skin is so thin_ so advised NOT to do this. I developed more lines and wrinkles around the mouth but now I have finished the course post 2 days I hope these are going to disappear as I do hope it is only the drying effect of the drug. I did not suffer all the side effects people write about_ my hair did get dry but it also got thicker and my make up stayed on my skin and eyes all day without smudging which was a blessing. I would recommend anyone to take these tablets if they have bad skin but I am glad I have finished the course as I never felt my face was my own_ I looked in the mirror all the time and became obsessed with how my skin and face was looking_ I was like a dried up prune most days and I went through endless bottles of moisturizing cream. There was many a days I said not going to take the drug any more but I carried on going and the time does go quite quick.

However_ at age 23 I still have bacne that never went away.  My face is pretty much clear with the occasional pimple.Now the bad.  Before starting_ I was a perfectly normal_ happy kid.  3.8 student_ lots of friends_ played select baseball.  Great upbringing_ never a worry in the world.  Aside from my acne_ things were seemingly perfect in life.  In a couple months I had developed depression and started getting angry at others very easily.  My mental health issues increased in number and severity as time went by.  After four months of taking Accutane_ I attempted suicide.  Massive overdose_ parents found me_ I woke up in the hospital.  I have been battling these issues for the past nine years now.  Just a couple years ago I began feeling ""normal"" again.Sure_ the drug works.

I was ecstatic that my acne was disappearing and I wasn't experiencing any of the severe side effects. Its been about 8 months post treatment and i am now becoming increasingly miserable by the day i have developed horrible anxiety_ depression_ mood swings_ and a racing heartbeat that is driving me absolutely insane! I'f i could change one thing in my life it would be ever taking this drug it could be one of the worst decisions in my life. I prey to GOD that my side effects will eventually dissipate. I will say i have had no outer extremity issues since stopping accutane end my acne has yet to return.

The doctors still don't know what's happened to my digestive system. When I go to the bathroom_ my stools are loose and basically resemble half-digested food in weird shades of nasty yellow and green. I feel tired even if I sleep for hours and hours straight. It hurts to work out. It's hard to see when I try to drive at night. I have problems focusing on school. I went from making A's to making D's.  I have scars from minor injuries and bug bites that wouldn't heal while I was on accutane. My speech slurs. My head hurts. My hair still falls out and it's thin and dry.

145, 4, cystic acne,Chapped lips_ dry skin_(later - back pains_ shoulder and elbow joint pains)_ hair thinning_ degenarative tissue,Accutane is really a miracle drug.  I took this drug about 14 years ago. I was on it for a year and then another round (for 3 months) after 2 years.  After taking it for 6 months_ I got many compliments how beautiful my skin was. Even without makeup on_ my skin was almost flawless. The joint pains in my elbow_ shoulder and lower back occured at different times: 2 years after taking accutane - right shoulder pain and I thought it was because of carrying a full-load purse; 5 years after - right elbow tendonitis; 8 yrs after - lower back pain and left leg pain due to degenerative tissues on my back bone.  About few months ago I noticed that my left elbow and should started to ache and the pains on the right elbow and shoulder came back. I was told by my physician that there is no cure for these pains but pain reliever pills and steroid injection. I opted for another alternative which was Physical Therapy. The exercise relieved the pain but it did not go away completely.   Also_ about a year ago_ I was diagnosed with gall bladder problem. Not sure though if this is associated with accutane too. However_ based on the postings in this web_ joint aches were always present. My advise for the joint pains_ undergo a Physical Therapy.  It helped. I read one posting here about taking vitamin D.  I will try that and hopefully will help.,F,46,1  years40 mg 2X D,11/30/2010Email,Accutane

I do experience some horrible stomach pain and back pain but its no worse then what feels like menstrual cramps. My mother was on accutane when she was 19 (25 years ago) and she has never had a problem with acne or anything else ever since_ so I don't exactly worry the accutane will give me problems down the line. To me_ its so worth it to take the drug and not have to deal with horrible painful cysts.

This is my THIRD go around with Accutane since starting my initial treatment in my late twenties. A 6 mo treatment seems to last me 8-10 years. My doctor stated my second treatment should keep my face clear until menopause and I shouldn't have any more acne....WRONG. My face got so bad in the last couple of years that it seemed like I was constantly on anti-biotics. I eat a healthy diet and exercise. At one time I had over 30 sores all over my face. Accutane was a last resort. I read all of the literature on the side effects and agreed to gamble with them..nothing was guaranteed except my face is CLEAR. It's been a month since I took my last dose and my side effects are extreme lower back pain_ peeling scalp_ eye sties_ mood swings (but that may be menopausal).,F,57,5  months30 mg 2X D,11/23/2010,Accutane
148, 1, Moderate acne on face and back,During treatment: Chapped lips and slightly dry skinMonths and years after: Consistent back pain_ hair thinning_ possible stunted growth_ bowel irritability_ bouts of depression and fatigue ... acne,14 when I was prescribed Accutane_ I thought it was a miracle drug while I was on it. Relatively no side effects_ all my blood tests came back with flying colours_ and I was seeing results_ so I stayed on it longer than most do. It wasn't until months after that I noticed my hair thinning_ which is hereditary in my mothers side_ but I take strongly after my father with a full head. Mild to moderate back pain started about a year after treatment_ and has not gone away today. I also suspect it might have hindered my growth as an adolescent_ both sides of my family are healthy giants_ men and women_ dad was the shortest of any of my immediate and distance relatives and he stood at 5'10. I'm 5'7_ skinny jointed_ small hands_ don't fit in with the rest of the family. I have bouts of inflamed and enlarged bowels_ but nothing was found in a stool sample so it's gone undiagnosed. I'm a very healthy_ active_ muscular man_ I am obsessed with eating well and the gym_ I shouldn't be in pain. On top of it all_ acne has returned_ not as severe and no longer of the back_ but that could just be the decline of puberty. I only wish I was smart enough to understand the negative effects of pharmaceuticals and the reason why the medical industry makes as much money as it does... This drug isn't to cure people_ it's to make them more sick.

149, 2, Cystic Acne & Oily Skin,"Taken when I was 24_ I took Sotret on 1st month & ""brand name"" Accutane for months 2-5.  Side effects at first: nausea_ loss of appetite_ blurred vision_ swollen dry cracked lips_ dry mouth_ feminine dryness.  After 2 months: high cholesterol_ joint stiffness_ & muscle pain.  On 5th month: insomnia_ auditory & visual hallucinations_ anxiety_ anger_ confusion_ heart palpitations_ severe hair loss_ thinning of the skin_ muscle pain_ night blindness.  I thought stress was causing all of these problems_ but it was due to Accutane_ so the doctor taken off of it since they attributed it to toxic brain effects.  Long term: muscle pain_ dry lips_ insomnia_ heart palpitaions_ impaired wound healing_ reduced night vision_ acne scars.  Some hair grew back but not all_ thinning of the skin was permanent.",Still get occasional zits_ but Acne is gone_ skin not as oily.  I was really depressed about my skin_ and the cystic acne was really painful_ but I wouldn't recommend this medication ... the benefits don't outweight the toxic side effects.  Took over 2 weeks for the brain side effects to subside.  Apparently I wasn't supposed to be put on this medication in the first place_ since I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).  I also think my dose was too high ... I have low body fat & drug is fat soluble... it should be dosed on fat percentage_ not actual body weight.  & FYI: I actually had less side effect on Sotret (the generic) than Accutane.

150, 1, acne,Accutane has more long term side effects that go along with the depression and anger.  My brother was on accutane when he was between 16 and 19.  He became a very angry person.  He was irritable and had thoughts of suicide.  He is now 40 years old and his depression_ irritability and anger have not gone away.

Bloodshot eyes and some joint pain where my body receives the most impact from running_ cycling_ weight training_ etc.  Can feel like a stimulant to me and will keep me awake if I take the second dosage too late.,I think accutane is truly a miracle drug for acne. I have never had cystic acne in my life until I turned 38. And to go from beautifully clear skin to horribe acne cysts and redness with scarring was awful. I tried every alternative before I tried accutane_ but developed sensitivity to some antibiotics.  I have not had any serious issues with the drug except a mild version the side effects I listed. Also_ the treatment plan on accutane is only 5 months on the meds whereas antibiotics can be long term. The other purpose of the blood draw_ is to check triglyceride levels which can put a person at risk for high cholesterol.  So_ if those numbers are too high a patient should be immediately yanked off the drug. I am older and very healthy_ so there was no change in those numbers for me. I have also spoken to some friends who have also been on accutane.  They have not had any lasting side effects and it has been several years later for them. If anyone reading this cannot get rid of their acne and is healthy_ I recommend investigating this drug.  Possibly some (not all)of these reviews written about this drug are perhaps being posted by the firms who are interested in trying to sue the pharmaceutical companies who manufacture this drug. They are specifically trying to sue for ulcerative colitis and Intestinal bowel syndrome_ of which I have had not one problem with my intestines.  Understandably_ as with any other drug there can be some dangerous side effects for some people.,F,41,5  months30 mg 2X D,11/13/2010,Accutane
152, 4, acne on face_ back_ chest,None that I recall,I took accutane_ the first round_ for 6 months when I was 12/13 - in 1995/6 - I did not have any side effects then that I recall.  It cleared my skin. However about 3-4 years after I took accutane I had recurrences of acne. I went back to the dermatologist and he recommended a 3 month treatment to re-enact the drug benefits. I recall him saying that once you had done the full treatment_ another full treatment would not be needed (not so sure if that is true). So I did that_ cleared acne. NO side affects again.I do have occasional stomach acid pain_ but nothing as described in the various lawsuits_ and it is probably more genetics than anything (father has issues)_ but I have not been checked or anything.I am now 27 - and have had problems with acne again for the past_ 3-4 years. My dermatologist ( a different one) has recommended a full 6 month treatment of accutane again. I will likely start the new round in a few weeks. However_ i must say that although my acne is bad_ it is nothing close to being as bad as it was when i was 12/13  (very little on chest/back_ mainly cyst/blackhead on face).  I should also note that I have been under a considerable amount of new stress the past 3-4 years (law school) so it is likely this brought on a new onset of acne (makes sense). I am nervous reading about all these side affects_ but I do not seem to have had any side effects from it (at this point).,F,27,6  months40 MG 2X D,11/11/2010Email,Accutane

With this drug you need impeccable nutrition.  I wonder if the studies on the negative effects even addressed nutrition.

Mild eczema on my arms and thighs_ mental and physical exhaustion. I had sore joints (knees especially) at the start of treatment but it went back to normal around the 3 month mark. Sun damage is a bad one_ I went out in Winter with sunblock on with a long sleeved top on while it was raining and still managed to get sunburned_ rare for me usually in those circumstances.,It's been 4 weeks now since I have finished my first course of Accutane and I don't have any of the side effects I had while on it_ except for the slight eczema on my hands. But I would choose mild eczema on my hands than cystic acne on my face any day. I started out with cystic acne on my face which responded to no other medicine. My skin is completely clear now and I think this drug is Amazing_ my confidence has gone up so much since being on it.

(Hopefully that will subside once treatment is over.),I have only been on accutane about 3 months. Accutane has cured almost all of my acne so far. I had severe acne on my arms and shoulders and also my back. My face wasn't awful_ but not pleasant. Accutane has done amazing. I couldn't wear cute shirts or anything that showed my arms_ back_ etc. I am 15 and I am very active_ I cheer_ play softball & powerlift. I have numerous friends who have taken it & there skin is flawless. I have about 2 more months of treatment_ to me accutane has been worth it. I take one pill a day and the next day take two in that pattern. Yes_ in the beginning it was a bit of a hassel going to the gynocologist_ preg.tests_ & getting blood taken. If you asked me I would say GO FOR IT_ but if you have awful side effects_ it's kind of your own fault because you should've known of the possibilites. :),F,15,3  months40 MG 2X D,9/28/2010Email,Accutane

I am almost done with my 3rd month of treatment and still no cysts. I do have scaring from years ago messing with my acne.

After 2 months after coming off of this drug I started to notice my hair shedding and it has since continued. I was a very healthy and active before taking accutane and now I'm very worried for my future. The constant worry and stress has started to make me very depressed.

I was a healthy nurse working full-time_ taking care of 2 small children_ and kept an immaculate house. THEN_ ACCUTANE RUINED MY LIFE! I haven't been able to nurse full-time or work full-time for that matter. I can no longer walk long distances b/c the back and joint pain is so SEVERE. I've been taking arthritis and pain meds for years now. Every time I try to come off_ the pain is absolutely unbearable. I manage if I take my meds and be as active as the pain will allow. I also have a bladder disease_ poor eyesight and thinning hair. This med is like chemo; it ages your entire body. My skin looks 10 years older than I am_ and I still have acne!

Make sure you wear sun protection while on Accutane - it will really make a difference in the quality of your skin during and after you stop taking it. You could get some pretty gnarly sunburns (and brown sun spots) if you don't use it. Accutane cleared me up after one month of taking it . . . which leads me to suspect I may have a vitamin A deficiency (only because I don't eat enough A and get too much sun on my face)! Now that I am off Accutane and am on Spironolactone for maintenance_ I am taking 20_000 mg vitamin A a day and wearing lots of sun protection! Yay!,F,20,5  months20 mg 3X D,8/1/2010,Accutane

No acne is bad enough to expose yourself to this substance. I took this 6 years ago_ and I never even finished a course because I got so sick. My immune system was destroyed_ and I picked up every virus or bacteria out there. It started out with chronic sinus infections_ then got the flu_ then was just sick all the time with whatever. I had to retake my last year of highschool because of this. A few years later I was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Now it's six years later and I am in constant pain_ I can't eat any foods I like anymore_ and I'm nearly almost always depressed or angry. I can't afford hospital bills_ and I've lost my motivation to do much of anything. Every day is a struggle. If you have read peoples experiences the with the drug and still think it's worth it to get rid of your acne_ try and remember there can be life long consequences.

The process of taking the medicine was a pain (monthly exams_ pregnancy test_ birth control_ blood tests_ sign up for the IPledge program) but the end result was so worth it.  It is wonderful to have my face back_ not constant soreness and bleeding.  Of course I have some scaring from the years of acne but I am very pleased with the result.  I would not recommend this to anyone with regular acne_ only very severe cystic acne.  I would recommend only as a last result but I have not had any long term side effects and I only get an occasional normal pimple(not a large cyst)now and then.,F,32,4  months? 2X D,7/19/2010,Accutane

Dry and chapped skin and dry hair_ very tired_ felt poisoned every time the dose went up_ increased cholesterol levels_ skin crawling_ sleeping problems - tired but could not sleep with crawling skin - lead to exhaustion.,So it is now a 8 months since I finished my Accutane course.  As per the side effects it is very serious medicine_ and I was very lucky all the side effect were gone within a month of finishing the accutane_ but believe me it is like poison in your system.  However for me this was a miracle drug_ it was like having a skin transplant to pretty_ normal skin which I have not had since puberty_ I am full of confidence and very happy with the result.  I could not recommend it highly enough and if your skin is bad enough you will try it anyhow_ just wish I had over ruled my doctor and taken it years ago_ honestly.  It is very strong medication_ and I am as healthy as a horse_ so if you are an unhelathy person anyhow would not advise it.

I'm at the top of my class in high school and I started to struggle near the end of school. I couldn't remember things as well as I normally do. I don't think memory loss is permanent_ but I'm positive accutane messes with the brain. Recently my friends catch me zoning out during conversations. I swear I'm almost A.D.D. now.

Anyone on a higher 60 or 80 mg dose needs to speak to their doctor about lowering it to 20 or 40. The dose does not determine your results_ the length of time you are on it does. A lower dose over a longer time would eliminate 90% of the griping and complaining on here. Yeah I do get sore joints and occasionally a sore back. I take fish oil and vitamin D and that helps a ton.

I had cystic acne from about age 10 to age 35 when it became available in the mid-1980s.  It totally cleared my skin and helped me physically and emotionally.  It has been many years since I took Accutane_ and my skin is totally clear and it helped the quality in terms of reducing scarring_ pores and general appearance.  People actually compliment my skin_ which_ for those of us who suffered so much is amazing.  The first time someone complimented me (who didn't know me before treatment)_ I looked behind me to see who they were talking to and there was no one there.  This drug is well worth all the precautions.  I felt fine while taking it because my skin cleared within a short period of time.

The joint_ muscle and back pain started soon after treatment ended. I never associated the pains to the medication until recently after reading what others have stated. I knew the thinning hair and other side effects were the result of the medication and figured it was worth it. Knowing now that the back_ joint and muscle pains are most likely due to taking the medication I would not take Accutaine again if I could do it over again. The worst part is that my son took the medication at age 17 and he started having back pain (disc related). He regrets taking Accutaine and I regret encouraging him to take it.,F,58,  1X D,6/7/2010,Accutane

I think I took it once or twice a day but was told that it was critically important to not miss doses and to totally stay out of the sun. I do not know how else I would have cleared up the cystic acne I developed in mid twenties. It totally cured the issue to this day.

188, 3, Acne,I started the accutane course when i was 17 1/2 due to my very bad skin that posed a scarring threat on my cheeks. Even after the first week I had tremendous results- inflammation decreased and white/blackheads disappeared. As my treatment went on_ the side effects became apparent. Suicidal thoughts_ severe depression_ moodiness_ dry everything_ etc. My skin cleared up even more as my dosage was doubled to 80mg. The second checkup brought alarming results- my creatine production in my kidneys was dangerously high. I was referred to a nephrologist only to discover that both my kidneys were working at 70% normal function. I was very frustrated but nonetheless I stopped the treatment. This was when things got worse. Two weeks after I stopped taking accutane_ I became severely depressed and angry. I made my girlfriend cry almost every day and we were on thin ice. But the thing that troubled me most was my sex drive. Before my accutane treatment everything was fine_ my girlfriend and I woul,I have been off accutane for almost two months now and I am still experiencing problems. It seems as if every other week i'm horny_ and others I am not at all. I feel very awkward_ as I am young and i'm used to feeling horny all the time_ and getting up never used to be an issue before I started treatment. I've decided that I need to see a doctor about this issue to receive any type of treatment or advice on how I can get back on track. I really want to return to my normal state as sex is very important to me. Please email me if you have any questions or advice on this matter. From my experience using this drug_ I would not recommend it as the after-effects outweigh the benefits of clear skin. My sex life is much more important than my skin and I know there are other routes you can take other than accutane (Retin-A).,M,17,2  monthsup to 80mg 1X D,5/7/2010Email,Accutane
189, 5, Severe facial/ bodily acne,Nothing thus far..,I'll just start by saying that no I have not been on it for a long enough time to know whether I experience negative side effects/ which ones I experience_ but this is my logic with the drug: All medications that are prescribed have severe possible side effects_ they all share many of the same ones. You are VERY likely to experience the minor ones from accutane (chapped lips_ dry skin/ mouth/ eyes/ nose_ joint pain_ headaches_ etc.) because you are being dehydrated by the drug. My belief is that people assume that since people usually experience THOSE side effects_ that you are more likely to experience ALL of them. Everyone reacts differently to ANY drug_ so that's why some people have had incredibly bad experiences with accutane_ however_ it has obviously worked for many other people too. What should be taken into account is the ratio of success to failures using this drug_ that is how people should form their opinions. Everyone is entitled to an opinion_ and that is mine.,F,19,2  days40mg 1X D,5/2/2010,Accutane

I made it through high school with no acne and developed moderate acne at the age of 18. I am a model/actor/student and the acne was a night mare_ absolutely horrible on my self-esteem and confidence! I tried several prescribed meds with no help. I was aware of Accutane through close friends who took it & I was fearful of it even though they did have amazing results from it however sites like this one scared me. Finally my acne got to where it was very painful and intolerable_ at that point my Dermatologist recommended Accutane and I was now willing. I am highly involved in sports and only experienced occasional hip & chest pain in the 2nd month of taking_ I believe_ 40mg/day. I had not noticed any other aches or pains except those natural to the workouts & conditioning I do. My dry lips and dry skin are tolerable w/ the constant use of AquaPhor_ (found at Walgreens). When starting Accutane my doctor started me at a low dose and upped it each visit until the 3rd month when she upped it 70mg /day it finally worked. The 2nd & 3rd month I had a huge acne flare-up!

I have this month left and maybe one more (TBD)_ for a total of 6 months. My doctor has me taking one dose Sat/Sun/Tues/Thurs and two doses (morning and night) M/W/F. So far it has cleared up most of the painful acne cysts I use to have constantly. It is not completely clear but it is much better than when I started. I know this treatment is not for everyone but for me so far it has been fine. I have had to cut down on the time and mileage I spend at the gym per-week due to the stiffness and pain in my ankles and hip. To any one considering beginning this treatment I'd say give it a shot.

When I decided to begin it_ I had 3 concerns that I'd heard/read about and I said that if any of these came true_ I would stop Accutane. 1) That I'd gain weight 2) That I'd kill myself 3) That my hair would fall out. None of these came true. It is great stuff. I wanted flawless skin and Accutane gave it to me. I don't have to wear primer_ foundation_ powder_ nothing. I wonder if all these people on here complaining about it didn't already have pre-existing tendencies that Accutane had no part whatsoever in causing? Like back pain. I had back pain before Accutane. I still have back pain while on Accutane. But Accutane did not cause my back pain. Also_ I have been slightly lethargic and moody while taking it. But it has been winter and everyone gets a little gloomier during wintertime. The bottom line is that I am a young woman in college and therefore_ I care what I look like. I am more than willing to put up with the side effects I'm experiencing in exchange for never worrying about disgusting cysts ever again.

(Supposedly hair thinning is only seen in male patients 40+ yrs. old who are already balding_ but I have my suspicions that mine was caused by the Accutane) My dermatologist promised that all the side effects would be temporary and that I would be back to normal 30 days after treatment...so we'll see!,F,24,5  months80mg. 1X D,4/3/2010,Accutane

199, 1, acne,Joint pain_ back pain_ chest pain_ very tired_ anger_ dry lips_ dry face_ redness in face.,Okay so I am 19 years old in college and just started accutane 10 days ago. I really thought I wouldn't have any side effects since I have taken a lot of other supplements whether for lifting or acne. After only ten days I started to have pretty bad joint and back pain. I am in good physical shape and lifting is a must for me. I have never had any joint or muscle pain before taking accutane. The last two times lifting it hurt just to lift from how bad the back and joint pain was. My acne has started to go away_ and only have a few pimples on my face. I think I am going to stop taking the medication though because I am not willing to have permanent joint pain for the rest of my life. Also I have been extremely tired_ taking naps all the time which I usually am very energetic. And also very angry for no reason_ feels like I want to punch something over any little thing. Unless your acne is really really bad do not start this_ the side effects are no joke. I think I am going to go back to using Differin_ all though it did not cure my acne it at least didnt make me feel like a 80 year old man with all my joint pains. I think I can deal with a little bit of acne rather than going through all of these side effects. Try It_ but if you have these symptoms I would stop right away.,M,19,12  days40 mg 1X D,3/31/2010,Accutane

I was hesitant to start_ but now that I just finished treatment_ I'm worried to stop! Unfortunately_ there is the initial worsening of the skin within the first few weeks. However_ as you stay on treatment_ you learn to cope with the symptoms. As a college student_ it was such a godsend to_ for once_ NOT have to worry about my skin_ AND I could get away with not showering for a few days because of the lack of oils. To combat the dryness on my face_ I used light soap and moisturizers (Cetaphil worked great). I was inseparable from my tube of Carmex.

The first round cleared up my back and shoulders but it took another round to clear the cystic acne on my face. The only thing I do remember was the dryness and sensitivity to the sun.

I would like to hear feedback on how the medicine has affected females and their hormones.  I think that rather than losing hair it has messed mine and my daughter's hormones up and has caused an increase in thicker/darker body hair especially arms and chin.

220, 5, moderate-severe acne,chapped lips_ dry skin,I took 60mg of accutane for 10 months_ 8 years ago.  It was the only thing that worked with my skin after years of other medications.  I was highly involved in sports at the time and noticed no aches or pains except those natural to the workouts and conditioning I was doing.  Even my chapped lips and skin were't that bad.  (I remember my doctor starting me at the lowest dose and upping it each visit until the 60mg dosage finally worked.  And trust me_ it was really obvious which dosage 'worked'.  She said that a number of other doctors begin with high dosages and adjust from there_ but the building up from a lower doseage was supposed to help combat some of the dryness and ensure I was using the lowest dosage possible for my skin). Anyway_ I've been acne-free ever since.  I still have dry skin (nothing a good moisturizer doesn't help)_ but have not had acne since (I can literally count on one hand the pimples I've had in the last 8 years).  Accutane for me was a life-saver.  My flawless skin (that I receive a number of compliments on being that I'm SNOW white_ so any blemish would show) is the only indication of my time on this drug.

No lasting side effects.I took it again at age 40 but noticed severe joint pain_ and discontinued after two months. I am taking it again at age 52 for the occasionall hormonal flair up and again have severe joint pain. I am slim_ very active_ work out_ eat pretty well_ don't smoke. The joint pain will go away once I stop the dug. For the other reviewers_ please know they may not be revealing anything else about their lives: do they smoke? Drink? Take other drugs? Symptoms are different with each person and it's hard to say Accutane caused this or that. It might be_ but other things may also be affecting ther symptoms.  I know it is giving me joint pain_ but every time I stopped it_ I went back to working out_ running_ being in good shape.

Ended up in hospital with 10% chance of life_ was in high dependency and was told I can never drink again for the rest of my life...being a young fella I still had the odd drink when I was out and again I have taken Pancreaitis twice more_ the doctors have told me there is only a certain number of times I can take this again before there will be nothing more they can do for me_ my life is more important to me so I stay away from having a sociable drink now which is hard because I'm only a young man but I'm getting married soon so life is more important.  My Fiancee has been perscribed Roaccutane and I have talked her out of taking it_ it's a serious drug_ if I could turn back time I wouldn't take it again_ my life has been ruined by this drug_ Pancreaitis is a side effect of this drug!,M,25,4  months,11/27/2009,Accutane
228, 3, Acne,I took accutane three years ago_ it could be the biggest regret of my life. While on it_ it was not bad at all. I used blistex DCT for my lips it worked very well. Anyway treatment ended and I still had some acne_ but 75% of it cleared up. The doc tried to put me on another 4 months but I turned it down_ thank god. Exactly 1 YEAR LATER I developed eczema. It started on my thighs and behind my legs. A few months later it was on my face right around my eye lids. I got steroid creams to combat it  but they only helped a little bit. The following winter the same thing happened. Now it is November and my exczema will be back for the winter of 09/10. I regret accutane_ it ruind by body but I'm lucky it hurt some other people out there worse then me.,If you value your body please do not take this. I took it three years ago and I am still hurting from the side effects. It cleared 75% of my acne up but it wasn't worth it to go through what I'm going through now. I have not taken a hot shower in 2 years.,M,21,6  months,11/23/2009Email,Accutane

I used the Accutane for the ""recommended"" time period. Afterwards_ the side affects have ""haunted"" me since_ without a cure or any releif I would strongly suggest you do not take Accutane.",M,31, ,11/22/2009,Accutane

Its been 3 years since I stopped using ACCUTANE and i have received so many compliments on how beautiful my skin is_ i never thought my nasty pizza face would ever look so good. HOWEVER--SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS: you have to be lotioning yourself religiously_ otherwise you will have nasty dry patches that begin to bleed from the severe dryness_ my lips suffered the most_ i looked like a crack addict. However_ always carry around AQUAPHOR_ it worked the best on my horrible dry spots. Also you will have angry fits of rage_..be careful!

Mentally I felt great while on it.,Face was 99% clear while on it_ but started breaking out again as soon as I quit taking it four months later (not as bad as pre-accutane.) The main problem is immediately after I stopped taking it I suddenly developed chronic diarrhea and severe neck pain which I still have over one year later.  Would not take again or recommend for those reasons.  My neck is killing me!,F,39,4  months,11/4/2009,Accutane

233, 3, acne that would not go away,Im 21 now and I took Accutane in 2004-2006-ish and my skin dried up like a desert.  I had oily skin tobegin with but now_ its all dry.  Every little thing I touched that was remotely sharp_ i would get a gash in my skin from and going to get my eye brows waxed?! Forget it!!!  I am still trying to find a lotion that actually works_ Ive been using Gold Bond healing with Aloe and I need something different soon cuz my body is getting used to it (like it did with the Curel and the vasaline lotions and the Aveeno and Jergins and Johnson and Johnson.)  Be careful with accutane_ if you have dry skin already_ either do not take it or be prepared to spend a lot on moisturizers( I recommend starting out with either Aveeno or Gold Bond)!! And for women on the medicine_ get men's disposable razors_ they dont have the moisturizing strips that will actually make your skin worse (my MAJOR problem area is my legs and arms)  I would definitely proceed with caution with this medication!,,F,21,1.5  years,11/2/2009Email,Accutane

More breakouts experienced within first couple of weeks of treatment.,I have been on the 60 mg dose for about 2 weeks now and have been handling it quite well. My dermatologist had warned me that dry skin would occur and muscle soreness may also occur. So far_ I have not experienced any muscle or joint soreness but I have noticed my eyes and scalp to be very dry and itchy. I haven't had any hair loss_ but I can tell you_ I have wanted to rip my hair out with how itchy my scalp has been. Lips have been a bit chapped but I have been using Burt's Bees which pretty much has knocked that out. My tummy has gotten a bit sore more than often and I have experienced a little constipation_ I will try to drink more water. Everyone has different side effects when taking this medicine; I wouldn't assume that everything you read will happen to you. I haven't seen too much of a difference_ in fact_ my acne has gotten worse within the first week and a half_ but it's starting to clear.,F,23,2  weeks,10/23/2009,Accutane
237, 4, Mild Acne- Hated The Blackheads,I have only been on this treatment for 2 weeks and i am feeling rough. My twin sister was on this for 6 months last year and only experienced the basics side affects that everyone seems to get no matter what...extremely dry lips & face and the occasional mood swing. However she was started on a lower dose then me even though her acne was alot worse. I thought id be fine but im really not. I have upper back pain most of the time and the occasional chest pain. I get blurred vision and my eyes are killing me! Headaches on and off and im tired alot of the time_which doesnt change much actually as i do shift work but it is making it hard. Im definately not coming off the medication as i know it works but i know its gonna be difficult. Im just hoping that these are all i get. I can handle mood swings and the dry lips & face_ just not the constant pain and the headaches.,I would still recommend it as not everyone gets the same problems....my twin is the prime example.....she sailed through!!! She looks radiant and i hate her for it! :-P My sister is just generelly better now_ psycially and mentally then she has ever been.,F,20, ,10/22/2009,Accutane
238, 4, Acne from severe to moderate,Dry lips_ dry skin_ lethargy and headaches.,This drug seems to be working very well - I have put off taking it for about 18 years or so. I have pimples every day but nowhere as bad as they used to be. My skin is almost clear except for a single pimple and ever present blackheads. When I started taking it_ I already had a history of depression and Irritable Bowel Syndrome but it seems as if the aforementioned conditions have not be aggravated by this. I find that taking a B Complex with Vitamin C & 1000iu Vitamin E help with the side effects. Always take the pill with a meal and a full glass of liquid. I have also been using Bio Oil for dryness and scars. I am on a low dose 20mg so maybe that could explain the lack of severe side effects. I have been able to exercise and wear my contact lenses throughout the month or so that I have been taking it. I will see what the future effects are & I have been so afraid to take this drug because of the side effects but nobody that I know who has taken this drug has any of these long term side effects so maybe it depends on the luck of the draw. Good luck to all those taking it but I really think that this should be a last resort...,F,28,1.5  months,10/9/2009,Accutane
239, 5, severe acne,dry skin_ lips_ nose; small rash on the back of my hands,Wow! This drug has helped me a lot.  I have been taking accutane for about a month and within the 2nd week I noticed an improvement in my skin.  I am still taking this drug and everyday my face has cleared up more.  Yes it does make your whole body dry you will need lots of chapstick.  I reccomend aquaphor.  Recently I have noticed a small rash with little red bumps on the back of my hand.  This is a common side effect and these bumps go away with mosturizing lotion.  I reccommend using this drug if your acne is affecting you life.  I have a lot more confidence because my skin is clearer and it will continue to improve.  Thank you accutane!!!,F,16,1  months,10/7/2009,Accutane
240, 5, Mild acne,dry nose_ chapped lips_ stiff and sometimes painful joints_ irritable bowel syndrome,I had suffered from acne ever since I was 12 years old and could not find any way to control it until I went to a dermatologist that prescribed Accutane.  Be aware that this should be a last resort drug_ which it definitely was for me after over 10 years of trying every other acne treatment known to man. I was prescribed 30 mg a day and after 2 weeks saw great improvement to my complexion.  After about 8 months of treatment my face is so smooth and clear with maybe one small pimple while menstruating and even then it heals incredibly fast.  You'll experience excessive dryness first_ but that can be combated with the help of Vaseline and Blistex.  After about a month my lower back became sore_ but it's mostly my feet now that cause me pain when I walk.  It's not a debilitating pain_ but the first few steps in the morning do hurt quite a bit. After about 6 months on the drug I began suffer from a very mild case of irritable bowel syndrome.  I've just stopped taking Accutane and in a matter of days all of my side effects have disappeared.,,26,8  months,9/30/2009,Accutane
241, 1, severe acne,Fatigue_ vomiting_ loss of appetite_ severe liver problems_ overall pains and aches,I took this medication in 2004 after spending four years trying to combat my severe acne. I went from one week being a healthy teenager to feeling like an old woman. I could barely keep anything down and lost my hunger for several months during and after usage. I was so fatigued and weak that I could barely sit at the computer. Bi-weekly blood tests showed that my liver count went from a healthy number of 5 to close to 1000. Needless to say I went off of it after a month. Worse_ is that after six months of being off of the medication_ my acne came back with full force and has been with me ever since. To this day_ not only do I still have trouble with my acne_ but I have joint pain_ chronic dry skin_ and I recently noticed that my hair is thinning in spots. I didn't originally correlate these side effects to the Accutane_ but after reading the other comments_ it's making me second-guess myself.,F,23,2  months,9/29/2009,Accutane
242, 4, Back Acne,Dry Eyes_ Dry Lips_ Cracked Lips_ Dry Nose_ Hip Paint_ Back Pain,I am on my 5.5 month of 6 months on Accutane for back acne.  My back looks amazing_ before it would constantly bleed from zits popping open.  My wife says she feels like she is cheating on me when she rubs my back because it had never been smooth : )  I am praying my side effects go away quickly.  The worst has been hip and back pain in my 4th and 5th month.  If I sit for a while or sleep and try to get up it is a killer.  My Dermatologist said those are all side effects that should disipate quickly.  The dry lips and nose have been terrible_ but I wanted to say I have tried over 5 kinds of chapstick_ most stink.  However_ my Dermatologist put me on Chop Saver chap stick and my lips have been great ever since.  One tube only lasts me about 3 weeks but this has been a lifesaver.  I also put vaseline in my nose every other day_ otherwise it is so dry it becomes very painful.  The vaseline has worked well_ I can tell if I miss two days.  Lastly_ the Cracked lips were really bad in the beginning_ and once they crack_ good luck healing them_ so when I told my Doc about this_ he gave me a prescription cream for it to apply 2x a day to the corner of my lips.  They healed in two days and as long as you apply_ the cracking won't come back.,M,36,5.5  months,9/25/2009,Accutane

Trouble sleeping.,I believe reading comments and possible side effects increased the negative effects I am experiencing.  Some are very real but some are psychosomatic and have been managed by positive thinking.  This drug would not be legal if it was detrimental to everyone so do not become overly paranoid like I did.  It is important to monitor side effects and stop taking isotretinoin immediately if they become serious.  However_ this drug has helped millions of people without severe side effects so take this into consideration before freaking out.,M,34,36  days,9/6/2009,Accutane
246, 4, moderate to severe lifelong acne,Very dry lips_ dry nose causing nosebleeds_ dry eyes_ SEVERE lower back pain,Accutane definitely cleared up my acne.  2 months after discontinuing usage_ I am still 100% acne-free.  Aquaphor became my best friend while I was on Accutane.  I tried several things for my dry nose_ but not much really helped.  My nose would get so dry and clogged up at night that I usually slept with my mouth open - not very comfortable.  Those side-effects were manageable.  My biggest problem was the lower back-pain.  It was not a muscle pain.  It was a spinal pain.  This began about 3 weeks after starting Accutane.  I was very active and was training for a marathon.  This came to an abrubt halt.  I had to stop playing golf_ riding a bike_ almost all physical activity.  Even walking was painful.  This lasted for the entire course of treatment.  I went to a couple of different doctors_ tried physical therapy_ took Meloxicam daily_ and nothing seemed to help.  The pain spiked at the beginning and then very gradually got better.  It started getting better very quickly after finishing the course of treatment.  Two months after finishing treatment_ my back feels ALMOST back to normal.  I have started lifting weights and biking again with no major problems.  Hopefully I can start running again soon.,M,36,5  months,9/4/2009,Accutane
247, 5, Severe lifelong acne_ cystic,Aching joints_ like arthritis_ extremely stiff getting up or down_ sitting or standing_ but once motoring okay.  Dry and chapped skin and dry hair_ very tired_ feel poisoned every time the dose goes up_ increased cholesterol levels_ skin heebie jeebies_ sleeping problems - tired but could not sleep with crawling skin - lead to exhaustion.,This is extreme medication_ my doctor did not mess about and told me this.  But I had extreme acne under control for most of my life but had exhausted every other cure and as a woman was really suffering from self esteem issues as it got worse_ went down my back and chest and shoulders_ my face could be used to frighten small children_ and it always got worse under stress.  The Accutane was like poison in my system_ I feel sore and tired as if I am dragging myself around the whole time_ eyes_ skin hair nose ears dried out_ vaseline my best friend....but the bottom line is it is a miracle cure for my skin and I can face the world again and smile at it_ I am in my sixth month of taking accutane and my skin is wonderful_ it was like getting a skin transplant.  If it stays like this and the side effects go away it will have been well_ well worth the six months of hard work.  Will come back in six months time and update.,F,42,5  months,9/2/2009,Accutane
248, 4, acne vulgaris,EXTREMELY CHAPPED LIPS!! dry skin in general_ irritability_ intolerance to contact lenses due to dry eye,Lesions worsened during the first 2 months or so and my skin looked worse than it ever had before which was frustrating. Began to clear up and was smooth sailing for the next 3 months of treatment. I suffered from severe acne on my chest and back_ and now it is completely gone. I have extremely oily skin so during treatment it was so nice to not have to wash my face and hair all the time. Within 2 weeks of ending_ my skin was back to super oily again_ which is disappointing. Looking back_ I think my mood was affected_ as I was very mean to my boyfriend during that time! Lesions popping up here and there_ but overall I am happy I took this drug. People were constantly commenting on how incredible my skin looked. I will probably do another course to try and combat the oiliness though. Be patient with side effects_ they do get better.,M,22,5  months,9/1/2009,Accutane
249, 4, Severe acne,When taking accutane I experienced very very chapped lips_ dry itchy skin_ peeling skin_ thinning hair ( fell out in hand fulls)_ blurred vision (while on accutane I developed astigmatism and had to get special contacts_ this later went away)_ flash headaches -this happened at least twice  a day_ a sharp blinding pain behind my eyes that lasted about 5 seconds then went away_ last but not least I was extremely angry and aggressive. I was constantly frustrated and annoyed_ I was either yelling or crying. I also had kidney stones 5 years after taking the drug...I am not sure if it could have been caused by accutane.,It works_ but it is a very strange drug and you should make sure that you communicate all symptoms to your doctor.,F,21,8  months,9/1/2009,Accutane

I got my first nose bleed today_ that's how I ended up on this site.  My acne is horrible right now and all I can do is hope that this is the process.  I was warned that it would get worse_ after the increase in dose it has really started effecting me.  I would reccomend this if you have acne_ but don't expect an overnight miracle.  I was getting facials once a week and only buying the BEST products for my face_ I also tried everything the Dr had to prescribe.  I have spent so much $ over the last 5 years trying to clear my skin and this is the first one to give me some hope.,F,26,7  weeks,8/26/2009,Accutane
251, 5, Garden variety acne,Permanently chapped lips_ permanently dried out eyelids and inside of nose.  Eyelids and nose were not dry until 26 years after finishing accutane therapy. Eyelids are so dry that I cannot even open them at night.   I had no other side effects and was happier after taking accutane because I was unhappy with daily pimples on my face--it really got rid of the pimples.  I do think the combination of the permanent accutane effect and natural skin dryness due to aging created the painful eyelid and nostril condition I now have.,I took 60mg per day of accutane for 4 months in the fall of 1982 and again for 4 months in the fall of 1983.  It was extremely effective on my acne.  I have never seen another pimple.  It caused the hair on my legs to permanently fall out too.  I was not unhappy to see the leg hair disappear.   My lips were permanently chapped since I took it in 1983. I had no eyelid or nose dryness till 2007.  Unfortunately_ now I have permanent eyelid dryness and extreme dryness inside my nose.  My doctor of internal medicine is baffled as to why my nostrils are so extremely dried out. Accutane is my only guess.   My ophthalmologist said the glands adjacent to my eyelashes have permanently failed.  I think the accutane may have caused this because it permanently affected the skin all over my body.  It is a really effective drug for acne--it works.  However_ you must be prepared to live with permanent side effects because it has a permanent affect on your skin everywhere.,F,47,8  months,8/19/2009,Accutane

Litterally never had bad acne since I took 40mg over 3 months at the age of 17.  I did notice that my hair was thinning after the treatment was completed.  I had thiick brown hair before the treatment and afterwards noticed my scalp showing on the top of my head.  Both sides of my family have MPB in the genes so I figure that becoming bald is inherent_ but I am positive that accutane sped this process.  I also remember tennis matches having to wear a knee brace after treatment to deal with knee pain.  Apparantly the oils your skin excreets to moisturize your skin also lubricates your joints.  I feel real bad for the people who suffered life dehibilitating conditions from this drug and I am scared for my two little sisters (and myself) who also was treated with accutane.  FDA is full of individuals who have conflicts of interest which is why drugs like vioxx and accutane have been passed for consumer usage.  I am scared for what long term effects this drug may have on me but it's kind of silly trying to change the past.  I am just going to be more vigilant about modern medicine.  Humanity has walked the face of the earth for thousands perhaps millions of years and have survived just fine up to this point without the help of cheaply made toxic pharmacauticals.

I suffered from cystic acne for the latter half of my life and had wasted my money on practically everything - antibiotics_ Differin_ Retin-A_ Clindamycin_ ProActiv_ special cleansers_ and probably other stuff I can't remember.

I was thrilled with the results. My face was like glass -- no pores! But I did tire of the sore lips and dry eyes and was relieved to go off of it. Still_ well worth it. My skin stayed good for about three years and OK for another 10. I have used Minocycline periodically for the better part of the last 5-7 years. When my son developed cystic acne at age 16_ I didn't waste any time in getting him to the derm and getting him on Accutane. He took it for six months and hasn't had any problems since. That was five years ago. His acne is just like my sister's_ who unfortunately struggled needlessly with cystic acne her entire adult life and didn't go on Accutane until last year -- at age 46. She loved it too.  Now_ at age 50_ not yet in menopause_ and experiencing poor skin quality again with breakouts seemingly tied to my cycle_ I would go on Accutane but my derm seems reluctant because of my age and cholesterol levels.

I had problems in early teens_ but started taking birth control pills for gyno. problems which really helped my acne.

Accutane DID clear up the breakouts in about 2 weeks.  BUT- the side effects were horrible.First_ the dryness in my mouth_ lips and ears was painful.  I was drinking water constantly to try to combat dry mouth.  I had to use Aquaphor on my lips and ears all day long.My hips were very painful while taking Accutane.  I could never get comfortable.But the worst was the depression.  It hit about 6 weeks into the treatment.  I continued taking Accutane for another month_ but I became completely despondent and irritable.  I got into arguments at work and at home.  It was horrible.  I finally stopped taking the medication after a total of about  10 weeks.I stopped taking it a year ago_ and I still suffer from dryness in my ears and mouth.  I talk like I have cotton stuffed in my cheeks.  I am not sure if the depression is completely gone_ but I do feel a lot better.I would never take this again.,M,41,10  weeks,7/30/2009Email,Accutane

260, 3, VERY oily_ acne prone skin w/ cysts,VERY dry_ chapped lips; dry_ itchy eyes; HA; neckache; fatigue; dry_ itchy skin; facial flushing/heat; mild nausea w/ decreased appetite.,I started my first week on 80mg per day - within a few days my lips & face dried out quite a bit.  Lovely to not have an oil slick on my face for the first time in my life!  However_ increase in zits_ headaches & neckaches_ nausea_ itchiness_ some facial swelling & flushing_ & more extreme lip/face dryness occurred so I cut back to 40mg per day.  It's a bit better_ I can tolerate this so far.  I may cut back to 20mg per day - not sure.  Need to talk with the MD about it.  My skin is also extra sensitive now.  I'm hoping to see some significant clearing of my skin soon so I feel that continuation of the drug is worth it.  This was my last resort - after 20+ years of persistent acne & all other treatments_ I have had it! Anyone else with facial flushing_ redness_ heat that just comes on out of the blue like a sunburn???,F,38,2  weeks,7/18/2009Email,Accutane
261, 5, cystic acne,extremely dry skin_ cracked lips (minor),I took Accutane when I was 16 and I am 25 now. This medicine was truly a lifesaver and I had virtually NO side effects. I never write reviews_ but I felt I had to because of all the horror stories out there. People who are happy with their results aren't typically searching for the drug. I'm going back on for a second course-- I was on birth control for 7 years and I've experienced horrible acne for almost a year straight since going off. I don't think I'd need to do a second round of Accutane had I not been on the pill for so long. I have several friends who took the Accutane the same time as I did and their skin is still perfect. Even though I'm going to do a second round because of this hormone drop_ my skin is still like 85% clearer than it was pre-Accutane. Basically_ do it. It's ABSOLUTELY worth it. I didn't worry about my skin for almost 10 years. It was amazing. Good luck!,F,25,5  months,7/17/2009,Accutane
262, 2, Acne from 12-43,Severe neck pain_ seized hips after sitting for short periods. Depression_ crying spells. The good part was no oily skin. The inside of my ears were not oily anymore_ and my scalp_chest and back were not oily. This DID NOT LAST BUT 2yrs. This is NOT a MIRACLE DRUG! Your Dr. will tell you that. Acne comes back most of the time. My neck pain went away right after stopping Accutane. My hips have NEVER been the same. I also received several letters for a Class Action suit against the maker for Accutane_ allowing me the chance to sue them in 2002. I didn't respond. People. Antibiotics Work. Talk to your Dermatologist! Facials Really help too! Beware of Fraxil Laser! I broke out in 20 cysts and have 20 NEW scars!,I was so oily for 30 years_ I could grease a frying pan right after washing my face. Acne was mostly on my chin and nose with a cyst here and there constantly. My face would clear for short periods. After suffering until 23_ I tried Retin A. It worked for 2 years. I tried again later No luck. Broke me out worse. In 1993 I was a mess! I tried Accutane. I took it for 2 mths and my Dr. took me off because my Triglycerides were too high. I was so mad and upset because it had been working so well! I was 27 at this time and had No side affects. I later took it at 34. I broke out horribly! Immediately I had severe neck pain and my hips started seizing up after only short periods of time sitting! I became Very depressed. My husband wanted me off of it_ but I was determined to get rid of my acne! I stuck with it for 5 mths. I could'nt take it anymore! I had not slept for 5 mths due to the neck pain! For a whole year I still had acne mostly on my chin. Then almost a year to the day I stopped_ my skin cleared up_ and the oily skin on my upper body was Normal. For 2yrs my skin was NORMAL. All of a sudden_ it came back! My nose and chin nodules and cysts have been cleared by the antibiotics Bactrim and Minocyclin. They quit working after a year or 2. So you have to go back and forth. I won't take Accutane again though. I highly recommend it for younger people before the age of 25. Do it young!

I have also noticed my skin looks older_ no doubt because of the lack of oil needed to stay looking young. It is now 8 years later_ and I am unable to work full-time and have to lie down or rest frequently throughout the day. I_ also_ have a bladder lining disease. This drug wreaks havoc on your body!

Now_ 10 years later_ acne is coming back slightly_ but I was warned that one course of treatment may not be enough.,All in all_ taking Accutane was worth the 3 months of looking aweful.  I think it's funny how the people on this site are blaming Accutane for every medical or physical problem that they're having.  Come on people_ if you didn't read about the side affects_ then that's your fault_ not the company.  Do I have achy joints_ yes slightly_ but I am almost 48 years old_ too.  That's expected.

I haven't had a single major side effect (other than the dryness_ which_ after having had very oily skin my whole life_ is actually kind of nice).  I wish I hadn't been too scared to take this drug sooner; my skin is scarred from years of acne_ and accutane doesn't do anything to mend that.  Don't panic about this drug.

274, 4, Acne,Dry and itchy skin_ chapped lips_ flaky scalp_ joint pain (especially in my knees)_ diagnosed myofascial pain in upper extremeties and irritable bowel syndrome,I first took Accutane 5 years ago. I never thought about why I suffered from IBS until a couple weeks ago when someone brought to my attention the severe side effects of taking the drug. The summer after my first treatment_ I began having symptoms of IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). I was formally diagnosed a few months later and had my first colonoscopy at age 24. This is my second time on isotretinoin_ and I just completed my last dose 4 weeks ago. Last week Tuesday_ my left eye was blurry as if my contact lens wasn't strong enough for that eye. I continued putting the lens in my eye thinking it would get better_ but on Saturday I tried a stronger lens_ which worked_ but left me confused and slightly disturbed. Well this morning I woke up and after putting in my contacts_ my right eye isn't seeing at 100% like it should. I'm calling my doctor to see what's going on. I'm convinced it is related to this medication. I didn't realize the severity of the side effects but now that I do_ I would recommend alternative treatments for acne (maybe the blulight laser?). My skin does look amazing but at what price? Our health is all we have and I'm seriously rethinking my decision...although it's now too late. Lasers are the new starts of acne treatment.

Every bone in my body ached with pain.  Warning Of Note: My joint pain persists now 20+ years later.,"I took Accutane only as a last ditch effort to rid myself of acne.  When I first sought treatment_ my dermatologist said I had the worst case she had ever seen for a woman under her care. I started treatment for my acne when I was 18 or 19 years old. My dermatologist put me on one medicine after another over a period of years including: Tetracycline_ Minocin and Retin-A.  Then_ as a last resort_ I took Accutane_ which was the only drug that had a long term positive effect on my acne (- Dont stop now - PLEASE CONTINUE TO READ MY COMMENTS!).While I took the drug for only 6 months (Now_ 20+ years ago)_ I firmly believe Accutane did much more harm than good and so I continue my search of the Web for answers.  (Thus_ I came upon this website). For the last 20 years_ I've been suffering from persistent joint pain and experience both weakness and severe bone-chilling and painful cracking in my joints (particularly in my knees_ elbows and shoulders)_ just as I had when I was taking the drug_ though its now significantly worsening over time.  Also_ since my later thirties_ I have been suffering with chronic hives on my neck and face. Isnt that Ironic  Dont you think?  :-)*** PLEASE EXHAUST ALL POSSIBLE ACNE TREATMENTS BEFORE CHOOSING ACCUTANE_ and then ask yourself: ""Is the cure worse than the disease?""",F,45,6  months,5/22/2009,Accutane

It was always a lot worse right around when I had my period_ but even when it was not so bad_ it was always there. I mostly got it around my mouth_ on my chin and huge ones liked to pop up on my cheeks. I literally tried everything possible. My dermatologist prescribed me with countless creams_ cleansers and oral antibiotics but nothing worked. All that happened was my skin became very irritated and red_ but it was not clearing up. Finally I switched dermatologists and the one I am now going to immediately recommended accutane. She said I was starting to scar and it was the only thing that would work. I noticed changes immediately. The first 10 days I was on it I broke out A LOT_ but I was expecting this and tried not to get discouraged. My skin became extremely dry_ so I could not even put makeup on anymore to cover it up. I also broke out on my back a lot_ and I never really had acne on my back before. Now_ I am starting my second month of treatment and my skin looks the best it has since I was a small child. The acne on my back is not clearing up but my face is.

Spironolactone did help a bit though_ before.  At first I saw some clear up in the first month_ but then month 2-3 were pretty depressing and I Was thinking_ wow this isn't working_ but then come 4th month-5th month_ things got a lot better. I was on a high dose for someone my size_ but I'm a redhead and we tend to require more medicine.  My point is_ don't get depressed when you read about people who clear up right away_ I REALLY didn't.  Also_ skin lost oil within first week_ which was awesome.  Worst thing was the hair loss for me (already nervous about it_ so maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought) and the fact that any scratch I got took forever to hear and my ecxema just wouldn't stop_ but as soon as I was off_ all the scratches_ excema healed and didn't get any more.  If you have acne_ this medicine is worth it_ just follow the directions and it's fine_ I'd take dry sensitive skin for a solution.

As far as depression_ hormonal changes in life can cause depression as well as acne--they seem to occur together. A teenage with acne can be depressed.  My father had severe acne and has deep scars. I believe that I avoided this because of Accutane. Accutane has gotten a bad wrap. I have had 3 healthy children several years after being on Accutane. If they develop acne I would put them on Accutane. At age 46_ with menapause coming_ I am now starting to have increase breakouts_ rare cyst. If it becomes bad_ I would go back on Accutane. My skin for 20yrs has remained healthy until just recently. Even with breakouts now_ I do not have oiliness.

I moisturize 3-4 times daily_ and constantly use AquaPhor for my lips. The only side-effect that have caused some symptoms worth seeing a doctor for was anal dryness causing an anal fissure. I see a doctor once a month for check-ups and blood work to make sure my levels are ok and my symptoms aren't getting worse. Doctor says the tiredness could be caused by the muscle soreness.

There`s been weeping_ bleeding and soreness across my back but to everyone taking this drug_ if you relax and sleep more often it really changes the way your skin heals_ it basically can work overnight! =) today is saturday and ive decided to stay makeup free for as long as possible because its on my face 5 days a week -_-without makeup on it looks less bumpy whereas_ the makeup piled on adds to the lumpy effect. The areas of acne appear dryed out but its terribly itchy. My doctor told me that that the more severe it flares up_ it shows its working.

At age 40_ I tried another round as I still struggled with mild-moderate acne.  Worst mistake of my life. I knew about the depression side effect_ but had no idea about the joint pain. After about 5 months when my provider happened to mention it_ I finally figured out why I could hardly move.  .,Unfortunately_ I'm still having problems with my joints_ I get easily fatigued_ my mind is cloudy_ my hair is thin and dry. These things started out of nowhere. I was VERY active and healthy_ hardly ever sick and had all kinds of energy. I wish I would have read this forum and would have never taken it. It's absolutely not worth it. And to the person who believes that all of this is in our heads--if you knew me_ you would never believe that.,F,41,5  months,3/23/2009Email,Accutane
295, 3, acne,Much skin dryness while taking the drug.  Mostly my lips_ face_ and hands.  The dryness was tolerable and went from severe back to normal once I was off the medicine.  It wasn't until about a year after finishing accutane that I experienced disappointing side effects.  To keep this short I will just comment that I now have what my doctor thinks is fibromyalgia and it's symptoms started within a year after finishing accutane.  There is no doubt in my mind that the accutane_ at the very least_ was a major contributor to fibromyalgia_ if not the cause_ although this isn't proven. And unfortunatly_ my acne has returned.  The accutane seemed to suppress the acne for only 2-3 years.,,F,27,7  months,3/19/2009,Accutane
296, 5, cystic acne,Dry eyes_ dry lips_ cracking on the inside of my nose_ dry anus_ possible joint pain.,This is my second round.  This time I took 20mg instead of 60mg.  Far less side effects.  My acne started coming back after 2 years off accutane.  The derm put me on the low dosage of 20mg and I cleared up almost immediately.  I will use accutane for as long as it's available.  It's been a lifesaver for my painful_ cystic acne.,F,43,4  months,3/16/2009,Accutane
297, 5, Sudden Adult Acne,Dry lips_ spots of excema on arms and legs_ some joint pain_ dry eyes.,After the sudden onset of adult acne at age 30_ I had visited three dermatologists that prescribed over the counter meds that did nothing.  I began to get hyperpigmentation and scarring_ so I begged a new derm for accutane (sotret).  It was the best decision for my skin.  I had_ at any given moment_ 10 - 30 spots on my face prior to accutane...now I have zero.  I get the occassional pimple_ but it resolves in one or two days.  I also never have to carry around oil absorbing sheets any longer.,M,30,6  months,3/16/2009,Accutane

Its all GONE after 6 months of treatment.  Scars are healing.  Side effects are wearing off nicely.  Tickets to Bahamas on the way!,,62,6  months,3/11/2009,Accutane
300, 4, Moderate persistent acne,Ribcage soreness and joint/back pain during the first week (went away)_ dry skin/lips throughout_ stomach pains sometimes_ slight mood swings (may have happened anyway=))_ scabs do not heal as fast! soreness/dryness/blood when blowing nose_ irritation over not being able to drink as much!,This stuff affects everyone completely differently_ and you can't take any comments too seriously until you try it for yourself. Additionally_ many side effects you hear people talking about may or may not actually be due to the accutane itself. If you feel as though you need a last resort acne medication_ you should give it a try. I am not yet done with my treatment (at 3.5 months now)_ but my skin is now really starting to clear up big time. However_ side effects such as the dry skin_ chapped lips_ and sore internal nasal area is worse this month. 8/8 people who I know that have gone on this stuff are still void of acne after 2 or more years. Accutane can be a lifesaver; side effects should definitely be monitered closely though.,F,21,3.5  months,3/8/2009,Accutane

303, 1, acne,exhaustion_mood swings_ terrible anger_ depression_ irritability_ dry everything_ muscle and joint pain_ scarring_ skin that heals slower_ pain during sex_ lack of sex drive_ abdominal pain.,I was CONVINCED I should to take it by dermatologists_ all of whom assured me side effects would be gone within 6 weeks of stopping. I took it for 7 months. This was 10 yrs ago. Before I took it I almost never got sick_ extremely active and strong_ and was pretty much happy go lucky-nothing really bothered me.  After I started taking it_ I was sleeping 14 hrs aday_ tired during the waking hours_ my muscles and joints started hurting_ I got terrible muscle cramping if I tried to do anything physical_ and I mean like lift a gallon of milk compared to hay bales I used to easily lift on a regular basis. When I told them about the symptoms they said 'don't worry that's a normal side effect'_ and that they often have to prescribe Zoloft for mood/depression.  so now I have another drug_ yippee. I felt this way all the time_ it did not go away. It did start to flip flop as the yrs went on_ meaning more good days than bad. Now for about the last 3 yrs I have 'episodes' that come and go at will,F,40,7  months,3/3/2009Email,Accutane
304, 2, facial acne at age 41,dry lips_ sensitive skin during and after sun exposure_ muscle pain in arms,I was prone to acne as a late teen and during my twenties and did nothing about it except ineffective zinc_ proactive sol. and over the counter acne lotions. Eventually_ my skin was less oily in my 30s and okay.  At 40_ resurgence of acne_ I was given accutane for 5 mos.  it cleared my face but aged my skin everywhere else by 20 years. Very sad because I found out the acne was caused by a benign tumor on left adrenal gland_ it was surgically removed.   I wish I had not taken accutane.   Avoid it if you can.   Now I have seborrheic keratosis and the dermatologist says: your skin looks so old for your age!!!  Thanks Accutane garbage.,F,48,5  months,2/28/2009,Accutane

Especially the joint damage_ and liver infection. Plus the reason I take it still is because no medicine has been designed to help treat the very rare disease I was born with and accutane helps to keep me looking like a normal human being.,M,28,16  years,2/20/2009Email,Accutane
307, 5, Acne_ mostly chin and cheeks,None,I was very conscientious to take each pill EXACTLY 12 hours apart with a little food so there was a continuous stream of medication in my system with no spikes of more. I was also very good about getting my blood tested on time. This is a SERIOUS DRUG!

I'm in the final month of my 6 month treatment and really didn't start noticing the side-effects until month 4. None are very bothersome except for the blurry vision because I snowboard and need to have excellent vision. But my skin looks perfect now!

Caused a huge breakout which caused scarring. I had no scars before taking this_ but now I do.,I was on accutane about 5 years ago. It helped my skin_ but I look different. Like it dried me up. Also had some SEVERE anxiety a whole year AFTER taking accutane. Thank god it went away. It was debilitating and messed up my life for a good amount of time.

My hair thinned_ and my eyesight became worse.  I have also noticed my skin looks older_ no doubt because of the lack of oil needed to stay looking young. It is now 8 years later_ and I am unable to work full-time and have to lie down or rest frequently throughout the day. I am with the other person about a class action law suit.

313, 4, Acne,Overall this is great! ive been on it for almost two months now and its dried me out great! Chapped lips; Back Pain; exzema type rashes on my forearms and on the top of my hands and knuckles. Shaving has become difficult. Now it just plain out hurts.,So far i highly suggest this. Im sixteen years old and So far its done more good than bad. My arms do look funny from the rash; so thank god its winter! long sleeves are a blessing ahahha. When i wake in the morning; I get these dried patches of blood in my nose which is very gross; and when you blow your nose or scratch at them; they peel off; taking some of your skin with it so you have a sore in your nose; and this repeats nightly. No moisturising Nasal spray has helped. But its nothing horrible. No depression. Just aches in my back; hip and legs. Sitting for long period of time becomes difficult.,F,16,2  months,1/27/2009,Accutane
314, 5, severe acne,While taking accutane i experienced many side effects. Severe scalp itch_ to the point of getting a medication for that. my skin was so dry that i had to get a prescription lotion. Also the biggest thing is my sore achy joints. every single joint in my body hurt to the point that i had to sit out on any physucal activity. i was in middle school and could not participate in any sports or P.E.,years down the road i have developed degenerative disc disease and osteo arthritus. i am 22 years old now and i took high dosages when i was only 12 13 years old. i isuffer from depression and have sexual problems. my body constantly aches. It completely cleared my acne and worked amazingly. i dont even have to wash my face anymore and not have to worry about a single pimple. i took this drug at very high dosages like 120 mg/day for about 9 months,M,22,9  months,1/15/2009,Accutane

I used to play in the yard with the kids and I feel like I have no energy to do that and I also have such bad muscle cramps that I am afraid to use them.  No headaches- just bad aches and pains.  The dry lips are tolerable.,I am wondering if anyone else has this problem and how long it lasted.  It seems like there is a range of symptoms associated with the drug.  I am 41_ have mild acne but tired of the scars it leaves.  Should I preserver?  I have been on it about three weeks- have a pretty good breakout currently_ and hope it works in the long run to make it worth the pain it causes.,F,41, ,1/8/2009Email,Accutane
316, 5, Cystic acne_ painful_ unseen bumps,I was part of the trial for Accutane_ before approval_ so there was no cost for me_ just forms and reports. I did have the usual dry skin_ chapped lips_ sensitivity to light and lots of body & joint  pain. I also had a few headaches.,Since I was in jr high I had acne.I tried creams_ antibiotics_ sunlamp treatments & had dr cutting open the bumps_ leaving scars. So_when I was asked by a dr if i was interested trying this_ I jumped at it. It's been so long_  since my experience_ 2 of my sons used it only 1 stayed w/it the other fainted at his monthly blood draw. so the one that stuck it out has great clear skin_ with no breakouts_ his brother is not as clear_ but it's his choice. I am entering my golden years & haven't had a breakout in many_ many years. just the self esteem makes it worth it! For me it was a miracle drug.

317, 1, Moderate Acne,Vomiting_ chapped skin_ depression_ weight loss.I was on Accutane for 5 months and did not see results during or after my treatment.  I started at 80MG and then my doctor tried to up my dose to 120MG.  (I weight 124LB.)  My pharmacy refused to fill the 120MG dose because it was ILLEGAL?!,The first 1.5 months of treatment the side effects were bareable.  I had chapped skin and some stomach irritation but nothing dramatic.  During the last 3.5 months of treatment my side effects escalated and were horrible.  I had severe depression (never had ANY issues before).  I cried everyday for no reason.  I would just sit in bed and cry.  I also could not eat.  I was so sick that I would throw up water. I could barely take a sip without running to the bathroom.  I lost 20 pounds.  I actually told my doctor I was having depression and losing weight from feeling sick and SHE KEPT ME ON IT!  Finally_ I went off thinking I would be fine.  WRONG.  Now 5 months after the drug I still cannot eat properly.  I have no more depression (thankfully!)_ but I still am extremely thin.  I can only eat bread.  If I eat ANYTHING else (meat_ cheese_ fruit) I am running to the bathroom.  If anyone knows why this is happening_ please post and let me know!  Did accutane ruin my digestive system?  I do,F,24,5  months,12/28/2008,Accutane
318, 4, Acne,mild joint pain (on and off)_ chapped lips/skin (aquaphor for lips does miracles)_ a little bit of eczema in the beginning (hydrocortisone cream helped),Everyone will react differently from Accutane as I've read. Luckily for me it worked. I took it in 2005 for about 5 months and it cleared my acne_ but a few months later it came back. Then this year 2008 I am taking it again and am going on month 4 and am already clear. People comment on how my skin is glowing. This is a first! I have two months left and I can't imagine how much better it's going to look. I love how I don't have oily skin anymore. I hope it doesn't come back but because of my success I wouldn't mind going on it again. Also_ apparently this medicine is known to increase suicide rates. I've had depression since I was 11_ and have been seeing a therapist(and reconnecting with God is helping too)_ and I've been on accutane and find myself happier because of my confidence! So_ no depression troubles for me.,F,21,5  months,12/27/2008,Accutane

The headaches in the beginning were virtually unbearable. My dr. advised that I stop the medicine until they subsided_ then reintroduce to my body at just half of the dosage for a few days. Worked wonderfully_ now haven't had another headache. But_ alot of muscle aches and pains. Feels like I work out everyday_ and I don't.,M,32,2  months,12/27/2008,Accutane
320, 3, severe acne,I am currently taking accutane right now_ I been on it for about a month now and see a slight change. My derm. had put me on 30mg which I take 2x a day. on my first week of accutane I realized that my face didn't look as oily as it did_ & it seemed as if my acne was clearing up. After about the first 2 weeks_ I had gotten the initial breakout which sucked. After being on if for about a month I still get those occasional breakouts_ but overall it looks as if its clearing up. As of right now I am experiencing the chapped lips_ dry skin_ and some back pain. I believe I'm gettin this back pain due to weight lifting since I go to the gym. My friends also tell me that I tend to have mood swings_ which I haven't really noticed. I just hope this pill works_ I want to be acne free already!,,F,17,1  months,12/25/2008Email,Accutane
321, 1, Persistant adult acne,Whilst on it; Occassional nosebleeds_ mild muscle and joint pain that disappeared after a while_ dry skin and lips_ small patches of eczema_ tiredness and sometimes a headache.,The WORST drug ever created by man. I took a 7 month course of 40mg per day and whilst my experience on it was brilliant and fairly smoot sailing_ 3 months after stopping all hell broke loose. I now deal with chronic_ widespread dehabilitating joint pain_ sexual dysfunction_ IBS and generally feel more suicidal than ever before and this is 18 months on from my last tablet. It just isn't worth it. Yes my life improved dramatically at first and my skin cleared instantly and is relatively clear to this day_ but god how I wish I could go back in time. I have ruined my life. I can no longer fulfill my ambition and it required strenuous physical activity and I doubt I can hold down a job for much longer too.

Kinda gross_ I know... I also had dry itchy skin all over my body. I constantly had to moisturize myself_ particularly during the dry winter months.,Accutane gave me the clear skin I've always wanted; I just wish I took it earlier because I used to be very embarrassed about my acne.

326, 3, persistent moderate acne_ keloids,After a week_ acne got much worse_ but they say this is common.  2 weeks in_ skin on face got very dry and chapped lips all the time.  I was also more emotional.  Got down easier.  Also much more irritable to the point where I was on the verge of violence.  I have never felt this way my whole life.  Those raging emotions subsided after a week or 2.  But I stopped after 4 weeks because I started to get a tightness in my chest.  very mild but still worried me.  Chest pain is not a common side effect so it could be completely unrelated. But i didn't want to take the chance.  And plus I noticed it was thinning my hair.,Was on 40 mg daily dosage.  Was only on it for 4 wks and I only got maybe a few small breakouts in the last couple weeks.  So it was definitely working.,M,30,4  weeks,12/12/2008,Accutane

It certainly cleared the acne which erupted all over my face for no reason. However_ I suspect that the knee pains and elevated cholesterol that I still have today was due to the drug. Both of these started after I was taking accutane.,M,40,6  months,12/4/2008,Accutane

I feel as though it has made me slightly more depressed and not as happy. What is worst though is my eye sight. I stopped because I feel like my eye sight was declining. It might just be the side effects of the drug but I just don't want to take that chance. It also caused major brain pressure to the point where I couldn't concentrate at work. This stuff is intense and just monitor your side effects well when taking it. I'm never going on it again. It's not worth it to me.,F,23,3  weeks,12/3/2008,Accutane

I was very nervous about taking it and tried everything else to no real effect but it quite honestly changed my life. I now have completely clear skin and the odd breakout is mild and quickly heals.

I just started another course of it as of today.  I have suffered from acne for a very long time_ and accutane has been the only thing that has ever been able to truly help me.  Although it always seems to come back within a year of my stopping to take accutane_ my acne gets less and less severe each time it does return.  Accutane has truly been a life saver for me.  My usual side effects include very chapped lips_ a sore rash that usually develops on the backs of both of my hands_ and dry skin in general (especially on my face).  I have never suffered from depression_ or nausea_ or any of the other terrible side effects that I have read about.

The acne is bad yes_ but this is far worse. If I could take it all back_ I wouldn't do it for the world. I missed so much valuable time. Yea_ I have clearer skin_ but I often wonder if there would not have been another solution. I hated my acne.

Long Term: Knee pain_ vision complications in one eye similar to those of retinal detachment.,I fell into acne at age 11; started treatment at 18 being old enough to support this rather expensive disorder. My acne was  severe_ painful_ and for me self destructive. I could go on 4ever about things acne robbed me of. No drugs worked until age 29 when i met accutane. Completely covered from the rim of the neck up to my hairline_ from the base of my neck to my elbows and shoulder blades. I started taking double doses after first three months_ Doc's orders. After 6months total_ he told me I was finished. I wasn't finished_ I was furious! I still had acne keeping me awake at night bleeding. He said I would begin seeing a difference soon and it will continue to work. He was right_ I'm 33 now and have been clear since then. Are the side effects worth it? If the long-term effects are infact due to the drug_ No. But I can't say 4sure this drug is at fault. I had minor knee trouble prior to accutane.

337, 3, Seb hyperplasia_ oily skin_ rosacea,Took full course of Accutane in 1990 for cystic acne when I was about 30.  The big dose made my joints extremely stiff.  I had thinning hair.  I had dry lips and carried Chap Stik constantly.  I am not sure but suspect that my huge mood swings were from the drug.  It was at this time that I was a first time mother and so I never knew if it was stress from that or from the side effects of Accutane.  I am now 50 years old and have had huge hormonal changes in recent years that have caused me to have sebateous cysts on my chest and sebateous hyperplasia on my face.  It was quite depressing (after having made it through years and years of acne ... and now ... this.).  I was recently put on a low dose (20 mg) to take 3 X a week.  After only a couple of weeks the sebateous hyperplasia bumps on my face appeared to disappear.  My face became much less oily.  The dermatologist informed me recently that I would have to be on Accutane for the rest of my life.  (?!).  This troubles me.  He also in,When I took the full dose back in 1990 my skin cleared up and it was less oily.  But it went right back to normal in not much time (less than a year).

I still have acne to this day.",When I started Accutane_ they didn't know many of the long term effects. Before reading this_ I never put two and two together_ but 9 years later_ I wouldn't be surprised if Accutane has played a role in my knee pain_ IBS_ fatigue and vision problems (sensitivity to light). HOWEVER_ I agree with the person that wrote on Sep 1_ being that I had no idea it was related to Accutane_ I've just found ways to adapt. Live life_ don't complain about it.

Yes_ I kid you not that I have this side effect and more than positive that Accutane was the root of the cause. Even my derm. cosigned this claim but so far none of the his treatment was any useful.,Hair loss does occur but it is more common than they would want you to believe_ but it is rare that you will experience full baldness.

My dermatologist himself had taken Accutane when he was 17 and he said it works amazing_and hes now in his 30s and his skin looks great. So i decided to try it out. Im now 4 months and 3 weeks into the treatment and my skin has improved dramaticly and im so excited. There is a possibility that i might have to go a 6th month but if i have to.. thats what im willing to do cause id rather get it all out then just get most of it.

341, 1, Severe acne,Hypothroidism_ severe colitis_ osteoarthritis,Accutane is a horrible_ dangerous drug. I think it will eventually be removed from the market. I was a young_ healthy adult before I took this drug and it has ruined my entire health for life. I hope that I can either get on a class action lawsuit against roche_ or that I will be compensated by roche in an individual lawsuit_ for absolutely destroying my life! My acne is still present_ today at 45 years old_ after three courses of accutane_ over a three year period_ in the early 1990s_ when I was in my early thirties.

342, 4, acute cystic acne,dry skin_ chapped lips_ acne flare-ups_ skin real sensitive (like a sunburn). No other lasting side effects that I've noticed.,I took accutane when I was like 16-17. I had really bad acne on my back and chest and some on my face. I remember it seemed to make the acne worse_ bring it all out. It was gross. My lips were really chapped most of the time. My skin was real irritated so if someone slapped me on the back or shoulder it killed. I had to get my blood and urine checked monthly. As far as depression goes I'd say I was depressed but I was a pretty shy kid who had real bad acne and I was in high school. It didn't have anything directly to do with the drug for me. I also remember not going swimming in my pool and not going to the beach that summer(boo!). I do believe it did get rid of my acne and it never did come back after that. I've heard about accutane causing premature wrinkles. My younger sister seems to think the reason I look so young for my age is because of taking it. I'm only 37 though.

There are now alternative in the market. Look into laser therapies or consider the pill(side effect but better than accutane).I took the drug when was 17 years_ now 31. Cleared up cystic acne but came back. I stopped treatment after 4 months. I had AMAZING_ thick and beautiful hair that everyone complimented me for.Initially noticed that hair was shedding more than before but thought it would stop. It continued for years- a slow progression. Now 31 and was at the point where I was seeing bald patches on the front of my head and my hair was 70 percent thinner than before. I knew that I would be bald by 40 so I decided to try laser therapy. It WORKED! My hair is back.100 percent sure that it was the accutane.

345, 4, severe nodual acne,extremely dry lips_ occasional mood swings_ heightened artistic ability_ nose bleeds,I had been on accutane twice before the therapy I'm going through right now.  The first time I was 19_ the second I was 22.  I'm now 25 and attempting to clear up every last blemmish on my face.  I didn't finish the therapy before because I hated having bright pink lips that cracked and bled. I wont take anything away from accutane_ its a great drug_ and its the only thing that has ever worked for me.  Acne is a condition that effects you psychologically.  It pulls you into yourself and leads you to self-conscious thoughts.  Clearing your skin can change your life.  I'm sure a lot of people know this from experience.  My thing about accutane is you sort of become a perfectionist because you know what the drug is capable of.  You start to see every little insignificant mark or blackhead and think to youself you're not perfect... yet.  You become so vain_ its hard not to stare at yourself in the mirror especially when half your life_ you've avoided mirrors.  Eh.. I could go on...,M,25,2  days,9/9/2008Email,Accutane

About a year later_ I took my second course and the side effects were not nearly as severe (however I did have scarring). My acne is SO MUCH BETTER_ but I am considering a 3rd course because I still do suffer from cystic acne. *Use Aquaphor (can be found at any drug store) to help with dry lips/skin *Use a homemade mask of alvacado and mayo once a week to help with flaky scalp *Drink plenty of water!,F,24,2  times,9/6/2008,Accutane

I loved being able to go almost an entire week without washing my hair. Sebum is virtually non-existant even two weeks after being off the medicine. Side effects have almost completely diminished.

Beforehand I had read askapatient.com comments plus other info and I was scared about hairloss_ depression_ jointpain_ etc.so I was very reluctant for her_ especially at her age_ to go on Accutane. But after everything she had tried_ she was so discouraged and selfconscious; her dermatologist said that she has treated patients with Accutane for 20+ years with very very minor problems_(it turns out the same ones that our daughter had)_ almost everyone was pleased with the results so we decided to go for it.  Relative to everything else our daughter tried_ this has been an easy treatment_ (the real hassle is the FDA requirements of monthly blood tests and online questions which seem ridiculous).

350, 4, Mild but persistent acne,The most annoying side effect was the build up of bloody boogies in my nose. They would stick to the sides of my nose and when blown out_ would tear the skin and cause bleeding. Then that bleeding would cause a scab and it turned into a bad cycle. I had NO mood swings from Accutane_ this might be because I started a Vitamin B-Complex_ which is supposed to help with mood swings. It was annoying that I couldn't get my eyebrows waxed during my Accutane cycle. I tried once_ and it ripped off my skin. Of course_ I couldn't go anywhere without chapstick the whole time I was on Accutane_ but I could still wear make-up on my face without flaking skin. The MIRACLE lotion is Cetaphil -- get the one for the body and use it on your face_ trust me. It didn't irritate my skin and provided enough moisture.,I would recommend Accutane to everyone suffering from acne. My acne was not severe_ but persistent. I would get a few big zits every month_ and I had BACNE_ which was gross. The Accutane cleared everything_ but not until the 4th month I was on it. So be patient. I was obsessed with Accutane the first month I was on it_ but then I just got used to taking it every day and barely thought about it.,F,26,5  months,8/27/2008,Accutane

371, 5, Cystic Acne,dry face/lips_ scalp is less oily_ reduced pore size_ skin a little itchy at night (lotion helps).,My acne is purely cystic (not a bunch of white/black heads).  I would get 2 or 3 cysts at a time_ then heal_ and then 2 or 3 more - usually in the same area.  I dreaded Accutane because of the side effects_ but it's not so bad.  I saw positive results within the first week.  I've had 2 small blemishes which dried up quickly within my 1st month.  My skin is more even = looks healthier.  The monthly blood tests and doctor visits are annoying_ but it's been enjoyable so far.,F,27,31  days,6/6/2008,Accutane

373, 4, acne,Dryness inside and out; skin is soft with the exception of dry patches on hands_ arms; bloating; slight headaches; red bumps on legs like bites that do not itch; some night vision differences,I am a little over halfway through the treatment and couldn't be happier.  I started to break out at 25 and have been on countless topicals and antibiotics since then.  I wish I had taken it when offered by the first doctor a couple years ago_ but wanted to wait until I was 'ready' and made sure that nothing else worked. It was refreshing to read other comments and see that I am not the only one experiencing some of these side effects.  My skin already has a glow and is starting to even out.  My breakouts are minimal and clear up within a couple days. I started at 40 mg/day_ then moved to 60 mg/day.  I will end the program at 80 mg/day.  The low fat diet was hard to maintain at first but I've gotten used to reading labels and feel better about myself.  I would recommend these meds to anyone who qualifies.,F,28,4  months,6/4/2008,Accutane

This is the first time I've taken it and it has been working great. I'm on 100mg now and this is the first dose that has really dried me out. I also had pretty bad scaring on my cheeks and it has made most of it go away. The only thing I don't like is if I get a cut or scrape_ it takes atleast 1 month to heal completely.

I had minor side-effects (dry lips_ etc.) My skin did get better for about 2 years_ but the acne came back. I decided to go on another round at the age of 29 and had SEVERE life-altering side-effects_ so much so that I could barely function. This drug might work to make your acne go away_ but the side-effects are so horrendous that it doesn't make it worth it.

It has caused me so many stomach problems for the past 5 years. Chronic diearea since then. I have also spoken to many other people who have taken the drug who have had the same side effects.

Also irritability and depression.,This was my 3rd round; took it at age 25 for 16 weeks with good results and only side effect then_ besides the dryness_ was slightly depressed mood but acne came back in a few years. Took again at age 30 and stopped when I developed severe pneumonia @ 10 weeks. Unable to tolerate more than 40 mg this time.  After a slight injury that would have gone unnoticed normally_ I developed tendonitis in biceps and rotator cuff that is still not resolved. Existing knee and hip problems were MUCH worse.  And my hair is much thinner.  I am loving not having oily skin but still have some breakouts.  Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Cream great for inside dry nose; Kmart Fruit/Earth VitE cream good moisturizer; GNC l-phenylalanine helped with mood but check with your doctor first. DO NOT take Accutane without carefully weighing the risk vs reward and DO have a friend monitor you constantly while on it. I took 6 Rx over 7 months.,F,50,7  months,5/3/2008,Accutane

Day 4_ read some web sights and have decided to stop until talking to my doctor on monday.,Very scary stuff.  The first day I thought everything was in my head_ but the with each day_ I am noticing more and more severe changes that are troubling.  I don't want to take this drug_ but I don't know what to do about the adult acne that has flared with a vengeance.  The topical and oral antibiotics did not touch my acne.  So I thought I would try this medication.  I was wrong. Nothing seems to be working!!!!  That's is what is depressing!!!   But I don't want to try to improve one thing and create other life long problems.  My diet is very healthy and I regularly workout.  Maybe I'll try reducing some stress in my life.

I would be really happy_ but when I hit my lows_ I hit them pretty hard.  The dry skin was not too bad seeing as I had oily skin in the past_ but the dry_ cracked_ bleeding lips was kind of annoying.

My second month_ I was on it 20 mg three times a day.  And now I am just finishing up my third month at 40 mg twice a day.  At first_ my skin started to get better with no cysts and only 2-3 new pimples each week.  After that it got worse and since then it's been back and forth.  Within the past few days_ I've noticed that my skin has gotten a lot better.  I have 2 cysts and no other new pimples (no whiteheads or blackheads).  My skin feels very soft and smooth_ and it is not that dry.  I have scars on my cheeks_ but I had them from before being on Accutane.  It's been annoying when my skin got worse when taking it_ but I know that it will get better eventually.  Now that my skin has gotten a lot better_ I'm so excited_ because I know my skin will be perfect soon.  The one thing that is actually annoying is that after I come off it (in 2 months)_ I'll probably have to get some type of scar treatment if the scars don't go away when I'm,F,16,3  months,4/7/2008,Accutane

I took the drug for 3 months and now 4 months later I am pretty happy with the result. I used to have very oily hair and skin but now they are both normal.

Ive been on 2 courses. One high dose for six months and the other was low dose (10mgs every other day) for about 3 years. After seeing many specialists and trying EVERY other drug out there I got a doc to prescribe me accutane. Almost overnight my skin lesions stopped! Once off accutane_ they started coming back so i did a low dose regime to treat the swelling in my nose. THIS DRUG WORKS WONDERS BUT MUST BE USED WITH CAUTION!,F,42,3  years,4/4/2008,Accutane

I had cysts the size of quarters underneath my skin that have completely disappeared. I can now go out in public without feeling disgusted with my face and I would recommend taking it to anyone-but only if you research it and think about the potential side effects beforehand. I have been off of Accutane for 6 months now and have ZERO acne. The only lasting side-effect is my hair has thinned slightly_ but I am so happy I chose Accutane rather than continuing with antibiotics and topical treatments. RESEARCH first_ but it worked for me.,F,25,6  months,4/4/2008,Accutane

I did try Accutane approx. 6 years ago_ but didn't follow through with it due to the acne getting worse_ but now_ I sure wish I did! I have been on it for 10 days so far and am pretty happy.  I still have some old ones that are fading_ but no new cysts. I just can't wait to have my pretty face back!!!  Acne has destroyed some good years.

It was hard on me emotionally and physically but I stopped 2 months early from taking 80MG a day because the result turned out so well. I must say I THANK GOD for the creators of this drug. It was worth every bit of the struggle. To not have to wake up in the morning to a face full of cyst. Or the feeling of wanting to stay home and away from mirrors. Now people ask how is my skin so beautiful! Or how do I get it to glow! Its truely worth it if you're having problems with acne.,M,20,4  months,3/24/2008,Accutane

Also_ these newer side effects I am having (vaginal dryness_ rash) are more worrisome and can be ebmarassing in certain situations.  I haven't had any depression_ but have had occasional bad days when I've broken out again and feel hopeless.  I am hoping within the next month and a half my skin continues to clear up and the acne doesn't come back - my best friend took it a couple years ago and has said she would never have recommended it to anyone while she was on it because she was so miserable but now that she's so happy with the results_ she would - she hasn't had a single pimple_ 2 years later.  So I'm hopeful that in the next few months it will prove to be worth all of these side effects.

I have an identical twin that did not take it and I have issues that he does not have but I do. My stomach and intestines are not doing well. My twin has no problem with his and he drinks alcohol and eats worse food than I do.,I did not know that much about the drug at the time or I would not have taken it. The acne started to come back and I was able to treat it with other methods that are less harmful to my body. I experimented with soaps_ used things to exfoliate my skin_ changed my diet_ and washed my face with cooler water. It cleared up. I think that everyone should do this instead. I also noticed that tap water in some areas influenced my skin too. Diet and stress also cause skin changes too. Keep in mind also that skin has natural defence microorganisms that protect it so cleaning it too much is bad. Alcohol is also bad for it and most acne products have this. Alcohol will also cause skin to produce more oil after using it. All of the acne products Don't work for severe acne because of alcohol and other products in it like that. Acne can also be caused by infection called candida. Antifungal cream will help this and you will notice that your skin will get worse in humid weather if this is the cause.,M,27,6  months,3/11/2008Email,Accutane

I missed a month of school from all of my intestinal issues and lost 20 pounds from my already thin frame.  10 years later and I still do not have any ear wax_ which contributes to me suffering from chronic swimmer's ear.

These are all gone. I feel very comfortable on this drug_ as my dermatologist checks my blood monthly_ and I have been fine. As long as you see a dermatologist who cooperates with the iPledge system_ and insists upon doing bloodwork monthly_ I would highly recommend this drug. A few months of inconvenient side effects WAY outweighs the emotional and physical pain acne causes for years. Do your research and monitor your health_ and you should be just fine.,F,26,3  months,2/18/2008,Accutane
414, 4, for acne,dry lips_ ichy head_ dry spots on face_ and dry mouth,i have only been on it for 3 weeks and it seems to be working. my lips are dry and i use aquaphor all day_ it comes in a small tabe an di take it to school and apply it about 10 times a day! i hope my side effects dont worsen. though my face isnt as bad as it was_ i have horrible black heads since ive started. my mom tries to tell me that it is becasue all the shit on the bottom layer is coming up but i really dont know. my face is sometimes dry and i use hydrating lotion every morning. i take 40mg at night and in the morning. i go to the doctor next week to check back.,M,16,3  weeks,2/13/2008,Accutane
415, 4, Persistent cystic acne since age 13,Dry lips_ dry eyes_ occasional eyelid twitching_ unable to wear contact lenses every day_ numbness in fingers_ occasional muscle cramps in legs and feet_ headaches_ and general anxiety induced by reading about all the possible side effects.,I am a 33 year old female_ 125 lbs. I have had severe oily skin and moderate cystic acne since age 13. I started taking Accutane a little over 2 months ago. My derm started me out on a regimen of 40/80/40mg alternating daily_ and after 4 days my body could not handle it so I stopped. I developed a twitch in my left eyelid_ a severely dry left eye with blurred vision (due to dryness) and drug-induced arthralgia in my ring and pinky fingers. He wasn't very understanding so I switched derms and my new doc started me out on 10mg daily the first month_ 20mg daily the second month_ and now I am on 40mg daily (20mg 2x daily.) My body is tolerating it much better and my skin is improving daily. The best advice I can give you is 1.) Find a doctor's office who understands the iPledge system_ 2.) Have your doctor start you off on a low dose_ and 3.) Take your medicine with a full meal. You may be afraid to take it at first_ but when you start seeing the results you will be amazed.,F,33,10  weeks,2/5/2008,Accutane

I wouldn't recommend it_ there are also too many side effects. These rash like bumps all over my body and are 10 times worse than having acne on my face.

417, 5, Moderate to Severe Cystic Acne,Just like everyone else: extremely dry lips and skin_ hyper-sensitivity to the sun_ dry and sensitive eyes_ mild joint pain.,It was all worth it. I took Accutane when I was 12. The doctor told me I may have to take it again since I was pre-puberty and the acne could flair up again during puberty. It was a tough 6 months and I wanted to quit many times but my mom wouldn't let me. The joint pain wasn't too severe because I continued to play sports. I never did have to take the meds again because the acne never reoccured. I am 21 now and have perfect skin with no permanent side effects and no scarring. I suffered from depression but that was because of the acne_ not the meds. I was embarrassed to be seen.

Aside from the side effects_ can I just point out that going through I-Pledge and actually obtaining the drug was a headache in itself that took over a month to accomplish. Please make sure you have a good doc cause if not_ good luck getting i-pledge_ the pharmacy_ and your doc all on the same page. when I finally got the drug_ I took my first pill at 40 mg.

I thought it was side effects from the Gardasil shot I got a couple weeks earlier. I thought maybe I was having an anxiety attack_ and layed down to relax.

Stress is one of the main causes of acne.For those who really hate acne_ i dont know why_ I really suggest the treatment of the digestive system. This may sound nasty_ but drink vinegar!!!!! DAILY! It clears out your system. Put it on your face as well! Also drink loads of water. Another helpful thing is to serial vegetable diet a week here and there.

Accutane is the best thing to ever happen to me.  I would recommend it to anyone who is like me_ and isn't afraid of going through hell to have a life.

Don't be lulled into thinking that accutane is the be all end all to your acne problems.  Most likely they will return.  If they don't_ you are one of the lucky few.

I had at least one very painful_ swollen_ cystic outbreak around my menstrual cycle_ that usually resulted in a large scar. So_ I decided to take a chance.

453, 1, o Moderate Acne: Tetras didnt work,within first 2 weeks: severe headaches_ blurred vision_ dry burning skin_ dry lips_ diarrhea_ decreased night vision_ severe heart burn,went to dr on day 10_ was told to immediately stop the medicine.  now must wait 3-4 weeks before starting antibiotics again.

454, 5, Acne,I've been on Acutane for 6 days now & I will say my back is aching terribly & my lips are DRY!,My dermatoglogist put me back on Accutane partially because Klaron_ Rentin A_ & Doxycyclin were NOT working....I have been on Accutane before about 7 years ago so not too concerned about the side effects. With my previous run on this medicine I didn't have the severe back aches. I will say I did have tons of issues registering with the IPledge website...all too confusing all to combersome! Didn't have to do that 7 years ago. Since this is my 2nd go round I can say that for me there were no depression issues because my skin looks awesome ...tons of compliments. As with all things once I stop so will the side effects. This medication is obviously for those with severe acne so you should certainly weigh the pros vs. the cons...for me I didn't think twice...,F,28,6  days,6/24/2007,Accutane
455, 1, mild acne,Major Sexual side effects. I can no longer have an erection (female) and i have lost all sensation in my clitoris. I can have an orgasm_ but it's very difficult and can't feel anything before the orgasm. very strange side effect but true. Dr's don't understand this_ or know what to do with me.

456, 3, bad_ ugly acne,Lips were pretty damn dry. always carry chapstick. my lips are out of shape towards the corners of my mouth_ real screwed up_ I dont know why. other than that_ nothin serious. maybe tiredeness_ but hey-Im a teenager. no noticibale mood changes or depression thats different from the norm_ but like I said_ Im a teen. occasional brief minor rash_ a little sore back_ but thats all for me.,It was slightly helpful to me_ and for that_ it was worth it. I have one month yet to go. when I started_ face was real bad. plain ugly. its definitely gotten better_ but there are alot of small but noticable darkspots that just dont seem to fade_Im hoping they will yet; Ive heard many people see major improvement after they stop the drug. I hope thats me.Its helped me emotionally_ because everyday I wake up and think 'I gotta take my accutane!' thinking it will help. and it has_ even if its not completely gone.One thing I reccomend is swimming while on the drug. the combination of accutane and chlorine on your face will dry it out significantly and promote new skin growth. Its helped me alot; I try and swim almost every day!,M,18,5.5  months,6/23/2007Email,Accutane
457, 4, Moderate acne,Dry_ chapped lips_ skin peeling_ dry skin_ minor muscle aches,This is my second go round of Accutane. I started my first treatment about 7 years ago.My acne definitely started to come back last year_ and I was prescribed topical creams and antibiotics. Of course_ they did not work. I just started Accutane again 24 days ago. I can already see the difference! I wish that I was prescribed this 10 months ago after wasting money on useless dermatology prescriptions. I was already prepared for the tedious prework prior to taking the drug. The monthly doctor visits_ blood tests_ and process of getting prescriptions are a pain! FEMALES: Please take this drug seriously. Discuss all effects with your partner. My symptoms include DRY LIPS_ PEELING SKIN_ and minor muscle aches occasionally. MY ADVICE IS TO CARRY CARMEX_ BLISTEX_ OR MEDICATED VASELINE IN YOUR PURSE OR POCKET.(TRUST ME: The lipstick will not stay on). LUBRIDERM LOTION IS HELPING ME OUT A LOT! PREVENTS LOTS OF DRYING.

I'm not 100% sure this is the accutane though.Longer injury recovery time_ particularly sunburns and skin abrasions.,This had really helped to improve the clarity of my skin_ and based on my experience i would reccomend this to anyone troubled with mild or more severe acne.  As i stated as a side effect_ the muscle pains were a major problem for me since i am active on a day by day basis.  For those of you that run a lot in your sport_ avoid this during the season.  Sorness after a tough game would last days.

However_ I did develop Myalgia with it. The Myalgia I had was where the muscle in my chest swelled_ making it extremely painful and hard to breathe.,Yes_ it does work_ but not if you are allergic to it_ I say go for it until you hit the bad symptoms that you cannot stand.,F,22,1  months,6/5/2007,Accutane

465, 2, Acne,Hair loss_ dry skin,I took Accutane in the early 80s when I was a Junior in high school.  My Acne was severe and it did help clear it up.  Until that time I had a full head of hair.  By the time I was in college I had a receding hair line.  By age of 26 I had lost most of the hair on the top of my head.  I am the only member of my family to have hair loss like this - all of my siblings_ parents and grandparents all have full sets of hair.  I know shave my head.  The only explanation I can find is the use of Accutane as  a teenager.,M,40,6  months,5/30/2007,Accutane
466, 5, Severe Acne,chapped lips_ slightly dry skin and I have keloids left from the acne scarring,I finished a 5 month treatment on Accutane about 7 years ago and it worked like a dream!! I tried everything topical out there but nothing worked. I walked into Dr. Kathy Fields office (maker of ProActive Solution) thinking she could help me possibly try the ProActive Solution which was very popular at that time but she told me about Accutane explained the effects and all.  Good thing I was only 17 at that time and I didn't have too many responsibilities  or commitments going on.  I saw a difference after a couple weeks.  I think I was taking the yellow pills (dont remember what dosage that was). It cleared up my acne on my face and back.  The only thing that bothers me is that although I have clear skin_ I have keloids from my acne on both shoulders and on my chest!  Other than that...I highly recommend this to anyone who  is really serious about getting treatment for their acne but be cautious this stuff is really strong!!,F,24,6  months,5/28/2007,Accutane

468, 4, sparatic nodules and  breakouts,dry lips_ bloody nose_ joint ache_ and depression,I just finished accutane and it helped a LOT!  I was on a very small dosage and still experienced all of the bad side effects.  My lips definitely got really chapped.  I can't imagine being on a higher dosage!  I found that by using vasaline at night_ it really helped.  I only got about 3 bloody noses so that wasn't too bad and the joint pain was not severe.  As far as the depression goes_ I'm not sure if accutane added to my depression thoughts or not.  I was already depressed before I got on it..so I'm not really sure if it was caused by the drug or not.  The results are great though! My skin is completely clear!,F,18,5  months,5/25/2007,Accutane

I don't kow if I was just lucky but for me I didn't have that many side effects- my acne just began to clear up after a couple of weeks (before it'd take two months for one cyst to heal!). Yes_ there was some dryness but I mostly just experienced the good effects.  I have now been off it for about 5 years and my skin is still clear! I get the occasional break out (especially if I get lazy washing my face) but after experiencing years of painful_ red_scarring_ cystic acne that took months to heal a couple of zits are no big deal.,F,25,5  months,5/18/2007,Accutane

Your healthy and general happiness is definately affected_ because you never feel yourself_ there is always some nasty side-effect holding you back_ so all i have to say is make sure it is worth it to you :) get in contact with me if you agree with any of this_ I've barely started treatments and I would love to talk to someone my age going through the same thing.,F,14,3  weeks,5/12/2007Email,Accutane

At 40mg got instant smooth_ dry *touchable* skin_ but eyes would stick shut and lips exfoliate in 30 sec.s - talk about conversation stopper! Kept taking less Accutane until found a minimum maintenance level.  At 10 mg had a few pimples_ blackheads_ shiny nose_ but no more cystic zits!  Did miss the curls_ though. If I stopped the Accutane_ the acne came roaring back.  It was like a toggle switch.  Finally_ went off for good in anticipation of minor surgery_ decided to stay off because concerned about effect on bones_ starting to feel achy.  That was ten years ago.  Aches went away but acne got worse and worse_ spreading further and further_ tho. didn't get cystic until just 6 mo.s ago_ when seemed almost as bad as just before I started Accutane.  Worse_ my older skin does not heal or resist scarring as well as before. No point in going back to Accutane_ though: started going through menopause (at normal age for it) and acne comes,F,54,8  years,5/4/2007,Accutane

When hormone level drops_ wipes out acne_ brings on hot flashes and need to keep tweezers handy!  Bottom line: Accutane made huge difference in my life - from disgusting_ oily pizza face and upper body to silky skin_ no need for make up_ felt attractive_ fell in love_ got married_ etc.  Hoping bones not so affected by Accutane that it will make a second_ huge_ more negative effect on my life sometime down the road.

I was comfortable wearing no foundation or powder_ which I had not been before. During college it reappeared but shortly after beginning treatment my skin was clear again. The dry skin and chapped lips are annoying but become easy to deal with. I was glad to stop the treatment when I did because I began to experience depression symptoms.

I also had really high triglyceride levels.  The 2001 episode was similar but with less depression because I was prepared and took the drug for less time.  This drug affects all parts of your body in addition to your skin.  Perhaps the gi system_ joints_ brain.  We are the experiment...isnt that comforting.",DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG UNLESS U HAVE ACNE THAT IS SO BAD_ UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT POSSIBLE PERMANENT SIDE EFFECTS_ (possible with clear skin).  This drug is not a joke.  This is from someone educated in the medical field and has suffered from acne for a long time and tried other methods.

I feel guilty because I know of all the people who were in a worse situation than me and the drug has only given them more problems. I can do nothing other than be grateful and try to help others.

Then on my 6th month_ my skin one day just turned beet red and it was burning like crazy. I dropped out of school. I haven't left my house ever since this happened_ only to see 4 different doctors who all told me I have rosacea_ which I never had until accutane. And there is no cure for rosacea_ and every treatment they've had me try for it so far doesn't work. Rosacea is without a doubt a million times worse than acne will ever be. And my acne is returning now anyways_ only 3 months after I stopped the medicine. I regret accutane every second of my life_ and I sit in bed all day long wishing I was dead. I'll never have my life back.,This medicine has completely ruined my life. Make sure you really do your research before deciding to take a drug this serious.,F,19,6  months,3/30/2007Email,Accutane

491, 5, Prolonged Acne,Dry skin and lips,I am 21 and have suffered from acne out breaks weekly since the age of 12.  I have tried absolutely everything and finally broke down and took accutane.  I have been on it for over 2 months and I don't know why I didn't take it any sooner.  My back cleared up completely in 7 days_ and my face is almost completely clear. My hair looks more beautiful then ever because I don't have all the grease in it anymore_ and can go days with hair that looks like I just washed and dryed...Everyone responds differently but I am one of the true successes of accutane...there is hope....,F,21,2  days,3/23/2007Email,Accutane

I used to get wet before my fiance even touched me... now the only way we can have sex is by using lubricants.  I cry at least once a month because it's so bad.  I loved having sex and wanted it 24/7... now I actually dread it.  I've been off of Accutane for a year now and it hasn't cleared up.  My sex life is ruined!!,F,24,5  months,3/21/2007,Accutane
493, 4, severe cystic acne,dry mouth/lips_ eyes (stopped wearing contacts)_ dry nose_ vaginal dryness_ painful rash and some mild joint pain towards end of treatment,I took this medication nearly 8 years ago. I don't believe I've had any long-term side effects. I tend to have rather dry skin now_ still get chapped lips easily_ but that could easily be a function of a nearly 28 yr old body vs. a 20 yr. old body. No acne aside from very mild breakouts before my period. It did not clear my acne until the last few weeks of treatment_ but my skin continued to improve after stopping. I believe ortho-tri-cyclen   helped turn the tide in favor of clear skin. Psychologically_ I was very unhappy while taking this drug but some sad events occurred in my life around that period. However_ I did not feel down to the extent that it impeded my academic success or kept me from going out with friends. Yes_ it is poison_ so is chemotherapy as well as a lot of other useful drugs. The patient alone ultimately has to make an informed decision to accept the risk or accept the acne; the most informed doctor in the world cannot predict how an individual body will react t,F,27,50  months,3/17/2007,Accutane

495, 1, Acne,Dizzyness_ headaches_ dry lips_ first floaters_ then dimming of eyesight_ completely blacked out while driving.,The doctor was told several times about the side effects with the eyes and we were told it would disappear after a couple months.  The eyesight was getting worse_ and asked if I should see an eye dr._ but was told no.  Finally my mom took me to an opthalmalogist.  He took one look and asked if I was on an acne drug.  He said it is a common side effect.  I went into a ditch with my car as my sight went black just a short ways from a cliff.  I now have only tunnel vision and can no longer drive.  I am now a jr. in college working on a RN.  I would not recommend this drug_ expecially to people/girls that are heavy as I was at the time.  The dr. told me it happens more in over weight people. It has been three years since I stopped the drug.,F,20,6  months,3/10/2007,Accutane

I was depressed because of my acne_ and thankfully Accutane cleared up my complexion AND it CLEARED the depression.Having a first hand experience with Accutane I believe the negative accusations to be unfounded and politically charged.I now receive compliments about my ""flawless complexion"" and I do give credit where credit is due.",F,27,18  months,3/8/2007,Accutane

The hardest parts have been the red face with flushing and the hair loss.  I have now been off the drug for about a month and the facial redness has subsideed somewhat however blochy patches of red remain espically  around my eyes and upper nose.  The hair loss has by far been the worse!  It started allmost immeditaly once I started the medication and never went away.  I stuck it out and was told the hairloss would stop once I stoped the medication.  So far that has not been the case just as much hair falling out as when I was on the medication.  With all this in mind I have not had the smallest zit in over 4 months.  I cleared my skin up and I know I wont ever have to worry about acne ever again_ however I feel I might have traded in my acne for a permentaly red face and a thiner haired head. Time will tell if these side effects eventually go away. If they do then the drug is worth it_ if they dont it might have been a mistake for me to go on,M,21,4.5  months,3/4/2007,Accutane

499, 5, Cystic Acne,Temporary flare up of acne within first couple of weeks of taking Accutane. Extremely chapped lips; sore lower back and joints; upper arms_ top of hands_ and fore-arms extremely and painfully dry. Bouts of fatigue and weakness despite sleeping well at night. Also experienced mood swings_ and my night vision was impaired.,While a teenager_ I had sporadic episodes of acne_ which I treated with over the counter remedies. I didn't erupt into cystic acne until my late 20s_ early 30s_ which did not respond to over the counter remedies or topical prescription creams - accutane was my last resort. I just started my final_ fifth month of taking Accutane_ and my skin is 100% clear. I've used Aquaphor on my lips for chapping_ and a good oil free moisturizer on my face and arms for dryness. But_ I've not been able to work out at the gym because of joint discomfort and fatigue_ or drive at night because of night blindness. I also gained weight while on Accutane. I'm more than 50% sure I won't take Accutane again if acne re-emerges.,M,33,4  months,2/22/2007,Accutane

501, 1, Bad Acne,It cleared up my acne but left my face with severe scarring.  I took this when I was 20 and had ZERO scars before my treatment.  I had suffered from bad acne for several years_ but my skin was always resilient and NEVER scarred before I got on Accutane.  No one in my large family has any acne scars either although most suffered from bad acne in their youth.  After my treatment finished_ the acne was gone_ but to my horror I was left with countless deep acne scars on my face.  When visiting my best friend_ his little sister_ age 4 at the time_ asked if someone had burned a cigarette on my face.  Children can be brutally honest. I've spent thousands of dollars on plastic surgery for my scars (deep chemical peels and fat injections) with some success_ but of course some scarring will always remain.,THIS IS A SERIOUS DRUG WITH SERIOUS POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS!  Don't take this unless you fully understand the potential side effects.  Many are NOT listed by the manufacturer and Doctors can be surprisingly ignorant of them.,M,35,6  months,2/22/2007,Accutane

504, 1, persistent acne,During the 5th month of a 6 month treatment_ I developed depression and anxiety_ moodiness_ fatigue_ night sweats_ joint pain_ vaginal dryness_ decreased night vision_ and worst of all a COMPLETE loss of libido.  (Depression subsided after drug completed; however_ the other symptoms persist 5 years later.),I had a course of Accutane in the late 80's with good results and no lasting side-effects_ so at 30_ I decided to take it again. This drug WILL clear your acne_ but I would caution adult women from the drug_ because for me_ the side-effects were far more serious than they were at 16.  I lived 30 years without 1 day of depression_ and I am convinced this drug causes it.  After stopping_ the depression completely vanished and has been gone for 5 years.  Unfortunately_ the other side effects developed during treatment such as loss of libido_ moodiness_ night vision issues_ extreme fatigue and joint pain continue to persist.  I'd take my old acne back in a second to get rid of these new problems!,F,35,6  months,2/5/2007,Accutane
505, 5, Deep cystic acne,Acne does worsen in first two months (IT'S SUPPOSED TO! Your shedding skin brings up the lower skin layers_ and extracts all the built up acne beneath). Extreme dryness EVERYWHERE (all bodily oils are none-existant; can find relief with nasal lubricants_ very dry skin moisturizers and LIP MEDEX BY BLISTEX SAVED MY LIPS when applied at least 20-30 times a day. Just carry some around in every pocket. It's really cheap too.)The only bonus was that my hair was no longer greasy. Bleaker outlook on life_ phases of depression_ grey-like skin for 2 months after treatment. Altered bowel cycle (minor IBS-Irritable Bowel Syndrome). Extreme fatigue (always wanting to sleep),It is a VERY SCARY drug. Be sure to prepare when taking it. Stock up on Medicated lip balm (LIP MEDEX BY BLISTEX!)_ moisturizers & lubricants (for nose and intercourse!). Many people feel even more depressed then usual_ and self-esteem is low. It's important to be aware that this may happen_ and let as many people around you know what you're taking and going through. It helps to keep busy_ work/school_ take up fun hobbies (I watched a whole lot of movies with close friends during my accutane phase). Accutane is tough in winter (coldness_ dryness_ wind burn is harsh on fragile skin) and difficult in summer as well (DO NOT GET ANY SUN WHATSOEVER! 60 SPF!). My presecription was 60mg a day_ but doses vary from person to person_ and from dermotologist to dermotologist. Lastly_ it's quite expensive! Be ready for all this. Although it was hard to go through_ my skin is now amazing (minus a bit of scarring). It'll change your life :),F,20,5  months,2/1/2007,Accutane

507, 5, Cystic Acne,So far_ so good. It's been one week and I am only on 20mg/day. My lips are a bit dry_ but I am sure the dry weather is not helping. Skin is peeling off of my nose_ kind of like a shedding. And my forehead has erupted into a mass of acne. It's funny because I would usually have a few little breakouts there_ but nothing I would complain about compared to the grape-sized cysts on my face. I guess the Accutane is forcing my body to 'purge' everything from the inside out_ and my forehead had a lot in there! The cysts are barely noticable in size now (albeit the doc also injected them with steroids 7 days ago.) I had very bad stomach cramping a few days ago_ about half an hour after taking the meds_ but it didn't last long. Finally_ I am suffering from very acute tailbone pain. I actually hopped on line to see if anyone else was having the same.,This is my second round on Accutane. The first time was 6 years ago and I was on up to 60 mg/day. Side effects then were more severe in terms of the stomach cramping. Others also said that they noticed mood swings... I can't confirm that I felt too different though. In addition_ my night vision suffered then as well.... However_ the results were good and I didn't suffer from bad skin for about 5 and a half years after finishing that round.,F,30,7  days,1/28/2007Email,Accutane

I must shower with a special soap or I have painful dryness.   ,Accurate did clear my acne.. and I did have it bad.  People talk about the emotional and depression part of Accutane.. I did not experience anything related to that.  The huge open acne wounds were a pretty depressing thing_ so it doesn't surprise me that folks who take it show a higher rate of depression over normal folks_ they're depressed from their acne_ not the drug.

I also had fleeting thoughts of suicide on several occasions because it felt like a hopeless situation that I had no control over. Its not like obesity because you can control that. Severe acne came to dominate my every thought when I was outside  of the house. I first tried all the topical treatments like Oxy(what a joke) because I really didn't know what worked. Then I tried Retin-A which I hear is a decent product but it really isn't meant for SEVERE ACNE. It was at that point that I decided to take the step and try Accutane because I heard from some high school classmates that it worked for them and I really had to try something_ ANYTHING_ to get rid of this crap that was on my face and ruining my life.

Some depression_ dry eyes_ intestinal problems_ difficulty concentrating. All of these symptoms even 20 years after taking the drug.,This is a miracle drug and I can live with the side effects. I felt cursed with horrible acne for so many years that I inherited from my father and grandfather. It was not unusual for me to discover 2 or 3 new cysts everyday on just about any part of my body. I always had horrific bleeding and puss filled canalizing cysts on my face_ back_ chest and buttocks. It was painful and embarrassing and seeing dermatologists throughout my teenage years yielded no results. I went through dozens of different treatments from antibiotics to lotions to UV therapy and the doctor freezing off cysts. It is a wonder to me that I could have any friends and even meet a woman who would accept me as I was afflicted but somehow I made it through all that. When I heard about acutane (around age 27 in 1986)I immeadiatley went for the treatment_ willing to pay any price. It was a miracle to me that in a few short months 90% of my acne was gone. I opted to not go for a 2nd treatment 5 years later. I can live wit,M,47,90  days,12/11/2006,Accutane

My acne got so bad for the first couple of months of taking this medicine that I didnt even want to leave my house. but now after four months my skin is completely clear.

534, 5, cystic acne for years,chapped lips_ dry face_ some muscle pains.,First off Accutane is absolutely amazing_ I do not know why I didn't start it earlier.  I've never been happier in my life_ I noticed results after a week and a half of being on the drug.  My oil stopped dead in it's tracks and my pores shrunk!  Absolutely amazing!  My face is so firm and tight because I no longer have big pores.  I never broke out badly_ only a few pimples on my chin_ none on my cheeks or forehead.  It greatly reduces the appearances of the red marks also_ I think maybe due to the shrinking of the pores.  I have two months left on accutane_ I'm on the 20 mg_ but as of now I'm completely acne free.  The first two weeks you will notice all of your blackheads rising to the surface and you can just rub them off.  My face is flaky at times but never oily!  The only problems I've had while being on Accutane is_ yes you do get very chapped lips_ not really that big of a deal though_ no loss of hair (my hair actually looks healthier because it cleared up the oil in that area,F,,2  months,11/21/2006,Accutane
535, 5, Cystic acne,Dry lips_ transient joint pain_ dry anus.  No fatigue or depression. No redness or worsening of acne.,I use Aquaphor for the dry lips.  I work out pretty intensly and have to watch out for joint fatigue so I don't get hurt (at my age I have to be very careful).  I take Metamucil to avoid bloody butt tears.  I try and drink a lot of water but it's been hard to do since I really hate water_ unless there is nothing else to drink.  Don't listen to that poster about accutane NOT causing depression.  She posts on another site and goes on and on about the same thing.  Not sure what her problem is.  Lots of people complain about mood changes while on Accutane.  She really doesn't know what she's talking about.  If you get depressed while taking accutane_ see your doc.  They can put you on something until you feel better (which may be after you finish accutane).,F,40,2  months,11/19/2006,Accutane

Anyone reading this who is comtemplating going on it_ do not. Although it seems that the odds of you developing some crazy side effect are small_ it seems to be happening more than people realize_ and none of them are worth the chance of no longer having acne.

Cleared up acne very quickly and effectively_ but side effects may not be worth it!,Drink at least a gallon of water a day & constantly apply moisturizer to your lips and skin.  I lost my voice if I didn't constantly drink water while on accutane.  My lips would swell up unless I put Aquiphor gel on them every hour.  And I didn't believe that a pill could really change your personality_ but this one seems to.  I stopped taking it a month early but still have panic and anger attacks.  It is hard to drive without road-raging and I lose patience with people like never before.  I think that it made me defensive_ insecure_ and almost suicidal.  It wore me out_ but cleared my skin and scalp better than the last 13 acne meds I have taken.  I don't know if it was worth it_ though.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they are very carfully monitored bc I really think it causes depressed/suicidal thoughts in some people that can linger even after you are done with the pills.,F,27,4  months,10/24/2006Email,Accutane
543, 5, 20 yrs of acne_ cystic in later yrs,You must adapt to this drug rather it adapting to you. Every day can be different. I had severely *cracked lips*: drink a lot of water plus more and use intensive lip balm. *Nose bleeds*: keep your nose moist with a nasal spray and/or a triple antibiotic cream applied with a q-tip and rubbed gently inside. I was severely *fatigued* at times - take a B-complex supplement as advised by pharmacist (Huge difference! I couldn't have gotten through the day without it!). *Dry skin*: upgrade your moisturizer from the fruity light ones to a heavy duty grade. If you workout be prepared to scale down a bit as your *joints and muscles* will be sore and uncooperative. At times your *eyes* may be irritated especially if you wear contacts: have eye drops on hand. Your skin may become thinner so *bruising and scratches* will onset easily. Wounds in general will take longer to heal including active acne. If you are a picker_ you will *scar* easily. A slight change in mood - a bit more emotionally sad.,I have had facial acne for just under 20 years. In later years it turned into cystic painful acne on my face and acne on my shoulders_ back_ arms and chest. I became socially withdrawn because it had become so bad. I am 100% clear on my shoulders_ back_ arms and chest. I am not 100% clear yet on my face where it was the worst. I went from about 30 active pimples a day on my face alone down to about 2-3 little non-cystic ones. I still have a few weeks left of the drug itself and the Dr. said it will continue to work for a few more weeks after that. Overall_ I am very pleased with this drug and wished that I had started it sooner to save myself from years of sadness and scars. One last word of advice: take pictures before and during treatment! It truly helps heal the emotional scaring of acne.,F,29,5  months,10/23/2006,Accutane

About an hour after taking the first dose I developed a headache. Pain relievers did not help it. After two days on the drug my headache was so painful I was in tears. Light affected me and any noise seemed extremely loud and hurt my ears. My joints ached when I moved. My skin was so sensitive and my body so dehydrated that if I clutched anything tightly in my hand_ the imprint of it stayed on my hand for an hour later. It hurt to open a water bottle. I stopped taking the drug and my doctor told me I had had a migraine. I have never had a migraine before in my life and my family has no history of it. It was extremely painful and I may not be able to take the drug_ even on a lower dosage. I did notice immediate improvement in my pimples_ which shrunk in size. I guess this drug just wasn't for me.

My acne became seriously worse for a long time before it got better. I developed and still have digestive problems and urinary problems_ but the urinary problems may have been from before. The texture of my hair changed; my hair went from thick and straight to very thin and curly. It didn't change back until after I stopped taking Accutane.,I did get slightly depressed_ but I do not contribute it to the Accutane. I think I was upset that the medicine wasn't working as I had hoped.

My face would burn_ sometimes even if I put lotion on to get rid of the dryness it would burn.  My nose would bleed_ and my doctor told me to get saline spray for the dryness_ but it did not work.  All the saline spray did was give me a sore throat.  My lips were so dry that no matter what I bought for dry lips_ nothing worked. I tried Chapstick overnight_ neosporin for lips_ Blistex severe_ nothing worked.  The whole time I took the drug all I wanted was to be off of it.

601, 2, the usual reasons,,Most of the side effects associated with taking Accutane are the same as for vitamin A toxicity. If you are considering using this drug please read information on vit.A tox. in addition to the literatue on Accutane. Taking it is essentially putting you into the same physical state and it's a coin toss as to what extent of damage you'll receive. No one_ doctor or otherwise_ can tell the outcome you'll have on it. What is your gut reaction_ your intuition_ when considering to take it? Listen to yourself. Best wishes_ truly_ best wishes.,F,30, ,1/25/2006,Accutane
602, 1, -,,This is for the girls/women thinking of using the drug. Since skin problems are directly tied to testosterone_ either over production or a hyper-sensitivity to it_ please investigate possible hormone controlling drugs in addition to the topicals to really get a handle on the problem. Some birth control pills help some women. (like Yasmine or Ortho Tri-Cyclin). Also_ please check out websites on P.C.O.S._ or poly cycstic ovarian syndrome to see if you have other symptoms_ because you may have an underlying ovarian problem which can cause chronic skin problems too. So_ look into these things first_ because they have a much safer track record than Accutane. And note: all birth control pills are slightly different_ so if you get bad results with one_ try another before you write it off as a possible answer. Good luck!,F,28,1  days,1/25/2006,Accutane

She is a beautiful talented girl who has become intraverted_ depressed and very angry!  Her acne is 10 times worse now than it was to begin with.  She is having severe back pain - joint pain and intestinal problems.  The doctor says that these side affects are not from the accutane (inferring that she is just making them up).  I see what she is going through and my heart is breaking. I worry for her future.  She won't leave the house and is refusing to go to school.  A once high honor student is at risk of failing because of attendance.  The school does not understand why she can't go to school for ""skin problems""! I am at my wits end!  I want to take her off but she refuses still hoping it is going to work.  I wish we never started.",,F,16,6  weeks,1/1/2006Email,Accutane

Im fearful that I may have done permanent damage to my bones/joints. No one in my family has arthritis ... yikes. My skin is much improved althought not perfect and if this joint pain continues- then it was not at all worth it. I dont think this drug should be legal.

Two years later all hell broke loose.,"Accutane cleared the acne. A couple years after treatment_ I started having bad joint pain. The doctors were puzzled. Finally_ I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. It was horrible and I could barely walk or use my hands. At the same time_ I developed Blepharitis (red eyelids) with recurring Chalazions. Now I find out I have decreased bone mass. After treatment with chemotherapy_ the joint pain subsided and the Rheumatologist says he doesn't understand and says he doesn't know if I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. The Blepharitis continues though I don't think it's as bad as it was. Now_ what is interesting - there is no family history of these problems. None. I was healthy and then at age 21 started feeling like I was 75. The only thing that I did differently than any other family member was to take Accutane. Stay away from this ""drug"".

For me_ my skin has never been worse after accutane_ even when I had moderate breakouts that didn't respond to topical treatments. It left pitted scars everywhere on my face where I had breakouts (many of which came from taking accutane). I had very itchy rashes on my hands and on my face that was a result of the side effect_ and the acne healed sooo slowly throught the treatment (more than 2 weeks_ even 1 month for most). They also turned into scabs as they were healing_ which made my face even worse. So if I had to tell someone about accutane_ i'd say don't ever take it based on my own experience.

My skin is still clear and I am very happy about that.  The acne is completely gone -- no breakouts at all on my face_ back_ neck_ chest.  Some mild oiliness has returned to my face -- but it is definitely within the normal range.  Overall_ I am satisfied -- but I had_ and continue to have_ definite side effects.

Dry skin and skin peels to reveal new skin esp. on the face (Neutrogena face lotion helps a lot and Nivea for a body lotion). Appetite has increased. Much more emotional and susceptible to crying (drives my husband crazy!!),This drug has helped clear out so much of my skin. I also had acne on my back and it has helped to clear that up as well. The side effects are not enormous when I look at the benefits. I only hope the benefits will last for a long time.,F,27,60  days,5/10/2005Email,Accutane
652, 5, moderate acne,morning nose bleeds.  Extremely dry lips that can sometimes develope into cold sore. Dry tired eyes.  Rash that comes and go on the back of my hands and forearms.  Sunburn easily.  Joint pain(more than I expected).  Early in treatment developed nasty cold that had to be treated with antibiotics-FYI don't mix these two drugs.,I have been working in a medispa for 5 years and have really tried everything for my acne(glycolic_ microderm_ blue light_ antibiotics_ etc)  Accutane is the only thing that has positivly changed my skin.,F,26,3  months,5/6/2005,Accutane
653, 1, Severe acne on back,Accutane worked like magic on my back. I was really_ really happy to finally be able to wear a T-shirt after hiding my back for a decade. Then a year later_ I started to get dry spots. Now I am 31_ and have gone through bouts of major depression. I would not recommend this drug_ and I want them to fix my brain. I want the happy life that should have been mine.,I hate the doctor who prescribed it to me without taking care of the side effects. I have now lost faith in most doctors.,F,25,8  months,5/3/2005Email,Accutane
654, 5, below moderate acne,Dry lips_ occasional joint pains,accutane is freakin great! i've been on it for almost 9 weeks now and it's drastically improving my skin. i have so much more confidence now that i'm on it. it's way better than the other medicine your dermatologists have prescribed you before you have taken it. i totally recommend anyone who suffers with acne to go on accutane. i know side effects vary from person to person_ but i haven't experienced anything worse than dry lips or joint paints that arent even that bad. all i have to do is take pain reliever and i'm fine. aaand_ my skin used to be really oily that i would always have to wipe it with those oil patch things_ but now everytime i feel my skin_ its perfectly normal_ the way it should be. i really wish i had taken this a few months sooner_ when my dermatologist told me about this drug. it's unbelievably amazing! well_ i dont know_ maybe i'm not experiencing much side effects due to my age. i started it at 15. now im 16 and still continuing taking this...i heard that those older will feel more pain and discomfort on this drug. but besides that... who invented this anyway? its GREAT! good job.,F,16,9  weeks,4/30/2005Email,Accutane

656, 5, Acne_ cystic acne,dry eyes_ dry lips_ dry inside of my nose_ dry skin on ears_ tiredness/laziness_ a little bit of joint stiffness,This is the best drug ever for acne.  It's amazing.  I used to have such oil skin/hair_ I could shower three times a day and still be oily.  Now_ after being on accutane for 4 months_ I could go for a week without washing my hair and it still wouldn't be oily!  It's amazing.  My skin is beautiful now_ and I get lots of compliments on it.  I say if you're thinking of taking it_ just try it.  And if you do get depression while you are on it_ talk to a counselor right away.  The clear face is worth it.  No bumps or sores on my face!  YAY!,F,20,5  months,4/20/2005,Accutane
657, 5, Nodular and cycstic acne,severely dried lips_ bloody noses_ peeling skin_ dry skin,I had to go on accutane twice.  My skin has never been so beautiful.  It looks great.  I don't regret being on accutane at all.  As long as you've got a tough immune system and can put up with side affects_ go for it.  You've got a clear face to look forward to and confidence to come along with it.,M,26,2  times,4/20/2005,Accutane
658, 5, cystic acne,No severe side effects except dry lips for my first two episodes of acutane usage.  This third time around (20 years later) is different.  Dry lips (normal) and some kind of rash on my hands which is now spreading up my arms and back.  It's itchy_ sore and looks horrible.  Doctor says it's a normal reaction but I never experienced it with previous intakes.  Honestly don't know if it's a normal reaction to the drug or if it's in anyway a dangerous symptom.  Doctor doesn't seem to concerned about it and has given me cortisone cream.,Took accutane in my early 20's (still experimental then) and again in my later 20's.  Went 20 years with pretty much no cystic acne problems and now it's came back again in my 40's.  This is the 3rd time I've been on the drug but it is the only drug that eliminated the cystic acne for me.  All other prescriptions were worthless.,F,43,3  months,4/15/2005,Accutane
659, 3, severe acne,severely chapped lips and dry skin_ bloody nose_ muscle soreness_ joint and lower back pain_ dry eyes_ sunburn easily_ high cholesterol,good results on face_ but not on my back_ but the side effects are horrible_ higher than usual doses,M,16,7  days,4/7/2005,Accutane
660, 5, acute acne on face and neck,dry lips_ dry forearms which developed into a rash when I sweat,I didn't suffer any mood swings or depression from the drug. I swear by it. I had wrestled with the decision to take accutane for years and I wish I'd taken it sooner.,F,28,7  months,4/5/2005,Accutane
661, 4, Acne,Dry lips_ a little joint stiffness.,I took lose dosage accutane_ only 120mg a week_ basically a pill every other day.  It works_ no question about it.  Not sure if it is worth the expense or the side effects.  I would never go on a full blown course of it.,M,29,12  months,3/31/2005,Accutane
662, 5, nodular scarring acne for 15 years,dry lips_ dry cracked hands/knuckles_ dry skin generally,It's easy to give in to hyperbole and call this a miracle drug. But that's how I felt. For me the depression caused by acne was occasionally horrible. This drug worked quickly and even after going off_ acne was rare_ not nodular_ and very tolerable. I wish I had taken it earlier.  Now many years later I get an occasional acne lesion_ and I sometimes would like to take it again_ but the dermatologist i saw discouraged me. If you have bad acne_ that scars your skin_ or scars your psyche and self-esteem_ seriously consider this drug. Its not perfect_ but get informed and if your skin is bad enough and you understand the risks_ it can be a lifesaver. The person who makes a better accutane will be a billionaire.,M,30,6  months,3/29/2005,Accutane

665, 5, Cystic acne,The main side effect I had was flaky skin. Near the end of the third month_ I got odd bumps on my knuckles and small black lines (look like splinters) under my nails. My derm referred me to a cardiologist_ who found nothing wrong. I've been off of accutane for two years_ but I still get knuckle bumps and nail lines intermittently_ along with lips that peel constantly.,I love my skin now. I actually get complements on it! Though my skin is still oily_ it's not nearly as oily as it was - and it's remarkably clear and smooth. Well worth the mild side effects.,F,27,3  months,2/22/2005,Accutane
666, 5, Cystic Acne,Lower Back - joint pain_ dry lips_ lethargy_ sweaty eyebrows (just noted that someone else had this!),I have been pleasantly surprised - My face is finally clear!

668, 1, acne,Tried to commit suicide,I have never had any sort of depression history in my family or in my life.  I figured since this drug was doing what it was supposed to be doing...making me feel better about myself_ then why would I be depressed.  I honestly thought it was hype about the depression_ and I didnt believe it.  5 months after being on the drug_ I began having severe mood swings.  I would lay in bed all day and just cry.  Finally one night out of nowhere_ I tried to kill myself.  Now my entire family thinks I am insane_ and I dropped out of college_ because everyone knows.  I had to stop taking accutane because it made me nuts.  AND to top it all off_ I've got pimples again.  So I dont even know which is better.,F,19,7  months,2/14/2005,Accutane

671, 5, acne_ nodular acne on neck and back,Dry lips_ My face is getting really dry and therefore causing a little flaking and is also a little red.,So far so good.  When I started taking it I had nodular acne all over my back and neck and spotty acne around my lips.  I have already noticed that most all the nodules on my neck and back are clearing up and my face is doing better too.  The drying effect on my lips is a little aggrivating_ but its already been worth it.  Two weeks taking it_ and no new zits.  If this keeps up I will be very happy.  Some of the people on here want to blame accutane for there problems_ but I think some of there problems would have existed regardless of accutane.  Sometimes on these sites you see a lot more complaining than you do praising and thats just human nature_ If everything is working good you dont usually post anything.  I am making this post for all those out there considering it.  I waited a long time to do this and wish I would have done it earlier.  I know I have not been taking it long_ but let me tell you_ so far it has been great aside from the dry lips_ which to me is worth it because I am getting rid of this ridiculous freakin acne.,M,32,2  weeks,2/9/2005,Accutane
672, 5, bad ance; nodular & cystic,Dryness of eyes_ inside of nose.  Severly chapped lips.,I have only been on it for 1 month so far.  i will continue for the next four months.  I have seen an incredible difference so far and nothing has helped me to this extent in the past.  The chapped  lip are annoying_ but totally worth it.  I am 20 and past the teenage hormonal stage_ so I don't know if it would have cleared up on its own.  I have had few breakouts since I started the treatment and I noticed an incredible difference right away.  My skin actually feels soft.  I feel more confident about my skin too.  I understand that it affects people differently_ but one should not rule out trying it just because they have heard bad things about it.  You and your doctor know what is best for your body and if it helps_ I am working with one of the top derms in the country who would not recommend the drug if you were not a good candidate for it.,F,20,4  weeks,1/29/2005,Accutane
673, 2, Acne-last resort medication,Extremely dry skin to the point of cracking and bleeding. I had a scab on my nose for most of my treatment. I was severly depressed and have had cycles of depression (with suicidal thoughts) for the 11 years since taking it. I also developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).,It cleared up my severe acne_ but I still break out_ even on Ortho-tricyclen_ which is a birth control that's supposed to help acne. I know how it feels to want clear skin so bad that you don't care about the side effects_ but my life has been severly impacted by the depression and IBS that I developed (most likely as a result of Accutane).,F,27,6  months,1/26/2005,Accutane

678, 3, moderate to severe acne,Just about everything the book warned of - tiredness_ sore joints and dry skin_ painful eyes_ painful bowel movements_ stomach cramps_ general sense of exhaustion and lethargy_ and heartburn - I could feel food crawling down my dry throat and oesophagus.   However_ the whole time I was on it_ I did not have one pimple!,The treatment hasn't cured my acne_ but it's made it a lot better.  I've gone from ugly_ huge_ cystic welts to a smattering of pimples.  I had to give up martial arts and weight trainign after a while_ and I think I have done quite severe damage to my joints.  Was it worth it?  At the time_ yes.  I was paranoid as hell about my face_ and it was affecting my career (who wants a spotty employee in a high end professional job?).  However_ I fear that in the long term I may well change my mind.,F,28,12  months,12/23/2004,Accutane

Extremely painful bowel movements due to lack of normal body lubricants.,My acne was completely gone for about a year then started to progress_ although not as badly as when I went on to Accutane.  I am now using Proactiv to control my acne with very good results_ and no side effects.  I would not do it again.,F,33,6  months,11/19/2004,Accutane

682, 5, Acne,Dry skin and lips_ almost no oil in my hair (nice!)_ some joint and bone pain_ bad lower back pain towards the end of treatment_ redish skin tone_ acne got a whole lot worse the first two months of treatment.,A lot of people talk about depression_ how accutane can cause suicidal thoughts_ and that the drug should be banned.  I do not deny accutane could have caused such things in some people_ but this does not mean people should avoid the drug.  During my whole 6 months of treatment my best friend relapsed into cancer_ was diagnosed as terminal_ and passed away.  If accutane was going to cause any kind of mental problems with me it surely would have done so with all that I was going through_ but I experienced nothing besides normal grief.  And believe me_ my doc was watching me VERY closely!  So apparently some people may have problems with accutane_ while others like myself dont.  The decision should be made on a person by person basis_ and I would do it all over again.  For some people_ it is a miracle drug!  My skin is great now though I still have a few zits every now and then.,F,19,6  months,11/5/2004Email,Accutane

I experienced pretty bad side effects_ but feel it was worth it. I would take it again in a heart beat if it was necessary- which it is not. Went 2 full years w/o breakouts. Now I get 1 or 2 pimples during my monthly cycle that go away fairly easily.,F,40,7  months,10/19/2004,Accutane

688, 2, acne- nodular,Sore anus when having BM and stomach aches that seemed to be related to the tender/tearing tissue in my body.  I think what was happening on the outside of my body (severe dryness) was happening on the inside.  Also_ my cervical mucus was almost non-existent and made sex unenjoyable.  About a month after stopping the drug_ all these symptoms had vanished.,Accutane did clear up my acne some.  I no longer have the big nodular zits that I once did_ but now I seem to get acne in places I haven't before.  I stopped taking the pills after 4 months because the side effects were unbearable.,F,29,4  months,3/23/2004,Accutane
