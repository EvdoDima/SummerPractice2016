1, 1, Acne,"Took this drug from HELL when I was 22 and I'm 37 now.
It has ruined my liver and kidneys.
Many digestive problems.
Depression_ burnout_anxiety_suicidal thoughts. The mental stuff I manage through homoeopathy.
Long term ligament and tendon dysfunction.
Neurologically never the same.
The list goes on. 
Do not take this drug.
Acne is a symptom of an underlying problem. Usually related to toxicity or hormones which can be corrected by homoeopathy. 
Please do not take this drug. You might be one of the unlucky people who end up struggling for the rest of your life.

Suffer from EXTREME pain_ systemically. **I was perfectly healthy all my life. I was actually the healthiest one in my family apart from having acne. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG! Posted are my symptoms I constantly struggle with to this very day. Note: MANY of these symptoms are common among Accutane users.
Accutane seems to be able to modulate MANY genes.
Here is a forum thread related to the effects of Accutane:
http://www.acne.org/messageboard/topic/295030-repairing-the-long-term-damage-from-accutane/

Intense_ chronic systemic muscle and joint pain
*The pain does not come in waves. It's constant. It has never let up
It feels like all of my soft tissues are calcified
My muscle fibers are fibrous and knotted

Hands and feet will tingle and tremor constantly

Muscle spasms

Joints all crack and pop (mainly elbows_ wrists_ and knees_ and shoulders). They","Very poor night vision (Accutane seems to cause vitamin A deficiency)

Hair started falling out rapidly a year after the Accutane course. It would fall out in clumps in the shower. Dry hair texture
*Through diet and supplements_ I've got it to stop falling out. However_ it's still incredibly thin
Pictures of my hair:
Chronic acid reflux independent of what I eat or do. (destroying my esophagus and teeth and tongue)
*Slowly_ this has gotten better over the years

Red dots all over tip of tongue (inflamed taste buds?) Nutrient deficiency related? Infection related?

VERY poor digestion and absorption (I had intestinal permeability with loads of nutrient deficiencies_ like B vitamins_ CoQ10_ lipoic acid_ despite nutrient rich diet and supplementation). Have done multiple things to try to heal my gut to no avail

Can feel colon spasming sometimes depending on what I eat

Intestines seem distended at all times despite what I eat. It doesn't seem to be gas as I fasted for five days and my intestines remained ""bloated"" looking

Lots of tonsil stones which contribute to bad breath. The tonsil stones get WAY worse if I ingest any mucus forming foods like dairy or eggs

Messed up neurotransmitters accompanied by depression_ anxiety_ suicidal thoughts_ etc

Very poor_ sluggish blood flow. My blood seems thick and viscous

Possible hiatal hernia with red inflamed stomach lining

Abdomen remains tight. It's difficult to take a full diaphragmatic breath (p",M,22,5  months80 1X D,4/14/2016Email,Accutane

My periods have been mega heavy since taking this drug my dermatologist said its not related?? Headaches_ nose bleeds_ skin peeling_ dry nose,Ok I'm 34_ still currently taking this. I tried everything prior to this drug it's been the last resort. My acne is not as sever as other people but it was bad enough to make me unhappy as when I'd get a flare up the spots would all come at once & were huge & sore & red. I've always used body shop concealer pencil to cover my spots it's the best product I've ever used for my skin. Anyway I'd say take photos whilst your on this drug so you can see how far you've come in stages with this drug. The first week on it_ I definitely wasn't me_ I was mega irritable. My skin started to peel at first (like when you've been sunburnt & your skins peeling off) my spots started to improve within a couple of days I was well happy. Then they started to get worse. If any of you want to email me you can I will send you pics of what my skin looked like & what it looks like now. Anyway a week into it my skin was awful red & sore & mega sensitive I had to stop using my usual cleanser it was too harsh. I started to get headaches persistently for a long time  (which I don't seem to be having problems with at this stage now) I found peppermint tea helped with headaches also my mood swings oh & also vasaline is best for your lips!

13, 1, moderate acne,I have suffered with acne ever since i started high school and i have always been so self conscious and been ashamed of myself for the way i look. I have always known accutane is a dangerous drug to take but it was a last resort as everything else i tried didn't work. I was very dry but had no side effects until 3 months into my treatment. I got pink eye and it wouldn't go away even with antibacterial eyedrops it was still quite bad. My dermatologist told me it was very unlikely the accutane would be causing this. I went off accutane as i also started getting head aches_ even after going off the accutane my side effects are now continuing even worst_ i have terrible sinus pain_ back pain_ head aches_ droopy/puffy eyes_ i have had bloating and this is all happening once i have gone off the accutane which is really scary. 1 month after being off accutane these side effects are still bad_ i'm glad i wasn't on it longer and on a higher dose. The dermatologists a?re making mega bucks off this medication and they won't tell you how bad for your body it really is. The number one cause of disease is dehydration and that's what accutane does it sucks your body dry. These side effects are so much more common than you realise and the list goes on and on of possible side effects you may receive while you are on the medication or in a lot of cases like mine once you come off it aswell.

14, 1, Acne,"Well_ I never thought I'd ever share it_ but yeah.

Accutane destroyed my sex drive.
It's not that I can't get an erection or anything_ it's just that.. When I start having a sexual intercourse withmy girlfriend_ I don't last long at all. I can barely ever get her to come and it's pretty hard on my self esteem. You may say - 'Why don't you foreplay more?' There's a limit to foreplay_ get real.

Regardless_ I'm not going to die from this_ I've been through worse.
However_ I completely recommend AVOIDING ACCUTANE AT ALL COST.

You'd rather have problems with sex than having acne? 
That's the worse mistake you can ever make.
That's.. The worse mistake I ever made.

My acne did go away - not completely_ but it did prove to be very efficient after a little over than 6 months.
Regardless_ it was not worth it.

18, 5, Resistant acne,Dry lips which started right away_ lips would get so try if I forgot to put on lib balm my lips would dry_ crack_ and swell. Aquaphor was a godsend (and cheap!) and so was Dr. Dans Cortibalm (order online). The Cortibalm helped when my lips would swell_ Aquaphor kept them from drying out the longest. Back pain_ noticed this when dose increased to 60mg (this was helped GREATLY by drinking 1-2L of water a day_ also fish oil)_ dry skin (had to get a steroid cream from the doc)_ thirst (once again_ water helped the most) and fatigue (felt like my body was being taxed),"Accutane gave me skin I thought I could never have and I couldn't be happier. Since middle school I had acne that just was
n't being controlled with over the counter washes/creams and prescription lotions/retinoids. Antibiotics worked_ but what's the point? The acne comes back when you finish and you can't stay on antibiotics forever. The topicals WERE helping_ but just not enough. I was working too hard and spending too much to still be breaking out (when I went on Accutane I was using Aczone 2x a day_ an antibiotic lotion 2x a day_ a retinoid 1x a day_ and an antibiotic by mouth 2x a day) and still my acne was not controlled. It was like treating a wildfire with a garden hose. I was hesitant to go on Accutane because of all the stories you hear about it but I made sure I got my blood work done monthly and saw my doctor and I was fine. Take your time with it_ there's a dose cumulative that you should reach for it to work the best with the least chance of relapse (120-150mg/kg of body weight). I did 30mg for the first month_ 40mg for the second. and 60mg for months 3-6. Month 3 is when the magic happened_ up until then my skin was ""purging"" - oily_ big breakouts_ etc. I used a gentle face wash and good moisturizer and that was all on Accutane and it completely cleared my skin. I'm one month off and the side effects have almost entirely gone away and my skins still great :) Accutane has given me more than clear skin_ it's given me my confidence and self esteem back.",M,17,6  months60,5/29/2015Email,Accutane

The side effects I got consisted of dry skin and dry eyes mostly. Dry skin is easily treated with lotion and dry eyes were very annoying. I ended up downing a few gallons of water probably each day and eye drops to combat that. Otherwise_ no major side effects for me.,I would recommend this IF you are incredibly desperate. The above peope had some bad experiences but I had none. If anything I got happier as the months passed and my face cleared up. I am 6 months past my course of Accutane now.

On top of all the usual side effects (every part of your body drying up to the point people presume you have leprosy)_ I got hit with a tonne of the ""rare"" side effects as well (OBVIOUSLY NOT THAT RARE).

3 months into my 4 month course: severe_ crippling anxiety. Like being trapped in a waking nightmare with no way to stop it. Totally physiological_ no life circumstances triggered this. Decided to end my course a month early and admitted myself into the ER for emergency psychiatric intervention. I now know why so many people have killed themselves on this drug. The psychosis it can cause is truly Hell-ish. Without medical intervention_ dying would have been preferable to living with unending Accutane mind-poisoning. It's essentially the same experience that occurs when you severely overdose on vitamin A. 

The real fun side effects began shortly after my course finished. While taking Accutane_ my hair completely changed it's texture. It became weak_ thin_ lifeless_ dry_ and wire-y. It all began falling out a month after my course ended. It continues to shed to this day. There is no baldness in my family. 

My face then began wrinkling. Fine lines began to appear around my mouth_ on my forehead_ and beneath and around my eyes overnight. It was like the collagen suddenly vanished from my face. My eyes became sunken and my skin became red and hyper-pigmented. Waking up each morning a","Very few things in this world are truly awful enough to be deserving of the description ""life-ruining"".

This drug will not be on the market ten years from now_ as the body of evidence continues to grow that this ""acne medication"" is actually poisonous chemotherapy with irreversible_ gene-altering_ long term side effects.

As Most accutane users can admit however_ the depression and social withdrawal that acne causes can lead a person to consider drastic measures.

The third day I once again took 20 MG in total and my body reacted instantly. Within an hour I had a wicked headache and crazy fatigue. This continued throughout night with insane chills... I couldn't keep warm in my bed. Felt exactly like battling a bad flu. I knew the next morning I was done with accutane. Your body is so smart and only reacts like that if it's got POISON in it. Stop now_ I am so thankful I got bad enough side effects early. Some people on here are saying even a few weeks has caused them lasting grief. I can't even believe other stories I'm reading. If you think clear skin is a good trade for your health you've got to smarten up. I'd much rather enjoy fantastic sex with a face full of zits than have clear skin. Same goes for bowel problems. Most of the people rating this drug as a 4 or 5 have just come off of it. I'm noticing a trend that it is correlated to severe damaging effects that tend to show up later in life.

Pain has gone but some time i feel little bit. DONT TAKE THIS MEDICINE,,M,35,15  days20 mg 1X D,12/14/2014,Accutane
39, 4, Acne,From week one until I finished the treatment: Dry chapped lips. From about 2 months on accutane and until I finished the treatment: Feeling og being tired and exhausted most of the time.  Every now and then: Dry or watery or red eyes_ stiffness: ancles_ hips. Chest pain,It cleared my acne after I had tried everything else. My skin hasn't been as soft as it is now since I was 12. But the side effects are horrible. I just finished my treatment. If the acne is gone forever or at least for 1 year or more it was worth it.,F,24,132  days60 1X D,11/11/2014,Accutane
40, 2, severe facial and body acne,Chapped lips_ dry eyes_ nosebleeds. Unusual itching and peeling of skin (to the point of bleeding)inside of one ear_ which I still dig at out of habit.  I did also expierence neck_ shoulder and backaches which I subsequently saw a chiropractor for_ and did not realize it could be due to side effects_ until I read this rating! My cholesterol skyrocketed during treatment.  I am left with severe depression and anxiety.  Seeing a therapist and phychiatrist for treatment and possible medication to help these effects.  My grades in school have suffered and I no longer participate or have interest in my usual school sports. I feel very sad and seeing my reoccurance of acne hasnt helped matters.  Of course my dermatologist wants me to try this medicine again at a higher dose!  My mother will not allow it.,Acne is back on forehead and will not go away_  I was clear for 3-4 months only.  Dermatologist has put me on an oral antibiotic now. Definitely not worth the side effects.,F,17,5  months40/10 2X D,11/9/2014,Accutane

42, 5, Mild acne,A bit of redness_ dryness_ chapped lips_ bachake_ and peely skin.,This isn't for everyone_ so do your research_ ESPECIALLY if you're a woman. If you take any other meds_ just go look up if it reacts with the other in a negative way. It's cleared me up great_ only took about a month.,F,19,5  months40 1X D,10/29/2014,Accutane
43, 4, Pretty bad acne on face,Back is a bit sore_ sometimes headaches_ lots of poo (maybe it's just me that's been going on before I took this) peeling skin on my face_ chapped lips (the corners of my lips are the worst at the moment) constantly sleepy (but I'm always sleepy being a teen),If you want the results you want_ then you should deal with the pain. Many good things come with a cost. It may not be for everyone. Hell_ I don't even know if I will get the FULL results with me being on 3 more medications. It's been only a few weeks so far_ and it's actually doing well_ therefore I would recommend this.,F,14,1  monthsforgot .-. 1X D,10/27/2014,Accutane
44, 1, Years of cystic acne,Acne was clearing up_ but my joints began to ache after one month. My doctor told me it was common but went away with every patient she treated. It got so bad she took me off. 6 months later and I have severe joint pain in my feet_ knees_ wrists_ elbows_ shooting pain and burning sensations. I have now seen an arthritis specialist who is running a battery of tests. I never had any joint related issues prior to taking it. My cysts are slowly returning and now I'm trying to figure out how to deal with all of this pain I never had. I hold out hope that maybe these horrible side effects will begin to go away_ or at least doctors can help me manage my pain better than they have so far.  I know this medicine has helped people_ but if you begin to experience pain in your joints_ you better think hard about continuing the medication and as my doctor asked me to tough it out_ as I needed 6 months of treatment for it to work_ I wish now I never went for help. I wanted to feel more self confident,,M,50,3  months40 MG 2X D,10/26/2014,Accutane

But a few side effects I have experienced are: dry eyes_ dry lips and lastly the one that's freaking me out is the pain behind my ankle it's super painful and I also have muscle pain in my thigh. Ps.

47, 5, severe acne,dry skin everywhere_ thinning of hair_ extremely chapped lips_ facial flushing.,I absolutely loved taking accutane. It made me feel so much better about myself just 2 months into treatment. i recently got pregnant and my skin broke out terrible and it looks just like it does before accutane. I plan on going on a second course of accutane after i have my baby. this is truly a miracle drug. The side effects are worth it when you have clear skin in the end. The only pain about being on this drug is how expensive it is_ and the fact that you need monthly drug tests. i can't wait to go on this drug again and clear my skin back up.,F,20,5  months40mg daily 1X D,9/3/2014,Accutane
48, 5, Acne on face_ back and chest,Thumb nail split right down the centre from top to bottom. Skin on my arms and legs got thin.,I am 33_ took the drug when I was 18. Although it completely cured my acne and made me a much happier person_ I am now still suffering from side effects. The nail on my thumb still sometimes splits lengthways_ although very rarely and it isn't really an issue_ just looks horrid. But my main problem now is my skin on my arms and particularly my legs is so thin that I just scratch an itch and I draw blood. My legs look absolutely awful_ so I tend to keep them covered. Which I suppose is better than having to cover my face and not being able to wear strappy tops etc.,F,33,4  months 1X D,7/11/2014Email,Accutane
49, 5, Severe Cystic Acne,"Dry lips_ bloody nose_ extreme pain in my rib cage_ severe night sweats (although that wasn't until month 4)_ rectal bleeding_ hemroids_ sweaty palms_ eczema on the tops of my hands and my forearms_ and slightly dry skin.

It was all worth it though. I'd had acne for ten years_ (since age 12) with nothing ever succeeding in clearing it up. With Accutane_ my acne cleared up completely in month 2. Side effects were scary when I didn't know exactly what was happening_ and they were inconvenient_ but Accutane was my only hope and it changed my life for the better.",,F,22,4  months30MG,6/19/2014Email,Accutane
50, 3, back acne,In the first 2-4 weeks not much_ dry skin_ dry lips.  Week 4-8 dry nose_ dry eyes. I recently started getting skin rashes on the top on my hands and realized I've been subconsciously itching myself creating these rashes. Also in the last week I woke up one morning with a puffy lower eye_ it looked like I got punched in the eye. After it didn't look swollen the skin around it was dry & that eye looked like it lostit youth & looked old. I suspect that I was itching & rubbing my eye in my sleep & may have been dehydrated. Now I'm dealing with my eye issue & try hard not to itch my eye or hands & arms. So far on my body I've exp no improvements taking 20mg a day currently inweek 6. I got a prescription for 40 mg a day to  carry me into month 4. So 2 months 20mg+ 2 months 40mg. Everything I've read is that within 6months to 1 year  your body regenerates & gets back to normal so I'm not worries about this stuff. I just have to stop itching myself!,,M,25,2  months20,6/14/2014Email,Accutane

When I was 17 started experiencing unexplained muscle loss_ twitching_ pain_ aching of bones_ sensitivity to light_ heat intolerance... I'm 20 now and am scared I'm dying because of the muscle atrophy. I can't leave the house_ especially when it's warm outside and spend most of the time in bed.
