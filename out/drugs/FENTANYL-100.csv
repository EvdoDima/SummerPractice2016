1, 4, adhesive arachnoiditis_ FBS,constipation_ lack of concentration_ mild irritation at the patch site_ possible short term memory lapses,"I've been on the patch for about 6 months_ and have tolerated it pretty well.  I've been on morphine ER_ methadone_ and oxycontin_ and the fentanyl patch has helped more than the others.  For me_ as with others_ it doesn't last the intended 3 days_ so my doctor has me replacing the patches every 2 days instead_ which works out well.
