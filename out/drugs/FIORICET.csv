0, 2, Tension headache & facial/tmj pain,Occasionally experience respiratory depression when taken before bed; will wake up gasping for air shortly after falling asleep.,This medication has worked really well for me for many years_ to the point where I previously would have rated it at a 5.  Was the only thing to help control my severe pain with minimal side effects.  But the new capsule formulation isn't nearly as effective as the old tablets_ for reasons I don't understand.  The only differences are 25 mg less acetaminophen and now in a gelatin capsule vs the old tablet form_ so it doesn't make any logical sense - but I am consistently feeling as if I have taken a placebo with this new capsule.  It seems to have no effect on me at all.  Maybe the gelatin capsule isn't breaking down as it's supposed to in my stomach?  Am considering asking a compounding pharmacist to prepare it for me in a different type of capsule to see if that makes a difference.  Will update when/if I am able to try this.,F,40,15  years1 tab 2X D,5/6/2016Email,Fioricet

2, 5, Migraine,Euphoria,It takes my migraine away within about 45 minutes. I do not care that it got switched to a capsule. I was prescribed this early last year while pregnant for migraines and have stuck with it since. I am on Topamax for the long-term affects of my migraines but take Fioricet when they get out of control.,F,24,2  weeks1 pill,4/27/2016Email,Fioricet
3, 4, Migraine,Minimal side effects_ to be expected. Much less side effects than Imitrex or Triptans. Family History of Heart Problems. Imitrex caused me to have severe chest pains.,Fioricet takes 50-60% of the pain away. Very grateful. Requires 1-2 per headache_ prevents them from lasting 2-3 days. Also prevents them from progressing to causing nausea.,M,27,1  months50-325-40 1X D,3/16/2016,Fioricet
4, 5, Occipital Neuralgia Headache,Very talkative first couple of years right after pill kicked in_ not anymore. Nausea if taking two pills at once. Rebound headaches if taking more than 4 a day.,Fioricet has been the only headache medicine to work for me_ however_ it was changed from an immediate release tablet to a capsule and now it doesn't work. I finally figured out that I could empty the capsule into my mouth like one of those headache powders_ now it works immediately and I NEVER need a second pill_ eliminating rebound headaches. At least with the capsule_ it is no longer considered a controlled substance-makes me feel less stigmatized somehow.,F,42,15  years 1X AN,1/27/2016Email,Fioricet

7, 3, MIGRAINES/TENSION HEADACHE,SLEEPLESSNESS_ FATIGUE_ MOOD SWINGS,I was originally very happy with the medicine_ as I have suffered from migraines for 13+ years_ and one dose of Fioricet(generic) minimized pain and allowed me to function. However_ the second day of use_ I needed another dose for a rebound headache. I also began to get some sleeplessness. By day 3_ my headaches were cured by taking one dose_ but I am unable to sleep more than a few minutes at a time. I will continue to use Fioricet_ but I fear the  sleep deprivation will cause more problems,F,21,7  days50/325/40 2X AN,5/26/2015,Fioricet
8, 5, Migraines,Sleepiness,Been using this for basic migraines since my son was born 9 years ago since Excederin migraine didn't help very much.  I take it at the first sign of a headache as needed.  It's 325_g acetaminophen/40mg of caffeine & I think 50mg of a barbiturate. Sometimes I have to take a second pill when the first one wears off but it keeps me from getting a severe headache most of the time.  If I wait too long to take it it might not work as good and a 2nd or 3rd pill might be needed later in the day. Usually takes me a month or two to go through a 30 day supply but since it's allergy season and lots of rain been taking it almost every day lately_ it helps a great deal.  I don't travel anywhere without it just in case.,F,41,9  years325/40/50 2X D,5/19/2015Email,Fioricet
9, 5, Tension headaches,The only problem I found with Fioricet is that it makes me rather emotional. I cry for no reason_ and I am not generally a crier. Also_ some loose stools_ but the benefits far outweigh any side effects (for me_ anyway).,I honestly don't see the psychologically addictive aspect of this particular drug_ but I suppose depending on how you're wired_ anything can be a trigger. I don't use the kind with codeine_ so this may make a difference. Thankfully_ this is just a godsend for me. I have used it off and on for a few years.,F,54,2  days50-325,4/22/2015,Fioricet
10, 5, Migraines w/Aura/Tension/Severe DDD,none/ A little sleepiness if on an empty stomach. Nothing major. Able to function and get on with my day. (good thing),"I was given Fioricet after a ER trip by ambulance . Thought I was having a stroke. Vision lose and  30 minutes later a horrible headache came on.Diagnosed with a migraines with aura. Been in the ER every 6 months almost since then due to migraines with auras and was always given fiorecet. This is a great medicine! It works with no side effects.  I now have a general DR. that refuses these. Even when I told him that the 20 pills from the ER every 6 months or so is all I go through! 20 pills in that long amount of time and he still refuses_ says he is not that kind of doctor!! ?? He has prescribed maxalt_ visteril_imitrex-didn't work. He then referred me to a neuro. I went to see the neuro_brought my pills with me and he said .. ""he's not that kind of doctor""!!??  I was in tears.  He has prescribed me Gabapentin _ baclafen.  Topamax _ zanaflex and amitriptaline. Lots of side effects. Recently_he listened to me_ but I think only because 20 pills last me. He was reluctant_ but prescribed them. 20 pills_no refills for 4 mths I'm grateful for even that because these do work. It's a shame pills taken on a daily basis_ all in the name of ""prevention"" is better to them instead of a pill to cure once and as needed. People abuse drugs but we all do not need to be penalized for it. Just because""He is not that kind of doctor"" ..doesn't mean ""I am that kind of patient""!!  Good luck to everyone.  This med is a Godsend for me_ even if in small quantiti",F,43,2  years30 mg 1X AN,11/4/2014Email,Fioricet

12, 5, Migraines,Slightly drowsy which is okay since sleep usually cures the migraine.,When I take one pill at the beginning; starting to feel nauseated_ aura is present and increasing in intensity_ and a headache coming on that is easy to identify once you've had even one migraine in the past...I can lie down in a dark_ quiet room and fall asleep for an hour or so.  When I wake up most of the symptoms are gone - completely.  Luckily I only get this feeling once every month or two but for me the medication works wonders.,M,52,2  years50/325/40 1X D,8/26/2014,Fioricet
13, 2, Chronic Pain Syndrome_Stenosis_etc,,Had to discontinue due to the mood changing side effect. This medication made me extremely moody and cranky_ even mean. It also knocked me silly when I took it_ to the extent that I had to leave the Alcatraz tour on our S.F. trip last year and the captain of the ferry was worried about me because I was out of it. This med can be really bad news. Effective for pain_ but painful stomach side effects from the acidic binders_ and unpleasant mood altering effects.,F,42, 50-325-40 1X D,8/3/2014EmailHistory,Fioricet
14, 4, fybromyalgia pain and migraines,None except a little hyper sometimes. But i have to take two and because its for migraines it doesnt stop the pain in neck and shouders.

Will not go to ER_ treated like a street drug addict because i dont have cancer....,,F,36,10  years?,4/4/2014Email,Fioricet
15, 3, Migraines,1 pill didn't do anything so I had to take 2 for any effect. Some days I had to take 6 pills a day which is the maximum. This medication always made me feel like I had been drinking too much alcohol. After the initial dizzy/drowsiness passed it would make me feel lethargic. Also I consider myself addiction resistant to most of the substances out there_ but this one was one of the medicine I really worried about becoming addicted to. So I had to tell the doctor and got all my medications switched. Also it never really helped really well unless I took many a day which is dangerous. Also since it made me feel loopy I was very careless and did dumb mistakes. Glad I am off of it.,,M,30,6  months2x3 Day,10/17/2013,Fioricet
16, 5, Migraine_ Cervical OA,Groggy and a little spacey.,My doc thinks my migraines stem from severe cervical OA and prescribed 1 to 2 pills 4 times a day.  I average about 1 migraine a week. If I take the Fioricet right when my migraine starts_ it knocks it right out. Sometimes_ if my migraine starts at night and is full blown when it wakes me up_ I'll have to take 2 pills instead of one_ and then an additional pill after 6 hours.  That pretty much takes care of it.  This is a wonderful drug at ending a migraine rather quickly!,F,53,3  years50/325/40 4X D,3/23/2013,Fioricet

18, 5, Migraines,Absolutely none so far. No spacy feelings; just no pain and good energy that's not over the top.,Maxalt_ Relpax do not work for me. I have headaches at least 3-4x week. I had just given up on finding something that works. Recently_ my neruo rx'd this for me. So far I've taken 2 doses. First time_ I had woken up w/ a migraine and decided to give it a try. I layed back down and within an hour: NORMAL.  Second dose taken after feeling one brewing a few days later....within an hour: normal. And with energy that wasn't crazy. As a bonus_ I have MG_ and this drug also helped the fatigue that for me_ comes along w/ it. I recommend giving it a try_ and only use it when you can't function.,F,47,2  weeks50-325-40 1X D,12/15/2012Email,Fioricet
19, 5, For migraine headache,I had a migraine headache starting late on night then the next morning i woke up feeling like the top of my head was going to explode. I had gotten sick and layed back down for three hours. When i woke up it was still killing me. So I'd forgotten that my Dr had prescribed it to me so i went to the medicine cabinet and took two. After about 30 minutes i started feeling like my normal self. Imetrex and Treximent didn't seem to work and then that's when my Dr prescribed Fioricet. What a God send this was. Thank you Dr.,,F,35,6  days3 day,9/27/2012,Fioricet
20, 3, migraines,Thirty minutes after first dose_ I felt just weird. Indescribable kind of feeling in my head. Lasted about half an hour.

21, 3, tension headaches,Grogginess_ slurred speech_ dizzy_ stumbling around_ didn't last real long and the come down is HELL,I was prescribed this for tension headaches.  First evening_ it was amazing.  Second evening_ when I felt another one creeping up_ I took it again.  I ended up passing out on the couch and woke up about 1 AM_ then transferred to bed.  The next morning_ I woke up much earlier than normal_ heart racing and nervous/anxious like I can't remember before.  Third night_ again I felt another H/A creeping up_ so I took it_ but I crashed after it wore off and felt worse than sh*t_ so I took some more.  Finally went to bed about midnight.  Following morning_ I again woke up nervous and earlier than normal_ feeling depressed and morose.  This drug seems to work yet the side-effects_ even prolonged_ are almost intolerable.  I am seriously considering flushing the rest of the bottle down the toilet.,M,29,4  days325mg 2X D,6/29/2012,Fioricet
22, 5, migraines,I was initially reluctant to try this medicine because of all the fuss_ but the tryptan class of migraine medicine nearly killed me with cardiac dysrhythmias_ and caused the inability to move or speak for hours. I have never felt high or anything but better on this medicine and honestly I cannot see what the fuss is all about. I think that one must have to take an awful lot and/or have a predilection for addiction in order to have a problem with it. Additionally_ I have always taken a generic_ and have no problems with it working just fine. I usually take 1-2 at the beginning of a migraine_ and that is all that is needed. I have rarely needed a second dose in 24 hours. I find the caffeine too much of a buzz!,This medicine is in the same class as phenobarbital_ which has a side effect of interfering with Vitamin D absorption. Though not specifically implicated as interfering with Vitamin D_ my level was found to be chronically low for no other reason. If you take this medication_ you should have your Vitamin D level checked regularly_ and talk with your doctor about taking a supplement. Low Vitamin D can cause migraines_ too.,F,41,6  years50/325/40 2X D,3/16/2012Email,Fioricet

24, 4, migraine and tension headaches,short lived euphoria.  if you lay down and want to go to sleep it will knock you out. If you don't want to go to sleep_ and stay up_ it will make you feel a little spacey (and not in a non-functional way) for 30 minutes and then NO side effects,I've taken this drug since the age of 18 for migraine and also tension headaches. It was a LIFESAVER to me in my 20's and would work pretty fast and pretty completely for the tension/migraine headaches i would get.  The only reason i didn't give this pill a 5 is because in the last 4 years since I had my child (hormonal reasons perhaps? ) my headaches have gotten a thousand times worse and  these pills barely take the edge off of the big monster headaches. They still work great for tension or menstrual migraines.,F,34,16  years 2X D,2/6/2012Email,Fioricet
25, 4, headaches/migraines,Rebound headaches.  Stomach problems.  Dependency.,I've had migraines for 30+ years.  I think fioricet helps temper the pain level of my migraines. I stopped a couple times_ once for a over a month and the pain level increased significantly.  I'm probably addicted_ have a emotional dependancy on the drug and developed stomach motility problems as a result of my useage.  But_ as long as I think it reduces the pain level of my migraines_ I have to continue taking it.  It's actually a pretty mild drug with few side effects_ especially compaired to what else is out there.,M,60,17  years 3X D,12/7/2011,Fioricet

27, 3, headaches/migraines_ neck pain,With 2: mild euphoria_ drowsiness (if taken on an empty stomach)With 1: none,I was given this prescription by my doctor for headaches that stem from neck pain_ that more often than not led to migraines.  I take it when my neck is starting to get very sore and it usually helps relieve the pain and ward off the coming headache.  I take 2 at a time (only once in a day) because 1 didn't help at all.  I'd suggest eating before you take them or you might feel a little lightheaded.  These have helped a lot with mild headaches I get just before or after my period_ and as a bonus they work really well on cramps.  Unfortunately they don't do a thing if I already have a migraine.,F,28,6  months 2X AN,9/6/2011Email,Fioricet
28, 5, Migraine Headaches,No bad side effects noted.,Have been taking it for migraines for over 30 years.  I take an average of 8 pills per month that are 50 Butalbital/325 APAP/500 Caffeine.  It takes about 1/2 hour to start working if I take it early when the headache has just started to ramp up. Sometimes my headaches last three days and those times I take no more than 3 pills in one day_ and never for more than 3 days in a row.  I have stuck to these limits for myself_ and I have never gotten a tolerance.  I have learned that if I take it within an hour of the headache starting to get bad_ then it works better.  Also_ I have developed a suspicion that old pills get weak... if the Fioricet pills are more than a few months old_ they don't seem to work as well_ so I never get more than 2 months worth at a time.  When I was taking codeine for pain from broken bones_ I found that I could get relief with just half a Fioricet at a time. Nothing else I ever tried worked this well or this fast. I have tried other things over the years (as urged by various doctors) but nothing else works this well or this fast for me_ and it even makes the nausea go away_ too.  I'll stick with it for life_ fortunately my headaches aren't more frequent... but I think that using Fioricet when I need it has made my headaches less frequent overall.  Bonus is that it's really inexpensive_ too.,F,51,32  years50/500/325 1X AN,4/9/2010,Fioricet
29, 2, headaches/neck pain and tingling,none,Fioricet worked for the first few months I took it but over time_ it's stopped doing much of anything.  Most of the time it just barely takes the edge off the constant neck tingling/headache/shoulder pain.  I've started going to a chiropractor to see if that helps but so far_ that hasn't either.,F,29,3  years,2/2/2010,Fioricet
30, 3, Very frequent headaches,None,I took Fiorinal for 6-7 years.  I felt I had rebound headaches from taking too many and stomach problems from the aspirin.  I switched to Fioricet about a month ago. Instructions say to take one pill.  That does nothing.  Two pills sometime work.,F,61,1  months,1/11/2010,Fioricet
31, 4, Migraines/ Menstrual Cramps,Euphoria_ the urge to buy stuff (especially on the internet)_ drowsiness_ irritability after a few hours.,"This stuff usually works for my migraines_ which can get really bad. The key is to take it early on in the migraine. Sometimes I need 2_ but usually 1 does the trick. This stuff also works well for really bad menstrual cramps. I find that I have a decrease in patience several hours after taking it and can be more easily irritated and snappy. Also I stay away from stores because I have a strong urge to buy stuff that is ""so useful"".",F,30,4  years,1/6/2010,Fioricet
32, 5, migraines/tension headaches,drowsiness_ some nausea (though that could be from the migraines themselves),"I hate to see people say that a ""side effect"" is addiction and give it a bad rating. Fioricet has been a godsend for my agonizing migraines (which things like Maxalt and Imitrex wouldn't touch) and occasional tension headaches. Like most medications_ if you take Fioricet AS PRESCRIBED -- not on a daily basis_ only when needed_ and at only the recommended dosage (no more than 6 in 24 hours for most people) -- you will have absolutely no ""addiction"" problems or even rebound headaches. Don't blame the drug_ take responsibility for your own actions. Fioricet is a wonder drug for many of us who use it responsibily.",F,32,5  years,11/5/2009,Fioricet
33, 3, Headaches,Addiction!! I was prescribed this drug by a Neurologist for tension headaches which led to migraines. Had headaches pretty much everyday. Next thing I know_ I was addicted. When Dr wouldn't prescribe enough_ I began buying them online. Be Careful!!! You think it can never happen to you_ trust me_ it can.,Took the drug as directed for 5 or 6 years. Then sometimes 3 at a time insted of one or 2. Ever so slowly took more & more over the next few years until I could sometimes take up to 20/day (you DO develop a tolerance). If you feel like you are slurring your words or your tongue feels thick; beware! Later (in treatment) found out it was highly addictive even though it isn't a narcotic.,F,41,10  years,4/30/2009Email,Fioricet
34, 5, Migraine,None,This is a blessing since I can not afford Maxalt_ which works well for me.  This gives me a 90% chance of stopping the migraine in its early stages before it starts up.

Its so worth a try given the price.,M,28,2  months,2/25/2009,Fioricet
35, 4, low-pressure migraines,relaxed_ sleepy_ numbness,I was presribed it for a low-pressure migraine caused by a leak in my spinal cord after spinal anesthesia.  I also had to drink lots of Diet Coke for the extra caffeine_ so it cancelled out the sleepyness with caffeine jitters.  It didnt fix the migraine so i had to have a surgicl procedure to fix it_ HOWEVER i kept the remaining pills and have been using them for my severe tension headaches w/muscle spasms - they work wonderfully on that_ i take 1 and then a 2nd about an hour later and the headache is gone and i drift off to sleep.  i do feel a bit drugged the next morning_ but it's nothing a coffee wont fix.

38, 3, headaches,Sleepiness (which is a good thing if you're home and just want to go to sleep because you have a bad headache)_ but then_ about 4 hours after taking it_ I'm wide awake (apparently_ the caffeine kicks in later than the barbiturate),Pretty good at knocking out a headache that Advil or Tylenol won't touch_ but if you take it at night in the hope of killing 2 birds with one stone---knocking out a headache AND falling asleep---you may eventually be woken up by the caffeine in the drug_ if you're sensitive to stimulants_ like I am. If you're easily excited by caffeine_ you may not want to take this. The barbiturate can make you sleepy_ so it may not be something you can take unless you're home_ but if you are home and take it_ while you may fall asleep_ you may find yourself wide awake a few hours later. I've only taken it here and there_ for a few days a month_ generally (usually during my period_ when I notice an increase in headaches most likely due to hormones changes).,F,30, ,1/23/2008,Fioricet
39, 4, Frequent Migraines,"I have been taking Firocet for over 15 years for migraines and when taking the medication I thought I had no side effects because it seemed to  help with my headaches_ but then I noticed that I was taking it everyday_ every four hours because of rebound headaches. I just went to a new neurologist who prescribed me .25mg of Elavil at bedtime and said I should be weaned off of the Fiorcet completely in about two weeks. I went cold turkey off of it about ten years ago and I felt like my head was splitting open for about ten days. I went back on it since I couldn't find anything else that helped with the pain without other side effects. It has only been three days since I have lessened the Fiorcet to about 1 every eight hours and I am pretty much sticking close to home so I can lie down if I feel ""not myself"". I hope to be off of it completely and am really hoping to be able to stay off of it this time and not get the headaches back.",If you get the generic it is fairly inexpensive.

Usually 1-2 doses a day is enough for me.,"I began taking Fioricet a couple of years ago when I began having a headache everyday(rather than sporadically) and also migraines twice a month. I went through the routine of preventive meds like beta-blockers_ migraine meds (Zomig & Amerge)_ Verapamil_ and Darvocet. Although I am concerned about taking Fioricet every day_ it has enabled me to continue working (school librarian) without any serious side-effects. I also take .5mg of Celexa for anxiety and Deconex for sinus congestion daily. I'm not ""cured"" but this regime works for the most part. I also drink 2-3 caffeinated drinks a day and that seems to make stretch the pain relief a bit. Everybody is different and what helps me has not worked for other people I know. It has been long process of trial and error. I have given up more strenous exercise (Karate) for walking and biking. All the yelling and jumping was too much for my head. I hope to get back to it one day_ though.",F,37,2  years,6/9/2007Email,Fioricet
42, 5, severe migraines,no negative side effect.  only 'side effects' would be anything you'd expect with this medication anyways_ such as feeling a big groggy or euphoric at times.  one time I took 2 fioricet (4 hours apart) and was more groggy than I wanted to be_ but it got rid of the migraine_ so I really can't complain,works fast with any migraine.  even after having the migraine for half a day_ a fioricet will still help alot.

My car was rear-ended by another car at a stop sign some years back and the whiplash injury has only added to my headache woes. Fioricet is the only thing which helps if my neck hurts to the point of causing a throbbing headache. Addiction isn't anything I worry about because I only use the med when I need it for the ""big"" stuff_ not the everyday type of headache. However_ if you take Fioricet and tylenol type meds beware of elevated liver enzymes in blood tests.",F,66,14  years,5/6/2007,Fioricet
45, 5, migraines,relaxed_ a bit spacey_ sometimes slightly euphoric.,"migraines run in both sides of my family. I've been getting them since my teens. After struggling for a decade without meds_ a neurologist prescribed Fioricet for me - and they worked. Sometimes they completely stop the headache_ other times it knocks the pain way down to a tolerable level. I only take them when I've got a migraine_ which is generally 3-5 times a month. I've also tried Zomig_ which worked - but the potential side effects of Zomig worried me - so I went back to the ""tried but true"".",F,57,27  years,3/8/2007,Fioricet
46, 4, migraines & neck-related headaches,GroggyRebound headaches_ eventuallyStomach problems_ including gastric refluxEuphoric_ - the narcotic in this really can elevate your mood!  Unfortunately_ it's temporary.,I started on Fiorinal for many years_ and switched to Fiorecet due to stomach problems.  For years I relied on it to deal with occasional migraines and headaches due to a neck injury.  I usually take 1 every 4 - 6 hours.  My headaches last 1 - 3 days_ and have gotten more frequent in the last few years.  I think that this is partly due to rebound headaches.  I haven't felt addicted_ though wouldn't want to be without it_ when a headaches coming on.  Recently_ I went to (yet) another neurologist_ and have had some luck with Elavil.  Also_ tried Zomig_ which works pretty well_ but leaves me feeling horrible.,F,49,20  years,8/25/2006,Fioricet
47, 4, severe migraines (different types),I took 1-2 pills every 4-6 hours...if I took more than 3 in one day I started to feel really wierd and uncomfortable_ almost anxious.  Caused really bad rebound headaches after a month of taking it once or twice a week.  Stopped taking it abruptly after a couple of months and had a bad withdrawal with rapid heartbeat and panic_ and passed out.,It really worked great_ took the pain away...but I do NOT recommend taking it on a regular basis.  Very addictive.,F,28,4  months,6/3/2006,Fioricet
