1, 1, Status Migrainosus,None,I tried taking this medication to help reduce the pain from having severe_ ongoing migraines and it did absolutely nothing to help me.  A placebo may have yielded a better effect.,F,33,3  days 1X AN,12/18/2010,"Butalbital, aspirin and caffeine"
2, 5, Migraine,None,This has been a lifesaver for me.  If taken at the early signs of a migraine it usually stops it.  If taken later it dulls the pain enough to let me sleep off the migraine.  As I only have 1 or 2 migraines per month I've never had to worry about its addictive properties.,M,53,25  years,1/27/2009,"Butalbital, aspirin and caffeine"
