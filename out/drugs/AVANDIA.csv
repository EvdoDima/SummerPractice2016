1, 1, Told had Type 2 Diabetes,My then 85 year old mother was told (out of the blue)she had Type II Diabetes by a PA after a high glucose reading; no one in our families have had diabetes.  No discussion- no A1C info provided or tested.  She took it for over a year and my siblings and I believe that was the start of her dementia symptoms.  She was told in August of 2010 by a specialists that indeed_ she did NOT have diabetes.  She was put on this serious RX when she did not need it.  She experienced headaches_ anxiety_ confusion.  She seems much better now OFF of Avandia.,This is a scary drug and doctors need to be sure to check to see if some of the old standby diabetes meds won't work just as well with fewer side effects.  They also need to truly verify with proper tests that patients DO actually have diabetes before being so fast with the scripts.,F,85,  1X D,10/4/2010,Avandia

6, 1, DM2,I started to experience chest pains a few years after taking this drug. (avandamet) I would describe the chest pain as heaviness and aching that would leave me with a feeling of anxiety.

I was monitored and had an ECG done along with other blood tests_ but they all came back normal.

I had terrible side effects  (shoulder_ elbow and left hip P-A-I-N #@%!). Since Crestor was not part of my insurance formulary he had to take me off and put me on Zocor. My pains melted away as if by magic. But I am not done with this so called doctor_ yet - for I am reporting him to my Insurance Company (Humana TriCare).

43, 2, Type II diabetes,I was diagnosed with type II diabetes in January 2004 and started treatment with Avandamet in March 04.  I am an avid bicyclist and continued cycling as a routine form of exercise.  In November of 2006 I started running in hopes of building up to a marathon by the summer of 2007.  Between February 2007 and May 2007 I completed three half marathons.  In late June 2007 my ankles and lower legs started swelling. I tried to run and was only able to make it about 300 yards before running out of breath.  Additionally_ my systolic pressure jumped approx 35 points.   A routine nuclear stress test demonstrated an  abnormal EKG and some artery blockage. My regulary doctor  took me off Avandament and prescribed Janumet.  Withing a week the swelling went away.  Due to the abnormal stress test_ EKG and shortness of breath the cardiologist did a cardio cath.  The cardio cath verified the blockage 30% to 40% in the lower portion of the Anterior decending artery and no other blockage or prob,I believe the avandia did a good job keeping my glucose in check.  However_ I believe the swelling was caused by the avandia.  I spoke to a doctor at the intake before the cardio cath and was advised a drug can be tollerated for years but_ then cause an allergenic reaction.

I'm not sure if it is the medicine that cause it but I got off Avandia at my request because of all the bad publicity it receive recently. Believe it or not my doctor put me on Actos. He knew I had heart failure_ so I'm even more confused of what he was thinking since this medicine warning states if you have heart failure you should not be taking it. I'm changing doctors. I was unaware of the issue of heart failure until I heard it on television last month. I recommend that anyone that is put on this medicine be closely monitor. If they notice any signs of water retention_ shortage of breath or being extremly tired_ I would talk to their doctor immdiately about changing to another medicine.,M,58,2  years,7/6/2007,Avandia

Unfortunately_ this web site does not list Avandaryl as one of its drugs to rate.My mother finally said that I looked odd_ that the fat didn't look like fat from overeating.  and I do NOT overeat!!I have this distended stomach and now my hips are widening!","It is ironic that if ""one"" is diabetic_ weight loss is the most important thing one can do.Yet here we have a pill for disbetes that causes one to gain even more weight.One might think that the drug manufacturer wanted ""cusotmers"" to gain weight so they would need to keep taking the drug.But_ surely_ drug companies care about our best interests_ right?  They would never hurt us so they could make a profit_ would they??!!",F,60,7  years,6/22/2007,Avandia
49, 1, diabetes 2,unsatiable hunger/always felt hungry; no energy; fatigued_ sluggishness_ always tired; absolutely exhausted for no reason at all; swelling; bloated feeling; breathing got much worse - was very very short of breath; even going up one set of stairs caused heavy shortness of breath; I went to a different doctor for breathing problems which weren't that bad before Avandia; very blurry eyes at times; tired eyes a lot of times - my eyes felt like I'd been up 24 hrs or so yet I was getting enough sleep; ongoing very blurry vision; legs were SO HEAVY and TIRED constantly - from nothing; felt insecure on my feet - like I might trip and fall and I didn't know why 'til I stopped taking Avandia. Depressed for no reason at all; this was ongoing; down in the dumps feeling a majority of the time.  Peripheral neuropathy seems to be worse - only had it slightly in one toe previously; some muscle pain for no reason;,"I just went to my endochronologist.  I had stopped taking Avandia 1 wk before the warnings came out because of how bad I was feeling and the excessive weight gain. I had managed to lose some weight prior to Avandia. He still thinks Avandia is great since ""it hasn't been proven yet"".  I don't want to keep taking it 'til I have a heart attack or other health problems.  Avandia has too many side effects.  Who knows if they'll be the next victim of Avandia?  Why take the risk?  There has to be better medications!  Had a family friend who died from Vioxx caused heart attack.  She died shortly after Dr. gave her Vioxx.  I don't think Avandia should still be on the market.  How many more need to die to prove a point to the FDA and Drs who insist on continuing prescribing Avandia.",F,68,3  years,6/19/2007,Avandia

51, 2, Diabetes,Been taking Avandia for 6 mths now.  I have experienced a significant weight gain and I am already considered obese.  My feet are swollen and hurting even though I take Gabapentin (Nuronten).  I have decreased energy and feel too tired to even walk.  I have suffered migrane-type headaches in the morning. After taking this drug for two months_ I was diagnosed with high blood pressure.  A month ago_ I had a bad respiratory infection and when I went to the hospital_ I had an irregular heartbeat.  This drug is very scary and I did not put two and two together until I read this website due to the increased media attention.  I am requesting a medication next week on my next doctor's appt.  By being overweight_ I already have enough problems.,,F,38,6  months,6/11/2007,Avandia
52, 3, Diabetes Type II,I felt Avandia helped overcome resistance to insulin allowing me to use less Humolog than would otherwise be the case. Recently however I've noticed that my use of Humolog is up_ so apparently the drug is not working as well as it did for the first few years. For the first year and a half to two years I didn't notice any side affects_ then_ about a year and a half ago I started experiencing swelling in my feet that has gradually gotten worse and now my legs are also quite swollen. Over the past year I've put on almost 50 pounds and couldn't understand what had changed to make this happen. For the past six months I have also started experiencing upper respiratory problems. I was very very surprised when I found this web site and read the reports from all those people that have experienced the same side affects. My doctor just told me to stop taking the drug to see how I do without it.,I never suspected this drug was possibly a problem_ I took it for almost two years with no noticeable problems - then all of a sudden my problems started and I had no clue why_ now I think it was this drug. I look forward to seeing how I do off this drug_ which I only stopped taking one day ago.,M,61,4  years,6/9/2007,Avandia

54, 3, Diabetes,None that I know of.,Added when the metformin I had previously taken wasn't enough.  Took a while but with a later addition of glyburide my glucose levels have come down significantly.  Not sure how much of that is the Avandia though.,,, ,6/5/2007,Avandia
55, 2, Type II Diabetes,First_ almost an 80-pound weight gain.  That was followed by anemia_ and then edema in lower legs.  I have no energy_ am tired all the time and what used to be daily activities are now beyond my ability to do.  Just getting out of my chair seems to be a major job_ and that was not my normal lifestyle 3 years ago when I started taking this medicine.,My doctor has not taken me off Avandia yet; as a matter of fact_ he hasn't even mentioned the excessive weight gain_ the tiredness or the edema.  So yes_ I am looking for a new family doctor!  I don't believe that the advantages of taking Avandia even begin to outweigh the disadvantages.,M,61, ,6/2/2007,Avandia

58, 2, Type II Diabetes,Last year went for a physical and had to have a ekg  very erratic heartbeat.  Dr didn't remove me from avandia but I decided to cut the dosage in half.  Heart beat seemed to have improved. Recently started the Neil Bernard regimen of  reversing diabetes the natural way.. essentially this is a vegan diet with low fat -the real culprit. Dramatic lowering of blood sugar from AM high 200s and low 300s to middle 100s in am before meds and excercise--after meds and excercise (swimming) a mile) sugar goes down to below 100.  very pleased-- will now stop all avandia in light of the news today. !!!,I have had suspicions about avandia and its lack of safety since I started using the drug.  I'm convinced this is a dangerous drug_ and that diet alone with glyberide will accomplish the same thing without side effects.  diet and excercise is all important for type II. Dr. knows only one  game and thats to give a pill.  Take care of yourself and be your own best Dr. The makers of this drug should be prosecuted and the feds repriAmanded. Obviously this is one more proof that the Food and Drug Adminsitration operates at the pleasure of the drug companies and not in the interest of protecting the public.  I hope there is a class action suit. I dont like my life being played with at all and this isn't going to go away.,M,66,5  years,5/22/2007,Avandia
