1, 1, Told had Type 2 Diabetes,My then 85 year old mother was told (out of the blue)she had Type II Diabetes by a PA after a high glucose reading; no one in our families have had diabetes.  No discussion- no A1C info provided or tested.  She took it for over a year and my siblings and I believe that was the start of her dementia symptoms.  She was told in August of 2010 by a specialists that indeed_ she did NOT have diabetes.  She was put on this serious RX when she did not need it.  She experienced headaches_ anxiety_ confusion.  She seems much better now OFF of Avandia.,This is a scary drug and doctors need to be sure to check to see if some of the old standby diabetes meds won't work just as well with fewer side effects.  They also need to truly verify with proper tests that patients DO actually have diabetes before being so fast with the scripts.,F,85,  1X D,10/4/2010,Avandia

6, 1, DM2,I started to experience chest pains a few years after taking this drug. (avandamet) I would describe the chest pain as heaviness and aching that would leave me with a feeling of anxiety.

The pain would not be relieved by rest and would come at any time and last for hours sometimes.,I was having chest pains so severe one day that I checked myself into the ER. I was monitored and had an ECG done along with other blood tests_ but they all came back normal. I have been complaining of these pains for years to friends_ family and my doctors and all of them accused me of lying or exaggerating! I am so happy to hear I am not crazy!

I had terrible side effects  (shoulder_ elbow and left hip P-A-I-N #@%!). Since Crestor was not part of my insurance formulary he had to take me off and put me on Zocor. My pains melted away as if by magic. But I am not done with this so called doctor_ yet - for I am reporting him to my Insurance Company (Humana TriCare).

I suspect that is all from the Avandia also.  I tried other meds and none have worked for me like the Avandia_ so my doctor keeps me on it.

43, 2, Type II diabetes,I was diagnosed with type II diabetes in January 2004 and started treatment with Avandamet in March 04.  I am an avid bicyclist and continued cycling as a routine form of exercise.  In November of 2006 I started running in hopes of building up to a marathon by the summer of 2007.  Between February 2007 and May 2007 I completed three half marathons.  In late June 2007 my ankles and lower legs started swelling. I tried to run and was only able to make it about 300 yards before running out of breath.  Additionally_ my systolic pressure jumped approx 35 points.   A routine nuclear stress test demonstrated an  abnormal EKG and some artery blockage. My regulary doctor  took me off Avandament and prescribed Janumet.  Withing a week the swelling went away.  Due to the abnormal stress test_ EKG and shortness of breath the cardiologist did a cardio cath.  The cardio cath verified the blockage 30% to 40% in the lower portion of the Anterior decending artery and no other blockage or prob,I believe the avandia did a good job keeping my glucose in check.  However_ I believe the swelling was caused by the avandia.  I spoke to a doctor at the intake before the cardio cath and was advised a drug can be tollerated for years but_ then cause an allergenic reaction.

I'm not sure if it is the medicine that cause it but I got off Avandia at my request because of all the bad publicity it receive recently. Believe it or not my doctor put me on Actos. He knew I had heart failure_ so I'm even more confused of what he was thinking since this medicine warning states if you have heart failure you should not be taking it. I'm changing doctors. I was unaware of the issue of heart failure until I heard it on television last month. I recommend that anyone that is put on this medicine be closely monitor. If they notice any signs of water retention_ shortage of breath or being extremly tired_ I would talk to their doctor immdiately about changing to another medicine.,M,58,2  years,7/6/2007,Avandia

My feet are swollen and hurting even though I take Gabapentin (Nuronten).  I have decreased energy and feel too tired to even walk.  I have suffered migrane-type headaches in the morning. After taking this drug for two months_ I was diagnosed with high blood pressure.  A month ago_ I had a bad respiratory infection and when I went to the hospital_ I had an irregular heartbeat.

Recently however I've noticed that my use of Humolog is up_ so apparently the drug is not working as well as it did for the first few years. For the first year and a half to two years I didn't notice any side affects_ then_ about a year and a half ago I started experiencing swelling in my feet that has gradually gotten worse and now my legs are also quite swollen. Over the past year I've put on almost 50 pounds and couldn't understand what had changed to make this happen. For the past six months I have also started experiencing upper respiratory problems. I was very very surprised when I found this web site and read the reports from all those people that have experienced the same side affects. My doctor just told me to stop taking the drug to see how I do without it.,I never suspected this drug was possibly a problem_ I took it for almost two years with no noticeable problems - then all of a sudden my problems started and I had no clue why_ now I think it was this drug.

I'm convinced this is a dangerous drug_ and that diet alone with glyberide will accomplish the same thing without side effects.  diet and excercise is all important for type II. Dr. knows only one  game and thats to give a pill.  Take care of yourself and be your own best Dr. The makers of this drug should be prosecuted and the feds repriAmanded.
