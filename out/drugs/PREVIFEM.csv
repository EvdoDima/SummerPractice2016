0, 3, Birth control/ ovarian cysts,It makes me vomit A LOT if I take it at the same time of day as any of my other medications. However_ since I rearranged my medication schedule and moved all of my other meds to the evening_ it's been okay. However_ the first day back on the normal pill after the period week of inert pills I always feel sick. I don't always throw up_ but I feel nauseous all day.,My epilepsy medication was making my old birth control metabolize too quickly_ which invalidated its actions against my ovarian cyst development. I was switched to this one so that they would stop coming back_ and it actually did the trick. As much as I hate being nauseous and throwing up_ I'd take that any day over more ruptured cysts.,F,19,4  months.25 MG 1X D,11/29/2015,Previfem
1, 4, Birth control_ acne,Slight nausea during the first half of the 1st week_ small increase in hair growth_ tender breasts,Before I was on Tri-Previfem_ (the kind with different mg amounts per week) for 6 months and I had breakthrough spotting for the entire time and it had also eliminated my libido/sex drive to absolute nothing. That is why I switched to Previfem full doseage for every week_ and it has so far resolved these issues,F,21,4  weeks.25 mg 1X D,8/7/2012Email,Previfem
2, 1, Birth control_ period regulation,I've had nausea on and off all day_ everyday since about the second day I started taking this. Was on Sprintec for a few years and never had a problem. This medication is suppose to be the same as Sprintec just under a different name. I don't know if I'm allergic to the buffer or what but I'm in misery. I will be stopping this tomorrow. I cannot take another day of this. It's not worth waiting to see if the nausea will subside.,,F,23,6  days,6/2/2012,Previfem
