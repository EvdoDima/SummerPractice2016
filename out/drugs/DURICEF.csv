0, 5, Cystitis_ tooth infection,Amazing! I had to ask my GP for it since it's a new ATB and everything else makes me sick. I've been through z-pak_ Levaqin_ Cipro etc. all of which had horrible side effects but not Duricef. No anxiety or crying spells either.,It took a while to kill the bacteria but I actually felt better the first night after taking 1 gram. I went from feeling very sick to getting my appetite back in one day.,F,38,7  days1 gram 1X D,12/27/2014,Duricef
