0, 4, HBP,slight ringing or clicking in ears_ fatigue_ occasional heavy heartbeat at night_ occasional headache,Taking twice a day by cutting pill in half. Seemed to need it at night as on waking felt bp high again. Tried other hbp meds past 5-6 years and stopped due to uncomfortable feelings_ swelling ankles. Tried to control hbp with diet and good regime_ deep breathing but eventually not working. Finally sought new med & tried this. Keeping bp lowered and except for fatigue mostly feel good and ankles not as swollen. Hope new exercise program will eliminate need. Dr. now wants to put me on Boniva for osteoporosis but reading side effects gives a real scare so will stay with exercise.,F,72,6  weeks20-12.5 mg 2X D,11/6/2012Email,Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide
