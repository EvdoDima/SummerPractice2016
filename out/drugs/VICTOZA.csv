2, 3, Type 2 diabetes and weight loss,The only side effect I've had is waking up with really bad acid reflux. And the thing is I already take two medications for this. Omeprazole and ranitidine. But they're not even helping with this.,I have not experienced any weight lost yet... but then again. I have been on a .6 milligram for 2 weeks and I just started my 1.2 dose yesterday.

Doctor put me on stool softeners but nothing worked. Then I developed heart palpitations that were severe. Doctors DC'D the insulin. But_ I'm still experiencing heart palpitations. Hoping my heart beat returns back to normal. I read that this can happen and that death can happen as a result. I'm off of this  drug.,By far_ too dangerous.,F,58,3  weeksO.6,6/14/2016,Victoza

10, 2, Diabetes 2,Only side effects were extreme nausea if I did not eat soon enough. Lost 50 pounds and was not eating like a diabetic should. I decided to quit taking because I am tired most of the time_ cannot sleep and seems to be aggravating my depression. I also have rheumatoid arthritis and am worried that the drug is increasing the general malaise you feel with RA. This drug is not a good companion to the illnesses that I have struggled with for a long time,I was worried about pancreatic or thyroid cancer from the beginning but my doctor said the chances were Slim as opposed to my hi A1C scores. I knew that I should be following a strict diet_ but once I was on it I lost weight so fast that I kept taking it. Now after two years_ I have decided the risk is not worth it. I have never been the type to be nauseated in my entire life and can get extremely violent Leon nauseated now so this is a very strong drug. Who knows what else it could be doing to my body. I am going to follow a more nutritious diet and see what happens.,F,64,2  years1.2,4/21/2016,Victoza
11, 2, PCOS_ insulin resistance_ weight lo,Nausea_vomiting_diarrhoea,I got prescribed victoza to assist with suppressing my appetite (which is the biggest issue for me) and lowering my glucose levels (borderline high). What can I say I was amazed at how little I ate and how I did not crave any sweets or had any itches to snack. It was almost as though I got sleeve surgery done. However and unfortunately it was a horrible 72 hours and I have thrown in the towel already. Wave of sickness from morning to night. Woke up vomiting and had 4 sessions of diarrhoea. It was nothing short of just plain ugly. The fear of the unknown with how much longer I had to put up with it got the better of me and I have decided to give it up. It actually gave me more motivation to work on my portion control by myself so I don't have to put up with it. I now eat reduced sized meals and have overall lowered my carbohydrate intake. I'm 2 weeks into doing this now. I respect those who need it who have diabetes etc and all the best to them. This was just not for me I couldn't bare mentally or maintain these symptoms with my lifestyle. So I have started a tough journey to self discipline with food and increasing my exercise.,F,28,3  days0.6,4/10/2016Email,Victoza

15, 4, Type 2 diabetes,"I learned very quickly_ I had to adjust to the med. First_ take it at night. Secondly_ you will have varying degrees of gastrointestinal discomfort. Mine largely passed_ as I moved from .6 to 1.2 MG_ BUT you have to consume significant amounts of water (very light green and white tea helps_ because of the warmth)_ and while it helps with over eating_ you have to do your part too_ by listening to your body tell you that you need less_ and DIFFERENT food. High fiber and pro-biotic nutrients (live culture yogurt_ kefir_ etc.)_ solid ... warm breakfast_ good protein and healthy fats for lunch_ and lite dinners. Not only does this help reduce the discomfort_ also with the weight loss I feel ""up"" so long as I don't eat heavy foods. But the real life saver was cannabis (legal in Oregon). Pretty much stopped the nausea in its tracks_ in very small amounts before bed. My insulin use (Lantus and Humalog) have been reduced by more than half so far_ and I am seeing fasting sugars of 79-1",,M,65,5  months1.2 MG 1X D,3/10/2016,Victoza
16, 1, My type 2 diabetes not controlled,pancreatitis_ severe back and stomach pain_ shoulder pain_ and my blood sugar has been above 250 since I stopped taking it. The severe back and stomach pain is still with me after three weeks of stopping this medication. My whole body seems to be aching as well. This medication has created a horrific experience for me. I cannot stress enough that this product seems to have long lasting adverse affects.,The doctors at the emergency room that I want to don't seem to be well-informed about the adverse affects that a person can get from taking Victoza. There was a consensus that after stopping this medication that I would no longer be in any kind of pain_ this could be further from the truth. There needs to be a comprehensive study of The long-term effects after taking this medication. I feel that even though I read the possible side affects pamphlet that accompanied it_ the wording was not strong enough; the prescribing physician also did not adequately explain the possible ramifications of using this medication. Perhaps_ and I'm guessing here_ that the pharmaceutical representative was giving them too many perks; like say vacations maybe? I really don't know_ but this drug needs to be re-evaluated for sure.,M,56,5  days,2/14/2016Email,Victoza

It was a horrible panic cold sick feeling.  Took a few days to recover.  I'm not sure what happened exactly but it was terrible. It felt like I was going to die all day and til 3am.  The NP had started me on 1.8 instead of 0.6mg as the directions recommend. We restarted at 0.6mg a few days and gradually increase yo 1.8 mg.  It helps the cravings a lot.
