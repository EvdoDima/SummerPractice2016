2, 3, Type 2 diabetes and weight loss,The only side effect I've had is waking up with really bad acid reflux. And the thing is I already take two medications for this. Omeprazole and ranitidine. But they're not even helping with this.,I have not experienced any weight lost yet... but then again. I have been on a .6 milligram for 2 weeks and I just started my 1.2 dose yesterday.

Doctor put me on stool softeners but nothing worked. Then I developed heart palpitations that were severe. Doctors DC'D the insulin. But_ I'm still experiencing heart palpitations. Hoping my heart beat returns back to normal. I read that this can happen and that death can happen as a result. I'm off of this  drug.,By far_ too dangerous.,F,58,3  weeksO.6,6/14/2016,Victoza

10, 2, Diabetes 2,Only side effects were extreme nausea if I did not eat soon enough. Lost 50 pounds and was not eating like a diabetic should. I decided to quit taking because I am tired most of the time_ cannot sleep and seems to be aggravating my depression. I also have rheumatoid arthritis and am worried that the drug is increasing the general malaise you feel with RA. This drug is not a good companion to the illnesses that I have struggled with for a long time,I was worried about pancreatic or thyroid cancer from the beginning but my doctor said the chances were Slim as opposed to my hi A1C scores. I knew that I should be following a strict diet_ but once I was on it I lost weight so fast that I kept taking it. Now after two years_ I have decided the risk is not worth it. I have never been the type to be nauseated in my entire life and can get extremely violent Leon nauseated now so this is a very strong drug. Who knows what else it could be doing to my body. I am going to follow a more nutritious diet and see what happens.,F,64,2  years1.2,4/21/2016,Victoza
11, 2, PCOS_ insulin resistance_ weight lo,Nausea_vomiting_diarrhoea,I got prescribed victoza to assist with suppressing my appetite (which is the biggest issue for me) and lowering my glucose levels (borderline high). What can I say I was amazed at how little I ate and how I did not crave any sweets or had any itches to snack. It was almost as though I got sleeve surgery done. However and unfortunately it was a horrible 72 hours and I have thrown in the towel already. Wave of sickness from morning to night. Woke up vomiting and had 4 sessions of diarrhoea. It was nothing short of just plain ugly. The fear of the unknown with how much longer I had to put up with it got the better of me and I have decided to give it up. It actually gave me more motivation to work on my portion control by myself so I don't have to put up with it. I now eat reduced sized meals and have overall lowered my carbohydrate intake. I'm 2 weeks into doing this now. I respect those who need it who have diabetes etc and all the best to them. This was just not for me I couldn't bare mentally or maintain these symptoms with my lifestyle. So I have started a tough journey to self discipline with food and increasing my exercise.,F,28,3  days0.6,4/10/2016Email,Victoza

15, 4, Type 2 diabetes,"I learned very quickly_ I had to adjust to the med. First_ take it at night. Secondly_ you will have varying degrees of gastrointestinal discomfort. Mine largely passed_ as I moved from .6 to 1.2 MG_ BUT you have to consume significant amounts of water (very light green and white tea helps_ because of the warmth)_ and while it helps with over eating_ you have to do your part too_ by listening to your body tell you that you need less_ and DIFFERENT food. High fiber and pro-biotic nutrients (live culture yogurt_ kefir_ etc.)_ solid ... warm breakfast_ good protein and healthy fats for lunch_ and lite dinners. Not only does this help reduce the discomfort_ also with the weight loss I feel ""up"" so long as I don't eat heavy foods. But the real life saver was cannabis (legal in Oregon). Pretty much stopped the nausea in its tracks_ in very small amounts before bed. My insulin use (Lantus and Humalog) have been reduced by more than half so far_ and I am seeing fasting sugars of 79-1",,M,65,5  months1.2 MG 1X D,3/10/2016,Victoza
16, 1, My type 2 diabetes not controlled,pancreatitis_ severe back and stomach pain_ shoulder pain_ and my blood sugar has been above 250 since I stopped taking it. The severe back and stomach pain is still with me after three weeks of stopping this medication. My whole body seems to be aching as well. This medication has created a horrific experience for me. I cannot stress enough that this product seems to have long lasting adverse affects.,The doctors at the emergency room that I want to don't seem to be well-informed about the adverse affects that a person can get from taking Victoza. There was a consensus that after stopping this medication that I would no longer be in any kind of pain_ this could be further from the truth. There needs to be a comprehensive study of The long-term effects after taking this medication. I feel that even though I read the possible side affects pamphlet that accompanied it_ the wording was not strong enough; the prescribing physician also did not adequately explain the possible ramifications of using this medication. Perhaps_ and I'm guessing here_ that the pharmaceutical representative was giving them too many perks; like say vacations maybe? I really don't know_ but this drug needs to be re-evaluated for sure.,M,56,5  days,2/14/2016Email,Victoza

The NP had started me on 1.8 instead of 0.6mg as the directions recommend. We restarted at 0.6mg a few days and gradually increase yo 1.8 mg.  It helps the cravings a lot.

Well I've lost 44lbs and I yes that's a wonderful thing but the horrible side effects that got me there is almost not worth it. Nausea_ vomiting_ no appetite_ and now I think extreme dizziness. Even had to go to er. Gotta talk to my endocrinologist asap BC I am getting to the point of almost passing out. I thought it may have been a different medication but it seems to be the victoza.,Victoza has multiple side effects which affect some people more than others.

Duh!! My diet has been the same except I began adding more Protein so what I eat was never a issue.I began Invokana which I love to help with A1c.That came down 7.4 from a 9.2 within 3 months. First week on Invokana I lost 6lbs but thats it! My weight went up. So Im 280 lbs now. All Im worried about is the fat.I started Victoza this past Thursday. I took it before I went to bed. About 20min later I became extremely sleepy and gasy. Friday I took it in morning_ same sleepiness/gasiness. Saturday upped my dose to 1.2 as per Dr.Only thing I have is the sleepiness thats it!

77, 5, 15 years diabetic type II,The first two weeks of this drug are hard. Start at 0.6 for a week and then go up 1 click a week (no more) to avoid severe symptoms of nausea. Forget about eating. Side effects are much less if a person is active and eats less.,This is a very effective and very strong diabetic medicine which is over-prescribed and causes most of the bad side effects because of too high a dose. I was very cautious in adding it_ and through raising 1 click a week and checking bs 3 times a day and logging it found that 1.0mg 1x day brought my blood sugar under complete control with 2000mg of metformin which I intend to continue to take for insulin resistance. It allowed me to completely drop the 6mg of Glimeperide and while bringing my a1c from 7.8 to 6.2 after 15 years of being diabetic. I lost 23 lbs_ and changed my eating habits to conform with the Victoza and have kept it off. Those who claim they have put it back on do not realize the appetite loss goes away and you have to monitor your food intake closely as well as exercise. This is not a miracle drug which will work for you if you lay on the couch and eat. That will create the side effects.,M,64,4  months1.0mg 1X D,12/2/2014Email,Victoza

The little I did eat came back up in full force. Initially when I was first diagnosed with  diabetes type 2 I was taking Glipizide. In 2010 I was put on      insulin_ both Levemir and Humalog. There was no problem except I got tired of sticking myself with needles and wanted to return to oral medication. That when I was prescribed Victoza and 750 mg of Metformin. I have to take 0.6 for aweek_ 1.2 the 2nd week and 1.8 the 3rd week and thereafter.  I vomited a lot (and I mean a lot) but concludedthat maybe it was because of the levothyroxine and avorstatin medication.  When I stopped taking it_ the vomiting stopped and I felt better. With all the negative hypeabout the side effects_ I worry and don't really know if I will continue taking Victoza and Metformin.

87, 5, Lower blood sugar,When you first start there is some nausea.  I did vomit a few times_ but I guess that probably depends on your tolerance for nausea.   That is the only bad effects I have.,This drug has been wonderful.  I started taking it because even on Metformin my A1c was 9.2_ fastings in the high 200s.  It was horrible_ bad foot neuropathy etc.  There is some nausea when you first start taking this and I had it fairly bad for the first month probably_ but there are things I learned to decrease it.  Smaller meals and I take the shot later in the day like a few hours after lunch.  The worst nausea occurred when I took it right after a meal...Don't do that!!!  It slows stomach emptying and if you take it right after your meal just sits there and causes issues.  I am over 350 pounds and in 3 months I've lost 35 pounds effortlessly. My A1c went from 9.2 to 6.5 in the first three months. I have been huge my whole life.  I have always felt like I was missing something that tells me when to stop eating....Victoza does that for me.  Now I will have a meal and eating along as normal and something will just tell me its enough and I stop with no problem.  I very rarely finish my plate now.  I have a stop button now and I stay full longer.  I no longer eat anything after dinner...no interest in it at all.  I also do not crave carbs like I use to.  Yes the side effects can be bad at first_ but I can say with all honesty that now 4 months out and I do not have any side effects_ but maybe rarely.  If you are big and your sugars are out of wack the side effects are worth it.  Just get through the first 2-4 weeks and be smart_ don't stuff yourself especially at dinner.

Since then just random bouts of nausea when I go too long without eating. At the end of my second week_ I started getting extremely bad diarrhea . It would happen shortly after eating. And usually 2-3 times after a meal. That equals 10 or so bouts a day.,So far I'm very happy. It's not an easy drug to get started on. But I stuck with it through the first week and it has been very tolerable the second week. My blood sugars have dropped significantly. Back in to the 90-110 range 2 hours after eating. I am on 2_000 mg of metformin and 5mg of glipizide twice a day. But I suspect that as I continue to lose weight and eat better_ those will be able to be eliminated.

And I'm feel full all day long!!!! It took a week to get my energy back. I realized right away that if I'm eating a small amount of food it is more important to eat nutrient-dense food and my energy has rebounded. My only hurdle now is to figure out how to stop diarrhea. I am going to start with greek yogurt in the mornings and some probiotics as people have suggested here. It is tough to get started but I believe I'm past the worst of the bad symptoms and it's been very tolerable this last week.,M,46,2  weeks1.2 1X D,8/23/2013,Victoza

Yes I lost weight and my A1C was lower but I had to undergo $100_000 worth of testing after I took this drug. It completely messed up my body and is so not worth it. Being in the hospital because of a drug is not ok. The people who have only been on it for 5-10 days and are commenting should not be able to. Yes_ I too was fine for the first two weeks. Just wait you will feel like death soon and your body will not be able to function.  It is a very harmful drug that should not be allowed on the market.

My first episode began on the third day of taking the Victoza_ and I had approx. 1 episode a week until I stopped taking it.,My first episode required a visit to the ER and another visit  the paramedics were called.

128, 1, Type II Deabetes,Debilitating nausea_ vomiting_ extreme fatigue. I had a Lap Band_ and thought that my symptoms were from that_ so eventually I had the Lap Band removed. In the recovery phase from removing the Lap Band_ the symptoms intensified greatly. Food made me very nauseated_ and I could hardly make it through a day at work.  Then I ran out of the needles for injecting Victoza_ and the next day I was much better.  Got needles_ took Victoza and the following day I was back to feeling rotten.  So I stayed off the Victoza over the weekend_ again felt much better.  Saw MD_ switched to another antidiabetic medication and have had no further symptoms!,Victoza_ along with Metformin and diet_ exercise_ did help keep my HbA1c lower_ and I was blaming the nausea and often vomiting on the lap band.  I did lose some weight while taking the Victoza_ but at the cost of being completely miserable most of the time.  I wonder if I would have needed to have the lap band removed had I discovered this adverse effect of the Victoza sooner?  I guess I will never know.  I would like to emphasize that for me_ the nausea and fatigue were not just annoying_ they were life altering.  The side effects were often debilitating_ and once I stopped taking the Victoza_ the relief was amazing.  I realize that the company might say that it was the Lap Band causing the side effects_ and that is what I thought_ and why I had it removed.  But the symptoms continued unabated_ in fact worsened as I was recovering from the surgery_ and did not abate until I stopped taking the Victoza.,F,63,2  years 1X D,6/16/2012,Victoza

At my first 3 month check up with my MD after the switch to Victoza_ my A1C had risen to 7.7. I asked to stop the med since my quality of life was suffering (ex: constant N/D> immediately having to run to the bathroom after eating a meal). He asked me to continue taking Victoza for another 3 months to see if things improved.  The side effects seemed to improve somewhat; but I would still get occasional nausea and diarrhea_ plus also these occasional sharp shooting pains and discomfort in my upper abdominal region. In addition_ my weight increased by several pound.  At my next 3 month check up_ my A1C had risen even higher to 8.5.  At that time_ I asked my MD if we could stop it and and restart the Janumet.

I never dialed up to 1.2 as I didn't want to get sick again after the first week.  I gradually dialed an extra click past .6 over a 3 week period to avoid some of the problems.  I did -- I stop with only 5 clicks past .6 --- bacically it's 1/2 between .6 and 1.2 or .9.  This is where I've been.  A1C is now 6.4.  Lost 10 lbs. the first week_ gained back 8. Probably from not eating from being sick. With summer being here I will be more active -- hopefully I'll be able to lose more weight -- this will help to low my A1C.
