0, 5, For frequent migraines,No side effects,Cafergot relieves my migraine within 30 minutes_ sometimes takes a little longer if I don't take at the outset.   A positive side effect is that on two occasions when I have had a sore neck and a sore hip (muscle and nerves affected) cafergot has eased these pains.  No doctor can explain the reason why this happens but it is certainly no co-incidence. Would love to know why this occurs.,F,61,20  years 1X D,9/5/2012,Cafergot
1, 1, migraine,"One of the problems with this drug is the caffeine it contains.  Caffeine is well known for creating ""headache rebound:""  The migraines/headaches are aborted_ simply to come back a few days later and then_ much more frequently.  The more I took of Cafergot_ the more migraine attacks I suffered.  But what I also didn't know was that Ergot_ the other part of the compound_ is what's used to induce labor contractions in women.  I began to develop blinding convulsions of uterine pain.  It was so bad that the blood supply to my lower body would be constricted_ and I'd be stuck on the toilet_ rocking in agony_ icy from the waist down.  I can only describe the pain as feeling like I was giving birth to all of hell.  Even after I gave up Cafergot_ the contractions continued.  I had to abandon work_ school_ relationships with people_ my entire life.  No gynecologist could help me.  My world plunged.  Years passed_ about 16 in all_ until my estrogen levels dropped_ and the contractions",If you've got migraine_ don't use Cafergot!,F,57,2  years,10/27/2009,Cafergot
2, 5, migraine,,Cafergot gets rid of my occasional migraine headaches (less than once a month) within 20 minutes.  It also lifts me out of depression and stops severe body/muscle aches within 20 - 30 minutes.  It takes me from a non-functioning_ painful state to a fully functioning_ pain free state.,F,56,10  years,12/30/2008,Cafergot
3, 5, cluster headaches,stomach upset - mild to annoying_ certainly not enough to offset the effects of the med.,Cafergot has been a godsend - I'm in the middle of a cluster_ so I take a pill before bed - and I DON'T WAKE UP WITH A HEADACHE in the middle of the night.  AMAZING!!!!!!,M,54,7  days,8/21/2008,Cafergot
4, 5, migraine,"""hair"" hurts (hypersensitivity to touch); mild nervous twitching","A godsend is right! Migraine throughout my life. Can remember headaches back to 8yo_ caused by diesel exhaust. Drinking coffee/cola seemed to help. Taking Anacin helped too. (All contain caffeine.) Started taking Cafergot in 1980. Actual first time relief of the migraine cycle (aura/stars_ set-in_ nausea_ throw-up_ feel better). Over the years_ less frequent headaches and require only one pill to knock them out now IF timing is right--shortly after aura/stars_ right before/during initial set-in of headache.  Tried a couple other ""newer"" meds_ but none worked as well as Cafergot for me.",F,51,28  years,2/28/2008,Cafergot

6, 4, Migraine,Nausea if I took one on an empty stomach.Also I would find it difficult to get to sleep if I took one in the evening (the caffeine I expect),The tabs don't work so well if the migraine has started BUT if I take 1 or 2 glasses of water with the cafergot this helps. I assume that as the pill increases the blood pressure - the extra liquid helps this.,F,52,25  years,7/18/2007,Cafergot
7, 5, migraine,no side effects,Cafergot has been a god send for me_ if taken right when I frist feel a migraine coming on_ it really does work for me.,F,21,2  years,5/11/2007,Cafergot
8, 2, Migraine Headaches,Felt like someone beat me over the backside with a bat.,When I took Cafergot back in my mid to late 20s (a few to several times)_ it usually relieved my headache within 2 to 3 hours_ but I had to lay down on my chest.  When I awoke_ it felt like I was beat with a bat or something.  However_ after trying it again in my early 30s_ it had no effect on my migraines.,F,34,5  times,4/20/2007Email,Cafergot
9, 5, migraine headaches,no noticeable side effects,I wish I would have known about cafergot years ago.  I get certain warning signals before a migraine hits - blurred vision in right eye_ numbness in right hand and right side of face.  If I take cafergot as instructed_ immediately at the onset of these symptoms_ then in about 10 minutes my preliminary symptoms go away and the headache never hits_ saving me hours of pain and discomfort.  For my migraines_ cafergot is like a miracle cure all.  Note though_ that if I don't take the cafergot until well after the headache sets in its effect is minimal.  The key is to take it as soon as the warning symptoms begin to appear.,M,28,1.5  years,10/13/2006,Cafergot
