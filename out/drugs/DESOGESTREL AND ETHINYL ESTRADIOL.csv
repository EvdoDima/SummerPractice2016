0, 4, Birth control and ovarian cysts,Headaches_ spotting_ weight gain,This medication works for me better than any other that I have tried in this category. The weight gain is to be expected considering this is a birth control pill. 5 lbs did not make that big of a difference to me.,F,26,13  years 1X D,7/13/2015,Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol
1, 3, Perimenopause_ birth control,BTB & cramps starting during second week of pills through day 21; On and off fatigue; Some anxiety_ tension_ mood swings.,This seems like it should be a great pill.  Good ratio for my age_ but for some reason the pills work differently day to day. I feel good 1 day & not the next.,F,47,1  years,12/15/2006,Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol
