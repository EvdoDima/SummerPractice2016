0, 5, pain from uterine artery embolizati,took away my appetite - went days without even thinking of food or eating. Drowsiness. A little spacey. Constipation.,I had a lot of pain after the uae procedure but don't like to take drugs so I put off taking the oxycet that had been prescribed and tried to control the pain with 800mg ibuprofen. That totally failed and after 2 days of pretty bad pain I broke down and took the oxycet. It got rid of the pain completely and allowed me to be human while I recovered. Instead of being doubled over and whimpering I was able to read a book or sleep. I was very grateful for this medication and felt silly for not taking it from the beginning as the doctor recommended.,F,53,10  days,3/3/2006,Oxycet
