0, 3, parkinson's,,"I started at .25 mg 3x/day and increased to 1.25mg 3x/day to control tremor. CAUTION: when discontinuing mirapex due to compulsive eating and decreased tremor control_ I was told that I could just swap out Sinamet for the Mirapex. I had major withdrawal symptoms; depression_ anxiety_ frightened_ nausea_ diarrhea_ tachycardia_ uncontrollable crying_ seeing flashes of ""things"" in my peripheral vision that weren't there_ sweat pouring off me...it was horrible. Called the neurologist towards the beginning of symptoms and was told that my body just needed to adjust. He called back the next day_ profusely apologizing_ and had me go back on a 1/2 dose of Mirapex in conjunction with the Sinamet. 2 weeks later I am off successfully off the Mirapex.",F,53,3  years1.25 mg 1X D,7/4/2016EmailHistory,Mirapex

8, 1, RLS,Compulsion_ heightened sexuality_ affected normal judgment.,I have been away from Mirapex now for 5 years and want to offer perspectives from a distance. As you can read from the many comments below_ this drug affects people very differently. It was very bad medication for me_ even at low dose. It didn't perceptively help my restless legs. What I didn't like is that the drug taker doesn't realize the side effects. For me the side effects were impairment of judgment_ non-gambling compulsiveness_ and heightened sexuality. As to judgment_ something about which I am normally praised_ I describe the effect as juvenile - not caring about the results of actions. As to compulsiveness_ my focus was a house remodel project_ for which I was totally absorbed and spent way too much. As to sexuality_ I just had a heightened sense of sex and got way too close to a fellow worker. That almost ruined my 35 year marriage_ but my wife_ a psychotherapist_ knew something wasn't right and checked on Mirapex. It takes a long time to get Mirapex fully out of your body_ for me at least 6 months. Mirapex could have been a disaster for me if I kept taking it and if I increased the dosage. My wife also found a potential connection between Mirapex and a family history of manic-depression_ which my father had. My advice: if you take this medication_ be very aware of your individual results and be very open with your caretaker about what is happening; the side effects can be very subtle.,M,68,1.5  years.5 MG 1X D,1/2/2016,Mirapex

47, 1, Restless Leg Syndrome,Highly addictive!!! Would sometimes bring on the RLS; but mostly just didn't really do much after the first couple of years.,Mirapex worked great for the first year. Then it slowly lost its effectiveness. My doctor tried increasing the dosage and changing the frequency and times of day I was taking it. We tried drug holidays which worked for the first couple of times then stopped. We added other drugs and I even tried many_ many non medical treatments. But the real problem is that it just really didn't work any more and when I tried to stop using it_ my RLS became unbearable.  I used to believe this drug was a miracle.

52, 1, rls,I writing in for my father. About 18 months ago he started gambling... stealing everything he could find to gamble_ distancing himself from family and suicdal thoughts. After given an ultimatum he decide to check himself into a hospital to help him with severe depression. The hospital looked at his meds and advised us that a mirapex is under a law suit for not advertising these side effects!! Being off the meds for 2 days it seemed as if a fog lifted and my family had their old dad back. Now 2 weeks later we are in the hospital with what appears to be seizures... what's next??

53, 1, RLS,My husband takes Mirapex for RLS. Excessive Gambling_ Cocaine use_ compulsive behavior_ memory loss_ Poor sleep habits,My husband started taking Mirapex for RLS and at first it was a miracle drug for him.  He could finally have a restful night's sleep.  I strongly believe this drug is changing him in a bad way and destroying our marriage.  He always enjoyed gambling_ but now he spends so much money its scary.  He started using cocaine over the past few years while we'd be away on vacation then started using it at home over the past year.  He only admitted to the cocaine use after me questioning it for a year and finding evidence of use and threatening to leave our marriage.  He says he isn't doing it anymore.  I strongly believe this drug is changing him into someone else.  He goes from one compulsive thing to the next.  Gambling_ drug use_ smoking too much_ drinking too much_ distancing himself from family_ lying.  Help! I want him to go to the DR to get a full physical and to see if this drug has anything to do with the compulsive strange behavior.  He doesn't even have to go to the Dr for regular physicals each year to check this med and what it's doing to him.  The Dr just continues to prescribe it when prescriptions run out without any medical evaluation.  I'm positive its the Mirapex that's changing him.  He started on .25mg and just recently had taken 4mg to find relief and then had an episode of such a terrible headache he was in bed for 24 hours.,F,40,10  years1mg + 1X D,1/12/2012Email,Mirapex

Worked wonderfull at first.  Than the effects started to wear off.  So they increased the dose by .05 mg.  Over the course of time I was eventually up to 5 mg per day which is above and beyond the reccomended dosage.  The Narcolepsy was really bad and I was still twitching at night.

I guess one question I have is what problems are side effects of the drug or just the body getting older_ like muscle weakness.  However_ lately I have felt like I wake up in a fog even after getting 8-10 hours sleep.  This weekend I took my motorcycle out of the garage and after a short ride returned as my balance and general control was off.  I also felt mentally impaired_ just not sharp.

Day after the second dose I had racing thoughts and rambling conversations and txt messages_ couldn't recall names or phone numbers_ was easily distracted. Following the third dose_ the usual pain in feet was intensified. Cramping & trobbing in my feet AND legs hit me so hard that is was intolerable.

92, 2, Parkinson's,I am writing for my husband_ who was taking Mirapex for Parkinson's and RLS. He soon began having blood pressure drops_ causing him to fall into a deep sleep to the point of my having to call 911 to revive him and take him to the hospital.  After several days_ they released him_ with no explanation as to what was happening.  His cardiologist could not regulate the highs and lows of his blood pressure_ since he was experiencing both to the extreme_ so one medication was counter-acting the other.  He was beginning to fall asleep in his food every time he ate.  His Parkinson's doctor put him on Mirapex ER once a day_ hoping that would better regulate the meds_ as he wasn't good at taking it properly.  Until then_ he was still able to be out doing some things around the farm.  When his BP dropped one morning to 49/32_ I phoned and told his doctor that the Mirapex seemed to be dropping it too low and he immediately took him of all Mirapex.  For the next 2 weeks_ he was falling into a deep s,When I checked the warnings on the Prescription print-outs_ there it was. Not the BP part_ but the falling asleep part. I can't believe that not only the doctors_ but myself as his caregiver_ had missed that for so long.  It could have killed him.  He is doing well now_ except for the RLS_ which came back with a vengeance.  He is on Neurontin for that_ but it isn't controlling it during the night.I would only recommend this drug if ALL the warnings were conveyed to the patient by the doctor and that the doctor was monitoring all of them faithfully.  I cannot believe that our PCP_ our Cardiologist and our Neurologist all knew what was going on with him and that he was taking Mirapex_ but not one of them connected the two or the gravity of his situation.,M,85,5  years25 3X D,9/4/2010,Mirapex

Now I am taking .50mg_ but finding I have a headache every day and feel more fatigued. I am going back to the 1.5 pills. I have found I must take it about 5:30 pm everyday. The more I eat_ the less the pill works. This should be a good way to diet and I must really do that. I do have vivid dreams_ but I always did have dreams_ even with color.

I was barely able to function. My symptoms started about noon and continued throughout the day and night.

124, 1, Brief User--Beware,,"Mirapex is a dopamine agonist. Dopamine is the neurochemical in your brain that _ when hyperaroused_ can cause OCD in people_ exacerbate OCD in others (like myself)_ and cause rapid mood swings due to its short half-life. Dopamine is not a chemical of pleasure per se. It is actually a chemical in our brains that is used to reinforce positive experiences by hitting a high (as during orgasm) and then dropping to a low (after sex). By the up and down sudden rise and fall in dopamine_ a person becomes ""addicted"" to the experience. That is why an orgasm is so addictive. Same with cigarettes and caffeine.I was fortunate in that Zoloft was making me dull after two years on it for depression. I took Requip in tiny amounts and it got me hooked on a new hobby (dopamine rise and fall)--World War II. I took Seroquel at night_ which dampens dopamine a bit_ and thus was able to adjust dose to finally allow my hobby to become part of my life without triggering OCD. Higher amounts of Requip brought back OCD--which comes from too much active dopamine.  So_ dopamine ""rise and falls"" are how we get hooked on things. ",F,45,1  days,11/11/2009,Mirapex

130, 2, Fibro pain_ RLS_ mild muscle twitch,I started taking 0.25mg Mirapex(Pramipexole)Aug.21/09 (16 days ago).  Prescribed dosage 3x per day.  After two doses had tolerable level nausea.  I did notice while on this meds. morning stiffness was definetely decreased that I was able to get up out of bed and get going after 20 mins. when it usually takes me 1 hr. After 7 days_ I started to suspect strange reactions to Mirapex (e.g. increased pain from Fibromyalgia_ headaches_ waking up about 4x at night and then going back to sleep). Decided to keep taking meds 3x per day and tracked side-effects after each dose.  I found that 4 hours after I take each dose my Fibro pain would increase to a Level 6 pain out of 10 Levels (pain pretty intense I would sometimes have to add 10mg Baclofen--muscle relaxant); the pain would stay intense for 2 hours then go away without any muscle relaxant.  I believe this phenomina of increase pain/decrease pain is called on-off syndrome.  I have never experienced this on-off side-effect from any other me,I noticed that Mirapex DID stop the muscle twitches that I had  in my theighs and arms occuring approx. 8-10x per day. I have decided that I have given Mirapex a fair two-week trial period and really struggled with the side-effects hoping they would go away_ however Mirapex has not worked for me.  I found this website 11 days after I started taking Mirapex and kept in mind other people's comments.  I was looking out for did I have this or that side-effects as another person.

DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO!!!  My wife had moderate RLS and the doctor gave her a prescription of .50 mg.  She has been taking it for 9 months every day once a day and she lost 35 lbs that she didnt have to lose-- she was already very thin.  Her personality changed to being angry and down-- no patience with me or kids_ etc.  I watched helplessly as the woman I love and adore changed into somone I did not know.  She started smoking flavored cigars and I have alergies to smoke_ and cant stand the tast smell_ etc.  She would not even consider giving them up.  I left.  With some good advice from a friend I came back and asked some pre-thought-out questions to try and get to the bottom of it.  MIRAPEX!  This all started when she started taking mirapex for her legs?  I was baffled.  This drug nearly cost me my family_ my wife and has cost me in other ways as well.  She is coming off of it now and experiencing bad side effects (dreams_ seeing things_ pain_ etc).

I've gained about 14 pounds in about 5 months of using the drug. My face and wrists are very swollen as well. Not sure what to do but I know I'm waaaaay too young for these side effects. I've been having suicidal thoughts a lot lately as well. I know I would never act on these_ but it's very disturbing.,Starting taking 6 months ago for rls. It was a life saver helping instantly once I was able to overcome the nausea. It works very well_ however_the side effects are now affecting my quality of life and I'm finding I have to take the drug now early in the evening for it to take effect by the time I go to bed. This causes me to be very tired in the evening and has caused a lot of problems for me and my husband concerning intamacy. Like I said_ I'm waaaay too young to have these issues.

I went off Mirapex for a year because I could not afford it and lost all the excess weight. Went back on it 2 months ago and have gained 15+ pounds. I didn't realize the Mirapex was the cause of my prior severe weight gain. The doctor never discussed it as a cause. After going back on and the sudden weight gain I did my own research and have since discovered this problem. I have a Dr appointment next week. I am discontinuing.

Was wondering why my life was unraveling (I am a professional in the fire service and stable person) and getting worse the past 6 months (increased the dose to .375 6 months ago).  Wife does not understand what is going on_ even though I have asked her to read this site.  Marriage may be on the rocks and not savable after 33 years_ even if I get off because of my uncontrolled sex drive towards her and way I have treated her. This is NOT WHO I AM!

He became a sexual monster.,The longer my husband was on Mirapex the worse the symtons became. He became very sexual aggressive and I feared for my life as he started raping me several times during the night. I could tell that he did not know what he was doing as his eyes were blank. It also made him confused and forgetfull. He could not remember what he did to me. After the medication stopped he was like a new person. When he took the medication he would have freezing spells and had many falls. He no longer shakes and walks much better no more freezing spells and he is much happier and alert.

However_ like most RLS / PLMD medications_ over time they tend to lose their strength_ and it seems as if the RLS / PLMD symptoms find a way around the medication.  I have currently been taking Mirapex for 6 months.  Although it still does provide me with the benefit of lessening my symptoms and the rate of occurrence_ my RLS and PLMD has found a way to fight through the medication.  I have gone from no symtoms of RLS at the beginning of taking Mirapex to about 4 episodes per week now while still on Mirapex.

I experienced severe hypersexuality_ Manic depressive behavior_ OCD_ gambling_ overeating_ sex phone calls_ paranoia .... My life is turned upside down.  Things got so bad I considered committing suicide.  I drank and smoked pot to try and feel better_ but it only made things worse.  If you are young and taking this drug for Parkinsons ( I took 8mg a day.) STOP NOW.  It almost cost me my life_ my wife_ my family and my job.,,M,50,8  years,9/13/2008,Mirapex
185, 2, RLS,Insomnia_ running thoughts_ brain fog,This medication was very effective for the RLS but at the price of insomnia.  Expiriencing 1-2 hours of sleep a night_ running thoughts all night_ morning fog and difficulty concentrating.  I was hopeful the side effects would lessen once I was used to the medicine but it only got worse.,M,42,10  days,9/11/2008,Mirapex
186, 2, RLS,Very dizzy all day long.  Just need to turn my head.  Weight gain 20+ lbs in 3 months.  Forgetfullness.  Depression. Muscle aches.,I thought that the dizziness was my only side effect and it drove me crazy all day long.  Everytime I turned my head I could feel my eyeballs bouncing back and forth.  My husband didn't want me to drive anymore which was an issue with me.But I had also been gaining weight very quickly but thought it was from a depression medication I was taking. But I still continued to gain after stoping that drug as well. I have also been very forgetful to the point that I felt like I was losing my mind.  Had some very embarrasing situations where I couldn't hide my memory loss. I have been having muscle aches as well and Im not sure if its from the drug or not but have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning or when sitting for a while.  I feel so much older than I am.   I have chosen to stop the Mirapex to see if I lose the side effects.  It didn't help all that much anyway so the side effects arn't worth it to me.,F,42,3  months,9/9/2008,Mirapex
187, 5, RLS,I have had no side effects from this medication.,Mirapex has been a life saver.

191, 5, Restless Legs Syndrome,None that I can directly attribute to Mirapex,"It is sad to read all the negative reactions_ because Mirapex has been nothing short of a miracle for me.  I have very severe RLS_ (everyday_ many times during the day/night_ causing sleeplessness every night_ most of the night).  I take .125 mg (the minimum dosage)_ at about 8 p.m.  and it continues to be effective_ taking about 2 hours to ""kick in.""  When I am going somewhere requiring me to sit (concert_ movie_ etc.)_ I take it about an hour before the event so that I know I will be able to sit through most of it.",F,60,5  years,8/23/2008,Mirapex

193, 4, Parkinson's_Dystonia_RLS,Mirapex works well for my symptoms -tremors_dystonia_stiffness_etc.  My main complaint is the weight gain of 35lbs in 2 years. If I sit down_ I am ready to fall asleep_ but at night_ I am wide awake. I generally sleep from 3am to 7am. I tend to be foggy_ but it may be sleep deprevation. I make sure to take it with food. I don't eat much during the day_ but binge after midnight. I also am compulsive about computer-games/research and shopping at Thrift stores. I have managed to fill up most of my horizontal surfaces with vintage pottery. It works well for me_ but I may have to switch drugs due to the weight gain.,Works great for me.,F,56,3  years,8/15/2008,Mirapex
194, 1, Restless legs,Hives_ itching_ poor sleep_ but the worst thing was the deep depression with paralyzing sadness and a feeling that my heart was breaking.,I am so glad I figured out that it was the Mirapex causing my depression.  I was almost ready to go back on Effexor when I decided to just stop the Mirapex instead.  I felt better in one day and_ after two day off of it_ I feel fantastic.  I still have the RLS_ although it has gotten better as I get my ferritin level up.  In the case of Mirapex for RLS_ the medicine is worse than the disease.  At least with RLS_ once I get to sleep_ I sleep well.  With Mirapex_ you wake feeling like you haven't really slept_ which might be what causes the depression.  Lack of sleep shrinks the amygdala_ the part of the brain that processes emotion_ and small amygdalas are linked with depression.,F,51,5  weeks,8/9/2008,Mirapex
195, 3, RLS,Have been taking Mirapex for approx. 2 years.  I thought I was crazy until I read these comments and I see so many similarities.   I have severe muscle pain and weakness_ the sensation of something brushing against my arms and legs_ tapping my teeth_ constantly moving my toes_neck pain_ inability to sleep_ nausea_ increased interest in shopping although not excessive.,It has definitely helped the RLS but I am going to find an alternative treatment.,F,60,2  years,7/31/2008,Mirapex

It is time for Boehrilnger Ingleheim to do the right thing  by these people whose lives have been devastated.

I take a low dose of Zoloft for pre-menstrual dysphoria and this drug seemed to work against the beneficial anti-anxiety properties of the Zoloft.  All in all I'd rather have itchy legs - will try homeopathic remedies_ up the iron intake.  This drug just made me feel too weird!,F,48,15  days,7/14/2008,Mirapex
199, 3, RLS,Has radically altered my sleep patterns. Before taking Mirapex my lifelong sleep pattern was difficulty falling asleep (often 2-3 hours)_ but then sleeping through the night afterwards. On Mirapex_ I can fall asleep very quickly at night (as well as during church_ in meetings_ watching TV or in Movie Theatre)_ but generally wake up at 3-4am and can't go back to sleep. Have also had a lot of sticky phlegm in throat that stated about the same time as starting mirapex_ that contributes to snoring and waking frequently at times. Have also seemed to have struggled more with some compulsive behaviors (primarily eating) that may be related.,Mostly controls RLS symptoms.,M,45,18  months,7/10/2008,Mirapex
200, 3, RLS,Nausea_ sleeplessness,I'm taking .125 (I think) as needed.  It does knock down the twitching_ although not completely.  The nausea the next day ruins it for me though.

The bad taste in my mouth also occurs.  I really don't like any of these side effects_ but the bad taste in my mouth bothers me mosts.,"I have been experiencing lots of forgetfullness to the point that I could no longer cover it up.  It was affecting having coffee with friends_ remember lunch dates_ appoints_ etc.  It became clear that I could be experiencing sleep deprevation.  As a result my doctor and I explored the idea that I had RLS.  I couldn't watch late night TV I would begin to move my legs as they felt like I was experiencing ""growing pains"" as I did when young.  Turns out that I had not been experiencing REM sleep.  I have not dreamed in years.  I was up multiple times during the night thinking that I must have heard a noise that woke me but it was angst in my legs that nearly kept me awake all night.  Not wonder I could not function during the day_ or rather remember most of what I should.  I was sleep deprived.  Now I sleep more that 4 hours at a time and I actual have dreams.

Unaware of what she was doing my mother became an Obsessive Compulsive Gambler.She has lost over $500_000 in the last year.It wasn't until the money was gone and she was off her medication did she relize what she had done.By then it was too late.Now my mother owes the IRS a lot of money and they don't want to here about what Myrapex did or did not do.She has lost her home and probably most of her children.What make this even harder is that my dad died for the money that she gambled away.,I have not heard of this medicine causing this side effect until my mothers Rhumetologist told her what it was doing to her. He noticed the changes in her from the moment she started taking it and he discontinued the medicine.The OCD brought on by this drug does not appear to effect people with Parkinsons Disease as it does those whom take it for RLS.

It looks like requip has more or so the same side effects.  I've had RLS for 9 yrs_ I was pregnant went first diagnosed and it was very severe.  Are all my symptoms related to the drug?  I thought I had breast cancer - in fact - I'm still wondering if there is something else causing the pains.  Anyone have any thoughts? Experiences to share?,,F,38,3  weeks,12/11/2007Email,Mirapex

I have to be very careful with this.,Some augmentation but it mostly works well for me.

Trials of Mirapex as well as Requip both led to Ansomnia for me... so it could be me. However_ Requip did not lead to Headaches and after seeing numerious other comments mentioning headaches - as well as a life history (of 33 years for me) basically headache free: I think it's fair to say that Mirapex is the source of my headache at this moment. It's 5:52AM_ I've been up all night with a headache from Mirapex.,M,33,5  days,12/2/2007,Mirapex

I have had a real hard time not spending money_ up to $300_000 right now_ addition to pornography and overweight.

238, 2, Primary RLS,"Have been on Mirapex for 5 weeks_ having stopped Gabapentin to try the Mirapex. At first_ it worked well - even better than the Gabapentin - no breakthrough symptoms.  Sleep disturbances did not improve_ however - have great difficulty falling and staying asleep in spite of either medication... even though my legs are more relaxed. Recently_ symptoms much worse!  Terrible muscle cramps and spasms_ nausea_ pounding heart_ headaches_ tiredness and fatigue_ and in the last two weeks_ I have developed extreme stiffness in all my joints and muscles.  I don't seem to be able to ""walk it off""_ either.  I have also been having a lot of mid-back pain which has been increasing over the past three weeks.  My side effects are now bad enough that I must consider stopping the medication.  What started out as a ""miracle"" is now a ""nightmare"".","So far_ I have tried three different meds for my RLS_ and the net negative impact was the ""least"" with gabapentin - even though I did not experience complete relief.  I have severe to moderate primary RLS which I have had since I was too young to even remember.  It started out as only an feeling of ""ants and crawliness in the legs"".. now I get throbbing pain as well as extreme jitteriness/ ants in the legs.  Worse... it is no longer confined to my legs_ or even my arms and legs.  The worse experience I have is when it actually affects my entire body - perhaps the progressive nature of the  disorder.  I am glad that there are finally treatments and a name for this disorder... for years_ doctors and friends thought I was ""really weird""!

I have had to see a Cardiologist and they did CT of heart_ EKG_ Stress  Test_ Holter Monitor and now wish to perform a cardiac catheterization because they cannot figure out what causes my heart rate to go from 88 to 133...Last night.. I purposely did not take Mirpex and then the twitching got so bad that I had to find it... and take it..(I split the pill in half) and BAMB!!!  I could feel my heart pounding and the weird buzzing sensation in my chest.  I am going to pay dearly tonight.. going cold turkey.. but I do NOT take any other pills or prescriptions.  Mirapex...

The only medication that could have caused this was the Mirapex_ which seems very possible as my Requip for the RLS did the exact same thing_ minus the fatique and trouble staying awake.I think with both RLS medications_ they work without incident for 4-6 weeks then they must be building up in some negative way in some people's systems and once they get to that tolerance point_ the vomiting and such happens.,F,53,5  weeks,8/21/2007Email,Mirapex

Also I was able to get up in the mornings and felt like I had rested the night before for the first time since 1998. I didn't realize that the adverse changes I was seeing in my body were due to the drug until I saw this internet site.

Other side effects I had were nausea_ sleeplessness_ extreme muscle twitching_ and itching (no rash).,I just put the crying spells together with the fact they started since Mirapex_ so I have decided to start tapering off to get off this stuff!!

I went off the Mirapex for 2 weeks to participate in a research program and went 4 days straight without a wink of sleep... a horrible experience. I was ready to take drastic measures because of the sleep deprivation_ but when I finally crashed_ I was able to function again. I could have stayed off Mirapex_ but as soon as the research was over_ I got right back on it. I saw no need to suffer with this disorder when the relief is there.

280, 4, Resistant bipolar disorder,Weight gain (around 20 pounds)_ forgetfulness_ apathy,I don't know how to rate this drug... It was miraculous in that it solved my agitation and anxiety like a dream. It started working in a matter of days. Honestly the apathy and forgetfulness was a small price to pay for this relief which I have never had before. Sadly I put on alot of weight on it and that was not from binge or compulsive eating. It was sudden weight gain and didn't seem to level off after a point. I was on it for 8 months at 2mgs and I was very unhappy to give it up. I restarted it later at a lower dose of 0.5mg and again it worked well but the weight started climbing up again. Apparently this is a very rare reaction and almost the opposite to what the drug usually does. I am very unhappy that I cant take this medication because I haven't found anything like this before. I also suffer from very severe tremors and this drug really helped with that too.I'm hoping to find a way to curb the weight gain and hope to be back on it soon.I would love to hear from any,F,33,8  months,2/15/2007Email,Mirapex
281, 3, RLS,After a few weeks_ I couldn't focus at work...felt like I had ADD...always surfing the net_ often shopping_ and then I found ebay and bought thousands of dollars of stuff I don't need and never wanted before.  The link with COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR is real_ not for everyone but for some.  That was the only side effect I had_ and the first doctor I went to told me it wasn't related to the drug.  I finally did some internet research_ heard about the link to gambling_ shopping_ sex_ etc._ and got another doctor who had heard about this.  Brain chemistry is a tricky thing to mess with_ so if your behavior starts changing_ it may be the drugs you're taking.  I can take it on vacation as long as there's no computer around me_ for work or for shopping!,In terms of the RLS_ it was like a miracle for me.  I could sleep straight through the night_ no wake-ups_ on just .5 mg at night_ for two years until the really crazy shopping behavior started.  (Minor shopping binges and the ADD had been going on for longer but it wasn't as extreme and I didn't realize it was from the drug.)  I could even nap during the day with no RLS symptoms.  I tried Requip and it made me nauseous and gave me daytime RLS symptoms_ which I never had before.  I tried Sinemet and it just doesn't get me through the night -- I'd wake up 1-3 times with that creepy-crawly feeling and need to take more.  Now I'm trying Klonapin_ which so far helps with the RLS_ but it makes me feel kinda stoned and unmotivated and a bit headachy.  Ugh!,F,46,2  years,2/13/2007,Mirapex

289, 5, to hope it would stop aching legs,Only brief nausea the first week of starting on mirapex.,I have been taking mirapex for over 10 years.  For me it was a life saver.  With a very ill husband and maybe three hours sleep a night I was living in a sleepless daze. I was reading everything on line and in magazines when I ran across an article about mirapex helping rls.  My arthritis dr. had received information from Mayo Clinic and prescribed it for me and it has helped me from day one. I never take it during the day and drive because of falling asleep side effects. So far it has helped me during the day until late in the afternoon and may have to increase to four .125mg pills instead of three .125mg in the evening two hours before bedtime.

This lasted about 10-12 days until my physician ordered me to return to the mirapex three times a day (.0125 mg.)  Like magic!  The violent convulsions stopped immediately.  This stuff is scarey but it works so well for PLMDs that I am willing to take it anyway.  WARNING: do not decrease dosage without doctor's involvement.Other side effects_ I suspect a shopping compulsion (few months duration_ twice) plus I wonder about my slow and steady weight gain without increase in caloric intake.  Never mind_ I'll deal with it just so that I can sleep and live a normal working life.,It works!  It works!  I can sleep! I can go through the day without snapping my head violently or twitching my torso so hard that I lose my balance.  I can sit in church for a full hour and not look like a crazy person.

300, 5, RLS,After four years of taking the medication_ I have just ow began to experience Nausea with a very high dose.  Other than that_ I can not say that I have experienced any other side effects that I know of. One piece of advice_ never_ ever take Benadryl or Phenergan without taking Mirapex if you have RLS.  Both of these medications can increase RLS s/s to the most severe degree...,This medication has changed my life.  I began having very severe RLS s/s when I was in college.  could not date_ go to movies_ or anything that was associated with night time activities.  I worked as a night shift nurse for a few years to try to stem off the terrible feelings by moving around all night long.  My doctor finally prescribed Sinemet and it worked for about 6 months and then augmented the symptoms of RLS to my arms as well as my legs.  I was worse than ever.  I tried Requip and had a very weird reaction to it called a dystonic reaction....Then they tried me on Mirapex.  Now I can not live without it.  I can sleep and if I forget the drug I am miserable.  I don't mind the nausea at all_ it is nothing compared to the misery of RLS.,F,29,5  years,10/15/2006Email,Mirapex

I cut back the dosage to .125 mg and it is effective in controlling the restless legs but I still feel the muscle aches and pains.  My neurologist says Mirapex should not cause muscle pains.

Then everything is ok.If I do not take the medicine my legs are so bad that I have to stay awake all night.  I do alot of walking.  Even trying too back off the dose does not help.,My life is 10x worse since starting this medication.I don't belive that I had a problem to start with (nervous leg) and now I have a drug dependency.

309, 3, PLMD,Mirapex most often allowx me to sleep_ but before I discovered that taking more than my usual dose of 1 mg at bedtime makes me vomit the next day_ I took 1/2 mg extra and each of the couple of times I did that_ I ended up with vomiting for hours the next day. Every once in a while it doesn't work at all_ and my legs jerk me awake over and over_ of course preceded by the tortuous restless_ wormy feeling_ which is often in my arms also. I then decide to just get up and stay awake since I prefer that to falling asleep over and over only to be awakened in a few seconds by the leg jerking and the very uncomfortable feeing in my body that is difficult to describe. It is like falling and then abruptly being jerked. I guess that is the sleep onset_ which is then abruptly jolted by some opposite_ and intense brain process. That is the only way to describe it. I also wake up in the middle of the night and have to hope I can return to sleep. The awakening is not due to PLMD_ I just awaken. I,I wonder if because I have taken it for year_ if Mirapex is now required by my body_ and I would not sleep for days if I tried to go off it. The day time sleepiness is a huge problem and I wonder sometimes if I will fall asleep at the wheel while driving. I come close to that. I do think it has antidepressant effects_ but I also have over the past few years to develop what seems like a shopping disorder. That is new to me. Just today I read that mirapex is a suspect in compulsive gambling and other compulsions. I wonder if this is contributing to my need to buy new things. I also read about circulation problems in the legs and ankles either a concommitant condition or a side effect of RLD and PLMD. I worry that I may develop such a bad case of PLMD_ that I won;t be able to stay asleep at all.,F,62,3  years,8/20/2006,Mirapex

Seven months later began having severe muscle and joint pain_ especially in shoulders_ upper arms_ wrists and hands.,Mirapex was a miracle drug for me.  Before starting it_ I was able to walk only a block or two at 1.5 mph and only with a cane.  Within a couple of weeks I was using the treadmill at a speed of 2.4 mph_ for distances of 1.5 - 2 miles at a time.  My energy level went way up_ I slept uninterrupted 6-7 hours at night_ was able to put away the cane and overall felt great for the first time since 1988.  Seven months later the side effects started suddenly.  I thought it might be a bad bottle of the med_ but a replacement with a different lot number made no difference.  I cut back from .5 mg 3 x a day to .25 mg 2 x a day per doctor's suggestion.

By 6 AM I was so exhausted I could sleep for an hour or so_ before getting ready for work.  I have actually fallen asleep in my chair at work from exhaustion.  How embarrassing. I also believe my PLMD to be partially responsible for the loss of a wonderful relationship a few years ago. My constant fatigue and irritability resulted in me becoming aggressive and argumentative toward her.

I do not have as much energy as I would like_ and have a difficult time staying awake at work when I'm using my computer (ever nod off and type 1000 x's?) My mood seems to be down most of the time_ some times I am just plain crabby.,Neurologist prescribed Mirapex starting at .25 mg but told me I could go as high as 1.5 mg per day. Currently take app. .75 mg at night. It works well if I take it before eating dinner. Usually find that it doesn't have much effect if I have had a meal first. My doctor put me on Celexa for anxiety and to help with my sleep disdorder. Seemed to work very well_ until the insurance company switched me to generic Celexa. All benefits vanished_ so I quit the generic. This may be part or all of the reason for the irritability_ but loss of sleep and drowsiness must have a part_ also. I have been thinking of trying ReQuip_ but one of it's side effects is drowsiness. May not be a good idea. I also take 160 mg of Diovan for moderately high blood presssure.

325, 4, RLS,None yet.,Have rls in legs and arms/upper body. Been on it about 8 months_ noticed recently that it's not always quite as effective as it was initially_ but that could also be due to poor diet or other factors. I noticed my legs really don't bother me AT ALL anymore_ but arms twitch lately. I plan to try changing diet/exercising.,M,27,8  months,4/24/2006,Mirapex
326, 4, RLS & ? Fibromyalgia,Moderate nausea & joint pain in my knees. Some wild dreams and hallucinations and I have noticed a decrease in appetite. (good thing here!),I have been taking mirapex for about 7 days now and I noticed a huge difference in knots up and down legs almost immediately.  My leg spasms are greatly improved and I am trying to return to work after being out for 2 1/2 months for back / hip and muscle pain.  Feel like it is a huge benefit so far_ but somewhat apprehensive about future potential problems if intolerance builds.  Sleeping better so far.,F,43,7  days,4/3/2006Email,Mirapex

330, 4, RLS,1st week_ I had trouble sleeping and had bouts of nausea. This got easier to deal with by week two. Went from .125 mg to 3x .125 over the next two weeks. Sometimes take an extra in the late morning when I need it. Wake up at 3:00 AM but can fall back asleep and usually get 5-7 hours.,This is the first medication that has actually worked. Some daytime RLS still_ but OK at night. Side effects mostly gone by 4th week (I'm on week 5 now). I have tried klonopin (one year..too addictive. Took 4 months to ween myself from it) and ReQuip(stomach pain and medicated feeling)Staring on .25 mg does 2x a day next week. Hope that is as much as I'll need.,M,35,5  weeks,12/17/2005,Mirapex

I also find that I wake up around 3 a.m. and can't get back to sleep. If I take it for more than 3 nights in a row_ I suffer from extreme sleepiness during the day. After once taking it for 5 nights in succession_ I had to stay home from work because I could barely function.,Although some sleep is better than no sleep at all_ I am extremely frustrated with this medication.

The problem caused me to quit taking car trips_ going to the movies and quit taking classes because I could not sit still for more than about 20-30 minutes. Some nights I would have to get out of bed and walk around the house for 30 minutes just to get relief. Back in November 2004_ I had a sleep study done and I was diagnosed with SEVERE RLS and mild Sleep Apnea. I was put on a CPAP machine for the sleep apnea and prescribed .025 Mirapex for the RLS.

Over the past 2 years_ I gradually increased the Mirapex to 4 per day. I added Neurontin about a year ago_ and am now up to 3 per day.  Despite the amount of medication (or maybe because of it??) I am having symptoms throughout the day_ and it's really tortuous at night.

My Dr. has prescribed me Nexium (heart burn medicine) to take 3 pills 1 hr before taking the Mirapex.  Then slowly work down to 1 or none.  This is to prevent the nausea & vomiting.

I definitely have increased joint pain.  Doctor is increasing my dose incrementally to help with my poor sleep.,I have been diagnosed with rls and moderate acid reflux.

I found that .125mg of Xanax worked really well on those days when the symptoms were really bad_ but my doctor discouraged it_ because it's supposed to be addictive.  Going through menopause was a real treat; the symptoms became almost unbearable.  Last year_ my doctor put me on Mirapex (.375mg every night)_ and it works great; however_ if I try to lower the dosage or stop taking it_ my symptoms come back with a vengence.,F,47,1  years,5/27/2004Email,Mirapex

397, 5, restless legs,first few days_ headache. After that_ no side effects.,Had this all my life -- grandmother did_ so does daughter. I tried everything. Finally_ doc made me get a sleep test. Diagnosis: mild RLS and mild sleep apnea. Now sleep with a mask and take Mirapex. It feels like a miracle. I take one pill (.125) about 3:30 in the afternoon_ then another before bed.,F,61,8  months,5/21/2004,Mirapex
398, 3, RLS,Not sure if it's from the mirapex .5mg 2xday or one of the other drugs I take for RLS...  often have loose stools (could be my horrible diet)_ occasional problems with my equalibrium and walk into door-frames_ etc.  often a little drowsy_ seldom hungry.,It seems to be helping (partly due to 2 other meds I'm taking?).  My wife told me my right leg used to jerk about every 40 seconds when I was trying sleep.  Now it probably only jerks 3 - 5 times all night.  And the jerking is less violent. It almost looks as if I was intentionaly streching my leg.  But I can still feel that damn sensation leading up to a movement.,M,42,3  weeks,5/13/2004Email,Mirapex
399, 5, Restless legs,,I've had restless legs for many years and it was getting worse. I could rarely sleep until it was almost morning. The doctor had me try Neurontin and it did nothing. Then he suggested Mirapex and it was like a miracle.  I was sleeping through the night for the first time in years.I take the smallest dose_ half a pill  at night. I don't notice any side effects. I can't imagine doing without it now.,F,65,6  months,4/29/2004,Mirapex

402, 4, RLS,The dose that best controls my RLS is 1.5 mg @ bedtime; however_ I THINK this dose contributes to wakefulness.  I have had problems staying asleep for some time_ so it took me a while to realize that Mirapex is likely contributing to it.  At 1 mg at bedtime_ I sleep much better; however_ after 2-3 nights at 1 mg_ my RLS_ again_ becomes a problem.  Increasing the dose to 1.25 mg is not enough.  1.5 mg takes care of the RLS but seems to keep me awake.  Any suggestions?,1.5 mg works very well in controlling my RLS.  I switch back & forth from 1 mg to 1.5 mg (see comments in side effects).,F,60,1  years,4/23/2004,Mirapex

412, 5, RLS,Possibly nasal congestion,Mirapex has been a cure for my restless legs and arms.  After suffering with RLS for many years and trying several different treatments_ I learned of mirapex via the RLS chatroom late one night--as I was awake with jumping legs/arms.  My physician was unaware of its use in tx of RLS_ and after my success with it has prescribed it for others.  I praise mirapex as a miracle drug--Wish all physicians were more aware of the use of this drug when treating RLS.  Truly it has given me a peace that I thought I would never have.  My dosage is .25mg q 12 hours_ with an occasional additional 1/2 tab. if needed.  I can't praise  Mirapex loudly enough!!,F,55,2  years,1/28/2004Email,Mirapex
413, 5, Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS),None whatsoever experienced by me.  I'm 52.My father_ however_ gets sleep attacks.  He's 80.,I've been on Mirapex daily (.25 3xday) for over 4 years.  I have suffered from RLS for 25 years with it getting progressively worse.  Had to take Sinemet for several years every 4 hours daily - I was waking in the middle of the night to take it because my RLS was so bad I couldn't risk missing a dose.  Developed augmentation to it and then discovered Mirapex!  What a life saver it has been for me.  It was like getting my life back.  I've experienced NONE of the reported side effects - namely_ sleep attacks.  I'm also a flight attendant and it's very important for me to be alert while on the job.  Mirapex hasn't dimenished that at all. My father has severe RLS also and the Mirapex isn't working for him.  He's taken it for over a year now. He's also on other meds and that may have something to do with it.  I was so hopeful because of my positive experience.  But we're not giving up!,F,52,4  years,1/2/2004Email,Mirapex
