0, 5, hypertension_ tachycardia,Just slower than normal heartrate.,,F,71,6  years50 mg 2X D,2/5/2016,Lopressor
1, 4, tachycardia_tremor_fainting_weak,freezing cold hands and feet (improved with time)_ mellow mood (but happy)_ lethargic_ extreme fatigue (maybe due to my medical condition),Cardiologist diagnosed me with POTS.  this drug did wonders for my tremor_ fast heart rate (had episodes with rates well into the 200's and I felt like I was going to die).  I can feel my heart trying to race sometimes_ and can feel the medication preventing it.  It's drastically improved the fainting spells and weakness.  Prior to this drug_ my blood pressure had dropped to 90/60 and 80/50_ I was so weak that I couldn't walk and thanks to this drug_ now its back up to normal again.  It's been like a miracle for me. This drug has given me back my life.  At least now I can do sedentary work and function again.,F,46,2  years50 mg 2X D,6/26/2014,Lopressor

4, 3, High b/p &irregular Heart beat,I experienced  cold hands and just feel spaced out...and agitated....I am a very active person and when I workout my heart doesn't get over 150.. Thus making it difficult to burn necessary calories...I'm stopping this medication...I would rather deal with the irregular heartbeat...that's easier that dealing with the side effects of this medication,If your doctor suggest this medication make sure you ask what the side effects are.....,F,39,5  days50 2X D,2/26/2013Email,Lopressor
5, 4, A-fib_ hypertension,Fatigue_ nausea_ depression_ weakness_ lethargic. Multiple cases of atrial fibrillation tried to sort it out using medication. Heart used to race at 160-200 bpm. The medication has stopped that although I still feel it every now and again 'trying' to race away but less often now. I've forced myself to eat healthy and try to exercise but its like having all the wind taken out of your sails and unless you have a strong will then you will simply stop_ lay down exhausted and become depressed. Side effect of the drug. But it's a MUCH better side effect than having a-fib and its feeling of sickness and doom.,,M,28,1  months25mg x 2,11/20/2012,Lopressor
6, 3, High Blood Pressure,Definitely mellowed me out.  I'm seriously Type A.  But my hands are numb every morning_ and a muscle in my right hand has not stopped twitching since I started the medication.  I've never experienced that so I am pretty sure it is the medication.,My b.p. fluctuates a lot_ probably due to perimenopause.  Sometimes it is 160/110_ sometimes it is 130/90.  I'm taking a very low dose_ and last night I felt so weird - my b.p. was 99/68.  Woah.  Even when I was young and very athletic my lowest b.p. was about 110/80.The last thing I need to do is gain more weight - hopefully that doesn't happen.,F,44,5  days12.5 1X D,12/15/2011,Lopressor

8, 5, Tachy/Afib from Pericarditis w/HBP,Drowsy_ spaced-out_ vivid (but happy) dreams_ lack of energy.,In my case_ the side effects are well worth the fact that my heart is not racing or beating irregularly.  I have taken this medication for 4 months_ roughly a year ago_ for the same issue.,F,45,10  days50 MG 2X D,7/29/2011Email,Lopressor

10, 4, Hypertension_ Mitral Valve Prolapse,5-7lb weight gain,I went to a cardiologist about episodes of very high blood pressure and palpitations.  He diagnosed hypertension and mitral valve prolapse.  The metoprolol has not only helped my blood pressure_ but has taken away palpitations and heaviness I sometimes felt in my chest_ especially in prone position.  For my particular problems_ it worked very well_ and I think I'm more relaxed...not as prone to anxiety as I used to be.  Not thrilled about the weight gain_ but I had gotten down to a normal weight before taking_ and the extra lbs aren't really a problem beyond vanity.  I've exercised all my life_ and I can exercise as well now_ or better_ than before.,F,50,15  months25mg 2X D,2/24/2011Email,Lopressor

12, 1, High Blood Pressure,Severe blurry vision especially in right eye_ overall body achiness_ fluid build up in legs,My doctor started me out on a lower dosage but raised it when med didn't lower bp.  That's about the time my problems started.  I've had 20/20 vision my entire life but my vision blurred and looking through my right eye was like trying to look through very dark sunglasses_ blurry as well.  I also started retaining water in my legs_ something that's never happened before.  It also felt as if I had arthritis in every joint in my body.  Call me a hypochondriac but it seems pretty coincidental considering what I've began discovering about this medication.  I'm going to ask my doctor to put me on something else.,M,44,3  months100 mg 1X D,1/26/2011Email,Lopressor

14, 4, Hypertension,May slightly aggravate my Asthma_ but not enough to stop using it.,Side effect profile low_ It has worked well for me in conjunction with Hyzaar 100/25.

I got a lot of unpleasant side effects from it. I had a perpetual dull headache and missed a lot of work from the nausea. I am constantly bloated_ even on days when I only eat a small amount due to nausea. I have a high metabolism but gained weight almost immediately.

I have had 3 ablations_ and I also take Tikosyn.  I think lopressor works well for me_ for the most part it keeps my B/P from spiking most of the day_ it is held around 140/90 if I miss a dose or we try to wean me off lopressor within 6 hours of the lower or no dose_ my B/P is 190/110 or higher.  The vivid dreams are the worse and the main reason my doctor believes I should try and stop taking it.  I was married once to a not so wonderful guy_ who still won't leave me alone and I keep having a dream of him killing me.  when I wake up from it_ or someone wakes me from my screams_ my pulse is over 250 and my B/P is 198/150.

27, 3, Atrial fibriallation,"Tired_ ""needing a nap"" feeling is getting old.  Weight gain may be because I have no motivation to exercise anymore.  Pulse seems almost too low_ 45-50 @ rest.  And_ not sure if this is related to Lopressor_ but I love spicy/Hot foods_ and now can't seem to eat anymore.  Not because of stomach or heart burn issues_ just burns my mouth_ bad!",I was hospitalized briefly for Atrial fibrillation_ which converted back to normal sinus rhythm on its own.

Really hard to work out at a cardio level. Also have severe short term memory loss_ but ascribe that to age-related issues_ but then_ who knows?,Complained to my physicians about side effect_ but am told the drug has been too successful to consider switching to another.

32, 4, BP,Some shortness of breath when standing up or starting exercise_ tachycardia,"Taking 25 mg twice daily. Considering all of the complaints on this board_ MANY OF WHICH I HAVE SUFFERED WITH OTHER DRUGS_ I consider myself lucky. I guess it's a matter of finding the right drug and NOT ""listening"" (obeying is a better term) to your doctor_ who doesn't care about the side effects_ many of which are worse than his cure.",M,67,3.5  years,7/22/2009,Lopressor
33, 2, Atrial fibriallation,Spacey and unable to concentrate at work; vivid dreams at night; need for daytime naps which I never took before!,My cardiologist told me to take 1/2 tablet (25 grams) of Metoprolol ER once a day.  It worked great for suppressing my AVs.  However_ I only lasted a week on it because I couldn't stand the constant sleepiness and space cadet feeling.  Then I tried 1/4 tablet for 2 weeks and that didn't improve the side effects.  My AVs are of short duration and intermittent.  I'd rather deal with them and remain alert and awake.,F,47,21  days,3/15/2009,Lopressor
34, 4, Tachycardia,Low blood pressure_ a slowed down feeling. I can't exercise with the same intensity anymore. I tire easily_ lessened physical endurance_ feeling cold all the time_ need more sleep_ bp will drop suddenly very low and make me very sleepy,"Metoprolol has helped to control my tachycardia_ which was causing chest pain_ shortness of breath_ and other cardiovascular problems. A really nice side effect is that it has helped my PTSD. Since Metoprolol actually works by blocking the release of adrenalin(in layman terms)_ it therefore is great for reducing anxiety and that ""flight or fight"" state that I had seemed to live in prior to Metoprolol. I am mellower_ and more laid back_ not quite so ""driven."" As one of those Type A sort of folks_ that has been a nice side effect. I just wish it didn't make me so tired and I could do the sort of cardiovascular exercises I like to do. It does frustrate me that I cannot do all the things I want to do.",F,33,2  years,1/14/2009,Lopressor

43, 2, Supraventrical Tachycardia,I was prescribed this medication to prevent future episodes of SVT.  Firstly_ it didn't prevent my episodes of SVT_ I had nightmares and violent dreams frequently_ and I put on 10 pounds as a result.  Lopressor slows your heart rate and makes you sluggish....excerising is almost impossible when on this drug....a definite conflict.,I hear it is good for lowering your blood pressure...that was not why I took it and had to monitor my blood pressure to ensure it wasn't too low.,F,52,7  months,2/13/2008,Lopressor

45, 1, High Blood Pressure,I have been unable to work for over a week.  I decided to go on-line to see what if any side effects may be caused by lopressor.  It seems that it may be possible that the tingling sensation in my fingers and toes_ nausea to the point that I want to throw up_ headaches_ chronic fatigue_ dizziness so severe that I cannot drive_ agitation_ mood changes_ could all be a result of this medication.  There have been times I felt I was not going to make it through the day. I am going to ask my doctor to take me off of it immediately.,,F,52,3  days,10/25/2007,Lopressor

47, 2, 235/120,gained 50 pounds in under a year_ drug limits my ability to engage in aerobic exercise.,I am on norvasc_ lopressor_ and avlide.  Lopressor was the first one they put me on.  It controlled the BP well for a while_ but the dosage has been increased from 25mg/day to 100mg/day over three years.  In that time_ the other drugs were added too.  Metoprolol by itself brings blood pressure down considerably (I can see the effects within 20 to 30 minutes on the BP machine) but now I'm obese.  I wasn't before.  Doesn't seem like a good tradeoff to me.  I wish someone could answer the question:  Why did a healthy non-drug using 24 year old end up in the ER with BP of 235/120?  Why do I have to keep increasing the doses of lopressor and other drugs so rapidly just to stay under 160/60?,M,27,3  years,6/23/2007Email,Lopressor
48, 2, Congestive heart failure,Since beginning beta blockers_ I've gained 25 lbs_ I'm tired all the time_ and after months on metorpolol_ I've begun to have chest discomfort.  Then_ when lisinopril was added_ the chest discomfort became much worse and I felt as though I aged 10 years in 3 months.  I had a bunch of tests done to find the cause of the chest pain and they could find nothing.  I told the Dr. I wanted to stop the lisinopril and see if I felt better_ and I did.  I got back 8 of the 10 years I felt I lost!!  So lisinopril is history.,I'm not convinced that metoprolol is doing me anything positive_ but it is doing plenty negative.  When I miss a dose_ I feel SOOO much better!!!,M,51,300  days,5/10/2007,Lopressor
49, 2, Heart and BP,I developed afternoon Chronic Fatigue_ and I gained up to 30 lbs. due to Lopressor.  I got off it after 2 yrs. on it and my caring doc switched me to Atenolol for Tenormin.  Now I'm calmer_ have more energy and less appetite.,,F,68,2  years,2/17/2007Email,Lopressor
50, 2, BP and Heart disease,It caused nightly heartburn/indigestion.  Since switching to Atenolol (Tenormin)_ this symptom has decreased 95%.  No bad side effects so far.,I believe Lopressor is a support system_ i.e._ it keeps you alive_ so I went off it so I could live naturally.  Now the Aenolol works even better.,F,62,15  days,2/17/2007,Lopressor

They were happening 20-30 times an hour_ keeping me awake at night and scaring me to death.  After having numerous heart and blood tests_ that came back as normal_ Dr. put me on lopressor.  In addition to regulating my heartrate_ it helps with my high blood pressure_ and I feel less tense. Also seems to help with my headaches...they are fewer and less severe. Really helped me get back to normal.  I am on a very low dose that I also take with dyazide for high BP.,I used to take Inderal 22 years ago for heart palpitiations_ but I like lopressor better.
