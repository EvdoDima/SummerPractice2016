14, 1, Seasonal allergies/rhinitis,I'm a nurse_ and I always look at side effects before taking any medication.  So I did see this med could cause mood alteration_ but like everyone else_ just thought it was rare and wouldn't happen to me.  However_ by day 5 I was starting to feel mood swings_ and on the 6th day I had this almost paralyzed mental state_ hard to describe but I could not even get out of bed.  Laid there and cried all day_ in a panic state_  not knowing why_ until I put two and two together and realized it was the medication.  Started investigating more_ and see multiple people with similar reactions within days of starting this med.    Stopped taking that day_ and mood has improved_ but in the 2 nights since stopping I have woken up panicked from sleep for no reason_ this last time I was out of bed and opening my closet before I even became conscious_ I don't know what my dream was_ but I was very afraid and my heart was pounding.,The side effects are DEFINITELY not worth the benefit for me.  Sad to see all the children who become so depressed and suicidial_ at least As an adult I knew what was happening.   How scary for a child!!!,F,49,5  days10mg,5/25/2016,Singulair

18, 1, Allergy induced asthma,Extream pressure in ears_ vertigo_ achey joints mostly hips and shoulders.  Horrible indigestion with heart burn and acid reflux.  Anxiety_ feeling like I was going to die (which I have never had my entire life). Heart pounding and heart palpitations.  Numbness with pins and needles_ on face_ left arm and left calf. Brain fog_ forgetfulness_ no get up and go.  Two lung infections and I've had lung inflammation once.  I believe these are all side effects of singular. Side effects came on gradually and I never thought it could be because of singular.  I stopped taking it by accident ( forgot to pick up my rx) and realized my hips weren't hurting.  I continued from there cold turkey.,I've been off for two months now and I'm so much better.  It didn't happen for me right away.  Joint pain and indigestion went away first with in a few days.  Palpitations were next to go.. Brain fog and numbness took about a month to get better (pin and needles went away with in a week of stopping singular) anxiety is SO much better_ still have little episodes and heart pounding every once in a while.  My symptoms (now I know side effects) were really bad for two years I'm hoping they continue to go completely away.  Singular has ruined the last two years of my life! I thought I was going crazy.  I've been to my Dr eight times in the past two years_ I've been to a neurologist_ and I've had a treadmill test.  All because of singular.  Don't take it_ it will kill you or ruin your life!! I can't get these years back thank God for my husband that is absolutely amazing and just kept telling me we'll figure this out.  If anyone can say how long it took them to feel 100% normal again please say how long it took.  I'm praying this is not my new normal_ these little bouts of anxiety and heart pounding just keep reminding me I'm not quite back to my normal.,F,47,4  years,5/14/2016Email,Singulair
19, 1, Exercise asthma,Horrible side effects emotionally and mentally.  I have allergy to steroids.  They cause depression etc.  Doctor stated no steroid in singular and I asked about psychiatric side effects as I had looked up.  It took me 3 weeks on medication to realize once again deeper depression. Fatigue..yet restlessness to initiate a chore and then couldn't motivate myself to do it.  Self centered fear. Almost a phobic feeling of going places. Hopelessness.  Which with my spirituality never experienced so strong. Isolation due to how I felt internally and didn't want to interact with people because I felt so low. I am a very outgoing person.  Which changed taking singular. I almost thought of going into a mental health facility because I couldn't understand what had given me such a turn or a change in my thoughts and behaviors. I stopped last night. Still feeling the after effects. But I said to Doctor about side effects depression etc. he said minuscule. Actually feel he didn't believe that steroid inhalers caused depression .  I will never go near steroid inhalers and it singular or drugs similar.  I felt like I was almost having a breakdown,I would never suggest anyone taking this medicine singular.  Or at least having a lengthy conversation of side effects.  Not minimizing so.  Even then I would say.  It's not worth it. The drug is evil and if you don't connect psychiatric side effects if present ..to this drug. Singular.  You might destroy your mental health.  Even give you thoughts of suicide. Many people may say.

The diarrhea wasn't a constant when on the med but when I had it the intensity was worse then a stomach virus and URGENT.  Again the most obvious side effect was weight gain.  I was shocked when it wasn't listed as a side effect.  If it wasn't for being in touch with my body and being fit this weight gain could of went on for a while.

The 6th day (3 days ago) I wrote a very angry incoherant rant in an email at work which got me into trouble. I don't really remember much about it other than I was in an extremly angry and agitated state of mind for no reason whatsoever. This type of behavior is not in my character at all. I'm the type of person that always goes out of his way to be kind and courteous to others.

The worry is accompanied by fits of weeping. I get dizzy_ have trouble concentrating & feel like I'm not as sharp. Then there are the dreams......! They are INTENSE_ horrible_ colorful; motion picture-like. These experiences were previously just not normal. Roll forward to the last 6 months. I started having events of ""sleep walking"". Never had them before. My husband reports that I wake up_ go to the bathroom_ come back & start verbally abusing him. The events happen randomly. Been on Singulair for the last month. I take it in the morning to avoid the dreams. They aren't as bad_ but they are still present. Last night I had another sleep walking spell. This time was the same as before (I'm told) but this time I struck my husband hard enough to split his lip! I do NOT hit. That is NOT who I am!!

80, 1, Asthma/allergies,We have just hit the two month mark with montelukast (gen for singulair) and my independent_ spirited_ loving daughter has changed drastically.  I don't recognize her anymore.  She screams at me all day_ she will not listen at all_ she has been throwing violent tantrums - one of which resulted in her falling down and hitting her head.  I have bruises on my arms from her kicking and punching me.  She has scratched herself all over her arms_ legs and chest and has been complaining about stomach pain and itchy skin.  She has always been strong willed but never violent and always loving.  These symptoms just surfaced about a week and a half ago.  My pediatrician told me if she was going to have a reaction to the medication_ it would occur within the first few days of her taking it.  I thought she would be fine on it because she didn't have any adverse reactions for the first 6 to 7 weeks.  The medication has helped her asthma tremendously but I am taking her off of it because it has altered her personality severely.  Singular should not be prescribed to children.

82, 1, asthma,My daughter took montelukast from the age of 3yrs for poorly controlled asthma symptoms. Over a period of time_ we noticed her usual cheerful personality changed and she became more subdued. She began complaining of bad headaches_to the extent she couldn't bend down. GP said they were stress related_which I questioned as I couldn't believe a 6yr old child could be suffering from stress. I read up on her medications and decided upon myself to stop montelukast_ much to the anger of her asthma consultant. The headaches ceased and she became more like her old self. Shortly after this time_ we noticed that she was pulling her eyelashes/eyebrows out(in secret) and couldn't  explain why she was doing this. She was refered to CAAMHS and diagnosed with severe anxiety issues_ but continues to pull her hair out to this day-she is now 9yrs old. I felt guilty that I stopped her asthma medication- which is still poorly controlled-assuming that the GP's initial diagnosis of stress headaches was probably correct. Last week_ her consultant re-prescribed montelukast & the headaches have started again. This has now lead me to think that I was right after all  about the headaches and after reading comments on this website that possibly my 9 year old daughter's 'mental health' issues stem from the prolonged use of montelukast during her early years.,See above,F,3,3  years5mg,2/26/2015,Singulair

They helped_ some_ but I thought the dr would just supplement the Singulair to get me through the difficult fall season. Otherwise_ it had worked just fine.The inhalers worked for awhile_ then quit helping. I've had about four or five of them. I've asked for the Singulair back each time one quilt helping_ but the doctors all said these inhalers were soooo much better_ let's try another one. Never having lasting effects_ and very expensive_ especially when starting a new fiscal year with insurance deductibles_ I asked the doctor again_ for the Singulair. ""Why_ when you keep saying it doesn't work"" I reminded them that it was the cortisone inhalers that didn't help after a few months_ they were too expensive_ and Singulair DID work_ even though I might need a boost in the fall season. Singulair is what works best for me. I have quit all of those  cortisone inhalers doctors are so determined to keep me on. I use the ProAir inhaler maybe 3 times a month_ or the nebulizer when I get a cold.

It was so worrisome.  Then I looked up the side effects of singular and took her off it immediately.  You need to also go to the FDA sight and make a complaint.  Never give your child this medicine.  She also had daily headaches and hot flashes.,,F,10,3  months2mg 1X D,7/23/2014Email,Singulair
111, 4, Asthma & allergies,Joint pain in my knees and ankles_ disconcerting dreams (odd dreams not scary)_ light headache_ mild neck and back pain (could be attributed to tension in sleep due to the unusual dreams).,Felt the effect of my bronchial airways opening up 30 minutes after I took my first pill and was astounded and thrilled - an hour after I took the pill I could not stay awake and that night I had my first odd dream (odd dreams each of the 5 nights on 10mg).  The meds also alleviated my allergies and was able to smell (sinuses opened) but I was dizzy the next day and very tired.  Three days later started feeling achy in my knees.  Two days later (5 days on the pills total)  having problems going up and down stairs due to my knee joint pain_ also have aches begin in my ankles plus mild head ache and light neck/back pain.  At this point I halved my dose to 5mg.  So far the joint paint is almost negligible (14 days total)_ dreams less odd still mild neck/back pain which is slowly lessening but I still find within an hour of taking my pill I am tranquilized and want to sleep; however_ now I can fight it and stay awake and it does pass after about 10 minutes (at 10 mg was not able to stay awake).  I take my pill at night so I just take it 30 minutes before bed so I don't have to fight the drowsiness it brings.  My bronchial airways are still open and my sinuses are better than when on an antihistamine and cortisol steroid inhaler combo regimen.  I am a bit tired during the day but I can accept this_ the odd dreams_ and the minor aches and pains since I can breathe again.  I have not had to use my rescue inhaler once in the last 2 weeks.,F,48,14  days10mg 1X D,7/8/2014Email,Singulair
112, 5, Asthma,Twitching eye lids every day. Insomnia for the first few days_ but this has now passed.,Singulair (or Montelukast Sodium as we call it in New Zealand) has given me my life back. For the past year I have had a cough and wheezing that would not go away. I have been on steroid tablets and three different puffers just to be able to breathe - and all I have done is breathe since any activity caused me to have really bad attacks. My Dr prescribed me Singluair as a last resort since every time I was due to have a Saline Challenge for a proper diagnosis_ I would get some sort of chest infection and so a diagnosis was just impossible. Within a few days of starting my cough just stopped. Another couple of days and my wheeze stopped. I no longer feel like someone is permanently holding my chest in a vice. I can live with the twitching because breathing is far more important to me and I can not tell you how good it is to be able to go outside and play with my kids again.,F,42,14  days10mg 1X D,6/25/2014Email,Singulair

I took my first dose last night_ and it took 1 hour to fall asleep. No weird dreams_ but in the morning_ I woke up 1.5 hours early because of the pain. Even antacids could not take the pain away. It seems that Singulair is yet another drug to add to the long list of drugs I cannot use. Judging by the side effects I read here_ that may not be an entirely bad thing. While I took it_ I didn't notice any improvement. Found it rather tough to breath_ and my nose felt stuffy.,F,40,1  days10 1X D,6/19/2014,Singulair

Maybe like 3 times year_ for a short duration of 4 days. Recently_ the doctor gave her this again for 4 days. Today is the 5th day that she has withdrawn from the medicine yet it has changed her personality completely. She has become aggressive and screams that she wants to throw out her favourite teddy bear in the garbage. It's scary. As you can see no kid in the right state of mind would ever suggest this. She was not joking_ she was serious about it. My worst experience are the night terrors. At first she will kick and scream about opening the door for 10 minutes_ now her episodes last for 30 minutes.

126, 1, seasonal allergies_ rhinitis,anxiety_ depression_ insomnia_ isolation_ panic attacks_ She did take this for two years with no issues but once put back on it a year later things took a scary turn.,I am posting this on behalf of my then 10  year old daughter who began taking Singulair (brand) at about age 7 until age 9 and then put her back on it at age 10 for about 16 days.   After about three weeks_  my daughter came home a completely different person. It was as if a light switch had gone on or off.  She had anxiety at a level I've never experienced_ panic attacks_ feelings of throat tightening which I believe was a byproduct of the anxiety.  Since_ this was so sudden and not gradual I had to ask myself what had changed.  I realized that she had just began taking the generic Singulair and stopped immediately and took her to the pediatrician for confirmation that it was the right thing to do (honestly_ I would have done it with or without the doctors permission)  This occurred on June 13_ 2013 and within about 3 weeks we saw marked improvement and also had began seeing a counselor and doing a LOT of cognitive behavior therapy on a minute by minute basis.  This was a happy go lucky_ goofy_ playful_ funny_ smart_ outgoing child that retreated to her room and was in a panic when I was not near here.  I literally slept in her room for 2 weeks.    She would cry for no reason and stopped eating - lost about 7 pounds.  It was quite possibly the most frightening time in my life and obviously hers.  She has rebounded well but I do see some residual effects quite possibly because of the memory of how she felt.

Since having an immune disease and chronic sisusitus I wasn't surprised by the immediate onset of a sinus cold_ but noticed the unusual runny nose.  Shortly after I felt much better.  Then I soon realized I had mistakenly left singulair out of my pill container upon refilling....i didn't notice until 5 or so missed doses.  So I went back on it thinking it was unrelated and the symptoms immediately returned and worsened.  I've noticed insomnia is also an issue (it is 2:30 am as I write this).  My throat pain is immense and head hurts soooo bad and now it seems I have the onset of an ear infection.  Not happy and stopped taking this drug 2 nights ago.

He's not as obsessive and introverted (e.g._ hooked on video games) and is back out playing basketball with his brother_ volunteering to help with his dad_ etc.  We thought_ for a moment_ he grew out of being a surly pre-teen.But no...the day we realized he stopped taking it (mid spring-flowering trees_ of course)_ we asked_ and he insisted it was an accident and took it in front of us.

They were both getting very sensitive about things and very emotional about things_  panic attacks_ example: one son was very overwhelmed about how he was going to care for his teddy bears and had a panic attack and hyperventilate about it_ you could see the fear in their eyes. Fear about the weather all the time... I can go on and on and on and my two boys had changed so much in just six months. I thought maybe they were just going through a phase.

She would hit out and not listen_ she was impossible to reason with and could not sit still at all. Her pre-school teachers started to ask if she was on Steriods as they knew these made her hyper_ but she wasnt.

She was sleeping with me_ and even then she remained afraid.  When someone suggested it might be singular I notified her doctor right away and she was taken off the drug.  The removal of singulair makes me feel as if I have my daughter back.  She's no longer afraid.  She's sleeping in her room and will even hang out downstairs alone!  This is big people!

We thought at first stress-spoke to him and he said not under stress. I didn't relate the meds at the time.  He ran out of meds and it was awhile before i got a refill.  All of a sudden the tic disorders stopped.  I still didn't think it was the meds.  I was focused on him possbily being stressed and not telling us.  When i refilled his meds and just gave him the Singulair NOT the Flonaise - soon after the Tic Disorder began again!  I immediately equated it to the Singulair made him stop and threw them away.  I have reviewed side effects and I am convinced this was caused from that medication.  Regardless of no mention of this possibility.  It was a scary moment to see him uncontrollably blinking his eyes and jerking -he said he didn't realize he was doing it.,I was told by his physician that this was not related_ I am not convinced I am his parent I know my son- if all of sudden you as a parent notice a difference in your child PLEASE don't listen to anyone other than YOUR CHILD!!!!,M,12,5  weeks10 mg 1X D,9/20/2012Email,Singulair

220, 1, Bad allergies,Bad dreams_ Restlessness_ Irritability_ Sleepwalking_ Fear_ Crying spells.,My 5yr old daughter has been on this for a little over two weeks. She is also on 10mg of Zyrtec. The Zyrtec has never given her any problems. It just was not working on it's own. Once she started taking Singular_ it helped almost instantly. But_ then_ she changed. She started having a nasty attitude. She was going out of her way to disobey us. She was becoming very aggressive. This is nothing like her normal self. She is now extremely scared to be in another part of the house without someone with her. She started getting up and standing in her floor peeing. She would be asleep and not know what was going on. At first I had blamed it on her no longer taking naps at preschool. But she had stopped them a few months ago. What clicked was tonight. She had gotten out of bed. Walked over to her dresser. Peed in the floor. Then_ climbed back in bed. My husband woke her up to change. She had no clue she was even wet. She swore she did not pee her pants. She had no memory of getting out of bed. She has only done this since being on Singular. She has been dry through the night for several years before this. She has also been complaining of her stomach bothering her on several occasions. She has also had quite a few meltdowns over nothing. She had one again tonight right before bed. She is normally a very laid back happy smart little girl. But_ since being in Singular_ she is completely different. I am not giving her anymore of this medicine. I was afraid to give it to her to begin with.,F,5,2  weeks5mg 1X D,5/14/2012Email,Singulair

Great at first_ asthma cleared right up so we could put the inhaler away almost completely. Slow but progressive behavioural problems in preschool and kindergarten to point we took him out of school as disrupting other students and teachers. He seemed so angry_ touchy_ hypersensitive and miserable. Didn't consider Singulair to be the cause until we revisited the medi info as we were at wits end. Also son has preexisting problems with ears which we misinterpreted as being partial cause of problems.. Been off Singulair for over 3 weeks now with doctor's consent with management and he has really lifted in mood and has improved dramatically at school. The doctor does not seem to rate the side affect very seriously. The longer term affect of the drug seems to have  altered our son's overall perceptions of his world. He's much happier already but he still draws things that worry his teacher f,Works great on the asthma symptoms but be absolutely vigilant for side effects on mood.

Being a great student to being sent to the office frequently for his bad behavior.,My 6 year old son took singulair and advair together for two months from October to December 9; because of his seasonal allergies he got sick almost once a month so his doctor recommended both medications.

Then I got more calls from the nurse for the same reason and when I'll go to school to drop his clothes he will be crying that he missed me a lot.  He got very emotional in school_ all of a sudden he will start crying for no reason or scream in the middle of class.  I didn't know what was going on.  I had several conferences with his teacher were she said that he stop doing his work in class.  I couldn't understand what was going on.  I took him to his doctor and she said that he seem fine that maybe he was just going thru one of those periods were kids just get tired of school and work.  We went thru this for about a month I got very frustrated. On December 9_ I took him to school and came home crying and praying to God to help me find an answer.  I went to the kitchen and saw his medication google it and found this website and many more forums describing the same symptoms my son was going thru.

Since we started her on this medication when she was 3 or 4 I was beginning to think there was something ""wrong"" with her personality.  We switched allergy doctors solely b/c our previous DR relocated.  The new MD took her off singulair and increased her pulmicort does.  I immediately noticed a difference in her disposition_ attitude and behavior.  We go back in 1 mos for another lung function test.  Hopefully it's good but if not I will be looking for other options to relieve the symptoms.  We won't be using singulair again.",,F,7,4  years5mg 1X D,5/31/2011,Singulair

316, 1, Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria,I have chronic idiopathic urticaria (8 months so far) .  Side effects of this Rx were nightmares_ night sweats_ body rash_ swelling of face_ eyes_ lips and throat.  Dry cough and Headache. Chest pain between my breasts. Renal failure.  Low grade fever.  Inability to concentrate with short term memory loss.  This reaction reaction sent me to ER_ as I could not breath.  Oh_ and forget about sleeping.  That reaction to Singulair made the hives become angiodemic and  worse than ever.  I took me days to get it out of my system.,I tried taking this medicine about a month ago off and on and ended up in ER on a drip_ but I was taking so many other meds_ I did not make the connection.   This week I took 2 doses_ two nights in a row_ the symptoms happened very fast_ on the 2nd night_ I woke up with my face & lips swelled.  This is the fourth day 4 am and I would have gone to the ER again_ but I was able to medicate myself per Doctor's advice: 50 mg benadryl_ 300 mg zantac_ 20 mg hydroxizine_ 10 mg zyrtec and .5 mg xanax.  My albutarol inhaler aided to open my airway.  I did not use the Epi. I am hoping I can get it out of my system by tomorrow because I have to work tomorrow.  It's hard to cover a swollen face and lips_ looks like I have been beaten up.

We had to put restraints on him as his symptoms increased in intensity to keep him safe as he was trying to bite off his fingers_ scratching at his skin_ and banging his head. He had brain scans and an EEG. He was seen by neurology_ psychiatry_ infectious disease_ toxicology_ etc. After being hospitalized and with no relief from the anti-psychotic medications for 3 days_ a psychiatrist found infomation on the internet about psychosis in children who were taking Singulair. With no answers yet_ and nothing else to do_ she tried taking him off of the drug. With in 3 days_ he was back to normal_ and happier than ever. He's been off the drug for 12 days.

She was holding her ears and pointing at things in the room (that weren't there) and screaming ""Mommy make it stop!!!!"". Her heart was pounding out of her chest....it was just terrifying.

I have no compassion_ empathy or emotion towards anyone.  There are too many negatives to type.  Taking this medication could get me fired from my job and divorced if my husband wasn't so understanding.  I got my first speeding ticket in 14 years after taking this medication for 2 weeks.

334, 3, asthma,aggressive_ hyper,With the winter thaw_ my 5 year old son gets a terrible dry cough every year for about 2 months. I had him on steroid inhalers last year_ but took him off after he become so aggressive he tried to choke me several times and he was still coughing quite a bit. I then tried Singular. He was not as aggressive_ but very hyper on the 4mg I was prescribed to give him_ but the coughing completely stopped. So I decide to experiment a bit. I HALFED THE PILLS and then HALFED them again so he was taking 1MG. Worked like a charm. Not as hyper and no aggression and it was just enough so that he didn't cough at night. My gut was that his little body couldn't handle the high dose and why not try and cut it down? Singular also has a red dye it in that some children have really bad reactions to. Perhaps that could be the problem as well. An alternative to that would be to be prescribed the adult dosage and cut it right down. Adult dosage does not have the red dye in it (the red for the 4 and 5mg is because it's a chewable for children). I think I'll try that next year and see if I can see a change. It's only for a couple months and I now give it to him RIGHT before bed so I don't have to see the instant change in him. Somehow my little dude falls asleep.

Between colds was not much better with persistent nighttime cough that made him miserable from Oct-Mar. Summer he is a different boy with no issues. Prescribed inhalers made little difference. First cold of this winter was the worst yet and he coughed so hard for a weekend he was sick and crying from the pain. After I argued that the inhaler was having no effect the doctor prescribed this and his life has become normal. Colds like any other child but no persistent cough. We worried about his behavior over Christmas and after reading this forum reacted be withdrawing the medicine. This was a huge mistake and after a week we reinstated to eliminate the symptoms.

She has had these symptoms for one month (almost exactly the same time she started Singulair) and luckily a lightbulb went off in my head to check the Singulair side effects.  Are we ever so happy to see this website.  Effective immediately_ we are stopping the medicine.  It did help her ashtma conditions_ but these negative side effects outweigh the benefits.

362, 1, Allergies,Severe anxiety_ heart palpitations_ constant panic attacks_ unusual behavior and thoughts_ very upset and easily aggitated_ unusual dreams and hallucinations_ GI disturbances,I cannot understand how several doctors insist that this is such a wonderful drug. It works therapeutically for asthma but the side effects are horrendous. Drugs work differently on individuals but the ratio of this drug benefiting any individual is outweighed by it's adverse effects. I began taking Singulair in October 2010 and my entire life has spiraled downward. The panic attacks and constant anxiety would never cease. I have been to several doctors and have spent so much money on trying to find out what was wrong with me. It got to the point where I was almost incapable of functioning. I was having 3 to 4 panic attacks weekly and ended up in the hospital on a couple of occasions. I have my bachelor's degree in Psychology and I am currently in nursing school so I was struggling horribly with this turmoil. For those who like to comment on this page and say that maybe we are just crazy and that singulair has worked for them_ well that is wonderful in their case. But clearly any intelligent person can see that this many people CANNOT make up all of these side effects. This drug has hurt my relationship and has affected my 11 year old daughter. I started counseling because I am highly against the use of anti-anxiety/antidepressants and of course every doctor I visited said_ you are just having anxiety and stress because of school_ let me write you a Rx. for an antidepressant. That is not normal but unfortunately that is what is done in todays world.,F,29,4  months10 1X D,2/4/2011,Singulair
363, 1, Asthma & constant resp infections,Agression_ screaming_ tongue twitch_,My gorgeous kind hearted little boy turned into a monster within a day of having this horrid drug. We were warned about possible side effects but that they were highly unlikely & I was so keen to just get him well I foolishly gave him the chewable medication. As of the next day he started screaming uncontrollably_ hitting his siblings_ throwing everything he could when couldn't get on way_ throwing things at our dog_ being completely defiant and totally out of character. In last two days keeps sticking his tongue out and twitching it constantly which he has never ever done before. Have probably only ever had to put him in time out a handful of times in past but this week he has spent nearly all of his days being sent to time out. He even bought me to tears today as he tried to hit me which has never happened before. Thank goodness i found this site. No more singulair for him and I feel so terrible for thinking the worst of him when now I KNOW it's the drug and not him that made him act like that_ and feel worse still that I let him take it!

366, 1, Chronic Rhinitis_ Asthma,Anxiety_ depression_ loss of control_ leg pain_ etc.,"I had no idea when we started our daughter on this drug several years ago that it had the impact that it did.  My daughter has had many lung/nasal issues her whole life and started Singulair in combo with other drugs when she was about 3.  When she was 5 her teacher mentioned that she seemed to ""zone out"" often.  In 1st grade her anxiety ramped up and she was caught poking herself in the arm with a pencil.  This is when we started her in counseling.  We stopped Singulair in the summer between 1st and 2nd grade because we thought she didn't need it anymore.  She flourished in 2nd grade and we thought it was due to the counseling.  This spring we started her back on Singulair for her nasal issues and by the end of the summer we noticed that her behavior had regressed.  She was anxious_ kept saying that her brain was telling her what to do_ several OCD-like actions that she couldn't stop_ she felt ""weird""_ unable to cope with small annoyances.  Her counselor and I were perplexed.  At a recent appt with doc for refill of Singulair she mentioned the side effects.  I was appalled!  It all started to make sense.  We stopped the drug that night and she has been slowly improving.  The major impact has been on her anxiety.  She is so much calmer and happier.

370, 2, exercise induced asthma,anxiety_ panic attacks_ nightmares,My 7 year old was prescribed Singulair during soccer season in fall.  His environmental allergies and running cause asthmatic symptoms.  After just a few days_ he was like normal. He could run and be outdoors with all of his normal triggers with no reaction. This medicine does work_ no doubt. But after about 3 weeks on the medicine_ he confided that he had been feeling wierd at least once a day and couldn't make it stop.  Upon further questioning_ I realized he was experiencing panic attacks.  He described that he felt like things were happening that weren't really happening_ so I believe he was also hallucinating_ or this could have been part of the panic attack symptoms.  Lastly_ he mentioned that he had some horrible nightmares about monsters recently. Knowing there are some serious psychological side-effects_ we stopped the medication and anxiety and nightmares never occured again.  If you do put your child on this_ I would suggest asking them daily if they are feeling ok_ as they may not realize things they are experiencing are abnormal or they may be embarrased to talk about it.,M,7,1  months 1X D,1/25/2011,Singulair

405, 1, Asthma and allergies,Nightmares_ severe anxiety_ severe social anxiety_ insomnia_ severe depression_ and agitation,Im a Registered Nurse.  When I first started taking Singulair_ I looked up the medication information in my nursing drug guide and in my nursing textbooks.  Back then there were no warnings about any adverse effects such as depression or anxiety regarding Singulair.  I figured it would be safe to take.  This has been the worse year and a half of my life.  Less than eight weeks after I started taking Singulair_ I fell into a deep depression that lasted about four to five weeks.  I have underlying issues with anxiety; the Singulair just multiplied my anxiety by a hundred.  My anxiety has never been this bad.  I started to have severe anxiety attacks and severe social anxiety at work.  The anxiety worsened over time as my thoughts became more negative.  I started having anxiety and panic attacks around loved ones.  I started to see a therapist_ but that didnt help at all.  I had to start seeing a psychiatrist; this helped only a little.  The psychiatrist prescribed an antidepressant and a benzodiazepine.  These medications helped slightly.  I notified my primary care doctor and had labs drawn.  Everything was normal physically.

Last night was a complete meltdown over every single thing that could have possibly been a minor annoyance_ such as not being able to squeeze enough toothpaste out of the tube_ which culminated in a 30-minute screaming and crying bonanza.  She said to me last night that she is ""just not happy"" and that she doesn't know why.  I was reading stories to her tonight_ and she must have popped her jaw open at least 40 times over the course of two books (mouth open wide like a yawn in fast-forward).  I was keeping an eye on her_ and a few times I asked her why she kept doing that and she said she didn't know_ and she thought maybe her mouth was ""itchy"" - I said ""baby_ that's just not normal behavior"" and she said ""I KNOW!!! But I can't stop_ mommy!""  The moodiness and crying have become progressively worse over the past few months_ but the facial tic for the past month is the final straw for me and confirms my suspicions about the other behavior - I stopped giving Singulair to her today.  UPDATE 12/06/2010: The facial tic that my daughter had for about one month disappeared three days after discontinuation of Singulair_ and her anxiety and other mood disorders slowly faded away shortly thereafter.

He was rude and defiant at home_ but at first we chocked it up to the ""terrible twos"".  Once he began attending daycare(2 years old)_ though_ his behavior got WORSE.  He would hit and push the other children_ outright defy the staff_ and would NOT follow directions/rules_ no matter WHAT the consequences were(time out_ mom called_ etc).  Last year he started attending Pre-K and the behavior continued_ but the staff was NOT going to take it(they didn't have to_ private school).  he would NOT sit still_ would not finish work_ and the violent behavior continued.  Since it really wasn't helping his asthma_ since it isn't allergy-related_ we chose to take him off it and see what happened.  Well_ it took a couple of weeks_ but he's now like a DIFFERENT child!",My son now(1 year later)_ is exceeding most_ if not all expectations at school(kindergarten)_ well behaved at home_ and actually will sit and read books with an adult and not be racing around the room.  Even his pre-K teacher_ who we went back to visit_ could NOT believe he's the same child!  I am SO glad we took him off it_ we will NEVER go back.

I felt like I was reading my son's story over and over again.  He became very aggressive and defiant.  He became very anxious about random things.  He would obsess about things.  He began doing things that were off-the-wall and mean_ and when I asked him why_ the answer was always_ ""I don't know.""  He began repeating himself constantly - both in a stutter-like manner (repeating the same part of a sentence over and over and over) and also repetitive if I didn't respond to him immediately(which really annoyed me).  He never seemed happy...always brooding_ even when getting his way_ things weren't right.  This may sound ridiculous_ but in one day_ he is 100% better.  His teachers said_ ""He was a completely different child.  He got along with everyone_ was helpful_ happy and patient...""  Since we've been home_ I have not had to ask him more than one time to do something (which I have had to do more times than I can count...it would usually take me asking 5-7 times and getting pretty angry to get him to do something).  He has been relaxed and happy.  He has not gotten upset for no reason.  He has not repeated himself (in any fashion) one time.

As for the insomnia_ I'll definately take not sleeping through the night over felling like I am being suffocated.

In November_ I posted here and wanted to update: I took my daughter off of this medication_ and slowly her behaviors changed. She is now back to her normal self. While the Dr. hadn't warned me of any side effects when she prescribed this_ when I told her I was taking her off meds_ she acknowleged it could be the problem.

Months later it was a ""funny breathing"" as though it was an astma attack.  Now over the last week_ he started this involuntary turning of the neck and head and stretching of the eyes. Said it made his eyes feel better.  Took him to an eye doc for exam_ everything was fine.  Took him to his pediatrician who again wrote it off as a nervous tic.  I stopped the meds myself and two days after stopping the head turning and stretching of the eyes stopped.  His whole demeaner has changed.  I have contacted the USFDA and reported the side effects that he experienced noting that I had seen this forum.

452, 1, Seasonal asthma,Mood swings_ lower frustration tolerance_ easily saddened_ throat clearing_ humming_ eye rolling_ head turning,"We started our 4 1/2 year old son on Singulair per pedatrician suggestion due to seasonal asthma. Previously we treated him with a nebulizer (zoponex/pulmicort) as needed. Our pediatrician suggested Singulair as a daily remedy so we started him on it once the school year ended (first week of June). During the first two weeks we noticed some behavioral changes (easily frustrated_ VERY emotional_ intense play) as well as sporadic humming_ mostly while he would be engaged in watching TV. When we would ask him why he was doing that he would say ""I don't know; it makes me feel better"". This then led to a persistant throat clearing the following week and now_ out of the blue_ he has started repetitively turning his head as if he is looking at something next to/behind him. This is now happening in a wide range of environments (watching TV_ playing_ walking_ during conversations). He says it ""makes his eyes feel better"". Once the head turning began_ and we looked at how these symptoms had developed_ we determined that this could have something to do with the Singulair so we immediately took him off. It has been over a week now and he continues to repetitively turn his head_ sometimes as many as 15-20 times a minute. Needless to say we are a bit concerned and are hoping that this decreases over time since these behaviors seem to result from his 3 week Singulair trial.

473, 3, seasonal allergies,First year: Singulair with Nasonex - no notable side effects (6 month period). Second year: Singulair with Flonase generic - in 4th month of use I started waking up with feelings of depression that would not linger after I was awake. I can not be sure that the depression was caused by Singulair. I weaned myself off Singulair in a week and continued taking Flonase generic. A week later I noticed that my mental capacity had improved. While on Singulair I had difficulty in the evening getting motivated mentally to do anything_ and also found it difficult to concentrate on complex tasks (computer programmer). The week after getting off Singulair I noticed a significant change. My mental capacity returned to normal (in the evenings: ability to focus on complex tasks_ motivated to perform problem-solving tasks).,This is the second year I have been on Singulair. I wuuld start in February and take it til around August/September to treat tree and grass allergies. The first year I started in late March_ but did not notice any side effects; I also used Nasonex; Singulair was not sufficient by itself to deal with my allergy symptoms. The second year I switched from Nasonex to a Flonase generic. Without Singulair and a steroid nose spray during my allergy season_ I was unable to concentrate during the day (fuzzy_ floating feeling from allergies_ sinus pressure_ etc)_ had to deal with sinus congestion_ occasional sinus infections_ frequent sore throat_ cough_ sneezing_ physical fatigue_ aches throughout body_ and difficulty sleeping. Currently I am using the Flonase generic only. I still experience muscle aches throughout my body_ physical fatigue_ some sinus congestion_ and sore throat_ but have decided it is worth it to regain my ability to concentrate in the evening and feel motivated mentally throughout the day.

Within 2 weeks my asthma worsened. I was having more frequent attacks and my overall breathing went down hill. The more I tried to sleep_ the worse I felt. On top of that my moods began to change quickly and without much reason. There were multiple times I would snap and be verbally combative with my boyfriend with little or no prompting. Other times I suddenly felt very sad without being to pinpoint any reason and could not hold myself together. Crying bouts and inability to deal with fellow employees at my workplace sky rocketed. The mood swings and freakouts also contributed to more asthma attacks. Before taking Singular I had been aware that it had some negative side-effects in children. I had no clue that adults had also had problems with it.I have no doubt this medication works well for some people. According to the labeling most people can take this medicine and reap the benefits without negative side effects. For those of us that it does NOT help_ it's a very serious matter.

He has been off for a month now and although the twitches has subsided they are still very-much-sothere. I plan to leave an update with hopes that I can help someone else out becuase I am claiming the victory over this medicine. To see my son go thru this has caused a major depression for me and has affected everything that I am involved in.

The hallucinations he experienced while on it kept him from sleeping in his own room for FOUR months_ and we actually had to switch his room to a different room_ completely redo the paint_ covers_ furniture_ everything. It was a NIGHTMARE. Finally_ four months later_ he is returning to his old self. We actually have switched pediatricians because she again prescribed Nasonex after knowing everything we went through with Singulair...sure enough_ the side effects are the same.Parents_ please take caution.

She started Keppra for seizures.  Well_ not many of the problems went away. So_I was told that some pts with seizures has mood disorders. We have been trying different medications that are for seizures and mood disorders.So far nothing has helped.Instead of starting another seizure medication that has tons more side effects than Keppra (that has worked well) I decided to look at the side effects of her allergy medication.This was the first site I came to and I feel terrible.

This was very unlike my son considering that he never had any type of ""accidents"" since he was potty trained at two years old.  My son's teacher also described my son's inability to concentrate and almost an unwillingness to do his work.  The potty ""accidents"" continued at home with almost a daily occurence.  I began noticing a change in his level of moodiness and aggression.  Unhappy with a conversation I was having about him with his grandfather_ my son hit me with a plastic toy bat.  What was alarming was the action_ not necessarily the force.  The straw that broke the camels back was when he was caught sleep walking.  He ended up in my kitchen_ removed his shorts and underpants and urinated on my dining room chair and kitchen floor.  He was completely unaware of the incident when he woke up later that morning.  It wasn't until I connected these changes to the onset of putting my son on this medication.  I passed along my concerns to his pediatrician who merely dismissed it as a change in his diet and now having a sleep walker on our hands.

I was suddenly extremely irritable_ prone to aggressive outbursts_ chronically depressed_ developed severe insomnia_ developed a severe anxiety disorder accompanied by massive and frequent (3-6 times per day) panic attacks_ began to fall asleep and hallucinate during daily activities_ catatonic episodes_ experienced horrible nightmares and perhaps most annoying of all_ I experienced uncontrollable and unceasing tremors and 'ticks'. After 1 year on Singulair I attempted to commit suicide_ 6 months later I attempted again_ and again 2 years later. When I was 18 my doctor took me off of Singulair because my asthma had seemed to improve_ one year later she put me back on it because of chronic ear infections. That one year that I was off,I have taken myself off of singulair again_ after happening to review a patient information handout at work one day (I am a pharmacy technician). I have been off of it for a week now and already I am beginning to see beauty in the world again and feeling more confident in myself. I feel as if being on singulair has ruined my life. My whole adolescence was consumed by this drug_ and I was coming close to trying to kill myself again_ before I took myself off of it. This drug has taken away time and ruined relationships that I will never get back. I am writing this note on here in hopes that patients and parents consider very carefully the side effects of this medication and the implications that it carries with them. Yes_ it got me off of my inhaler_ but I paid a heavy price for that convenience.,F,20,6  years,1/25/2010Email,Singulair

I hada infection and went on this instead and I honestly can't say anything bad about it yet.

536, 1, asthma; wheezing_ night cough,Nightmares.,I gave my son one pill.  After he went to bed I searched for side effects.  I saw all the terrible reviews and hoped for the best.  I won't put him on steriods because he is very small for his age and I don't want his growth delayed.  He woke up with nightmares all night.  He whimpered and shook as he lay beside me sleeping.   My heart broke.  I'm so glad I knew this was a side effect so I could immediately stop giving it to him.  We're looking into alternative treatment (traditional chinese medicine).,F,32,1  days,1/22/2010,Singulair
537, 1, Chronic nighttime asthma,For the entire 9 months that our 4 year old daughter was on Singulair_ her asthma symptoms completely disappeared - BUT - she experienced constant nightmares_ almost every night.  I put it down to 'a phase' until I realised that it was associated with Singulair. I feel dreadful as a mother for taking so long to realise that my daughter's nightmares_ which really distressed her_ were caused by the medication.  We recently reduced her dose and then increased it again - as soon as we increased it she started wetting her bed every night.  I will never ever give her this medication again.  I think there should be a thorough investigation into this medication.,,F,34,9  months,1/21/2010,Singulair
538, 1, Asthma,My son has been taking Singulair for a year and a half. Initially_ I didn't notice any changes_ but over the past several months_ he had developed a habit cough and has gradually taken on strange eye tics. Kids have started noticing at school. He also seems to be a little on edge and not the happy go lucky kid I know.  I took him for his annual pediatrician appointment to discuss the tics and he suggested I look at the Singular that the allergist had prescribed. I am taking him off it immediately and I feel that this drug is a horrible poison.

Last week when I found this sight I cried. All this time it was the singulair and not one doctor attributed my sons change in behavior to  this horrible drug. Now that we have stopped it some of the aggression_ depression_ agitation_ and tantrums are improving...I hope with time we get our son back completely and that the terrible side effects we have experienced go away. My poor son is only 6 years old and has been thru hell because of this med. I am sure many patients do fine on this medication but it isn't for everyone.

541, 4, Asthma/Allergies,None when on the medicine.If I take a break for even a day or two it affects my mood.  I get highly aggressive_ cry for no reason_ and even have what I would call severe depression.,It works great and helps_ but I skipped a few days on purpose this last week to see if it still caused the same reaction.  After two days I was scaring myself with my thoughts so I went back on it.  I also take a lot of other allergy/asthma meds and this was the only variation in my routine.  I have not ever have thoughts or feelings like that before_ besides when I have missed doses of Singulair.  I tried talking to one of my doctors about it but they just advised me not to miss a dose.

544, 1, Allergies,Anger_ yelling_ frusration_ disrespectful communication with family_ exhaustion_ lack of patience_ trantrums_ problems listening,"I originally asked my 7 year old's primary care physician for recommendations for sleep issues with my son.  My son has always been a perfectionist and easy to anger_ but he has a sensitive heart and always wants to please.  I thought his initial problems were due to sleep problems we had seen with his inability to sleep through the night.  He had chronic nasal conjestion.  He was put on Singular.  I was so happy with the results.  He no longer had the 24/7 goopy nose.  BUT 1 year later_ I have an 8 year old that can not control his temper_ we feel like we can no longer talk to him withour him going into a trantrum.  We have gotten to the point that we feel like we are yelling at him all the time and he responds unreasonably to us or anyone. It was not until my neighbor took her son off singulair and said she notice he calmed done_ that I began to tie the Singular to my somes worsening problem.  I had just scheduled a meeting with his physician to talk about possible behavioral problems when I googled 'Singulair"" side effects and found this page.  I am so releived.  I hope this will give us back our son and help him to gain control of his emotions.  I know he is a smart_ caring son in side this poor child.

At 1st we thought maybe its just the terrible 2's everyone keeps talking about_ so we did more research on behavior/discipline_ but quickly realized this was way beyond a phase and was only getting worse. We finally made the connection to the medication and took him off it.  Too little too late though_ he was ultimately kicked out of daycare because of his aggression.  He has been off of the meds for 3 weeks now and we are going through the ""detox"" phase.

It has worked for his asthma but we have seen a sweet happy little boy turn into a monster!  The changes did not happen right away but slowly.  After his dosage was increased when he turned six things have escalated.  He has been a crazy child since starting kindergarten.  He is now in the care of a child psychologist_ child psychiatrist and a team at his school.  He has been suspended for his behavior and kicked out of his after school program.  He started meds for ADHD 3 weeks ago with little improvement in his behavior.  Like many other parents I have asked the doctors can it be the Singulair and they all say oh no way!  After talking with a pharmacist who told me of the horrible side effects - which by the way are not listed on the drug companies web site - I have chosen to stop the Singulair.  I pray that it is the cause and that I will get by sweet loving little boy back.  Something should be done about this and everyone should complain LOUDLY to the drug company!  If it turns out that our world has been turned upside down by this and hundreds of dollars spent on our son's mental health issues someone sure will hear from me!!!!!!!!!,M,6,11  months,12/17/2009Email,Singulair

She cries when happy_ sad_ scared for just about anything at all.  Always intermittently_ never consistently.  When you ask her why_ all she can say is I can't help it.

It took a few months just to get back to baseline.,Allergist's recommendation was to continue taking Singulair and to begin using a combination inhaler.  I decided against that advice as I am afraid of inhalers; also I believed that following his advice would take me down the wrong path (more meds_ and thereby more side effects & interactions).  I've been waiting for appt w/new allergist who uses sublingual allergy meds--supposedly less problematic.

We attributed this to benefits of after school activities.  Then she slept all of the time.  Everyone tried to tell me she was just growing.  She began eating only half of what she did before.  Then_ she would suddenly start crying and running around saying ""I don't know what I am supposed to do.  I can't think.  My little heart is beating so fast it's pounding."" Her focus on schoolwork declined and her behavior grades declined.  I could not imagine my 6 yr old suffering with a mental breakdown.

I discussed it with her doctor and stopped Singular immediately.  It is now listed under her drug allergies.  I would never give this to a child.  According to her doctor this medicine actually is in the same family as antidepressants.  There are multiple warnings about antidepressants in children.

She had been off for a couple of months and she started having an asthma attack so I put her back on singulair along with her other drugs she had already been on. It was during exam preparation and she was in LA LA Land! spaced out and unable to concentrate for weeks! I knew that she had trouble focusing_ remembering_ concentrating for years. I finally made arrangments to have her tested for ADD.Ironically I took her off the med and it was like someone turned the light back on!! Since then we have not gone back and I have a different kid!! no more bullying_ no more aches and pains_ no more concentration issues just a lovable_ sweet_ kind_ child that I once knew years ago.

571, 1, Chronic Cough,Hair Loss_ Rapid Weight Gain_ High Cholesterol_ Muscle Tension_ Rashes.,I came to this site to find out if my son's recent health issues were due to the RX he's taking.  It appears they are indeed the culprit. Our 20 yr old son developed a chronic cough in April 2007. Many meds were tried to relieve the cough.  Todate_ no meds have given him relief. For the past 18 months he has been on Singulair. For the past 12 months he's also been on Astelin and Nasacort. In the past year his total cholesterol reached 257 (up from the previous 180's)_ he's gained over 30 lbs (despite dieting)_ has had significant hair loss_ neck/jaw tension_ headaches and some hives. The mfg drug side effects sheet didn't list any of these items; however_ after reading previous comments I feel the meds he's currently on (particularly Singulair and Astelin may be the culprits.  We plan on having our son stop these meds immediately and revisit his allergist for a consult. We are now considering acupunture and a holistic medicine to his chronic cough.  The medical profession has failed him terribly.,F,60,18  months,11/14/2009Email,Singulair
572, 1, Asthma/allergies,Bedwetting_ hand numbness,"Was prescribed for my 4 1/2 year old daughter for seasonal allergies when her Xyzal and Nasonex weren't doing enough for her and she started to have worsening nasal congestion_ continuous post-nasal cough.  She has NEVER had problems with bedwetting since she was completely pottied trained at 28 months. 2 times this week since starting Singulair she has wet the bed at night even though she was still alert enough to wake up last night one time to void.  She also keeps intermittently saying ""my hands feel tired"" which she has never complained of in the past.  I think this is probably the way a 4 year old complains of hand numbness. I haven't noticed any significant change to her breathing problems compared to last year prior to starting Singulair.  She is getting better but no faster than last year when we only used the Xyzal_ Nasonex_ Orapred_ Xopenex.  Am taking her off Singulair today and will not use it again.

574, 1, coughing asthma,Prescribed by pediatrician for our 7 year old daughter.  Daily intense headaches which were dismissed as not related to the medication by our doctor - although they started a month or so after going on the medication..  Went as far as getting a CT scan because of the duration_ frequency and intensity of the headaches.  Additional side effects of occasional fever_ dizziness and irritability.  We are stopping the use of this drug immediately.  The published side effects are alarming - should've done more research before taking the doctors advice on this one.  No doubt we will be more careful in the future.,,F,7,3  months,11/10/2009,Singulair

579, 1, allergies,rage_ suicidal/homicidal thoughts_ mood swings_ loss of concentration_ hyperactivity,"My 6-year old son was prescribed singulair for allergies. On the third day of taking this drug_ he became an emotional wreck. He was so hyper_ seemed out of control of his body - literally bouncing off the walls. Grandparents and friends even noticed the change. He became extremely frustrated because he could not concentrate on any task_ game_ etc. Very unlike him. THEN he started talking about wanting to kill people_ and himself. I was beyond shocked and scared. At first_ I didn't even think of contributing it to Singulair_ until I started researching side effects. I was outraged. I took him off of it immediately and he was back to himself within 24-48 hours. A week after this experience_ I received some health alert email about the psychotic reaction dangers of singulair to children. It is terrible to think of a ""simple"" allergy med causing such a scary and life-threatening reaction. I warn everyone I know with kids_ just in case_ and one of my friends' sons is experiencing similar problems.",F,35,3  days,11/5/2009,Singulair

It did seemed to help his allergies_ but at the same time his personality changed drastically. At first I thought he was going through a phase. He became a different child. very difficult to deal with. I feel so guilty about getting angry at him for his behavior while on this drug.  I finally made the correlation and took him off of it.  After the drug got out of his system_ he was back to his usual sweet self (both times). I hate the fact that I was punishing my child for his behavior when it was my fault for giving him this poison. Be careful giving this to your child and watch out for the side effects. It may work for some_ but it seems like it has a bad effect on others. It is sad with the kids because they can't communicate how they feel like and adult can. What good is a medication if it makes you unable to function.,M,4,2  months,10/25/2009,Singulair
583, 1, allergies,insomnia_ fits of crying_ seperation anxiety_ irritability,I take this medication myself and it has been a miricle drug for my lifelong asthma and allergies.  However I noticed side effects in myself of depression and fatigue.  I have tried to give it to my son two different times as prescribed by the ENT doc.  Each of the intervals I've tried it he gets the listed side effects. I just got very angry because my son will not stay asleep. It is absolutley awful and has really alerted me that my seasonal depression could be intensified by this drug.  If it affects him so dramatically then it could be the reason I have been so depressed for years. I went on the computer for support.  I will not be giving him singulair EVER again.  I'm going to go hold my little boy now.  I feel so bad that I tried to give him this drug again.  Doctors are really blind as to the side effects of this drug.  It is not such a miracle drug to me now.,M,2,5  days,10/25/2009,Singulair

He began taking Singulair about 4 or 5 months ago when our ENT suggested that he had his adnoids removed and I decided to take him back to the pediatrician to discuss it first. After reading all of the comments posted_ I am beginning to wonder if all of my son's behavior that my husband and I have noted in the past few months is attributed to it or to something else.  I am going to stop giving him Singulair for 2 weeks to see if his behavior changes.  I hope that is long enough to get it out of his system.

This was very unlike him_ so this site we found made us wonder.  His doctor agreed to have him stop Singulair to see if that was the culprit.

After several painful months of trying to figure out what was going on and how to help him cope. We FINALLY got him to a place where he could control his behavior_ emotions_ and just be a happy kid. Then he was diagnossed with Asthma and was put on singulair... Now we are seeing extreme rage and anger in him once again. The only changes was by adding this medicine. The psychiatrist and pharmacist both said adding this medicine to the two he is already taking should not have any effects on him. If they only lived in my house??

588, 1, allergy induced asthma/sinusitis,intense_ unexplained depression; rages.,"My daughter was put on this from 4-5.5 yrs with significant behavior changes resulting in many sessions on willful children and behavior modification. We did not like our own child and were concerned about a total lack of empathy for others.  We attributed her dramatic improvement to a sweet_ even tempered child to entering kindergarten.  In hindsight_ the improvement actually began when we discontinued singulair during the summer.We put her back on singulair when she was 8 and noticed a return to the same out of control_ raging behavior.  She sat in her room and sobbed uncontrollably_ scaring us and herself because she had no reason for feeling so incredibly sad.  After 2 weeks we discontinued and noticed an immediate return to normal within 48 hours.  I am so angry that every doctor we saw denied that this drug caused any side effects!!  The drug was said to be ""benign"" and absolutely ""free of emotional lability issues.""  This should be  given with specific pre-warnings and advice for careful observation.  It is a useful drug for severe_ uncontrolled asthmatics_ but has no place in a physicians list of approved meds for average sinusitis_ allergies_ or managed asthma in children of any age.

Her father took her to the ENT do to the coughing coming back and she said her ears itched again which normaly happen when a tube falls out and the ear fills with fluid again_ but the doc said it looked fine but said she seemed to have allergies still causeing the cough he said to put her in Singular_ after a couple of days I noticed her mood change_ at first we thought it was do to number one the age and number two the divorce_ but when she started crying over everything we thought she might be getting sick.

591, 4, Allergies Asthma,Wow. This has been an eye opener. I came to this site for another medication_ but I think I've finally put this together. My 3 1/2 year old has been very aggressive. In fact_ got in trouble today at sunday school for starting a fight with a child. He has also been hyper_ unusually loud_ and has screaming fits. However_ a few weeks ago we traveled home to Chicago. We were out of our routine_ and I kept forgetting to give him his daily dose of singulair. I noticed that my child was so well mannered_ calm_ and tried to assist his younger cousin whenever she would have an emotional meltdown. I thought_ wow_ he's growing up and maturing. Not so. When I returned home_ we returned to our usual one dose in the morning of singulair_ and he was back to his very difficult self -- constnatly wanting my attention_ getting upset at the drop of a hat_ difficult sleeping. I think I may have found the culprit. I'm going to keep him off for a week and see if there's a noticeable difference.,The med works for keeping his allergies and asthma at bay_ but the emotional side effects are far too demanding on a child -- if not the entire household.,M,3.5,4  months,9/20/2009,Singulair

594, 1, Seasonal Allergies,Severe Depression and Agression,My son was on this medication for six months before I finally made the connection between the drug and his behavior change.  He became very depressed_ nearly suicidal_ often telling us that he wished he had never been born_ wanted us to kill him_ and that he didn't want to live anymore.  He was also very aggressive toward his younger siblings.  All of these behaviors were way out of character for him--typically a very compassionate and joyful individual.  Within two weeks of being off the drug we had our normal_ happy_ loving boy back.  NEVER EVER_ EVER give this drug to a child.  When I related our experience to the allergist he was not surprised_ has seen it before (argh!) and said that my son can't take Singulair_ Zyrtec (He had similar results with Zyrtec)_ or Claritin.

At about age 4 she started having headaches_ sore throats_ neck pain_ leg pain_ stomach aches and nightmares.,I have had her in the doctors office several times over the last year for these symptoms and never got any answers or indications that the singulair might be causing these symptoms.

Later on_ though_ I started having suicidal thoughts and depression_ and I was really worried about myself. I would cry a lot and refuse to go to school_ and I had a lot of trouble focusing. The side effect of depression and suicidal thoughts with Singular was not yet announced_ and my parents couldn't figure out why I was acting this way. Dismissing it as the recent death of a family dog_ I went off Singular about 4 months later because I was switching to a day and night ashtma preventative called Advair. The changes in my behavior were apparant_ however_ we just thought I was finally accepting the death of a pet and moving on. A couple of years later it came on the news about how Singular caused suicidal thoughts and there were already 4 people who were on Singular that had commit suicide because of it.,It works_ but it's NOT worth the side affects.

Before taking Singulair I already had anxiety_ sleep problems_ and leg cramps; these things have not changed. My allergies are mostly controlled by Singulair_ having mild symptoms with incidental exposure (strong mold or grass smell) or at times such as when cedar or grass pollen is very high (requiring me to also take Nasonex).

Within days_ I was sleeping through the night and my allergy symptoms disappeared.  It was like I never had asthma.,A few months later_ I started having panic attacks in ramdom places where I was not under stress.  My dreams and nightmares became more vivid and pretty distressing.

(At this point in my life_ I had a good job_ was going back to school partime_ and had the most wonderful boyfriend.  There was no reason for me to be unhappy)  I had enough sense to realize that this behavior was unlike me and then found this site and saw that I was not crazy.  I went off the pill and all of the side effects went away in 2 weeks.  I took it once after having an asthma attack and had a panic attack within an hour.  That was all the validation I needed.  I've been off of it half a year and am back to normal except for my sex drive.  I hope it comes back.  Did anyone else have problems with their libido?

I just thought it was part of him and we all accepted it. At 6 the Dr. put him on 6 mg singular chewables. I would have never known about this if it hadn't been for me taking him to the dr for his constant itching and rashes and the Dr. suggested we see an allergist. We went to the allergist and they did all the stick tests and found his allergies and then told me to keep him on the singular 6 mg. and he prescribed zyrtec and flonase.  After taking 2 days along with the singular 6 mg he was already taking he begain to ta,Please don't give your child this medication_ the side effects are really scary and children are suppose to be children not little zombies.

He made comments of hating himself_ and wanting to die.  He would say he felt blah blah.  He said I will just kill myself right now.  It has been such a scary time for us.  He was seen by the school counselor and I was getting ready to seek aditional counseling services.  I was really afraid that my child was becomming mentally ill.  As summer approached I took my son off of singulair.   Then all of a sudden my child was back to his happy self.

627, 1, For daughter's sensitive airway/lun,Daughter age 4 years old_ was on Singulair for 3 months to prevent onset of asthma and to strenghten her lungs.  She experienced nightmares and aggressive/weird behaviour throughout the period.  She would wake up screaming in the night_ and then walk out of the room and sat on the floor in the hallway. Some nights she would choose to sleep on the floor and nothing can persuade her to go back to the bed.  In the daytime_ she was hitting her granny_ the nanny_ her father and also hurting herself if she couldn't get her way.  She would throw herself on the floor in fits of anger.,No child should be made to suffer like this.  The drug should be recalled.

I was very leary of him taking any med's long term and asked repeatedly about possible side effects.  I was told by 2 doc's that there really weren't any that they were aware of.  I called a week after he began taking it because he was having horrible nightmares.  I read the package insert and it said something about nightmares.  Both doc's said they would only last a week or so.  They did seem to go away and his allergies and asthma were under control so we continued to take it.  After the reports of suicidal thoughts I called again and was told it was rare in children and to continue him on it.  He is now 10 and is very moody_ argumentative_ sad and seems to be having bad dreams again.  I asked if Singulair could cause these problems esp. in boys starting adolescence and was told no.

We usually make a trip to Emergency in the fall and in the spring. One of those visits usually involves a stay for 3 to 4 days. He just broke out into a rash the last 2 days. It is only on his skin that appears to be exposed to the sun. It looks like a sunburn_ but has bumps and blotches all over it. I have given him benadryl and it is gone in the morning_ but comes back when he comes home from school. No other symptoms seem to be present. He is still a very sweet_ quiet and loving boy. No mood swings_ but after reading all of these comments_ I am somewhat concerned. He has a wet cough right now and has had it for the last week_ but the stuffy_ drippy nose is gone. We have an appointment to see a child allergist in a couple of weeks and I will ask him what his thoughts are on this topic_ but don't expect him to admit any connection. My experiences with doctors tell me,The insert with the medication does not mention anything about photosensitivity or sun exposure. That is the only thing that seems to make sense. We have only had some good sunny weather this past week and that is when the rash started.,M,10,6  weeks,6/4/2009,Singulair

My problems got really bad on Mother's Day and the next day when I had to leave work because of the nausea.  I finally realized that taking Singulair was the only real medication change I had made in the past month_ so I called my allergist to ask if the rash and nausea could be side effects.

After about two weeks the feeling of ""I need to go back on singulair"" would go away as well as the respiratory distress symptoms. It was like I was addicted to this drug and needed to keep taking it to stay healthy.

The anxiety and depression like moods would switch off_ where I could go from being running around anxious one second to sitting just wanting to be by myself the next. This year I'm now 15_ and so the dosage was upped to 10mg. I didn't know this_ and so I started taking it again hoping there would be no side effects.

He lives with me (biological father) and has little to do with bio mum for her own personal reasons and hasn't since he was 3 and I had not noticed any major affects of this. Yes environmental factors do tend to do this to kids however since he started taking Singulair he changed completely and he was not the child I knew. I took him off it after reading this site and he has gone back to his ""normal"" self. He no longer suffers from anxiety.

Stumbling across this website_ I asked her Pediatrician about the side effects (he stated none were proven). Against the doctors instruction_ we decided to take her off Singulair.  We changed our environment as well (taking all carpet from our home and replacing with hardwood throughout and adding a hepa filtration system).  With these changes my daughters asthma remains to be controlled (next step is to take her off the steroid inhaler and have her med. free).   The best part is; her mood has become much better_ her grades in school increased from a ""C"" average to an ""A"" average.  She now loves to read_ she is more of a peaceful child and she is happier.  Sure it cost us to upgrade/improve our environment (in which we needed a loan) but it was worth the money spent to see these improvements with our daughter.

I took it for 6 1/2 years. I stopped it when I read that Singulair had a black box_ that it may cause suicidal thoughts in children. I asked myself what it is doing to me. I had no idea. It has been a year since I stopped Singulair. The pain in the front of my thigh went away in 3 days; the tinnitus_ which I had noticed for about 6 months_ lessened in 6 months and then was gone; the insomnia improved immediately--I slept so well. The hand tremors I'd had since Sept_ 2005_ are much less_ and I only notice somettimes when I am tired. I noticed those when I would lift a fork to eat. I didn't realize I had the thoughts about death and that it wouldn't be so bad_ until I stopped the Singulair and the thoughts went away.  I would never take this drug again. I would never recommend it to anyone. Why does it have this effect on the brain? I tried a Flovent inhaler_ but I was allergic to the propellant_ according to my allergist. He placed me on Asmanex twisthaler_ which is a powder_ with no propellant. It has been a year and it has worked. No espisodes requiring prednisone. What a relief.

I don't want to think that I must live with either bad moods or breathing problems. This medicine has helped me with the later_ but I just can't be sure it's the cause of the depression as of late.

The first five or six years that I took this med I seemed to have no problems.  Gradually something changed. I couldn't sleep without horrible nightmares_ and I was too exhausted to get out of bed when awake. I would lie in bed almost paralyzed_ but my mind never_ever_ ever shut off. Exhaustion became so bad that I couldn't carry a laundry basket upstairs without having to stop three times and lie down for a few hours afterward.  I finally wound up hospitalized for a week so they could drug me to sleep. I didn't take it in the hospital and got a bit better. I went home I started taking this_ along with other allergy drugs_ again_ because my doc thought it was such a benign wonder drug. My symptoms all returned and I struggled for months. I had tons of tests at several different specialists to try to figure out the cause_ but all was normal. I was in such a bad state after a year_ desperate_ I eliminated all pills_ one by one. This pill was the last thing to go_ because we thought it was the least likely to cause a problem.  I was off it and doing much better for about 2 years.  Just last week my allergies got really bad again_ so doc convinced me to give this another try. I agreed_ but only at a very low 2.5 mg dose to try it.

680, 2, Asthma,Mood and behavior changes_ dry mouth_ irritability,"Three doctors and a PA strongly advised us to put our 3 1/2 year old son on Singulair to help prevent the increasing problems he is having with asthma.  Because I have heard so many negative things about putting children on steroids like I have had to do with our son I decided to give it a try.  Within one day he began to have behavioral problems such as hyperactivity & irrational mood swings.  Within four days he had a terrible asthma attack and we are still in the process of trying to get him through the breathing problems.  His pediatrician has him on  Singulair_ a nebulizer_ and two steroids (one liquid_ one inhaled) I asked that at least one thing be eliminated since it seems like that's an awful lot of medication for a three year old.  We took him off the inhaled steroid and I am monitoring him closely to see what could be causing his wild behavior.  My suspicions have been that it is the Singulair and after finding this website I am now certain.  I am thankful to find that others had the same problem - when I asked my doctor_ I too got the response ""there are not side effects"" and ""it would be worse to take him off"".  My son is on the autism spectrum and already has many difficulties - he certainly doesn't need this on top of everything else.  Does anyone know of any other alternative solutions for children with asthma that doesn't require all these crazy medications?

If not for a very special pharmacist giving me warning about possible depression when refiling his Rx I think my son's life could have been altered forever without us even knowing why.  He has now been off for 2 weeks.  I have my son back.  His  energy level is back and he is smiling and happy with no other strange symptoms.

I wonder if some of the side-effects kids have are due to the nutrasweet_ which turns to wood alcohol and formaldehyde as it's digested.  I try to avoid it as much as possible_ but it is impossible as it's in everything.  Kids who get aspartame from other sources as well may be more likely to have more extreme side-effects. Or_ kids who are sensitive to aspartame are maybe more likely to have trouble with Singulair.  It's just an educated guess.  My son does well with nasacort.  I also have him inhale hot water with tea tree oil_ and put tea tree oil in the vaporizer when we use it.  I think we will continue trying to find a rotation with Singulair that gives the benefits w/o the side-effects.  Avoid Zyrtec--now that is a really evil drug!

She is having night terrors_ clingy_ cries from fear at bedtime will not let me out of her sight_also 1UTI.I have not slept in 3 weeks and the scary part is that it has been 3 weeks since she has had a dose. I found a post saying their son saw red stripes and yellow dots in one eye and it blew me away. That cannot be a coincidence.My child was happy and secure before she took singulair and now she is terrified and tormented daily by thoughts she cannot get out of her head. She says people are trying to kill her when she sleeps. She is now sleep deprived with dark circles under her eyes.

She kept getting up and bothering other children.  When I spoke to her she was freaking out that I was in the phone.  She knows how phones work and is very intellegent_ so I was very concerned.  I did not give her any Singulair tonight and will never again because of the research I had done. I wish I had done it before giving it to her.,F,3,7  days,10/29/2008,Singulair
758, 2, fall allergies,inconsolable crying spells_ violent tantrums_ extreme frustration,My 9 year old son was on it for 8 days and yesterday it was reported to me that he had a crying spell on the bus to school_ tantrums and crying spells in school_ then came home from school crying inconsolably and had several violent tantrums and was extremely irritable at home.  He has autism_ but never displayed this kind of behavior before.  I thought he might be coming down with something so I took him to the doctor today and was informed to immediately stop giving him the Singulair.  He was otherwise healthy.  Since he was only on it 8 days_ I'm hoping for him to have it out of his system in the next day or so and be back to what our 'normal' is.

759, 1, Asthma,Out of character violent tantrums and behavior_ difficulty sleeping_ strange statements_ talk of nightmares_ spacing out.....,My 3 year old was prescribed and started this two weeks ago.  Gradually it was like she underwent a personality change.  My previously loving_ caring_ funny little girl became quick to anger and lash out and became very needy.  I have taken her off it since finding these reviews yesterday and can already see a difference in her behaviour.  I was at the end of my reason with trying to cope with her prolongoned outbursts and tantrums_ and was actually a little bit afraid that she would hurt her younger sibling.  She slept better last night than she has for two weeks_ and I feel like my little girl has come back to me again today.  She's back to her old self_ and any bad behaviour (not that there's been much) was easy to circumvent!  I can't believe they give this to anyone_ never mind kids.,F,38,14  days,10/27/2008,Singulair
760, 4, hayfever and hives,None that I noticed; only used it for one month.,I am a Registered Nurse_ and this worked great for both my hayfever and hives (autoimmune); I only used it for a short time. Recently I considered asking for it again in place of Atarax (generic name is hydroxizine and it's very cheap) until I read the reviews on Singulair. I have a history of anxiety disorder and am surprised it was prescribed to me in the first place. Also I have a 5 y/o neice who has severe food allergies and behavioral problems; she takes Singulair. I am going to propose she try a drug holiday for her to see if it is in fact attributed to Singulair. For those who cannot tolerate Singulair I suggest you discuss Atarax with your physician as a potential alternative. Though it does not act on leukotrienes_ it is very effective with sedating properties that decrease within a month or less [for most people]. I have been on as much as 200mg Atarax per day_ starting dose for adults is normally 25mg.,F,33,1  months,10/24/2008,Singulair

The anxiety was exhausting.  I also got pnuemonia for 1 month_ which was the first time.  Not sure if Singulair caused it.  Other thing is when I would wash my face_ sometimes my pores would bleed for no apparent reason.  I also started to have a cough.  I stopped taking the med and these things cleared up.

Doctor stated that if the combination of medicines prescribed (Singulair_ Nasonex_ and Cefdinir ) did not significantly improve his symptoms within 2-3 weeks_ our next option would be to remove the adenoids.  While the medicines seemed to ""miraculously"" cure the eternally runny nose and cough (in just 2 days!) and grant my son his first sound night of sleep in months_ the associated side effects have been so scary that we have not given him the medicine in the last two days.  During the first week (after about 2 days on the medicines)_ he would cry that he wanted to ""sleep in Mama's bed"" and we sometimes gave in and allowed him to do so_ as a result of his unconsolable crying.In the last week (days 7-14 of the medication) we have seen him go from a sweet_ independent little boy to an aggressive_ frightened_ uncontrollable child.

He also became afraid of the dark and wanted to sleep with the light on.  After 2-3 weeks I couldn't take the emotional rollercoaster anymore.  His mood would change so rapidly all I could think of was Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde at which point I remembered the news report that the FDA was investigating the connection between singulair and teen suicide.  I decided to check for other side effects too.  When I found this website it was like reading about my own son's erratic behavior.

She has progressively gotten sicker with time.  Not her asthma_ but with these crazy symptoms.  She was diagnosed with migraines at age 10.  For the last three years her quality of life has declined so that she has only had one or two good days a week.  She completely missed the last semester of the 11th grade and will have to repeat it.  Her symptoms have been: headaches (cluster_ migraine and mild)_ leg pain_ rapid heart rate_ chronic fatigue_ rash like psorasis on her elbows at times_ severe abdominal pain_ nausea and vomitting_ occasional nightmares_ foggy thinking_ hunger_ and reflux_ mood swings and abnormal periods.,She was recently diagnosied with sub-clinical hypothyroidism.  She has started on Sythroid and after a month has shown some improvement.  I took her off the singulair about 2 weeks ago after finding this site and reading about all these side effects.  I don't know if the singulair is the total culprit or not but_ I took her off of the Singulair to see.  It may have been what has caused the sub-clinical hypothyroidism also.  She has been on it for years and progressively gotten worse.  She has had mutliple GI tests that have turned up nothing but this could have been the reason all along.  We have been to about 14 Doctors total with the various symptoms including her Pediatrician_ Pediatric Gastrointestinal Specialist_ Neurologist and Allergist.  She has much improved over the last couple of weeks and is starting to act like a normal 17 year old.

I brought up the possibile connection to singulair to his Dr._ who said she didn't think Singulair was the problem because he'd always been active. We decided to ween him off 3/27 after a teacher noted anxiety; since then his behavior has improved radically. Not only is he more agreeable and calmer at home_ but at school the teachers tell me they are seeing him focus on tasks and take on challenges he wouldn't have considered even two weeks ago. Singulair brought his repeated colds under control_ but at a cost.,Singulair reduced his suseptibility to colds. Since birth he got many colds despite being breastfed. Nearly 2 years ago_ the colds got to where he wasn't over one when the next began. Finally_ 18-months ago_ Dr. said Singulair would reduce inflamation and give him time to heal and fight off colds. I resisted initially_ but eventually agreed because he was always sick. As his health improved_ he gradually became more anxious_ contrary and down on himself. I thought problems were school related. But now his behavior has dramatically improved in last month since we began weening him off singular -- preschool teachers who had noted anxiety (and didn't know about sing. change) told me wide-eyed last week that they had never seen him so well behaved and willing to work.

After 6 years of taking it_ I developed such extreme anxiety and panic disorder that I was convinced I was going crazy_ as schizophrenia runs in my family.  I had no control over my thoughts_ which were so scary and demented that it was virtually intolerable.  I had one suicide attempt year 6 of taking it.  Over the 7 years I became agoraphobic.  I didn't attribute my troubles to Singulair_ instead believing I was mentally ill.  My mom told me about the news reports and I discontinued Singulair.  My doctor said to give it 1 month to get out of my system.  By day 3_ I noticed extreme changes for the better.  It's day 11_ and I haven't felt this normal since before taking Singulair.

However_ the emotional side effects I experienced were horrible.  Within a month of taking it I noticed I started to become depressed and lethargic.  In December anxiety started.  I thought all of these emotional occurances were due to stress.  In January I became worse and started lashing out at family and friends.  February and March were the worst.  I became suicidal and as early as last week contemplated killing myself because I couldn't take it any more.  Thank god my friend heard the news reports about Singulair and called me immediately.

He was on it for about 2 months before we thought it could be related to the drug.  We took him off it and within 1-2 weeks he returned to the normal kid he was before and the nightmares went away as well.  The drug did work well for his allergies_ but the side effects are not even remotely worth it.  I'd rather deal with allergy symptoms then to see my kid goes through the side effects of this drug again.  This was a total nightmare.

It has helped her greatly_ and the symptoms return as soon as she stops the Singulair. I can't help thinking that many of these so called side effects that parents are seeing are merely behavior issues.

I take mine in the morning & I think that my sleep symptoms are rather minimal because of that. It says on the bottle to take at nite but my mom always said not to take any maintenance med when you go to sleep.  So I didnt.  I feel that it is a wonderdrug and really like it.,My ins covers it but for copay so it is a doable thing for me. I have NEVER taken any type of maintenance med!! I see on the receipt though that it would cost me about $4 per dose if I pay out of pocket. Dont know if its worth that!

A close friend advised that Singulair has several side-effects and to watch him carefully.  I did not recognize the side-effects until reading other postings on this board.  He is an active (and sometimes aggressive) little boy.  How do I know aggressive behavior is related to drug and not just part of his age?  He has hit_ bitten_ and pulled hair before_ but never has he had night terrors.  Regardless_ I am taking him off the drug and will immediately begin researching alternative medicine approaches...dietary changes_ etc.  I am so sorry for these other children who have suffered such severe side-effects for such a long time.

I was put off at the fact that someone said the only reason anyone would give this a 5 is because they work for the drug company. WELL_ I certainly do not. When first prescribed_ I was taking the chewable child dose (considering I was about 9) but eventually moved up to the adult 10mg dose. I've never noticed any side effect except drowsiness - which is why the bottle says to take at bedtime. It works wonderfully for me. I notice whenever I skip a night my asthma flares back up to usual symptoms and I have to take at least one dose of my inhaler. When I take it as prescribed I don't need my inhaler at ALL.

925, 4, asthma_ severe cough_ runny nose,My 6 yr.old daughter has been on this med.(child dose) for less than 30 days. Singulair has been terrific for her asthma and cough. She no longer coughs at night or wakes in the morning coughing up mucus to the point of vomiting. However_ after reading this web site I might have found the answers to some new troubles.  A couple of weeks ago she started having to use the bathroom constantly. A few nights ago she started waking every hour having to use the bathroom. This is not her. She has never had an accident nor woke at night to go to the bathroom. She has gained 3 pounds in 4 weeks without eating much at all. She is now having accidents at home and school and is up all night going to the bathroom. I took her to the doctor and she said probably a urinary infection-no worries. Nothing about side effects! Is anybody else seeing any increased urination with their child? The medicine works great for her asthma and cough but the side effects are to great to keep her on it.,I can't have her up all night going 'potty' and having acidents at school-she was so embarrased. I am going to take her off it tonight and hopefully see a difference within a night or two. The weight gain and bathroom issue are to much for her (and me) to deal with for the sake of no more coughing and runny nose. By the way_ the label on my daughters bottle states that it is for children ages 2-14. I rated the medicine a 4 because for the actual asthma and cough it works great but it has to many side effects for children. This medicine needs to be re-evaluated for kids.

Anyone reading this_ please tell your doctor about this.  FDA and Merck will not do anything.  The most immediate point of control is the doctor. If they fail to warn and there is damage to your child_ your legal remedy at first is the doctor.  Because of federal law preemption_ Merck has some protection....at first.

The constant drainage (how does the human body produce so much snot?)and sinus pressure is gone. Feel like new person but as of Nov. 12th_ have abdominal pain and diarrhea.  VERY unlike me.  Never know when a bout of cramping will result in a rush to find a bathroom.  My intestines are rolling and boiling.  Seems like anything I eat goes to liquid right away.  Since I am past the worst of my allergy season_ will stop taking Singulair and watch,As with anything_ be aware and extremely cautious.

Suddenly I realized that I was hardly sleeping and when I did sleep it was for short times. The constipation kept me feeling full and uncomfortable. I had leg cramps at night. I stopped taking it about a week ago and I am my normal self again. I sometimes wonder if a smaller dose (i.e. 5mg. a day) would be better for me.

I've been a programmer for 24 years. Today_ for the first time_ I felt like I wanted to quit. My wife thought that was very odd_ so I finally decided to google the new medications I am taking. I've been on Claritin-D for 13 years with little side effects. It finally stopped being very helpful_ so my dr. added Singulair and Flonase. I've taken Flonase before with Claritin-D with again little side effects. I added Singulair about 3 weeks ago and BAM! Instant depression and the other things I listed in side effects.

934, 2, severe rhinitis_ post nasal drip,RAPID WEIGHT GAIN_ bloated feeling_ lethargy_ loss of mental clarity_ mild or occasionally moderate depression and anxiety.,"Singulair was prescribed_ along with Nassonex (mometasone) to treat severe chronic rhinitis_ as an alternative to continual use of pseudephedrine.  Things went OK for the first three months_ after which I experienced an increase in lethargy_ moodiness/mild depression_ loss of concentration_ moderate anxiety_ muscular weakness_ and weight gain.  I did not notice much relief for the rhinitis (an issue because I cannot mouth-breathe_ and end up hypoxic) - in fact_ I had to go back to decongestant nasal sprays_ most especially at night_ and gained more relief from regular twice-daily use of a NeilMed nasal rinse than from SIngulair.  More recently_ I've had a constant feeling of being bloated_ especially in the hands and feet_ and mental ""fuzziness"" similar to that which many people experience with antihistamines.

I am 35 and have taken this med for approx. 3 months.  I am wondering if this nagging itch in the back of my throat (especially at night) and hair loss are symptoms that have been experienced by ADULTS. People_ doctors are people too!  They are humans.  You are capable of making your own decisions and doing your own research before giving your helpless child a medication.  They even make it easy for you!  They put it right in the side effects paperwork they give you when prescribed!  I digress again.  I like this medicine.

943, 5, asthma/allergies,Dry mouth initially - none since then.,Singulair has been a wonder drug for me.

I now only use my inhaler when exercizing_ and previously I was using it 6-8 times per day.  I do believe strongly that medications affect people differently (I was a zombie with Allegra and Zyrtec_ but not with Singulair)_ and so have no doubt that the low ratings of others on this site are valid.  I would take issue_ though_ with the person who claimed that the people who rate the drug a 5 must work for the manufacturer since why else would they be on this site: I came to this site because I googled whether Singulair and Claritin could be taken at the same time_ and after reading the responses_ felt I should add my own experiences.

This is the first time I've been in a doctor's office in years and I felt great going in_ just wanted to see if I could improve my riding and extend my season by getting treatment. They determined I did have EIB and rhinitis which he said could contribute to the problem (I haven't noticed any symptoms though). He gave me Proventil for immediately before strenuous exercise and Singulair to take every evening for the rhinitis. That night I took the Singulair and slept normal.

I have always used an Albuterol inhaler during the months of October and May but my doctor thought this would be a good drug for me along with my Zurtek.The first evening I took it I noticed a suprising difference in my breathing. It really opened me up and I no longer needed my inhaler.  It worked great if you can deal with being a zombie all day.  Unfortunately with two young children I cannot.  I stopped taking it and I'm back to using the Alberterol for the breathing issues.

After 2 rounds of antibiotics_ the dr prescribed singulair.  I honestly did not recognize that she was experiencing side effects from Singulair until now.  She has gained  almost 20 lbs since December_ which is strange since she hardly eats!!! That is what prompted me to look it up_ but I am sooo glad that i did because now I realize so many more!  She has changed from a very happy_ sunny child into a withdrawn_depressed child.  She is very sensitive about the slightest thing_ and says that no one ever wants to play with her_ even though her teacher says that she is the one that refuses to interect.

The next day I left a message with the doc and took him off of the med. Within 48 hours_ his fever went back down_ and then the doc called and said cold symptoms are unlikely and put him back on it. I gave him a dose_ and the very same night his fever went back up to 103.5. Then next day his pediatrician said take him completely off until he's well and then try again to see what happens. After reading the stuff on this site_ now I'm afraid to put him back on it. I also recall that the week he was taking it_ he had a night terror -- and he had never had one of those before.

968, 4, Asthma,Intolerence to any type of heat or humidity,I was diagnosed with asthma in December 2004.  Through out my childhood I always developed bronchitis on a yearly basis so this did not shock me.  My doctor is a lung specialist so I felt comfortable with his diagnosis.  He tried me for 2 weeks on Advair which did nothing for the feeling like a rock was sitting on my chest.  The next step was trying Singulair.  I noticed an immediate improvement.  No side affects at all.  Since 2004_ when I develop a cold_ it always turns into a lung infection which requires me to go on predisone temporarily.  One thing I have noticed since being on Singulair is that I have absolutely no tolerence for heat or humidity.  I immediately get clammy and sweaty and have almost passed out on occassion when I have to be outside in those conditions.  The only other medication that I am on is a 28 day birth control pill but have been assured by the pharmacist that there are no side affects between that and the Singulair.

I would sleep for 1.5 to 2 hours_ wake up_ then sleep again.  In the morning_ I almost couldn't get out of bed.  The head buzz was awful.  I have a permanent ringing in the ears but it was about triple the normal volume.  I took my pills in the evening.  The day after my second pill_ I eventually got enough strength to start exercising in an attempt to get the drug out of my system.  It pretty much worked.  It is now 2 days beyond that and I seem to be back to normal.  Unfortunately_ my rhinitis is coming back along with its attendant problems.  It's too bad because the Singulair actually removed all of my rhinitis for those 2-3 days.

But read on...I have been taking it for probably about 5 years now. I am a 27 year old female_ and my asthma doctor reports that the pulmicort and singulair are keeping my symptoms under control. However_ I decided three days ago to quit the singulair. The doctor said on my last visit that I could try it.Here's my experience. I have had some difficulty in waking up in the middle of the night. But I usually go to sleep okay. I feel really good_ though today_ my third or fourth day_ my chest feels heavier. I took a puff of my albuterol and the heaviness has subsided somewhat.As for the mood changes while I was on Singulair_ I agree that they are a very real possibility. I was often cranky and tired_ and I experience depressed moods_ would ruminate often. I did not feel this way prior to my college years.

Then the migranes. Needless to say_ this website has helped me to recognize some of the phantom symptoms which seemed so mysterious.

I was beginning to be short and hateful with my friends and family_ to be honest_ an absolute A$$hole to just about everyone.  My brother and friends even asked me what was wrong with me_ and I didn't know what to tell them.  It was like a constant heavy CLOUD over my disposition.  THANKFULLY I found this website_ and as a result TODAY is my last day on Singular_ and I hope that it will flush from my system quickly - I want my OLD SELF back!!!! I will never take this med again!!!,M,27,2  weeks,5/2/2007,Singulair

1016, 1, upper respiratory/asthma/allergies,Our high energy_ 4 year old son WAS on Singulair for 1.5 years. He showed many of the classic symptoms of being on this drug. Very aggressive behavior_ sensitive to small issues_ moody_ lack of focus/concentration_ cried ALL of the time over NOTHING_ fight_ kick_ night terrors and complain of leg cramps...I could go on and on...,"He often said to us_ ""I try to control myself_ but I can't."" It broke our hearts. He was asked to leave a private home daycare because of his aggressive behavior. His pediatrician sent us to 2 behaviorists - NO ONE questioned the meds he was on. It wasn't until my husband forgot to give him the meds for a couple of nights. His teacher even noticed the change and said_ ""he's loving & funny"" and she noticed a significant change in his behavior also.  I found this website and it was like reading our life. His pediatrician & pharmacist both said very few children show side effects_ however_ we completely disagree.  We've had 3 other friends take their children off the drug & also say there's quite a difference.  The FDA needs to take a closer look at prescribing this for children. After reading this site it appears it effects children differently than adults (I'm on it & don't have any symptoms like this_ age 39).

Then_ afterwards he would say he didn't know why he got so upset. I knew something had changed because he had never had meltdowns like this before.  I realized that they started about 3days after he began taking Singulair.

Also my son would wake up crying at night or even whimper in his sleep but I thought that it was just nightmares.  After stopping the singular two weeks ago_ my son immediately felt better and stopped crying at night.  What makes these side effects so terrifying is that it is happening in young children who sometimes have difficulty expressing their feelings or even identifying their emotions.  It breaks my heart that my son suffered with bouts of sadness for over a year without me knowing it.

She continued to have a barky cough after cold went away and the cough is why the prescription for Singulair was made. Singulair did help the cough go away_ but the side effects are terrible. We had our daughter on Singulair when she was three and she started wetting the bed after being on the drug for 2 months. We took her off of Singulair and the bed wetting stopped. Now that she is five we had to use the Singulair again to control the bark-like cough. The side effects are much worse this time and we are taking her off Singulair again. We will keep our fingers crossed that she does not get another bad cold.  So_ if you are prescribed Singulair for your kid to get them through a cold_ don't be afraid to take them off Singulair.

We put his increasing depression down to the shock caused by three severe asthma attacks in five weeks_ he had never had an attack before. Slowly his anxiety became depression_ last week the doctor said he needed a psychiatrist. Previous to Singulair he was happy_ now he just cries and wants to be at home. I am shocked by the change.

1063, 3, Allergy induced asthma,Night waking_ trouble falling asleep for nap_ irritable_ more aggressive and active than normal,My (20 month old)son has been on Singulair for a week now. The Dr. perscribed it for the chronic cough he's had for a year everytime he lays down. Today I started to wonder why he has been waking in the night and not taking his afternoon nap like normal.  He's also been aggressive towards his teddy bear.  So_ I went online thinking there might be more to Singulair than I read in the leaflet.  Wow_ what feedback!  The first night Singulair DID stop his coughing and he slept like a rock the first three nights.  I was so excited because it seemed like he was finally going to get sleep without being interupted by coughing throughout the night.  Yes_ the drug works_ but it's not worth the side effects_ especially in kids too little to explain what they're feeling.

1064, 1, Allergies / Asthma,"Extreme aggressive behaviour_ hitting_ kicking_ yelling.  Turned a wonderful little boy into someone we didn't know.  His preschool teachers reported having to segregate him from the other kids because of his hitting all day.  Normally a very loveable and affectionate child.  Always high energy but while on medication unable to shut him down.  Constant night terrors_ wouldn't sleep for 9 nights in a row.  Out of three physicians nobody informed us of these possible side effects.  After weeks of no sleep and inability to calm him down we researched it on the internet only to discover that everyone else had experienced what we were dealing with. We are kicking ourselves for letting this go on for five weeks before we asked why he was like this.  We thought it was the trying three's.  He complained of a sore penis as well as a ""belly ache"" every night within an hour of taking the medication.  He cried all the time and needed constant reassurance and wanted us with him all the ti",4mg at bedtime definitely improved his asthma and allergies.  We were able to significantly reduce the need for his puffers but there is not a chance we would ever give him singulair again.  He had his last dose 72 hours ago and we now have our little sweetheart back.  He has his sense of humour back and loveable huggable nature.  We will research everything we give him in the future before it ever touches his lips.  Our family physician_ the asthma clinic_ and allergist immunologist are going to get an earful from us for not mentioning that these side effects were something to watch out for.

I had to go to the ER about 3 different times in about 2& 1/2 weeks. They had started me on prednisone and an inhaler. The 3rd time in the ER the on call doctor was concerned and wanted to admitted me. My husband thought he was helping me out and said lets get to the bottom of this. They did and an other doctor said to take singulair and continue taking the prednisone.,That is when everything started. It has been a nightmare for me. I stopped taking the singlar but have to continue taking the prednisone to control the CHRONIC HIVES I get daily. I have had a CT scan_ lots and lots of blood work. They have not found anything. I can not get off the prednisone because the hive get really bad. I am now going to a specialist who is going to try some cancer drugs to get me off the prednisone which I have been on for 6 months at 15mg a day and am getting side effects from it. Some days I don't know how I can make it through the day. But I try and I keep Praying. My husband has told me that he feels like it is his fault. I don't blame him. But he has to watch me go through this daily and it's tearing him up not being able to do any thing.( My husband which he could go back in time and never let them admit me.)After about two months I stopped the singular.     ,F,46,46  years,1/4/2007,Singulair

When I would scratch_ welts would raise.  As I continued to take the medication_ I developed increasingly severe welts in response to the slightest skin trauma.  It got to the point that I would have huge welts that would leave scars along the waistband of any of my pants_ and I couldn't let the edge of a sheet of paper touch me.  I stopped taking Singulair_ and worst of the symptoms were gone in a few days.  It took about six months for the last of them to totally disappear.  This stuff SCARES me!

After becoming progressively tired over the past year+_ I told my primary care doctor that we needed to find out what was wrong with me_ that I couldn't go on feeling the way that I was feeling.  A full cardiac work-up revealed a perfectly functioning heart. The pulmonologist's report wasn't as rosy.  He believes that my years of untreated asthma have caused some permanent damage_ and that there may also be COPD involved.  He put me on Advair and Singulair.  I decided on taking 5 mg. of Singulair rather than the prescribed 10 mg_ since I'm less than 5' tall_ and under 100 lbs.  I'm frequently given doses of medication that are too high.

He started waking up in the middle of the night_ sometimes sobbing.It has seemed to help his allergies_ but with these side effects_ I don't think it's worth it.,We found out about the connection between singulair and hyperactivity through a chance encounter with another parent two days ago. Two nights ago_ we stopped giving him Singulair. We think we've already seen some positive changes but time will tell.

Halucinating -- on a trip to look at Fall foliage_ I was sitting in the passenger seat and panicked several times because I believed that we were going to crash into guardrails and other cars.  Trouble spelling words which was really weird since I've always been an excellent speller. But the worst was the sudden mood swings and extreme feelings of depression and hopelessness about my back problems_ almost suicidal even. Lashing out with crazy anger at my husband for no reason.  Only minimally helped my asthma and allergies_ which really aren't that bad anyways.,This stuff is bad news.  A nurse practitioner gave me a month's worth of samples to take_ never mentioned possible side effects. I've never experienced drug side effects like this before in my life. Had I not stumbled across this site while researching Singulair and two other drugs I started taking recently for my back_ I would probably not have made the connection. Frightening.  I stopped taking it after about 3 and a half weeks and the side effect symptoms completely disappeared in 3 days.  I'll never take this stuff again.,F,38,25  days,10/1/2006,Singulair

He was very hyper_ moody_ irritable_ and aggressive. These characteristics were totally opposite of his fun-loving_ happy-go-lucky behavior prior to this medication.

The doctor put him on singulair 4 mg.  It was a miracle.  He stopped coughing and it helped tremendously.  However_ I began to notice after about 2 months_ that he was very hyper_ and had mood swings.  I just chalked it up to his age.  Well_ when he was about 5 1/2_ I started to notice that right after he had the singulair he would become hyper and moody_ crying etc.  Then when he had a virus and had to stop the singulair for a few days_ I noticed_ even being sick_ he was so much calmer.  I stopped giving the drug.  I contacted the doctor_ who increased his inhaler and said it was okay to stop the singulair.  Well_ after about 3 weeks_ he was a TOTALLY DIFFERENT BOY.  He was calm_ sat in his chair_ smiled more_ didnt have crying spells.  I emailed this info to my doctor.

HOWEVER_ we accidentally forgot to refill his prescription over Christmas vacation (Dec 2005) and within two days we noticed a dramatic change in his behavior; he was calm (very little drama)_ focused_ happy_ cooperative_ just a happy 4 year old boy. We contacted our Family Doctor and he advised that the negative behavior_ (that we always thought was his normal behavior)_ could possibly be a result of the Singulair and we decided to keep him off the drug to test this theory. His daycare giver and preschool teachers all noticed a dramatic positive change in his behavior. After a month off the drug we had to put him back on it as his asthma flared up again. The negative behavior came back full force and is still with us to date...the positives have outweighed the negatives. We recentl,M,4,3  years,8/9/2006,Singulair

I have gained about 10lbs and a huge belly_ I look pregnant. And frequent nausea and upset stomach.,I stopped taking last night before visiting this website_ feeling the weight gain might be a side effect.

I never had any of these symptons until taking the medication.  Over the last 4 months since beginning the meds_ I have increased my caffeine intake to combat drowsiness without success.  It is more of a dizzy-drowsy sensation and is different than the drowsines associated with allergies. Have weighed the same for 20 years and immediately gained about 10 pounds within 1 month of taking and am now up to about 15 pounds total after 4 months.  Have a difficult time remembering_ focusing and concentrating.  Occasional nightmares with night sweats.  Hunger comes on fast and strong and I eat more quantity rather than more often.

1128, 1, Asthma,My boyfriend took Singulair for about 3 years_ during the time he has experienced anxiety_ brain fog_ depression_ eczema and some muscle aches.  Being a teenager he thought most of it was due to changing hormones and such.  For a while he could not afford his medication_ until about ten days ago.  All these syptoms have returned which has led us to believe they were side effects from Singulair.  He is usually very laid back and quite happy_ but would suddenly fall into states of aloofness_ and would say that he could not fall asleep at 2 a.m. because he would have irrational fears that he would die.  He has also been experiencing itchiness around his penis_and a significantly decreased libido_ as well as some sores near his mouth.  The only possible cause seems to be singulair though few have listed side effects to the genitalia or libido.,After reading through askapatient.com we have come to the conclusion that he should stop taking Singulair_ however his asthma is quite severe and we wish to find a new medication as soon as possible.  We are currently looking at Claritin as an alternative to Singulair_ but are trying to be more cautious about medication this time.  The bottle which Singulair came in does not have drug ingredient information on it so we cannot compare it to Claritin.   If you have any information about another medication as an alternative to Singulair_ the ingredients in Singulair_ experiencing similar symptoms as above from other medications_ or the effects of Claritin in comparison to Singulair we would be most grateful.

Cannot believe I didn't figure it out sooner.  He stopped taking it over 2 weeks ago....and I am happy to report he is sleeping like a baby_ laughing again and being more positive about everything in general!  I have my son back!,It's unfortunate that more doctors do not mention the possibility of these kinds of negative side effects.  They don't really know how a medication might effect our children.

Recently it has been tough to get her up and going to school where she is an excellent student. Having researched this on sites like this I now see that the drug affected her mood and gave her other symptoms that we explained away as other causes. The symptoms have grown progressively worse over time. I've taken her off Singulair--2 days now--and have begun to see a difference in her mood. Will report back as time goes by. This drug needs to be seriously monitored in children and maybe even banned. I thank God and all the posters here for talking about their experiences as I was considering sending her to a psychologist and was getting to my wits' end.

1209, 1, asthma induced by allergies,irritability_restlessness_ night terrors taking minimum of 1 hour to calm daughter down,My daughter is a very happy & active 2 y.o. (a few weeks under 2). She became restless after 2 doses (4mg at night)_ became irritalbe throughtout the day_ and started night terrors (screaming/aggitated) after 4 doses. It would take a minimum of 1 hour to calm her down. This was so beyond her normal temperment & sleeping pattern that I discontinued use. I am a pediatric RN & would be interested to hear if anyone else had similar problems giving their child this med.,F,2,6  days,5/28/2005Email,Singulair
1210, 1, Flair up of seasonal allergies,Depression_ moodiness_ extra sensitive_ weepy_ anxiety_ dry mouth_ hard time focusing and was very tired.,I only started taking the drug 12 days ago.  It seemed to help with my allergic flairup (seemed like a sinus infection without the coughing).  I did experience a very dry mouth at first_ but this side effect lessoned and I started feeling anxious_ had a hard time focusing_ very tired and starting becoming very sensitive_ moody and depressed - without any prompting - which made no sense to me.  It was like someone was pressing a button inside my head and making me depressed.  I do take Wellbutrin for depression_ which has worked successfully for me to this point.  I read the singulair insert for side-effects and only continued taking the drug because I thought the depressed feelings must be coming from something else - a busy life style?  Nothing I haven't handled before.  Then I went on line to see if anyone else experienced depression as a side effect and found this site.  Thank you for sharing your experience.  I will stop taking this drug and am sure the side effects will disappear.  This is not the first time I've experienced side effects that weren't on the label.  My doctor has told me that if you get a side effect when you start a drug and then you stop it and it stops - well I guess you need to do your own research since we're all individuals with our own chemistry.  I could be prone to the depression side effect.  I'm just so happy - I thought I was losing my mind!,F,39,12  days,5/21/2005,Singulair
1211, 5, Chronic sinus infections,Mild drowsy?  I have small kids_ so it's hard to distinguish if it's the meds or life in general...  other than that_ NOTHING!!  :o),I have not enjoyed clear breathing like this in over 4yrs!  After two nights of singulair_ I felt like a new person.  After 6mos of back to back sinus infections_ 90days of antibiotics_ a CT scan_ it amazes me this would be all it would take to feel human again!!  Only been on it a week_ but I chucked my Afrin!!

1212, 2, Asthma,Severe headaches lasting two or more days.,Singulair definitely cleared up my asthma symptoms.  I did not need an inhaler during the time I was taking it.  However_ the severe headaches forced me to discontinue taking it and I am now back on Ventolin on a daily basis.,M,53,6  months,5/15/2005Email,Singulair
1213, 2, Asthma,Palpatations_ Myalgia_ Insomnia_ lethargy_ weight gain_ depression.,Have been on this drug for a long time and the symptoms came on slowly but now the muscle pain has gotten so bad that the Dr. recomended I cut the dose in half for 4 days and then take half every other day for 4 days to help get off it.  I will let you know what happens.  The pains have gotten better after just 2 days_ but I do have tightness in my chest he said that should get better in a few days,F,20,4  years,5/11/2005,Singulair

1221, 1, mild asthma,I developed a horrible headache -- worse than a migraine -- and began vomiting within two days. I also couldn't concentrate or remember anything and it felt like I had suddenly become stupid.I didn't realize I was experiencing side effects until I went online on the fourth day and found websites devoted to people complaining about this medication. Right away I threw the bottle in the trash. The headaches persisted for a few more days_ requiring an emergency visit to a quick care facility where i was given hydrocodone and a shot of some painkiller. Aside from the side-effects_ this medication treated my asthma and I didn't need an inhaler at all_ even while exercising. Still_ the side-effects were so crippling that I'd never take this again or recommend it.,,F,33,4  days,3/31/2005,Singulair

1230, 2, To prevent asthma attacks.,Very heavy sleeping_ difficulty waking up in the morning_ general fatigue_ unusual irritability.  I'd hate to think of how irritable this drug might make someone who isn't as laid-back to begin with as I am; I would not be the least bit shocked to find out it is a factor in more than merely negative thoughts.  After learning of other users' side effects_ I have decided to discontinue using Singulair.,This drug should not be prescribed without serious warnings about its side effects.  What if somebody who (unlike me) already has a short fuse and has many sources or irritation (perhaps difficult children?) were to be prescribed this drug without being warned of the possible side effects?I'm glad to hear that Singulair helps some users as much as it does_ without giving them the negative side effects.  It's apparently not the right medication for me_ and my doctor apparently needs to learn more about the possible side effects.,M,36,21  days,12/30/2004,Singulair

1234, 1, asthma,extreme sensitivity_ irritability_ aggressiveness_ depression_ anxiety_ difficulty sleeping.,I am filling this information in based on experiences with my son.  Singulair was a miracle for us when he first began taking it just after his 2nd birthday and worked well for the first year.  At the beginning of his 2nd year on the meds he started showing the symptoms above.  We took him off the singulair and maintained his other asthma meds as previously prescribed...the symptoms disappeared completely after about 2 months.  No other changes to his meds were made.,M,4,2  years,11/28/2004,Singulair
