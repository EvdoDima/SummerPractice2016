14, 1, Seasonal allergies/rhinitis,I'm a nurse_ and I always look at side effects before taking any medication.  So I did see this med could cause mood alteration_ but like everyone else_ just thought it was rare and wouldn't happen to me.  However_ by day 5 I was starting to feel mood swings_ and on the 6th day I had this almost paralyzed mental state_ hard to describe but I could not even get out of bed.  Laid there and cried all day_ in a panic state_  not knowing why_ until I put two and two together and realized it was the medication.  Started investigating more_ and see multiple people with similar reactions within days of starting this med.    Stopped taking that day_ and mood has improved_ but in the 2 nights since stopping I have woken up panicked from sleep for no reason_ this last time I was out of bed and opening my closet before I even became conscious_ I don't know what my dream was_ but I was very afraid and my heart was pounding.,The side effects are DEFINITELY not worth the benefit for me.  Sad to see all the children who become so depressed and suicidial_ at least As an adult I knew what was happening.   How scary for a child!!!,F,49,5  days10mg,5/25/2016,Singulair

18, 1, Allergy induced asthma,Extream pressure in ears_ vertigo_ achey joints mostly hips and shoulders.  Horrible indigestion with heart burn and acid reflux.  Anxiety_ feeling like I was going to die (which I have never had my entire life). Heart pounding and heart palpitations.  Numbness with pins and needles_ on face_ left arm and left calf. Brain fog_ forgetfulness_ no get up and go.  Two lung infections and I've had lung inflammation once.  I believe these are all side effects of singular. Side effects came on gradually and I never thought it could be because of singular.  I stopped taking it by accident ( forgot to pick up my rx) and realized my hips weren't hurting.  I continued from there cold turkey.,I've been off for two months now and I'm so much better.  It didn't happen for me right away.  Joint pain and indigestion went away first with in a few days.  Palpitations were next to go.. Brain fog and numbness took about a month to get better (pin and needles went away with in a week of stopping singular) anxiety is SO much better_ still have little episodes and heart pounding every once in a while.  My symptoms (now I know side effects) were really bad for two years I'm hoping they continue to go completely away.  Singular has ruined the last two years of my life! I thought I was going crazy.  I've been to my Dr eight times in the past two years_ I've been to a neurologist_ and I've had a treadmill test.  All because of singular.  Don't take it_ it will kill you or ruin your life!! I can't get these years back thank God for my husband that is absolutely amazing and just kept telling me we'll figure this out.  If anyone can say how long it took them to feel 100% normal again please say how long it took.  I'm praying this is not my new normal_ these little bouts of anxiety and heart pounding just keep reminding me I'm not quite back to my normal.,F,47,4  years,5/14/2016Email,Singulair
19, 1, Exercise asthma,Horrible side effects emotionally and mentally.  I have allergy to steroids.  They cause depression etc.  Doctor stated no steroid in singular and I asked about psychiatric side effects as I had looked up.  It took me 3 weeks on medication to realize once again deeper depression. Fatigue..yet restlessness to initiate a chore and then couldn't motivate myself to do it.  Self centered fear. Almost a phobic feeling of going places. Hopelessness.  Which with my spirituality never experienced so strong. Isolation due to how I felt internally and didn't want to interact with people because I felt so low. I am a very outgoing person.  Which changed taking singular. I almost thought of going into a mental health facility because I couldn't understand what had given me such a turn or a change in my thoughts and behaviors. I stopped last night. Still feeling the after effects. But I said to Doctor about side effects depression etc. he said minuscule. Actually feel he didn't believe that steroid inhalers caused depression .  I will never go near steroid inhalers and it singular or drugs similar.  I felt like I was almost having a breakdown,I would never suggest anyone taking this medicine singular.  Or at least having a lengthy conversation of side effects.  Not minimizing so.  Even then I would say.  It's not worth it. The drug is evil and if you don't connect psychiatric side effects if present ..to this drug. Singular.  You might destroy your mental health.  Even give you thoughts of suicide. Many people may say.

There were times when there was extreme urgency to move my bowels.  Intense Diarrhea.  The diarrhea wasn't a constant when on the med but when I had it the intensity was worse then a stomach virus and URGENT.  Again the most obvious side effect was weight gain.  I was shocked when it wasn't listed as a side effect.  If it wasn't for being in touch with my body and being fit this weight gain could of went on for a while.

I researched Singulair and read the reviews. I asked my doctor to write me a prescription and mentioned all of the reviews where I had read about the side effects of nightmares and suicidal thoughts. He laughed it off and asked me if I believed everything I read on the internet (I will not be seeing him again). I told him no_ but that there were so many people saying the same things. I began taking Singulair and could finally breathe again and not spend my days blowing my nose and sneezing. Almost immediately I started having crazy dreams and they felt like they went on all night so I was exhausted in the morning.
