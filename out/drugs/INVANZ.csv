0, 5, acute diverticulitis,minor thrush but could be from the Augmentin the idiot in the ER started me on.,First diver flare was one year ago_ put on cipro/flagyl_ almost killed me_ developed lactose intolerance immediately_ lost 8 pounds in one week_ had to stop meds after 3 days_ horrible thrush took two weeks to cure.  This is NOTHING like those drugs.  NO side effects_ stool is loose but could be post diver flare_ have not lost weight.  If you have diverticulitis_ REFUSE cipro/flagyl and ask for this drug IV every day (a bit of an inconvenience) but far superior.,M,64,4  daysIV 1X D,6/10/2011Email,Invanz
