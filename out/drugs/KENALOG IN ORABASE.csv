0, 5, End stage of fever blister,No side effects,I had a lingering ulcer left over from a fever blister_ just inside my bottom lip. My dentist put some of this paste on it and then I applied it again in a few hours. I left it on for abt 3 hours each time and it was gone when I removed the paste the second time. All that gooey yellow tissue that would NOT go away_ was gone and the ulcer looked calm. No redness. Still a little tender b/c it needs to re-grow the skin in that spot. This paste was a miracle for me!,F,50,1  days0.1% 3X D,12/14/2011,Kenalog in orabase
1, 5, sores in mouth,I did not experience any side effects. This is the BEST medicine I have taken for my mouth. It does not sting like other canker sore medicines and it usually clears up the canker within three applications with relief by the second day. It is has worked miracles for me.,You will need an rx to get the medicine. My dentist had never heard of it_ it was recommended to me by a regular doctor_ but if you ask for it that can find it for you.,F,32,3  years,6/29/2009,Kenalog in orabase
2, 5, Canker Sores,I have never had any side effects from using Kenalog in Orabase,I have used Kenalog in Orabase since I as a kid.  My dad was Military and I would get it from the Miltary doctors.  It has taken my 15 years to find a doctor that would prescribe it to me.  I told me husband that he has to try it once and he will understand.,F,35,15  years,5/28/2009Email,Kenalog in orabase
