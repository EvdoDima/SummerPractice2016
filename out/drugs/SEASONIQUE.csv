3, 2, Endometriosis,Frequent urination_ depression_ anxiety_ acne_ bloating_ cramps_ been on my period for over a month,This is awful. I started my period two weeks before thanksgiving and I'm still not off it yet. Tomorrows Christmas... Ive been in pain since I started taking it.

5, 1, To help with PMDD,Continuously bleeding. Haven't stopped since my first day of the pill. Ridiculous amount of water weight gain. Super high anxiety. Completely not worth the water weight_ the anxiety and the endless bleeding. Last day of putting this drug in my body.,,F,27,3  weeks,8/16/2015Email,Seasonique
6, 2, contraception,Significant weight gain_ headaches,Only plus sides for me was the 4 periods a year and acne under control. What is no longer worth it to me is the significant amount of weight gain (20 lbs). I am depressed and anxious on this pill especially from the weight gain. I get headaches and have had migraines using this pill. I also have no sex drive. It's not worth feeling this way anymore. Now I have to regain energy and work hard to get these 20 lbs off! So frustrating.,F,27,1  years,8/6/2015Email,Seasonique
7, 1, Acne control_ prevention of pregnan,Acne_ break through bleeding_ lower back pain_ breast tenderness_ depressed mood_ cramping_ chest pain,Obviously_ every woman's body is different. However_ I switched to amethia (a generic seasonique) from years of reclipisen. I had no side effects with the reclipisen other than a mild breakout during my period week. I asked my gyno if there was a way to prevent these breakouts and she put me on this. My acne was mild but annoying. The first three months of amethia nothing seemed to change_ my acne stayed about the same. But then after about 5 months I had awful breakthrough bleeding and my skin was the worst it's been since my early teens. I'm also super depressed. I would think twice before taking this pill_ especially if you want to treat your acne. As I said everyone is different but after I finish my 6th month I'm switching!,F,21,6  months30,7/6/2015,Seasonique
8, 2, prevent pregnancy/regulate period,I actually get my period every other month on this pill_ which wasn't a big deal until this month when I got two periods. This pill will not regulate periods at all. I gain weight easily on it.,as a birth control_ it's pretty effective (no kids to show!) But half of that is I bleed contantly. The first month is fine_ about half way through the second month I start spotting_,F,23,2  years,3/28/2015,Seasonique
9, 3, excessive bleeding,I just started this medicine 3 weeks ago and I'm bleeding again just started yesterday.. Is this normal amongst the rest of you who are taking this? It's not enough for a pad etc but its still there nonetheless,,F,26,3  weeks1 pill day,3/20/2015Email,Seasonique
10, 5, Polycystic ovaries_ endometriosis,Light spotting,This is the best thing to ever happen to me. My periods were so bad that even with prescription pain meds_ I was still home from work on the couch crying. Now they only come once every three month and even then they are light and much less painful. The spotting happened in the first pack_ but since then it hasn't happened. I can't say enough about how this has helped me.,F,24,10  months,2/14/2015,Seasonique
11, 1, regulate periods,Horrible nausea and vomiting cramping and breast tenderness. The vomiting and nausea was like morning sickness. Horrible drug!!,I would never use this ever again..so awful,F,36,2  days,1/1/2015,Seasonique
12, 3, Severe cramping_ birth control,Major weight gain! Went from 130lbs to 147lbs in no time at all_Cramping even when not on periodSevere_ painful acne in face_ back and chest.,It's been over 10 years since I had acne like this_ and even then it wasn't this painful. The weight gain has been horrible. I already have large breasts and they're even bigger now. I look pregnant and don't fit into clothes I could wear 7 months ago. Dr said the birth I trol isn't to blame for these side effects but I refuse to believe the timing is coincidence. I never had any spotting whatsoever_ and my period comes right on time. However_ my periods have become even more painful_ longer_ and heavier. It's great getting your period every 3 months_ but not worth all these side effects.,F,25,7  months,11/14/2014,Seasonique
13, 1, lighter periods,Spotting(sometimes heavy)_ intense and extremely painful cramps not during my period_ headaches_ stomach issues(diarrhea_ gas_ etc.)_ SEVERE depression and anxiety(which I never suffered from before),The anxiety symptoms started only a month after beginning this pill but I thought it was just stress from life doing it however I continued on all the way into the third pill pack and it only got worse and worse. I had to go to the ER once for a panic attack. I'm off the pill right now_ it's been ten days and I'm struggling through everyday waiting to get this horrible pill out of my systom. It could take anywhere from one to two months for my body to get back to its natural balance. I'm also currently taking xanax to help me through the days. If I would've known I would've reacted like this I would've never takin  is pill. It was a horrible experience and I would never recommend this to anyone.,F,17,7  monthsunsure 1X D,9/28/2014,Seasonique
14, 1, Lighter Periods/Contraceptive,Headaches/Migraines_ nausea and diarrhea/irritable bowels_ depression worsened_ extremely moody_ still have random spotting/brown discharge and horrible cramps while taking the regular pills and not the sugar pill. Bipolar symptoms as well. I gained 20+ pounds in 3 years while on this_ mostly all in my stomach_ thighs and butt. Breasts just about doubled in size which was the only plus on the medication. Not sure if I need a stronger dose or if this medication just sucks.,,F,21,3  years.15 MG,8/13/2014,Seasonique
15, 5, Heavy bleeding on my period.,I sometimes have mild headaches as well as discharge but that's pretty normal while taking birth control. Other than that I love this medication. I have not had any problems with it.,,F,19,3  years,6/6/2014Email,Seasonique
16, 4, Long periods_ hormone balancing,Very low sex drive. Spotting. Brown discharge. Mood changes_ as in I feel less low. Continuous low level nausea_ but that could also be attributed to the other meds I'm taking_ Synthroid (50 mcg) and Palafer (300 mg).,I'd been taking them for nine months last year_ then was off of them for three_ now I'm back on. Before the pill_ I had periods that lasted for two months_ and a lot of that time was heavy flow. Not fun. They caused me to have anemia_ which I have to take Palafer for now. The long periods were caused by my under-active thyroid. I have to take Synthroid and birth control for my hypothyroidism. I'm horny all of the time when not taking Seasonique. During the one week where I do menstruate_ my sex drive comes back. There hasn't been a noticeable increase in acne_ and I haven't been measuring my weight_ but all of my clothes fit the same. I look healthier_ in fact_ my lips are fuller and redder_ and my cheeks have more colour.I'll take the low libido over two month long periods anytime. I don't need this as a contraceptive anyway.,F,20,17  days 1X D,4/17/2014Email,Seasonique

18, 5, Migraines_ Heavy periods,I started Seasonique as an attempt to help with my severe migraines. Heavy periods helped bring on these migraines(whether it was from so much blood loss or hormonal changes). This med helped tremendously. 1st few months had odd spotting/etc as others complain about. Since then haven't actually had a single period at all. Was concerned at first about this but gyn said it was fine. Stopped taking once during the past years due to cost and migraines almost immediately began severity again. Hope to NEVER need to stop this med again. It has been a lifesaver! I have gained weight/ decreased libido but it is worth it a million times over. Migraines stop my entire life so the trade off is just gotta happen.,,F,37,3  years,9/30/2013Email,Seasonique
19, 1, not tp get pregnant,Fevers night sweats made me depressed they made my life a living hell never could be happy on them had my skin turn in to rashes I got no help by the doctor that gave them to me bleed for 2 months I'm still bleeding an all I can say is help this medication is the worse,,F,27,2  months,3/15/2013Email,Seasonique

21, 1, Horrible periods,"I took seasonique because I had terrible cramps and heavy bleeding. I never got to experience the ""4 periods a year"". After the first pack_ as I was warned_ I bled for 3 weeks straight and it would have gone on for longer if I'd continued. But that's not why I stopped taking it. I've never had acne in my life_ and I had horrendous acne all over. It covered my face_ chest_ back_ and shoulders. I was disgusted since I never even had acne while I was going through puberty.",,F,20,7  weeks,2/18/2013,Seasonique
22, 5, fewer periods and cramps,Slightly decreased sex drive.,When I say slightly_ I mean slightly. I didn't even attribute it to the pill until I looked at a calendar. I love this stuff and I've recommended it to all my friends who have asked about it.,F,19,  1X D,12/28/2012,Seasonique
23, 1, birth control,"I suffered from a miscarriage in September. The pregnancy had been unplanned. A week after my miscarriage my midwife asked if I would like to try additional birth control. After talking we decided Seasonique would be best for me. Wrong. The first four weeks were continuous ""pregnancy symptoms."" I peed all the time_ had no energy_ my face broke out_ my breast hurt. After that I gained about 10lbs in a week...turns out it was water weight. After seeing about three different doctors I decided to quit taking it half way through my second month. And that was the best choice I ever made. I'd rather have periods and run the risk of getting pregnant than be on Seasonique.",,F,23,1  months,12/4/2012,Seasonique
24, 1, Lessen PMS symptoms & fewer periods,"Didn't have a good experience- tried to wait it out & let my body adjust. It's not a matter of ""IF"" you will experience any of the discussed side effects_ but WHEN & HOW BAD the side effects will be. In my case_ the effects were severe- starting with nausea_ cramps_ headaches_ then after about 30days_ it was overshadowed by continuous heavy bleeding_ moodiness_ decreased sex drive_ etc. I finally stopped after 4 months_ and within a week_ the change has been dramatically for the better. This pill is given out without the emphasis that it probably WON'T work for you_ unless you're amongst a small percentage.",,F,28,4  months1x D,11/29/2012Email,Seasonique

31, 3, Ovarian Cyst,I had very painful periods and reoccurring ovarian cyst. I was missing too much school and work. My social life was suffering. At one point I bled for three weeks_ which made me anemic as well. I was very ill and my doctor was puzzled. He suggested Seasonique. My first 6 months were the worst. I was depressed and I would cry all of the time_ BUT my hormones were messed up bad from my cyst. I couldn't control my moods at all. I'm surprised I still have my boyfriend lol. Mood swings was the most irratating side effect. I also had horrible headaches.  I was naseauted and achey for the first few months. This birth control gave me terrible cravings. I craved meat. Which is weird because  I can't eat meat because it disgusts me and my body has trouble digesting it. So that was odd. I am ALWAYS hungry! I gained about 20 pounds. It didn't decrease my sex drive. BUT it makes me bleed after sex. NORMAL sex_ not rough! It pours red blood and sometimes clots. It's scary and it's a big turn off for sure. The first time I bled for three days. This time just a day. I also feel sore down there and crampy in general. The first time I was so afraid but the Gyno said as long as it wasn't all the time it was ok. It was my cervix. The birth control made my cervix sensitive.  OVERALL I love it. I no longer have symptoms. I mean an occasional craving and increased appetite. BUT that beats my terrible period anyday. HOWEVER any time I miss a pill (which isn't often) I tend to get a cyst. Sometimes t,,F,18,2  years,7/10/2012Email,Seasonique

34, 4, Acne,Occasional breakthrough bleeding. Eventually stopped taking it due to moodiness_ but I don't think it's a bad drug because of that.,For acne_ this is the best stuff ever. Worked better than Accutane. Less frequent periods = less frequent acne flare-ups -- my skin was almost perfect while I was on this!I did not have any weight problems on this drug -- in fact_ with a diet_ I was able to lose 20 pounds while taking it. After a few years_ I started experiencing hormonal moodswings out-of-the-blue_ which resolved almost immediately when I stopped taking it. But everybody's body chemistry is different_ and changes over time -- so if my body needed a break from hormonal birth control_ I'm not going to blame the Seasonique for that. I had a few good years on it_ and I would consider taking it again in the future.,F,24,2  years1 pill 1X D,9/8/2011,Seasonique
35, 5, regulate period,none!,Never had break through bleeding or spotting at all.  Cramps and PMS are nothing compare to without or on other pills.  Best pill I've found and cannot imagine going back to a normal cycle pill and dealing with having a period every 28 days! Probably adds some extra water weight_ but you're not going to gain any significant weight unless you eat more. Just not possible_ but guess it's easier for people to just blame it on the pill.,F,22,1  years 1X D,9/3/2011,Seasonique
36, 4, birth control_ 4 periods a year,some initial weight gain. breast growth. decreased libido.,every pack of pills is a 3 month supply_ and then you get your period for a week and start a new pack. when starting this pill_ it is so important to take it at the same time everyday...otherwise you will see spotting. the first few months i was on the pill_ i did notice some weight gain. i started exercising again and it fell right off. breasts definitely got bigger (unrelated to weight gain)...went from a C to a DD. thanks seasonique!!! do notice a decreased libido on the first 2 months of every pack_ and then  on every 3rd month my libido surges. also on the 3rd month i tend to be moody and a little more emotional than usual. totally worth only having 4 periods a year though.,F,22,2  years 1X D,9/3/2011Email,Seasonique
37, 5, Birth Control,Initial weight gain. Spotting.,After 1 full year on Seasonique_ my spotting (during when I would normally have a period) stopped and my weight stopped fluxuating. I LOVE Seasonique_ and reccomend it to friends. It does not give me as many crazy hormone changes and mood swings as my last BC did.,F,28,3  years 1X D,8/4/2011Email,Seasonique
38, 3, Endometriosis,I have absolutely NO SEX DRIVE!!!! I'm emotionally detached from my partner.  It's killing my relationship. If I come off of the medication I will experience terrible cycles!!!! I'm at a standstill.  I've had the Lupron injections and they worked but were very expensive (and I was pre-menopausal).  It's tough on me right now.,It's good if you need to lessen your cycle but it may kill your libido!!!! Wish there was a happy medium for this problem.,F,38,3  years15mg 1X D,8/4/2011Email,Seasonique
39, 3, Severe PMDD,Slight weight gain_ water retention_ occasional break through spotting_ and moodiness,I switched off Seasonique to Sprintec because of my mood swings_ and honestly_ I can say that I actually miss Seasonique! It was nice not having my period every month. For the first year_ though_ I would *OCCASIONALLY* have break through bleeding at the beginning of the third month. I would spot barely enough to fill a panty liner everyday until the week of my period. It seemed like it was about every other month when this happened. Right before getting off Seasonique_ it seemed like it barely happened anymore. However_ the bloating was pretty bad...I had to take pills to help shed the water weight_ but overall... it was a good pill.,F,18,2  years 1X D,6/16/2011Email,Seasonique
40, 4, Birth Control and Skin issues,"Super weight gain and some serious ""munchy"" like feelings. I was also more emotional_ not angry or bitchy_ mostly just sad.",This birth control definitely works_ and although the first three months can seem a little jarring_ I didn't experience anything like a 27 day long period. The initial side affects went away once I started the second pack_ and I have lost the weight I gained. Other than a day or so of light spotting the pill works fine. Sometimes around the week before you get your period you feel some cramping_ but nothing that is too major. I've been very happy with the pill_ and would recommend it to anyone who wants the benefit of a four period year.,F,16,1  years15MG 1X D,6/2/2011,Seasonique

42, 2, birth control,Wow_ it's ridiculous how much WEIGHT I've GAINED. I started at 110 pounds & after only 6 months of taking this i am almost 140. If I had known I was going to gain 30 pounds so quickly_ i NEVER would have tried this! :(,It's awesome only getting your period only 4 times a year_ but for the first 4 months my period was completely whacked out. I had a 27 day period during the 2nd month & then spotted for the next couple months. But eventually my body adjusted & got used to it. SO JUST BEWARE...the 1st few months might suck because of irregularities. & keep in mind that you might gain a SIGNIFICANT amount of weight! Ugh_ not worth it.,F,28,6  months 1X D,3/27/2011,Seasonique
43, 5, Birth Control,The first pack I was on I spotted a lot and got about two bad headaches a week. All the packs after this I would spot once a pack for about two days then I'm back to normal. It controlled my cramps and gave me a much lighter peroid.,I would have to recomend this to anyone looking for a form of birth control. I have found it to work with minimal side effects. I have no complaints about getting a light_ painless period once every three months.,F,17,1  years 1X D,12/29/2010,Seasonique
44, 1, To control irregular cycle,Immediately I started to itch_ severe depression and hives_ urge to eat everything in sight and my damn period want stop.I stop taking it on the 9 day I couldn't take it any more. Later that same day I started to flow a little heavier like I was getting my period all over again. Actually it never really stopped_ only for a couple of hours here and there and it was light _it has turned slighty heavier and has a continous flow. I will never take another pill again. Also I was Told I have adenomyosis some of you all should look into that_ it can only be detected by physical contact with the uterus. This means my uterus is soft instead of firm is the reason I have irregular bleeding_ the only method of correcting this is to have a hysterectomy .,I took this years ago when it first came out and had no problem. I tried it recently for different reasons_ my cycle is more like 21-25 days which means I go any where from 12-16 days off and 7 day periods with 3-5 days spotting before. Most women have a 28 day cycle. My tubes are tied I just wanted the irregular bleeding to stop.,F,27,2  weeks 1X D,12/9/2010Email,Seasonique
45, 1, Birth Control,Weight gain_ no sex drive_ hair loss_ mood swings.,I requested this pill to only get 4 periods a year. So not worth it! When I did get my period it was usually for about 3 weeks_ and some days were heavy with large blood clots. I also gained 30 lbs. in 2 years without any change in diet or activity level. I actually ate healthier and exercised more to try to decrease the weight gain but no matter what_ the weight would not come off. The worst side effects were complete loss of sex drive and the hair loss. I stopped this pill because I never wanted to have sex with my boyfriend anymore (and this was not the case before starting this pill) and I was losing a lot of hair every time I showered_ brushed_ or ran my fingers through my hair. Since stopping this pill my sex drive has returned and I am no longer losing a lot of hair. I'm still trying to lose the weight I gained and I'm looking for the right bc for me.,F,27,2  years 1X D,10/24/2010,Seasonique
46, 5, Endometriosis & Ovarian Cyst,"Initial period ""flood"" during first pack (approx. 2 weeks); told to stop taking for one week_ then restart. Worked like a charm!",Seasonique has become my best friend! I began taking it after experiencing an unholy trinity of reproductive issues during the fall of 2008 (uterine fibroids_ severe endometriosis_ and a complicated ovarian cyst). My abdomen was huge_ looked like I was pregnant_ and I had severe pelvic pain all the time_ not just during periods. I got anemic because my periods became super heavy and I dropped a lot of clots. I would just come home everyday and curl up in bed in the fetal position. However_ surgery and Seasonique gave me back my life. Now my periods come every 3 months_ are almost cramp-free and super light. Never had bad acne_ but my skin is awesome now. My boobs also got bigger.

Do not take ANY hormonal contraceptive with ANY antibiotic.,"I am Bipolar Type II w/ Rapid Cycling & Mixed Episodes and Generalized Anxiety Disorder_ the constant hormone intake (aka 3 months w/out menses) freed me from aggravated mania/anxiety/depression during the periods I ""skipped"".

48, 2, to regulate my periods,moodiness_ cramping_ spotting,I used this birth control to regulate my period. I have a naturally 8-9 day long period with a heavy flow and severe nausea and cramping throughout. I went three months without a period but I had a lot of spotting. Some spotting would last 4 days. At the end of the 3 months_ instead of getting a regular week long period_ I got an 18 day long period!! It was hell!! I am definetly not ever going on this again. I do not recommend this!,F,17,3  months 1X D,7/13/2010,Seasonique
49, 2, control ovarian cysts_ bc,Weight gain (upper abdomen_ I look pregnant)_ bloating_ frequent urination_ depression_ increased anxiety_ easily agitated_ breakthrough bleeding_ decreased libido,I was on Seasonale for 6 months before Seasonique. My gyn has switched my bc a lot because I've been sensitive to all I have tried either with high nausea_ depression_ and decreased libido. I was hospitalized due to a ruptured cyst that still developed while on Seasonale and had lingering nausea. I was switched to Seasonique in hopes that my nausea would lessen. It did. However_ I have had breakthrough bleeding every month. Then it was brought to my attention that I wasn't acting myself and was acting depressed and more anxious than ever. My sex drive went away. The emotional change made me feel like I was on the outside watching myself consciously not being able to feel the appropriate emotional response. Instead I just felt tense_ agitated_ and confused.,F,23,2.5  months 1X D,6/18/2010,Seasonique
50, 4, Four periods a year -- why else?,During 1st pack -- breakthrough bleeding (mild-medium)_ moderate acne_ breast tenderness_ water weight_ moderate pmsFollowing packs -- mild breakthrough bleeding_ decreasing every new pack_ mildly decreased sex drive,First pack is difficult  understand that. If you dont want to see it through_ don't start it. Also_ if you're the busy or absent-minded woman who has difficulty taking it at the exact same time_ I wouldn't recommend it either. On this type of pill_ it seems to be even more important to take it at the same time (+/- MINUTES_ not hours). On the first pack_ I had horrible acne (expected)_ I also had about a month's worth of breakthrough bleeding_ but it was mostly colored discharge rather than actual bleeding_ so pick up a pack of panty-liners and for the first several months_ just get in the habit of putting one in. On the following packs_ I had less and less breakthrough bleeding and now that I'm almost at a year_ I have almost no issues. I have less pms now than ever_ my periods are 2 to 2.5 days_ about 12 days a year concerned about pads/tampons. The mildly decreased sex drive is just that  mild. Remember each woman is different_ and starting a new pill will always be an adjustment. The adjustment here is more -- you're trying to trick the body into ignoring it's hormone cycle for 3 months at a time. So_ my advice is be ready to experience a difficult few months_ but give it two packs to make a final decision. Because at the end of that first six months_ I was steadier mentally and emotionally than ever before. This will not be the same for every woman. But as for me? Fewer periods_ less emotional upheaval_ almost zero side effects and...did I mention fe,F,23,1  years.19 mg 1X D,6/8/2010Email,Seasonique

52, 2, endometriosis,breast tenderness_ weight gain_ headaches_ breakthrough bleeding_ decreased sex drive_ restless sleep.,I was put on this drug after being diagnosed with endometriosis. During my first pack I began cramping during week 8 which continued through week 13. I began spotting and then then had a 4 week period beginning week 9. I kept taking the pill because I knew it would take some time for my body to adjust to having a period once every three months. During my first month on this drug I gained 15 pounds. The first 3 weeks of my second pack went well_ but at the start of my 4th week I started cramping and spotting with no relief from otc pain relievers. I talked to my doctor and I'm switching to something stronger. It's too bad this drug didn't work for me. I feel bad rating it at a 2 because I don't think it's a bad drug_ it just didn't work for me. I've tried 3 different kinds of bc and am on to my 4th_ I just have to find the right fit for me.,F,25,4  months 1X D,5/25/2010,Seasonique
53, 5, Birth Control_ Shorter Periods,I have had no side-effects while taking this medicine. You MUST take it at the same time every day. I believe that's why I haven't had any breakthrough bleeding.
