9, 1, I had symptoms of a yeast infection,I had been experiencing increasing itching and burning which in the past told me I had a yeast infection. The last time I had Diflucan and that worked well. I am between doctors so I thought this would be a simple solution. It's been a few years since I've used this type of product. The pain and itching were worse than the infection. It also said the wipes were not to be used after medication was applied. I toughed it out but it hurt. It took 2 days for the discomfort from the meds to settle down. I am post menopausal and now I am having cramping and a period. Going to put in a call to the GYN nurse- very disappointed in the product.,,F,51,1  days,8/28/2015Email,Monistat 1 combination pack

13, 1, Mild itching,Worst remedy ever. I used this to relieve some mild itching I have had for about a week. An hour after inserting the ovule my privates were burning. I'm running to the bathroom dabbing and using a cold wash rag. I've been up for 2 hours already because of the pain. Never again will I use this crap!,,F,36,1  days,5/30/2015,Monistat 1 combination pack

16, 1, Vaginal yeast infection,Last night I tried this. Easy application and went to bed. A while later I woke up with the worst pain--burning_ swelling_ itching. It was unbearable. I got minimal relief squeezing my legs together. No way could I sleep. I rolled up a hand towel and put it against my privates_ that gave a bit of relief and helped me get get some sleep. This morning_ it still hurt_ but not so intensely. Still worse than the yeast infection now in the afternoon.,Obviously a lot of women have allergies or bad reactions. I don't rcommend this product.,F,62,1  days,2/12/2015,Monistat 1 combination pack
17, 5, ,I felt some burning after using the bathroom once the ovule was inserted. ,I am pleased with the results. The only reason I bought it was because it was a weekend and I couldn't call my doctor for a Diflucan. I prefer the pill because it's not messy. I am not feeling any symptoms of the yeast infection though so I am pleased.,F,42,1  days 1X D,2/1/2015,Monistat 1 combination pack
18, 1, yeast infection,Do not take the worst burning & itching ever!,I stupidly took this thinking O one day and I'll be done my boyfriend will be in town in two days and it'll be great. I had no idea that the pain and burning that I would experience was 100 times worse than the mild slightly irritating yeast infection symptoms that I had been having.after about 1 hour of putting in the medication my vagina was so on fire I literally felt like I want to slide my hand in claw the walls of my vagina out it burnt and it at the same time so badly. I was screaming in agony and crying as if I was giving birth! Never ever ever would I recommend this medication not even to my worst enemy this medication should be a crime it should be illegal to be given to anyone it is definitely not worth the pain and misery and you will experience do not take this medication I wish I had researched it before I took it I just saw one day and thought great it had no warning label.,M,34,1  days,11/13/2014Email,Monistat 1 combination pack
19, 5, I had the symptoms,I_ like a lot of you_ have had unbearable itching for about 2 weeks with no prevail. So I decided I would go a head and try monistat 1. So far I haven't had any crazy itching or burning but I guess it may happen. But I read somewhere before I put it in and on that the crazy itching is from the open sores from previous scratching. And the medicine is killing the yeast so I guess it's like alcohol on an open sore. I didn't think it would feel great... I haven't been scratching to much then and now because I new it would only make both cases worse. But cold compresses and the soothing wipes are getting me threw this.And today will be my last day of symptoms!!!,,F,22,1  days1,9/11/2014,Monistat 1 combination pack
20, 1, Yeast infection,I usually use Monistat 3 day pack and that always worked for me whenever I had a yeast infection. However_ this time around I bought the monistat 1 because I wanted to treat the infection only 1 day instead of 3. Boy_ do I regret it.... After a few minutes of placing the medication using the applicator_ I felt intense itching & burning near the opening of my vagina. It was 10x worse than the infection itself! I will never be buying this ever again.,,F,22,1  days1200 mg,7/23/2014,Monistat 1 combination pack

23, 1, Yeast Infection,As most of the other reviews on here _I  had a pretty bad Y.I. & I figured it would be better to use an over the counter med instead of going to the Doctor. This medicine was easy to use_ but about an hour after using it_ I had INCREDIBLE itching and burning!! It was worse than the symptoms. I was miserable and couldn't sit still.  I itched and burned for probably an hour_ after that my symptoms were gone... Thank God!!! But this is an awful medication way too strong to be over the counter and the side effects are TERRIBLE.,,F,27,1  days,5/30/2014,Monistat 1 combination pack

29, 1, yeast infection,So I was having a mild discomfort and used a test kit to see I had a yeast infection. So I bought this product.  It has been at least 5 hours since I used it and it still feels like I burned my vagina with boiling water. There is no other side effects_ just the burning but it really does hurt. I hope it will pass by morning but either way I would rather spend the money for the doctor than go through this again.,,F,25,1  days,12/1/2013,Monistat 1 combination pack

35, 5, yeast infection from antibiotic use,No side effects.,This stuff worked great! I had zero burning or itching. The yeast infection cleared up_ as promised. The only downside is that the stuff is a little messy_ especially compared to the ease of a diflucan tablet_ which is also cheaper than this kit. BUT buying the kit saves me the hassle of going to the Dr.'s and getting a pelivc exam_ so I'll take this anyday.,F,23,1  days 1X D,6/9/2012,Monistat 1 combination pack
36, 1, Yeast infection,This stuff is horrible and should be pulled from the shelves_ immediately!!! I used the monistat 1 before going to bed. It immediately started burning and itching_ but the side effects saying those things may increase. I powered through and eventually fell asleep. I woke up a few hours later with what felt like menstrual cramps_ very painful. As I sat up_ I realized my vulva hurt immensely!!! Upon inspection_ my inner labia were swollen to about 4 or 5 times their normal size and were red and raw. I was also so itchy!! Of course_ I was in so much pain and couldn't even touch myself without wincing. I took a shower and tried to get as much off as possible. I cannot express how painful this was!!! I kept an ice pack on for most of the day_ which helped with the swelling_ a bit. My skin was so raw that it started bleeding. That was yesterday. I took Benadryl last night and slept with an ice pack on. Things are mildly better today_ but I will be going to my GYN ASAP! Do not use this product!!! Please_ it's so awful. Even if you've used it before_ it only takes one time. I can't believe the FDA thinks this is ok for women.,,F,34,1  days,12/12/2011Email,Monistat 1 combination pack
37, 1, Vaginal Yeast Infection,Intense horrible unrelenting BURNING.NONSTOP burning.,I've had yeast infections before and have always gone to the Dr. and gotten a prescription. Since it was a weekend and my Dr's office was closed_ I decided to use Monistat 1. It was simple to use but that was the only positive. I also used the cooling cream...ha! It started to burn almost immediately and so I rinsed off in the shower. Unfortunately_ my insides still felt like they were on fire. It felt like someone had poured acid in my vagina and my skin was melting off. I would have gone to the ER if anyone would have been home to drive me. I didn't think it would ever stop. I took a benedryl hoping that it would help me sleep. I'm writing the FDA next_ there is no reason that this product should still be on the market.,F,28,1  days 1X D,10/24/2011,Monistat 1 combination pack
38, 4, Vaginal Yeast Infection,Mild to moderate discomfort from time to time_ but that might not have been due to the medication... yeast infections can hurt! Also_ I had very thick (although not excessive) discharge that I am assuming was from the ovule.,I have heard so many complaints about this medication_ but honestly I did not have any adverse side effects! The process was simple and caused very little discomfort and the external cream did wonders for the itching!,F,18,1  times1200 1X AN,9/26/2011,Monistat 1 combination pack
39, 1, Yeast Infection,BURNING_ INTENSE ITCHING_ SWELLING_ HEAT_ SORE,This is horrible!  I have had a yeast infection for about a week.  I use natural methods to rid myself of a yeast infection_ and have for years.  I tried my tea tree oil_ tried my yogurt_ and garlic.  It was certainly getting better_ but I was getting tired of waiting for it go away completely.  I figured this one was just worse than normal and I needed an OTC help to knock it out.  I put the medication in and went to bed.  An hour later I wake up it hurts so bad.  It's burning and itching and I feel hot.  I go to the bathroom and the little egg thing falls out.  I figure I just needed a little more of the external cream since I was itching.  BIG mistake_ it starts burning and itching more.  I got in the shower and put the hand held shower head on the strongest it will go and power washed it out.  I took some anti-inflammatories the doctor gave me for a muscle injury a few months ago and applied lidocaine to my poor burning skin.  WHY THE HELL are they selling this stuff?  I too considered ER or doctor's office_ but what can they do?  Flush it?  Give me an anti-inflammatory?  I used Monistat about 10 years ago...it NEVER did this before.,F,28,1  days1200 1X D,9/19/2011,Monistat 1 combination pack

41, 1, ,"I am 43 yrs of age and have dealt with vaginal infections much of my life.  In the past_ I've used Monistat 7 and had no side effects.  This is the 2nd time I tried Monistat 1 and the 2nd time experiencing intense burning that did not subside after hours.  I am amazed by women on here saying this is normal and the women complaining are wimps... are you serious?  This is a ""side effect"" to the product.  It is very likely that you might feel a slight tingling or itch when using a cream of any type but if the burning is so bad_ you can't sit still or it continues hour upon hour_ it is time to seek medical attention or at the very least_ wash the area and try to ""remove"" the cream from the vaginal area.  You should NOT be this uncomfortable.  One woman on here wrote that vomitting when taking any medication is normal... I mean_ really_ are you serious?  That is an allergic reaction!

I decided to try the 1 day treatment.  It was awful.  I inserted the ovule a few hours before bed and everything was fine.  However_ I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible itching.  It was much worse than the infection itself.   I burned and itched for about 2 hours_ all the while applying ice_ a cold wash_ anything to make it stop.I considered the ER_ but what would the be able to do?  Finally after 2 hours I fell asleep and woke up with a mild itching and the infection seems to be gone.  I will NEVER use this product again.
