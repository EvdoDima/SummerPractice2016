0, 1, Poss UR infection,Pain in my right knee and left shoulder due to the quinolone effect of tearingup your tendons and cartilage. Approximately - 3-6 months after taking this garbage noted these moderately severe side effects.  These pains were unlike anything I ever felt but was unable to connect them to this drug till my second floxing with cipro when during my research - heard that nalidixic acid also affects the tendons and cartilage.,Find another antibiotic if you enjoy walking_ standing_ or lying in bed without pain.  This drug is not worth the side effect - better off with the disease.,M,54,1  weeks500 mg 1X D,10/30/2010Email,Neggram
