1, 2, Hypogonadism,Severe contact dermatitis.  Pain_ swelling_ itching.,This product did raise serum testosterone.  But after approximately 3 months of use_ it produced a sudden skin reaction over the course of two days.  At the application site_ I had severe swelling_ redness_ and itching.  Anyone can react badly to a product.  But the suddeness of this reaction was a little weird.  I think I'll try shots instead.,M,39,3  months40mg 1X D,11/25/2012,Fortesta
