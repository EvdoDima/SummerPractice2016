1, 5, Insomnia,no side effects except alittle sleepy when awaking but doesn't last,I have for years only taken periodically to avoid becoming dependent but decided to take it 3 nights in a row and got great sleep. I am going to try not taking it tonight.  I love this product please don't take off the market.  I am able to function so much better during the day.  I have had insomnia for a long time.  Wonderful to sleep all night.,F,74,30  years30 mg 1X M,12/5/2013Email,Dalmane
2, 1, Insomnia,"I've had insomnia for many years.  I used to take Ambien 10mg_ but it stopped working after a while.  I stopped taking it and tried Melatonin (10mg).  My insomnia is so bad that I often sleep only every other day! My doctor asked me to try Trazodone 100mg (didn't work) and then Flurazepam 30mg (Didn't work).  This is very frustrating.  I do tend to metabolize medications quickly_ however.  What might knock someone else out or give them pain relief_ will usually do nothing for me.  I don't drink_ smoke and have never taken recreational drugs.  I just have a naturally high tolerance and likely the ""First Pass Effect"" which is why oral medications don't work well on me.",The DALMANE (Flurazepam) 30mg did absolutely NOTHING except for leave me with a terrible taste in my mouth for some reason.,F,36,4  days30mg 1X D,9/30/2013,Dalmane
3, 5, insomnia,"Zero. Slight tiredness after 3rd day. Total relaxation in the a.m. No ""hung over"" or ""drugged"" feeling upon awakening. Long half-life so I take it for 3 days then skip 2 days. This helps with not building up more of a benzo tolerance.",Best sleep drug going. I suffer severe anxiety which keeps me up most nights. Ambien_ Lunesta_ Trazodone_ Seroquel_ Klonopin_ even marijuana_ all did nothing. I need something to shut my brain up. I also take 6mg's of Xanax daily. Only problem with Xanax is rebound anxiety every morning. Dalmane takes care of that. Dalmane is like taking a fist full of Valium b-4 bed. Thirty minutes after taking Dalmane it feels as if my mattress is a marshmellow which I'm sinking into_ then I wake up 7-8 hours later fully refreshed. Long half-life which allows me to take it for 3 days then skip for 2 days_ yet still feel the effects.,M,35,1  weeks30 mg 1X D,3/14/2012Email,Dalmane
4, 1, insomnia,I couldn't wake up. Couldn't make any plans till 4 PM. Groggy_ sedated_ blurry vision_ confusion.I became scared to drive as I wasn't ever fully awake.Attempts to stop this drug cased severe withdrawals.,I have tried for years to get off this drug. I have lowered the dose after slow but persistent tapering. It is an EXTREMELY unpleasant drug to taper from as it causes nasty withdrawals (panic attacks_ re-bound insomnia_ severe restlessness).This is a very additive benzo--please use with utmost caution. Do not suddenly stop this drug or allow yourself to be stitched over to another sleeping pill.It is an old benzo similar to Valium and has a very long half life (builds up in your system).The doctor who prescribed it had to not had any idea what it would do because it's that nasty of a drug.,F,55,7  years60mg 1X D,3/18/2011,Dalmane
5, 5, insomnia,None- but_ very very addictive_ its a Benzo! Do not take more frequent than a few times. After a wk or so of daily use you are ADDICTED even with just one pill aday.,"Suffered trauma in my earyl 20's_ lost marriage_ job etc from insomnia.  The only medication that worked was ""dalmane"".  Later in life prescribed xanax and dalmane_ bad combo! addiction big time! Bare in mind_ I took the lowest dose of xanax and still got ""tolerance"" addiction!!!!! one pill a day_ yep.  Withdrawal was HELL.  Read Benzo.org_ Prof Ashton's info on benzo's.   Please leave any benzo to ""rare"" use_ only for those times when nothing will pull you out of days of insomnia.",F,54,15  years30 mg 1X AN,2/2/2011,Dalmane
6, 4, insomnia,A bit of morning grogginess_ but otherwise_ none.,Has helped somewhat with my disordered circadian rhythm issues (falling asleep at dawn and waking around 3pm).  There's a bit of grogginess in the morning but not that bad.  Was taking Restoril_ and Dalmane definitely makes me feel sleepier_ which helps.  Overall_ it's a good med.  Cheap too!,F,25,2  weeks,9/23/2009,Dalmane
7, 5, Insomnia_ anxiety,Grogginess_ dazed feeling in the morning.,After being hooked on Ambien_ I decided to make a switch to something new after consulting my doc.  I took 30mg of this last night and it was the first time in a year that I slept over 8 hours in a row without waking. Since I don't want to become dependent on another drug I will be limiting the amount I take of it.  I con only hope it does not lose effectiveness over time.,M,34,1  days,8/1/2009,Dalmane
8, 5, To help me sleep,none,This medication is an older one but works great without all the side effects. I have had no problems with it.,F,40,1  weeks,2/16/2008,Dalmane
9, 4, sleep,works great_ sleep very well not all the side effects. like ambien cr,,F,40,1  days,10/13/2007,Dalmane
10, 5, to sleep,Not sur if it caused hair loss. Stop taking it to see_ other than that it did work great.,It does take about 3 days to really start working. But after that it was really good less side effects.,F,40,1  weeks,9/24/2007,Dalmane
11, 5, sleeplessness,none,Works great.  Not a relaxant_ your up one minute and asleep the next.  Some nights it works better than others????,F,37,7  years,9/20/2007,Dalmane
12, 4, can not sleep,none,It has wotked fine. sleeping better. Don't forget everything. good so far.,M,40,7  days,9/5/2007,Dalmane

14, 5, insomnia,dry mouth,,F,49,30  days,11/28/2005,Dalmane
15, 3, Insomnia,None,Takes about three days to build up in your system before it works well. The first couple of nights it barely helped at all. By the third night I slept fairly well. I quit taking because there are better sleep aids out there that don't have to build up in your system with such a long half life.,M,38,15  days,11/4/2005,Dalmane
16, 4, insomnia,Residual grogginess; felt like guardal shield around me and not quite experiencing life in the real sense; coffee helped me overcome grogginess in the AM.,Took for over 21 straight years; I know this is not good_ but it seemed to work for me; depression caused me to be unable to sleep well or get to sleep_ thus I could not afford to go off this medicine. After so many years on dalmane my new dr. switched me to another sleeping pill.,M,60,21  days,9/25/2004,Dalmane
