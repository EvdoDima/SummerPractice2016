0, 1, Emergency contraception,Horrific - Over the course of four months_ I gained 27 pounds. This weight was largely all in my hips and thighs_ and was cottage-cheese-like cellulite. I had not changed my activity level or eating habits whatsoever (I eat a spartan_ gluten-free diet). It's a year later and I still have not been able to take off the weight. Additionally_ I have a high SHBG level. It remains high at 250! This is one year - ONE YEAR - after I took the Plan B pill. Don't let anyone tell you this stuff leaves your system quickly. It lingers forever.,,F,42,1  times1.5 MG 1X AN,6/28/2015,Plan b one-step
