Twelve years later I suffer severe fatigue anxiety_ PTSD plus many symptoms too long to recount here!!,LARIAM is a medication which should not be given to anyone unless they are under strict medical super vision in a hospital. Giving this medicine to people who are travelling is absurd given the high rate of adverse effects!!!!

Everything is there_ but I can't get it. I don't understand it unless I really concentrate on tasks and concepts I found simple a month ago.

I'm already on anti depressants and have a history of anxiety and major depression. My doctor did NOT warn me about the risks associated with Lariam at all. You'd think that with my history_ he would be very cautious about prescribing this drug for me. It's clear after reading this page that my doctor along with many others know NOTHING about the risks. All of today I feel like I am having brain shivers.. as if my brain is struggling to keep up with my body and it's just rattling inside my head. I only ever feel this when I suffer withdrawal symptoms from missing a dose of an anti depressant. I did NOT miss any dose so I know it's the Lariam. Since last night I feel as if something is caught in my throat. It hurts to swallow when I eat because it feels as if my throat passage is narrower. I have severe heartburn. Taking a zantac did not ease the discomfort at all. My head just hurts. I feel dizzy. I had to go home half an hour into work this morning because I couldn't cope. I vomited when I got home. Went back to my doctor and he gave me Stemetil to help with the nausea. Even that isn't helping!!!!! I still feel terrible. My head hurts so much and I've been crying all afternoon.

ALL I recommend is keep ur self busy doing something like playing video games_reading or walking and doing some mild exercise.This shit will fade over time..and the BEST ..Just pray to GOD>.its all in his hands.we were destined to get this and I feel God just wants us to pray to him.Everything will be alright Love and lig,M,24,1  days30 mg 10X D,9/10/2010Email,Lariam

And even after that_ at certain moments the symptoms reappeared briefly. It was the worst period I have ever experienced. I am happy the side effects were not permanent_ but I will never ever take this drug again_ and I would advise everyone not to take it. And in addition to the side effects and the damage it does to your body; Taking preventive antimalarial causes the malaria to develop drug resistance. Malaria becomes harder to cure!After three months stopping the Lariam_ I got Malaria. I recovered and I'm now on homeopathic pills. Until now very happy with it!,F,24,6  weeks 1X W,9/10/2010Email,Lariam

Those who truly understand are those that have taken and reacted. My story is much like many others; no history of any psychological problems_ feeling great and enjoying life. After the 4th tablet I ""broke"" in March 2009. Collapsed at work with a BPM of 180PM. Then came the long_ long_ long struggle with trying to regain my sanity_ perspective and life. Severe debilitating anxiety consumed me for almost 6 months. After just 4 weeks off work I went back to work_ everyday the same_ shaking and sweating in the office trying to cope with running my own business_ with my friends and colleagues watching in awe and horror. Had to deal with idiotic psychiatrist who put me on 2x different drugs (Pregabalin + Escitalopram) telling me I had an ""anxiety disorder"". Got myself off these drugs after 6 months and continue to improve with rest_ supplements_ ayurveda and *time*. Still suffer with thyroid issues (shaking_ agitation_ tremor)_ vestibular issues (brain fog) and fatigue_ but I am continuing to improve. Lariam completely changed my personality and I have fought to change it back. This drug is Satan's accomplice. It is the worst form of torture and it is a suffering that one shoulders completely alone. I am in the process of setting up a website at lariam.org to help others identify Lariam toxicity and recover from it. I am determined to make a full recovery_ a",M,25,4  weeks250MG 1X W,7/28/2010Email,Lariam
