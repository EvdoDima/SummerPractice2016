Twelve years later I suffer severe fatigue anxiety_ PTSD plus many symptoms too long to recount here!!,LARIAM is a medication which should not be given to anyone unless they are under strict medical super vision in a hospital. Giving this medicine to people who are travelling is absurd given the high rate of adverse effects!!!!

Everything is there_ but I can't get it. I don't understand it unless I really concentrate on tasks and concepts I found simple a month ago.

I'm already on anti depressants and have a history of anxiety and major depression. My doctor did NOT warn me about the risks associated with Lariam at all. You'd think that with my history_ he would be very cautious about prescribing this drug for me. It's clear after reading this page that my doctor along with many others know NOTHING about the risks. All of today I feel like I am having brain shivers.. as if my brain is struggling to keep up with my body and it's just rattling inside my head. I only ever feel this when I suffer withdrawal symptoms from missing a dose of an anti depressant. I did NOT miss any dose so I know it's the Lariam. Since last night I feel as if something is caught in my throat. It hurts to swallow when I eat because it feels as if my throat passage is narrower. I have severe heartburn. Taking a zantac did not ease the discomfort at all. My head just hurts. I feel dizzy. I had to go home half an hour into work this morning because I couldn't cope. I vomited when I got home. Went back to my doctor and he gave me Stemetil to help with the nausea. Even that isn't helping!!!!! I still feel terrible. My head hurts so much and I've been crying all afternoon.

She seemed to stare into space and only speak when spoken to. I would say lets go out and she would reply yes but would not move. I would say come on and she would say I'm comming but just sit there. Took her to hospital where a brain scan revealed a problem on the front of her brain. Later a biopsy revealed the swelling of the blood vessels at the front of the brain which was pushing on the brain. The diagnosis was Cerebral Vasculitice. Doctors said it was probably caused by Larium but could not be 100% sure. At the time I did some research and found other stories related to Larium side effects. I cannot belive that people are still being subjected to Larium in 2009.She had to take very strong medication as well as other tablets to reduce the inflamation. She was not allowed to become pregnant whilst taking these medicines. We have been to hell and back and come through ok. Although I wish it never happened_ my wife is lucky it was not worse.

It's a mystery why some react and others are fine_ but it has been contraindicated for women on the Pill and anybody who drinks any alcohol.  If the liver is at all compromised when the drug hits_ it can quickly build up to a toxic level in the brain.,F,37,3  weeks,10/28/2008Email,Lariam

I mistook it as a response to a stressful environment.  About a year after I returned from Pakistan_ I was diagnosed with clinical depression_ which still plagues me 5 years later.  Welbutrin helps quite a bit_ but doesn't take care of all my symptoms.  Recently_ due to unexplained weight gain (20 lbs in 6 months while working out 3xweek)_ pain in legs_ numbness in feet_ dry scalp and skin_ and brittle nails_ I've been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism.  The Synthroid seems to be helping_ so hopefully the right dosage will eliminate those symptoms.  I am very angry that I was prescribed a substance that was known to have adverse side effects_ and that come to know after the fact_ I was in an even higher risk group_ being that I was female and taking an oral contraceptive.  Due to this horrible drug_ I will be on medication for the rest of my life to control the depression and hypothyroidism that it has caused_ and struggling with the symptoms that m,F,35,8  months,7/16/2008Email,Lariam
103, 1, Malaria prevention,brown acid style hallucinations_ nightmares continuing into waking up_ loud tinnitus_ nausea_ rage_ crazy behavior,My wife and I both had serious problems during and after taking this drug.  My wife recently had a Grand Mal seizure to add to the list.  I will never take this ever again and  the fact that it continues to be prescribed is insane.  It is not prescribed in other countries and anyone who has used it knows what I am talking about.  It is so obvious that I think it is a conspiracy (another symptom? I can't tell anymore.),M,29,3  months,6/3/2008,Lariam
104, 1, Military Deployment to S. America,Vivid dreams_ sleeplessness_ neuropathy.,I took Lariam for approximately three months during which time I experienced some sleep disturbances.  The worst of it was and still is (3-1/2 years later)_ is the neuropathy.  About a month after starting on the medication_ I experienced shooting pains in my body_ muscle fasciculations and tingling and buzzing sensations throughout my body.  Like I said_ these nerve disturbances still exist today 3-1/2 years later.  I have every reason to believe it is permanent.  Please explore other options for malaria prophylaxis.  There are safer alternatives to Lariam.  This drug should certainly not be your first choice.  I'd go so far as to say it should be banned.,M,29,90  days,4/12/2008Email,Lariam

111, 1, Peace Corps,facial convulsions/muscle spasms with spaciness; panic attacks.,I took Lariam for about a month while I was in the Peace Corps.  I stopped because I experienced facial spasms/convulsions for a number of hours combined with spaciness and panic.  They switched me to doxycycline_ but about once a month after that point I would have seizures again.  Of course_ Peace Corps maintained this was all psychosomatic (though I had traveled a great deal before and never had experienced anything remotely like it.)  Even now_ 5-1/2 years later_ I'll have similar episodes.  Lariam should not be on the market_ let alone privileged as an anti-malarial drug of choice.,F,30,1  months,1/15/2008,Lariam

I have travelled back to India many times afterwards and have NEVER taken anything after this horrible experience -  I would FAR PREFER to get malaria when travelling and in fact_ when you are in places like India the local docs are very skilled at recognizing malaria right away with first symptoms and very effective treatment.

116, 1, military deployment to Afghanistan,I had to run for a toilet the moment it hit my stomach.  I failed to do research on this pill before or during my deployment so didn't recognize two other effects until recently.,"I was in Afghansitan for 23 months with the Army and religiously took my pill every ""Mefloquine Monday.""  I thought the length of my deployment caused the anxiety that led to sleeplessness.  As I was in my mid-40s I was aware of short term memory loss and was concerned that this was the onset of Alzheimer's.  That scares me.  I've been back now 19 months as a contractor and haven't taken pill one.  I wish I had read the side effects and risked getting malaria_ especially that the area I was/am in is not even a threat area.  Malaria can be treated_ but the short term memory loss concerns the hell out of me.

I was given no alternative. 6 years later I am still suffering with short term memory problems and depression which I never had before I took it.

It saddens me to think that people are blindly given this medicine without being fully informed.  By all means_ ask your doctor about Doxycycline and Malarone.  I was not even made aware of these options and now my life has been affected in ways which I wrestle with several times a day.  I haven't given up completely...but am beaten down multiple times a day.  If God forbid you take this medicine_ do no take it with alcohol.  There was no warning on my prescription bottle and it put me in a dangerous situation one night.  This pill may some day be viewed as the asbestos of pharmaceuticals.,M,29,8  weeks,4/25/2007,Lariam

They made us take this in the Peace Corps and let me tell you_ the side effects only get worse over time. I like how they say that only people with history of mental disorders are suseptible_ well then most of Peace Corps Volunteers must be mental because so many of us had bad bad side effects from this. I would have to say that atleast 40-50% of us had some sort of psychological reaction to this drug and some of us have lasting effects! DO NOT TAKE THIS EVER!

It was much easier to take - only once a week as opposed to having to remember to take it at the same time each day. I didn't suffer any side effects at all.
