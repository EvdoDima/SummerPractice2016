1, 3, Anxiety/insomnia,Possible weight gain_ drowsiness_ confusion_ day after 'hang over',On a scale of 1-10 it was a 5 for my anxiety_ which later dropped to maybe a 2. It helped me sleep though.Its just the side and effects that got me.,F,38,2  months25MG,9/9/2015Email,Hydroxyzine hcl
2, 2, Itch from allergic skin reaction,I am prescribed this medicine to help me dealing with the severe itch from allergic skin reactions. It does not help with the itches. I am still suffering miserably. It does give me some drowsiness. Zyrtec seemed to work better to kill my itches. Also_ I woke up tw o days in a row with my eyes very swollen. Am I allergic to this drug on top of my skin condition? I am so desperate!  This drug makes you drowsy and sleepy_ but here I am awake at 3:30 am_ itching!,,F,56, 25 mg 2X D,2/22/2015,Hydroxyzine hcl
3, 2, CHRONIC ITCHING - UNKNOWN REASON,Drowsiness - No emotion,My doctor prescribed this for me two days ago.  I was hoping for a serious cure or at least something that could get me thru the day because I am miserable at work and home ALL DAY! After reading the comments I feel cheated.  Everyone is having success with the itching but I am not.  Maybe I need to give it a few more days to kick in because I need some serious relief.  I have tried gels_ creams_ benedryl_ and now this....and nothing works.  SIMPLY MISERABLE!,F,41,2  days25 5X D,5/22/2014,Hydroxyzine hcl
4, 4, Counteract Itch from Telaprevir,Made me a little drowsy_ but no significant side effects.,Used to treat initial itch and rash from taking Telaprevir. I found it effective_ but it eventually wore off and nothing worked. It's mainly the fault of Telaprevir_ so I'd say this drug was very effective.If you are undergoing Hep-C treatment and have questions_ please contact me.,M,26,4  weeks50 mg 2X D,5/16/2013Email,Hydroxyzine hcl
5, 4, Chronic Hives and swelling,Drowsiness,Would only work for a couple of weeks at first_ then would have to increase dosage. After several increases_ I became zombie-like. After a few years of experimenting_ I was able to bring the dosage down to one-half of a 10mg tablet at night by counter-acting with one 12.5mg Primatene tablet (ephedrine - no prescription needed) every morning. With this regimen_ my hives stay dormant with no drowsiness during the day.,M,61,30  years5mg 1X D,5/3/2013,Hydroxyzine hcl
6, 4, Eczema_ food allergies,extreme drowsiness; mild vertigo; cognitive difficulties,I've been taking hydroxyzine for food allergies and eczema since I was almost four years old. It never helped much with the itching_ but if I take it before I eat something I know I'm allergic to_ it kills any reaction that might have occurred. This is great_ because it allows me to still enjoy food that I love without having to worry about the reaction. The drowsiness is a big pain_ but oddly enough_ did not start until a few years ago. I've noticed that it's gotten somewhat better over time_ so I'm guessing it's just a phase. Either way_ it's no big deal since I only take it every now and then_ when the family decides to go out for seafood. I'd recommend it if you have food allergies as well_ but seek other options for skin conditions if the drowsiness is too much of a problem for you.,F,18,  1X AN,8/3/2012,Hydroxyzine hcl
7, 5, Anxiety,Felt drowsy about 30 minutes after taking 20 mg.  Flat affect.  Cognitive difficulties.,This drug_ combined with Xanax_ helped calm me down considerably.  People around me felt unnerved by my lack of facial expressions and emotional responses.  I felt like I was dependent on it in a short amount of time.  However_ I am not sure if that was simply because my stress levels were so high.,F,29,14  days10 mg 6X D,12/13/2011Email,Hydroxyzine hcl
8, 5, allergies - hives,none,Nothing else worked at all to control my hives until I was finally prescribed this two years ago. I take it as needed_ anywhere from 20-50mg per dose (depending on severity)_ and it works incredibly quickly. I tried it for a week several years ago_ at which point it made me very drowsy. However_ I stopped for several months and then tried again_ and now no drowsiness_ nausea_ or any other side effects whatsoever.,F,20,2  years20 - 50mg 1X D,7/19/2010,Hydroxyzine hcl
9, 1, Itchy rash,Extreme drowsiness_ confusion_ slow coordination.,This drug did nothing to help my itchiness.  The only thing it did was make me extremely sleepy!,F,32,2  days25mg 4X D,6/9/2010,Hydroxyzine hcl

11, 5, Itch - atopic dermatitis,Drowsy,Good stuff. My little green footballs always come through for me when I need them.,F,44,30  years,9/4/2007,Hydroxyzine hcl
12, 4, skin rash and itching,I took the first pill on an empty stomach_ in the middle of the day_ because most over the counter pills that are known to cause drowsiness usually do not cause me sleepiness. I was extremely nautious and vomited about a half hour later.  I took the 2nd pill later in the evening with a snack_ no nautiousness at all and slept like a rock_ (which has NEVER happened!) FOR ALMOST 12 HOURS!  I forced myself to get out of bed_ or else I could have easily slept longer!,I found that I was MUCH less itchy within about an hour_ and that it did help me get the sleep I much needed_ but the rest of the next day I was pretty drowsy.  Not suppose to be taken if you may become pregnant due to risk of birth defects if taken in early pregnancy. (unfortunately_ I did not know this and was actively trying to get pregnant_ and even told my Dr. of this.)  I took a 25 mg dose_ and will try cutting it in half tonight to see if it still works for the itching_ but doesn't make me sleep so long.,F,32, ,5/3/2007,Hydroxyzine hcl
13, 5, itchiness/allergens,nauseau at first; DO NOT use before consuming alcohol_ 1-2 drinks can make me intoxicated to the point of severe vomitting; sedation,This medication was what I had been searching for. I have bad allergies_ always sneezing itching_ etc. Had been using Allegra for years for common irritants_ but did nothing for my dermatological concerns. My ezcema was most severe on my legs_ behind the knees and at my worst point right before starting the Atarax covered my entire lower legs with thick_ dry_ itchy scabs. It also appears on the insides of my elbows and scalp. I was always given a cream_ then demanded an ointment - both of which came in perscriptions that would only last me a week at best - and finally_ upon a desperate visit to the other doctor in the practice he perscribed this for the itching_ and Singulair for my nasal allergies. MAGIC.I'm finally comfortable in my skin_ during times when I go without the hydroxyzine_ there is a NOTABLE difference in how ITCHY I am!!,F,18,1  years,1/16/2007Email,Hydroxyzine hcl
