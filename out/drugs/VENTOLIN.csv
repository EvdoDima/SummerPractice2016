4, 1, Asthma,Tastes like I'm coughing up paint fumes after usage.  Headaches_ muscle tremors_ dizziness.  And it DOESN'T work on my asthma much at all.  I'm worse the next day after using it.,Horrible_ useless_ this is a badly made inhaler.  It just plain doesn't work on my asthma.  Feels like it doesn't get into the lungs at all.  I have to double up on the puffs to feel anything and it still doesn't work right.  And it makes me worse the next day.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,F,45,10  years90mcg 4X D,1/11/2015Email,Ventolin

6, 3, Asthma,I started having major anxiety attacks and manic behavior.  Something I have never in my life experienced.  I became crazy jealous and lashed out to the people I loved the most and am afraid I may not be able to repair some relationships.,I was in danger from the asthma and some anxiety was related to the fact that I had been symptom free for 3 years after losing significant weight and controling my diet and exercise & was suddenly having trouble again.  My symptoms subsided after 24 or so hours without medication.,F,44,9  days90 mcg X 2 2X O,8/23/2013Email,Ventolin

9, 5, Reactive Airway Disease,Initially when I started_ it felt like I drank too many cups of coffee.  But over time my body adjusted to it and now have no side effects from it.,I seem to use it more in the winter.  Hardly ever in the spring and summer.  Really clears up any wheezing quickly.

Practically my whole body tremors_ I feel light headed_ jittery and almost paranoid. I can't handle it anymore. It has always helped me breathe but the side effects have become too intense for me.,,F,26,1  days90mcg,6/9/2012,Ventolin

16, 1, Have Bronchitis_ sinusitis,Due to bronchitis_ they offered me this pump. The first 2 days I took it seemed fine.When mixed with qvar_ I almost passed out_ lightheaded and immediately my arm hurt and leg all on my left side. I thought I as experiencing a stroke. I was really trembling and didn't know what to think of it? Doctor said try again _ maybe you held you breath too long after inhaling.Same thing happened all over again with qvar and ventolin.,My arm is still bothering me and heart-rate is irregular_ it has been 3 days now.Got off of it all. Never had athsma before and managing with parsley_ garlic_ honey_ and ginger to surpress my cough and give my lungs a break.I was on nasal med_ antibiotic_ and these pumps.I feel for you who ca not breath. I can't imaging life dependant on this pump. Plus I experienced major anxiety with it.,F,37,  1X D,10/3/2011Email,Ventolin
17, 4, Asthma,MASSIVE anxiety and mania if used longer than a few days in a row. I get jealous_ suspicious and have out of control rage at those I love the most and cant seem to stop being agitated and furious for sometimes days on end. I used to just think it was 'that time of month' but it is definitely from this.  I am over-sensitive to lots of poisons and have history of anxiety in the family anyway but this triggers it badly and I am so glad most people arent affected like this as it definitely saves lives.,Without it I would probably be dead but my manic attacks have almost killed me at times too (depression and thoughts of suicide once Ive alienated those I love because of my rage). If I only use it once or twice a week its a lifesaver but for any more than a couple of days in a row and Im a mess. I have to be VERY careful with it and only use it for emergencies and take my daily preventer's instead. This is hard because I try regularly to get off them because I dont feel 'right' while on them. I have had success being asthma free for a few years in between with perfect diet and exercise but thats very hard to maintain. Asthma is MUCH more debilitating than most poeople acknowledge. It has ruled my life for so long now and Im almost sure its just something we all have from pollutants in food/air/water. I wish you all luck <3,F,35,14  years 1X AN,9/13/2011Email,Ventolin
18, 3, Asthma,When I was a child it made me shaky_ and if I had to take a lot_ it would give me a headache and even make me vomit. When I reached my 20s the shakiness felt much more like intense panic and my heart beat so fast it felt like it would burst. I can't make myself take it anymore because it's such a frightening and distressing experience. I only need it when I have a cold_ but now I'll tolerate that feeling of sucking air through an itchy drinking-straw for days without daring to take Ventolin. Also_ my uncles and aunts all grew out of asthma after puberty (they mostly missed out on Ventolin as kids)_ but I never grew out of it and can't help wondering if the childhood Ventolin made it worse.,I'm sure it saved my life many times when I was a child and my asthma was worse than it is now. I used to feel like it was magic. As an adult I seem to have sensitised to it_ so I can't take it at all now. Bricanyl's the same with me - wish there was something else!,F,32,25  years 1X M,5/3/2011,Ventolin
19, 5, Asthma,Slight trembling of hands_ nervousness,Overall Ventolin has been a godsend. It has returned my breathing to normal many times when exercise and allergies have triggered potentially serious asthma reactions. Sometimes have mild side effects of some trembling after taking a dose_ but it is very mild and disappears soon.,F,31,20  years 1X AN,4/16/2011,Ventolin
20, 5, Asthma,Tremors_ Slightly spacey feeling in my head.,I have had asthma since I was 13 years old. I've been on numerous medications to try and control it_ and the only medication I've ever taken that as worked better than Ventolin is Xopenex. This medicine keeps me breathing_ and allows me to live a normal life. Thank God for this medicine. I can live with the skeletal reflexes (the tremors). We all have to live with them. This stuff literally gets me through my day sometimes.,F,26,5  years90mcg 2X D,1/18/2011,Ventolin

22, 4, asthma,shaking and weakness immediately_ especially in arms and legs_ slightly elevated heart rate (but my heart rate is usually low so within normal range)_ lightheadedness.  The following day i usually have a mild throat irritation.  It may also be giving me a mild eczema rash on my arms but since i mostly get asthma with exposure to perfumes or pollen_ these could be causing the rash instead.,because of the sore throat and feeling like i need to lie down for half an hour or so after using it_ i use my inhaler as little as possible_ but it does relieve the breathing issues remarkably well and i never go anywhere without it.,F,30,18  years100-200Î¼g 1X AN,7/22/2010Email,Ventolin
23, 4, Asthma,Tremors_ anxiety attacks,Look_ Ventolin gets the job done. I take a high dose with albuterol_ and I someimes get the most disturbing tremors_ they consume my entire upper body.  It scares the poeple I'm around_ and it scares me as well_ but the fact is I need it.  I was born with asthma_ so I don't get it easy_ we don't get it easy.  It works_ and the side effects are a small price to pay to keep me breathing.,F,15,2  years,1/17/2010,Ventolin
24, 5, Asthma,tremors_ adrenaline,"Sometimes this medication makes me feel a little weird_ but the bottom line is that it stops an asthma attack. It's also been great now that I have gotten the flu and have had my chest get tight a few times. I don't use it much. This is an ""in case of emergency"" drug and I wouldn't go anywhere without it.",M,17,5  years,10/14/2009,Ventolin
25, 4, asthma,I NOW HAVE BARRETS ESOPHOGUS DISEASE. AFTER MUCH RESEARCH_ HAVE FOUND THAT THIS MEDICATION RELAXED MY ESOPHAGAL SPHINCTER WHILE ALSO RELAXING MY BRONCHIAL PASSAGES. THIS MAY HAVE ALOOWED ACID FROM THE STOMACH TO THE ESOPHOGUS_ THEREBY PERMENANTELY SCARRING IT.,THE VENTOLIN WORKED WELL AT RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS_ BUT AT A COST NOW THAT IS NOT AFFORDABLE TO ME .  ALL DRUGS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. SOME TAKE YEARS TO REAR THEIR HEADS.,M,53,30  years,2/15/2009Email,Ventolin
26, 4, Asthma,None so far but sometimes doesn't always control attack,,F,31,22  days,2/11/2009,Ventolin
27, 5, Asthma,Jittery,Possibly because I started it young_ and was on it very regularly_ I didn't really get anxiety or even the jitters very much. I only seem to get jittery if I have the nebuliser version_ where you hold a mask over your face and breathe the vaporised stuff for several minutes. Then I get trembly_ but I really don't think it makes me anxious.So - the jitters probably won't bother you_ and either way_ the relief is pretty fantastic.,F,20,17  years,4/28/2008,Ventolin
28, 3, Asthma,As a child i suffered with asthma and was prescribed ventolin. I had uncontrollable tremors for hours after taking the drug As a child i truly hated it because it increased my heart rate so much that i could actually hear my heart beat in my chest I am 26 now and i still notice that my hands tremor slightly I believe that this is a result of this drug,like someone else said the tremors and increased heart rate was a small price to pay in order to breathe. Without it i may have died,F,26,7  years,11/9/2007,Ventolin
29, 5, ,Minimal side-effects.  Slightly-increased heart-rate and an increased sense of alertness_ lasting for about 15-minutes. Relief lasts between 4 and 6 hours.,I have the non-inflammatory varient of Asthma.  It is triggered almost exclusively by stress_ in my case.  There is a dogma_ amongst medical professionals_ which has it that all Asthma patients should be taking steroids to reduce their intake of short-acting Beta2-Agonists_ such as Ventolin.  My experience of steroid treatment is that it induces psychosis in me_ driving-up my stress levels beyond anything acceptable_ and to the point where my Ventolin consumption rises above my customary 2 - 4 single inhalations_ per day.  I have managed my Asthma with Ventolin since the product was first made available.  I have never developed a resistance to it_ nor found it to bring me anything other than almost instant relief.  I had bronchitis_ last year_ and the Doctor insisted on prescribing me a variety of increasingly-potent steroid inhalers.  Each produced degrees of confusion or outright psychosis in me_ along with 24-hour bouts of hives_ plus increased breathlessness. Recovery only began wh,M,52,35  years,10/20/2007,Ventolin
30, 5, Asthma,None. Same for my sister_ and she's been taking it even longer than me (I'm 17 and I started taking it age 3).,Works well_ I'm very pleased with it_ never let me down. I more commonly use Bricanly inhaler now_ doctor changed medication when I had a bad bout of asthma_ but it always did the job for myself and my sister.,M,17,14  years,6/2/2007,Ventolin
31, 4, Asthma,Hyperactivity and faster heart beat when my son resumes medication after not using it for several months.  He takes 1-2 puffs 3 times a day during spring and early fall.,My son acts like he has ADHD when he initially starts medication.  He has difficulty sitting in his chair.  He seems to have a faster heart beat in gym class. Fortunately_ the side effects disappear in a week after restarting medication.,M,8,3  years,5/27/2007,Ventolin
32, 5, Asthma,Shaking and impatience,It's a stimulant.  I hate how jittery it makes me_ but it a small price to pay for being able to breath.  It almost always works right away.,M,28,20  years,4/10/2007,Ventolin

35, 1, Astma,"Rapid heart-beat. Also I feel that although it gives an ""instant fix""_ overall Ventolin makes my condition worse & I have to take more steroids & it takes longer to recover from an attack. I manage my condition much better without it.","Ventolin mistakenly gives patients the feeling that they are instantly ""cured"". This is dangerous_ as they then continue with energetic activity. The best thing to do is to rest as much as possible to allow your body to recover. Other drugs_ such as Becotide_ work more slowly_ but the results last longer. Using Becotide_ with resting as much as possible during an attack_ means I have less attacks & recover much more quickly. Ventolin is very dangerous_ as it quickly builds up a dependece_ which means high profits for the drug companies_ but is very bad for the asthma sufferer.",F,46,10  days,9/29/2006Email,Ventolin
36, 2, asthma,terrible palpitations,I've been taking ventolin since I was a kid_ but it stopped working for me.
