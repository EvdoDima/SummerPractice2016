0, 1, For my bones,I took reclast July 25th 2016 by iv infusion and the next day I run fever of 104.2 and seizure .and my blood pressure was so low and had to be taken to the hospital and after that on the fourth day my jaw bones on the right side of my face felt like someone had taken a pair of pliers and was twisting my jaw bones out.was in terrible pain and the outside of my face and my glands in my neck had swollen out like a Ballon in a matter of mintutes .Had to be rushed back to the hospital again with that going on and low blood pressure again and now I stay so tired out with no energy.,My doctor says it was a counter reaction from the reclast and he doesn't recommend taking it again . But they failed to tell me the side effects of that medication before giving it to me and now I have a year to go not knowing what still may happen to me.I strongly don't recommend this medication and I'm very dissatisfied.,F,54,1  days,8/17/2016Email,Reclast

2, 1, Osterporosis,Woke up the morning after taking the drug with back pain and sub sternal chest pressure. I had shortness of breath. I took the drug in June and have had continuing chest pressure _ heart flutters and shortness of breath on exertion. Just had abnormal stress test after having no cardiac disease. Hair is thinning and vision is worse. About to schedule an eye exam. I have had weight gain in spite of no change in my diet or exercise program. Some days I am so fatigued all I can do is sit.,I will NEVER take this drug again or any osteoporosis drug. My body feels poisoned. I was perfectly healthy before taking this drug.,F,63,1  days 1X O,8/1/2016Email,Reclast
3, 1, Osteoporosis,I experienced terrible chest pain _ could not even turn over in bed or get up(almost passed out from the pain when my husband tried to help me)_ as well as fever_  headache_ and severe  joint pain - these are  minor side effects???,I am now on day 5 following my first (and definitely LAST) infusion for treatment of osteoporosis.  My chest pain has decreased and I no longer have a headache_ but the joint pain is worse - it's like the medication that was supposed to avoid the danger of future bone fracture turned me into an old woman overnight.  My hip joints and knees don't just ache - I can barely shuffle along and I have no strength at all in my left hand. The minor side-effects like  fever and jaw pain were something I could have lived with if they only lasted a day or two_ but these other symptoms have changed my life and   I have no idea when they will go away or if I will be able to resume  activities like gardening and hiking.  I wish I had discovered this website beforehand but hope my warning will help others.  It infuriates me that my doctor did not even discuss the various options even when I questioned him - just said they all can have side effects and that this once-a-year infusion was my best option.,F,72,1  days 1X D,7/22/2016,Reclast

12, 1, Osteoperosis,I had an infusion of Reclast on 1/13/16 at 1_ by 11pm that night my back started to hurt me. Shortly thereafter I was in excruciating back pain and could not move. I have never felt so much pain. I was completely debilitated. I could not stand up on my own. I couldnt put any weight on my body. I was very thirsty. My doctor said I had a severe reaction to the Reclast.When my doctor recommended I get the Reclast infusion I didnt give it much thought because my mother had had it done with no side effects.  I was not told of the side effects by my doctor or anyone at Quest lab. The only thing I remember Quest lab being concern about was that hadnt received a copy of my lab results. I had to wait till they were faxed a copy. I was reassured that my kidneys were fine and I should have no problem with Reclast. I went to see my doctor the next day. He said I was having a severe reaction to the Reclast and prescribe Hydrocodon-Acetaminophen and said to take Benadryl.,I did not know Reclast stays in your system for at least a year (hence the annual treatment). I was told the Reclast went into the bones. This means I am stuck with the drug and its side effects for as long as its in my system. It is in my body for a year_ doing its damage.

I was told in the hospital that it was due to reclast. Now I am trying to recuperate after more than 4 months. My right femur is still not healed and the orthopedic doctor told me to be patient. I was never told by Dr. Richard Pritchard of Huntington Valley Pa. of the possible side effects. He told me it would be beneficial for strengthening my bones. Obviously it did the opposite. Reclast should be taken off the market.

I took 2 extra strength Tylenol and wend to sleep early.  By 3:30 am_ I woke up with severe body aches and low grade fever.   Took more Tylenol.  All the next day_ in severe discomfort.  My fever never went past 100.4 and I had no nausea.    I am on day 3 and feeling better (fingers crossed).    I switched from Tylenol to Advil due to the doses limitations for Tylenol.  Only 4_000 mil per 24 hours.   Was not enough to make me comfortable.    My Doctor did advise me beforehand the potential flu-like side effects.   I am truly sorry for everyone who has had such adverse effects.   I am still waiting to see what tomorrow brings....hopefully no pain.,If your skin hurts_ that is most likely caused by a fever.

24, 1, Severe osteoporosis,First year of receiving Reclast I woke up the next morning and found that 3 of my fingernails had totally lifted off the  bed of the nail.  Should of been a warning not to use.  Last year I received my second dose of Reclast.  Two weeks to the day after receiving an the infusion I developed an abscess in my mouth.  My last tooth on the left side of my jaw had fractured.  I had to have that removed and then developed osteonecrosis of my jaw.  This has been very painful.  It took almost a year for the exposed bone to finally fall off (that happened in May of 2015).  My jaw bone is now becoming exposed again and I have ended up losing 3 teeth.  I assumed I could get implants.  Because my jaw bone has become exposed again I am not a candidate for implants.  So this year 2015 I thought ok I don't have to have Reclast due to having osteonecrosis so I am in the clear.  This would have been the 3rd year in a row if I had received it but I did not get Reclast this year.  I was standing and iron,The trauma surgeon came in and asked me if I took Fosamax or drugs like that.  I had previously taken Fosamax for 5 years in the early 2000.  I had stopped due to side effects.  This is why I was on Reclast.  I then found out this type of fracture is very rare and usually happens in the 3rd year after starting Reclast.  I would have never used Reclast had I known this.  I am now on Forteo.  Please do not use any bisphosphonate drugs - Reclast_ Fosamax_ Boniva are the only ones I can think of right now.   I still am non-weight bearing on my leg because my fracture is not healing as fast as it would normally due to my osteoporosis.  Also my leg is now about 1/2 inch shorter than my other leg.,F,61,2  years5mg 1X O,8/27/2015Email,Reclast

28, 1," Diagnosed with ""severe"" osteoporosis",I had my infusion in December 2010. That night my legs hurt so bad I was shrieking all night_ I couldn't sit_ stand_ or lie down. Two weeks later I came down with a bronchial infection and was so ill and weak I couldn't get up off the sofa for weeks. The infection took 7 months to clear up. By then I'd lost 40 more pounds and now weigh 92-3. At the same time the I started having hideous muscle spasms that came on suddenly sometimes 3 times a day_ and lasting anywhere from 3-18 hours. I could see the muscles up my shins and along the sides of my legs moving like live animals under the skin and they were as hard as rocks.  My feet and hands would curl up into weird positions and I had no voluntary control over them. All this was incredibly painful; several times I had to go to the ER where they put me on IV Demerol and Valium. My arms lost all strength; I could barely sit upright for 2-3 hours a day. My arms hurt from shoulder to fingertops 24/7 at a range of 7-10 at all times. I've had UTIs constantly because I'm not able to get anything out when I need to pee. Before the infusion I was an athlete racing motocross for 23 years  and worked out daily. All that time I'd had plenty of crashes on that motorcycle yet never broke a bone including a hard crash 1 month before the infusion. Four months afterwards I was standing in my backyard talking to a neighbor and when I took one step to go inside_ I heard a loud crack and fell to the ground in agony with my ankle snapped in two pla,Although all bisphosphonates work the same way_ Reclast is far more dangerous in my opinion because once you've had that infusion you cannot stop the effects for at least 10 years.,F,58,1  days,6/24/2015Email,Reclast

They did_ numerous labs_ urinalysis_  chest xray and gave me IV pain meds and medsfor nausea.  The doc came in and said all test came back fine and said my symptoms were from the Reclast.  He was about to discharge me when I told the nurse I felt as if I had a fever.  She checked it_ and it was 102.4.  Then came the vomiting.

75, 1, OSTEOPOROSIS,I was advised by my OB/GYN that since Actonel and Boniva were not working AND since I suffer from GERD that the RECLAST annual infusion was the PERFECT answer. My 3rd annual infusion was March 2012. I experienced slight flu like symptoms BUT the cummulative effects of this medicine have now taken its toll. I broke 2 bones in my foot in November 2012 and six months later there is ABSOLUTELY NO HEALING OR UNION. I now found out -- Reclast will make your bones more dense but it also stops new bone formation. WOW! this means that the 6 months I have been trying to heal my body is fighting itself. I cannot have surgery because my bones will not heal. I am wearing a bone stimulating machine that costs over $5_000 but the Reclast has stopped my foot from healing. AND the PAIN is intense!!!

76, 3, Osteoporosis,I've had two Reclast infusions (1 per year_ about 1/2 an hour each)_ and after the first one (even though I did drink more water_ and take Advil as instructed)_ I was blindsided by nasty flu-like (body aches etc.) side effects almost immediately.  I was told that might happen_ but I still wasn't prepared for how quickly I felt awful! The flu-like symptoms lasted a few days and went away.  After the 2nd infusion_ I didn't have any side effects.  But now that I've read other Reclast user's comments_ I'm going to talk to my Dermatologist and Primary Care doctor about my thinning hair & possible connection to using Reclast.  I thought it was just part of the aging process....,My bone density scores had pretty much been in free fall mode_ in spite of using Boniva for 4 years (both monthly pills and quarterly infusions)_ so Reclast was the next option offered to me.  A Dexa scan done a year after my first Reclast infusion showed that my bone density decline had stopped.  I need to have another Dexa Scan in a few months (which will be a year after the 2nd Reclast infusion)_ so I'll know more then.

This is my third day after the IV and the pain in my neck. at the base of the bulbs on the back of the head and the acute headaches have diminished. [not completely gone] The pain in my spine_ hips_ even rib cage is still there. The general feeling of malaise is strong. Just getting out of bed is most difficult. Forget any work_ appointments_ or housework.My precious husband  asked what he could do for me.  I said ' Just shoot me!' I  wonder what it will continue to do to me. And I feel for the poor animals they put through torture to get this sorry stuff to market.,DON'T DO IT!Here is an idea.

107, 1, Severe Osteoporosis,About 12 hrs after getting a 20 minute infusion_ I awoke with the worst chills I have ever experienced_ debilitating pain in every joint_ muscle and bone from my head to my toes.  Now 7 days later_ I wake up to a different area of my body in pain.  My fingers_ my  toes_ my hips_ back_ arms and legs_ but the most debilitating is the base of my skull and my neck.  I had 2 consecutive compression fractures of the spine within 3 mos. and the pain was not this bad_ I also knew it would eventually mend_ so there at least was a light at the end of the tunnel. With this you don't know what horror is coming next.  There should be a class action suit for all of those that had a bad reaction.

Right now I have severe muscle pain in my right leg.Day 1 after IV bone pain in shoulders. Day 2 night: My right leg started in tingle_ thinking I must have sat on it too long_ I wasn't worried. Within hours the muscle and bone pain was horrible. Like a 8 out of 10 pain scale.I was awake most of night. I somehow managed to go to work. Day 4: That night was a repeat of night before_ except the pain I experienced was so bad_ I literally was rolling on couch and then floor in pain. Pain started 7 pm until 2 am!!!!!! Had to miss new cleaning client. I have Vicoden 5/500 for other pain I ocassionly have_ took one_ it didn't EVEN TOUCH THE PAIN!!! Day 6: I was able to work_ but EXACTLY @ 7 pm",POISON!!!!

Research this drug is a lie!!!! It is laundry detergent amd used in herbicides_ do you really want this in your body??? Also once you take it there is no antidote or reversal.  The ER doctors said that people were crazy for taking this drug.. They aren't crazy_ just trusting. The Doctors and Drug Company Novartis should be called to task..

124, 1, Osteoporosis diagnosis,Had infusion of Reclast one year ago. Symptoms of severe pain in deep tissue and bone began 3 days after and continue now_ one year after infusion. Twelve days after the infusion_ I ended up in the hospital for a month with extensive blood clots in both lungs_ a severe heart attack and lower G.I. bleeding. The doctor's attending me all told me it was a miracle I lived through these medical conditions. I was relatively healthy and active before this infusion and now_ I am unable to enjoy my life doing the things I used to enjoy.  Things as simple as trying to pick up my 18 month old granddaughter are nearly impossible for me now. Prior to this infusion_ I regularly took care of this beautiful granddaguther. Now_ I am unable to attend to her without the help of my husband.,I wouldn't recommend Reclast to anyone. I feel I wasn't informed of any of the long term side effects by my physician at the time. I did read the information he gave me from the Drug Rep._ but that_ as I know now_ of course was all bias.
