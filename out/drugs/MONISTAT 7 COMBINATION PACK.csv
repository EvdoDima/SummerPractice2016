1, 2, yeast infection,I'm very sensitive in this area. Anyway_ I got a yeast infection and tried both the 3 day and 7 day Monistat...Horrible burning and itching for HOURS! I finally went to the doctor after I started to swell so badly down there and my doctor said I was probably alergic and to call her for now on so I can take the Diflucan pill.
