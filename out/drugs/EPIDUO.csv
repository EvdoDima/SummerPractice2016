0, 2, Acne & Anti-Aging Reasons,After going to see a dermatologist_ i was taken off of Retin A (which at the time was doing just about nothing positive for my skin and had my face and eye area very irritated and dried out)and was prescribed to start using Epiduo instead. I sincerely hoped that this medication would be a better alternative. But_ unfortunately_ I had to end up getting off of it after a short period of using it. It did help with my acne. However_ my skin just cannot handle having benzoyl peroxide being used on it daily for an extended period of time at all. My face and eye area started to become very dried out and so irritated_ to the point_ where I had to end up getting off of it. My dermatologist then prescribed for me to start using Differin (adapalene) Gel 0.3% instead. And_ that is what I am currently using on my face at the present.,The cons far outweigh the pros_ when it comes to using this stuff. Which is why_ I do not recommend it at all.,F,,45  days45g 1X D,2/22/2015,Epiduo
