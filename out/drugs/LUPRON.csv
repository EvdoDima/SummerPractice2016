0, 2, Prostate Cancer,1) Total loss of libido and sexual function within the first month-persisting for several months post-treatment; 2) Shrinkage of testicles and penis; 3) Breast growth; 4) Brutal hot flashes (2-3 times per hour_ 24/7_ as if your internal thermostat has gone haywire--lasting for another four months post-treatment; 4) Liver damage (GGT spiked to double upper limit w/o alcohol intake--slowly recovering with aid of milk thistle); 5) Cholesterol spiked 50% under same diet and daily exercise--slowly normalizing; 6) Onset of anemia with careful diet and daily exercise--slowly normalizing; 7) Vision impairment; 8) Sudden onset of fatigue--as if I could not stay awake for one more mile; 9) Much slower beard growth and loss of body hair; 10) Poor sleep at night and general lethargy during the day.,Am not suggesting_ as many_ that this drug be banned. Some people really need this type of drug. I am simply asking that the manufacturer and information sources accurately reflect common side-effects and issue proper warnings.,M,59,6  months 2X O,8/16/2016,Lupron

2, 5, Prostate Cancer,Hot Flashes like you can't believe. Sex life is gone. Joint Pain. No Energy_ 5 lbs of bacon slapped onto your lower stomach. Armpit Hair Gone (no biggie). It's a miracle to get 2.5 hours of sleep without waking in a sweat. One episode of double vision for 5 minutes that may or may not be caused by Lupron_ who knows?,I had high Gleason scores but non-metastasized cancer. In 3 months my PSA went from 5.7 to .2_ so I have to say it works. But the doctors want me on it for at least a year if not longer. My next shot is coming up and I'm in the middle of 9 weeks of radiation. There is no way in hell I will take another shot of this poison beyond the next one. 9 months is plenty of time_ I don't think doctors appreciate or care about how devastating this poison is on a human being. If you've got stage 4_ I understand_ but high Gleasons without mets that respond so quickly_ should in my opinion_ get treated for a shorter time. Good luck to any that need to be on this.,M,64,6  months 1X O,5/22/2016,Lupron

Si and hip joint pain is chronic beginning with the Lupron injections and still continues now (1-1/2 years after the last injection).,Lupron has ruined my quality of life.  I suffer chronic pain every hour of every day.  Before Lupron I was fit_ healthy_ and vivacious.  I have been abused and robbed by this poison.

I took 1 month injection for 2 months then a 4 month injection. After two months_ my PSA went from 60 down to 0.4. I remained very active and my energy level never decreased either. I am also juvenile diabetic and Lupron did NOT effect my diabetes. I would highly recommend Lupron.  It had very little side effects for me and left NO permanent damage like chemo and radiation do.

7, 3, Endometriosis,Migraines_ severe tiredness_ weight gain_ changes in mood_ nausea,This drug helped my endometriosis almost instantly. I was in constant severe pain all the time. I had pelvic pain and more often than not felt extremely bloated and uncomfortable. Lupron has helped in that regard; however_ the side effects do stink. I already suffer from migraines - this drug makes them worse - so much so that I might have to discontinue after this month because I'd rather have the endo pain than a migraine. In the beginning_ I felt nauseous all the time_ that has decreased. I've gained about 5 lbs in only 2 months. For the most part_ my moods are fine_ but I've been more down lately. Not sure if it is related to the lupron or not. Still might continue with it_ but it is not for everyone.

Insomnia lasting 1 to 2 weeks as little as 1 to 2 hours of sleep a night. I am now on a six-month Lupron shot.The onset of my symptoms are more gradual and not as extreme as the three-month shot.

18, 2, Stage 2 Prostate Cancer,Hot flashes (up to 2X per hour)--causing poor sleep; loss of libido_ weight gain (+10 lbs)_ breast growth_ reduction in physical endurance--even with weight training_ 40% higher cholesterol; high ALP and VERY HIGH (130) GGT--indicating liver problems.,Took two 3-month Lupron shots as part of proton beam therapy (two months prior_ two months during_ two months post radiation). Was glad to get the first one to stall progression of Stage 2 prostate cancer_ but dreaded getting the second one. No apparent effect from the first shot during the first three weeks (was beginning to wonder if they gave me the right shot)_ then libido started to drop fast in the fourth week and frequent (up to 2X per hour) hot flashes started--which are a nuisance in the daytime_ but debilitating for sleep at night. The second 3-month Lupron shot timed out three months ago_ but the hot flashes are unabated_ libido is coming back very slowly_ and it is very hard to shed the ten pounds I gained while on the drug. The combination of proton treatment and Lupron has resulted in my last three post-treatment PSA tests coming in at .1 (5.4 pre-treatment). My latest lab report_ however shows a 40% increase in cholesterol and a very high GGT reading of 130 (65 is the upper limit)_ meaning my liver has been damaged. I had no idea when I agreed to take the drug that liver damage would be part of the deal and the hot flashes and loss of libido would continue for at least several months past the end of treatment.,M,58,6  months 1X O,9/3/2015,Lupron
19, 1, Fibroids on Uterus,Only 1 side effect was noticed and that was with the 3rd injection of Lupron.  My hair started falling out in the shower by the handfuls and continued to fall out for 1 year following injections prior to my Hysterectomy.  My surgeon never told me about this side effect_ and if he had_ I would have refused to take it_ regardless of him wanting to shrink the Fibroids before surgery.  The hair loss has been devastating.  I once had the longest_ thickest_ most healthiest head of hair.  My surgery was in September of 2011 and my hair has still not returned.  I have to wear hair pieces_ due to the shortness in my hair in my bangs_ and the length as well.  I had bald spots everywhere.  I feel embarrassed now_ and not attractive at all.  DO NOT recommend this for any woman out there.  You will regret it.  I have tried everything_ but nothing has worked so far to bring my hair back.,,F,50,3  months 1X M,8/24/2015,Lupron

22, 5, For severe endometriosis,Hot flashes here and there. Occasional night sweats_ a few head aches. And some staining.,This was my third round of lupron since I was 25.  I've had two healthy children in between the second and third round. It helped greatly with the pain and I had normal periods till after my second son. My endometriosis came back full force. Started lupron again in August of 2014 and have been great ever since.

23, 3, Fibroid Tumors,Hot flashes_ mild headaches_ dry skin_ small rash on arm,I admit I was terrified of getting the three month shot after reading the side effects that others were having.  I am entering my third month and so far so good.  I do experience the hot flashes but they are nothing like I was expecting.  Just a warm flush and it's over.  There was some pain at the shot site but that eventually went away.  I have experienced headaches but nothing life altering. I am a marathon runner so I can't tell if my aches and joint pain are from the medication or the running.  Either way it's bearable.  I normally don't write reviews but I felt it was important to give a moderate view to someone who may be researching this drug.  One word of advice would be to inform family and friends that you are taking this medication so that they are aware of any strange mood swings.  I even told my boss.  So far I haven't had any but I have had a few funny moments of memory loss.

25, 4, endometriosis,None so far,I can't say anything about helping with pain_ because for the most part I never felt any pain.  What my doctor thought was that I had 3 cysts with endometriosis.  It would be a simple laproscopy to remove them and the endo_ because I never had heavy bleeding or severe cramping. When he opened me up it was a horror show.  Stage IV endo with everything stuck together. I ended up needing a laparotomy. He could not believe I functioned with normally. Because I have Epilepsy add-back is not an option.  I'm praying I won't end up with horrible side effects_ but after seeing the pictures of my insides I know I need to put my big girl pants on and deal with it.,F,42,2  months3.75 mg,5/23/2015,Lupron

My cycles have stopped now_ though_ and I'm not experiencing grave bloating and pain like I had been.,While I am no longer having severe menstrual cycles and pain like I was experiencing_ the hot flashes have been difficult to manage. Within the last two weeks my mood has been horrible_ I am experiencing severe nausea/dizziness and the hot flashes are becoming intolerable. My lack of sleep is definitely not helping my mood and my energy level is at an all-time low. While I am not experiencing as much pain during intercouse_ I am still feeling some discomfort.

It's important to read up on it and to know what to expect before you start - your doctor may not tell you.  A very important thing to know is that things will get worse before they get better.  Any hormonal symptoms will get worse for the first two weeks after the first (and often 2nd) shot.   There will be periods of significant_ serious depression during the first month or two.

My doctor put me on Lupron for 6 months_  but have stated that some people could only take it for 3 months due to side effects. He has also put me on Northindrone to relieve some of the hot flashes. I have feel like a different person since I been taken Lupron. My aggrivation and loss of patience in handling things is very short. I feel as though it has not helped with any of my symptoms at all. I have read that it does take 6 weeks before your symptoms get any better. I hope this is the case for me because taking this med is for the birds!

Wish I could turn back time as Gyno strongly urged/recommended 11.25mg shots taken 2xs over 6 months after my 2nd endo surgery (2011 & 2008).  First shot in June 2011/ 2nd shot Sept 2011 started feeling horrible immediately but thought all would be well by Dec 2011 when shot wore off.  Period never really came back & felt horrible for months.  Gyno told me no big deal that my period stopped due to my age and  I was probably menopausal now.  When I mentioned other side effects (other than normal menopausal ones) she told me it wasn't from the Lupron shot.  Until I took the Lupron shot I NEVER missed a period since I was 12 years old; always regular until the shot!  After starting on thyroid medication_ period finally came back in August 2013 (normal).

This is on top of the hot flashes and feeling exhausted and such.,I was not warned about the terrible side effects. I would have chosen not to do the Lupron_ if I had.

You may get some temporary pain relief for endo but Lupron causes permanent bone pain and other injuries.  Lupron does NOT help you to get pregnant.  Lupron shuts down your ovaries.  Lupron does not cause a temporary state of menopause; it actually lowers your estrogen level to zero as if you were 100 years old.  You will suffer the injuries of an elderly person.

We used to get a lot of Nuns (worked at a Catholic hospital)--who were in convent from age 17--and some were bent almost in half from spinal osteo.

I am sure everyone is different but I have had none of the horrible side effects some people have experienced. The thing that concerned me the most was my weight gain_ no offense to everyone else but I took control and stopped the weight gain. First I got on the Add Back prescription_ doubled my water consumption_ and switched up my normal work out routine.  I joined Crossfit and I am smaller then I was before the shot.

I have debated for the last two months on whether I want to get the next shot. Since I don't know if it was the Lupron or the surgery that helped my original pain_ it is hard to decide whether or not I'm willing to risk stopping it. The lack of a sex drive is causing serious strain on my relationship_ and the other side effects are driving me absolutely crazy but not crazy enough to go back to the way I felt before.

But the only problem I've had is sleeping through the night.  I waver between hot and cold all night and wake up every couple of hours.  Other than that_ I'm fine.  No hot flashes_ no mood swings_ no weight gain.  I exercise regularly and watch what I eat normally_ so it hasn't been a problem.  Even better_ I do believe the medication shrunk my fibroids a little.  Enough so that my doctor can remove them laparoscopically in a couple of weeks.

133, 4, Endometriosis,Headaches_ Hot Flashes_ night sweats_ weight gain,I took the last shot of my 6 month treatment (1 shot/mo) of Lupron in November. I read a LOT of horror stories online prior to taking the drug_ but decided that personally_ I needed to try it because the benefits could have out weighed the side effects. For me_ that was a smart decision. I was in such severe pain. I was on continuous birth control_ I had surgery_ I took narcotic pain meds_ I had cystoscopies and was on the IC diet for months. To say the least_ I had investigated other options. I will not down-play the side effects. They are not pleasant. But compared to what I was living with_ they are a walk in the park. If you are having mild discomfort and pain from endo_ or other issues_ think twice before taking this drug. The side effects will probably seem horrific if that is the case. But for me_ I will take all those side effects and an extra 30 lbs over the pain and disruption endo was causing in my life. It may be short lived now that the shots are over_ but I would do it again if needed and if it will mean keeping all of my organs necessary to conceive. The add-back therapy is a must to keep the worst of the side effects at bay.  My doctor was thorough in explaining my choices_ and I made an informed one.

But no side effects until the 3rd month I got the injection my doctor asked if I had any side effects I said no. The very next day I experienced all of the above.

The other weight I gained was semi related to it from increased appetite related to stress from the side effects and school. I had a laparascopic procedure done in March 2011 and the doctor said it was a mess in there my ovary was wrapped around my ureter in scar tissue and it was all over my colon_ I have adhesions everywhere from endometriosis and I have never had any previous surgery. My ovary now is finally not tender and back to normal size! So my story is a complete success_ the Lupron did it's job!

The lap did not help as much as they thought it would_ I was still bed-ridden with pain. The Lupron has helped to ease the majority of the pain_ my biggest qualms with it are the mood swings and forgetfulness. My worst mood swings were generally right after my shot. I notice that I tend to get angry far quicker than before and my patience is short_ but now that I am aware of it I try to keep it in check. The depression is difficult to deal with because my fiance is deploying next month. Though the side effects are unpleasant I have not been in tremendous pain like I was before. I did extensive research before taking Lupron and I reccomend that everyone do that (with any medication).

152, 1, Pain with intercourse/ endometriosi,SEVERE DEPRESSION_ night sweats_ hot flashes_ neck pain,I work in an OB/GYN office. I had been diagnosed with endometriosis causing my pain with intercourse three years ago. I was taking continuous OCP's and the pain was tolerable. Then the pain level statrted to increase. I was considering a hysterectomy_ and my doctor convinced me to try Lupron. At first I thought it was a gift from God. ALL my pain was gone I felt great. Never so happy in my life_ for about a month. Then over the next month I started to feel more and more depressed. I got my thrid shot and had a complete breakdown mentally. I almost ended up in the hospital.Severe episode of anger outburst threatened to kill my boyfriend_ kill myself.... followed by a two hour crying spell. If my boyfriend hadnt been here I dont know what would have happened. I have NEVER had any other episodes of depression or anger issues prior to this medication. My PCP took me out of work and I am currently on Estrogen repalcement to try and counteract the effects of the lack of estrogen caused by the Lupron to see if I can bring my mood back to normal. I am feeling a little better. I will not be having any more injections_ I am only hoping that after this month it will be mostly out of my system and my estrgen levels will return to normal.  I am also having very severe neck pain and after reading some other posts on here now believe that is also from the Lupron as well. Be very careful if you decided to use this treatment.

154, 5, endometriosis,when taking the progestin_ I only got hot flashes during the night_ occasional headaches_ and horrible mood swings.  The irritablity was hard to bear for me and everyone around me.  I talked to my doctor we decided hot flashes are better than irritablity.  So_ I stoped with the progestin and just let Lupron do it's thing.  I got hot flashes a lot... but really_ it's bearable.  Annoying_ but bearable.  It makes it hard to sleep a whole night through_ so I'm tired during the day.  All in all_ the positive effects of Lupron DEFINITELY outweigh the negaive.

158, 5, endometriosis,The only side effect I had was hot flashes.,I have stage 4 endometriosis. Since I was 15 years old my periods have been nightmares. Awful pain throughout my whole body and migraines. I have had two laparoscopic surgeries removing cysts on both of my ovaries and as much endometriosis as possible. I had been trying to get pregnant for the past three years. My only hope was Lupron. I had tried everything else first because I was scared of the side effects that I was reading about with Lupon. The only side effect I had was hot flashes. I did Lupon for 6 months. After not having my period for 7 months_ I finally started my period back up again with little to no pain.

160, 4, Endometriosis,Weight gain_ fatigue_ vaginal dryness_ headache after first couple of shots,I promised myself I would write about my experience after completing my injections b/c I was absolutely horrified by some of the posts people wrote on this website. While I feel terrible for those who have experienced awful side effects_ I have to say that this is not the norm. I belive the benefits far outweigh the risks. The worst of my pain was in my bowels. Birth control had masked my symptoms for years_ but when I went off to try to get pregnant_ it got really bad about 6-12 months out. (And I wasn't getting pregnant.) My periods were awful and extremely heavy. Bowel movements had become frightening. The laproscopic surgery went well and I started lupron about 2 months later. The first shot gave me an awful headache and I had cramps for about 2 days afterwards. After than I never had any major problems. I gained about 10 lbs during my 6 months on the shot. (I have never felt so hungry in my life!) I took the add-back progesterine pill_ and I did not have any hot flashes. Overall_ I feel a whole lot better than I did. I still get some pains now and again that tell me the endometriosis is still in there_ but it's not like what it was. It took exactly 2 months from my last shot to get my period. I'm hopeful that the results will last long enough for me to get pregnant. Bottom line: If you're suffering and need to buy yourself some time to try to get pregnant or put off a hysterectomy_ you might want to think about trying lupron. Best of luck!,F,31,6  monthsdepot 1X M,8/20/2011Email,Lupron

Then my insurance began to cover the 3 month injection and the side effect worsened. I am in month 2 of the 3 month shot and the hot flashes are more frequent and now I am itchy EVERYWHERE. The minute I am slightly warm_ I start itching. It's the summer and I can't enjoy outdoor activities because of the itchiness. My husband and kids are freezing because I leave the air on constantly. However_ the horrible pain I had with my period is gone because after month 2 on Lupron_ my periods went away. I haven't had too many mood swings_ but I have very bad headaches. I don't have much of a sex life as I am not interested at all. I am hoping that will go away once the medicine is stopped.

However_ after being on this drug for 3 months_ I must say Lupron is a God send.  The worst side effects of this drug are the hot flashes but they are manageable.  Two weeks after taking the injection I had an extemely heavy period.  Each month after that they were extremely light barely a period at all.  My advise to someone considering taking Lupron is to reseach it_ pray over it and do what is best for you.  I am extremely happy I decided to take this drug.  I had a myomectomy 3 weeks ago and now I am on my way to recovery.  I am still having the hot flashes though.

DO NOT be scared!  This drug changed my life for the better.  Drs said that it was either Lupron or a bowel resection (after already having lap. surgery done- the Endo was in my intestines & could not simply be excised).  I finally chose Lupron & after 6 months I am now pain free (relief started at 3 months).  It is a million times better than living in pain or on pills!

167, 4, Possible Endometriosis,Occasional hot flush_ breast size increase,I was asked to try Zoladex injections by the gynaecologist as he suspects I have endo. I have all the symptoms however only have small adhesions on the ligaments at the bottom of the uterus. There is no other sign of the endo. I tried tri-cycling the contraceptive pill which worked for a few months as I didn't experience pain mid-cycle but then the usual pains and swelling returned and the last period was that bad that I was about to ask for a hysterectomy! I had 1 x Zoladex injection and although there was no endo pain the side effects were horrendous. I suffered insomnia_ nausea_ hot flushes. I am seeing the gynaecologist privately and he had written to my GP to ask that they perform the remaining injections. GP told me that they would use Prostap instead of Zoladex and the 2nd injection was therefore Prostap. Since then I have experienced no pain whatsoever_ the insomnia and nausea have disappeared and I only occasionally have a hot flush. I saw the gynaecologist a couple of weeks after the 3rd injection (so 2nd Prostap) and he is really pleased that I am not experiencing pain and has suggested I continue for up to 18 months. I will now start to take some form of add back therapy to stop me fully going into the menopause. I am also going to take calcium vitamins.

I'm taking addback hormones_ calcium_ vitamins_ Welbutrin_ and handfuls of Ibuprofen to combat the lower back pain. I've also noticed shortness of breath which I assumed was from the humidity_ but the more I think about it_ I didn't really have that problem before my first shot.

Hot flashes started in month two and have gotten progressively worst.  Severe joint pain in my lower back_ knees_ and ankles.  The worst symptom has to be the mood swings.

After a diagnostic laparoscopy that showed no evidence of endometriosis (huge surprise for me and my surgeon)_ my doctor and I were grasping at straws for an explanation for my debilitating_ constant pelvic pain. Not resolved by continuous BCPs_ only slightly reduced by NSAIDs_ Vicodin_ etc._ we both finally landed on the possibility of adenomyosis in spite of the fact that I have never been pregnant. I started Lupron in February 2011_ and while the first two months were horrible (I was forewarned)_ month three gave me pain relief for the first time in years. No heavy ""bogginess"" in my lower abdomen_ no cramping_ no feeling like someone was grabbing my insides_ twisting them_ and trying to pull them out of my body. And if there had been any doubt in my mind that it was working_ I was a week late on my fourth shot_ and the misery was back. That's the only drawback to Lupron for adenomyosis from my experience - symptoms return as soon as you stop taking it. Lesson learned - don't get the shot late!

The right side pain is still present_ but bearable_ and the Fibromialga and other diagnosis I have been given have all cleared up (I am really tired of specialized doctors just guessing at what is going on). My gyn told me he wanted to try the Lupron shots for 6 months to see if it slowed the endometriosis from growing back as bad (there was so much there he said he is not sure if he got all of it).  I have only had 1 shot so far_ 2 weeks ago and I am miserable.  I do not know if I'm going to be able to handle 5 more months of this.  I would much rather have the severe pain in my right side back.

I ended up taking another dosage in December  in order to make it to my surgery date in January. I had the surgery a couple of weeks ago and it was a success.

No periodds or spotting for 6 months. It was nice.,I received 6 months of Lupron (1 shot per month). As I stated_ I did fine. However_ around 28 days after receiving my last Lupron shot_ I got my period. And it was horrible. It was heavy and back to being painful. My doctors could not understand how I got my period so soon. They said that most women don't have periods for 4-5 months after the last shot. But_ I guess everyone is different. So it really did help for 6 months but then it was over and back to period reality. I went on Lybrel but continuously spot on it. It's been 8 months since my last shot and I am going in for a laproscopic again. This will be my second surgery (the first being almost 10 years ago).

While I sympathize with those who have experienced extreme and negative side effects_ I don't think these situations represent the norm. For me_ the benefits outweigh the risks- and so far so good. Apart from the inconvenience of hot flashes and being more sad than usual_ I believe that this drug is helping to shrink my fibroids and it's gotten me off the morphine I was needing to get out of bed each day. My tummy is visibally smaller from shrinkage and the bleeding has all but stopped.

216, 1, Endometriosis; chronic pelvic pain,On a good note_ it did reduce my pelvic pain moderately. My bowel movements and pain with urination and intercourse were also moderately reduced.Negatively: the absolute worst thing was the crazy mood swings. I don't mean a little more sad or happy at times - I mean standing in my husband's face and yelling my head off while at the SAME time knowing I was yelling over absolutely nothing; becoming physically hostile towards others_ totally out of character. I began sinking into a depression over this. Caused MUCH marital strain. A few years ago I had been on 80mg of Prednisone for 10 months straight_ which was absolutely terrible - yet being on Lupron eclipsed the side effects of Pred and was much_ much worse. I also now have a condition called Lichen Sclerosis_ which is a permanent skin disorder of my genitals due to the hormone disturbance on Lupron. I also had many hot flashes and night sweats_ but this is an obvious and fairly common side effect of menopause at any age.PLEAS,I received one injection of a 3-month dose of Lupron.

I also noticed slight hot flashes but nothing crazy.  2nd injection...more hot flashes_...up 2 to 3 tmes per night for a glass of water and waiting to settle. 3rd injection - my doctor told me I wouldnt experience anything more but hes wrong.  I have hot flashes 7 to 8 times a day and night.

After reading the comments posted on this site I was very scared of taking Lupron and even considered not taking it. I decided to go ahead as I had no other real option and I am so glad I made that decision. Whilst I have had some side effects such as bone pain and night sweats they have not been extreme or debilitating and haven't affected my day to day life. The fibroid has shrunk considerably and all the associated discomfort has gone. I am about to have my 3rd injection and my operation is scheduled for 3 weeks time. I would tell anyone faced with the option of taking Lupron to make the decision based on your own situation_ everyone is different and you cannot predict how your body will react but Lupron can be an effective treatment.

220, 2, Endometriosis,Exhaustion_ swollen breasts_ migrains_ hot flashes_ slight memory loss_ depression_ anxiety_ nausea,Prior to taking Lupron I wasn't feeling great either. It seemed like I was feeling a little worse so I searched for Lupron side effects and found this site. It explains so much. I've had a full hysterectomy. I have severe endometriosis still and was hoping to stop any endo remaining with Lupron. I believe now most of my pain must be related to adhesions as my pelvic pain is not going away. I was really frigtened to take Lupron so I only took the 1 month shot. The side effects so far are very uncomfortable but I can still function and as I mentioned I wasn't feeling good prior to taking Lupron so I wasn't sure if how I feel now was Lupron related or prior pain related. I believe now that much of the side effects I have are Lupron related. I'm taking imitrex for migrains_ tums for nausea_ and pain pills for pain as well as prozac for depression. Although I don't think Lupron is helping and the side effects are not great_ I can still function_ a fear I had after my initial reading of side effects. So if you plan on trying Lupron_ the side effects are real_ but with a 1 month shot I can still work.

229, 3, Fibroids,Minor hot flashes_ some weight gain_ mood swings_ horrible headaches (same headache for about a week this time),I am taking Lupron to prepare for a myomectomy to remove large fibroids in about 2 weeks. The hope is that it will shrink my fiboids and also stop my periods to increase my hemoglobin. However_ I still got my period last month and it was worse than usual-using an entire box of ultra absorbancy tampons/overnight pads in 4 days. The most annoying side effects are the mood swings and headaches. I haven't had problems with the headaches until the past 2 weeks or so_ but I usually have a migraine-strength headache for at least a portion of each day. The mood swings have also been stressful--I'll go from being fine to being in a 'rage' to feeling depressed to fine again.

My eyes have become very painful_ dry and scratchy_ and sometimes so bad I can't decide what hurts less - keeping them open or closed.  The eye pain even wakes me up at night still and I've been off this hormone treatment for 6 weeks (last shot was 2.5 months ago).,I am so angry that I listened to my doctor and no longer trust him.  I was diagnosed with endo when I was 28 and had a lap back then and refused to take lupron back then.  Well_ now I'm 34_ married and we want to have kids and my doctor (different one this time) convinced me this would help.  I had another lap this past July and then started Lupron.  I had extremely painful periods_ so bad I cried sometimes and no amount of advil would help and sometimes with cramps all month long and missed at least a day or of work each month.  The side effects from this drug are FAR worse.  Now that I have been reading up on this drug_ I've learned these side effects could last from a few months up to years!!!?  It doesn't even make sense to take this drug_ the best it could do is buy you 6 months without the endo growing back again.  I guess I'll wait and see if I ever get my period back and eventually will have a hysterectomy.

So he put me on this drug to prevent the endo from returning so quickly_ trying to buy me some time to get pregnant one more time before doing hysterectomy. So I am currently taking this drug once per month for the next 4 months. I felt the side effects right after getting the injection. Cried for days with terrible mood swings and anger towards my poor husband. Once Monday came_ I called the doc and requested something to help w/symptoms. He put me on Lexapro (for depression_ mood swings_ and hot flashes) and hormone therapy. So after just one week of taking these meds_ I am feeling MUCH better_ but still have trouble sleeping and hot flashes. Still feel very tired all the time. Still have headaches. But I keep telling myself it's only temporary_ and I can get thru it. I would suggest you ask your doc for meds to help with the side effects before you get the shot_ or the same day_ as I waited a full week and my husband was thinking I was going insane and even slept on the couch. We never fight_ and I have never called him a name before. And this drug made me a monster_ taking everything out on him for no reason at all.

I have had a 1 month injection and a 3 month injection (which made it nice that I didn't have to go every month for an injection) I've read alot that after a month_ girls have had bad side effects and quit Lupron. Well_ the 1st month is when your body is getting used to it_ and it's probably the worst month. I haven't had any hot flashes or night sweats. The biggest side effect has been moodiness. After taking it_ I got depressed and was very edgy. So my Dr put me on Wellbutron_ an anti-depressant. I didn't like the thought of being on it_ but it's made such a difference_ and now I've never been happier! I had very severe cramping and pains for many years_ and I've had absolutely NO pain since I've been on this drug_ for the exception of one cramp about the 2nd month in. There was a month that I didn't have much sex drive_ and dryness has been an issue. I've had light spotting_ and my 3rd (and now my 4th) month into it_ I had a week of heavy bleeding. I found out from my Dr that ""breakthrough bleeding"" can be a side effect from this drug. I did gain 20 pounds. I hate it_ but most will go away once I'm off the drug.

After surgery we tried to get pregnant w/out success. My periods were awful_ I was in so much pain that I was doubled over. The pain was so bad I cried myself to sleep. After months of trying and having severe pain during my period I went back to my doctor to find out the endometriosis was back_ this time it was 11cm in diameter. My doctor suggested Lupron_ I had no idea what the drug was all about or how it would affect me. I was willing to try anything at this point. I've been on Lupron for 3 months now and have experienced a huge difference. I feel like I have my life back. The pain is GONE. I have hot flashes all the time_ which is annoying but it's worth it. The night sweats are constant_ I've also noticed a big difference in my sleep patterns. I would normally wake up once or twice before the Lupron. Now_ I'm waiting up 5-6 times b/c I'm hot_ thirsty or have to use the bathroom. I'm having surgery next month to removed the endometrioma. After surgery we're going right into IVF.

296, 1, Prostate Cancer,Mood swings_ suicidal thoughts_ joint pain_ poor memory_ poor concentration_ insomnia_ loss of libido_ weight gain_ increased blood pressure_ lethargy,I was diagnosed with stage 1 prostate cancer about a year ago.  Lupron was used to reduce the size of my prostate so that I could undergo external radiation_ followed by implanting seeds.  Due to the size of my prostate_ if Lupron was not used_ I would have been required to undergo three more weeks of external radiation.  In retrospect_ this was a bad judgment call on the part of my urologist and radiation oncologist.  I already had high_ and difficult to control hypertension.  The Lupron is known to cause weight gain and insomnia.  Both of these are factors in hypertension and increase the risk of stroke.  I don't think the small improvement in cancer treatment was offset by the danger in increasing my blood pressure.  I received two three-month injections of Lupron.  The last one was five months ago.  I continue to have insomnia and joint pain.  Because I am sleep deprived I am unable to lose weight and thus my blood pressure remains very high.  Sleep medications have been doing a poor job improving my sleep.  Had I been better educated about this drug and the inherent risks I would have likely refused to take it would have instead elected to have only external radiation therapy.

My endo started after I had my first child and I wanted to wait about hysterectomy so I chose Lupron. My hotflashes almost started immediately but my periods were so much better.  I had been having to go to bed because I cramped so bad before Lupron and even the week after my period I would be doubled over with pain in my rectum that would put me on my knees in excrutiating pain that felt like a knife stabbing me. But now I think I see side effects from it but my endo hasn't gotten as bad as it was before I ever took it! I have just started having terrible periods again! It's like the Lupron worked on me for years and that is amazing. However_ I have had joint pain that goes to the bone and I am so restless at night.  My hair has thinned so much_ but I can't say it is the Lupron that caused this but I feel like it did. If I would have known it would cause me this much joint pain and muscle aching I wouldn't have taken it. Although_ at the time I started it I was desperate for pain relief so at the time it gave me my life back. It's just weighing out your options. I never had any more children after the one because I kept having miscarriages and not really sure why. I only took it for 4 mo and stopped because the hot flashes were so intense.

Starting to have weight gain.,I had 5 ovarian cysts removed on 12/1/09_ one being the size of a grapefruit.  I also have a few fibroids remaining.  My dr. recommended Lupron right after to ensure that no cysts grow back.  At first_ I lost weight.  Now I'm gaining weight and never seem to be full or control my appetite.  I'm up about 5-7 pounds from month 1.  I work out_ but find it hard to muster up the energy.  I've also been bleeding with terrible cramps since about the 3rd week of treatment.  Most of the time it is spotting_ then it flares up.  It especially flares up after working out including bad cramps.  My dr. gave me Ponstel for cramps.  I have to keep working out to manage this weight gain and bloating_ but it's frustrating because of the bleeding/cramps.  I'm nervous about my upcoming shot in about 2 weeks; it's a 3 month dose instead of the monthly shots. If my hair starts falling out_ I might quit this treatment. This drug is also costing me a fortune.  I hope it works and controls future periods/fibroids/cysts.  I'm 30 and haven't had children yet....I would love to have children some day!

While the shot has taken away all of my pain and bleeding_ it has left me with more side effects than I care to have.  After suggestion from my doctor to try the ad-back therapy_ I decided to try it...what could it hurt.  But the side affects from the ad-back were actually worse than that of the side affects of the Lupron.  Worse hot flashes_ extreme mood swings_ and horrible insomnia.  After 1 week I stopped the ad-back and I am patiently waiting for the next 3 months to quickly pass and hope it has taken care of the issue.  Next step for me is surgery. I would only recommend Lupron as a last ditched effort to save your Uterus and Ovaries.  Try everything else first. If I had to do it all over_ I would still suffer through these side affects rather than have the pain/bleeding or a radical hysterectomy at 35.,F,35,6  months3.75 1X W,2/22/2010,Lupron
306, 3, endometriosis,Bone and joint pain_ headaches_ mild memory/concentration problems_ slight mood changes,"I was diagnosed with endometriosis in June 2009 and started continueously using birth control (nuva ring) for 7 months to help minimize my symptoms. I noticed my symptoms never got any better_ in fact they started to get worse. In December 2009 I finally saw my doctor and we discussed other options. My options were Lupron or surgery. After hearing about Lupron_ I opted to try the surgery. I had my surgery in January 2010 and my doctor said that he was surprised the amount and severity of my endometriosis and scar tissue he found. After that he suggested that I start Lupron as well to help eliminate anything that he missed during surgery. I have only had one shot so far and it really hasn't been as bad as I thought. I have had mild symptoms and notice that even though the severity of my cramping is the same_ the frequency has lessened. My doctor put me on an ""add back"" therapy which I believe has helped with the side effects of the shots.",F,23,6  months 1X M,2/19/2010,Lupron

I just had my 4th shot and I am not sure if it is all worth it.  I have been having major issues with my bladder and the Dr. thinks the endo may still have grown and is effecting it.  I have been able to deal with most of these side effects with a positive attitude and taking it in stride until today when I washed my hair and chunks came out.  After blowdrying it_ there are spots that are so thin it is almost bald.  I am hoping and praying this comes back.

I was convinced I was going to end up depressed_ gain 50 lbs_ and be unable to walk.  Well_ I just finished taking it (two times of once every three months) and I had absolutely no problems.  Of course_ I was on Depo Provera for a long time before that_ so my estrogen was already pretty low.  Still_ not everyone will have problems_ so hopefully someone who just started the drug will see this and be given some perspective.  In terms of pain_ btw_ it was okay--Depo helped with the pain more.,F,22,6  months 1X O,2/16/2010,Lupron

Other than that_ I've been pleased.,The cramping and spotting is the most annoying_ but knowing that the cramping will get better from the Lupron reminds me why I'm taking it.  These posts are scarey and I debated for a long time about taking the shot.  I should have just done it right away.  It's important to realize that everyone is different.

These lasted a couple of days and then subsided.  At my suppression check_ it was discovered I had ovulated while on lupron and had a large corpus luteum cyst.  My doc then increased my dose fom 5 to 20 units which had the end result of oversuppressing me.  My cl cyst was quite painful.  When the cyst burst_ I can honestly say it was the worst pain I've experienced outside of childbirth.

They're a daily occurrence_ get more intense each day. I'm on once/mo. for 6 mos._ take 5 mg progestin daily as ""add back"". Stage 3 endo_ diagnosed in Dec. Was on the pill for about 18 mos w/out improvement so doc suggested lupron. I'd actually not be too bothered by most side effects_ but the weight gain_ acne & mood swings. I struggle w/ my mood as it is_ & w/ weight so I'm not impressed w/ gaining about 3 lbs in a week. The weirdest thing is the false 'hunger' I have. It's quite bizarre; I'm sorta hungry & full at the same time. I'll eat & be full but 30 min later get almost like hunger pangs; yet I'm STILL FULL! It's nuts! Also noticed I'm actually eating a lil' less cuz I get nauseated bout 1/2way into a meal probably 1/2 the time I eat. Haven't had TOO many hot flashes; been pretty tolerable but I've gotten night sweats & woke up SOAKED in the a.m. past couple days. Feel overall kinda tired & forgot what I was doing mid-task a couple times. Still in the stage where estrogen is actually ""surging"" before it drops so I guess side effects will probably intensify the next few wks. I feel awful for those who had such a negative experience but for ME so far I've noticed my pain's already reduced.

316, 5, Fibroids and endometriosis,HOT hot flashes_ vaginal dryness_ dry skin and eyes_ occasional night sweats.,WELL worth the inconvenience and side effects_ Lupron really did the trick in shrinking all my fibroids (I had about five large ones) and shutting down the endo. I had surgery first_ followed by six months of Lupron Depot injections. I never had a recurrence of either the endometriosis or the fibroids. I would recommend Lupron to anyone with severe bleeding problems and for whom hysterectomy was the first solution given by a doctor. The first three doctors I saw wanted to do an immediate hysterectomy and never mentioned Lupron. The fourth doctor suggested surgery followed by Lupron -- we would have done it the other way around except I was bleeding so much that I was on the edge of not being an acceptable candidate for surgery because my hemocrit levels were so low. I_ too_ have chemotherapy experience from a late-stage childhood cancer -- 11 months of MOPP chemo_ which was nasty indeed. The Lupron wasn't even close to chemo_ not in the same universe. And the Lupron side effects are temporary_ unlike chemo and radiation side effects that I'm still dealing with 30 years later. If you believe as I do that keeping your uterus intact is important (talk to older women who have had hysterectomies and many years to live with the aftereffects -- younger women won't experience as many problems)_ then I truly can't recommend Lupron enough.,F,47,6  months,1/22/2010Email,Lupron

I did experience hot flashes but very minimal. my doc had me on add back therapy which I think helped with the side effects a lot because when I would forget to take it I experienced more of them. I have notice that my memory isnt very good sometimes. But over all this drug has helped imensely and I do not regret the decision. I havent really noticed even being on the drug (except when hot flashing) and it was been nice to be without a period and pain for the last 4 months. I did have some weight gain in the very beginning and so I began to workout daily and eat better and found that I could easily lose the weight and it also helped with the moodiness. I noticed that during what was supposed to be ""that time of month"" I was way more moody then normal. overall I recommend this drug to anyone who would like to start controlling there periods and pain instead of the other way around.",F,20,4  months,1/21/2010Email,Lupron

My mood swings are worse on the one month shot.  My short term memory is very bad.  I have even wondered if I am experiencing early signs of Alzheimers.  Lupron has helped tremendously for the pain and bleeding.  I have zero pain and have not had any spotting or bleeding.  Basically_ horrible memory loss_ low sex drive_ dryness and pretty bad mood swings.,I would recommended this drug as a last resort before having a hysterectomy; however_ it does work for the pain and suffering of endo.  I feel like it can be handled as long as you know what you are getting into and possibly take an anxiety drug like Prozac to help with the mood swings.

(The Mirena alone can cause worse bleeding the first month or so). If this works_ the Lupron gets completely flushed out and the Mirena leads to minor bleeding and relief until real menopause - it's been worth it_ as I cherish keeping my uterus.

Turns out that I had a ever growing endometrioma that was obstructing my large intestines and my left ureter. Also_ the endo was causing my appendix to obstruct another part of my intestines. I was (what felt like) rushed to surgery_ had two sections of my intestines removed_ endo cleaned up_ and my appendix removed. I was given the 3 month shot of Lupron when I left the hospital_ and I took my second three month shot about a month ago (I am scheduled for one more). The mood swings are rough_ but doable_ especially if you have an understanding support system. The hot flashes aren't fun. They put me on add-back therapy for a couple of weeks--Loestrin_ in fact--which made me spot for 6 weeks_ as well as make me feel as though my body was trying to have a period (though nowhere NEAR the kind of periods I use to have). The first shot of Lupron did not cause me to spot_ so the docs took me off the add-back_ so now I am just toughing it out. I feel much better these days_ though it's hard to work out whether it's the Lupron or the surgery. The Lupron is very expensive_ which could prevent some from finding relief with this drug.

I had to have blood transfusions it was so low. I was given the 3-month Lupron shot and after about 1 week my bleeding totally went away and the pain was gone. I was able to go on my scheduled Caribbean Cruise because of Lupron the next month.  Without it I would have had to cancel it. This is temporary until I have my Fibroids removed. Moodiness and insomnia - I had these before I took Lupron. I highly recommend it_ but realize that side effects are different for everyone.,F,39,1  months,11/18/2009Email,Lupron
347, 5, Severe Endometreosis,None,I was put on Lupron for severe Endo as a last ditch effort before a hysterectomy.  I received 3 injections and it has worked beautifully - no mood swings_ no hot flashes_ no night sweats..nothing and the pain_ heavy bleeding and bowel/bladder problems that I had from the endo are completely gone. I was hesitant to take the drug from all the negative feedback but I have to say I experienced none of the issues that others have complained of. I would recommend it to anyone with a similar problem.,F,49,3  months,11/13/2009,Lupron
348, 1, uterine fibroids,hot flashes_ vaginal dryness_ all the little things they warn you about.  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THEY DID NOT EMPHASIZE WAS RESULTANT OSTEOPOROSIS!!!  Do not take this drug.  It is poison to your body.  Do your own research_ find a doc who will work with you.  If a doc suggests Lupron_ for any reason_ to any person_ man or woman_ run_ run_ run!  The problems you will deal with later in life because of this poison_ are far worse than the symptoms you are treating now with Lupron.  If you have already received the injections_ start taking calcium and vitamin D now and don't stop.  Also_ get a bone density scan done!  Every two years if you are found to have osteoporosis.  Good luck to all who have become Lupron Victims.,,F,49,3  months,11/13/2009,Lupron
349, 4, endometriosis,during treatment:  constipation_ hot flashes_ acne_ sleeplessness,"Before Lupon_ I had terrible nausia and cramping with my period. It was so painful I ended up in the ER twice.When I first got the shot_ I was really sick and constipated an nauseated for about 2 weeks_ during which time I was TERRIFIED at the thought of having this medication in my body for another 3 months.  But it went away...  and I felt FANTASTIC.  I could go out with friends_ go on vacation_ make PLANS that did not hinge on the condition ""...if I feel okay that day.""  My major side effects during that time were acne and sleeplessness.  In fact_ I did not sleep through the night for 6 months.  THAT sucked_ but was nothing in comparison to the relief I felt.  Towards the end of the first 3 month shot_ I started bleeding...  and I bled for 5 weeks. I had to do estrogen add-back to get it to stop.  The second 3 months shot was not as blissful_ but I still felt a lot of relief.  Again_ when it started wearing off_ I started bleeding_ but that was only 8 days.  It has now been a month since the shot wore off_ and I still have some strange things going on.  I am really tight in my abdomen and vagina.  It is getting better_ but it was painful at first.  I had a headache for a few weeks that would not stop.  That has gone away.  Right now_ I am having hot flashes.  I think overall_ my hormones are still just trying to adjust.  We will see what happens!  No matter what_ I AM glad that I did it and had that 6 months of relief from my pain.Did anyone continue expe",F,28,6  months,11/12/2009Email,Lupron
350, 3, ER positve Breast Cancer,"I am taking Lupron as part of the Hormonal Treatement plan instead of taking Tamoxifin.  Lupron as put me in ""menopause"" and enables me to take Arimedax for Post menopausal treatment.  I have received the Lupron injections since 9/2005 and have no periods since. Would prefer not to be on this med as I am very concerned about the 'long-term' effects.",Pros: no periods_ No Breast Cancer!!Cons: weight gain especially in the mid section_ water retention_ insomnia (very bad)_ joint aches_ back ache_ hot flashes_ and real difficulty with an exacorbation of depression with irriatability_ low mood_ some mood swings_ impatient.  This has been the most difficult piece with this medication.  You really have to weigh the pros and cons as it can become a quality of life issue.

353, 1, prostate cancer spread to bones,My father had three injections and became very fatigues and depressed.  He took his life a month and half after the last injection of Lupron.  He had a heart condition also and was given the drug anyway.  It has been shown to cause cardiac arrest.  THe nurse practioner at Thomas Jefferson Urology in Philadelphia_ PA said she saw my father was depressed and she continued to give him the injections.  She was not supervised by an MD which is permitted in Pennsylvania.  Before the shots_ father was walking around Philly.  After he was too tired and depressed to do anything.  Nurse also gave him Casodex which combined with Lupron severely lowers testosterone levels.  Dr. Sui-Long Yao of Cancer Institute of New Jersey did a study that shows Lupron doesn't increase lives of prostate cancer people and seriously damages the quality of their lives.  The Los Angeles Times newspaper reported those receiving Lupron had a 17.4 percent death rate vs. those not receiving it of a 19.9 percent death rat,all of his teeth would have to be pulled because Zometa causes decay of the jaw bone.  She said my father didn't want that to happen to him and she didn't refer my father to anyone else for chemotherapy when he asked if there was another course of treatment.  She let him leave very depressed and tired from the Lupron and Casodex.  The supervising doctor_ Dr Goldman_ of the nurse practioner_ nurse Darlene Bewick_said to me he didn't know about my father's care because the nurse saw him.  he didn't even know my Dad had bone cancer from the prostate. Do not take Lupron.  It causes severe damages and has caused my father's death.  Doctors keep giving the drug. Please email me: Cheryl.,M,88,4  months,11/8/2009Email,Lupron
354, 4, Endometriosis,Hot flashes_ real bad muscle aches_ nausea_ headaches_ mood swings_ fatigue.,"I had an ovarian cyst removed in May 2009_ when the doctor found some endometriosis.  Started having real bad symptoms of the endo in August_ got my first Lupron shot at the end of September and I just got my second shot four days ago.  I saw my college's health services today because I thought I had the flu_ I'm so achy and exhausted_ but I don't have a fever or anything so I think they're likely symptoms of the lupron.  I am on the pill that came with the shot_ take that every morning and I think its better with that because I missed one once and I was MISERABLE.  I think I've had ""hot flashes""_ in the sense that I sweat more than usual and sometimes feel very warm_ but nothing like older women I know who are actually going through natural menopause.

355, 4, Lower Androgen level,mood swings_ hot flashes_ night sweats_ headaches_ nausea_ light-headed_ 1st month still got period,I took 2 one month injections to lower my androgen (testosterone) levels- it was high for me being a female. After 2 months it was lowered and I am supposed to check it again soon_ so hopefully this works long-term. All of the symptoms were relatively mild and not all the time. However_ I felt pretty weird and out of it the whole time. I did a lot of research online and there are a whole lot of horror stories_ but it really wasn't that bad for me. I lived with someone else who took it for inducing menopause and she had more severe symptoms. She was also on 3-month doses and said they stayed in her system too long.

BUT I am sure the only reason I can't name more is because of the memory loss.,Poison to body and soul.  The temporary relief is NOT worth the long term suffering caused by Lupron!!  I suppose the only thing that may make this nightmare worth it is if you are trying to conceive or you are being treated for a terminal illness.I am praying for all of us and even those that have read all of these posted warning and unwisely allows your doctor to convince you to alter your life forever.  I only had fibroids and now I feel like an 80 year old woman.  My daughter wants to know why I don't play with her anymore.

I had a son in 2004 and 2006. I started feeling endo pains last year and I talked to my doctor about another round of lupron. I just got my 1st 3 month shot this week and i am excited. Think about it - i got the shot in 2001 and started feeling pain again in 2008?  Seven years of relief! Lupron is wonderful and I say try it!,F,29,6  months,10/9/2009,Lupron

I had a couple of migraines the first month but none since then.  over all I think Lupron has helped with my endo but I am now concerned about joint pain and the swelling of my tummy.  I plan on seeking advice from an endocrinologist (not sure if I spelled that correctly) since I have PCOS as well.  Also will be making an appointment to see a gastroenterologist to check out the bloating.,F,35,3  months,10/5/2009Email,Lupron

I have also had a very very bad headache the last 5 days. I have missed two days of work this week because of how nausiated i have felt which started the day after the shot was givin.,This was only my first shot and i am already having so many problems with it.

363, 1, endometriosis,Hair loss_ memory loss_ severe hot flashes,I will say that after I was off Lupron_ I got preganant 5 months later. However_ I would NOT recommend Lupron.  This drug put me into early menopause the second I got off it.  My docs have said that my body is actually 15yrs older than my age.  I have very little short term memory_ my hot flashes have never gone away and my last shot was 18 yrs ago.  Now my daughter has started having hot flashes at the age of 14 and strongly believe it was because of the Lupron still in my system.  I had endometriosis so bad that the doctors filmed my surgery and took it around the world for training classes.  Ladies_ get the hystorectomy!!! Yes_ you'll feel better_ still lose your hair and so on.  If you have endo_ don't keep the ovaries because the endo will still live.  All the pain is gone except for the side effects of the Lupron.  Several years ago there was a class action law suit againt the use of Lupron.  You had to sign up for compensation however all the news regarding this just stopped being posted.  I gave up and figured I got my daughter and will just deal with the worst of it the way I always have.  If you can survive ENDOMETRIOSIS_ you can survive anything!

364, 5, Endometriosis,Hot flashes_ easily irritated_ more emotional,I have to ask myself why I put off taking this drug for so long. My pain was so bad_ I was miserable and my quality of life sucked. I rarely went out with friends and was no fun to be around because I was in constant pain. Within just a couple of weeks after the first shot everything changed. I feel great. I had forgotten how great it is to not deal with pain everyday. My doctor started me on the 30 day shot to ensure I could manage the side effects. I waited exactly 30 days to get the 2nd shot and 2 to 3 days before the shot I started to experience pain and other symptoms associated with my endometriosis. We opted to do the 3rd shot earlier and I experienced none of my previous problems. My doctor is only keeping me on a six month treatment and I can only hope that the medicine builds up and I get the years of relief that have been reported with this medicine. I can't imagine having to go back to the way I was before. I feel like a different person. I am able to go out and have fun with my frieds_ I went on vacation_ and get along better with my family. I consider it my miracle.,F,31,60  days,9/29/2009,Lupron

366, 4, shrink fibroids before hysterectomy,minor headaches_ weight gain_ mild depression_ fatigue_ hair loss_ hot flashes,lupron successfully reduced the size of my fibroids allowing my hysterectomy to be VLAH instead of abdominal.  this has been fantastic - today is 6 days post surgery and i can walk 2-3 km comfortably_ have 3 insignificant incisions_ very little pain and could reasonably return to a desk job within another 7-14 days. being informed of the side effects is important to be able to manage through them.  my doses were 1 shot/month for 3 months. last shot 2wks ago - hair loss just started - i lost hair post partem also likely related to hormonal swing so it makes sense.,,,3  months,9/20/2009,Lupron

Since then_ I have been spotting/bleeding nonstop - this has been the worst side effect for me so far. Some days it is lighter than others. I am always tired and very irritable. I had very little symptoms in the first few days of receiving the injection. Thankfully_ my doctor also prescribed aygestin to help with the hot flashes and it has worked exceptionally well. If you are considering taking this shot_ I would recommend asking the doc to prescribe something in addition to combat them. I hate the way it makes me feel most of the time and I cannot wait for the next few months to go by so I can be finished with it.,F,26,3  weeks,9/10/2009,Lupron
368, 3, Endometriosis,Hot flashes_ night sweating_ severe mood swings_ depression.,I started taking Lupron two weeks after I had a laporatomy in December.  I took six shots and told the doctor that i refused to take anymore. I was so moody and depressed that my husband was miserable_ almost left me. I had to start taking Welbutrin for the mood swings after my second shot.  All I did was cry.  I took my last shot in May and did not get my first period since the surgery till August.  AFter the period_ I am having to take birth control non stop till I decide when I want to start having children.  I would recommend the shots to anyone_ but be sure you have a doctor that is very open with you and be there to answer your questions if you have one.  If I had a question or problem_ my doctor or his assistant always called me back and I did alot of research before I took the first shot. Also_ I got some advice from some friends who had been on the shot and kinda knew what to look for. The only problem I am having now is that my legs and ankles started to swell in July. My left leg/foot is swelling worse than my right.  I have been checked for several different things and nothing has been found.  I am starting to wonder if it is a side effect for quitting the Lupron.  If anyone has ever had this same problem after the last shot_ please let me know.,F,28,6  months,9/10/2009Email,Lupron

370, 1, endometriosis,Hot flashes_ Lots of hot flashes_ brain-fog_ severe moodiness_ Extreme forgetfulness_ Weight loss_,At the time was taking it -and up to a year later_ I would have recommended Depo Lupron. It helped with the pain of endo. for the 1st time in my life I wasn't doubled-over in pain_ and could be active! But the side effects still continue and the pain comes back.  7 years later: I'm VERY forgetfull/ memory problems_ to the point it's cost me friendships and jobs.  I suffer Joint pain_ insomnia_ occasional hot flashes_ became very sensitive to chemicals and stimulants (such as caffeine_ medications_ food additives) With such complicated_ long-term side effects and not being able to find a doctor who will look into what happened to me as a result of luron_ the desperation now is worse than just the pain of endo. (plus pain/endo back too)  I strongly warn against Depo Lupron!!

I don't know how long it will last once I'm off the drug but for now it's great. I've had 2 injections and hot flashes were the worst within the first couple of weeks after each one. But I have to say it's been worth it. The weight gain sucks_ so I'm hoping to lose the 8-10 pounds over the next few months. I've been moodier than normal_ but I learned to sort of ""feel"" when a bad mood swing was coming so I could take a few deep breaths or find another way to deal with it.

The first week I was bed bound for 4 days.  I got my period so bad I was going threw a pad an hour it was horrable.  I am hoping that the side effects start to settle.  The doctor tells me that the first two weeks things get worse then your body evens out and things start to get better.  I hope he is right.  I was trying everything else not wanting to have this injection knowing all the side effects and my response to meds.  well that time came the doctor said you have tried everything we need to do the injection now.  I went for the first 3 months being a month at a time incase my body didnt respond well.  then the last 3 months would be one injection.  well I had the first on on 08/19/09 and I got a hot flash with in an hour of getting the thing. I will keep on trucking in hopes that the side effects settle and this will help.  I can have my period 3-4 times a month and they can be very very pain full.

Even though I have so many things hindering my everyday life_ THE PAIN HAS STOPPED! Which makes it all worth it to me.

And I love my husband_ so I really don't want to hate him. I just can't help it. Lupron is obviously causing some pretty severe mood swings.

376, 5, endometriosis and severe bleeding,The month after the first injection was bad_ and I had a lot of weakness_ mainly because it lengthened my period. But after the second shot_ the side effects were very minimal_ limited mainly to hot flashes_ which are now almost non-existent.,I read the comments on this page the night before my first injection_ and I cried. I almost didn't go through with it_ but I am SO GLAD that I did. Lupron has been an absolute God-send. Most of the horrible side effects listed on this page are what I got when I took birth control_ so I was terrified to try something else. But it has helped me SO much_ and I have regained my life. I recently went from the 1 month shot to the 3 month_ and my problems without Lupron are so severe_ that I am taking it for ten months instead of the normal six.

377, 4, Fibroids,Some muscle and joint stiffness and soreness_ and intermittent night hot flashes. Pain_ swelling and inflammation from fibroids GONE_ completely after 1.5 weeks. Noticeable fibroid shrinkage. Some insomnia as a result of the hot flashes at night after first month. Muscle and joint soreness which was helped by daily exercise. Muscle and joint side effects decreased after month 1. Hot flashes helped greatly by Estroven.,Side effects were minor compared to the pain relief from the fibroid shrinkage and slow down of heavy menstrual cycles. Huge improvement in my fibroid related symptoms. Over the counter Estroven supplement greatly helpful for night sweats. I did not get add back therapy from my doctor_ but I suspect this would work more effectively than over the counter subsitutes. I was very nervous to take this medicine_ but it worked! I was shocked to discover how exhausted I had been from the constant heavy periods_ inflammation and pain from the fibroids. It resolves any questions in my mind regarding my planned hysterectomy later this year - it is absolutely necessary. My multiple fibroids had grown to the size of a 6 month pregnancy prior to taking the lupron. I will not hesitate to take my second 3 month dose of lupron.,F,41,3  months,8/17/2009,Lupron

One note - after my 3rd shot I had a week where I ached all over like a really bad flu - but other than that I've had not problems that would stop me from finishing this series of shots. The brian fog is bothersome_ but it comes and goes and I am still maintaining a 4.0 in my master's classes - I just have to work a bit harder at it now. So_ I don't know about endo or trying to get pregant_ but I can tell you that_ for me_ Lupron did what I was promised and I am very glad I'm taking it.  Will post again at the end of this series.,F,47,4  months,8/10/2009,Lupron
381, 4, Endometriosis stage IV,Decreased Sexual Desire_ Hot Flashes_ Aches and Pains_ Tender Breasts,My endo was discovered in 2004 and I have had lupron on and off for the last 5 years. The total time I have used lupron is around 2.5 years. I have been put back on it and the gyno has told me that I can continue to use it until decide to have children. I prefer lupron to my periods but I am becoming concerned about the long term use of the drug. A few weeks ago I noticed that my left breast nipple is very swollen/tender and my mom is concerned. In the short term_ lupron may be a good pain reliever but I am concerned that the lack of hormones could be causing other problems.,F,23,3  times,8/10/2009,Lupron
382, 3, Stage IV Endometriosis,Increase in migraines_ joint pain_ but no other side effects other than being cold for the first time in awhile!,So far_ I love it.  It has helped level my mood_ controls my hot flashes that I started getting after my Laparotomy_ and I don't have to deal with my period now for a while.  UNFORTUNATELY_ the pelvic pains have not gone away_ and the ovarian cysts are starting to come back less than 3 months after having them surgically removed.,F,25,2  months,8/9/2009,Lupron
383, 3, Stage IV Endometriosis,So far so good.  I was told side effects may not start until second injection.,I have stage IV endo that has caused lots of physiological issues such as multiple blood filled cysts_ a blocked fallopian tube_ colon issues_ and pain everyday when I wake up.  I started going through the process of getting it removed so my husband and I can hopefully have a baby.  I had a laparoscopic procedure but since endo bleeds so much and the issues with my colon and the endo growth_ the dr. could only clean up one side.  I'm on lupron for 5 months to slow the growth so he can hopefully clean up the other side and we can get pregnant.I've been scared to death to take this for years but I had my first injection 2 weeks ago and everything is going fine so far.  I'm actually having cold flashes... kinda odd!  I still have mild endo pain but I'll take that over some of the things I've read about on here any day.,F,28,2  weeks,8/1/2009Email,Lupron
384, 4, Fibroids causing anemia,Some hot flashes.  A little fatigue_ complete loss of sex drive.  a little foggy in the head.  Weight gain maybe - not sure??,"I was freaking out after the dr. prescribed this for me.  Begrudgingly I took the shot.  I have 2 submucosal fibroids which are about an inch around. The worst side effect I experience is the fogginess.  I search and search for the right word and it never comes.  The pros far outweigh the cons -  this drug has turned me around to prepare for myomectomy.  I was bleeding so heavily before lupron that I had to receive a transfusion.  I was in and out of the ER. Long story short - I have since switched drs.  New dr will do myomectomy and hysteroscopy (yeah!)   Old dr. wanted to ""try out"" different birth control pills which do not work because fibroids have more estrogen receptors than normal uterine tissue and they feed off of those pills and just grow and grow. I am off of bcp's_ and on my 2nd injection - the bleeding has stopped completely.  It took a few weeks for that to happen.  After the first shot_ you should get a period within about a week.  Mine lasted for about 4 days_ tapered off to nothing.  NO MORE BLEEDING!!! The reason for this is your uterus is shedding all of the extra stuff that has built up.  I just had the 2nd shot last week and my stomach is now flat and I have no more fibroid pressure.  I literally feel like my uterus (which was enlarged) is smaller.  I really think the key is to exercise every day_ take your iron_ calcium and daily vitamin and REALLY watch what you eat.  Yes_ it is a lot of work_ but I have not gained an ounce_ in fact I have los",F,35,6  weeks,7/29/2009,Lupron

I have gained some weight (about 3-5 lbs) and have some acne (but this may be a result of getting off of the birth control pills since I've always had bad skin).  I have some hot flashes.  I was so scared to take this medication after reading some patients' comments_ but I truly feel fine.  Hopefully this will one day give me an opportunity to have babies.  HIGHLY recommnend asking your physician for add back therapy.  I truly believe the pill I take once a day is the reason why my side effects are not as bad as some of the ones being experienced by others.,F,27,1  months,7/13/2009,Lupron

Sometimes I would be in intense pain_ which would last for about 10 minutes. I haven't had a cycle for the last 2 1/2 months_ which is good cause I had them twice a month before Lupron. The pressure in my head and dizzyness was almost unbearable_ but has gone a way. I'm in my third month and some of the side effects are starting to ware off. I'm glad I took the medicine despite the side effects since it gave me a three month break from my heavy twice a month cycle.

Her developing breasts disappeared_ her extreme mood swings are dramatically reduced_ PMS symptoms gone_ migraines gone_ she's gained 5 inches in height_ and her bone age is now nearly her real age (not 50% older). On the other end of the spectrum_ I'm just finishing menopause (no Lupron) a little younger than the average woman_ and am experiencing much of the symptoms many women who hate the Lupron are experiencing.

399, 5, Stage IV endo,very mild hot flashes but those didn't start until the 2nd month. Slight decrease in sex drive. First month I was more tired than normal and had some headaches but both went away.,I was so nervous about taking Lupron and I avoided it at all costs because of what I read of other people's experiences. What I've learned is that you have to rely on your doctor and don't assume you'll have a terrible time with it. Some people do but that doesn't necessarily mean you will. I am a professional classical singer and I was worried about what it would do to me vocally and I've been fine. I'm also a triathlete and I was terrified of weight gain and joint pain but neither one have been a problem. The pain from the endo is GONE and that's worth so much to me. I have it everywhere - on my colon_ small intestines_ in my left ovary_ you name it. The pain was making my energy worse than the Lupron. I told my husband that if I could stay on it I would. After my 3rd shot next week_ I'll have one to go. Do your research on the drug and find a doctor you trust.,F,36,2  months,6/11/2009Email,Lupron

Before lupron I was bleeding to death with 18 out of 28 day menstral cycles. Since I started lupron_ I've only had one cycle_ and it was mild compaired to what I used to have to deal with.I will come back and post again if I have start to have problems_ for for now_ this has been a life-saver.,F,47,2  months,5/29/2009,Lupron
402, 4, Severe Endometriosis,I have gained weight and I hate it but I have no periods which I love.  I am slowly but surely getting my sex drive back.  My breast are huge but beautiful. :-)  Seriously_ I've been on Lupron for about 2 years.  I had a serious talk with my GYN regarding how long I can be on this medication and what alternatives that I have.  You see I have BiPolar I and a Seizure Disorder so a Dr. is not treating just one issue he/she is treating a co-morbidities.  Before when I was not on the Lupron and I was on my cycle there were a couple of times or more than a few times than a few times I went into a manic state so the Lupron right now is giving me a repreve.  Right now a hysterectomy is not an option.,I've been doing pretty well for the last two years all things considered.  I don't want to stay on Lupron forever but I don't want to go back to having my cycle either which turned me into my manic state which in one case landed me in the psych ward because of my bipolar and endo combined.  So you see each person is different and you can only do what's best for you. :-),F,36,2  years,5/29/2009,Lupron
403, 5, Severe Endo and Tumor in uterus,I have NOT had a horrible experience with Lupron_ I was so scared by all the info on here about all the side effects. I have just started my 7th month of treatment_ I am doing 1 year of 3 month injectons. First few weeks were rough but everything was fine after that. I have a few hotflashes when I get the shots but they go away. I do have a lot of nightsweats_ usually 2 or 3  a night_ I also have lost my libido_ thank god for some helpers in that area! I also take the add back and when I forget for a few days...you dont want to be around to see what happens! I did have a lot of joint pain for the first month_ I could barely walk up the stairs. I started taking 1 tylenol arthritis for it and I am totally fine now. Some of the crummier side effects are the loss of sex drive and the vaginal dryness_ and the weight gain. I just feel like Im a lardo all the time. But I am very happy I have taken this drug! Everyone reacts different_ please talk to you Dr. and get all the details before sayi,My Dr. found a very large mass in my uterus and when he went in to take it out he also found that I had severe Endo. He wanted to do a hysterctomy right then_ thank god my husband told him no way!

I am also very sensitive to hormones and can barely tolerate the moodiness from birth control. Lupron was actually better from me than birth control. I experienced less moodiness. I can't say enough good about this drug. Don't let people scare you.

I neither recommend or caution against this medication_ but you have to be prepared for what is to come!

But the week the Lupron should have been out of my body_ I got severe symptoms that have lasted almost a year.,The side effects while I was on Lupron were really not that bad because I had read up on it and knew what to expect.  The add-back therapy with it helped tremendously!  The only thing that affected my life significantly was short-term memory loss and now a whole list of symptoms that seem to have been caused by the treatment.

After the 1st shot the pain was much worse but it lasted only about three weeks. Now everything is great_ no pain no weight gain. I do recommed drinking a lot of water and also exercise on regualr baises.

Last was Oct. My PSA has stayed down to .002 ever since the first shot. Last test last month.  I have had prostate surgery_ 4 years later 37 radiation shots_ but 4 years later it came back.

415, 4, Prostate cancer,Fatigue_ loss of libido_ intense feeling of warmth in extremities,My PSA level was 25 (Gleason scores of 7 and 8) three months ago. A CT scan and MRI showed lymph and bone lesions in the pelvic region. After extensive consultation with my oncologist_ he prescribed Lupron to shrink the prostate and shut down testosterone production. The side effects are tolerable_ just annoying_ and the PSA level has dropped from 25 to 3 in a month.  It is also necessary to have a baseline bone scan to monitor calcium loss and other possible chronic issues_ which will mandate frequent (perhaps even monthly once the Lupron treatment ceases) blood analysis and inconvenience.  After 8 months on Lupron_ no further androgen ablation therapy will be used until PSA levels begin to rise again. My oncologists stresses the importance of trying to maintain as normal a life as is possible_ with deliberate efforts to exercise and stay active. I no longer have to take ten Ibuprofen tablets a day to relieve the stinging lesion pain enough to sleep at night. My oncologist suggests that_ while he sees no additional benefit at the present time_ there are other possible treatments_ including radiation and chemotherapy_ that may be tried if and when the Lupron no longer adequately suppresses testosterone production.  I find it quite possible to continue my daily activities with a minimum of inconvenience. I plan to participate in a clinical trial designed to determine if the administration of dutasteride (Avodart)after 8 months will lessen the need for Lupron.,M,67,5  weeks,4/30/2009Email,Lupron

The one thing that made me stop after only one shot was the severe depression I experienced about 2-3 weeks into it. I had been diagnosised with PTSD about a year prior to this_ but was on the verge of being admitted into the psych ward because of the severe depression and would not recommend this to anyone who has any history of depression at all.

While in surgery it was discovered that I was having a tubal pregnancy and my left fallopian tube was removed. I was told after the procedure that because of the surprise tubal ligation_ all the endometriosis was not removed being I had been under anestesia for 3 1/2 hours and they feared greater consequences if they didn't wrap things up. I was given the lupron without my consent (you know you sing the waver saying that the doctor can do what it must to treat you) anyway_ I was told the purpose of the injection was clear up the rest of the endo that was not removed. My doctor told me that ""she was amazed that I tolerated the pain of both the endo and tubal pregnancy so well_ and was surprised I was able to walk."" After receiving the first injection which was supposed to be re-administered after 3 months I experienced severe hot flashes_ horrible cold night sweats_ extreme moodiness and dispression. Even with the side effects I had decided to continue on the path my doctor had chosen for me and receive my second (and last injection) when I arrived at the doctors office for my injection_ my doctor had left the practice. That was in August. I have since still experience severe endo pain. I have had a hard time finding a doctor that I trusted.

Before_ my hot flashes and mood swings were nearly constant and unbearable and my side-effects were interfering with my professional and personal lives.

I have *almost* no pain and my hubby and I can be ""intimate"" again - I'm not so afraid of the pain anymore that i can live my life normally. The only effects I'm still experiencing are ocasional hot flashes_ occasional moodiness_ headaches and lessened libido (altho it's much better than when I first started the treatment). At this point I am going to follow-thru and hopefully will not need to get surgery!! I would recommend anyone looking to begin this treatment to research it carefully and ask lots of questions. I would also recommend getting a pregnancy test before your first injection - I was not given one (!!!) and spent several months very very concerned....I am hoping Lupron works and lasts_ and that when my hubby and I are ready I will be able to have children!",F,20,4.5  months,4/7/2009Email,Lupron

423, 4, Endometriosis,Hot flashes (mostly at night)_ very weepy but your doctor can give you medicine if you are this way_ as well as medicine for the hot flashes. If you aren't into taking prescription medicine for your moods there is an over the counter medicine from wal*mart or wherever.

The hot flashes were very insignificant.  The best part was absolutely no migraines and PMS and just feeling ""better"" overall.  I did gain a significant amount of weight (23 pounds) but was reassured by my endocrinologist that this will go away once the medicine is out of my system.

425, 5, Shrink Uterine Fibroid pre-surgery,mild fatigue_ mild headaches,I took the 1x/month shot of lupron for 4 months to shrink my very large fibroid tumor (~15-16cm) in the hopes of having laparoscopic surgery. The lupron shrunk my tumor enough to remove it laparoscopically (yay!). Turns out it was 12 cm after being shrunk!  When I first saw this page before I started the lupron I was terrified. I was afraid of hot flashes and (since I have a history of hormone migraines) I was concerned Id have a 4 month migraine.  After the first shot I felt great_ but a week later I ended up with a moderate migraine that lasted 5 days. I felt fine for the rest of the month other than being a little more tired than usual. I did have a mild 2-4 day migraine in months 2 and 3_ but not the last month.  However_ after the 1st month_ I could feel that it was shrinking my tumor and I had less discomfort and pain from the fibroid. One very important thing that I should mention is that my doctor also had me taking a low dose of progestin (2.5mg of Aygestin) to prevent hot flashes. I only had one incident of night sweats_ so it worked. He says this is key and there is no reason for women to suffer by not having add-back therapy. Not to discount any of the experiences on this site_ but wanted to let prospective lupron patients know that your experience may not be as bad as others_ especially with the aygestin. ASK YOUR DOCTOR about taking progestin.,F,38,4  months,4/2/2009Email,Lupron

I was a newlywed when I was diagnosed and I had horrible pain with intercourse before I began my injections. A month after I started Lupron I had no pain. The day or so after I get my injection I feel kind of cruddy and get a pretty bad headache. I also have hot flashes everyday and mood swings. All of these side effects are definately worth it. I feel so much better!,F,20,5  months,1/8/2009,Lupron

The s/e didn't really kick in until 3-4 weeks after the shot. Headaches only lasted 2-3 weeks and I could control them with meds_ coffee_ or staying super-hydrated. I can't answer for sure if this has worked or not b/c endo is tricky like that_ but so far_ I haven't been as miserable as I thought I would be!,F,29,2  months,1/7/2009,Lupron
471, 2, Possible Endometriosis,I took it three days ago for the first time. By last night I was nearly suicidal. I was able to take Seroquel which had been prescribed for me for sleeping and it did the trick at least with the overwhelming depression. I've had depression before but not like this.,I'm still feeling cramping like I did before the Lupron but time will tell if this will help. I'm bi-polar and cannot take the add in of estrogen or progesterone because of a history of blood clots. I'd suggest to someone who is bi-polar to really think hard about taking this or with the first suicidal thought to get in touch with their psychiatrist IMMEDIATELY!,F,32,3  days,1/2/2009,Lupron

I haven't had a cycle yet and I have been off the Lupron for 3 months.  I am hoping that it helped keep the endo at bay so that I can try for one more child.,F,31,9  months,12/31/2008,Lupron

Since then no period but I do wear a liner for just in case purposes. I would do this all over again! I hope my fibroid has shrunk_ but the relief I got fom 2-3 week periods is totally worth it.

I am a personal trainer so feeling weak_ faint and sore from mild workouts is unpleasant but bearable_ I guess.  All of the other side effects are incredibly annoying but also bearable.

He told me that because I didn't have endo or fibroids and that I do have PCOS and should never have been given the Lupron.  I've changed diets and that seems to help with my girl issues but not the side effects of the drug.  I was supposed to be on 1 shot a month for 6 months. I stopped after 1 dose....I was done.

I was skeptical after reading about the side effects_ but went ahead and did the treatment.  I definitely don't regret it!  My night sweats and hot flashes were minimal_ and someone gave me the advice to avoid sodium_ sugar_ caffeine_ and heavy spices while I was on the drug_ and that made a huge difference.  When I did not follow the diet_ I felt terrible!  I've been off of Lupron for about 8 months now and have had normal periods since about 3 months after my last injection.

I also lost my right ovary.  When I first heard about having to go on Lupron_ I thought I was walking into a nightmare.  Reading things about anxiety and insomnia scared me so much.  The day of the appointment I refused to go_ my husband had to drag me off the couch.   I am so happy to say it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  Some memory foggyness_ but otherwise manageable.  I took the shots mostly in the winter_ so I actually found the hot flashes pleasant ;)  I just bought a lot of tank tops.My last shot was July_ and I just got my cycle back this month (October).  I feel a lot better and I know it worked to keep the endo at bay while my body healed_ so hopefully I'll be able to have a baby soon  I feel like me again_ my energy is back- and I have to say that for some reason my anxiety level was waaayy down when I was on Lupron- things that normally made,F,29,6  months,10/20/2008,Lupron

My only disappointment is that I cannot take it until menopause is officially over for me.  I used to have such heavy periods that they were affecting my CAREER by preventing me from volunteering for activities_ because I didn't know what my menstrual situation was going to be like.

I had frequent blood pressure readings in the 200+/100+ range_ sending me to the OR three times in three weeks. My BP med was doubled and another added before my BP was brought down to 140-150 over 80's range. The pain in my left toe joints was so severe I had pretty much decided that if the pain didn't diminish as the drug wore off I would need to have my toes amputated.I was never warned of these side effects.In fact_ I could never convince the oncologist at the clinic that these problems were Lupron induced.

No weight gain_ no acne_ no vaginal dryness_ no decreased sex dive_ no beard :)_ no other side effects!! I'm a full month into the treatment and looking forward to the endo pain relief I anticipate to experience starting next month. I am taking norethindrone (add-back therapy) but didn't start that until 2 weeks into treatment. My side effects have been so mild that I can't even notice the difference norethindrone makes!

Completely frightened by the throught of Lupron I did nothing for a few years.  About 5 months ago my pain from endo was too much to bare.  I talked to my Doctor extensively about Lupron and decided to give it a shot.  We had decided to do a 3 month trial_ one month at a time to monitor side effects.  I recently had my fourth injection (over a 4 month period).  To me the side effects are worth being pain free.  It has helped to have an understanding_ support system and Doctor who took as much time as I needed answering my questions.

Doctor removed 8 fibroids and left my uterus fine. Initially biggest fibroid was over 5cm_ lupron reduced it to 3.5cm & others shrunk too. I haven't had a period since Dec. 2007. I still have the menaupause_ get a little hot_ still overly sensitive and pretty depressed even with anti-depressants. A little joint pain (knees). Column pain is gone. The effects are still not completely out of my system.,Because I have felt so extremely depressed_ suicidal I would not recommend this. I regret having taking it. If I would have known I wouldn't have never taken it. I have always been a super healthy person_ eating good food_ no junk food ever_ don't smoke_ don't drink_ a lot of exercise_ running_ weights_ swimming but this has a way to break you completely. If you have a history of depression as I had PLEASE DO NOT TAKE LUPRON_ you may risk to commit suicide or live in hell. Doctor told me in 2 months effects are gone but some still there.

I was 34 at the time. My doctor didn't want to a hysterectomy at such a young age. It was the most horrific 6 months of my life. The side effects were life altering. Not only on me but on my family.  I had insomnia to the point that I had to take sleeping pills and that didn't help.  I suffered through Hot Flashes where I was constantly in shorts and my family was wrapped in blankets.  I had severe night sweats where I literally had to get up and change my clothes and bedding. I forgot everything and anything. I suffered from bone pain that was so excruiating that I was taken to the Emergency Room and it took hours to figure out that it was a side effect. Not only did the Lupron not work. I couldn't work. I could barely function. In the end_ I ended up having a total hysterectomy 11 months later. The Endo spread everywhere.  I still suffer from depression_ my relationship ended and I will never be the sam,F,40,6  months,9/8/2008Email,Lupron

I mentioned the severe side-effects some of you were getting to my nurse_ and she said there are two different Luprons (?) and that my doctor will not prescribe the older one anymore because of such side effects.  I have only experienced occassional headaches_ and night sweats (very infrequent)_ and the acne is not pleasant_ but worth it.  I am on my last shot (6 months)_ so I cannot yet say if it will actually help my pain until I get my period again.  I would do it again in the future if I have to!,F,25,6  months,9/5/2008,Lupron

I was told by my doctor that this could take a few injections for it to work.  I just had my 11th injection yesterday and in no way has this drug helped me so far.  On top of all of that_ my doctor added Interstial cystitis to my list of dyagnosis in Oct 2007_ so it makes me even wonder if my real pain is from the Endo or the IC.  My pain is pretty consistant and with my last three injections of Lupron_ I have actually began to feel worse.  I have been bleeding for the last two months and am not sure if there is any point to staying on the Lupron_ but I do know that when I am late getting an injection (even by just a week) I am in unbearable pain_ so again_ its hard to pinpoint the pain.

517, 1, Endometriosis,Terrible side effects. It took away my life for years. I took it 8 years ago and I still have side effects. For several years after the shots I had joint pain that made me move like someone who is 90_ severe headaches_ nausea_ acne and unexplained boils all over my body. Since I have broken three bones and my favorite drink is ice cold milk_ so I drink a lot of milk. Now I am slowly losing my teeth. For years I didn't leave the house because I was embarrased about how bad my skin was. I was afraid someone thought I had leprosy or something. Not to mention_ I was so tired. All of these side affects have finally subsided_ however_ the absolutely worst was memory loss and inability to think logically. I use to be smart and I was an auditor. Now I cannot do anything that requires logic. It often happens that I drive places_ then don't remember driving there. I might go out to eat with my family and the next day I do not remember any of it.,DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS. THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE WORSE THAN THE DISEASE.

519, 5, Fibroids,None,I have been on Lupron for almost a month to shrink my fibroids_ in particular a large one that was 13cm x 12cm x 10cm.  The only symptoms I had before Lupron were a large uterus and urinary frequency.  After I had my dose_ my fibroids initially increased in size but have since shrinked substantially.   I've had chills_ mild headaches_ and occasional feelings of warmth_ but they haven't been intense enough for me to correlate to the drug.  These symptoms are also possibly explained by other factors (e.g._ AC at work).  The period I had after starting Lupron was long in length (9 days) but after the initial few days_ I've only experienced very mild spotting.   I have steadily lost weight_ which is not such a bad thing_ although I've altered my diet since finding out I had tumors (e.g._ no or much less dairy_ no red meat_ no artificial sweeteners_ more organic food).

I have 3 very large fibroids inside and outside of my uterus.  I have a large cyst on my left ovary_ and a large amount of endo.  My first shot of Luporon wasn't so bad_ although I did get a lot of hot flashes.  The next time_ I go the 3 month dose.  Oh boy...I am putiing up with this b/c I really don't have a choice...The hot flashes come and go very often...and is very anoying!  But the joint pain is killing me...it hurst so bad each time I walk up the stairs_ bend down to reach something...just in general...my knees always hurt! I was pretty active before being on Lupron_ and my joints never were a problem.  Also_ the doctor said that I need to loose a some weight before having surgery_ but with one of the side effects of the drug is weight gain...it makes it all that more difficult.  It is just very fustrating.  I am staying on it as long as the Dr. says I need to be_ but it wish there was another way.  It makes me feel a lot older than,F,30,3  months,5/5/2008Email,Lupron

I will say that I hope to never take these injections again; however_ my experience with Lupron was not near as bad as most others that write about their experiences online. I was scared to death to start Lupron b/c of what I had read. I guess everyone is different but I do know that not near as many people are going to get online and write about their good experiences as they do their bad ones. My main complaint is weight gain. I am taking Aygestin as well and have heard that causes weight gain more so than the Lupron. I'm not really sure.

Admittedly_ that might be the actual cause of the terrible forgetfulness and irritability. But_ I didn't have those before this blasted insomnia. First shot stopped period for two weeks. Then bled heavily for a week; followed by a week of regular to light flow. Second shot stopped everything again for two weeks. I have had light flow now three days.

My doctor gave me this because I asked him crying if there was a way to avoid a hysterectomy (I really did not want one eventhought 2 gynecologists told me that my 5 fibroids are a reason for one). I wonder now if there was another alternative to this treatment because it concerns me what is doing to my body and health_ also losing bone mass it's probably what is doing to my back but happily I'm very athletic_ still lifting weigts at least once a week_ swimming a little and running once or,F,46,2  months,2/9/2008,Lupron

I would have felt more in control if I had known what to expect.  By the second shot_ I was experiencing moments of intense depression. I could sit and cry for no reason.  Never_ had I dealt with this before.  After the second shot (I'm experiencing full menopause/hot flashes etc by now) I started having serious joint pain.  So bad_ there were days I could hardly walk.

My advice if you have endometriosis like me- have surgery- which I did. That is the only real way to get rid of the problem. Lupron used post surgery for therapy to allow body to heal and to not get a period/inflame any endometrial cells that may have not been removed with surgery. If you don't have to go on this medication do not. It is a very very uncomfortable drug to be one. Makes you want to crawl out of your skin. Alternative therapies/drugs should be considered.

I have had a constant headache since getting the shot_ and there have been 2 days so far (not consecutive) that I began to bleed out of no where_ and then the bleeding just stopped suddenly. I do feel a little achy_ especially in my back_ but nothing severe. I can say that the affects I am suffering are worth the pain being gone. Before Lupron_ I thought I'd never be able to live without Vicodin. I have not suffered weight gain or loss due to the shot. I have lost a little weight_ but that was only because I started working out and put myself on a diet. So Lupron had no affect on me in that department. The vaginal dryness is quite irritating_ but compared to bleeding for 60+ days_ it's not all that irritating. You just have to take the good with the bad_ and make the call based upon your own judgement_ not anybody elses horror stories.~GOD BLESS~,F,33,11  days,3/22/2007,Lupron

But the side effects were intolerable_ I have never been so unwell in all my life. I landed in psychiatric emergency with suicidal thoughts and severe anxiety. Lupron made me feel insane_ anxious and depressed and I was on Ativan as a result. I was frightened while on this drug and worry about long-term effects. Lupron continues to affect me almost 2 months after my last dose_ though it is getting much better. I found alternative therapies (Japanese accupuncture and Chinese herbs) to really have helped. I was told by a nurse and by my accupunturist that Lupron can be hard on the liver and sometimes the body has a hard time eliminating it. Good luck to everyone whos suffered on this drug. AVOID LUPRON or at least be fully warned about its possible side effects. BTW my doc was very sympathetic & did not dismiss my nasty experience.

753, 5, endometriosis,Hot Flashes,I loved it!    I just finished a 6 month course of treatment and it was the best six months ever.  Usually I am kind of paralyzed with pain for about a week a month and it felt so good to go 6 months without having to deal with that.   After the initial two weeks_ which was full of cramps and heavy bleeding_ I started feeling better and better.   I would be on  it for the rest of my life_ but no doctor recommends that for someone so young because of the possibilities osteoperosis. The hot flashes were kind of intense for a few months but they were really no big deal.   My friends would joke with me when they'd see me fan myself.  I'd take hot flashes over cramps any day.,F,29,6  months,8/15/2006,Lupron

It was attached to various organs in my body_ but they couldn't just do a small surgery because they were uncertain what it was.  I had NO pain and was extremely suprised when my gyno suggested that I get an ultrasound.  I now have a ""c-section"" scar and no kids yet....but I was glad to hear it wasn't cancer.I was very reluctant to take the Lupron shot because of everything that I had read about teh side effects.  I did start to get a little ""crazy"" teh first month and my doctor recommended that I try the shot along with Zoloft  (an anti-anxiety drug). the combination of these two were unreal.  It was the perfect balance.  I was energized and actually lost 10 lbs_ I didn't feel anxious_ depressed_ obsessive.....it was great.  The only side effect that i had was hot flashes - but that wasn't a big deal to me.What I am more concerned with now is that i am off",F,28,6  months,8/11/2006,Lupron

I had excessive bleeding and could not go to the store or on a long drive fearing I would ruin the front seat of my car.  The first month the bleeding stopped and subsequent months thereafter no period at all.  There was a month or two when I had a breakthrough bleeding but that did not last long and was not much to contend with.  I do remember calling the doctor after the 2nd month due to a burning feeling in the uterus_ but that lasted one day only.  It felt as though the fibroid was dying off_ that is the only way I can describe it.

I think the people who take it and have good results are in the minority.,F,30,2  months,9/30/2005Email,Lupron
789, 1, To suppress estrogen after breast,Debilitating muscle and joint pain that went on for months.  I stopped taking it_ but am completely run down and exhausted as a result - plus I gained a lot of weight as I felt terrible and had to stop exercising.

790, 5, Endometriosis,Occassional hot flashes_ nausea.,My husband wants to send my doc flowers after I received one shot_ due for the second next week. (Did the two/six months). I was miserable for about 10 years before getting the shot_ but am glad I did. My entire mood changed_ probably because I wasn't feeling so bad. My frequent migraines_ cramps and mood swings disappeared. The only problem I've had so far is now at the end of the three-month period of the first shot_ I feel like I can tell the shot is wearing off  I've been getting some cramping in my leg and utie area_ but fortunately haven't seen any bleeding yet. I read a lot on this before doing it_ and am glad I did. I only hope the second shot lasts longer as I do not want to have to undergo a hysterectomy.,F,27,3  months,9/1/2005,Lupron

792, 4, Endometriosis,Some weight gainNight sweatsSome mood swings,So far this drug has helped immensely_ no more painful periods_ no more periods for three weeks out of the month_ and the side effects that I was terrified of are almost non-existent. I was afraid from reading sites like these_ but I think part of the problem is people like me_ who are loving what the shot is doing for them_ don't take the time to express their thoughts. Yet the people who have had difficult experiences want everyone to know about it_ so they post. Be cautious_ read up_ but don't always take other peoples experiences to heart. Everyone is different and will react in a different way. The slight negative side effects I have experienced so far are well worth the positive side effects I listed above. My quality of life is so much better than it has been in three years. I am taking the shot twice (1 shot every three months) and my second shot is scheduled for next week. I am slightly nervous again_ in case any other side effects pop up_ but other than that_ I look forward to the continued relief that this affords me from my endo.,F,24,3  months,8/11/2005,Lupron

794, 2, Aid in invitro fertilization,The first two times i did ivf i experienced weight gain and hot flashes.  After the failed cycles i was able to lose the weight pretty quickly and the hot flashes went away as soon as i stopped using it.  This time_ I am not having hot flashes_ but I did gain weight again and after two weeks of using Lupron I have a persisent headache.  Mood swings and extreme sensitivity (crying for no reason) are also mild side effects for me.  The side effects suck_ but the desire to have a baby is stronger than the temporary suffering for me.,,F,36,3  weeks,7/10/2005,Lupron
795, 1, ENDOMETRIOSIS,My side effects happen every month about 2 weeks out from my periond I would get very bad lower back pain. I could not stand it_ it would feel as if someone was beating me in my back.then when my period came my back pain felt worse and then when my period came it felt like my insides were falling out.,Lupron is the most intense drug I have ever taken and would not take it again. I got the hot flashes right away_ headaches_ vomiting_ hair loss_ my mouth taste like pennies. My Doctor said she has never heard anything like this so she sent me to the ER to get lab work. The ER doctor said I was not an emergency so I had to leave. My doctor will not return my calls. I call every day atleast 5 times a day.. Hmmm must be nice to be a doctor to get paid the money they do and not follow thru. If it were up to me NEVER AGAIN. Im just lucky I have a paitent husband. Oh did I mention I can cry just like that. Think about what you are doing. all the research I did I should have not done this to myself,F,28,2  days,7/1/2005Email,Lupron
796, 4, Endometriosis,Memory problems_ weight gain_ fatigue & mood swings,I read all the comments/reviews on the internet before I decided to take Lupron.  I was very concerned with all the negative reports I read_ but my choices were limited as I couldn't afford a laproscopy.  My doctor and RN assured me that most women have little to no symptoms_ so I went ahead with it.  In the beginning (the 1st shot)_ the endometriosis symptoms got much worse (this to be expected)_ I was extremely tired and weepy.  After about 3-4 weeks_ I seemed to adjust to the medication.  Since then_ I've been pretty amazed at how little symptoms I've experienced.  Probably the most irritating are the memory lapses and the weight gain (I can't lose it no matter how much I workout or eat healthy).  I'm in my 6th month of the Lupron and am hoping that once it's done_ everything will be normal.,F,31,6  months,6/10/2005Email,Lupron
797, 1, Adenomyosis_ Endometreosis,Headaches_ hot flashes_ insomnia_ constipation_ mood swings_ depression_ burning skin_ itchy skin_ bloating_ fatigue_ memory issues - have to keep everything in a calendar now.,I am supposed to get my 4th shot next week.  I get it once a month.  However_ last Friday my period started again.  At first it was a little light_ but now at 7 days_ it's heavier.  I also am experiencing major cramps and bloating.  I have a hysterectomy scheduled for July 13th.  I'm totally unhappy on Lupron.  I tell my doctor each month that I don't want it and he claims I need it.  Now_ I have all the side effects plus my period.  I called the doctor and they said that if the bleeding doesn't stop they'll put me on estrogen.  So - they've stopped my estrogen with a drug with lots of side effects and now have to give me back estrogen (with lots of side effects).  Avoid this drug if possible.  I feel like it's really thrown me for a loop.,F,37,3  months,5/20/2005Email,Lupron
798, 3, adenomyosis,muscle pain_ severe headaches_ hot flashes_ night sweats_ mood swings_ weight gain,Lupron is not a wonder drug_ as the manufacturer claims.  It can be helpful in situations where other drug therapies have failed and the patient wishes to avoid or delay surgery.  It has stopped the pain of adenomyosis (think labor pains) for me_ so I cannot wholly discount the drug's usefulness_ but anyone considering using Lupron should be well aware of all the possible side effects.  I was warned of hot flashes and vaginal dryness_ nothing more_ and I now wish that I had taken the time to look into other possible side effects.  The worst of the side effects for me are the muscle pains and awful headaches_ both of which I might have been able to prepare for had I known they were coming.  Also_ sadly_ the weight gain puts me further away from surgery than I was before I had the injection; if you are considering Lupron as a pre-surgical therapy_ keep in mind that it can have adverse effects on your surgical risk factors.Lupron will likely do you some good if you are in pain due to hormone-driven diseases like endometriosis_ adenomyosis or fibroids.  However_ I strongly suggest that you make sure you know exactly what you are getting yourself into before you take the leap of faith with an irreversible three-month injection.,F,28,2  months,5/14/2005Email,Lupron

800, 4, Stage IV Endometriosis,Hotflashes; nightsweats,I originally went into the hospital because they found a cyst on my right ovary.  After the surgery (laproscopic) it was determined that I had severe endo and probably had it my whole life.  It was decided at that time that I would do a 3 month course of Lupron followed up by a full abdominal hysterectomy.  I just received my 3rd shot today_ and the only side effect that I have experienced at all are hotflashes/nightsweats.  I have a previous history of anxiety and depression.  I also suffer from a weight problem_ so after reading much of the feedback from websites I was very nervous about losing my mind and gaining tons of weight once on Lupron.  I am pleased to be a positive light on the use of this medication_ because I have found it very beneficial.  In fact_ I never realized how miserable I was until I began the injections and started feeling better.  As I have never tried to get pregnant and have always lived my life with heavy periods lasting more than 10 days each month accompanied by severe pain during ovulation and terrible cramps throughout_ I am so glad to be rid of all of my pain and the bloated feeling that I have always felt is gone.  Even though I have been conscious of what I have been eating while on the medication_ because I was nervous of gaining weight_ I have actually lost weight (approx 15 pounds in 60 days) without eliminating an occasional piece of cake or dish of ice cream.  My surgery is scheduled May 20th and I am turning 40 tomorrow and I am feeling like I am beginning a whole new pain free chapter in my life and can't wait to find out what the end of this journey has in store for my well being.  I certainly don't want to discredit anyone's personal experience on this drug_ but after almost making the decision NOT to take this medication because of what I read_ I felt it incredibly important to add my positive experience.  The hotflashes are frequent (15-20 per day)_ but certainly not debilitating and they don't last for more than 2-5 minutes.  I have not suffered from any anxiety_ headaches_ weight gain_ hair loss_ or insomnia_ all of which I feared if I took this medication. I also had a spinal fusion 14  years ago so I was nervous about the bone density of my fusion being deminished by the medication but my doctor said that the Lupron would not have any effect on the strengh or stability of the bones.  I don't believe that I am a person with a high pain tolerance or a person who handles not feeling good well_ however_ from my personal experience_ I FEEL GREAT!  I decided to take the monthly injections so that if I had any adverse reactions I could have the choice to stop after each month.  I expressed all of my fears and anxieties with both my OBGYN and my regular doctor.  They both took the time to give me their professional opinions related to my concerns.  They told me that the potential for side effects were possible_ but that the majority of the people who take the medication_ either for endomedtriosis_ fibroids_ or prostate cancer_ had no serious adverse reactions beyond hotflashes and possibily some headaches.  Every person has to make their own decision_ but know that there is a person out there who is glad that they took LUPRON.,F,39,3  months,4/28/2005Email,Lupron

803, 1, Fiborids,Extremely bad Hot flashes and Night sweats. bone pain_ bone loss_ more weight gain than I was originally getting from the fiborids_ couldn't sleep_ and other problems.,I made a point of letting the doctor know that I did not want a histerectomy. I went to him because I was told that he had done remove other people tumors without them having the surgery.  I ask him if he could do anything else_ he said he would put me on the Lupron and that would shrink it. I had no idea what this medication was other than it was suppose to shrink the tumor because I was never told anything about it.  He would order it at the pharmacy the morning of my appointment and have me pick it up and bring it to the office with me and than the nurse would mix it and give me a shot.  i was on this medicine for 4 to 5 months.  Each month I had a shot. Each time that I would have the shot I would pick up weight_ almost looking like I was full of fluid.  The first shot my period stopped completely and than the other problems started to occur.  It felt like the fibroids were getting bigger and I definitely got bigger it seem like I gained 10 pounds each time they gave me a shot. I became weaker and worn out. I couldn't sleep and I couldn't lay on my stomach because it was getting larger because the fibroids was growing and getting bigger.  I ask him before he gave me the first shot was there anything that I shouldn't do to incourage the growth of the fibroids he said no.  By the second shot all the side effects I named and than some was occurring on the third shot the nurse ask me was I having trouble sleeping at nights and I told her yes and she said oh_ thats just a side effect from the medicine.  I had trouble getting up in the morning_ my bones hurt and  I was walking like someone who had a bad case of arthritis.  I stayed ringing wet a lot of the times from the hot flashes and night sweats.  After going through all this the doctor said to me after the fifth shot that the medicine did not shrink the tumor it did nothing for it. Of course he didn't bother to give me anymore test to check he just felt around on my stomach and said that it didn't work. If he had told me from the beginning about the side effects of this medications and that it was possible that it wouldn't work I wouldn't have taken it. Because he did the surgery anyway and I haven't been the same since.  I had always been a very healthy person but since the medication and the surgery I haven't been the same since.  This medicine has some extremely bad side effects and should be a persons last choice and should never be giving to anyone until the doctor sits down and explain the side effects because there will be side effects_ some patients may not have the same side effect as the other one but once again there will be some.  I know someone out there is going to respond by saying all drugs has some side effects but has anyone notice that every drug out there anymore has a list of side effects with them_ side effects that will happen not that could happen.  The difference is that years again a drug may have had a side effect or two but usually you didn't have them and if you did they weren't as severe.  Now you fix your heart and destroy your liver or fix your kidney and mess up your bones just a example. Maybe we are trying to get these drugs on the market too fast and there aren't enough test being done on them before they are put on the shelves for consumers to buy.  Getting better is what every patient wants but fixing one problem and making another one is not getting better.  We are now robbing peter to pay paul with medicine anymore.  Doctors need to let the patients know what may and may not happen and not expect the patient to find out on their own.  I forgot to say that after I started experiences all those side effects I had to go to the computer and than I got a lot of magazines after everything was over to find out about the drug lupron and also what I could have done to help shrink my tumors and what I shouldn't have been during to incourage the growth of them but of course my doctor said that there wasn't anything_ boy wasn't I misled. Of course_ the doctors should also take responsibity for this problem because they should make sure each patient knows the advantage and disadvantage of taking a drug that they recommend since they suppose to know the history of that patient.  Just because the medicine suppose to work_ it may not be the best thing for that person.  So please anyone who is offer this or any other drug thank about it before you just take it.   Again_ there is too many drugs out here now that has too many side effects meaning sometimes there's more harm done to you than good.,F,49,5  months,3/24/2005Email,Lupron
