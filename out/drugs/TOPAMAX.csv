6, 3, cluster headache_ chronic migraines,Tiredness_ some nausea,Also take for absence seizures and as adjunct to bipolar meds.  It  doesn't work well for cluster headaches or chronic migraines but it's still better than nothing. It seems to help absence seizures but I'm also on 400 mg lamictal for those so who knows?  Also unsure if its effect on bipolar disorder as I take a lot of other meds for that.,F,34,2  years200 mg,6/5/2016,Topamax

8, 4, Migraines,Tingling in fingers. Hair loss so I went off the Topamax but then the chronic headaches came back. Word loss. Initial weight loss of 70 lbs due to feeling full and I used it to my advantage because I needed to lose the weight. I also lost all taste for alcohol. Haven't had any desire to drink in over 3-1/2 yrs. drank regularly all my life before Topamax.,When I noticed the hair loss I stopped taking Topamax but had to go back on it because of the chronic migraines. The Topamax seems to really work for me as far as the migraines. The only other thing that works for my migraines is not legal in my stupid state. (MJ). So I will be taking the Topamax until they get smart and legalize it. Fortunately for me the loss of words isn't terrible. Tingling has pretty much subsided except when cold. I've kept the weight off but had to work at it. Hair loss doesn't seem to be so bad. The headaches are way worse than most anything because mine are the kind that don't totally dibilitate but last 2 to 3 weeks. My job is reading and reviewing files all day long. You can't do that when your head hurts and all you want to do is go home and sleep so it's Topamax for me cause they tell me there's nothing else. I can't take pain meds during the day because I fall asleep at my desk. Besides they don't really get rid of the pain - maybe for 10-20 min.,F,64,1  years200 mgs,5/28/2016,Topamax
9, 1, Migraines,Distaste for carbonated beverages_ irritability_ confusion_ rage.,It's actually my (ex) wife that's taking topamax for migraines.  First she lost 30lbs which caused an attraction to the drug_ she says there are no more migraines.  After 3 mo I first asked her to stop taking it after noticing a behavior change.  After that nothing I could do was right_ 9 mos later I hear she wants to divorce me.  We have a very successful business_ nice imcome _ just finished building a new house.  The rage got worse I suggested at that point to separate.  I'm now divorced after 16 years together_ have a 9 yr old boy that we share custody_ I loved my family_ I hate this drug,F,45,1  years25mg 1X D,5/21/2016,Topamax
10, 1, Trigeminal Neuropathy,Mental imbalanceConfusionDesperate and disturbing thoughts ,I was given this drug as treatment for a neuropathic condition.I was warned by the doctor there may be issues_ but that I would know pretty quickly whether or not the drug was suited for me. Yes_ that was correct!  On the 2nd dose_ I could tell something felt different in my brain. I was processing things differently --and distant (not so good) memories were coming back in a rush_ as if they had just occurred.By day 4 when thoughts of suicide raced through my mind_ thankfully I was still lucid enough to know it was the drug and I had to stop taking it.  ,F,59,7  days10 1X D,5/20/2016,Topamax
11, 1, Headaches,My doctor prescribed me this for headaches. Did not work! I was constantly tired_ had tingling everywhere_ and lost 10 pounds because I had no appetite.,Of course everyone is different. So if this works for you_ great!,F,21,2  months100mg,5/20/2016,Topamax
12, 1, Migraines,Started off slow at 25mg to 50mg to 75mg for awhile. The MOMENT I was turned up to 100mg_ severe UTI. One after the other. Every time I would try taking the topamax_ another UTI. So I stopped. I no longer have signs of infection. I have developed chronic severe life ending pelvic and back pain. Had a cystoscopy done to check for IC which I don't really have. Topamax has ruined my life altogether. DO NOT TAKE IT. I would give anything to go back a year ago and have never taken that drug that ruined my existence. I now have permanent nerve damage and no quality of life.,PLEASE if anyone has had similar side effects do not hesitate to contact me. I can't be the only one to have a ruined life from this drug. It took a long time to get a doctor to admit and agree with me that it was the topamax that caused my problem. It was always within hours that the UTI would show up. I stopped the medication back in May of 2015. It is now May 2016 and I am worse than ever.,F,34,7  months100mg,5/9/2016Email,Topamax
13, 5, Uncontrolled migraines,I have increased my taper from 25 to 50 and noticed sleepiness the first day_ but not the second. Some indigestion_ but not intolerable.

It is life changing.,F,39,1  weeks50 mg,5/1/2016,Topamax
14, 1, Cluster headaches,Depression_ increased pain_ anxiety_ unable to eat_ fixation issues_ not feeling myself at all.,Not at all a good med for me. Even if clusters stopped this would not be worth it. Had more success (however limited) through regular massage and oxygen. If I had not suffered these conditions earlier in life and not know what they are_ the added distress would be unbearable. I have had clusters for over a year.,F,33,4  days25mg,4/30/2016Email,Topamax
15, 1, Migraine,Paranoid_ anxiety_ depression_ diarrhea . I have never had depression and I was so bad off that I couldn't get out of bed. I was paranoid beyond reason and that started me feeling anxious about everything. I have mild IBS to begin with but Topamax made it so much worse. I had to go off it because of the side effects,Nightmare drug for me and I was told that the side effects would stabilize after a few weeks. They never got better they got worse.,M,43,3  months100 2X D,4/27/2016,Topamax

18, 2, Migraine_  leg pains,It seemed ok for a very long time and I don't know what changed but I've become extremely paranoid_  drudging about things from the past that shouldn't be drudge up. Feeling sad and alone. It's like...WTF is this med doing.,,F,49,5  years,4/12/2016,Topamax
19, 1, migraines and nerve pain,I took it last night at 9pm. I couldnt fall asleep until 3am. Didn't feel to bad. A little difficult to wake up. Nerve pain was worse. All day today I have been edging on a migraine and feeling odd. Those symptoms are not too far off from normal unfortunately but I can at least maintain my mood and ability to stay awake. I found myself very very angry about things that do not normally bother me at all. I kept it all inside my head because I know its not me_ its this medication. I also kept falling asleep every time I sat down. Im dizzy and im having a hard time communicating. I feel poisoned.,I dont know if the side effects are worth the benefits... Im afraid to take it again honestly... I wouldnt be surprised if this drug is recalled. Bad Vibes,F,37,1  days25 mg,4/12/2016,Topamax
20, 1, Seizures_ Brain Mass,Started out as extreme tiredness_ which I can't complain about too much seeing as I've had insomnia since I was 8. So that's not too bad but the med's have been making me extremely moody and irritable which aren't good at all. I can't be around too much talking or I get annoyed easily and just want everyone to go away. Besides that they've been giving me extreme headaches(even though the doctors said they were headache medications too). But the main thing I am focused on is the pain. For the past two weeks it hasn't been nearly as easy to breath_ if I had to guess what it's like to have asthma_ this would be it. I have a constant cough when I breath and If I work too hard at work my breathing turns into heaving. My muscles feel like they barely work at all. And there is a sharp shooting pain in my upper abdomen area. I'm not 100% sure if these are things that will fade out in time or not_ again I've only been on the medicine for a month. Everything seems to fluctuate except the breathi,"They should be nicknamed the ""succubus"" pills. Because they suck the life out of you....",F,20,31  days25mg 4X D,4/9/2016Email,Topamax

22, 5, Uncontrolled Migraines,None so far...,I took the first dose last night before bed and I woke up today completely headache free!!  I am on a taper increase dose so I will take 25 MG for one week_ then increase to 50 MG for one week_ then 100 MG at bedtime until reevaluated by my Headace Specialist. I hope this medication will help with my migraines. I have tried nearly everything else. If this medication works it will be worth any negative side effects. At least for me anyways!,F,35,1  days25 MG,3/23/2016,Topamax
23, 1, Migraine preventative,It turned me into a paranoid schizophrenic,"My pain management doctor prescribed this in hopes it would reduce the number of migraines I was getting. I hadn't taken it for more than a week when I began to feel strange ""in the head"". This drug had me cowering in the corner_ afraid someone was coming into my home. I would beg my husband not to leave for work because being alone began to terrify me. I felt detached from the world around me and everything was unreal. When I was forced to go out to buy groceries_ I quickly threw items into the cart as having people around me caused great anxiety. All the while I felt like I was walking 2 feet above the floor. Upon getting home I would go to bed and literally hide under the covers until my husband came home. Often he would find me cowering in the corner of the room.It took me a while to realize it was the Topamax. I immediately stopped it and within two weeks I was back to my normal self but it was one of the worst experiences ever.   Apparently the drug altered the neurotransmitters in my brain_ causing such a horrible reaction. The only good to come of it was that I did gain a new understanding of what for many people is a permanent and frightening mental illness. Schizophrenia is no joke and nothing to make fun of.",F,66,3  weeks50 MG 2X D,3/19/2016Email,Topamax
24, 4, Migraine,Fatigue_ weight loss_ irritability_ inability to concentrate or find words_ over emotional at times,I have been on the medicine for almost 2 weeks and already lost 8 lbs. week one I was taking 50mg and now 75mg. No appetite_ then when I do eat_ it's like I get full really fast. That's NOT normal for me at all! Easily irritated and crying over things that are not worth crying over...quite pitiful. No urge to end my life_ not so much depressed but sometimes feel a little blue. Still too early to tell but so far I'm emotional and withering away...,F,25,2  weeks75mg,3/18/2016,Topamax
25, 5, Migraine,The side effects that I experience are extremely hot feet which regularly blister (standing in the shower or just a puddle is an amazingly relaxing experience) the doctor prescribed a gell but E45 seemed to do a better job. Continuing feelings or paranoia_ I initially started om 150mg twice per day but this may me feel suicidal_ reducing the dosage improved the outlook considerably but I dream of getting even with people before situations exist. I wish that I had the same issue with losing weight that everyone else is complaining about nut maybe it is all of the other pills that I have to take for my heart.,,M,55,6  years75mg 2X D,2/21/2016,Topamax
26, 4, Mood Disorder,Tingling feet_ unable to process thoughts_ shaky hands_ weight loss_ appetite loss.,Although I have been enduring many side effects_ the side effects are starting to calm down now. It takes about 10-14 days being on this particular drug to get Accustomed to. I am on topomax because I was recently diagnosed with a mood disorder_ similar to bipolar but not. It calms me_ and keeps me stabilized to the point where I am feeling like I am not fighting a war inside my head. I would rather deal with the side effects then my mood disorder_ that is for sure!,F,24,1  months100 Mg,2/14/2016,Topamax
27, 1, Mood Stabilzer/Possible Weight Loss,"The first three days I took only one pill a day at 25 mgs. It was ok. I felt a little ""flat"" but not in a bad way. The fourth day I went up to two pills a day as recommended by the shrink. It was alright although I began to feel brain dead at work. Speaking my own language was a challenge at times_ food was tasting weird_ I could barely keep my eyes open at my desk. This past Saturday I slept about 18 hours straight. Today_ two days later_ my skull feels like a metal helmet_ I had waves of nausea all day long but couldn't eat anything all day to throw up. I considered going to the Emergency room but I didn't think they could do anything for me.The shrink told me to cut back by one pill but I just want to go cold turkey. I want this stuff out of my body. What a mistake! The Prozac was fine. If it ain't broke_ don't fix it!!!",I have been on Prozac for 20 years. I wanted to discuss possibly reducing my prescription but the psychiatrist thought to supplement with Topamax? I will admit the possibility of losing weight did lure me in even though I would be more medicated. I would rather be my chubby funny self than a nauseous zombie.

28, 1, Complex migraine prevention,Anisocoria of the left eye.Altered state of consciousness lasting far beyond discontinuation of drug.,I was given this drug for complex migraines and the morning after the first dose resulted in altered consciousness and anisocoria where the left eye was dilated and less reactive to light than the other eye. I was promptly told to discontinue the drug by my doctor and have ever since had more blurred vision - slight double vision at times - and a frequent manifestation of the conditions mentioned. I've had people mention the anisocoria many times_ always the same effect. It continues to burden me with a majorly frequent 'haze' of altered consciousness_ or a 'dopey' feeling.,M,23,1  times25 MG 1X D,1/18/2016Email,Topamax
29, 1, Migraines,Hair loss_ loss of words_ writing and typing appear dyslexic_ brain fog_ anxiety_ loss of cognitive function at usual level. Muscle aches in back_ neck and shoulders. My eye sight deteriorated rapidly from 20/20 vision.,This medication did help with my migraines_ i have been off the medication for a year and i am still not how i was prior to taking the medication. I do not believe that my vision or memory_ brain function will return to how i once was.,F,42,4  months50 1X D,1/3/2016,Topamax
30, 4, Migraines/tension headaches,tiredness_ mental fog_ dizziness_ a bit of diarrhea,I was prescribed topomax because I can't take excedrin due to a caffeine sensitivity and naproxen wasn't working. I was getting tension headaches EVERY SINGLE DAY_ and they would often escalate into migraines. At first I was started with 25mg but that wasn't enough to prevent the migraines so I went to 50 mg. It prevents my migraines and tension headaches 75% of the time. Occasionally I have break through tension headaches and I ALWAYS get migraines on my period_ even with the topomax. It does a pretty good job but it doesn't prevent every migraine.,F,20,1  years50 mg 1X D,12/29/2015,Topamax
31, 3, migraines,I was on 25 mg first and only had the tingling in my feet in hands_ memory loss_ and slowed reaction time but now I'm on 50 mg and I have extremem fatigue.

32, 1, Migraine,Initially:tingling in hands and feet_ nausea_ insomnia_ difficulty finding words_ spelling and completing basic math computation_ loss of appetite_ change of taste and smells.  Tingling and nausea eventually subsided.  After approx 8 weeks: Hair loss.,Though this drug was difficult to adjust to_ I stuck it out.  The nausea was extreme in the beginning_ but did eventually subside after a few weeks.  I woke up at 4:30 every morning and could not get back to sleep.  It did stop my daily migraines that I was suffering from.  After about a month_ I felt great_ despite the mental cloudiness that was difficult to manage.  For example_ I struggled to remember driving routes I had traveled for years.  I decided it was a trade-off I was willing to make.  Unfortunately_ one day I noticed my hair texture had changed.  My normally thick_ shiny_ manageable hair became dry and brittle.  Then the shedding started_ approximately 2 months after I began taking the medicine.  I tried to stick it out_ but I lost close to 50% of my hair in the 2 weeks that followed.  I discontinued.  I have now been off the drug for a month_ and my hair is still shedding and there has been little improvement in texture.  I am hopeful that my hair will grow back_ but this has been very stressful.  My headache specialist has prescribed Zonegran as an alternative_ but I am weary of anything now_ especially because a month off of the medication has resulted in little improvement on the hair loss front.,F,39,2  months50 mg qd,12/15/2015,Topamax

I went from having daily migraines to about 1 a month. What I thought was typical depression spiraled into the worst feelings ever_ hopelessness_ anxiety attacks and constant fatigue. As the months passed it all got worse. So far I've dropped about 22 pounds_ and I cry for no reasons at times. My hair began thinning horribly about 7 months into taking the med. I've had my vision checked_ all is well. I take 50 mg each night but I've decided to go off the med due to the negative side effects. It helped my migraines so much which is the only plus. It's been a little over 1 year and these effects have intensified GREATLY. I rarely sleep peacefully. Time for a change!,F,25,1  years50mg,12/10/2015,Topamax
35, 4, Migraines,Cannot drink any carbonated beverages due to horrible taste_ lost about 12 pounds in the very beginning which I think is due to switching from soda to water.,Topamax has really helped with my migraines_ I was shocked to see all the terrible side effects on here. My boyfriend_ his mom_ aunt and my mom all take Topamax for various reasons and none of us have had any of these serious side effects. I think if you do start to have some side effects to mention it to your Dr. because every body is different and tolerates medication differently.,F,24,6  months100 1X D,11/29/2015,Topamax

39, 2, Neuropathy,Confusion_ dizziness,Topamax did nothing for neuropathy. Side effects subsided to a tolerable level in under a month.

43, 4, Alcohol dependence and Bi-polar II,Tingling in feet_ word retrieval issues_ fatigue_ weight loss,Topamax helped curb my cravings for alcohol tremendously. It was as if I hadn't ever even drank. It also helped stabilize my moods and make better decisions beyond just not drinking. Unfortunately I had to stop taking it due to a liver issue that wasn't related to topamax. (Ironic to stop drinking and have your liver go to hell!)

Wondering if people losing weight from not having interest in eating/drinking those things again??? I don't regularly eat them but still hoping for the weight lost selling point *cough*cough* side effect.. I am almost positive that the increased frequency & loose stool is associated with high carb or high sugar intake on this medicine (again does this factor into weight loss).

I stopped the drug because i didn't want to lose more weight.  Took me 3 years to figure out it had caused my gradual thinning/loss of 1/3 - 1/2 of hair.  I believe the hair loss is a widespread side effect which is greatly under reported by patients and the drug companies.  It is so gradual yet steady many do not notice it or think it is due to aging..Everybody I know and patients I know (I am a RN) who are on this drug lose a large amount of hair.

If you need migraine meds or psych meds there are far better options.  YOU DO NOT WANT TO PERMANENTLY DAMAGE YOUR BRAIN WITH THIS TOPAMAX STUFF.  TRUST ME ON THIS.  CHOOSE A DIFFERENT DRUG,got irrational fears in the night of demons coming for me. ended up sleeping with the light on for a month because it messed up my brain so bad.  Felt scared out of my mind for no reason like i was 4 years old again.  Unusual aches and pains and took about a month to start to feel normal again.  It's been exactly one year since I took this poison.  Went to the ER that same night because I thought it was destroying my brain.  Caused stroke-like symptoms a couple hours after taking it on top of what I've already listed.  I get that some people need psych meds to function_ but this stuff is an absolute poison.  Read up on it and you'll see that the memory impairment often becomes permanent even after you stop the drug.  I'm off all meds now and doing fine.  Trust me when I tell you to avoid this stuff.

Mental fogginess_ confusion_ feelings of wanting to pass out also lasted about a week_ however that happened in higher stress situations and I simply stopped going to work to avoid that from happening. I have had stomach pains randomly a couple of days. Apathy towards things I normally love_ irritation.  Definitely increased urination. Not hungry_ food tastes like nothing or unappetizing. After a week_ developed a sinus issue with throat drainage and sinus bleeding.,It is a scary drug with too many side effects. If all of these side effects I've experienced aren't enough to make me quit_ the ones in the future (the kidney stones_ withdrawals) should do it.  They say it takes 6 mos for topamax to build up in your system_ so I assume 6 mos for it to get out of your system after you stop_ or however long you took it. I got a migraine day 5 and day 9 and the medicine shows me how sweet life can be with this monster in my head_ I could cry from sheer joy. But topamax has taken away my desire to simply eat to live_ as I'm not a big eater. I'm withering away to nothingness. And now I have sinus issues. Bloody phlegm/sinuses.

Topamax took my migraines away almost 100%  Now I only get 1 if I have insomnia ( menopause :( ) and haven't slept well for many nights. I am realizing that the side effects besides thinner hair_ weight loss of a few lbs and some muscle cramps might be worse than I thought. I was reading others experiences and I think my vision problems & crushing fatigue may be related to Topamax? I think I may need to go off it! My neurologist prescribed it as my reg. dr won't even prescribe it! Hint Hint that it's serious stuff_ but when you have a constant migraine you don't really care! I also am tired of being a complete couch potato. I have NO energy anymore at all. I also have lost my memory & feel stupid. Ok time to try something _ anything else- there must be another option?!?

Went to the doctor for the constant throat clearing and was given an antibiotic even though I had no other symptoms other than a cough. Went back when the antibiotics were gone and no relief. Doctor thought may be acid reflux and gave me a prescription for that. During the appointment I was asked if I had been on any new medications. I mentioned Topamax. She said that wouldn't do it. That evening_ looked up the detailed list of side effects on WebMD and saw ""condition in which stomach acid is pushed into the esophagus"". Looked at the date I had the prescription filled then at the calendar and it was exactly how long I told the doctor I had been having the problem. Went back the next day and told my doctor to take me off of it.

Unable to stand for more than five minutes. Dehydrated_ even though I was drinking 90+ ounces of water a day. Stomach felt like I had swallowed a handful of razor blades and they were swirling around in there. Pain was horrible. This drug should be taken OFF the market. Unbelievable the side effects it has. Stay on it a year and you're pretty sure to end up with kidney stones. Great. Stops your bodies ability to sweat? That doesn't sound healthy in the least. I wouldn't take this POISON again for a million dollars.,**and to the SNOT who said ''I dont understand all these side effects these people are having from this drug its not a narcotic so they are probably imagining or reading other peoples comments there is nothing in this drug to whack you out!!!!'' I am SO glad this medicine is working for you but how DARE you imply the rest of us are idiots reading stuff on the internet then playing it out.

I used to get migraines lasting weeks at a time and would keep me from working for days.

Also_ every time i lightly hit my arm or leg at something a very dark bruise forms and stays for like 10 days it's embarassing and scary. I recently noticed a little hair falling out. Tiredness. When i tried 100mg i felt dizziness_ like i was going to pass out. Where did all the bubbles go?,After 2 weeks on 50mg i tried 100mg and felt sick. After noticing these side effects and not losing a pound or the desire to binge_ this drug didn't help my problem so i'm weaning off. Knowing it works for so many people on weight loss/binge eating_ at least i tried it. But the fact that it incresead my appetite and my binge episodes was too much. I had to quit.

I hardly get any now from being on the Topamax for me it has been a life saver. At the beginning I did experience weird vision issues in low light. Kind of trails and light halos but I stuck it out and they went away just fine. My eye dr said my eyes were fine. In the adjustment phase my brain was sort of catching up with my eyes in a way. Most people may not have waited through this but this medicine was the only thing that helped me. I hope it helps others. I did also loose about 20 lbs which was an added bonus but after a year or two I gained it all back and I'm still on the medicine I have no idea what will happen when I go off of it.,F,36,5  years50 MG 3X D,1/12/2015Email,Topamax

119, 1, Chronic Daily Headache/Migraine,First no side effects at all but started at 12.5 mg. Titrated to 37.5 slowly and that's when the hell started. This drug dried me out completely; each and every body part inside and out! Lungs_ nose_ mouth_ tongue_ throat. It was awful. No amount of water (and let me tell you I drank copious amounts_ round the clock) could hydrate my body. I've never experienced anything like it. Also horrible insomnia. Night after night without any sleep whatsoever.  I did a lot of research before I took the drug but couldn't take the headaches any longer. After being on Topamax for a short period of time_ I'll take the headaches over the side effects produced by this poison. It was also very frustrating when my neurologist insisted that the extreme dehydration and insomnia were not reported while on Topamax. A simple search on drugs.com come up with these side effects immediately. If you spend any time googling the drug you will find report after report of patients complaining of these such symptoms. Makes you wonder if the doctors are even paying attention...,,F,52,4  weeks37.5 mg,1/8/2015,Topamax
120, 1, Migraine Headaches,RAGE_ ANGER and IRRITABILITY,I cannot believe how angry I got on this drug.  I really_ really wanted to take it long enough to see if it would help prevent my migraines_ but I was only on it for 2 weeks before I HAD to get off.  The normal everyday things in life that make you mad were making me SEVERELY AGNRY.  I was lashing out at myself_ at my husband_ and at my poor 3 year old twins.  I HATED everyone.  I HATED everything.  I became anti-social and dreaded everything in life that normally makes me happy (and this included being around my kids!).  Not cool.  I went cold turkey off this stuff (and I was only on 25mg a day!).  I am on day 4 of no Topamax and I feel SO much better!  I wish I could have seen if this worked_ but there was no way I was going to continue on this medication. My Neurologist said that everyone is different_ so if you're about to start taking Topamax_ you may not experience what I did.  However_ if you find yourself more angry than usual or full of rage as the days go on_ get off this stuff! I had no other side effects.,F,39,2  weeks25 mg 1X D,1/6/2015Email,Topamax

No drug is worth my hair falling out_ so I stopped taking it without titrating off of it as per my neurologist.  I am getting rebound headaches_ but I'm hoping that my hair will stop falling out as the drug leaves my system.

My migraine eased off after a week and no dizziness. I do feel anxious sometimes and have trouble sleeping. I woke up one night and had no idea where I was_ I was sitting straight up in my bed.  I am very constipated and it is driving me crazy. I am very moody_ my daughter told me to go get a pack of cigarettes. I can eat or do without_ it really doesn't matter to me.

I am having a lot of hair thinning problems. I am also having short term memory loss. I have problems with my gait being unsteady. I feel like I'm in a fog all the time. I'm also having problems with my vision getting increasingly blurry. My headaches aren't as frequent as they were_but I have to get off this med.,,F,42,5  months100mg,12/22/2014,Topamax
125, 4, Migraines Tension headaches Cluster,The first night I took this I had tingling in my lips and since then the tingling_ which has been mild_ is diffuse and likes to roam. Last night it was all over but originated from my hips and butt! It was weird but not painful or particularly distracting. I have fibromyalgia & CFS_ so I have headaches daily and my migraine triggers have increased_ so I started this med because I really needed relief from the constant pain in my head_ it was a quality of life thing. I have had word recall issues but I already get that with the fibro fog so it's not unfamiliar and I've learned how to deal. Ive lost about 5lbs and food does not appeal to me. I already had a lot of fatigue and haven't noticed an increase. I am sleeping better_ which is really awesome.,I am feeling more level emotionally but when I get overwhelmed (which I attribute to the fibro_ it's a CNS thing) I'm quicker to snap. I haven't noticed any lack of sexual desire_ thank god_ so many of the meds I've tried made me dead inside and that's a deal breaker. A little tingling and numbness is no biggie considering the chronic pain I'm already in_ I did get a moment of pins and needles_ but I was sitting funny and I repositioned and it eventually went away. The weight loss is an added perk since I gained 25lbs back in 2011 on lyrica and haven't been able to lose it_ like it totally killed my metabolism. I haven't had any weird thoughts like I did with the lyrica or cymbalta_ which both caused psychotic breaks and suicidial ideation. I've had one migraine on the day I got my menses and it wasn't as bad as it could've been and I've had one tension headache since beginning this med & I took the fioricet to calm it down. I am considering trirating up to 50mg daily to see if I can't get rid of the hormonal migraines altogether_ but I don't want to mess up a good thing. So many people seem to have such bad reactions on this med and for once_ I'm not one of them! I will update in a few months_ but right now I am very happy with this med and how it's helping me function a little better,F,39,10  days25mg,12/15/2014Email,Topamax
126, 2, Occasional Complex Migraine,"Until I started taking Topamax I had been a relatively ""normal"" person except that I got several complex migraines per year (aura_ scotoma_ etc but no pain).  Neurologist put me on Topamax with promises it was a wonder drug.  Since then I've been ""foggy""_ twitchy_ anxious_ sort of dulled personality.  Some forgetfulness.  Feelings of hopelessness but no thoughts of suicide or anything like that.  No joy in anything.  Somewhat forgetful now_ but sometimes my head floods with memories that I didn't actively attempt to recall.   Noticed muscle aches which may be from tension - wife noted that I was sitting very rigidly in chair.  GP did blood tests the other day_ creatinine levels elevated since I started taking this stuff.  Hope Topamax hasn't trashed my kidneys.  Shame because I was managing my migraines well with simple aspirin and magnesium supplements.",,M,58,2  months50mg 2X D,12/14/2014Email,Topamax
127, 1, Migraine,1st week: 25 mg /day: tingling in fingers and lips.2nd week: 50 mg/day: additional major concentration issues and  fogginess in the mind,After realizing that my loss of concentration (which was greatly affecting my job) was likely due to Topamax_ I asked my doctor the best way to get off this medicine (as I read a cold stop could cause seizures).  His instructions were to up my dosage and the side effects would eventually subside.  I didn't relent and have now been off the medicine for 3 days.  My mind has returned to normal and the other side effects have subsided.  This trade -- side effects for headaches was not worth it.  The dramatic shift in my life I could see coming from the side effects did not seem to warrant the benefit of less migraines.  Side effects this severe are serious considerations to take into account before starting this medicine and I know my doctor did not have any discussion with me about the possibilities I experienced.  I didn't even achieve the desired dose of 100mg I was yet to work up to.,M,40,2  weeks50 mg 1X D,12/14/2014,Topamax

129, 2, Daily headaches/ migraines,First_ Topiramate works like gangbusters to get rid of my daily headaches. Like 95%. But.... THIS DRUG IS TOXIC! Everything you've read: severe cognitive impairment_ say goodbye to your memory_ extreme sedation_ I also have daily nausea so need additional sedating meds for that plus sea bands.,Topiramate is also used as a mood stabilizer so for me_ anyway_ there is a severe dulling of emotions - I guess it makes me not care as much that I can barely hold a conversation_ or remember what I did yesterday. Thank god I haven't been fired yet as I've explained the situation to my supervisor. But it's dumb and dumber all day then drag myself home_ plop on the couch_ exhausted from the drug. Life not too much improved!I've also taken generic Pamelor which didn't do much for my headaches but I had some minor psych issues such as suicidal ideation_ anxiety_ and depression.I'm ready for headache drug #3,F,48,3  months,12/11/2014,Topamax

But I would routinely lose vision in my left eye (scary!)_ and lost about 1/3 of my hair. I also ended up with kidney stones for the first time in my life.

Food is repulsive to me and sweets are overwhelmingly all I seem to want. But my head aches have seemed to be diminishing as my anxiety is rising. I get tremors like my handshake more now then they ever have which is just a side effect of my neurological disorder and I've been through many meds so I really don't know what the answer is.,6 years ago I had a VNS implanted for seizures and tried to do homeopathic remedies to get off the poisons of anti epileptic poisons but that is no longer working and my seizures and head aches are back and here I sit back on meds in this twisted guinie pig game with my neurologist at my expense feeling crummier with no answers. You have to out way the good and bad they say. No seizures and headaches they say. But lots of other side effects they don't say.

132, 4, Borderline Personality Disorder,Loss of all destructive impulsive desires (good)_ loss of suicidal thoughts (good)_ severe loss of appetite and weight (depends on how you look at it)_ pop tastes flat and poisonous (bad)_ worsens depression and weeping (bad)_ (maybe) heightens anxiety_ makes finding talking_ writing and remembering the right words difficult (and I'm a professional writer)_ drains away all sense of joy (very very bad).,This works great as an off-label impulse control medication for personality disorders.  It helps me stave off alcohol cravings and keeps me from acting out by cutting_ over-spending_ or engaging in any other kinds of reckless behavior when I'm trying to soothe anxiety.  However_ it also completely knocks out all feelings of joy altogether_ which worsens depression.  I'm looking for something to couple this with_ or else I might have to ditch it altogether.,F,28,2  weeks100mg 1X D,11/17/2014Email,Topamax

I feel like I am back to about 85% of my pre-Topamax intelligence. I am more than effective at that level. The positives outweigh the negatives. I have not binged and purged one time since I have been on this medication. I suspect it must act on the addiction response center in the brain because my pesky other bad habits have lessened in my time on this med (nail biting_ over shopping_ over dating_ etc.) The weight loss leveled off as well and I stabilized at a healthy weight. Overall I am satisfied.,F,34,1  years200mg,11/15/2014,Topamax

136, 3, Migraines,Weight loss_ hair loss!!,This medicine worked great for me as a preventative for my migraines. I lost a little weight which was nice also. However_ my hair started falling out and breaking off rapidly after about 6 months of taking it. It didnt occur to me that it was because of topamax until I googled side effects. I lost about 1/3 of my hair and it continued to fall out after I stopped taking it. It wasnt worth it!,F,25,1  years,11/10/2014,Topamax
137, 3, Migraines,Before the medication I was getting migraines daily. I would be in my room with the blinds drawn_ lights off_ laying down in front of the fan_ puking with ice on my head with no relief even with my primary care doctors medication. Once I started the medication and the dose got up to 100mg I noticed relief. However the side affects I noticed as well such as the carbonated drinks-- which was fine_ I don't care to give that up but the other side affects I did not even know were possible. I would overheat in shorts in a tee-shirt with ice on my neck in 68 degrees inside a house. I have had eye damage since I started this medication and I am a type 1 Diabetic-- that is a huge problem for me and this is a very common (1 out of every 500) issue with this medication. The weight loss didn't bother me at first. In the first 8 weeks I lost pounds and I thought I had stopped losing weight but I weighed myself again today_ and I have lost another 5 pounds-- I find this really alarming_ I can't cont,Be careful. I realized after taking it and not sleeping for over a month (my doctor told me to take it at night_ the idiot) take it in the morning if you want to sleep at night!,F,23,3  months100MG 1X D,11/7/2014,Topamax

I went from 5+ migraines a week to an average on 2 or less a month. It is amazing! Most bothersome side effect the first go round was I lost 50+ pounds in about 6 months which really killed my energy. I just wasn't eating enough. The appetite was a problem. After about 3 months of being off the meds my migraines were back up to 5+ a week so I began taking it again about 2 months ago. I have not been losing weight this time.

144, 1, migraines,people have covered this pretty well.  The most bothersome this was the memory and just feeling a little dumber overall.,Be extremely careful with this drug.  I had been on it for several years.  One day I was driving and lost consciousness.  I don't know if it was some kind of seizure or what but I have no memory of what happened.  I was on no other drugs and had no history of anything like this.  Anyways long story short_ I woke up in the hospital.  I was was pretty beat up with broken bones and such_ but turns out I had caused an accident that caused someone to become severely hurt.  They took me to court and I'm basically financially ruined.  This drug is serious stuff and I blame it completely for my accident.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU DRIVE ON THIS POISON,M,30,3  years150 2X D,9/5/2014,Topamax
145, 1, Migraines,"Started at 25mg at night. First night ringing in the ears started with a horrible migraine. Second night couldn't sleep and I already suffer from chronic insomnia. Driving home from work I almost hit a car because I was zoned out. My hands are freezing_ I feel feverish_ and my head is pounding....after only 2 doses. Tried to drink a Coke tonight_ dumped it out. Worst thing I ever drank. I've lost 3 pounds in 2 days. Food is just ""blah."" Scared to take tonights dose. Don't know what to do.",,F,43,2  days25mg,9/5/2014,Topamax

If anything_ the only thing I ever want to eat is gobs of sugar and sugary foods! Meat is less appealing. My mood swings have leveled out and my depression has lifted - I feel like my eyes have been opened! Its been wonderful!,I was scared of the side effects. But I very slowly worked my way from 16 mg to 25 to 37.5mg to 50. I don't have any issues with memory or brain fog_ or feeling dopey - and trust me: I run a business with over 700 clients_ so I need to be clear minded at all times. I take this in conjunction with 300 mg of Wellbutrin every day and its been the missing link.

I feel like all my creativity inside is no longer locked up. I can do something with it now_ and that makes me so happy.My eating disorder and all the other things I needed to control my mood is now slowly leaving me. I do not need it anymore. After 1 pill I never purged Again. I felt stable_ and no longer scared for switches.

149, 4, pseudotumor cerebri,I would like to start by saying this medication definitely helped the migraines associated with my condistion. However_ I've had a lot of side effects. Most of my side effects are when increasing my dose. I have a lot of numbness in my hands and feet. Mostly my fingertips_ sometimes to the point that I can't even feel them. I get very nauseous and sometimes can't even look at or smell food. The only thing that helps is orange juice. I have horrible insomnia and sometimes don't sleep for days. I also feel very foggy and have mood swings but that's mostly just around dose changes. My dreams have become very intense and I sometimes have hallucinations at night to the point where I'm unsure if I'm awake or asleep. I know this sounds like a lot but for me it has been worth it because of the excruciating pain I was in. Be sure to consider side effects before you start and weigh out the benefits. ,,F,19,5  months100MG,8/2/2014,Topamax

I could barely talk to call 911 because my tongue was numb. I had to get an injection of Benadryl in order to stop the reaction. I have now been on Benadryl for 4 days and I still feel awful.

That was also a mistake_ because I felt every side effect more profoundly_ and most of them were psychiatric. I was so irritated that I was almost homicidal. I was screaming and thought about committing myself. Seriously_ too. I only added this med because I thought I'd lose some Weight induced by another med _ and believed another mood stabilizer at a low dose couldn't hurt. Wrong.

165, 1, Petit mals_ migraine_ pseudotumor,I began taking Topamax at a low dosage and titrated up to 800mg/day over the course of 2 months.  Initially I felt it had some good side effects . . . like evening out my moods_ but as I went up in doses_ I went through ranges of side effects.  At 200mg I felt really REALLY dumb.  As I went up and out of 400mg and into the stratosphere with 800mg_ started to feel fairly normal_ as though my wits had returned.  Then the fog rolled in_ heavier and darker than ever before.  It was forgetting what I was saying in mid-sentence_ being unable to basic arithmetic_ exacerbated ADD/ADHD_ generally disoriented and unable to follow most conversations. . .  For several months I was in this state_ barely keeping my head above water_ and then things began to get really really dark and it scared the crap out of me.

166, 3, Migraines,This did initially help my migraines_ but even on high dose they slowly returned. Topamax gave me extreme fatigue_ cloudy thinking- especially word retrieval_ hair loss_ weight loss - which was a +_ my main concern was it flattened out my mood to a dull blah nothing. I couldn't  seem to get off couch for much- not depressed just no feeling. I took it for a long time and the fatigue and flattening took time- I just quit it after reading more about the drug. Extremely serious side effects from this are possible / no dr not neurologist or internist told me to watch for vision changes- it can cause blindness. I was on high dose_ too. Migraines are miserable! I will find another med w/ less serious side effects. I have taken many meds - have chronic illness- but this one scares me a bit. it made me crave sugar like crazy!_ too. I am not sure why? Maybe the crushing fatigue? Almost as soon as I stopped I started eating normally again. I got rebound headaches_ but they are tapering off. I tapered off this med too over about 2. 5 wks to quit and my legs went numb from the knee down a few times coming off it and I felt cruddy_ but it wasn't hard to get off compared to other meds.,,F,49,3  years200 mg,1/10/2014,Topamax

I became ridiculously paranoid_ irritable and then my hair was falling out in clumps.  My weight was rapidly dropping.  8 months later_ I had to go off of it.

193, 4, Seizure/headache,It started off as tingling in my fingers and slight numbness. I can handle that. It gets really bad when I get cold. I've always had that due to low blood pressure so it's not that different. If I have ANY caffeine my lips twitch_ eyelids twitch and my cheeks_ neck_ and jaw tingle like nobodies business. Right now I'm trying to type this message out while watching my fingers spasm. It's weird that it only happens during the middle of the day after work_ it seems (the finger spasms). I can make it stop by fully flexing my fingers or fully clenching them into a fist. I have lost my appetite somewhat but I've never really had a super strong one. I've lost my sex drive completely but that might be due to the topamax and other things_ however it is unusual. Not that big of a deal as I'm single at the moment. I do_ however_ seem to get irritated at little things a lot easier and I can't remember things like I used to.

The SUNCT has been in abeyance for 18 months since being treated with  Lamotrigine but this drug left me with daily headache migraines for which my doc prescribed topiramate.  Within 2 days of starting upload period of 25mg at night_ the SUNCT was back with full blown symptoms - tearing eye_ swollen eyelid_ streaming nose_ stabbing pains in sinus_ all on right side of the face this time. I thought it was just incredibly bad luck till I read of one other person experiencing the same thing on this website. Thank goodness I did.

206, 2, migraine/potential epilepsy,Suicidal ideation_ rage_ almost broke my hand_ numbness_ brain fog beyond frustrating_ weight loss_ abusive behaviors otherwise not present. ---The reason some people get this rage is a sulfa allergy.  If you have a sulfa allergy_ dont take this medicine! especially if you have prior mental health issues of any sort.  This medicine made me a real evil person every uppage and no telling how coming off it will go.  I have ptsd and 100% disability for it_ a sulfa allergy_ and get put on a med that causes those with sulfa allergies to rage.  The brilliance is uncanny.  I have come to terms that this med might help some people but if you have a known sulfa allergy you will at best turn into a zombie and at worst ive read people have lost friends trying to come off this pill.  Im going to a hospital to be admitted and will raise hell to be sure that i get taken care of.  I cant titrate off at home.  My poor fiance and cats have been through more than enough! padded room for me.  :/ This med is hell.  Buyer beware.  I almost broke my hand on the wall too.

207, 3, migraine,hallucinations_ weight loss_ strange thoughts,When I was given this prescription I wasn't told to titrate up to the 100 mg per day so i started taking 100 mg right away. I started having hallucinations where i was being followed around by a small elephant and I saw and talked with my dead mother. I also lost 70 pounds in 3 months. When I told my Dr. that I was standing at my kitchen sink doing dishes and I looked up and saw myself standing there in front of me_looking back at me his advise to me was that I should call mental health and he wrote down a number for me to call. My doctor never connected the Topamax with the symptoms I was having. I tapered off the drug and continued losing weight eating 4000 calories daily for 5 more months until the weight loss stopped. This drug can either be a miracle drug or a death drug and it all depends on the chemistry of the human that ingests it. The medical community should be better informed about its crap shoot varying effects it has on those that use it and to NOT START AT A LARGE DOSE RIGHT AWAY.,M,50,3  months100 1X D,12/30/2012Email,Topamax

I did and said whatever I wanted with no sense of discretion_ and good judgement. It was as if it turned off part of my brain that stops the pain_ but right next to it is the part that gives me a filter & discretion.  I hit my kids! Ran faster than my dog!

I would never get upset or aggressive at anything.  -  Increased lbido- Decreased headaches (I don't have migraines but I do have daily headaches and this got rid of them and enables much more sleep).  The BAD: To be honest_ only the appetite loss really bothered me.  On 50mg_ it was a bit too much for me and I found I was actually finding it harder to sleep.   However_ once I got down to 25 that was the sweet spot.  But_ since im a guy _ the appetite loss wasn't wanted as I was starting to lose weight and thus finally weaned off.,M,,15  days25 1X D,11/20/2012Email,Topamax
210, 3, Migraines,I have been on Topamax for about 10 weeks now. Doctor just doubled dose from 100mg to 200mg 2 weeks ago. Side effects intensified then. Confusion_ Lack of concentration_can't find words_ constant ringing in ears_ can't think clearly_ nervous_ irritable_ no appetite whatsoever (entire time though)_ aversion to any carbonated beverages_ struggling in school_ tingling in hands_ feet_ face_ pressure in ears_ temples_ headaches_ feel like constant noise in head. Overall weird feeling. This past weekend_ my eyes started bothering me. It's hard to explain_ just general discomfort. I'm seeing my eye doctor tomorrow to make sure my eyes have not been damaged because this medicine can cause glaucoma and blindness. I am starting to taper off medication tonight. I have lost 23 pounds since starting in September but it's muscle loss not fat so that not beneficial.,Doctors sugar coat this side effects. My doctor only told me about the word find problem. He wasn't concerned at all when I told him my eyes were bothering me. I have only had 1 migraine since on the medication and my daily headaches have diminished quite a bit.

211, 4, IIH,I was prescribed Topamax because My stomach couldn't handle Diamox for IIH. For those of you reading this & unaware what this is (I wouldn't be aware if I didn't have it) that is a neuro condition in which my body overproduces spinal (csf) fluid and puts extra pressure on my brain causing a whole host of problems...the biggest is debilitating migraines. So_ my neuro put me on Topamax and worked me up to my dose. I will admit_ I did have a bit of trouble with some numbness & tingling while first adjusting to the medication_ but this has since diminished. Secondly_ I still have trouble with overheating a bit with exercise. However_ those seem like such small things to overcome to me when I consider how much relief I've gotten & all that I've been able to get back since starting the med.,,F,24,6  months200,11/7/2012,Topamax

213, 1, mood stabilizer,broken bones wouldn't heal; fingernails became paper soft; chronic anxiety; metallic taste in mouth; diet soft drinks tasted horrible; fluctuated between hyper-vigilance_ dissociation_ and mental fog -- very hard to feel grounded; worse effects were when gradually backing off dose (under medical supervision) -- almost unbearable anxiety and agitation; impaired judgment.  Friend also backing off same dose experienced anxiety_ paranoia_ then committed suicide.,I would not recommend Topamax to anyone before ruling out predisposition to anxiety or mood disorder of any kind.  The drug is insidious.  It can alter the sense of self_ and of reality.  I honestly have no idea who I was during the years I took this medication.  Now that I'm free of this or any other drug_ I realize most of the anxiety I experienced was probably caused by the drug itself.  I feel better than ever.  I strongly recommend trying meditation_ environmental adjustments_ avoiding stressors_ etc. -- anything natural before resorting to a mood-altering medication.  Although I started feeling like myself within months of stopping this drug_ it's taken 4 years for my fingernails to become strong once again_ and I'm still dealing with orthopedic frailties.,F,60,5  years800 mg 2X D,10/29/2012,Topamax

On the 3rd day_ I started feeling very strange and my mouth was becoming very dry and irritated. I then started hallucinating. The next two days were insane. The hallucinations became very vivid but I knew they weren't real. I would get stuck in a 'trip' for hours. I was hyperactive_ forgetting what I was saying and what I was thinking. I tried telling my mom what I was seeing and feeling_ and she came and stayed with me. I went to the ER and told them what had been happening. They drug tested me_ saw I wasn't on drugs and handed me a pamphlet on schizophrenia as they discharged me. After some research_ we found others who had experienced these same 'serious' side effects from Topamax. I stopped taking it and after the medicine was out of my system_ I started feeling better. The whole experience was terrifying. The worst part was that people thought I was crazy and didn't even consider it was from the Topamax. I had specified that the only change in the past week was starting the medicine_ and yet they refused to consider it as an option. Please reconsider starting Topamax and pursue an alternative if possible. I wouldn't want anyone to experience what I did.

If this medicine is helping you but the side effects are rough_ here is some help.  For things such as memory loss and speech issues_ you have to drink plenty of water and take vitamins...that helps a lot. Things like tingling go away after a while.  If taken at night it relaxes you and helps you sleep for those with insomnia issues; and don't be afraid to ask for something to help you sleep as this can be an issues with age because the body producing less selenium.The one side effect that you are not always warned about that feels really debilitating is the hair loss and the bowel blocking constipation.  For the hair loss especially for women in menopause take niacin..add it to your vitamin regiment regularly. It will help with thinning_ hair loss is certain spots and breakage.  For the constipation which can stop normal life activity as you currently know it_ you have to take two things if it is severe for you...regular laxatives do not help..you need something stronger.  Here's what I found that works for me...Reneu from FirstFitness.  Go to anewu2stay.firstfitness.com. Then go to shop now-herbal cleansing and you will see where you can order Reneu. This is the only thing that helped me and I also take a generic (equate brand) stool softener as well.

240, 1, Chronic Headaches,Weight loss_ change in taste_ blurred vision_ acne_ difficulty finding the right words_ depression,I was prescribed this medicine for chronic headaches.  At first_ it worked great!  After a few weeks_ though_ I experienced weight loss_ blurred vision_ changes in taste_ acne_ and difficulty finding the right words.  Those side effects weren't that bad......until I started to feel like I was withering away.  I was literally grossed out by how I looked and felt.  At my lowest_ I weighed 92 pounds.  (I'm only 5 feet tall_ but I looked almost anorexic).  I had horrible face and upper back acne.  It made me really depressed after awhile.  I had to quit taking it_ because I was afraid I WOULD die if I kept taking it.  Emotionally_ I felt horrid.  I never wanted to eat_ because everything tasted disgusting!  I couldn't drink anything with carbonation_ because I would get a bizarre fizzy taste in my mouth.  I would see flashes of light at odd times and I felt really out of it all the time.  And the difficulty finding the words I wanted to use was ridiculous!!  I would drive myself nuts because I couldn't even put a sentence together!  I just felt stupid.  Ultimately_ it was a terrible medication for me and I've been off Topamax for awhile now.  I still suffer from headaches_ but at least I don't feel like I'm withering into nothing.  I wouldn't recommend this medication.,F,31,7  months50 MG 1X D,6/18/2012,Topamax

244, 1, Chronic pelvic pain,"Topamax was extremely effective in dealing with my pelvic pain_ however_ the side effects were so debilitating that I had no choice but to go on long term disability. It started slowly with speech problems_ memory loss and slow motor skills as well as unable to finish tasks. Finally it affected my concentrations level so significantly to the point where I could not work anymore. I worked so hard to get this point in terms of education (B.S in chemical engineering and M.S in organic chemistry) as well as my career as medicinal chemist for last 15 years will be wasting away.  Not only that_ my family life has been changed completely for last few years. I lost all my interests_ including many of my kids' activities. I can't tell you how awful I feel everyday. I know many people are thinking this would not happen to you. I don't even know how many people are awear of FDA warning about increased risk of birth defect by Topamax.

However_ I was mostly interested in in for the wight loss side effect.  That being said_ I am not overweight... and most people would think it was absurd for me to be taking it for that reason. I'm 5'7"" 140 lbs. So far_ no weight loss.  Needless to say I am disappointed_ but I haven't reached my therapeutic dose so there may still be hope. Anyway... I am also taking it because I am possibly showing symptoms of bipolar disorder.  None of the side effects have been bad at all really. The most noticeable is the pins/needles in my feet.

After 14 years of not having any help from all the different pills I tried Topamax finally lifted my depression and took away my gnawing alcohol cravings.  I have more energy_ I wake up with a song in my heart.  I feel normal.  To anyone reading this that has an alcohol problem I recommend http://www.mywayout.org where they explain how you can ask your doctor to RX Topamax to help you wean off alcohol.  Also if you are like me and you are soft spectrum bipolar/treatment resistant depressive (not sure which one it is) and nothing else work_ please don't let the other people's side effects scare you off Topamax.

I have never had any weight loss with it_ which I have seen in others_ but I also have a thyroid problem. Overall_ Topamax has helped change my life in a positive manner. I do have a prolonged QT interval on EKG_ which I did not have prior_ but I am on so much medication_ it would be difficult to pin down which one is actually causing it. I rated Topamax a 4 because it is short acting_ as if I miss a dose_ I will already get a headache.,F,40,4  years100 MG 1X D,4/24/2012Email,Topamax

Forced to quit job_ & spent days in bed_ unable to move. Due to ↑ insomnia_ given Temazepan (30 mgs). By 2011_ sleep ↓_ & presc Trazodone to add to Tmzpn_ 150 mgs/night. Soon ↓ to 50 mgs/night. Now taking 25 mgs/night. As docs seemed uncurious_ began researching causes. Found this site & read of others in same boat. Found good psychotherapeutic help. End of 2011_ I decided had to get off Top. Began ↓ by 25 mgs/2-3 wks using pill-cutter. Temp ↑ Dex by 15 mgs. Took last Top Apr 16 2012 & stopped extra Dex. Big difference! Energy still low but most days. No longer feel drugged_ able to leave apt for short distances & Im more lively. Hope hair regrows. Still stomach problems [not as bad_ hoping will resolve.

253, 2, Borderline Personality Disorder,"Extreme weight loss (went from 180lbs to 105lbs and I am 5'8""))_ mood swings_ suicidal thoughts_ crying spells_ extreme rage_ restless feeling inside",My incompetent ex-psychiatrist prescribed me Topomax after I gained quite a bit of weight on Trileptal. He failed to warn me or my family that there is a risk of adverse effects in this and all psychiatric medication. I have BPD and always had horrible mood swings/rage/anxiety_ but instead of helping with any of my symptoms_ the Topomax worsened them. I would wake up sobbing for no reason_ would start thinking suicide was a logical option_ severe anxiety that I attempted to quell with drinking and INSANE weight loss. You just can't eat. I apparently was high risk for an eating disorder and the Topomax triggered Anorexia that I have been battling for years. Instead of switching the meds_ my psych assumed the side effects of the drug were symptoms of my mental illness and upped my dosage which in turn made things worse and he would up them more. I finally figured it out after doing some reading and stopped it all together. Of course I still have BPD symptoms (depression_ anxiety_ fear of abandonment_ etc.)_ but what the psych had assumed were symptoms of the BPD all went away with the Topomax. I've since dealt with my BPD in therapy and refuse medication and am a perfectly healthy_ functioning adult. Topomax may help some but it also may cause the opposite effect! If you show any early signs of an eating disorder or already suffer from one: STAY AWAY. This shit made me think I was legitimately insane for four years!,F,23,4  years300 2X D,4/13/2012,Topamax

It has taken me years to realize that my symptoms of; irritability_ frequent chest pain_ abdominal pain_ mood swings_ depression_ suicidle thoughts_ confusion_ slow thinking_ insomnia_ urinary discharge are ALL a result of this medication.

I started to lose weight after being on 25 mg twice a day for two months_ and then it was only about a pound or two a month. My previous medicine made me gain 15+ pounds in 6 months. I started at 115 lbs/ 5'3""_ so that is a lot of weight to gain. I have not changed my diet_ (vegetarian)_ full of whole foods_ and no junk food. What I have found is that the more Topamax I take and the longer I am on it_ the sooner I feel satiety or fullness. I am almost back to my normal weight. As far as being tired_ I have fibromyalgia_ so I am tired all the time anyway. But what I have found is that when I increased the dosage of Topamax_ my fatigue would worsen for about 2-3 weeks_ then subside. It was worse in the beginning at the lower doses. Going from 25 mg a day to 25 mg twice a day was harder than going to 25 mg in the am and 50 in the pm_ and then the easiest was 50 am/50 pm. At the that point_ I think I was only extremely fatigued for about a week. I wouldn't say I am slow to react (as in if I drop a cup or in driving)_ I would say one of my worst problems is word loss_ dyslexia (which I never had) and the inability to write down phone numbers or spell things as people are dictating them.

For a period during my twenties after seeing a nurologist and going on a medication (not sure what it was) they pretty much went away or were managable.  After having my second child almost 5 years ago_ it's been a down hill battle.  Progressing to the point where my headaches were beyond daily_ they never truly left_ they would take a break for a couple of hours. The severity of the headach would change from worse to uncontrollable.  And due to my life_ i couldn't crawl into bed. I had to be here and available for my kids because my husbad is away alot.  So i was not always the nicest Mommy. Since starting Topamax on Dec. 22 2011_ i've had 2 shadow headaches and 2 actual headaches which were easily taken care of with Advil and a nap.  I have my life back_ I have my personality back_ and so does my family.  You could tell my I was going to die in 15 years from taking this medication_ and I would still take it.

After trying the nightmare that was Lyrica_ I reluctantly went on Topamax because my migraines had gotten so bad and so frequent. I hadn't initially wanted to try it because I was afraid of what I had read about the side effects. However_ they turned out to be quite mild and temporary and not bad enough to make me stop taking it. My headaches have been greatly reduced in number from several times a month to about 2 - 3 in a three month period_ much more manageable. Also_ much to my surprise_ my fibromyalgia pain and stiffness has almost completely disappeared (I would actually take it just for the fibromyalgia even if it didn't help my migraines).

Long term side effects are numbness in hands and feet_ tired all the time_mood swings_ even had to get on depression meds_ loss of memory gets worse_ but all the weird food tastes go away and weight stays maintained.The plus side of it all is the migraines have almost went away completely andi do have headaches weekly. I have been so depressed and have had zero sex drive...to which has lead me to take myself off this drug. I have been hearing how many divorces this has caused by this drugs side effects.

279, 4, migraines,Don't really have any side effects to speak of. Make sure to drink LOTS of water when taking this drug.  Been on it for years_ and just this year had kidney stone.  Related?Maybe. Was also told I wasn't hydrating enough. Probably a bit of both.,Take this to prevent migraines which I would get roughly 6+ times a month. Still get them_ but down to two or so. Taken with Relpax when migraine hits  - Concerns I have NOW with Topamax is that there can be bone loss. With my age and with amt of years I have been on this drug... is this a concern?

281, 5, Severe Migraine,Drowsiness after taking dose.Problems finding the right word (word searching).Mood swings.Some pains in legs.Jerking in legs and arms starting about an hour after dose.Shaking in hands (tremors).Confusion_ forget what I was about to say.Weight loss.These sound like bad side effects and many of them_ but since starting this medication I have not had a migraine. The side effects I have got used to_ the migraine's I could never get used to. I owe a lot to this medication and the side effects to me are a small price to pay for getting my life back. I take my dose before bed so the jerking doesn't effect me much as by the time I wake up its settled_ the drowsiness is good because I take it before I sleep_ the pain in my legs in not constant_ on and off and not severe at all_ the tremors usually start a few hours before I'm due to take my dose so I think it could be my bodys alarm clock letting me know I'm due to take it. Word searching can be a little annoying but bearable_ forgetting what I was going to say_ happens to everyone anyway!! Just a little more with this medication_ and the weight loss_ I'm still at a healthy weight for my height with a BMI of 20. If you can try stick with it_ this medication could change your life for the better.

282, 5, Tonic-clonic Seizures,Tingling in feet_ hands_ face -- sometimes painful; cognitive impairment for the first few weeks; bad memory loss -- especially with names_ etc.; mentally slower in general; the good stuff -- weight loss!!! 25 lbs. so far w/ no change in diet.,Despite the side effect profile of topamax_ this drug works wonders for me in terms of completely stopping my grand mal seizures at 400 mg a day. So I'll take being a little slower mentally and seizure-free. At least Topamax doesn't make me really tired like the other drugs or make me hungry and fat. Moreover_ I've lost weight without changing my eating habits or appetite_ which rocks! It's a hard med to get used to in terms of side effects_ but once your body adjusts to it_ after about 1.5 months_ then its smoother sailing.,M,30,4  months200 MG 2X D,1/2/2012Email,Topamax

I felt like I had cottonballs stuffed in my cheeks.,I have had migraine with aura for over 20 years.  I get all of the neurological fun with them as well which include visual auras_ increased hearing sensitivity_ partial paralysis_ inability to speak or comprehend_ and many others.  On 2/14/10 I had a migraine which led to a grand mal seizure.  The neurologist really advocated this topamax and following the seizure I was still a bit confused_ thinking the medication was necessary.  I took it for a year and a half then I was done.  Once intelligent_ I was no longer able to form words_ couldn't remember why I was in a room only a few seconds after going in to get something.  Once after putting the pill in my mouth and taking a drink of water to swallow it down_ I instantly spit it into my hand_ thinking my tooth fell out. (I forgot I had just put the pill in my mouth).  As a social worker who must prepare court summaries to submit to judges_ and whose job it is to ensure the safety of children....I could no longer take the side effects of this medication.  I tried both topamax and topiramate.  My migraines did lessen_ but the auras changed to the point where it was difficult to determine the onset of the migraines because I had the same auras for over 20 years.  Now that I have been off of it for about 6 months (took myself off of it)_ I have serious mood swings.  These started after taking it_ but never left.  They have gotten worse.

287, 4, Migranies,I love Topamax and have been on it for over 3 years. I started out at 25 mg once a day and my DR stepped me up slower than most people because I am a smaller person. I'm 4'10 and weighted 120. I lost almost 20 lbs on it and went on the depo shot which is birth control to gain weight. At first and any time my dose was upped I couldn't drink pop I later found out I can drink it as long as its caffeine free and there is no weird taste. I couldn't eat butter_ or sweets but the only thing I could eat was meat. Right I went off my meds for almost two months because they thought I was pregnant turns out I'm not so I'm starting back on them at the 150 mg. I am having problems with getting dizzy_ forgetting_ and now when I try to eat I can only eat a little at a time and I feel like I'm going to puke after I eat. That has never happened before.,As for the numbness or anything like that my hands and feet stopped after maybe 6 months on it_ however my face and nose tingle and feel numb. All of the weird food things stopped within about a week every time my dose was changed and this time after going back on it I've not noticed it_ only it making me sick to my stomach. But I went from having headaches that would last days or having 2 or 3 headaches a week and ending up the hospital to only having 3 to 4 a month.

Topamax increases uric acid in the body. In a word_ it was a #^@%#% awful experience. I started Topamax for migraines and it works wonderfully for that purpose. My body just says no.

I started getting migraines at age 47 (Dad had them) and had 5 - 6 per month. Each migraine lasted a day and was awful. I travelled a lot for work and had to miss flights_ stay in hotels. Once I was on my own at home with my younger child and couldn't even manage to get to the phone to say I couldn't bring him into school. I haven't had a full blown migraine since I started taking Topamax. I still get quite a few headaches including what I consider would otherwise have been migraines_ but which are now dampened to a very manageable level now. I just take Rx strength ibuprofen and I'm pretty much OK.

After taking it for approx 3 years_ I had NO thought process_ could not speak at all_ lift my left leg AT ALL. I could only walk with a shuffle. My headache dr said to go to the hospital and I never heard from him since. (LOL) They did EEG which was abnormal and an ammonia test which was out of this world-all because of Tapamax. I then had a seizure as they were weaning me off (a week in the hospital). I still have problems with left side tingling and thought process.

I used to take Tegretol for years_ but that started changing its effect. Then my doctor switched me to Topomax. I have the tingling and numbness_ and have some slurring of speech_ but it's not noticeable_ really_ just sounds like average person messing up. I do have trouble remembering things_ which sucks because I feel dumber than I know I am. I lost weight_ but was also trying to-- about 30 pounds_ whereas with Lamictal (I took that for awhile and hated it) I gained the 30 and couldn't get rid of it no matter what. Topomax has completely done away with my anxiety_ panic attacks_ auras_ EVERYTHING. My period has become irregular lately; I'm 41 and I am wondering if I'm perimenopausal or if it has anything to do with the Topomax.

I would be able to sit and watch tv_ and not hafta get up or move around.  So it decresed restlessness.  In other ways_ even though it seemed very good_ it seemed too good to be true at times.

305, 4, migraines,Initially I experienced tingling feeling in fingers and toes occasionally but this subsided after a month or so.  It did cause me to feel tired and a little fatigued_ not wanting to get out of bed when the alarm went off.  Long term side effects were memory loss and a kidney stone.,Despite the side effects (even the kidney stone that I had to have laser surgery to have removed) Topomax has helped greatly with my migraines. It reduced the frequency from 12 a month to 2 or 3 and it reduced the severity.  I no longer get them so bad that I can't stop vomiting and end up in the E.R.  In fact_ the relpax pills now work to get rid of my migraines 95% of the time. I realized after the kidney stone and seeing a urologist that I need to drink 2 to 3 liters of water per day to prevent kidney stones while on topamax.  Since I have been doing this I have not had stones and I feel great.  The topamax also makes my memory not so sharp_ I tend to forget names when I meet people an my short term memory is horrible while taking it.

We were both having constant migraines inherited from our mom (who is also on topamax)i could not handle the tingly feeling!! (I also have panic attacks to the nth degree and when ones coming on my hands and feet get tingly.... So the side effect made me think I was having a panic attack no good) but as long as I took it the migraines stopped and the tingly would subside after a couple of weeks of taking it. The metallic taste was awful. Can't complain about the weight loss as I dropped 30-40 lbs while on the drug. And yeah I needed to lose exactly that to be at a good weight (yay!) after 6months of taking it though the tingly came back with a vengeance and that was the end of that! My sister stopped taking it about a year later as she realized her migraines were stress related and now that she's understands this does not have migraines.

321, 3, Severe Tension Headaches,I didn't have severe side effects like some people said they did_ and that could be because I was on a low dosage. At first I experienced being a little light headed_ dizzy_ tired_ and REALLY REALLY thirsty. Soda_ slurpees_ energy drinks_ and even beer tasted really strange. They tasted flat and SPICY_ like they were burning my tongue. After a 2 days I started experiencing really bad joint pain in my knees_ elbows_ hips_ and shoulders. Then I started having trouble concentrating and was unable to read a sentence without having to look it over a few more times to understand. I had a little loss of memory. All these side effects were not severe. I mostly stopped taking Topamax because of the really bad joint pain (my knees were really sore & I couldn't even crouch down or ride a bike). I also became concerned with the lack of concentration because I'm a full time college student that works_ I didn't want to be a zombie.,I feel really bummed that I didn't give Topamax a chance to take effect. It could have possibly prevented my headaches_ but the joint pain & lack of concentration was stressing me out. I might give it a chance again some day.

I took this medication for migraines and at first liked that while on it I lost weight and my anxieties went away. It did not_ however_ reduce my migraine frequency or intensity which is the reason I was on it in the first place. After a few months on it_ I started to notice that I couldn't remember the right words and would frequently say the wrong word or say words in the wrong order. I also felt as though I was in a fog or a stupor most of the time. I would be in the middle of a sentence and completely forget what I was saying or what the conversation was even about! I also started to have recall problems in general. I lost so many memories due to this drug! I finally weaned myself off this drug about three years ago. I started working on improving my memory and language skills and have gotten a little better_ but I STILL suffer from the effects of this drug. I still have memory_ recall and word problems_ and I still have migraines! This drug is very SCARY and it has ruined the quality of my life.

I have tried just about everything to heal myself from traditional to alternative medicine without success. I was reluctant to use Topamax because of its side effects and also its cost_ but now that it is generic I can afford it.So far_ it has not been helpful.  I have had to gradually increase my dosage by 25 mg per 4-6 weeks or so because of the side effects. Although I must say_ I have a very close friend who also had daily migraines after contracting viral meningitis and she was on 400 mg/day a day and had no side effects and no migraines for years. She stopped taking it thinking she didn't need it any longer. Her migraines came back_ and she had a small stroke because of them.

328, 1, migraine approx 3x or more a month,Constant tingling in legs_ feet_ arms_ and hands. Lost any appetite_ nothing tastes good anymore. The side effect of weight loss would have been nice_ but even though I'm hardly eating I have not lost any weight. I feel nauseous when I do eat. Having chest pains_ stomach pains_ my neck hurts. I'm seeing things that aren't there. Dizzy_ clumsy_ and forgetful. I stay tired all the time_ and no matter how much sleep I get I am sleepy throughout the day. I've probably missed some but actually the main thing about the topamax is that it has done nothing to help with the migraine. In fact since starting it I have still gotten migraines_ the only difference is now my Zomig doesn't work to ease them like it use to.,When my doctor prescribed this I listened and agreed to give it a try. I was really hoping it was going to be the answer. I've been living with migraines for 27 years! So I started taking it. After the third month I decided to look it up online and then read the paper that the pharmacy includes with it. As I'm looking these over I come to the side effects part. Going down the list I was amazed at how many I was having and didn't even realize it was because of this medicine. Needless to say I will not be continuing this medication. And to the person whose comment was to say they believe people are exaggerating the side effects. . . your ignorance is showing!

I do notice if I miss a dose_ I get tingly hands and things.. that's one disadvantage_ but certainly not enough to make me want to stop it.  If you notice any hair loss_ ask your doctor about Biotin. I started taking that and it's helped a lot. I noticed more hair breakage than anything_ but my hair is really thick. This drug is one drug that has helped me face my trauma and get through the days. I fought through the tingles and the fogginess for a few weeks and now it's great! I'd say that lasted 4-6 weeks or so_ in the end.. totall,,F,26,10  months300 mg 1X D,7/31/2011Email,Topamax

354, 5, epilesy,tingling like sever pins and needles in hands and feet and even in mouth at the beginning. weight loss. word loss. spaced out. insomnia.,i started out on a 100 and lost a stone and a half in a month the pins and needles were very odd but settles down after a few weeks i still get them quite badly in my feet_ if i sit in the wrong position_ ones i could before sometime it is almost painful. the word loss can be very frustrating mid sentence its just gone_ but that to has tailed off_still get it from time to time. the side effect i dislike the most is the weird spaced out part. think someone else describe it as the something to do with a train stopping but the world still moving_ it can feel a bit panicy at times and because of the epilepsy can make me feel i am about to have a fit which can lead to more panic. this to has tailed off and overall i am very happy so far with this drug as i have only had one seizure in 8 months and that is just brilliant.,F,29,8  months100 2X D,6/15/2011Email,Topamax

357, 2, Bipolar II,Tingling feet.  Taste dulled.  Strange food cravings.  BRAIN FOG! (and the famous topamax weight loss and appetite suppression... didn't happen for me),I was put on this drug to try to counter-act the weight gain caused by seroquel.  Overall_ my BPDII has been very well controlled while on topamax_ but that may likely be due to the seroquel and 100mg of lamictal I take_ rather than the topamax.  On topamax I've noticed tingling feet_ which is annoying_ and altered taste_ such that I am always spicing food much more than I used to do to try to make it taste less bland.  I also notice an occasional craving for carbonated beverages that I never had before.  I did not experience any weight loss or appetite suppression on this drug whatsoever.The biggest downside of topamax was the brain fog issue; I am a scientist_ and topamax made me so stupid during the day I couldn't even add two two-digit numbers properly.  I would forget the names of people I've known for years_ but haven't seen for several months.  It was awful.  I finally stopped taking the daytime dose_ and will stop taking the nighttime dose soon_ since I don't see much point in taking a drug that isn't doing anything for me but giving me horrible side effects.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it is easy to get off of_ which is a first for me as far as psych meds go!,F,44,4  months100 mg 2X D,5/19/2011Email,Topamax

(mood stabilizer) This drug may be worth the side effects if you are having excruciating migraines everyday or of course_ seizures but otherwise I'd say NO. I was weary about starting after reading reviews on here but figured I'd give it a go. I made it 4 days. Where to start? I'm already a word dropper so I figured that couldn't get much worse. WRONG. I couldn't pronounce words correctly either_ i said reird instead of weird and episodey instead of episode. Topamax actually gave me headaches and the nausea coupled with that made things pretty unbearable. My sense of smell became so strong that I'd immediately become extremely nauseous with any normal every day smell. Two days in I decide to take it at night so at least if it made me stupid I would be asleep when it happened...but I woke up and was so confused I didn't know I was in my own bedroom. I sat there for 5 minutes trying to figure out where I was. I last took Topamax 3 days ago but I know it's still in my system cause I drank a Coke this morning and it tasted like it had no carbonation_ I also had a meltdown at work and couldn't stop crying....not normal for me.",F,33,4  days20 mg 1X D,5/17/2011Email,Topamax

TOPAMAX seemed to gradually increase the pressure in my head but left me unable to clearly think and I didn't even realize that it was the cause. The headaches actually got worse and i could only function with earplugs.  I tried this med on 2 different occassions and same thing happened.,"Please consider the comments of other but based on  your own medical condition_ don't be afraid to try something that may help you.  I have a close friend who suffers migraines and TOPAMAX helps her tremendously wihtout any side effects but weight loss.  This was a very traumatic experience for me and my emotion wants to say ""don't ever take this drug""  but please_ like all medications_ it may work for some but not others.  ALWAYS_ ALWAYS TELL THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU IF YOU ARE TRYING A NEW DRUG.  If they notice any changes in your behavior the can alert you to stop.

Most troublesome: coming up with / delay in coming up with correct words in a conversation; decreased memory_ constantly having to correct spelling and fill in missed words when typing; saying the opposite of what I mean or totally jumbling what I am trying to say_ more difficulty in absorbing certain reading material. In other words: it has dumbed me down a bit. My psych warned me about this.But - it works great; it allowed me to ditch my weight-gain-causing antidepressants that had kept me so fat for so long (with the exception of one depressive setback to where I started a low dose of Wellbutrin - but it did not cause weight gain).

The doctor decided that adding wellbutrin to the mix would help the migraines as well as the anxiety. It actually spiral downwards - I dropped about 20 lbs in 3 weeks and I was sleeping 20+ hours a day. When I was awake I was like a tiger pacing in its cage. I was a wreck. I saw another doctor and insisted they take me off the wellbutrin and replace it with ... see_ forgot the name_ anyway something I'd had good results with before. I also decided to go off topamax but after a year I've decided that was a mistake. Not only does topamax help my migraines it helps my cravings for food and alcohol (only drink a martini or two a week but I've only had 1 in 3 weeks of restarting topamax_ didn't drink at all last time). I'm sorry to hear of so many bad stories with topamax_ I think it must be that our bodies process these meds differently and we each have unique problems. Totally weird.

389, 5, Migraines,Brand Name (5 1/2 years) - weight loss_ loss of appetite_ dry mouthGeneric (6 months) - anxiety_ depression_ exhaustion_ significant hair loss_ phantom smells (sulphur),When I started taking this medication years ago_ it was a miracle for me.  I was getting several migraines per week and nothing worked_ not even Dilaudid.  The pain was so bad and so often that I could not function as a normal person.  I started taking the Topamax and after about 6-8 weeks my migraines were down to about once a month and manageable with 800MG of Ibuprofen!!  I switched to the generic when it first came out not thinking twice about it.  I started to suffer with depression_ anxiety_ exhaustion_ most of my hair fell out_ shortness of breath_ brain fog and I kept smelling something similair to sulphur.  I didn't attribute it to the generic topamax for several months and went to see my Family Doctor several times and had many tests (all came back normal). It wasn't until I had a 6 month follow up with my Neurologist and he suggested that I try the brand name again for awhile and see if I feel better.  Within a week I started to feel like a whole new person_ like my old self again....and my hair eventually grew back too!,F,38,6  years50 MG 2X D,2/14/2011,Topamax

My Neurologist put me on this drug in Feb 2011 after other meds didn't work. First 7 days 25mg_ next 7 50mg_ last 7 75mg. The following day after I increaded to 50mg I felt a huge shift. Totally confused_ EXTREMELY anxious_ emotional and nervous/shakey most of the day. NO appetite at all. Absolutely afraid to stay at this dosage_ let alone increase.

For me personally_ the benefit outweighs the side effect. I have migraines often enough and severe enough that it began to affect my life and my job. It is your responsibility to educate yourself before taking medication. Read the printout the pharmacy gives you! Ask questions at your doctors office! Research online!

392, 4, migraines,slight dizziness_ tingling in hands and feet_ loss of appetite_ slight stomach problems_ trouble finding the right word_ trouble memorizing (college student)_,I usually don't have problems with medicine_ so what I'm experiencing is the worst that's ever happened to me. However_ it has helped me with my migraines. I'm functional in the afternoons (which is when I had my headaches)_ and that's a step in the right direction. I've lost a little bit of weight_ but I've also been exercising more as well_ so I'm not sure what is the cause. This medicine will make you lose your appetite_ however. Food isn't as appealing to me anymore_ and carbonated sodas taste terrible (I didn't really drink them much to begin with_ though). My stomach makes a lot of weird noises_ but it doesn't really hurt. I feel slightly dizzy at times_ but it is only occasionally and nothing that is really frightening. The numbness in my hands and feet_ however_ does get old after a while. If I cross my legs or sit on my feet_ they get pins and needles in about half the amount of time they used to. I also sleep funny_ so I wake up with numb hands and fingers. Being a college student is a little tricky with this as well. I can get through the word association okay because I write for fun on a daily basis_ but trouble with memorizing has impacted a few of my grades. I would recommend this medicine_ however. ONLY if you know you don't have strong reactions.,F,18,2  months50MG 1X D,2/9/2011,Topamax
393, 3, Migraines,Occasional tingling in hands and feet at times. Extreme memory loss_ inability to find words_ spell difficulties_ word replacement/confusion_ decreased short-term memory_ overall cognitive dysfunction.,It's hard to know exactly what side effects were caused by Topomax as I was simultaneously going thru treatment for Hep C while raising my dose of Topomax from 100 to 200mg/day. I am currently suffering from depression and have in the past_ but that is a risk when on treatment for Hep C as well. The biggest issue for me was the cognitive dysfunction it caused. I went from being a fast talker and one that has a vast vocabulary to having extreme difficulty forming single sentences. Words elude me now_ and I constantly use wrong words like using there instead of their which used to be a pet peve of mine. I feel like my brain has been damaged. For this reason I'm reducing my dosage slowly to try to see how low I can go w/o having the migraines come back. I don't want to go back to 20 migraines a month_ but this is far worse in my opinion. The least I ever had per month while on the 200mg dose was 10 migraines per mo. I can't take a Zomig to make my brain work again_ but I can to get rid of the migraine. I choose the migraines. :-(,F,34,2  years100mg 2X D,2/9/2011,Topamax

395, 1, migraines,The worst of the side effects had to be the facial tic. I didn't think it was from the topamax to begin with but it was. It started on one side then eventually both sides of my face would tic constantly. I was taking 100mg twice a day and when I decided to take my self off the med I got the worst headache I have ever had. I have had migraines for nearly 15 years and never been to the ER with one until coming off the Topamax. I got up at 2 in the morning and took myself to the ER. The next day I called the doc and he said it was likely from the withdrawl and that I would need to start back on a lower dose. I did fer a few weeks but the tic continued until I stopped completely. Other side effects included tingling/pins and needles/numbness_ foggy_ difficulty thinking remembering things. exhaustion_ attention. And very limited help with the migraines. Still had headaches.,do not abruptly stop taking this drug_ especially if you are on a higher dose. Drop your dose first_ that was honest to God the worst headache ever.,M,32,60  days100 2X D,1/27/2011Email,Topamax

My message to you is go and seek legal advice or show your parents this website and of how 80% of people taking this drug have had a bad reaction to it.My empathy goes out to everybody who has suffered from this evil drug. I am a normal male and quiet healthy_ not over weight and no emotional problems_ I started having chronic headaches in September 2010_ its now nearly February 2011 and I have been through every drug or feels like it until my neuro prescribed Topamax. In England you get worked up to full dose I guess in America they just throw you in at the deep end. 25mg once at night for first 7 days_ everything seemed ok_ then it was 25mg morning and night. I then realised I could not eat_ then soon found out I could not sleep either_ the next day the same again_ but now I was hyper and could not concentrate and was just acting oddly.

The medication did wonders for my migraines_ which I got on a 4-5 a week basis. The side effects_ however_ have impacted my entire life greatly. My memory of the time on the drug is very foggy_ as is my memory of the few years surrounding it. My word recall is horrific. My family has had to learn to read hand gestures to have decent conversations with me. I relapsed into anorexia which I had been many years distanced from and became very depressed and suicidal. I started having night panic attacks and my personality did a flip from bubbly and energetic to very shy and reserved. I've been off of the medication for about 2 years now and my word recall is still bad_ my depression and suicidal thoughts are finally leaving_ I still twitch often_ still get panic attacks and am even more susceptible to my ED than I was before. I don't recommend it at all. I finally got off of it because I didn't even remember to take it each day by the end.,F,18,18  months100mg 2X D,1/25/2011,Topamax

I've also delt with depression_ tingling in hands and feel and an overall feeling of just crap. Been sleeping 16+ hours a day. Funny that doc noticed until it involved one of my organs. AT 35 I should not be this sick. Oh forgot to mention the bone loss. I thought this was a fantasic drug. I lost weight and my the barfing_ eye sight loosing_ numbing_ pounding migranes were gone.

At higher doses_ over 50mg_ I was suicidal.,I work from home and live in the city so I never have to drive. I mention this because honestly_ this drug makes me a bit dumber. I forget what I'm doing_ where I'm going and where I've left things. And I stumble over words. And I have lost my attention span_ hence the worry about driving. I don't know that I would feel all that safe behind the wheel. I am still getting migraines_ but the other things I take after they start seem to work better with the Topamax and if I don't take the Topamax_ I am miserable for at least 12-24 hours_ so it's doing something. I have recently started Wellbutrin to counteract some of spaciness and help the Topamax_ since I can't increase the dosage. I tried 75mg and after 3 days I was suicidal.

401, 1, Chronic Migraine,Increasing hair loss_ mind confusion_increasing all over body pain similar to fibromyalgia_ dizziness and disorientation_ extreme tiredness yet unable to get a good continuous amount of sleep. Yeast infections starting after resuming topamax. Increased anxiety and depression even though I'm on anti-depressants.,"The first time on topamax it was a wonder drug. I went from a migraine every 2-3 days to one every 5 to 6 weeks. When I got a breakthrough migraine_ 2 Relpax and a couple of hours sleep and I was good as new. Then the weight loss started & I went from 164lbs to 103_ dropping from a size 14 to  a size 1. I looked like something from the war camps. My hair fell out in clumps and I lost control of my memory_ sinking into deep depression. I was taken off Topamax & the symptoms went away including the weight loss. I got my headaches back. After a 2year break we slowly reintroduced Topamax and my headaches became manageable again. My hair started falling out within a couple of weeks. I began to lose my co-ordination and my memory. Gradually extreme pains took over every part of my body and after having scans_ tests & MRI_ I was told nothing was wrong. I was also having increasing Yeast infections. This time I lost my appetite_ but  not weight. Headaches began to reappear more frequently until now they are back every day. I have no energy and of course I'm depressed. So my doctor has started weaning me off Topamax once again_ calling it a ""nasty"" drug. I think I'd rather fight with my non-stop headaches than cope with the side effects. At least now my husband has seen what I've been going through & has a better understanding of the problems with both the drugs and the migraines. He's never had a migraine.

When I started taking this is was great! My migraines were completely gone within a week and a half of starting with the low dosage but my doctor worked me up to 100 mg a day.  After about 7 months I started getting dull headaches that were lasting longer and longer to the point where I had a dull headache for about a week.  At that point the side effects were not worth it especially since it interferes with birth control as well.  I weened myself off of it and have gotten some headaches here and there but I have not had migraines like before ever since. Advil usually does the trick now.

Some depression and racing thoughts_ chest pains (but that could be stress linked-hard to say_ pins and needles in hand and feet_ increased weakness in hands at times (something I've noticed when doing surgery),I started on 25mg Sid and worked up to 25mg am and 50mg pm_ now currently weaning myself back off the drug to see if my low mood is due to it or not.I had pretty severe mirgaines around 6-10 a month before starting this drug.Having looked though my migraine diary perhaps at lower doses (25mg I dropped to 2-3 migraines a month) helped but at higher doses didn't. My rationale for that is I do a busy job requiring a high IQ input and this drug at high doses slows my thinking and ability to work as normal annoying me= stress= migraines. I plan to maintain on 25mg for a bit as it has reduced the severity of the migraines making me at least able to arrive for work. It's worth a try- just be aware of what you are trying I guess. The first week was very difficult to adjust to- I just made my bosses aware I was going on it and friends as well so they could monitor me for any extreme oddness!! good luck,F,27,4  monthsup to 75 1X D,1/6/2011,Topamax

I saw the doctor and they inceased my Paxil and put me on Klonopin. It helped for 2 weeks and then all of a sudden the symptoms were back. I waited 2 days and decided I couldn't deal with it anymore and stopped taking it. I saw my doctor again and he said I didn't have to taper since I was only on 3 weeks. I've been off 3 days and am slowly starting to feel better. I would rather deal with migraines than be in this hell! It worked great for the migraines_ but I couldn't live with the side effects.

All of the side effects are cyclical for me and as long as I am aware that they are related to Topomax I just deal with them. The worst was getting through the first three months on the drug while I cycled down from 75mg to 50mg. I know that I am on a low dose_ but getting through the side effects was REALLY difficult. My doctor told me about NONE of them.,I was getting crushing headaches for 2 weeks out of every month and getting them for 2 weeks straight. I get about 2 headaches a year now_ and I can kick them with some Advil. Topomax ROCKS!!! Even with all the crazy side effects.

I was experiencing a constant headache pain of about a 3 on scale of 1-10_ with migraines 1-2 times a week.  Since starting this drug 6 months ago I've had a total of about 3 migraines and that constant pain is gone.  The side effect of weight loss is an added bonus for me but I did not lose any weight the first couple of months that I took it. The numbness/tingling was irritating at first but the benefit of not having a screaming headache was so worth it.  I do notice that I cannot come up with the right words sometimes_ but there again_ I'd rather deal with that than be laying in bed writhing in pain for days!  All in all_ it's a wonderful drug but it is not one to be messed with_ it's a neurological medication and can do a lot of damage if it's not taken properly or for the right reasons.

My migraines were debilitating_ causing me to be a lesser person (went from 12-15 per month to 2-3 per month).  I think that some side effects are better than having migraines on a regular basis.

I can now be a great mom and feel alive and pain free 98% of the time!  Life is too short to suffer.  I can't even imagine my life without Topamax and wish I would've known about it many years sooner!,F,40,6  months50mg 1X D,11/29/2010Email,Topamax

But as time goes by_ I've noticed a gradual hair thinning that has become too much to deal with as a young woman. I have just finished discontinuation.

427, 1, Migraines,Severe insomnia_ mood swings_ crippling anxiety and agitated thinking_ depression and inability to go to work due to nonstop weeping.  Also sexual dysfunction_ hair thinning_ weight loss and tingling in limbs.,"I had high hopes for this medication_ but found the psychiatric side effects unbearable.  At first the side effects seemed innocuous enough.  I slept great_ lost a few pounds and felt better.  Then the tingling worsened in my limbs_ hands and feet. My neurologist dropped me down to a ""pediatric dose"" of 50 mg per night_ but things grew worse  I lost interest in sex and was unable to achieve orgasm.  I could not sleep due to severe anxiety and agitated circular thinking.  My mood swings worsened until I was crying uncontrollably and unable to go to work.  My doctor never warned me of psychiatric side effects.  I immediately tapered off the dose over two weeks and the side effects disappeared.  My migraines have not returned_ however_ I'd find them preferable to feeling so unhappy and unable to function.",F,46,6  weeks75 mg 1X D,11/23/2010Email,Topamax
428, 4, Migraine,I experienced numbness in my face_ hands and feet; slight dizziness; short-term memory issues; concentration problems; word-retrieval issues; saying the wrong word and not even realizing it!  Also_ mild hair thinning_ weight loss (30 pounds over a year)_ and face twitching.,Topamax has been a godsend to me_ even with its many side effects.  As a teacher_ the short-term memory and word-retrieval issues have been tough.  However_ it was much tougher trying to live my life with 16-20 migraine days per month!  Now I experience perhaps 4 migraine days monthly.  My quality of life overall is much better.  If I were younger_ high school or college age_ and had to learn a great deal of new material I could NOT function on topamax_ but at my stage of life it is fine.  I would also like to note that the side effects have lessened over time.  They were more severe the first year and are not very noticeable now.  In my situation_ the benefits have far outweighed the drawbacks_ although I can see how for other people this might not be the case.,F,37,3  years25 mg 3X D,11/19/2010,Topamax

At first it calmed and relaxed me_ but the last few days_ I have been having irritable mood swings and been starting to get a little depressed.  I tried to take 2 the other night and actually felt like I was going to have a panic attack!  It's so up and down with this drug.  Kind of like good days and bad days.  I have been weaning off of sinemet (100/125 3x day) to start this medication for dystonia.  I am no longer on the sinemet_ and today I could only tolerate taking a 1/2 of a topamax pill!  Oh_ and not to mention crazy dreams and waking up in the am drenched in sweat sometimes.  Is this all normal?  Will these effects go away???  These mental side effects and mood swings are actually kind of scaring me and the doctors office wants me to wait until Monday when I come in to see if I feel any better.

But the worst side effect was the Memory Loss which after more than 2 years after discontinuing the Topamax my memory has not returned at all. I always had a great memory and a phenomanal vocabulary_ all of that has disappeared. I had a a neuro-psych test that showed my I.Q. dropped 11 points & a subsequent MRI showed I have 'White Matter Disease' i.e. pre-dementia.,A study showed that 11.2% of those that take Topamax experience memory loss_ but all my psychiatrist told me was that I would lose weight. My neurologist sent me for an EEG which indicated I was having seizures.

My functionability has improved greatly because my constant head pain is mostly gone. Still working on figuring out the perfect dosage. I have an ocassional migrain sneak through_ and my neuro gave me Imitrex as a ""rescue"" drug for that. The combo seems to work. I was told by a relative who is a pharmicist that Ambien CR may have been the cause of some of the initial ""word loss_"" but I don't know that for sure. As a person who makes a living with words (I'm a reporter) the loss of words and concentration is frightening and decidely inconvenient_ to say the least. But it actually seems to be getting better.

The migraines stopped! I always read people talking about being depressed on it_ but mine was opposite. I was always SUPER chipper. Tragedies like death_ heartache_ hating my job & other things I would normally be upset about didnt even phase me.  It felt really good! I tolerated the other side effects until I started college. Thats when I noticed that I couldnt concentrate or remember anything.  I used to be a phenomenal speller & a great student_ A's & B's. Not anymore... I was so hyper that I couldn't sit to study. If I managed to_ then I couldn't remember what I read & had to re-read everything_ but still couldn't remember. I failed 2 classes...I weened myself off Topamax & have been off it for 6 months_ but still have anxiety & memory issues. I have a terrible time thinking of words & how to spell.

Though I had tingling in my extremities. However_ second time around I was placed on 50 mg twice a day_ and I have horrible memory_ concentration problems_ stammering_ and word recall--so much so that my pdoc has decided to lower my dose (though this could possibly be in combination with Lamictal I am on as well),Really great and I love it's beneficial effects in terms of controlling my bingeing tendencies_ yet the cognitive consequences outweigh the benefits considering the fact that I am a college student.,F,20,12  months50mg 2X D,10/28/2010,Topamax

Topamax has really smoothed out my moods. My only complaint would be that I feel a bit dulled. My best friend noticed this too_ that I'm not as witty or sharp. But my boyfriend finds me a lot easier to live with. No negative physical side effects at all--maybe because I do split my dose up to 3x a day. Also_ I lost no weight.

Then the migraines started coming once a week. After trying several other meds unsuccessfully_ Topamax STOPPED them completely. It was such a relief to me and my husband and kids!  My original dose was 50mg 2x/day_ which I did for a year. At that dose I had some negative side effects. After one really terrifying nightmare_ I decided to try cutting my dose in half to see if the headaches stayed away. It worked!  The bad side effects -sadness_ trouble finding words_ nightmares have gone.  Everyone's body chemistry is different.

As you can see_ I have been on it for three years and plan on staying on it for the rest of my life. I had debilitating migraines that lasted days. I am a teacher and would crawl under my desk in my office until a substitute was called and then would be out for a day or so afterwards....they were that bad. I had the traditional aura and then exactly 20 minutes later pain and nausea that lasted for 8-10 hours. Then I would feel like my head was in a vice for 2 days afterwards.

I was standing in front of my suitcase packing and the next thing I remeber is waking up in an ambulance_ disoriented_ vomiting and crying. I had no idea where I was or what had happened to me. I was 42 years old at the time_ with no personal or family history of seizures or epilepsy.They did some preliminary testing-bloodwork and a CT scan at the hospital. When I got home_ I began seeing a neurologist and had an EEG_ MRI_ and more blood work. I had none of the markers of epilepsy and was not diagnosed with epilepsy. My doctor_ an elderly man in his late 70's told me I had ""abnormal brain waves"" and that I needed to go on anti-seizure medicine. He wanted to put me on Keppra and I said how about Topamax (only knowing that it suppresed one's appetite).If only I knew then what I know now! Hindsight is 20-20_ as the saying goes!He told me I would be on it for the rest of my life. I didn't drive for three full months. I started out slow_ titrating up my dosage. I was supposed to work up to 200 mg in the morning and at night_ but when I got to 75 mg AM and PM_ that was too much for me. The cognitive/memory  side effects were terrible.

After a two week migraine in May that had me took me on a brief trip to the ER_ I went on Topamax.  I'm a fairly articulate and well spoken person so I was EXTREMELY concerned about the cognitive side effects of this medication.  While I have noticed it myself_ my family and friends say they have not.  I was originally very concerned that it was affect my job and my ability to speak_ but it hasn't.  It's the word finding that I find utterly confusing.  I will know the word I am trying to say_ but it just won't come out.  This medication has all but stopped my migraines.  I still have menstrual related migraines_ but I have gone down from 7-10 debilitating migraines a month to 1 or 2.

I went from that incident to persistent aura without infarction-basically visual aura symptoms that were continuous and so bad my husband had to come get me where I was on my busness trip and bring me home and take me to a neurologist.  i have tried every other drug out there to stop the aura and the subsequent headaches_ and so far this is the only one that has had an effect at any level or if it worked_ did not make me outright sick.

I have suffered with bipolar depression for years and have had a hard time with medications and side effects_ topamax surprisingly has been a godsend for me_ and my family too for that matter- I guess everyones body is different and reacts differently- I haven't lost my hair_ I have lost weight_ I feel good and no longer suffer any side effects of the drug.,F,33,6  months100 mg 2X D,9/3/2010Email,Topamax

I went from daily headaches and missing work one day a week to no headaches at all. Topamax also has vastly improved my ability to sleep_ which has improved my life and made my prescription for Ambien irrelevant. The side effects are minimal and not bothersome. Would love to see the weight loss but have not_ at least not yet. The prospect of kidney stones is worrisome_ so I try to drink a lot of water. If your doctor suggests this drug_ try it.

457, 3, mood stabilizer,altered taste sensation_ fuzzy thinking (although this seemed to wear off after a little while)_ weight loss_ severe acne breakouts,I was initially really pleased with how topamax helped me feel: calmer_ more in control of my emotional reactions and responses_ more able to rationalise rather than feeling like everything was doomed; I also experienced quite significant weight loss.  However about 2 months after taking it _my skin started to break out really severly_ especially around the jawline.  I had teenage acne so did not initially put it down to being the topamax_ especially as its not a listed side effect.  However no treatments_ skin care or other topical medication helped_ and _y confidence fell really low.  Stopped taking topamax about 2 months ago just to test out what would happen_ my skin has improved to the point of only a minor breakout at certain times in the month....but_ I am also noticing a return to old patterns of thinking and a drop in my overall mood stability.

My scalp has been very itchy and I get terrible dry mouth/bad breath.  I also have noticed a lower sex drive.

When the doctor started me on this medicine_ we had to keep increasing my dosage because it didn't seem to be helping. I am taking this along with Imitrex. since taking the higher dose_ it has minimized the amount of migraines I get a month. Instead of getting the 2 a week I used to_ I now get maybe 2 a month. So it definitely works_ the only downfall is the side effects_ which aren't too bad...I have experienced weight loss_ I have lost 30lbs since being on it..people comment all the time and think I don't eat. I am loosing hair_ not to the point of baldness_ but loosing more than normal. I sweep up hair off my bathroom floor everyday.

I couldn't function or work. It was unbearable. Topomax has literally saved me! When I first started the medication_ my sodas tasted like metal and food tasted horrible and my fingers and toes tingled but those side effects went away. The past six months I have developed new side effects that include abdominal/pelvic pain to the point that I ended up in the ER on several visits that resulted in undiagnosed pain. My hair has also thinned to the point where I have started wearing wigs until it grows out. Over the last three years I have went from a size 16 to a size 3/4. SOme people say I look as if I do drugs or have an eating disorder. Despite these side effects and the pain my body feels_ to me it is worth it because I have not had a migraine in three years!

But soon after all the side effects started popping up one by one. At first I thought nothing of it and really didn't notice. But once I became paranoid and felt the ""bugs"" crawling on me all the time I started wondering if I was insane. So I made an appointment with my primary care doctor immediately. He actually laughed at me a little and said ""Oh_ you just aren't taking enough."" So he requested that I begin taking 100mg daily to ""stabilize"" my moods. And he also told me that hair loss was NOT a side effect of this drug. I was dumbfounded when I left the office. I immediately went home and googled it.

Tingling in my hands and feet_ all I had to do was reach over my head for a minute or two and I had pins and needles in my hands. Cross my legs to sit and one or both feet had pins and needles or would go to sleep altogether. Light trails. I would watch the light that surrounded an object that moved_ move after the object had stopped moving. Breathing problems. I could no longer walk as far as before without being short of breath. I walk a lot at my job_ about 6 miles a night or more. Bruising. I got bit by your average yard ant a few times on my foot and I scratched it like normal people do_ they turned into bruises. Same with mosquito bites. Probably the scariest side effect I had though was at work one night. I'd had a rough day already and some problems at home. I found myself planning suacide. I caught myself and I knew something was wrong. I had never done that before and I was with it enough to realize that something was seriously wrong! That's the night I quit taking Topamax!

I came upon this site to look for another drug and I just now realized how many side effects I have that may be linked to Topamax.  It's the only thing that keeps me functioning though without a daily migraine. And I have to be at work in order to pay the mortgage.  I seem to take a lot higher dose than most of you.  300 mg.  I take 100 in the morning and 200 at night.  Everytime I try to wean back_ the migraines hit me like bricks.

We worked together to find my correct dosage_ and are discussing my BMI (I'm a small framed woman) because I have lost some weight on the drug.  He's concerned that I need to decrease the dose now that my side effects have diminished and I haven't had a headache in a couple of months.  I really feel like my Topamax experience has been successful_ not ""perfect"" -- because it's a try-it-until-you-find-what's-right-for-you kind of drug -- and my Dr. has been very clear about managing my side effects and NOT having me on any doseage that's causing me any impaired functions.  I know everyone's experience is different_ but I have been pleased with how my Dr. has handled mine.

I was not clinically depressed before taking it to prevent migraines. Yet still I became so unlike myself_ suicidal thoughts and full of rage_ I realized I COULD NOT GET OFF IT QUICKLY ENOUGH!

Plus_ withdrawal is still a better mental zone than ""on Tope."" On day 2 it felt like a glass jar popped off my head--ahhh! Good! But then I had near-total insomnia for 6 days_ trembling_ and diarrhea (a nuisance). Suddenly then I slept for almost 3 days straight. My mood gradually returned to normal and I felt like ""me"" after 2 weeks_ though very shaken and upset by what had happened; I felt normal and controlled at 3 weeks.

Topamax allowed me to complete my job without multiple absences; it gave me hope.  Then my doctor increased my dose to 50mg- I started suffering from terrifying mood swings and horrific depression.  Within a week I was back to 25mg and have been on that ever since.   While this medicine does do wonders for my Migraines (have cut them down to one every couple of months)_ it's side effects are hideous.

Within one day of being off of it the panic attacks stopped.  Now I have to deal with the,I don't want to discourage anyone from taking this medication since it helped me so much with the pain.  I just wish this side effect was more well known so my doctor could have identified it sooner and i wouldn't have been having multiple panic attacks every night for that  whole month_ losing sleep and being nervous I would wake up with one.

Since starting on the increased dosage_ I have hardly experienced any headaches_ and the ones I do have are sinus headaches.  The side effects are worth it for the relief of the headaches.  I do admit that the memory is probably the worse_ but for now_ I will just blame that on old age.

It was debilitating; I work as a freelancer and actually lost two commissions because I simply couldn't motivate myself to finish the projects and couldn't concentrate on my work.  I lost any interest in my work_ my family or even crawling out of bed in the morning.  I felt horrible! I could tell myself intellectually that nothing was wrong_ but for no reason I would be swamped by an overwhelming feeling of sadness and begin to cry for no reason.  I wanted to do nothing but crawl into bed and sleep_ which is what I did most days.Some days I actually forgot to eat until dinner time and I lost 15 pounds in three months_ which would be fine if I was eating healthy_ but I was simply forcing food down at the dinner table to survive.

Difficulty waking up. Memory issues.,"I have had chronic Migraines for years. I have tried most of the medications available for the prevention of_ as well as the releif of the migraine once they do occur. When I started with Topamax I was happy with the results in spite of the immediate side effects of the tingling feelings_vision & difficulty waking in the morning. Soon though I started to notice my hair_ which had always been long and thick_ started to fall out and dry out. I tried all the commercially available hair products to help with this but nothing really seemed to help. I was really willing to go the distance for a medication that helped with my migraines since the migraines have had such a devastating affect on my life. They didn't help. I didn't lose all of my hair_ it leveled off but it has not improved at all. The most disturbing side effect_ that I don't read very much about_ is the effect on the immune system. As a 46 year old woman who was not ill_ other than some stress_ I was surprised when I got Shingles. I mean I was shocked. I have always had a robust immune system. I have been catching colds and taking longer to heal from scraches than I usually do. I spoke with my neurologist about this_ and the fact that the Topamax doesn't seem to be working as well as it first did. He didn't seem too concerned about the shingles (it was on my side) and didn't have an alternative to the Topamax that I haven't tried so he prescribed me a new anti-depressant to ""boost"" the effects of Topamax",F,46,2  years50mg 3X D,4/20/2010,Topamax

527, 4, cluster headaches,stupidity - memory loss_ trouble forming sentences_ finding the right words_ loss of concentration_ loss of appetite_ taste changes_ tingling in extemities_ lack of energy_ confusion,I recently started back on topamax after a new cluster began. I took this drug 5 years ago and it stopped the cluster after about one month. The side effects can be hard to deal with but no where near as bad as the daily headaches. If your Dr puts you on a 100mg or higher dose to begin with_ find a new doc. This stuff requires you to start slow and build up to a dose that works for you. Start with 25mg at night for a week then 25 at night and 25 in the morn after a week_ then 25 in the morn and 50 at night for a week_ then 50/50 for a while. I was able to drop down to 50mg per day taken at bedtime to limit most side effects and still keep the pain away. I eased off the drug after 4 months and was OK as the cluster had passed and was headache free for 5 years. I'm working back up to 100mg per day now since this cluster started and have just has the first 3 days in a row with no headache. I will continue to take the med like I did last time knowing what to expect. I quit drinking carbonated soda (and beer) last time and never started back so no problems there. This med really makes soft drinks taste like crap but the caffine wasn't helping the headaches so it needed to go anyway. The side effects ease up after a while_ especially if you can get by on a lower dose. I still keep some triptans around in case of a breakthru headache but I know with the topamax I can survive till the cluster passes and and all the side effects will be gone soon after I discontinue use of the drug,M,37,4  months50mg 2X D,4/12/2010,Topamax

Memory loss and talking too much about my life to strangers. Weird need for acceptance and validation.,I stopped taking this medication finally because I ran out and didn't get some for a week. The medication does not have the same affects (good or bad) if you stop taking it and start again. For me_ in my altered state of mind_ this was bad because my appetite came back and I couldn't control my eating habits as much as I would like with my eating disorder. So that delay in getting my prescription probably saved my life or I would be about 85lbs today and convinced that that was fine. Very powerful medication. I have been off for several years now and still have some of the side affects. It's hard to find the right word and I still can't read numbers out loud in the correct order without going very very slowly. I killed my metabolism with the eating disorder and now have 35 lbs to lose instead of gain. Oh_ and my ex's family still thinks I'm nuts because they met me on this medication.

I used to be an A+ student_ I graduated from high school with a 4.0 GPA. Now_ I am struggling to make grades in college_ and not because I am too social_ I barely even go out because I always feel so exhausted. I have trouble concentrating_ remembering things_ spelling and constructing sentences. I had more to add to that list but I forgot it_ which is typical. Very bad memory_ compared to my very good memory before starting Topamax. I used to be quick as a whip_ but not anymore_ I am very very slow.

Most of these side effects decreased/disappeared after about a year.,I started taking Topamax in college when I was getting a few migraines per week. It has helped tremendously_ and I now only get 1 or 2 headaches per month.  The side effects are a little scary though_ and I definitely think that Topamax has affected my ability to think/concentrate.  Beyond the normal hand/feet tingling_ I have experienced some really weird feelings a couple of times when I feel like my hands or arms are enlarged.  This will last for a few minutes and then go away.  I lost about 10 pounds when I went on Topamax_ but have gained most of this initial loss back over about 2 years (I think it was mostly from the medicine initially affecting what foods were appealing...I can now drink soda and it doesn't taste flat).  Also_ when I first started the medicine I was cold all the time_ to the point where I couldn't hold a drink without having napkins around it because it would make my hand too cold.  I started taking B12 vitamins which seemed to help.  Depression has definitely been a side effect on and off throughout.  I am on a plan now to wean myself off over the next few weeks.  While Topamax has worked wonders on my migraines_ it has to be weighed against all of the side effects.

The day I left work to go home two miles away and got lost (same route for 10 years)_ I finally realized that maybe it was the medication.  Did I mention I lacked insight too?

560, 1, hemiplegic migraines,tingling in fingers_ face_ and inside my body_ yes i know it sounds weird. ringing in my ear. lack of taste. pain in my eye. Visualy disturbances including_ seeing things in slow motion_ or a trail behind it specifically in lightly lit rooms. My brain would copy objects_ for example If i looked in a fun mirror that distorts things a certain way... when i looked away i would see everything else like the mirror was reflecting for just a few seconds_ but could repeat this with clear objects w/ texture_ and mirrors. I also saw a blue tracer behind any object in lightly lit rooms. sleepy. being depressed_ and moody. Not being able to taste food_ and lost alot of weight. Also trouble thinking and concentrating. Felt like a zombie. A ton of hair loss. they thought some of the visual things were caused by my very complicated migraine_ but i am very sensitive with meds and particularly to this one. it did more harm than good. I still have tracers and trails behind things_ but it's not as intens,Everyone reacts to it differently. I think that it really does help some people. I will never take it again_ and if you take it and finds it does more harm than good than stop taking it right away.,M,19,4  months100 mg 4X D,2/23/2010,Topamax

No side effects were noted at the 25 mg dosage_ but at 50 mg_ the side effects mentioned became apparent_ and at 75_ they became intolerable to a point I found myself just wanting to pull my hair out. (I didn't...just felt like it.) The visuals I saw are like nothing I've read about. Sitting in meetings_ people's voices wouldn't even make sense. My doctor was conveniently out of town_ so I kept trying to deal with it. I asked a pharmacist who said ""all medicine has side effects"". Finally_ I just quit taking Topamax (2 weeks ago) and I felt the best I've felt in a couple months in spite of having migraines.

565, 1, Migraines,I'm positive it's Topamax that causes the twitching because I was on higher doses_ then lowered down to 25mg 2X a day and the twitching stopped.  Recently I was upped back to 50mg 2X a day when my migraines returned since I have now completed a migraine study that I was on for a year.  Just WAIT until the new drug Levadex is released to the public!  I was one of the LUCKY people on the study for a year.  It's an inhaled drug like an asthma inhaler with the only side effects that it tastes funny and you just rinse your mouth out after you inhale the puffer.  Get this_ it kicked 99% of my headaches and migraines in about 10 to 15 minutes!  Yup_ I am NOT kidding!  I am DYING now that I can't have the inhaler until the FDA releases the medicine to the public.  It's been about a month now.  Give it about two years for it to hit the pharmacy at least.

566, 4, migraines,My headaches were worse at first--but i stuck with it and then they improved significantly; tingling in hands/face/heel that is painful at times (this has improved since my doctor recommended taking vitamin B and B12); hair loss (this still hasn't improved...); fatigue in first two weeks only (it wears off significantly); loss of words in the first month (that wears off); eyes burning and dry_ especially when I am in the sun all day; reduced sex drive; I now hate the taste of soda; dry mouth; slight loss of appetite,Most of the side effects truly wear off_ just be patient!!!! Also_ this medicine has really evened out my moods. It makes me feel a lot better all the time. I have heard this is the opposite for some people (they feel angry on it). You may feel your headaches get worse at first. Just wait--they will improve. Take vitamin B with vitamin B12 if you have bad tingling. This helped me a lot to reduce the tingling. It isn't completely gone--but it has helped. Others recommend bananas.,F,25,2  months,2/3/2010,Topamax

Being a very young teenager_ my neurologist was weary to put me on this drug. My mother is a pharmacist and agreed to help me titrate up on the drug. I started losing my appetite while on 25 mg and titrated up 25 mg per week. I did not experience any help with the migraines (which were an everyday thing) until about a month of taking the medicine_ which I got to 100 mg a day. It still did not get rid of them completely so we decided to bump up my dose to 150 mg a day. This is when I started experiencing the tingling and numbness in my hands_ feet_ and face. We went down to 125 mg a day and after continuing to be on this medicine it has helped me tremendously. If suggested_ I would give this medicine at least two months to work.

569, 4, Migraines,Tingling only when exercising or upping my dose.  Possible abdominal pain_ brain fog_ lost words_ weight loss_ hair loss_ ear ringing,"I began to use Topamax close to a year ago for severe migraines that occured 2-3 times a week that last each lasted 1-3 days each.  Imitrex was used to treat them_ however it didn't always take care of them.  I started out on 25 mg of Topamax_ moving up 25mg about 4-6 wks out_ once migraines would begin to reappear.  It has dramatically changed my life migraine wise_ however it has been an adjustment with the loss of words_ and the slower brain.  I am naturally a small person 5'2"" and have struggled to maintain a healthy weight as I was a healthy weight before_ I lost about 8 lbs.  I have tinnititis from previous ear damage_ so the additional ringing can get annoying_ when it is quiet in my house_ sometimes it feels like I can hear Cicadas outside in the trees all day long!!  I think the one thing that has bothered me the most is the hair loss.  I had a thick head of hair_ and this past winter due to snow storms I had to up my dose twice in a short period of time due to the pressures.  Everytime I wash my hair (everyother day)_ I lose about a handfull of hair.  I do not have any ""baby"" hairs growing_ and my hair is just getting thinner and thinner.  I feel like I am getting really down this winter_ and worry about depression_ which seems to be a common theme on this blog.

I think the weight loss experienced from this drug is because it alters your sense of taste_ but it comes back at least somewhat over time. Just eating a banana every day was enough to resolve the tingling for me.,After trying about everything else commonly prescribed_ I was desperate to try something else for migraines_ which I was getting several times a week. In the beginning this drug was helping me. I slowly worked up to 100mg_ then when that stopped working briefly went to 200mg (too much for me - I couldn't function at work) then quickly back down to 100mg. But now I am getting migraines about as frequently as when I began taking this drug. I refuse to increase the dose - this stuff is toxic. I have decided (with my Dr.) to try to wean myself off of. I want my brain_ sex drive and taste buds back. I am down to 75mg/day for a few weeks then will go to 50_ 25 then be done with it.

571, 1, migraines,permanent depression,When Topamax was relatively new I was prescribed it at the age of 14 for migraines.  At first I was fine with the medication and it worked well to help prevent my migraines from occurring as frequently.  About 6 months later out of the blue I attempted suicide.  I at the time had no history of depression and depression does not run in my family.  After the attempt I continued to have severe problems with depression despite being taken off Topamax.  I have talked to my psychiatrist and she mentioned that a few of her other patients had mentioned the same problem.  I am now 24 and still plagued with major depression that requires medication just for me to function.  I would be very leary of this medication.,F,24,6  months,1/24/2010Email,Topamax

I have always had hormonal headaches and miagraines but this past Sep I started having almost daily on/off severe pain that could make a person crazy. This went on for 3 months.  After lab work_ CT scans_ and a MRI I was diagnosed with cluster headaches. After starting this medication I have had 2 headaches that I was able to treat with advil. I don't know how I could have kept going without it_ my life had come to a standstill. If the side effects are just bothersome try a lower dose.

The med is very new for me. I am now on 50 mg_ nightly. My mood has been swinging up and down since I started the med (not good)_ so cannot give it a 4 yet. It could be because I am titrating down from a high dose of Risperidal and Lamictal. I can feel why this is a med you have to go up slowly on. The side effects hit you pretty quick. The loss of appetite started by day three and I was only on 25 mg. I do appreciate a medication that has taken away the zombie sugar cravings! Now seeing a box of Cap'n Crunch turns my stomach! :) I am taking a multi-vitamin_ and B-complex hoping to ameliorate the cognitive disruption (however as I write this I am using the spell check. LOL). Email me if you want to know more. I have a lot of hope in this med.

I started it in 1997 at 450mg/day- slow increase. I now have no side effects due to taking potassium supplements_ vitamins and also drinking a lot of water. Even my memory and word recall are back to 'nearly' pre-topamax levels. I had to work at that though through brain activities.,Topamax was started after failing mutiple anti-seizure medications. It was the first drug to stop my grand-mal seizures so I found it to be a miracle drug despite its numerous side effects. I found that I could get rid of the side effects with some research-- potassium supplements_ increased vitamins_ ensure shakes for weight_ lots of water_ brain exercises for memory and word-recall...I'm happy to say that along with my other seizure medications I've remained (almost) seizure free and nearly side-effect free also for a long time.

These side effects would be extremely worse if I didn't just take the medication at night. I highly recommend only taking this medicine right before you go to sleep. This greatly minimizes the brain slowing effects.,Topomax has not helped with my migraines_ but I have found it to be very helpful on other things. I used to have a couple of alcoholic beverages each night and now only have a couple a week_ I lost the 10 pounds I have been wanting to lose for the past several years in 4 monthts without even trying because of Topomax relieving my crazy food cravings_ and it has helped me have a calmer/more content demeanor about me accorinding to my husband and family. So I am going to continue taking topomax as a supplement to my bipolar medication. I found the maximum benefits for this purpose with the least side effects to be at 75mg.

I thought initially that it sort of helped the intensity of my migraines_ but after 2 1/2 years finally realized they were the same!  I still took the same amount of Imitrex.  I really think this drug made me so stupid that  it just didn't dawn on me.  I lost 10 pounds right away_ and I didn't need to lose anything for sure!  It was awful--I made myself eat some just to stay alive--how sad is that?!  I love to cook and eat_ and there was no enjoyment in that anymore.  Not to mention sometimes while driving_ I would totally forget how to drive!  Not safe with two little kids in the car!  I couldn't exercise anymore_ and I'm a runner!  I hated that.  After being off it for a while_ I was able to run again and finished my first marathon this year.  Take that_ Topamax!!!  The side effects of Topamax are extreme_ and unless it's helping you in an extreme way_ I would not advise this drug.  You also have no libido--not good.  Also_ I would hate for any children to be on this--you cannot possibly do well in school on this.  I couldn't even read a book--no concentration or   ability to focus. I'm sure there are times when the benefits of this drug outweigh the side effects_ but that's definitely not true for me.  Also_ I don't like being on a drug that makes me physically dependant.

They aren't swollen but they feel as if they are. I'm scheduled to see another dr to take me off this and the original antidepressant because I just can't take all these side effects any more.

584, 4, Cluster headaches,Tingling in fingers_ toes_ heels of feet; weight loss; loss of appetite; ability to ignore cravings; constipation; extreme thirst; blurry vision; difficulty concentration; difficulty spelling at times; difficulty recalling words at times,Topamax completely took care of my cluster headaches_ which were ruining my life. I started at 25 mg daily and tapered up to 100 mg over 4 weeks. However_ my headaches are seasonal so I only get them in the fall and spring_ so now that it is winter I am going to taper off of this drug because of the side effects. The weight loss worked for me- I lost 15 lbs (10% of my initial weight) in 4 weeks without trying. I was mildly overweight so the loss was good. Food tasted the same and I got hungry at mealtimes but I filled up VERY quickly. I am extremely thirsty on this drug_ so I have been drinking up to 80 oz. water per day_ which could contribute to my filling up quickly. I also noticed a decrease in cravings. I still get them sometimes but it is much easier to tell myself no. In the last couple of weeks my appetite has come back somewhat_ and I've been losing more slowly. I still get tingles in my fingers and toes and my vision is blurry_ especially at night_ which worries me. I am a college student and the cognitive problems are making my life difficult. I can do calculus but I have a lot of trouble adding up easy numbers in my head. I take notes and look at them later and many words are misspelled. I have to read things several times to understand what's said. I have never had these kinds of problems before. Because my headaches are seasonal_ dealing with the side effects for a couple of months is worth it_ but I'd be careful about taking this stuff for long term migraines.,F,21,6  weeks,1/9/2010Email,Topamax

I couldn't feel my fingers and toes when I would wake up in the morning. Coke_ my favorite drink_ tasted nasty. (I eventually gave it up_ which is probably better anyway.) I just didn't feel like myself. I don't recommend this medication.,F,25,4  months,12/11/2009,Topamax
595, 5, Bipolar II (rapid cycling),Nausea all day but could also be due to Yasmin that I started taking at the same time; anxiety in the first two weeks; difficulty with word retrieval; stumbling over my words; silly typos; a bit emotional (could be Yasmin); weight loss; stopped craving sugar and carbs;,I think Topamax is wonderful! I was on Epilim (sodium valproate) for 15 months and although it helped stabilize my moods to a certain extent_ I gained 40 pounds and experienced severe fatigue and brain fog. I have never felt so stupid in my life! I experience only about 10% of this brain fog on Topamax which I can cope with plus I have lost 11 pounds in just 6 weeks. It is wonderful to be freed from the binge eating and shopping sprees that I was prone to before. I feel like the real me has emerged from bipolar hell - a calm_ in control_ happy person who is in touch with the world. It took me 28 years to get the right diagnosis for my condition and 2 years to find the right drug... what a miracle! I am so grateful!,F,44,6  weeks,12/10/2009Email,Topamax

I had this numbing sensation_ double vision_ saw trails_ insomnia_ anxiety.  Simply awful.,THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE DRUG I HAVE EVER TAKEN!

597, 3, Bulimia/weight loss/mood stabilizer,In contrast to most views of Topomax on here_ I have had little to no side effects.  I take 100 mgs twice a day.  It makes me drowsy_ but that effect is wearing off.  From what I've read_ the main reason I don't have side effects such as tingling sensations_ numbness_ hair loss_ and mental difficulties is that I happen to take vitamin supplements already that Topamax seems to deplete or require more of in the body.  These supplements are: Multivitamin_ Vitamin-B Complex_ Vitamin-D3_ and Flax-seed Oil capsules (Omega-3's).  For some reason some or all of these supplements prevent most of the unpleasant side effects associated with Topamax.,I am pretty excited about Topamax_ especially because it just went generic as topirimate so now it's really cheap.  I am really_ really hoping this drug will give me some relief from my binge eating disorder which makes my life kind of stressful.  Losing a significant amount of weight would definitely be nice_ but it would be even nicer if Topamax could ease the struggle about binging/purging in my MIND.  I'm hoping this won't just be a band-aid_ but will be a multifaceted component to my emotional recovery.,M,27,2  weeks,12/1/2009Email,Topamax

Seriously_ straight through for 7 days_ even right now. My eyes were blurry and while I was at work yesterday I just forgot how to talk. I was shaky_ nauseous_ almost incoherent and felt like passing out. I ended up in the ER not to much later_ my neurologist told the ER to tell me to stop taking it. Before this episode yesterday I noticed I was always on edge and moody. I couldn't concentrate_ it could be due to the constant migraine or this medication.

Was put on low dose of topamax (25mg) and reacted badly: after three days_ I spent one day completely spaced out_ not really sure what was going on_ awful mood swings.  The doctor lowered the dose by half and I was fine.  The spaciness was gone_ and all the other side effects went away after the first couple of weeks.  After two months I was starting to get migranes at night_ so he upped it back to 25mg_ but this time with half taken in the morning and half at night.  As long as I take it EXACTLY 12 hours apart_ I just have some finger tingling_ weight loss_ forgetting a few words (not too bad_ and I'm a writer)_ and a general lack of motivation / lethargy (which is annoying).  But_ I'm expecting that to go away in a few weeks like it did last time.  I can actually go to work all day and work out at the gym and live a life without horrible migraines and nausea_ so these side effects are really nothing compared to what I was living with before.  I really do have to be careful about the timing of the medicine_ though_ because one day I took one dose a couple hours late_ and the next day I was unusually aggressive until the combo dose wore off -- or at least that's what I kinda remember_ because that whole day is a little fuzzy.  This is definitely a strong drug and direction have to be followed exactly.,F,28,3  months,11/21/2009,Topamax

From my perspective: The past month has just been hell on the whole family.  When my husband began hearing and seeing things that were not there I feared it was another medication_ the fentenal patch_ because he had been taking topomax for some time.  His symptoms got worse quickly.  He was not eating_ sleeping_ became angry at times and at other times was a sweet-heart.  He would be hot_ then cold and shiver.  He became paranoid_ thinking people were coming to hurt us. He even called the police telling them there were several men sneaking around the yard (we live out in the country)swearing he could here them talking on walky-talkies.  The mood swings were terrible- everyone was walking on egg shells not knowing what to expect next.  It got to the point where he was shoving one of our kids out of the way to ""get"" whatever he thought he saw. He also became physically combative with me when I tried to stop him from going after ""them"".  I finally had to trick him into going to a hospital where they sent him to a ""mental facility."" Once there he was immediately sent up to ICU_ for 3 days_ as directed by the psychologist.  He weighed in at 125 pounds-well below normal weight for a man that is 5'11"".  During his stay at the hospital_ he was taken off both fentenal patch and Topamax.

It took 6 days at 1/2 the dose for us  to begin to see a change from there it continued to get better and better. Her happy fun personality is back. You can reason with her. She is not a stressed out mess.She is not quick to anger. She is starting to have some realization of how she behaved while on Topamax- and that weighs extremely heavy on her mind and heart.  I daily berate my self for not contacting professional help earlier. I look forward to the day when I turn on the TV and this poision has been removed from the market. If you take any thing away from this_ let it be this; research any and all medications your family and friends are prescribed- research before they take it and research everytime a prescription is filled.

I started at 25 mg. and moved up to 100 mg. over 4 weeks. Immediately I noticed my appetite was gone and I was in a fog. My weight dropped 7lbs. in a week which was a good thing. I'm a Director for a major corporation so I researched the side effects for a few months prior to taking the medicine on the advice from my neurologist. The fact was either I was going to miss work for migraines or deal with short term side effects and not suffer from the migraines. The hair loss was short term_ over the first four weeks and it seemed to stop.At the six week point my appetite is back more_ not completely but I do get hungry more than I did initially. I am still losing weight_ my fatigue is gone and my memory is completely back to normal. My doctor told me there is a ""hump"" to get over with the side effects and I feel great. I had one migraine in the past six weeks when I went from 75 mg up to 100mg and one Excedrin migraine took care of it. I assumed it was a side effect of moving up in milligrams. Normally I would have 3 per week without Topamax. Good luck to everyone and stick with it.I plan on continuing with the Topamax_ I can't take the pain of having migraines multiple times per week and Imitrex would spike my blood pressure which is normally low.

Can't remember simple things or names or words to finish a sentence. And for two years I have had muscle and joint pain_ had x-rays and tests_ they say go home your fine and now read that one of the side effects is joint and musce pain. Called my Neurologist today and he said no one has told him that before!?!? I am now going off the drug and unless your life is unbearable due to the headache I would not recommend this drug. Please email if you like I know more of you have had the same symtoms. So I did give the drug time after 5 years but now can't deal with it anymore.

628, 2, chronic migraines,confusion_ trouble with word usage_ weight loss_ metalic taste in mouth_ diarrhea_ twitching in eye & cheek_ hair loss_ memory loss_ fatigue_ problems with comprehension & attention,"I was prescribed 50 mg of Topamax 2x daily with the goal of increasing to 100 mg_ 2x daily.  I have suffered from migraines since the age of 6_ and was placed on Topamax as a ""last resort"" since my migraines had increased in frequency (daily migraines.)  The Topamax DID stop the migraines. That part was wonderful.  The weight loss was also nice. However_ I experienced almost every possible side effect of the drug.  I am a college professor and found that I could not recall words during lectures_ could not respond to students' questions (they had to repeat their questions 2 or 3 times before I comprehended)_ and essentially felt like a zombie walking through life.  I also experienced extreme fatigue_ twitching in my left eye and cheek_ hair loss_ diarrhea_ and of course memory loss.  I am a big soda drinker_ but found all sodas (and other liquids in general) to taste like metal.  I had no interest in food_ and found all foods to be tasteless.  It was rather scary to be in a confused ""cloud"" at all times_ so I decided to stop taking Topamax and treat the migraines daily instead.  I have taken many_ many drugs over the years to treat my migraines_ and have found Relpax to be the most helpful. (I take 40-80mg. when a migraine sets in.)  Although Topamax worked beautifully to control my migraines_ I simply could not function in my life or profession without my full cognitive abilities.  It was worth the try!",F,32,3  weeks,9/27/2009,Topamax

My neuro helped me to address some of them with the following tips...Take the medication at night with VITAMINS to minimize the hair loss and nutritional issues. I stopped the vitamins and I can tell you that the side effects came back full force. Multi-vit_ folic acid and potassium were suggested by my neuro and pharmacist. Try taking the medication in the pm versus the am. If your side effects are more severe right after taking the meds (like mine are) you will sleep through the worst of it and preserve your job/friends/family life. I started to sleep walk/talk_ slur my speech_ etc. That doesn't work well at the office. If your hands/feet tingle don't mow the lawn. Don't drink Diet Coke_ eat apples or purple jelly beans. Trust me on this. They are the only things that I can taste at all and they taste horrific now. About the weight loss? Tremendous. I shop in the teen section now - at the age of 40 (I'm at a size 2 and dropping). I eat_ but it's difficult when everything tastes like...nothing.

I have been on Topamax for 2 years when I first started I had the normal tingles but i had those before soem memory lose but I had those with the Migraines_ blurry vision had that to with the headaches BUT! in 2/09 I filled my script and when I got it home my pills looked wrong I called the pharmacy and was told that they filled it with a genric_ which never told them to but it was cheaper I was told same formula big deal... the doctor had changed my dosage so when I started to have issue's I thought it was because of that. it was not everytime I took this generic drug I was in fact making myself sick. I had intense pain_stomach spasms_ severe blurry vision_ migraines got worse_my heart would race to the point I thought it was going to jump out of my chest_ my hands started to swell_ the last straw came when i passed out and had to have 6 stitches in my knee. I talked to my doctor again and this time I told him I was not taking topamax anymore unless he wrote me another prescrition and made sure that it was not filled with generic.. I happened to be in that small percentage of people that can not take generic drugs. Generic drugs are not all the same. so please before you give up on Topamax look at it and make sure it is not generic.,F,42,2  years,9/23/2009,Topamax
632, 5, ,Tingling in my fingers for first few weeks. Loss of Weight. Eye Twitching. Diarrhoea.,Was on 150mg and migraines began to come back so increased to 175mg which I stayed on for about 6 months till the migraines appeared agan so I went to 200mg but this was when I began to experience severe eye twitching and diarrhoea.  As soon as I lowered the doseage back to 175mg_ the eye twitching stopped and so did the eye twitching and my migraines are very few and far between.  I think it is important therefore that a Doctor makes sure to prescribe this according to the weight of the patient as obviously 200mg was enough for a person much heavier than I was.  Although I have experienced side affects_ I would not stop taking Topamax as it has changed my life.  I used to get Migraines at least once a week and swallow numerous pain killers and now I might get a migraine about once every 9 months.,F,,3  years,9/18/2009,Topamax

Because my migraines werent going away...& they findout that apparantly it was working because i had accidently forgot to get the topamax from my mothers and missed taking it for 2 days and ended up with a 3 day migraine. NOTHING helped.Which apparently that meant my migraine needed the medicine from what she told me. Idk. I dont like blaming things but lately i have been Depressed_ I dont have friends anymore_ i havent had a normal bowel function (constipation)_Major mood swings_and im always angry_ Ive always been smart but now my class is getting harder for me_ ive fallen behind.

However_ Topamax has seemed to help an exordinate amount of people_ and the weight loss is the most alluring plus about it (as I've gained 50lbs since going on birth control).  Here are my questions: How bad is the cognitive dysfunction?  I'm in the Veterinary Medicine field_ incorrect spelling isn't much of an issue but not being able to calculate drug doses will be problematic.  Do the mental side effects wane over time as the body becomes adjusted to the medication?  Is the ""flightiness"" concentrated only on forgetfullness?

665, 1, Bipolar II,I had tingling in fingers and feet and face_ decreased taste and lost my ability to type. All of this was tolerable however it made my moods worse.,I went straight into a mianic episode_ and crashed into a depression. Even though I had been more depressed before in my life_ Topamax caused me to have suicidal ideation and action and my P-doc told me to stop taking it.  The thoughts were still there after stopping the drug so I ended up spending a week in the psych ward of the local hospital so that I could be monitored on a new medication.  I also have to continue with partial hospitalization for 5 to 10 days.  This drug did not work for me.  Don't put up with severe side effects like this_ they could be deadly. Talk to your doctor. There are many other drugs out there that can be just as effective. I am so far doing much better on my new medication.,F,35,10  days,7/1/2009,Topamax

Already I had experienced years of headache patterns following a serious car accident. Topamax worked--actually works--miraculously for me in SOME ways.  I have relief from headaches that have plagued me for twenty years_ specifically headache pain at the base of my skull_ tension headaches_ and occasional migraines that had recently come back at me after years of abatement.  Topamax relieved these within one week.  Initially I took 25mg morning and night but had to increase within 2 weeks to 25mg morning and 50 mg at night when the lower dosage would not hold back head pain.  I have been on this drug for 5 months and am committed to taking it--however_ the side effects are daunting.  I am a professor and I am now STUPID.  This is a professional liablility_ no doubt.  I have some difficulty keeping my place in conversation.  Additionally_ what others say about spelling is true--esp difficult for teachers who write on the board.  Worse than that_ I am already an extrovert_ and Topamax takes away some social inhibition.  I have said some things in social situations that astound me and later_ keep me up nights in fits of shame and remorse.  I am struggling now to keep my mouth shut-- a near impossibility.  Driving: at times I lose my visual ""map"".  But I'll tell you this--I will try to stay on Topamax; I panic when I think about going back to the head pain that I lived with.

667, 3, Headaches,Numbness and tingling of hands and arms_ memory and concentration loss_ weight loss_ kidney stones_ loss of sweating_ dilusions_ paranoia_ and fatigue,I have been on Topamax for about 2 years now. Like everyone else the hardest side effect to deal with is the stupidity I suffer from. Even carrying on the simplest of conversations is very difficult. Over time I began to suffer from some of the more extreme side effects that could become life threatening. To me it is worth it though. My doctors (primary and neurologist) tried many different meds to help elliminate my headaches with no success. I felt like I was dying. For years I suffered from migraine type headaches due to a in-operable brain cyst. The headaches would last weeks and most of the time only a few days in between episodes. That was if I got that much time between them. Sometimes it would only be a day in between them. Then my neurologist suggested Topamax. He explained the side effects very clearly to me and said that they could be very extreme. I was willing to give it a try. I could no longer bear the pain of the headaches any more. So here I am two years later I have only had 7 headaches since being put on the meds. Which is wonderful! To me the side effects no matter how severe are clearly worth it to me. If anyone suffered the kind of headaches I have_ then you would agree that the side effects are a small price to pay. However if you are taking the drug for another reason then I can understand that the side effects may not be worth your risk. You have to weight your own personal benefits verses the reasons for taking the medication. As for me every side ef,F,37,2  years,6/22/2009Email,Topamax

The memory_ vocabulary_ concentration_ focus_ loss of words and 'confusion' got so bad it became a real problem at work and the rest of my life. When I started forgetting how to get home_ the neuro doc took me off of it. Those problems decreased a bit_ but never entirely disappeared. After weening off the medicine_ the full-blown headaches/migraines returned (Topamax only moderately relieved pain). So now in addition to the pain in my head_ I have the lingering sides-effects to deal with. It cost me my job. I've been off Topamax for over a year and still have not regained control of my own thought processes. Among other things_ it's embarrassing because I feel stupid. I no longer understand about half of what I read_ have trouble following (and remembering) conversations_ habitually forget what I'm supposed to do/have done/am doing. Forget being able to follow a series of directions. I am afraid Topamax has caused permanent damage to my cognative brain functions and I have no idea what to do about it.

Learn to see the signs of an onset_ lest you make a complete fool of yourself in front of your coworkers like I have a couple of times.

The ""tingling"" happens if you do not drink enough water. Decrease appetite happens from too high a dose too fast and YOU WILL PUT THE WEIGHT BACK ON!!! AND MORE WHEN YOU COME OFF THE DRUG AND START TO EAT AGAIN! Take Vitamins. B's Zinc_ Biotin and digestive enzymes so your body will absorb them this will stop your hair from falling out_ and eat_ even if you are not hungry. This med effects your thyroid gland not monitoring it and starving yourself to stay thin you will pay the same price as someone who suffers from thyroid problems. After 3 years_ this drug took away a 20 yr hell I had with migraines_ but I respect the power any med has--especially one as powerful as this. Taking the vitamins is a must as the drug interferes with the absorption of nutrients which is the cause for many of your symptoms. You esp. need B12 to stay mentally healthy.

The naseau has pretty much gone away_ it was really only the 1st couple of weeks_ especially if I forgot to eat_ which would happen because I didn't have much of an appetite. Anyhow_ my husband and I just decided to try for our second baby so I'm going off of this med... which by the sound of it I probably should anyway with all these bad side effects.

I called the pain management pharmacist and told her about the thirst and she said she had never heard of that before.  The more severe symptoms I have just gotten the last couple of days since increasing to 50 mgs/day.  They are hot to get me off of the opiate painkillers I have been taking that do not cause side effects and do manage my pain and seem not to care about these side effects.  So it has been helpful reading everyone's input here.  I took only one tonight and am calling her on Monday with the entire list of symptoms and asking if they really want me to continue this.

Positives: Initially worked for mood stabalization and no more seasonal depression.  OCD lessened.  Negatives:  Constant word_ weight and hair loss.  Internal word repetition increased and rage with missed dosage.  Much worse than original moods.,This is a very powerful drug and I appreciated the help it offered at first.  I am moving to Tegeratol and Geodon at the advise of my psychiatrist and hope to find some relief.  Decreasing the dosage and weaning off has been a nightmare.  The 65 pound weight loss was not worth the hair loss_ low blood pressure_ arrhythmias_ kidney stone_ word loss_ uncontrollable rage_ suicidal thoughts etc.  There must be better drugs out there.

I do not pay attention to things like a should. The memory loss_ specifically short term can be funny but at the same time I hate to feel stupid and that is exactly how this drug makes you feel. A little bit dumb and a little bit dopey. I mean the weight loss is extremely significant_ you lose your appetite right away_ many things taste different or you just aren't hungry AT ALL!

790, 1, migraine headaches,Topamax was initially a life saving drug for me.  I suffered with cluster migraine headaches and was losing my job.  Started out taking 25 mg twice a day and ended taking max dosage 400mg daily.  I experienced tingling in my hands and feet_ ringing in my ears (that now won't go away)_ gastroentestinal problems_ lost 100lbs in one year_ forgetfulness_ inability to concentrate_ lightheaded_ sleeplessnes and so many other things!,I think this medication should be band from the market.  My life changed so dramatically.  It took me three months to wean off this medication. Ten months later and I have gained 50lbs_ ringing in ears continues_ circulation problems in legs and hands_ continued gastroinstestinal problems.  Now taking vitamin B-2 400mg daily and B-6 200mg daily.  Migraines dissapated but now I was recently diagnosed with chiari malformation.  Need help.,F,45,5  years,10/20/2008Email,Topamax

It seems to ""boost"" the effectiveness of my antidepressant (zoloft)_ as well as offset its weight gain side effect.  The yucky tasting soda is a blessing in disguise as I find myself drinking more water.  My headaches are very few and far between.

I recently was on a vegan diet for a few months but went off that thinking it was that.  It didn't seem to be the diet.  I went to my primary Dr who did bloodwork on me to rule out basic problems and there were none.  The only thing I could figure out was my medications.  I contacted my Dr who prescribed the Topamax and he reduced my dosage from 100mg to 50 immediately.,Topamax has worked well along with my anti-depressants for over 2 years.  My moods are stabilized and most of my not so harmful but annoying obsessions are in control!  Weight loss is an added benefit.  However_ the fogginess and loss of words makes me think that I am not 44 years old but more like 74!!!!  My husband has to help me remember names.  This shouldn't be the way to live.   I hope that by reducing this Topamax and eventually getting off I'll get rid of this double vision.....as Topamax may NOT be the cause.  If it's not_ then I'll have to look for answers else where.  I mean_ after 2 years_ how could I all of a sudden have double vision?  Email me if you have any ideas or help.,F,44,2  years,10/3/2008Email,Topamax

I have lost quite a bit of weight while on this medication but it was intentional. I knew weight loss was a potential side effect (benefit!) so I used it along with proper diet and exercise to lose the weight.  So_ it has been beneficial to me in more ways than one.  The only real side effects that I still really struggle with is the neurological issues such as losing my train of thought in mid conversation and the issue of decreased libido.  That has been very difficult on my marriage,F,39,8  years,8/17/2008Email,Topamax
826, 4, Chronic Migraines,slight tingling in feet_ metallic taste in mouth_ certain foods taste very metallic_ slight moodiness or feelings of sadness which is not typical for me,I am only taking 25 mg and have noticed a marked improvement in the number of headaches I get.  I was having an average of 7-8 migraines a month and last month I only had 2! That is worth the side effects so far.  Let's hope they stay minimal. My doctor sees me every 2 months to follow up with how I am doing so I am very comfortable about taking this medication. It is working.  I have had migraines for over 20 years and have tried every thing!  I am hopeful.,F,54,3  months,8/17/2008,Topamax

828, 5, Migraines & Epilepsy,Paresthesia_ Weight Loss_ Dizziness_ Difficulty with Memory_ Confusion,Completely changed my life for the better - has lessened migraine severity so much. I used to get severe migraines 3 or 4 times a week with vision loss and vomiting and paralysis and pain. Now i get them maybe once every 6 weeks like that. My seizures haven't been completely yet_ but my neurologist is still increasing the dosage of my epilim and topamax_ so that should be sorted out soon. Bottom line - if your migraines are severe enough_ the *completely reversible* side effects are totally worth it. Also i've lost about 95lbs while taking it. It made me not hungry.,F,34,8  months,8/6/2008Email,Topamax
829, 4, Migraines,Lethargy_ fall asleep in the mid afternoon_ have to take a nap. Tingling in extremities and taste changes early in course of treatment_ went away after a time. Used to have to force myself to eat. Still have a distaste for sweets & sodas_ although I never liked them much to begin with... The tingling and loss of appetite do pop back up if my dose is increased.I'm on 200mg a day now (100 in morning_ 100 at bedtime)_ couldn't stay awake on the 300mg that was recommended.,It did help a to decrease the severity and frequency of my migraines_ but I still get them_ on schedule_ every month with my period. They used to last 7 - 13 days at a severity level of 7 to 10 out of 10_ now they last 2 - 4 days_ with a severity of 3 - 5. Not perfect_ but better.,F,46,4  years,8/6/2008,Topamax
830, 4, Migraines,Tingling_ numbness_ perhaps a rash_ and weird taste in mouth.,This drug helped for migraines. One has to slowly increase the dose. I developed weird spots on my wrists_ etc. (lichen planus skin problem) and when I went off Topamax it went away. Since then_ I've only done *acupuncture* and I am having the best result in more than 20 years. I have acupuncture sessions every 2 1/2 weeks. I went from 3-6 migraines a month to virtually ZERO!,F,49,11  months,8/6/2008Email,Topamax
831, 4, migraines & sleepwalking,"short term memory loss or having words ""right on the tip of my tongue"" but not being able to think of the word.",Topomax has been very successful for me_ as it has allowed me to treat both my migraines and my sleep disorder with one drug.  I have kept a mirgaine log for a few years_ and I used to have 40-50 migraines a year and I only had 9 last year.  The only downside is having trouble getting out the right word a lot of time.  It is like my vocab is stuck.  Probably not a good drug for a child or someone still in school where they would struggle_ as I am always having to cover for it at work.  But the benefits for me_ are worth it.,F,36,2  years,8/6/2008,Topamax
832, 3, Migraine,Extreme fatigue_ cognitive problems_ slowed-down mental processes_ falling asleep while driving,I started Topamax in March and the effect was dramatic -- my daily headaches and migraines quickly vanished. My first side effects seemed benign -- we could all laugh when I said the wrong word_ and losing 2-3 pounds was actually nice. But after 3 months ... my headaches are creeping back. And now I am almost comatoseand sleepwalking through my days. I wake up tired and crawl to work and then crawl home. I feel like a zombie. For a while I thought maybe I had cancer or my heart was failing .... but now I suspect the tiredness may just be the Topamax. I am seeing the doctor next week and hopefully we'll sort it all out. In a way_ I hope it IS the Topamax and not something more serious.,F,56,100  days,7/31/2008,Topamax
833, 1, migraines,back pain_ eye pain_ hives for 3 months_ extreme loss in appetite_ confusion_ mood swings_ depression_ limb tingling,I was on this medication for 3 months_ i loved it at first my migraines went away and i was very happy but then about a month ago i stopped wanting to eat and i lost 10 pounds. My eyes hurt so bad i couldn't wear contacts_ my lower back has been killing me and i started getting angry at everyone then crying for no reason. I couldn't remember simple things and got confused really easy. My legs and arms fall asleep all the time. So i just stopped taking this medication. The side effects did out weight the benefits_ although my migraine have come back i couldn't go another day feeling the way i did on topamax.,F,24,3  months,7/31/2008,Topamax
834, 5, Chronic Migraines,Initially: Weightloss_ all carbonated beverages tasted flat_ mental fogginess_ fatigueCurrent: Tingling in my feet_ very picky eating habits (I eat like a toddler)_ and beer still tastes bad,I take 200mg at night.  I can't take it in the morning_ as I am not a morning person to begin with_ and I have start teaching at 7:45 each day. If I took it in the am_ I'd probably forget where my classroom was located and that I was a science teacher.  So_ I take it at night_ and it has worked wonders for me.  I can deal with the tingling in my feet_ and I've only drank about 3 beers in the past year...in exchange_ I've had about half the migraines.  This drug is not for everyone_ though.  It has a number of potential side effects_ and you need to be in close contact with your doctor should a problem arise.,F,26,1  years,7/29/2008Email,Topamax
835, 5, Migraines,Loss of concentration_ appetite/weight loss_ numbness in extremities_ difficulty breathing,I was getting 2-3 migraines per week prior to taking topamax_ and while the side effects are difficult to deal with_ I truly feel as if they are worth it.  I take 25 mg twice a day_ and as I do this_ it tends to cut down on the numbness I was having when taking 50mg 1x per day. I was having some problems with anxiety/breathlessness_ but my md helped reduce that by adding an anti-anxiety med twice a day.,F,22,1  years,7/27/2008,Topamax
836, 4, Bipolar II,Okay everyone_ let's try to remember that everyone taking this medication is taking it for different reasons :) We all have to remember this also...everyone who is taking it...is NOT going to have the EXACT same effects as everyone else.  The warnings that are put on the labels are just that...warnings.  My niece_ who is a medical assistant_ taught me that they take so many people and they test these people to see how many of them have so many side effects and how many don't (she works in a doctor's office who actually does this) and that's the warnings they put on the box.  They don't take every single person in the US and Canada and put their input on these boxes.  So_ with that said...so and so may have severe weight loss_ where Jane Doe may have none at all.  John Doe may have horrible headaches where Jane may have none.  For instance_ right now_ I'm at 100 mg/day and will be going on 200/day tomorrow.  I've been on this medication last year as well.  I went off of it last year bec,"I do feel hot flashes (could be my pre-menopause though...I'm 41 and was diagnosed last year with it).  I've had a sore throat for 3 days now (could be the weather change here).  But I have had severe drowsiness and I know that's from taking my XANAX and the Topamax together because my pharmacist warned me about that.  And I've also had the kind of ""dizziness"" feeling and ""banging"" into walls occasionally like I'm drunk lol.  And definitely the ""forgetting words"" business.  First time that happened to me last year_ I freaked.  Now I just laugh about it. :)",F,41,7  days,7/24/2008Email,Topamax

But my mom was taking it too and told me to take my celexa. celexa is the cousin to lexapro. If you have either I am sure it will work! it worked a miracle for me.

838, 4, migraines,tingling_ confusion_ forgetfullness_ loss of apetite_ change of taste,I cannot believe people who take this drug (or any other for that matter) for 1-3 months or even a few weeks only and claim they went off of it due to side effects. These drugs do have side effects whether we like it or not. And it takes time for them to go away - anywhere from few weeks to few months. Anyone who is sick enough will pull through these few months to see if the drug helps. It took me over 3 months to stop being confused and disoriented. I had to make myself eat. But after that everything went back to normal and I saw the drug actually helps. I've been on for 3 years now and still helps. Just be strong and continue on - the side effects will go away but it will take more than just a few days.,F,28,3  years,7/23/2008,Topamax

I've never experienced more frequent_ painful migraines than on this drug. Plus it did not help the bulimia at all. If anything_ it got worse and I gained a lot of weight from this. I also got the tingles and some nights I couldn't sleep. Occassionally_ I would get a panic attack. I also felt as though Topamax dulled me out a lot. I wasn't able to think as sharply.

Kind of strange_ but they didn't start until I had been on the medication for about 3 weeks.

When my neurologist increased my dosage from 150mg to 250mg a day I became very angry all the time.

You really have to make yourself eat. Some people say you have to be on a higher dose to lose weight but that's really not true. I think it's just because you lose your taste for everything.

I've since heard it described by some users as Stup-A-Max due to it's ability to allow your brain to shut down mid-sentence leaving you hanging for your next word or thought. This does happen often.  However_ in my case it has helped tremendously with the depression.  A year ago I was in a place emotionally I hope to never go back to_ and although I had tried many other anti-depressants over several years_ none seemed to be helping any longer.  My doctor prescribed the Topamax in conjunction with Wellbutrin and that has been doing wonders for my mental health and well being.

868, 3, complex migraines,Severe muscle pain_ kidney stones_ weight loss_ mood swings_ taste change.,Topamax does work for preventing migraines as long as you can handle the side effects. I have been tested for every kind of joint_ muscle_ nerve_ bone and connective tissue disease and they all have been normal. (thank god) As soon as I stopped taking topamax within 2 days my pain was greatly reduced. Hopefully tomorrow will be even better. As for the kidney stones_ I have had two in three years. They are extremely painful! Worst then giving birth. Tomorrow will be my third day without topamax and I'm happier with no mood swings and if a migrain returns my doctor and I are going to go down a different route. Good Luck.,F,36,3  days,6/20/2008,Topamax
869, 4, migraines,Severe hair loss tingling in feet and toes,I started on a low dose of topamax_ in March my MD increased my doseage and that is when I began experiencing SEVERE hair loss. I stopped the medication. I recently saw a dermatologist and he said it would take 6 months (due to metabolic reasons and the hair growth cycle) for my hair to start growing again. This is devistating since my hair is waist length. He did say women's rogaine would help.,F,35,5  days,6/19/2008,Topamax

872, 5, migraines,The main side effect I have experienced so far is the tingling in my fingers and in the heels of my feet_ mostly in the mornings.  The taste of soda has changed a great deal and I have lost a lot of my appetite.  I do think that I have had some more trouble concentrating and have had some memory loss however I'm not sure if it's been a tremendous amount or not.  I've also experienced the word recall problem but again_ I suffered from that issue prior to the medication so I can't attribute this entirely to the Topamax.,Overall I am very pleased with this medication.  I have suffered from migraines for many years now without much success from preventative medications.  I am still getting migraines occasionally however am only on 100 mg a day and have been on it for less than 2 months so I may need to have my dosage increased.,F,31,35  days,6/3/2008Email,Topamax

After suffering for about 19 yrs. with debilitating cluster migraines which lasted for weeks at a time_ and trying almost every drug that was prescribable during these years_ also suffering horrible side effects_ Topamax is the only drug that really took my headaches away. The side effects that I suffer almost daily are nothing compared to the pain of the migraines that I had. I started with 25mg twice a day and moved up to 50mg twice a day. When I start to feel really fatigued_ get blurred vision or have the memory loss_ I just stop for a day or two and I'm fine. But you'd better bet that I go right back on my Topamax! Once I went out of town and left my prescription at home_ so I missed my pills for about 5 days_ and my migraines came back in full force. I had to take Prednisone for a few weeks_ and Relpax with Naproxen for a couple days until the Topamax got into my system again. I felt like crap! I do not miss my doses unless my sides effects get too heavy.,F,43,1  years,5/31/2008,Topamax

It's helped me maintain stability through some very rough times_ where previously I would have been a complete mess. I've taken it at a very low dose because I'm really sensitive to medications. However_ over time I've realized just how dopey I've been and that I need to reduce my dosage or stop taking the drug altogether in order to not be walking around like a zombie.,F,42,21  months,5/29/2008,Topamax

Never start higher then 25mg.  The side effects will be horrible.  After taking it for a month the side effects should begin to taper off. But you've got deal with some of the side effects until your body gets adjusted to them. Some will some won't.  You don't know until you try it.

I took it initially for a couple years and noticed all of the ""scary"" side effects right away. However_ it did work for chronic migraines. Other forms of treatment weren't as successful as I have severe drug allergies to other medications...so T. seemed like a good alternative...though the eye problems concerned me the most at the time. I stopped the medication for a little over a year and the side effects (all of them) seemingly went away. However_ I recently went back on T. and yup...all the side effects are back full blown and just as intense if not worse. Of course_ it is also working again for the migraines (which attack 3-5/week easily) if untreated. So....somewhat of a Catch 22 ...but I am always scared about it...and hope that T. doesn't leave me in a permanently worse off state of being down the road.

Weight gain and lethargy have plagued me for years on top of the treated bi-polar/depression which is why I have decided to try out topamax.

I am taking no other medications so this problem can only be attributed to Topamax.,Has anyone else experienced this?,F,49,2  months,3/25/2008,Topamax

I was only on 25mg daily too_ and after about two months_ i began to feel like i was losing short term memory abilities_ specifically the inability to retrieve memories_ names_ things i needed to remember for SCHOOL_ etc. the drug worked for about a month; i had no headaches for a month (before i had about 4 a week); i didn't have the memory loss. then boom_ it started happening. i felt stupid and frustrated. I'm not saying this drug is bad...everyone has different experiences_ on different dosages. it worked_ for me_ and you should try it if suggested by your doctor_ because it may just work.,,19,2  months,3/25/2008,Topamax

Now they recur when taking different over the counter meds and they stop when I stop the medication.  Possibly slowed mental function but mind moved so fast it is a not noticeable non issue.,This medication has given me my life back.  The world caused me pain on a daily basis for more than 15 years.  All of the other medications and I have been prescribed meds in every category caused all of the symptoms listed by everyone on this site and only muted the pain that was caused by my headaches.  Before telling anyone to NEVER take a medication one should think of how that medication could help another person.  This is the only med of over 50 that has brought normalcy to my life.   Other meds left me dopey_ tired and stupid.  In one case addicted to narcotics.,M,40,2  years,3/17/2008,Topamax

The doctor warned me about drowsiness but that hasn't been a problem. I purposefully didn't read about other side effects before taking the drug and honestly don't think I've experienced anything else. Unfortunately_ this so far includes the weight loss.,I started at 25mg 1x/day for a week and have been taking 50mg 2x/wk for the past 3 weeks. I also take 200mg of Lamictal_ a drug which can interfere with weight loss. My doc prescribed Tmax when diet & exercise did nothing to budge the baby weight.

On 50mg per day I was experiencing migraines 2-3x week. SCARY thing- I missed a day or two of DOPaMax and had a focal seizure. That's right folks_ missing a dose or weaning too quickly can induce seizures! The answer was to INCREASE MY DOSE. Titrated rather quickly up to 200 mg in 20 days. Still getting migraines_ although they are reduced in intensity and duration. Weight loss? not that I can see...I am always thirsty.....I was a bulimic (as an aside) but I must say since starting this drug I have NO desire to purge...so i will stick with it for my health....,M,34,4  months,3/5/2008,Topamax

921, 4, Migraines,Tingling fingers_ decreased appetite at first_ and then a strange appetite_ some memory loss_ irritable_ drowsiness.,After about 3 years of constant and almost daily debilitating migraines and bi-weekly visits to a chiropractor_ I was pointed to the direction of a neurologist. She suggested I try out Topamax and advised me to start out with 25 mg and then move up to 50 mg a day. Almost immediately_ my migraines have stopped. I now get them very infrequently and I suppose the side effects are totaly worth it because it is so annoying to have a migraine every single day of your life_ from the moment you wake. The first week_ I wasn't hungry at all it seemed and then my appetite came back. Sometimes I feel really hungry now but sometimes I feel I cannot eat. It hasn't effected my weight_ though. I am pretty slender though. It does make me drowsy soon after I take it so I take it at night. I do find that I am pretty irritable_ though_ like I have some minor mood swings.

After the first year we did have to increase the dose from 100 mg to 200 mg because it felt like it wasn't working as well_ but it's working now.

The benefits far out weight the side effects. I suffered from severe migraine headaches and if you truly suffered from these headaches_ almost ANYTHING is better than the headache!  I was on Topamax once before and it was causing me to lose too much weight so a former doctor took me off of it and put me on another prevenative.  Within a week I was having my headaches again. (I was 6 months w/o one (amount of time I was on it before))  I begged to be put back on it.  I went to a new doctor and he agreed to put me back on Topamax and gave me Amatriptaline in a small doseage to counteract the weight loss side effect.

The only thing better would have been weight loss...but I didn't have any.  oh well.,F,50,12  days,1/8/2008Email,Topamax

When I was taking 75mg all at once in the evening...the next morning I would wake up with pins and needles in my hands and feet. Once my dose was adjusted again_ this went away. Topamax has changed my life. I went from having a constant daily migraine to only having one every several months_ and it's always triggered by something I can't control (usually weather).

I had to stop taking it because of the spaciness but will resume when there are less mental demands (Im a college student).,"This medication (250mg/day) worked wonders for the bulimia_ although the cognitive side effects are pretty intolerable. I tried to take the dose all at night but found it was not longer effective (bulimia comes back)_ so I think blood levels have to stay pretty constant (it has a short half life) to be effective for appetite control. I am off of it right now...feel very bright but am binging and purging up to twice a day. As an aside_ I found it helped stabilize my mood. Ive been on antidepressants which seem to deaden the emotions...this doesnt but helped with mood swings and depression.

The insurance company would not pay for Topamax but they would for Lithium. Well_ I did a some research_ and when I heard Topamax can help you lose weight_ I did a happy dance!  I have tried 15 other meds over the last 10 yrs. and am up to 235lbs. Over the last year_ the weight gain has made me suicidal.  It may sound shallow but we live in a horribly visual society that has unrealistic weight goals set for women.  I got so sick of the disgusted looks and the snicking that I got out in public that I have become a recluse_ now I only go out when absolutely necessary.  Anyways_ I started at 25mg a week ago and that was ok_ of course the first night was hard.  My anxiety is all health related_(every ache or pain is impending death) I have bad panic attacks and used to drink to keep them at bay so I had my husband stay up late to check on me.

When I get migraines_ they start with blind spots_ in one eye (TERRIBLE pain)_ then my head feels like it is ready to explode_ then comes nausea_ etc. At my insistence_ I had an MRI which revealed that I had six small white spots on my brain (equivalent to small mini strokes)which was a big surprise to both me & my doctor. Fortunately there has been no previous/permanent damage done to my brain. Doctor said that I will be on Topaxma for the rest of my life. That is fine with me. A friend of mine became permanently blind in one eye after she had a migraine. Of course_ I would not want to take that chance of becoming permanently blind_ since I do get the blind spots and the intense pain with my migraines and also the possibility that one more migraine could h,F,52,3  months,12/30/2007,Topamax

I took 100 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening (gradually increased by 25 mg a week over eight weeks). I did not have any seizures while on Topamax but had to discontinue it because of the side effects. (1) I had excruciatingly painful muscle cramps in my legs_ although those gradually faded as the dose increased. (2) I had mild tingling in my extremities and moderate tremors in my hands_ both intermittent. (3) I had to stop drinking carbonated beverages_ as all of them they tasted indescribably bad. (4) Occasionally moving objects would leave a visual trail_ especially when moving from darkness into light. (5) Once the dose reached 150mg_ I started itching from head to foot.

I have been taking 25mg at night for about two weeks now_ Ive been taking it for dizziness_ and acephalic migraines. I think it has helped with the dizziness_ BUT the side effects just arent worth it. My body cant afford the weight loss_ plus I love to eat and nothing sounds good anymore.  It has also made thinking almost impossible. Its so hard to concentrate_ spell_ or think of and use words correctly. Im usually a really calm_  laid back person but topamax makes me so restless I cant stay still whatsoever_ and when I do get to sleep Ill wake up tapping my foot. I also get awful bone chills that make me shake for a good 10 minutes. If I sit in one spot for a short amount of time and then move my joints will hurt_ which isnt normal for me.

This drug is CRAZY!,I took this medication for Epilepsy and holy crap this medication is one hell of a drug..and not really in a good way. The ONLY good thing about this medication was that I lost 30 pounds...but i lost it too fast in only a month in a half (though i worked out vigorously as well). Granted_ it WAS my 'genius plan' to switch my seizure meds to the one that would make me lose weight but...not at the expense of my sanity! I was SO sensitive to this medication at even 25 mg it was insane. Rage_ annoyance_ crying spells_ depression...i was a MESS.

I've been on and off it for a year because within a week of taking it I would have small breakouts on my face_ which would get progressively worse until after about 16 weeks I would develop a red_ itchy rash. The second time I was on it_ I had to go on antibiotics to get rid of the rash on my face_ which was irritated by heat and radiation.

Once I began the higher dose of Topamax_ I began itching in the back of my scalp area.  Sometimes it would be on my stomach_ my sides_ my arms or legs and now on my lower back_ but for the most part_ it's remained in the back of my scalp.  For 3 months_ I have gone through every shampoo_ conditioner_ over the counter product out there to treat what I thought was sceriosis.  A week ago_ it dawned on me that it could be this drug.  After speaking to the nurse and going to our local drugstore_ our pharmacist was able to determine that it was in fact Topamax causing this adverse reaction to my nerve endings.

I take 50mg of Topamax in the morning and 100mg at night and while the morning dose did at first cause drowsiness_ that seems to have lessened with time.  It is quite difficult_ however_ to know exactly which side effect is being caused by which drug and/or is being effected by each new drug added_ when the cocktail keeps changing.

As soon as somebody says something I have no idea what it just was sometimes.  Pins and needles are quite bad in the feet from the Topamax so I'm really hoping that goes.  The main reason_ I believe_ the pain clinic doc decided to switch me over was the weight gain from the Gabapentin which seemed to really bother him more than me_ though I certainly was less than thrilled_ but he seemed like one of those docs_ and to that end I seem to have very little desire to eat anymore.

1029, 3, Severe Migraines,Tingling in Face_ Hands_ Feet_ Confusion_ Forgetfullness_ Irritability_ Brain-fog_ Fatique_ Constant Metallic-taste_ some weight loss (15 lbs_ over 4 months).,After titrating up_ I was convinced that this was a miracle drug!  I have had severe migraine headaches since age 14.  The only relief has come in recent years with Imitrex_ but now my Dr. says I'm using too much.  I was getting 4-5 migrains a week before starting on Topamax.  After the first two weeks_ my migraines had almost disappeared.  After a few months_ though_ they began to come back and so began the upping of dosages - which also increased all the side-effects.  Most notably_ the brain-fog and irritability.  My co-workers say I'm not the same person to work with and I know that my husband and kids see the difference.  After 4 months_ 15 pounds less (yeah!) and back to having daily migraines_ I can't face increasing the dose any higher.  I'm at 200mg/day_ and I can't take the side effects.  There's got to be something better out there.,F,38,4  months,9/20/2007,Topamax
1030, 5, migraines,loss of sex drive and after two years_ hair loss,I have been off it for a year now and while my hair has come back fine_ my migraines are back with a vengence.  I have discussed this with a neurologist and they have indicated that these side effects are rare and that I was on a high dose 175mg daily.  I am willingly to try it again.  She has told me that I probably will not experience the same side effects.,F,42,2  years,9/16/2007,Topamax
1031, 1, migraines,severe chest pains with extreme thirst and losing consciousness_ heavy trembling_ multiple times.  Persistent chest pain for weeks with dizziness_ exhaustion_ slight confusion_ loss for words. After two weeks_ burning itching around my abdomen.,There were several times when I felt I was seriously going to die during these fits that feel like a possible heart attack. The blood tests and EKG's look alright.  Twice earlier in the past 10 years I was prescribed this drug with a resulting 911 call with similar symptoms.  The doctors did not make the connection with the Topamax in those cases at that time.  The inference is these symptoms are a nervous reaction.  In each case_ I have gone into similar distress within hours or days of being prescribed this drug.  I will never take it again.  I look forward to a full recovery.  I am surprised how long the reaction is lasting.,F,45,1  days,9/16/2007,Topamax

Weight loss (60 pounds since 2003).  Decreased migraine.  Increased thirst_ decreased restroom breaks.  Overheat easily.,Topamax has been a lifesaver for me.  It has a number of side effects that I've learned to deal with.  They are by far better than have the number of seizures and migraines I was having on a daily and weekly basis.  Now I have seizures about once a year_ it almost seems seasonal.  I currently take 300mg_ 200 in the am and 100 in the pm_ with several other medications for other things.  If people are finding other things are not working out for them then it is a medication I would suggest they talk with their dr about_ but I'd let them know the side effects you first go through aren't a picnic and take an adjustment.,F,27,4  years,9/14/2007Email,Topamax

I haven't had any appetite suppression which I am dissappointed about but so glad to finally be broken free of my addiction.  I honestly never thought I would quit drinking.  This is a miracle drug for me.  I do have to take it in the am or I can't sleep at night but other then that no real bothersome side effects.

Now my hair is falling out in bunches and I've decided with all of the other side effects_ this is just unacceptable. I really have no idea whether it helped my depression because I take two other meds. I guess if I stop taking it and ""crash"" then I'll reevaluate. This summer I had a bad mouth infection and am wondering whether my low blood cell count prevented 3 different kinds of antibiotics from knocking it out. Eventually_ the oral surgeon just had to dig out the infection from the bone and pull one of my teeth. Not sure if I'd recommend Topamax for depression  -- perhaps if you've tried everything else through the years (like I have) and you still feel like crap all of the time.",F,36,11  months,9/9/2007,Topamax

I tried three other drugs before this_ all horrible- Depakote is the worst drug ever_ and was at my wits end but I feel like I can live a normal happy life again.,I know two other people on the drug. They both took it for migraines.  One had to stop the other is still on it. They both had substantial weight loss. The person who no longer takes it had tingling all the time and facial ticks.

I am the opposite of most people_ the topa keeps me from sleeping at night. if i take any of my 100 mg past 8am_ i will be up all night unable to sleep. it is the same with my pain meds which wire me instead of knocking me on my butt like they do most other people. also a word of caution: never go off topa cold turkey! i had to one time because i ran out (could not afford refill) and went without for a couple months. i became seriously suicidal and had it all planned out. even had written my own obituary. obviously i got my next bottle in time_ i'm still here.,F,35,2  years,9/7/2007Email,Topamax

Was a TRAIN WRECK if I forgot a dose (not good if one of the side effects is memory loss). Did really well for (6) months and decided w/ my neuro to go off of it. Decreased doses @ 25mg/week and was an emotional basket-case. Upped them on my own to 50mg to get off them quickly and didn't experience any of the adverse side effects of increasing by 50mg/week. I've been off it for about 2 months now_ and the migraines are back. I've been taking supplements (B2_ Riboflavin & Co-Enzyme Q10)_ but they're not working.

But it only lasted about three weeks. Then the daily headaches started coming back. The doctor has increased the dose_ (I'm up now to 125 mg) and I can't handle the side effects. Not only the memory_ word loss_ etc._ but whenever I go on increased amounts_ I experience increased body temperature_ shortness of breath_ and it feels as though my head--mouth_face_ teeth_gums_ all have an infection as a result of too much of this stuff.

I'd miss days from work_ days from my life . . . with Topomax_ I've had maybe 2 headaches in 6 months_ where I used to have one every week or 2.  This is my miracle drug.  It's a lifesaver.

Topamax has helped decrease the frequency and possibly the severity of the attacks.  The side effects are significant as my husband says I seem to have lost my self confidence with my short term memory.

I have had problems with bipolar disorder in the past so I have noticed an improvement in my mood so that is positive. I am seeing my neurologist in a couple days and perhaps another anticonvulsant may work better for me.

For four months I just layed in bed in pain and couldn't consume anything but water & even that would go right through me. I have been blaming the sight problems on age_ but sounds to me like it may have been just another symptom to blame on the Topomax. Yep_ lost A LOT of weight_ but way too fast.

I started taking 25mgs a day_ then 25mgs 2xs a day_ then 25mgs in the morning and 50mgs at night and now i am at 50mgs twice daily.,F,18,1  months,7/31/2007,Topamax

The combination of the two has had an amazing result in my mood.  I'm much more stable and (apart from the side effects) would recommend the two meds for anyone with this disorder.,F,23,5  years,7/31/2007,Topamax

Possibly considering going off the medication and JUST using those two since I have so many side effects still.,F,24,11  months,7/29/2007Email,Topamax
1069, 4, migraines,Since starting topamax i havent had the first migraine_ the only side effects i seem to be having is soda tastes like crap_ my tongue seems to be covered in small blister looking things way on the back of it.  I started at 25 mg for 1 week then 50 mg on day 8_ i am on day 11 now.

I started on 25mg and am now on 200mg a day. It has stopped my seizures completely but the side effects can be completely mind numbing sometimes. It's hard to make it through the day sometimes. I've complained about the side effects multiple times to my doctor_ asking them to switch the dosage to a higher amount at night so I can go through the day not feeling like a zombie w/no reply.,F,22,6  years,7/25/2007,Topamax

I started with 25 mg_ increased by 25 mg a week until I got to 100 mg a week and have been holding at that dose for 2 months.  I don't want to increase dose and may discuss reducing as long as migraine  symptoms don't come back.

For the first three weeks I felt agitated (like my mind was moving too quickly for my body)_ and I constantly found it hard to think of words and was having trouble remembering things short-term_ which made it very difficult to carry on a conversation. However_ for the past year I have been dealing with an extreme ""pins and needles"" feeling in my hands and feet_ taste change (carbonated beverages have a metallic taste)_ and fatigue. I would have dealt with those side effects - they were better that two debilitating migraines a week. However_ in the past four months I have also felt constant nausea and have had diarrhea and a kidney stone. In the time that I've been on this medication my migraines have been reduced from two a week to about one a month (an amazing change)_ but I'm switching to another preventative_ I can't deal with the side effects",F,20,1  years,7/23/2007,Topamax
1074, 4, migraine prevention,tiredness_ bloating_ decreased appetite_ carbonated drinks taste horrible,the tiredness became less problematic when changed meds to PM; I was wondering if anyone else was having the bloating problem? It seems strange_ since appetite has decreased. Dr has prescribed a diuretic for every 3 days_ and I drop 5 pounds_ which shows how much I'm retaining. As for the drinks_ with all the kidney problems this med can cause_ I guess we should all be drinking plenty of water_ anyway! I tried Topamax a year ago at a higher starting dose and hated it (quit after 3 weeks)_ but this time_ we have started very slowly and gradually_ and I've gone from 15 headaches in June to only one so far in July (I can't even remember a month like this-I average 12 a month).,F,51,5  days,7/18/2007,Topamax
1075, 3, migraine/bipolar (rapid),Well_ I think my dr is a moron.  he started me on 400mg split 200 twice a day. no ramp up at all.  within 30 min both my arms and legs were pins and needles and for the first 2 days i basically felt like i was in a constant state of drunkenness.  he's the professional_ right?  the biggest problem i had was i was experiencing extreme muscular fatigue.  climbing 2 flights of stairs killed me.  looked it up and realized it was metabolic acidosis (low blood pH) very dangerous.  called and he lowered it to 200 a day.  now i get the tingles and the only other side effect which is KILLING me is when i go outside into the heat i get the worst itching all over.  feels like poison ivy or something.  hope that goes away soon.  oh yeah_ beer and soda taste awful now.,only been on a week_ but haven't had a migraine since.  can't really say if it helps with the bipolar yet either.,M,35,1  weeks,7/18/2007Email,Topamax

Getting worse as time goes on.  Nearly gave my mother a nervous breakdown_ because I was normally a happy_ trustworthy person.  I became the total opposite.  I wasn't even sure who I was. I've started weaning myself off.  The drug only reduced the severity of my head pain_ but has not taken it away.  I'll put up with the daily head pain and occassional seizures.

Then one morning_ I woke up and was totally blind out of my left eye.  It lasted for 8 minutes.  It happened again a few days later.  My doctor told me it couldn't be from the topamax and sent me to a neurological opthomologist.  He told me topamax was notorious for vision problems and that if I didn't stop taking it_ I could go permanently blind.  It took a good two months for my vision to get back to normal after I quit taking it.  And it did nothing for the nerve pain either.,F,45,3  months,7/18/2007,Topamax

My migraines are mostly hormonal (right temple) and weather/mood-related (left eye).  I typically get a migraine the week before my period_ sometimes the day of_ and almost always after.  If I get anything other than that it is due to a trigger_ stress_ or something else.  I am in the process of titrating off Topamax so that I can try to get pregnant and start my family.  I had the same if not better results on Amitriptyline (except for the weight gain).  I began taking 25 mg a week and settled at 100 mg.  My doctor said if I wasn't seeing a change at 100 mg that I should titrate off anyway.  If Topamax works for you_ I'm very happy for you.  I am hoping that by cutting out MSG_ artificial sweetners_ and caffeine in order to conceive_ I will control my migraines.

Negative effect on job performance_ felt like neanderthal version of my former self. After discussion with neurologist_ I weaned off Topamax very very slowly and most side effects ended afterwards. I recently developed kidney infection - then kidney stones four months after ending Topamax.After trying multiple symptomatics (including Imitrex_ Midrin_ Relpax) to control migraines_ started Topamax as migraine preventative and went from 25mg to 150mg slowly. All side effects AND MIGRAINES escalated as Topamax dose increased - and I was afraid to take it but too afraid to not take it. Finally weaned off and now I'm controlling migraines through lifestyle as much as possible.,Topamax was so scary that I don't want to take migraine meds again. Migraines were so bad I begged neurologist for a preventative - and he prescribed Topamax. After experiencing awful side effects with each symptomatic_ then this preventative - I'm done! Even though migraines are still frequent_ I try to both control what I can through lifestyle (healthy diet_ mild exercise_ yoga_ rest) and accept the rest on a day-to-day basis. I still get 2+ migraines per week but my quality of life_ both short and long term_ is better without migraine meds.

I still have a couple every month but am content to handle those with Imitrex and Motrin. The tingling and numbness was very noticable in the beginning. It would come and go_ but each instance would last less than one minute-not bothersome to me. I don't encounter that side effect much anymore. As for a change in appetite... I noticed a change in taste within the first week. I now prefer my food more on the bland side; I have consumed 12 oz. of Dr. Pepper daily for years_ but now it doesn't taste as good. I didn't notice a decrease in appetite until I had been taking it for about 3 months. I have been using antacids more frequently (I rarely used them in the past). All in all_ I will continue to take this med as long as it keeps the migraines away. Life is MUCH better now.,F,41,4  months,6/30/2007,Topamax

1090, 4, migraine prevention,sleepiness and tingling in feet which went away after a couple weeks.  Lack of appetite which resulted in 20 lb weight loss.,used a pill splitter to go up 12.5 mg a day rather than 25 mg.  After 2 months at 100 mg/day my chronic daily headache plus weekly migraine is gone.  It was worth titrating up slowly and putting up with side effects for a time.  Also suffer from PTSD.  On 20 mg Prozac for years which has helped but Topamax surprised me.  It seems to prevent dissociated states/triggering from stress.  I had none of the cognitive side effects and flattened personality reported here.  In fact I experience clearer thinking and brighter mood. Back down to 25 mg a day since I don't like taking drugs_ this holds off the migraines and is a mood stabilizer for me.,F,47,10  months,6/23/2007Email,Topamax

1092, 3, Mixed state bipolar disorder,Facial tingling_ tingling in toes (nothing major - just felt like they fell asleep) perhaps a slight decrease in appetite and minor weight loss.  It could be coincidental that I lost weight last week (4 lbs)but I was making more of an effort to watch what I was eating (on Weight Watchers)and was deliberating drinking more water.  I can't give this medicine a great rating or a poor rating either way because I haven't been on it long enough to see definitive results.  I'll post again when I know it's truly working.,"Ironically_ I was on Lamictal last month and was one of the ""lucky"" ones that gets the horrible flu-like symptoms and rash and had to discontinue use after only 12 days.  I have become sick this week with the same type of symptoms and am waiting to see if I am going to break out into a rash since it is possible with this med_ too_ since this is also an anti-convulsant_ or if I am legitimately sick with bad summer cold/allergies.  It's too early to tell if the meds are doing anything for me.  I'm still losing my temper with the drop of a hat_ but I just started 50mg 2x a day yesterday (had been on 25mg 2x a day for a week).  I think I might need a much_ much higher therapeutic dose to really see some stabilizing effects.  And I don't think monotherapy is going to cut it - but just what drug will we partner with?

That has been_ by far_ my worst side effect. I have been a bit more drowsy_ but that has forced me to get the eight hours of sleep a night I should be getting anyway_ so I can't complain. One other odd side effect is that I'm having extremely vivid dreams. I've never been one of those people who remembers dreams and now_ almost every morning since my dosage has been 100 mg per day_ I wake up and remember two or three dreams from the night before.

I didn't feel too many side effects until I increased the dosage. This week I have been doing the 100 mg_ I am feeling the side effects full force. On the up side my migraines aren't as agonizing as they usually are_ I can actually function - unlike before. I have been on topamax about a month now and I am hoping once my body gets used to the meds I'll be more comfy using them. The other thing I found interesting is that my dreams are a lot more vivid now_ I used to not even be able to remember them before! Now I'm hoping that the weight loss thing that seems to be going on for everyone else eventually kicks in for me too!,F,31,25  days,5/31/2007,Topamax

I would insert different words for words or different word endings on words or leave off endings when reading. WEIRD. Sometimes get lost while driving to work_ put things in wrong places_ etc...,I have been on T-max for a year and a half_ off and on. IT DEFINITELY HELPS MY SEVERE MIGRAINES. I get them so bad that I get sick_ can't see_ can't smell_am sick for at least 24 hours....The trick is to take the MINIMUM dose as possible. I was acting like I had no brain at a mere 100 mgs daily and am now on 50 mgs and am much better. Still some confusion_ definitely_ but I can't live with the constant threat of migraines or I would have no life. If you have any questions_ email me. I have probably been thru what you are going thru. I even went and had an MRI on my brain to make sure I wasn't crazy!That is how bad T-max can mess with your brain!,F,35,1  years,5/25/2007Email,Topamax
1113, 3, Migraine,Tingling in hands and feet.  Some taste change (soda) that went away after a few months.  Some brain fogginess and fatigue with dosage changes.,Have taken 75 mg a day (along with 160 mg/day of Propanonol (beta blocker)).  Was quite effective for a number of months_ then started getting headaches/dizziness/nausea again that would grab a hold of me for 2-3 weeks at a time. Also may have left me vulnerable to anxiety problems during these times of stress -- although I cannot say for sure that Topamax was at the root of this since I had been able to take it for a long time with no anxiety.  With the return of headaches recently my neurologist has recommended that I move up to 100 and possibly 150 mg a day.  So I have just added the extra 25 mg for the last couple days and am feeling some of the tingling/taste/fog return.  Hoping my body adjust.

I got them on top of my severe 24/7_ 27 year muscle tension headache_ first E.R trip last week_ given shot of morphine_ it only took the edge off_ told it was a large dose.  been recently put on propranolol for anxiety_ also completely eliminating my migraines(yessssss) now on to my other headache(sleeves rolled up and grrrrrrr),M,50,5  weeks,5/24/2007Email,Topamax
1116, 3, Migraines,First time I took topomax had terrible side effects - felt as if bugs were crawling all over my body.  Immediately went off it!  Went to another MD_ and after many other drugs tried titrating it slowly.  I am now up to 90mg daily along with 150 mg effexor.  Side effects include terrible thirst_ major cognitive impairments (loss of words_ cloudiness_ stupor)_ constipation_ severe hair loss_ fatigue (but had this prior_ so I am not sure if it is a true side effect of the drug or not) some depression_ some irritability_ some nervousness,I am having a difficult time in trying to decide whether or not to stay on this drug.  It has helped.  I have gone from daily migraines (and missing 40+ days of work last year) to 3 a week.  However_ the side effects are considerable.  My job is not one that allows for much latitude in performance and I am just not able to keep up.  HOWEVER I DID WANT TO NOTE THAT FOR THE HAIR LOSS I WAS TOLD TO USE A SELENIUM BASED SHAMPOO_ AND IT WORKED WONDERS!!

I still feel pretty spacey_ especially when the dosage is increased.  I am now taking 100 mg 2 X a day.  I think I actually felt better when the dosage was 75 mg 2x a day.

It also made my depression worse. The side effects eased up after a while but they never went away. I didn't have a single headache.  But the mood swings were too much_ even at lower doses.,I gained 60 lbs on antidepressants. After going off them my doctor prescribed Topamax temporarily to help me lose some of the weight.  I started at 25 mg/day and by week 3 was at 100 mg/day.  Food and beverages tasted normal (of course) and I didn't lose my appetite (typical).  I didn't lose weight either (go figure). I'm the only person who didn't lose weight on Topamax. I went off it after 3 months because I lost my patience and the side effects were too much.,F,43,3  months,5/17/2007,Topamax
1122, 5, Migraines,"In the beginning_ I had to titrate to a higher dose of 75-100 to get my migraines under control.  I had been having them almost every day...very debilitating.  After one year_ they are well managed (SO wonderful!) and I now take 25 mg. a day with very minimal side effects.  The ""stupimax"" factor is real but for me it wore off after about 6 months.  You should be careful if you are on a higher dose and driving though.  I have found the lower dose to be very effective in controlling once horrible migraines. This has been a great drug for me in relieving my migraines. (Read my additional comments though).",Look at any other medications you are taking.  They sometimes compound the sleepy and low cognitive impact...even something as little as Benadryl while on Topamax can really be impacted (increased effect).  This could make it much harder to function.  As far as hair loss_ I've heard great results with taking Biotin (available from the health food store) which is a vitamin that is depleted by anti-seizure medicines.  I know this drug can be hard to get use to at first and will not be for everyone. Good luck to all!,F,33,18  months,5/15/2007,Topamax

I am staying at 45 mg until I am on topamax 5 weeks and then we will start to increase again.  I did not experience any tingling in the feet and hands.  I was tired and dizzy most of the time and had no interest in food.  I was also nauseated during the time I was increasing the dosage but that passede after a few days after the increase.  The biggest side effect bothering me now is that I am having horrible hot flashes day and night.  I am at the menopause age but take all kinds of natural supplements that have kept that problem at bay so I am thinking that topamax is affecting my female hormones.

My doctor wants to get me off the Inderal entirely however my last attempt to reduce the dosage left me with increased headaches and reduced quality of life again. I'm nervous to increase the topamax because of the side effects. I worry that I might have been a serious danger on the road before I stabilized.

The 1st time was a couple of years ago..I definitely remember the tingling sensation...but I really don't remember feeling this spacey!

I think i just need to ride it out...this drug can help you 'even' your mind out. The last time I really got focused..my binges (food and booze) all but stopped..I have had zero desire to binge since 100 mg. So that must be a good sign! Has anyone else experienced HEARTBURN!?!?!

I just feel stoned; the PTSD has not yet calmed down too much_ but I am getting a bit steadier on my feet with the BPII after a major PTSD/BP event a month ago.  So we'll see if the Topamax does help as we go down the path.  I am willing to stick with it a while longer_ as I am not working at the moment.  If I were working_ I would not be taking it it. It is_ as I adjust_ kind of a bummer_ as I am also a long-distance runner in training for a half-marathon in July_ and since being on the drug_ even my shortest runs suck because I feel too weak.  Does this go away?,F,40,1  months,4/12/2007,Topamax

I'm lucky I didn't kill anyone or myself.  However_I stayed on topamax because my depression was so debilating I didnt have a life before it.My weight loss tappered off eventually but I changed my diet and I'm now at my target weight.

She has a loss of appitite (she is not overweight by any means) but this side effect was one reason she WANTED to try this medication.  Her mood swings are starting to fade_ she has gone to bed early many nights (we give her medicine to her at night).  In the 2 weeks she has been on it_ she has woken up 3 times with a stomach ache.  Out of the 3 times she has missed one day of school.  Talked to the doctor_ and are thinking since she is eating less_ she might not be getting enough fiber_ thus causing sonstipation and tummy aches.  Continueing the medication_ upping fiber_ and if any more tummy aches come_ then will take her off of it.,She has tried 100 mg of Risperdal_ no help with that medication.  Currently on 25 mg of Topamax a night.  If stomach aches do not come back will up her dose.

Carbonated drinks had a metallic taste. Depression and suicidal thoughts.,"The hair loss is horrid and unfortunately it began within 2 months of starting Topamax. However I blamed the thinning and change in hair texture on my new stylist and the color she used (what a coincidence that I'd changed stylists when I started this drug). But when I noticed that my hair felt just like it did when it I started losing it when I had undergone chemotherapy_ I realized it had to be the topamax. If I'd known that hair loss was a potential side effect_ I would not be in the situation that I am now. I'm hoping the hair loss stops now that I've discontinued the drug. The memory loss and language problems were so bad that I didn't speak in front of a group without first ""rehearsing"" in my mind what I was going to say. I also realize now that I was depressed and even felt suicidal at times.  This drug is dangerous and every patient should be counseled and cautioned before they are prescribed it.

I have tried everything from Depakote to Lamatacil_ Depakote causing heath concerns (high blood pressure due to annoying uncontrollable weight gain) and Lamatacil gave me tartitive dyskenisia...so finally my pdoc prescribed me topamax_ which has taken away all desire to self medicate with alcohol_ etc and has stopped my rapid cycling dead in its tracks...for the first time in my life I feel ""normal"" and it feels great.  I find that by staggering the doses 3 times a day is the best way to stabilize my moods_ plus it stops the irritability that I found I got when I took it only at night - Also_ a good remedy for the cognitive ""stupidness"" that is associate with this drug is if you take Omega 3 fish oils with DHA/EPA (found at your local health food store_ make sure you get the one free of heavy metals)",F,24,4  weeks,3/15/2007,Topamax

I really wanted it to work especially for the weight loss cause I'd gained 20 lbs in a year while on Prozac.  Unfortunately being in a fog and not being able to remember simple things did me in.  Plus I really couldn't tell that my mood was being stabilized.  The side effects were not worth continuing for the standard 4 weeks of waiting to see if it truly was going to help me.  I only lost 3 lbs during the short time I was on it even though I only ate like one meal a day -- small meal at that.,F,35,3  weeks,3/1/2007,Topamax

I started getting migraines when I was 8. I could manage them until about 8 months ago when I started getting them weekly and they started lasting several days.

However_ I had NO IDEA how severe the side effects would be. I took my first does at night then went to bed so I did not know how drowsy (not dizzy as the labels says) I would become. I took my second does at 5:30am the next morning then went for my regular before work workout at the gym. By 7:15am_ I thought I was going to pass out!

Topomax reduced them by maybe 10%_ but Dopomax was my nickname - made me very stupid.  You MUST drink plenty of water to mitigate this effect.  Also_ if you must take anti-biotics_ you must reduce or stop Topomax.  I told my gyn_ but she did not know about this drug interaction_ and the pharmacy did not either.  My neurologist later told me that anti-biotics will cause the Topomax to incorrectly metabolize in the liver_ resulting in a negative impact to cognitive function.  I was very very confused the week I was on_ and made critical errors at work recalling the sequencing of events.  A very bad trade for only 10%.,,F,50,1  years,2/21/2007Email,Topamax

Some daytime sleepiness but this has passed as I got used to it.  Fat around my midsection has started to go away -- even though I've only lost a couple of pounds my figure looks better because of this slimming in this area -- guess it is due to less cortisol/stress hormone and therefore less fat there.

I was on prozac before this to prevent my migraines which did not work at all and it actually made me depressed_ made me lose 10 lbs in 1 month (which i didn't really need to lose since i only weighed 120 @ 5'6"" to start) and just  totally didn't feel like myself but i felt much better when i started on this....even after reading all of these horror stories on here. I have probably stayed about the same as far as the weight. My appetite has actually come back quite a bit but i don't seem to be putting the weight back on. I seemed a little clumsier than normal and forgot my pin# one day when i first started but was that from the medicine or just one of my normal blone moments???? I haven't experienced any of the horrible ""stupidn",(Cont.)I will say though_ that my migraines are not GONE. They do seem to be getting more under control. I can now take a normal over the counter medicing like Tylenol or Motrin to get rid of them (which NEVER would have worked before) and sometimes they even go away on there own!!

This drug is really helping me.  All the possible side effects:  brain fog_ memory loss_ etc..were problems I had unmedicated.

Weight loss from the beginning that leveled off around a year_ but spiked again with an increase in dosage.  Memory issues in question.,During the titration period_ I began on a dosage of 25 mg. I initially titrated up to a dose of 100 mg.

I will never ever go back to the way I was before Topamax by choice! My daughter is also bipolar and we are trying to get the doctor to try Topamax for her_ too! FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AND CHAT!!!

It worked very well for me_ if you can get through the side effects.  Dosage should be started very low and increased at an extremely slow rate. It takes time and is not for everyone.  My Dr. was very  forthcoming about the poss. side effects_ especially in continuing my education.  Against his presumption_ I completed my college_ with honors. When I stopped taking it_ I was at 100mg daily.  That was a couple years ago. I did get kidney stones_ thankfully_ tiny ones that did pass-pain free.  My own fault as I NEVER drank water. Caff. free Diet Coke (even on the Topamax-still taste yummy to me) Until a few days ago_ was on Lamictal for only a month and the migraines and nausea were killing me. The severity so bad_ was inducing my seizures.  Began Topamax again_ 2 days ago_ after being off of it for a couple years.  I get the brain foggies_ but can deal w,F,36,1  years,9/21/2006,Topamax

Tried antihypertensives_ antidepressants_ antipsychotics_ over-the-counter meds_ steroids_ etc.  and nothing is effective.  Regimine will work for approximately 2 years then my body somehow becomes immune to medication and the doc asks me what I WANT TO DO NEXT??  I believe this drug is effective in preventing my headaches for a period of time but unfortunately side effects are difficult to deal with especially in combination with the depakote.

And I almost caused the death of myself and my child when I stepped out with him infront of a car on the road because I literally forgot to look for traffic. This is when I decided enough was enough and was informed by my neurologist that discontinuing the medication would in itself cause seizures. He denied that Topamax was responsible for any of the side effects claimed above. I have since learned through research he is grossly wrong.

However_ everything is getting MUCH better.,I take this as monotherapy. Used to be on Lamictal but I wanted to try this because I was drinking too much (approx. avg. of 30 units per week). So far mood swings are under control but maybe too early to tell. It also took my anxiety away_ much to my surprise. I am SO happy about that. I DO feel a bit disabled here though - with a highly academic work requiring lots of concentration and a brain that is not quite as fast as usual. Hope it gets better.

I developed bumps or hives i guess they were where ever i would itch and i itched EVERYWHERE_ my arms_ back of my legs_ small of my back_ my chest_ my neck_ my head! I consulted a pharmacist to see if i was having any kind of allergic reaction she just said itching was a side effect (yes_ i read that on the pamphlet but i wouldn't be calling you if i wasn't concerned that the itching is accompanied by hives!) and i could take benedryl ..oh yay!

I only started going to dr's looking for an alternative when I read that psuedophedrine will be replaced with something else due to abuse. No doc has yet seemed to beleive the sudafed really does prevent them_ and this topamax side effects are not worth it_ even if it worked_ which it doesn't - when I stopped my daily sudafed and started taking topamax_ I started getting migraines again.

It has also controlled my eating habits (during migraines I had insatiable cravings for food of any kind).

He put me on Topamax the final dosage being 200mgs a day increasing by 25mgs per wk until I reached that dosage. I am migraine free and happier than ever! I did that for 7 months and then the short-term memory effect really started becoming a problem. I was forgetting so much that I was stressing myself out more than I care to remember. Went back to my neuro and he reduced my dose to 100mg a day and in addition to that he put me on Pamelor_ 25mgs a day. I have most of my memory back and still migraine free!

I did have a 6 month period where all I could eat was granola bars because anything else caused severe tummy pain_ but_ I don't know if that's related and my husband says having conversations with me can be like playing charades with words and that was before the topamax.  (I never can find the words I am looking for),I love topamax because it has decreased my nightmares that I have suffered from since I was a child and it helps with my depression_ with the headaches_ and it helps me sleep.,F,27,2  years,7/11/2006,Topamax
1354, 4, Bipolar disorder type II,rapid weight loss and constant appetite suppression_ some word loss and a bit of mental confusion. lost 28 pounds in about 6 weeks. I've lost so much weight that the doctor's told me he'll take me off if I don't gain weight. I'm trying to gain weight back since it does work for my mood swings and these side effects are better than lamictal's acne and hair loss. So_ if you are trying to lose weight and have bipolar disorder and have the summer off where you don't need to concentrate too much this is the drug for you.,Seriously_ though it is a viable option in bipolar disorder. I use it in combo with Wellbutrin and trazadone at night to sleep and after many years i'm finally stable. I too wish that doctors would stop writing off this drug as ineffective for BP. Yes_ there are some serious side effects. But just about every bipolar drug on the market has serious side effects. You just have to figure out which ones you can live with. Topamax made me forget words (only for awhile) and suppresses my appetite (that hasn't come back)but still works quite well in stabilizing my moods and is as effective as Lamictal which carries its own fun bag of side effects.,F,35,6  months,7/11/2006,Topamax
1355, 2," Daily ""Migraine"" Headaches",Where do I start?  Dizziness_ nausea (this is where the weight loss everyone talks about comes in)_ diarrhea_ coughing_ breathing problems_ muscle spasms_ arm weakness_ chest pain and tightness_ anxiety_ depression_ fatigue_ sleepiness.,I know this medicine works great for a lot of people but for me it did not. For the first week I didn't have a headache at all and I was only a little dizzy so I was very happy.  Then about a week and a half into taking it_ everything changed. My pain came back and the side effects started.  I was crying all the time about things that didn't make any sense. I just felt depressed and like I couldn't function.  I was constantly worried about everything. I was very sick at my stomach and didn't want to eat anything which is very unusual for me because I love food. I also developed a horrible cough with rattling in my chest.  My legs would randomly jerk and move. All I wanted to do was sit around or sleep.  My mom and boyfriend both said my personality had done a complete 360.  All this and I was only on it for 3 weeks and only went up to 50 mgs.,F,20,21  days,7/11/2006,Topamax
1356, 5, Migraine / Chronic Headaches,Began at 25_ then 50 mg.  At low dosage_ experienced panic attacks and shortness of breath.  Possibly d/t transitioning from Depakote_ which while it eliminated my headaches_ it made me feel emotionally flat and chronically tired.  Ramped up to 400 mg before headaches were under back under control.  Experienced mild cognative disfunction at 400 mg_ side effects gradually worsened after 2yrs at this dosage - (confusion_ language problems_ trouble concentrating_ short term memory problems)  Also had trouble sleeping (staying asleep)_ became very sensative to caffeine.  Reduced to 200 mg_ reduction in side confusion/cognitative effects.  However_ still have trouble sleeping.  Headaches are still well controlled at 200 mg.  1 headache (mild) in 10 months since halving dosage.,Is not quite as effective as Depakote_ but side effects (so far) are more tolerable to me than that medication.,M,39,3  years,7/10/2006,Topamax
1357, 1, Migraines,My side effects while taking this drug were memory loss and an inability to think clearly or focus on anything.  Examples: I found it very difficult to do simple check writing.  My husband said my verbal responses were very slow.  I momentarily forgot my middle name!  How sad is that?  I also felt like I had a small electrical current running through my body...the tingling I guess.  Also my eyes hurt (to the point of having a doctor examine them)_ extreme lethargy_ sleeplessness and an overall feeling of not being well.,The one side effect I had hoped for (weight loss) never happened and I still had migraines.  The good thing about Topamax was that it made me feel so bad that when I quick taking it I was happy to just have my migraines.  I would not recommend this drug for anyone.,F,56,1  months,7/6/2006,Topamax

The hair loss is the worst side effect.  I could deal with the tingling hands and feet and speech problems,F,32,7  months,7/5/2006,Topamax
1359, 5, Migraines & nerve damage,Had tingling in my face_ hands and toes if I miss a dose. Appetite goes up and down. Had an inital weight lose but that has leveled out. Libido is nil. I get disoriented and sometimes start to tip as I walk or trip over my own 2 feet. I get confused all the time! Not only do I spell backwards but I talk backwards. I also_ as many others cannot find words when trying to have a conversation.,I started taking 100mg Topamax for migraines that I was having 1-2 a week and it helped. Then I had a spinal fusion and I began to get the migraines 5x a week. It was like they came back with a vengence_ worse then I had gotten them before. My doctors started increasing my dosage 25 mg at a time until I was up to 300mg. The migraines finally decreased down to 2-3 a month but my brain was mush and I didn't sleep_ so back down to 200 mg. I went. I've been there for about 8-9 months now and the migraines are the same at 2- 3 times a months_ I just don't have as much brain mush! Although I did fall the other day_ I still get a little disoriented from time to time and feel like I cannot have an intelligent conversation because I lose my train of thought. Some days I feel very clear_ others_ not so much. I think it definately helps with my moods/depression from my accident.

As a student not being able to recall the answers to test questions when your grade is based solely on test scores is a huge issue. after about a year and 1/2 on topamax I started having migraines again despite the high dosage.

I had to have a lower CT scan_ and I was about to have an upcoming Cystoscopy for Interstitial Cystitis when I realized that none of this was necessary because my pain was due to the Topamax.  Topamax causes bladder irritation and all kinds of urinary problems that I was not aware of.

1381, 3, Migraine prevention,I had strange visual affects.  At night_ I would see trailing on all objects_ especially lights while driving.  My toes and fingers would get tingling sensations like they were loosing blood.  I was kind of mentally slow like others describe- but it wasn't as bad.  I lost wieght- 10 lbs. in a month.  That was nice.,The strangest thing was the visual halucinations (if thats what you call them).  It was like being on LSD- but only at night when I was tired.  Only a few other people desribed the same thing that happened to me- like seeing trails of light when it was dark.  This was hard to deal with when driving- every light on the road looked like a laser show.  In my apartment_ at night_ I couldn't move my head without seeing every object in the apartment trailing.  It was so bad some nights I would just close my eyes while I was walking around.  This started on only 50 mg.  and I never took more than 75 mg.  Very wierd_ but worth it for the migraines.  Fortunately- I have a great doctor who was concered.  He took it upon himself to look up these side effects- and found that this is happening to other people and you should be immediately taken off the medication if this happens.

It works great for migraines_ i have been pretty  much migraine free since i have been on it_ and i was getting them every day.  i have to be careful of the weightloss though_ i am a very thin person to begin with and the doc said that he will take me off if i lose any weight_ so i force myself to eat.,F,38,13  days,5/4/2006,Topamax

Now I'm back up to 125_ but it takes effort.,Despite the weight loss problems_ I am loyal to Topamax.  It has saved my life. I've heard many Dr.'s slam this med_ saying it has no use in the treatment of bipolar disorder_ and that frankly_ makes me very angry b/c they are the same dr's saying Lamictal works great (Lamictal didn't work for me). Perhaps that's why Topamax isn't FDA approved for Bipolar. I'm glad I'm not on Medicaid. Then it wouldn't be covered.  I didn't respond well to most of the typical bipolar medications_ but my response to Topamax was wonderful.  It worked on both my depressions and my manias (mostly the manias).  I'm on 300mg.  My doc tried to reduce it to 250mg to help with the appetite_ but I got hypomanic.  I stopped getting migraines_ which I've had since 18_ when I reached 100mg_ and I asked my Dr. if there was any correlation!! So I have an added benefit.,F,27,2  years,5/4/2006Email,Topamax

I experienced a weird thing I read someone else experienced where I felt as if my body was sideways but it wasn't.  Tingling in my hands and feet the entire time like everyone else_ strong in my feet at times but not painful.  Total change in taste perception of certain foods the first 3-4 months while on drug.  Soda was horrible_ doritos were terrible_ other foods just didn't taste that great and I only wanted 2-3 bites of any food I ate.  Therefore_ I lost lots of weight the first month_ about 7 lbs which is alot for me starting out at 104.  All the side effects except tingling stopped by the 4th month.,This drug pretty much did nothing for the frequency of my headaches.  It may have decreased the intensity a little bit_ but that is questionable.  I still got headaches everyday for several months while on it.  I did not get better until getting off the drug and seeing a trigger point massage therapist_ accupuncturist_ chiropractor and getting an NTI (FDA approved night guard from a dentist for people who clench/grind their teeth) and also taking many supplements known to help migraines such as Omega 3 Fish Oil_ CoQ10_ Magnesium_ Riboflavin_ Feverfew.  If your health is normal other than your headaches_ see a Neuromuscular Dentist_ they may have the answers no one else could give you.  Drugs do not solve the problem in most cases_ they only control the symptoms.  My headaches (an other various pains & problems) ended up being caused by TMJD (Tendomandibular Joint Disorder).

My doctor then said it was okay to stop taking it completely. 1.5 DAYS LATER I DEVELOPED FULL TONIC CLONIC SEIZURES AND SPENT 5 DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL(30+ total seizures). The final verdict was the sudden stopping of this medication. It can cause seizures in people that are not prone to them or have never had them. Now that I am off of the medication_ I feel great.

I was told that these symptoms I have will go away but after reading much of what's here I'm not so sure that will happen. At my recommended dose I am not having any more seizures but at what cost? Would I rather be a living_ walking vegetable for the rest of my life? After reading all of these... I feel this is the question I have come to ask myself_ but at the same time I have not been on any other drug so I have nothing to compare it to. When I first began the Topamax at 25mg I never felt more alive and clear in all my life. It wasn't until the doses steadily increased that the side effects slowly started to sink in.

So it threw me into a wall about 8 feet away when it exploded. It was a 15 Amp mainline  Tech cable feed for a planar mill though and entered through my right hand and exited through my head. I blacked out and woke up in the hospital to a flatline machine. Anyway I've had headaches ever since the muscle aches and back pain went away the head pain didn't.

I had twitching_ numbness and tingling ALL over my body - literally from the top of my head to the tips of my toes_ although the body part(s) affected varied day to day. There was also a feeling of tightness around my limbs and / or my face. Major muscles would twitch uncontrollably and then be sore for days. I had vertigo and  nausea. I had hand tremors. I had hand_ foot and leg twitches. I was always tired. The scariest symptom was the leg weakness. And because of all of this I have gained a significant amount of weight. Then came Topamax. Here I am_ a mere 3 weeks later and I would say I am 85 - 90% symptom free. I started on 25 mg and increased it to 50mg after a week.

The tinnitus has not gone away_ and it is so loud that it's hard to pay attention to anything else. I took 5 pills (starter dose)_ and have been off of Topamax now for 9 days_ so I fear that the tinnitus is permanent damage. The rest of the side effects are decreasing in severity or have gone.

Tremendous benefit never seen with any other med. I did not need to lose weight_ but started to lose at 100mg/d and continued until I was able to get better control of it. My lowest was ~102# and losing at 5'6"". I have regained to ~110# My 1st MD said he did not believe the eye pain/redness was related to the med - I don't agree and my new neurologist does in fact believe it is related. FDA published a warning about this and all should be aware of the risks. I am now on my way to titrating down to 60mg at night and then getting off the med as the cognitve side effects are unbearable.

I was feeling really sick about 12 hrs after I took it_ so I take it around 4 or 5 in the afternoon_ so it takes affect while I am sleeping_ this has been a huge help.,F,33,12  days,1/2/2006,Topamax

I'm sure this medicine probably helps give a lot of people their life back_ but it nearly took mine away. I was told this morning to stop taking this drug immediately. I had a really_ really_ bad reaction. Even so_ I don't think I would have wanted to stay on this medication because it turned me into a zombie from day one.,F,26,14  days,12/29/2005,Topamax

Imitrex was not always working.  I was not coping well at all.  I have been on Topamax 200 Mgs. going on 5 months now and I experience approximately 1 or 2 at the most migraines at the in a month.

1475, 4, Chronic Daily Headaches,Thought patterns are slow_ sodas taste funny_ low sex drive as well as tingling in the legs and toes that drives me up the wall from time to time!,After 5 years of many_ many tests_ many different medications_ many different Dr.s a person has to weigh the price to wake up without a headache depends on how bad that headache was to begin with.  After reading many of the reviews_ I really respect everyones concerns regarding Topamax.  For me_  Topamax alone doesn't work for my daily headaches.  I must take an SSRI in addition to a calcium channel blocker and 200 mg. of Topamax per day( 100 mg. in the AM and 100 mg. in the PM).  I started out with 50 mg. of Topamax per day and did not even have a hint of a headache for over 2 months.  As the headaches started coming back_ I had to increase the Topamax.  I've had to increase it several times now.  The slowness of my thought process is a frightening side effect but for many of us that are in such extreme pain_ it is somehow worth the trade off to be able to wake up with a smile on our lips instead of tears in our eyes.,F,48,6  months,12/3/2005,Topamax

Really bad tingling in hands and feet_ Confussion and unable to focus_ spacey and tired.,Overall I think it is helping cut the headaches back.  I'm having a hard time tolerating the tingling and I swear it's making me stupid.  I was told to stick it out a while longer and it should improve.  I lost 5lbs in just over a week.

Currently taking 100mg. at bedtime.  Most annoying side effect is coated tongue_ dry mouth and ""buzzy"" feeling of face and lips.

1479, 1, migraines,Being on Tomapax was the worse experience of my life. I have had migraines since I was a kid and I take Excedrin for migraines. I went to a neurologist because the Excedrin just wasnt helping anymore. He put me on the Crazy Pills! This medicine affects your temporal lobes and if you have completely healthy temporal lobes this medication can have a nasty effect. Let me go through the complete side effects list and tell you what I went through. Here is what I experienced abnormal coordination_ agitation_ anxiety_ appetite loss_ confusion_ depression_ difficulty with concentration_ difficulty with memory_ dizziness_ drowsiness_ fatigue_ language problems_ leg pain_ loss of coordination_ mood problems_ nausea_ nervousness_ slowing of movements_ speech problems_ tingling or burning sensations_ weakness_ aggressiveness_ dry mouth_ exaggerated sense of well being_ changes in taste_ feelings of unreality_ heart palpitations_ increased sweating_ hyperactivity_ loss of consciousness_ low,My suggestion to everyone who wants to take this medicine try it for 1-2 weeks and then checkout the side effects list. If you look at the list before hand you could drive yourself crazy thinking you have every symptom on the page. Do not take this drug till you read the full side effect list. THIS LIST IS NOT ON THE TOPAMAX WEBSITE THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE ALL SIDE EFFECTS. GO ONLINE AND FIND ONE AND YOU'LL KNOW WHY THEY DON'T DISCLOSE THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. You will be surprised about what you find about this drug. http://www.migraines.org/treatment/protpmax.htm Above is a link that you should go to. I find it quite funny how the worst ratings of this medicine are at the very bottom of the website. They should be placed on the very top. This drug can be dangerous. I hope the people at Johnson & Johnson which own Topamax monitor this website. Maybe they should think about adding full side effects list after my posting.,F,21,4  weeks,11/28/2005,Topamax

The recall factor has gotten better_ or I am just finding ways to get around it. I will say I have tried to wean myself off of Topamax a few times_ with some not so great results! I gained lots of weight in a short amount of time_ and suffered constipation. I even stayed off for 3-4 months and the problems did not go away. I am having some headaches_ but not sure if they are related to spinal problems or my migraines. I feel this drug has been well worth the side effects_ even though all are not that pleasant.

I have had a serious health condition brewing that I was not receiving care for because I simply didn't care! Further_ while on Depakote_ I had gained an ungodly amount of weight that I couldn't lose for anything. I had lost most of my extensive vocabulary_ most of my memory_ and most ambition to do anything. In just over 3 weeks on Topamax_ I've lost 8 lbs_ begun experiencing happiness_ anger_ lust_ sorrow_ creativity_ inspiration_ etc. I've taken up art again.

I used this drug once before and it worked_ I just didn't like the tingling. My toes -- especially my big toe -- would literally go purple when it tingled and it would be like pins poking me. So_ I thought the grass would be greener elsewhere. Plus_ it gave me a sweet tooth (no weight loss here!). So_ I went to a neuro and had bunches of tests and tried at least 3 other drugs (the ones I can remember: Nortriptyline -- caused my hair to fall out_ Zonegran -- caused deep muscle and joint pain_ and Lamictal -- caused double/blurry vision so bad I had to go to the eye doctor b/c I thought I was going blind!) After all of those horrible experiences AND having to be hospitalized for rebounds from OTCs_ I decided some tingling and minor cognitive difficulty was the lesser of the evils. Not too painful and I know I'm not stupid. So I'm back. I've gone from level 9-10 migraines (frontal_ cluster_ sinus_ you name them) every single day to tiny_ nagging headaches maybe every other day.

Would like to lower dose to 75 mg. per day if it will work_ felt much better overall at that dose with hardly any annoying side effects.  Love the weight loss.  I feel like I've lost a bit of my personality at 100 mg.  I feel sort of flat.  Hate the fuzziness and lethargy.  I do think it is working to reduce the number of migraines but am not sure yet.  The jury is out.  For sure I'll give it at least another month or two.  The best drug for my migraines is an Imitrex injection.  It works nearly every time.

1536, 1, Bipolar,I was on the topamax (100mg/ day) because I gained 20 pounds in the first six months of taking Zyprexa. The side effects of topamax are HORRIBLE! I had intense rage and memory problems_ hair loss_ anorexia_ and it also aggrivated a stomach ulcer and caused problems with my kidneys as well. Needless to say_ the rage alone outweighed any benefits it was having on mood stablization. The appetite supression worked but was unnecessary due to the fact that I was also on Geodon_ (40 mg 2x/ day) which did not cause the appetite increase like the Zyprexa so I didn't need anything else. I went off of the topamax_ and all of the symptoms went away_ except for the ulcer which I'm still dealing with.

1540, 1, Migraines,severe memory loss and confusion_ depression,My senior year of highschool I began getting migraines. After trying multiple medications with no success_ my neurologist prescribed Topamax. I was on it for approximately two years. (75mg/day)At first_ it seemed to be a Godsend_ relieving my constant migraines to the point that I only had one or two every month. Then the side effects started. The biggest problem was I didn't realize they were side effects of the Topamax I was taking.First_ some key background information on myself: I was a member of the Gifted and Talented program_ an athlete holding school records_ and drum major of the band_ amongst other achievements. I rarely missed class_ and was for the most part an 'A' student.Then I started failing. I barely passed my second semester classes. My parents just thought I was slacking off_ as plenty of students due in their senior year. This wasn't the case. I didn't know what was going on_ but I couldn't remember anything. I felt like I couldn't think.It got worse.I entered a university that fall. I failed all of my classes but one. I couldn't remember what days I had class or what those classes were_ let alone what assignments were due. This continued for the rest of that school year and the next.Fall of my sophomore year I began going to counseling. My emotions were completely out of control and I was still in very poor standing grade-wise. I had to carry my schedule and a map of the campus with me wherever I went_ because I couldn't remember what buildings they were in or where those buildings were. I couldn't remember what day it was. I had hardly any friends_ and spent the majority of my time alone in my room_ either sleeping or staring off into space.The side-effects came to their climax that winter_ when I began having bouts of amnesia. I would leave the dorm to go to class_ and a few minutes later I would find myself on the sidewalk_ not knowing where I was going_ where I was_ or how I even got there. Eventually_ after sitting down for a few minutes_ I would be able to remember where my dorm was and find my way back.Everything ended when on the morning of a final I woke up_ had a seizure_ woke from that about a half hour later_ and ended up in the emergency room. I don't remember most of that day. After ruling out all causes_ it was decided that it must be the Topamax. When I went to see my neurologist_ she said it couldn't be the Topamax_ and actually tried to up my dosage. I refused_ and weaned myself off of it.Now_ about six months later_ I am returning to my normal self. I can remember my class schedule and where everything is. My grades have improved a bit_ and my social life as well. It's going to take awhile for my life to get back to normal. Thankfully my parents_ family_ and friends have been understanding.Two years of my life are a confused blur filled with blank sections of memory. My college career is permanately scarred_ and my mind might be as well. I don't care how well this medication works_ I wouldn't wish what I have suffered through upon my worst enemy.This has been cross-posted. People need to know.,F,20,2  years,7/14/2005Email,Topamax

It helped the migraines_ nearly eliminating them_ but now it doesn't seem to be very effective anymore.  Due to the side-effects_ I not only don't want to increase it_ but I'm needing to decrease or get off it.  It's causing me to pass out lately_ and is causing dizziness like it did when I first started it.  Other possible causes of this have been ruled out.  It's also causing extreme fatigue lately and increasing confusion_ memory loss_ and forgetfulness.  I have to write EVERYTHING down or I forget it the next damn minute.  My friends and doctor have been so concerned about my passing out_ they've even had me go through MRI's/MRA's_ echocardiograms_ tilt table tests_ 30-day EKGs and even an EPS to make sure  my heart is okay and everything is fine there...I've had to endure all of these tests because of the side-effects of this damn drug.

1567, 1, Migraine prevention,MY BIGGEST WARNING IS BE CAREFUL DRIVING AT NIGHT UNTIL YOU KNOW HOW THIS DRUG WILL AFFECT YOU!  I experienced very weird visual disturbances at night_ not being able to re-focus after looking directly at a bright light.  It was like a laser show.  Would have been cool_ had I not been behind the wheel!  Focusing your attention farther down the road & straight ahead helps.  Everyone is right that many foods taste differently.  Sodas are awful.  I also experienced the tingling in my hands_ feet & mouth.  There was so much more_ though.  I drank a gallon of water a day_ but my mouth always felt like fuzz and I was still constipated.  I experienced debilitating weakness & fatigue_ yet couldn't sleep at all.  I developed a wracking cough_ shortness of breath_ and back pain reminiscient of the time I had pneumonia_ but my lungs were totally clear.  My doctor was so determined to keep me on this medicine to help my migraines that she prescribed me 3 other medications to treat the symptoms caused by the Topamax!  Ironically_ the Topamax also gave me low-grade headaches similar to the kind you would get with a cold_ so I didn't avoid the headaches altogether.  My dosage was very low_ only 50 mg.  I have asked my doctor to reduce my dosage to 25 mg. & have been on that for a week.  My side effects have lessened_ but not gone.  I'm not sure I will continue past another week.

Topamax always had a sedatative effect so sleeping was improved and thus my mental function was better.  It had a positive effect on my mood.  Sodas were flat for about 2-3 months_ with some tongue numbness_ which has subsided.  My deliterious effects subsided - however hair loss became one - when I took my 75-100mg at night instead of 50mg bid.  I couldn't function.  HAVING SAID THAT.  After being on Topamax for almost 2 years my migraines have returned.  It could be stress or related to hormones.

Was VERY lethargic when I first started taking it_ but have gotten used to it - still need to sleep a bit more than before_ but functioning nearly normally now. Sodas and sweets tast funny_ kind of metallic. I lose the desire to eat VERY fast_ have lost a little weight_ about 5 lbs. Haven't had problem with hair loss_ but do have dry eyes_ and need to wear reading glasses now that I didn't need at my eye exam one month before starting the drug. Uncertain if sexual side effects noted by another person posting to this forum (that I've also noticed) are really from this medication or from the hormones my doctor is also trying since my migraines always followed my PMS and menstrual cycle_ and I seem to remember complaining about those effects on the hormones_ before starting the Topamax.,For about 2 years I was having 2 bouts of recurrent migraines that lasted between 3 and 7 days each_ more recently they had started lasting 7 to 12 days each episode. Zomig_ Relpax_ Imitrex_ etc. didn't touch them. Since reaching 75 mg of Topamax in last 2 months have only had 4 total episodes of migraines lasting 1-2 days each_ Imitrex or Zomig helped with 3 of those episodes_ but not with one of them. The doctor plans to keep me at this dose another month_ then may raise it a bit.,F,43,3  months,2/1/2005Email,Topamax

I know it had something to do with the Topamax because as the dosage went up_ so did the number of headaches.  When I started_ I had two headaches a month that lasted 2-3 days.  Now I have two a week that last only a few hours.  I like the weight loss because at 44_ I was gaining a few_  but combined with the insomnia and hair loss_ the net result is far from a healthier looking me.

1620, 3, Chronic Headaches,Tingling extremities_ mood swings_ speach problems_ loss of balance.,So far I have had not had to take additional medicine for headaches since taking Topamax now for 3 weeks.  This is a miracle since I have had a headache every day for 10 years.  I was getting a migrane about 3 times a year and had a brain aneurysm in 7/04.  I was about to ask the Dr. to take me off of Topamax though because the side effects seemed to much to handle.   I was crying becaue I could not find a sock.  I could not spell to save my life.  I would go to work and stare at the computer for 6 out of the 8 hours.  I tripped and bumped into every thing.  I would not fall asleep until 4:00 am and then wake up at 6:00 am.  The tingling in my hands and feet has somewhat subsided but I now notice it is only when I get cold.  I have not experienced the weightloss like I wanted (and secretly motivated me to go on the drug) but I am only at 100 mgs.  My doctor wants me to go up to 200.  I am scared though.  I dont want to lose my hair.  My symptoms seem to be subsiding and I just cannot imagine them getting worse.

1621, 4, Severe Migraine Headaches,I now take 50mg. in the morning and 75 mg. in the night_ and eachtime I had to increase my dosage by 25 mg. I would feel dizzy and lightheaded for about a week_ but then that would go away and I would feel back to my normal self. I have been on the medicine for 4 months and I lost 11 pounds_ which is great!,My migraine headaches_ which I started getting after 2 car accidents and 2 failed back surgeries_ came as frequently as 3-4 days a week and were a 7/10 to 10/10 on a pain scale. In 4 months_ that number has been reduced to 1 to 2 migraines a week with a 3/10 on a pain scale. I just take my 5 mg. Zomig when I get my little migraine now_ and the headache goes away within an hour. Topamax has given me my life back. Before Topamax_ I used to spend 3 to 4 days a week in bed. Now I spend 1 to 2 hours a week in bed at the most waiting for my very small 3/10 pain level migraines to go away. I reccomend Topamax to anyone who is having severe migraines.It is truely the miracle drug!,F,25,4  months,1/22/2005,Topamax

I felt a little spacy the first couple of days_ but that has passed.  All other side effects have been positive.  My mood has been fantastic_ very cheerful and mellow--my stress level is way down.  My appetite is down too_ and I have lost 3 pounds since I started taking the drug a little over 2 weeks ago.,I love this drug.  Aside from the carbonated beverage thing_ all my side effects have been postive_ and the burning_ tingly_ electrical-feeling pain has been cut at least in half for me_ which is a huge relief.  I still have achy joints_ and feel very stiff in cold weather_ but those feel much more manageable now that the nerve pain is under control.  Because my mood has been so good (I suffer from chronic depression_ and take medication for that as well_ but Topamax has added to the effectiveness of my Wellbutrin) and my anxiety level has been so low_ my thinking has actually been clearer and more creative_ which is apparently not the case for everyone (some people get foggy-headed on this drug).  For me_ it feels like since my energy is not so tied up in feeling lousy and being stressed-out and blue_ I have more energy for other things_ both physical and mental (writing_ reading_ etc.)_ and my motivation to follow through on ideas is much improved.  Granted_ I have been taking Topamax less than a month_ so my experience may change with time--if it does_ I will come back here and post an update.,F,27,2.5  weeks,1/10/2005,Topamax

However_ when I started taking Topamax_ my fears escalated significantly even though I was still taking my normal dose of the SSRI.  I also felt very paranoid which I have never experienced before.

I've had seizures for 5 years and have always expierenced some sort of memory and speech problems due to the anti-convulsant drug I was on_ but after taking Topamax I feel as though I'm going crazy. I can't even conversate with people anymore because my memory is so bad and I can never seem to get the right words out. I just went to my Neurologist today and Thank heaven I'm getting eased off Topamax. This was not a good expiernce for me but for others; well_ we all work different and everyone else expierences different side effects. I've heard from some that it's an excellent drug_ especially for losing weight.

I tried topamax a year ago at the suggestion of my neurologist_ but I quit because I thought it was giving me anxiety attacks.  We tried it again.  I think I was terribly naive to give it another shot.  I can't stop crying_ and I don't feel functional. I have trouble recognizing myself.

In the five weeks I've been on it_ I've lost about 10 pounds (not a lot_ but a start). But_ man_ I've been chewing my boyfriend up one wall and down another since I started this stuff. And *all* my diet sodas taste flat (which I guess is ok_ since I need to drink water_ what with the proclivity towards kidney stones this stuff'll give you).

I ended up seeing a neurologist_ and he prescribed topamax.  i was only taking 40 mg_ but my side effects were absolutely horrid- I would be driving in the car_ and forget where I was going- not once but EVERY time i drove.  I'm a full time nursing student_ and also work full time at a hospital_ so this was extremely scary_ both academically and professionally.  I had no ability to remember anything- especially numbers- and I've always had a fantastic short-term memory.  I started failing quizzes_ and I was incapacitated when speaking- I could barely form sentences.  The last straw with this drug was when I was talking to one of my instructors_ and watched his eyes float right out of his head and hover in front of it.  the neuro pulled me off the drug the next day.  I was also taking vicodin 60 mg/day for pain_ also from the endo_ so perhaps I had some bad drug interactions.  I'm now taking methadone 15 mg/day for the endo pain_ and nortryptiline 20 mg at night for the migraines- the pain in my body is almost gone_ and the headaches are starting to subside.  the topamax never got my headaches down below a 5/10 on a 1-10 scale_ and the minute i discontinued_ the pain shot back up.

1662, 5, seizure control,hair loss_ weight loss_ sleep loss_ moodiness,After losing 35 pounds (I'm 5'2_ that's a lot of weight for a small girl) and thinking this was a miracle drug_ my hair began falling out and I couldn't sleep through the night. If my day became overly stressful I felt insane. AND I was only on 25 mg of Topamax a day. I'm not even on this drug to keep from having seizures_ I'm on it for maintanence...thus the reason for such a low dosage. Now I'm afraid if I go off it I'll gain the weight back and to be honest_ I just don't know what it feels like be normal anymore. But_ I keep losing weight_ never have an appetite and am worried that all of my hair will fall out.  I feel great  other than the fact that I can't sleep half the time. I'm motivated and alert_ but when I'm high_ I'm really high and when I'm low_ I'm so low I think there's no coming back up.,F,25,1  years,10/5/2004Email,Topamax
1663, 5, mood stabilization,I know my 'side effects' are what others may be RX'd for_ but FYI... It suppresses my appetite (which is FINE with me) and I haven't experienced a migraine since I've taken it_ which -- apparently because I am peri-menopausal -- was beginning to be a monthly occurrence.,I assumed that my mental fuzziness and occasional slurred speech was a function of aging and 15 years of hard drinking_ but I now realize that the increase in the last year may have been due to the Topamax.,F,50,1.5  years,10/5/2004Email,Topamax
1664, 5, Depression & Weight Loss,Cannot drink carbonated soft drinks.  They taste awful.  All I can really drink is water.  Nothing else really tastes right.  Dry mouth.

1666, 3, Migraine,tingling fingers & toes; soda tastes terrible; zero sexual arousal; some weight loss; have an occasional loss of words,I'm taking 75mg/day... it has eliminated the constant mild daily headaches I was having_ but I still get the whopper monthly headache (hormone related).  I have to take Zomig for those...  I'm holding out hope that they'll eventually cease_ too.  The tingling eventually went away_ I'm enjoying the weight loss_ don't miss the soda (maybe that's why I'm losing weight - I was drinking an awful lot of sugar)_ but I sure would like to enjoy sex again.  I didn't realize the loss of words could be related until I saw others report the same... it comes and goes.  None of these are enough of a bother yet to stop taking the drug_ I'll decide in a couple of months if the whopper headaches ever go away.,F,35,2.5  months,9/22/2004,Topamax

1669, 2, seizure,severe hair loss_ insomnia_ memory loss_ no motivation,I have memory loss_ I have never slept through the night once since I have been on it.  I have been on it for 2 years 6 months and the reason I haven't switched to another medication is because I am allergic to several other ones I have tried. I haven't had any more seizures though.,F,49,2  years,8/18/2004Email,Topamax
1670, 4, migraines,Side effects include brain fog which ranges from the loss of words to slight memory lapses_ tingling in extremities (pins and needles)_ extreme thirst_ weight loss_ insomnia at higher doses_ lethargy at lower doses_ interference with oral birth control.,Overall_ topamax has been a blessing to my chronic migraines. They have reduced the frequency and intensity of them_ except for the hormonal migraines_ which they haven't helped with. Worst side effects? Brain fog and birth control problems...but_ I'm still with the drug_ stand by it and take the side effects over the pain!,F,31,1  years,8/13/2004,Topamax
1671, 4, bulimia-bingeing,2 months of horrible taste in carbonated drinks_ sitting still i felt as if i was tilting sideways sometimes_ first few weeks some drowsiness_ fatigued easily esp. at end of day.,made me feel very full after eating a small amt_ esp. after doseage being doubled_ which was the goal_ to stop the binges.  However_ as far as purging_ actually made me want to more after eating even small amount b/c of the over-full feeling_ but am better able to resist b/c that part of the brain is better regulated now due to the drug_ and_ b/c i am receiving counseling along with the drug.  Am still not 100% but bulimia is a mental disorder and a drug cannot cure it alone_ so this is pretty much as good as it gets_ as far as the Topamax gets.  I do hate taking 4 pills a day tho.  Why not make an inbetween doseage instead of going from 2 pills a day to 4?  Why not 2 low dose to 2 higher dose??  The price is twice as high now due to buying twice as many pills!,F,27,3  months,8/12/2004,Topamax
1672, 2, Migraine Prophylaxis,Severe language disorder. Loss of words although the picture was in my mind. Confussion and loss of organization to the point of routine tasks now completely undoable. Over sleeping and depressed motor activity yet loss of huge amount of weight.,Going on Topamax was a nightmare. I outside my body and watching myself. I started at 25 mg and that dosage was enough initially to rid my migraines for three months. I went up to 50 mg; same effect and migraines disappered for about 2 months. I went up to 75 mg_ no strange effects and migraines disappeared for about 5 months. However_ now the migraines are back worse than ever - 1 or 2 a week and some lasting 3 to 4 days. Imitrix and its cousins have no effect. My chloride level in my blood is slightly high and my GP wants me to increase to 100 mgs. I am resisting until a memory/cognitive testing is complete. I am on other drugs for other neurological conditions.,F,43,18  months,8/2/2004,Topamax

1674, 4, migraines,Tingling in hands and feet - worse in feet; hair loss;lost 22 pounds; significant word finding difficulties; mild agitation at times; and bleeding gums now. Carbonated beverages taste like crap.,started out with 25mg daily worked up to 130mg.  At top dose_ I think is when I started losing my hair & now my gums are bleeding. Has significantly helped my migraines though. Went from12 migraines/month to 2/month.  But_ not sure if I can live with the no hair!   So_ the drug works but the side effects are beginning to be bothersome.,F,33,7  months,7/28/2004,Topamax
1675, 5, Migraines,Minor Dizzyness and some minor speech problems (I have learned to slow down and think a few more nanoseconds before speaking)but none of the other major side-effects posted with the drug,I've been taking Topamax for for 1.5 months.  My average Imitrex injection rate was 12 per month.  Since starting the Topamax_ I have had three Imitrex injections_ one when I had just started taking the medicine_ one after driving for about 12 hours_ and the last one after a 17 hour flight.  I am feeling better now than I have felt in years.  I started at 25Mg/day for 2 weeks and am up to 25Mg 3 times per day.  I will stay at this rate for a while to see what happens.  I am very happy with Topamax and would recommend it to anyone with migraines.  Just don't ever start right in with a high doseage!,M,39,45  days,7/14/2004Email,Topamax

1678, 5, back injury resulting in severe ner,at first_ unbelievable detachment and spaciness_ but very shortlived_ occassional forgetfulness_ however the pain relief trade-off and hyper sensitivity relief I have gotten is well worth it. Yes_ appetite is down but that's a good thing. weight loss did occur_ but ok...cool with that too...it helped to take pressure off of the back.,I was warned by my neurosurgeon to have a baseline eye examine prior to beginning topamax and I did and was not at risk ... I have 6 mo. prevention checks to assure he and myself that all is cpoasetic(?) w/ eye situation _ altho I find when I am exceptionally fatigued _ I do notice  trailing and never did prior to taking this medicine.,F,42,1  days,7/11/2004,Topamax
1679, 5, Fibromyalgia-related chronic pain,I had pins and needles side effects sometimes_ but if I took vitamin B-6_ it went away.  I also lost 40 lbs. over 6 months_ which was great because I needed to lose it_ plus a lot more.  The only bad side effect I've noticed is that I've been unable to have an orgasm.  Now I am ready to come off of this medicine_ but only for that reason.  Will discuss this with my doctor on next visit.,It greatly diminished my chronic pain from fibromyalgia.

I'm still debating whether or not I'll stay on it_ but I haven't had a migraine since I've started.  The great debate is_ are the side effects worth not having a migraine.  Some days yes.

My feet tingle so bad sometimes that they actually feel like they are burning.,When I first heard about Topamax_ I was very hesitant to try it because I had heard of so many bad side effects.  I actually postponed starting it by 2 months because I was so afraid!  I wish I hadn't!  My migranes got so bad it finally landed me in the ER and I thought I was dying.  It was the absolute worst headache of my life. They ran a bunch of tests on me_ everything came out fine_ it was just a migrane.  I finally decided to try the Topamax.  My doctor started me at 25 mg for 1 week and went up 25mg every week untill I hit 100 mg.  I was still having headaches almost on a daily basis until I hit 100 mg.  Now I'm still taking it and it has been a little over a month on 100 mg and so far this month I have only had 3 days with a headache and I took an over the counter medication and it went away within an hour. For that_ I will live with the tingling in my feet and hands any day of the week!! I have not experienced any of the other side effects that other people write about which I am very thankful for.
