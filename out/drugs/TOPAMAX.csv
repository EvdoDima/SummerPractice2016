6, 3, cluster headache_ chronic migraines,Tiredness_ some nausea,Also take for absence seizures and as adjunct to bipolar meds.  It  doesn't work well for cluster headaches or chronic migraines but it's still better than nothing. It seems to help absence seizures but I'm also on 400 mg lamictal for those so who knows?  Also unsure if its effect on bipolar disorder as I take a lot of other meds for that.,F,34,2  years200 mg,6/5/2016,Topamax

8, 4, Migraines,Tingling in fingers. Hair loss so I went off the Topamax but then the chronic headaches came back. Word loss. Initial weight loss of 70 lbs due to feeling full and I used it to my advantage because I needed to lose the weight. I also lost all taste for alcohol. Haven't had any desire to drink in over 3-1/2 yrs. drank regularly all my life before Topamax.,When I noticed the hair loss I stopped taking Topamax but had to go back on it because of the chronic migraines. The Topamax seems to really work for me as far as the migraines. The only other thing that works for my migraines is not legal in my stupid state. (MJ). So I will be taking the Topamax until they get smart and legalize it. Fortunately for me the loss of words isn't terrible. Tingling has pretty much subsided except when cold. I've kept the weight off but had to work at it. Hair loss doesn't seem to be so bad. The headaches are way worse than most anything because mine are the kind that don't totally dibilitate but last 2 to 3 weeks. My job is reading and reviewing files all day long. You can't do that when your head hurts and all you want to do is go home and sleep so it's Topamax for me cause they tell me there's nothing else. I can't take pain meds during the day because I fall asleep at my desk. Besides they don't really get rid of the pain - maybe for 10-20 min.,F,64,1  years200 mgs,5/28/2016,Topamax
9, 1, Migraines,Distaste for carbonated beverages_ irritability_ confusion_ rage.,It's actually my (ex) wife that's taking topamax for migraines.  First she lost 30lbs which caused an attraction to the drug_ she says there are no more migraines.  After 3 mo I first asked her to stop taking it after noticing a behavior change.  After that nothing I could do was right_ 9 mos later I hear she wants to divorce me.  We have a very successful business_ nice imcome _ just finished building a new house.  The rage got worse I suggested at that point to separate.  I'm now divorced after 16 years together_ have a 9 yr old boy that we share custody_ I loved my family_ I hate this drug,F,45,1  years25mg 1X D,5/21/2016,Topamax
10, 1, Trigeminal Neuropathy,Mental imbalanceConfusionDesperate and disturbing thoughts ,I was given this drug as treatment for a neuropathic condition.I was warned by the doctor there may be issues_ but that I would know pretty quickly whether or not the drug was suited for me. Yes_ that was correct!  On the 2nd dose_ I could tell something felt different in my brain. I was processing things differently --and distant (not so good) memories were coming back in a rush_ as if they had just occurred.By day 4 when thoughts of suicide raced through my mind_ thankfully I was still lucid enough to know it was the drug and I had to stop taking it.  ,F,59,7  days10 1X D,5/20/2016,Topamax
11, 1, Headaches,My doctor prescribed me this for headaches. Did not work! I was constantly tired_ had tingling everywhere_ and lost 10 pounds because I had no appetite.,Of course everyone is different. So if this works for you_ great!,F,21,2  months100mg,5/20/2016,Topamax
12, 1, Migraines,Started off slow at 25mg to 50mg to 75mg for awhile. The MOMENT I was turned up to 100mg_ severe UTI. One after the other. Every time I would try taking the topamax_ another UTI. So I stopped. I no longer have signs of infection. I have developed chronic severe life ending pelvic and back pain. Had a cystoscopy done to check for IC which I don't really have. Topamax has ruined my life altogether. DO NOT TAKE IT. I would give anything to go back a year ago and have never taken that drug that ruined my existence. I now have permanent nerve damage and no quality of life.,PLEASE if anyone has had similar side effects do not hesitate to contact me. I can't be the only one to have a ruined life from this drug. It took a long time to get a doctor to admit and agree with me that it was the topamax that caused my problem. It was always within hours that the UTI would show up. I stopped the medication back in May of 2015. It is now May 2016 and I am worse than ever.,F,34,7  months100mg,5/9/2016Email,Topamax
13, 5, Uncontrolled migraines,I have increased my taper from 25 to 50 and noticed sleepiness the first day_ but not the second. Some indigestion_ but not intolerable.

It is life changing.,F,39,1  weeks50 mg,5/1/2016,Topamax
14, 1, Cluster headaches,Depression_ increased pain_ anxiety_ unable to eat_ fixation issues_ not feeling myself at all.,Not at all a good med for me. Even if clusters stopped this would not be worth it. Had more success (however limited) through regular massage and oxygen. If I had not suffered these conditions earlier in life and not know what they are_ the added distress would be unbearable. I have had clusters for over a year.,F,33,4  days25mg,4/30/2016Email,Topamax
15, 1, Migraine,Paranoid_ anxiety_ depression_ diarrhea . I have never had depression and I was so bad off that I couldn't get out of bed. I was paranoid beyond reason and that started me feeling anxious about everything. I have mild IBS to begin with but Topamax made it so much worse. I had to go off it because of the side effects,Nightmare drug for me and I was told that the side effects would stabilize after a few weeks. They never got better they got worse.,M,43,3  months100 2X D,4/27/2016,Topamax

18, 2, Migraine_  leg pains,It seemed ok for a very long time and I don't know what changed but I've become extremely paranoid_  drudging about things from the past that shouldn't be drudge up. Feeling sad and alone. It's like...WTF is this med doing.,,F,49,5  years,4/12/2016,Topamax
19, 1, migraines and nerve pain,I took it last night at 9pm. I couldnt fall asleep until 3am. Didn't feel to bad. A little difficult to wake up. Nerve pain was worse. All day today I have been edging on a migraine and feeling odd. Those symptoms are not too far off from normal unfortunately but I can at least maintain my mood and ability to stay awake. I found myself very very angry about things that do not normally bother me at all. I kept it all inside my head because I know its not me_ its this medication. I also kept falling asleep every time I sat down. Im dizzy and im having a hard time communicating. I feel poisoned.,I dont know if the side effects are worth the benefits... Im afraid to take it again honestly... I wouldnt be surprised if this drug is recalled. Bad Vibes,F,37,1  days25 mg,4/12/2016,Topamax
20, 1, Seizures_ Brain Mass,Started out as extreme tiredness_ which I can't complain about too much seeing as I've had insomnia since I was 8. So that's not too bad but the med's have been making me extremely moody and irritable which aren't good at all. I can't be around too much talking or I get annoyed easily and just want everyone to go away. Besides that they've been giving me extreme headaches(even though the doctors said they were headache medications too). But the main thing I am focused on is the pain. For the past two weeks it hasn't been nearly as easy to breath_ if I had to guess what it's like to have asthma_ this would be it. I have a constant cough when I breath and If I work too hard at work my breathing turns into heaving. My muscles feel like they barely work at all. And there is a sharp shooting pain in my upper abdomen area. I'm not 100% sure if these are things that will fade out in time or not_ again I've only been on the medicine for a month. Everything seems to fluctuate except the breathi,"They should be nicknamed the ""succubus"" pills. Because they suck the life out of you....",F,20,31  days25mg 4X D,4/9/2016Email,Topamax

22, 5, Uncontrolled Migraines,None so far...,I took the first dose last night before bed and I woke up today completely headache free!!  I am on a taper increase dose so I will take 25 MG for one week_ then increase to 50 MG for one week_ then 100 MG at bedtime until reevaluated by my Headace Specialist. I hope this medication will help with my migraines. I have tried nearly everything else. If this medication works it will be worth any negative side effects. At least for me anyways!,F,35,1  days25 MG,3/23/2016,Topamax
23, 1, Migraine preventative,It turned me into a paranoid schizophrenic,"My pain management doctor prescribed this in hopes it would reduce the number of migraines I was getting. I hadn't taken it for more than a week when I began to feel strange ""in the head"". This drug had me cowering in the corner_ afraid someone was coming into my home. I would beg my husband not to leave for work because being alone began to terrify me. I felt detached from the world around me and everything was unreal. When I was forced to go out to buy groceries_ I quickly threw items into the cart as having people around me caused great anxiety. All the while I felt like I was walking 2 feet above the floor. Upon getting home I would go to bed and literally hide under the covers until my husband came home. Often he would find me cowering in the corner of the room.It took me a while to realize it was the Topamax. I immediately stopped it and within two weeks I was back to my normal self but it was one of the worst experiences ever.   Apparently the drug altered the neurotransmitters in my brain_ causing such a horrible reaction. The only good to come of it was that I did gain a new understanding of what for many people is a permanent and frightening mental illness. Schizophrenia is no joke and nothing to make fun of.",F,66,3  weeks50 MG 2X D,3/19/2016Email,Topamax
24, 4, Migraine,Fatigue_ weight loss_ irritability_ inability to concentrate or find words_ over emotional at times,I have been on the medicine for almost 2 weeks and already lost 8 lbs. week one I was taking 50mg and now 75mg. No appetite_ then when I do eat_ it's like I get full really fast. That's NOT normal for me at all! Easily irritated and crying over things that are not worth crying over...quite pitiful. No urge to end my life_ not so much depressed but sometimes feel a little blue. Still too early to tell but so far I'm emotional and withering away...,F,25,2  weeks75mg,3/18/2016,Topamax
25, 5, Migraine,The side effects that I experience are extremely hot feet which regularly blister (standing in the shower or just a puddle is an amazingly relaxing experience) the doctor prescribed a gell but E45 seemed to do a better job. Continuing feelings or paranoia_ I initially started om 150mg twice per day but this may me feel suicidal_ reducing the dosage improved the outlook considerably but I dream of getting even with people before situations exist. I wish that I had the same issue with losing weight that everyone else is complaining about nut maybe it is all of the other pills that I have to take for my heart.,,M,55,6  years75mg 2X D,2/21/2016,Topamax
26, 4, Mood Disorder,Tingling feet_ unable to process thoughts_ shaky hands_ weight loss_ appetite loss.,Although I have been enduring many side effects_ the side effects are starting to calm down now. It takes about 10-14 days being on this particular drug to get Accustomed to. I am on topomax because I was recently diagnosed with a mood disorder_ similar to bipolar but not. It calms me_ and keeps me stabilized to the point where I am feeling like I am not fighting a war inside my head. I would rather deal with the side effects then my mood disorder_ that is for sure!,F,24,1  months100 Mg,2/14/2016,Topamax
27, 1, Mood Stabilzer/Possible Weight Loss,"The first three days I took only one pill a day at 25 mgs. It was ok. I felt a little ""flat"" but not in a bad way. The fourth day I went up to two pills a day as recommended by the shrink. It was alright although I began to feel brain dead at work. Speaking my own language was a challenge at times_ food was tasting weird_ I could barely keep my eyes open at my desk. This past Saturday I slept about 18 hours straight. Today_ two days later_ my skull feels like a metal helmet_ I had waves of nausea all day long but couldn't eat anything all day to throw up. I considered going to the Emergency room but I didn't think they could do anything for me.The shrink told me to cut back by one pill but I just want to go cold turkey. I want this stuff out of my body. What a mistake! The Prozac was fine. If it ain't broke_ don't fix it!!!",I have been on Prozac for 20 years. I wanted to discuss possibly reducing my prescription but the psychiatrist thought to supplement with Topamax? I will admit the possibility of losing weight did lure me in even though I would be more medicated. I would rather be my chubby funny self than a nauseous zombie.

28, 1, Complex migraine prevention,Anisocoria of the left eye.Altered state of consciousness lasting far beyond discontinuation of drug.,I was given this drug for complex migraines and the morning after the first dose resulted in altered consciousness and anisocoria where the left eye was dilated and less reactive to light than the other eye. I was promptly told to discontinue the drug by my doctor and have ever since had more blurred vision - slight double vision at times - and a frequent manifestation of the conditions mentioned. I've had people mention the anisocoria many times_ always the same effect. It continues to burden me with a majorly frequent 'haze' of altered consciousness_ or a 'dopey' feeling.,M,23,1  times25 MG 1X D,1/18/2016Email,Topamax
29, 1, Migraines,Hair loss_ loss of words_ writing and typing appear dyslexic_ brain fog_ anxiety_ loss of cognitive function at usual level. Muscle aches in back_ neck and shoulders. My eye sight deteriorated rapidly from 20/20 vision.,This medication did help with my migraines_ i have been off the medication for a year and i am still not how i was prior to taking the medication. I do not believe that my vision or memory_ brain function will return to how i once was.,F,42,4  months50 1X D,1/3/2016,Topamax
30, 4, Migraines/tension headaches,tiredness_ mental fog_ dizziness_ a bit of diarrhea,I was prescribed topomax because I can't take excedrin due to a caffeine sensitivity and naproxen wasn't working. I was getting tension headaches EVERY SINGLE DAY_ and they would often escalate into migraines. At first I was started with 25mg but that wasn't enough to prevent the migraines so I went to 50 mg. It prevents my migraines and tension headaches 75% of the time. Occasionally I have break through tension headaches and I ALWAYS get migraines on my period_ even with the topomax. It does a pretty good job but it doesn't prevent every migraine.,F,20,1  years50 mg 1X D,12/29/2015,Topamax
31, 3, migraines,I was on 25 mg first and only had the tingling in my feet in hands_ memory loss_ and slowed reaction time but now I'm on 50 mg and I have extremem fatigue.

32, 1, Migraine,Initially:tingling in hands and feet_ nausea_ insomnia_ difficulty finding words_ spelling and completing basic math computation_ loss of appetite_ change of taste and smells.  Tingling and nausea eventually subsided.  After approx 8 weeks: Hair loss.,Though this drug was difficult to adjust to_ I stuck it out.  The nausea was extreme in the beginning_ but did eventually subside after a few weeks.  I woke up at 4:30 every morning and could not get back to sleep.  It did stop my daily migraines that I was suffering from.  After about a month_ I felt great_ despite the mental cloudiness that was difficult to manage.  For example_ I struggled to remember driving routes I had traveled for years.  I decided it was a trade-off I was willing to make.  Unfortunately_ one day I noticed my hair texture had changed.  My normally thick_ shiny_ manageable hair became dry and brittle.  Then the shedding started_ approximately 2 months after I began taking the medicine.  I tried to stick it out_ but I lost close to 50% of my hair in the 2 weeks that followed.  I discontinued.  I have now been off the drug for a month_ and my hair is still shedding and there has been little improvement in texture.  I am hopeful that my hair will grow back_ but this has been very stressful.  My headache specialist has prescribed Zonegran as an alternative_ but I am weary of anything now_ especially because a month off of the medication has resulted in little improvement on the hair loss front.,F,39,2  months50 mg qd,12/15/2015,Topamax

I went from having daily migraines to about 1 a month. What I thought was typical depression spiraled into the worst feelings ever_ hopelessness_ anxiety attacks and constant fatigue. As the months passed it all got worse. So far I've dropped about 22 pounds_ and I cry for no reasons at times. My hair began thinning horribly about 7 months into taking the med. I've had my vision checked_ all is well. I take 50 mg each night but I've decided to go off the med due to the negative side effects. It helped my migraines so much which is the only plus. It's been a little over 1 year and these effects have intensified GREATLY. I rarely sleep peacefully. Time for a change!,F,25,1  years50mg,12/10/2015,Topamax
35, 4, Migraines,Cannot drink any carbonated beverages due to horrible taste_ lost about 12 pounds in the very beginning which I think is due to switching from soda to water.,Topamax has really helped with my migraines_ I was shocked to see all the terrible side effects on here. My boyfriend_ his mom_ aunt and my mom all take Topamax for various reasons and none of us have had any of these serious side effects. I think if you do start to have some side effects to mention it to your Dr. because every body is different and tolerates medication differently.,F,24,6  months100 1X D,11/29/2015,Topamax

39, 2, Neuropathy,Confusion_ dizziness,Topamax did nothing for neuropathy. Side effects subsided to a tolerable level in under a month.

43, 4, Alcohol dependence and Bi-polar II,Tingling in feet_ word retrieval issues_ fatigue_ weight loss,Topamax helped curb my cravings for alcohol tremendously. It was as if I hadn't ever even drank. It also helped stabilize my moods and make better decisions beyond just not drinking. Unfortunately I had to stop taking it due to a liver issue that wasn't related to topamax. (Ironic to stop drinking and have your liver go to hell!)

Wondering if people losing weight from not having interest in eating/drinking those things again??? I don't regularly eat them but still hoping for the weight lost selling point *cough*cough* side effect.. I am almost positive that the increased frequency & loose stool is associated with high carb or high sugar intake on this medicine (again does this factor into weight loss).

55, 1, Migraines,Terrible all the way around. I started at the 25 mg dose. I took it at night. In the day I was so sick I didn't even think of food. My head felt full and strange. When I increased the dose to 50mg_ oh my!!! I had panic attacks. I would wake up at night and my head_ the inside would feel ice cold. Sometimes_ my whole body felt that same coldness. Felt unnaturally afraid about everything. I felt like my husband stopped loving me. All sorts of thoughts with no basis.I Was even more sick at the 50 mg. I felt drugged and was rendered unable to function. Worst drug EVER!!!!I,,F,42,2  weeks50 MG,9/27/2015Email,Topamax

I can finally function without the worry of having migraines stopping me in my tracks constantly it's been fantastic_ I haven't had any of the awful side effects thankfully only a massive reduction in migraines usually only have an odd one break through now which really is life changing for me. So thankful to these meds.,F,31,9  months100mg 2x,9/23/2015Email,Topamax
57, 3, mood stabilizer,Loved the gradual effortless weightloss.  Bothered by the difficulty of finding words....Horrified by the hairloss.  I stopped the drug because i didn't want to lose more weight.  Took me 3 years to figure out it had caused my gradual thinning/loss of 1/3 - 1/2 of hair.  I believe the hair loss is a widespread side effect which is greatly under reported by patients and the drug companies.  It is so gradual yet steady many do not notice it or think it is due to aging..Everybody I know and patients I know (I am a RN) who are on this drug lose a large amount of hair.  I see the hair on their pillows....Though I would like to go back on it and lose 10 lbs_ I will not because of the hairloss.,,F,58,9  months100 1X D,9/19/2015,Topamax

I haven't wanted to get out of bed for days I've felt so anxious and my head feels like it's going to explode.
