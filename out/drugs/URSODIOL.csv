0, 5, PBC,None,Life saver!  Recently had a liver biopsy and it has totally stopped any liver damage. Went from stage 1 or 2 (don't recall) to stage zero!   When I was diagnosed in the 1980s I was told I would have to have a transplant in approximately 7 years.   There is no cure for PBC_ but the goal is to slow/stop the progression.  Ursodiol did that for me.,F,71,23  days300 3X D,4/30/2012Email,Ursodiol
