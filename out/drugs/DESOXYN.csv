0, 1, Didn't take it,"This drug is highly neurotoxic (brain damaging). I laughed when one of the reviews here claimed Desoxyn is nothing at all like Meth. Desoxyn is pure dextromethamphetamine_ the most potent and damaging stimulant known to mankind. It is more potent than Crystal Meth bought on the street (which usually contains a mixture of the weaker levomethamphetamine). Sorry_ but Meth is  the most neurotoxic recreational drug known to mankind even in very small doses. Iif you have taken this drug you have brain damage. Ask your doctor about this. Also type in ""Meth and brain damage"" or ""Methamphetamine neurotoxicity"" if you want to read about it yourself.",Adderall_ Vyvanse and Dexedrine are also neurotoxic (brain damaging) but to a lesser degree. They only destroy your dopamine neurons while Meth also fries your serotonin neurons. Ritalin_ Concerta and Focalin are non-neurotoxic and relatively safe for the brain.,M,30,  1X D,10/26/2015,Desoxyn
1, 5, ADHD/Bulimia,No side effect what so ever!! Unless you include not being able to binge & purge,Desoxyn is the best and smoothest ADHD/Eating disorder med there is!! The only down fall is having to take it so many times a day because they don't make extended. I have a new counselor closer to where I live now and he doesn't want to prescribe it because of it's generic name! It is ridiculous!! It is nothing like the street drug meth_ nothing at all!! It helped me live a normal life and feel completely like myself and completely stopped my bulimia!! Now I am having to try all these horrible other meds again that don't work. They just give me headaches and make me feel weird. They wear off quickly and then I feel like I am starving_ even though I have eaten and just want to stuff my face again. Right now we are trying Vyvanse..... I understand it has worked for some but does nothing for me but give me headaches and make me feel uncomfortable. We need to spread the word so that Desoxyn becomes more common and used more!!,F,45,8  years10 5X D,4/10/2014Email,Desoxyn
2, 5, ADHD,This is absolutely the best medication for ADhD . It literally does not produce any side effect or atLeast does not forMe. It works very smooth. does not cause me to have headaches or effect anything_ but helps me  organize my life great . Without _ I amALiteral mess and I amTried to take  all of them . focal in is the only other than somewhat does the job in short  lengths . The price of this med will cause one tonfall over Andy insurance does not cover . 60 tabs of 5mg is an bag of $384 and the generic is roughly $315. This wouldMakeMost scattered brained  just to add this bill every month . I can barely afford this and crazy they have elevated the price this much_ especially when not too many take the med andMost doctors are scared to prescribe . It's a literally conspiracy . Lol . But really ! Wish would lower or find a match for the med .,,F,44,10  years5mg,5/16/2013Email,Desoxyn
3, 5, ADHD,Slight annoyance when dose wears off as ADHD symptoms return,"This is by far the best ADHD medication out there.  Little to no side effects_ and no ""push"" like with other amphetamines or ritalin.  Desoxyn simply allows me to manage my thoughts in an orderly fashion like a normal person_ which in turn allows me to get things accomplished which were previously almost impossible.  I fear that due to the social stigma of meth_ this medication may one day be phased out which would not be good for my mental health.  Also the cost of this medication has risen by about 1000% in the past two decades.",M,27,5  years7.5 mg 1X D,7/23/2012,Desoxyn
4, 3, ADHD,Mild Bruxism & short temper for 1-2hrs at end of day after last dose wears off. Adhd symptoms come back quickly and a little worse too. They don't make an extended release version (at least in US) so if I'm late on my 2nd or 3rd dose of the day my adhd comes back worse than normal and that makes it harder to remember to take the missed dose (like a vicious cycle) which is why I only rate it a 3. Would be a 4 if it was extended release.,Works for me with concentration and motivation but doesn't help me transition between tasks very well. Dr. added welbutrin and together I can muster up motivation and keep up the concentration to stick with tasks and transition between tasks. Wish I would have had it in college. Tried provigil_ ritalin (immediate release & concerta)_ adderall (immediate release and extented)_ Straterra and dexedrine with little to no noticable benefits. I was so desparate that I tried to convince my Dr to give an Rx for catapres since the stimulants helped only a little and the other meds not at all_ but he suggested desoxyn_ and I'm glad he did. Note: If you have narcolepsy & adhd - Doesn't work as good for narcolepsy as the provigil did for me_ but it still does work.,M,45,4.5  years10mg 3X D,5/4/2011,Desoxyn
5, 5, Concentration issues,None_ except decreased appetite (which is good when you've taken zyprexa and risperdal).,I think it is great for concentration. I take it for concentration issues due to psychosis/schizophrenia. I also take Seroquel 700mg_ Cymbalta 120mg_ Anafranil 100mg_ and Klonopin. It's expensive_ but I believe they have started making a generic again. Highly recommended.,F,17,2  months10 MG 1X D,6/3/2010Email,Desoxyn
6, 5, ADHD,"Always thirsty_ sometimes I feel a little tired or ""zoned out""","In comparison to all of the other ADHD meds (I have tried most of them) this one has significantly fewer side-effects and is far better in serving its purpose.  It doesn't make you ""hyperfocus"" on whatever it is you're doing_ like Adderall and Ritalin tend to do; rather_ it allows you to prioritize and successfully fulfill your obligations.",F,24,6  years,12/16/2009,Desoxyn

8, 3, Severe primary hypersomnia,Feel like my emotions are out of control_ easily tearful_ easily frustrated/agitated; very dry mouth and bad taste like I've been sucking on chalk; nausea; headache; loss of appetite. Big stima attached to taking this drug. I had a bad experience at one pharmacy where they treated me like I was a criminal or an addict or something.,I really want this medication to work since Dexedrine and Ritalin no longer do but I am not sure I can handle the side effects. It takes a bit longer than Dexedrine to kick in but keeps me much more alert and awake than Dexedrine. Also_ it did not cause heart palpitations like Dexedrine did. I could never figure out the equivalent dose. I was taking 17.5 mg of Dexedrine twice a day. It seemed like 10 mg of Desoxyn seemed about right but I wasn't sure.,F,40,2  weeks,4/5/2009,Desoxyn

10, 5, sleeping to much,Desoxyn works well_ there are times that it takes days before it really works.,Desoxyn is high priced. Would like to know of a cheaper place to get them.,F,44,3  days,3/3/2008Email,Desoxyn
11, 5, Narcolepsy,None this drug has much better life duration. Two years on the same dose. Off for one month. Once more works like a charm. Much better than any other stimulant medicine. Never thought about upping the dose. For me a wonder drug.,Yes I did test positive for meth. After showing the script she had to say sorry.,M,45,4  years,5/21/2007,Desoxyn

13, 4, Idiopathic Hypersomnia,It has caused my hands to shake a lot and dry mouth.  Muscles in my body twitch and jerk when I lie down but I'm not sure what that's from.,Desoxyn has helped me stay awake in the daytime when nothing else would.  Insurance won't cover it (or Ritalin_ Adderall_ Provigil) and it's $450 for a month so I think I am going to stop it and see how I do.,M,48,3  months,6/3/2005Email,Desoxyn
14, 5, ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER,PERSONALLY I DIDNT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE SIDE AFFECTS FROM THE MEDICATION,IN 1999 I COMITTED A CRIME_ AS A RESULT I WAS PLACED ON PROBATION. IVE TAKEN A VARIETY OF MEDICATION THROUGH OUT THE YEARS BEGINING AT THE AGE OF 8_IVE EXPIERMENTED WITH SUCH MEDICATIONS AS CYLERT_RITALIN_ADDERAL_DEXIDREN_ THEN LAST I WAS PRESCRIBED_ DESOXYN I FINALLY FOUND THE MISSING LINK_ SO TO SPEAK_ MY LIFE WAS FINALLY MAKING SENCE. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT_ WHILE I WAS ON PROBATION_I WAS GIVEN A DRUG SCREEN_ THE RESULTS WERE POSITIVE FOR METHAMPHETAMINE_ I HAD A LETTER FROM MY PSYCHATRIST_STATING DESOXYN WOULD CAUSE A METH POSITIVE_MY PROBATION OFFICER READ THE LETTER_PUT ME IN HANDCUFFS AND SAID TELL IT TO THE JUDGE. I STAYED IN THE COUNTY JAIL FOR 3 MONTHS WITH OUT BOND_ WAITING FOR MY HEARING_ AND THE OUT COME OF MY HEARING WAS MY PROBATION WAS REVOKED AND I WAS SENT TO ALABAMA STATE PRISON (JULIA TUTWEILER PRISON FOR WOMEN) I WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON AUGUST 5 2003_ I WAS FINALLY RELEASED AND BACK WITH MY FAMILY JANUARY 7 2005. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE ALL THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON_ AND MABY ONE DAY THAT WILL BE REVEALED. THE LORD IS THE HEAD OF MY LIFE_ AND I THANK HIM FOR BRINGING ME BACK TO MY FAMILY. IM CURRENTLY PRESCRIBED RITALIN AND TAKE IT AS I SHOULD_ AS FOR THE DESOXYN ....... WELL NOTHING ELSE COMPARES_IN MY OPINION ITS BY FAR THE BEST MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD. AND MABY AS MORE PEOPLE BECOME AWARE OF ITS BENIFITS_ THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO BE SO CRITICAL . THANK YOU & GOD BLESS,F,35,3  months,1/11/2005Email,Desoxyn
