0, 5, Colonoscopy,Mild cramps,Taste is OK_ vaguely salty and citrusy like a margarita.  It worked fast_ and evacuation lasted about 3 hours_ I was able to sleep through the night and got up at six am for my second dose. Honestly_ not eating for 36 hours was the worst part of the prep.,M,51,2  days1 liter 1X D,6/2/2016,Moviprep

3, 4, taking for the pillcam,Side effect was severe headache the day after taking the prep that lasted 3 days .,The taste is disgusting _ but it does the job of clearing your bowels .I am on codeine based pills for back problems that I had to stop taking 3 days before taking the moviprep_this may have contributed  to the headaches .,F,46,1  days1 litre mi,1/29/2016,Moviprep

5, 1, Colonoscopy,Nausea_ extreme headache_ vomiting,"This stuff is absolutely foul.  The instructions were to take the first jug at 6pm till 7pm.  After finishing it_ I felt nauseous.  The second round began at 11pm and I could not get more than 1/4 of it down.  The stuff did not ""kick in"" at all.  At 1am_ I woke up to vomit violently.  This continued for another 4 1/2 hours.  The first bowel movement occurred over 8 hours after drinking it.  Needless to say_ the colonoscopy did not happen as my body revolted against this stuff.  More than 24 hours after drinking it_ I'm still going.",F,53,1  daysUnsure 2X AN,6/5/2015,Moviprep
6, 5, colonoscopy,Chills....thirst.... while taking.   Continued loose bowels three days later.,Petty bad taste but chilling helped s lot.  Started working within minutes.  Even though not a pleasant experience all in all not as bad as in years past.,M,62,1  days,4/10/2015,Moviprep
7, 2, sigmoidoscopy,"Horrible taste. 2 hours before it worked. Terrible abdominal  pain and bloating. Thought intestines would explode. Very sore backside. Continued to work for over 3 hours ! Scared to go to sleep. Now 1 week later still in pain and have been told it has caused intestinal inflammation. Did not have this before. Now on painkillers and told it ""should settle within a week or two"". Will never take this again or anything like it.",1st and definitely last time anyone does this to me. Feel so ill a week later. Has ruined a whole week and no end to it yet. Sorry for anyone who has to take this and amazed some say this is better than other stuff.,F,57,1  days 1X D,3/30/2015,Moviprep
8, 4, Colonscopy,Minor cramping,Took the split dose.  1 1/2 hours till it worked for the first dose.  And it keeps working for about an hour_ off and on.  40 minutes for the next days dose.  Didn't completely clean colon as well as using a single dose in past_ go figure.  Anyway_ everyone is right_ the prep is worse than the test.  I don't even get sedated_ it's a simple procedure with minor discomfort.,M,67,2  days1 Liter 1X D,6/30/2014,Moviprep
9, 5, Colonoscopy prep,None.,I took this for my fourth colonoscopy_ and it's the easiest prep I've used yet. Less to drink_ works within an hour_ and does what it's meant to do. I took a split dose--a quart the night before and a quart early the morning of the procedure. Look_ they all taste awful_ but get it ice cold_ gulp it through straws_ and suck on lollipops between gulps (clears the taste from your mouth best). And realize that you're going to have one day of discomfort to know you don't have colon cancer or_ if you do_ hopefully it'll be caught early. It's an ugly way to go_ folks.,F,53,2  days 1X D,3/19/2013Email,Moviprep
10, 1, Colonoscopy,Awful taste.  Gagging and vomiting,,F,45,1  days,2/21/2013,Moviprep
11, 5, Colonoscopy,None.,This was my 4th colonoscopy and the best prep I've used.  In fact_ it's the only one I was able to drink without gagging.  Yes_ it tastes pretty bad_ but I chilled it and used a straw and I was surprised that I could get it down without gagging or nausea.  Also_ I wasn't as dehydrated as usual when I finished the process.  I took sips of apple juice after every few slugs_ and kept a lemon drop handy to get rid of the taste.  I also drank about 2 liters of water/apple juice after each liter (with my doc's permission).I have scopes every 5 years now because of my family histor_ and although I don't look forward to the prep_ it's always great to get the procedure behind me.  Better than cancer.,F,61,1  days1 liter 2X D,8/16/2012,Moviprep

14, 5, Colonoscopy,None,In three colonoscopies this is the best prep I've used.  Why?  First_ there was less drinking to be done.  Second_ the bowel action comes fast ... 10 minutes or so after downing the solution.  You finish quickly too_ about 20 minutes or so after the bowel movements start.,M,55,1  days 1X D,6/6/2011,Moviprep
15, 1, Colonoscopy,Disgusting taste_ deeper hole in wallet,Moviprep tastes disgusting!!  I could not even finish the first 8oz. I did a little research on the internet and turns out Moviprep is the same thing as Miralax and then some added electrolyts.  I went to the store bought the equivilent amount of miralax and some grape flavored propel.  Worked like a charm and was soooo much cheaper than the Moviprep.,F,25,  1X D,9/28/2010,Moviprep
