5, 5, Bipolar Disorder,TD symptoms occassionally.,Helps with anxiety a great deal.  I sometimes take up to 400 mg a day_ but find that if I do take this much_ I get the TD symptoms.  Thus_ I try not to take more than the 200mg a day even though the doctor prescribes enough to take 4 times a day.  This medication has helped me a lot.  The doctor tried to talk me into taking it for a couple years before I finally agreed to try it.  My recommendation is to give it a try.  If the side effects outweigh the benefits_ then don't take it.  If it helps_ then why not?,M,43,2  years100mg 2X D,2/5/2015,Thorazine

21, 1, attempt to help with depression,was having migraines at the same time & was being given compazine for that nausea.  All of a sudden_ I couldn't walk or even coordinate my hands to feed myself.  Went to ER & they realized initially that compazine causes these parkinson like symptoms.  They stopped the compazine immediately but didn't realize that the thorazine was also causing the parkinson like symptoms which was why the symptoms didn't go away after stopping just the compazine.  It took over a month & going to a neurologist for him to realize that the continued parkinson symptoms were being caused by the thorazine even after stopping the compazine.  Both meds cause these symptoms & after both were stopped it took about another month for the symptoms to go away.  I couldn't coordinate my hands & needed help just to walk.  I couldn't even walk myself into the bathroom so had to wait for my husband to get home from work just to go to the bathroom.  It took so long for the Dr's to realize the symptom,I was on the combination for about 6+ months before the symptoms just immediately showed up.  It didn't even help with the depression & high anxiety level that I was having so it definitely wasn't worth the side effects.,F,46, ,2/16/2007,Thorazine
