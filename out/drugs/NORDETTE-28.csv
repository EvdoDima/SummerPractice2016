47, 5, ,none,I was on othro-tri cyclin (sp?)_ then othro-tri cyclin-lo (sp?) -- both gave me horrible migraines every single month on the dot at 2 days into the inactive sugar pills and right before my period would start.  Nordette was the cure.  No headaches_ no unusual weight gain (went off to college... maybe a freshman 5lbs...)_ and my moods are as steady as they would be around my period without being on birth control.  Sex drive is still good.  If your doctor says it's a good option_ don't just write it off because of the complaints here.  I've been pretty pleased.,F,22,5  years,10/10/2009,Nordette-28

49, 5, Birth Control,Maybe lack of sex drive,I have been on Nordette for 9 years and I thought it was great as I had side effects from early BC. I came off it and went on to Yasmin to see if the pill was the cause for my lacking sex drive. I had a very healthy sex drive and I thought being on the pill for so long may have diminished that. To my astonshment Yasmin has caused horrib;e headaches for me so I'm going back to Nordette. It works for me.

50, 1, Birth Control,depression_ mood swings_ irrationality_ low self-esteem_ uncontrollable crying_ intense anger,"I started taking this pill soon after the birth of my 3rd child. I became depressed_ unable to think rationally_ crying uncontrollably and for little or no reason_ feelings of worthlessness. I was in what was a happy relationship that was quickly turning toxic with screaming matches over nothing and threats on both sides to leave. I assumed I had PND and was prescribed Zoloft for 3 months which improved the symptoms but left me feeling slightly numb and ""disconnected"". I came off Zoloft and was right back where I started. I actually googled Bi-polar because I was starting to think I was. After a few years of this (I can't believe it didn't dawn on me faster) I thought that it may be pill related. I stopped taking the pill 4 weeks ago and can't believe how much better I feel! All the symptoms have gone. I can discuss ""issues"" with loved ones in a calm and rational manner. Small diasppointments don't send me spiralling down into black_ oppressive thought patterns that used to take days to surface from. I can honestly say that after years of this I will never take another BCP again!",F,37,4  years,5/8/2009,Nordette-28

This is the only pill I've ever been on that didn't make me fat_ or moody_ and I still have most of my sex drive!!!  I think that every pill decreases it to some degree_ but I feel very close to normal on this one.,I found out that I had lymphoma_ and I had to have chemo_ and the doctor said that going on the pill would help to protect my ovaries from the chemo because of the extra dose of hormones.  I tried Portia (the generic form of nordette) and I love it!!  Chemo is over_ and I haven't stopped taking this pill_ just because I really like it.  It has no side effects that I've noticed_ other than a very slightly decreased sex drive.  After having two bad experiences with birth control pills_ I'm very happy to have found one that works for me!,F,27,1  years,12/22/2008,Nordette-28
