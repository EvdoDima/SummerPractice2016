47, 5, ,none,I was on othro-tri cyclin (sp?)_ then othro-tri cyclin-lo (sp?) -- both gave me horrible migraines every single month on the dot at 2 days into the inactive sugar pills and right before my period would start.

49, 5, Birth Control,Maybe lack of sex drive,I have been on Nordette for 9 years and I thought it was great as I had side effects from early BC.

To my astonshment Yasmin has caused horrib;e headaches for me so I'm going back to Nordette. It works for me.

I became depressed_ unable to think rationally_ crying uncontrollably and for little or no reason_ feelings of worthlessness. I was in what was a happy relationship that was quickly turning toxic with screaming matches over nothing and threats on both sides to leave. I assumed I had PND and was prescribed Zoloft for 3 months which improved the symptoms but left me feeling slightly numb and ""disconnected"". I came off Zoloft and was right back where I started. I actually googled Bi-polar because I was starting to think I was. After a few years of this (I can't believe it didn't dawn on me faster) I thought that it may be pill related. I stopped taking the pill 4 weeks ago and can't believe how much better I feel! All the symptoms have gone. I can discuss ""issues"" with loved ones in a calm and rational manner. Small diasppointments don't send me spiralling down into black_ oppressive thought patterns that used to take days to surface from.

I think that every pill decreases it to some degree_ but I feel very close to normal on this one.,I found out that I had lymphoma_ and I had to have chemo_ and the doctor said that going on the pill would help to protect my ovaries from the chemo because of the extra dose of hormones.  I tried Portia (the generic form of nordette) and I love it!!  Chemo is over_ and I haven't stopped taking this pill_ just because I really like it.  It has no side effects that I've noticed_ other than a very slightly decreased sex drive.

It didn't bother me too much but if it got much worse I would have switched.  other than that this pill is great.  no side effects.  I only had to switch because my university didn't carry Nordette and dispensed Portia instead.  TERRIBLE!  I had breakthrough bleeding on Portia from day 10 of the new pill pack straight through my period.  The pharmacists said I was the first one who'd had this problem with Portia_ so maybe it is a formulation difference that I am sensitive to.
