0, 4, HIV,I too had very very odd dreams for the first few years_ but those subsided.  I feel now I have these brief images that appear to me (nanoseconds only) as I am almost awake. I cannot shake the images or stop them.  Anyone else?Yes_ I think I'm finally acknowledging some depression as well possibly due to the drug.,Medically_ I'm fond of Sustiva. My counts have been stellar for years on it and I'm slightly afraid to change medications due to how well they work_ but the mental aspect lately has got me on edge.,M,49,12  years300 1X D,10/8/2012Email,Sustiva
1, 1, HIV,Day terrors_ depression_ suicidal ideation and hallucinations.,The POS that approved this drug had greed in their cold hearts. Having been on HIV meds continuously since 1996_ I have taken a lot of poison but this one takes the cake. ,F,57,18  days 1X O,9/8/2012,Sustiva

5, 1, In Atripla_ for HIV,"Just awful.  Wooziness about 2 hrs after taking pill at 10 p.m. Jerkawakes all night long.  Intense_ very ""physical"" dreams-sometimes very bad-like struggling with a twining vine or a maelstrom.  On the contrary_ if I have had even a slightest adrenalin rush a bit before bedtime (say_ an unpleasant phone conversation) I might end up not being able to sleep for hours.  (Have never had sleep problems in my whole life).  Now I sleep 10+ hours regularly when I needed only 8 or less before.  If I get less than that_ I feel tired all day and might have to take a long nap in the middle of the day.  Wooziness occurs quite often-sometimes way into the day.  This might be accompanied by twitching eyelids etc  For three weeks now_ I have also been having a very worrisome ache on my right shoulder joint.","I am coming to the conclusion that it might not be worth the while.  Have been ""toughening"" it out hoping side effects would go away.  But it has been getting worse.",M,46,3  months,10/1/2009,Sustiva
6, 5, hiv,vivid dreams for first few weeks but these subsided,works well_ counts are great,M,46,3  years,8/2/2009,Sustiva
7, 5, HIV,Absolutely great... feeling much better after 3 years of this. The psychedelic dreams etc. are OK too.,,M,47,3  years,5/4/2009,Sustiva
8, 4, ,initially intense kaleidiscopic psychadelic dreams_ that phase lasted a couple weeks. definatly depersonalization slightly not myself strange. mildly agoaraphobic.,,,, ,8/8/2008,Sustiva
9, 3, HIV+,Normal side effects mentioned.  No problems with my stomach_ but I simply could not get restful sleep.  The vivid dreams were simply too much for me and it affected my overall quality of life so I changed from Atripla (single pill Sustiva and Truvada) to Truvada and Reyataz.,If you can get over the side effects (more minor in some people -- more serious in others) the convenience of the single pill Atripla is a godsend.  I am happy with the change ... my CD4 count is over 400 for the first time in years and VL continues to be undetectable.  Fight the fight!,M,37,18  months,7/7/2008,Sustiva
10, 4, First-line treatment for HIV1,"Combined with Combivir for HAART.This has proved effective!Nearly 3 years on treatment... never missed a dose.I take Sustiva and Combivir in the MORNING_as opposed to the ""recommendation"" to take Sustivaat night. That way I only have to be concerned withtaking ONE pill in the evening... (Combivir).It's easier when you're in social situations.(...was that a Tylenol? ) ( Yeah_ I get headaches...)Okay... Side effects? Sure_ there are some.When you first start Sustiva_ expect to get wierd rashesin various spots around your body.Don't freak out about it... in several weeks it'llcompletely stop. ( It did in my case ).You will continue to have extreme dreams duringthe coure of this treatment!...They are not unpleasant... just very vivid...very strange.Fatigue and/or grogginess usually follows about an hourto an hour-and-a-half after taking Sustiva.Fight through it or take a brief nap to deal with it.My CD4 has stayed above 200_ and my VL is",If you start on this (or any) treatmentprescribed by your Inf.Dis. Doctors...STAY WITH IT 100%!It can fail EASILY if you neglect your dosages.The results are worth any discomfort or inconveniencesyou might endure.,M,50,33  months,5/23/2008,Sustiva
11, 4, AIDS/HIV,I have been on Atripla (sustiva & tuvada_ one pill)for a little more than 3 weeks. The first 2 weeks were not good. I couldn't see_ had crazy dreams_ couldn't stand_ felt hot_ sweating and anxiety. I even threw up one morning. After the 2nd week I started feeling better and everything cleared up. I feel fine now. My lymph nodes in my neck were swollen for years and now they aren't. My CD4 is 194 and wont know if its working for another 6 weeks but I know its working well. Last week I did have a bad rash (shingles) and it was very pain full. I am taking antibiotics and its starting to feel better. The shingles also affected my nerves on the left side of my body but taking something else for nerve pain. God Bless Us! 	,Give it some time and I think you'll get used to it. Atripla is only one pill a day at bed time. I take it at 11:00 pm and usually go to bed after 12. After an hour you will feel VERY high and drugged. Stay away from Wendy's chili because I ate it one night before taking the meds and had hallucinations for 2 hours.,M,28,3  weeks,3/26/2008,Sustiva
12, 3, HIV Aids,Horrible vivid dreams/Dizzy/reality disconnect/Panic...After going on paxil_ immediate difference. I can now handle it.,I think the combination of my body adjusting and taking paxil which changed me immediately. Hope it works for meDiagnosed on 10/3/07,M,53,40  days,12/2/2007Email,Sustiva
13, 1, a key ingredient in Atripla,At first_ Vivid hallucinations and stomach pains. Exotic dreams (enjoyable). Inability to walk from dizziness. One night I had severe night sweats. Continual stomach acid and pains. I stopped when I developed a full body blistering rash. My ears swelled almost shut. This rash continued even after stopping medication. It was a living horror.,I have heard good reports about this drug_ but I had a very scary experience. I have led a very good lifestyle. Nearly vegetarian and excercise 5x a week. I would regard myself as sensitive to medications. I have had allergies to Pennicillain and had a rash reaction. I hope this will resonate with someone. This drug is extremely intense worse than I have ever experienced.,M,37,11  days,11/13/2007,Sustiva
14, 1, hiv,like everyone else _ dizziness _ anxious _ insomnia sometimes _ now after 4 months i have a head that feels plugged something like flu symptom _ thats it i won't take it tonight .I'll contact a doctor to chaange meds. I hate the malais feeling in the morning.,screw this. If anyone knows of hiv treatment combination thats allows a person to feel more normal please email me at restart49@hotmail.com  Thanks in advance,M,52,5  months,10/26/2007Email,Sustiva
15, 4, HIV Infection,Slightly drunk feeling about an hour after taking the pill.  Really best to take it at bed time.  (Also taking Combivir),Works very well - CD4 went from 78 to 355 in 9 months!  VL remains undetectible,M,38,1  years,5/18/2007,Sustiva
16, 1, HIV Combination Therapy,The dizziness and dreams others describe were mild for me_ but it triggered a period of severe depression.  I nearly quit my job and had problems with my relationships with partner and friends.More frightening is that the depression lasted for months after I was off the drug.  While I do have a family history of depression I have been free of it for years before Sustiva.  I have a good life_ a good attitude_ and have maintained a very positive outlook for years.  Sustiva crashed that.  I was on the drug for 3 months and the depression lasted 5 - 6.,This stuff is poision.  From the experiences of people I know the psychological side-effects are significantly understated.  Unless this is your last-chance drug_ just say NO!,M,43,3  months,1/26/2007,Sustiva
17, 2, hiv+,went through the beginning of side effects dizzy_ etc. after 5 weeks now I feel very anx. irr. and more in the morning and all day I don't know if this is going to go away. I feel worst then never starting this. I can't sleep soundly either. I as of now need to speak to my Dr. about it for this continues I will want off it. I will not take one tonight and skip it. Am too afraid of this horror feeling. Not sure what Im feeling but feeling crazy.,I do not recommend even though it is prolly less side effects then most_ but no quality of life I don't feel.,M,52,5  weeks,1/25/2007,Sustiva
18, 1, first Therapy drug combination,The initial feeling of being high and dizzy subseeded after a while but my dreams were often too vivid and unpleasant. If there is any reason that REM sleep is increased with more dream periods_ then there may also be less restoring deep sleep_ or so called Phase 4.  After 3 months I had to stop the drug. I felt sad_ anxious_ irritable and very weak. After 20 years and no need of meds_ I felt worse than when I started. after 2 days I feel already better_ happier_ can concentrate_ have more appetite and much much more energy.,It didn't work for me at all_ I definitely felt that the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier but it felt like it was altering my mind and my mental well being,M,42,3  months,8/2/2006,Sustiva
19, 4, HIV+,Vivid dream phenomenon isn't too bad - actually_ no worse than my normal dreams except I do seem to remember them better since taking Sustiva. A bit loopy/dizzy first thing in the morning but that seems to be going away the longer I take it.,Switched to Sustiva/Truvada from Kaletra/Combivir due to a resistance.,M,35,4  weeks,3/24/2006Email,Sustiva
20, 5, hiv,"None.... if any a slight..... VERY slight sense of feeling ""high"" but that would only last 1 hour....     (am on sustiva/truvada - the best for me....)",After the 4th night of takikng it - i've not had that feeling again_ nor have i had any other side affects..    Ironically i was looking forward to some of the lucid dreaming...  but i struck out even there.... all in all_ i just want to thank the stars for this one_ since after only 4 mos_ i am undetectable and my cd4s are climbing high....,M,29,1  years,3/2/2006,Sustiva
21, 5, 5,None :)   Crixovan was making me sick!,Simple to take_ lowered VL to under 50_ and raised CD4 to 880 now :),M,39,4  years,1/15/2006,Sustiva
22, 4, hiv+,Taken with Combivir.Drunken_ dizzy feeling in thr first month.No nightmares.,Occasional anxiety that might not be related to medication.CD4 went from 130 to 400. Hiv virus undetectable.,M,46,15  months,11/7/2005,Sustiva
23, 2, High Viral Load -infected 9mos,I've only been on Sustiva for 4 weeks now and the side effects are getting worse.  I have to take it twelve hours before work to prevent problems with concentration in the morning. The hang over effect is not pleasant. Most troubling is what happens about 2.5 hours after taking the pill. The room will rock_ my ears ring loudly_ I feel very intoxicated_ and weak. I'm fine during the day. And then around 5pm I get very irritable. I take the pill between 7 and 8 pm.  A sleeping pill is very necessary for a full night of rest.,I'm hoping this all subsides in a week or two. If not_ I'm going to ask to be taken off it.  I'd rather take a pill more than once a day than experience this decreased quality of life. Time will tell.  I can't imagine what the long term effects are.,M,39,4  weeks,5/27/2005Email,Sustiva
24, 3, HIV+; hated Crixivan!,Unbelievable nigthmares; drunken/dizzy feeling (which is kinda nice); sleep deprovation.,All in all_ Sustiva is my drug of choice.  I used to take at night and usually had food with it.  Just found out that food enables the side effects.  Now taking in the morning on an empty stomach and not too bad.  I am sleeping better but have a hang over feeling which seems to pass with a good cup of java.,M,44,3  years,4/23/2005Email,Sustiva
25, 1, Crixivan was causing kidney stones,vivid deams_ dizziness_ unable to concentrate especially while reading or driving_ extreme fatigue_ tiredness_ poison ivy-type rashes_ flu-like muscle aches and pains_ overall malaise,I think these side effects greatly outweigh the so-called convenience of a once-a-day drug.  I'd rather suffer the chronic kidney stone attacks.,M,54,17  days,10/27/2004,Sustiva
26, 4, HIV+,Extremely vivid dreams_ nightmares for the first month.  Rash similar to poison-ivy the 2nd week.,,M,34,90  days,10/4/2002,Sustiva
