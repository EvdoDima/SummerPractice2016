1, 1, Chronic insomnia,Did nothing for my insomnia. I slept my usual 4 hours. Awakened with pounding head_ dry mouth_ dizziness_ and nausea. I flushed the rest of the pills and will go back to benadryl and herbal otc sleep aids as my amount and quality of sleep are as bad on trazodone without side effects. Horrible drug. Reinforced why I am loath to take prescription meds.,See above.,F,49,1  days100 mg,6/23/2016,Trazodone hcl
2, 5, For sleeping issues,It gives me a headache at times when I wake up the next morning and sometimes makes me off balance from a sitting to standing position. I have lost 40 lbs due to no appetite and light exercise in a resistance pool. This has helped me tremendously before my quality of life suffered.,I would recommend this medication to people who have severe insomnia. However take it in bed because I have found that it has a fast acting release and if you are not settled down and ready to sleep the medication is not as effective I have found for me.,F,42,4  months150mg x2,6/16/2016Email,Trazodone hcl

22, 1, Sleep_ ease anxiety,Restless legs_ head and eye aches the next day_ dry mouth_ grogginess_ severe nausea.,My doctor prescribed this medication to help me sleep and to hopefully curb my anxiety enough so I would be able to eat well again (my anxiety takes away my appetite and in some cases will not let me eat at all). I took this one night and had the worst side effects of any medicine I've been on--and I've tried a lot. It didn't make me tired_ yet the next day I was extremely groggy. I couldn't eat at all since I was so nauseous. I took a small bite of a muffin and had to spit it out because I felt I was going to throw up. I have a headache advil won't cure and my eyes are sore and tired. I constantly feel like I have to use the bathroom and am quite gassy for some reason. I only took it one night_ but I'm not trying it again. I can't afford these side effects when I'm already having trouble eating and I have a 3 year old child to take care of. I've been basically bedridden the whole day.,F,24,1  days60,11/17/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

25, 1, Sleepliness,I started out taking 50 mg a day at night because I couldn't sleep. I went to sleep easily and slept great. After a while the dosage had to be increased to 100 and then to 150. I suffered from dry mouth and dry eyes terribly. I began to get acid reflux and was put on medication for that. I didn't connect the medication to the acid reflux which kept getting worse. Then I began to experienced racing heart. To the point where I had to go to the dr. And have tests. They concluded that the trazodone was causing the fast heartbeat..and took me off. I went thru hell getting off it. It took months. And then one day I realized that my acid reflux was gone. The stomach bloating was gone. The dry eyes and dry mouth were gone. I still haven't found a solution to my sleep problems but I'll never take trazodone again.,,F,69,3  years150 1X D,9/13/2015Email,Trazodone hcl
26, 4, Chronic insomnia_ depression_ PTSD,My problem with trazodone is my body got extremely use to it which is why I'm at 150mg(and I refuse to go higher). The medicine has honestly helped me so much over the years BUT within the past 2 years it has over the time stopped working for me because I've had to also take OTC sleep aid to assist with the sleeping or even if I did take OTC I still would stay awake and not sleep (granted my insomnia especially as of lately since my grandmother has passed has been acting as if it's insomnia on steroids). Another thing is I only take it at night to sleep - regardless if I've eaten 30 minutes before_ an hour_ or even 3 hours before I get so nauseous when I go to lay down to the point that keeps me awake. I don't know why it is doing this and neither does my doctor.,The thing about trazodone_ it doesn't work for everyone just like any medications. I have been on it for 7 years and only until the last two years I've had problems.,F,24,7  years150,8/29/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

Had to take welbutrin to curb EXTREME anxiety caused by trazadone. (A FEAR like I have never experienced before! I felt like my world was (literally) spinning out of control) I repeat_ DO NOT TAKE TRAZADONE! It will mess up your life! This drug should be taken off the market!,,F,36,8  days50 mg 1X D,7/23/2015Email,Trazodone hcl
28, 1, chronic insomnia,groggy_ low in energy and tired. Shortness of breath_ breathing through my mouth. Somewhat flu like symptoms_ headache it's hard to bear the weight of my head on my body_ dry mouth with chocking sensation and blocked nostrils so I'm breathing through my mouth. Very heavy chest with pounding heart. literally I'm hearing my heart beat from last 26 hours. Oh and I forgot to mention pounding and clog ears.  Back pain_ neck pain and some visual hallucinations.,"I was happily taking Ativan 0.5 mgs from last two years but I asked my doc to give me something else with ""least possible side effects"". I asked because I was having absolute dependency and immunity to Ativan_ so my doctor Rx trazodone stating that it's ""ONLY"" going make me groggy for a few days_ and that's it_ but last night around 9:30 p.m_ and it knocked me out in about 20 minutes. It's good because I don't want insomnia_ but it gave me hangover feelings. I had a very restless night because I woke up several times with thoughts of fear and confusion. My chest was very heavy and I had such a hard time breathing. It's been about 26 hours since I took it but my chest is still very heavy and I am short in breath and continuously breathing through my mouth.  I hardly made it through the day because I was so low in energy and had a foggy mind. Yes my happy bubble has burst and I can't wait to get rid of these side effects.I am not going to take this drug anymore and I won't recommend it to anyone.

29, 1, insomnia,Restlessness_ terror_ anxiety,My experience taking this medication was so awful I have been unable to bring myself to try another medication and it's been over a year. This made me tired. I have never been so exhausted. It made my brain sleepy but gave my body a mind of its own. I could fall asleep for a few minutes then would awaken with the over whelming need to shake my arms. I spent 10hrs sitting in my backyard crying and a good amount of that time; trying to punch my own arms until they fell asleep. I wouldn't wish the experience on my enemies.,F,25,1  days50MG,6/22/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

32, 1, Insomnia_ depression/anxiety,Nasal congestion_ frequent urination_ dizziness_ headache_ bloating_ extreme thirst_ next day grogginess_ sleeplessness_ heartburn,After trying many different medications to treat anxiety and insomnia_ zoloft_ buspar_ hydroxyzine_ klonopin to name a few I had reached a point where nothing was working. (Benzos work well for me_ but my doctor doesn't care to prescribe them often) I had talked to my PCP and asked to try trazodone.  Big mistake. I'm usually a person who can wait out side effects because I know they aren't permanent but the side effects from this medication are some of the worst. The first night i took 50 mg during the day and 100 mg before bed. It did not cause any drowsiness whatsoever. I almost immediately got a pounding headache_ felt extremely dizzy and felt more depressed (slight suicidal idealization) than I have in my life. Once I went to sleep I had continuous nightmares_ and woke up several times to not only go pee_ but to drink water. I would end up drinking about 4 bottles of water in about 25 minutes. I was so thirsty and miserable. However_ once I went back to sleep about 3:30 I didn't wake up until almost 4 pm. No matter how hard I would try to wake up_ I would fall right back asleep. Finally I woke up_ took a shower and felt slightly okay. Still had a headache. The next few times I took it_ I cut my dose down to just 50 mg and it did nothing for my sleep. The dizziness I felt was unreal and never went away. I still feel lightly heavy in the head and I took my dose yesterday at 2 pm. As far as I can tell this medicine has no benefits that are outweighing the bad side effects,F,22,3  days50mg,5/25/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

Around 10pm I took another 50mg tablet. I was absolutely restless in bed tossing and turning. Temperature was screwed up_ kept feeling hotter than usual. Was able to fall asleep for a few hours maybe 3 or 4 until I woke up at 4am. After not being able to fall asleep again I decided I needed to upload my experience. Although this is the first night ive tried it_ I hope it works tomorrow.,M,19,1  days50mg,5/15/2015,Trazodone hcl
35, 5, Insomnia,Can't turn my brain off at night. Barely getting 3rd hrs. Love this med.  Makes me very sleepy in about 20 min. Wake up groggy but two very small cups of coffee wake me right up then feel very energized.  Sleep about 6 hours.. wake up for potty break once but used to wake up every hour.  I think it has helped my nervous bladder. It has made a fantastic difference in getting some quality sleep. You have to give this some time.  Was extremely tired in the beginning but that is much better. I suffer from severe back pain and migraines.  As my neurologist says_ your body cannot heal itself unless you can sleep.

Helps me sleep well for 5 to 6 hours_ thinking of including Melatonin to help sleep longer_ however 6 hours is usually enough to get me through the day well.

40, 2, Sleeping problems,Gas and severe bloating.,Trazodone has helped me sleep. Before taking this medication I was waking up every hour during the nighttime. Since taking trazodone the first night I woke up once (2 hours after falling asleep). The second and third night I woke up twice. I have tried every over the counter sleep aid and I have yet to find any med that has helped this much. Trazodone is wonderful as far as helping with sleep but the gas and severe bloating (120 lbs and workout daily) cause major problems. Trazodone has caused more bloat than I have ever experienced in my life. Also_ I read a few posts on here about individuals experiencing withdrawal symptoms when stopping this med and that worries me. I am not sure if I am going to continue this medication.,F,28,3  days50 mg,5/8/2015Email,Trazodone hcl

57, 5, Insomnia,It has a definite and very welcome appetite suppressant effect on me. I hope that continues; I know for some people it causes weight gain. It also makes me want to sweeten my coffee a lot less; less than half what I did before I started taking it. In addition it has changed my temperature perceptions; I used to get cold during the day and would turn the thermostat up_ then turn it down at night and turn on two fans. I don't need the fans_ and I keep the temperature the same day and night. The downside is that it makes me  very loopy; I have trouble thinking of words and names_ and my spelling has gotten horrible. I can live with that.,It's helping me get to sleep and wake up at normal times_ something I haven't been able to do for more than a year. It's causing me to lose weight; I have to force myself to eat twice a day so I can take my pills (which need to be taken with food). My life is getting progressively saner. I feel like a new person.

61, 2, insomnia,"Decreased coordination_ ""heavy"" feeling in limbs_ irritable mood while sleeping_ lethargy lasting well into next day_ bloating_ gas_ diarrhea_ decreased energy/motivation. I started trazodone two days ago because I have been having trouble sleeping and need to go out of town for training for a new job. I knew this would exaberate my insomnia. I was only looking for a med to take short-term. I tried ambien_ and loved it_ but my doctor will not prescribe any more (I am in suboxone treatment for opiate dependency). When I take this at either recommended dose_ I feel like I got hit by a train the entire next day. A nurse at my dr office said this could take weeks to resolve. If so_ it will be useless to me. I cannot start a new job feeling this way. This med may work well_ eventually_ but if you don't have time for that_ I do not recommend. I still am having trouble sleeping as well. On my own_ I cannot fall asleep til very late - sometimes 8 am. But when I do_ I usually stay asleep. I don't normally remember dreams. With this med_ I wake up every hour or so_ and in all of my dreams I am angry or irritable.

68, 3, Severe Insomnia,Slight nausea and lethargy upon waking_ headaches_ yawning,I was prescribed Trazodone HCL at 50 mg for insomnia_ but it has a bonus of helping with my Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety/Panic Disorder_ which it is actually indicated for.  An also added bonus is that it is not a benzodiazepine (which I have used two types of--Xanax and Restoril)_ but a tricyclic antidepressant_ and is purported to be non-addictive per discussions in an addiction treatment website ( trazodone is used to help addicts cope with withdrawal).  I took Xanax for anxiety/panic attacks but had to taper off of it due to hypotension (withdrawal was PURE AGONY)_ so taking a tricyclic antidepressant is doing well so far.  Thus far at 50 mg_ it is not doing much to help with insomnia_ but I have only taken it for four days_ and good affect is reached at two weeks.  I have been told to take it one hour before going to bed_ but I am going to dose at two hours to see if it will work better.,F,49,4  days50 1X D,5/15/2014,Trazodone hcl

In Dec 2012 I started to have some GI issues (not related to trazodone) and my doctor asked me to have a CAT scan. Results show that I now have a fatty liver (it was normal a year before). My liver enzymes are NOT elevated_ so my doctor is not concerned. He says fatty liver is very common among Hispanics (I am Cuban American) and not to worry.  I have read reports about trazodone and liver toxicity and wonder if anyone else has been diagnosed with fatty liver. My brother has been on trazodone for over 20 years and also has a fatty liver (and is diabetic).

73, 3, Insomnia,None,I was prescribed Trazodone after dealing with a bout of insomnia that required some medical attention. The first few months of taking it_ it did help me fall asleep faster_ but I am not convinced it was just the medication. I think some of it could have been psychological. It never made me feel overly sedated and I could stay up for hours after taking it if I wanted to. A month ago_ I decided I would try to stop using it since I debated whether it actually did much of anything_ and I quit cold turkey. Do not ever do this. The second night without it_ I had what I can only describe as severe panic attacks and sweating_ nausea_ shakes_ etc. I quickly realized it was withdrawal. All the literature I'd read on it said it should not be this severe. Well_ it was. I also did not sleep for four days and would sweat profusely throughout the day. I finally gave in on the fifth day and took it at night and slept for 12 hours. I know to wean off it slowly next time (but for now I am just going to keep taking it).,M,28,1  years50 1X D,3/16/2013Email,Trazodone hcl

83, 5, ,"I requested this because after years on Ambien_ then Ambien CR the past 2 years_ I wanted something that would not need to be increased due to tolerance_ and did not WANT to take Ambien for the addictive reasons which I've had.  I do get a stuffy nose_ and dry mouth_ red eyes_ and have the detailed dreams_ but once I wake up and have my first cup of coffee_ I do feel better!  I definitely helps me sleep better than the Ambien did-although Ambien helped me ""fall asleep"" faster.  My eye doctor put me on Restasis eye drops for the redness (he said he HAD heard of the redness from the Traz) and it helps a little.  All in all I can live with these symptoms knowing that the alternative (and I literally have pretty much tried EVERyTHING for insomnia) is not something I want to live with!  I feel ""free"" for the first time in years not being a slave to Ambien!!!",My Dr told me I could take 1/2 (25 MG) up to 2 (100 MG).  The 100 mg dose cused worse dreams-so I cut it back to 75_ then 50 and even cut a tablet so I was taking 3/4 of a 50 mg tablet.  I get sleep with the smaller dose_ and my dreams are not as bad.

Here we go: dry mouth_ sedation_ improved quality of sleep_ constipation_ increased appetite_ feeling out of it all the next day_ increased libido_ increased frequency and quality of erections and ability to reach orgasm (no complaints about that one)_ dry eyes and occasional minor visual disturbances.  As with most medications_ the side effects are most noticeable at first and when the dose is increased.  The good news is that if you take it easy and go up relatively slowly_ most of these side effects will diminish with the passage of time (although I'm still going up to a max of 600 so I will likely have to deal with them for a while longer every time I increase the dose).,I'm writing this primarily for those that might be researching this drug and are just starting or are considering trying it for depression related conditions.  I asked my doctor to consider it since through my reasearch I learned that it was related to Nefazodone (which I did very well on for years before it was pulled from the Canadian market).  This drug is classified as an SARI (serotonin antagonist reuptake inhibitor)_ which is to say that it is both a serotonin antagonist (a lower doses) and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor at high enough doses.  This makes the way it works different from any other available antidepressant (except for Nefazadone_ which is essentially an improved version of Trazodone that is still available generically in the States (wish it was available in Canada).  It's brand name (Serzone) was discontinued after several less than convicing reports of liver failures requiring transplants ( the risk is something like 1 in 250 000 and I would take it again in a heartbeat). Some of the advantages of Trazodone over much more popular drugs such a Prozac_ Zoloft_ Effexor ect... are that it actuall has no detrimental effect on the quality of sleep (something which the SSRI's and SNRI's definetly mess with).  It has a strong calming feeling so it could be good for certain people who struggle with anxiety and have trouble sleeping (it is not addictive or habit forming).

Since then_ I break my pill in half and take it twenty minutes before i want to sleep. Trazodone works great_ I fall asleep easy and comfortably. Make sure you take this routinely_ if I miss a dose I'm a wreck the next day. This drug is also intended anxiety and depression.

Am taking other meds_ so could be a combination.,Have been taking depression meds for years_ but started having trouble sleeping following a family tragedy.  Have taken different anti-depressants_ but stick to one 50 mg. Trazodone tablet nightly_ and continue to have good results.  I haven't needed to increase the dosage for the same results.  I agree with whomever wrote that you need to go to bed within one hour of taking it_ though.

122, 1, With Prozac_ for sleep,I suffered a terrible sleep paralysis incident after taking ONE 50 mg dose of Pliva Trazodone. Been taking Prozac and Trazodone for 12 years and never had this reaction before. Lowered the dose to about 1/4 pill_ kept lowering the Prozac_ finally had to go off both because I needed them both for either to work. The combination was completely unworkable_ I felt like garbage. HOWEVER!!!! The debilitating fibromyalgia I've had disappeared with hardly a trace. I switched to a tricyclic (Watson nortriptyline) and the relief continues.,Pliva Trazodone is apparently a whole new drug_ and acts entirely different from each of the other generic Trazodone brands I used in the past.,F,58,12  years,11/9/2009,Trazodone hcl

It's mixed with my cocktail of depression drugs_ rls medicine_ and an anti-arrhythmic (Wellbutrin XL_ Cymbalta_ Klonopin_ Sotalol). If I don't get to bed within an hour of taking the 50mg pill I pass out on the couch. I'm still trying to train myself to get to bed by 11pm or midnight but I have a lifetime of anxiety around trying to fall asleep and failing. I also have a CPAP machine for sleep apnea that was added just after I started the Trazodone.

I have found that several of the generic brands do not work for me. My pharmacist was willing to try different kinds and I have found that the tiny sized pills work_ but the larger ones do not.

My insomnia worsened and I had dry eyes_dry throat_ stuffy nose and back pain . I finally got out of bed at 4am because I felt so much anxiety_ back pain and restlesssness!

136, 1, depression,profound and immediate memory loss; mania; symptoms of dementia,I am entering this information for my husband_ who was prescribed this drug and bupropion (Wellbutrin) at the same time. He had already been taking citalopram_ but it wasn't helping much_ so the doctor added these two new drugs. Within a couple days_ my husband's mood changed dramatically. He had energy and was happy. By the end of the week_ however_ he had lost both his long- and short-term memory. He didn't just forget the names of family members_ he forgot that he had them. He couldn't tie a tie. He couldn't sort socks. He couldn't recite the alphabet correctly. The doctors_ a feckless bunch sometimes_ decided that he has dementia. At my insistence_ my husband started tapering off this drug and his memory has improved. Last night was the first night he was completely off this drug. Today_ he is working on our home computer network. He's not all the way back_ and I don't know what tomorrow will be like_ but I am encouraged. Thank you all for your comments.

THIS DRUG WAS DANGEROUS AND FRIGHTENING FOR ME. It created frightening dream states before_ during and after sleep where my creations_ designs_ drawings_ turned into attacking me_ chasing me_ literally to where deep REM sleep was equivalent of death_ beyond my control even. I was so sleep deprived at one point I craved death_ but still couldn't get to sleep (over weeks). I'm sure this sounds entertaining to a reader_ but many people who work in many creative industries cannot afford this to happen_ and I think might feel better knowing someone else experienced this terrible side effect.

Now that I am in tooth/gum pain-I wanted to try it with Vicodin to keep me asleep! I cut the Vicodin in 1/2 since I want it to last longer.

I should have went to bed right after taking it!  I noticed that I do NOT get a headache from taking Vicodin. I have had a headache ALL DAY LONG and it's due to the (ONLY) 14mg of Trazodone that I took last night. I also have horrible stomach pains AND diaheera. I know I will NEVER take Trazodone with any other drug again and If I do decide to take it_ I will go to bed and make sure I can get 8 hours of sleep.
