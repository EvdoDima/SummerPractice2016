1, 5, Bacteria infection from cat bite,Anxiety _ tiredness_ emotional_ and on sixth day painful heartburn. I was also on amoxicillin 500 mg twice a day and augmentin 500mg twice a day.

4, 2, BV,dizziness_ lethargy_ tingling_ soreness_ sadness_ mild fever,Would not recommend. Was supposed to be on it for 7 days then these side effects turned up so I called my doctor and they told me to stop. I made it to the 4th day of taking the medicine then I just couldn't bear it. May just have been my reaction but it seems like lots of people having similar experience on this site so thats good to know. Symptoms of BV cleared up after 3 days though but obviously wanted to finish the dosage. Doctor suggested taking probiotics so if you do take the medicine make sure to take it with probiotics to avoid a lot of these symptoms.,F,20,7  days400 2X D,7/29/2016,Metronidazole
5, 1, BV,I recently suffered a second miscarriage and during my D&C they noted I had BV_ they waited a couple of weeks to treat so I could recover from the op. I am on day three of the antibiotics and am seriously considering coming off them. I have suffered from ME since I was 16 and am used to a daily high level of fatigue but the tiredness I have felt since taking this drug is unprecedented. It has also made me very low and close to tears which has made my work life really challenging with such erratic mood swings. After having such a traumatic time with my miscarriage this has been the last thing I need. I have also noticed hot flushes_ pressure behind the eyes_ sore throat_ fuzziness and some mild nausea. Ringing my GP in the morning to decide whether to proceed with the course as at the moment I doubt I will be fit for work if I continue.,,F,25,7  days 2X D,7/27/2016Email,Metronidazole

9, 3, UTI,Extreme fatigue_ drowsiness_ lightheadedness_ foggy head_ confusion_ lack of coordination_ motion sickness_ nausea_ loss of appetite_ metallic taste_ fast heart rate_ hallucinations_ mood swings_ anxiety_ depression_ itchiness,I am currently on day 4 of the medication. I didnt realize until the second day that the instructions are twice a day and not once a day_ and then I realized I started experiencing confusion and hallucinations from the medication. The longer I take them_ the side effects get worse. The pill has a chalky taste to it that was tolerable when I first took it_ but then became very noticeable that I had to take with something other than water. I recommend taking the pill with juice since it will dissolve in your mouth right away. The extreme fatigue and drowsiness have interrupted with my daily schedule. I am tired at all times and when I am not in class or doing school work I have to be sleeping. When I am not sleeping_ I feel motion sickness_ like my surroundings are spinning. DO NOT DRIVE!!! Try to get a designated driver because the medicine causes lack of coordination. Despite the side effects_ the medication treated the infection and reduced the symptoms of the infection. Doctors should warn patients about potential side effects.,F,20,7  days500 MG 2X D,6/16/2016Email,Metronidazole

Dose 3 = took with evening meal - same as dose 2 but with added fatigue. No issue since it was bedtime anyway! Dose 4 = took with morning meal - every side effect intensified. Extreme headache_ intolerance to light and sound_ extreme fatigue_ horrible metallic taste_ leg muscles felt like I ran a 5k. Dose 5 = took with evening meal - not sure what I was expecting_ but side effects worsened still_  and now accompanied by red pinpoint rash on extremities. My face was red (no rash yet) and I felt feverish. Next morning - rash spread to around eyes and cheeks and the rest of the bad stuff continued. I knew I had to STOP taking it. Ironically_ only 5 pills seemed to help the BV symptoms_ but I was given the gel version to use instead. I am holding off on that to see if the BV symptoms recur.,F,59,3  days500mg 2X D,5/20/2016Email,Metronidazole

27, 1, Had an op in my mouth,See my post on the 1/25/2016.,I wanted to give some of you hope and some good news. Its been 8 weeks since my terrible problems with the side effects started. I have been for an MRI after 7 weeks. The symptoms started to dissipate coincidentally around the same time that I went for the MRI. The MRI showed some remnants of white spots which the Dr. attributes to hardening of blood vessels_ etc. She does  not want to be drawn into anything that may indicate the medication could have done that. I of course have no doubt that it was the remnants of white matter lesions that were indicated and if I had gone for an MRI within the first week - we would likely have seen the white lesions. Anyway - I feel myself again - thank god and all of the symptoms have now gone with some slight challenges with my vision and the very odd and rare occurrence of a slight bit of light headiness at time. I think all of this will disappear after the next few weeks. So hang in there as no one comes back to tell when they feeling better and I am certainly feeling better after thinking I was going to die.

I was diagnosed with an inner ear disorder called Vestibular Neuritis a few months ago. I was prescribed this medication to treat an unrelated (obviously) vaginal infection. It completely exacerbated my vertigo/vestibular symptoms!! It made me ten times more dizzy_ and caused severe blurred vision and nystagmus (eyes shaking/unable to focus)!! I googled this medication in relation to vestibular disorders and this medication is considered an ""ototoxic"" medication. Webster's definition of ""Ototoxic"" is as follows: The property of being toxic to the ear; specifically the cochlea or auditory nerve_ and sometimes the vestibular system_ for example-as a side effect of a drug."" Taking this medication while having a vestibular or ear issue is literally like adding fuel to a fire. Steer clear of it!! I would rather have a vaginal infection for months than deal with the side effects of Metrodinazole! Drs. need to stop prescribing this toxic poison! I stopped taking it after my 5th day.

What you are suffering from has a name--METRONIDAZOLE-INDUCED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM TOXICITY.  Basically_ lesions are forming on your brain (specifically your cerebellum)_ and that's why you're having difficulty walking/speaking_ etc.  These lesions are reversible in about 85% of cases and almost everyone at least improves over the course of 3 months (people with only mood change problems especially have a better chance).  However_ taking more of the drug will cause the lesions to continue growing.  The only thing that can detect them is an MRI.  If you don't believe me_ put ""Metronidazole-induced Central Nervous System Toxicity"" into Google_ and you can find the case studies.  I'm not a doctor; I'm just a victim of this effing drug and did my homework.  It's 4 months out for me and I'm still having problems (although no longer debilitated by them).  I just wish someone had told me what I actually had when I was bed-ridden and felt like I was losing my mind.

I have not taken any other medicine_ or ingested alcohol. I am a student in school_ who works_ and also has a clinical internship 3 days a week_ so I have been extremely exhausted. I  look forward to my last day tomorrow but according to this site and many of your experiences; I can unfortunately anticipate feeling like this for a while (2 days afterwards). The good news: the smell is completely gone_ and there is no more discharge. The only reason why I continued with this medication through all of my symptoms is because I do not want this infection coming back_ it is an awful thing that I have been dealing with for the first time in my life.  I rated this drug a 5 on the basis that it has cleared my BV_ but time will tell if it truly did (I do have 1 more day to go) and even more time to tell if it truly helped.  As far as side effects I rate this as a 2 - the side effects suck.

The first day i felt  a bit jittery and light headed. The second day was about the same. Then the symptoms were basically gone until day 5 when i got a mild sore throat. Over the course of the medication I experienced mild light headed feelings_ but not too terrible. Overall_ it was not nearly as bad as i expected it to be. But it does leave you with an overall feeling of being off. If i was prescribed this medication again_ i would probably ask my doctor for something else. However_ I would take it again if it was my only option. It did fix my BV in a matter of days.

I went to the Doctor with a strong vaginal odour that had been occuring for about 6 months. He did a urine test- which came back clear- then did a vaginal swab. He ruled out other problems and the test came back positive for BV. I had tried natural remedies first and they didn't work on the smell.I saw some scary things online about this medicine_ but called my Nurse and she said that it was safe and that it was the only option to cure the symptom. She also told me that it was very important to complete the course of treatment as otherwise the bacteria could come back stronger.I took this for 7 days. After 4 or 5 days_ I called the Nurse as the odour wasn't going away. She gave me the Dr's e-mail address and he responded that it should have worked_ that the side-effects were probably from the drug_ and that I should finish the treatment and then let him know how I was doing.   I contacted him again on the 6th day to let him know that it still wasn't working. He said that I could stop taking it if I wanted_ as it should have worked_ that maybe the smell was from something else_ but if the BV didn't clear up I would have to have more drugs. So I took my 3rd-last dose and asked him if I should continue as I didn't want the BV to come back.

I have been taking these with more food and fluid so make sure youre stomach is lined if possible.,Initially I was prescribed a 2 gram dose (x5 tablets a night for 3 nights)_ but my partner (who is a Dr was horrified at that dose for taking whilst at home) told me to take a loading dose of that then split it over the day with anti emetics (I was given Domperidone 10mg x1/2 a day 3 times a day). The loading dose was horrendous and far far too large for me to take (x5 tablets of 400mgs each_ thats over 2 whole grams in one go on an empty stomach as I couldnt tolerate food or fluid) and the GP should really have discussed it with me prior to prescribing. I actually had to go back to the GP twice and demand anti emetics and goodness knows why these muppets didnt prescribe prophylactic Abx for me until this was diagnosed. Fortunately for me I didnt vomit this loading dose out and waste the medication. The anti emetic seriously helped alongside this once the severe nausea settled. I was house bound for ten days on this alongside my infection anyway. Im just fortunate my partner is a Dr and he is mailing my GP to discuss this with him.Im now on x 5 tablets of 400mg split over a day with anti emetics and now Im tolerating food/fluid_ Metronidazole actually isnt that bad if taken with food_ its doable_ but as a nurse_ Ive never said to anyone take this Med on and empty stomach as its highly irritant to the gut lining unless its enteric coated.

I am allergic to over 8 antibiotics_ so I was left with little option my the time I was hospitalized a week later. I was given Metronidazole in the hospital by IV_ 4 times a day for 9 days. I was blindsided by how terrible I felt. My health was and still is in a precarious and serious condition. I began to feel the side effects immediately and was never told my terrible symptoms were due to this medication. This continued for 9 days_ I was taken home and still on Metro at this time but 1/4 the dose I was on in hospital. I thought I was panicking and going insane until I found this forum. Thank God for all of your comments. You gave me peace that I wasn't going crazy. I hope to be well soon_ I'm still on Outpatient IV Levoquin once a day and Metro orally 3 times a day.

507, 1, VB,During the day the feeling was like I was 'drugged' or hungover with very dry feeling inside eyes_ as well as inside belly -- as if all fluids in me had dried up (32 weeks pregnant at the time of prescription). Towards evening I would get depressed_ when I fell asleep I had weird sensations in my head_ as if my brain was outside of my skull -- a nervous system issue I'm assuming. I was supposed to take 2 x 500 mg for 5 days_ but I stopped after 2 days (4 tablets in total) - I sweated a lot the night I stopped the meds_ but slept well compared to the previous night. I took half a dose the next day because I felt that it did help with the discharge and was worried about the whole preterm labour issue in regards to VB and pregnancy. However_ even the lower dose made me feel paranoid / depressed again_ so I drank a load of water_ followed by cranberry juice followed by a cup of warm water with lemon_ which helped with the dry-mouth. I decided to stop them altogether now.,Basically it felt like every thing was dried up - which was good for the quite watery discharge I had_ but didn't feel too good when it came to my eyes and head. Why is this drug prescribed during pregnancy ? With so many weird side-effects_ it shouldn't even be on the market anymore. It was disgusting and made me worry about my baby's and my own safety/health. The taste and feeling in my head reminded me of an experience with 'e' years ago_ but not in a good way.

I was never having 20 bowel movements a day to begin with.  Just maybe 1 or 2 but very loose and light colored.  After 11 of 14 days I finally called it quits with this poison.  I wasnt significantly getting better and was dealing with way too many side effects.

I had  severe insomnia_ and when I did eventually doze off_ I had terrible night sweats and my roommates told me I was screaming in my sleep. I became extremely irritable_ but that was probably because of my discomfort and lack of sleep. I had paranoid delusions about the smallest things_ and for no good reason at all. I had a strong sense of impending doom; that something terrible was going to happen_ and I was convinced that I was going to die at any moment. I was unreasonable in my interactions with people.

As others have mentioned_ the first 2-days I didn't really experience the severe side-effects.  By the 2nd night I became delusionsal thinking people were outside my windows_ paraniod someone would break in_ mood up and down_ and then these thoughts about dying or other people being killed kept popping into my head.  This was the most scarey thing EVER.... I thought I was going insane and was ready to have my boyfriend take me to a psychiatric hospital.  Then on the 4th day_ it hit me that this could possibly be from the Antibiotic.... Then I found this website and was soooooo relieved to find out others have had similar reactions!!!!  OMG_ I'm not going clinically insane -- just drug induced psychosis.  BE AWARE before taking this medication.  I called my pharamcist and he concurred that my symptoms were from the Med_ as it was working on my Central Nervous System.  The GYN nurse & doctor were more skeptical... which was angering.

I took every tablet with food.. And anti sickness tablets and still felt nauseous.. Doctors say I can't change tablets.. And they (seen 3 drs cause I felt so ill) they all said these tablets can actually make u feel worse than the illness itself.. In the end the iud had to be taken out a week later as there was no way the tablets would of worked.. Can't really function.. Manage to take the kids to school (it's out my back) and walk the dog (stand in the field.. Also out my back and throw the ball) and that's it for the rest of the day!!

Vancomycin is what I took afterwards and my symptoms improved within 24 hours.,I suggest that this drug still be tried first for C.diff but monitored more closely for signs of relapse or drug resistant c.diff bacteria.

549, 2, BV,severe depression_ lethargy_ nausea (though I drank no alcohol at all)_ random onset of tonsilitis!,Even 4 days after finishing the course i am still recovering from the neg side effects. Avoid Metronidazole if you are prone to any kind of low moods/depression. It brought out the worst in me. TONSILITIS - On day 2 I developed what felt like tonsilitis - my tonsils were red and had mucus on them_ glands swollen. Saw my GP who said it looked like tonsilitis_ that my immune system had weakened_ and that it couldn't be treated until I'd finished the Metronidazole cos I would be too weak! After 3 days_ it went away by itself. ALCOHOL - GP said to wait 2 days after completing course to drink alcohol. Had a tiny 1/2 glass of wine 2 days after_ was fine no neg effects. Mixed spirits 4 days after_ was completely out of control_ dizzy_ everything spinning_ then was awfully_ horribly sick. This is v unusual for me - I have not been so sick drinking alcohol in 4 years. Blaming Metronidazole. MY ADVICE - If you are prescribed this_ please ask your GP if there are any alternatives_ at least to taking it orally. For BV you can get it as a cream I think_ which would probably be a lot better_ since it would only be affecting the bits that need it.

568, 1, BV,Dark urine_ abdominal pain_ lower pelvic pain_ lower back pain_ increased urination_ extreme confusion_ fogginess_ no appetite_ short-term memory loss_ elevated liver labs_ suicidal thoughts_ moodiness_ depression_ heart racing_ increased anxiety,I will NEVER take this drug again. Two years ago I was hospitalized for a week after taking this drug for 2 weeks for possible diverticulitis. I lost 25 pounds during the 3 week period. A week ago I was put on this med again. I have had horrible side effects_ suicidal thoughts_ anxiety_ confusion_ no appetite. I now believe the reason I was hospitalized two years ago was from this med. I am still foggy and out of it_ two days after the last pill. I hope it goes away soon.,F,42,7  days10mg 2X D,2/18/2011Email,Metronidazole

571, 1, Persistent unexplained NSU,Having had this drug on 2 previous ocassions over several days to clear a possible unidentifiable urethral infetion_ I visited the GUM clinic and consultant said he would give me a large dose - all to be taken with water in a single dose. I had to take 10 x 400mg tablets in one go. Iwas a little nervous about this. I asked about safety and was told it is tolerated at this dose by women with 'ertain conditions' and the main thing is I MUST NOT drink alcohol for at least 24 hours. I had headaches for a day or so and felt a bit woozy. 24 hours later my urine turned REALLY dark. No improvement in my condition. About 2 weeks later noticed weakness in both legs below knees. Random stabbing pains over tops of shins. This leg pain has now persisted for a month. The doc has said the drug would not cause any leg problems even at this dose and has put me on 2 weeks of other antibiotics as NSU still not clearing up. Ive searched all over interenet and not found anyone prescribed 4g in a single dos,,M,41,1  days10 x 400mg 1X D,2/16/2011,Metronidazole

However_ the meds did work while I was taking them. Dosage ended yesterday. Today I am jittery and anxious_ feel uncomfortable in my own skin_ muscles are tight. Feels like withdrawal symptoms. Calling the Doc to see if this is related to the metronidazole. I don't know what else it can be as this is the only thing I have recently taken or stopped. Also_ the symptoms that put me on the metronidalzole are returning already. Has anyone else experienced withdrawal like symptoms after stopping this medication?,F,30,14  days500 3X D,2/11/2011Email,Metronidazole
575, 1, stomach problems,Severe depression and nausea! Loose bowels_ overall fatigue.,Thank goodness I'm not the only one who is having a horrible time with this medication. Was beginning to think I was losing my mind! Am normally a very active senior citizen_ but this medication has brought me to an abrupt halt! I'm hoping the infection (if in fact_ I actually had one) has cleared_ but it is a huge price to pay! The depression and nausea are the worst I've ever experienced. Have 3 more days left of the meds_ and it can't be too soon! Was on Cipro before this_ and it too_ had side effects_ so Dr. said to quit taking it. I'm sure he thinks I'm a hypochondriac as I seem to have bad side effects from most meds_ but I've lived in this body for many years_ and I know when it's far from normal! I won't ever take it again.,F,66,10  days500mg 3X D,2/10/2011,Metronidazole

Finished course yesterday afternoon.  24 hours later now feel GREAT.  Seems to have cleared the infection.  If I ever get this again_ I will ask for cream or suppositories due to overall feeling crappy for a few days with pills.   Ate Kefir (drinkable yogurt) everyday and also took a probiotic supplement so perhaps GI symptoms could have been alot worse without taking those things.,,F,48,7  days250 3X D,1/14/2011,Metronidazole

588, 2, possible BV; cervicitis,Only on day 5 of 14 day course_ don't think I will make it.  Side effects are a little less but still here: AWFUL taste_ as if I haven't brushed my teeth in weeks; white tongue; pills are awful bitter and hard to swallow; take it with full stomach every time but get waves of nausea (I have a vomit phobia so this is HORRIBLE); increased hunger but NO desire to eat for first few days; when I do eat_ sometimes pain in stomach; no diarrhea but constipation and loose stools when I do go; pain on left side rib like a bruise even though I have not injured it/strained the muscles; strange-feeling sweating but sometimes chills and fever feeling; unable to catch my breath at times as if I just did laps; constant feeling of something (phlegm?) in my throat; unable to sleep at all for first 2 nights and disgusting_ nauseating nightmares_ had to take Tylenol PM 3rd night; but the worst was the EXTREME PANIC ATTACKS. I am prone to panic/anxiety anyway but have it under control--UNTIL I took this--ti,There is no way in hell I will be able to take this for 14 days.  I don't understand why I even got prescribed it this long_ most websites say BV can be cleared up on 1000 mg/day in 7 days.  Unfortunately my PCP isn't sure what I have and is covering all bases.  *Note:  I am also taking oflaxacin which can cause the same symptoms as Flagyl so my side effects are compounded by the combination therapy.   And btw I'm not a person who usually experiences side effects--Penicillin sometimes causes diarrhea_ and Bactrim causes gas pain_ but Metronidazole (and oflaxacin) are HORRENDOUS.,F,26,14  days250 4X D,1/14/2011,Metronidazole

I can walk now_ I'm not in pain_ as much as I hate this drug is was a form of salvation.  I do get nauseous_ but I take it after meals w/ food (choc. almond milk and banana slices).  I do use the bathroom a LOT_ but not diareah_ just frequent bowel movement.  I am going to start eating more yogurt. Oh and I've lost a ton of weight_ but I think it was the liquid diet they had me on in the hospital for 4 days.  My body has been through hell in the last week.  I went into the hosptial at 103_ left at about 116_ I am now (according to my WiFit) 97lbs.  But I don't think this would happen on the oral.  I've used this drug before and didn't have too much trouble with it.,TAKE WTIH FOOD!  I cannot stress this enough.  I can't swallow it quickly enough_ so I crush it.

611, 1, tooth infection,By day 8 the side effects were so severe and I had developed a fever so I quit taking the meds.  I was taking 500mg 4X/day.  Right away I experienced dizziness_ fatigue_ troubles concentrating_ dark urine_ horrible taste_ severe nauseousness and lethargy.  I called my dentist who prescribed the meds and he said I am prob. coming down with the flu.  I went to my general practitioner who told me that if it was so bad I should stop taking it_ but know tha I would probably have to go a new course with a new antibiotic.  I even called my Pharmacist who was the most knowledgeable and at least explained a few things to me.  All of the doctors seemed to not even believe me when I told them my symptoms.  This is a horrible antibiotic and I would suggest to report all of your symptoms to the FDA.  Apparently nobody is reporting and so the doctors do not know of these horrendous side effects.  It has been 22 hours since my last dosage and I still feel dizzy and nauseous.,I will never take this med again.,F,42,10  days500mg 4X D,12/23/2010,Metronidazole

I believe i was put on this medication for BV in October_ (not sure if the first round perhaps caused my bacteria parasite_ or i contracted it from contaminated food/water) and experienced no side effects other than the metallic taste_ but since put on this medication last week_ everyday is a struggle.  I have no appetite and try to eat as normal a diet as possible_ but its a chore every time i have to eat because i am not hungry at all. I am drinking ORS and fluids frequently_ and tried attune probiotics and increasing the amount of fiber i consume_ but nothing helps my diarrhea/loose BM.  I have 4 days left of my dosage_ and hope it will all go away when i'm finished_ but since my symptoms are worse than when i had the reaction to the parasite bacteria_ i have no idea if the medication is working/worked.  I am very frustrated_ and had no help from my doctor_ and just hope all these GI issues will be over soon.  I think for some conditions and people_ this medicine works great and cause no problems_ but i think for bacterial infections and certain people_ this medication will be horrible experience.,F,24,10  days500 3X D,12/22/2010Email,Metronidazole
614, 2, gum infection,No side effects of any note,Had a course of ordinary Penicillin with no effect so was prescribed Metronidazole. But continue to wake up with very sore gums and pain/tenderness in my ear and throat. After taking the last tablets_ I'm not sure the medicine has had that much effect let alone actually curing the infection so need to go back to the dentist again.,M,66,5  days200 3X D,12/20/2010,Metronidazole
615, 2, bv,Severe nausea_ this is day 3 no vomiting yet_ diarrhea_ no appetite_ thought eating might help nausea... NO_ water helps a little but who wants to put anything in their stomah when they have nausea. I couldn't get up to do anything_ it was like I had the flu.,I RARELY react to medications I take_ so I don't plan on taking this medicine again.,F,25,7  days500 2X D,12/20/2010,Metronidazole
616, 1, tooth infection,Day six and I still feel lethargic_ dizzy_ can't concentrate_ nauseous.........,I just called my dentist and he said that an antibiotic cannot cause these feelings--that I must be getting the flu or something.  He told me to continue taking the meds until they are gone.  I still have three and a half days left and I am considering going to my regular doctor or the emergency room.,F,42,10  days500mg 4X D,12/20/2010,Metronidazole

This time it is unbearable and it has NOT helped the tooth pain. It is a horrible drug and dangerous I would think to anyone driving a vehicle who is so tired.,F,68,5  days200mg 3X D,12/19/2010,Metronidazole
618, 1, tooth infection,From the first dose I have felt nauseous_ bitter taste in my mouth all day_ dizzy_ groggy_ tired_ can't sleep_ bad dreams_ irritable_ shaky_ chills_ fever_ dark urine_ can't concentrate--need I say more!  I am on day 5 of 10 days of 500mg/4X a day and feel like crying every time I have to take the pill.  This is ridiculous.  I really hope this works.,I will never take this EVER again!,F,42,10  days500mg 4X D,12/18/2010,Metronidazole
619, 2, Bacterial Vaginosis,I've never reacted so terribly to a drug! I feel the need to warn others. Lets just say that_ when asked what medications I'm allergic to_ I will now refuse to take this drug. The only side effect I was warned about was diarrhea. Like others_ I had the awful and consistent metallic taste (which was the least of my worries). My sense of smell caused certain things to smell repulsive and it was heightened. The worst side effect was the irrational mood swings and paranoid thoughts that would sometimes be followed by nausea and diarrhea. Also_ at times I was lethargic and felt that the whole world was going twice as fast as me. I also had loose stools the first 4 or 5 days. I only had a bit of appetite loss and no headaches to speak of. If there is another medication you can request_ please avoid these scary_uncontrollable side effects.,It did solve the problem_ but like others_ I don't think it was worth the trouble.,F,24,7  days500 2X D,12/17/2010,Metronidazole
620, 2, C-DIFF,It would be easier to describe the side effects I did not have.  Tiredness_ joint pain_ feeling like I'm floating on cloud.  Chills one hour_ sweating the next.  I haven't slept a full night since I went on this.  Upset stomach_ indigestion_ loose bowel movements. Headaches on a daily basis.,Make sure to read ALL the side effects_ not just the ones on the print out from the pharmacy.  These medications can be dangerous and produce side effects for a long time after use.  I was put on this because Levaquin gave me C-Diff in the first place.  It is up to you to take control of your body.,M,40,14  days500 3X D,12/17/2010Email,Metronidazole
621, 2, Perineal abcess,Right now_ and  the reason I'm here_ my testicles and back passage are painfully swollen. I've got insomnia yet am horribly tired_ the metallic taste is unbearable_ have numb appendages that I have to really work at to get moving_ have lots of odd coloured stool_ feel anxious_ and feel as if my asthma symptoms are worsening.,I'm so glad I looked this up here_ I thought I was going crazy. I'm halfway through this course and that's all I'm going to take_ it has to be the worst drug I've ever been given. Never again.

I have two more days and want to pull my hair out!  I just can't believe that this particular drug is the best for my condition - removal of appendix.  Even though I had gangrene_ there should be a comprable drug that is not so horrible.  I didn't even take any pain medicine except for Tylonel when I came home from the hospital just so I could have some touch with reality.,F,59,7  days500 MG 3X D,12/16/2010Email,Metronidazole
623, 3, BV,Sorry to say it like this but I feel like crap.  The BV was from having an ovary removed_ and I developed BV after the surgery.  Those symptoms have waned_ but this metronidazole has me depressed_ so achy in the neck and shoulders_ arms.  Feeling if I'm not good enough for my family_ spacy_ cannot concentrate_ feel like a robot going through the actions of the day.  It's natural therapy for me if this doesn't work.,Drink lots of water.  Realize it's the medicine_ not you.  I read all your posts and I think knowing what I'm experiencing is common_ I'll go ahead and finish it.  Hope I feel better by Christmas.,F,46,7  days500 2X D,12/16/2010,Metronidazole

I wouldnt want to take it again even though it treated the infection. One more day of feeling sick_ I can't wait till I am done with taking the pills because waking up to a migraine every morning and to feel really sick all day is enough on my body.

After 5 days was cured though have developed awful thrush!!,F,41,7  days200 3X D,12/13/2010Email,Metronidazole
626, 4, BV,Headache_ stomach ache,On the first day I took this medicine_ I got a terrible headache and felt flushed for about an hour or so. Afterwards thought_ I basically had no side effects_ besides a bit of an upset stomach every few days or so (no vomiting or nausea...none of that business). I was scared to take this after reading all the reviews on this site_ but I took it and lemme tell you_ it was nowhere near as bad as some of these reviews make it out to be. It didn't inconvenience me or make me feel terrible. My only complaint was that the pill was pretty big and couldn't be cut up_ so I had a hard time swallowing it. I'm just not that good of a pill taker so I suppose that would happen for me with most drugs. but yeah. This really wasn't that bad at all.,F,18,7  days500 mg 2X D,12/11/2010,Metronidazole

Tired_ emotional_ bad taste in mouth_ very dark foul smelling urine_ increased sense of smell_ generally feeling run-down_ lethargic and depressed.,Finished the tablets on Wed and by Thursday night had a lovely case of thrush and tooth pain (tooth might be unrelated)! Hopefully this will go away.

629, 1, Bacterial Vaginosis,The most horrible drug I have ever taken in my whole life. Day 1- extremely tired_ nauseous_ difficulty concentrating. Day 2- black stool_ frequent bowel movements_ along with day 1 symptoms_ and after that they just kept getting worse.  Body aches_ stress_ uncontrollable emotions and anxiety_ severe depression for no reason at all. Unable to concentrate_ not able to think straight.  Delusional_ paranoid_ headaches_ stress_ unable to sleep_ wake up in a sudden panic (and I am a deep_ heavy sleeper).  I would never ever recommend anyone take this for any reason.  I wish I would've found this site before I took the meds_ I would've never done it- nor were there any warning signs from my prescription label.  I thought I was going to be declared clinically insane.  It was bad....really bad.  The worst part was that I could not control it.  3 days after stopping I feel completely normal.  I'm more relieved that I can even explain that it's over.,,F,28,7  days500mg 2X D,12/9/2010,Metronidazole
630, 3, Infection in Ovary Tube & Ovary,I developed an infection after having a womb biopsy with severe pains to the left in Ovary & Ovary tube.  I have been taking this tablet along with Doxycycline tablets (2 x pr day)_ although the course of the Doxycycline tablets finished yesterday.  The side affect of this tablet is that it has given me the most severe Headaches_ which are there in the morning & build up over the day.  By the afternoon I am taking Tramadol to cope with the pain in my head_ as normal pain killers are just not touching this pain...I can't stand cooking smells (Bacon especially) as this makes me feel sick_ and nausea.  Two days ago the pain in my head was so bad that I was unable to get dressed until 1pm in the afternoon and spent the day feeling lethargic_ which I have felt for most of the week_ also sweaty.  The tablets have helped with the awful pelvic pains though - and I am hoping have helped cure them.  I have two tablets left_ and I have made the decision not to take them_ as I cant cope wi,I was astounded at how many people taking this tablet have had same or similar side affects_ and that it seems to affect some people more severely than others.,F,50,6  days400mg 3X D,12/6/2010,Metronidazole

Dry heaved and whimpered for about 45 minutes until fell asleep. Next morning EXTREME lethargy. I stayed home from work and slept all day long. Got up_ no appetite. Was too exhausted to even watch Law & Order. Really ""muddle-brained""... Fell asleep. Third day after taking rx headache & can barely think.. called off work and had another restless_ anxious night's sleep where I was sobbing into my pillow about who knows what.  Day 4. Migrain passed but still exhausted! Plus_ had severe cotton-mouth!  Day 5. Burning sore throat. WTF! Why would symptoms get WORSE the further away from the ingestion date??  Day 6. Flu Like-sympoms.. I just want it to end... when will it end! I left a message for a nurse to call me back... Day 7. Today... Dry cough. No mucus. Just coughing. And ate a ton of lemons so I can swallow now but throat and mouth","I suppose since it's a 'poison' to kill the bacteria it's natural to assume it would be poisonous to US in some way.. but they need to put that on the label.

Plus it says a lot about no alcahol too so I never used mouthwash after I brushed my teeth as that contains alcahol as does other products like body lotion so I stayed clear of usuing them for the 7 days.

So I've been eating a lot of natural yogurts_ and drinking probiotic drinks like actimel_ and I'm doing just fine.

At the end of the treatment I was covered on my neck_ chest_ back and face in  extremely red itchy hives and tiny white spots.,This medication leaflet does identify possible side effects but it should state that it will all happen to you if you dare to take it. The problem is that when you have a painful infection you will do anything to stop the pain and the side effects seem insignificant before hand. If you can_ persuade your doctor to prescribe something else that is sensitive to help your infection as in the long run you will feel worse.,F,39,7  days400mg 3X D,10/28/2010,Metronidazole

New life never before identified has found sanctuary in my mouth. Small spaceships leaving the docking area on a regular basis brush the inside of my mouth_ causing a metallic taste. On a daily basis_ my head is being put in that thing that returns your bowling ball really quickly_ and I think Im walking faster than everyone_ like Im on that I-can-get-there-quicker-than-you conveyor belt between airport terminals.

So full marks for that. But my sense of smell seems greatly enhanced. Suddenly realised all my sweaters needed washing; cheddar cheese smelt of truffles_ magazines smelt of hot electrical equipment.

Depression_ anxiety_confusion_fatigue_mood swings_ lack of concentration. I cried for 2days for no reason. Just felt very unsettled. I did not take any alcohol. i dont even drink. Thought i was going crazy until i read this website on day 4. Thanks guys!,The info that comes with these meds don't say much about the side effects. I would have dealt with the emotional/mental confusion a lot better if i knew that these pills the cause. Also it wasn't effective at curing BV. Will never take it again!!

I am going to stop this in 5 more days though because I am having a birthday party and I might want to have a drink.,The combination seems to be working. The growth is much smaller but I was a little concerned about the stiff neck so I started looking at some side effects. It is on the leaflet I got but I was curious what others had to say. I also got my first flu shot this week and I was thinking the body/neck ache could be from that but it doesn't sound like it.

I took the tablets exactly as indicated. Found dairy (esp. ice cream) and chocolate helpful during bouts of nausea. Hope side effects go away quickly. Was pleased to see that it didn't interfere to any marked extent with my gut flora (which broad-spectrum antibiotics had done a good job of totally wiping out some years previously)_ so that was a major plus_ but hope I never have to take antibiotics of any description ever again!

I suppose some of the lethargy and irratability are from the GI side effects so I try to stay hydrated as well. It beats the alternative of keeping the infection it was prescribed for. When you take this medication avoid any food or beverage that will metabolize into the same chemical as alchohol_ you may have to do some research but it helps with some of the common side effects.

Dark urine and fatigue(slept 10-12 hrs/day_ although not always in sequence; I took naps because of sapped energy). Was very curt with those around me. I am generally easy going. Aversion to alcohol and food in general tasted different due to constant bad/metallic taste in my mouth.,Horrible tasting drug! I was so glad to read some of the other comments. I am taking this medication for a painful abdominal condition and I continued to have cramping and bloating while taking the medication. It was confusing because I wasn't sure if I was getting any better or not until I researched the medication and realized what I was feeling was a side effect of the medicine. So I get prescribed a medicine that gives me similar effects to the disorder I am trying to treat_ GREAT. I took almost all of my Rx_ I just through the last one away after reading about it on several sites online. I can't imagine missing one pill is going to make that big of a difference. I have looked forward to getting off of this med since I started it. I have barely been able to eat much of anything while on it. I have primarily been on a liquid diet. I ate a lot of soup and juices to try and keep myself hydrated and make sure I got proper nutrition. This was NOT an easy regimen to follow.

Not epileptic so must be the drug.,Was also prescribed Amoxicillin 500 MG 3 times a day for a week. After starting course of both antibiotics infection quickly improved and pain subsided. On advice from doctor and dentist stopped taking Metronidazole 4 days into course. Am still on Amoxicillin with no appreciable difference except side effects are gradually fading.

The side effects have made me feel more ill than to start with and I haven't been able to go to work. If there is any other option_ I would recommend trying this first and stopping if it gets too bad as this is hell. The problem is I know what's causing it but I can't stop it as the pain of the abscess is much worse!!

The first couple days I had no symptoms except for the metallic taste_ which is horrible. After the third day I have been completely tired and have no motivation to do anything_ even my grades have slipped a little. I also experienced nightmares while on this drug. I have had a few different ones in one night and one repeating nightmare throughout the week. I thought the nightmares were weird because I normally don't have them. When I read that other people have had nightmares while on this drug it made sense. I have also taken this medicine with food every time and my stomach still gets upset especially today I felt extremely nauseous.

It is (and has been known for a while!) that one-size-does-not-necessarily-fit-all when it comes to drugs prescribed for the general populace - had I been aware of the effects of this medication at the onset_ I probably would have gone looking for something else.I can only hope that my comments may help others come to terms in some way with their situations - just as I have finally been able to do also.

I generally sleep well. Learning that depression was a side-effect enabled me to put it in perspective. Try to avoid touching your tongue for any length of time. These medicines have terrible effects. I can't understate them. But they are said to be medically essential for my condition_ and I will take them to the end which is two weeks. I have taken them on one other occasion. I am now at the half-way point of this course of treatment.

Fourth night I thought I was having an allergic reaction due to increased anxiety. Sixth day I continually felt an increased heart rate and I kid you not_ I could feel my blood pumping in my knees_ toes_ shoulders_ everywhere. It does seem to be clearing up my infection_ but the side effects are far worse. I would have stopped taking it halfway through_ but my NP is out of the office until the day after my last scheduled dose. So I'm sticking it out. I did find that taking half a pill 4 times a day instead of a full pill twice a day seems to ease the side effects a little.

I even noticed some of the same comments as I had_ wanting to stop taking this medicine because It made me feel worse then before I started.   I should have been told that these were the side effects. I would not have taken the medicine.   I have four small children and it is extremely hard to be a functional mom when you can't physically function properly.  I am sleeping 8 hrs and I could actually sleep longer_ and never feeling rested.  I will be contacting my doctor again because I am concerned about one of the comments left by a user made by their doctor_ it would be about a month before the symptoms would go away even after finishing the regimen of pills!

The metallic taste is intollorable_ followed by 48hours of constant vomitting_ stomach cramps and hallucinating. But the worst feeling for me was the head pains_ my eye balls felt like they were popping out of my head. This extreme crushing pain lasted 48hours and was barely curable by asprin. Its the third day now and I still cant walk properly because of the dizzyness and sick feeling. Im managing to eat now but its difficult to keep it down. I also experienced fever like symptoms_ shaking and sudden change in temperature_ also nightmares.,I will never take this medicine again.

I am on my very last day and am so relieved. The first couple days I had no appetite and felt like I was coming down with something. After a couple days it only got worse. I stated feeling very irritable and depressed. I had a hard time understanding anything going on around me at times(confusion). I almost had a panic attack in the grocery store on day 6. Even though im not for sure_ I do believe I am getting a yeast infection. Whats the point of treating one infection just to get another?

At first the doctor prescribed a 10 days cure but he then decided to increase it to 15 days so I have 3 more days to go. I'm glad I found this site because I was ready to stop Metronizadole today.

On the fourth day I was noticing a mild numbness in my feet_ shins_ and forearms.  By mild numbness I mean it felt like something was on my skin.  This progressed to my thighs and my junk on the 5th day_ and when I was peeing it was hard to get going - it would dribble without much force_ not much pee came out_ and I was going to the bathroom more frequently.  I also have a constant mild ringing in my left ear_ but this isn't mentioned as a side effect.Acceptable Side Effects:Intermittent nausea_ dizzy/light headed_ mild balancing issues_ lack of concentration (almost got in car accident_ I couldn't say what I was thinking properly).  Constant anxiety_ paranoia_ weakness_ and very emotional.,On the 4th day I stopped taking the drugs because of the serious pins and needles side effect.  The next day I went to the clinic because my family dr. wasn't available_ told him about the numbness/pins and needles_ and the clinic dr. gave me a prescription for an additional 4 days because I skipped a day and said start taking it again.  On the 5th day the numbness feeling moved up into my thighs and my junk_ so I went to another clinic dr for a second opinion.  Again_ he said keep taking it.Both clinic dr's said that the alternative to this drug_ VANCOMYCIN_ would be much worse on me than this drug.On the last day I finally see my family doctor who says stop taking it immediately as I have symptoms of peripheral neuropathy that will get worse if I continue taking it.  He also said that VANCOMYCIN (which is very expensive - $1200 for a 10 day dosage) would be much easier for me to take_ and that that doctors are supposed to try to get patients to take cheaper drugs.,M,37,5.5  days,12/9/2009,Metronidazole

On day 4 I had runny stools more than once and took Pepto for that and my upset stomach. By day 6_ had 2 bloody_ runny stool movements_ even darker urine (despite drinking over a quart of water after EACH dose)_ racing heart_ upset stomach to where I was afraid to leave the house or puke in public; was taking 4 hour naps and still sleeping over 9 hours each night. I called my doc. I was real worried by this point. The awful thing is that my gum doesn't feel good still. I started these drugs with a pain level of 9.

It has also worked for me both times so I'm fairly satisfied with it.,*WARNING* I foolishly ignored advice by the dentist to avoid alcohol 24 hours after taking the 5 day course and went for a Sunday afternoon drinking session.

I can't wait to get off this treatment and rebalance with probiotics and homeopathics_ though.,I hope I never have to take the oral version of this drug_ that I never get that sick.

I myself thought I was going crazy experiencing the extreme dizziness_ excessive heart rate_ fatigue (like you are coming down with a cold)_ your mouth will taste like metal constantly_ nausea_ loss of appetite (because your food tastes like metal) and you just want to rest all day.

I had to break the pill in 1/2 to go down easier.,I think if you are warned early on of these various_ yet common side effects... it would eliminate the stress and panic of wondering what is going on and rushing to the ER thinking its a severe reaction to the drug.,F,35,5  days,10/24/2009,Metronidazole

I didn't make the connection until my niece - a nurse - told me of her personal and professional experience with this drug. Subsequently_ this site has confirmed for me that I might be on the right track in helping my mother back to her usual self.  My recommendation is similar to many on the site.

I had to force my self to finish the last pill because of course the BV symptoms were gone. I finished 2 days ago and still having side effects.  However_ in conclusion the drug did work it's main purpose!,F,39,7  days,9/21/2009,Metronidazole
927, 1, Gum Infection,I suffered a stroke 3 months ago and the side effects of taking metronidazole made me feel as if I was about to have another one!  Dizzy_ wobbly_ lethargic_ depressed_ weepy.  Blood pressure up pulse rate down.  Headaches_ feeling like waves going through my head and total anxiety. Also tingling in the hands and a bit in the feet. Did not feel nauseaus or suffer diarrhea though.,I would not take this drug again!  I was not warned about any of these side effects and there was no leaflet in the packet.   The only thing the dentist and the pharmacist said was not to take alchohol with them.  The same is said for any antibiotic.,F,55,3  days,9/18/2009,Metronidazole
928, 5, Vaginal infection,Almost none: strange taste (not metallic) in mouth_ but mild_ darker urine.,It's hard to believe all the negative comments. Maybe some others are taking with other meds? I'm usually very sensitive to any medications_ but this proved to be no problem at all_ taking 500mg_ twice/day for 7 days.,F,50,7  days,9/17/2009,Metronidazole
929, 1, Mouth bacteria,Had to take 500mg 3 times a day for 7 days.The first days I was very tired and dizzy. On day 4 the real problems began. Headaches_ dizziness and worst of all a panic attack. On day 5 I could not take it anymore and stopped. Now 2 weeks later i still have physical conditions i am not used to_ pain in the muscles of my legs_ pain in my thumb_ headaches_  a slightly inflamed eye and most worrisome pain in my liver. Still tired too.,I read there are alternative drugs for mouth bacteria_ do that instead of this. Avoid this drug anyway if there is an alternative.This is not a penicillin like drug_ this is real heavy_ i will NEVER take METRONIDAZOLE again.,M,46,4  days,9/17/2009,Metronidazole
930, 4, Appendicitis,Loss of appetite_ always tired_ irritable.  Metallic taste in mouth.  change in tastes of food.  Anxiety,On day 12 of 14.  This stuff really works_ but at what cost?  Taste is nearly unbearable; lingers for a long time after taking the pills.  Pill dissolves so quickly I hardly have time to chug it down_ and when I do_ it always goes down the wrong way; tried breaking it in two and swallow in parts.  Did I mention the taste?  Developed a filmy coating on tongue that has been around since day 2 of treatment.  Side affects have been a lot to deal with_ but inflammation and pain have totally subsided.  Hopefully the Docs will say the infection is gone so I don't have to repeat this experience.  Does' anyone know of good alternative AB to metronidazole?,M,20,14  days,9/11/2009,Metronidazole
931, 1, salpingitis,recieved a shot in the hospital_ then was given the prescription. it gave me unbearable diahreah_ insomnia_ muscle tremors_ nausia_ and caused the insides of my vagina to swell up so badly that it started to come outside of my body. headaches_ vaginal redness and tenderness. increased thirst. i wil never never never take this medicine again!,,F,20,15  days,9/11/2009,Metronidazole
932, 1, blastocyst_ Dientamoeba infection,none. 3x500mg for 8 days. Parasites still present.,Ppl shouldn't take antibiotics for bv or dysbiosis. The reason they have these conditions is because they have a compromised immune system (stress_ food sensitivities_ poor diet_ overuse of antibiotics_ etc). Address the cause_ not the symptoms. If a boat had a hole in it_ would you shovel water or plug the hole?,M,21,8  days,9/9/2009,Metronidazole
933, 1, Diverticulitis,Developed Peripheral Neuropathy after about 24 doses of 500 mg. Three weeks after discontinuing Metronidazole_ the Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms persist.,Avoid the drug,M,65,8  days,9/8/2009,Metronidazole
934, 3, Bacterial Vaginosis,With the first dose (250mg)_ I immediately developed severe nausea and heart palpatations. Had nausea for the first 2 days_ then developed stomach cramping_ bad headaches_ and diarrhea/loose stools. Diarrhea and headache continue even 1 day after finishing the medication.,I learned that if you take this medicine with food it tends to help somewhat with the nausea. Also_ the pill tastes horrible_ so if you can drink juice when taking it_ or something flavored_ it helps cut down on the taste the pill tends to leave on your tongue.,F,27,5  days,8/31/2009,Metronidazole
935, 1, preventative after biopsy,Flu-like symptoms after day 3. Sore throat headache & light headedness. Lower back pain then along came the loose bowel problem.

Am on the 3rd day and looking for help as I almost passed out_ plus very unsteady when walking and almost lost my balance and fell.  At my age and with osteoporsis_ I certainly don't want to fall.  I didn't take the 3rd dose today and decided to research the medicine.  These reviews have helped tremendously.  My pain does seem to be lessening but I am wondering if its worth it. I am questioning trying to decrease the dosage to only 2 times a day but believe I will call my doctor first although I know I will not get anywhere as his office always denies that side effects are due to any medicines. Why do they do that?  I am very sensitive to all medicines_ extremely allergic to pencillins_ but it appears here that I am not alone with this drug.,F,74,3  days,8/27/2009,Metronidazole

939, 1, Ovary Infection,The first day I felt all right_ but by day 3 I felt like it was the worst flu I'd ever experienced. I'm just ending day 5 and cannot imagine taking it any long. Horrible nausea_ stomach pains_ acid reflux_ insomnia_ and depression. This is the worst thing I have ever taken_ I would have rathered live with the infection than take these.

940, 4, BV,dizziness_ fatigue_ vivid dreams_ crawling out of skin_ more trips to the bathroom but no nausea.,I have taken an anti-depressant years ago and could not last more than 3 days on it. This medicine gives me the same feeling. I feel like I am on planet Mars. I have been on this for 3 days now. 500mg twice daily for 7 days. My boyfriend said my mood swings last night were horrible. I am usually pretty mellow but get stressed easily. I don't know what is worse. The fishy smell from BV or feeling like you are going completely insane. I will continue taking these for now but if the symptoms get worse I will discuss changing drugs but heard that this was the best to get rid of bv. What a bad experience. My BV does seem to be subsiding though!,F,21,7  days,8/21/2009,Metronidazole

I will never take this again_ and suggest that if you are prescribed this you 'run for the hills.'  The worst problem is that neither the doctor or pharmacist warns you (even the warning label doesn't do an adequate job).  Thanks goodness for the internet!!,F,53,7  days,8/17/2009,Metronidazole
945, 2, Dental Abcess,Drowsiness_ light-headed_ nausea_ zombie-like_ metallic taste in mouth_ VERY FREQUENT bathroom trips,I was prescribed this medication for a infection from my tooth.

I can tell it worked.,Now I know why I have been feeling overwhelmingly depressed_ even though I am taking an antidepressant. Each day becomes more and more difficult to get out of bed and with my history of depression_ the last thing I need to be doing is taking a medication that will send me down that track. After finding this site and seeing this is really not my depression beating my antidepressant_ but this antibiotic throwing me into a hole_ I'll never take it again.

Day 4 the same but I took Ibuprofen continuosly to help.Day 5 small blisters appearing on the palm of my hand( later found out this was erythema which is an obvious sign of adverse drug reaction). Other sores start appearing on my thighs. Reactions are  still occurring  4 days after stopping drug . I am now on antihistimmines ..One week of night sweats where total sheet change required at least three times a night.,I did ring my Doctor after the fourth day to be told that the metallic taste and headache would be related to the drug_ but none of the other symptons. I was going to stop a this stage but was told my symptons were more likely a virus and Doctor recommended I continued. Has pretty much been the worst 10 days of 2009 for me and I am still not through it. The Erythema got so aggressive  and painful for  several days and the surprise was more lumps turning up on my body after finishing the drug.

This is a depressing medicine. You feel worse on the course than you felt with the initial illness. Drug companies need to include more information for patientsI don't think this is working. I may have to have a colonoscopy and switch to Vancomyacin,Chew gum when taking this. Don't let your stomach go empty_ keep something in it. DRINK LOTS OF WATER.This drug kills good and bad bacteria too. It does no good to take a probiotic or eat yogurt with it.

952, 5, Colitis - BAD bacterial infection,dry mouth; loss of appetite; dazed feeling about an hour after taking it; lightheadness,I have dreaded taking this medicine - but the bottom line is that it works and I can handle the side effects.

Try not to be afraid - it just might work great for you too.,F,55,10  days,7/30/2009,Metronidazole

Flagyl (Metronidazole is the generic I am taking)  500mg 3X/day and Ciproflox (generic for Cipro)  500mg 2X/day made me feel horrible on Day 1 and Day 2_ so much on Day 2 that I went back to hospital. Apparently these drugs together _ plus the fact your body is fighting an infection_ make you feel really bad. However_ my nausea_ tingling_ rapid heart beat_ totally ""out of it"" and pressurized head/forehead sensations_ can't stand noises or someone talking to me--it's that bad-- subside around noon. I feel tired the rest of the day. I have deterimined it's the morning  combo of these drugs--Metro. is taken alone at around 3pm for me--that is making it so awful. I am not noticing the nightitime effect b/c I""m asleep by 10 or 11 (taking Tylenol now too) and am ""missing' this awful feeling.

993, 3, Wisdom Tooth Infection,mild abdominal pain_ mild nausea_ sleep disturbance.,i can't judge if the medication has worked as i'm only on day 2 of a 3x400mg 5 day course. the pain has declined slightly and the swelling is much better than it was before so it seems to be doing the right thing. side effects are only mild_ and the nausea is only for an hour or so almost immediately after taking the tablet but this is more than likely the taste_ and the amount of water i chug down to get it down. the bad taste in my mouth goes pretty much as soon as the tablet is gone so i didn't bother to write it in symptoms. if no symptoms develop or worsen in the next 3 days_ i'd say i've had a good experience with it. and just to clear something up_ anyone reading this page who is now petrified of taking the medication just as i was because of the long list of severe symptoms.. don't be. this is a few hundered people out of the millions of people that take them_ and it is very rare for people to actually bother sharing a good experience with medication online_ because it is human nature to complain.,F,18,5  days,5/7/2009,Metronidazole

Now the doc has gone all-out and has ordered me to take Flagyl three times a day for 14 days_ along with Primaquine once a day_ in a final desperate attempt to completely rid myself of my Giardiasis. The first two courses weren't all that bad. Yes I had the bad taste and dark brown urine_ but that's about it. This time though_ I got a whole slew of new side effects. On top of the bad taste and dark urine_ I now also have extreme exhaustion_ odd sleep disturbances (imagine waking up in the middle of the night not knowing where you are_ or WHO you are)_ the absolute worst-smelling bowel movements I've ever had_ and the most disturbing side effect...gradually increasing depression.

1014, 5, Undiagnosible Severe Abdominal Pain,The first day I had a slight headache_ not enough to stress about. Then the next two days I had no side effects at all. Then the fourth day all hell broke loose_ my localized pain in the gallbladder area got significantly worse. I started searching online for side effects and I found out about Herxheimer Reaction which is when a strong antibiotic is working often the problem getting treated becomes more severe before it gets better. I decided this was probably the case and stuck out the next six days of hell- eventually every muscle in my body hurt so bad I couldn't get out of bed. The acupuncture and acupressure massages I had been using for pain up until this point seemed less effective and I wouldn't recommend planning anything for the end week of a ten day dosage of this because I couldn't do a thing. The side effects also dragged on for about five days after going off Flagyl with achyness in my muscles and joints throughout my body. But the localized pain was gone so I went off th,This drug was like a miracle treatment for me. I had been bedridden and in extreme pain for almost four months before taking Flagyl. The Gastro-Interologist I had seen told me that I would likely be bedridden like that for 6-9 months longer and that my pain would just suddenly go away and there was no way to tell what caused it. That didn't sound right to me so I pushed to see Infectious Diseases and the nice doctor I met there told me that it is very hard to test for certain tropical diseases_ that the timeline of getting sick two weeks after getting back from the Darien jungle of Panama did sound like I probably contracted something and that Flagyl might not work_ or it could possibly work. For me that hell for ten days would have been worth it just to have a chance at getting better_ and boy did it work. Last night my friends came into town and we closed down the bar- and I still had energy left over.... compared to the four months before that in bed where surviving a trip the grocery store without collapsing was a major accomplishment_ I'd say this was seriously a wonder drug for me.,F,29,10  days,3/28/2009Email,Metronidazole

Every time I take one_ it gets stuck in my throat (EVERY TIME!) and I almost throw up. These are NASTY.,Although these tablets do what it says on the packet_ they have some really nasty side affects that seem to happen a lot more regularly than what is said on the information sheet. I think maybe all of us who are complaining should write into the company and let them know - these tablets really need to be improved on!!!,F,24,5  days,2/18/2009,Metronidazole
1037, 1, diverticulitis,extreme nausea and horrible taste in my mouth.  Was supposed to take it for 10 days +cipro. .,.com Went to my holistic doctor_ who unfortunately was out of town last week when this all started.  1st for nausea she gave me biotin ( one of the vitamin Bs) 2 3x/day-  improved dramatically within 20 minutes.  2nd she was totally surprised they had put me on Flagyl as my problem is   systemic candidiasis (yeast infection) which actually gets worse with Flagyl.  Also Flagyl is a known carcinogen.      Dont know if you can put websites here; but if you put Flagyl+carcinogen in Google youll get a whole slew of sites including rxlist.  Ck out there 3rd page. She also mentioned that even if the Flagyl was killing a bad bacteria you had that you should also be put on major probioitics_ especially after youre thru with it. I was put on 3 probiotics,F,62,5  days,2/17/2009,Metronidazole

1039, 1, bv,The first 2 days I was a bit irritable_ headachy_ tired_ and flushed_ and had a sore throat.  Day 3 and 4 added very sensitive skin and a tiny bit of tingling and numbness in my left arm_ an inability to sleep much_ bad dreams when I did sleep_ paranoia and depression.  I couldn't imagine how I'd get through the next 3 days - they just seemed insurmountable and I was crying about everything. At the end of day 4_ my headache was a lot worse so I took 2 ibuprofen gel caps and as soon as they kicked in_ all the other symptoms disappeared and I felt calm_ positive and got a good night's sleep.   It's the end of day 6 now.  I'm still taking a few ibuprofen every day and apart from being tired and napping I feel okay.  The paranoia before I used the ibuprofen was awful_ though.  I don't know if the two are connected but the change in how I felt was almost immediate.   The side effects were so bizarre I don't think I'd take it again.,It did seem to clear up the problem.  This website made me feel a lot better during the worst of it.  I wouldn't recommend this antibiotic to anyone_ though_ unless there was absolutely nothing else that would work_ as the mental part of the side effects were just too scary.,F,49,7  days,2/15/2009,Metronidazole

I didn't notice any physical effects while taking it_ though I did have a decreased appetite and didn't eat much toward the end. By the time I finished the last dose_ it felt as if my entire body chemistry had changed. My sweat and urine smelled rancid_ I had a fear of going near anyone and was could barely go out in public. For about 4 days afterward_ I couldn't eat_ sleep_ was extremely paranoid_ anxious_ and one night practically had menopause-like symptoms with hot flashes and extreme mood swings.  This stuff was like LSD. I even wound up in the ER one night because I was convinced my body was shutting down. ,"THIS ""MEDICINE"" ALMOST RUINED MY LIFE. I was prescribed this for suspected BV (though the doctor didn't even do a culture) and given an oral dose without ANY discussion about the strength or possible side effects. I should have known something was up when the pharmacy tech was like ""oh_ that's rough stuff."" But all she warned me about was that it could upset my stomach and not to drink alcohol.  I lost a week of work_ spent a fortune on doctor's visits and medical tests_ each time telling them that I had been on this medicine and NOT ONE brought it up as a potential cause of my distress. It wasn't until I went to a new gyno and she said something about me being so anxious that I even thought about possible emotional/mental side effects of the drug. Then I went searching on the internet and found this site and saw others had emotional issues with it as well.",F,26,7  days,2/12/2009,Metronidazole
1042, 2, bv,Bad taste_ made food taste bad.  I take it after meals now and this also seems to help the stomach pain_ and then I can eat.

I hope it works as I will not be taking this medicine again.  Also I indulged in some red wine last night and did not get sick_ but I think it may have exacerbated my other symptoms and I also could drink a lot less than I normally could without getting very intoxicated.,F,19,3  days,2/12/2009,Metronidazole

I was not be able to work 8 hours a day in my office.  Doctor said I could stop it if that was that bad after 10 days.  I asked him about the relapse_ so he then suggested that if I could take it_ then finished it.  I decided to finish it since the relapse treatment will be another 21 days.,If you don't need to take anti-biotic_ then don't.  They are harmful to yourbody.

1058, 1, BV,I had already experienced some anxiety about issues. I started taking a low dose of lexapro (an antidepresant which takes several weeks to kick in). I had been off and on Metrodinazole for 5 months! Every time I took this mediciation I never really noticed anything out of the ordinary. Some anxiety here and there_ but I'm just a normally anxious person. My BV never cleared up. It just kept coming back worse and worse each time. So I went back on the medication last Friday. Friday afternoon I had thoughts of suicide. I have never felt that way before. The rest of the week I woke up with extreme depression and thoughts of suicide_ panic attacks. I wanted to break up with my boyfriend (who has made me so happy) because I thought I fell out of love with him. I wanted to do nothing but sleep. I was so confused_ dizzy_ dazed. No appetite. Saturday afternoon I fel so low. Every thought that used to bring me happiness brought me sadness. I also had a very watery/smlly/brown/clear discharge_ an,Someone tell me this is okay. That I am not losing my mind. Thats its definately these medications. I would never take this metrodinazole again after reading some of these comments. Id rather suffer through this infection. Im afraid it has killed my happiness_ my relationship_ my job.  I don't know if its just me or the medicine_ but I have never thought about suicide in my life.

I've been on Metronidazole (also called Flagyl) for four days now and have experienced marked changes in mood_ sleep_ energy level_ and mental alertness (maybe from poor sleep).  The BV for which I'm taking the drug seems to have cleared up entirely (Yea!). But I hope the mood and sleep effects of the drug wear off quickly after cessation of treatment! Advice for people who have had a depressive episode in the past or who currently are on an SSRI for depression: Maybe discuss with your doctor increasing your SSRI dose a couple of days in advance of starting a course of Metro ... or just be aware that this is a potential side effect.,F,34,4  days,1/10/2009,Metronidazole
1060, 4, Wisdom tooth infection,I was in agony with my tooth and gum and as per usual no emergency dentist over the Christmas period...so after 3 hours in A&E and a few days of penicillin I managed to get to my dentist_ Hurrah!!!

During the 3 days I took the Metro_ I did notexperience many of the abdominal side-effects_ but I also ate plenty of yogurt withacidophilus to prevent a potential yeast infection and also ate probiotics(DanActive yogurt drink) to hopefully prevent the GI issues as well. The Clindessewas a one-time application that cured the BV within a day - MAJOR PLUS was beingable to drink alcohol!! Also_ I see that many folks were prescribed Metronidazol fordental infections - amoxicillin and clindomyacin are 2 alternatives you may want toask your doctor about.FOR THOSE WITH RECURRENT BV: Inquire about having your partner treated - men can becarriers of the bacteria and reinfecting you.

It did_ however_ interfere with my social life since I was strongly urged by both my doctor and the pharmicist not to drink any alcohol on it_ which I complied with.

Also_ do NOT mix this medication with anything! I developed a headache at work and ingested three regular-strength Tylenol that morning. By the afternoon_ I was vomiting so bad it hurt. When I wasn't vomiting_ I was nauseated and wished that I could regurgitate so I could just feel better. The taste of this medicine is the worst you'll ever experience. Nothing I took helped.

Since then I have suffered from a sore throat_ a furry tongue_ dizziness_ headaches and just general tiredness_ I am finding it very hard to do anything.,It did clear up my symptoms although my doctors were very little help.

It is doing what it is supposed to as far as the infection goes_ but the side effects are close to unbearable.  I am calling Dr. in the a.m._ because in all my searching I am finding that BV isn't typically treated at the dosage level I am on (500mg 3x/day for 7 days).  Although_ it appears that people on lighter doses are experiencing same discomfort_ so there is probably nothing that can be done_ except to finish this horrible stuff.,ALWAYS FINISH YOUR ANTIBIOTICS (or have your doc put you on an alternative one) because when the medicine attacks the infection_ it is the weakest bacterial cells that die first.  The last cells to die are the STRONGEST.  If you don't finish the medicine_ you leave behind only the strongest bacteria_ and then they begin to reproduce....THIS IS HOW WE END UP WITH ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT INFECTIONS!!!

Going to reduce it by half the 400 3x daily dose (7 day treatment) i'm on and see if that helps. If not i'm off it and i'll take my chances.

1179, 1, Suspected womb infection,My daughter was given this during chemotherapy treatment for leukaemia.  She experienced severe nausea and several of the other listed side effects but more worryingly she developed a tremor in her jaw that became so severe after a few day she couldn't speak and had difficulty swallowing.  The docs thought it was a neurological problem due to the leukaemia but it ended up being a toxic reaction to this drug.  It caused an inflammation of her white brain matter.,Nobody has ever listed this kind of reaction before and for 6 weeks the docs kept telling us it was something else causing the reaction until they ruled everything else out and had to admit that it was the drug - which we'd been saying from the beginning as the symptoms only came after taking it and went after we refused to allow my daughter anymore of it.  Watch out - if it can happen to us it could happen to you.  Trust your body - if you think something is happening that isn't right and you think it's the drug insist that they take you off it.  Just because the literature doesn't report it doesn't mean it can't happen.,F,39,7  days,1/31/2008Email,Metronidazole

I took this same medication in my early 30s and don't recall any side effects.  My family doctor prescribed the creme ""Metrogel"" 4 months ago but (as predicted by my Gynecologist) the BV returned.  My doctor told me the oral medication usually works better than the creme.

I had sleeping problems prior but it wasn't like this and it was going in a positive direction until I started taking this.,I don't really know if this med is working as I had not symptoms of the infection until I went to the doctor because my period was going on two weeks and i'm on the pill.

I tried different smelling lotions and came out with the same outcome on my skin. Loss of appetite. Side effects changed on a daily basis. Never knew what to expect. Toothache_ left ear ache all the way down my neck (eustatian tube inflammation I thought). Back ache_ left chest ache. Pains moved each day. Ibuprofen helped a lot. Hope I do not have lasting effects.,Infection cleared but I would suggest a cream next time or the branded med to the generic as I do believe branded meds have far less side effects. I cannot believe generic companies can manufacture such drugs and do not even have to have FDA approval.,F,26,7  days,11/26/2007,Metronidazole

Feeling heat sensation under my skin at various areas in my body.  Comes in waves.  Can't sleep.  Dry Mouth began after pill 7. Another 3 days could have been hell.,Stopped taking after 7 pills because of the heat/flushing sensation seemed to become more intense and cold sweats_ upon recommendation of doctor and pharmacist.  I was really apprehensive before I even started this treatment_ but because BV was not pleasant_ thought I'd give it a try.  I WISH I would have seen this website prior.  DO NOT TAKE!  Ask for another treatment method.

1212, 1, diverticulitis,I was given this in conjunction with Ciprofloxacin_ and was instructed to take the Metronidazole 4 times a day and the Ciprofloxacin only 2 times a day. Each time I take one of the Metronidazole_ within thirty minutes I feel as if I have taken strong sleeping pills. Also I felt nauseated_ more bloating and pain than ever. Along with the sleepiness comes a feeling of hopelessness and depression and a sense of impending doom. At night_ even though it is making me feel sleepy_ I wake up with feelings of unexplainable and irrational panic.,I've never had a problem with the Cipro medicine_ but this is my second attempt at trying to deal with Metronidazole. I'm a cancer survivor_ and I can easily say that Metronidazole is the worst medicine I've ever experienced. The taste alone is enough to make a person gag_ and the taste remains in my mouth no matter what I use to mask it. I will never take this medicine again. There needs to be an alternative.,F,58,6  days,11/11/2007,Metronidazole

Severe Depression and mood swings_ nausea_ vomiting_ metalic taste_ foggy concentration_ sweats and shaking,"I had tried the insertion gel treatment initially but had been interupted by my onset of my period so I started taking this as a second try.   I thought that I was going CRAZY until I saw this message board. The side effects listed on the medicine did not have the total actuall side effects.   I felt nausea on the 2nd day_ threw up on the 3rd day_ my good friend was visiting and I had a total depressed crying melt down and was literally going to ask her for an aliby so that I could kill my boyfriend (who we have been HAPPILY together for 7 years)_ The headache was sooo bad that I had blurry vision and could not think straight. Again_ I thought I was going crazy until I saw this board- I am STOPPING THIS MEDICINE. I was prescribed 7 days.

1214, 3, Bacterial Vaginosis,Dizziness_ light-headedness_ body aches_ severe anxiety.,I've rated this medication a three because while it worked exceptionally well to treat my BV_ the side effects made it almost unbearable.  I was taking two 250 mg pills_ twice a day_ for seven days.  I felt fine the first day and a half_ but after that I started feeling dizzy and a little unsteady.  I would bump into things while walking around the house.  I also started getting weird aches in my body that almost felt like the growing pains you got as a kid.  I would get these aches in my ankles_ my back_ my neck_ my arms_ and my legs. On the morning of the second day I awoke to find that I had a thick green mucousy vaginal discharge.  I called my doctor about this since_ even with the BV this was a symptom I was not having before.  She said that it was normal_ because my body was expelling the bacteria_ but if it persisted for more then a few days to call again.  The worst though was the anxiety I had on this medication.

It felt like someone poured hydrochloiric acid down my throat_ but the side efffects were a better pain than before the meds. BEWARE- Metronidazole and Flagyl_ although they are the same substance_ are actually manufactured differently. I took Metronidazole with much improvement for 5 days. On the 6th day_ the pharmacy only had Flagyl left and so I got Flagyl. the next day I began diarrheaing continuously and vomiting on the 28th hour of the meds and was admitted to the hospital. The first 6 days were 500MG 3x a day..The Flagyl was 400 MG 3 times a day.

Diverticulitis is a serious possibly life threatening illness and unfortunately_ once the infections clears_ you're still going to have diverticulosis...so it's important to clear ALL of the infection to avoid continued bouts of diverticulitis.  I_ for one_ would not just STOP taking ANY antibiotic without notifiying my doctor.  I would avoid the surgery at any cost...this surgery takes a length of your colon and could put you on a colostomy bag for life.,F,46,11  days,10/20/2007,Metronidazole

Cannot think straight.,They do not list depression and anxiety as a side effect - why not.  Thought I was going mad until I found this page.  Very funny because I was on this drug 3 years ago for an ear infection and at the time I got it into my head that I was going to die from the infection.

Fortunately_ I read all the comments here before I started taking the drug_ and was able to ask my doctor to prescribe clindamycin vaginal cream instead.  (It's the generic of Dalacin C.)",An article in the November_ 1995 Journal of Family Practice compared the treatment of BV by oral metronidazole_ matronidazole vaginal gel_ and clindamycin vaginal cream_ and concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in cure rates among the treatments.  So_ if you have BV and you're looking for an alternative to taking metronidazole_ you may want to ask your physician about clindamycin cream.

1229, 1, Prevent Bacterial Infection,I had a procedure that requires me to take this medicine to prevent a bacterial infection.  I am almost done (3 pills left - 1 & 1/2 days) & could not be happier.  It by far has been the worst medicine I have ever had to take in my life.  I have read all of these posts & have to agree that after I take my pill each morning & night I become sad & extremely paranoid about any symptoms I am having from my procedure.  I have found myself crying in the bathroom at work even afraid I might be dying. I have to say that to me the far worst side effect I have experienced is the taste of the pill and the burning feeling that starts down my lungs and into my stomach.  It causes me to gag and has even caused me to throw up. I have never gagged/dry heaved so much in my life.  And one more thing_ it has made me bloat up 2 sizes in my clothing.

This drug put me on an emotional elevator straight to hell.,I've seen a lot of people mention that they stopped their meds without asking a doctor.  Although this medicine is hell in a tablet_ I urge you to please talk to your doctor before deciding on your own to stop a medication.  Your infection could become even worse.  If your doctor gives a crap he'll put you on something else.  Aside from that_ if you have to take this drug_ be forewarned that your general attitude on life may plummet straight into the toilet while you're taking metronidazole.  Not to mention the mere thought of food will turn your stomach inside out...It is an unpleasant experience to the extreme_ but I will say that it does what it is supposed to do in terms of curing an infection.

I was told that it could be and went in for him to examine them.  He had trouble even seeing them (thats how small they were). He treated the sores with silver nitrate suggested I take one more tablet to see if the symptoms worsened.  The silver nitrate actually made them look much worse_ like large white ulcerations.  I took another tablet as he suggested and a few hours later I had a red place on my lip.  It was not what I would call a sore or a blister.  It was redish/purple and was not open_ wet or painful.

This is nasty stuff and I pray it worked.,"Olive oil helped with the nausea.  I took it with the medicine and as a ""chaser.""  Also found that grains of any kind made it worse.  It was difficult to eat anything without gagging_ and lived on a diet of olive oil_ yogurt and peanut butter.",F,67,10  days,6/2/2007,Metronidazole

Still waiting to see if it works on the BV_ but hoping so - the effects should also wear off much quicker.  If your feeling really bad on the drug - go back to your GP or GU clinic - you don't have to suffer - you can also treat it as a cream rather than by oral dosage_ or change the drug!Also_ if it helps anyone - there is a wash called Lactacyd which is designed to keep the pH balance right - I had about 18 months of on and off BV and this stuff has kept me free of it for a good 4 years now.

That said_ I am rarely affected by side effects_ but get the metallic taste_ light-headedness_ trouble sleeping (if I wake up_ I can't fall back to sleep)_ and constant low-level nausea the entire time I'm on the meds.  It is horrible - but a Crohn's flare is worse.,This is a class of drugs called Protazoels or something like that - there are only about 10 brand names_ and half of them are Metronidazole by different makers. We expect medicine to do a difficult job_ but also not 'bother' us. I don't disagree the side effects are nasty with this_ and FAR more common than I think the literature from the pharmacy would indicate.  BUT I also think we are lucky it exists - in the past_ my alternative was steroids_ with blurry vision_ puffy chipmunk cheeks_ hair loss_ and weight gain - so I'll take metallic taste and nausea any day!,F,34,7  days,5/22/2007,Metronidazole

1336, 1, BV,This is the absolute worst fricking medicine I've ever taken and I'm so pissed that my gyn prescribed it_ especially because there are several other meds out there to combat BV. I've had a metal taste in my mouth for over a week - this is AFTER being off the meds.  My GI tract was a mess and had terrible headaches all week.

Heart Palpitations and a general feeling of nervousness or anxiety from Day-1,About Day-10_ I felt the medication was kicking-in as the chronic diarrhea stopped and stools were formed although they were soft.  Major-League sore throat starting around Day 8 and continuing till the end (Day 14) and definitely a nasty looking white-coated tongue which psychologically added to the metallic taste.

With diverticulitis_ one is on a clear liquid diet for 3 days_ which eliminates the wrap with fruit-roll-up or coat with chocolate syrup-but that's a good idea to try_ if you can.  Simultaneously taking Avelox 400 mg 1 X per day and Metronidazol 500 mg 2 X per day.  The Metronidazol may be used to prevent vaginal infection from errupting while on anti-biotics.

By Day 5 he was out of his mind. He would have a complete breakdown because he felt so sick and he normally is a very happy-go-lucky kid.  Not a big complainer.  Its definitely not right that the treatment makes you feel more sick than the illness itself!  I too am very glad I found this website because it helped us to make the decision to terminate the course immediately especially when I discovered that it is listed as a carcinogen on a website of NJ Health & Senior Services Hazardous Substance Fact Sheets. Day 1 after stopping the medicine he felt normal again.  I don't know if it killed the parasites but at this point we don't care.

It has been at least ten years since I had any antibiotic medication_ as I am a herbal girl but the pain from this thing is the reason I am taking the full course.  Apart from the lethargy_ I have loose bowels and jaw pain.  I was attributing that to the fact that suspect tooth is at the back and bottom of mouth.  Well well!! .

My  friends were getting upset that I was so irritable but I told them that I couldn't help how it! Its not your fault people. If you feel like you're dying_ its the pill. The nausea doesn't help either. Also_ don't go tanning on this stuff. I went and boy was that a mistake. I'm on day 3 of this unbearable drug but and if I stop now_ the parasite could come back even bigger than it was before. So I'm stuck in this awful state for the next 4 days.

I wake up with morning sickness and it lasts on and off throughout the day. I STRONGLY recommend that everyone gets a prescription for an anti-nausea pill. I'm taking Zoloft and so far it's helped to curb the extreme sickness. Its very rough to deal with the constant nausea. The other hard thing is you have to take Metronidazole with a lot of food and with the loss of appetite it makes it very difficult consume anything. Even the thought of food makes makes you gag. I have to take it 3 x's a day for one week. Another helpful tip: to get rid of that AWFUL taste_ put some maple syrup in a spoon or plate and with your finger_ roll the pill around in it until it's coated. Then chug quickly with a glass of milk. I did that for the first time today and i couldnt taste a thing! thank god.,F,18,7  days,2/5/2007Email,Metronidazole

Medication was prescribed following surgery and I  experienced loss of appetite_ vomiting_ cramps_ fatique_ extreme diziness and a combination of chills and flushness.  I was miserable. I was on two other antibiotics concurrent with this medication_ perhaps that caused increased discomfort.,The horrible metallic taste contributed to my extreme nausea.

It was only by reading your comments that I found my symptoms were not unusual and it helped me to complete the course. I was scared at how ill I felt. I will NEVER take these tablets again.  Ironically my dentist said I should have stopped taking the tablets and he would have prescribed something else!!  It is now 10 days since I stopped the tablets and my tongue is still furred up. I would have been worried if I had not found this website and learned that some of you have had the same problem. As well as taking metronidazole for a week I was also taking painkillers every 6 hours for a full 6 days_ then gradually less for the next 3 days. Just wish this furred tongue would clear up!!!,F,51,7  days,1/28/2007,Metronidazole
1364, 1, BV,I will NEVER take this medicine again!!! I took it about a year ago and didn't really have any problems with it_ except for the common side effects. But_ the worse was when I was sitting in a restuarant and everything got blurry and I was feeling really hot and dizzy. Well_ I stepped outside because I felt like I was going to DIE and I ended up vomiting. I felt better after that. Anyway_ I was just prescribed this medicine again a few days ago. I was scared to take it again_ but thought I could tough it out. Well_ on my second day (which is today) I started feeling tingly all down my left arm and left leg. I had taken one pill in the morning_ but didn't take the second one at night. I called my dad because he's a nurse and he said that I should discontinue the pill. Right now I'm feeling sick to my stomach and really shaky. I would not prescribe this drug to anyone_ it's AWEFUL!!!,,F,25,2  days,1/28/2007,Metronidazole
1365, 1, diverticulitus,Took the first dose of 2 tabs of 250mgs_ the doctor also gave me levaquin one a day 500mgs. After about 1hr I started to get cold and had a hard time talking with my teeth chattering. I also start to shake all over with my right hand the worse. Went to bed thinking I just had a long day of tests and this was the reason for these effects. That night was horrible with racing heart beats _hearing pounding pulses in ears. Felt like my body was plug into a light socket humming along at top speed. Felt very jumpy_ wired and sweaty. My tongue was starting to get a white coating and tasted strange. I had a ton of other effects too_ scared the hell out of me.,After about 6hrs most of the effects stopped like flipping a switch_ I suddenly felt calm and more myself again_ was so relieved I almost started to cried. I do badly with drugs and told the doctor but he acted like I was making it up or something. I did not take anymore metronidazole and call the doctor in the morning and he SAID probability the effects happen because I was all worked up about taking it. EXCUSE ME! I was so angry. He said to continue the levaquin by itself_ which he thought might be enought saying we were running out of drugs to use_ if it did not. Well maybe then he had to give me more to take then a week only. I then went online and found you guys_ I felt angry but so relieved to not be alone_ this stuff is nasty. What I can't understand is why I was not told by doctor and pharmacy about some of these effects_ they made it sound a walk in the park with few side effects. The side effects listed for levaquin are same as the onces I had with metronidazole. Was confuse,F,52,1  times,1/26/2007,Metronidazole
1366, 3, Bacterial Vaginitis,EXTREME lethargy / sleepiness. This was by far the worst effect for me - I was literally falling asleep 2 hours after waking while caring for my 2 very young children_ something I have never done before_ and it was quite frightening as I felt unsure that I would be physically able to attend to them / stay awake. Other than that_ I did have a slight metallic taste in my mouth and mild diohrrhea on day 6 & 7 of the course_ but nothing else noticeable. No headaches_ no nausea_ no depression / mood changes.,It worked - belted the BV out of existence_ which no other drug has ever done as effectively - but I must say that I would think twice about taking it again due to the extraordinary lethargy_ especially if (as this time) I was the sole carer for little children. (Unfortunately the second half of this drug course coicided with a business trip for my partner_ and I thought I was going to drop dead of tiredness by the time he got back. Usually I cope fine by myself when he's away for a few days).,F,33,7  days,1/25/2007,Metronidazole

I am taking a probiotic in conjunction with this to counteract thrush and other problems caused by antibiotics messing with your system.,A lot of people mention furry tongue and vaginal itching_ which would be caused by overgrowth of Candida - I have seen that listed as an official side effect of this drug.  In the past on other antibiotics I have also experienced diaorreha due to intestinal bacteria becoming unbalanced.  The probiotic (ie good bacteria) I am using is very easy to take_ is certified organic from a great Australian company who ship all over the world - www.organicaustralia.com.au.  I think people should be aware of the repercussions of powerful antibiotics such as metronidazole on their overall health - I believe (ab)use of antibiotics earlier in my life has led to the condition I now have to use this one to treat.,F,33,2  days,1/11/2007,Metronidazole

1379, 2, Bacterial Vaginosis,I noticed dry mouth and lightheadedness when standing from sitting or laying down.  I had no nausea or other digestive/intestinal issues.  I had slight headaches on a few days.  I was also pretty emotional the first week but that may be due to my life's circumstances at the moment and not the medication - I'm not sure.  I feel like a freak because I think I tolerated this medication very well while friends that have taken it have had lots of side effects.  My boyfriend took it at the same time as me and he had stomach problems_ constipation_ the metallic taste that lingered after taking the pill_ lightheadedness and his psoriasis (pre-existing_ not related to why he was taking the mediciation) got worse.,I took two 7 day courses of this back to back.  I never got the metallic taste in my mouth.  I never let the pill linger on my tongue because it did taste bitter.  Maybe that's why.  I always took it with food and mostly with milk as well.  I tolerated it very well - maybe I got bum lots?  Overall_ I'm VERY dissatisfied - it did NOTHING for my BV.  I went through 18 days without drinking for nothing_ it seems.

Itchy too....,Want these side effects to hurry up and go away_ the sickness is the worst.

I think I've had every side effect mentioned here that i've read so far.  they include fever_ depression_ severe pain behind my eyes_ bloating_ feeling exhausted all the time_ back pain_ shooting pains in my hands and feet.,while the doctor initially prescribed it for what he thought was a bacterial stomach infection_ it seemed to be addressing this chronic sinus infection that bactrim hadn't completely cured.  so while i was glad of the healing that it was doing for my sinuses_ i couldn't take the side effects after 4 days (i was supposed to use if for 7 days) and went to the doc who prescribed a 7day regimen of Levaquin instead.  hopefully this will be easier on my body - but only time will tell.thanks to everyone who posted on here - i thought i was going insane for a while there.,M,46,4  days,12/11/2006,Metronidazole

If the pain from the dental infection (I am a man and not able to stand tooth pain at all) was not so severe I would have stopped the medication. My only reason for carrying on was if it made me feel that shitty it must be working. I pretty much got the full monty of side effects including such a pronounced swelling of the lower face and lips that I had a bigger overbite than homer simpson. Still my daughter thought I looked funny with a head like a football. Urine very orange and not forthcoming. Kidneys turned to concrete and I swera I could feel this shit altering my DNA. As someone else posted - as close as you can get to insanity - any I didn't have any depression or similar episodes.

1406, 1, Open Wound (preventative measure),I was given this drug on an IV drip whilst in hospital after an accident. For the week that I had it I was unbelievably nauseous. I felt nauseous all the time without exception. I vomited up pretty much everything I had attempted to swallow and was even dry retching towards the end of my treatment. I felt utterly depressed and drained by the experience.,I can't say whether it did the job or not because it was used as a preventative measure along with another anti-biotic that was much kinder to me in terms of side effects. All I can say is that this combination did not result in my wound getting infected. After a week they took me off this drug and left me on the other anti-biotic as I felt like I was being tortured. If you do experience this kind of side effect with metronidazole I would stongly recommend begging your doctor to find something else that works_ because the benefits don't outweigh the price you pay in taking it.,F,23,7  days,11/12/2006,Metronidazole

I had insurance the 1st time I was diagnosed_ took the meds vaginally 1st_ didn't work; next took 1xdy/5dys_ didn't work_ next time didn't have insuran._ went to emerg. room b/c of fearful side effects & thick new discharge_ tested neg. for BV but was given Metro meds as precaution_ took 1xdy/5dys_ went back in 2 weeks b/c of thick discharge_ tested neg. for BV again_ was given Metro as precaution (Each time enduring terrible side effects ).  Research online today & found THIS site; found that ""cotton mouth or furry tongue""; defined is oral thrush; that thrush is a reaction to taking metro.  Hmmm... This could mean the last 2 times I tested neg. for BV meant I could just be experiencing ""thrush thats overgrown"".  Tell me I haven't endured taking Metro 2x for no reason to find that I was making myself worst w/thrush.  Will find out soon @ my doc.

1435, 3, C. Difficile Colitis,This is my second course of metronidazole for C. Diff.  The first course was 250mg po x3 for 10 days.  It didn't resolve my colitis_ but did lessen the symptoms somewhat.  This course is 500mg po x3 for 14 days.  Today is Day 8.  The most noteable side effect duirng the first course was the metallic taste in my mouth_ which I also have this time.  The side effects during this course are truly scaring me though: Extreme fatigue_ lack of appetite_ dizziness_ lack of coordination_ nausea_ pressure and bloating in my stomache_ and general weakness.  I'm also having some emotional swings_ which I'm not sure are a direct effect or secondary to my generally ill state.  Luckily I have these few weeks away from work.  Otherwise_ I'm not sure how I would function.  Reading the other posts_ I realize I'm not alone_ which leaves me unsure whether to contact my internist.  Truthfully though_ I'm not sure I can last another 6 1/2 days on this drug.,,M,38,14  days,8/30/2006,Metronidazole

Was on 400mg x 3 a day.,I don't know about the gum infection but I noticed a persistent ear infection was a little better on day 2; came back soon after stopping taking however.

Before I saw this site I_ like many other reviewers_ thought I was going insane!! I constantly searched the internet for possible illnesses I could have to make me feel so horrible.

After that I couldn't sleep. Next day all my muscles are fatigued and i can barely walk. I called the doctor and she said to finish the pills. Well I have and it's been 4 days since I stoped and I still have diarrea in the morning and this is the first day the nausea has gone away.

1454, 4, Infected Diverticula,This is in response to the above post from me earlier. It took 5 WEEKS from the day I stopped taking the drug until all the depression side effects were under control. I still feel some of the effects every so often but that 5 weeks was pretty awful. You have good days which feel almost normal and bad days where you feel like you can't get the depression out of your head.,I suggest drinking plenty of water AND getting outside in the sun for a few minutes each day. That seemed to help. Also I tried taking some St. John's Wort and it seemed to worsen my symptoms plus it says it takes 2-8 weeks until the effects are felt so it could have been I hadn't been taking it long enough. The metronidazole did clear my infection but with a heavy price.ALSO I had thrush (tongue fungus) as a result from this and you should always take acidopholus to help the good bacteria regain a foothold in your body. It will also help clear up the thrush.,M,27,10  days,7/20/2006,Metronidazole
1455, 3, entamoeba stomach infection,For the first 2 days I only had extremely orangish urine. Also_ I found it hard to swallow without getting stuck in my throat and leaving behind the worst taste imaginable. On Day 5_ the worst of it started. Uncontrollable sobbing_ extreme fatigue_ nausea and stomach pain_ feeling depressed and hopeless and then having panic attacks. This was followed by periods of feeling absolutely fine. And then back to feeling listless and nervous to leave the house. I didn't experience loose stools like some others_ but sometimes pass only mucous and then feel extremely tired. I'm between jobs now and don't know how I would have managed if there was somewhere I needed to be. I have 2 days left and am very tempted to go off of it but I suppose might as well finish it off. Feel like I can't cope with the emotional distress though.,The generic version that I'm taking can be cut in half before swallowing. This helps considerably. My 'somewhat satisfied' rating is based on the side-effects and not knowing if it's working. Will know with re-testing if the medication has worked.,F,33,10  days,7/14/2006,Metronidazole

REALLY spaced out_ like my head had pressure and was going to explode_ I was panicking severely_ went to emergency doctor for re-assurance_ paranoia. Disorientation and unsteady on feet.,Never again_ my problem has gone_ but this has been hell. I've lost over a week's work_ still don't feel completely right even after stopping the medication.

1468, 4, Infected Diverticula,The metallic taste was one thing but BY FAR the worst was the depression. I took this pill for 10 days and by day 5 I had a mental breakdown and was severly depressed for the remaining of the course (500mg x 3 per day). Also towards the end I had some stomach pain that prevented me from eating much (I had to force myself just so I would feel better). Good luck!!,I will say what helped was to drink A LOT of water when on this med and find someone to talk to about your depression_ it will help you get through it!! Thanks God for this message board. Seriously if I had to do it again I probably would NOT take this simply because of the depressed feeling. If you know you get easily depressed ask for something else. I finished the course yesterday and still feel the ups and downs of depression.,M,27,10  days,6/2/2006,Metronidazole

My side effects are lethargy_ occasional dizzines_ depressed mood_ dark urine_ abdominal pain_ and loose stool.  I also started chormagen so that may have some contribution.  However_ I know that the lethargy_ ocassional dizzines_ and depressed mood are from the metronidazol.,I am taking the two doses in one day.  Sometimes I take it with food and without.  I notice that I when eat food_ then take the med in that order_ my abdominal pain is decreased.  It cleared my bacterial vaginosis within 4 days. Please don't take this with alcohol!  Every website I have seen on this medication stresses it.,F,27,7  days,5/30/2006,Metronidazole
1470, 2, BV,After the first dose felt extremely lethargic.  Drowsinesses and heaviness of limbs persisted throughout the 7 day treatment.  The absolutely disgusting taste was evident immediately and the persistent souring was obviously tied in to persistent nausea.  When medication can make water taste terrible_ that's ridiculous.  I had a headache 4/7 days that fit descriptions elsewhere on this board - like a sinus headache that was trying to pop out my right eye.  Urine went darker.  I frequently woke up during the lots of sleeping I was doing in order to urinate.  Work was almost impossible with the persistent nausea and extreme tiredness.,I'm not even sure it helped!  I was diagnosed before the test was positive for bv and told to take this medication.  I'm making it through on sheer persistence but I judge the cure not worth the treatment.  Did I have bv?  I don't know.  Did this help?  I have no idea.,F,24,7  days,5/30/2006,Metronidazole

I have been having them regularly since but never had one previously.   I don't know if it's related_ but given some of the comments from others here_ I suppose it is possible.  If so_ I think it ruined my life because I continued to get them after I went off it.,This medication is hell.  It is a huge pill_ it is bitter_ it makes you feel like crap_ you can't drink a drop of alcohol when you're on it (and if you think your companions won't notice you ordered a Sprite_ think again).  And on top of all that_ it does not work.  I took it in January for 1 week for this infection (bacterial vaginosis).  It came back in about a week.  Took the drug again in March for the infection. It came back in about a week.  I am not doing anything to bring it back.  I gave up sex in the hopes it would stop coming back.  Now I am on this horrific drug again_ only for two weeks this time.  I hope I survive two weeks.  I count down the pills every time and now it's for twice as long.,F,27,14  days,4/30/2006,Metronidazole
