0, 3, bipolar 1,weight gain (7 kg over 6 months)drowsiness,i was manic and psychotic the first two months on zyprexa (I took zydis) and after two months I was stable_ coherent_ and normal again and I  understood how weird my thought processes were before. So I suppose the drug works to normalize me. Doctor wanted me to continue on medication as preventive measure for future possible psychotic episode but I noticed steady weight gain (1-2 kg per month) since January_ and even 3 kg on the sixth month. In total had gained 7 kg. I stopped the drug one month and one week now_ and I stopped gaining weight_ though I don't lose it_ despite cutting down calories and exercising 5 times a week. I recommended it for manic and psychotic treatment_ however the weight gain is too much to handle. ,F,25,6  months5 mg 1X D,7/13/2016Email,Zyprexa
1, 3, Major depressive disorder_ psychosi,Cons.. Weight gainSuicidal thinkingMissed periodsForgetfulness Pros..Increased moodDecrease in angerIncreased motivationDecreased delusional thinking,Probably the only medication with notable positive effects aside from venlafaxine.

2, 1, mania,All my life I have been famished 24/7/365. Horrible.  Fought weight gain successfully but tortured all those decades.Oddly and amazingly and joyously_ this stuff completely took away all my hunger pains. A serious miracle.HOWEVER_ even eating the same I always have_ which isn't much_ I gained about 20 pounds in 4 weeks!!  Not only that but I was fat in places I was never fat in before...distended upper stomach area_ especially.How are those two things even possible?  But that's what happened.  When I figured it out_ I stopped cold turkey. I'd rather be crazy than fat and uncomfortable.I'm having a lot of trouble losing the weight now. .. maybe my age is a factor. MD minimized the weight gain possibility. It did really help the mania_ though so I'm sad it cause d weight gain.Ps. I now take a teeny little nibble on a pill every AM to control my hunger_ which miraculously does the trick!,Many thanks to all reviewers out there!,F,62,1  months5 mg,6/1/2016,Zyprexa
3, 2, Schizophrenia,Faster than normal weight gain. 1.5 stone in 4 weeks. Fat belly that won't shift with diet or exercise. Can't awaken before 1pm (sleeping or laying in bed 14+hours) no interest in sexual activity.,The only thing that interests you is food. Any kind of sweets and fatty stuff no matter what's in it or where it comes from. You feel amazing when you stuff your face and stomach beyond full. Every activity becomes a time filler until you can eat again. Physical activity like jogging becomes so difficult because the heavily slowed metabolism makes it near impossible for you to cool down fast enough and get your now heavily shortened breath.Getting to sleep at nighttime ( previously being a night owl) is much easier but you habe no desire to get up as you only partially wake_ feeling like you have no strength at all. Lying down feels like a gift from the heavens.You can pee like a racehorse but it holds up your bowels and gives you constipation.It's kills anxiety as you dont worry about the world at large (politics_ poisons and toxins in the food production_ drug company conspiracies_ gmo mass sterilisation conspiracies_ poison in the wheat and corn_ mass social media experimentation and psych warfare through music_ the Cold War)You feel that these things are not for youYou can go into the supermarket and the shelves are fullIt's there. You consume it. You don't think of any questions.and everything is resultantly easier.Your bulging appearance is of no concern to you because your appetite for sex is non existent.You are a pet hamster,F,27,2  months12.5,5/17/2016,Zyprexa

5, 4, Bi Polar Disorder,Severe grogginess in the morning. Shaky hands. Weight gain_ at first. Dissociation! Short term memory loss. Loss of concentration. Crazy dreams. Loss of libido which isn't great when you are newly married_ it's a lot of strain to put on a relationship. Luckily_ I have an incredibly understanding partner.,Zyprexa has really helped immensely to keep my condition under control. I'm learning to live with the side effects.,F,27,1.5  years5 MG 1X D,5/9/2016,Zyprexa

It did wonders for eliminating the symptoms I was experiencing but at the same time it is bad for my physical health.

10, 1, My psychiatrist told me it was for,I hate this drug. I feel it has ruined me and done me more harm than good. I couldn't stop eating on it and I gained so much weight. What scares me now is that even though I stopped it at least 7 months ago_ my tummy is still long and round like I am pregnant. What is in my stomach?  I have lost weight every where else but tummy is the same. Do I have a disease now?  Shouldn't the side effects have cleared by now?  I am very active and I eat very healthily so what exactly is in my stomach?,,F,36,2  months2.5mg,11/27/2015Email,Zyprexa
11, 1, A friend was taking it,"I don't know the specific details of my friend's taking this drug such as frequency of taking it_ length of time taking the drug etc..All I know is that we were in the same psychiatric hospital together. And one day he said to me: ""You know_ while taking this drug for the first time in my life I feel like killing somebody"". And some months later guess what? He's on a murder charge! This drug is lethal and it's influence upon consumption is evidently deadly. I was given it too with horrific_ indescribable side effects WHICH the medical staff ignored saying ""these drugs don't have side effects""..Can you believe that?",Most if not all people I've talked to who took this drug had pretty horrifying side-effects. Perhaps if we weren't talking about a multi-billion dollar industry (pharmaceutical); perhaps if no one had any financial vested interest in the making of this drug we as a society would be free of it and all other psychiatric drugs!,M,33, ? 1X D,11/24/2015Email,Zyprexa

14, 4, Bipolar 1 disorder/Anxiety/PTSD,Dry mouth_ slight weight gain_ dissociation in the mornings_ foggy head_ tired most of the time - but I'm alive.,I am currently taking Zyprexa as an alternative to my previous antipsychotic_ Seroquel. I much prefer it. I was on 300mg per day of Seroquel with little relief for 2 years.. all the negative side effects outweighed the good. I have found Zyprexa works pretty well for me.. and the side effects have been minimal.My psych_ GP and mental health nurse are all stoked that I haven't put on much weight. My psychotic symptoms are manageable.. my mood however is unchanged.. this is due to me not wanting to take mood stabalisers as well as Olanzapine.I still can't work.. but I'm enjoying some of the things I couldn't anymore_ like music and art.,F,26,8  months10,10/6/2015Email,Zyprexa

16, 3, Bi-Polarity & Borderline PD,Obesity_ minor facial ticks_ devoid of emotion or desire or most feelings. Overall_ just rehearsing old normal behaviours without the emotional investment. Going through the motions_ so to speak.,Olanzapine is probably the best Psychiatry has to offer the extremely ill. It's a Purgatorial drug_ no question_ but it stops self-harm and harming others so long as it works on you_ the individual. Some individuals are immune to all medications_ so don't forget that Psychiatry is not mathematics. If they say they don't know_ then they're being honest. That is science. At the end of the day_ it comes down to this: do you want a certain quality of life with as little suffering as possible_ despite the fact you will die earlier than most? Or_ would you like to suffer intolerably until you're 75 years-of-age_ so long as you don't stick your head in an oven beforehand? It is a lesser of two evils drug. PS: I chose the former for 8-years_ chose the latter for 6-months_ but now am wearing the consequences of it. Can I live with it? Who knows? Can I live without it? Who knows? But I think the inevitable will happen_ and I'll forever futilely fight the reason they put me on that shit in the first-place. Welcome to the real world! Life's a bitch_ and as the great Philip Roth stated: 'You have to hand it to life for the sheer amount of tools it has its disposal to bring a man down'. All the best.,M,45,8  years10mg night,9/16/2015,Zyprexa

18, 2, Psychosis,I get restlessness and in the last five years I have had racing thoughts along with the restlessness. This can last for eight hours and then if I go to sleep with it I wake up with it in the morning. It is destroying my life. I have also developed vision problems from the anxiety of life in general and I think because of this drug.,I really want to come off this drug but the Psychiatrist say that there isn't a drug that will work as well. I am very frustrated and angry at the mental health system. Its like a living hell that I'm living and I'm sure if I come off this drug I'll be much better. It has taken away some hallucinations and delusions but I feel I could cope with the halluncinations in my life quite fine now I know what they are.

22, 2, Bipolar 2,minimal weight gain_ big appetite_ suicidal thoughts_ ALOT of cutting_ extreme fatigue. Withdraw: irritability_ less of a desire to die_ less cutting... so far_ still a big appetite and weight gain.,I started olanzapine because of a manic episode_ from then on i almost hung myself_ i cut excessivly.. superficial but bad_ i take it on and off_ i'm really just trying to save up for an overdose. This med seems to help people as well as hinder them. i suggest this if you want to die. I tried summoning a demon and that was really out of the ordinary. Now that i've stopped i still have suicidal thoughts but less and no suicide attempts. i can't focus on school and my grades are plummeting. I still hate my life though it's great. idk i just really really want this all to be over but i need like 500 mg just to be in a 3 day coma or something.. i really hope this pill kills me because it's almost like a sleeping pill for me. i don't want to get fat and i'm done with a perfectly fine life..,M,15,1  years20 mg xD,5/14/2015,Zyprexa

My fiance suffers from schizoaffective disorder_ which is the worst of both worlds: schizophrenia and manic phase of bipolar.   He doesn't want to take meds long term_ so I keep Zyprexa on hand because thus far it is the ONLY drug that takes him out of a manic schizophrenic attack and keeps him out of the hospital.  As a pharmacologist myself_ I feel that Zyprexa_ a very powerful and effective drug_ should be used only as a prophylaxis for a short time and then weaning off_ but not for long-term usage.  Zyprexa is truly a miracle drug_ and I laud Eli Lilly for manufacturing it!,M,31,5  days30 1X D,1/5/2015Email,Zyprexa

I'm a 21 year old fashion student and I was a size 24/25 in jeans and now I can't even fit into any of my jeans I'm bursting out of them. All I do is think about eating and my portions have never been bigger. I crave things I normally would never eat like chocolate and junk food and ice cream. I can eat 3 bowls of cereal at one sitting and still want more. I have a gut and I've taken weight loss pills to try to burn the fat as well as working out but my weight went from 108 to 128. Very depressed about that. I also have no desire to have sex with my boyfriend anymore which is ruining our relationship.

I also have an eating disorder and the weight gain made it worse! However_ in all fairness_ it is an overall good drug and I really liked it; made me feel calm; helped my anxiety and depression_ and helped me sleep_ but I couldn't deal with the extreme weight gain. Dr took me off Zyprexa and put me on Abilify. 3rd day off Zyprexa and so far no withdrawal symptoms. This is a good drug if you can deal with the weight gain.

49, 1, Withdrawal problems,Breathing problems - probably kills me (dysautonomia?),Zyprexa is just deadly drug - one should try to discontinue it before its TOO LATE (but withdrawal can kill too).,M,32,2  years10 1X D,6/30/2013,Zyprexa
50, 1, Bipolar 1,Gained weight so much weight. Lethargic. No way to live life. Took about 5 weeks to get in my system.,Never should have stayed on it 2 years,F,45,2  years 1X D,6/14/2013Email,Zyprexa
51, 4, Psychosis_Severe Depression,weight gain_ increased appetite_ insomnia (but has gotten better).,This drug is a godsend_this has killed most of my anxiety but its not completely gone_I havent felt this good in many_many months.Now I feel like i'm ready to face the world without any problems.,F,18,3  weeks10 1X D,4/22/2013Email,Zyprexa
52, 3, Schizophrenia,1. Debilitating Sedation - I was unable to function_ plain and simple. I slept between 14-18 hours per day for all five years on the med.2. Moderate weight gain - I gained around 25 pounds and I am a rather skinny person (I never became obese but I was rather unhealthy and lacked motivation to exercise or eat right).3. Depressive Symptoms - Schizophrenia and depressive bouts come together_ but this drug made it much worse (and it improved upon stopping the drug). In fact_ my two hospitalizations in this time were due to depression not schizophrenia!,Despite the side effects and horrible impact on overall quality of life_ for people with bad symptoms who cannot stand EPS symptoms and akathisia_ this drug is a good option. In fact_ at one point_ I was on a nearly unheard of 40 mg per day (equivalant to 15 or more mg of Risperidone) and had no movement problems at all. That is remarkable IMO. It was the right drug for me at the time (when I was not familiar with the scary symptoms of Schizophrenia yet).,M,25,5  years20 MG 1X D,3/25/2013Email,Zyprexa

54, 3, schizoaffective disorder,I've put on 80lbs and developed diabetes . It helped when I was psychotic and I suffer terrible insomnia and other symtoms when I try to come off it. I also get nightmares. And I can't orgasm. Also I can't write or read anymore . I feel lost and bored and I donttake pleasure in anything.I want to come off it but I've tried before and it makes me so completey exhausted I go back on it.,,F,44,10  years20 mg,3/16/2013Email,Zyprexa

56, 1, Stressful life events,Initially none. Started due to dishonest doctors diagnosing me to be in psychosis. After reducing dosage to 5mg/day there is pale skin. Now after 3 years of use I have breathing problems and maybe some kind of heart problems.,I think I'm slowly dying to Zyprexa. Some kind of pseudoparkinsonism (hard to initiate movements) and heart failure symptoms related breathing. I think I will try to discontinue although I'm probably suicidal [need to use statins - there is at least atherosclerosis and other problems]. http://nonpsychiatry.wordpress.com/Films: V for Vendetta_ Matrix_ CCHR: Psychiatry Industry of Death_ Batman 3 (breathing) etc.,M,32,3  years20 1X D,2/8/2013,Zyprexa
57, 1, OCD thoughts,Worst drug ever! Withdrawl symptoms are still with me after only talking this for 2 weeks. It's been 4 weeks since I stopped. Medicine made me feel like a zombie. I had really bad dissociation from the med.  I had extreme anxiety getting off of it..like bugs crawling on me_ I can no longer nap with my kids during the day cause I am too wired and I have insomnia at night. I sleep for 4 hours and wake up every hour after that with my heart racing from anxiety. Don't not take it unless its your last option!! Withdrawl is bad! Do your research...worse than heroin they say!!,,F,36,2  weeks,1/16/2013Email,Zyprexa

59, 1, depression,I had a weight gain of 20 lbs in 4 months even if i only ate fruits and salads...fatigue and sleepiness ..i have stopped taking it the past 2 nights and have no intention of going back to it  it was prescribed as a mood stabilizer for my depression yet the unexpected weight gain and self esteem plummeting as i have never had an issue with my weight_ the negatives outweigh three positives.,,M,,4  months2.5,12/3/2012,Zyprexa
