0, 3, bipolar 1,weight gain (7 kg over 6 months)drowsiness,i was manic and psychotic the first two months on zyprexa (I took zydis) and after two months I was stable_ coherent_ and normal again and I  understood how weird my thought processes were before. So I suppose the drug works to normalize me. Doctor wanted me to continue on medication as preventive measure for future possible psychotic episode but I noticed steady weight gain (1-2 kg per month) since January_ and even 3 kg on the sixth month. In total had gained 7 kg. I stopped the drug one month and one week now_ and I stopped gaining weight_ though I don't lose it_ despite cutting down calories and exercising 5 times a week. I recommended it for manic and psychotic treatment_ however the weight gain is too much to handle. ,F,25,6  months5 mg 1X D,7/13/2016Email,Zyprexa
1, 3, Major depressive disorder_ psychosi,Cons.. Weight gainSuicidal thinkingMissed periodsForgetfulness Pros..Increased moodDecrease in angerIncreased motivationDecreased delusional thinking,Probably the only medication with notable positive effects aside from venlafaxine.

2, 1, mania,All my life I have been famished 24/7/365. Horrible.  Fought weight gain successfully but tortured all those decades.Oddly and amazingly and joyously_ this stuff completely took away all my hunger pains. A serious miracle.HOWEVER_ even eating the same I always have_ which isn't much_ I gained about 20 pounds in 4 weeks!!  Not only that but I was fat in places I was never fat in before...distended upper stomach area_ especially.How are those two things even possible?  But that's what happened.  When I figured it out_ I stopped cold turkey. I'd rather be crazy than fat and uncomfortable.I'm having a lot of trouble losing the weight now. .. maybe my age is a factor. MD minimized the weight gain possibility. It did really help the mania_ though so I'm sad it cause d weight gain.Ps. I now take a teeny little nibble on a pill every AM to control my hunger_ which miraculously does the trick!,Many thanks to all reviewers out there!,F,62,1  months5 mg,6/1/2016,Zyprexa
3, 2, Schizophrenia,Faster than normal weight gain. 1.5 stone in 4 weeks. Fat belly that won't shift with diet or exercise. Can't awaken before 1pm (sleeping or laying in bed 14+hours) no interest in sexual activity.,The only thing that interests you is food. Any kind of sweets and fatty stuff no matter what's in it or where it comes from. You feel amazing when you stuff your face and stomach beyond full. Every activity becomes a time filler until you can eat again. Physical activity like jogging becomes so difficult because the heavily slowed metabolism makes it near impossible for you to cool down fast enough and get your now heavily shortened breath.Getting to sleep at nighttime ( previously being a night owl) is much easier but you habe no desire to get up as you only partially wake_ feeling like you have no strength at all. Lying down feels like a gift from the heavens.You can pee like a racehorse but it holds up your bowels and gives you constipation.It's kills anxiety as you dont worry about the world at large (politics_ poisons and toxins in the food production_ drug company conspiracies_ gmo mass sterilisation conspiracies_ poison in the wheat and corn_ mass social media experimentation and psych warfare through music_ the Cold War)You feel that these things are not for youYou can go into the supermarket and the shelves are fullIt's there. You consume it. You don't think of any questions.and everything is resultantly easier.Your bulging appearance is of no concern to you because your appetite for sex is non existent.You are a pet hamster,F,27,2  months12.5,5/17/2016,Zyprexa

5, 4, Bi Polar Disorder,Severe grogginess in the morning. Shaky hands. Weight gain_ at first. Dissociation! Short term memory loss. Loss of concentration. Crazy dreams. Loss of libido which isn't great when you are newly married_ it's a lot of strain to put on a relationship. Luckily_ I have an incredibly understanding partner.,Zyprexa has really helped immensely to keep my condition under control. I'm learning to live with the side effects.,F,27,1.5  years5 MG 1X D,5/9/2016,Zyprexa

It did wonders for eliminating the symptoms I was experiencing but at the same time it is bad for my physical health.

10, 1, My psychiatrist told me it was for,I hate this drug. I feel it has ruined me and done me more harm than good. I couldn't stop eating on it and I gained so much weight. What scares me now is that even though I stopped it at least 7 months ago_ my tummy is still long and round like I am pregnant. What is in my stomach?  I have lost weight every where else but tummy is the same. Do I have a disease now?  Shouldn't the side effects have cleared by now?  I am very active and I eat very healthily so what exactly is in my stomach?,,F,36,2  months2.5mg,11/27/2015Email,Zyprexa
11, 1, A friend was taking it,"I don't know the specific details of my friend's taking this drug such as frequency of taking it_ length of time taking the drug etc..All I know is that we were in the same psychiatric hospital together. And one day he said to me: ""You know_ while taking this drug for the first time in my life I feel like killing somebody"". And some months later guess what? He's on a murder charge! This drug is lethal and it's influence upon consumption is evidently deadly. I was given it too with horrific_ indescribable side effects WHICH the medical staff ignored saying ""these drugs don't have side effects""..Can you believe that?",Most if not all people I've talked to who took this drug had pretty horrifying side-effects. Perhaps if we weren't talking about a multi-billion dollar industry (pharmaceutical); perhaps if no one had any financial vested interest in the making of this drug we as a society would be free of it and all other psychiatric drugs!,M,33, ? 1X D,11/24/2015Email,Zyprexa

14, 4, Bipolar 1 disorder/Anxiety/PTSD,Dry mouth_ slight weight gain_ dissociation in the mornings_ foggy head_ tired most of the time - but I'm alive.,I am currently taking Zyprexa as an alternative to my previous antipsychotic_ Seroquel. I much prefer it. I was on 300mg per day of Seroquel with little relief for 2 years.. all the negative side effects outweighed the good. I have found Zyprexa works pretty well for me.. and the side effects have been minimal.My psych_ GP and mental health nurse are all stoked that I haven't put on much weight. My psychotic symptoms are manageable.. my mood however is unchanged.. this is due to me not wanting to take mood stabalisers as well as Olanzapine.I still can't work.. but I'm enjoying some of the things I couldn't anymore_ like music and art.,F,26,8  months10,10/6/2015Email,Zyprexa

16, 3, Bi-Polarity & Borderline PD,Obesity_ minor facial ticks_ devoid of emotion or desire or most feelings. Overall_ just rehearsing old normal behaviours without the emotional investment. Going through the motions_ so to speak.,Olanzapine is probably the best Psychiatry has to offer the extremely ill. It's a Purgatorial drug_ no question_ but it stops self-harm and harming others so long as it works on you_ the individual. Some individuals are immune to all medications_ so don't forget that Psychiatry is not mathematics. If they say they don't know_ then they're being honest. That is science. At the end of the day_ it comes down to this: do you want a certain quality of life with as little suffering as possible_ despite the fact you will die earlier than most? Or_ would you like to suffer intolerably until you're 75 years-of-age_ so long as you don't stick your head in an oven beforehand? It is a lesser of two evils drug. PS: I chose the former for 8-years_ chose the latter for 6-months_ but now am wearing the consequences of it. Can I live with it? Who knows? Can I live without it? Who knows? But I think the inevitable will happen_ and I'll forever futilely fight the reason they put me on that shit in the first-place. Welcome to the real world! Life's a bitch_ and as the great Philip Roth stated: 'You have to hand it to life for the sheer amount of tools it has its disposal to bring a man down'. All the best.,M,45,8  years10mg night,9/16/2015,Zyprexa

18, 2, Psychosis,I get restlessness and in the last five years I have had racing thoughts along with the restlessness. This can last for eight hours and then if I go to sleep with it I wake up with it in the morning. It is destroying my life. I have also developed vision problems from the anxiety of life in general and I think because of this drug.,I really want to come off this drug but the Psychiatrist say that there isn't a drug that will work as well. I am very frustrated and angry at the mental health system. Its like a living hell that I'm living and I'm sure if I come off this drug I'll be much better. It has taken away some hallucinations and delusions but I feel I could cope with the halluncinations in my life quite fine now I know what they are.

22, 2, Bipolar 2,minimal weight gain_ big appetite_ suicidal thoughts_ ALOT of cutting_ extreme fatigue. Withdraw: irritability_ less of a desire to die_ less cutting... so far_ still a big appetite and weight gain.,I started olanzapine because of a manic episode_ from then on i almost hung myself_ i cut excessivly.. superficial but bad_ i take it on and off_ i'm really just trying to save up for an overdose. This med seems to help people as well as hinder them. i suggest this if you want to die. I tried summoning a demon and that was really out of the ordinary. Now that i've stopped i still have suicidal thoughts but less and no suicide attempts. i can't focus on school and my grades are plummeting. I still hate my life though it's great. idk i just really really want this all to be over but i need like 500 mg just to be in a 3 day coma or something.. i really hope this pill kills me because it's almost like a sleeping pill for me. i don't want to get fat and i'm done with a perfectly fine life..,M,15,1  years20 mg xD,5/14/2015,Zyprexa

My fiance suffers from schizoaffective disorder_ which is the worst of both worlds: schizophrenia and manic phase of bipolar.   He doesn't want to take meds long term_ so I keep Zyprexa on hand because thus far it is the ONLY drug that takes him out of a manic schizophrenic attack and keeps him out of the hospital.  As a pharmacologist myself_ I feel that Zyprexa_ a very powerful and effective drug_ should be used only as a prophylaxis for a short time and then weaning off_ but not for long-term usage.  Zyprexa is truly a miracle drug_ and I laud Eli Lilly for manufacturing it!,M,31,5  days30 1X D,1/5/2015Email,Zyprexa

I'm a 21 year old fashion student and I was a size 24/25 in jeans and now I can't even fit into any of my jeans I'm bursting out of them. All I do is think about eating and my portions have never been bigger. I crave things I normally would never eat like chocolate and junk food and ice cream. I can eat 3 bowls of cereal at one sitting and still want more. I have a gut and I've taken weight loss pills to try to burn the fat as well as working out but my weight went from 108 to 128. Very depressed about that. I also have no desire to have sex with my boyfriend anymore which is ruining our relationship.

52, 3, Schizophrenia,1. Debilitating Sedation - I was unable to function_ plain and simple. I slept between 14-18 hours per day for all five years on the med.2. Moderate weight gain - I gained around 25 pounds and I am a rather skinny person (I never became obese but I was rather unhealthy and lacked motivation to exercise or eat right).3. Depressive Symptoms - Schizophrenia and depressive bouts come together_ but this drug made it much worse (and it improved upon stopping the drug). In fact_ my two hospitalizations in this time were due to depression not schizophrenia!,Despite the side effects and horrible impact on overall quality of life_ for people with bad symptoms who cannot stand EPS symptoms and akathisia_ this drug is a good option. In fact_ at one point_ I was on a nearly unheard of 40 mg per day (equivalant to 15 or more mg of Risperidone) and had no movement problems at all. That is remarkable IMO. It was the right drug for me at the time (when I was not familiar with the scary symptoms of Schizophrenia yet).,M,25,5  years20 MG 1X D,3/25/2013Email,Zyprexa

Both too high doses (side-effects) and too low doses are FATAL. DEAD-END: People get side-effects and die or people reduce dosage and die.

I experienced symptoms similar to bi-polar. Wherein I couldn't sleep_ was paranoid_ mood was elevated then suddenly sow_ I was happy one minute aggressive the next. Doctors put me on Zyprexa which helped straight away. Within a day or two I started returning to my ""normal self"" doctors wanted to keep me on zyprexa for a few months to monitor the situation just to rule out bi-polar and make sure it was a one off. During the 7 months I was on the medication my dosage was lowered as I was weaned off. However I experienced some pretty undesirable side affects. My breasts became tender and started to leak! I was constantly tired_ did not want to get out of bed_ suffered depression was bitter angry etc. I was very lethargic and felt like crying all the time. I also became very anxious_ nervous and worried. However my psychiatrist was great and eventually I came off the zyprexa totally. It is still working it's way out of my system but I am losing the weight and am much more outgoing and happy my sleep pattern and appetite have returned to normal. I have experienced an irregularity in my periods however. I went 5months without getting one since I've been off the tablets. I sometimes experience random twitching or sensitivity to stimuli.

Shaky hands in the early to mid morning.,I have suffered with general anxiety disorder and major depression since a teenager which has got progressively worse over the years.  I 1997 I was hospitalised twice for major depression and again in 1998.   I was prescribed Leponex_ a very similar drug to Zyprexor.  I felt better immediately but my doc took me off it because of the issue with blood testing.  Years passed and I forgot about Leponex.  I tried Prozac_  Ciplapram_ (Depramil) cognitive therapy and psychotherapy on and off for years.  Nothing ever took away the continuous anxiety_ unwarranted guilt_ feelings of hopelessness_ racing thoughts and varying depressive episodes.  My life_ my choices and my thinking has been crippled with this awful condition for most of my life. I have almost become a recluse.Over the last two years I have slipped into suicidal depression.  Ten days ago I told my psychiatrist how wonderful Leponex made me feel in 1997.  He put me on Zyprexa 5mg for 7 days then 10mg to follow and warned me about the possible weight gain.  Fortunately I am a tall thin guy and I dont mind something that will increase my appetite as I eat poorly.  The following day I felt great almost immediately.  No anxiety_ no panic attacks_ no dark pits of hellish depression.  Ten days later I want to declare to the world that this is nothing short of a miracle_ a life saving drug for me.

Some days I would eat a little more than 1400 calories only to end up gaining a pound or two. In the end I lost the battle_ the craving for sweet food became to much and the weight went on far to easy. I'm now on abilify which causes less weight gain than other atypical antipsychotics_ on some sites it's even considered to be weight neutral.

I am now solidly in favor of this drug ever since my doctor told me to take small doses (2.5 mg) as needed rather than a larger dose (5-10 mg) every night. Taking Zyprexa PRN has done a world of difference. I am not gaining weight anymore and my appetite is normal. I am not getting sugar cravings. And I don't feel lethargic. This med does not have to build up in your system to work. You can take it for mania as if you were taking an ibuprofen for a headache. I average none to 5 mgs of Zyprexa each day now. I have tried other meds: Depakote (terrible weight gain)_ carbamazepine (ineffective)_ and Risperdal (weird side effects_ including tricking my body into thinking it was pregnant!). None of these meds touch the effectiveness of Zyprexa. With Zyprexa I am calm and not spazzy at work_ a tendency that was beginning to hurt my professional credibility.

From this point of view_ Zyprexa falls down magnificently. I become lazy_ tired and my desire to sleep in the morning is exaggerated. So no more early trips to work or church on sunday. I have studied both an honours and a Master's degree. I could do the Master's degree on Zyprexa due to being able to work in my own time and the clarity of my thinking was good. But if I have to work according to the world's schedule of 9 to 5pm_ Zyprexa ain't gonna work. I also suddenly want to eat a lot of Dorito's sweet chilli pepper_ watching the wasteline explode.,Zyprexa is a better drug for dealing with stress. It is possible to make it through difficult times on the drug and is a significantly better drug than say_ Risperidone. However_ physically Geodon is a more healthy drug because it allows you to do more exercise while eating less. You also sleep less on Geodon. The challenge with Geodon is that the quality  of your mind on Geodon is not as good as it is on Zyprexa. The thoughts are more erratic_ less clear. However_ at the beginning of the day_ Zyprexa is a like waking up with your mind on cotton wool. As the morning passes_ this cotton wool lifts and then suddenly your mind is free of anxiety and ready to take on the day. If there was some way that you could have the Zyprexa afternoon mind with the Geodon body_ now that would be a drug worth taking....any pharmaceutical companies reading????,M,35,3  years5 1X D,11/20/2011Email,Zyprexa

Then weight gain- 20lb in 2 months; brain altered metabolism.Then neck Dystonia then Procyclidine to treat the Dystonia.(Lamotrigine/Lamictal introduced to replace Lithium because I suspected Dyskinesia_ my oesophagus became paralysed overnight.  I have not eaten solids for a year now. I have diagnoses of Tardive Dyskinesia_ Tardive Dystonia_ Chorea_ Dysphagia_ oesophageal dysmotility_ amenorrhea_ GERD_ haemorroids from constipating artificial nutrition & I will probably die within 6 months because my breathing & heart are affected too. Swallowing liquids is awful.  Doctors spent a year playing for time when the cause was obvious to everyone. There is nothing anyone can do now,Prescribed ONLY 2.5mg for hypomania/mania on an 'as & when' basis ONLY for 6 months; ONLY 5 mg for 2 days caused Cervical Dystonia 'treated' by Procyclidine.  It never went away.  Was also taking Lithium 600-800mg tapering at the same time as titrating Lamotrigine for <1 wk in total.

After three months of taking 6mg per day_ my doctor had me taking the pill every other day_ which helps me feel a little more energy on my ""off"" days.

It is the gold standard for bipolar. The pharmaceutical companies are marketing these atypical antipsychotics for mania and_ while these drugs do help_ they overmedicate. My personality became flat and I felt removed from my coworkers_ who experienced a regular range of emotion. That may sound good_ but it makes you stand out like an oddball. Also_ some doctors don't have to monitor with blood work the atypicals the way they must with Lithium. Lithium has been much more labor-intensive for my doctor_ but switching to it was the right call -- a call I fortunately insisted upon.

I was hearing some voices at the time but was not in a distressed state or likely to harm myself or anyone else around but the Nurses told me I had to take it - this being on the Sunday night when there was no Doctor to discuss it with.  I was then given it orally for the next 8 days and advised the nurses of the side effects I was feeling on at least 3 occassions - still without having my blood pressure taken or seeing a Doctor during this whole time. I then had a weekend out of the unit and decided I would no longer take it. Upon returning to the unit I advised that I had stopped and no further action was taken.  I am appalled that this drug was give to me when no actual diagnosis had been made of my condition (first ever episode at age 44) and upon being discharged from Mental Health they still could not give me a diagnosis.  It did not decrease any of my symptoms however over the next 3 weeks they disappeared on there own.

My partner twice mentioned my weight gain and finally called me unattractive and questioned why I would be so commited to a drug that makes me fat and is leading me to diabetes. My doctor diagnosed me as being pre-diabetic (I am 32 years old). I was a person who was always a healthy weight and_ with Depakote and later Zyprexa_ I gained 70 lbs in a year. Most recently_ I finally insisted to my doctor that I go on Lithium and come off the Zyprexa.

The two precribed together is reported to be one of the most effective medication treatments for Bipolar Disorder. There's no question that it's been a very effective drug for me.  That said_ the few side effects I have are chronic.  I now take Cogentin to help with the hand tremors_ but even with that I still have some tremors.

Zyprexa helped calm the side effects of withdrawal_ which were pretty severe. I began experiencing relief within 36 hours. Since that incident_ I've decided to try a natural approach to treating depression because I'm fed up with the horrible side effects that medication can cause. I've been able to wean off all other medications with the help of a Naturopathic Physician_ but getting off of Zyprexa is proving to be a battle. I experience severe withdrawal symptoms if my dose is lowered too quickly or too much_ so I have to abide by a 10% discontinuation schedule (10% reduction of dose every 2 weeks). I gained 30 lbs on this medication_ it is messing around with my hormones_ I have pretty bad acne_ am groggy all the time_ have zero libido_ no motivation to do things_ and now I'm experiencing a lot of body aches and pains.

I gained 60 pounds_ I went from a size 4 to a size 16. Before going on Zyprexa I took dance classes 6-8 days a week_ and was in a dance troupe. After taking Zyprexa I was so drained of energy_ I could barely get out of bed. So_ I stopped pursuing my life long passion of dancing. I went from being one of the top employees in my division to a zombie_ who couldn't string a sentence together. The drug made me so tired it affected my attendance at work. It didn't take long before I was fired. On top of that_ many people in my company were gossiping about how fat and weird I had become. I also crashed my car three times while on this drug. I had to move in with my Mother_ because my life was such a mess. Thank god for my Mother - because she finally saw what had happened to me. I stopped the Zyprexa. The withdrawals were horrible. For a good six months_ I had severe mania_ anxiety and insomnia. I threw up constantly. Those were just the physical withdrawal symptoms. It took a full two years before my cognitive abilities returned: my mental sharpness_ sense of judgment_ logic and reasoning. I also developed a mild form of tardive dyskinesia_ which I still have. This all happened eight years ago_ yes I lost the weight and I reclaimed my life.

I have gone from 110 pounds [weighed this all my life] to 185 pounds today.  Granted_ I went into menopause during my second year on this drug_ but that can't be the only reason for this increase in weight. I have had no mood problems since I started on Zyprexa_ but I am tired of gaining 5 to 10 pounds every year.

It also makes you want to sleep for hours and hours_ I actually have some of this medication saved for when my insomnia kicks in and I need to get extra sleep.

I know I'm not as unlucky about that as others on that issue_ but going from being a stick to a little more than average SUCKS.Anyway_ the reason I ""would've"" said I hated it is because I went off of it a week ago and have gone NUTS.  My doctor put me on Geodon (if you would like to know details of THAT little adventure_ check out the post I added on Geodon's rating today_ too... Geodon=Crap) and I went crazy_ literally.  I had been healthy for the first time since I was 5 years old on Zyprexa.  (I had been on antidepressants since I was 17 and they weren't working due to the fact that my psych misdiagnosed me as depressed when I was bipolar).  Anyway_ when a new doc finally figured out what was wrong with me (6 years of HELL later)_ he put me on Lamictal and Zyprexa.  I have had minor issues of mania and depression (+ the dreaded weight gain)_ but nothing like the crap I've had to deal with since coming off of it a week ago_ which I did just to lose weight. (Mania_ depression_ plus all the Geodon side effects_ as well). Anyway_ I hope it hasn't gotten too far out of my system this week and I can get back to normal (whatever ""normal"" is for a bipolar person).

It has already raised my blood sugar levels to borderline diabetic while only taking 1/4 of a 2.5mg tablet_ as needed - which has been anywhere from twice a week to twice a month.  Previously I had low blood sugar.  It does help my ""spiraling out of control"" feeling and aggitation/anxiety/anger/mania type phases.

On the other hand_ please read about the side effects_ which can be serious. I've read that average weight gain while taking Zyprexa is 40 pounds in the first year. It appears to contribute to the onset of diabetes in some people (as would the added weight). I am concerned I might be in the early stages of TD_ so I will talk to my doctor and begin slowly cutting back on my dosage to see if the movements and restless legs disappear or at least improve. For short-term use_ it's a miracle.,M,58,5  years,8/5/2008,Zyprexa

Within a week my mood swings lessened and I felt human again. Zyprexa saved my life.  At times I'd feel real flat & my vivacious personality had lessend considerably.  My psychiatrist added Wellbutrin to Zyprexa and Lithium.  After 9 years_ I'm now off of the Zyprexa because my glucose nos. went into diabetes mode.  I had no idea that was a side effect.  I'm back to feeling like me again (w/out the extreme swings). I do miss the ability to sleep late on the weekends!,F,59,9  years,12/20/2007,Zyprexa

I generally feel better_ I just hope it lasts as its very early days_ and most things tend to poop out on me (and thats not depressive thinking_ its based on experience!).

Had to stop taking it also increased blood pressure and cholestrol. Trouble buying Clothes that fit. Self-image low so was self-esteem. I feel this medication is dangerous to your health_ even if it works to control your illnees.

295, 5, Bipolar II_ Panic Disorder,Weight Gain. 20 lbs in 8 weeks -- no doubt it would have reached 100+++ lbs if had continued. You eat because you have to eat (will power has nothing to do with it) plus your metabolism changes radically. This drug causes blind_ crazy hunger -- mostly for sweets. As a result developed Metabolic Syndrome (Sugar levels increased and needed to take Metformin to control_ which it didn't. The minor side effects: tired in am_ constipation_ RLS and a tad spacey/loopy when ever I got tired.,The best drug (combined with Zoloft) for mood swings_ stability_ anxiety_ depression_ mania and general happiness that I've ever taken. I felt great on this drug_ 100% normal. Unfortunately the side effects of weight gain and metabolic syndrome got out of hand and I had to stop. I feel like Algernon -- I've had a taste of what normal people feel like and now I have to go back into my illness.

Concerned about the possibility of diabetes linked with Zyprexa.  I've read the anti-psychotic is only meant for short term use with my diagnosis_ yet my pyschitrist insists I should be on it at least two years for fears of relapse. I did have two relapses in the past year but I think it was due to stressors_ not withdrawal of Zyprexa. I went off it on my own twice and feel like getting off it again. The weight gain is crazy and to lessen the side effects I have halved the prescribed dose of 10mg - I am being tapered off slowly (too slowly in my opinion) to 7.5mg and then 5 mg over the course of treatment. I will see if I stay on it or not. I am concerned about relapses but also concerned what continued use of the drug may do too.,F,37,65  days,11/8/2007Email,Zyprexa

This drug worked like a miracle for me.  I thought I had lost my entire life before I started taking it.

I don't feel weird_ or become the screaming aggro man_ or look like the 'plank' man_ or have too bad dyskinesia (that's when I shake like elvis out of control)_ or sleep 'till the cows come home.

I've been on the drug for 6 weeks - the first 5 and a half of which I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.  Now I'm starting to get up during the night_ having slight insomnia and am getting up fine in the morning.  I'm not sure if its masking another agitated/manic episode or if the side effects are wearing off.  I've lost a lot of co-ordination and I feel dizzy quite often_ but Zyprexa works.

It helped me to clarify my thoughts_ and to feel more stable.  But to me the side effects and potential long-term health risks aren't worth it.  I wouldn't recommend anyone take this drug unless your life (literally) depends on it.  Try another of the atypical antipsychotics.

I definitely would not want to take it long-term because the sedation kind of sucked.  But I'd rather feel tired and slow than feel manic and paranoid.

I experienced sudden weight gain and as of yesterday stopped taking it altogether.",Yes it helps you sleep. Yes it helps with MILD anxiety. Yes it helps you gain weight rapidly. I refuse to stay on a medication that makes me gain weight. I'd rather have insomnia.

336, 1, schizophrenia,side effects-weight gain of 30lbs_ decreased sex drive_need to sleep about 10 hrs a daywithdrawal symptoms-I slowly tapered my dose from 2.5 to 1.8 to 1.25 to 0.625 taking three months at each dose. I had severe PMS at each lowering of the dosage_ which eventually went away. I should have just stayed on the 0.625 dose. After two weeks of no zyprexa I had severe anxiety_ panic attacks_ breathing problems while falling asleep_ insomnia. Eventhough I had no schizophrenia symptoms I had to go back on zyprexa since the withdrawal symptoms were so severe. I never had any of the withdrawal symptoms before taking Zyprexa. In order to get rid of the withdrawal symptoms I had to up my dose to 10mg.,Get on the lowest possible dose_ but don't try to quit completely,F,36,3  years,8/1/2007,Zyprexa

I was taken to Shands Neurology and was told that if the tremors didn't subside after discontinuing the medications that it was possible that I had early onset parkinson's disease. To be fair I was later diagnosed with Essential Tremor Disorder_ but never before or after this medication have my tremors been that severe. It was great for symptoms_ but the side effects far outweighed the benefits of taking the medication.,M,29,1  months,7/23/2007Email,Zyprexa

341, 4, Bipolar,I just started taking zyprexa_ 5mg_ and I was set on controlling the weight gain through exercise and watching my diet.  Although I was working out more than ever I still put on a little over 5 lbs in the first 2 weeks.  That's certainly not a mood 'stabilizer.'  I just met with another doctor who prescribed metformin to control the weight gain.  Long story short_ it helps with insulin levels.

357, 2, bipolar spectrum,ALways craving sweets. Weight gain. The first month I felt great_ it made me hypomanic. Embarked on all kinds of crazy projects and spent $1000 on clothes I didn't need. After long depression this felt good. The second month Had very severe hypoglycemic symptoms and started fighting with people in the street. Withdrew cold turkey_ caused major panic attacks_ had to go back on to withdraw slowly. Completed one month ago but I am still not okay. The hypoglycemis is still so severe I almost had to be hospitalized the other day_ blacking out in the street. I am sure it is the Zyprexa because it uses the glucose channels to transport itself and it obviously does something very nasty to them which continues after you withdraw.,There were also neurological effects on Zyprexa. I would be talking and forget the word_ I would confuse words_ slips of the tongue_ involuntary hand movements_ dropping things. But Zyprexa had very strong anti-anxiety properties which started fifteen minutes after I took it_ and for two months_ whatever else I experienced I had no anxiety. And the antidepressant effects were also excellent_they kicked in after a couple of days and I felt great until I got hypoglycemic_ but in retrospect the hypomanic aspect of the first month really wasn't worth it. Actually Zyprexa is a poison and no one with blood sugar problems or a history of such in the family should ever ever consider taking it.,F,47,2  months,5/27/2007Email,Zyprexa

403, 3, depression_ borderline PD,To be on a medication so long it was hard to tell what was me and what was the medication when I went off it I realized the sleepiness and laziness were side effects.  Also I had weight gain_ high cholesterol_ high triglycerides_ and high glucose.  Heat intolerance which made me sick when I ran 5K races on warm days. Withdrawal: increased anxiety_ muscle tension_ heightened sensitivity to stimuli_ aggitation.  These mimiced the symptoms I went on the medication for.  But the withdrawal was complete in two weeks. Now I am very glad I am off of it.,Zyprexa is a mixed blessing.  When my life was unstable and my depression was more severe it was a life saver.  It gave me boundaries.  When others were upset I didnot have to be upset with them. So I was much less sensitive to perceived rejection.  I am fortunate I now have a stable job and my kids have grown up well.  So I don't need it to function.  When I went off it I did so because of the metabolic side effects.  I was surprised to experience the anxiety and tension.  And equally surprised when they went away after two weeks.  I have discoverd I am not lazy or sleepy or hungry all the time.  That was the zyprexa not me.

My aunt recently died of diabetes complications_ so I would strongly encourage anyone who is on this drug to request a prescription change ASAP! I really mean that. There is no sense in taking a drug that improves your mental health if it damages your physical health. How can you enjoy the new state of mind if you suffer from the inevitable physical complications caused by this med?,Thankfully_ I did not have to take Zyprexa for more than a few months. This was the first - and only - 'episode' I am going to have in my lifetime. Seriously. Self-help is a far better solution than letting doctors 'zombify' you with diabetes-causing drugs. I understand that some people with serious problems need drugs to stabilize their condition_ but any drug that causes deadly medical conditions needs to be eliminated from the rx book altogether. It just goes to show_ half the time_ these docs don't even realize what they're prescribing. Far better to treat yourself to TLC_ herbal remedies_ yoga_ meditation_ knitting lessons_ kick boxing_ whatever - minus the meds - if at all possible. We are the best resources when it comes to healing ourselves_ because ultimately_ we know better than anyone else what we need.

If you want to go off it_ taper slow (cut pills into halves).,F,31,8  months,7/13/2005,Zyprexa

487, 4, Bipolar,40 lb weight gain; cholesterol went up_ so had to take a statin; blood sugars went up to the point I had to take pills for my diabetes_ which had previously been diet-controlled.  Off Zyprexa_ weight decreased_ cholesterol went back down_ and I'm down 1/2 on the dosage of meds for diabetes.,This was the best drug I'd used for a mood stabilizer since diagnoses 4 ys ago. Since I had to quit it_ I've been trying nearly 2 yrs to find a substitute_ to no avail. The P-doc had thought he could counter the weight loss by coupling it with an appetite-suppressing type of antidepressant. Wrong. Newest P-doc presently thought Geodon would be similar; but Geodon had other problems_ just as limiting. Very frustrating. I'm still hoping to find something I like as well as Zyprexa.,F,39,18  months,4/30/2005Email,Zyprexa
488, 5, bipolar,10 lb. weight gain_ sleep good but tired upon waking for 30 min. or so,I had been taking wellbutrin and depakote for the last several years and they had quit helping. The zyprexa has been excellant for bipolar. Has stopped most needless worrying. I am much calmer. Some might say it takes away personality but without it I tend to be manic. My employer seems to like the calmer me. So far its great. I needed the 10 lbs. as I lost 45 due to cancer treatment and I need another 10 and I will be happy with that.,M,46,50  days,4/24/2005,Zyprexa
489, 4, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder,excessive sleeping; gained 30 pounds but then stabilized,really does well at keeping unwanted and persistent thoughts out of my head; makes me more relaxed and content; moods/energy level are more stable now instead of always up and down,M,29,5  years,4/18/2005,Zyprexa
490, 1, anxiety,akathesia--the feeling that you want to pace constantly. It is torture,Zyprexa is an EVIL drug. Don't take it! You get withdrawal symptoms when you try to come off it. IT can also cause serious_ permanent_ deadly side effects.,F,37,3  months,4/10/2005,Zyprexa

499, 1, Bipolar Type 1 (suicide attempts),I always felt,This is a very dangerous drug.  Can cause diabetes_ raise cholesterol levels_ and cause other serious metabolic problems.  Doctors who prescribed this for me in the hospital never warned me about any of the serious adverse reactions.  There are many other meds that are safer to use.  Fortunately my current psychiatrist realized that it was probably raising my cholesterol levels.,M,40,8  months,11/25/2004,Zyprexa
500, 1, Bipolar Type 1 - suicide attempts,It completely messed up my cholesterol profile.  Everything was dangerously out of normal ranges.  Had 30lb weight gain.  After stopping it for 4 months_ values returned to normal.,This drug is not safe.  Can cause metabolic syndrome (diabetes_ elevated cholesterol_ etc.).  There are many other safer alternatives.,M,40,8  months,11/25/2004,Zyprexa
501, 3, severe stutter,Weight gain_ general depression_ increased sleep time_ hard getting up in the morning_ and a general lack of interest in anything,Zyprexa really seems to reduce my stutter - that is great.  To finally be able to hold a normal conversation without a severe stutter was undescribably envigorating after a lifetime of either avoiding speaking situations or going through the torture of trying to convey what is so clear in my mind but nearly impossible to get out of my mouth.  I am now looking for the right dosage that will maximize the beneficial effect while minimizing the side effects.  I find that adding other medications (i.e. the anti-depressant Celexa or the ADHD medication Ritalin) to my daily medication 'cocktail' helps reduce some of the side effects.,M,38,2.5  years,11/11/2004Email,Zyprexa
502, 3, anxiety,Sedation_ Sleepyness in the morning_ mild inhibited feeling_ extream weight gain.,I had to be taken off it because it was making me gain too much weight I went from 185 to 301 pounds in one year. Luckly now I only weigh 195 so I'm back to looking good and being in shape again. Zyprexa kind of helped_ but the side effects wern't worth the antianxiety relief it hardly gave me. anotherwords it didn't work for me. I'm now being prescribed 20mg.s of diazepam (valium) to take three times a day and its working great for me I can now walk down the street without the unreal fears of what I thought people were thinking about me. Plus because of the help of valium and my own self determination I now have a job. So Zyprexa was close_ but no cigar. Zyprexa didn't work.,M,23,19  months,11/5/2004Email,Zyprexa

505, 5, bipolar,For the first time in my life I am able to function at work and at home. My personal relationships have improved greatly as I have much more patience and dont see myself getting angry over little things. I haveseen an increase in appetite but I have not gained weight. Ifeel more energy duringthe day and sleep better at night.,It has changed my life for the better.,M,35,6  weeks,10/16/2004,Zyprexa
506, 1, Bipolar (psycho hyper mania),Needed to sleep at least 15 hours a day (made me late to work every day for about a year).  Made foods taste unbelievably better-I could easily eat artificial junk food like Krispy Kreme doughnuts that actaully taste horrible (I'm not a big junk food eater I prefer natural foods).  Gained 35lbs in 2 years (I'm pretty good looking around 185-190lbs compared to other guys so that was terrible).  Twitches_ muscle spasms_ shaky hands--mine are usually very steady.  Didn't care about anything at all.  Lowered my IQ by at least 40%_ but that was a plus because it made it easier to fit in with normal people.  Basically I became a normal person: Fat_ ugly_ dumb_ senseless and boring.,This is good for people that are a danger to themselves or to society_ but not for those that can function in everyday life.  Being hungry all the time is a form a torture-especially when everything tastes so good and you just ate a huge meal that would make you throw up if you weren't taking this medication.,M,29,2  years,10/9/2004,Zyprexa

508, 2, depression_ insomnia,dry mouth_ increased appetite_ extreme weight-gain,I took Zyprexa for a week_ and it was so wonderful to get a regular sleeping pattern for that short time. However_ even though I was warned about the increased appetite I might experience_ I was very careful to stick to my weight-loss programme - only to find that I had gained TEN pounds in the 7 days I was taking the drug. I came off it immediately and worked hard to lose the weight - I got rid of it in about 3-4 weeks because I think some of it was fluid retention. Stopped taking it because it wasn't worth the weight-gain_ but in hindsight I also felt that I was getting a kind of false-sleep - it was more like a coma than refreshing REM sleep. If at all possible_ I prefer to sleep naturally now (having had a psychotic episode from other sleeping pills) even though it's much less reliable.,F,25,7  days,9/18/2004,Zyprexa
509, 1, ptsd,raised blood sugar_ compounded eating disorder problems as it made me ravenously hungry and i would binge eat_ somewhat,it worked great in terms of helping me sleep and stabilize when i was having panic attacks or flashbacks.  unfortunately_ the side effects were so severe that i had to switch to another medication (abilify) which doesn't help as much but hasn't had any side effects thus far.,F,46,8  months,9/10/2004,Zyprexa
510, 3, Bipolar II,None except weight gain.  I am hungry all the time.,This drug has helped me a great deal.  I am calmer_ less impulsive and much more rational.  Unfortunately_ weight gain has been substantial.,M,47,2  years,8/29/2004Email,Zyprexa
511, 1, bi-polar 1,Knocked me unconscious for 72 hours,STUPID CRAP FOR CRAP! Do not take this shit! I took it_ and the next thing I know_ I pass out and come to two days later...I'd been staggerin' around in a completely nonresponsive zombielike state on a cross state trip for the time and it was really bad. Oooooh if I ever see the guy who prescribed this stuff to me again he's toast.,F,19,1  days,4/22/2004,Zyprexa
512, 2, Bipolar_ Depression,Too many,Weight gain and even more weight gain. I've never had a big appetite but after a year of taking Zxprexa I went from being 8st to 10st 11lbs. This added to my depression. I always took it before bed_ I found that if I took it too early I couldn't sleep due to my legs constantly twitching. I was unknowingly waking up half asleep to feast in the night_ this was a major side effect for me and totally out of character. Daytime I was a zombie and couldn't concentrate. Two years on..I've stopped taking it_ back down to 9st now and feelings better but maybe thats only because I understand Bipolar more. If you want to find out info never trust your doctor_ he will just describe the first depressant off the top of his head. My advice would be do your own research_ there are some top sites out there_ then discuss with your doctor other possible medications. They only seem to tell you about drugs they prescribe you only if you ask and I'm sure if you do enough research yourself into a particular med that you think you will benefit from_ read the possible side effects etc.. than there is nothing they can tell you that you dont already knowtrust me that will make you feel good after so many years of not knowing. I found that a lot of drugs I benefit from now were never suggested to me...could of saved me a lot of time and pain.  If any of you out there suffer from Bipolar don't let it cut you down like a knife_ you're stronger than that_ you just have to remind yourself a lot more than most people!,F,25,12  months,4/6/2004,Zyprexa
