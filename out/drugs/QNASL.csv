0, 4, Treat Nasal Polyps,It burns_ but not as bad after the first few days.,It works A LOT better than any of the liquid sprays. I have used Rhinocort_ Nasocort_ and Flonase and this is superior to all of them. I don't know if it is shrinking the polyps_ but it prevents me from constantly having to blow my nose_ which is a major improvement.,F,36,2  weeks160mcg/day,6/25/2016,Qnasl
1, 1, To prevent polyps from coming back,Side Effects:  My nostrils HURT_ nostrils were dry_ throat burned all day.  The effects were so bad_ that I waited until bedtime to spray this so I could just go to sleep!,I had nasal polyps removed and was given this to use to prevent re-growth. I did 2 sprays_ each nostril_ once a day. If you don't mind using liquid nasal sprays (with steroids) such as Nasonex_ Rhinocort_ etc. then stick with those.  My doctor let me try Qnasl before I had the prescription filled.  The 9 days I was using it_ I dreaded having to spray it.  I know it's a dry nasal spray_ but it HURT!  My throat burned all day (literally) and my nasal passages were so dry and uncomfortable.  Did not like this spray at all.  I have used Nasonex and Rhinocort and will be going back to those.  Liquids felt much better in my nose!,F,37,9  days 1X D,11/19/2012Email,Qnasl
