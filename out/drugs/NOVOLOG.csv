1, 4, Type 2_  Adult-onset  Diabetes,No side-effects...  if I take it.     If I neglect to take it_   my overall health and well-being will suffer:   I'll get pale-looking_   grouchy and overly thirsty.,"When i was first experiencing PRE-diabetes_  I noticed_  before my Type 2 diagnosis_  that my food wasn't giving me energy anymore... even healthy_  wholesome foods.   My meals would just sink to the pit of my stomach_   with no noticeable energy resulting.   I literally was eating_  but felt under-nourished_  if you can believe that.   I now know that insulin is the drug that ""unlocks"" the energy potential of your food;   and indeed_   if I inject it before meals_   I get a gratifying_  healthy burst of food energy hours after I've finished eating.   Family tell me I have healthy color in my face_  and look rested  when I'm actively using NOVOLOG.    A useful drug--   if you don't mind needles_  and poking yourself in the belly or the bum several times daily!",M,50,5  years12 units 3X D,1/6/2014Email,Novolog

3, 5, Type I IDDM,I use the Novolog pen.  I was on Humalog since 1997 (when it came out?) and found the Novolog does not peak as severely as Humalog does and it works faster- about 10 minutes where Humalog was about 30.  The only problem I experience is with the pen itself- but after receiving and READING (sometimes I don't read all instructions:-) a TIPS USING YOUR INSULIN PEN- I found the resolve.  After injection and syringe removal from my skin there would be drips of insulin- so possibly missed about 3 to 5 units of the dose and needed to reapply/inject again!  Resolve is to keep needly in the skin/body for 10 seconds after injecting insulin and that seems to work!  And Humalog seemed to make me very flatulent and Novalog does not.,If anyone knows how I can just purchase or order the lancet PEN by itself instead of getting a whole new glucometer please contact me- thanks- I lost my lancet pen springy thing.,F,27,3  years15 units 6X D,8/25/2010Email,Novolog

5, 2, T2 diabetes,This med worked well for a long time. I took both Novolog R (at meals) and Novolog N (over night). My bs was around 7 which was good enough for my doctor. Then_ a couple of years ago_ I started having a reaction to the Novolog N. I itched on my stomach (and inside thighs) whenever I took more than 20 units. I learned_ on the internet_ that this happens and just the same as it did to me.Eventually_ I had to stop taking the Novolog N because even 20 units caused a rash. I switched to Novolog R and that was fine but just the last few days I have started reacting to it_ too. Right now I am having itching and burning all over my trunk area but I don't see a rash.,"I think my reaction is relatively rare but that's what I thought when metformin cause me two years of misery and the doc said ""it's not the metformin"". Well_ it was. According to this site_ it's relatively common. Thank goodness for askapatient.com where the truth is told about meds.",F,64,10  years20 units 6X D,2/8/2010,Novolog
6, 5, Blood sugar control,Timing is a bit difficult when going out to eat because it works too well.  I hate leaving the table when the food arrives to take the dosage but if I do it before we order I have too low of a dip,,M,40,8  months,11/5/2009,Novolog
7, 4, Type II diabetic,"Try to take dose after eating as Novolog works fast and can lower bsl too fast! My endicrinologist has adjusted my base dose several times. Taking dose based on ""menu"" and number of carbs at lunch and dinner.",Love the convenience of the pens!,F,56,11  months,6/9/2009,Novolog
8, 5, Type 1 Diabetes,None,I usually wait about 15 minutes after taking Novolog before eatting to avoid the high peaks of blood sugar after meals.  This med. has been amazing.,F,26,5  years,2/29/2008,Novolog
9, 5, Type I Diabetes,None,I like this much better than Humalog. When I started my insulin pump I was on Humalog. During the end of the 2nd day and well into the 3rd day on my pump site I would notice a gradual increase in my blood sugar. When I discussed this with my Dr he gave me Novolog to try and I haven't looked back. This is so much better than Humalog!,F,33,3  years,11/19/2007,Novolog
