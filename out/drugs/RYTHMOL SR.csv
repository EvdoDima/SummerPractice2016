4, 4, atrial fib,,i started taking rythmol after trying sotolol_ which was effective in controlling my fibs but led to easy fatigue. after two months wanted out because rythmol was only partially effective_ but my doctor recommended adding 25 mg of metoprolol tartrate daily. the combination has worked beautifully for 10 weeks now-- no fibs and no fatigue. i'm delighted. also_ met tart is cheap.,M,72,4  months325 mg 2X D,5/12/2010,Rythmol sr
