0, 3, yeast infection,Within 10 minutes of taking Diflucan_ I experienced extreme tingling and burning on my lips and nose. I then took a Benadryl tablet and placed an ice pack over my face. An hour later_ I have severe swelling of my lips_ nose and cheeks. I also have a black bruise on the tip of my nose.,I have taken Diflucan in the past and it has worked great. I have never had an allergic reaction til now. My doctor said she has never heard of anyone having symptoms like mine after taking it_ but I see after reading these comments_ there are a lot of others experiencing the same thing. I don't know if they changed or added something to the pill_ but I hate it. It cleared yeast infection in a day though_ so that is one positive.,F,28,1  days100 MG 1X O,8/17/2016,Diflucan

3, 5, Systemic candida,"Most of the reviews I have read for this drug seem to be ""yeast die off"" reactions and not allergic reactions. This is speaking from experience of fighting systemic yeast for 5 years and trying 12 different anti fungal treatments. A simple google search ""herxheimer symptoms"" will explain that most of these negative diflucan reviews are from patients that have a serious underlying yeast problems_ that blame the drug for doing what it is designed to do: kill yeast in every area of your body. I am thankful for flucanazole_ no other treatment penetrates deeply into most all tissues of your body to stop the yeast. The last straw for me_ to seek RX treatment was fungal arthritis. It has worked perfectly. Sad that doctors don't know much about "" herxing."" It sounds like a lot of the patients would have benefitted from this drug if they did not run away at the first reaction. Dealing with yeast is a bit like a behavioral intervention_ things get ugly _ loud _ worse_ then they get better than ever.","One month into treatmentGood side effects:  as much energy as when I was 20 years old.  Don't need caffeine_ sleeping much less at night_ joint pain is gone_ no more carbohydrate cravings_ emotional stability that I haven't experienced in years.Negative side effects: localized and temporary itching at various infection sites (legs_ face_ eyes_ arms).  A few sharp but brief headaches ( Google ""Alzheimer's candida"").  A few sharp but brief pains internally. Side Note: also taking 600 mg daily of OTC Allicin (garlic derived)_ as studies have indicated synergism when fighting yeast.",M,33,2  months300 mg,7/22/2016,Diflucan

I would get red bumps around my lips_ nose_ ears that would itch.

40, 1, Fungi infection on scalp,I am having random heart palpitations that started on the third day. It is an overwhelming feeling that feels like my heart sits at my throat as if it were effecting my Thyroid. Never felt anything like this_ it's a bit scary when it doesn't seem to go away for up to hours at a time or just randomly coming and going throughout the day. It will make my heart rate randomly spike up at the smallest effort_ I run a farm and am an athlete I've never experienced such strange behavior from my heart rate. It makes me a bit panicky and certainly create a lot of worry when I get this feeling that I can't really explain other than my heart sitting in my throat. I've stopped taking the pill three days ago when I realized that what I was feeling must have been a side effect_ now from seeing others comments I am certain it is a side effect.

47, 1, infection,My left pinky finger would begin itching at the knuckle very intensely and then the swelling would always begin a few seconds after. Only that one finger... Once a year... Could not figure out what was causing it until this time. I hasn't taken this pill in a couple years and also had not had a breakout on my finger. I took one the other day and a few hours later it began again. So this time I put two and two together and researched online. Never will I ever take it again. Every time this happens it itches so badly I want to scratch my skin off!!! My knuckle turns purple and my whole finger swells up so much it hurts. Then come the blisters... And the peeling off the skin. Two days later and it is still itching me to death!!!!!!,Avoid it..... Not worth it. Thank god I figured out what was causing this.,F,25,5  years1,5/14/2015,Diflucan

50, 1, Yeast Infection,Aside from the yeast infection_ I felt fine when I started taking the one 150mg pill of Fluconazole (the generic Diflucan)_ but later that day I started feeling as if I was coming down with the flu and developed an itchy scalp. I figured I was having an allergic reaction and took Benadryl and went to bed. The next day it had spread to my buttocks_ the nape of my neck and was even more severe on the back of my scalp now going from ear to ear. I wasn't able to see my doctor until the following week and he prescribed a prednisone pack_ which after a week of treatment finally stopped the scalp and neck itching. Now the cheeks of my buttocks are still covered in a much larger area and are still burning and super itchy and the rash is bright red and this is 4 weeks later.

53, 4, vaginal yeast infection,nausea_ stomach pain_ vaginal discharge,I had some really really mild nausea and stomach pain_ but nothing unbearable. I also had some discharge_ which I'm guessing is from the die off of the yeast when the antifungal gets to it. I took one 250 mg pill and then three days later_ one more 250 mg pill. It was effective in getting rid of my yeast infection and it has not come back so far. I'd take it again_ there were barely any side effects_ and the ones I had were very mild.,F,20, 250 mg 1X AN,4/14/2015,Diflucan
54, 3, Vaginal yeast infection,I had taken this in the past and had no problems_ it worked great for yeast infections. Took it a year ago before I left for a trip to Mexico. After being out in the sun I would feel like my skin was on fire and like I was going to faint and more but thought I had just caught a bug during the traveling. Tried it again for a pesky vaginal yeast infection. 1 200mg every 48 hours then 1 every week for 6 months. I took one M_W_ forgot Friday so I took it Saturday and then Sunday. Felt awful. Nausea like with morning sickness_ low sun/heat tolerance_ stomach pains_ very loose stools at times_ dizzy_ and rapid heart rate. Went into see my family dr. My heart rate and blood pressure was super high for me along w all the symptoms I had felt on my trip. The only similarity is that I was taking Diflucan then and I'm taking it now. Stopping it and trying Monistat 7 days. I didn't feel any of these symptoms before getting on Diflucan again. It has been so nice to find this website and know that I'm not the only one out there. My obgyn had never heard of anyone having any side effects to it. My family dr was much more reassuring in saying that it definitely could be the med. I'm a healthy female who's in great shape and works out regularly. Hope this review helps someone else!,,F,35,4  days200mg,4/2/2015,Diflucan

Within 10 minutes of taking Diflucan_ I had a panic attack_ so I took an additional .25 MG of Xanax to calm down and that made everything worse. After a long night_ I found out that there is a severe interaction between Xanax and Diflucan. Since then_ I've reduced the amount of Xanax I take_ and every time I take it_ I get delirious and dizzy. I don't know why my doctor of pharmacist would allow me to take this. It's been 48 hours since I took the Diflucan.

I weigh 112 lbs and have a heart murmur which became worse when taking Diflucan.  It also gave me a hypoglycemia type of anxiety.  Also_ memory problems.  I was searching around for my drinking mug_ minutes later I realized I was holding it in my hand.  I'm hoping it will kill the yeast once and for all.

65, 2, yeast infection,Stomach pain/cramps_ diarrhea_ bloating_ slight nausea,I took one dose of diflucan for a yeast infection over a month ago and experienced a lot of stomach bloating and cramps_ as well as a bit of diarrhea. I waited five days without experiencing any relief from symptoms before finally calling my doctor_ who advised I try Monistat-7 -- that gave me relief within a few days and completely cleared the infection by the end of the treatment.I just finished a week and a half round of antibiotics and was prescribed three rounds of diflucan to go with them to try to avoid a yeast infection from the antibiotics. Took one pill at the start and one pill for two days in a row at the end; each time I took it I wound up with bloating_ stomach pain or cramps and diarrhea. After the two day dose I also felt slightly nauseous and a day after taking the last dose I still have the diarrhea and stomach cramps. I was at the doctor yesterday and they did check for a yeast infection_ which I did not have_ so it apparently did it's job this time_ but with the side effects_ I'd almost rather have the yeast infection and go the Monistat-7 route.,F,24,3  days150,1/26/2015,Diflucan

They put me on meloxicam & I got thrush.I called my rheumatologist who said that it probably was not thrush. I went to urgent care_ and they prescribed 2-3 diflucan twice_ it didn't work. I then went to the infectious disease specialist who seemed to think I had HIV_ so he tested me. It was negative.He prescribed diflucan for 2 weeks. Afterwards_ I told him_ ""The thrush is still there_ I can feel it"" He said_ ""No_ its not_ you are all better now.""  I told my neurologist I wanted 6-12 weeks of diflucan. He would not prescribe it. I had had thrush for 2 years now. I was taking herbs_ Caprylate complex_ grapefruit seed extract_ even douching with white oak bark tea. I stopped all sugars and breads and rice etc. Still I had thrush. Finally went to my family doc. I showed her the print out from Joseph Teitelbaum's website about treating yeast infections. She agreed to put me on the fluconazole. Within 3 days my migraines were gone! I have not had a migraine since I started fluconazole. My joint and back pain has improved greatly! No side effects the first 2 weeks. For some reason now I am having the chills_ etc_ I am worried I won't be able to complete the treatment.

88, 3, Candida,muscle weakness_ stomach aches_ gastronomical issues_ extreme hair loss!!!!!_,If it wasn't for the extreme hair loss I would never think of discontinuing my use of this drug. I take it so often because it has even helped with my depression. At this point i do feel like I am addicted to this drug thats how good it works for me. At times it can make me feel a little lethargic; but I just feel extremely laid back and calm with no anxiety. Although_ after using it for 6 months straight I am experiencing thinning hair and it is devastating . I am now so depressed because Diflucan has been beneficial to me in treating my ailments even colds and apathy; but the hair loss I cannot take.  I have even gone to the point now of putting monistat on my scalp hoping that will decrease the shedding because I figure that if I have a history of candida infection then maybe I need to treat the scalp and this will work to combat the hair loss. Now I believe that I am having negative side effects from that_ such as headaches and foggy thinking. It seems like I can't win for losing.but if you are planning on taking Diflucan for a short period of time I definitely recommend the drug. It is when you take it for long durations past 2 and 3 months that you will experience the hair loss. It can be such a miracle drug that it cleans your organs and can even help with weight loss; I find it to be an energy booster ; -- I just wish it didn't cause you to lose your hair!!!! ------,F,34,1  years75 2X W,4/6/2014Email,Diflucan

However I do get some utering cramping occasionally. I assume its because the ywast infection is pretty bad and the drug is working mightily to get rid of the yeast. I also had a small amount of fungus in my big right toe and it also cleared that up! So thought it was pretty cool it killed two birds with one stone! I sometimes have low back pain and on the first and second day_ some white discharge. But again. I believe its the pill doing its job. I have auto immune disease so unfortunately I have to be on antibiotics quite a bit which causes the high amount of yeast infections I get. Sorry to hear so many bad stories.

109, 3, Yeast infection,Same side pain on right side_Hot flash like symptoms on my right side arm and leg. Orange urine after a week.,Hi_I am the same one that had the SEVERE SIDE PAIN. I wanted to give some people an update. I apparently have recurrent yeast infections..... I wanted to let people know that Diflucan will clear up your yeast infection. (not amazingly)... but you have to take probiotics and adjust your diet after or it will most likely come back. So after my CT scan_ about a week later my yeast infection symptoms came back (burning). I was hesitant_ but my doc put me on a lower does of dilucan 100mg. I took 1_ then 1 three days later_ and she wanted me to take one once a week after that for 6 months..... So after that I took one 6 days later and then another three days later since I was still having the burning and it didn't appear to be working and she said it was ok..... Before and now I experience weird right arm and leg warm sensations on the meds_ occasional orange urine and of corse the side pain came back...... not as bad though. I had all this before on the pill.... I dont understand since I was on a lower does and took it less often...... I told my doctor I dont want to take Diflucan anymore. Obviously I dont react well to it.  Iam going to try more natural ways to clear it up. If you have a yeast infection I recommend trying cream first before the pill.,F,22,2  weeks100mg 2X W,4/12/2013,Diflucan

I took 1 does of diflucan 150mg  at the End of january with no reaction to the product_ but it did not clear up my problem. A month later I got tested and still had yeast. My doctor recommend that I try one 150mg does every 3 days for 3 doses. I was like thats fine since I had no reactions and it would only be about a week and Iam desperate. After the first 3 days everything was fine_ then i took the second does. Heres where the problem started. Next day started to get right side pain_ nothing bad but it was noticeable. It continued to get worse but I thought I sprained a mussel until I took the 3rd does three days later...... THE PAIN GOT WORSE TO THE POINT 800MG OF IBUPROFEN DID NOT WORK. IT HURT SO BAD!!! I ended up in urgent care for 12 hours to get a CT  to make sure i didnt have a ovarian cyst or my appendix burst. All said it was not the pill. They sent me home since could not find anything but the pain was so bad i missed school. luckily after that hell I came home and it slowly got better after the drug was complexly out of my system which is why Iam convinced. I have never had this happen before until the pill. BEWARE IF YOUR 110 pounds. It and my liver did not work and I was not even on a long term use....

I had a bad reaction to that treatment at first--severe diarrhea and vomiting_ but it was probably the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction because I got past this after a couple of days.  I'm supposed to remain at this diflucan dose for 4 weeks and then get my liver function tested.  If all is well_ I'm supposed to stay on Diflucan for a total of 6 weeks.

121, 1, Yeast Infection,Severe hives_ angioedema (swollen eyes_ lips_ and forehead)_ swollen glands_ difficulty breathing.,The day after the 1st day of a 2 day dose_ I developed a small case of hives that I thought was a food allergy.  However_ within hours_ I intensely broke out into hives_ and my face began to swell. I did not take the Diflucan on the second (and the last day of the prescription) because I was taking Benedryl_ still unaware of the cause of my hives_ but not wanting to mix drugs.  I woke up to angioedema_ to the point where I could hardly see_ my eyes and lips were horribly inflamed and the hives rash was unlike the kinds I get from food allergies.  The hives were on my legs_ torso_ arms_ knees_ back_ and feet.  My hands and feet felt swollen (although they looked normal) and I could have sworn that there were hives on my palms and the bottoms of my feet (even though I couldn't clearly see anything). Since the hives were severe_ I refrained from hot baths_ applied ointment_ drank water_ and tried to ease the symptoms with Benedryl. The only time I felt good was when I was asleep_ but the symptoms would wake me up at times and I struggled to get rid of the burning sensation. After the 4th day_ the sweeling in my face subsided_ but the hives became aggressive_ now covering my forehead_ ears_ scalp_ neck_ shoulders_ torso_ underarms_ trunk_ buttocks_ legs_ knees_ and the tops of my feet.  The rash was also much larger and more painful than the hives I'm used to experiencing.  It was then that I realized it wasn't a food allergy (which typically lasts a few hours up to a day,F,37,1  days200mg 1X D,7/29/2012,Diflucan

I figured I was having an allergic reaction to something in my clothing/in the air/ etc so I took some Benadryl and went to bed. The next day the hives had spread to my legs_ tops of my feet_ arms_ chest and Benedryl didn't seem to be helping. By the next day it had spread up my neck to my face_ ears_ scalp_ and mouth and started to resemble a severe sunburn that itched and burned. My tongue developed blisters and felt like it was burning. My lips were chapped and peeling and chapstick offered no relief. Then the headaches and the tickle feeling/swelling in the back of my throat began. I now have a cough because of the tickle that isn't helped by drinking water or medicine etc. At one point I thought my airway might close up.

When the yeast die they produce toxins that cause many side effects that are blamed on the drug. I'm not saying the drug doesn't cause side effects because it does_ just be aware that killing the yeast fungi also causes side effects. It's also important to repopulate your digestive system with a good probiotic. There are many out there but personally I'm going to give Three Lac a try this time around.

I thought it was only because of the extended course of treatment.  I needed a course of prednisone to alleviate the allergic reaction.  This time around i only took one 150mg dose and within 2 hours I had the exact same facial reactions.  Two days later and the itching is driving me nuts_ even after taking anti-histamines!  This is the last time I'll ever use this drug,F,39,1  days150 1X D,7/12/2011Email,Diflucan
160, 1, yeast inf_ mold exposure,nausea_ violent stomach pain; SEVERE heart palpitations_ inability to sleep for 2-3 days at a time; Thyroid tumors,"Sunday school student got Whooping Cough_ I was forced to take antibiotic - which caused yeast infection. Took diflucan. Had some strong stomach pain & nausea but it cleared up my lungs!  I had lived in an apt with mold 18 mos prior & proceeded to have bronchitis 12 times in 24 mos_ to the point of coughing up blood. Diflucan completely cleared up my lungs.  Then I had to move_ and didn't realize NEW place also had mold until the rains started.  Took diflucan AGAIN. Moved again. Mold AGAIN. Doctor kept checking liver levels to make sure it was ""safe"" to take the diflucan_ no problems with liver.  HOWEVER_ I developed heart palpitations_ dizziness_ shortness of breath (not bronchitis)_ severe insomnia - sometimes going 2 - 3 days without being able to fall asleep.  Blood work revealed T-3 normal but TSH non-existant. Ultrasound showed 3 or 4 tumors on my thyroid. Radiology said unlikely to be cancer_ so I took N-Acetyl Cysteine to detox fluoride from my body. (DiFLUcan is fluoride based - osteopath says is poison to your thyroid) It has taken a good 6 months to get my heart reasonably normal and also be able to sleep.  Thyroid tumors have gone down. ER docs_ cardiologist_ & other traditional Western docs said No Way diflucan caused this - my osteopath_  alternative MD_ & chiropractor say HELL YES it caused it!

I realized i had a welt or hive on my butt cheek.  as the day has progressed there are 5 welts on each cheek now.  not so irritating or itching now but dr's office said to keep cool compresses on them for the itching and to stop the meds now.  i thought that a spider had gotten to me in my sleep so my sheets went in the washer.  but now i realize i'm having an allergic reaction.  I'm prety bummed about it.  i've used this medication twice in the last 10 years for toenail fungus with great results.  but not this time_ ugh!,,F,49,1  days200 mg 1X W,5/5/2011Email,Diflucan

I have taken difulcan over the years. The past 2 times_ anywhere I have swelling (arthritis/psoriatic) turns BRIGHT RED_ I itch all over and develop a red rash over face and body.,Benadryl seems to help_ and with this the second time_ I will not use it again. The yeast infection goes away fast on the pills_ but the uncomfortable feeling of the swelling and rash does not make it a good fit.

In the same places_ one big one on my chin turned purple and left a black mark/scar on my face!!! *tears* I am allergic to the over-the-counter creams & this pill has been the alternative_ but there has to be something out there that won't attack my face.,,F,32, 150mg 1X AN,4/3/2011Email,Diflucan

174, 2, Yeast Infection,I always took Diflucan when I had a yeast infection in the past and I never had a problem. Not until the summer of 2010 I took it once and I developed a cold sore on my bottom lip. I had another yeast infection and took diflucan and another one appeared_ and then another. I finally stopped taking the diflucan and realized even though it was treating my yeast it was causing ugly cold sores on my lips.

177, 1, facial yeast infection,I took this for a heat rash/fungal infection on my face.  I didn't want to take it because I have a sensitive stomach.  Well_ I ended up taking it out of desperation and while it didn't hurt my stomach_ it really messed up my vagina.,I think because I didn't have a vaginal yeast infection_ this messed up my flora below and it hasn't gone back to normal.  I think made me susceptible to BV and somehow dried out my vagina.  I can't self lubricated for sex anymore_ even if I'm excited and this has never been a problem for me in my life_ in fact I used to be overly wet.  I took the pill in Sept and its now Dec and I still have this problem.  Doctors don't believe me_ saying a pill can't cause this.  Well I say they have no idea because I know for a fact this pill destroyed my sex life and I haven't been the same since.

To those suffering with chronic YI's - after my 3rd time to the GYN - I have finally convinced them I needed longterm treatment with this drug. If you are for some reason NOT aware of all the natural remedies you need to be doing... google them.  You better be eating your daily yogurt_ taking probiotics_ wearing cotton underwear_ using plain non-scented soaps etc before you even try to convince them to treat you longterm.  Only after you've been doing these for a long time_ and with a postitive yeast culture_ will they consider this treatment.  Good luck everyone.,F,29,6  months150 1X W,11/30/2010Email,Diflucan
180, 1, Vaginal yeast infection,Wow. I had an empty box of GEN-Fluconazole with 1 refil_ so I called up my nearest Shoppers Drug Mart_ and they said that they no longer stock that generic form of Diflucan_ as it has been backordered and apparently not available_ but then she recommened that I take the Canesten 1-day oral pill_ which was apparently also Fluconazole_ but Canesten now has the rights to this drug_ I would assume.  It retails for $20.95 Canadian.I bought this thinking I would have the same experience I had on the GEN-Fluco.  Not at all!  On the second day_ I woke up with red-orange pee and reduced urine output.  My kidneys hurt_ my intestines were cramping_ my rectum hurt_ my liver hurt_ my vagina hurt_ my head hurt_ there were sores on the sides of my togue and on my tonsils/throat.  I was disoriented from the pain.  I went to the Emergency department at the nearest hospital - they took my blood and urine for tests - they came back clean - they also did an MRI and an ultrasound of my entire abdomen.,The reason I bought this was becuase I was on Ciprofloxacin for a week before and as per usual_ yeast comes with a broad spectrum antibiotic like this one.  I felt I had to get diflucan_ so I did_ and I regret it.  The best remedy for a localised yeast infection (vagina/rectum) is inserting 1-3 peeled and scored garlic cloves into the vagina/rectum and leaving for several hours_ or overnight.  Using a needle and thread_ you can thread a string through them so that they are easy to remove when done.  Repeat as necessary for several days.  This really works - allicin (ingredient in garlic) kills bacteria and fungi.  I've actually tried it before and will do this again in the future.,F,30,1  days500 1X D,11/29/2010Email,Diflucan

My previous experience with diflucan was also from antibiotic related yeast infections_ I do not get infections frequently.  The comments from people that had swelling mouths and sores_ the sites I have visited list these as  allergic reactions.  The side effects that I have are mild and the pill works to get rid of the infection.  I will be asking for a dose of diflucan whenever i get antibiotics.,F,35,1  days150 1X D,11/23/2010,Diflucan

I rate this only as a slight help_ and it is not the miracle drug_ it says it is. It just helps. Very disappointed.

184, 2, oral and nursing thrush,raw_ burning tongue and roof of mouth; burns when urinating; joint pain; peeling lips,"Took diflucan 400mg first day_ 100mgX2 for ""14"" days.  Noticed burning tongue and mouth first-- even had blisters on roof of mouth.  And my lips wouldn't stop peeling and burning.  Then I started having moderate to severe joint pain especially in hands and feet.  This weakened my immune system so I started to have an infection in my breast.  Plus it burned when I urinated and I had dry_ itchy eyes.  Saw my doctor and she took me off diflucan on day 8.  We checked for UTI_ which turned up negative and she took other tests.  However_ she said it didn't surprise her that diflucan was causing the above symptoms.  I'd take the yeast infection over diflucan any day.  However_ a few weeks ago_ diflucan did help keep my yeast down when I was put on an antibiotic (100mg per day X 10 days).  So it's an option for those who can tolerate it.  Otherwise_ try Graperfruit Seed Extract_ probiotics_ and garlic instead.",M,33,8  days100mg 2X D,11/6/2010,Diflucan

I am in so much pain_ I thought I had some kind of disease or cancer but I remembered when I took this a few months back my lip got swollen with a blister on top.

195, 1, yeast infection,"About a day and a half after taking this ""miracle"" 1-dose drug_ I started having intense heart burn and gas cramping in the stomach.  The acid burn was so bad that I couldn't stop producing mouthfuls of saliva.  Swallowing it_ in addition to the stomach pains_ I threw up several times.  It took me several hrs to be able to drive myself to the store to get some Pepcid AC_ Pepto_ and Maalox for relief.  These drugs usually work (individually) like a charm for these issues.  They barely had an effect on this hellish pain when used in combination.  I've missed one day of work so far and may miss more.  The cramping is lightening up a tiny bit but all I can consume is water in very small amounts and slowly.  My stools are starting to turn into diarrhea and I'm becoming dehydrated.  I'm so tired and have developed a migraine headache.  My doctor says it sounds like flu symptoms_ not a negative reaction to the drug.  The intense itching in the vag is still there and it's now been 3","I would not recommend this pill to anyone.

I think that if you miss work b/c you cannot function_ run to the bathroom constantly_ pass out_ throw up_ collapse due to gas and stomach cramping that makes you feel like your insides are doing origami_ then the symptoms are quite severe.

206, 3, systematic cnadida,difficulty breathing_ tightness in chest_ dizziness panic,I originally took Diflucan for vaginal candida without any side effects. Then I got systematic candida after battling amobae from India with antibiotics for a year. Used Diflucan a few times without side effects for a few years. But now have such severe side effects especially heart racing and tightness in chest that three times I went to the Emergency Room. It was pretty terrifying. Only after 3 times did I realize that it was from the Diflucan. Stopping sugar and going the healthy way has worked in the past too_ but takes a little longer.  Grapefruitseed extract  works well but takes a few days- be careful_ too much can burn the urinary track. This is the route I will take from now on.,F,55, 150 1X D,5/17/2010,Diflucan

Slowly they go away - but I mean slowly - with the vaginal area being last. It hurts every time you go to the bathroom_ and in between. Forget sex. It lasts for a month or more.

I was hoping this morning I would feel better_ but no such luck!  It's taking all I have to get my job done.  I don't know if I would recommend this medication.

There have been very few times that I've been as miserable as when the infection was at it's strongest: sharp burning pain while peeing and from affected areas. Ouch. The first dose didn't do the trick. Took another 150mg pill on day three and finally things started to get better. Before this I put topical anti-yeast medication which did nothing except make the irritation worse. I am very anti-Western medicine but this drug really made a huge difference.,M,38,3  days 1X D,5/6/2010,Diflucan
210, 3, Yeast Infection,I came to this website because after 30 minutes of taking Diflucan (generic) I started getting icthy lips. This happened about two months ago_ when I took it for urinary infection (prescribed for 3 days). At that moment I thought that the itching and posterior blistering of my lips was because of fever_ or stress. I know realize that the blistering and itching was caused by the Diflucan. I rather use a cream for the yeast infection instead of getting these blisters. I will not use again.,Now_ as I write this. I am also getting a headache. I feel like taking a Benadryl to counter the effect of the allergic reaction_ but I can not find any comments or contraindications that this can be done.,M,47,1  days150 mg 1X D,5/4/2010Email,Diflucan

The only thing I experienced was gradually increasing relief as threatment went on.  One dose and the yeast infection clears up and is completely gone after 7 days and relief of symptoms occured within 24 hours.  Normal external itching caused by yeast infection was sometimes present_ but I used a normal external cream for that.,F,34,1  days150 1X O,3/19/2010Email,Diflucan
216, 5, systemic yeast,"I have taken Diflucan over the last 20 years when my system gets out of balance. I have taken maybe 7 doses over that period of time.  Each time one 150 to 200mg per incidence. This last time I know how I cause my infection. It which was a sugar benge.  I started with a yeast infection on my chest under my breast (never had such).  It did not go away with normal antifungal.  I told my infectous disease doctor that the anti-fungus lamasil didn't work.  He noticed as well it didn't work.  After this experience I asked that he give me one dose of diflucan and then I'd do a liver cleanse.  For me diflucan seems to be the only drug that ""resets"" my normal flora when it get's out of control.  Like always I have had no major side affects.  I do notice the red area on my chest increased after showing but it did not itch.  In fact I don't feel any itching at the moment.  It's been about 5 hours since I took this one dose.",So I will say although I am aware of the potential side affects I do know that abstaining from sugars -all sugar is one of the major keys to successfully benefiting from this drug.  The system really has to have high quality nourishment and it works.After It's done it's work I usually juice for a week after and then use a liver cleanser and I'm good for 2-3 years.I believe the body has to work extra hard to expel the toxins when the diet is poor. Eg fast foods_ candy_ fried foods and red meat.  If you eating whole grain_ veggies -steamed along with nuts and deep water fish like tuna_ the side effects or minimal to none. Also regulating the sleep for the week after is very beneficial.  Eg Sleep at night before midnight and wake in the early morning.  I hope this is helpful to others,F,54,1  days200 1X D,3/17/2010Email,Diflucan
217, 1, possible yeast infection,the first pill I took: for one week had soar pinching feeling near liver.  2 days later burning sensation developed in the rectum and bladder.  From there on developed Bad gnawing/burning sensation in my bladder couple days before each menstruation.  2nd pill 2months later: no pain near the liver but bladder pain became daily instead of couple days each month.,Went to Gyno for STI_ did a wet mount and she said yeast_ I tested negative for std's. Monistat made the sti worse..so I'm thinking it wasn't yeast_ but took Diflucan shortly after Monistat failed.  I didn't have bladder pain before I took Diflucan_ but one day after I took it my bladder started having pain and this has been going on almost 5 months!!  Then I got yeast culture done and was negative/bacteria in urine and signs of UTI were negative_ but gyno kept trying to get me to take more Diflucan.  I took 2nd Diflucan pill & it made the bladder pain daily instead of couple days each month.  I've talked to a few others who have experienced the same.. Diflucan causing IC.  For some ppl diflucan helps but I think it is possible for it to cause chronic IC.  I've never had bladder problems in my life until now.  The pain is interferes with my daily life.  I think Diflucan can be a cause of IC needs to be researched more in this aspect.,F,30,1  days 1X D,3/9/2010,Diflucan

The name of the site is strange_ but trust me_ tons of great info on dif types of yeast infections and dif ways to cure them from Rx to home remedy. I had no idea that diet plays such a huge role in getting rid of an infection. But it makes sense now that I think about it. This site explains it thoroughly_ but basically yeast feeds on carbs and sugars.

About an hour to an hour and a half later I got up to go to the bathroom and fell due to severe weakness on my way back to the bed (less than 10 feet away). I could not get up or move. Just so happened to have cell phone in pocket. Friends had to break into house and ambulance was called. I was completely unresponsive and limp. Vital signs were all stable though. I don't remember anything more than calling my friends. I was released from the hospital in the early morning hours and told to go to my doctor that morning. Passed out again in the doctor's office and once again in the car on the way home. I remained exceedingly tired for 3 full days_ and slowly recovered from there.,I have taken this medication multiple other times with no side effects what-so-ever.

Knowing antibiotics cause fungal overgrowth_ I requested diflucan from my doc. After a few days_ my infections/rash started to clear_ then when the dose was over_ symptoms came back so she gave me a longer dosage time. The infection was severe but I stuck it out and everything is much better. I see where everyone is saying that the rashes and sores are the fault of the diflucan/flucanazole and for individuals very sensitive_ it may be_ but when my doc prescribed diflucan_ she said ""It's going to get worse before it gets better""..It was clear in my case_ at least_ that the first few days the diflucan was expelling ALL of the yeast/fungus in my body. Rash_ discharge_ throat_ tongue were inflamed_ but now_ my body is healing and psychologically I feel much better as all symptoms are clearing.

I was on two founds of antibiotics within three weeks of each other for a sinus infection_ which was the cause of my particular infection. About an hour after taking this medication_ I became slightly nauseated. About two to three hours later_ I also began feeling itchy on my head_ face_ neck_ chest_ arms_ legs_ and feet. I was worried I was having a bad reaction to the medicine_ but I never developed a rash. The itchy feeling lasted for almost a day. After 4 days_ my vaginal itching and burning feeling is gone_ but I am still noticing a slight white discharge after I use the bathroom.

Each time I would take difulcan.  Within a few hours of taking it_ my lower lip would swell_ burn_ and eventually blister.  I thought it was just a severe cold sore from my peanut allergy_ but my usual valtrex wasn't working.  Since it stays in your body for so long_ it would continue to swell and blister for 3 days and then start to go down.  The last time I took it I ended up with a bacterial infection in the sore_ so more antibiotics_ another huge cold sore.

However_ a few minutes after I took my last diflucan (which was a few days ago) I developed itchyness on all my body part that are moist_ vagina_ mouth (tongue more itchy than other part of the mouth) even ears. Then a few days later I feel metallic taste in my mouth followed by the forming up of white patches on the inner part of my tongue and finally cuts form on tongue and on the wall of my mouth that looks like big ulcers came out. It happened the last time when I took diflucan but I didn't notice it as I thought the symptoms were more like food alergy reaction (tongue itchy like I have been eating pineaple) but now I realised that diflucan was the culprit as I remember that at the end of 2007 I was getting the same thing for the 1st time and thought they were just common mouth ulcers.,F,37,1  days,2/12/2009Email,Diflucan

The taste is like strong buttermilk - not so great - but so 'worth it'!!! It's a 'natural way' to go_ plus zero side effects_ like the Diflucan can bring at times.

I also tried something called Proctosol or something like that.  I used that for 7 days; it was a anti-itch cortesoid I guess.  None of these worked.  The Diflucan worked FAST.  I felt relief almost right away.  The thing I remember most is how expensive it was.  $10 per pill_ since I paid over $100 for just a 2 week supply.  I know there are more expensive meds_ but it was the most expensive thing I had ever been prescibed (up until then at least).

It worked wonders after trying everything_ even previous diflucan pills_ but once a week.

Around the time I took the second pill_  began having horrible nausiousness and stomach pain. This turned into Dhiarhea that lasted for 5 days. During this time I was also having dizzy spells. At one point_ I was sitting at my computer_ developed tunnel vision and fell face forward into my computer. I rushed to my family physician where she told me it was probably dehydration from the Dhiarhea and that I may have caught rotovirus. No one else in my home exibited any symptoms of Dhiarhea. However my 16 month old daughter has been having balance issues. Did it pass into my breastmilk? My physician prescribed more diflucan at 400mg day 1 and 200 mg every day for 4 more weeks.

For those having issues_ continue to go to your Dr. until the infection is cleared.  If resistance to this drug_ there are other drug and treatment options.  I would not recommend trying anything until talking your Dr.  Much resistance is caused by overuse of drugs when there is not an ifection.

291, 3, To avoid yeast infection,Diarrhea_ and it allowed a non-Albicans species to take over,When I have a plain Candida Albicans infection_ this drug is like a miracle. Within 8 hours_ I feel much better. But I was taking it to avoid a vaginal yeast infection because I was on antibiotics for 2 months. Well_ it killed off all the Albicans yeast all right_ but in doing so_ it allowed other Diflucan-resistant yeast species to grow. Have you ever tried to get rid of Candida Krusei? You don't want to have to try! It took months and months of anti-fungals to get rid of that pest_ because it's resistant to most ordinary anti-fungals. I searched in the medical literature_ and found cancer and HIV doctors complaining about the same problem in systemic candida infections. The Diflucan kills off the Albicans species and that opens the door for other species to grow and flourish. So only use it if you have to_ and if you know you have a Candida Albicans infection. You can avoid or minimize the diarrhea by taking 1/2 a pill and then the other 1/2 a pill an hour or so later.,F,48,5  days,7/17/2007,Diflucan

297, 4, ,Diflucan can cause some stomach upset and dizziness_ however_ they will subside.,I use diflucan once a week for chronic yeast infections.  It is very effective but you must be sure to see your doctor regularly when taking multiple doses to ensure that you have your liver enzymes checked.  Also_ make sure that you watch out for drugs that interact with diflucan as they may cause some of the side effects I see mentioned on this page.  Erythromycin and Diflucan are dangerous combinations and should be watched carefully as they can cause a serious cardiac side effect.  It's a great drug for yeast but as with all drugs you need to ensure your doctor is aware of any other medications you are taking and follow directions carefully.,F,46,1  years,4/7/2007,Diflucan
298, 4, Avoiding Yeast Infection,I started with an ear infection.  My doctor prescribed Keflex which set off the worst yeast infection I have ever had.  Because of this infection_ I became aware that I had a rectocele and had to have surgery to repair it. After the surgery my gyno wanted me to take antibiotics afterwards to avoid any infection.  But antibiotics always_ always give me a yeast infection.  So he prescribed diflucan which_ to my surprise_ came in a single pill.  I took it and had no problems or side effects_ and very important to me_ no yeast infection from the antiobiotics.  But for the last 2 months I have been having a real problem with balance.  I thought maybe I still had the ear infection until I read the side effects from this one pill of diflucan.  So many people have mentioned balance problems.  I should mention that when I originally started with the ear infection_ there was actually no sign of infection_ just fluid behind the one ear that wasnt bothering me.  So my balance wasnt affected by any,,F,52,1  days,4/5/2007Email,Diflucan

But when I was 20 I heard about using active Acidophilous to restore proper vaginal ""flora"" and I have been using it with marvelous results every time I have had to use antibiotics.  I am so surprised that hardly any one knows about it as a relief of yeast infection.  It has absolutely no side effects unless you are lactose intolerant.  And it can be purchased in any drug store or health food store.  Just make sure it has ""live organisms"" and keep it refrigerated.

The first time I was put on Diflucan_ the infection was peaking_ and the skin on my feet peeled off (moulted?) like a snake skin. The drug is effective_ as indicated by blood tests_ and the disappearance of some my symptoms. I feel the side effects are more annoying than serious.,,M,59,4  months,2/16/2007Email,Diflucan
302, 1, Yeast Infection,Severe dizziness_ shortness of breath_ vertigo,I took 2 pills 4 days apart for a yeast infection.  With the first pill I was up all night with dizziness and shortness of breath.  Something else werid I noticed almost the whole time I was on diflucan my heart was racing.  The second pill was even worse.  I had severe diziness_ vertigo_ and shortness of breath. I felt like I was going to pass out. My heart was racing. I felt naseous. It was TERRIBLE. It has been almost 48 hours since I took the last pill and although I am feeling better_ I still have spells of diziness and shortness of breath. I don't reccommed this medication_ or if you must just use it with extreme caution! Explore the alternatives!,F,27,8  days,1/30/2007,Diflucan
303, 4, Yeast infection - not chronic,Mild abdominal cramping_ mild itching sensation that subsided after day one_ and fatigue,After day one_ the symptoms appeared to be gone_ but on the second day - they returned with a vengance!

305, 5, candidiasis,vertigo_ dizziness_ fatigue_ insomnia,I rated this a 5 so people will see it.  This drug is dangerous.  It has been 2 years since my last Diflucan tablet_ and I still experience vertigo_ dizziness and fatigue.  These side effects have improved over the last 2 years_ but I still have problems with loss of balance and dizziness.  If you experience this side effect_ STOP taking Diflucan immediately_ and inform your doctor.  Pfizer insists that it knows nothing about this side effect_ but both my doctor and I agree_ that Pfizer is lying.  Be careful.,M,45,90  days,11/8/2006,Diflucan
306, 3, oral thrush / sinus infection,i had no side effects.,dr thought i had a fungal or bacterial sinus infection. the dr. prescribed amoxicillin at high dose along side diflucan.  i didnt take the single dose of diflucan right away since i wanted to see if the amox would work. in the meantime_ the amox gave me thrush. then i took the diflucan along with nystatin swallow.  ultimately it cured the thrush but i still have the same sinus problems. go figure.,F,40,1  days,11/4/2006,Diflucan
307, 3, reoccuring yeast infections,I have only taken it in a one dose form in the past. Have not tried it for quite a few years but was concerned about side effects if I did. It did help cure the problem in the past but then the yeast came back. Feel beeter using cream.,Have been successful with change of diet and homeopathic cream. Avoid sugar and coffee.,F,38,1  days,10/24/2006,Diflucan
308, 1, Vaginal yeast infection,"After several days_ I had a ""herxheimer"" reaction.  Nausea_ fatigue_ dizziness_ chills and headache.  I had Epstein Barr Virus several years ago.  Use a cream instead and a homeopathic one and change your Diet!!!  No sugar or carbs!!",I don't like taking drugs_ but my yeast infection lasted 2 months_ so I was desperate.

310, 1, candidiasis,I was on a small dose (50mg)_ and experienced a bit of vertigo (dizziness) everytime i took a tablet.  The dizziness would only last for an hour or two.  Then after about 2 months of treatment_ I woke up one morning dizzy_ and now I've had vertigo ever since (over 1 year ago).  the vertigo and fatigue has improved (i could barely walk a year ago)_ but I am still no where near how I used to be.,This side effect is horrible.  There should be large warnings about vertigo/dizziness and how they can last for over 1 year.  I'm just hoping its not permanent.  Either pull this drug off the market_ or put proper warnings on it.,M,,60  days,1/21/2006Email,Diflucan

312, 3, Yeast Infection,None.It did not clear up all symptoms of my yeast infection. Needed additional OTC treatment_ herbs. ,It should not be taken once as a cure all or as a preventative med for future yeasts infections. We host the yeast organism natually so yeast could never be eradicated and if the environment is right for this type of fungus it will germinate (grow) in spite of Diflucan.  Frequent yeast infections are a sign of a major problem;work on eliminating source of yeast overproduction not symptoms only.  Someone asked about the side effects of Diflucan. The side effects of Diflucan are hives_ itching_ swelling_ sudden drop in blood pressure_ difficulty breathing or swallowing_ diarrhea_ or abdominal pain.,F,30,1  days,1/8/2006,Diflucan

314, 5, High Levels of Candida,None that I could tell.,I had abdominal distention and water retention almost every day. By mid day I went from a perfectly flat stomach to looking like I was 4 months pregnant. Once I started taking Diflucan it stopped. I had tried herbal antifungals_ probiotics_ the anti-candida diet_ etc. but my levels always came up high. It will be interesting to see if they are normal now.,F,39,7  days,8/25/2005,Diflucan
