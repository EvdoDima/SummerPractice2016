0, 5, Idiopathic Constip./Stool Retention,Nothing significant.,I am using this product for slow bowels. Not really overly constipated_ but it's not a smooth process each day! On the Linzess for the last few days since starting_ I have been able to have bowel movements which do not hurt my stomach. I do drink lots of water_ though_ which I know is good for me. I called the manufacturer of this product and wanted to know how long it would take to notice results_ if the product worked. They said_ very interestingly_ it would take a week to see results BUT would take between 6 and 9 weeks to reach its full effect! This is the reason to keep on taking a medication_ and give it time to work...unless_ of course_ you have terrible side effects. I will be taking this every day for the next few weeks and give it time to work. It already does!,F,57,4  days145MCG 1X D,5/25/2016Email,Linzess

2, 4, IBS C,I think that this medication is giving me migraine headaches. I am prone to headaches but they are worse then ever.,Anybody else notice that they have getting more headaches and feeling a little fatigued since starting Linzess?Other than the headaches_ Linzess is doing the job quite well. I don't seem to be bloated or constipated as I was before using the Linzess. Although_  sometimes I have to take Oval 180 to handle the bloating later in the day.I get the occasional diarrhea but I can live with that. I also seem to get some fatigue from the medication.Everyone else seems to love Linzess_ so am I the only one that is getting the headaches and fatigue?,M,62,7  months290 1X D,1/6/2016Email,Linzess
3, 4, IBS-C,hours long diarrhea_ chills_ feeling ill_ taking to my bed between bouts (usually have at least two),"Rated it a 4 because NOTHING else worked...can go a week or longer without pooping but have decided to take one day a week since I need hours out of the day to empty my bowels after taking one pill.  When I was taking it every day_ it was extremely bothersome_ even it was only water being ejected after nothing else left to come out.  Have had IBS-C for 30 years or more.  Back then it was diagnosed as ""spastic colon.""",F,48,1  years290 mcg 1X W,10/26/2015,Linzess
