79, 1, Water Retention,"2 years ago_ I was given this med as a combo with Lisinopril_ another deadly med_ and had to come off them_ myself!  As stated here_ prior to taking this med_ I was NOT a sickly person. At 42_ I felt 92!!!! A couple of ""wellness"" doctor visits and a quick BORDERLINE high blood pressure diagnosis landed me on these lethal drugs!  Went back to doc this past July for a rattle and wheeze in my chest I just couldn't seem to shake.  I specifically asked was it due to s respiratory infection and got a quick no_ but was told it was flour related and was prescribed HCTZ this time_ as a standalone drug.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  I was so eager to get rid of that wheezing that kept me up at night_ until I didn't do the proper research I normally do before taking any drug_ OTCs as well.  This time around_ I got socked with a whollop of aggressive symptoms:  hair shedding_ if my hair wasn't so coarse and thick it would be noticeable.  Terrible muscle cramps_ hands_ feet_ sternum area_ explosive bouts of nausea_ increased defecation and chalky in color and texture at times upon sight of it.  Stomach and abdominal discomfort do bad until I stayed doubled over a lot!  Shortness of breaths_ hard to breath at times as if I was going into cardiac arrest!  Numbness and tingling in toes.  ALL of this and some I've probably forgotten_ just for water retention!!!????  No thanks!

But what I did notice was that for the last half year these pills have NOT lowered my blood pressure_ in fact it was getting slightly higher.  Finally I researched ""Can Hydrochlorothiazide actually be RAISING my BP for some reason or other?"" The evidence was rather inconclusive. Nonetheless_ 12 days ago on my own advice_ I took myself off Hydrochlorothiazide. I monitor my BP 3 or 4 times a day. Low and behold my BP within 3 days was about back to normal. (Also cut back some on salt intake.) Quite coincidentally just BEFORE I stopped the medication_ I had lab work done at my doctor's office. All the blood results were normal except for a potassium deficiency. Doctor recommended potassium prescription. No_ no_ thank you. According to my research HCTZ can cause the potassium level to drop below normal which in",,F,76,2  years25 mg 1X D,2/22/2010Email,Hydrochlorothiazide

It does help lower my bp_ but I can't take the 25 mg. because of the side effects ( palpitations and headache and very dry mouth_ eyes_ etc.)_ so I take 1/2 tablet every other day_ and sometimes I skip a couple of days. Also_ I haven't had my potassium checked and wonder about that becoming a problem. It does work very well in lowering bp.,When I say 5 months on this_ it's been intermittent_ due to the side effects and having heart tests done (which turned out A-ok).,F,67,5  months,2/15/2005Email,Hydrochlorothiazide
