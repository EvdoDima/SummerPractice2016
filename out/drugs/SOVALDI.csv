0, 2, Hep C,Fatigue_ chronic diarrhea_ weight gain_ bloating,I tested clear at 4 weeks like many other people.  However_ the fatigue and diarrhea persist even though I haven't been on the medication for some time now.  I recently tested positive AGAIN for Hep C.  I too have noticed the memory lapses.  Since I feel worse now than for the 40+ years I had Hep C_ I don't think I'll be trying any other treatments and certainly not this one again.  The thing was my liver was in pretty decent shape for having Hep C - no scarring or cirrhosis it just kept showing up in blood tests.,M,62,6  months 2X D,7/6/2016,Sovaldi
1, 4, For Hepatitis C,"I am on the new_  6-month-long_   ""cocktail"" of Sovaldi plus Ribasphere.     I have noticed two side-effects:1).  Strange_  perplexing forgetfulness_  as though my short-term memory is not working.   Household items disappear_  then are found elsewhere_  and I don't remember having moved them.  I left the bathroom shower on overnight three weeks ago;  left the oven on for six hours two weeks ago.     I'll blank out when remembering something I know well.   Do note that this is NOT a trait I showed before beginning Sovaldi + Ribasphere;    I've never done ""senior-y"" things like these before!  I've always had a very sharp short-term memory_  so I think these drugs are making me slightly stupid.2).   The oddest feeling sometimes that my blood is not oxygenated enough.   I'll have the oddest moments in which I feel like my blood is not bringing enough oxygen to my brain or extremities;  I'll even have the odd impression that my blood is now ""dead"" and","I am on the 6-month regimen of Sovaldi and Ribasphere_  designed to knock out completely my Hepatitis C.     I can only assume it's working_  so my ""Satisfaction"" rating_  above_  is necessarily premature;    only blood tests and a final liver biopsy will tell us for sure.  Meanwhile I'm getting the funny side-effects described above.",M,51,2  months400 mg 1X D,1/6/2015Email,Sovaldi
