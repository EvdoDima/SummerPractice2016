0, 1, Painful Hemorrhoids,Abdominal cramping with SEVERE watery diarrhea--which I've learned is a known side effect to steroids. Abdomen became bloated and uncomfortably very distended after first dosage. Yet I didn't connect it to the suppository until the second dose_ unfortunately. Hours and hours of watery diarrhea_ cramping_ bloating_ nausea and headache/malaise kept me up all night_ running to the bathroom--all night long.  A very_ very unpleasant experience_ which I will never repeat. ,I wish I had known how much of the steroid is absorbed into the bloodstream by this suppository (almost 30%). If you are sensitive to oral steroids_ as I am_ be aware of this fact. I have taken virtually every hemorrhoid suppository and have NEVER had any reaction before this.,F,55,1  dayssuppositor 2X D,6/19/2014,Anusol hc
