0, 4, Addison's Disease,Weight gain!!! I gained 30 pounds immediately after being put on this medication_ which was terrible because I was already 50 pounds overweight. I have not gained any more weight since then_ but I haven't been able to lose it either.Sleep issues. I now go to be at 2am and wake up at 9 instead of my old routine of going to bed at 10 and waking at 7.,I feel energetic now that I'm on medication--it controls my Addison's symptoms well. I just wish it didn't cause weight gain.,F,22,1  years20mg 2X D,4/9/2015,Hydrocortone
