0, 1, High BP,It turns out I'd had a mini-stroke and my doc prescribed me this. Enalapril has a warning not to take if you have a history of blood clots_ stroke INCLUDING MINI STROKE.  Unfortunately my doc told me to quit reading the internet and trust him.  Big mistake -- it caused multiple additional mini-strokes and I now am gettin gvascular dementia and have less than 2 years to live.  This drug also caused severe arthritis and neuropathy in my legs -- can not walk anymore and have severe pain all day.  Also messed up my vision BAD.  I'm now nearly suicidal -- what the hell - going to die within a couple years anyway.  BEWARE IF YOU HAVE HAD A MINISTROKE or BLOOD CLOTS - plenty of other meds available. Currently taking Accupril with no problem _ but too late.  My life is ruined_ my kids will be fatherless and my wife a widow.  I'm so ANGRY -- never let a doc prescribe you anything without checkin git out thoroughally first.,BEWARE - the only Ace Inhibitor I've seen that shouldn't be taken if you've had a  stroke.  Side effects include MORE STROKES!!!  I should sue_ but am losing my mind - can't think clearly anymore.  Lost my job and my driver's license and my family hates me now - memory is FRIED.  Don't do it!,,56,4  months20 1X D,3/11/2016,Enalapril maleate

2, 1, pre-hypertension,"Prescribed by Dr. After about 5-6 weeks_ I developed a strange blister on my lower lip like nothing I had had before.  Quit taking it after doing some research online and finding out that pemphigus vulgaris is a rare side effect.  This is a condition where your skin becomes loose from your flesh and is ""ususally fatal if not treated"".  Note the other post under brand name Vasotec where the person got lip blisters and swollen face.","My doctor said I didn't have the condition and belittled my concern. ""Pemphigus is something totally different_ where your skin sluffs off_"" she said.  I said_ ""How does it begin? It surely doesn't start out as a full-blown case!""  The answer is it starts with a blister or lesion_ commonly on the face.  Look  it up.  I told her I would never ever take this drug again_ and got no more argument_ and she did not try to recommend an alternative.  I will live with slightly elevated blood pressure and work on it with exercise and good diet.  Wish me luck.  You can Google Pemphigus and Enalapril to find what I found.",M,65,40  days,2/1/2008,Enalapril maleate
