0, 5, High Blood Pressure,Vivid dreams_ a little nausea,It took only 2 weeks for me to stop 37 years of smoking cigarettes. The 2nd week I felt like I could take on the world because I wanted to quit! Chantix helped me to overcome the will to smoke by taking away the urge for nicotine / smoking a cigarette feeling. My lungs had been cleaned for 10 years. I haven't looked back either!!,F,63,3  weeks30 1X D,8/6/2016Email,Chantix

2, 5, I was ready to quit smoking,Vivid dreams.  It was well worth it.,I tried Chantix 3 different times.  I was finally successful! The main thing is not to stop taking it until you know you are strong enough. That was the problem with the other 2 times_ I thought I was okay after 3 months_ and I wasn't.  You never know when the craving will hit you.,F,47,4  months 1X D,7/11/2016Email,Chantix
3, 5, Quit smoking,Let me start by saying that I have PTSD from the military and have had problems with nightmares and depression for years. I have not noticed a change in my depression or bad dreams since starting chantix. This is a miracle drug for smokers and nicotine addicts. It stopped my urge to smoke by probably 90+ percent. You still have to have some will power and a desire to quit smoking. I have tried the patch_ the gum_ vapIng and cold turkey. Nothing else in the market can hold a candle to this pill. I am thoroughly impressed and am on my 3rd day of no nicotine and feel completely fine. I've read so many reviews that people are having severe depression and nightmares on this medication but I deal with this anyway Anderson  I have not had an increase or change in mood or nightmares. I just watched my father pass away 3 months ago due to COPD from smoking. He was 74 years old and would have been perfectly healthy aside from his lung problems from smoking. He had quit smoking when he was 69 but the damage was already done and we watched him slowly get worse and worse every year. I recommend anyone who is having a hard time quitting reevaluate whether they want to deal with a few weeks or months of depression and nightmares or years of breathing treatments_ steroids_ oxygen machines and movement restrictions. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle drug and I can't possibly be more impressed by how easily I quit. Weigh the consequences before you decide to stop taking no this med,,M,32,3  weeks,7/11/2016Email,Chantix

Several weeks off and still very irritable and depressed_ despite antidepressants.  Also went back to smoking because of the rage and depression_ so I know it's not nicotine withdrawal.,F,48,30  days 2X D,7/7/2016Email,Chantix

I have gained like 10 pounds and I have only taken Chantix for 19 days.  My eating habits have not changed at all.,I am not smoking as much_ but cannot seem to lay it down completely.  I have tried Chantix before and after about 1 week of taking it the cigarettes tasted horrible.  I don't have that this time.  I am extremely frustrated about the weight gain.  I have hypothyroid so I am already battling my weight.  That discourages me greatly.

9, 3, Quit Smoking,Severe nausea (if not completely full)_ tired_ agitated_ vivid dreams_ lack of energy_ severe taste/smell tainting_loss of appetite and small weight gain,In the beginning with the .5 mg I felt like I was on strong Valium. After a couple days and into the higher dosage very few tastes and smells were unaffected. Beef tasted rotten and sweets all taste odd. Most of what I like tastes different and unappealing so I force food down with little enjoyment. Mild but controllable agitation for brief time periods. Always sleepy. No energy. I force myself to get things done. Brief feelings of depression which are controllable. The dreams are interesting and weird but not scarey. (Only thing I like). I have cut back smoking by half on work days but don't find a lot of difference on days off when it's easier. Wish it would make them taste as bad as food. Had to cut out morning dose. Nausea preventing me from getting ready for work. Calming without a CIG? Yes. Miracle drug? No. Going to keep on it trying though. My last hope.,F,55,1  months1 mg 2x da,5/16/2016Email,Chantix
10, 5, To quit smoking,Crazy_ (but not bad) Vivid dreams. Mild nausea. Body aches. Irritability. Food tastes more distinct making me very picky at what I eat and not wanting 80% of what I normally would eat. Smell of tobacco is horrible now. Mild depression. Trouble sleeping at times. And moderate sensitivity to light. Severe stomach pain if taken on an empty stomach.,Ok_ Continued to smoke about 1-1/4 packs (about 25) mini cigars a day for about the first week on chantix_ when I went to the full dose_ after 3 days_ (day 10) I dropped to about a half a pack. 5 days ago_ 1 day after my planned quit day_ I just couldn't handle smoking anymore and quit. 4 days ago_ I quit having any negligeable cravings altogether. I smoked for 6 years and tried everything to quit_ weaning_ cold turkey_ niccotine patches and gum_ chewing tobacco_ even zyban (wellbutrin_ buopropin) nothing worked or even slowed me down from 1+packs a day. Then I tried Chantix and it's been amazing for me. The side effects are worth it for me to be smoke free_ hands down. After day 3 on chantix_ I did start to notice a gradual dislike for smoking until they were so nasty_ I couldn't even stomach the thought of smoking anymore_ then I quit_ and have almost forgotten what it is like to smoke. Truly amazing!,M,32,3  weeks2x1mg dail,5/5/2016Email,Chantix
11, 5, Stop smoking,Nausea_ weird dreams_ headaches occasionally_ trouble sleeping,I started on the starter pack and worked up to the full dose. The first few days were hard with nausea_ sleeping patterns getting messed up and weird dreams. I was concerned being on bipolar and adhd medication because of the warning with that diagnosis_ but I actually wonder if it helped curb the moody side effect people report_ as I am very stable on my meds. After a few days the nausea stopped_ as I found you definitely have to take it with food and eat small snacks with substance through out the day. (at least it helped me). The side effects I experienced were worth being smoke free now. I did not take the medication for the full 12 weeks because I had bar crawl one weekend and was nervous as it warns not to take with alcohol. But it turned out ok and still have no desire to smoke.,F,32,6  weeks 2X D,4/19/2016,Chantix

15, 3, To quit smoking,Nausea_ constipation_ gas_ irritability_ painful bloating_ lower abdominal cramps_ and diarrhea,i began taking Chantix as a 1 1/2 - 2 pack a day smoker. On the advice of my physician_ I began trying to cut back prior to my Chantix start date and within my first couple of weeks on Chantix. I was pleased with my progress and_ around the third week on Chantix_ I smoked my last cigarette. I did have some minor constipation and gas within that first three weeks and nausea when I took my morning dose (always with an 8oz glass of water and a small breakfast). Toward the end of my sixth week on Chantix is when the abdominal cramps began which was followed by diarrhea and bloating that would wake me right out of a sound sleep. The smells coming out of my body were otherworldly. After 6 days of not wanting to move because of the cramps and the pain and the nearly constant diarrhea_ I decided to stop taking Chantix. It's only been a day since my last dose so it's too soon to tell how long this might go on.,M,43,6  weeks1 MG 2X D,3/22/2016,Chantix

27, 4, To quit smoking,Vivid dreams_ extreme irritability_ anger_ overall hatred for humanity,I quit with Chantix 4 years ago. Then my fiancé started smoking (he harassed me to quit so when he started_ I started again). I don't remember the side effects then but right now_ I could probably kill. I quit on day 5 of taking Chantix - 3 days of one 0.5mg pill and 2 days of two 0.5mg pills. I don't even WANT to smoke. While my whole family might think I suck right now_ I'm not smoking so it's worth it. This personality change can't last forever_ right?! My only question is...was it okay to just stop taking the Chantix on Day 6? I don't feel like it was long enough to cause problems with not cutting down (since I only increased the initial dose 2 days before quitting). Any ideas?,F,37,6  days0.5 2X D,10/27/2015Email,Chantix

29, 5, Quit smoking/35 years,SEVERE stomach cramping_ cigarettes taste like ash_ mild nausea_ stange dreams_ restlessness.Oh yeah... VIVID Dreams.,I love Chantix because it WORKS. Dont expect much the first 7 days when your on a 1/2 MG. That is how it is supposed to work! The second week when you up your doseage is when you notice how you cant stand the taste. It happens gradual but it does happen. 2 weeks in this morning i woke up with extreme stomach pain. Having a hard time toughing out the work day. BUT... Im not smoking. I actually tossed them out this morning so im not tempted. I do agree with the vivid dreams thing. (Last night I dreamt i responded to a 911 call and some lady was on the floor screaming HE HIT ME IN THE NUTSACK!) Yeah... Weird. It must have something to do with what happens to you during the day because that word is not even in my vocabulary as a female_ but my 15 year old was saying it about his brother that day??

30, 5, To quit smoking,No side effects until after first 7 days when dosage increased to .10 mg. After increasing dose to full .1 mg_ within 45/60 seconds I had a terrible_ deep stomach pain that would double me over. The cramping/pain lasted about 30 seconds_ then would stop. 30 seconds doesn't sound very long_ but rest assured 30 seconds can be very long when you're enduring pain so deep there is nothing in your consciousness but pain.I had been taking Chantix when I woke up in the mornings on an empty stomach because I'm not a breakfast eater_ never have been. So_ I started eating a FULL breakfast and that helped quell the pain to a point I could get through the 30 seconds - but the cramping still happened. Therefore. I didn't stay on Chantix very long - about 2 more weeks.But_ it truly did help and I was extremely grateful that it wasn't a nicotine substitute - it truly removed the pleasure so I could break my addiction to nicotine.The stomach cramping was hideous - that was the impetus for me to g,,F,55,21  days.05 mg 1X D,10/3/2015Email,Chantix

32, 4, Quit smoking,This is my third time taking this drug and a completely different experience than the last two. I have a very short fuse_ anger_ aggression_ even going into a rage a few times_ insomnia_ anxiety_ headaches.,I'm exhausted. Haven't slept more than a couple hours at a time in a month. I am 23 days tobacco free. I also have no desire to have my normal glass or two of wine at night. Consequently_ I am also 23 days alcohol free. I'm in a stressful time in my life and all the side effects are amplified because of this I think. I am very anxious at times. The anger and aggression have sent me into a rage a few times though provoked. Does anyone have numbness in their extremities? I started having it while on the Chantix last year. I thought I had a stroke so I discontinued the drug. After an MRI showing no evidence of having had a stroke_ I started it again last month. The numbness seems to be getting worse.Mostly because of the anger and rages_ I have decided to take only half a dose and see how that goes. I started yesterday morning. There is no difference thus far but I will keep you posted.,F,53,30  days1 mg 2X D,8/3/2015Email,Chantix

45, 5, To quit smoking,My quit date was December 10th_ 2015 and I can honestly say that I have not had a cigarette since then.  I have experienced strange dreams and a few nightmares_ but nothing that has caused me concern.  I do experience nausea with each dose for about 1 hour after taking the medication.  I completed the 90 days @2/day and am weaning off now_ taking 1 per day.  I also have experienced mild headaches although this isn't everyday.  I have noticed a diminished sex drive but I am sure this will improve once I no longer take the medication.,This is my second time taking Chantix.  I took it 1.5 years ago and quit smoking for 6 months.  I made the mistake of thinking I could have just one cigarette and it resulted in me smoking 1ppd again in no time.  This time I know that just like any other addiction there is no controlling it or managing it_ there is only abstaining from it completely.  My husband is still smoking and now he wants to quit as well.  I am hopeful that he will_ I really hate the smell of cigarettes now.  He can't take Chantix_ his profession won't allow him to take this medication.  For the first time in almost 20 years I can breathe!!!  I can smell and taste and I am not coughing all the time.  I feel amazing.  I am thankful that I haven't experienced the horrific side effects that some have endured.

I started getting huge headaches and neck pain which is why I stopped taking it. It really does work though.,My husband also is taking it and i have noticed that his sex drive has almost diminished. He is normally a very compassionate person and since the chantix he acts as if he doesn't care about much. We've both smoked for the last 20 years and doing it together has helped keep us from starting up but I hope the personality change in him isn't permanent.,F,38,30  days 1X D,2/8/2015Email,Chantix
47, 4, Stop Smoking,Initially nausea with stomach cramps_ constipation_ insomnia_ irritable_ anxiety_ uneasy feeling_ vivid dreams. These all faded for me by third week (but I think you need to be pro-active & patient with the side effects). As the side effects became more manageable_ I was willing to stick it out further.,I've been a pack a day smoker for about 14 years. My first week I still smoked_ by end of the week_ I had cut back dramatically_ by my 10th day I was done and am almost a month without a cigarette. I still had a few cravings here & there_ definitely had to fight through the habit desires_ but it was much easier to do with Chantix. Side effects were rough in the beginning. I had awful insomnia (up 36+ hrs many times). Luckily I work nights so I could sleep during the day_ I honestly don't know what I would have done if I had to be to work normal day/office hours with the insomnia that was happening. I had terrible constipation. I was pretty miserable there for a couple of weeks. I had uneasy / anxiety feeling shortly after taking each pill. I only had nausea or cramping if I didn't eat before AND take with a full glass of water.  I had vivid dreams_ some weird ones but nothing awful_ just very real. I was irritable & snappy but no more than if I quit any other way. All in all_ as long as I don't have any long term side effects_ I couldn't be happier with my choice to stick it out with Chantix.  My boyfriend and I both decided to quit at the same time. He refused to try Chantix because of the side effect horror stories he'd heard. He's still smoking but I think he's starting to consider Chantix after seeing my much easier success with it.,F,34,1  months1mg / day,2/8/2015,Chantix

51, 1, Stop smoking,Depression_ anger_ crying spells_ nightmares_ joint pain_ feels like mouth cut up with glass.,I quit taking this medication today as the side effects are not worth it. I am a happy person who loves life. This last week I have been miserable. As I write this I am sitting here having a crying spell for no reason at all. I am sad_ depressed and don't want to do anything. I looked in my fridge tonight and noticed it was empty as I just haven't felt like going to the store for the past week.

55, 5, to stop smoking,Vivid dreams. I have been sleeping so much better though and I've set my alarm for later and that has been good.  Mild constipation_ but tolerable.,I've smoked 30 years.  I am not one to set a goal and stick with it.  Chantix changed that for me.   Took the pills for 2 weeks and then quit.   Tobacco free now for 18 days.   It was very difficult at the beginning_ but focusing on quitting this time_ combined with Chantix and using the GETQUIT online program daily has helped so much.   I was sad and depressed for a bit_ but I don't think it was due to Chantix_ it was more in grieving and saying goodbye to a habit I had for a very long time.   It isn't a magic pill that makes you quit_ but that pill along with just a little bit of desire to quit really works!  I'm very pleased with the results.,M,54,38  days 2X D,12/11/2014Email,Chantix

62, 3, Quit Smoking,So far on this journey I have experienced awful nausea that has seemed to increase since dosage has upped I tried to take before_ during and after I ate but that has not helped. I eat like I am 9 months pregnant and crave salty and sweet foods and I cannot seem to satisfy this hunger. The first week I was so bitchy I could not stand to be around myself_ felt weird and lost_ almost  like life would not be the same or as fun without smoking. I knew these feelings would come from the last time I had quit; I had read people will feel like they lost a best friend when they quit. I will say that it is when I am in the car that I smoke only by forcing myself to smoke. I hate to admit (because smokers lie about how much they really smoke) but I was upwards of a pack a day and now maybe 3-6 a day. I would normally go out for a smoke at work around 10:30 am and have 2 and that has stopped_ when I leave for lunch I will smoke a couple sometime 5-6 because I am driving and then I would go out agai,I think once I can get over the oral fixation and habit of smoking on car rides_ I think Chantix will actually (despite the awful side effects) work for me. I should stop buying packs but I have not reached that point I have bought 3 packs in almost 2 weeks when I was normally buying a pack a day so there is hope. My physician said that I could smoke during the first week but did not mention the week after_ she said that it actually should help you not to gain weight but I feel she just said that because she has been on me to quit for sometime now and knows I am an exercise freak. I really want to quit this time_ it's a disgusting habit and smokers are sort of shunned and placed in smoking huts for display_ it smells gross_ lingers and most of all awful for me. My daughter (well I am sure she knows) I make myself believe does not know I smoke because I never do in in front of her never did and never will but she has to smell it and there are time when I could not wait to get home_ sneak back out saying that I forgot something in the car or at the store. So I need to put my all into it however I am simply finding it hard to let go_ I suppose it may be best to treat this like ending a relationship or mourning a death.,F,32,12  days1mg 2X D,8/22/2014Email,Chantix
63, 5, To quit smoking,Mild nausea.   No anger_ no aggression that seems to be associated with Chantix.  In fact_ the opposite.  Unusually calm_ a bit detached from daily events by which I mean_ less caring_ no anxiety.  But not depressed.  I can remember my dreams_ something that didn't happen before Chantix.  Not bad dreams_ just dreams.,A pack a day smoker for 30+ years.  It took about 3 weeks to quit on Chantix.  I don't crave cigarettes but I miss the process of lighting up_ if that makes sense.  Just this week I've had bad cravings for the process at about 5:00pm.  I've lit up a couple of times but really didn't want the cig and put it out.  Chantix has worked for me.  It has made quitting easy with out the mad cravings and withdrawals.  I plan to stay on it for the full 12 weeks because I don't want to start smoking again.,F,52,7  weeks1mg 2X D,6/14/2014,Chantix

67, 4, quit smoking,These side effects were from the 1st time I was on Chantix (I quit for 5 years)...gas_ dreams - most were extremely BAD - woke up in the living room on my back with my husband holding me down...I tried to fight him when he had me cornered_ sick stomach_ rage_ violence.  I almost lost my job because of this drug..I was also going thru some very bad personal issues at the same time.  Father passing away_ then dealing with Mom not handling death_ then 11 months later Uncle passing away & Me in charge of his estate & during all of this I started going thru Menopause_ I cut my hair SUPER SHORT_ gained a ton of weight...just awful.  I think & My doc think Chantix made all of this worse.  2nd time on Chantix I'm in a much better place...no one dieing_ Mom doing better & I'm thru Menopause...I don't have the rage or the violent thoughts_ but do  have some other...sick stomach shortly after taking pill_ but it goes away in about an hour...gained weight_ but not as much as before,"The 1st time on Chantix...Horrible experience_ but I did quit smoking for 5 years...I started again because I'm truly an idiot.  Smoked for about 2 years & am now 2 Months non-smoker & VERY_ VERY HAPPY.  I think this time I was Really ready to quit...last time I was kinda bullied into it & had so much else going on in my life and I think Chantix made my problems worse mentally.  This time I only took Chantix for a month because of the weight gain & this time around my INS didn't cover & it is VERY expensive - almost 300 bucks.  I still have some cravings_ but they are easy to ignore and I tell myself ""ITS JUST THE ADDICTION TALKING"" and this usually gets me thru it.  I am glad I am longer smoking & will not be an idiot again and start because I do not want to take Chantix anymore...I feel Chantix works & it did help me to quit and made the withdrawls much more bearable_ but it now scares me on the long term side effects...No one knows what it does in the Brain.  The First time with Chantix those problems with rage & violence stayed with me for a couple years after I stopped.  Just remember you have to WANT to quit smoking...no one can force you_ bully you into it...if you don't want to quit you won't be successful.

69, 5, everything else failed,Contrary to some of these comments_  Chantix is not the devil. .i literally started smoking when I was 13.... Since I was 16 though_  I have been smoking no less than a pack a day. ... especially when I served in Iraq (about 2 packs a day for 16 months)....I thought I would never quit but I haven't had a cigarette since a day after the super bowl. ...yes I have side effects. ..i definitely feel nauseous after taking it and it lasts for about an hour or so each time. ... yes I eat and drink water with it.... but I'm not complaining about that. ....i can seriously deal with nausea and vivid dreams If it means I'm not smoking. ....no it is not a magic pill. ... You still need to be semi educated and realize that all this does is block the addictive nicotine from getting to your brain. .... but Your urges and you're habits (lighting up after a meal_  lighting up when you get in the car_  etc.) are very powerful as well and that is where you have to put a little work in yourself to fight your urges. ... Grab a piece of gum. ... Do whatever you have to do to get it off your mind. .. but please. ... dont Ruin someone else's chance to quit with Chantix because you had a bad experience. .... It's simple. ... Try it for yourself_  and if the side effects are too bad then stop_ but don't let other people keep you from trying to make a HUGE CHANGE in your life like so many people already have. ....end rant!

70, 1, stop smoking,3Rd time taking medication_ the first two times has small success and no real side effects other than nausea and vivid cool dreams_ this time taking it start OK the smoke week_ until day 2 of higher dose_ had such a debilitating nightmare_ woke up in middle of night gasping for air with horrible chest pain_ shortness of breath and jaw pain from clenching my mouth so tight. The next day my husband said I was screaming and trashing in my sleep. The entire next day I had this sense of dark doom_ can't really describe it too well_ had lingering chest tightness_ coincidentally I had appt with my Dr this day_ explained to him what happened and he talked me into giving it a second chance to see if it was a one time thing.  So for the next week_ I had somewhat uninteresting dreams.  It wasn't until I missed a days dose and then started back on_ it was Friday_ that night I was up almost every 2 hours_ slightly confused like I had something to do_ but I didn't_ would pee and go back to sleep_ on Saturday my day felt very off_ until Sunday_ what I can remember of the day I spent in very drowsy pretty much I would say blacking out at several points at around 6pm it had seemed as if I was lifted out of my fog_ and I realized that I had a huge gap in my day that I absolutely don't remember_ I know I was home and really didn't do much but relax on the couch n play on my phone_  but it's so hard to explain it's as if I was watching myself from the outside_ but only checking in time to time!,,F,26,2  weeks,2/2/2014Email,Chantix

73, 5, To quit smoking,Before starting Chantix I was scared it wouldn't work. The first week I cut back on smoking to test the waters. I must say durning the first 7 days I wasn't ready to quit and cutting back was hard. It kept saying pick a quit date. Finally when I hit that 7 day mark and increased dosage_ I had no problems quitting. I put myself through a lot of anxiety that first week. fearful of the what ifs. The pill really seemed to do what it's designed to do. As for side effects. I have had a headache every morning_ this is something I will gladly deal with to stop smoking. I have been tired and dream more often. Other than an odd feeling of empty which could be from chantix or nicotine withdrawls_ I am doing okay. I would so recommend this method. Just monitor yourself_ at the end of the day we all have the same goal which is quitting smoking. Remember loosing weight_ dieting_ getting in shape_ working out_ none of this is easy. Neither is quitting smoking but chantix gave me the extra help needed to put down the smokes! Thanks Chantix. Oh and after two weeks on chantix I am stopping the pills. Just didn't love the way I feel but I am now a non smoker. Good luck to others and these really do work!,,F,50,2  weeks,1/18/2014,Chantix

However_ I will mention_ that all of my above mentioned symptoms are ALSO side affects of quitting smoking so it is difficult to determine if it is the pill making me feel like this or if it's the lack of nicotine.

Am quite concerned that other side effects will begin after stopping because of warnings and what I've read here.,took this once and worked like a charm_ fell off cigarette wagon at a convention while drinking (still want to kick myself in the butt for that idiot move)  Second try and I thought it was the Chantix giving me terrible headaches so I quit before the first week was out - turned out they were stress headaches.  This is my third try and this time the fatigue is astoundingly bad and the cravings are still hitting me - which did not happen on try 1 or 2.  I'm going to try to stick this out for another 10 days and then wean myself off in  a reverse dose of week one.  Am going to try the reverse dose mostly because of what I've read about after effects and other's experiences ~  figure it's better to be safe than sorry with withdrawing from the Chantix.

I quit taking the drug and started smoking for 2 more years.  Tried again in March after looking at the pills for 3 months.  It has worked beautifully and was much easier this time - must have been ready. Still have some cravings and have smoked one or two the last  two months but they taste awful and reminds me of how far I have come. Have noticed just recently that I am depressed and angry...hoping that it goes away after my last month. I am only taking 1 pill a day now to try to start weaning. Don't read too much into all these reviews.  The pros greatly outweigh the cons of this drug...I say it's a miracle drug as well. I sure feel better about myself and my bank account is a lot fatter!,F,43,60  days1 mg 1X D,5/1/2012Email,Chantix

97, 5, To quit smoking,Week 1: Cigarettes started tasting really bad near the end of weekWeek 2: Did not have a cigarette..no real urge to have one...didn't really think about it....I had REALLY VIVID dreams during this week.  Which included me and my Mom (of all people) fighting ZOMBIES.  (We lost)....no urge or craving to smoke.  i do feel sick when taking meds on a empty stomach.Week 3: No significant urge to smoke.  I have noticed I do like to eat a little more than usual..which I can not afford to do.  I also noticed_ I don't drink as much coffee as I use to.  Something else I noticed_ (warning TMI) my urine has a really strong (pee-pee) smell to it and it is rather dark in color.,"I smoked for 12-13 years.  I am really glad I tried this product! I have never really tried to quit smoking.  However_ I have made the New Year's Resolution to quit MANY times and always end up putting it off. It feels good to say ""I quit smoking"" or ""I don't smoke anymore"". Overall I am VERY pleased with Chantix!",F,32,3  weeks1mg 2X D,4/12/2012,Chantix
98, 5, To quit smoking,nausea - HAD to take this with food or I felt sick to my stomachDreams - Yes_ what you hear is true.  You will dream more vivid dreams.  Where you normally had 2 to 3 dreams a week that you can recall you will have 3-5 a night and recall every detail,keep smoking while taking something to help you quit?  Awesome!  I smoked around a pack and a half a day_ sometimes more.  I haven't smoked a cigg in almost 2 months_ now.  This will NOT make you quit_ but help you.  I got down to 2 a day and realized I didn't need it anymore.  Only YOU can make the final choice.  If you're not ready to quit then don't bother starting Chantix.,M,29,2  months1mg 2X D,2/19/2012,Chantix
99, 5, to stop smoking,nausea_ some sleeping troubles_ feeling yucky_ headaches_,I was extremely skeptical to take this drug as I have read some negative feedback from previous people taking it.  But I really wanted to quit and I was unable to do it on my own.  The first week it was hell basically I wasn't myself_ feeling depressed_ tired and extremely lazy.  The second week it got better.  By the third week while taking 2 x day (1mg pill) I was feeling always nauseas and I hated feeling that way_ so I just decided to take 1 x day (1mg) and feel much better.  I haven't smoked since Dec 8th.  I did try to have one just to see if I still like it but the smell and the nicotine did not do anything for me_ so I knew that I am slowly weaning myself from cigarettes.  I  think what people need to understand is that it will take some time before you actually start feeling like yourself again.  Any drug out there has some kind of side effect.  I do agree also that this drug is not for everyone.  I'm just glad that I am smoke free and I hope to be this way forever.,F,32,50  days1mg 1X D,1/6/2012Email,Chantix
100, 1, To quit smoking,Some nausea_ loss of sleep_ loss of appetite_ short temper_ gas_ vomiting.,My side effects were from when I was on it. Now that I am off it_they are all way worse.

102, 3, Stop smoking,Depression_ Insomnia_ Weight gain_ Feeling like crap_ Sick to stomach_gas _ Bad headaches.,I started smoking when i was 16 years old. Its was a habit i enjoyed. But as ive gotten older Ive had children and they hate me smoking. I also started havin the smokers cough in the mornings. But what really made me stop was my Father layin in his death bed with Cancer and he asked me to please stop smoking. I lost my father .He was 60 yrs old. He passed away Sept 14th 2011. I have been smoke free for 40 days!! I want to live to see my great grandkids.  This medicine has made me sick..Its made me want to die. I felt worthless and cried all the time. The first 3 weeks of this medicine Is living hell. Thank God i had family and my boyfriend to help me through. I dont suggest anyone take this medicine and be alone. The medicine works..Im better and im glad im not smoking. But honestley there has to be a better way.,F,37,2  months1mg 2X D,1/2/2012Email,Chantix
103, 5, Couldn't quit on my own,This is the 3rd time I have quit smoking on chantix and the only reason is because I CHOSE to start smoking again. Not because the pill didn't work. The first two times I had absolutely no side effects_ but the 3rd time around I did experience no appetite_ really bad dreams_ a little nausea and some stomach pain. This was very unsual for me considering I never experienced these side effects before_ but I was also under a great deal of stress which could have helped trigger this off. Overall I rate this to be an excellent source to help in quitting smoking_ with a high success rate. Not everyone will have side effects_ but if you ask me_ 1 month of side effects is a small price to pay to quit smoking and be healthy again. I reccommend this product to everyone_ if you are serious about quitting. It really works.,Im so proud and happy I quit. My kids are so happy too!,F,29,20  days1 mg 2X D,12/28/2011Email,Chantix

I told myself im going to take chantix and its gonna work and im gonna quit and im not going to get depressed or want to kill anyone. And it worked! I smoked for 15 yrs and i loved smoking! But i WANTED to quit. I was ready. I still have the obsession but i get on my knees every morning and ask my God to remove the obsession.  It worked for vodka_ im sure he will rid me of the obsession soon. Thank you chantix thank you God.

107, 1, Stop Smoking,Severe nausea_ severe stomach pains_ severe constipation_ severe diarrhea_ severe vomiting. Fatigue_ laziness_ dull mood. Loss of appetite. Everything tasted funny. Crazy dreams (not nightmares). Joint pain_ particularly in right elbow. Experienced a very painful lump behind vein on right side of neck. Memory loss and brain fog,"Laid on couch for 5 days straight not wanting to do anything_ and I am on the computer usually the whole time I am not sleeping or at work. DO NOT USE THIS DRUG_ it may ruin your life. I lost all interest in the things I love to do everyday (hobbies). 2 weeks later and still have a very low interest in these things. .

108, 5, to stop smoking,,I quit cigarettes on the 10th day of this medication with absolutely no problem. Chantix is a miracle drug in my opinion. I have been a smoker for about 35 years_ and was smoking 1 pack a day when I quit.eta:  Still not smoking 5 months later.  Brief_ fleeting cravings only occasionally.,F,54, 1 mg 1X D,10/27/2011EmailHistory,Chantix
109, 5, to quit smoking,Some nausea soon after taking pill_ aggression_ agitation_ mood swings_ smelly urine_ vivid dreams_ some insomnia.,Ok_ so the list of side affects seem a bit excessive but it really isn't that bad.  I have been a smoker off and on for the past 12 years and became more of a heavy smoker soon after meeting my husband (he is a smoker too). With that said_ we recently found out that we will need IVF to start a family and smoking can no longer be an option for us.  I want to be healthy and have the best body for carrying a baby.  The Chantix works like a charm. I quit after the prep week 7 days.  I do have some cravings_ and at times they are a bit strong but I just feel deep down inside that I don't need the cigarette and the urge will pass.  I also drink a lot of water. If u have your support system in place you can be successful and will be able to get through the rough patches like yelling in the car in the middle of heavy traffic. My husband is completely understandable and let's me know when my mood has taken a bad turn.  The worse part for me is the insomnia...I get very little sleep and this is every single night.  I get up to go to the restroom and then I'm up for the rest of the morning. I'm averaging 4 to 5 hours a sleep every day. I want to be a mother more than anything in the world_ so I have to loose some sleep but I working to be a non smoker and I want it to be for a life time and Chantix is helping me get there.,F,33,3  weeks1mg 2X D,10/26/2011Email,Chantix
110, 4, To become a Non-Smoker,A few vivid dreams the first week.  When I stopped smoking altogether I was extremely sad_ depressed_ anxious.  Not sure if this was from the Chantix or my body detoxing (I smoked a pack a day for 25 years).  My insurance did not pay for the medicine (which is unfortunate) so I am slowly weaning myself off of the drug (half a pill in the morning_ half at night).  I did notice that by doing this_ I have had some cravings but nothing that I can't manage.,This drug really worked for me.  I did not have many side effects.  However_ it still was difficult to quit (I loved smoking).  Chantix helps with the physical withdrawal somewhat_ but for me I had to overcome the psychological withdrawal as well and that was tough.  For those that are struggling_ keep going!  For me_ things started to get better and now I LOVE not be addicted or controlled by cigarettes.,M,39,60  days1MG 2X D,10/17/2011,Chantix
111, 4, ,The first time I had other medical problems and had to get off it to rule out medical problem. This is my second time on Chantix. The last time I was smoke free for 8 months and that was with taking the pills for a week. The mistake I made was not continuing it for the full 12 weeks. So I am back on again to finish it all.,My side affects are very mild; gas and skin kind of breaking out (lightly) but it may be from major stressors in my life as well. I don't like how I feel tired and when I try to nap sleep does not come!! So I just take a sleeping pill at night. I love how I do not have the craving mentally or physically. No bad dreams...just vivid ones. Unfortuantely the drug is not for everyone. But the ones that it does work for...Good luck!!,F,51,10  days 1X D,9/19/2011Email,Chantix
112, 5, Smoking cessation,Sleep frequently broken leaving me tired in the day.  Occasional insanely itchy forearms!!!  Like right now!  I'm looking for heavy grit sandpaper -- I'm going nuts!  Some gas in the beginning_ some vertigo from time to time_ dreams have been mild and very pleasant.  I feel very fortunate that my side effects have been minimal.,I know I'm among the very lucky candidates who have had no seriously negative side effects.  The itchy forearms is nearly unbearable when it strikes.  Otherwise_ I'm absolutely amazed.  I have absolutely no desire to smoke other than the psychological habit_ which is completely manageable since I don't physically crave cigarettes anymore_ and I can even hang out with my former smoker friends at work and their smoking doesn't phase me in the least.  And I DON'T nag them_ either.  It's a tough choice.  I smoked for about 30 years_ about a pack a day.  I LOVED smoking_ so the fact that Chantix has worked this well for me really does seem like a miracle!  It's a shame it doesn't work like this for everyone.,F,46,35  days1 tab 2X D,9/4/2011Email,Chantix

114, 5, to quit smoking,First few days I was sleepy and had mild stomach cramps. Still experience mild cramps if take pill on empty stomach. Have had some vivid dreams_ but not scary ones.,This drug offered the boost I needed to stop smoking.  I did smoke longer than drug company recommends_ but my doctor was very honest with me about having to personalize the pattern of cutting back and not being too harsh about it.  This has worked_ and I can hardly believe I can say I've been nicotine free for 9 days and feel great. Started to exercise to control weight gain_ though (7 lbs and don't want more!). I would suggest Chantix to anyone as a BIG help once you make up your mind to quit.,F,57,90  days1 MG 2X D,8/18/2011,Chantix

116, 1, Quit smoking,Loss of emotional senses.  Feeling of emptyness. Almost a sense of emptyness in my brain.  I did have dreams while on Chantix_ but they weren't horrible...dreams of being with my loved ones who had passed on.,Loss of sense of happiness_ severe depression_ anger_ and hate of everyone and everything around me.  I began to hate my children_ my husband_ and my 18 mo old grandson_ I even avoided my best friends.  I've gained 70 pounds in the three months since I've been a non smoker.  While my smoking habit of nearly 3 packs a day is gone_ I'd rather be the person I was before I began my journey with this drug.  My life is really just not worth much anymore.

The constipation is more than I can stand not having bowel movements for 5-6 days. I've gained 35 pounds as a result.,I find it easy to quit.  I also find it easy to smoke while on it.  None of the usual smoking side effects.  You still need to break the habit of purchasing cigarettes_ lighters_ etc. But at anytime its easy to stop smoking once you have restarted. Recmmended to me was to take Chantix a month longer than you think.,M,49,120  days 2X D,6/26/2011Email,Chantix

I have tried: patches_ gum_ lozenges_ electronic cigarettes_ cold turkey....this is my second time on Chantix--the first time I quit for three months but went back to smoking because I gained 10 pounds. This time-- as I know Chantix will work--I plan to combat weight gain with exercise and diet. Good luck everyone! The effects of smoking no where compare to the inconveniences of Chantix.

126, 5, Quit Smoking,Lots and lots of VIVID dreams_ mostly normal but occassional scary ones in the beginning.  Basically whatever I thought about that day_ I dreamt about that night.  Drowsiness_ good for night time dose_ bad for morning dose.  The worst of all however is the pain and nausea for 15-30 minutes after morning dose.  Have tried everything_ with food_ w/out food_ milk_ tons of water_ etc...  Just can't escape it.  Will suffer however_ because this pill works!,Aside from the gut wrenching pain and nausea during mostly the morning dose_ this is a miracle pill.  I took Chantix for 3 weeks before quitting.  The day before my offical quit day_ I couldn't even choke down the last 3 cigs I had_ and hardly smoked that whole weekend.  So_ quitting was easy to say the least.  The cravings are short and with each day_ much less.  I am on day 9 and have made it through one full weekend_ which I dreaded_ but it was pretty easy.  I will obey the warnings from others however not to just go off it all at once.  This has been sort of an anti-depressant for me as well.  I not only quit smoking but have much less desire to drink and have been much more motivated at home and work.  I will ease off the drug eventually and work with my physician to avoid sliding into a depression w/out it.  Good Luck to those out there_ I feel like a million bucks not smoking!,F,44,4  weeks1mg 2X D,4/12/2011Email,Chantix

I started a blog about my experiences using Chantix because I had read so much about the side effects when I first started using it. http://chantixblog-review.blogspot.com,Overall_ I have found quitting to be quite easy on Chantix. I had a firm quit date_ and stuck to it. I didn't necessarily wait for the Chantix to really make me hate the taste of smoking. It has really helped with the cravings.

Constantly cold_ not to the point of chills_ but noticeably right after taking one and then tapering off till the evening pill is taken.,This is the second time after a failed attempt several years ago trying Wellbutrin.  In my case_ it definitely curbs any interest in smoking_ especiall compared to taking the Wellbutrin.  But the primary_ and secondary side effects are a bit difficult to deal with.  Between a strong desire to quit_ and the effectiveness of Chantix_ I'm pretty sure this will work.,M,42,3  weeks1mg 2X D,3/8/2011,Chantix

This drug has worked wonders for me. I mean_ all the side effects are manageable_ I would rather have them than to continue smoking. I had a hard time trying to break the habit of smoking_ even when I didnt crave the cigarette. I eat ALOT of ice_ carrot sticks and pretzels and I am fine. I havent had a cigarette in 14 days_ I started Chantix about a month ago. I stopped smoking fully after 9 days. I am glad I jumped out there and spent that $150.00 it was well worth it. Luckily for me_ all the crazy side effects I heard people were having didnt apply to me. I had the pills for a month before I took them because I was so scared I was going to try and kill myself or someone else_ lol.

Found out as I started when Drug was new on market_ there were issues with vision and could even cause glaucoma. Had to have my new glasses changed within 30 days_ and was told if still wearing contacts_ the doctor would have said I switched them in the eyes! My right eye totally changed_ and left one too. Go figure!,This drug worked_ but at what cost? Yes_ I was thrilled to know it was not putting nicotine into me_ but playing with the brain caused many other issues.  Started smoking again gradually 1 to 2 a day then back to one pack.  Decided couldn't handle the eye issues and mood/sleep issues. Would love to quit but will try different route.,F,62, 30 mg 1X D,1/6/2011Email,Chantix

Alleviated nausea_ vivid dreams and trouble sleeping stopped.  Don't know if it was the combo of Chantix and Topomax_ but whatever it is_ it's working for me.  It's the first time in 15 years I've been able to quit for this long_ usually I've gone 2 months and struggled to make it that long.

145, 4, To stop chewing,Red rash on neck at the beginning when I started taking Chantix.Vivid dreams-Not so bad_ some were enjoyable since I usually never remember my dreams.,I smoked 1 pack per day for 10 years and to quit smoking I used chewing tobacco as a crutch. Well_ imagine this (sarcasim). I became addicted to that for a period of 5 years.  Over the last two years I attempted to kick nicotine altogether by using various methods such as cold turkey_ patch_ gum_ and even a natural herbal supplement.  Needless to say_ I failed each time.  I recently inquired about Chantix and my physician prescribed it to me.  To me_ it works like a wonder drug. Now_ there is still work_ YOU HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT.  One must still break the day-to-day routine and association with addiction. No magic pill for changing your lifestyle exists. You just have to do it and want to do it. I have not touched any tobacco now for 20 days which is first time in 15 years.  Couple the assistance of the medicine with my DESIRE TO WANT TO QUIT_ and there is no reason I can not be 100% successful. Be honest with yourself_ stopping a multiyear daily habbit WILL be difficult no matter what_ how bad do you want it?  There are a lot of potential side effects that YOU must discuss with your doctor. For me_ I worked with my doctor and wife to closely monitor my behavior.  I would rather have a brief period of discomft and change in my life to add on 10-30 years at the backend.

It has caused irreparable harm to me.  It caused me to lose my job_ the girl of my dreams_ degraded my friendships_ family relations and had me end up in the psych ward where I was forceably given more brain damaging drugs (neuroleptics).

148, 2, To quit smoking,"Not sure if I will (should) continue this drug. At first (and still) pretty serious nausea - that lasts a while - 30 minutes to 90 minutes every morning. Did not notice it at night. But the dreams were HORRIFIC!!! Like Chainsaw Massacre - only worse. It seemed that things (pets_ loved ones) that I cared about were ""pulled"" into these bizarre dreams and hurt_ mercilessly. The worst one was 2 days ago_ and it was so bad that it woke me up_ and - this is the kicker - I STILL COULDN'T TURN THE DREAM OFF! What is this???","Anyway_ after that_ I talked myself into trying it one more day_ and the next night (although I was terribly afraid to fall asleep) was full of lovely_ vivid dreams. The next day went OK_ but later that evening_ I found myself thinking that ""there is no reason for me to live."" I suppose this is terrible_ but right now_ the way I am feeling_ it sounds completely RATIONAL - and I don't feel either depressed or discouraged!

149, 5, To Stop Smoking,A little nausea in the very beginning_ but that subsided after 3 days.  I even take it without food_ just coffee,Started the Starter Kit on November 3rd_ 2009 and completed stop smoking on November 23 just short of 21 days. In those 21 days I continued to smoke and did not try to cut down.  The pills did that for me. I just felt like smoking less and less until I noticed that I went home and did not smoke for the entire day.  t's been almost 1 year and still no desire to smoke. In fact when I do smell it_ I would get a nauseau feeling_ which I think is an advantage b/c it will help me not to want a smoke. I hardly think about it.  One thing that has escalated is my thyroid problems. I become hypo about 8 years ago and smoking suppresses the thyroid systems_ so when I quit and after 2 months_ I totally crashed with the thyroid. I was undermedicated. Now I am trying to get optimized and am confident will get there_ but this will take some time.,F,54,2  months10 mg 2X D,11/2/2010,Chantix

This drug is GREAT_ I never thought I would be able to survive the first several days before and this drug really has made it easy.

Took a lot of will-power not to smoke again_ and I've been 8 months smoke-free.  I've been battling insomnia from the start_ and it's gotten progressively worse_ 2-3 hours per night. Hard to manage a family_ home_ and job without sleep. Turning now into depression & anxiety_ and I've recently started on an anti-depressant.  I'm convinced it's the Chantix.

Strange swollen joints in fingers (not sure if any of these are related to chantix other than nausea),Seems to me that after suddenly stopping smoking after a pack a day for 12 years_ that one should expect some discomfort  of some sort. Good news is that I quit with no problem_ tried without drug and failed many time_ I'll take a little less sleep and nausea for reduced chance of DYING from cancer_ heart disease or some other smoke related death!Chantix= no smoking.

156, 3, Stop smoking,Sever nausea and diarrhea,I smoked 1 pack a day for 24 years.  I tried may other products to stop smoking that didn't work.  I quit with Chantix and have not smoked for over 1 year.  Now for the bad part.  While taking Chantix_ I had sever nausea and diarrhea everyday_ both of which lasted about 3 hours at a time. The diarrhea is so bad I have almost no warning and I can't leave the house until it has run its course for the day.  I suffered through this because the Chantix had really helped me to quit smoking.  When it was time to stop taking the Chantix_ I was really looking forward to not feeling sick again.  I stopped taking the Chantix almost 1 year ago.  The nausea and diarrhea have never gone away.  It has subsided a little over the last year.  Sometimes I even have 3 or 4 days in a week when I am not sick.  But I am still sick more days than not.  I don't think my stomach will ever get back to normal_ but I'm still not smoking.,F,39,4  months 2X D,8/2/2010,Chantix
157, 1, to quit smoking,I can't remember my dose. It was over a year ago. I still wanted to smoke_ but the nicotine didn't get through. That's what's supposed to happen_ but at the same time champix (Canadian name) is supposed to satisfy your cravings. Well_ it didn't satisfy anything_ and since I wasn't getting any hit from smoking I lit cigarette after cigarette dragging as hard as I could. I quit champix half way through the 2nd day. However_ it had screwed everything up. I had been smoking 10 cigarettes a day and now went up to 13 or more. I was only smoking 8 when I first tried a stop smoking product and with every method I tried I ended up smoking more. Glad it works so well for some of you_ though! I'd try the nicorette inhalers but they took the sample packs off the market_ and there's no way I'm paying $42 for a product that probably won't even work_ given my experiences so far.,,M,63,2  days 1X D,7/21/2010Email,Chantix

I started smoking occationally_ socially_ bad idea. It snowballed to a pack a day again. I decided to take it again_ and I seem to be hit by all the side effects where as before it didn't bother me. I feel like an emotional wreck_ I switch between confusion_ depression_ with small bursts of anger and aggression. I hate everyone and the next second im sad because everyone hates me. I flip flop between logic and emotion. I know this is not true_ then the emotions come on a second later. I figured since I took it first round_ with no issues_ it would be the same.

Every time we take this_ it helps us stop within the first week.  However_ once we stop taking it_ it doesn't take long before something stressful happens (such as a death) and we start right back up.  It works GREAT!!!  But I just wish we could stay stopped.  Took 2 yesterday and one today so far and I already have zero interest in smoking.  I can normally take 2 the first day_ 2 the second day then one the rest of the time.

The muscle pain can pretty bad and it normally comes in the form of bad muscle cramps that plague me every night. But I am also on two other meds with the same side effects_ Glucophage and Advair. So to be fair Chantix shouldn't get 100% of the blame.,This medicine has been great!! I have had no problem quitting smoking. I am in my 4th week of the drug_ and 3rd week of being quit. I have not cheated and do not have the urge to. The benefits outweigh any side effects. The dreams are like a mini adventure every night.

I can feel that way from quitting cold turkey.  But after talking to friends and knowing that they have to put all that stuff in there for legal reasons and if you look at the warning from aspirin or anything else_ they have to list any and all possibilities.  I quit smoking cigarettes on day 7 of taking the meds and thought that I might have immunity to the meds because I was climbing the walls_ just like if I had quit cold turkey I was feeling better by day 10 but by day 12 noticed a rash of skin lesions ranging from pin point to dime size.  I thought at first it was a few spider bites or something but day 13 I woke up with about 30 lesions and no one else in the house had anything like this.  I'm on vacation visiting the in-laws which is one of the reasons I chose to quit now_ because they don't know I smoke and it would not go over well at all.  Unfortunately I can't talk to anyone about what going on with me and am totally freaked out with this skin thing.  Day 14 - quit taking the chantix.,F,36,14  days 1X D,2/15/2010,Chantix
169, 1, smoking cessation,It took one month of ingesting this drug before I quit smoking entirely. The side effects while taking Chantix were: Loss of sense of pleasure from ANY activity!: Very Vivid dreams_ (often unpleasant but not like nightmares); and constant insatiable cravings for carbs.  The nightmare was the withdrawal from Chantix! I experienced mood changes on the order of 5 times that of my worse PMS episodes!  I had never before had issues with RAGE_ but within 5 days after beginning to wean off of Chantix those issues began. It has now been more than a year since I slowly weaned myself off of this drug and I have not yet returned to my baseline frustration/ irritation/ stress tolerance level.  Also I have not regained a sense of pleasure from ANY activity. I feel doomed. On top of that_ after all this time_ I still have almost irresistable cravings when I see a cigarette.,I gained more than 30 lbs and became diagnosed with diabetes type II.  If I could go back in time I would NOT take Chantix.

Am now on anti-depressant and anti-anxiety meds. It was VERY terrifying experience. No previous history of either. Can assist in stopping smoking_ but is not magic pill.

171, 1, Quit Smoking,Two days after stopping Chantix I exhibited extremely erratic behavior including hallucinations_ anger_ aggression_ panic_ anxiety and confusion.  It was so bad_ I was taken by an ambulance in restraints to the Emergency room.  I was transferred to a psychiatric unit where I spent 5 days with people with serious Mental Health Disorders from Schizophrenia to Bipolar to recent suicide attempts.  At the same time_ they were doing medical tests on me to confirm I did not have any more serious brain disorders such as MRIs_ Cat Scans_ EEGs_ etc. After several follow up visits with my Primary Care Physician and a Psychiatrist_ my official diagnosis is now a Substance Induced Psychotic Disorder.  I have no history of depression or other mental health problems.  They believe the psychotic episode is a result of STOPPING the Chantix and subsequent anxiety is due to the events from being institutionalized. ,Do NOT take this drug.  The trade off is not worth it_ even if you do quit smoking.  Find another way to quit.  It's been 30 days since my release from the hospital and I'm not back to normal.

I am concerned about the reports of long term personality changes.  I quit by taking Zyban about 10 years ago.

178, 5, Smoking cessation,Nausea_ some irritability_ strange dreams.,Wow... this stuff is amazing. I have quit twice before; once with with patches and Wellbutrin and once (a sheer fluke) cold turkey. This last attempt has been months and months of struggle_ until Chantix. To be honest_ I didn't even feel 100% ready to quit when I started taking it... I was pretty bitter about the whole thing. The wonderful thing (compared to Wellbutrin) is that cigarettes still tasted good the first week... with Wellbutrin they tasted bad_ which made me not want to take the medication. After a few days on Chantix_ I didn't even notice I'd cut down from 1 to 1/2 a pack.

180, 3, Quit Smoking,This medication definitely helped me quit.  I was amazed but 4 or 5 weeks into it I began having paranoi and auditory hallucinations.  Subsequently I was hospitalized for 2 weeks.  Haloperidol eliminated symptons immediately and I felt fine then put on Geodon which had even worse symptoms than paranoia itself.,I would recommend Chantix with caution to ensure psychiatric side effects are closely watched.  It worked for me but unfortunately the side effects will preven me from using it in the future.  Here's to going cold turkey.,M,29,3  days,10/26/2009,Chantix

Tapered down and stopped taking it due to psychiatric side effects.  Had pretty bad shortness of breath  for about 2 weeks after stopping chantix.  Would not recommend to those who have underlying depression or anger issues etc. Unfortunately started smoking again.

I got detached and took an I do not care attitude most of the time.Had to actually take a nap of 20 min at work...I did not gain but about 2 pounds while on CHantix. When I tapered down_ I exploded by 30 pounds. Still worth it... Working out now,Do not stop abruptly. I had uncontrollable rage. I went back to 2 mg per day and tapered to 1 then none and I survived. I still do not smoke. It works_ but be very careful. Notify family and friends to watch you all the time for strange behavior. Do not drink on Chantix.,M,51,3  months,10/23/2009,Chantix

Yesterday was a full year not smoking :-)) It worked like an antidepressant for me & aside from a little nausea if I took the pill without eating I had no side effects. It completely took away all desire & satisfaction from cigarettes. This stuff saved my life. I smoked for 36 yrs and quit after 8 days on Chantix. I took Chantix another 6 wks and then just quit taking it.

185, 1, to quit smoking,an increased desire to smoke,I was told that this drug (which here in Canada is called Champix_ don't ask why; I am talking about the drug whose generic name is varenicline) would react with my dopamine receptors_ the ones activated by nicotine_ in such away as to give me the satisfaction I got from smoking; and that_ at the same time_it would_ if I smoked_ prevent the nicotine from getting to those receptors. Made sense. Didn't work. Yes_ it did in fact prevent nicotine from getting through_ yetit absolutely did not in any way give me the satisfaction I got from smoking. As a result_ I smoked more and more attempting to get a nicotine hit. I quit the medication after 1 day; but it seems to have done something permanent_ or at least long term: i.e._ it seems to have reset my daily nicotine need level_ so thatI am now after many months smoking on average 11.5 cigarettes daily_ whereas before I was smoking 8 daily.

187, 5, stop smoking,mild/short nausea_ EXTREMELY CRAZY DREAMS_ blah feeling,"THIS DRUG WORKS EXACTLY LIKE IT SHOULD.  If you are pondering the thought of taking this drug--you will stop smoking.  The best analogy is that smoking a cig tastes like you are breathing in campfire smoke.  It's as if the ""idea"" of smoking is gross.  I stopped smoking after day 4.  I'm a 28 year old guy.  Up until I started taking this drug_ I would have an occasional (once every month or so) dream that I could only remember foggy parts of--if at all.  After I started taking this drug_ I would wake up tired--thinking that I have pulled an all-nighter!!!  These dreams you have...  I still remember every detail of every thing--just as if I were there.  Some are very nice_ some not so much.  I think that this side effect puts one ""out of cycle"" for lack of better terminology.  Besides the dreams_ I experienced a little discomfort for the first 20 minutes upon taking a pill-like I want to yack all over the place.  I recommend taking the pill with some food_ and possibly lay low for the next 20 mins.  It helps a lot.  Also_ little things at work and at home (with my roommate) would send me over the edge (i.e. extremely short fused and crabby).  I'm generally a very happy go lucky person.  I can not say this was from this drug_ but it is_ at the least_ a coincidence.  Bottom line:  it's worth it. Yeah_ life may be a little rough for 2 weeks_ but_ you stop smoking_ slowly stop taking the drug_ and life goes back to normal without cigs!!",M,28,14  days,8/28/2009Email,Chantix

I use them as a crutch for frequent hard-core dieting (1200 calories per day). Taking this pill for 5 days ruined everything I like about myself. Even with the 1200 cals/day_ I gained weight. My stomach_ in the mirror_ looked like I had swallowed a whole watermelon (NOT OK FOR ME). I couldn't poop_ I couldn't sleep (when I did I felt like I had just lived an entire week in a dreamland)_ and I consistantly freaked out over nothing. This drug made me second guess everything and fight against myself to prevent my own happiness. I wanted to work out but couldn't get off the couch.

191, 5, quit smoking,The usual - nausea_ nasty/stinky/rotten/foul gas_ vivid dreams_ blurred vision.,This is my second ride on the Chantix-go-round.  The 1st time I quit on the 8th day and stayed butt-free for 7 months.  I fell off the butt wagon when I went on a family cruise and drank way too much.  I thought i could handle just smoking 4-5 a day_ but within 1 month was right back up to 1-1/2 packs per day.  The second time around_ quitting was just as easy on the 8th day_ but now I know that I cannot even smoke just 1 butt.  I truly believe that nicotine addiction is as bad or worse than a heroin dependency.  This truly is a great drug for smoking cessation.  Also_ when done with the 3 month supply_ I plan on slowly weaning myself off the chantix due to a rage incident coming off it the first time.  I would also like to start a Chantix Dream blog website for people to share the crazy ass dreams related to the use of Chantix.

After I stopped Chantix_ however_ and my body got used to not having 2 pills a day_ I have been plagued by a dreamlike_ out-of-sync feeling.  At my best_ I only feel slightly out-of-sync; at my worst_ it feels very much like having a beer on a half-empty stomach.  My eyesight has also appeared to suffer_ as focusing takes considerably more focus (!) than before.All things considered_ I really wish I would have gone another route.  I like not smoking_ but I have replaced a habit with being fat_ blind and stupid.

My husband also taking the tabs also seems to be always angry/aggressive.,"I am now 3 wks smoke free_ but quit the tabs 3 days ago. I found giving up smoking very easy on this medication(remarkable after 25 years smoking_ around 50/day for many of them). I have found that I am unable to function properly (everything seems just off normal) and have been sinking deeper into negativity and depression. Painful bloating and foul smelling constant flatulance is still a problem even though I am no longer taking the tabs. I am yet to shake the negative feelings_ and the ""dampened"" perception. Luckily I do not drink_ so I have no feedback on the effect of alcohol for me. I have a wonderful marriage and two beautiful kids_ but have found myself having negative thoughts ie ""why do I bother""_ though not suicidal. I immediately stopped the tablets but am still working through these feelings. Please note that I am proud that I have stopped smoking and fully intend continue with quiting. I am not feeling depressed about the loss of the cigs_ and the tabs have helped me kick them easily. I would think that if depression is related to withdrawal_ a component of that would surely be regarding how hard it is to do without your ""fix""???? This drug does the job_ but am concerned about what else it is doing at the same time. So many people state that the side effects of smoking far outweigh those of this drug.

My doc doesn't believe all these symptoms were caused by Chantix_ he's convinced it's just depression. I've had awful abdominal pains and my OB/GYN now wants to remove my ovaries...I NEVER had probs before Chantix. I'm STILL having horrid symptoms; anger_ irritability_ aggressiveness_ detachment then over sensitivity_ paranoia_ anxiety. I'm just a shell of who I used to be_ is there a ""normal"" life after taking this horrid drug? Please_ email me to let me know what's helped you. Thank you!!",F,39,2  months,12/9/2008Email,Chantix
219, 1, smoking cessation,Extreme tiredness. Messed up taste buds. Vivid dreams. Extreme anger and agitation. Gas & heartburn.,The side-effects were bearable until the day I actually decided to quit smoking(day 13) and within 12 hours of stopping I felt so agitated_ and couldn't concentrate on anything to the point where I felt worried that I might do some harm. Within 16 hours of not smoking I was feeling so angry and agitated_ I felt like I was going to explode. I was snapping at people for no reason. I wanted to punch holes in the walls and I felt like I could have killed somebody. I'm not usually agressive. I had a cigarette_ calmed down and threw the pills in the rubbish.,F,37,13  days,11/19/2008,Chantix
220, 5, Quit smoking,None,Chantix is a miracle drug. I was smoking a pack a day for 6 years. I've tried to quit many times cold turkey_ also tried taking nicotine gums but I had no luck. My doctor mentioned Chantix and I accepted it_ and I quit smoking. I would recommend this to everyone out there who wants to quit smoking.,M,24,3  weeks,11/16/2008,Chantix

Had an angry outburst at work_ lost the ability to perform simple tasks_ went to the doctor at the urgency of co-workers.  Was hysterical and in tears for no reason by the time I arrived.  Doctor told me to go off Chantix.  Ended up in ER for paranoid delusions and severe panic attacks the following night.  Have been off Chantix for 2 months and am still having problems with vision_ cognitive function_ memory and anxiety.  I've lost my job_ still can't concentrate and wonder how I'll ever get through the rest of my life_ whick is an absolute hell now.  Used to be a normal_ functing_ happy_ creative_ intelligent person.  I still smoke and will quit cold turkey when I am feeling better.  I've done it before and it was hard for a few days_ but nothing compared to the 2 month hell I've been through after taking Chantix.,F,47,14  days,11/10/2008Email,Chantix
222, 5, Smoking Cessation,Anger and nausea,I cannot say for sure if the Chantix caused the anger issues or if it was just the lack of cigs. I tend to think it was the latter. The nausea happened every day for about 20 minutes right after taking the pill but was not too bad. I was only on the pills for 2 weeks and have been off smokes for 13 weeks now.,F,33,14  days,10/27/2008,Chantix

Blood pressure also dropped too low.,"Called the Pharmacist a few hours after taking my first pill because my feet went numb and that's never happened to me before. Peripheral S.....something is listed as an ""infrequent"" side effect the Pharm. said. Hypotension is also a ""infrequent"" side effect and I got that also. My normally low blood pressure (95/60) went into the 80/50's range and I couldn't think clearly. With the Peripheral S...- I couldn't walk well because my feet were numb. For me_ this drug has to be a 1/5 stars. But_ my Dad and one friend took it with NO side effects (but wild dreams) and they would rate it a 5/5! Both are still not smoking at 6 months and think Chantix is a miracle drug!",M,44,1  days,10/21/2008,Chantix

In fact_ my mood was so good I didn't want to stop taking it! I Slowly tapered off smoking about week 1.5 after that it was fairly easy to quit. By week four I got a bad headache that wouldn't go away with any meds_ had extreme thirst_ spent the night going pee and got bad heart palpitations. I started feeling too strange so I quit the meds and went to the doctor. There_ they did many blood tests and xrays and I had nothing wrong with me. (?) I did notice that one day when my palpitations were really bad I ate a banana and then felt okay. I have a suspicion that Chantix messes with body enzymes and postassium and glucose levels. Too high or low potassium levels result in many of the side effects people are describing. This said_ Chantix helped me quit for sure. I suggest people make the decision to quit and take it for no longer than a month. I often took my Chantix with OTC anti-nausea meds & also vitamin D with magn,F,32,1  months,9/27/2008,Chantix

I have quit in the past (Zyban) and I know how easy it is to get hooked again. This medicine will only help you if you really want to quit. I would still love to have a cigarette_ I don't think that part will ever go away.  Does anyone know how long it takes to get out of your system?

After having been a pack-a-day smoker for over 25 years_ I can't believe that I've been smoke free for 12 days!  I won't kid anyone by telling them that this is the miracle drug_ because you still have the cravings.  They just aren't as bad as going cold turkey.  I know I'm going to make it happen this time!   My only real problem is the severe acid reflux!  I'm not sure if it is from the quitting smoking or from taking the Chantix.  I've discussed with my Gastro doctor_ and he says it's from quitting smoking...  I just hope it gets better soon...

I also had some stomach pains if I did not eat before taking it_ and I could not sleep at night if I took the second dose after 6 p.m.  The dreams were vivid.,I did not seem like myself the entire time I took Chantix.  I could not think clearly and making decisions was very difficult for me.  It seems like I was either laughing or crying most of the day.  My husband_ who is also a smoker and still smokes_ was NOT happy with me but I was determined to make it work.  And you know what?  It did!  I stopped smoking after 37 years.  I can't say it was easy but I was amazed at how quickly my craving for nicotine went away.  Since I was such a long-time smoker_ my doctor suggested I stay on the med. for 6 months but I stopped after three months.  Actually I weaned myself off the p.m. dose after 6 weeks.  The most difficult part was breaking habits_ and I just took those one at a time.  Chantix may not be for everyone but it worked for me.,F,55,12  weeks,5/26/2008,Chantix

Not only do the dreams blur your reality but after numerous nights of restless sleep you can become quite depressed.  My doctor never warned me about the effects of alcohol when using this drug - when I drank while on the medication_ I became quite aggressive which is not in my nature.  The constant headaches and lack of ability to focus have not fully gone away after being off the drug for 3 months.  The 2 months I was on the drug_ I could not accomplish any tasks (which is pretty serious considering I am in law school)_ could not focus_ became extremely moody and sullen.  I think if you are prone to any type of depression you should stay away from this drug!

I went off it_ and now after not taking two of the pills I have anger like I have never had before.  This med worked great to help me quit smoking_ but it is not worth the mental side effects from it.  If you are looking to start the med_ do research ahead of time.  Anxiety is one of the side effects they don't list (it's buried in the literature) and from the research I have found there are over 55 suicides linked to it.,F,34,15  days,12/27/2007Email,Chantix
264, 5, Quit smoking,vivid dreams_ mild gas,This is a miracle drug. It made quitting smoking extremely easy. My husband who was a very heavy smoker also quit. It feels great to not be controlled by our smoking habit. The major side effect for me is the vivid dreams. I feel like I go on an adventure every night. They are actually kind of interesting. No nightmares. I would suggest this drug to anyone who really wants to quit smoking.,F,52,5  weeks,12/20/2007,Chantix
265, 5, To quit smoking,Heinous_ paint-peeling gas!!!! Thankfully this stopped by the end of the 2nd month. I remember bloating being a big problem from quitting in the past_ but this is something else.,This medicine was a lifesaver for me_ literally. I tried to quit smoking 4 or 5 times before this and never could. I'm now almost 4 months ciggie-free. The only problem is that the cravings return a bit once you stop the medication_ so far they are no where near the past cravings_ though.,F,33,3  months,12/18/2007,Chantix

267, 3, Quit Smoking,Nauseau immediately after taken pill_ but subsides.  Strange life like dreams.  Depression? Trouble sleeping?  Impatience?  Utter confusion now!,I really have no idea what Chantix is doing anymore.  Here's the situation.  I started it back in June.  After first week_ was able to quit completely.  I felt so good about it.  Didn't like the weight gain but that was the only thing I really noticed as a down side.  I took it for the full 12 week cycle_ though I did switch to just one pill a day with the last few weeks_ cause I was nervous to not be on it.  Anyway_ a few weeks after not being on it I was a terrible mess.  Couldn't stop crying_ completely hopeless feeling_ mad at everything_ no energy...bad!  Naturally_ this caused me to start smoking again.  Dr. also put me on lexapro to combat the depression.  I smoked for about 3 full weeks and then since I was feeling much better (no longer depressed) I decided to start Chantix again_ in order to get back off the cigarettes.  This has been for about a month now and unlike the first time_ I still have a smoke or two but have considerably cut back (I think I had maybe 4 yesterday).,F,31,4  months,11/29/2007Email,Chantix

I have a call into my doctor leaving a message that this drug isn't worth stroking out over for me_ going cold turkey,I had cut way back on my smoking (from 2+ packs a day to 1/2) a month prior to starting chantix. I have always had sensitivities to many prescription drugs_ been hospitalized tool many times to count due to corporate pharma miracle drugs.I quit for 2 years almost 20 years ago cold turkey and left a message with my doc that I'm going to attempt cold turkey again I'm glad that these designer drugs work for some people. I do not trust big pharma at all_ we're nothing but a bunch of lab rats for their bottom lines,M,60,7  days,11/13/2007,Chantix
270, 2, smoking cessation,really bad gas_ constipation_ depression_ and some nausea_ aggression and vivid dreams_ tremors,It did not take long to notice the difference - I did not crave cigarettes as much but the bad gas and bloating started soon after beginning the medication and never went away. The constipation and vivid dreams started after about a week. The nausea did too but it was infrequent. The worse was the depression_ agressive outburst toward my family_ the tremors and the bloated gassy feeling. I could not continue with this medication another month. This was the last aid for quitting I had not tried. Any suggestions?,F,43,1  months,11/13/2007,Chantix

Quit once for four months with patches_ but couldn't do it again. Have tried everything again and nothing worked. Neither did Chantix the first round I tried. But decided to try again the next month and cigarettes began tasting horrible this time (I had to use the 1 mg. tablets twice a day). Am now smoke-free for 2 and a half weeks.

The side effects are so bad that I'm stopping this medication as of the date of this post: 10/22/2007.

I don't recommended it. Best luck to everyone trying to quit_ first try cold turkey quit_ I'll start that tomorrow. ;-),M,37,7  days,10/22/2007Email,Chantix
274, 5, Quit Smoking,Very out of it and foggy the first 5 days. Sharp but very brief nausea right after taking pill. After 1st week_ nausea is gone. During 1st week_ you can smoke_ but I would get nauseaous smoking as if my body was all-out rejecting it. I welcomed that feeling 100%,Love it. I have been smoking for 12 years. I am almost finished 2nd week and quitting wasn't nearly as big an issue as I thought it would be. I have tried nicorette in the past paired with vigorous exercise. I was then addicted to nicorette for almost a year after...and ended up smoking with it in the end. Because this blocks the cravings_ it's 10x more effective. I am motivated and happy to quit...it's actually a true joy!! Also_ an important side-note: has 100% taken away ANY cravings for ALCOHOL as well! My advice to you is drink very little or not at all on this medication. This medication is unbelievable and I pray to God that it's truly safe.,F,29,12  days,10/17/2007,Chantix
275, 1, To Quit Smoking,Nausea_ Bad Headaches & dizzyness from day one.  By the third day I could not function due to the dizzyness_ balance problems  and overall ill feeling.  I just wanted to feel normal again and not so foggy and depressed.  Overslept every day!,By day 5 after taking the morning pill I decided enough was enough!  I felt so bad I knew I had to get off this stuff!  It took a good 48 hours after stopping for the headaches and dizzyness to go away.  RELIEF!  Never even made it to my quit date!  I am very disappointed in my experience with this drug as I was hoping it would help me - but I will keep trying without it and feel good!,F,46,5  days,10/16/2007Email,Chantix
276, 5, To Stop Smoking,The first week I had minor queasiness a few times_ but since then have had no side effects.  Have been on Chantix now for almost 6 weeks.,I had tried everything to quit smoking and knew it was going to take something pretty powerful for me to quit completely.  I always had the awful jitters and cravings that would drive me crazy.  With Chantix I had none of those!  I am almost 6 weeks smoke-free and can't believe how easy it was.  I smoked the first week_ tapered down the second and was then completely done.  This is something I've wanted to do for years and Chantix made that possible for me.  I heard about the musicians death being blamed on Chantix.  From what I understand_ drinking alcohol while on Chantix can cause this sort of aggressive behavior and since I don't drink_ have not had that problem.  Have not even had the vivid dreams that so many talk about.,F,55,6  weeks,10/4/2007Email,Chantix

He was NEVER violent towards anyone.  He had a very calm smile and magnetic personality.  He never even joked about violence_ much less acted out violently in any way.  In the music business he was a joy to work with - fun to watch with no musical arrogance on stage or in studio.I'm not here to preach or tell ANYONE what to take and/or not take.

He didn't have a violent bone in his body.  Very calm_ reserved_ talented_ always smiling w/a dry sense of humor...but he had a bad_ unexpected chemical reaction that changed all of that.  I'm not here to preach or to tell anyone what to take or not take.   Just please be VERY careful and communicate with others (family_ etc.) when you are using this drug.

280, 1, Stop Smoking,1. Sickness on taking 2. After 21 days of taking I developed a feeling of increasing detachment and worry from events under circumstances in the day..3. When mixed with alcohol(not excessive)the effects are explosive; I turned loud_ verbally and physically aggressive breaking super strong window glass to get back into our home_ and had an incident where I should have been restrained.Only the actions of my family stopped me.,I dont want to smoke_ great. That worked but on the way I've damaged family relationships. I've now stopped the Champix (!) and am seeking medical help.

Started to feel moody_ a bit depressed_ on edge all the time and just not quite me_ so I've cut the tablets down to 1 a day_ feeling a little better but want to stop them altogether soon. Also feel tired_ lethargic - so want to feel normal again but as a non-smoker :) I'd definitely recommend this to others who feel they need help with stopping smoking.,F,42,55  days,8/30/2007,Chantix
284, 5, Stop smoking (COPD diagnosis),Strange but rather interesting dreams.  Awake briefly several times at night.,"I smoked for about 45 years_ was hospitalized for 5 days in late May 2007 and was diagnosed with severe COPD (emphysema). I'm now on oxygen 24/7.  Chantix was begun immediately at the hospital. I've had only 1 cigarette since then (a conscious decision to have one final one and say goodbye to smoking forever - what they call ""closure"" I guess). I had tried to quit before many times by cutting back_ going cold turkey and by using the patch and the gum - nothing worked.  With  Chantix I still thought about having a cigarette (and still think about it less often) but the overpowering cravings stopped immediately.  From my point of view_ a true miracle drug which I continue to take.  I'd give it a higher rating than 5 if I could.  Trust me_ you don't want emphysema - put up with the side effects and stop smoking.",M,61,90  days,8/29/2007,Chantix

It was day six before I noticed I wasn't getting 100% from my smokes and took that as the pills starting to work and quit the next day.,This is the best pill on the market to date. It will take away 90% of the work for you. (It helps that you want to quit!) Stopping chantix I had some mild but manageable cravings. You can always go back on it longer if you find it not easy enough for you. Don't rush getting off the meds.

I quit smoking 5 weeks ago after being on Chantix for about 3 weeks.  I tapered off until I simply had no desire to smoke any longer.  Quitting smoking is the single best thing that I could have done for my health_ and I owe my ability to quit to Chantix.  Having said that_ I wish I would have been better prepared for the side effects.  I finally had to stop taking Chantix because it was just affecting me too bad.

Ended up staying on the medication 6 weeks_ only stayed at max dose for 2 weeks but could not take side effects.  First reduced to 1/2 mg_ twice a day_ then 1/2 mg once a day.  Then stopped taking it.  Nausea got really bad at highest dose.  Gained weight because I ate more to quell the nausea.  Tried always to take on full stomach but sickness continued.  But I did succeed in quitting smoking and desire did not return after discontinuing chantix.  Definitely worth it for that.,F,45,6  weeks,8/5/2007,Chantix

Particularly replacement therapies for an addiction_ however_ chantix thus far has exceeded my expectations. The side effects are minimal and withing two weeks I was barely thinking about cigarettes at all. As a partial agonist to those same receptors_ the chantix essentially removes the physical craving over time. I'm giving this drug high marks_ because of how easy it has made quitting this time around. I do however want to see what the discontinuation process is like. I haven't heard as much data on that. This stuff really shocked me in a good way.,M,37,5  weeks,4/24/2007,Chantix
