0, 5, High Blood Pressure,Vivid dreams_ a little nausea,It took only 2 weeks for me to stop 37 years of smoking cigarettes. The 2nd week I felt like I could take on the world because I wanted to quit! Chantix helped me to overcome the will to smoke by taking away the urge for nicotine / smoking a cigarette feeling. My lungs had been cleaned for 10 years. I haven't looked back either!!,F,63,3  weeks30 1X D,8/6/2016Email,Chantix

2, 5, I was ready to quit smoking,Vivid dreams.  It was well worth it.,I tried Chantix 3 different times.  I was finally successful! The main thing is not to stop taking it until you know you are strong enough. That was the problem with the other 2 times_ I thought I was okay after 3 months_ and I wasn't.  You never know when the craving will hit you.,F,47,4  months 1X D,7/11/2016Email,Chantix
3, 5, Quit smoking,Let me start by saying that I have PTSD from the military and have had problems with nightmares and depression for years. I have not noticed a change in my depression or bad dreams since starting chantix. This is a miracle drug for smokers and nicotine addicts. It stopped my urge to smoke by probably 90+ percent. You still have to have some will power and a desire to quit smoking. I have tried the patch_ the gum_ vapIng and cold turkey. Nothing else in the market can hold a candle to this pill. I am thoroughly impressed and am on my 3rd day of no nicotine and feel completely fine. I've read so many reviews that people are having severe depression and nightmares on this medication but I deal with this anyway Anderson  I have not had an increase or change in mood or nightmares. I just watched my father pass away 3 months ago due to COPD from smoking. He was 74 years old and would have been perfectly healthy aside from his lung problems from smoking. He had quit smoking when he was 69 but the damage was already done and we watched him slowly get worse and worse every year. I recommend anyone who is having a hard time quitting reevaluate whether they want to deal with a few weeks or months of depression and nightmares or years of breathing treatments_ steroids_ oxygen machines and movement restrictions. This medicine is nothing short of a miracle drug and I can't possibly be more impressed by how easily I quit. Weigh the consequences before you decide to stop taking no this med,,M,32,3  weeks,7/11/2016Email,Chantix
4, 1, To quit smoking,Extreme rage and depression_ extreme suicidal thoughts_ extreme dreams such as my husband having a girlfriend and me seperating her brain stem from her spinal cord with a ROCK,I don't know why this crap is still on the market.  Several weeks off and still very irritable and depressed_ despite antidepressants.  Also went back to smoking because of the rage and depression_ so I know it's not nicotine withdrawal.,F,48,30  days 2X D,7/7/2016Email,Chantix

I have gained like 10 pounds and I have only taken Chantix for 19 days.  My eating habits have not changed at all.,I am not smoking as much_ but cannot seem to lay it down completely.  I have tried Chantix before and after about 1 week of taking it the cigarettes tasted horrible.  I don't have that this time.  I am extremely frustrated about the weight gain.  I have hypothyroid so I am already battling my weight.  That discourages me greatly.

9, 3, Quit Smoking,Severe nausea (if not completely full)_ tired_ agitated_ vivid dreams_ lack of energy_ severe taste/smell tainting_loss of appetite and small weight gain,In the beginning with the .5 mg I felt like I was on strong Valium. After a couple days and into the higher dosage very few tastes and smells were unaffected. Beef tasted rotten and sweets all taste odd. Most of what I like tastes different and unappealing so I force food down with little enjoyment. Mild but controllable agitation for brief time periods. Always sleepy. No energy. I force myself to get things done. Brief feelings of depression which are controllable. The dreams are interesting and weird but not scarey. (Only thing I like). I have cut back smoking by half on work days but don't find a lot of difference on days off when it's easier. Wish it would make them taste as bad as food. Had to cut out morning dose. Nausea preventing me from getting ready for work. Calming without a CIG? Yes. Miracle drug? No. Going to keep on it trying though. My last hope.,F,55,1  months1 mg 2x da,5/16/2016Email,Chantix
10, 5, To quit smoking,Crazy_ (but not bad) Vivid dreams. Mild nausea. Body aches. Irritability. Food tastes more distinct making me very picky at what I eat and not wanting 80% of what I normally would eat. Smell of tobacco is horrible now. Mild depression. Trouble sleeping at times. And moderate sensitivity to light. Severe stomach pain if taken on an empty stomach.,Ok_ Continued to smoke about 1-1/4 packs (about 25) mini cigars a day for about the first week on chantix_ when I went to the full dose_ after 3 days_ (day 10) I dropped to about a half a pack. 5 days ago_ 1 day after my planned quit day_ I just couldn't handle smoking anymore and quit. 4 days ago_ I quit having any negligeable cravings altogether. I smoked for 6 years and tried everything to quit_ weaning_ cold turkey_ niccotine patches and gum_ chewing tobacco_ even zyban (wellbutrin_ buopropin) nothing worked or even slowed me down from 1+packs a day. Then I tried Chantix and it's been amazing for me. The side effects are worth it for me to be smoke free_ hands down. After day 3 on chantix_ I did start to notice a gradual dislike for smoking until they were so nasty_ I couldn't even stomach the thought of smoking anymore_ then I quit_ and have almost forgotten what it is like to smoke. Truly amazing!,M,32,3  weeks2x1mg dail,5/5/2016Email,Chantix
11, 5, Stop smoking,Nausea_ weird dreams_ headaches occasionally_ trouble sleeping,I started on the starter pack and worked up to the full dose. The first few days were hard with nausea_ sleeping patterns getting messed up and weird dreams. I was concerned being on bipolar and adhd medication because of the warning with that diagnosis_ but I actually wonder if it helped curb the moody side effect people report_ as I am very stable on my meds. After a few days the nausea stopped_ as I found you definitely have to take it with food and eat small snacks with substance through out the day. (at least it helped me). The side effects I experienced were worth being smoke free now. I did not take the medication for the full 12 weeks because I had bar crawl one weekend and was nervous as it warns not to take with alcohol. But it turned out ok and still have no desire to smoke.,F,32,6  weeks 2X D,4/19/2016,Chantix

15, 3, To quit smoking,Nausea_ constipation_ gas_ irritability_ painful bloating_ lower abdominal cramps_ and diarrhea,i began taking Chantix as a 1 1/2 - 2 pack a day smoker. On the advice of my physician_ I began trying to cut back prior to my Chantix start date and within my first couple of weeks on Chantix. I was pleased with my progress and_ around the third week on Chantix_ I smoked my last cigarette. I did have some minor constipation and gas within that first three weeks and nausea when I took my morning dose (always with an 8oz glass of water and a small breakfast). Toward the end of my sixth week on Chantix is when the abdominal cramps began which was followed by diarrhea and bloating that would wake me right out of a sound sleep. The smells coming out of my body were otherworldly. After 6 days of not wanting to move because of the cramps and the pain and the nearly constant diarrhea_ I decided to stop taking Chantix. It's only been a day since my last dose so it's too soon to tell how long this might go on.,M,43,6  weeks1 MG 2X D,3/22/2016,Chantix

27, 4, To quit smoking,Vivid dreams_ extreme irritability_ anger_ overall hatred for humanity,I quit with Chantix 4 years ago. Then my fiance? started smoking (he harassed me to quit so when he started_ I started again). I don't remember the side effects then but right now_ I could probably kill. I quit on day 5 of taking Chantix - 3 days of one 0.5mg pill and 2 days of two 0.5mg pills. I don't even WANT to smoke. While my whole family might think I suck right now_ I'm not smoking so it's worth it. This personality change can't last forever_ right?! My only question is...was it okay to just stop taking the Chantix on Day 6? I don't feel like it was long enough to cause problems with not cutting down (since I only increased the initial dose 2 days before quitting). Any ideas?,F,37,6  days0.5 2X D,10/27/2015Email,Chantix

29, 5, Quit smoking/35 years,SEVERE stomach cramping_ cigarettes taste like ash_ mild nausea_ stange dreams_ restlessness.Oh yeah... VIVID Dreams.,I love Chantix because it WORKS. Dont expect much the first 7 days when your on a 1/2 MG. That is how it is supposed to work! The second week when you up your doseage is when you notice how you cant stand the taste. It happens gradual but it does happen. 2 weeks in this morning i woke up with extreme stomach pain. Having a hard time toughing out the work day. BUT... Im not smoking. I actually tossed them out this morning so im not tempted. I do agree with the vivid dreams thing. (Last night I dreamt i responded to a 911 call and some lady was on the floor screaming HE HIT ME IN THE NUTSACK!) Yeah... Weird. It must have something to do with what happens to you during the day because that word is not even in my vocabulary as a female_ but my 15 year old was saying it about his brother that day??

30, 5, To quit smoking,No side effects until after first 7 days when dosage increased to .10 mg. After increasing dose to full .1 mg_ within 45/60 seconds I had a terrible_ deep stomach pain that would double me over. The cramping/pain lasted about 30 seconds_ then would stop. 30 seconds doesn't sound very long_ but rest assured 30 seconds can be very long when you're enduring pain so deep there is nothing in your consciousness but pain.I had been taking Chantix when I woke up in the mornings on an empty stomach because I'm not a breakfast eater_ never have been. So_ I started eating a FULL breakfast and that helped quell the pain to a point I could get through the 30 seconds - but the cramping still happened. Therefore. I didn't stay on Chantix very long - about 2 more weeks.But_ it truly did help and I was extremely grateful that it wasn't a nicotine substitute - it truly removed the pleasure so I could break my addiction to nicotine.The stomach cramping was hideous - that was the impetus for me to g,,F,55,21  days.05 mg 1X D,10/3/2015Email,Chantix

32, 4, Quit smoking,This is my third time taking this drug and a completely different experience than the last two. I have a very short fuse_ anger_ aggression_ even going into a rage a few times_ insomnia_ anxiety_ headaches.,I'm exhausted. Haven't slept more than a couple hours at a time in a month. I am 23 days tobacco free. I also have no desire to have my normal glass or two of wine at night. Consequently_ I am also 23 days alcohol free. I'm in a stressful time in my life and all the side effects are amplified because of this I think. I am very anxious at times. The anger and aggression have sent me into a rage a few times though provoked. Does anyone have numbness in their extremities? I started having it while on the Chantix last year. I thought I had a stroke so I discontinued the drug. After an MRI showing no evidence of having had a stroke_ I started it again last month. The numbness seems to be getting worse.Mostly because of the anger and rages_ I have decided to take only half a dose and see how that goes. I started yesterday morning. There is no difference thus far but I will keep you posted.,F,53,30  days1 mg 2X D,8/3/2015Email,Chantix

45, 5, To quit smoking,My quit date was December 10th_ 2015 and I can honestly say that I have not had a cigarette since then.  I have experienced strange dreams and a few nightmares_ but nothing that has caused me concern.  I do experience nausea with each dose for about 1 hour after taking the medication.  I completed the 90 days @2/day and am weaning off now_ taking 1 per day.  I also have experienced mild headaches although this isn't everyday.  I have noticed a diminished sex drive but I am sure this will improve once I no longer take the medication.,This is my second time taking Chantix.  I took it 1.5 years ago and quit smoking for 6 months.  I made the mistake of thinking I could have just one cigarette and it resulted in me smoking 1ppd again in no time.  This time I know that just like any other addiction there is no controlling it or managing it_ there is only abstaining from it completely.  My husband is still smoking and now he wants to quit as well.  I am hopeful that he will_ I really hate the smell of cigarettes now.  He can't take Chantix_ his profession won't allow him to take this medication.  For the first time in almost 20 years I can breathe!!!  I can smell and taste and I am not coughing all the time.  I feel amazing.  I am thankful that I haven't experienced the horrific side effects that some have endured.

I started getting huge headaches and neck pain which is why I stopped taking it. It really does work though.,My husband also is taking it and i have noticed that his sex drive has almost diminished. He is normally a very compassionate person and since the chantix he acts as if he doesn't care about much. We've both smoked for the last 20 years and doing it together has helped keep us from starting up but I hope the personality change in him isn't permanent.,F,38,30  days 1X D,2/8/2015Email,Chantix
47, 4, Stop Smoking,Initially nausea with stomach cramps_ constipation_ insomnia_ irritable_ anxiety_ uneasy feeling_ vivid dreams. These all faded for me by third week (but I think you need to be pro-active & patient with the side effects). As the side effects became more manageable_ I was willing to stick it out further.,I've been a pack a day smoker for about 14 years. My first week I still smoked_ by end of the week_ I had cut back dramatically_ by my 10th day I was done and am almost a month without a cigarette. I still had a few cravings here & there_ definitely had to fight through the habit desires_ but it was much easier to do with Chantix. Side effects were rough in the beginning. I had awful insomnia (up 36+ hrs many times). Luckily I work nights so I could sleep during the day_ I honestly don't know what I would have done if I had to be to work normal day/office hours with the insomnia that was happening. I had terrible constipation. I was pretty miserable there for a couple of weeks. I had uneasy / anxiety feeling shortly after taking each pill. I only had nausea or cramping if I didn't eat before AND take with a full glass of water.  I had vivid dreams_ some weird ones but nothing awful_ just very real. I was irritable & snappy but no more than if I quit any other way. All in all_ as long as I don't have any long term side effects_ I couldn't be happier with my choice to stick it out with Chantix.  My boyfriend and I both decided to quit at the same time. He refused to try Chantix because of the side effect horror stories he'd heard. He's still smoking but I think he's starting to consider Chantix after seeing my much easier success with it.,F,34,1  months1mg / day,2/8/2015,Chantix

51, 1, Stop smoking,Depression_ anger_ crying spells_ nightmares_ joint pain_ feels like mouth cut up with glass.,I quit taking this medication today as the side effects are not worth it. I am a happy person who loves life. This last week I have been miserable. As I write this I am sitting here having a crying spell for no reason at all. I am sad_ depressed and don't want to do anything. I looked in my fridge tonight and noticed it was empty as I just haven't felt like going to the store for the past week. I have neglectedy family and I sure do hope these side effects go away quick. I want to be the happy person I used to be again.,F,44,10  days,1/9/2015Email,Chantix

53, 5, Quit smoking,Sometimes I had nightmares.  I actually woke up in tears crying because of how real they were.  But a few little bad dreams are completely worth not being a smoker anymore.  I had used Chantix a few years back with success_ but for some dumb reason I decided to smoke again after two years.  I'm quit again this time for good.,,M,40,60  days.5 2X D,12/30/2014Email,Chantix
54, 1, Stop smoking,Extreme anger_ aggression_ total personality change.,I have smoked for 30+ years hoping this would help. My wife is newly diagnosed with asthma. I was hoping this could help me quit but tonight my wife threatened to leave because of the raging anger. I love her and this medication isn't wotth losing her. I would rather step outside to smoke than let this drug ruin my marriage!,M,56,6  days,12/30/2014,Chantix
55, 5, to stop smoking,Vivid dreams. I have been sleeping so much better though and I've set my alarm for later and that has been good.  Mild constipation_ but tolerable.,I've smoked 30 years.  I am not one to set a goal and stick with it.  Chantix changed that for me.   Took the pills for 2 weeks and then quit.   Tobacco free now for 18 days.   It was very difficult at the beginning_ but focusing on quitting this time_ combined with Chantix and using the GETQUIT online program daily has helped so much.   I was sad and depressed for a bit_ but I don't think it was due to Chantix_ it was more in grieving and saying goodbye to a habit I had for a very long time.   It isn't a magic pill that makes you quit_ but that pill along with just a little bit of desire to quit really works!  I'm very pleased with the results.,M,54,38  days 2X D,12/11/2014Email,Chantix

58, 5, Stop smoking,Dreams are really the only thing other than not wanting a cig since it will taste awful - and less desire to smoke. It is working.I am highly happy as is my family.First used a 2nd month patch during my first week - since I became angry when I was smoking that chantix wouldn't allow me to get nicotine. Otherwise I'm weaning off the patches too. I haven't had a desire to buy more cigs- which is great.,,F,37,7  days1 mg,9/12/2014,Chantix
