0, 4, Ankylosing Spondylitis,Occasional dizziness_ almost feel hung over_ but without drinking. Don't know if it's the Enbrel_ or just getting used to not being on ibuprofen all the time. Skin doesn't seem as healthy as before_ zits don't heal as fast.,I am doing things I couldn't do before. Driving long distances_ lifting objects_ strenuous yard work. I've even stopped taking drops for my recurrent iritis. The Enbrel is working great at stopping the AS. However_ I don't feel physically at the top of my game_ and I don't know why.,M,54,3  months50mg 1X W,8/12/2016,Enbrel

2, 3, RA,Diagnosed with RA 8 months ago.  Started with Xeljanz but worked well for 3 months only. I followed a strict diet of eating only good foods for like leafy vegetable_deep sea fish and fruits.  Took 3 caps turmeric daily_ Kefir and  accupuncture. Actually_ before I started with embrel my ESR was down to 35 from 39. I Just had 2 shots of embrel 25mg so I don't see the difference yet. I refrained from Salt_ sugar_ red meats_ preserve meats and all foods bad for RA. I did my own research_ doctors are maybe busy to guide patients on this but really all these help.

4, 4, RA,Extreme tiredness and lethargy that comes and goes. Feelings of depression when tired. Sinus infections that are manageable.,I use Enbrel with Methotrexate. I didn't want to commence with either of these drugs_ as I have avoided drugs all my adult life. However after reading all the literature available to me_ I did commence and the pain of RA has diminished. I still suffer flare ups and have minor side effects from the drugs (others seem to suffer more so). At this stage all going ok,F,47,18  months50mg 1X W,5/22/2016,Enbrel
5, 1, RA PAIN AND DEFORMITY OF JOINTS,It has helped the pain but the rash and starts immediately after injection have tried everything but always get a rash that lasts 2 to 3 weeks.  Call Embrel and they are no help the nurses just read the instructions to me.  Well I know how to read_ I want to know why the rashes and why do they take so long to clear.  The HELL with what Embrel states;  if you have a skin reaction it will clear up in 3 to 7 days_ in reality it clears up in 5 to 8 weeks.,They could have better nurses that actually have experience in doing injections.  And are able to give rational and informed communication.,F,70,2  months50 1X W,5/12/2016,Enbrel

8, 1, Rheumatoid arthritis,Was on Humira for about a year until the sinus infections became so bad I took myself off  dr. suggested Enbrel . Was taking it for about four months  _  my last injection left my leg swollen itchy   Which wasn't a big problem for me  it went away in a few days . It's been probably three weeks since my last injection _ I've called my dr to  find another remedy .  I'm short of breath coughing having night sweats  and just all-around miserable . Biologics just aren't for me ..  Since I've been off the injection I'm feeling very stiff and sore  but I'm also dealing with chest congestion possible lung infection . At this point I'm just afraid of the Biologics .  I can't deal with being deathly ill   99% of the time .,,F,50,3  months,4/7/2016Email,Enbrel
9, 5, Ankylosing Spondylitis,Slow skin healing_ easy discoloration,I had a positive experience with Enbrel from my first injection... No injection-site reactions or other side effects... I experienced noticeable improvement in SI_ neck_ and hip pain after 2 injections_ with continued improvement.  After several months I noticed slower wound healing_ and discoloration after a cut or breakout had healed.  With the reduction in pain_ my stress decreased_ I was able to increase exercise & stretching_ sleep more_ bring inflammation down_ and stop using the Enbtel after a year and a half.  I discontinued using it without tapering- listened to my body_ and stopped when I felt I was ready.  A couple things I found helpful from the beginning: to utilize breathing & relaxation techniques just before & during each injection_ and to inject into a fleshy area of my upper thigh.,F,47,18  months50mg 1X W,3/22/2016,Enbrel
10, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Very slight injection location rash which no longer happens,Was very apprehensive about being told by my Rheumy that my psoriatic arthritis was quite severe and that I should take this drug. I also hated the idea of having to inject myself. However_ since I started taking this drug 4 months ago_ after an initial 4/6 weeks_ the main side effect is that I feel great. The chronic foot and back pain is gone. The muscle pain and general fatigue is also in the past. I didn't realise how badly I was affected by my arthritis until the Enbrel took effect. Time will tell how effective this is and if I get any nasty side effects_ but for now_ this is truly a miracle drug for me.,M,50,4  months50mg 1X W,3/5/2016Email,Enbrel
11, 5, RA,I have an ongoing slight sinus infecton which gets worse if I get a cold. Which is about 2 times a year and I get on antibiotic. Recently I have been getting dizzy and was just wondering if it had something to do with the medication_ that's why I am on this site. Trying to learn the long term effects from your experiences.,I had severe pain in my joints for three 3 years prior to being on Enbrel. It improved the quality of my life.

22, 4, RA,Burning with injections. I prefer prefilled syringes versus the auto inject. I can control how fast to give it to myself. I do get erythema at the injection sites for about 3-4 days after injection. I'm also on Methotrexate injection  weekly. I started about 3 wks ago with a headache to my forehead_ cheeks radiating into my jaws and posterior neck.  These start about 2 days after the injection and lasts about 2-3 days. I notice they start in the evening and cause severe nausea. They kind of knock me down for a while. I have a history of migraine  headaches_  so I initially thought it was the headaches coming back again. After a lot of research _ I now realize it's a side effect of the Enbrel.,I have experienced moderate relief of the pain to my hands and feet.☺ It used to hurt so bad to step on the floor in the mornings_  or to make a fist or hold a pen. Those symptoms have improved and a intermittent. I'm  thankful for the relief I've experienced.  I'm praying the headaches will subside over time and I can continue on Enbrel. I am disappointed with the minimal information on the Amgen website regarding headaches. They don't inform on the severity of these and how debilitating they can be. I'm hanging unto the Enbrel train though_  until theres a need to change. Remember: research_ inquire_ study and learn all you can about your illness. Be sure the info is Reputable!! Arming yourself with knowledge keeps you in control of your body. Prayers and hugs to all.👍💝,F,47,7  weeks50mg 1X W,1/11/2016,Enbrel
23, 5, RA seronegative arthritis,No side effects at all.Just great results. ...,I took RA at in my late 20s.

28, 1, psoriatic arthritis,I really thought I was going to die. I only did 2 injections. My overall condition got worse. I developed rashes that a dermatologist is still trying to figure out. I developed weakness that I never had. I was so sick overall. This is going on two months and I'm wondering if I will ever recover from this. I know these drugs may work for some people but I wish I would have never tried this. One injection of Humira had a similar effect. I have decided that I will not take anything that supresses the immune system ever again including steroids. I will do as much as I can naturally. This was very dangerous for me. I believe I may have had an underlying condition and Enbrel made it worse by lowering immunity. I am interested if anyone knows how to recover from this.,,M,46,2  weeks50mg,11/27/2015Email,Enbrel
29, 3, RA,My Rheumy doubled the Enbrel doze to 100mg weekly because of pain_ then l  developed  severe heart burn ( too long a story to get into but missed 6 weeks of work) which resulted in long term issue. Now must take life long low dose old fashioned anti depressant for heartburn issue.Recently caught severe virus with flu like symptoms_ severe cough_ bronchitis then sinus infection_ my first. I assume with a weakened and supressed immune system if I continue taking Enbrel I'll continue to get sick and just can not afford this pattern. Not sure I want to go back on Enbrel.

Absolutely fantastic BUT now experiencing severe side effects.

33, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis,No side effects because I use the powder vials 25mg 2x/wk because they don't burn.  The powder and diluent has to be mixed prior to injection.  It's a very fine needle injection.  Much better than the auto injector.If using the auto injector at 50mg 1x/wk it burns and gives an injection site reaction from the preservative in it. If using the prefilled syringe at 50 mg 1x/wk_ it's not as bad and only stings. Again from the preservative. ,It works.I take it without methotrexate.,F,50,7  years25mg 2x wk,10/1/2015,Enbrel

37, 2, RA,After the 1st dose_ I thought Enbrel was my miracle but after the second dose I experienced extreme nauseas for 4 days. I called my RA doc who wanted me to discontinue next dose of methotrexate and Enbrel then take next dose of Enbrel by itself. That night I had the nausea but next morning things seemed fine. I had slight confusion through the morning and felt 'burned' by the sun when I took students outside. I ended up losing conscience and  having extreme confusion (maybe a seizure) over the next 2-3 hours. Went to er_ had normal MRI and CT_ blood sugar and cell counts but still felt confusion_ inability to make my body respond to mental commands_ difficulty speaking words that I wanted to say (mentally not physically). After 2 days I was still having nausea even with drinking water and now it's been 3 days and I'm still drinking Boost (no appetite) and still some brain fog.

My ra doctor agreed and is looking for alternate drug.  I knew something was wrong with my health but had no idea it was enbrel doing the damage.

Went to a couple of dermatologists and was put on high doses of prednisone which made me crazy and my family fear my wrath. Lol. Those of you who have had the roid rage understand. They just said it was eczema.  RA doctor did not know what rash was either. Finally the rash got so bad went to another dermatologist who was (is) amazing and biopsied rash. Thank goodness she discovered I had a severe staph infection. (presently going through this.  If i hadn't gone to her I could have been hospitalized. I think after long term use it may cause infections. Don't know why this just started to happen. I'm going to call Enbrel's hotline and inform them. Going to find new RA doctor and stop Enbrel.

41, 5, RA,In the first four weeks_ I had injection site swelling and itching--but that no longer happens.  I am fatigued for a couple of days after the injection.  Headaches--but they're not as severe as when I first started the drug.  I had a root canal about two months into the treatment_ and still have pain and inflammation at the tip of that tooth.  My dentist has seen that happen with other patients who are on some type of biologic.,This is a miracle drug for me.  I had used Arava for months_ with absolutely no relief.  For over a year_ I was in excruciating pain; I was unable to use my hands; couldn't make a fist; and I broke my foot twice from dropping a pot onto it!  Three days after my first injection_ I could use my hands again!  The swelling was gone within a week and I no longer had pain in any of my joints.

I even stopped my prednisone which i could never go a day without and really didnt help a hole lot but was able to bare through work.2 weeks after 2nd injection i suddenly woke up with a large painful soft ball size red rash at both injections sites. Very itchy and painful and warm to touch. That night i had chills_  hot one minute and soaking wet and freezing the next also have body aches and severe nausea & vomitting and a headache since reaction. I went to my md and they are doing blood work and urinalysis. I dont know if i have the flu or its from the injection. Kinda weird i suddenly reacted with a rash then got sick 9 hours later. Guess i will see what happens.,Im very nervous of taking my next injection after reading some of these reveiws but wow i cant beleive it worked so quickly. I couldn't even write a month ago as my wrists were in terrible pain and was unable to open bottles. I was unable to grip a pen and was dropping things all the time.

So even though I personally don't see a ""miracle"" to my pain_ it HAS TO BE HELPING me.  My hair loss is major since starting Enbrel.  I have purchased a wig for a backup as I lose huge amounts everyday when brushing my hair out.  I have to ""catch"" the hair doesn't go down the drains as way too much falling out and definitely would cause a clogged drain!!!  Hoping for a miracle!!!

I ensure the medicine sits out at least 30 minutes before injection to ease the sting. Occasionally I will have a flare up but it does not last. I was skeptical about starting a biologics after reading about the many side effects. But I trusted my doctor had weighed the benefits to the possible side effects. Also I took it upon myself to read as much as possible about the disease & the medications.

As for painful injection and welts_ the stomach is the best to avoid this - also letting the medicine warm up to room temparture helps. I have had no problems with this medication (except for occasional bruising).

Went on Enbrel as soon as it came out and experienced relief within days.  What little pain I experienced with regular inj was nothing compared to RA pain....have no pain at all with autoject.  Some side effects that people experience would occur with RA regardless of being on Enbrel--I know this from being a healthcare professional myself.

Sacroilitis kicked in at 20_ and I've been on vicodin ever since (9 years).  I walk with a severe limp because of the pain half of the time_ and experience stiffness for about a hour & a half after waking everyday. My spine has straightened from c8-c1_ and causes intense tension headaches that wake me in the middle of the night. My head would hurt so bad that I would use icepacks_ pain killers_ muscle relaxors and nothing would change the level of the pain. The only thing that helpful was anti-inflammatories_ but I can not take those because my ulcerative colitis would immediately flare up and my colon would bleed heavily. My headaches usually last 1-4 weeks_ moderate back pain is present 50 percent of the time_ severe sacroilitis that leaves me bed bound is once 1-3 days every 3-4 months. I am taking Enbrel injections once a week_ and I am looking forward to my 3rd shot in a few days! Since my first injection I have not limped_ my back pain is barely noticeable_ and my stiffness in the morning is down to 20-30 minutes. My headaches are are a 1 out of 10_ and my neck's muscle tension is at a 2 out of 10. This improvement is amazing_ and I hope that it will last.

Doctors couldn't figure out what was going on and did emergency surgery and biopsy.  Several disc fusions and months on antibiotic fusions_ doctors took me off Enbrel_ thinking lowered immunity led to staph infection.    Was off for two years and tried methotrexate.  That was horrible and eventually went back to Enbrel.  Seem to get every cold_ virus_ and sinus infection possible.  Resistant to antibiotics.,Began this drug many years ago off label before approved.

Sometimes the shot hurt_ sometimes it doesn't as much. I'm good with pain but it is impossible not to scream ""OWWWWW"" for the duration of the shot but it gets easier to take as you already know what you're in for!

Effectiveness started to wane after about a year_ but still kept psoriasis at bay. Try only to inject it into your thighs. I tried injecting it into my lower abdomen as demonstrated on the diagram and I found it wasn't as effective. Also_ make sure you get the bloodwork done to check your liver because Enbrel can damage it. Mine is fine thus far_ but I'm keeping an eye on it. Otherwise_ great drug!

133, 5, Moderate psoriasis,Not really a side effect but I noticed its better to do the injection at night_ instead of the morning_ or I'd feel a little drowsy during the day. Injecting at night has taken care of that.,I was scared to death to get on this medication because of the reported risks and side effects. I finally got to the point that I couldn't take it anymore and saw my dermatologist. I couldn't be happier that I did! I cleared almost 100% within 2-3 weeks of starting this medication. It has literally been a miracle for me! The sure-click auto injectors are really easy to use. The medicine burns while it is going in_ for 10-15 seconds_ then it's done & the pain goes away. I highly recommend this medication if you're fed up with your psoriasis.,F,28,5  months50mg 1X W,11/4/2011,Enbrel

I agree with one of the previous posters about taking supplements and exercising while on  this medication. I worry about long term side affects but it's cleared psoriasis that covered about 40% of my body. I had plaque psoriasis on the soles of my feet and it was at times painful and itchy. I take milk thistle to help support liver function. You need to keep a close eye on your bloodwork. I seriously think the doctors get incentives for prescribing this but it's made a big difference in my life and I dread the thought of how bad it will be if I discontinue the Enbrel. Some patients do not need to take it weekly so you might want to review that with your doctor. I seem to be best off taking it weekly.,M,54,2  years 1X W,10/25/2011,Enbrel

I've rcently had an insurance screwup and haven't been able to refill for the past 3 weeks. Strangely enough I havent had any relapse since going temporarily off it.

141, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis,Since starting on Enbrel_ I have had two bouts of cellulitis_ one of which hospitalized me for a week on IV antibiotics. May have been Enbrel related.  Colds seem to last a bit longer but are not more frequent and I have frequent nasal irritation and occasional congestion.,The medication changed my life. Before Enbrel I was in constant pain and was partly disabled. Since taking Enbrel I have become fully active_ very athletic for my age and my skin problems have almost resolved. Arthritis pain comes and goes but is really a minor burden_ So for me the drug is effective. Safe? Meh. Bottom line is that this drug has some rare but horrific potential side effects. It's as scary as a war. But what are the alternatives? Something is going to kill you one day and if you're already middle aged or older I think the risk reward formula favors Enbrel as long as it works.,M,51,5  years25mg 2X W,9/16/2011,Enbrel

143, 1, Psoriasis & PA,Reasonable abatement of P & PA symptoms for first 2 yrs. Then increasing number of low-grade infections_ and return of P & PA symptoms. By year 4_ permanently compromised immune system; pre-MS brain lesions; antibiotic-resistant infection that resulted in 6 organ failures & subsequent resections.,TNFs are dangerous. P & PA already weaken your auto-immune response. TNFs exacerbate this. Enbrel nearly killed me_ and I was hyper-vigilant in monitoring my use/suspended use at the 1st sign of cold_ flu_ etc. With no warning and having suspended use at onset of simple cold_ I was in ER within 12 hrs undergoing multiple surgeries to stave off a lethal staph-caused peritonitis. I lost SIX organs! Team of surgeons/doctors from 2 nationally prominent hospital systems all concurred that infection would have been easily managed_ BUT Enbrel had weakened my immune response to such a devastating extent that the infection could run rampant. I stopped taking Enbrel in 2008; by 2009 MRIs showed pre-MS brain lesions; by last year_ labs shows pre-lymphoma. Docs still say Enbrel to blame. I WAS BIONICALLY AND GENETICALLY HEALTHY until I took this medication. Advice: get full blood workups 2-4 times/year (including TB_ CBC_ CRP) at very minimum and be fully aware of long-term risks. Most asymptomatic patients do not have longitudinal data beyond 1-2 years of use.,F,50,4  years50mg 1X W,8/31/2011,Enbrel

Within 2 months I could run_ had no pain and had more energy than I could remember and finally had my life back! Enbrel saved my life.

147, 4, Spondyloarthritis,I started using the Enbrel Autoinjectors 10 weeks ago per request on my rheomatologist. I was diagnosed with Spondyloarthritis at the age of 14_ and the pain became so bad I was stuck in bed for weeks at a time. Within the first week after taking Enbrel_ I was able to walk normally_ and even start running again. Around my 3rd week_ I began Redlighting for my skin_ and I would instantly get a large almost welt-like reation around my injection site if I would redlight the day of or day after my injection. If I didn't redlight_ I would only get a little itching around my injection site and the occasional warm_ red spot_ which could become the size of a baseball or larger. Mixing the injection site with heat isn't recommended_ because that is what set off my reactions. Other than that_ the product works extremely well for pain.,I missed a dose one week when my shipment was not recieved_ and I noticed that my skin became increasingly oily and acne spots starting appearing. Two days after I got back on my normal schedule_ it all went away. Skipping injections isn't recommended. Although your pain stays away_ your skin will become very oily.,F,15,10  weeks50 MG 1X W,7/4/2011,Enbrel

155, 1, Psoriasis/Psoriatic Arthritis,I have used Enbrel 3 times in the last couple years and just stopped the third round of shots. The first time I cleared from 30% coverage in 6 weeks with no side effects or pain. I was off after I cleared for 6 months and started to bloom really bad and arthritis started back. Took it again for 12 weeks and although it took longer I cleared but not below the knees. Pain was relieved. I got covered by insurance again and 10 weeks ago I started back on it. This time It was as if I was injecting water! My Psoriasis slowed its spread some but I did not clear any. I have also gotten sick 3 times and had sore throats when usually I never get sick or can remember a sore throat before. I also noticed three 9mm spots and two 1 inch long hard areas that looked like Psoriasis but felt like warts do. My Dermatologist said they were harmless and were I believe she called them Keratosis. They are very hard and just like a plantars wart. The thing is_ I never have had that before. Not 100% sure Enbre,Like I said_ the third time I started Enbrel I got no benefit at all from it. When not on it I  was the only person in the house that NEVER got sick when all the rest did. While on Enbrel the 3rd time I was sick more than not. This time if anyone in the home had a cold or virus_ I got it also. My young daughter was on it at the same times for the same reasons except for the last round. I will not let her take it again after reading the real possibility of M.S. and other diseases. Some doctors would not take it. This medication lowers your bodies ability to kill cancer cells also. I do not want my child to be the person to provide the long term research by letting her take this immuno-suppressive drug. Too many major risks. Everyone should have the choice as to whether they want to take the risk though. One more thing to insurance_ Chronic Plaque Psoriasis is not a purely cosmetic issue as I have heard for 20 years.,M,45,8  months50 Mg 2X W,4/10/2011Email,Enbrel

I also had swelling in my ankles and my hands_ which were also very painful to open and close.  Since I have been on Enbrel I am 80% more mobile and the pain in my hip has lessened by 80%.

157, 2, Psoriatic Arthritis,Headaches and Bad site injection reaction,The first time I took my injection_ I had no reaction. The 2nd and 3rd injection_ I had a small in size_ itchy rash that eventually went away w/in 5 days. The 4th injection I had an itchy rash that started out small_ but tripled in size_ and is still present after 9 days (hasn't gone away). Now_ my 5th injection is worse. It started off small in size and by morning it had tripled in size. It is warm to touch_ swelling_ hard_ and very itchy. My doctor's office suggested taking a Benadryl before and after_ and icing the site before and after. That did not work. I rather live with the pain in my knees than live with these symptoms every day for as long as I take the medication. Unless there is something I can take to offset the bad reaction that I'm experiencing_ I will stop the injections. All of this in just a month.

158, 5, Rhuematoid arthritis,Injection site reaction_ headaches_ have had shingles twice since being on enbrel_ noticably thinning &dry hair_ cystic acne & slow healing which isn't great for my self esteem :)_ odd & easy bruising_ all of these side effects are nonissues due to the fact that enbrel has given me backmy life!  I was diagnosed at 26 years old I thought I'd never live normally again &after trying prednisone (way more evil than enbrel btw) and methotrexate_ enbrel is a wonder drug for me.  it is scary and strong but I am young and have small children and work & go to school full time and I am able to function normally 98% of the time.,DO NOT take enbrel if you have a cold or someone in your house is sick!  Inject in stomach_ do not pinch skin (oww) spread the skin apart with two fingers_ let the shot come to room temp_let the alcohol dry completely and make sure the purple circle is pressed firmly into the skin at a 45degree angle.  I take benedryl with the injection most of the time & I take it right before bed and all of that minimizes the pain and injection site reactions.  Take a multivitamin_ vitamin c_ prenantal vitamins etc and they really help with the immunity issues and the thinning of the hair etc.  ALl of the side effects of enbrel can be managed with lifestyle changes for me.  I began taking vitamins and I exercise and do Zumba 3 times per week and I have almost no side effects now.  I had to learn what worked for me to help manage them and they are different for everyone.  Rather than sit around and feel sorry for myself bc the wonder drug made me feel bad I had to realize that having a chronic illness sucks in general and Ihad to be grateful that even though I have headaches etc I can wipe my own butt and sign my name and pick up my children and be a human being all of which was impossible before enbrel.  there is a trade off with EVERY drug so I am very happy with enbrel and how it has enabled me to LIVE!!!!,F,30,2  years50mg 1X W,3/20/2011,Enbrel

165, 1, RA,Intestinal pain_ severe very frequent diarrhea_ stomach cramping,I was diagnosed with severe RA 20 years ago. Among the meds  I have taken are methotrexate for 2 years_ sulfasalazine_ prednisone_ planquinil_ leflonomide and other RA drugs.  I took the first Enbrel autoinject on Nov 30_2010 developed severe diarrhea with stomach and intestinal cramping on Dec 24_ stopped Enbrel on Dec 28.  Almost two months later_ I still have loose bowels_ intestinal and stomach pain_ but the diarrhea is no longer explosive and is usually restricted to between 5am and 9 am; frequency is about 6 bowel movements.   I am no longer able to eat the foods I ate before such as raw vegetables_ spices and chocolate. Before Enbrel_ I was very regular with normal bm's and I could eat anything without causing stomach problems.  I am now worried that this may be a long term or permanent effect.  Has anyone else experienced this? If yes_ did you come across anything to alleviate it?  Other from this I had no other immediate side effects but recently I noticed red spots on my forearm. I also seem to have more sinus congestion. I don't think enough is known about this drug and I don't recommend it.,F,63,5  weeks50mg 1X W,2/21/2011Email,Enbrel

A month later_ I woke up with left side numbness and extreme pain_ including my tongue and face.  Numbness and pain was accompanied by waves of feelings of pins and needles_ muscle weakness_ dizziness and blurred vision.  Neurologist was worried that Enbrel had caused me to have MS.  Brain MRI came back clear_ but after three weeks I'm still experiencing blurry vision and numbness and pain_ which has diminished except in my feet.

190, 3, RA,I had been taking another drug since May which was helping with joint pain in my knees and ankles_ but my wrist pain increased.  I also noticed hair loss with this med. My doctor suggested adding Enbrel in August.  I have my husband inject the preloaded syringe.  The first three weeks I had no injection site reaction_ but in the last two weeks the injection site has been red_sore and hard_ lasting for almost 5 days. My hair loss has increased considerably. So much so that I asked my doctor if I could stop the previous medication and only take Enbrel_ which I did. I have also noticed more sinus drainage thus causing my throat to be sore_ and a cough. I've also noticed that cuts take longer to heal.,After two weeks of taking Enbrel_ my wrist_ the last joint that continued to be painful_ has gotten so much better. Still concerned about the hair loss but not sure if there is still residual from the previous meds in my body causing this or if it's a side effect of Enbrel. I do not want to go bald.

192, 4, Rhumetoid Arthritis,The only thing that bothers me about this injection is the pain of the actual injection once I click. I don't think I notice any other symptoms apart from weight gain - but that is probably just me and not enbrel. Also_ the auto injector is so much more convenient because the majority of the syringe ones were always faulty for me and very frustrting.,I was diagnosed with Juvenille Chronic Arthritis when I was 3 years old. Since then I have been on almost every other medication for arthritis but nothing worked long term. I just remember alway getting sick and being prone to infections_ and throughout my childhood I pretty much was sore every single day. I was depressed as a child because I couldn't really do anything_ participate in sports_ go to the shops without using a wheelchair. Even throughout my schooling I couldn't really cope without a wheelchair and that was lowering my self esteem. In 2004 my wonderful doctor introduced enbrel to me and my mother. I didn't want it at first mostly because I was scared_ but he guaranteed that it will work _ so I gave it a try and it has been the best thing ever for me. I honestly_ rely on this drug so much. I noticed a difference as soon as I took it and pretty much can walk now for longer periods. I am proud to say that I am 22 years old_ and I haven't used a wheelchair for quite a few years now. I think I am a better and more confident person because of it. There are times where I miss my injection (which I know is really careless of me)_ and I start to get really bad again. But as soon as I have enbrel I am fine again. I don't think there is a better alternative out there. Not for me anyway.

I probably have it on 10-15% of my body with the worst being my scalp and finger nails. I notice when my finger nails are really bad and I am in a meeting or socializing in a group people notice my finger nails right away. I know this because they automatically start looking/biting and picking at their nails. I CANT STAND PEOPLE DOING THIS!!!! Enbrel has suppressed elbow_ scalp_ and knee patches but it completely cleared my finger nails in 4-5 weeks (had to grow out). I love it for this very fact but hate it for what I know it may be able to do to you in the long run. I don't want to die from lymphoma_ or never recover from severe influenza. I know if I use this stuff forever this will be the case. I only use it when my nails start getting really bad. I'll do a month on and then quit for 4 months. Seems to be working out alright like this. I also use clobetasol proprianate ( a topical ointment) in conjuction with enbrel on all my elbow_ knee_ buttocks patches and I can almost get it completely clear for a few weeks before the lack of enbrel use regularly makes it start to come back.,M,30,1.5  years50mg 1X W,8/19/2010Email,Enbrel

220, 5, Rhuematoid arthritis,no side effects,SECRET TO PAINFREE INJECTION!!!   After a terrible experience with my first (CLICK) injection given by the doctor in his office I was terrified to try this at home.   The first one was excrutiatingly painful.  The 2nd one given by my husband at home went without a hitch.   I let the click pen warm to room temerature for 30 minutes. Took 2 Ibroprophen and 2 Xanax an hour before the injection.  I iced the injection site (thigh) with a blue ice pack for a few minutes until it was numb.  My husband slightly stretched the skin where he was going to inject.  The medication went in within 7-10 seconds with just a very slight (barely noticeable) sting.  The only glitch was we waited and waited for that 2nd click.... then realized my husband was still holding down the purple button.  After 45 seconds and a confirmed purple reading of the medication indicator we assumed all the med was safely injected.   I am the biggest baby in the world when it comes to needles... so this was not easy for me and I fretted and made myself sick over this impending injection.  But it was a breeze....even tho the needle was in 3 times longer than it should of been.   Of course you would want to check with your doctor regarding the Ibro and Xanax... but it sure helped me!   I think stretching the skin helped too.  ANYWAY... I felt nothing but a slight sting as the med went in.   2 weeks ago I was on mega doses of Predisone and could barely function.

224, 1, Ankylosing Spondylitis,Demyelinating lesions on my brain PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE TAKING ENBREL_ THIS REVIEW IS REAL AND IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE! I'm 27 and my life will never be the same after taking Enbrel for only 6 months.,6 months after I had been taking Enbrel with good results I woke up to my face being numb on the right side. A week later I started having double vision and dizziness. I was in a daze and totally non-functioning after awhile. After my face went numb my doctor told me to get off Enbrel and come in for an MRI of my brain.  Results showed demyelination on my brain. The Neurologist i see actually teaches at the university med school and did a long study on Enbrels effects on the brain. It took 6 months for all the symptoms to finally get better_ not even go away_ just ease up. I just came back from Mayo Clinic in Rochester_ MN and was given good news that the lesions are finally inactive.  It's taken a YEAR for the lesions to become inactive_ but now I have a 20% chance of developing Multiple Sclerosis because of this drug and the lasting effects it has had on me. IM ONLY 27 YEARS OLD. For many people Enbrel is a dream medication_ but for me it was a total nightmare. I don't want to frighten people_ but please just consider this and ask your doctor if you could develop something like this.  I will always have lesions on my brain even though I won't touch Enbrel ever again.,F,27,6  months 1X W,4/9/2010,Enbrel

226, 3, severe psoriasis,No noticeable side effects in 5 mo. The SureClick is more painful than the one with Humira though! I'm pretty sure the Enbrel is helping with the arthritis. Hard to tell unless I go off it and see if the pain is worse than it is when I'm on it. My skin has all but cleared except for the pink areas where the psoriasis was the worst. It is such a relief_ but now that I'm waiting to see why I have enlarged lymph nodes_ I'm wondering if it's worth it. Had an abdominal CT scan to find out why one leg has been swelling and results show enlarged lymph nodes (1.6 mil). Doctor ordered blood tests which I did today and will wait for results_ but I'm a bit worried.,"I'm in an awkward situation in that I don't have insurance and have not been seen by a rhuemy_ only a dermatologist and a free clinic. I get the medication from the Encourage Foundation_ which I'm grateful for_ but I don't have a ""team"" to work together and help figure out the best course for me to take. I've done some research and found out that enlarged lymph nodes can be from infection but I'm wondering what kind of infection could I have? If the blood tests come back with lymphoma_ I guess I've cooked my goose by taking the Enbrel. It took me 4 years of suffering with the psoriasis and the PA before I decided to try Humira--that cleared me within 2 mo._ but then stopped working and when the derm suggested taking the shots every 10 days instead of 14_ I started spotting and had to get a uterine biopsy which turned out good. Of course I wouldn't go back on the Humira. I didn't do anything for about 4 mo. until it got so bad again that I decided to try Enbrel. Don't know what's next.

I recently had a toenail removed (thick psoriasis nail) and had to stop Enbrel because of repeated infections and anti-biotics during the healing process.

I could hardly sit up in the mornings without puking from a sour stomach. These side effects continued for as long as I used Enbrel and I was tested negative for several other diseases. Please_ DO NOT use this medication with a cronic diagnosis of any illness_ it did not help me or the other patients I had known at all.,Also_ I discovered there was a high risk of Leukemia(and other closely related cancers). Instead of using this medicine_ I suggest Orencia. Do yourself a favor_ look into Orencia_ it started working the first month of treatment_ it has no side effects so far and is not painful (besides when they insert a small tube into your vein for the medicine to pass through.),F,12,17  months 2X W,3/14/2010,Enbrel

I tried the pre-mixed once a week injections_ but the twice a week is painless_ due to having a 7.4 ph_ unlike the pre-mix.,This is not a perfect drug. Is there such a thing? But I would probably be dead by now if not for this. I had severe RA with high sed rate and nothing (and I tried nearly everything) had more than a slight effect.  I felt better after my first two shots.   Much damage had already occured_ but Enbrel seems to have nearly stopped the progression.

It's the arthritis. If it's with out flare up symptoms it may be the Embrel.) But over all my side effects are nothing compared to my symptoms without Enbrel.,Though Embrel has not cured me and never will.(At this time our disorders are not curable. But they are treatable.) Embrel has helped a great deal in slowing the progression. My Psoriasis is almost clear. Still have a few mild spots of Plaque. but nowhere as bad as before. My Psoriatic Arthritis is much more manageable and flare ups are fewer & shorter with Enbrel. I've had to stop and start Enbrel many times over the past 9yrs.(For mild infections and once for a year for insurance.) And I can feel and see the major differance with and without. At 36 and only a year off the Enbrel I was completely disabled. The most simple of daily task became a challenge. And many like getting out of bed. Bathing and dressing required constant assistance to do. It was the scariest time of my life. But being back on Enbrel I'm still able to work a very physical job in a factory.

258, 3, JRA/RA,Some Weight Gain_ Hair Loss_ injection site reactions.,I had been diagnosed with JRA at around the age of 9.  Initially methotrexate and daily naproxen managed my condition (prednisone when needed).  My condition went into a remission during my college years; I was taken off the methotrexate and maintained the naproxen.  Around the age of 22 my RA started acting up again_ I started on the methotrexate_ flare ups were not near as bad as during my younger years_ but inflammation and joint damage was apparent.  It was decided that I start Enbrel given the fact the methotrexate alone was not enough.  I have been on Enbrel for 6 weeks now_ recent changes I have noticed is weight gain (6lbs)_ my eyelashes have thinned out some and it is difficult to say for my hair condition (I have long hair)_ and my injection sites swell_ bruise and have a scaly feeling.  Overall I feel great_ I go to the gym daily without pain_ can finally lift weights without paying for it later_ can sleep without braces (i.e. wrist brace); however_ the side effects listed above are difficult to accept at the age of 27.

259, 3, JRA RF positive,I just started taking enbrel this week. I am on an accelerated schedule_ so_ I am taking two injections per week. Ouch. Because of my age and weight_ I am not eligible for sure-click autoinjector_ so I have to use a syringe_ which makes it about 3 times as scary! I've recently been feeling very nauseous_ has anyone else had this_ or is it not a side effect? Headaches have also been developed_ but they are not too painful. At least for now.,I am satisfied for now_ and my arthritis pain has definitely declined_ but I do have some side effects. Either way_ it's short term pain for long term gain! Enliven services has been awesome! Thanks!,F,12,7  days,10/25/2009,Enbrel
260, 5, Psoriatic arthritis,Fatigue_ some headaches_ sinus congestion_ maybe some weight gain_ winter flu has been much more severe.,Is very effective for me. Went off Enbrel for a few months and symptoms returned_but went back on and had almost immediate improvement (2 days).,M,47,2  years,10/23/2009,Enbrel
261, 4, RA,Feeling a little tired lately. No other side effects.,Found out I had RA at 27.  After months of complaining about joint pain_ fatigue and night sweats my doctor decided to test me.  My levels are low but the pain and swelling are severe.  I started Enbrel and was quite concerned about the side effects but so far I feel great. I'm not sure I will ever feel comfortable jogging like I used to but at least I am able to do my everyday activities with out pain.,F,28,4  months,10/7/2009,Enbrel
262, 5, RA,Little or no side effects! I do have slight brusing at the injection site.  However_ this last only a day or two. I do get at least two colds a year...which includes sinus.  I'm not sure that is due to Enbrel.,"I have been taking Enbrel since 2005....was diagnosis with RA in 2001 and had severe pain on a daily basis. Enbrel is a Godsend for me...I take one 50mg a week! I now spring out of bed with no pain and climb the 10 steps to my bathroom and get ready for work. Climbing the stairs is my morning exercise...it makes me feel great_ as a few years back I had difficulty climbing stairs. I'm able to wear heels again and this does wonders for my Psyche. I do have a question for anyone out there...has anyone experienced canker sore...I have had one for about 1 year now and nothing seems to work at getting rid of it! I should also note that I'm Diabetic and I also take Plaquenil and Levothyrox. Many individuals have written about ""being tired"" that is a side effect of RA as well....I don't feel I'm tired more than usual.",F,47,5  years,10/3/2009Email,Enbrel
263, 2, MCTD,After the third of once weekly 50mg injection_ I started having flu like symptoms_ fever_ body aches_ nausea etc. Also redness on nose and cheeks.,Had a severe allergic reaction to Plaquinil 6 months ago. Decided to try Enbrel. Have not felt any relief although only have taken 3 shots. Don't know if my flu like symptoms were a result of the medication or I actually had the flu. I'm not sure I want to continue. Anyone else with similar experience? I don't think I'll ever feel good again.,F,54,3  weeks,9/27/2009Email,Enbrel

I wonder how this affects bloating -- something I have noticed that I experience more of.,M,44,2  years,9/7/2009,Enbrel
268, 1, psoriatic arthritis,I have recently been diagnosed with MS after taking Enbrel for about 2 years. After many MRI scans and doctors visits_ it seems that it is very likely that Enbrel brought about the MS. I was once a believer that the benefits outweighed the risks_ but that was before being diagnosed with an disease such as MS that may land me in a wheelchair. DO NOT take this drug.,,F,35,2  years,9/7/2009,Enbrel
269, 5, RA,Not healing as fast from small cuts,I was on Remicade for one year and it almost killed me.  On that drug I lost 50 pounds_ tired all of the time and just did not care about anything.  I was rated with the highest RA count you can almost have.      With enbrel I am a new person.  My weight is back to normal_  I can work outside without constant pain.    I also have a 7 year old daughter.   I missed her early years of not being able to play with her due to the pain.With Enbrel I can do anything.   Taking the 50 mg shot once a week is no problem.  Never-ever had any pain in the stomach areaor the legs.   If you have RA  please ask your Dr. about this drug.  Make sure you have insurance and it is covered as it costs about  $1_600  for  four  shots.,M,53,4  years,8/27/2009,Enbrel
270, 5, Psoriasis,Have had no side affects.,Have plaque psoriasis and when taking embrel twice a week for the first 3 months_ it cleared my psoriasis.

Two weeks after stopping the drug my condition came back 300X worser than it was before I started using Enbrel.",This injection is so very painful.  I have undergone every treatment there is for psorisis since 1977-1978 and my opinion this drug is the most dangerous of them all.  I have other health issues caused from this drug that I am deaing with now and really scared...,F,49,9  months,8/20/2009Email,Enbrel
272, 5, psoriatic arthritis,Only a very occasional headache_ nothing else,I have a mild form of this disease. About 15 years ago I was in to running. I had to stop because of neck pain that I was developing. I endured gradual and increasing neck pain for 10 years. When I started taking Enbrel about 4 years ago_ my neck pain stopped within 48 hours of the 1st injection and has not returned!,M,49,4  years,8/19/2009Email,Enbrel
273, 4, RA,Constant colds_ meaning I have to leave off injections until infection has passed (and get antibiotic or cortisone injections from GP_ as body can't fight anything any more),Scared about swine flu_ given how Enbrel emasculates the immune system. Has anyone read any reports or recommendations in this context? - apart from this fear_ I am just so grateful that - after five years of trying unsuccessful alternatives - my Spanish doctors here put me onto Enbrel - and although there is a general prescription charge for other drugs_ this is FREE!,F,58,4  years,8/18/2009Email,Enbrel
274, 5, ra,Started taking Enbrel when it first came out in the early 90's and it was a Godsend! Before taking Enbrel I had very little energy and my fingers were starting to get deformed. I took everything that was available. After taking Enbrel I felt great immediately_ less swelling & joint pain_ more energy_ and I do not have any disfiguration of fingers. Over the years I have developed female yeast infections and yeast in my digestive tract and mouth. I manage these by taking non-milk based acidophilas and staying away from yeast breads and eating very little bread & pasta prodcts. I also take arava along with the Enbrel and this controls my ra. I also take calcium & vitamin D as I am now of the age to get octeoarthritis. I was diagnosed when I was 12 with jra and am now 56 years and hold down a full time job and have lots of energy. I do like the 50mg autoinjector_ very convenient.,I understand that Enbrel is not for everyone_ but it has worked wonders for me. I understand the side effects_ and I have minimal brusing/itching at injection site_ I inject myself on thighs and back of arms.,F,56,15  years,8/16/2009,Enbrel
275, 4, AS,I have experienced no side effects to enbrel.Taking it now for a year.Occasional brusing around injection site which is not the drugs fault.,Prior to taking enbrel I couldnt even turn over in bed without severe pain.I was like an old man.My life has been transformed by enbrel and I am not exaggerating.Of course I am concerned about the long term effects but live for today and be happy.,M,44,1  years,8/14/2009,Enbrel

277, 1, Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis,Did not have any immediate side affects when I took this.  I am 17 now and I now have Leukemia.  Enbrel has been highly linked to cancer in kids under 18.  I am 17 years old and was diagnosed with APML on March 13th of this year.  Do not take this drug for anything ever.,,F,17,2  years,8/6/2009,Enbrel
278, 3, RA,Brusing at injection site. Stuffy nose and Headache. I use the 50mg sure click's. I also take 25mg of Benedryl 30 min.prior to injection just in case I have a reaction. Take your med. out of the refrigator 30 min. prior to injection. It is somewhat painful but only lasts a few seconds.,Still really scared about this medication because of the side effects however really scared about what the future holds with my RA. Dx. 3 years ago with RA. I have been on methotrexiate_folic acid and nexium since dx. I have tried other medications that either sent my liver enzymes sky high or made me so sick I could not function.I still try to work full time and stay as active as possible. I guess if you have doubts about this medication_ you have to weigh the risks against the benefits. When you stay so fatigued that your first thought in the morning is just get thru 8 hours of work and you can go home and go back to bed then if Embrel makes it better its a benefit. If when you set down at home to watch a movie and then you try to get up and you are so stiff that you can hardly walk then it is a benefit to try Embrel. If you continually have tendonitis along with joint pain and stiffness then if Embrel works its a benefit. If you are also watching your fingers shift in the wrong direction or you have the edema_redness_ and warmth in your joints then if Embel works its a benefit. I am sure you know the risks. I just want to prevent any further damage. I already feel somewhat better and have seen less stiffness with just 2 injections.,F,54,2  weeks,7/30/2009,Enbrel

281, 4, RA,Pain at injection site but is managed by ice applied to area until very numb AND I find the prefilled syringes much better (less pain) than the auto-click pens. Those things are torture devices!  I also experience a sore throat and hoarseness most of the time.  Because I take both methotrexate and Enbrel on the same day_ I feel nausea and ill for two days after injections.,After 3 months of use_ I *did* feel better but the damage to my joints_ especially my R knee_ was progressing_ so I opted to try Humira.  HOWEVER_ after one injection of Humira I had body aches so bad that I spent a week in bed!  Needless to say_ I went right back to Enbrel with a 'wait and see' for another 3 months-  after all_ Enbrel does help me to feel better so maybe the joint damage will lessen in the coming weeks.  I'm hopeful!,F,54,5  months,7/22/2009Email,Enbrel

Bad site reactions - severe bruising,On certain individuals Cancer and Lymphoma has occured...When I was brought into ER all the doctors shook there head in agreement that Enbrel caused me to lose the month of August with Pnemounia (3 diffrent antibiotics to treat) Thought I was going to die.

I am back to exercising in the water_ walking outside_ & gardening. It  took about 3 months for some relief but I have severe RA/Psoriatic arthritis & was diagnosed about 4 yrs. ago.

293, 5, Psoriatic arthritis,I took Enbrel for 2 years_ but stopped 2 years ago when I got headache and nausea.  I've had no side-effects since restarting it.,In recent months my arthritis got much worse_ and I could barely walk and was exhausted all the time. I also broke out in gutte psoriasis for the first time.   I decided to go back to Enbrel--twice a week injection.  I found that my exhaustion began to lift just a few hours after the first injection_ and by the next morning my joint pain was much improved.  Within a few days almost all the pain was gone.  I've been on it for 3 weeks now_ and my pain is gone except for a twinge in one   knee.  I'm hoping the headaches and nausea do not return.  The psoriasis still seems to be spreading a bit (red dots).  But maybe it would be a lot worse if not for the Enbrel.  I don't know since I have never had psoriasis until the last few months.,F,54,3  weeks,6/29/2009,Enbrel

295, 5, Psoriatic arthritis,Slight sore throat at times_ headaches at first.  Headaches have since subsided,I am writing for those who experience pain using the pre-filled syringe. (I had no pain with medicine we had to mix ourselves). But I also had pain with the premixed syringes. I called the company about it.  The nurse recommended that I ice my injection site (in my case_ my leg) for about 15 minutes before I inject_ and that I take the medicine out of the fridge 30 minutes before I inject so that it's at room temperature by the time I do so.  This made an enormous difference - there is still some pain associated with the injection_ but not much.Enbrel has given me enormous relief from disabling joint pain and some relief from psoriasis.,F,56,7  years,6/24/2009,Enbrel

I was one of the first patients in GA to have access to the drug back when you had to register with the manufacturer to obtain the medication. My advancement was slowed so much it is unbelievable. When diagnosed in 1992 I was given 18 months to be in a wheel chair. I'm not_ never have been. I have had several surgeries over the years and never have any issues healing.

Since stopping the drug because of the side effects they have gone away completely.  My psoriasis however is now consumming 75% of my skin. A disaster. I would not call this a miracle drug for me. I have had PA since I was 27 (now 54) and have not changed my health habits before_ during or after the trial_ it has never been out of control like this. I would stay away at all costs.

Very little pain when warmed up for at least 30 minutes_ inserted into a fatty area (stomach seems better than thigh) at a 45 degree angle_ and pushed in very slowly. If it's any where near a muscle the needle is in way too far; it only needs to be under the skin.  No weight gain or loss and no other side effects noticed. I was only sick with a ""flu"" type virus for two days this year and no colds or chest issues. No RA flare-ups so it must be working !! Osteo join pain somewhat reduced.",I was off Enbrel and Methotrexate for a total of 6 weeks for full knee replacement surgery. I had no negative impact from being off of the drugs was healing well post surgery.  I went back on both drugs on the advice of my Rheumatologist and now my healing seems to be going backward.

320, 4, Psoriasis/Psoriatic Arthrits,Medicine painful as it enters body. It is less so the fattier the injection site_ avoid muscle if you can. Skin started to clear very quickly by 95% My joints are much less stiff but still quite painful. I have gained weight. The most difficult side effects have been strange pains: this started in my abdomen immediately_ like tiny shards of glass_ first under ribs then also lower making using my stomach muscles too painful. I have been having shooting pains in my lower back recently and after 6/7 weeks on enbrel I have developed chest pain_ which feels slightly muscular and constricting. I was very worried and mentioned it to the specialist this week_ who was unconcerned. Because I have been quite concerned about it_ I bought a personal blood pressure monitor and I am ok on that front. It would be really good to know more about this side effect_ whether its short-term or if there is a way of treat it.One other thing... I have always had ear infections and later psoriasis in my ear ca,As uncomfortable as the side effects are_ I am not giving up on enbrel. I worry it may be on me though as I am already seeing spots reappear. Someone earlier wrote that they did not realise quite how enormous the impact of their illness was on their life until they started treatment - I agree. I've been a shadow of myself for years - rarely pain free and unselfconscious at the same time in 20 years. Enbrel is like a weight off my shoulders giving me an opportunity to be hopeful and look forward. I am just crossing my fingers about the side effects and hoping for the best - I deserve it surely!,F,33,8  weeks,3/28/2009,Enbrel

Previously on Raptiva for about 10 months_ but gave up due to it ceasing to have any effect with my psoriosis gradually getting worse.

323, 5, rheumatoid arthritis,yeast infection in mouth - felt like pieces of skin growing inside my mouth - flaked off easily. Simple remedy was prescription tablets to suck on. rheumatologist thought it was due to imbalance of natural bacteria in mouth_ probably due to enbrel. Am now experiencing burning in chest that's not responding to antacids. Family doc says dyspepsia and reflux can be side effects of enbrel_ but rheumatologist never told me that.,Enbrel has been a miracle drug for me_ gave me my life back. Side effects so far have been manageable and minor compared to RA. I take the 25 mg shot 2x a week_ zero pain and I actually only take it about 1 a week which holds me most of the time.

Since I have stopped injecting the Enbrel I've had recurring veginal infections (and have never had any issues ""down there"" in my life).

Got progressively worse and developed a small rash on tummy-in short  I had developed shingles which had progressed to Viral Meningitis. After hospitalisation for  a month with anti viral treatment _ I was fine again.I was reluctant to go back on the medication but had no choice due to deterioration of RA-.

The 50 mg. injection can be slightly painful_ but I learned that this can be lessened significantly by letting the syringe warm up a bit after taking it out of the fridge.  I wait 15 minutes and then inject.  Also_ the best place to inject is around the naval.  Enough fat there to absorb the needle easily without hitting any blood vessels!,This is a miracle drug.  I have been on Enbrel for almost ten years_ and let me tell you_ it gave me back my life.  I am no longer in constant pain_ the bone in by finger joints has regrown and my fingers do not appear as misshapen_ and I no longer need to take Celebrex or any other NSAID. The scientists at Immunex who developed this drug should be given the Noble Prize.  Think about it.  Kids who were in wheelchairs are now playing football.

Scared as have had TB in the past; now almost constantly suffering from cold infections but doc said keep shooting as long as no high temperature,Took a while to notice any difference (but final diagnosis had also taken around 3 years_ so fairly advanced by then) but it seems to have solved the RA almost completely; arthrosis remains_ hands semi-crippled.

343, 4, RA & OsteoA,I take one 50mg dose of Enbrel weekly for RA.  I started out with the pre-filled syringe and then was changed to the auto-injector due to a prescription snafu. While the syringe requires a little more care when using_ it is a wonder compared to the extremely painful Sure-Click.  If you let the syringe warm up for about 1/2 hour and inject it slowly_ there is no pain.  If you are squeamish about using the syringe_ you may want to have your doctor help you the first time. It's actually quite easy.,"While I think the potential side effects of this drug are very scary_ it's vastly improved the quality of my life.

I had to have foot surgery and my surgeon made me stop the drug_ I began to diet and exercise to help with the PA symptons as there was no way to stay on pain killers to help with the pain from the PA.  I have never felt better_ being off this drug has allowed me to control my PA in a more healthy way. I also feel that it was causing fungal infections within my body_ this causes so many other problems. And I do believe this caused my weight gain_ 40lbs over the 2 1/2 years I was on the drug.  I was finally able to loose weight when I quit taking Enbrel_ that never happened before.  Yes_ in the beginning is was great...but to what sacrifice!!  Trust in your body_ I suggest looking up and staying with anti-inflammatory foods_ the right foods can help you control arthritis!!!

It has given me my life back.  Remicade worked in the past and put the RA in remission for 5 years.  The RA came back a year after the birth of my first child (who is almost 2 now).

Things that seem to help: let the medicine sit out for 30 min b4 taking it_ prop the leg u are taking it in up on something so it is straight (hurts much less). Icing the site doesn't help me at all. I have been taking it since July and the pain seems to decrease with every shot but it still hurts. Doctor offered me other forms and doses but its only 10-15 sec of pain (ok..severe pain) The benefits are soooooooo worth it for me! I cried before_ during_ and after for the first few months too.

But_ more concerning_ I noticed that the day after my first injection_ my breathing capability went downhill and has stayed that way more than a year later.,While Enbrel helped reduce pain and swelling_ I'm concerned about possible lung damage. My doctor hears nothing wrong_ but I'm easily winded. Also tired_ lethargic_ and weight gain. Instead of weekly injections_ I went to monthly injections as a sort of maintenance program and this seemed to help increase energy. Currently off the drug_ but thinking of starting up again.,F,56,1  years,11/6/2008,Enbrel
363, 4, ankylosing spondylitis,injection site reactions_ started one month into my treatment and have continued without fail_ much worse if I inject my thigh.  So far this is the only side effect.,I suffered for several years without a diagnosis before finally finding the cause for my pain and stiffness.  I currently use the Enbrel with Celebrex and it has made a big difference in my life.,F,37,4  months,11/6/2008Email,Enbrel
364, 2, Psoriasis,feeling tired_ sweating and feeling very hot_ not sleeping very well,At first I thought Enbrel was very good_ it seemed to clear my Psoriasis very quickly_ but then it just stopped working for me_ my P has come back and it has caused me quite a few problems_ so I am hoping to try one of the other drugs now.,F,57,19  weeks,11/4/2008Email,Enbrel
365, 5, Psoriasis,I have not experienced any side effects from Enbrel.  I would say it effectively treated about 90%-95% of my psoriasis.  I am very pleased with the drug.  I have been taking Ebrel for about 3 years.,I feel very fortunate that Enbrel is available. I could not see myself go through another treatment with Soriatane.,M,47,3  years,11/3/2008Email,Enbrel
366, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis RA,Can't really contribute any side effects to Enbrel. I do have increased sinus infections and urinary tract infections as well as weight gain_ but this may or may not be from Enbrel. Could just be my compromised screwy immune system or few other factors. Luckily_ i have never had injection site reactions_ or any other immediate noticable issues.,"Enbrel was my lifesaver. I have been taking it for over 8 years. I have extremely high levels of RA_ Felty's Syndrome (hyper spleen-low platletts) and also have several nodules that appear and disappear over time. Sometimes_ the nodules (usually appearing on elbows-feet-toes_ and upper chest muscle area) are injected by DR with cortizone shot to help ease pain and decrease the size. Had tried Methotrexate in past-did NOT work for me. Now on CellCept with Enbrel (50mg 1x week_ and Celebrex and Hydroxychloroquine. This ""cocktail"" really seems to work for me. I also take Prednisone as needed for really extreme flare-ups. I almost always stick to stomach (around navel) for my injections...arms and legs bruise and hurt too much for my liking. Will notice a slight ""burning sensation"" every once in a while from medicine when injected_ but find..if i inject slowly_ it helps process. Never had injection site rash_ or itching. I have had to periodically stop taking Enbrel for",F,40,8  years,10/27/2008,Enbrel

368, 3, Zero Negative RA,I have been taking 50mg injection for 4 weeks now and I noticed prior to my last injection that I have a rash on the sides of my face and neck.  I am also very tired a day or two after the injection.  I take methotrexate also along with steroids...my Dr. said to come off the steroids once I have completed the 4th Enbrel injection.  After reading about all the rashes and having to stop the Enbrel I am frustrated because I wanted to take something that would work and keep me from having to take the steroids. I am interested in getting others feed back on their experiences with this medication and any other for that matter.,,F,34,4  weeks,10/22/2008,Enbrel
369, 2, Behcet's Disease,This is my first day on Humira. I switched from Enbrel because within a span of 7 months_ I had 3 major infections and every cut scrape or bruise would take 4 times as long to heal as what is normal and often leave scars. Have several nice ones on my face thanks to Enbrel. It reduced my ulcers by about 80%_ but wasn't worth it. So my initial response to Humira_ owwwww. The injection was worse than Enbrel and the site is still sore to the touch and tender all over the area. All of a sudden I have circulatory issues in my fingers_ tingles and pins and needles_ something I never experience on Enbrel.,,F,33,7  months,10/16/2008,Enbrel
370, 3, RA,Since I have started taking Enbrel injections once a week 50mg doses. I have had severe headaches that last for days today is my 5th day with a severe headache also experience nausea and severe fatigue. No injection site problems.,Not sure if Enbrel is helping me at this point_ but I don't think I can go on with the side effects without taking another medication.,F,38,4  weeks,10/14/2008,Enbrel
371, 4, RA,Slight stinging while injecting...I do my injections in my stomach and haven't had any rashes etc... In the last year_ though_ I've experienced severe fatigue_ depression and no energy. Wondering if lengthening out the time between injections would help that???,It's been great for my RA. I have occasional aches in my hands and SI joint during storms/weather changes but other than that I feel tons better....when I'm not sleeping from being so tired,F,39,3  years,9/25/2008Email,Enbrel
372, 4, psoriasis and pa,I have had fatigue_ headaches_ and some weight gain. The first few weeks there was a sight reaction but it was basically mild. Recently_ my asthma has come back but could be the weather.,Overall_ I was covered with psoriasis. It was controlling my life. It has cleared up about 85% in 7 weeks. I am not embarrassed to wear dark colors again. The headaches have been the worst but control with tylenol. Also have had some weight gain. A bit concerned about that since I have been on weight watchers for almost two years and have lost 40lbs. Other concern is my asthma. The last few days have been really bad and will have to check with my doctor. I didn't see much feed back on asthma attacks.,F,49,7  weeks,9/23/2008,Enbrel
373, 4, RA,Two days after my first dose_ I had right side facial numbness_ tounge numbness and tingling. Now 4 days after first dose my right side of my face is still tinglie and my right arm and hand feel like they are asleep. Headache on the left side of my head.,My wrist and ankles feel much better and it has only been 4 days since my first dose.,F,26,4  days,9/22/2008Email,Enbrel
374, 5, RHEUMATOID + OSTEO ARTHRITIS,I have been taking Enbrel for about 15 months. My hands and fingers are crippled and bent.  Since taking this drug_ my hands are much improved_ my back pain is much better_ I have more energy and I feel better all around!  This drug has made a big improvement for me.  Realize though_ it will not stop the disease but it will definately slow down its progress.  People who have injection site problems should hold the syringe in your hands for a minute or two until it becomes room temperature. Be sure to let the alcohol dry before giving your injection.  Also_ I have found that giving the injection in my stomach area about 1 or 1 1/2 inches to the side or below my belly button is much less painful as you do not have as manynerve endings in this area as you do in your thighs or upper arms. Keep the syringe at a 45 degree angle while injecting the medicine. Also remember_ if you get any kind of infection anywhere in your body_ DO NOT TAKE THE ENBREL until the infection is gone. I hope this,Even though it has possible side effects_ for me_ the benefits far outweigh them.,F,60,15  months,9/21/2008Email,Enbrel

I fear the day it stops working altogether.,F,43,3  years,9/21/2008,Enbrel
376, 5, RA,To the person who mentioned the very painful injection,I also tried the 50mg injection....had already been using the 25mn 2x a week and my doctor thought the 50mg would be more convenient.  I couldn't believe how painful the 50mg injection was....absolutely dreaded the shot....called my doctor and went back to the 25mg 2x week in the abdomen.....ALMOST NO PAIN!!!!,F,45,5  years,9/15/2008,Enbrel
377, 4, RA,fatigue_ dizziness_ tightness or pressure in chest,I've been on Enbrel for 2 1/2 weeks now and love the effect it has on my RA pain_ however_ I get very fatigued and experience pressure_ almost a pain in my chest and my heart raises and slow for the first day I take the shot. I've started taking them before I go to bed at night in hopes that the side effects will diminish before I have to function for the next day. Wondering if anyone else has this issue and if it lessens with time.,F,42,3  weeks,9/1/2008Email,Enbrel
378, 3, ankylosing spondylitis,kind of tired for a day or so after injection,I know the pain is better because I have cut back on muscle relaxer and pain meds.  I have had a couple of bad flare ups but didn't last long.,F,57,2  months,8/28/2008,Enbrel
379, 4, Psoriasis,Slight burning when the medication is injected_ Finding it hard to wake up in the morning no matter how much caffeine I drink. Only been on the medications for 3 weeks. There have been no changes in my nails. Elbows_ ears_ scalp has cleared up. I can wear black again!! :),I find it helps to take a deep breath then blow out quickly has you do the injection_ for anyone who gets nervous every time you have to do it...like me.,M,23,3  weeks,8/27/2008,Enbrel
380, 4, Plaque Psoriasis,Outbreak of guttate psoriasis in the last three months.  Have stopped injecting Enbrel but still dealing with the same psoriais which my derm says is not an unusual side effect after using Enbrel for this length of time.  Not sure which is worse_ the plaque or guttate psoriasis.,Enbrel worked quite well until this episode took place.  Plaque psoriasis has not worsened since stopping Enbrel_ only the guttate.,M,67,5  years,8/20/2008Email,Enbrel
381, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis,Injection burns badly (50 mg auto-injector)_ Weight loss_ and insomnia,This is a true miracle medicine. I can't believe how much better I feel and it has only been 3 weeks.  The injections are so painful I cry before_ during_ and after but its a small price to pay for this kind of pain relief.,F,33,3  weeks,8/15/2008,Enbrel
382, 5, psoratic arthritis,So far no virtually no side effects.  I sleep more_ but since I was having trouble sleeping_ this has not been a problem.,I had arthritis in my hands so bad that in the mornings I had to run hot water over them to get them moving.  With Enbrel the problem has disappeared.,,64,3  months,8/14/2008,Enbrel
383, 3, RA for 10 years,Painful injection_rash_itching lasting for 3-5 days on third injection-feelings of anxiousness(out of sorts)so not me_headaches_ painful stomach cramping and a retention of fuild in the legs and stomach_little energy.,I took Methotrexate injection for 8 years.I now take a combination of Methotrexate and Enbrel. I would appreciate a comment if anyone has experienced the stomach pain and fluid retention that in consistent and does not decrease. The Enbrel appears to keep the RA at a distance.,F,58,6  weeks,8/14/2008,Enbrel
384, 5, Psoriasis,I've been on Enbrel two separate occasions.  The first time_ I did it 2 times a week for 3 months and the psoriasis was vitually gone.  Now I'm doing it only once a week.  Both times I've noticed that I keep pulling pieces of skin from my mouth.  I have no idea why this happens when I'm on the drug and have not found anyone else with this problem.  Just wonder if anyone else has had this problem.,I just hope the drug doesn't hurt me in the long run.,M,29, ,8/13/2008,Enbrel
385, 4, Psoriasis,Injection site irritation and burning as injected. Occasional bruising.,Initially the dose was every 4 days. It took 6 months before an improvement was seen. Very slow. After the first year the dose was reduced to every 5 days. Continue to see improvements after 2 1/2 years. Using topical creams much less these days. Feet are really the only part where the psoriasis is difficult to treat.,F,52,2  years,8/13/2008,Enbrel
386, 5, Rhuematoid Arthritis,I'm wondering if going into deep depression causing attempted suicides could be a possible side effect because this has happened to me and doctors can't see why. I also get bruising on the injection site and I get headaches alot and never used to. Other than that Enbrel has been fantastic!,,F,15,4  years,8/11/2008Email,Enbrel
387, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Extreme fatigue_ need to sleep longer_ nausea_ weight gain,Works great on the flare ups.  Very few since beginning treatment.  Very expensive - unavailable without good insurance,M,46,6  months,7/29/2008,Enbrel
388, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Tired_ sleepy_ lathargic at times.  I have been rotating arms in my once a week shot - I stopped shooting in the leg.  I have never had an injection site rash or swelling.,Pain is totally gone. Miracle drug_ take a shot and your pain goes away! Just had a small amount of psorisis on my forehead and behind my ears - those didn't clear up with the shot but I put stuff on it.,M,36,2  years,7/26/2008,Enbrel
389, 4, Psoriasis,Slight pain and swelling around the injection area; tiredness; slight weight-gain,I have been self-administering Enbrel since January 2008 ... whilst this no miracle cure for psoriasis_ it is keeping it at bay - enough for me to be able to wear short-sleeved shirts when the weather gets better,M,46,7  months,7/20/2008,Enbrel
390, 3, Adult Onset Stills,Major Fatigue. Depression (according to my wife).  Gained 31 lbs. in three months.,I started Enbrel and immediately began an exercise regimen of walking 3.5 miles/day and working out 3 times a week with a trainer.  In spite of this_ and not much change in my diet_ I gained 31 lbs.  I sleep 9-12 hrs at night and nap for 1-3 hours at least 5 days a week.  The drug has kept my flare ups of severe fevers/joint pain at bay but I feel that they are about to come on but stop just short of doing so.  Quality of life is better without the flare ups but the fatigue_ weight gain and almost sick feeling is the consequence.,M,51,4  months,6/27/2008,Enbrel
391, 5, RA,Weight gain,Great drug.  Almost full relief of RA symptoms after first injection.  Can't seem to figure out the weight gain.  I'm exercising more_ eating less_ and I have now gained 15 pounds.  Go figure.  Some other message boards also report this finding.,M,38,6  months,6/10/2008,Enbrel
392, 3, ankylosing spondylitis,Fatigue_ increased allergies,Enbrel has increased my endurance & mobility while decreasing pain & inflammation. I use the autoinjector_ which is painful but worth it.,F,43,11  months,6/5/2008,Enbrel
393, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis,Easy injections. Slight clouding over top of left eye. Some foot and finger swelling.,I started enbrel four or five weeks ago. Overall_ I am feeling better and am not too concerned about the side effects. However_ I noticed a slight dark patch at the top of my (left) visual field some days ago. Today_ my right foot was so swollen and painful I couldn't walk. Without talking to my doctor_ I'm not sure if these are side effects or not. I'm still taking Sulfasalazine daily and Diclofenac as necessary - today it was.,M,51,5  weeks,6/3/2008,Enbrel
394, 5, Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA),I have been one of the lucky few who has been virtually side effect free.  I have occassional injection site reactions (maybe 1 out of every 10).  They are just itchy for a few days_ and I barely notice them.  Otherwise_ I believe that Enbrel has caused a lupus like red rash on my face (tested negative for lupus).  Not painful at all_ responds to topical steroids for the self conscious.  Biggest problem is that if you get any serious infection_ you probably will have to get off the Enbrel until it goes away.  Its in times like those that you really appreciate how much the medicine is doing for you,I was on methotrexate and extremely high doses of NSAIDS before getting the opportunity to try enbrel.  My doctor encouraged it_ and I was fortunate enough to have an insurance willing to pay the massive costs.  It is EXPENSIVE.  Very EXPENSIVE.  Might be less than some other options_ but my insurance company is shelling out $1_500+/month.  If other things have failed for you_ please consider talking to your doctor about this kind of treatment.  It has changed my life in so many ways and allows me to do things(walking almost pain free_ jogging_ even running with a little work in the gym first to strengthen up those muscles).,M,24,10  years,5/22/2008,Enbrel
395, 3, RA for 25 years,painful injection_ slight bruising_ staff infection,I took enbrel for 2 years with very good results until I got a staff infection which settled in 2 of my thoractic vertebrae. Spent 10 days in the hospital_ the first few days in severe pain_many rounds of drugs_ blood tests_ MRI's. Then spent 2 months wearing a brace from my waist to my chin_ and a continuous antibiotic IV  for 2 months. We believe the staff infection started from a small cut on my finger_ but not sure. I already had degenerative disc disease before all this_ now I am on social security disability.Enbrel worked great while it worked but suppressing your immune system has it's risks. I'll never take it again. Now taking methotrexate and celebrex.,M,59,2  years,5/6/2008Email,Enbrel
396, 3, Psoriatic Arthritis,Dizziness and tiredness that have subsided.  Large hive-like swelling at injection site.  Persistent pain around injection sites.  Swelling of feet and hands.,I've just taken my third injection.  After #1 I was dizzy and very tired_ but noticed improvement in my spine w/i a few days.  Had a great week.  Injection #2 provided very little relief_ which was upsetting.  At the moment it's hard to say whether or not this drug will help me_ but because of ulcerative bowel disease_ I cannot take MXT or NSAIDS.  Took Prednisone for years_ but had to discontinue due to pulmonary/cardiac side effects.  I've avoided the biologics for years_ mainly because I've been terrified of the side effects.  Now that I've made the jump_ I'm hoping it works and doesn't kill me in the process.  We all deserve to live a pain-free life.,F,44,3  weeks,4/28/2008,Enbrel
397, 4, R A,i get a rash at the injection site that is very itchy. it lasts for a few days and it leaves a darker mark in the area where i had the rash,the rash is not fun but i feel so much better using this product. my body feels so much better i can do all the things i was having trouble with before this medicine.,F,29,2.5  months,4/22/2008Email,Enbrel
398, 5, RA,Possibly low immune but live in an area where sinus trouble is very common.  No other negative effects.,Have had RA since 17yrs.  Enbrel has been great for me...no more flare ups since beginning treatment.  Felt relief with 1 week.  Also_ HIGHLY recommend RA people to follow a High-protein_ low carb diet and exercise.  My RA is VERY affected by my diet...currently down to one 25mg shot a week in the abdomen area (no bruising & no pain),F,44,5  years,4/20/2008,Enbrel
399, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,I have been taking Enbrel for almost 4 years and have had no adverse reactions.,I have been dealing with Psoriatic Arthritis for almost 20 years. Most of that time I was treated with varying doses of methotrexate and extensive use of ibuprofen. The methotrexate seemed to lose it's effectiveness in 2004 and I experienced some severe arthritic symptoms of swelling_ stiffness and aching joints. My doctor prescribed Enbrel and it has worked so well_ I frequently forget to give myself my shots. It is working for me. I play golf about 4 times per week usually walking with my 3 wheel push cart. I also play and coach soccer. without Enbrel none of this would be possible.,M,56,4  years,4/18/2008,Enbrel
400, 4, ankylosing spondilitis,It gave me 9 wonderful years of almost complete relief. I was able to return to an active lifestyle_ even engaging in high-endurance sports. But a few months ago I started having episodes of dypsnea_ or difficulty breathing_ a bit like asthma attacks. It appears they're caused by Enbrel_ and since I stopped the injections my breathing has returned to normal. However_ the AS episodes I am now experiencing are very severe_ in what appears to be a form of withdrawal. I have to take prednisone to get relief_ and am starting arava to see if that will work.,Had I known 9 years ago that Enbrel would have this bad side effect in the end_ I'm not sure I wouldn't have taken it anyway. Those years were great. But the party's over.,M,52,9  years,4/18/2008,Enbrel
401, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis,Repeated sinus infections which led to surgery_ mild flu-like symptoms (tiredness mostly) a day or so after giving myself the shot.  I'm also suffering from migraines quite frequently now.  Before Enbrel_ I had maybe 2 migraines in my entire life.  Now they're common.  I take Imitrex and Naproxen to offset the repeated migraines & other headaches.  Muscle twitches and facial tingling.,It's marvelous in handling my severe arthritis.  Without it_ I'd either still be on methotrexate and steroids or in a wheelchair.  I can definitely tell when I've missed a shot as the joint pain returns.  Most of the time_ I go around joint-pain free.  Despite the side-effects I'm experiencing_ I'd recommend it to people with moderate to severe arthritis.,F,42,5  years,4/17/2008,Enbrel
402, 3, ankylosing spondilitis,Hi all~   N.B.: I have always taken this drug with a Cox 2 inhibitor or anti-inflammatory daily.Burning at site of injection_ even with sureclick autoinjector_ but tolerable. Tired after injection but felt much better the next day. Dry mouth after abt. one year of use at 50 mg/weekly. Lately_ I have experienced nausea and sweats_ mostly during the night. Discontinued the COX-2 inhibitor_ thinking this was the cause of the nausea. Two weeks later_ taking double dose of Nexium and a liquid antacid. Took my weekly shot last night and whoa_ was extremely nauseous the whole night_ despite all the Nexium and antacids. Either the problem is the Enrel itself or something else is going on.,I found Enbrel to be quite effective but only when combined with a Cox 2 inhibitor or an anti-inflammatory (naprolen). When taking the two together_ my spine was much more flexible and my joints generally felt much better. My neck_ shoulder and TMJ jointa are very painful now that I'm off the other meds. Depressing_ this stuff_ isn't it?,F,55,1.5  years,4/10/2008,Enbrel

404, 3, Psoriasis,STROKE,This drug was a wonder drug.  My psoriasis was 95% gone and my arthritis was feeling great.  Eight weeks to the day of my first dose I experienced a mild stroke.  My Neurologist claimed it wasn't Enbrel until I showed him the paragraph that listed stroke as a side effect for the dosage I was taking.  It pays to read the two foot by three foot insert.  Lasting side effects of the stroke include short term memory loss and transposing of letters/numbers when typing.  The manufacturer didn't respond to my dermatologist's inquiries and didn't seem to care that the stroke could have been related to the drug use.  All other factors; BP_ Cholesterol_ heart_ blood work_ were normal.  My MD recommended stopping Enbrel and go back to topicals/phototherapy.,M,47,60  days,4/8/2008Email,Enbrel
405, 4, Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis,The local site reactions went away after a month of treatment. What has plagued me and I was not sure until after I discontinued use about a month ago was premature ejaculation. Two physicians have denied this was a side effect but its onset coincided with Enbrel therapy and the resolution with discontinuing Enbrel. The Enbrel did not work for my psoriasis and therefore my derm recommended Humira. My rhum prescribed Humira upon my request and my problem went away.,With regard to treating the symptoms of arthritis the Enbrel was awesome. I had not felt so good in 15 years. I had been treated with Ansaids and methotrexate for years without such good results. Enbrel was liberating_ absolutely no more pain and a positive side effect for a while was euphoria which was reported by my physician. I know people for whom it works very well in treating psoriasis unfortunately I was not one of them. The other side effects of these biological drugs do bother me however but obviously not badly enough that I would discontinue taking them at this point. Hope this helps folks. If any of you experience a similar side effect please post. Cheers!,M,43,5  years,4/2/2008,Enbrel

Mylan sheath breakdown in wrist and forearms.,After one year of Enbrel therapy I had a stroke at the age of 31 potentially from Sepsis (clotting of blood) due to Protein C and S abnormality linked to Enbrel use.

409, 2, RA,Low white count.  Rash on my lower back_ tops of legs and some on belly.,Anyone know how long this stays in your body?  I am extremely concerned about my immune system and how this brings white blood count dangerously low.  Normal is 5-10 and mine has been 2-3.  My doctor says it is not a problem but he's not the one walking around susceptible.  Have been hospitlized twice becuase of it.  Has helped pain but I'm not sure it makes sense to continue.  Think it is a very dangerous drug.  Anyone experienced heart issues like Atrial Fibrillation?  Anyone familiar with Felty's Syndrome?  TIA for any feedback.,F,57,5  months,3/12/2008Email,Enbrel
410, 4, Ankylosing Spondylitis,Felt faint after the first shot_ this was most likely due to the sensations and taste in mouth as Enbrel diffused in my body. Second shot knew what to expect no problems. Have a low level sinus drip_ and dry mouth after 1.5 weeks on this drug.,After suffering in horrible pain for 20 years I am experiencing a feeling of well being as the pain and stiffness subsides in my spine. 4 years putting this medicine off because I was concerned about the published side effects---dumb. Years of codine use to control pain has most likely harmed me more than Enbrel ever will.,M,50,12  days,3/11/2008,Enbrel

416, 4, Psoriasis and Arthritis,First Week_ Tiredness. After that_ A miracle. No more pain and stiffness in Knees_ Back_ and Feet. Works Great. The psoriasis however has showed only small improvement. Just took 6th shot_ Arthritis is 95% improved. Psoriasis 20% improved. My Rhemu told me that it takes longer for the Enbrel to work on psoriasis based on his patients. I would give this drug five stars but there is a report out there linking it to increase incidences in lymphoma in patients taking it. My doctor says all autoimmune type patients have agreater likelyhood anyway. IMHO - Works fantastic on arthritis. To be decided - On psoriasis.,I would try other known remedies first_ and if all else fails go with Enbrel. I just can't give it a wholehearted endorsement for the unknown effects it might have over years of use.,M,35,6  weeks,2/13/2008,Enbrel

It lasts about 4-5 days and is extremely itchy; benedryl doesn't seem to make a difference.  My previous 3-4 sites also flare up with each injection.  The injections really burn on my thighs but are fine in my abdomen.",I've only been taking it for 1.5 months and typically have flare-ups every 3 months so am still waiting to see if I don't have a flare-up.

424, 5, Rheumatoid Arthritis,My mouth was filled with a strong medicinal taste 15 minutes after I took my first Sureclick injection in my thigh_ and I felt a sharp kind of contraction in the area of my heart_ all of which startled and scared me. I've not had that reaction since. I've also noticed a faint slightly bitter medicinal odor that emanates from my flesh.,This medicine helped me (advanced RA) from the very first injection_ so it was apparent how powerful it was. It really eliminates pain and swelling in an incredible way. Injecting is difficult for me_ though Sureclicks make it as easy as possible. I've only had 7 injections_ and twice I stopped for 2 weeks as I had to undergo dental work_ and I wanted the antibiotics that I must take for protection of my knee implants to be working. Not sure about the efficacy of antibiotics when on Enbrel. I sometimes think that weekly injections might be too much. Could go a bit longer between shots. This is strong medicine_ but something like a miracle_ barring the side effects which_ upon reading_ make one say a prayer.,F,62,2  days,12/1/2007,Enbrel

449, 5, psoriatic arthritis + psoriasis,I quell injection site stings by icing site before and after injecting. Enbrel is a life-saver for me. At 100mg/wk_ it retards disease process & inflammation_ & restores my pre-illness energy level_ concentration_ alertness. Unfortunately_ HMO will not cover 100mg/wk past 1st 3 mos. for plaque psoriasis.  So I must do with 50mg/wk which retards disease/inflammation_ but stops short of fully restoring pre-illness function.,Few Drs know enough about biologics or about prescribing them to include them in treatment choices for patient relief of certain debilitating conditions. Of Drs who know of & prescribe biologics_ few apprise themselves of insurance protocols for expensive drugs_ so fail their patients by leaving them_ already handicapped by illness_ to deal alone with coverage intricacies. Benign neglect is not patient care.

When i cut my ankle in a bathroom accident_ it took about 5 months to heal completely. It got infected_ I was on antibiotics_ it oozed_ and it disturbed my psoriasis. (A dermatologist was finally able to heal it completely.) Most non-arthristis doctors don't know enough about this drug. But overall_ it's been great at treating my aching finger and knee joints. I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons.,,M,42,3  years,1/4/2007,Enbrel
469, 5, psoratic arthritis,If i get a head cold_ or flu it lasts for 7 days and hits me hard.,I started enbrel with such terrible pain in my joints. It took 3 days and it was gone. One 50ml shot a week. Its the best_ but expensive. I haven't had to deal with the pain in my fingers and toes ever since I started taking enbrel. One small prick a week aint nothin.,M,28,4  years,1/2/2007,Enbrel
470, 4, Plaque Psoriasis,Redness and itching at injection site for about a week after injecting. Some hardness at injection site a few days to 2 weeks after injection.,Very Helpful to rotate on each thigh and side of abdomen.  Thighs are less painful but harder to plunge the medication_ abdomen is easier to go in but hurts a bit more.  Had severe plaque psoriasis on about 60% of my body.  Noticed significant improvement after just 2 weeks and has continued to improve.,F,26,9  weeks,1/2/2007,Enbrel
471, 4, psoriatic arthritis/connective tiss,Very severe stomach pain. Up all night and still sick the next two days.  Great. Works wonderfully on joint pain but gives me miserable stomach pain. Don't know if I'll be able to continue on it.,Anyone suffer similarly?,F,56,7  days,11/26/2006Email,Enbrel
472, 5, RA,Other than the injection stings_ this is a WONDER DRUG I have had reactions from every drug they prescribed for me until now.,I had to argue with the insurance company for 6 months before they would approve my prescription but this drug has give me a new lease on life I am beginning to feel like my old self again. I did not realize how sick I was until I started feeling better. Have had 6 injections. I am off all other meds I have energy now. I was a very enthusastic_ independent_ and energetic person until about a year and a half ago_ then I began to tire easily_ and had to have help most of the time to open a door or what ever I can actually open my own cokes now.,F,49,6  weeks,11/12/2006Email,Enbrel
473, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,None,This drug has enhanced my life. I am very active I have had this condition for 16 years.,M,43,2  years,11/6/2006,Enbrel
474, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis & Psoriasis,"I have used it since I was 12_ about 8 years. I attempted to use the ""new"" Enbrel_ the one you only have to give yourself one injection for_ and it burned horribly. I now use the older version.",It was tough to get over the initial fear of giving myself shots at a young age. But it really does work...as long as you take them regularly.,F,20,8  years,11/4/2006Email,Enbrel
475, 4, Ankylosing Spondylitis,rash on a large portion of my body_ excessive warts on my hands (never had a wart before)_ allergies to my dog (which I've never been allergic to before),Enbrel's worked wonders on my joints. I've been able to run and exercise for the first time in about 5 years_ so the side effects are more of a nuisance than anything.,M,22,9  months,11/1/2006Email,Enbrel
476, 3, Rhuematoid Arthritis,I had no injection sites rashes the first two times I used it. I have used it for a couple of months now and I get a rash every time so far_ usually a couple of days later. I have also felt tired almost like a flue like feeling. The 4th time I used it_ I had a severe headache. The injection site gets red_ swollen and tender and hot to the touch. The injection also stings quite a bit. I want to continue taking it because I have not had any flare-ups so far.,,F,50,2  months,10/26/2006Email,Enbrel
477, 4, Rheumatoid arthritis,Almost always get injection site rash & use Benadryl cream. First injection; very mild headache.  2nd injection (by me): panic attack.  3 - 11: noticed psychological changes_ different state of mind_ mostly ok_ until another panic attack (had suffered these at college age_ but I'm 55 now).  Stopped for 6 weeks_ then started up again. Have stopped for possible infection a couple of times_ but have always started again.  Now I'm getting some little itchy spots_ almost like bugbites_ on my legs_ not sure if it's Enbrel or not.  Will be watching it.  But it has helped me very much. I still take Celebrex every other day as well_ and occasionally Benadryl (either for sleep or itching or both!),I don't mind injecting myself. In fact_ I like it_ because I can do it on my own schedule (and not drive 67 miles to the nearest Rheumatologist for Remicade...! Half the cost of Remicade too_ although I do have a co-pay).  I recommend trying it!,F,55,17  months,9/1/2006Email,Enbrel
478, 5, Psoratic Arthritis,Just Injection site rash 1 day after shot_ sometimes headache.,Cant wait to get the Quick shot they just came out with!,F,24,7  months,8/15/2006Email,Enbrel
479, 5, RA,"No ""known"" side effects. Recent trip to Emergency room with chest pains and irregular heart rythym makes me wonder if Enbrel is the culprit??",Almost complete joint swelling & pain relief within 24 hours of first injection.,F,56,2  months,6/28/2006,Enbrel
480, 5, Ankylosing Spondylitis,1st shot went pretty well_ stung a bit_ no rash. 2nd week_ 2nd shot_ I developed a rash at both injection sites 4 days later. Yes_ a rash appeared where the 1st shot was injected 2 weeks prior. Apparantly_ this has happened to approx 7% of Enbrel patients_ but the rash is not unbearable_ and I will continue to take it.,I can honestly say I feel so much better_ my joints are not so tight anymore. I can stand for more than 10 minutes now.,F,27,3  weeks,6/22/2006Email,Enbrel
481, 3, RA,About 1 day after my second dose had mild flu like symptoms and headache. Joints were feeling better. 2 days after second dose noticed leg fatigue_ chest heaviness_ high BP. Went to ED. Labs showed no cardiac problem. Rheum MD is unsure if these are associated with the Enbrel or not. Has anyone else experienced this?,,F,41,7  days,6/1/2006,Enbrel
482, 5, psoriatic arthritis,none,I have been taking enbrel 1 shot per week for 3 years and I love it!  I hate giving myself the shot but it is better than the alternative.  I had sausage fingers the week I started the first injection and within days they were almost normal.  Has not really helped my psorasis,F,36,3  years,5/24/2006,Enbrel
483, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Some pain with injection. Chills and fatigue if I miss a dose.,LOVE IT! (when taken with the MTX) Worked almost immediately (a week or two) to resolve the crippling joint pain and swelling. The new once weekly is easier to do since it's all premeasured and mixed- but BOY does it sting!,F,34,3.5  years,5/22/2006,Enbrel
484, 5, Ankylosing spondilitis,None other than a slightly smaller bank balance.,My rating for this medication is only when taken in conjunction with methotrexate.  It rates only about a 2 when taken alone.  This medication made all the difference for me.  Instead of constant flare ups I now only get maybe four or five a month.  I also have only had one bout of irisitis (inflammation of the colored part of the eye) since taking it whereas I used to get it at least once a month.,M,38,8  years,1/10/2006Email,Enbrel
485, 3, Plaque Psoriasis,Rash and pruritis_ (itching) at injection sites; rashes on other areas of body; skin eruptions at various body sites; generalized pruritis.,I have had severe plaque psoriasis on my hands.  Have been taking this drug twice a week for about two months now consistently.  I see some improvement in my hands_ but have a very bumpy rash that appears almost like another outbreak of psoriasis at injection sites on my arms_ my legs itch too.  I also have a rash on my chin just below my mouth.  The injections burn going in.  I still have the plaque psoriasis though not as severe. I keep waiting for it to really kick in.,F,55,2  months,12/30/2005,Enbrel
486, 5, Rheumatoid arthritis,no side effects i can be sure of,injections are no fun...take two shots once a week instead of the twice a week plan. seems to work almost as well. has really helped with my quality of life. worry about the day i won't have health insurance - this is not an affordable drug. Also_ travelling can be a drag. if the stuff gets warm it's no good.  i just double dose the week before i go and the first week back.,F,43,5  years,11/11/2005,Enbrel
487, 5, Sero neg Rheumatoid arthritis,painful joints   couldn't pick up glass of water without severe pain.  Large doses of prednisone only relief.  Tried Methotrexate_ Plaquinel etc.Normal life back,,F,44,3  days,11/8/2005,Enbrel

489, 5, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease,After 5 years of 100% relief_ am now getting serious infections and will need to get off drug (regrettably).  This is a known side effect.

490, 4, Rheum Arthritis,None so far {5 weekly injections]. Supposed to take weekly_ but I stretch to between 8 and 9 days intervals.,Seems to be working...am 50-60% improved over nothing_ and can open jar lids_ open cans_ drive.
