1, 5, Stop Smoking,Headache_ kind of like a dizzy-spacey feeling in the head_ trouble staying asleep_ anxiety,I gave Zyban a rating of 5 because it helped me to stop smoking_ but I would not recommend Zyban. The side effects are just too many and too strong. I took 1 tablet a day for 3 days and then started 2x a day_ that was the day I quit. I had 3 cigarettes and the last one tasted so foul_ so metallic_ I just put it out and haven't smoked since. I can't say I don't have an occasional urge_ but the urge is small and I can basically just say no to the urge_ and it simply goes away. I guess it gives different people different side effects_ but it did work for me.,M,48,7  days150 MG 2X D,3/18/2016,Zyban

3, 5, to quit smoking,vertigo_ dry mouth_ constipation_ anxiety_ weird dreams,Zyban was a miracle. I used it to quit smoking 13+ years ago on the  recommendation of my doc. the first week I experienced a lot of side effects_ including anxiety around those side effects_ but a friend who had taken Wellbutrin previous to my treatment assured me that the side effects would lessen once my body became acclimated to the drug_ and convinced me to give it a week to 10 days. My directions had been to set a Quit Date but to continue smoking_ and begin taking the medication. At around Day 3 or 4_ my cigs started tasting strange... kind of like when you smoke a brand that isn't your own brand. I started smoking less and less as the cigarettes didn't really appear to be doing anything... they tasted bland and flat. By Day 10 (my Quit Day)_ I basically had lost interest in smoking. That was in March of 2002_ and I haven't smoked since. I should add here that I had a very strong intention to quit smoking. I wanted to become a non-smoker after watching my father die of emphysema and my mother several years earlier die of acute pulmonary disease and pneumonia which she did not recover from because of her smoking. I had smoked for 32 years. This drug saved my life.,F,61,30  days150mg 2X D,10/3/2015Email,Zyban

9, 4, BiPola Stubborn Depression,I am not sure. As my psych. stopped me cold turkey off Cymbalta_ which cause a horrible few weeks. Plus to start Zyban at the same time.   So not sure which was which.,Approx 3 weeks I felt abit better_ by 5 weeks abit more. The thing for me was to help with the stubborn depression. TZyban has given me an interest and energy I have not felt in years.  I'm only on 150mg  at morning.  Because of my BiPola i am watched_ but mania is not really a problem.  I am on Zyban and Zoloft- two antidepressants but of difference make up.  I do have a good doctor- why oh why I was told to go off Cymbalta cold turkey_ is beyond me.  But other than this_  my doctor is pretty on the ball.  I am on four medications. Zyban and Zoloft_ I requested the Zoloft.  These two have just been the final ingredient in me having a life.   Don't listen to rumours.  I am BiPola and for me_ two antidepressants work great and for me is possible to take.,F,46,8  weeks 1X D,11/23/2014,Zyban

11, 5, Smoking and Depression,Apart from a dry mouth this medication works better than any other antidepressants i have tried and i have stopped smoking.It was originally an antidepressant.Works better than the SSRIs and no weight gain. It has be remarketed as anti smoking drug after trials for it as an antidepressant found that people stopped smoking_ its also a weight loss drug. Do your research it is Bupropion Hydrochloride. Wellbutrin in America. Zyban in Australia. And sold under other names. Doctors keep pushing SSRIs as Antidepressants and they make you fat.,,F,44,1  months150,10/30/2014,Zyban

14, 4, To stop smoking,I read all of the side effects and start freaking out... but I must say that my experiences are a little different. I had bad anxiety before the meds_ I still have the anxiety_ but it doesn't bother me? if that makes sense? I have really blurred vision_ thought my prescription glasses were suddenly broken. But I am still functional.. as for libido_ I have a hardcore sex drive_ always have_ but I find it difficult to actually get an erection and to ejaculate.. A HUGE problem for me is the dry mouth_ which is causing severe Halitosis (bad breath) .. to the point where my boyfriend can't have my mouth near his.. It is as though the bad breath from the dry mouth is worse than the stench from the smoking.. he has assured me that it is indeed really bad.. so I'm gonna try Therabreath products till I am done with these pills. Dreaming.. I have amazing_ vivid dreams. I love this side effect because I NEVER!!! remember my dreams_ and now I am having 3 - 4 every night.. is amazing.. Have a tad b,I love this product... have tried cold turkey many times_ as well as Allen Carr's book_ which helped a lot with the mindset_ but not with the physical withdrawal symptoms of quitting. I find it incredibly easy to not smoke_ I stopped sooner than I should have as well_ it's weird_ just wasn't enjoying it.. So the bad breath and the lack of stress is the worst for me? My boyfriend won't come near me and I don't get any work done.... but it's not for long.. then I will be free from this mistake (smoking) forever.,M,22,5  weeks 2X D,5/26/2014,Zyban
15, 5, Severe depression,Brief dry mouth initial sleeplessness while dose was split between morning and evening. This ceased when changed to one dose per day. Slight tingling at back of tongue.,I need to take dose early in morning_ around 6am or I experience difficulty sleeping. Have noticed certain amount of emotional lability but this is minor and may be due to being able to feel again after being so flat. No decrease appetite. Gone off wine and beer. No pain or increase in dream intensity. Able to get up in morning and achieve tasks set for day. No longer napping during day. Concentration improved. Motivation improved.This drug certainly works well for me. Please note_ most people will complain if dissatisfied and almost no one will compliment if they are happy with product. There are millions out there happy with zyban but can't be bothered to say so.I will monitor for any changes with longer term use.,F,51,28  days450 1X D,1/22/2014Email,Zyban

18, 5, Smoking cessation,Slight nausea the first two days_ deceased appetite. That is it.  Yesterday (day 4) I noticed that I was no longer feeling pleasure from smoking. Went to a bonfire and everyone around me was drinking and smoking_ and I had one cigarette the whole 5 hours_ and that was just out of habit. Normally I would have probably had 8-10 standing outside like that. I do not crave AT ALL. I am very pleased! As you can tell_ I have been in  good mood_ no mood swings_ no bad thoughts. I know this drug isn't for everyone_ but it's definitely for me.,,F,27,5  days150 mg x 2,9/14/2013,Zyban

20, 4, To stop smoking/lite depression,Please read the paperwork that comes with your prescription.  I see people on here complaining and acting like they are totally surprised with the side effects.  It's right there in the insert what side effects you may get.  Don't blame your doctor/pharmacist because you did not ask questions.  Some side effects are related to nicotine withdrawal.  I myself am on day 6 and have had some sleeplessness_ awesome sex_ dry mouth_ and weight loss(yay me).  I'm okay with it as long as I can quit the cancer sticks.,If you're taking 2 a day_ make sure you take one pill early in the am and another around 3pm. Talk to your pharmacist about the side effects.  I'm going to see this through.,F,36,6  days150 2X D,6/23/2013Email,Zyban
21, 5, To Assist with Nicotine Addiction,Vivid dreams_ dry mouth_ insomnia_ loss of appetite,I had a smoking quit date of 3 weeks after starting meds_ but quit after a week and have not had any cravings for nicotine. Reading everyone's comments_ this medication is obviously not for everyone. I would suggest that if you are trying to quit nicotine_ try Zyban for a day or two. If you are getting side effects that are unbearable to you_ then stop taking it. For me_ I can handle the side effects. It is worth having the side effects than to go back to smoking.,F,43,20  days150 MG 2X D,4/30/2013Email,Zyban
22, 4, Quit Smoking,For the first couple of weeks you walk around is somewhat of a dream state and small headache.  You loose alott of your appitite_ where you have to force yourself to eat.  Your skin crawls a bit and your vision is a bit blurry.  Lost a little bit of libido.,This is great I have been smoke free for 3 weeks. Im going to finish this program because I really want to quit smoking.  I have been smoking for over 20+ years.    The side effects lesson the longer you are on it so I would recommend to stick with it .... if you have to take a vacation from work to get through  the  first 2 weeks_ do it.  Its worth the effort to be smokefree!,M,40,3  weeks300MG 2X D,9/28/2012,Zyban
23, 1, Quit Smoking,Forgetfulness_ absence of perception_ jitter_ spasm in the muscles_ ache in the eyes_ TINNITUS (RINGING OF EARS)_ NUISANCE and INTESTINAL DISORDERPLEASE READ THIS_ I THOUGHT I WAS DYING!!I smoke one pack of cigs per day for 3 years. I have tried every single thing and finally I have learned Zyban_ I have read some comments on the internet and bought it.,During first 5 days on Zyban_ I experienced forgetfulness and absence of perception. I have thought I can bear these symptoms . Then I started to be scared of almost everything_ from crowded places_ cars etc. Anyway_ I didnt care about this. On day 13_ when I was alone in my room to sleep at night_ my two ears started to ring terribly. At first I didnt think this is the side effect of the drug. Then on day 14_ at night_ I experienced same things_ this time I couldn?t sleep due to ringings in my ears. After I have slept_ I woke up every one half hour or something like that. The following morning_ on day 15_ I thought this may be side effect of Zyban_ I still took the drug. On that day_ at night_ I have looked up internet_ and learned that tinnitus is a very serious symptom. I decided to give up the drug_ and then again tried to sleep with the bells on my ear. At night_ I felt jitters on my arms and legs and there was secretion in my ears.This morning_ day 16_ when I woke up my muscles on my legs and arms were stiff_ there was an ache on my neck. Today I didnt take the drugs_ about two hours ago I had a severe nuisance and intestinal disorder. My face went white and I was so scared that I thought I was dying. My abdomen was bloating_ there was a slight ache on my stomach. After half an hour_ I went to toilet I had constipation. Then again I went to toilet and this time I had diarrhea. I felt terrible but relieved as the ache and bloating on my abdomen was gone. I am still,F,23,16  days150 mg 2X D,9/10/2012Email,Zyban
24, 5, nicotine addiction,First few days were interesting with bouts of mumbling speech and my eyes felt as though they were crossed.  When the dosage increase happened is when things really got fun_ couldn't sleep or maybe I did just not sure.  The third through the eighth day of the increased dosage I was high as hell.  Finished up a lot of projects that needed finishing. The wierd part was that during the first few days i chewed and smoked like a mad man and when I woke up on the fourth day not even a thought about nicotine.  Dont want any and cant stand the smell of cigarettes or chew. Since day nine its been smooth sailing and I have no major concerns about my mental or physical health.,Absolutely necessary to stay hydrated while using Zyban.  I am drinking about a gallon and a half of water (beyond other fluids) a day which is about a half gallon more then usual.  May seem like a lot but my job requires a lot of physical activity so hydration is key.  Nutrition is also important I will force myself to eat regarless of how hungry I may be.  Without regular food intake I'm sure the side effects would be worse.  When I say nutrition Im talking about real food not processed food or anything from a fast food joint or restaurant.  Your only going to feel as good as the substances that your ingesting.  So minus the pills eat good and stay hydrated!!!!!!! Good luck and know your limitations if its to much for you stop using this drug.  Use your common sense simple as that.,M,29,19  days150MG 2X D,9/7/2012Email,Zyban

27, 5, Quit smoking,felt really sleepy the first week as the drug worked it's way into my system and felt quite disconnected_ that's the best way to describe it_ I waited for 7 days before upping the dosage to twice daily_ for 2 nights I barely slept and felt sick but that passed and those are the only side effects I had,i smoked like crazy for the first 9 days on Zyban and panicked that it wasn't working_ woke up on day 10 and haven't touched a cig since then_ haven't had any cravings or withdrawal symptoms or side effects_ I have about 2 weeks left to go but regularly forget to take the meds so cant see much of a problem coming off them but I will finish the course. All in it's worked for me so I think it's great_ my GP was brilliant he was very up front about possible side effects_ if there were any mental illness or depression issues etc_ good luck to anyone who gives it a go_ hope it works as well for you as it did for me :),F,40,7  weeks300mg 2X D,7/15/2012Email,Zyban

32, 5, Smoking cessation,disturbed sleep_ vivid dreams and occassional nightmares_ blurred vision and dizziness at times_ hot flashes_ quick to anger_ lack of emotion and listless feeling at times,Although this drug has side effects_ they were tolerable overall. I would not have been able to quit smoking without it!! I have tried several times and always broke down with severe cravings. Once I started taking zyban_ I had no cravings and wasnt aggitated like before. When I did smoke_ didnt really have the same effect so stopped wanting them after the actual habitual part wore off. I experienced some nicotine withdrawl symptons at first but knew what they were and not side effects of zyban. The worst part for me was not getting good sleep at night. I need a full 8 hours and was unable to get this. I had no problem falling asleep but unable to stay asleep for 2-3 hours out of the night no matter how hard I tried!  Stopping after 2 months of therapy....had my first cigarette last week and couldnt stand the taste of it and had absolutely no effect on me.  Ready to go it on my own and get some good REM sleep back.,F,38,2  months300mg 1X D,4/5/2012Email,Zyban

Constipation_ butterfly rash_ hot flashes_ insomnia_ loss of appetite. agressiveness and rage.,I came online to see these were some side effects. But I was so ready to quit smoking I made myself stick to it. I quit on Day 16. And am 4 days into no cigarettes or nicotine. I am happy_ but I am having severe insomnia. Which is not good. I have a regular sleep pattern and I absolutely need 8 hours sleep. I've been getting like 3 hours a night and the rest of the night I try and try to go back to sleep. I think I'll hang on for another week or two. But I think I will go off the Zyban. But it is amazing how I do not even crave a smoke even being around it at the bar. Also having some lapse in memory.

38, 2, Depression,Initially I felt an increase in energy and some insomnia_ though I felt like springing out of bed on only a small amount of sleep/broken sleep. My libido went from nothing to closer to the days of when I was a randy 20 year old! Constipation set in quickly but I put up with it because my mood actually felt better than on the ssri's (my last one I'd been on before zyban was cipramil/celexa.) However I noticed a terrible rage creeping up on me after about the first week_ then feelings of depression and the 'logicality' of taking my own life. To me_ not worth it and I have felt better since stopping. By the way_ my appetite increased and I couldn't stop eating contrary to other peoples experiences. Resulting weight gain!,As one of the few Aussies who has attempted this for depression (in America it is called Wellbutrin and is marketed for depression and mostly taken for this) I can say that despite initially feeling a bit better (first few days) this was for me a very dangerous and insidious drug. My libido shot up so much I spent an interstate holiday looking for sex shops so I could buy a toy rather than sightseeing (I kid you not!) I enjoyed this side effect after years of lack of interest. Within a few days of stopping its still through the roof! But the downside was an out of control rage and genuine feelings of worsened depression to the point I calmly began to plan my demise. I have felt heaps better since the three days ago when I stopped cold turkey. Check out the 'Wellbutrin' reviews on this site. Who knows it could be your wonder drug for depression/smoking cessation but please take care if you have pre-existing depression. Get family to moniter you and present at Casualty if you are planning suicide. Your family and friends will be devastated if this drug takes you from them!!

43, 5, stop smoking,I have been a smoker for 40 years. Struggling to quit for 20 years. I took Zyban 6 years ago and after 3 days had lost interest in smoking. Never smoked since. Cannot remember side effects they cannot have been that serious HOWEVER_ I had a serious episode on the last day of the treatment. I became enraged at a neighbour who had been giving me a hard  time for 5 years and I went in his garden and destroyed it_ like the Incredible Hulk.  Next thing I know_ I wake up in bed with total memory loss of the last 20 minutes.,I have a question. SInce I quit smoking with Zyban_ (6 years)  I have been a different person. No enthusiasm for life _ no interest in doing anything. I used to be very active_ I now spend my time reading and playing with computer. Not depressed_ just going through the motions_ without any real motivation. Is it possible that ZYban has permanently affected my brain? affecting the reward centres ? Anyone with the same experience_  months after quitting with Zyban ?ALso a message to all of you who feel depressed. I have stopped smoking many times_ cold turkey or with patches and everytime I would feel very angry. Within days I would hate my life and everyone in it and feel  suicidal. It is the nicotine withdrawal. No Zyban.   Talk to your GP. Get antidepression pills. Nicotine addiction is very serious and there are a lot of withdrawal side effects -physical and emotional.

47, 4, quit smoking,vivid dreams_ some insomnia_ dry mouth and nose_ will cry sometimes even though I don't really feel that upset about a situation.,I am still smoking but much less_ I plan to quit on day 10 and use the nicotine patch if I feel the need. I have found that the pill has curbed the anxiousness I would feel when I had not had a cigarette for a while. I can go 4 or 5 hours now without a cigarette and not want to hurt someone. I think you need to want to quit for it to work but for me that nicotine low after several hours was really what scared me about quitting and so far Zyban really helps with that and has given me more confidence in myself that I can quit.,F,41,6  days150 1X D,11/5/2011Email,Zyban
48, 5, Smoking,Constantly feeling sick and dizzy_ though not been sick. Cannot sleep_ only get a few hours each night_ so am also very tired. Fealt a bit jumpy and restless and have been a bit short with people and more ready to argue the toss etc. Cant get a hard on etc.,Stopped smoking on day 8 without really noticing or thinking about it. Have not had any problems like wanting a cig so far after 4 weeks. Side effects are very real and could put some people off using this_ but in my case I am glad I took it_ though cannot wait for the doctor to say I dont need it any more.,M,55,28  days150 2X D,10/24/2011Email,Zyban

50, 5, stop smoking/mild depression,ears ringing is my biggest complaint. absentminded. trouble sleeping.,the first week taking zyban_ i felt very jittery. that has subsided.  the ringing of my ears is so loud that i have to fall asleep to the tv loud to drown it out. i wake up often (every 2 hours and up for 30 mins-an hour at a time). the first time i wake up_ i feel like i've gotten a good nights sleep_ but have only slept 2 hours. it's then hard to fall back asleep because i'm not tired. this goes on until i finally give up at 5:30am. this happens every night. HOWEVER_ i otherwise feel wonderful!! i've been a half a pack a day smoker for 20 years. i'm now down to 3. no desire to smoke_ and when i do_ it's not fulfilling at all. i can only get through half a cigarette and realize that it was a stupid choice and it didn't do anything for me anyway...when i tried to quit smoking before_ caving in and having a cigarette felt wonderful! now_ it's not enjoyable. my mood has also improved. i've taken anti depressants before and know that sometimes my mood can get worse before it gets better when taking them. this did not happen with me on zyban. i'm quite content and optimistic. i think that there are far more good experiences with zyban than bad. it wouldn't be on the market if it the majority had the issues that i'm seeing on here. i have some side effects that i'm not fond of. but it's temporary_ and if the end result that i'm no longer smoking_ then i'll be happy to have ringing ears and sleepless nights for a few more weeks.,F,34,23  days150mg 2X D,10/19/2011Email,Zyban
51, 3, Quit Smoking,Insomnia_ Aggressiveness_ Dry & itchy throat_ Coughing_ Brain feels tight (if that makes any sense) and so does skin on skull_ thinking not 100% clear_ mild feeling of depression.,Been taking the drug for about a month now and I still haven't stop smoking but it definitely suppresses the cravings. I've slept 6 hrs in 3 days and when I try to sleep every little noise gets me really aggravated to a point where I feel like destroying everything around me and when I get up I'm angry and irritated all day. I think I might stop taking this drug as of today but I'm still willing to give it an other week in hopes that I'll stop smoking and that the aggression and sleeplessness will go away.,M,30,30  days150 2X D,10/14/2011Email,Zyban
52, 1, stop smoking,migraines_ dizziness_ paranoid_ no sleep_ no libido_ agressive_ listless_ no emotion_ zombie_ shaking_ cold sweats. Disorientataion_ forgetfull,This product should not be on the market. Zyban nearly ruined my life.It has taken me more than 2 weeks to recover from the side effects of zyban. I have had the most excrutiating migraines that have led to nausea and vomiting. I have experienced cold shivers and cold sweats to name a few of the symptoms I experienced. There were only two side effects listed that I did not experience. Do not take Zyban it will ruin your life or kill you(suicidal),M,33,2  weeks150mg 2X D,10/9/2011Email,Zyban
53, 5, Quit Smoking,since the first day_ i have had a lot of energy. im not as impulsive and i notice myself paying attention more frequently. smoking isnt as pleasurable and im simply feeling as though im just going through the physiological routine of it now_ rather than getting any satisfaction from it. i had a few glasses of wine a few days ago and noticed my tolerance had decreased. i am at times feeling irritable but for the most part these brief phases throughout the day pass. also_ like clockwork_ in the evening i am getting headaches that end just as quick as they begin. im also feeling an increase in my libido. at first_ i was a little more spacy at times but this seems to be passing as well.,i dont know why other comments on this thread are so negative: so far_ and its only been a week_ i love this drug! i have so much energy and i dont sit around fretting about stuff throughout my day: i just get it done. i can focus without worrying about anything_ too. there really is so much satisfaction in being able to feel like my day was filled with a checklist of accomplishments. so far_ this is proving to be an absolutely great drug.,M,31,1  weeks150 MG 2X D,9/27/2011,Zyban
54, 3, Quitting smoking,Dry mouth_ anxiousness in the first few days. Light headedness starting on day 13_ complete panic attack and depression by day 14.,I started taking this pill 2 per day from the beginning. I felt a bit antsy the first few days_ but I am kind of antsy to begin with. Besides the dry mouth I felt pretty normal. My desire for cigarettes decreased and didnt really enjoy having them when I did. I quit smoking on day 11. Day 13 in the evening I felt light headed_ but nothing to strange. Day 14 I was extremely light headed in the morning_ and by after noon I was crying uncontrollabley and my blood pressure was through the roof. I could not understand why I couldnt stop crying and I was in a very happy mood earlier that day. My mood decreased and became very depressed and wanted to cry. I have not taken any since then_ that was 3 days ago and I still don't feel myself. I have not smoked since_ but I beleive my strong desire to not smoke is what has kept me from doing it. The zyban definitley helped in the beginning.. was it worth it.. I don't think so. I became a person I dont recognize and unfortunatley did and said things I cant take back now. Not worth it. My moods have  been up and down since then and contemplated if I even wanted to exist in this world for a few days. I would not touch this drug ever ever again.,F,28,14  days150 Mg 2X D,9/20/2011Email,Zyban
55, 1, Smoking Cessation,I took Zyban (bupropion) over six months ago to quit smoking. I relapsed about six weeks ago after some significant stress in my life. About two weeks into this last round my throat became sore to the point that I saw the Dr. Negative throat culture but Doctor felt something going on-extremely swollen glands_ small lesions on tonsils. Gave me Z-pac-no help. It never dawned on me until 2 days ago that my sore throat coincided with starting this drug. My throat was constantly_ excruciatingly sore for 6 weeks!! I quit the Zyban and within 24 hours my sore throat was gone,I also had vague symptoms such as sexual dysfunction_ short term memory loss_ chills_ cough_ headaches,F,39,6  weeks75mg 2X D,9/4/2011Email,Zyban

57, 1, to quit smoking,DID NOT alter my desire to smoke.  Matter of fact I felt obsessed about smoking_ more than prior to meds.  Severe anxiety_ internal tremors_ shaking_ depersonalization_ fear_ paranoia_ racing thoughts_ insomnia_ nausea_ loss of appetite_ feeling completely CRAZY and unstable _ crying outbursts_ anger and violent. Short term memory loss_ severe. Headache_ sore throat_ got a sinus infection_ chills.,"note:  took 1 x 150 mg for 3 days_ then upped to 2 x 150 mg per day (not at same time).   First day I felt a bit weird_ my body started twitching and I could feel my pulse all over my body.  I figured it was tolerable.  Same symptoms for 3 days while on one pill/day_ with added jitters_ and some feeling of anxiety but was tolerable.   After 3 days still not feeling any change in smoking desire.  On day 4 I upped to 2 pills/day (one early_ one later) and the anxiety became tenfold.  I slept 3 hours in two days.  The only way I can describe what came next was "" a whole lot of crazy"".  I felt like I've lost my mind_ unsure of everything.  Feeling completely like I can't get through the next minute_ exasperated.  On the last day I took this med (day 6) I took only 1 pill as I thought it might lessen the effects_ and it was not any less_ I was still crazy crazy crazy.  I was terrified like I was trapped in a bad place and could not get out.  My whole body was twitching_ shaking_ headache_ nausea.  The thoughts would not slow down_ just on overdrive for everything.    Today being day 7 I am not taking any more of this medication and I feel a little better today but still feel some of the effects.  I feel more rational of mind like my real true self.  Yesterday I felt like it was someone else in control and it was SOO bad_ oh so bad.  I had a lot of struggle just getting through every moment of the day yesterday. Still craved cigs whole time. Will try patch next.",F,42,6  days150-/300 2X D,8/5/2011,Zyban
58, 1, Quit smoking,Ringing in the ears (Tinnitus). An extremely stiff neck (needed a massage to release tension). My face felt like it was sun burnt and skin peeled off. Hives on my neck and shoulders. De-personolised feeling....agitated_ very depressed. Aching feet. Insomnia_ nightmares...the list goes on!!,On the positive side I think that taking the Zyban suppresed my cravings for a ciggie_ and I felt ok for about the first 3 or 4 days_ then I stepped up the dose to 2 x 150mg per day after a week_ this is when the side effects really kicked in. I thought maybe it was just me reacting to this drug_ but obviously not!! I stopped taking the Zyban after 3 weeks_ as I felt so bad....this should be a happy time having kicked a 40 year habit_ but I felt worse than before I quit. The good news is I have been ciggie free for a month now_ and slowly feeling better in myself. I read on the net that it takes a week or more for the drug to clear itself from the body once stopped. I would be reluctant to recommend taking Zyban.,M,55,3  weeks150mg 2X D,7/28/2011Email,Zyban
