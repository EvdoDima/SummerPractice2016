1, 5, Stop Smoking,Headache_ kind of like a dizzy-spacey feeling in the head_ trouble staying asleep_ anxiety,I gave Zyban a rating of 5 because it helped me to stop smoking_ but I would not recommend Zyban. The side effects are just too many and too strong. I took 1 tablet a day for 3 days and then started 2x a day_ that was the day I quit. I had 3 cigarettes and the last one tasted so foul_ so metallic_ I just put it out and haven't smoked since. I can't say I don't have an occasional urge_ but the urge is small and I can basically just say no to the urge_ and it simply goes away. I guess it gives different people different side effects_ but it did work for me.,M,48,7  days150 MG 2X D,3/18/2016,Zyban

3, 5, to quit smoking,vertigo_ dry mouth_ constipation_ anxiety_ weird dreams,Zyban was a miracle. I used it to quit smoking 13+ years ago on the  recommendation of my doc. the first week I experienced a lot of side effects_ including anxiety around those side effects_ but a friend who had taken Wellbutrin previous to my treatment assured me that the side effects would lessen once my body became acclimated to the drug_ and convinced me to give it a week to 10 days. My directions had been to set a Quit Date but to continue smoking_ and begin taking the medication. At around Day 3 or 4_ my cigs started tasting strange... kind of like when you smoke a brand that isn't your own brand. I started smoking less and less as the cigarettes didn't really appear to be doing anything... they tasted bland and flat. By Day 10 (my Quit Day)_ I basically had lost interest in smoking. That was in March of 2002_ and I haven't smoked since. I should add here that I had a very strong intention to quit smoking. I wanted to become a non-smoker after watching my father die of emphysema and my mother several years earlier die of acute pulmonary disease and pneumonia which she did not recover from because of her smoking. I had smoked for 32 years. This drug saved my life.,F,61,30  days150mg 2X D,10/3/2015Email,Zyban

9, 4, BiPola Stubborn Depression,I am not sure. As my psych. stopped me cold turkey off Cymbalta_ which cause a horrible few weeks. Plus to start Zyban at the same time.   So not sure which was which.,Approx 3 weeks I felt abit better_ by 5 weeks abit more. The thing for me was to help with the stubborn depression. TZyban has given me an interest and energy I have not felt in years.  I'm only on 150mg  at morning.  Because of my BiPola i am watched_ but mania is not really a problem.  I am on Zyban and Zoloft- two antidepressants but of difference make up.  I do have a good doctor- why oh why I was told to go off Cymbalta cold turkey_ is beyond me.  But other than this_  my doctor is pretty on the ball.  I am on four medications. Zyban and Zoloft_ I requested the Zoloft.  These two have just been the final ingredient in me having a life.   Don't listen to rumours.  I am BiPola and for me_ two antidepressants work great and for me is possible to take.,F,46,8  weeks 1X D,11/23/2014,Zyban

11, 5, Smoking and Depression,Apart from a dry mouth this medication works better than any other antidepressants i have tried and i have stopped smoking.It was originally an antidepressant.Works better than the SSRIs and no weight gain. It has be remarketed as anti smoking drug after trials for it as an antidepressant found that people stopped smoking_ its also a weight loss drug. Do your research it is Bupropion Hydrochloride. Wellbutrin in America. Zyban in Australia. And sold under other names. Doctors keep pushing SSRIs as Antidepressants and they make you fat.,,F,44,1  months150,10/30/2014,Zyban

14, 4, To stop smoking,I read all of the side effects and start freaking out... but I must say that my experiences are a little different. I had bad anxiety before the meds_ I still have the anxiety_ but it doesn't bother me? if that makes sense? I have really blurred vision_ thought my prescription glasses were suddenly broken. But I am still functional.. as for libido_ I have a hardcore sex drive_ always have_ but I find it difficult to actually get an erection and to ejaculate.. A HUGE problem for me is the dry mouth_ which is causing severe Halitosis (bad breath) .. to the point where my boyfriend can't have my mouth near his.. It is as though the bad breath from the dry mouth is worse than the stench from the smoking.. he has assured me that it is indeed really bad.. so I'm gonna try Therabreath products till I am done with these pills. Dreaming.. I have amazing_ vivid dreams. I love this side effect because I NEVER!!! remember my dreams_ and now I am having 3 - 4 every night.. is amazing.. Have a tad b,I love this product... have tried cold turkey many times_ as well as Allen Carr's book_ which helped a lot with the mindset_ but not with the physical withdrawal symptoms of quitting. I find it incredibly easy to not smoke_ I stopped sooner than I should have as well_ it's weird_ just wasn't enjoying it.. So the bad breath and the lack of stress is the worst for me? My boyfriend won't come near me and I don't get any work done.... but it's not for long.. then I will be free from this mistake (smoking) forever.,M,22,5  weeks 2X D,5/26/2014,Zyban
15, 5, Severe depression,Brief dry mouth initial sleeplessness while dose was split between morning and evening. This ceased when changed to one dose per day. Slight tingling at back of tongue.,I need to take dose early in morning_ around 6am or I experience difficulty sleeping. Have noticed certain amount of emotional lability but this is minor and may be due to being able to feel again after being so flat. No decrease appetite. Gone off wine and beer. No pain or increase in dream intensity. Able to get up in morning and achieve tasks set for day. No longer napping during day. Concentration improved. Motivation improved.This drug certainly works well for me. Please note_ most people will complain if dissatisfied and almost no one will compliment if they are happy with product. There are millions out there happy with zyban but can't be bothered to say so.I will monitor for any changes with longer term use.,F,51,28  days450 1X D,1/22/2014Email,Zyban

18, 5, Smoking cessation,Slight nausea the first two days_ deceased appetite. That is it.  Yesterday (day 4) I noticed that I was no longer feeling pleasure from smoking. Went to a bonfire and everyone around me was drinking and smoking_ and I had one cigarette the whole 5 hours_ and that was just out of habit. Normally I would have probably had 8-10 standing outside like that. I do not crave AT ALL. I am very pleased! As you can tell_ I have been in  good mood_ no mood swings_ no bad thoughts. I know this drug isn't for everyone_ but it's definitely for me.,,F,27,5  days150 mg x 2,9/14/2013,Zyban

20, 4, To stop smoking/lite depression,Please read the paperwork that comes with your prescription.  I see people on here complaining and acting like they are totally surprised with the side effects.  It's right there in the insert what side effects you may get.  Don't blame your doctor/pharmacist because you did not ask questions.  Some side effects are related to nicotine withdrawal.  I myself am on day 6 and have had some sleeplessness_ awesome sex_ dry mouth_ and weight loss(yay me).  I'm okay with it as long as I can quit the cancer sticks.,If you're taking 2 a day_ make sure you take one pill early in the am and another around 3pm. Talk to your pharmacist about the side effects.  I'm going to see this through.,F,36,6  days150 2X D,6/23/2013Email,Zyban
21, 5, To Assist with Nicotine Addiction,Vivid dreams_ dry mouth_ insomnia_ loss of appetite,I had a smoking quit date of 3 weeks after starting meds_ but quit after a week and have not had any cravings for nicotine. Reading everyone's comments_ this medication is obviously not for everyone. I would suggest that if you are trying to quit nicotine_ try Zyban for a day or two. If you are getting side effects that are unbearable to you_ then stop taking it. For me_ I can handle the side effects. It is worth having the side effects than to go back to smoking.,F,43,20  days150 MG 2X D,4/30/2013Email,Zyban
22, 4, Quit Smoking,For the first couple of weeks you walk around is somewhat of a dream state and small headache.  You loose alott of your appitite_ where you have to force yourself to eat.  Your skin crawls a bit and your vision is a bit blurry.  Lost a little bit of libido.,This is great I have been smoke free for 3 weeks. Im going to finish this program because I really want to quit smoking.  I have been smoking for over 20+ years.    The side effects lesson the longer you are on it so I would recommend to stick with it .... if you have to take a vacation from work to get through  the  first 2 weeks_ do it.  Its worth the effort to be smokefree!,M,40,3  weeks300MG 2X D,9/28/2012,Zyban
23, 1, Quit Smoking,Forgetfulness_ absence of perception_ jitter_ spasm in the muscles_ ache in the eyes_ TINNITUS (RINGING OF EARS)_ NUISANCE and INTESTINAL DISORDERPLEASE READ THIS_ I THOUGHT I WAS DYING!!I smoke one pack of cigs per day for 3 years. I have tried every single thing and finally I have learned Zyban_ I have read some comments on the internet and bought it.,During first 5 days on Zyban_ I experienced forgetfulness and absence of perception. I have thought I can bear these symptoms . Then I started to be scared of almost everything_ from crowded places_ cars etc. Anyway_ I didnt care about this. On day 13_ when I was alone in my room to sleep at night_ my two ears started to ring terribly. At first I didnt think this is the side effect of the drug. Then on day 14_ at night_ I experienced same things_ this time I couldnt sleep due to ringings in my ears. After I have slept_ I woke up every one half hour or something like that. The following morning_ on day 15_ I thought this may be side effect of Zyban_ I still took the drug. On that day_ at night_ I have looked up internet_ and learned that tinnitus is a very serious symptom. I decided to give up the drug_ and then again tried to sleep with the bells on my ear. At night_ I felt jitters on my arms and legs and there was secretion in my ears.This morning_ day 16_ when I woke up my muscles on my legs and arms were stiff_ there was an ache on my neck. Today I didnt take the drugs_ about two hours ago I had a severe nuisance and intestinal disorder. My face went white and I was so scared that I thought I was dying. My abdomen was bloating_ there was a slight ache on my stomach. After half an hour_ I went to toilet I had constipation. Then again I went to toilet and this time I had diarrhea. I felt terrible but relieved as the ache and bloating on my abdomen was gone. I am still,F,23,16  days150 mg 2X D,9/10/2012Email,Zyban
24, 5, nicotine addiction,First few days were interesting with bouts of mumbling speech and my eyes felt as though they were crossed.  When the dosage increase happened is when things really got fun_ couldn't sleep or maybe I did just not sure.  The third through the eighth day of the increased dosage I was high as hell.  Finished up a lot of projects that needed finishing. The wierd part was that during the first few days i chewed and smoked like a mad man and when I woke up on the fourth day not even a thought about nicotine.  Dont want any and cant stand the smell of cigarettes or chew. Since day nine its been smooth sailing and I have no major concerns about my mental or physical health.,Absolutely necessary to stay hydrated while using Zyban.  I am drinking about a gallon and a half of water (beyond other fluids) a day which is about a half gallon more then usual.  May seem like a lot but my job requires a lot of physical activity so hydration is key.  Nutrition is also important I will force myself to eat regarless of how hungry I may be.  Without regular food intake I'm sure the side effects would be worse.  When I say nutrition Im talking about real food not processed food or anything from a fast food joint or restaurant.  Your only going to feel as good as the substances that your ingesting.  So minus the pills eat good and stay hydrated!!!!!!! Good luck and know your limitations if its to much for you stop using this drug.  Use your common sense simple as that.,M,29,19  days150MG 2X D,9/7/2012Email,Zyban

27, 5, Quit smoking,felt really sleepy the first week as the drug worked it's way into my system and felt quite disconnected_ that's the best way to describe it_ I waited for 7 days before upping the dosage to twice daily_ for 2 nights I barely slept and felt sick but that passed and those are the only side effects I had,i smoked like crazy for the first 9 days on Zyban and panicked that it wasn't working_ woke up on day 10 and haven't touched a cig since then_ haven't had any cravings or withdrawal symptoms or side effects_ I have about 2 weeks left to go but regularly forget to take the meds so cant see much of a problem coming off them but I will finish the course. All in it's worked for me so I think it's great_ my GP was brilliant he was very up front about possible side effects_ if there were any mental illness or depression issues etc_ good luck to anyone who gives it a go_ hope it works as well for you as it did for me :),F,40,7  weeks300mg 2X D,7/15/2012Email,Zyban

32, 5, Smoking cessation,disturbed sleep_ vivid dreams and occassional nightmares_ blurred vision and dizziness at times_ hot flashes_ quick to anger_ lack of emotion and listless feeling at times,Although this drug has side effects_ they were tolerable overall. I would not have been able to quit smoking without it!! I have tried several times and always broke down with severe cravings. Once I started taking zyban_ I had no cravings and wasnt aggitated like before. When I did smoke_ didnt really have the same effect so stopped wanting them after the actual habitual part wore off. I experienced some nicotine withdrawl symptons at first but knew what they were and not side effects of zyban. The worst part for me was not getting good sleep at night. I need a full 8 hours and was unable to get this. I had no problem falling asleep but unable to stay asleep for 2-3 hours out of the night no matter how hard I tried!  Stopping after 2 months of therapy....had my first cigarette last week and couldnt stand the taste of it and had absolutely no effect on me.

Constipation_ butterfly rash_ hot flashes_ insomnia_ loss of appetite. agressiveness and rage.,I came online to see these were some side effects. But I was so ready to quit smoking I made myself stick to it. I quit on Day 16. And am 4 days into no cigarettes or nicotine. I am happy_ but I am having severe insomnia. Which is not good. I have a regular sleep pattern and I absolutely need 8 hours sleep. I've been getting like 3 hours a night and the rest of the night I try and try to go back to sleep. I think I'll hang on for another week or two. But I think I will go off the Zyban. But it is amazing how I do not even crave a smoke even being around it at the bar. Also having some lapse in memory.

38, 2, Depression,Initially I felt an increase in energy and some insomnia_ though I felt like springing out of bed on only a small amount of sleep/broken sleep. My libido went from nothing to closer to the days of when I was a randy 20 year old! Constipation set in quickly but I put up with it because my mood actually felt better than on the ssri's (my last one I'd been on before zyban was cipramil/celexa.) However I noticed a terrible rage creeping up on me after about the first week_ then feelings of depression and the 'logicality' of taking my own life. To me_ not worth it and I have felt better since stopping. By the way_ my appetite increased and I couldn't stop eating contrary to other peoples experiences. Resulting weight gain!,As one of the few Aussies who has attempted this for depression (in America it is called Wellbutrin and is marketed for depression and mostly taken for this) I can say that despite initially feeling a bit better (first few days) this was for me a very dangerous and insidious drug. My libido shot up so much I spent an interstate holiday looking for sex shops so I could buy a toy rather than sightseeing (I kid you not!) I enjoyed this side effect after years of lack of interest. Within a few days of stopping its still through the roof! But the downside was an out of control rage and genuine feelings of worsened depression to the point I calmly began to plan my demise. I have felt heaps better since the three days ago when I stopped cold turkey. Check out the 'Wellbutrin' reviews on this site. Who knows it could be your wonder drug for depression/smoking cessation but please take care if you have pre-existing depression. Get family to moniter you and present at Casualty if you are planning suicide. Your family and friends will be devastated if this drug takes you from them!!

43, 5, stop smoking,I have been a smoker for 40 years. Struggling to quit for 20 years. I took Zyban 6 years ago and after 3 days had lost interest in smoking. Never smoked since. Cannot remember side effects they cannot have been that serious HOWEVER_ I had a serious episode on the last day of the treatment. I became enraged at a neighbour who had been giving me a hard  time for 5 years and I went in his garden and destroyed it_ like the Incredible Hulk.  Next thing I know_ I wake up in bed with total memory loss of the last 20 minutes.,I have a question. SInce I quit smoking with Zyban_ (6 years)  I have been a different person. No enthusiasm for life _ no interest in doing anything. I used to be very active_ I now spend my time reading and playing with computer. Not depressed_ just going through the motions_ without any real motivation. Is it possible that ZYban has permanently affected my brain? affecting the reward centres ? Anyone with the same experience_  months after quitting with Zyban ?ALso a message to all of you who feel depressed. I have stopped smoking many times_ cold turkey or with patches and everytime I would feel very angry. Within days I would hate my life and everyone in it and feel  suicidal. It is the nicotine withdrawal. No Zyban.   Talk to your GP. Get antidepression pills. Nicotine addiction is very serious and there are a lot of withdrawal side effects -physical and emotional.

47, 4, quit smoking,vivid dreams_ some insomnia_ dry mouth and nose_ will cry sometimes even though I don't really feel that upset about a situation.,I am still smoking but much less_ I plan to quit on day 10 and use the nicotine patch if I feel the need. I have found that the pill has curbed the anxiousness I would feel when I had not had a cigarette for a while. I can go 4 or 5 hours now without a cigarette and not want to hurt someone. I think you need to want to quit for it to work but for me that nicotine low after several hours was really what scared me about quitting and so far Zyban really helps with that and has given me more confidence in myself that I can quit.,F,41,6  days150 1X D,11/5/2011Email,Zyban

Fealt a bit jumpy and restless and have been a bit short with people and more ready to argue the toss etc. Cant get a hard on etc.,Stopped smoking on day 8 without really noticing or thinking about it. Have not had any problems like wanting a cig so far after 4 weeks. Side effects are very real and could put some people off using this_ but in my case I am glad I took it_ though cannot wait for the doctor to say I dont need it any more.,M,55,28  days150 2X D,10/24/2011Email,Zyban

50, 5, stop smoking/mild depression,ears ringing is my biggest complaint. absentminded. trouble sleeping.,the first week taking zyban_ i felt very jittery. that has subsided.  the ringing of my ears is so loud that i have to fall asleep to the tv loud to drown it out. i wake up often (every 2 hours and up for 30 mins-an hour at a time). the first time i wake up_ i feel like i've gotten a good nights sleep_ but have only slept 2 hours. it's then hard to fall back asleep because i'm not tired. this goes on until i finally give up at 5:30am. this happens every night. HOWEVER_ i otherwise feel wonderful!! i've been a half a pack a day smoker for 20 years. i'm now down to 3. no desire to smoke_ and when i do_ it's not fulfilling at all. i can only get through half a cigarette and realize that it was a stupid choice and it didn't do anything for me anyway...when i tried to quit smoking before_ caving in and having a cigarette felt wonderful! now_ it's not enjoyable. my mood has also improved. i've taken anti depressants before and know that sometimes my mood can get worse before it gets better when taking them. this did not happen with me on zyban. i'm quite content and optimistic. i think that there are far more good experiences with zyban than bad. it wouldn't be on the market if it the majority had the issues that i'm seeing on here. i have some side effects that i'm not fond of. but it's temporary_ and if the end result that i'm no longer smoking_ then i'll be happy to have ringing ears and sleepless nights for a few more weeks.,F,34,23  days150mg 2X D,10/19/2011Email,Zyban

I've slept 6 hrs in 3 days and when I try to sleep every little noise gets me really aggravated to a point where I feel like destroying everything around me and when I get up I'm angry and irritated all day. I think I might stop taking this drug as of today but I'm still willing to give it an other week in hopes that I'll stop smoking and that the aggression and sleeplessness will go away.,M,30,30  days150 2X D,10/14/2011Email,Zyban

53, 5, Quit Smoking,since the first day_ i have had a lot of energy. im not as impulsive and i notice myself paying attention more frequently. smoking isnt as pleasurable and im simply feeling as though im just going through the physiological routine of it now_ rather than getting any satisfaction from it. i had a few glasses of wine a few days ago and noticed my tolerance had decreased. i am at times feeling irritable but for the most part these brief phases throughout the day pass. also_ like clockwork_ in the evening i am getting headaches that end just as quick as they begin. im also feeling an increase in my libido. at first_ i was a little more spacy at times but this seems to be passing as well.,i dont know why other comments on this thread are so negative: so far_ and its only been a week_ i love this drug! i have so much energy and i dont sit around fretting about stuff throughout my day: i just get it done. i can focus without worrying about anything_ too. there really is so much satisfaction in being able to feel like my day was filled with a checklist of accomplishments. so far_ this is proving to be an absolutely great drug.,M,31,1  weeks150 MG 2X D,9/27/2011,Zyban
54, 3, Quitting smoking,Dry mouth_ anxiousness in the first few days. Light headedness starting on day 13_ complete panic attack and depression by day 14.,I started taking this pill 2 per day from the beginning. I felt a bit antsy the first few days_ but I am kind of antsy to begin with. Besides the dry mouth I felt pretty normal. My desire for cigarettes decreased and didnt really enjoy having them when I did. I quit smoking on day 11. Day 13 in the evening I felt light headed_ but nothing to strange. Day 14 I was extremely light headed in the morning_ and by after noon I was crying uncontrollabley and my blood pressure was through the roof. I could not understand why I couldnt stop crying and I was in a very happy mood earlier that day. My mood decreased and became very depressed and wanted to cry. I have not taken any since then_ that was 3 days ago and I still don't feel myself. I have not smoked since_ but I beleive my strong desire to not smoke is what has kept me from doing it. The zyban definitley helped in the beginning.. was it worth it.. I don't think so. I became a person I dont recognize and unfortunatley did and said things I cant take back now. Not worth it. My moods have  been up and down since then and contemplated if I even wanted to exist in this world for a few days. I would not touch this drug ever ever again.,F,28,14  days150 Mg 2X D,9/20/2011Email,Zyban

Gave me Z-pac-no help. It never dawned on me until 2 days ago that my sore throat coincided with starting this drug. My throat was constantly_ excruciatingly sore for 6 weeks!!

Severe anxiety_ internal tremors_ shaking_ depersonalization_ fear_ paranoia_ racing thoughts_ insomnia_ nausea_ loss of appetite_ feeling completely CRAZY and unstable _ crying outbursts_ anger and violent. Short term memory loss_ severe. Headache_ sore throat_ got a sinus infection_ chills.,"note:  took 1 x 150 mg for 3 days_ then upped to 2 x 150 mg per day (not at same time).   First day I felt a bit weird_ my body started twitching and I could feel my pulse all over my body.  I figured it was tolerable.  Same symptoms for 3 days while on one pill/day_ with added jitters_ and some feeling of anxiety but was tolerable.   After 3 days still not feeling any change in smoking desire.  On day 4 I upped to 2 pills/day (one early_ one later) and the anxiety became tenfold.  I slept 3 hours in two days.  The only way I can describe what came next was "" a whole lot of crazy"".  I felt like I've lost my mind_ unsure of everything.  Feeling completely like I can't get through the next minute_ exasperated.  On the last day I took this med (day 6) I took only 1 pill as I thought it might lessen the effects_ and it was not any less_ I was still crazy crazy crazy.  I was terrified like I was trapped in a bad place and could not get out.  My whole body was twitching_ shaking_ headache_ nausea.  The thoughts would not slow down_ just on overdrive for everything.    Today being day 7 I am not taking any more of this medication and I feel a little better today but still feel some of the effects.  I feel more rational of mind like my real true self.  Yesterday I felt like it was someone else in control and it was SOO bad_ oh so bad.  I had a lot of struggle just getting through every moment of the day yesterday. Still craved cigs whole time.

Hives on my neck and shoulders. De-personolised feeling....agitated_ very depressed. Aching feet. Insomnia_ nightmares...the list goes on!!,On the positive side I think that taking the Zyban suppresed my cravings for a ciggie_ and I felt ok for about the first 3 or 4 days_ then I stepped up the dose to 2 x 150mg per day after a week_ this is when the side effects really kicked in. I thought maybe it was just me reacting to this drug_ but obviously not!! I stopped taking the Zyban after 3 weeks_ as I felt so bad....this should be a happy time having kicked a 40 year habit_ but I felt worse than before I quit. The good news is I have been ciggie free for a month now_ and slowly feeling better in myself. I read on the net that it takes a week or more for the drug to clear itself from the body once stopped.

When I stepped up to two a day per instructions I immediately noticed that I wasn't particularly interested in smoking.  When I did_ it had no real effect and actually gave me a slight nausia.

I was going nuts and didn't think I could take this anymore. I realized sometimes they were really bad and sometimes not so bad and thought it was my morning coffee.  So one of the times it wasn't so bad_ I grabbed a caffeine soda_ and symptoms came back full blown in no time.  I choked down several glasses of water and was much better in a short while.  Your body is going through withdrawal because it THINKS it's not getting the nicotine even if you are still smoking.  Drinking water clears the nicotine out quicker.  Also_ zyban effects the fluids in your body somehow_ especially the sinuses_ so caffeine basically makes you dehydrate really bad.  That dehydration is probably causing the worse of the symptoms.,F,40,8  days150mg 1X D,1/3/2011,Zyban

90, 4, Stopping smoking,Ringing in the ears casusing partial deafness when there is background noise. Sleeping lighter than usual. Shaking hands. Unable to take deep breaths occasionally.,This is my second time on Zyban and the side effects are the same as the first time. This tablet really works but you need a really strong mind and will to quit to get passed the initial side  effects. I think you also need to realise that you are starving your body of nicotine which you are addicted to so not all sysptoms will be due to Zyban some will be withdrawals. If giving up smoking was easy people wouldn't need help to quit. I would recommend Zyban to anyone but warn them that they can make you feel ill but not for the whole course! Please don't let other peoples experiences put you off trying Zyban as everyone is different and lets face it stopping smoking is the best thing you can do for yourself.,F,32,12  days150 mg 2X D,9/2/2010,Zyban
91, 1, smoking cessation_ anti-depressant,dizziness/ feeling lightheaded_ paranoia_ trouble with my vision (sight was jumpy and blurry)_ also increased eye sensitivity_ paranoia_ irritability_ fatigue_ persistent headache (constant throbbing_ like my head was going to split open)_ complete inability to focus or become motivated_ increased depressive tendencies (not wanting to talk to friends_ not looking forward to the future),"in 5 short days i felt quite a whirlwind of side effects from this drug. by the third day i was completely off cigarettes_ and i didn't have a single craving...although that could have been because i was so distracted by how miserable i felt. also_ the second day i continued smoking cigarettes_ and it literally felt as if the nicotine receptors in my brain had been entirely cut off. therefore_ i no longer felt that ""pleasurable"" feeling from smoking_ so i stopped that night. The terrifying part was feeling as if my brain were lacking oxygen...i felt that this attributed to the dizziness and fatigue_ the pounding in my temples and occasionally in the back of my head_ and my inability to concentrate. to be honest_ i did come down with a minor sinus infection_ and i didn't want to blame my symptoms on the pill because i was so eager to use it to quit smoking. the joke was on me_ i was looking for a quick fix. there is no such thing when quitting_ you just have to remain in the present and take it one day at a time. and don't always trust everything your doctor tells you...the majority of them are pill-pushers and sometimes more harm comes from the remedy than the illness itself.",F,22,5  days150 2X D,8/25/2010Email,Zyban

104, 5, quit smoking,Dry mouth_ ants under my skin_ insomnia,I quit cold turkey back in 1998 for 2 years...and spent the next six months crying_ anxious_ paranoid and depressed. I would obsess over the simplest of matters and ended up getting so worked up a few times I ended up in hospital hooked up to an EKG. After 3 months I was suicidal_ and decided that if I was not better by Christmas  I would end it all...I had lost my mind but had no idea it was due to smoking cessation_ as my father had given up a 40 year habit the year before without any outward signs of what I was going through. These symptoms are very real and very dangerous. We have been smoking for so long and become so dependant on it that I think no matter how you quit_ some of us will experience such terrible withdrawals from the lack of whatever chemicals have been  entering our body for so long (not just the nicotine) that the experience is almost unimaginable. My reasons for starting smoking again were stupid_ and it was only when I tried stopping again with patches and the same withdrawals came back (albeit to a lesser degree) did I realise what I had suffered before was related to smoking withdrawal. With Zyban the psychological withdrawals were non existent and for this I am so grateful. This is my story and I just wanted to let everyone know some of us will suffer intensely when we first stop smoking no matter the method. Please listen to other advice posted here and ensure you tell your family and friends so they can keep an eye on you. Good luck to you all.,F,40,28  days150 1X D,6/18/2010,Zyban

It's Australia's only way of getting ""Wellbutrin"" which is commonly used as an AD in the USA.

I feel spaced out_ so bad that driving becomes scary. Then there's the paranoia. I can barely type_ and no_ it is not a symptom of nicotine withdrawel_ since I am actually smoking more now. Quitting with gum (as I have done in the past) is a walk in the park compared to this. Oh and forget about sleep_ it's almost impossible_ and when you do there's the most vivid dreams. Just pray they are good ones.,"All in all_ I am not dissing Zyban_ just for me it turned into a nightmare. It did_ however_ made cigarettes taste like crap and there was not that nicotine ""hit"" ie the first cigarette in the morning etc_ hence is why I smoked more I guess.

Zyban is worth it when desire to quit outweighs the side-effects_ I just hope these will become less harsh as weeks pass by.,Was fine during first week_ desire to smoke became less up to a point during second week that cigarettes made me feel sick and nauseous. now it is the 3rd week and i have become indifferent to smoking it doesn't even feel like one is missing something.

I've taken zyban to quit smoking twice; once several years ago and again just lately. The first time I took the drug_ it did work. I quit smoking.I also quit my job and left my wife-to-be to crash across the country.After coming back to and marrying this angry woman_ I was cigarette free for a good while. Until we divorced and I started smoking again.So I tried all kind of things to quit smoking again over the last few years_ and am finally resorting back to zyban. Again_ it works.But I'm getting the same side effects as the first time. I'm starting to suspect zyban works by removing you of all of your motivation; right up to the point where you're not motivated enough to reach for another cigarette_ let alone go to work or keep your fat second wife happy.

Nothing major_ which by the sound of this site_ is quite lucky.,I set my quit day at day 11_ and up to then didn't smoke any less. Thought this stuff wasn't working_ but was committed to the quit date... Quit day_ got up and thought_ Oh well_ I'm a non-smoker now.  So instead of having a coffee and a ciggie_ I had a coffee and breakfast_ not quite the same.  The urge to have a smoke was there_ but there was no craving for it. I found that reciting 101 reasons not to smoke in my head_ stained fingers_ heart disease_ lung cancer_ emphysema etc etc_ helped in times when I would usually go for a smoke_ like during commercial breaks at night. Anyway_ it's now been 4 whole days and I can't believe that I've actually given up_ no withdrawals... it was surprisingly easy!  Almost too easy! I don't have any cravings and even thou its only been 4 days_ I already know I won't go back to it_ will take zyban for another week until I get used to not smoking... it's been awhile.,F,30,14  days150mg 2X D,3/11/2010,Zyban

I have been smoke free for 18 days and hardly want a fag. Although this is great_ the side effects have been harsh. Ask my girlfriend_ i grabbed her by the face during an argument. Something that i have never ever done before to anyone never mind a woman. This has shocked me deeply. The doctor informed me that this was due to mixing the drug with alcohol. NEVER DRINK ON ZYBAN-even a few. I would recommend Zyban for giving up smoking- but i think the mental side effects should be spelled out more clearly.,M,31,25  days150mg 2X D,3/9/2010,Zyban

I have not looked back and have no desire to smoke at all. The first few days were the toughest - all I thought about were cigarettes due to the habit I'd formed for 19 years.

After I upped the dose to 2 pills started feeling really depressed_ had days where I was crying uncontrollably_ felt useless.  Suicidal thoughts etc.  Cried for days on end_ which is something I never did before taking Zyban.  My partner is taking it as well and she has some of the same symptoms_ e.g. dry mouth_ loss of sleep and appetite etc_ but none of the physchological effects.  I was about to make an appointment with my doctor regarding the depression when I found this site and realise now it is a common side effect.,Have not smoked for 7 weeks so feel good about that_ but this drug needs to be taken very seriously and I will be letting my doctor know the potential side effects.  Have not felt this bad physchologically in my life.  Would not recommend it to people unless they have tried everything else and they know the risks.  Thought I was going mad.

124, 4, Quit smoking,Dry mouth_ wierd dreams/sleep patterns,Apart from the dry mouth and few odd dreams_ i found Zyban very successful. I suppose it affects different people in different ways. It was about 11 or 12ys before i actually stopped. The taste of cigs became foul and the thought of smoking one made me feel sick. 12 weeks now and though the thought of smoking doesn't make me feel sick. I just don't fancy one anymore.,M,49,1  months,1/25/2010,Zyban

I am starting to feel the benefits with my breathing. My swimming has moved to 2kms per day from 1km 3 x a week. I feel fantastic. I still get the odd desire to have a puff_ but remind myself that i don't actually want ""one puff"" as that one will lead to another and another. Then i'll be a smoker again. The cravings only last a few seconds if and  when they appear. The withdrawals were well worth it!  Thank you.",M,36,30  days,1/22/2010,Zyban
127, 1, Quit Smoking,I noticed I started to have thoughts that triggered panic and anxiety. There are time I am sitting and have a thought of a situation that would normally cause me to be a little anxious. However_ when I was on Zyban it seems as though the anxiety was magnified. Did not really get depressed. Was actually in a good mood when starting off on Zyban_ but on the 3rd week I started to notice these side effects. Heart palpitations_ nausea_ waking up after ~ 4hrs of sleep_ vivid dreams/nightmares_ anxiety attacks_ slight paranoia_ avoidance of situations with people I don't know. It definately magnifies certain anxious situations. I am going to get off of this medication ASAP.,I can't say if this happens to everyone. I know a couple of people that have taken it and they seem fine. Any drug that causes changes in endorphines and any signs of the side effects on the box should be taken with extra caution. I was not aware of it myself but after reading the side effects people have experienced and reflected back on the time I was taking Zyban_ it seems pretty accurate. I'm going cold turkey.

129, 4, To quit smoking,Weird_ vivid dreams. Other side effects are not necessarily connected with Zyban.,I am on day 7 of taking Zyban. Started with the 1st three days at one pill a day_ and then started two pills a day. I have noticed I do have more energy and am upbeat. I am usually a very positive person so I don't know if Zyban has affected that. I have been having weird_ vivid dreams and sometimes have to get out of bed to see if it was real or not. Trouble sleeping only started last night_ woke up a few times and trouble falling back asleep. That also has happened to me prior to taking Zyban. The few things that seem out-of-sorts for me are not drastic_ and they are managable. So far so good_ cigarettes don't taste the same but I still crave them at times. Tomorrow is the first day without them_ so we will see how I do. I do not understand how others can be depressed_ but everyone reacts differently to things I guess.,F,27,7  days,1/12/2010,Zyban
130, 5, quit smoking,Depression.,I've been takin Zyban for 7 days.  The 5th day into taking the medication_ I felt depressed and didn't want to do anything.  I went to a party over the weekend_ and didn't even feel like I wanted to be there.  My 7th day_ my depression was worse.  I felt really down_ and wanted to leave work and go home.  However_ I don't have to desire to smoke as much.  Which is a positive.  I think I will only need one more week at the most on this medication_ so the depression side effects are well worth it to be smoke free.,M,28,7  days,1/11/2010,Zyban
131, 4, to give up smoking,Day2 i made the mistake of drinking on my work xmas do. i got drunk so quickly and cannot remember 3hrs of the night. i keep losing my memory without drinking. like i'll be holding something and will start looking for it. throughout taking zyban i have been an emotional wreck_ i cry all the time_ the slightest thing sets me off_ i get the shakes alot_ the worse time is in the evening_ i feel twitchy and unnerved_ i feel like i may aswell be taking extasy twice a day_ as im feeling high and spaced most of the time_ i cant focas properly. im also soooo moody.  it takes ages to get to sleep and i seem to wake every 30mins to an hr.. the nights seem so long i hate it_ i also have nightmares when i do sleep_ but i got these with patches too.,I expected side effects. i had hoped it wouldnt effect me as much as it has most people. but.. i havent smoked. so thats what it is all for.  These side effects arent a patch on what it would be like having cancer.so for the sake of a few months i'll put up with them. i would recommend zyban_ because if you really want to give up.. it does work. obviously you need to be strong minded_ as feeling depressed is one of the main side effects. good luck everyone.,F,27,12  days,12/21/2009Email,Zyban

133, 5, Smoking Cessation,"A slight ""disconnected"" feeling-comparable to some cold medications. Nothing major and you get used to that in a few weeks",Fantastic medication. I'm sure some people will experience something negative but I wish more people would familiarize themselves with the normal effects of not smoking so they wouldn't get nicotine withdrawal confused with the medication.  My experience? As a result of the medication I didn't get ill tempered or hateful.  I felt like my whole body woke up though. I understand the disturbed sleep_ huge increase in libdo_ elated moods and overall sense of well being can be attributed to my body coming off of nicotine. Wonderful experience and I'm sorry everyone can't experience what I'm going thru!,F,48,2  years,12/7/2009Email,Zyban

135, 1, smoking cessation,mood swings_ worth less_ crying A LOT_ depressed_ dry mouth & throat_ tightness of chest_ shaking_ MORE CRYING,I have been taking ZYBAN for 8 days. For the first 2-3 days I was ok_ had a few cravings here and there but was able to tolerate the craving. After the first three  1xday pills_ I started on my 2xdays per day. WORST MISTAKE.. I suddenly notice I was sad. When I was registering for classes_ I started to feel hopeless and unworthy. That I was dumb & stupid. Upon registering_ I started to cry REALLY BAD to my husband. Afterwards_ after taking the stupid 2nd pill_ things did not feel right. FINALLY_ on my 8th day. Took the usual 1st pill.. I started to feel a bit shaky but did not think much of it. When I took the 2nd pill_ after an hour_ I started to shake a little harder_ I couldn't breathe_ I was slurring in my speech. I cried so much that I kept telling my husband things like I am stupid_ I am a bad mother_ bad wife_ bad daughter_ etc... but after talking to my parents_ they found that people who discontinued this medication was the same systoms I was feeling. It's really not worth it. My life is worth it. I know smoking decreases your life span_ but I see both worlds now. It's either I die from smoking or die from something else. SO MY SOLUTION IS: JUST ELIMINATE EVERYTHING.,F,25,8  days,11/25/2009Email,Zyban

Was on about 20 a day and reckon i could go down to 2 if it wasn't for tis damn depression!! Got it into my head i'm madly in love with my ex (which i know i'm not and its the tablets) and have been crying like a baby! So not like me as i'm normally not the crying type and very strong and cheerful!! Obviously tired too cos of the lack of sleep but only took 2 tablets in one day and as soon as i realised it stopped me sleeping went down to one so hopefully will be able to sleep again soon!,F,41,11  days,11/18/2009,Zyban
137, 4, To quit smoking,Slight dizziness_ dry mouth (only during the first week of taking zyban)_ fast speech_ moody_ feel very tired at night and fall asleep immediately when I lie down.,I have been smoking 20 cigarettes a day for the last 10 years. I was contemplating to quit smoking when my GP sort of talked me into trying Zyban. I took Zyban for a week before quitting. Already after 4 days_ cigarettes somehow lost their appeal. Finally quitting on day 7 was a breeze. I am now smoke-free for 17 days. Also read Allen Carrs book on my last day before throwing away my ciggies. I will stop Zyban in a week_ because I think I have the right state of mind to keep my fingers from those little poison sticks (which I attribute to Allen Carrs book).All in all I must say that Zyban was helpful.,M,37,23  days,11/17/2009Email,Zyban

Felt very strange on the pills but had no cravings or very mild to say the least. Went back to 1 pill a day after 7 days as the side affects were not too nice.

I have since stopped feeling moody and aggitated_ and that is after upping to twice a day.

My prostate is acting up a little more than usual and I have to get up in the night to pass water 5 or 6 times instead of 1 or 2.,"When I smoke a cigarette now it's like drinking de-alcoholized beer. The smell_ taste and other physical sensations are there but it's like something should be happening in my mind_ but isn't. It appears that whatever mental effect I get from nicotene isn't happening. Very much like the first few months of total abstinence when I detoxed from over thirty years of alcohol and drug addiction. I mean after the physical part was over and the suppressed emotions started coming out. Trying to quit nicotene cold turkey brought horrible and chaotic blasts of suppressed emotions which caused depression and other negative ""in the now"" emotional reactions. Zyban is like that but much more gradual and more bearable. I've been through this kind of mental confusion 6 years ago and I know from experience that the emotions sort themselves out.",M,56,7  days,7/31/2009,Zyban

Whilst i was on the drug i was ok for the first couple of days_ then the insomnia started. This i could deal with. I started to feel a little depressed after about 5 days_ and things didnt feel all that real. By the seventh day (when i upped my dosage to 300mg)_ the insomnia was getting ridiculous_ i had mood swings_ and previous depression problems had fully reocurred. On the tenth night of taking this drug_ i was laying in bed_ unable to think about anything other than suicide. I had already self harmed during this week_ this is something i had not done for a long time.After this i ceased taking the drug.

All the side affects that people wrote were not so for me.I just re-read what I wrote Nov 6/07 & still stand by it. As for not drinking alcohol...the ONLY problem is that beer tastes bad as well. But tough it out & you'll feel great!! Thanks ZYBAN!!!!,Zyban's great..,F,37,12  months,10/21/2008,Zyban
172, 5, Quit smoking,Vivid dreams that were not at all unpleasant. A bit of dry month.,I wish I had taken this before I stopped smoking. I quit cold turkey for two months after 40 years of smoking. I soon had a serious case of insomnia that led to major depression. After 10 days on this drug_ I started sleeping OK_ and was more or less functional. That's on 150 mg. That was enough to do the trick_ so I didn't up it to 300.,M,65,2  months,10/17/2008Email,Zyban
173, 5, To quit 20 year smoking habit,I am on day 16 of the Zyban program. I had no side effects the first week but I am at home from work now with bouts of nausia and cold and clamy sweats and constipation with large amounts of gas cramps. I have felt dizzy and had very dry eyes. I have had mild cravings that only last a few moments. Have been smoke free for 5 day's.,I am amazed at how well this medication works_ I just wish the side effects weren't so bothersome. I was sitting beside my co-workers while they were smoking and had no urges to smoke. This is my third day of missed work. The cramping is so painful and the cold sweats are imbarasing. I have noticed that my urine has a medicinal odor to it. Yuck. I wish this medication was covered because @ 80.00 a month it's expensive.,F,31,19  days,10/8/2008Email,Zyban
174, 4, Stop Smoking,"I had insomnia (took over the counter sleep aids_ worked like a charm)_ crazy dreams_ dry mouth_ a bit of anxiety_ increased urination (probably due to all the water I was drinking)_ a drab sort of ""whatever"" feeling.",I'm 7 days into Zyban.  I started feeling the side effects when I upped the dosage to 300mg.  I quit smoking 5 days into the treatment.  So far it has worked.  My head sometimes hurts but I haven't had any side effects I can't handle.  From  most of the (positive) posts_ side effects subside in the first 2 - 2.5 weeks.  I do have a weird sort of 'whatever' feeling.  Kind of a lack of caring about stuff yet I still manage to put 110% into it.  I've had some weird thoughts but nothing totally out there.  Me and the girlfriend split a few days ago and I never really took it too hard.  I usually do.   Maybe that's the antidepressant characteristics of this drug kicking in (we never ended things because of the Zyban).  I think I'll avoid alcohol for a while just in case.  I took sleep aids after I upped the dosage to 300mg as I couldn't sleep a few nights.  Since then I've switched to taking herbal Valerian Root to get to sleep.

On day 11 I had smoked a pack and a half plus drunk many beers so I thought itd be impossible to quit. On day 12_ miraculously_ I experienced the total absence of craving for a ciggy (and no hangover at all to boot). The worst came on day 13 and day 14: the side effects accelerated. I had insomnia_ palpitations (cold turkey?)_ an almost permanent state of anxiety and dizziness_ and my nerves were at the end of their tether. I decided then to cut to 1 pill a day but eventually I didnt_ and on day 15 things came suddenly back to normal and gradually getting better until the last 4 days that I've been feeling perfectly normal. I'm on day 10 after quitting and frankly I have no cravings at all. If the side effects don't come back this is going to be easier than expected and I'd accept the side effects for a good cause.

I decided to keep trying for 2 weeks and if I didn't get used to it I would stop. Well I am now on day 16_ not smoking_ sleeping perfectly and feel absolutly normal. I'm not saying it will work for all but if you can just get through the beginning side effects_ I think it will also work for you. Just remember your body will always have an adjusting time to each different drug. It took about 10 days for my body to adjust_ and like I said_ I feel totally normal and fine. Good Luck_ if you have any questions you can email me.,F,25,16  days,6/6/2008Email,Zyban

Overall side effects include mproved sleep_ constipation_ feeling a bit jittery_ stressed_ slight weight gain (few lbs).,Since starting this drug I've also been experiencing a lot of yeast infections_ which is NOT normal for me (approx. in 5 months).  I tried several OTC treatments_ pill from my physician but they keep coming back.  I am wondering if it is related to the drug...but I haven't seen anything in the literature.

183, 4, As an aid to stop smoking.,PLEASE READ. Zyban certainly did what my doctor said it would do_ that is_ take away the extreme withdrawal symptoms of quitting.Before anybody commences a Zyban program_ I would recommend that all support programs are put into place and that loved ones are warned about possible outcomes. I have read most_ if not all responses and would suggest that there is a large amount of truth in ALL. Be aware that Alan Carr's book along with Zyban and sheer willpower should achieve the results you want_ however the side effects of Zyban really do need to be considered.

184, 5, To quit smoking,Difficulty falling asleep_ a little spaced out and anxious at first,"The day I started I went from a full 21mg patch to a half of one.  I believe any nicotine in your system on this drug will cause anxiety_ so expect a few days of it since you won't want to quit the day you start taking it. I also think that the depression and other mental sides people experience are strongly exacerbated or caused by a lack of sleep_ which is easily remedied by a prescription sleep aid. I took Seroquel at night and slept like a baby. IMO Seroquel is the best sleep aid with this drug but a doctor may not prescribe it as they are technically contraindicated because of ""possible"" seizure issues - YMMV_ without it I wouldn't have slept the first few days. I'm now on day 7_ 2 days into nicotine withdrawal as a pack a day smoker and I feel great_ it doesn't get any easier.",M,20,1  weeks,5/27/2008,Zyban

I also have a weird Lassie Faire  attitude about things that is mildly disturbing. However_  knowing that I have a Lassie Faire  attitude is helping to combat it. I have been taking Zyban for over five months and STILL  use nicotine gum. However_ the last 3 weeks or so I have cut down con the gum considerably and actually feel like I have quite smiling. I smoked for so many years that it has been a real struggle for me. This is the only method to work for me. Smoking has been such a part of my life that it ha taken this long for SOMETHING to work.

Constipation and then chronic diarrhoea with unbearable stomach cramps.  I can't sleep if I do it's for a maximum of 2 hours I clock watch all night_ understandably I am exhausted.  I cannot concentrate on anything_ even driving which is a bad thing.  That prompted me to look for this site as I mounted a kerb a couple of times and found myself weaving all over the road.  I will either kill myself or someone else so no more.  This is my elevnth day and yes I stopped smoking on day 2 but am definately not myself.

202, 4, Cessation of Smoking,First 3 days_ severe headache.  Felt a bit disconnected from my body_ if that makes sense .. just not quite with it.  I nearly quit taking the medication due to the headaches.  On day four_ that went away.  I felt a bit more anxious than usual_ but I'm prone to that and as I'm no longer on medication for anxiety_ it seems normal that this would bring it to the forefront. The only other notable side effect (and honestly_ I'm not really sure this was caused by the Zyban but I also can't think of another reason for it to have started) is excessive perspiration.  Upon cessation of Zyban_ I started having headaches again.  This lasted for about four days and was not as bad as the ones at the beginning.,I took this medication as prescribed - 150mg twice/day.  One week and two days into the prescription_ I put down my cigarettes.  I haven't picked up one since.

I horseback ride and had the worst ride of my life yesterday. Couldn't concentrate at all_ it was like i had forgotten anything my coach had taught me in the past year. The second day of taking the drug I cried uncontrolably for an hour_ still not sure what that was about???

Sex drive up at least,This is the second time I have had Zyban_ the first time I purchased on the Internet and YES it works! It stops you smoking. No Nicotine patch or Gum or Lozenge can touch Zyban.

211, 1, To stop smoking,Sleeplessness and paralysing depression. Anxiety increased a thousandfold. The listlessness of the zombie_ the despair of the damned. Oh_ and it diminished my craving for nicotine. Big deal.,This vile stuff makes self-medication seem intelligent. I am an alcoholic and had been sober for four years after rehab when my doctor_ on a whim_ suggested that Zyban might enable me to give up smoking. He gave me no warning of side-effects save_ when asked_ to mention rare convulsions. I mentioned my depression_ which had sporadically returned after twenty-five years on attaining sobriety. He declared that Zyban was an anti-depressant_ so might actually do some good. Ten days into the treatment_ I was totally without hope and incapable of work or social activity. I lost thousands of pounds in staring at the ceiling_ contemplating drink or suicide which were_ in my case_ synonymous.

Week 3 onwards I haven't really noticed any side effects apart from if I take the second dose late in the evening (after 8pm) I have trouble sleeping.,This medicine has worked well for me.

I can't say I lost the urge to smoke at all during the first week_ but I didn't find it that difficult to stop on my quit day and I'm sure it was due to the zyban.  Although I did suffer a few side effects during the second week I beleive it was worth it as it's really helped me giving up smoking.  I read Allen Carr's easyway book too.  I don't believe it's a miracle drug_ there are still difficult times and willpower is required but it can certainly help some people.

Suddenly in week 6 started to feel giddy and nausea a feeling that climaxed together with acute anxiety_ fear_ crying etc. It was really scary and I had to be taken to hospital. Stopped taking drug immediately and am fine now.,Zyban really did work for me as I had almost no cravings at all after more than 30 years of smoking. Never felt it so easy to stop. However_ it is not known how this drug works and what it does to you. I would say try other non-drug methods first (such as the Allen Carr book recommended by other contributors)and only take Zyban if absolutely nothing else works. Watch out for delayed side effects such as I experienced after 5 weeks. Make sure that you have someone nearby to help you at all times should you have problems.,F,49,6  weeks,6/6/2007,Zyban
264, 5, To stop smoking,In the first week_ ever so slightly giddy_ like when you have just got off a treadmill after a run_ except it lasted ALL day .  By day 3_ fags tasted like an ash tray smells thus I was smoking only a few puffs a few times a day. After increased dose to 2 a day the giddiness escalated between 4pm and 6pm (taking them 7am and 3pm) to the point where I felt like I shouldnt be driving my car.  The rest of the time no giddiness at all anymore.  Slightly dry mouth_ but only afternoons and evening.  Vivid dreams_ feel like I'm sleeping light_ and when waking up feel wide awake instead of taking ages to wake up properly.  Still sleep light after a month_ but all the other side effects stopped at about day 15.,Have been taking Zyban whilst reading Allen Carr's book_ the Easyway to Stop Smoking after someone else told me it was a really good combination.  I havent experienced half of what other people have_ and those side effects I have had are not worth complaining about when I consider the benefits that will be gained long term. I was told by my Dr to set a stop date at day eleven_ and stick to it.  From day 4 it took me 8 days to get through 20 cigs because I just didnt want to smoke.  It DOES take personal effort_ but the book has helped SO much. The book and the meds are definitley a great combination_ and I would recommend them to anyone.  It definitely works_ I'd say more so if you're in a positive frame of mind.  It has exceeded my expectations and I am absolutely chuffed to bits,F,28,3  weeks,5/22/2007Email,Zyban
265, 5, Stop Smoking,Slowed my thinking considerably. Can be difficult to talk as I feel slower than usual. Some feeling of detachment and spaced out. Can function as normal (eg work_ gym_ etc) but can't wait to stop taking the tablets and return to the real world!,However_ from the 1st tablet_ smoking became undesirable. I continued to smoke 10-15 day until the 8th day when I couldn't feel anything from smoking and it tasted disgusting. Haven't smoked since and the cravings are hardly there. This really does work if you follow the instructions. Will power is still needed but the physical craving is gone.,M,31,12  days,5/16/2007,Zyban
266, 5, Quitting the Smokes.....,"I have had success with Zyban 5 years ago but went back to smoking after 6 months due to my new partner being a smoker and family problems.I smoke about 15-20 smokes a day.I am now giving up again using Zyban_ I am on my 2nd day so far_ Feeling a little bit ""funny"" but not too bad_ I'm waking up heaps earlier in the morning and i'm full of energy too which is weird_ but not a bad side effect! Ciggies are already not giving me the hit i usually get but i'm still smoking em so far. Last time took about a Week untill ciggies tasted like crap and i wondered what the hell i was smoking em for and threw em out. I'll post again once i have stopped smoking completely!",Best way to give up EVER! This site has too many bad reviews_ obviously ppl only post to complain and not congratulate. I'm bucking the trend here.....,M,30,2  days,5/8/2007Email,Zyban
267, 5, quit smoking,Some insomnia the first week but nothing once my body adjusted to the medication.,Having read a lot of the comments_ I wonder how many people were using nicotine replacement therapy as well?  Some of the symptoms that people are attributing to Zyban are actually symptoms of nicotine withdrawal (tiredness_ lightheadedness_ etc).  You also have to remember that your body is cleansing itself.  Skin problems are common to quitting smoking (e.g._ oily skin_acne_ etc.) These symptoms will disappear in time.,M,38,14  days,5/3/2007,Zyban
268, 4, Stop smoking,Light headedness_ tightening of the chest_ heart palpitations_ the fear of having a stroke or heart attack. Also anxiety_ sadness and fear. This all happened in the short span of 5 days. Now I have to be perfectly clear I did not follow the prescribed method of the recomended dose. Since I had been on this drug before_ I thought it was pretty safe and tame and without any real side effects. So I immediately started taking 2 pills / day. It was extremely stupid and reckless and I strongly believe that the symptoms I experienced this time was a direct result of that.   ,I have been taking Zyban off and on for the last year. I quit smoking 1 year ago with the aid of Zyban. It worked as promised. I would discontinue the use of the drug but if at anytime I felt an overwhelming urge to smoke_ I would get right back on it but always under the supervision of my doctor. I began smoking about 3 weeks ago. I began taking Zyban again but immediately started with 2 pills per day. My experiences of the drug in the past were mild. This time is was very awful and I now see how powerful this drug is. I think this drug can help some quit smoking as it did help me but if abused or if you are not the right fit for the drug_ it can be very dangerous. ,M,42,5  days,4/30/2007,Zyban
269, 5, smoking cessation,Wired & nervy_ insomnia_ sharpness/honesty_ loss of appetite & weight...  BUT this stuff works and I think side effects are worth it.  Coming off the stuff you appreciate being calm again and so don't feel the need to smoke (2 days so far anyway),Only worried about getting together with friends who smoke (rare these days) will I be tempted to have a puff in the moment?  Any stories on casual Zyban use prior to these occasions?,F,34,4  weeks,4/25/2007,Zyban
270, 4, Stop smoking,Initially anxiety and slowed down my analytical thinking. Thereafter pretty much ok_ some feeling of detachment and warped sense of time.,Initially used for 5 days.

Now that I'm quit a month I'm thinking about cutting my dose to 150mg for a while_ and see what happens. If I start getting urges to smoke I'll go back to 300mg.  I'm getting to angry with people at work.  Its really nice to quit and not have urges to smoke.. this stuff really does work!  I do wish I had tryed the new champix drug 1st... I hear it has a better sucess rate.(mytimetoquit.com).   I think I'll be able stay quit this time for ever!!,M,35,5  weeks,4/17/2007,Zyban
273, 3, smoking,First few days it felt really relaxing like a big massage!  On increasing dose to 2 pills: dry mouth_ loss of appetite_ nervy_ insomnia_ night sweats.  The urge to quit work_ do something radical and tell people where to go (maybe it's a truth drug),Works for smoking cause it seems to relax/numb that scratchy craving in your lungs as well as doing stuff to your head.,F,34,3  weeks,4/17/2007Email,Zyban

277, 1, Stop Smoking,After reading the comments I just wanted to say that I experienced the same horrible side effects within the first week of taking Zyban and I was STILL smoking. So_ for all of you who have commented that it's the nicotine withdrawal that are causing the side effects_ that's not true.,Be very careful if you take this drug and make sure you have someone to supervise you if thing's get nasty...and they probably will. Horrible stuff.,F,30,14  days,4/15/2007,Zyban
278, 1, Smoking Cessation,DON'T DO IT! After only 3 pills I experienced incredible dizziness_ loss of concentration_ inability to socialize and look people in the eye_ suicidal thoughts. I live in a high-rise building and had to close all the windows because I didn't trust myself not to fling myself over the ledge. Husband out of town_ and didn't trust myself to be alone and had girlfriends come stay with me. Uncontrollable panic attacks and anxiety and feelings of hopelessness_ fear and sadness. Thought I was going MAD!!! All very unlike me.,Yes_ you don't want to smoke but you don't want to die either.,F,37,3  days,4/14/2007,Zyban

Tried stopping before a few times but unsuccessful. This stuff is a miracle! Stopped smoking on day 9 and haven't felt the urge for one since.

So this time around I thought I would try this. THANK Goodness I found this rating page. Everyone's experience sounds just terrible. Thank you all for being so honest. I will find another way to quit. I don't think I could handle the dreams_ depression and the thought of hurting someone or myself! Going through smoking withdrawl_ Zyban effects_ and PMS would send me to the Loonie Bin!!..LOL...Think I will stay away from Zyban!,,F,32,0  days,4/4/2007,Zyban

I am not entirely sure the zyban helped me quit as I still found the cigs tasted good on my stop date.  I still have urges to smoke_ but I distract myself.

299, 1, Smoking Cessation,I experienced massive_ soul-destroying depression while taking Zyban. Within one day of taking the first pill_ I started having nightmares and waking up with a sense of dread. By the second day_ I was starting to have feelings of anxiety and depression. The depression got worse every day. Eventually I was so depressed and irritated that I was unable to perform at work and lost my job. I got a new job_ but only lasted there for one day. The depression was so powerful that I was unable to do anything at all. I was suicidal. I still am. I actually started looking around for ways to kill myself. I wrote a will and started throwing personal items away. Because I don't really want to die_ or at least I didn't before I started taking Zyban_ I had to leave the city where I was living and return home_ because I couldn't cope at all. I lost a lot of money moving back and cancelling my lease. After over two months_ I am still recovering from the depression. I am hoping that I will get in to see a,Zyban works. I did not feel like smoking within around 10 days of starting to take it. Unfortunately_ the feelings of depression which I experienced were so overwhelming that I had to stop taking the medication and start smoking again. When I started smoking again_ every puff elevated my mood slightly. I was impressed with Zyban's ability to make me not want to smoke_ but the depression and anxiety this drug has caused me wasn't worth it. I would not recommend taking it for anyone who has ever had a problem with depression.,M,36,3  days,3/6/2007Email,Zyban

316, 1, quit smoking,I cannot begin to give you a brief description of my side effects! They started as drymouth and headaches but that was not the end of it. I progress to muscular and aches and weakness to the point i couldn't walk and would fall and the crazy sensation of a fuzzy feeling that I know term as flushing. I have gained weight and can't get it off which fortunately has never been a problem for me until now and part of the reason for this is because i am nauseas alot and feel like i need to eat carbs all the time again never an issue with me before. for the last six months my left ear feels like its filled with cotton balls.,Has anyone had similiar side effects? If so_ have you had any success getting help from the medical field in acknowledging that your symptoms might be drug induced? Its been three years and I can't seem to shake these symptoms. Please email me.I know these symptoms sound extreme and i have not taken the drug since 2004 and i am still experiencing the Fuzzy feeling_ occasional muscle weakness_ muscle tremors are worse now_ joint pain and nausea and lets not forget the ear problem. I have never had a medical problem in my life other than a headache until i tried this satan drug zyban! I just want answers and help. Doctors want to throw me on more drugs to mess with my head and i have refused so far but i am beginning to believe that i am crazy! I am happy for those that it worked for and I did quit for several months but i could not stand to feel as bad as i did so i went back to smoking in hopes i would feel better.

Was on Celexa for 4 yrs_ helped for 2 then stopped being effective. Didn't know that was possible so stayed on it for another 2 yrs and then ended up in the emergency. Zyban worked well for a friend which is why I wanted to give it a chance. I deeply regret that and I hope I won't continue suffering from side effects now that I've quit this EVIL drug.

Insomnia_ jitters_ decreased appetite_ slight joint pain and minor headaches but I have heard most side effects decrease with time. Incredible dreams.,Smoked for 20 years and thought I would die a smoker. I have had 4 cigs in 5 days_ last one was 48 hours ago. The longest I had gone before was 3 hours. Zyban has saved my life.

It was only when I felt like a coffee that I realised I hadn't had a cigarette for hours_ or even thought about smoking.

EXTREMELY VIVID dreams.    Dreamnt all night long_ felt like I dreamed for days and days_ woke up remembering 30 diff adventures I went on while sleeping.   (TO ME THAT IS AN AMAZING_ AND GREAT side effect_ I love dreaming)   Dreams were not bad... were either good_ or neutral.   Having certain moments of doubt_ paranoia and sadness... thought for a split second (after reading this site and reading how it causes extreme rage) that my bf might kill me in my sleep.  (he's on it too).   I wouldn't advise to get drunk... I had 3 drinks and threw up_ whereas in normal cercumstances_ 3 drinks is nothing.,7th day_ no desire to smoke.

Paxil worked great for me for depression.   Zyban has greatly reduced urge to smoke_ but has had no anti-depressant effects.  If anything_ Zyban has made me feel more depressed and anxious.

Zyban was prescribed to me for smoking cessation_ along with nicotine patches.  I took one a day for 3 days_ then 2 a day.

Never had an overly dry mouth (try a glass of water if you do )_ no rashes or hives. I didn't have one dark or paranoid thought - I must be a stable kind of bloke. And keep in mind SMOKING DESTROYS YOUR LUNGS!! I would recommend these to ANYONE. Nearly a year now without a ciggy I can breath easily_ take part in sports 2-3 times a week_ and don't cough up my lungs every morning.

I even waited 2 days and smoked one_ but still nothing.  So now it's like why bother smoking?  I've only taken Zyban less than a week_ but it's working like a charm despite the mild side effects.

341, 1, depression,severe rash over much of my body after 6 weeks of no problems,I started taking it for depression which I know think was more anxiety than depression.  I start at 150mg/day and went to 150 twice a day after a week.  It did make my desire to smoke go away so I was loving that and decided to quit.  I've been on it for about 6 weeks now and I developed a severe rash starting in my armpits.  I woke up the next day and most of my chest and part of my arms had the rash.  I didn't take my morning dose and I think the rash started to go away.  I was hoping it was not the welbutrin since I really want to quit smoking.  I thought maybe it was a new shirt that I wore before I washed it.  So_ I took my second dose a few hours ago and the rash is coming back worse.  I'm not taking any more.  I have been searching for info on whether stopping at 300mg/day cold turkey was OK.  I haven't found anything so I'm going to stop.  My doc (LPN) said it shouldn't be the cause of the rash.  I'm going to call again and tell them I'm stopping and see what they say.,M,41,6  weeks,11/1/2006,Zyban

I've been kind of paranoid the last few days but I've just realized that it was paranoia and not reality.  This morning I woke up high as a kite.  I had a ton of energy and cleaned the house_ dressed like a silly little kid_ and just had a great time.  But a few hours later my husband gave me a look that I took as completely evil and totally changed my day.  I've been nauseous for several hours.  I vomited up a sweet taste even though I haven't been able to eat in over 18 hours.  Now my mouth tastes sweet but cigarettes dont really taste bad.  I'm going to give it a few more days because I REALLY want to quit smoking.  But if the mental affects of Zyban continue_ I'll have to quit.  My marriage and job position will be ruined if I keep on.  I think I've lost my mind.,F,22,6  days,10/29/2006Email,Zyban
343, 3, to quit smoking,Spaced out_ Hot sweat_ disturbed sleep_ odd dreams_ teeth grinding_ still smoking.,CAN ANYONE HELP?    I am on my 5th day of taking this drug.  I have just experienced feeling very spaced out and 'away with the fairies'... i was talking_ and then suddenly realised that i was unaware that i had been talking for a while.  My daughter also noticed that i was grinding my teeth earlier in the day.  Last night i had very odd dreams and disturbed sleep. I have also experience a hot flush_ although i do feel like i might be coming down with a cold so the hot sweat could be atributed to a cold.  My GP has recommended that I take Zyban for 7 days one pill a day_ and then 2 pills a day for the rest of the course.   I am worried about the side affects_ but i am trying to be positive about it. I am still smoking my normal amount_ and was told to stop smoking after 7 days.   If any one can offer me any feed back or advice i'd really appreciate it. my e-mail address is attached.,F,,5  days,10/22/2006Email,Zyban
344, 1, Smoking Cessation,"Took as prescribed by doctor_ for smoking cessation.  On it for 3 weeks then began to experience very strong_ bizarre impulsive thoughts of self-harm which were very scary.  Am an RN and was very familiar with this med_ this side effect scared the crap out of me.  Also_ the entire 3 weeks I was on it_ no other side effects - slept well_ no dry mouth - but absolutely no desire to quit smoking_ still craved cigs like always.  WARNING: I personally wouldn't recommend it - the impulsive thoughts and strong anxious feelings that accompanied them were so ""not me"" - not what I would have expected at all - thank God I discontinued it!",,F,39,3  days,10/18/2006Email,Zyban
345, 1, to quit smoking,About 2 days into the treatment I had an extremely bizarre nightmare (more of a night terror I guess). Didn't think much of it. 3rd_ 4th night the same thing - I'm talking big-time nightmares waking to my heart pounding like a freight train. Day 5 I experienced the first anxiety-attack of my life. Sat in my office afraid to leave for no particular reason. Called the doctor who told me to return home right away and not to continue with Zyban. On the ride home I saw a polar bear in a ditch by the side of the road - of course I knew that was not the case but I could not get my mind's eye to correct the vision(turned out to be a big guy in a white t-shirt and white hat collecting cans). Later found out that such nightmares and anxiety are known (but supposedly rare) side-effects.,My guess is wellbutrin (sp?) (which has been used for years for treatment of depression and *is* Zyban) is probably not for everyone - particularly those who do not smoke due to depression but simply addiction.... just a guess though. In summary_ be careful with this drug.,M,35,5  days,10/9/2006,Zyban
346, 1, DONT TAKE ZYBAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I didnt experience the side effects but I witnessed the over-powering drug first hand. My sister was on it. She never had too much troubles sleeping until she started taking Zyban. She wasnt a suicidal person but Zyban made her feel crazy_ with extremely low lows and rarely even an inbetween or high. She was irritable_ grumpy_ mopey_ became drug induced bi-polar. I wanted to write this on her behalf as the effects of Zyban and NOT niccotine withdrawl made her take her own life. She said everyday that she wasnt able to function like she used to since having taken Zyban. She went from super happy and positive to deep_ dark and so depressed she couldnt cope anymore. THe doctor that prescribed this HORRIBLE HORRIBLE drug said that there were little to no side effects. After she started taking Zyban she looked up side effects online as she was starting to feel different. Almost all the posts we saw online were negative towards this drug. DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE were amongst the list of side,PLEASE DO NOT take this drug. It may seem too good to be true and that is the correct assumption. I am not going to stop until this drug is REMOVED FROM THE MARKET in all countries. I dont wanna see anyone else go through what me and my family are going through. My sister was an incredible person. She will be greatly missed. I have to resay this so you remember ... she NEVER had depression like this_ nor any suicidal thoughts EVER.,F,24,2  months,9/29/2006,Zyban
347, 5, Stop Smoking,Dizzieness_ headache_ general feeling of crazieness,I have been taking this for 6 days and have almost stopped smoking.  The habit seems hardest to break and it feels weird not to smoke.  I have been smoking since I was twelve and was up to two or more packs a day!  People would laugh at me when I said I wanted to quit.  This drug does make you feel crazy but hang in there it does get better and it works!,F,32,6  days,9/28/2006Email,Zyban
348, 5, anti smoking,insomnia_skin rash_ anxiety.,As much as I am very impressed with this drug -it really does help greatly against craving- I strongly feel that its side effects are quite vicious and would advice anybody to STOP TAKING IT as soon as you feel confident being able to do without. I have taken it for exactly 3 weeks_at the end of which I suffered pretty irritating skin rash_ insomnia with an average 3 hrs sleep in 10 days_ and occasional but intense anxiety attacks. Don't let yourself be fooled thinking these are withdrawal pangs.The physical effects of stopping are minimal and these side effects are 100 % drug related_ although not everybody is equally sensitive. Meanwhile_ one week after quitting on the drug I am doing very fine without it and not smoking almost as easily ! You can do it too !,M,47,3  weeks,9/19/2006Email,Zyban

I was afraid that I'd be stuck feeling like that for the rest of my life.  It was a hellish week.  It's been over 2 days since I stopped dosing and most of the residuals from the side effects are gone and I feel so much better_ back to my old self.

351, 5, To stop smoking,The first time I had insomnia and dry mouth. Four years later_ after starting to smoke again_ I now have tightness of the chest_ irratibility_ depression_ no energy-very tired_ but no insomnia or mouth dryness like the first time. (My husband says the above is nothing compared to what he is putting up with ;0),I first learned about zyban in the US. I was afraid to take it because I like a drink and you are not allowed to drink with it. Five years ago I moved to the UK and went to the Dr. to discuss zyban once more and was told you can have a drink with it_ just not excessive drinking. So_ I took it for 2 wks couldn't sleep_ was a disaster_ so quit taking it but I also quit smoking too! I figured if I hadnt smoked for a week why couldnt I just continue not smoking and thats what I did.......until 4 years later. Last Dec. I started smoking again_ only socially. Then it became more and more until I decided to take zyban again. I started taking it quit for a wk then started smoking again. A month later I started taking it again_ stopped smoking and things are going good. Do have tightness in the chest_ feels like I am stressed_which I am_ and want to knock someone upside the head_ but it will all be over soon and I will be smoke free again! Good Luck everyone!!!

359, 5, Stop Smoking,Sleep interruptions - waking up every few hours for first two weeks.  One day of mouth blisters.,Had smoked for last 18 years.  Began pills.  Quit smoking on the 6th day.  Did not feel the need to have that next cigarette. Continued with medication for 5 more weeks.  Was afraid of cravings upon stopping drug_ but they are basically non-existent. Have now been smoke free for over 7 weeks and counting! My difficulty is association - certain activities go with a cig.  Really need to talk myself through the want !,F,38,6  weeks,7/23/2006Email,Zyban

361, 5, Nicotine addiction,This is really a follow up to my previous rating.  See below - Same title!!Side effects have subsided to virtually nothing.  Some irritability (Mind you_ I always was a prick!! :-) and a little bit of tiredness but nothing worth mentioning.,Well I had my last cigarette over a month ago and have managed to stay smoke free in all environments including clubs and bars which I thought would be impossible.  Getting to th epoint where I can now no longer stand the smell of smoke.  However_ do still get the occassional craving.  Will be dropping off medication from two a day to one a day for remainder of course sometime this week.  All in all_ I've survived and rarely think about smoking now.  The medication has definetly done what it was supposed to_ and I look forward to a much happier and healthier cigarette free life!! good luck to you all!,M,33,45  days,7/17/2006Email,Zyban

365, 3, Smoking cessation,Urticaria_ Pruritis_ Flushing_ Vasculitis,Took zyban for 6 days (1+1+1+2+2+2) and discontinued on 7th. Had drug rash on 6th day itself but continued on 6th by taking 2 150mg. By 7th it was evident that I had a huge problem on my hand. Skin was itching all over and became red. Quit on 7th evening and has been off for 8 days now. Zyban helped with withdrawal for about 4-5 days after I quit zyban & nicotine. It definetely works by keeping the dopamine from being taken up. However_ my immune system which is extremely tolerant to pill popping was not so kind with zyban. It brought out the big guns and started shooting up my body. Had blood vessels shot (vasculitis) and was put on stiff dose of 50mg prednisone for 7 days. Keep in mind that prednisone is not to be taken lightly. This is another dangerous drug which not used well can hurt you in the long run. But thank god for Prednisone tablets and cortisone cream without which my life would have been hell on earth for a week. All in all I'll give thumbs up to zyban for working o,M,31,6  days,7/4/2006,Zyban

368, 5, Stop smoking!,Days 1-6: Nothing butAfter i started taking 2 a day i found it slightly hard to get to sleep and would wake up earlier than i wanted and therefore would feel tired everyday! I am day 14 now and am sleeping a lot better but still feel tired most days. I had two days well i had CRAZY anxiety and depression. It was right after i started taking 2 a day_ but it passed and now am fine looking forward to finishing the course and being smoke free!,You honestly don't like smoking for the time you smoke on Zyban. I was smoking for the sake of it but putting the smoke out half way through. Once you fully stop then of course you get slight cravings but nothing you can't handle very easily. I luckily had minor side effects so i think the drug is awesome. The only thing you can do is try it and if it works for ya think what a change in your life that is! Good luck!,M,22,14  days,6/20/2006,Zyban
369, 3, For the sake of my health & wallet,Dry mouth is a biggie - and oddly the ability to concentrate more_ i've always been the type to have a thousand things going on at once and never get anything done!  In the last week i've finished 3 projects that have been in the works for months. Hmmm.  The other odd thing is the cravings (i haven't hit my quit date yet) have become stronger!

370, 5, Nicotine Addiction!,From day 8 through to about day 12_ I experienced some minor headaches and very fitful sleeping patterns.  I was not able to sleep until after midnight and was waking every 2 hrs.  However_ this did subside when I started taking my second tablet at about 1:30pm instead of about 5:30pm.  I have had some tremors from time to time and some joint soreness but all relatively minor.,I think you still need to want to quit.  The drug won't do it all for you.  I designated a stop day (about day 9 I think) and stuck to it.  By then cigs had started to taste reall bad and I was less inclined to smoke anyway as I wasn't enjoying them as much.  I'm still feeling the cravings_ but the Zyban is definetly helping reduce their intensity.  The big test was last w/end.  Out in a bar until very late and managed to make it through the night without smoking.  But it still requires individual self control.  It won't remove the cravings completley_ and you have to commit to the program.  Good luck!,M,33,18  days,6/14/2006Email,Zyban
371, 5, Quit Smoking,Some mild ear ringing_ difficulty getting to sleep_ only lasted for first week or two. Have continued to have increased energy and overall happiness.,I quit smoking 4 months ago without the use of Zyban. I started having a lot of the side effects and symptoms that are listed here by some. This includes extreme anxiety_depression_ mood swings_ crying_ unhappiness etc. After 3 months I thought I was going crazy and decided to try the Zyban and I immediately started to feel better and my anxiety and depression has completely lifted. I think many that have quit smoking and started Zyban at the same time are confusing some of the possible symptoms of quitting smoking and in fact some might be worse without the Zyban. Just a thought.,F,40,4  weeks,6/14/2006,Zyban
372, 5, To quit smoking,The side effects I experienced are... dry mouth_ mild insomnia and decrease in libido..,I decided to try this medication because everytime I tried to quit I failed.. I've been smoking on and off for 20 years. In the last 5 years quite a lot. I didn't understand how this medication could all of a sudden make you not WANT to smoke. By the 3rd day I noticed all of a sudden I didn't get the hit from the nicotine.. The cigarette starting not giving me the satisfaction it use to.. But I continued to smoke_ I started to think I wasn't going to get rid of the desire to smoke. I couldn't believe that on my 11th day of taking Zyban I woke up and knew I didn't WANT a cigarette !!!! I couldn't explain it _ it still amazes me how one day in my head ... I WAS DONE!!! It didn't bother me to not smoke_ I could be around people smoking and still didn't want one. I wasn't grumpy or irritable. I'm on my 14th day and have no desire to ever pick up a cigarette again. I'm completely amazed and couldn't be happier !!!!

373, 5, To quit Smoking,The only side effect I experienced was sleeplessness but it only lasted a week.  I was getting up so early that I decided to change my work hours to start earlier.  Not only do I avoid now being stuck in traffic_ which has cut a good 50 minutes of my commute time_ but now I have time to go to the gym.  So_ between getting up early and working out I get so tired that on my second week I was sleeping like a baby.,Besides for sleeplessness (which went away on week 2) I have not had any other side effects.  I quit smoking completely 5 days ago.  I still think about smoking about twice a day but the urge goes away quickly.,M,46,17  days,5/31/2006,Zyban

375, 5, Quit Smoking,none for the first two weeks_ then anxiety attacks started and mild depressive feelings every now and then. After three weeks i couldnt manage to sleep longer then 0500 every morning_ that is in my case 4 to 5 hours.,"So_ i am f***ing tired but cant sleep _ slightly to moderately depressed and i have had some anxiety attacks. These side effects will probably stick with me as long as i take the drug. BUT: I quit smoking as easy as can be_ even before the stopdate i had no use for smoking_ the Zyban takes off the enjoyability that is in the cig normally. And because you dont get the little ""kick"" from the nicotine you actually start wondering what on earth you are doing with that cigarette anyway.So. i have been off cigs for 4 weeks now_ 6 weeks of Zyban_ and the side effects are quite annoying yet hardly a problem compared to my addiction :) Dr told me that the side effects will go away a week after quitting Zyban so i dont really care anymore about the side eff_ it will pass and i will be off the smoking addiction forgood :) After smoking more then 2 packs a day for more then 25 years and 6 attempts to quit with or without help and never lasting longer then a day or even an hour or two I",F,38,4  weeks,5/24/2006Email,Zyban

The only other issue I've experienced is a lack of coordination/concentration.  This is not good for a drummer.,"There is NO WAY I could have stopped smoking without Zyban (at least a pack a day for 22 years).  Really helps minimize the cravings and provides a ""no big deal"" attitude towards quitting.  I am a little concerned about coming off the drug.  Will cravings come back when I quit?  Don't want to be dependent on any medication.  Drinking intensifies the urge to smoke so I suggest avoiding excessive drinking.

I've never been paranoid or high before so this was frightening. Unfortunately started smoking again after 4 months. This all occurred 2 years ago.

Day 3 of taking zyban couldn't even smoke a whole cigarette_ was wondering why I was smoking in the first place.  It was not enjoyable anymore.  Have been taking 1 pill a day for 3 weeks.  When I tried 2 pills a day a felt like I was stoned.  Tingling in my mouth and throat.  Dry mouth.

I also experienced some back muscle pain and dry mouth. Things are calming down now. The nausea_ however was gone by day 4. I still feel all of the above but 80% less intense. Now I'm tackling the lack of concentration and focus (having a thought in my head_ forgetting it 5 seconds later_ and then taking a couple of minutes again to remember what it was.) I haven't really experienced the emotional side effects that some have. As for craving a cigarette_ I still do_ but I find that I don't enjoy them as much.

I've read all of the comments and am envious of those who received the desired result without going through these symptoms. I didn't find this website until last night and I'm glad I did. I thought I was having some bizarre adverse side effects that were not normal and was getting quite alarmed....should I go to the ER...wait to go to the doctor... But now I find that I'm not alone in my misery. Between days 4-7_ I felt high as a kite...but not in a good way. I'd lapse into moments of extreme dizziness and then go back to the baseline high. My ears have been ringing since day 3 and this hasn't subsided yet. My brain did actually feel like it was twisting and my eyeballs felt like they were going to be sucked into my skull! I had the shakes and my hands are still warm and palms are sweaty. I have maybe had 10 hours of discontented sleep in the past 7 days.

If it really doesn't seem to help_ I'll stop taking it....But I hope it does...and soon because I really don't want to take this drug any longer than I have to. I'm also supplementing the zyban with 45 minute sessions once a week with a public health nurse. From reading the comments on this website_ I'm sure that many who have read it are thinking_ ""How can you keep putting yourself through the nightmare of these horrid side effects?""

400, 5, to stop smoking,Most annoying side effect is my mouth feels constantly strange. This happened 24 hours after taking dug_ on day 12 now have bowel problems_ stomach upset_ anxiety_ muscle soreness nothing Major but I dont plan to be on this drug any longer than I need  to.,This is a remarkable drug with exceptional power I feel uneasy about being involved with. I physically could not continue smoking up to my quit date I had to stop sooner and I didn't want to as I felt i would fail if I was stressed before my quit date.  (You know when you normally cut down and are a basket case before you even give up)But I have stopped with next to no problems_ It isn't easy but it isn't completely horrific like cold turkey.  I know I have stopped smoking now forever and that has never been the case on other occasions when I have tried to quit. Not happy about the drug but the ends justify the means!,F,30,2  weeks,3/6/2006,Zyban
401, 5, to quit smoking,as described by pharmacy-restless_some joint pain tightness in chest_ some ringing in ears_ some anxiety. Now how many of the symptoms are caused by nicotine withdrawal as well as the caffeine withdrawal(i also gave up the bean_ don't go cold as i did  wean yourself it'll be less painful). I've read the comments and side effects here and wonder how many were caused by misuse and improper dosage of the drug...ya gotta do what the dr. says_ no alcohol_ no double dosing_ wait 8 hrs between doses_ and pay attention to the side effects_ not all drugs are for all people  side effects can be deadly  be aware and you'll love the effects.,after several attempts in my life to quit smoking zyban has given me new hope that i can be nicotine free. I hate the fact that i haven't been able to quit without an aid but hey the ends justify the means .,M,37,41  days,3/6/2006Email,Zyban
402, 4, smoking cessation,Dry mouth and *serious* constipation (not to be vulgar_ but voiding  requires a lot of straining),Even with the side effects_ I'm very pleased with the results. Went from chain smoking (3+ packs/day) to less that 1 pack/day during the first week and am still gradually decreasing use.,M,37,20  days,3/5/2006,Zyban
403, 4, Quit smoking,It started of fine when I went to two tablets a day.  I didn't want a smoke after 20 years. Just the craving a couple of times a day.  Just pop into head and then gone straight away.  Then the mood swings started! The irrational thoughts. The paranoia. The aggressive behaviour. I have 4 days to go and my husband is tring to hang in there.  My 15yo daughter just stays out of my way as I seem to just come down on her hard about everything.  For no rational reason that I can think of later when I go over what happened.  But all the time this is happening the cravings are just about gone.Sometimes days apart.  I had a drag of one about 8 days ago. Yuk. Didnt like the taste or what it felt like in my lungs.  Not for me ever again.  I just hope that after al of this that I will find out that is is the Zyban_ just not me without smoking.,Reccomend this to others to quit smoking.  But under close watch from loved ones who can support you through this and remind you that what you are doing and feeling is for the best for not only yourself but yor family and friends around you aswell.,F,35,54  days,3/4/2006Email,Zyban

405, 3, To Stop Smoking,Dreadful side effects. Started taking Zyban as directed_ immediately quit smoking (Fantastic) But I have suffered very badly. I have had no more than two hrs sleep per night_ tremors and pins and needles. Worse still I have had SEVERE thoughts of suicide and my partner has had to take time off work to watch me. I have felt as though I could quite calmly and methodically get in the car and drive at speed until I hit a brick wall. I have therefore stopped treatment before the tenth double up day_ as there is no way on earth I could survive it.,Be VERY careful if you have a history of depression_ as I have and DO NOT buy this or any other mind altering medicine over the internet without Doctor's input. I would strongly advise against taking this drug if you live on your own.ZYban certainly quelled any interest I may have in smoking---Despite bad side effects I had absolutely no thoughts regarding cigarettes. It has kick started my quitting_ but unfortunately It's effects are too severe for me to continue taking it. But_ I will NOT be picking up the fags--and the rest is up to me:),F,32,7  days,3/3/2006Email,Zyban

408, 4, quit smoking,When I first started the Zyban_ I was extremely tired all the time.  Now I can never sleep.  I sleep for 20 minute intervals at a time and hoping that this will pass soon.  Itchiness every once in awhile.  My skin broke out very badly and my menstral cycle is all messed up when it was completely regular always.  I don't know if these last two are because of the zyban so if anyone else has had these side effects_ please contact me at the email provided.,So far so good.  Been smoke free for a week now_ and I can even be around other ppl who smoke.,F,23,3  weeks,2/26/2006Email,Zyban
409, 5, quit smoking,Well...i have read all the other ratings and I can honestly say_ I had many of the side effects. Maybe some of it was nicotene withdrawal. The day I began 2 pills a day_ i became manic and depressed cried a lot for no reason_Insomnia for the first 2 weeks that i was on it (but took sleeping pills to help me)_ dizziness_ headaches_ sweating_ everything except the rash. I am now 23 days on it and all the side effects seem to have worn off except some nights of not sleeping well..unfortunately my appetite seems to be back...wondering if I will now gain weight_ (i lost a lot in the past 2 weeks...My big fear that stopped me from quitting in the past was getting fat.),Despite my side effects_ i set a quit date but ended up quitting 4 days before my set date because i no longer wanted a cig. For a smoker like myself (20 years)_ that is an absolute miracle. Stick through the side effects.I can be around other smokers which makes it easier to socialize. Just worried now that I will gain weight but then again i exercise tons!I would love to hear from someone in terms of whether they gained weight after the nasty side effects subsided_ I am sooo worried about this. It is now day 12 of not smoking and I feel GREAT!!! Even my skin looks better! Stick it out it is well worth the 2 weeks of side effect hell!,F,36,23  days,2/24/2006Email,Zyban

411, 4, to quit smoking,Getting a bit of hazyness. feeling a bit spacy. Neck tension which im not sure is down to the drug. Waking up at 4 in morning. Most unusual. Had a couple of mad bitch days last week but feel ok now.,On day 14. Had a few sneaky puffs in the first week but stopped altogether now. Dont have any bad cravings. Quite happy to go without. Great.,F,34, ,2/14/2006,Zyban
412, 5, Stop Smoking,Very few actually.  Sleep was difficult for a couple of weeks but that happens when you quit smoking anyway so not sure it is connected.  apart from that occasional headaches which again could be totally unrelated,I started Zyban and quit on day 8_ actually cannot believe how much it helped reduce the cravings.  Had a blip on day 15 of my quit when I lit a cigarette but it made me feel sick and I did not get the hit.  Not really craved since then.  Great Stuff,F,30,25  days,2/6/2006,Zyban
413, 5, To Stop Smoking,I have been taking zyban for the last 3 weeks stopped smoking on day 8 was very impressed that my cravings were not too bad. Sleeping was a nightmare woke up every morning at 3am wide awake took hours to get back to sleep_ i got very nervous if i was going anywhere like to get my hair done or someone else was driving and im not normally like that if i had not of been taking the medication i would of been worried about myself !! Then on the 10th day of not smoking i had an itcy arm in the morning then by 5pm i was covered in an itchy sore rash from head to toe i have not normally got sensitive skin. I rang the doctor he told me to stop taking the medication immediatly.,So today is my first day without zyban just patches but feel confident enough that i am over the worst part hopefully_ i hope so much that i can do it i feel so much healthier and the smell of other people smoking really annoys me.  Not sure if the doc will let me take them again but fingers crossed i stay smoke free.,F,24,3  weeks,2/2/2006,Zyban
414, 1, quit smoking,extreme paranoia_ violent mood swings_ suicidal thoughts_ insomnia_ dry mouth.,I took this to quit smoking without knowing that I could feel like I was going crazy. At the time_ there were no warnings on the fact sheet about suicidal thoughts etc. I may never have taken it if I'd known about all the side effects. I would not reccomend the use of this drug to quit smoking. This is an anti depressant also known as Wellbutrin. It made me psychotic in a matter of days. Boo Hiss.,F,29,4  times,2/1/2006,Zyban
415, 5, Stop Smoking,I hope this will help others considering Zyban. Before taking the drug I read the comments here (was a little concerned)_ and now having taken it_ and beed through the experience_ I feel a lot of the comments are confused on here (based on my experience). For sure_ sleeping can be difficult and this is turn causes problems in one's life (I have a high pressure job which became more difficult) - this was the worst part for me. I actually took sleeping tablets from time to time but I am not sure that is really the solution. Headaches? Yes from time to time but nothing too bad. Emotional? Angry (very)_ sad_ upset_ and taking things out in your close one's (which I hate but can't seem to stop myself)_ generally mixed up and spaced out. Yes all of these are true but this is as a result of nicotine withdrawlal and not the drug. I have given up before with patches and gum and felt exactly the same (so you can't blame Zybian).,This is a strong drug_ no getting away from that. I don't know what it does but it works. On the 8th day of taking zybian I doubled up and stopped smoking. The first day was the most difficult and now two weeks on I hardly feel like a fag. Yes you still get the urge a couple of times a day and to combat this I take gum (not often). You need to be prepared for a confusing and mixed up month but 90% of the side effects you would get anyway if you tried to stop smoking. Like I said_ I don't know how or what it does but from smoking 30-40 (for 20 years) a day I have stopped_ end of story. This is certainly worth going through to give up smoking. Good luck.,M,35,30  days,1/30/2006,Zyban

419, 5, to stop smoking,i had a few side effects but not any major problems. Headache_ insomnia and dizziness when i stood up. I was also a bit angry but that was probably nicotene withdrawl. The first three days on zyban were the worst. The first two days i felt really pissed off and bitchy and then the third day i felt really high and then the rest of the time i was on it_ i felt normal. Wasnt tripping out or anything. It made me feel like i wanted something but i didnt know what it was. I think it was my body wanting the nicotene but my mind was like no i dont feel like that. Sounds weird but it worked!,I really think it depends on the person with all these side effects. You just don't know until you try. Would you rather the chance of some side effects or die of cancer? I have quit now_ and i used to smoke a pack a day and I thought nothing would help me stop.,F,22,2  weeks,1/19/2006,Zyban

I thought when having the (less severe) side effects it was from not smoking and loosing my pet of 16 years. When the more serious things started to happen a friend found this website.  Thank GOD!!! This drug may help some but it can be very dangerous. It has been 75 days since I've had a cigarette but I don't think it had anything to do with Zyban.  I am still on the patches and have the gum.

430, 5, Depression/Anxiety,UPDATE - 15 November_ 2005Lexapro - ceased using 5 November_2005_ Wellbutrin (Zyban)- 150mg twice daily (7am and 3pm). Imovance 3.25 to 7.5 mg as required for sleep.Side Effects: During first couple of weeks_ a bit racy_anxious but this passed. Slight nausea_ but this too has diminished as the weeks have passed.,I am now in week 5 of using Wellbutrin (one week as a mono med) and I am finding it very effective in lifting mood and energy levels; plus_I have had an increase in concentration and libido with more intense orgasms.  As a number of other posters cautioned_ it did take a full 4 weeks for the Wellbutrin to begin to achieve a good level of  treatment effectiveness (and I certainly did want to throw the towel in a few times). My sincere thanks to everyone who shared their own experiences and emphasised the need to BE PATIENT and allow the drug time to level out the brain chemistry. As my anxiety seems to have improved with the Wellbutrin alone_ I am now comfortable that_ should I experience a serious anxiety increase_ I can_ per others experience and my discussions with my doctor_ use Xanax to manage such a moment. My tip: If you are starting out on a new anti-depressant_ copy and paste snippets of some of the postive med experiences you read about here and elsewhere.

My feet and hands were so swollen I could not walk or grip anything_ I was treated for dehydration_ I had terrible stomach pains and chills/sweats_ my face and lips were swollen_ and my throat swelled up. I am still recovering and it is day five. I can not recall the last time I felt so horrible. The Dr. that prescribed the drug gave me NO information about ANY side effects or allergic reactions. I hope that all those that are prescribed it_ are given an overview by their doctors about the risks.",Within 24 hours_ I went from 15 ciggarettes to 3_ but the pain I experienced was not worth it.

My doctor I found the itching to be more of a nuisance than anything else. My doctor warned me about a possible side effect of itching/hives. He examined me and offered me a choice of coming off Zyban or staying with it for the recommended 7 - 12 weeks and taking Benadryl for the itching. I had smoked a pack a day for 23 years and have managed to remain completely smoke free since I quit smoking two weeks ago.

Due to not feeling present in the here and now_ my ability to do the most basic things were affected - even a simple crossword or helping my daughter with her year 5 math homework became stretching to me - if you take it be prepared for Zombification!,After experiencing the Zyban experience_ I'm convinced that it works by making you feel so withdrawn_ screwed up and ill_ that you don't notice anything as little as nicotine withdrawal!  By the way_ I quit without aide - it just took a little of positive thinking....I scored this a 5 so that it appeared high on the review list.,M,37,7  days,11/3/2005,Zyban

Cigarettes tasted nasty after 10 days_ although if they are there I still want to smoke them - otherwise really not bothered about them anymore.  Itching started 3 days ago_ more in the early evening when the heating is on.  Not stopping me sleeping in fact getting best sleep for years.  The itching is really troublesome_ but I still would rather this than any mroe cigarettes_ so I will go with it - using Eurax lotion.  Itching seems to move around my body_ one place one moment_ another the next.  Warning - make sure you leave 8 hours between pills - I made the mistake of taking 2 together the first time I doubled up - I felt absolutely awful and took 2 days to settle down again - entirely my fault for not reading the packet.,Itch_ itch_ itch_ itch_ but no fags!,F,52,17  days,10/31/2005Email,Zyban
438, 5, give up smoking for good,After taking this drug three days I could def. feel the zyban in my blood_ made my mind go loopy_ ups and downs everyday.  Hives showed up sunday morn at 5a.m. (11 days after starting zyban) got progressivly worse all day long and then on sunday night I could hardly walk at all_ hives just covered me_ joints ached.  Had to go the ER and get pumped full of steroids to ease the hives_ total quit smoking cost over $2000 + 1 Crazy Mind Trip_ and worth every bit of it to Me!,I only took it for 1.5 weeks_ and had to quit obviously because of the insane hives I got_ but in the time I took Zyban I had this shift of consciousness and realized that it was not so much the cigarettes that I craved it was the feeling I got after I smoked the cigs that I needed.  After I realized this I began finding things to recreate that feeling_ relaxation technqs. riding mountainbike_ etc.  and it then it wasn't that difficult to quit.  Now I've been a nonsmoker for 2 mths. after smoking 12 years and I don't look back.,M,27,11  days,10/29/2005,Zyban

440, 4, to quit smoking,tiredness_ craving to smoke more_ posted earlier as a # 4 rating_ still have side effects_ tiredness and hard time getting in a deep breath but not trouble actually breathing,I haven't smoked for 4 days_ it really does take the edge off. I have a feeling that some of my side effects are withdrawal symptoms. Zyban is a brain drug and I think everyone has to keep that in mind when taking it. Have read that some drink while taking Zyban_ that is just stupid. Use common sense.,F,43,18  days,10/27/2005,Zyban

442, 2, Quit Smoking,First day was a slight buzz that kept me from impulses_ second day through the first week (150mg daily) no effect_ or very mild. Second week (300mg) too intense_ and very spaced out feeling. Had too stop over the next two days and it was a horrible withdrawal.,My doctor office is littered with products (clocks_ calendars_ etc) from pharmaceutical companies and their salespeople are always in the waiting room. My doctor just gives out samples all the time and never really mentioned side effects. Don't take this without reading more. My doctor (a kid_ really) is explaining to me basic anatomy I learned before she was born!,M,53,16  days,10/26/2005,Zyban

444, 4, To quit smoking,tiredness and the craving to actually smoke more,I am on Zyban and took one pill for 7 days and am now on 2 pills so far for 4 days. I am very tired could snooze alot_ but other than that I find I have a stronger craving to smoke. My quit date is in three days hope this works_ have smoked for 30 years a pack a day,F,43,11  days,10/20/2005,Zyban
445, 4, To help stop smoking,Incredibly itchy feet and palms of hands when I upped the dose to two pills a day.  This subsided and then I got 'hives'.  Extremely itchy big red blotches all over my torso_ neck_ back and head.  A few problems sleeping_ but this could be due to the itching/warm weather etc etc.  I would be reluctant to blame the zyban.,It seems to be working for me.  This is the second time I've tried it.  The first time - I completely lost my appetite and lost a scary amount of weight so stopped taking it.  This time the side effects are different_ but i'm not smoking_ so I feel it's been successful (so far),F,30,25  days,10/17/2005Email,Zyban
446, 2, To Quit Smoking,Had to go to the ER at my local hospital! Extreme itching_ rash_ hives.  Sleepy on 1st day_ hands started itching/tingling_ had goosebumps/chills on my arms by the 2nd day_ then spread to feet.  By 10th day_ Bright red raised bumps or welts of all sizes all over my body.  Unbearable itching_ burning_ and stinging spread rapidly all over my face_ neck_ ears_ and entire body literally by the minute! Again_ this didn't happen until the 10th day! (Feels like severe sun-poisoning or sun-burn!). Have stopped Zyban for 4 days now_ but the itching_ redness_ and hives are still present. I've been on Benadryl and steroids to get rid of the allergic reaction with little relief. Stop taking Zyban immediately if you start itching in your hands!  Believe me_ you do not want to find out days later that you're allergic to it and suffer like I have! I feel like ripping my skin off!,Zyban did help me cut down smoking by more than half_ but the side effects weren't worth it!  Zyban makes cigarettes taste bad as well as food_ so you lose weight too_ but the allergic reaction of the severe rash_ itching and redness just is not worth it!,F,36,10  days,10/17/2005,Zyban
447, 3, To quit smoking,I had the usual effects during the first week.  Smoke started to taste horrible.  I never experienced insomnia_ however I found myself waking at odd times (4 in the morning) being really confused at what time it was.  After I upped it to 2 pills a day_ I became easilly agitated.  I found that if I wasn't busy doing something specific_ I would zone out for long periods.  I was very numb emotionally.,I downed my dose to 1 pill a day_ today.  Hopefully I can retain the benefit of the drug and not the side effects.  If I continue with these symptoms then I will definately toss the drug and hopefully stay quit.,M,25,15  days,10/10/2005Email,Zyban
448, 5, to give up smoking,insomnia_ not too bad tho. Big impact on libido. very little interest in sex whilst taking it. discomfort in the stomach for about a week. cant sit still! moving around alot!,it works! this is the second time ive taken it.

450, 2, to quit smoking,It felt like zyban may have decreased my appetite_ but that is not saying much because I still ate a lot. Other than that I felt nothing from it.,I started taking one pill a day for the first 3 days and on the fourth day I started taking one pill in the morning and one pill 8 hours later. I have been on Zyban now for 8 days and I feel like having a cigarette like I always do. This drug has not helped me at all. I feel totally normal and I am thankful I did not get those bad side effects_ but I would have taken a few minor ones for Zyban to help me_ but no such luck. This wasn't for me_ but it may be for someone else. Cold Turkey here I come!,F,25,8  days,9/30/2005Email,Zyban

453, 1, to quit smoking,lightheadedness_ dry mouth_ stupidity_ lack of being able to function mentally for at least 2 weeks_ got better but still low ability in thinking and concentrating but a slight antidepressant effect,This has done nothing for my cravings.  At least as far as I think.  In fact for several weeks I smoked more than usual until I was just about choking from over smoking.  Then I got mad at Zyban and mad at my cigarettes and shouted at them as if they were living entities.  I'm 45 hrs nicotine free so far but don't think has anything to do with the Zyban and have been having strong cravings and been going through uncomfortable withdrawals.  Last night was hell_ not much sleep_ chills and sweating and pain.  But I'm hanging in there.,F,50,4  weeks,9/25/2005Email,Zyban

455, 1, Giving up smoking,Do not use Zyban. It makes you feel high. I found myself breaking out in laughter for no reason at all. Also broke down in tears for no reason. Its a very powerful drug. Be very wary of taking it. I wouldnt recomend it. Lots of research needed if thinking about taking zyban. Its a anti-depressant and it makes you float_ like walking on clouds. Beware it effects emotions severly.,,M,31,2  days,9/19/2005,Zyban
456, 5, Smoking,Tight neck & back muscles from day 5-10.  Problems falling asleep initially_ but has slightly decreased - meanwhile_ feeling very alert (never sleepy during the day).  Horrible itchy bumps (so bad that I think these may be hives from something other than Zyban). Upper stomach pain which has increased with time.  Slight mood swings_ but manageable.  Rare but painful urethra sensation_ though not during orgasms (which_ BTW_ are a bit more intense).,"If you are sick of being powerless over nicotine you must try this.  This has been my second time taking Zyban to cut the habit.  Last time was very successful_ but several emotional issues (relationship_ business & Sept. 11) came to a head right after I was weened off the drug.  Still_ I have been using in conjunction with ""the patch"" (which I have quickly decreased in dosage to 7mg/day) and have almost NO desire to smoke!  When I do_ the urge passes within 3 minutes (easy to take my mind of of it too).  In the short term this drug does cause me some pain_ but it is well worth one month of discomfort to save 10 years of my life.",M,31,18  days,9/16/2005,Zyban
457, 4, to quit smoking,I have been having a loud ringing in my head_ feels like pressure in my head. Bad insomnia is driving me crazy!

458, 5, smoking censation,Not many and most wear off with in one week. Here's a list_ but remember_ when you smoke cigarettes_ you get symptoms. decrease appetite_ decrease sensitivity of your taste buds_ lightheadedness_ Coughing_ nausea_ yellow teeth & fingers.   The Zyban side effects> dry mouth_ very slight dizziness_ decreased appetite. all decreased after one week. Good luck! Remember NOT to drink any ALCOHOL when taking Zyban or Wellbutrin. Really works folks!!,And the most scary is CANCER! Believe me! I work in the hospital and i see so many die from it or need portable oxygen where ever they go.   Zyban is an amazing drug!! I quit smoking on the 10 day. It's been 3 weeks since i had a cigarette and i don't miss it at all! I mean that! I'm so happy! After all_ it is an antidepressant. Zyban for me_ started to work on the 7 day. The taste of the cigarette was like smoking the most stale cigarette i ever tasted! In an hour i tried another Newport and it was more stale then the previous one. I stated rating the cigarettes on a rating scale > 0-10. 10 being the most enjoyment from the cigarette or 0 enjoying it the least. I guarantee you'll rate the cigs less and less. When i got to a {2 out 10}_ I said to myself no need to smoke anymore. Not enjoying it. Zyban is beginning to work with the taste. after 3 weeks or so_ the medicine boosts your mood and helps with OCD{Obsessive Compulsive Disorder} See_ smoking is a form of OCD.

We both have been very moody_ not sure if its from the drug or not smoking_ I would recommened this drug to people_ if they are strong enough to take it_ quitting smoking with or without zyban is difficult_just make sure and discuss with your doctor before any of it.,F,28,7  days,9/6/2005,Zyban
463, 4, quit smoking,Have been on it once a year for the last 2 years and now trying it for a third time.  Find the first 2 weeks pretty ordinary - headaches and feeling a bit out of it - pressure in head - but in the past have been fine after that and does stop me smoking brilliantly! Did have weird reaction this time when I took a zyrtec - anti histamine with it felt really bad and would be interested in finding out if anyone else has had this happen.,Worked until I went out with a smoker each time and the nicotine in saliva when kissing was enough to get me back on the cigs.

465, 3, to stop smoking,Retrograde ejaculation. i had a prostate problem (just swallen a little) and since i took zyban i am having retrograde ejaculations: in other words   the muscle which controls the opening of the bladder does not close properly and the sperm goes into the bladder. i looked at the causes of retrograde ejaculation and here they are: 1. Nerve damage caused by medical illness  This is especially common in men with multiple sclerosis or with long-term_ poorly controlled diabetes. WHICH I DON'T HAVE2.Side effects of medication_ including some drugs used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and some mood-altering drugs.(which i believe ZYban does),Otherwise_ the ZYban helped me to get out of the nicotin need_ and no other side effects.,M,42,2  weeks,8/31/2005,Zyban

After taking the medication for about 2 weeks_ I had a seizure at work!  I have never suffer from side effects from any other medication.,Obviously I quit immediately after the seizure.  I have not had another seizure since but the experience was absolutely horrifying.  This medication worked for my mother-in-law but not for me.  I am not sure its worth the risk.

It cost me a girlfriend_ and I'm still smoking. I'm still trying to quit_ but to be honest_ the Zyban would have killed me long before the smoking! Many of these,M,34,6  weeks,8/1/2005,Zyban
474, 4, Smoking Cessation,Itchiness_ no rash_ slight insomnia_ increased libido,My husband is a family physician_ and though this drug was prescribed by another physician_ I can honestly say that he has NEVER received subsidy for prescribing any medication. Canadian readers need to know that there are very strict laws controlling this practice in our country. I NEVER took more than one 150mg tab per day as I weigh 110 lbs. After 2 weeks post quit day I reduced to one every 2nd day.

480, 2, Smoking Cessation,After three days of one pill per day_ I upped the dosage to two.  On the evening of the fifth day I noticed restlessness and sleeplessness--as though I had overdosed on coffee.  Last night (day six) was very unpleasant.  I got about two hours sleep and couldn't stop thinking about a personal conflict I uncharacteristically embraced the day before.  Today I took only one pill_ but I still feel dry-mouthed_ agitated_ impatient_ short-tempered_  and--my wife assures me--I am behaving here and there like a real bastard.  I haven't altered my smoking habits yet_ but I have noticed that the cigarettes aren't as satisfying as they were before.,I'll give this a few more days at one pill a day.  If I still feel as crappy as I have the past several days_ I'll dump Zyban.  I think my MD should try this stuff before prescribing it to another patient; my pharmacist should try it_ as well.  I was told about the possibility of insomnia and the rare seizure--not that I would feel like I spent three days in a crack house.,M,50,7  days,6/3/2005,Zyban
481, 5, Quit Smoking,None.,I was able to quit smoking within 10 days of taking the pill.  Sometimes I have cravings but they are few and far between.

Good luck!,F,23,2  weeks,5/31/2005,Zyban

Awake every hour during the night.,Went back to my doctor who has advised me to stop taking zyban because of the hives_ this is a bad side effect apparently.  I am sorry to stop taking them as I have stopped smoking now for 4 days which is amazing for me.  Very little cravings with zyban,F,36,13  days,5/31/2005,Zyban
483, 4, quit smoking,agonizing joint pain_,This was my second time taking the drug.  FIrst time gave up smoking for 5 months and it was wonderful. No side effects or withdrawal.  Second time_ must have had an allergic reaction and discontinued using it prior to my quit date.  The joint pain was too much. Maybe my pregnancy changed my bodys reaction to certain drugs.

485, 3, quit smoking,the 1st couple days were great: i felt good and found myself 'forgetting' to smoke.  But then i followed directions and smoked 'normally': there was a tightness in my head and confusion as the quit date approached: but i was determined to stay with it. But on about day seven i awoke_ looked in the mirror and had blood in the white of one eye.  Scared_ i quit the pills and never made it to the 2nd stage.,I'm about to try again. All the doctors i've spoken to say there is no connection.  But after research_ i'm not so sure. Thanks to all who've posted: i will definitely NOT be increasing the dosage to 2 pills a day!!!  Like condoms i think zyban should be free. ps: in my opinion_ light headedness_ vertigo_dizzyness_etc. are NOT due to nicotine withdrawl_ but due to the sudden rush of oxygen that the brain has been deprived of from smoking!!! Doctors (gp's in particular) are dumb (selfish): 19th century: age of reason_ 20th century: age of analysis_21st century: age of UNCERTAINTY: USE YOUR COMMON SENSE!,M,46,7  days,5/9/2005Email,Zyban
486, 3, Stop Smoking,Hives_ stomach aches_ severe chest pains.,This is the second time that I have been on Zyban_ the first time I quit for almost a year (364 days)_ that was almost four years ago. Side effects are a little different this time. First time had bad stomach aches_ panic attacks_ rapid and irregular heartbeat.  I have not smoked in almost two months. Upon my doctors recommendation I was going to take the meds for a year_ unfortunately I have changed my mind. Within the last week I have experienced severe symptons which I thought were unrelated to the Zyban_ I was wrong_ the hives are driving me absolutely bonkers and the severe chest and arm pain scared the heck out of me_ I thought that I was having a heart attack. Once I found this web page I realized that it was the meds. I'm done now_ I'm not taking it any more. There are a couple of good things that came out of taking it_ I'm sleeping better and I have an increased libido.  I'm going to do my best to stick with quitting because I don't ever want to take Zyban ever again.,F,37,9  weeks,5/7/2005Email,Zyban

I could not function well at work.,Zyban is an Anti Depressant_ everybody knows that.  What people don't know is what it will do to your mind and how it will make you feel.

In fact The Zyban company pays these Doctors to prescribe this drug_ so they hand it out like candy and do not inform the public to the affects.

555, 5, to quit smoking,Now that I am on two tabs a day I find I wake at about 3.am. and stare at the ceiling for a few hours. However_ I feel this is a small price to pay for quitting smoking.

556, 1, Same drug as Wellbutrin,See Wellbutrin (anti-depressant)side-effects. For some reason this same drug is marketed under 2 different names_ Wellbutrin & Zyban.,2nd day @ 150mg got a very big (artificial)boost of energy and hands itched. Was a lot more active which increased back pain. 3rd day increased to 300 mg_ could not swallow solid food (no sore throat though) for about 6 hours but was able to swallow liquids...Dr. had me discontinue for 2 days and start again @ 150mg. Within an hour started vomiting & could not swallow again...Be careful with this med._ even if perscribed_ since it may mix poorly with other meds you are taking_ in my case Wellbutrin_ Lortabs_ Paxil_ Celebrix_ Ultracet... All under same doctor's supervision. Also was not told this is same as Zyban. Since I smoke and have no desire to quit_ this was not a good choice of med.,F,41,3  days,3/7/2003,Zyban
