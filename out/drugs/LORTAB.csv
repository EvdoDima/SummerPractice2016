3, 1, Spinal stenosis herniated disks,My legs and feet became very swollen to the point that I could not wear a pair of shoes. My knees and ankles were painful to move. I had been taking Vicodin for back problems without any reactions. The doctor changed my meds to lortab and the trouble began. I was taken off Lortab and told they don't make Vicodin any more.,,F,61,3  weeks 1X D,3/31/2014,Lortab

6, 3, Fractured humerus (arm),Muscle contractions when falling asleep (myoclonus)_ constipation_ nighttime anxiety / fear.,I was surprised at how little this medication reduces pain.  I was expecting much more. OTC Ibuprofen was more effective. The sudden nighttime muscle contractions were a problem - they woke me up and weren't good for a healing broken bone that needed to be immobile. Ouch.,F,44,14  days7.5 1X D,7/21/2013Email,Lortab
7, 3, Lower back muscle tear,Dry mouth_ loopy disconnected feeling.  Constipation and difficulty urinating.,This med has worked for me with past injuries i.e. wisdom teeth and sprained shoulder.  But this strained lower back muscle affliction seems to not be as treatable with this Lortab 10 mg. If pain level is normally 10_ this makes it a 7.  Better then nothing I suppose.....,M,32,3  days10 3X D,6/11/2013,Lortab
8, 5, Chronic foot pain,I have a high tolerance to narcotics so I don't get many side effects mentioned. Occasionally my nose will itch terribly. I was on Vicodin for 7mos for the same issue and it did start to bother my stomach. The pain I have will never go away so being on pain meds is just something I have to live with to be able to continue working. It's as good as any of this class of narcotics I believe.,,F,44,3  weeks750/500,6/8/2013,Lortab
9, 4, sciatica_ chronic disk degeneration,Would be sick to my stomach if I didn't take a Benedryl with each dose. Occasional vivid dreams about mutated or injured animals. Dreams were upsetting_ horrific nightmares on same subject when I was also on hormone meds. I take Lortab twice daily. The result is a decrease in pain for 2-3 hours so I can get up_ take a walk_ and do some physical therapy. Works better with the addition of Xanax 1mg.,,F,56,2  years10/325,5/3/2013Email,Lortab

13, 4, Pain from MS and Ovarian Cancer,No side effects at all. Works great when I use it. I only use this as needed but it won't allow me to write that in the usage section. I do not use this everyday. Only as needed,I have this medication on hand in the elixir form. If I need it_ I take 15 Mls every 6 hours as needed but I rarely take a full dose. I take 5 mls or 10 mls max. It helps my pain alot and allows me to sleep but I only use this when I have a spell of pain. I will never understand how someone becomes addicted to this medication. A 10 day supply of this form of Lortab lasts me a month_ sometimes two months. I use non narcotic pain meds in between with decent results. I can't imagine being addicted to this. I'd be sick of I took the whole dose let alone this medication daily. The day may come when I will need more of this medication but till then I'm very careful about using it. I'm thankful for this medication however because when I need it_ it really truly helps me.,F,38,  1X D,10/20/2012,Lortab

16, 3, Tonsillectomy,Dependency,I was prescribed the liquid form of Lortab to treat pain after my tonsils were removed. It helped greatly with pain relief. However_ I was not aware of potential dependency_ and when I stopped taking it after two weeks I went through rather unpleasant withdrawal symptoms that included severe drug cravings. I would come home_ run to the bathroom and take a swig from the bottle. I never experienced anything like it in my entire life... It took another 2 weeks of slowly tapering down. Not a bad drug per se_ just be aware of the fact that you might develop dependency.,F,42,2  weeks 1X AN,3/26/2012,Lortab

I never wouldve dreamed of being an addict but it happened so fast and easy! I would not advise anyone to take this no longer than a couple of weeks because your body becomes so dependent on it and before you know it you are addicted!:( this med has ruined my life!,,F,30,1  years7.5,1/14/2012,Lortab

32, 5, Kidney stones,Slight itchy feeling at times_ dizziness_ very drowsy sometimes_  slight constipation. However very good pain relief.,I found that Lortab worked well in relieving the pain I had due to kidney stones_ and if you've ever had a kidney stone you'll know how big of an accomplishment that is. As far as being addicted to this drug_ I don't understand. I like that it helps me but I feel that once I'm done with it I couldn't care less about it. So for me it isn't as addictive as people make it out to be. Overall_ Lortab served its purpose for me well_ with its good well outweighing the side effects.,F,16,10  days500 3X D,11/2/2011Email,Lortab

34, 5, annoying leg pain_ hip and L5-S1,Normal constipation that comes with taking opiates/opioids.  Tolerance seems to build up quicker than tramadol for me.  These may only work for 2-3 hours max after an extended period of time.,Hydrocodone works for the little time it lasts.  I've had hip/back pain and leg weakness for 10 years with no dx.  I tried to tough it out for so long (drinking alcohol_ using marijuana_ all sorts of drugs) but I finally said screw it and got on some pain meds with a small dose of xanax (alprazolam).  A doctor I trust told me I'll probably need to take pain meds the rest of my life and just to keep the pain under control to be able to function.  For constipation_ here's what you do.  Make sure you take either stool softeners/laxatives and/or Miralax (plenty of fiber) either 2 hours before or 2 hours after your scheduled dose. I eat a fiber bar every morning with coffee also.  Once I started doing that_ I've been going normal again (best I've gone in years).  Why don't they make extended release Hydrocodone minus the tylenol?  That would be great!!!!!!!!!,M,31,3  months7.5 3X D,8/18/2011Email,Lortab
35, 5, Degenerative disk disease,Constipation_ nausea if mistakenly take too much.,Take responsibly and it works very well. It has helped my back pain so much that I have skipped my 6 month spinal block because the Lortab allows me to do yoga_ walk_ and other exercise to help my muscles (girdle)_ to help support my spine. *DRINK LOTS OF WATER to avoid constipation and you will be fine. I have never have to worry about if I wish to stop_ I have stopped several times with only shaking_ then I am fine. If you can use this_ just be smart.,F,42,9  months7.5 mg 2X D,8/10/2011,Lortab
36, 1, Dental Wisdom Teeth Extractions,I have HORRIBLE dreams!  Along with this_ it has caused back pain_ and constipation.

I have done this ever since_ and have no pain whatsoever.,,M,21,2  days 1X D,7/24/2011,Lortab
37, 4, Broken metatarsal,BLOATING_ gas_ nausea_ sweating,Lortab does what it is supposed to do  - it releaves the pain. However_ I have to take it with food so I do not get nauseas_ hot_ and feel like I am about to pass out. The only thing I hate about it is that it makes me extremely bloated. It hasn't made me constipated.,F,21,5  days5 mg 3X D,7/13/2011,Lortab
38, 4, Unidentified abdominal pain,Slight dizziness_ occasional euphoric feeling_ drowsiness,The medication did a great deal to take the edge off when I began experiencing mysterious abdominal pain. I was prescribed Lortab in order to lessen my pain while my doctor was waiting for ultrasound and blood test results to identify what specific condition I was suffering from. Occasionally_ I felt light-headed or dizzy_ especially when the pills first kicked in. I did not feel itchy or nauseous_ though_ which was a pleasant surprise since I sometimes have a bad reaction to Percocet  (which I've been prescribed after two different surgeries). I would advise people to take caution with driving until they know how the medication affects them. For instance_ my first dosage didn't kick in until almost 2 hours after I took it_ and it was pretty mild_ but subsequent dosages felt much more powerful and may have compromised my ability to drive long distances.,F,22,5  days5/500 2X D,6/19/2011,Lortab
39, 5, back pain,Ditto a previous post.  Incredible sinus and breathing relief.  ( I have concerns about its addictive nature.)   Some minor constipation.  Pleasant transient euphoria.,I would appreciate feedback.   There is no pharmaceutical explanation for the amazing help Lortab provides in clearing my breathing.

41, 4, Stomach Viral Bug/ Ache,About 1 out of every 5 pills would cause a very brief period of dizziness_ but generally it made all pain subside_ made my arms and legs feel very warm and tingly and light.  Takes about 1 hour for the pill to take full effect and wears off in less than 4 for me. Euphoria is a really good word to descibe this_ like you just took a hot bath and sunk in to a deep soft couch.  Sometimes my knees would feel light/ weak if I stood up too quickly.  Would use again if needed.,,M,32,5  days10/500 3X D,3/31/2011Email,Lortab

43, 4, 10/500,None unless I take more than 2 at a time,With lower back surgery in my L2 through L5 and having arthritis I cannot move for the first 2 hours of the day.  Some day it works great other days it don't.  I work 5 days a week so I wont take them on my days off and on holiday.  Just so I wont get addicted to them.  My mother and Uncle both have major surgery with no relief what so ever my mother wont take anything and is in constant agony.  My Uncle takes Oxycontin and lays in bed all day.  Both have enough metal in there back to build a Terminator. Both said they if they had to do it over they would not do the operations again. Both have had many operations,M,45,5  years 4X D,2/27/2011Email,Lortab
44, 5, Neuropathy_ ankle fracture_ chronic,No side effects really.  The benefits outweighed the side effects.,I have had chronic pain issues for several years. I did go long periods of time without anything_ periods of time using only OTC meds_ and I have experienced the withdrawal stage of Lortab and could tell a difference in my pain tolerance but after my ankle injury and disabling pain from neuropathy in the entire length of my leg I had to submit to the use of opiates to control the pain so I could function and have any quality of life. 800 Motrin in adjunct with Tylenol alternating wasn't curbing the pain_ so I did thoroughly examine the pros and cons of both Over The Counter and prescribed painkillers. I still have pain_ I know it will never completely go away. I just want to be able to control the pain_ not let it control me.  I agree that pain meds can be abused_ but taking them is a privelage and I choose not to abuse that privelage. I can't imagine living in pain so bad that all I can do is lay and waste away. I do understand that your pain tolerance is lessened due to the dopamine which is released by the opiates becomes dependant_ but I think there is a medium there and I have come to terms with it.  I would live a miserable life without the proper use of my medication. I might add_ I have to take Motrin 800_ Lyrica_ and muscle relaxants in adjunct with the Lortab for it to be effective. It doesn't fully work unless I take it all regularly.,F,38,7  months5/500 4X D,2/20/2011Email,Lortab
45, 5, Severe knee pain (damage/arthritis),A little itching that went away,"I'm a 59 year old mechanic on my feet all day with a lot of walking. If I didn't take Lortab I COULD NOT do my job.  Doctors refrain from prescribing pain meds and warn about being ""addicted"" to pain meds where you end up taking them all the time.  Funny how the medical profession has absolutely no qualms about patients being ""addicted"" to blood pressure meds_ cholesterol lowering meds_ blood thinner meds (think of hundreds of other meds) that have LIFE THREATENING side effects and are often far worse than the ailment they're supposed to be treating (most just treat the symptoms_ not the disease). A lot of pain meds are generic now so they're cheap.  Big Pharma can't get rich off of that.  They relieve/lessen pain_ they work.  The potential for abuse is very real_ but I've found a Lortab taken during a severe flu allowed me to get up_ eat some soup_ watch TV_ feel halfway normal.  Until you experience pain 24/7 you really can't pass judgment on this issue.  Keep it out of site_ NOT in the medicine cabinet where the wrong person can find it.",M,59,3  years7.5 mg 2X D,1/12/2011,Lortab
46, 4, FX'd Distal Humerus,Slight constipation_ restless sleep.,This pain medicine is the only way I can get through a day.  I fractured (broke in half) my distal humerus in my strong arm 5 weeks ago.  Because surgery is a bad option and the resetting and healing take longer the pain is quite severe.  I had a spinal fusion of two ruptured discs several years ago and this break is much worse.  When I wake up every morning I am in agony until about 30 minutes after taking.  Great medicine though probably not for everyone.,M,38,5  weeks7.5 4X D,1/5/2011,Lortab
47, 5, Degenerative Discs in Lower Back,Nausia_ some constipation_ dizziness_ itching,I have dealt with back pain for several years and have always been unable to take pain medicine because I am allergic to all codeine  based pain killers (as are my mother and sister).  Every time I tried them I would end up vomiting for hours on end.  After my mother had hip replacement surgery she was given Lortab 10/500 with visteril for nausia and was able to tolerate it.  I talked with my physician and explained that I only needed it a couple of times each week at bedtime.  When taken with the Visteril I have no problems with nausia_ (make sure you take it 30 minutes before taking the Lortab)_ and am able to get some rest.  I do wake up during the night quite a bit but it's worth the trade off to lay in bed and not be absolutely miserable all night long.,M,39, 10/500 1X D,12/21/2010,Lortab

49, 5, Back pain,mild itching_ sweating_ sleep disturbances..PAIN CONTROL,Ive been on lortab for several months and when i first started takin them experienced a high feeling_ however_ since ive  been on them for a while i really have no side effects at all. My back pain is zero when i take them and is about a 7 when i dont. It has been a miracle drug for me. It does seem to motivate me..but that may be just due to good pain control. I would recommend it_ but not for someone who gets addicted to drugs. I do notice i get funny looks from the pharmacist and cashiers when i get my prescription. I think if they were in pain they may not look at me like that.,F,38,7  months5/500 4X D,11/29/2010,Lortab
50, 5, Lupus (SLE)_ AVN_ chest pain,Pain dramatically reduced_ but not completely gone (but when you're in as much pain as I everyday this is nothing short of a miracle) When i first started taking them I had some slight nausea that went away quickly. I am able to function and take care of my son better than I ever would have if I remained in the amount of pain that I was in for several years before starting this medication. Overall I am a much happier_ better functioning member of society,When people (nurses_ pharmasists_ average joe's) learn of my medication I am instantly judged and I find this very angering_ but I try to understand that if they really new my medical history and/or lived inside my body for one minute they wouldn't be so hateful. I understand that there are some poor souls that abuse this medication and I have first hand witnessed the destruction it can bring on one's life (not to mention the lives of everyone they love and hurt)but there are many more that don't abuse it and_in fact_ benefit greatly from it. My advice is keep it to yourself_ and cut out those people in your life that may try to take advantage of you (i.e. looking in your medicine cabinet) because chances are they're not the type of people you should be hanging around anyway_ this could also prompt your dr to revoke your prescription.,F,27,6  years10/500 4X D,10/21/2010,Lortab

More recently I was prescribed Lortab for a sprained lower back_ seems to take the edge off but the side effects are almost not worth it.

72, 3, Rotator Cuff & Bicep tendon surgery,Insomnia_ bloating_ constipation_ itchy scalp_ increased serious demeanor,"Bloating can be addressed by drinking plenty of water and taking daily walks. Constipation can be addressed by eating apples_ vegi's_ and a supplemental bran product (inactivity and sitting too long does NOT help this condition!). Itchy scalp is annoying_ scratching it can aggravate the condition_ and little can be done for relief (I use Tea Tree Oil shampoo). Cramps in calves can be an indication of being sleep deprived_ inadequate hydration_ and a need for mineral supplementation. I increased my water intake and ate a banana daily. Relief from discomfort with the help of Lortab is subtle (for me). I am only aware of it's effectiveness when I go without taking any for a couple days. I've determined that I don't need to take it ""once every 4-6 hours""_ as a dose in the morning seems to be effective for most of the day. I find taking two tabs to be more effective_ but I fear increasing my resistance to it. I also intentionally stop taking it for a couple days every couple weeks. Better too_ that I avoid from taking any prior to the end of the day.... as it it disrupts my sleep. An unusual side effect has come to light since taking Lortab.

I started noticing the itching on the second day but it has increased dramatically on the third and now I've stopped_ switching back to Ibuprofen 800. It was fairly effective at numbing the pain_ allowing me to get some much needed sleep (prior to this I only got 3 hours in 3 days)_ but the itching is starting to drive me crazy_ and probably isn't a good sign. I didn't really feel much or any euphoria_ but this may be because I experimented with harder drugs as a teen and have a slight tolerance_ so I may get less benefit than a person who hasn't been exposed to normal recreational drugs in the past. 5-500 HYDROCODONE APAP,M,30,3  days,8/30/2009,Lortab

I generally require a prescription of 15 pills about 3 times a year_ and am very careful not to ever take more than that because I understand that it can be highly addictive.  It affects me differently each time I take it.  Sometimes I will take it and will feel very euphoric and high and happy_ and sometimes it will make me violently ill with vomiting.  The only consistant thing I have experienced is that it does relieve my pain.  If you can tolerate the medication and can trust yourself not to become addictive_ it is a good choice for pain relief.,F,30,10  years,8/4/2009,Lortab

Still experienced pain while on medication so I can not really say that it worked that great for me.,Took it for 6 days after surgery.  Have been having insomnia for 5 days since getting off of it.

At first_ I would get nauseated and drowsy but have found if I eat with or before I take my pill_ the nausea isn't there.  Also_ after about a month or two of taking it_ I no longer get drowsy_ but instead get a rush of energy_ just enough to get me through the day.  I do experience bouts of constipation_ but that may be from IBS.  I would recommend this for fibro pain if you can get your doctor to prescribe it.

130, 3, tonsillectomy,I had to take the liquid form.  The liquid form made me have very weird dreams.  I woke up a few times and wasn't sure where I was.  I woke up with a fear.  Probably from the weird_ hallucination like dreams.  It did not seem to help much with the pain.  As I found out a tonsillectomy is very painfull so maybe nothing could have eased the pain!!  I took the pill form 9 years ago when I had a herniated disc in my back and it helped tremendously with that pain but if I did not eat something first I would get nauseated.  It also made me feel sleepy.  The liquid form reacted differently with me than the pill form.,,F,46,3  weeks,9/15/2007,Lortab

I can now work full time_ enjoy my life and feel almost as good as I did before I developed interstitial cystitis.  I especially like that the TV program ""House""_ explains that being relieved from pain makes the doctor able to practice his profession and help people in need.  He states he is ""addicted""_ but since the addiction helps better his life and others'lives_ he is not that concerned about it being addictive.  The only people who heavily censor those who take narcotics for pain_ (not for a high) are those who have never dealt with pain that doesn't ever stop_ stops you from being able to do anything but lie in bed in agony_ and carries the likelihood that it will never stop_ the disease for which it is used being incurable at this point.

Actually_ I felt more alert and had more energy.,Although it was prescribed for a tooth extraction I take them occasionally for an almost constant headache and backache. So I did not take them several days in a row consistently. I don't like taking meds but some days the pain is so bad I can't stand it. So I'll take 1/2 to 1 tablet and it works great for hours.

Downside was all it did was mask the pain and not get rid of it. It made me loopy. I had the liquid form which is more potent in my oppinion.

I feel like I was in a constant drugged state for 4 months.  Once I was pronounced 'healed' I cut way down on the amount I took.  I take it for break through pain.  There are days I don't take any_ and days I take 3 -- usually I only take one.  I have chronic pain.

166, 5, dysmenorrea,Does make me feel warm_ drowsy_ and in a pleasant mood.  If taken after a break of several months_ will cause a heavy sensation all over the body and a strong relaxation.   Despite the drowsiness_ it also has a way of creating an underlying anxiety that is triggered by loud noises_ so it does tend to interrupt sleep somewhat_ or make me wake up every hour or two.  Sometimes it will make you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded_ but I have not noticed any problem with taking it on an empty stomach.  Actually it is perfect for those middle-of-the-night resurges in pain_ where you can take it with water and be pain-free again in about 25-30 minutes.  My dose is two of the 5/500 Hydro/APAP  (So a total of 10mgs Hydro and 1000 Acet) and this eliminates all the pain.  One pill is ineffective_ however_ so that may be an indication of pain strength_ for those trying to estimate.   I have also tried the 7.5/500_ but found that it had too many side effects and did not eliminate the pain.  Don't gi,This medication is an absolute godsend where OTC meds_ Rx Nsaids_ and lightweights like Tramadol have no effect at all on the pain. The pleasant side effects do make it tempting to abuse_ but I have had little trouble confining it to my painful days.  I take it on and off for about 4 days a month_ preferably at night due to the relaxation it causes.   Also it does seem to raise your core temp_ so if you have to work in a warm environment indoors_ it may cause sweating.  Overall_ this is my drug of choice for pain relief and I think it should be a standard Rx for anyone with a short term condition.  It works splendidly for painful periods_ has basically given me my life back_ and is worth every bit of the $4-$5  per pill that you will pay on the web.

185, 5, Headaches,occassional constipation,Started taking Lortab to control my headaches_ 1 or 2 a day (500s).  I now take the same amount to help relax me_ nothing on the planet works like Lortab.  I'm CEO of an Import/Export company and fuction very well during the day.  When I skip a couple of days_ the cravings are uncontrolable.  Lortab in moderation has been a Godsend for me.  It not only relaxes my mind but also my entire body.,M,48,4  years,4/10/2005,Lortab

188, 3, Migaines unresponsive to Imitrex,nausea,As a dentist I prescribe Lortab usually 7.5 for patients who simply need a stronger pain drug. Unfortunately many dentists use Darvocet or Darvon for post-op pain_ in my opinion propoxyphene is a worthless analgesic no better than aspirin. When I prescribe an opioid I generally use drugs that are indicated for treating moderate-severe pain_ such as Vicodin_ Percocet_ and Talacen (Talwin with APAP). Anyway I'm off the soapbox.  I use Imitrex for my Migraine HA's. Lortab or any other hydrocodone product (Vicodin_ Anexsia_ Lorcet_ etc.) is not a good option if you are nautious. Putting any med in the GI tract when it is already upset is simply not a good idea. If you need a rescue drug at home (I recommend it) there are other drugs that are delivered either rectally (Numorphan_ Dilaudid_ Morphine)_ or nasally (Stadol NS). If monitored properly they can be used safely at home without the worry of addiction. L. Sanderson_ DDS,M,30,2  times,2/22/2005,Lortab

The stomache and diarrea are the worst.  I crave the euphoric feeling I got from them_ but once they wear off_ it's a nightmare.  I wouldn't recommend this drug.

192, 1, pain after septoplasty,migraines,I found I could tolerate the pain from the surgery without medication.  It was the migraines that the Lortab triggered that were intolerable!

Pain relief was 5x more effective & was able to return to work & become a member of society again. Withdrawl was not as bad as expected or as bad as trying to live with the pain. Was some abdominal cramps but not being able to sleep at night was the worst_ a mild sedative for 5 days helped greatly.,M,49,2  years,11/30/2004Email,Lortab

Its by far the best anti-depressant ive ever had (ive had Zoloft_ Effexor_ etc) even though they dont prescribe it for that (they should). Pain management is generally pretty good_ it doesnt kill the really sharp pain like morphine_ but it does suprise you how many things that used to hurt_ simply dont anymore when taking it.,M,25,365  days,2/23/2004,Lortab
