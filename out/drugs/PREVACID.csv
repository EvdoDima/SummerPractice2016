6, 3, LERD,Diarrhea_ gas_ stomach pain_ increased urinary after dribble_ some pain after urination.,Guidelines about eating before and after taking the drug are very strict.  Even when taken correctly_ the diarrhea is awful_ enough to seek an alternative therapy and to take the drug less than prescribed.  Sudden increase in urinary after dribble was quite surprising. However_ Prevacid did help with acid damage to larynx and throat_ most discomfort eased within 1 week_ but it is a considerable tradeoff.

The prevacid did help my acid reflux and allowed my ulcers to heal. But after one year on it I began feeling weak and tired all the time.  By year 2 my muscles hurt constantly.  By year 3 I was having muscle spasms in my arms and legs also tingling in both. I was constantly constipated and bloated. I have been off prevacid for 5 days. So far my muscle pain is 60% better.

The best [art is the drug has backfired on me making my acid cells go bizerk. What I mean is because my acid cells have been off for so long my body is producing excess acid to make up with more acid cells. The worst part is I'm hooked on it and nobody is concerned about me being hooked on it. Same reaction for long term effects for this drug. Don't worry the drug companies don't want you to know that it's addictive and will make you worse. They got about $16 billion reasons to hide this.

It does not give me insomnia_ but I will take the insomnia Prilosec gives me over Prevacid's miserable side effects. I gave it almost 2 weeks to see if side effects would go away_ and they did not.

I never thought about it being the Prevacid!!!Recently_ I was diagnosed with severe vitamin D deficiency and was put on a Vit D treatment. My Endocrinologist told me to get off the Prevacid or cut back. I cut back to everyother day. Now I am wondering if on the days that I feel the worst_ are the days I take the Prevacid. I wonder and hope the side effects will reverse. Does anyone know if they will? I will be experimenting with other things to see if I get relief from my acid reflux but NO MORE PPIs for me.

Went to see a gastro specialist. Did a scope and was diagnosed with duodenal ulcer and chronic gastritis due to hyper-acidity in the stomach. Prescribed with Prevacid to control stomach acidity. It helped with the initial symptoms but it has severe side effects as mentioned earlier. Tried to wean it off but the initial symptoms came back. Since the side effects is too serious to be ignored am trying to wean it off again. If anyone can help especially with regard to the side effects_ please do not hesitate to email me.,M,30,28  days20MG 2X D,5/8/2012Email,Prevacid
59, 5, GERD,Started out taking Prilosec but began getting chest pains and cramps in left arm.   Switched to Prevacid and had no problems. Occasionally get bloated feeling in stomach.   Cramping pain (like a Charlie Horse) if I bend over for too long (like to tie a shoe).,After reading the concerns over long term use_ I weaned myself down to 15 mg. (occasionally supplement with Gaviscon if needed) after years on 30 mg. dose.  I can't seem to get off the stuff and my doctor keeps telling me that I shouldn't.   She says my concerns over bone problems aren't as important as the real possibility of esophageal or throat cancer that I could develop if I quit the PPI's.,F,65,13  years15 mg. 1X D,5/5/2012,Prevacid

62, 5, GERD,Fatigue_ gas pains.,Prevacid has worked really well for me. I hate taking meds but I was desperate. GERD has caused me severe pain and vomiting every time I experience it (at least once a week). Prevacid has relieved all of my symptoms and I can now live a normal life. A relative told me that taking apple cider vinegar with mother enzyme before every meal has cured her boyfriend's GERD so I am going to try that instead. I am scared of the long-term effects of using Prevacid (and every other med).,F,24,3  years30 MG 2X D,2/1/2012,Prevacid

Now 15+ years later- I can't absorb vit b-12 due to the PPi and I get shots monthly. I am now suffering from extreme exhaustion. I just had another blood test and I am waiting for the results. Please take Calcium - long term risk is increased fractures of the bones. I don't have a choice I have to be on this drug. We're looking for the reason for the exhaustion- before I found out about non absorption of Vit-B-12- I thought I had early onset Alzheimer it was that bad.I'm only 48 and I'm feeling the side effects-,Prevacid has probably saved my life but trying to find out about the long-term side effects isn't easy.,F,48,15  years30mg 2X D,12/17/2011Email,Prevacid

It helped with the GERD_ but the side effects were terrible. I was off GERD medication for several weeks with minimal problems. Last week my GERD starting acting up and I bought Prevacid (OTC).

I felt dizzy--like I was on the verge of passing out--when I had the diarrhea and Iwas not dehydrated and it was not a hot day. I thought maybe I had gotten food poisoning or contracted a stomach virus_ but it is likely this drug_ which I started taking yesterday_ as I rarely get sick and have been eating healthy food which I have prepared.,Have some really strong pain medication on hand before you try it_ in case you end up being one of the people who get severe cramps from this drug.,F,28,2  days30 mg 1X D,7/9/2011,Prevacid
74, 4, crohn's disease,Currently fighting pneumonia for the past month. Can not get rid of it; and i am on my third round of antibiotics_ steroids_ and inhaler not to mention several prescriptions for the cough that I have had for over a month. Unfortunately_ the downside for taking the Prevacid for a long while and often at a higer dose_ was that it killed off the good bacteria too. It is now hard for me to fight off infections. My doctor believes my current pneumonia (second bout in 18 months) is due to being on Prevacid and a weakened immune system - partially caused by the drug.,Prevacid actually has saved my life in many ways. I had a blood clot in my thirties and had to be put on blood thinners which is a wicked twist of fate when you have Crohns Disease and bleed intestinally all the time. I took the Prevacid to ward off any stomach bleeding. I am no stranger to blood transfusion.,F,48,8  years 3X D,6/17/2011Email,Prevacid

77, 5, GERD,This drug has helped me immensley.  I won't say side effects as none_ but I can't say this medicine caused them.  Started taking 30mg ten years ago and after a few months began having mild chest pain at times only.  Dr. recommended stop taking after about 6 years.  Then I began taking over the counter Prilosec.  Then went back to Prevacid 15 mg after it became available.  I still may have occasional chest pain_ rapid pulse_ slight arythmia_ but I don't know if Prevacid causes it.  At least I can swallow my food_ knifing stomach pain is gone_ and no acid coming up.,My concern for checking this website for reactions is that I read these ppi may inhibit the effectiveness of blood thinners.  I only take 3 pills per week and trying to wean off them.  Hopefully medical research will enlighten us as to the long term negative effects.  It seems we take one pill to cure the effects of another....,F,59,4  months15 1X D,6/2/2011Email,Prevacid

I already suffer from migraines and fibromayalgia so the headaches and muscle spasms people are referring to already effect me.  After taking it for 1 month_ I went off it (had to wait for insurance to cover the refill).  I immediately had the reflux again.  The day I went back on it_ no more reflux.

It's been 48 hours since my last dosage_ and I still have all the other symptoms except the fatigue is beginning to lift.  Doctor said no way my back pain was caused by prevacid_ but then later conceded it could be a side effect I alone may have suffered based on my chemistry.

83, 4, GERD,When taking 30 MG per day_ I experienced symptoms commonly associated with enlarged prostate_ such as frequent urination. When I cut down to 30 MG every other day that went away. I am currently experiencing excessive fatigue. I just started playing ice hockey again_ after 26 years away from the game_ but am feeling fatigue that has now lasted for an entire week. That's more than just getting old. I think the Prevacid has something to do with it_ so I'm getting off it for a couple weeks to see if I feel better. I can't play hockey the way I currently feel. Ugh!,Prevacid is a miracle drug in many ways. It has pretty much eliminated my stomach and esophagus pain_ even when drinking coffee and eating pizza. No pain is awesome_ but my office job is slowly killing me_ allowing me to gain weight_ etc. I have decided to get back into shape by taking up the sport of ice hockey again. Hockey requires and incredible amount of strength and endurance_ and I believe the Prevacid is holding me back_ due to Prevacid fatigue. I'm quitting the Prevacid in an effort to see if my muscles feel stronger without it. I guess Friday night pizza night is going to have to change to something less heartburn inducing_ but getting into better overall physical shape should be worth it.,M,50,3.5  years30 MG 4X W,4/17/2011,Prevacid

His pediatrician put him on prevacid and now he is suffering from severe headache_ vision changes_ dizziness_ and cannot function. He hasn't been to school in a week. We've been back to the doctor twice and specifically asked if these could be side effects from the prevacid and she acted like I was a moron. ""No no we give prevacid all the time."" Took him to the eye doctor. Two days ago I called the doctor back and said you HAVE to give him something for this headache. They told me to take him to the ER which I did. After describing his symptoms they immediately did an MRI.  Negative (thankfully). I just found this web site and after reading through here and about the many many people who got severe headache from this drug I told him do not take your pill this morning. I now strongly believe that it is totally the prevacid that is causing these headaches an pray that he feels better very very soon (like today would be great.) I've been with the same pediatrician for 24 years but I will be changing doctors now.

The lack of stomach acid is the issue not too much stomach acid. The doctors will tell you that it is all in your head but folks listen to your bodies. What you are experiencing is real. I believe later on in life there will be many people with cancer because of this drug. I wouldn't give this drug to my dog. Why did I keep taking it. Well I was diganosed with a small segment of BE of which they later reversed. Nevertheless I was scared because of the possiblities of it turning into cancer. For about a year I have had aweful side effects from this drug. Stomach pain was horrific. I kept taking it because I thought that it was my GERD. I was to scared to stop taking it because the massive rebound effect. Well the pain became so severe that I just quit taking it. Well the pain went away. Now I will have to suffer from the acid for about 6 weeks. The doctors made me feel stupid when I mentioned this to them. They said that this drug wouldn't cause these pains. Well they are wrong.

The stomach cramps that accompanied the diarrhea were horrible to say the least. I went to a new GI and she told me to up the dose to 60mg per day since my GERD was not resolved with 30mg. Besides the diarrhea_ I felt nausea either way. Now I feel like this drug may have caused Colitis. I have mucus in my loose stool as well as tinged with blood. My intestines are inflamed and sore and not very happy--to say the least. I now need a colonoscopy. I stopped the Prevacid today and am very cautious and afraid the reflux symptoms will come back with a vengeance_ but I will call this new doctor on Monday (today is Saturday) and ask for Aciphex in the interim until I figure what natural course to take.

Once I reduced the dosage to 30 mgs once per day_ it got a little better_ but still have the stomach upset which is just driving me nuts.,I think it helps some_ but I think I am going to have to find something else that is not as tough on my stomach.

I took Prevacid every morning as directed_ by the end of every day my head hurt so bad. I had a hard time keeping focused on anything_ concentration was waaaaaaaaaay off.

I've spent the past week lying on my couch_ sick as a dog_ and I finally went online this afternoon to see if Prevacid interacted with anything else I'm taking. It turns out that Prevacid is metabolized by the same liver enzyme as Luvox (fluvoxamine)_ an antidepressant I've been taking since I was 10 for obsessive-compulsive disorder. I didn't see any warning about this on the box (although I may have not looked carefully enough) and apparently even small amounts of Luvox increase the amount of Prevacid in your bloodstream by an insane amount. I wish I had looked up any potential interactions before taking Prevacid_ but I'm still surprised by this because it seems like a pretty extreme interaction for such a common over the counter drug!,F,24,6  days30mg 1X D,10/19/2010,Prevacid

I stopped taking Prevacid and the next day_ MUCH less rumbling and no sensitive teeth just in 24 hours!  I am going back to Prilosec OTC and staying on the gerd diet.,I really think this is a over hyped drug and the side effects are more problematic than the gerd type symptoms.,F,44,2  days30-60 2X D,10/8/2010,Prevacid

Almost immediately after taking the first dose there was an increase of indigestion & reflux pain. I noticed my heart rate increasing & attributed it to my anxiety. After taking Librax (which is used for my anxiety) the increase in heart rate did not wane. The nausea comes and goes in the form of waves_ almost as if the medication is confusing your body into believing you're hungry & if you don't immediately eat_ you'll feel sick. Frankly_ to me_ this medication makes no sense & after reading the reviews before mine_ I can safely say this drug does not help people with moderate to severe digestive disorders. It did not help me & I do not believe I will ever take it again.,F,25,2  days 1X D,8/27/2010,Prevacid

After every meal I immediately had diarhea...it was difficult to make it to the bathroom in time. Then_ came the sever stomach pains for the past 3 days...thought I had the flu.  Was going to make an appointment to see the doctor when I decided to check the side effects on prevacid online...so glad I did.  Luckily_ I stopped taking the medication as soon as I felt like I had the flu.  Bowel movements are already improving.  It is so sad to hear of everyones stories.  I hate it that these companies market products that can cause people such pain/suffering/health problems.  The doctor had me originally taking 30mg...gave me headaches and difficulty sleeping.  I then switched to OTC 15mg Prevacid.  If I feel this bad on 15mg...I cannot imagine how bad I would have felt taking 30mg.  I've been using herbs/natural products for years_ and I should have known better.  Going back to the natural remedies.

My symptoms got better after 2 days. A similar reaction happened to me a year ago when taking prilosec otc. Had to stop taking that after 6 weeks. I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone_ because the long term side effects far outweigh the problem you are trying to trerat. I LOOKED INTO A NATURAL REMEDY FOR THE GERD_ HEARTBURN AND SPASTIC ESOPHOGUS. I FOUND A PRODUCT CALLED DGL (DEGLYCYRRHIZINATED LICORICE). IT IS 100% NATURAL AND 100% SAFE. DGL IS LICORICE ROOT EXTRACT THAT HAS A COUPLE OF COMPOUNDS REMOVED FROM IT WHICH CAN RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE. I BOUGHT DGL FOR LESS THAN $10 PER 100 CHEWABLES. YOU CHEW 1 TABLET 20 MINUTES PRIOR TO EATING ANY MEAL. THE DGL COATS AND PROTECTS THE STOMACH LINING AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REPAIR PROBLEMATIC CONDITIONS IN THE STOMACH INCLUDING SOME ULCERS. AFTER USING DGL FOR ONLY 1 DAY I BEGAN TO FEEL BETTER. I HAVE BEEN TAKING IT FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS NOW AND FEEL 100% BETTER. I URGE ANYONE ON PRESCRIPTION OR NON-PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO GIVE DGL A TRY.

The diarea would never stop with the medications. It kept comming back. I ask the doc if the Prevacid may have anything to do with it and he said no. He kept wanting to try new drugs and I said no not until I try diet first. Now I read all the side effects of gas_ foul smelling_ extreme diarea_ etc. so I have stopped taking the Prevacid for 5 days and extreme gas and diarea is getting better.

129, 1, Acid Reflux,Gas pains_ upset stomach_ unable to sleep.,My 3 year old was prescribed prevacid when she was a month old for acid reflux.  She would not nap all day long_ thought it was just her personality. THis went on until she was about 4 months old.  I kept her on Prevacid until she was a year old then switched to Zantac.  Never knowing that it was causing her any side effects!  (Babies can't talk). I just had another baby and she too has acid reflux_ spits up alot and fussy but she still napped about 5-7 hours a day.  At 5 weeks the doctor put her on Prevacid and within two days of taking it she was not napping_ acting very fussy just like her older sister did 3 years ago.  I took her off the prevacid and within one day was back to her normal napping routine. I called the doctor and asked if this could be related to the prevacid and they told me to UP the dosage!  There was no way I am was going to continue giving it to her.  I have to trust my instincts.  I think Prevacid causes alot of stomach pain and constipation in infants.

130, 3, GERD/ Heartburn,Foggy feeling. Upper abdominal pains. Shortness of breath. Heart palpitations. Fullness feeling in abdomen.,I've taken Prevacid in the past to get acid reflux under control. That was about 14 years ago and i only took it for 1 month. It cleared up the reflux great. I was not told to take it for long periods of time_ so i hadn't taken it again for almost 13 years. Last year my acid reflux began to get worse than ever_ along with consistant heartburn ( which i have had for the past 20 years). My doctor put me on prilosec otc last year_ which gave me extreme stomach cramps and abdominal pain after being on it for about 2 months. That was the last time i took anything but Tums in the last 10 months. Again recently i began having problems with the GERD and heartburn where it took me back into the Dr's office and i ws put on O.T.C. Prevacid 24 hr. 1 in the morning and 1 before bed for a permanent duration. My Heartburn and GERD completely went away after about  a week. I have ben on Prevacid for almost 10 weeks now. After the 9th week i started to notice many adverse reactions to the drug_ which after reading this message forum will now stop taking this drug. The bad side effects far outweigh the benefits to this drug. I will be seeing my NEW Doctor early next week to get some different insight to other options.

My IBS is a little better but getting my anxiety under control is going to help that more.

I can tell no difference in the two.  The only symptom I get with Prilosec is the occasional bout of extremelly smelly gas (LOL) which I then stop taking for a few days to clear up.  No stomach discomfort_ no GERD_ no nausia etc.  Recently I decided (for some reason) to switch to Prevacid OTC as it came on the market.  It's only today_ after deciding to look up symptoms do I find this page full of other people that have made the same realization.  After two weeks of taking it my upper GI track would become very bloated - something I had not experienced before.  It would take several hours to move into the lower stomach/bowels and be passed as gas.  Truly awful.  This then led to nausia_ loose stools (not quite diarrea) and general constant ""sour"" stomach.

If you're on a PPI and having headaches switch to Aciphex. It's been a lifesaver for me! All of the others also caused diarrhea while Aciphex didn't. Just know that when your doctor decides you can quit taking a PPI you must wean yourself off slowly and drop down the dosage or you'll experience a rebound effect where you'll actually produce MORE acid than when you started on the meds. These meds aren't meant for long term as you need acid to digest your food. Put the wheels of you bedframe up on 6"" blocks and don't eat 3 hrs before bedtime_ take the PPI's for a few months and you should be good!",,F,50,90  days15mg 1X D,4/14/2010,Prevacid

I could not even turn over in the bed because of the pain. My othopedic physician could not find anything wrong with me and suggested physical therapy. I was coming home from work sleeping most of the evening. My days off consisted of the same because I had so little energy. Then I started having severe diarrhea for over two weeks. I performed a culture and found that I had very little normal flora left in my intestional tract. Since Prevacid was the only medicine I was taking_ I stopped it and my diarrhea stopped the next day. I have been off of it for a week now and feel like a new person. I do not come home from work and hit the sofa and sleep anymore. I no longer have any pain in my back and hip_ and have not had any trouble with diarrhea. This medicine helped my GERD but would not take it again because of the side effects that I experienced.

165, 4, GERD,None that I know of.,Was on it at 30mg/day until insurance stopped covering it four years ago.  I never had a problem with it and it was effective.  One thing you have to consider about sites like this is that people are far_ far more likely to report bad experiences than they are good experiences_ and you never know whic bad experiences can be contributed to a drug and which cannot.  Learn to read the clinical trials.  They're placebo controlled and peer reviewed.  There aren't people with multiple health problems making guesses about what's causing what.  No offense to anyone on here but I trust data more than anecdote. With that said_ I had a good experience with Prevacid and started going downhill when I was forced to go to Prilosec OTC.  I just now took the first dose of OTC Prevacid.  I don't really have any concern about side effects...my worries are more efficacy related as I will be taking half the dose I used to.  Anyway I don't mean to say that people here are full of it or anything.  There are always rare side effects to any drug and some can be bothersome or worse.  What I'm saying is the average patient lacks the knowledge to diagnose themselves_ and also that bad experiences are more likely to be reported.  When people are feeling bad it's natural to point fingers and I don't particularly blame them_ but when other people come along and read it these accounts should be taken with a grain of salt.,M,33, 30mg_ 15mg 1X D,2/5/2010,Prevacid

167, 1, GE,GERD,I had been taking Prilosec for 6 years before I decided to give Prevacid a try. I had coupons and it made sense at the time to use them. Unfortunately_ I did not visit this site before I took them. Immediately. I felt a change in my body and mood. I was lying on the couch most of the day_ getting up only to go to bed. Since I am dealing with the recent death of my mother_ I thought that it must be normal. Then the gastrointestinal stuff kicked in. All of a sudden_ I was ravenous so I thought that the sheer amounts of food I was consuming must be causing that. Almost overnight_ I couldn't wear my jeans and my stomach was constantly making animal noises. I could not eat anthing without getting severe diahrrea. The daily and nightly gas pains were crippling. I seriously did not want to go out because I could not control the gas and it was the type that would clear out the whole building. Last night I decided to look for side effects on Prevacid and EUREKA!! It was all there in black and white. I still had a week's worth of pills left but I dropped them into the garbage can and went out to buy some Prilosec. I never had a problem with Prilosec so I feel stupid for taking the chance with Prevacid. I will never take them again and hope that my symptoms go away quickly so I can go grocery shopping!

I went to research the Prevacid and found this site. All his symptoms sound like what others here had complained of_ but the post about a blood drawn allergy test caught my attention also. We went back to the doctor and discussed if he was having side affects (which she didn't believe he was_ of course)_ but I also requested a blood drawn 'allergy' test. I was told the only food they could do a blood test for was for gluten (wheat_ rye_ barley). Turns out I didn't quite know what I was asking for_ but the doctor ordered the right one_ its not technically an 'allergy' test_ she also ordered other tests to rule out problems with liver_ thyroid_ pancrease_ etc. Turns out my son has Celiac disease_ verfied by a blood test and a later by a biopsy of his small intestine. After being on a strict gluten free diet for 30 days he stopped taking the prevacid. The heartburn didn't return. After 6 weeks of being gluten free_ his stomach pain was completely gone_ along with the other symptoms.

He recommends 2-4 week treatments on a need-be basis and srict diet changes.  I think the most remarkable thing I noted was eliminating wheat products and corn sweeteners.  My worse symptoms have been chest pain and lung congestion.  It starts as a false full body cold that then ""settles"" in the lungs.  It lasts for weeks and gets better but never goes away.  Not one doctor I have seen has ever asked about or suggested a problem with a PPI.  In fact_ they say I need to take it continuously.  It is hard to heal with just good habits.  I am underweight_ eat organic_ exercise.  But when it gets really bad_ I go on PPI for a few weeks.  It is great when I can go off and the side effects turn off like a light switch has been flipped.",Prevacid is a serious drug and I do not understand while_ if the studies are just for short-term use_ millions are staying on this drug indefinitely.

Someone tell the medical association that intestinal flora is necessary please_ k thx.  There is no test for this (in USA) which is why they aren't finding anything wrong.,There is no rating low enough for this garbage.    I am normally very healthy besides the heart burn I had for the last couple of years.  I should have just fixed my diet_ but instead opted to take the easy way out and pop some pills.  Been to the ER like 5 times now in the last 6 weeks and a few doctors.  Had every test under the Sun from food allergies to spinal taps.  They all want to prescribe me anxiety pills and send me on my way despite all my physical symptoms as well.  Damn the medical industry.  Just cashin in by handing out the 'flavor of the month' pill decided by whichever drug company is paying.    If you do some research you will find that this stuff kills off the flora in your intestines so you can no longer digest food properly.  I suspect the great majority of people are having these symptoms due to mal-absorption since they no longer have the critical flora needed for normal digestion.  All I can say is STOP TAKING THIS CRAP and nurse your stomach back to health with fruits & veggies & maybe some probiotics.

210, 1, Stomach protection from Lupus meds.,I have used Prevacid for 10-plus years on doctor's advice to protect my stomach from vital_ but very harsh_ Lupus_ S.E._ meds. I became concerned over a published June '09 medical report concluding that long-term use of this drug_ and others in its classification_ cause dependency. I stopped the drug as a result but began sufferring almost immediate and terrible side-effects_ that I now believe are severe withdrawal symptoms. Therefore_ I believe you MUST taper off gradually if you've used Prevacid for a long time_ just like you would any other medication that causes dependency. I repeat: Be very careful coming off the drug_ and consider doing so under a doctor's care.,After reading the comments here_ I now believe that it's very possible that a lot of the symptoms that I have attributed to my severe Lupus over the years may_ in fact_ have been directly caused_ or certainly greatly worsened_ by the long-term use of Prevacid. I am STUNNED. I had never_ ever_ associated this drug with ANY of my underlying symptoms before_ and am still trying to wrap my mind around this terrifying_ but sadly obvious conclusion! My symptoms have all been strangely progressive_ becoming much worse over the years than most Lupus patients whom my doctor treats. My symptoms include horrible joint pain_ edema_ stomach cramping_ joint stiffness_ problems walking_ dizziness_ fainting_ headaches_ insomnia_ very deep depression_ problems swallowing_ constipation_ overall severe dryness of hair and skin_ eye pain and increased eye pressure_ and sudden_ unexplained but consistent blood pressure elevation. Horrible_ horrible_ horrible@! Even though everything I've just shared_ as well as all of the comments at this website_ are based solely on personal experiences_ I believe them compelling and point to one inescapable conclusion: Anyone reading this should refrain from EVER using Prevacid_ or any drug from its classification. I also strongly believe that anyone currently using this medication should stop NOW_ tapering gradually if they've taken it over a long period of time. DO NOT become a victim of this medication.,F,53,10  years,7/5/2009Email,Prevacid

Your posts do make a difference.  My son was diagnosed with lactose intollerance and had to take Lactaid.  He also went through Endoscopy and it was discovered that his stomach was raw and was extremely irritated.  Prior to mealtime he would cry when he saw food as the pain would start as soon as he salivated.  They tried several things and he was told that his bowls were compacted when they were NOT (NOVA Hosp.)  He did a bown flush and vomited_ I stopped the flush and they insisted that I start it all over again.  He ended up in the hospital.  Scans showed there was nothing in his bowls but GAS.  Yes_ the flush is carbinated and lactose intollerance makes you gassy.  The pain was excruciating!  My instink was to get him gasX as we had to leave the ER when they said that they did not know what to do for him_ but to return to the gasteroenterologist that got us into this mess in the first place.  -----------I read the post that recommended: Sherry A. Rogers MD writes a book on this called ""No More Heartburn Stop the pain in 30 Days Naturally"" .  It worked within a couple weeks.  My son no longer takes any medication_ including Lactaid.  I think that when he was on an antibiotic (Zithromax - VERY BAD FOR STOMACH)for an ear infection it killed all the benifical bacteria.

Malabsorption of nutrients - I can tell my body is not getting nutrients from the food I'm eating!,"Wow_ this medicine (along with Prilosec) have totally messed up my digestion. I first took Prilosec OTC for about 6 weeks_ then switched to Prevacid (which I have taken before with no side effects) for 1 month. Thankfully I found this website - I've been going crazy trying to figure out what was wrong. Someone on this site recommended the book ""Gut Reactions"" by Raphael Kellman...it is a MUST READ for anyone with stomach issues. The book explains how pharmaceuticals & antacids ruin the ecosystem of your GI tract (and cause other major health issues) and it provides natural ways to restore your health. I've been off Prevacid for 2 weeks now and I'm still not back to normal_ although my diarrhea has stopped. I am taking a probiotics supplement to restore the good bacteria and a digestive enzyme supplement before meals to help digestion.

249, 1, GERD,I took Prevacid for several months in 2007.  I started having heart palpatations and angina.  3 trips to Emergency room a colonoscopy_ stress tests and EKG's.  I was going NUTS.  Started having to take Ativan before bed just to sleep.  It did help my stomach though.  In 2008 my insurance company preferred that I take Protonix.  Within a week my heart palpatations stopped_ angina went away.  At the beginning of this year insurance stopped paying for Protonix.  Back to Prevacid and I am completely miserable.  Finally just today my doctor put me on Nexiam and my insurance approved it.  I have taken Nexium in the past with no problems.  I wish the insurance companies would allow us to take what works best for us.  Listen up Insurance Company Execs.  PREVACID SUCKS and patients need choices.  When patients use what works they spend less time at the doctors office and hospital.,More studies need to be done.  This medication may work for some but it has been a nightmare for me.

I suddendly noticed that when I quit taking the Prevacid my Migraines immediately stopped. I had been having 1-2 migraines a week and after stopping Prevacid I only had 1 in 9 months. Hmmm...I thought there HAD to be a connection. I don't drink hardly any alcohol_ but around the holidays I had some then one night I had 1 glass of wine and 3 small glasses of Port. A week later I was coughing up bile. When I called my doctor she asked if I had any Prevacid left and put me back on it immediately. This is the 3rd day I've taken the Prevacid and I've had a horrible migraine all day. I ended up needing to take medication for the migraine that tears up my stomach...kind of defeats the purpose of taking the Prevacid_ doesn't it?

Began 12/8 and was violently ill on 12/17 during a vacation to New York City_ which I initially blamed on food poisoning.

257, 1, Taking Prevacid for Acid Reflux,I took Prevacid solutab for about 5 weeks starting April 2007. I developed muscle twitching_ IBS_ skin rash_ heart palpitations and muscle weakness. I have been to many doctors searching for clues as to what is the cause. I had nuclear stress test_ ekg_ EMG_ MRI of the brain_ upper GI 2 times_ and colonoscopy 2 times. All they could say was to take a tranquilizer your IBS is caused by stress. I kept telling them it was the other way around. The physical problems are causing the stress.,"I found the answer to my disease that was caused by Prevacid after a long 1.5 years of suffering and close to loosing my job. I went to a doctor outside of the insurance network and paid dearly to have some tests run. I had a CDSA stool test run and a IgG Food Antibody test run. I was diagnosed with Klebsiella and Citrobacter dysbiotic flora in my intestines. This was caused by a dysbiosis when I took the Prevacid. I also have severe food and chemical allergies now due to the infected gut. The condition is called Leaky Gut Syndome or Hyperpermeable gut. Sherry A. Rogers MD writes a book on this called ""No More Heartburn Stop the pain in 30 Days Naturally""I urge anyone who has problems with the proton pump drugs to have a CDSA stool test.

Sore hips.  Sinus & eye pressure_ stuffiness & really sore inside nasal passages.  All these side effects disappeared after I stopped taking the Prevacid.

And I am reluctant to take it because of the stomach polyps that cover 80% of my stomach. I am having surgery in January to fix the hernia and also having Fundoplication surgery to prevent anymore acid reflux.

276, 5, GERD and Barret's syndrome,a little constipation,I love this drug_ only worried about long term effects. Before taking it_ I was miserable_ coughing all the time. Learned to raise my bed_ sleep on left side (on the right side_ the stomach is above the esophagus and gravity makes food go into esophagus)_ digest before bed (eat early) and avoid too much of anything bad_ like alcohol_ spicy and fatty foods. EATING SLOWLY WITH NO RUSH is most important. We are always in a rush mentally and that affects acid production and digestion. Small meals also a plus. Give your digestive system a break_ treat it right_ and along with this pill_ symptoms will subside. Chew food well and eat SLOWLY and CONSCIENTIOUSLY. RELAX. Make yourself breathe in a few times and it relaxes you. For the constipation I eat more fiber_ drink more water_ avoid too much cheese and bread and have Metamucil a few times a week. The drug alone won't work unless you change your eating habits. Bought GERD for Dummies and learned a lot.,F,50,18  months,9/14/2008,Prevacid

None of these tests showed any reason for HAIR LOSS.  I visited a Naturopath MD and he recommended I stop using Previcid.  I did.

I suspected it to be a side effect and stopped taking prevacid and within 3 days my evening temps were back to normal.,,M,40,12  days,7/29/2008,Prevacid
286, 4, Stomach pain/Ulcer,EXTREMELY hungry_ belching when switched to dissolving tablet,This drug was a godsend.  After nexium nearly killed me with its side effects_ I was given prevacid and felt better as soon as I took the first dose.  The major downside was having to wait 30 minutes after the dose to eat because the drug made me extremely hungry_ sometimes to the point of hunger pangs.Very expensive_ but completely worth it.,F,24,3  months,7/25/2008,Prevacid
287, 1, Irritated stomach_ intestines,Migraine headache_ nausea_ dizziness,I felt fine this AM until I took a 30Mg dose of Prevacid.  Within an hour I had a debillitating migraine headache.  It started on the left side of my temple (it's still there 9 hours later)_ and went down the left side of my neck.  I have felt nauseous since then; haven't wanted to eat a bite.  I have spent almost my entire day in bed feeling like I'm about to throw up.  Often when I closed my eyes_ I felt like my bed was spinning.  My lower back hurts.

288, 2, GERD,SVT_ PVC_ PAC_ A-fib_ chest pain_ belching_ intestinal discomfort_ dizzyness_ tingling in neck and face_ lower intestinal gas_ sudden sweating hands_ feet_ and head_ elevated blood pressure.,10+ years ago I developed GERD while doing speed skating and taking Ibuprofen while exercising...(DON'T do it_ no matter what the commercials say!)  It took four trips to the emergency room over a period of a year with weird chest pains before somebody suggested I might have GERD.  By then I had a large esophageal ulcer and some Barrett's.  I was put on Prevacid with a one-time 6-month stint of Protonix in its place.  I no longer have any Barrett's.  I still have reflux.Since going on Prevacid_ I've had about every heart attack symptom you can have.  I've made ~10 trips to the emergency room over the years because of them...with never any heart problem found.  I've had two SVT episodes that lasted 2-3 hours. I have always passed my cardiac stress tests with flying colors...in fact my cardiologist told me that my heart is in better condition that 99% of America.Finally_ this week my cardiologist says that he has been reading that acid blockers can cause B-12_ calcium_ iron_,M,60,10  years,7/17/2008Email,Prevacid

291, 4, GERD - Years of horror.,Prevacid was great for the first 8 years or so.  It was the only pill that held me 24 hours.  When I tried Nexium or Prilosec_ I began having heartburn and hurting so could always tell when I had forgotten to take it.  However_ recently my constant diarrhea of one year was diagnosed - microscopic colitis.  Not sure of one of the causes but one may be medication and I suspect Prevacid is It.  Doc tried other meds but nothing controlled diarrhea until he told me to stop Prevacid.  Now I'm still dealing with the colitis issues but diarrhead has stopped or at least_ slowed down.  Be alert and aware of your body!,,F,72,8  years,7/9/2008,Prevacid
292, 5, GERD/Acid Reflux,NONE that I'm aware of. I recently developed carpal tunnel_ but I doubt Prevacid caused it.,Prevacid works better than any other prescription medication I've taken for GERD_ and it lasts 24 hours. My acid reflux was horrible prior to Prevacid. My reflux would wake me up at night and I'd feel nauseaous or sick with stomach pain throughout the day. I could hardly eat. Prevacid changed my life! I'm extremely pleased with it!!,F,45,3  years,6/12/2008,Prevacid

I didn't know what was causing it...i thought I was allergic to spring which i never had but after reading other peoples comments it could be this drug. I took a log of everything I was eating and I wasnt able to figure out the problem and I even rubbed polled on my skin to see if i got irrated lol.

This is an expensive drug (3 mo. supply in US_$536!!)--so expensive I've had to purchase it from another country to afford it (3 mo. supply for $90_ outside US).,I could not live without this medicine.  I had heartburn so bad I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like my esophogus was being twisted.  I also have chronic sinusitis (before and after taking prevacid)_ and when researching it I found that yes_ that an over active nose could be a side effect of prevacid_ but it ALSO can be side effect of GERD.  According to my doctors the constant drainage is my body's way of lining my esophogus to protect it from the damage of the acid reflux.  For me_ this makes total sense_ because it wasn't until after I started to treat my constant_ runny nose that the GERD symptoms reared it's ugly head.,,39,8  years,4/16/2008,Prevacid
302, 1, GERD/acid reflux,Some relief from acid reflux symptoms_ but had diarrhea almost on a daily basis_ daily stomach pain which kept me feeling like I needed to eat all the time_ and worst of all--decreased bone density (discovered later_ due to incomplete absorption of minerals)_ condition known as osteopenia (precursor to osteoporosis).,Am now 61_ but started this drug around age 52. Had suffered with GERD for at least 20 years_ but symptoms got worse with age and increasing weight. Went off Nexium_ then to Prevacid_ and later to Prilosec_ hoping to get fewer side effects_ but not successful at this at all. All together_ was on proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs for about 7 years. Gallbladder removed at age 44. Diagnosed with rare-type pancreas tumor in 2005 and had surgery in Dec. 2005. Went off all PPI drugs in early 2006. Real reasons for GERD: eating too much sugar and wheat (and other gluten grains) for many years_ and not enough bile acids for proper digestion. MY CURE: taking bile acid salts and full-strength pancreatic enzymes supplements with every meal. Drastically changed my diet to high-fat_ moderate-protein_ low-carb (NO wheat or other gluten grains) with absolutely no processed food; added raw dairy and grassfed_ pastured_ locally-grown beef_ poultry_ pork_ organic produce.

I had_ what I believe_ no symptoms at first.  Was only glad that the pain went away.  But for the past few years now_ I have been experiencing these symptoms and thought it was my thyroid.  Many tests later and my thyroid shows normal.  Was diagnosed with mild asthma last year as well. This year I was diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency. My doctor_ and I_ never connected all the symptoms together thinking that one thing may be causing all of them.  Then_ the past 3 weeks my asthma was out of control.  My fatigue was extreme_ I wasn't sleeping and I was getting depressed.  I tried to think of what had changed in the last 5 yrs and taking Prevacid was the only thing that had changed.  Stopped taking it 3 days ago and am feeling MUCH better. Though the acid reflux is back_ it is better than all the others symptoms combined.

We went to a specialist_ etc.  He's been on it since last August (2007) and it is now April 2008.  The specialist said not to be on it too long because it could adversely affect his bones.  They wanted him off of it within three months_ but I said no_ I'll wait until spring.  I'm now taking him off of it_ but it has worked great.  He rarely throws up any food_ feels good_ and sleeps through the night without vomitting.  I'm afraid to take him off of it_ but I'm afraid to keep him on it.  I'll see what happens.

After I stopped the side effect ceased. Prevacid helps Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease but the side effects are equally intensive. My Doctor said that the medication causes a loss of Iron in your system thus irratating the Pyloric canal.

339, 5, GERD_ LG. HIATAL HERNIA,NONE!!!! I'm amazed at negative comments_ but assume it may be because the ones who believe the problems they've had are side effects are more likely to comment. I've used this site often and finally decided I should add comments when I find a drug that's terrific! I've had some terrible drugs for other things_ but Prevacid has been FANTASTIC!!!!!!!! I'd strongly recommend it. For those worried about side effects_ simply read the handout the pharmacy gives you_ go on-line before seeing your Dr._ and don't pay for the drug until you feel OK with taking it. Always ask your Dr. and pharmacist about side effects. I've done that several times. If don't like what you read- go back to Dr. with the printout and have Dr. clarify info for you. There are many other drugs_ but this one has worked the best!,I have severe acid reflux which Dr. said can't be totally stopped until I have surgery_ 3+ inch hiatal hernia_ and heartburn once in awhile. I've had an endoscopy and my esophagus is a mess. Dr. said I could eat anything but really hot peppers and it wouldn't cause any more damage. I'm planning on having surgery in the Spring for my hiatal hernia and Dr. thinks I'll have significant improvement since my hernia is so large. I was constantly having reflux after something as simple as a drink of water_ waking with severe coughing_ severe burning in throat_ hoarse voice_ noises when I sleep sounding like something is blocking breathing_etc. I still have those symptoms but not as often as I did without Prevacid. I have to wait to recover from neurostimulator implant on 1/7 (for a more severe problem) to have surgery for reflux/hiatal hernia.

346, 2, After a diagnosis of gerd,I guess I'm a slow learner. During 10 years of taking prevacid I've gone to E.R. six times with symptoms including_ in addition to chest pain_ fatigue_ headache_ racing heart and internal shakes_ aches in shoulders and numbness in feet and hands. Each time_ the outcome has been no heart problems found and and no real diagnosis - perhaps esophageal spasm_ perhaps GERD. GI specialist said gerd and this is why I was taking prevacid in the first place although it worked minimally or not at all. Perhaps it did because I have had symptom-free (except for the headache which was almost always there) periods between bouts. Recently have had two episodes of above symptoms but much more severe. The latest one has lasted for 3-4 weeks and included frequent loose bowel movements_ lower abdominal dustress_ mild nausea_ severe headache and difficulty focussing_ as well as the other symptoms described above. I felt like I was being pousoned. I finally stopped the Prevacid and was mostly symptom free b,Don't take it longterm and don't take a high dose. Some of your gi symptoms may be caused_ rather than cured_ by the drug.

348, 2, Part of treatment for H.Pylori,I experienced the following side effects_ many of which started about the 10th day of taking Prevacid:Extreme dry mouth_ agitation/anxiety/moodiness_ sleeplessness_ occasional-to-frequent stomach spasm with accompanying heartbeat skip_ frequent urge to urinate_ medium-to-severe flu symptoms_ frequent daytime cold sweats and chills_ occasional tingling & numbness sensations in arms & back_ severe waves of nightime sweats (while trying to fall off to sleep)_ occasional waves of nausea.,Beyond dry mouth_ I experienced no problems taking 30 mg of Prevacid 30 twice daily for the first week of therapy (Hp PAC) to eradicate my H. Pylori infection.  After that 1 week of eradication therapy (which included a twice daily dosing of Prevacid as well as the antibiotics Biaxin & Amoxicillin)_ I began taking 30 mg of Prevacid (only) once a day_ as directed by my doctor.  Within a few days of ceasing the antibiotics and taking Prevacid only_ I began experiencing all of the terrible symptoms I have described.  I believe I had what amounts to an allergic reaction to Prevacid_ which evidently is not all that uncommon from what I have read in these ratings.  I continued (still continuing) acid-reduction therapy for my stomach_ however I'm now taking Zantac 150 mg twice daily_ which calms my stomach extremely well and does not give me any side effects whatsoever.

When discussing symptoms with my GI physician was told that most are either 'psychosymatic' or caused by another agent.  After I decided to stop taking this drug (after reading similar comments on this board)_ I think he was wrong indeed.  Seems much more in-depth long term studies are needed on the long-term pharmacological effects of this medication.,Stopped taking drug 2 weeks ago and most if not all symptoms have completely disappeared.

But boy did Prevacid sure did relieve the reflux_ within 24 hours.  All the side effects began within 24 hours of my first dose (30 mg once daily).  Minor side effects in addition include gas.

I would be fine one second_ eat something_ and then be running to the bathroom so sure I was about to vomit because I could feel the food coming back up in my throat.  The attacks would be random and without logic (ate pizza one day and was fine_ but oatmeal and applesauce made me ill).

Buy the book called 'NO MORE HEARTBURN Stop the Pain in 30 Days-Naturally' by Dr. Sherry A. Rogers.  That book solved my problem.I discovered that my problem was from Candida.  Candida feeds off of sugar.  I started a low carb diet that involved no fruit until I was symptom free for 3 weeks.  I did supplement with several items and had my ignorant doctor put me on Nystatin to kill off the Candida in my gut.  Probiotics are important and having Aloe Vera Juice in my water at bed time and late morning did wonders.  I also take Kyolic Greens and they do seem to help.Frequent small meals help considerably.  Every 3 hours I would eat a small meal.  Example: 4oz chicken and some greens.Buy the book.  Email me if you want more details.

I've never had anxiety attacks and taking Prevacid is the only things that's different since the attacks started. Now my doctor has pescribed Xanax for my anxiety but don't know that I should be taking it. Like I've said_ I consider myslef to be pretty active physically and socially.

Before taking prevacid 30mg I would get terrible heartburn after every meal! Even a small cracker would cause heartburn.

A trip to the GI doctor later_ I was diagnosed with an h.pylori-induced ulcer at the ripe old age of 19! After completing Prevpac_ I noticed strong irritation still in my stomach and decided to remain on Prevacid. I had stopped taking the med for some time only to be forced back into taking it.

Spoke to my gastroenternologist who told me to keep the medicine going. Spoke to my internist the following day who told me to drop it down to only 30mg once in the morning. Have done so_ but it's increasingly hard to breath at times. Dizziness increased in the subsequent two days and blood pressure problems began. I'd get up and have to grab onto something. Dizziness and weakness in my legs like I had run a marathon. Took my last pill this morning_ will not take another ever again. Side effects are too severe for me.

Once years ago_ while taking it_ and then after a period of not taking it (with no flutters) I began taking it again only to have heart symptoms. Last two episodes placed me in the hospital - once for 2 days_ after $12_000 worth of tests_ only to be told there was nothing wrong with my heart. Most know that Advil contains NSAID (non sterroidal anti inflammatory drug) which can cause palpitations. What most do not know_ is that Prevacid ALSO contains a large portion of NSAID's. I have stopped taking Prevacid and will NEVER take it again. Although Prevacid does not list a side effect of it's medication as heart palpitaions_ it does list that it contains NSIADS which have been directly linked to fatal heart attacks. *note: this time when the A-fib changed back to normal sinus rythym_,F,34,4  years,4/16/2007,Prevacid

I saw my family physician and told him that I thought that my problem was due to Prevacid.  He told me to discontinue taking it.  It took about a week to get back to ""normal"".
