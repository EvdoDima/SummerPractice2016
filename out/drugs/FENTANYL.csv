0, 5, spinal stenosis,Zero_ I was a couch potato for 5 years because of debilitating pain,If used as prescribed I could finally get off the couch and do things that I could not do for years. Friends could not believe how I changed back and started doing work that I only dreamed of. I am not high from the fentanyl_ all it did was make my pain bearable.,M,60,1.5  years50 mcg/hr 1X O,10/4/2015Email,Fentanyl
1, 4, Pain two bad hips_back spurs_vertab,It took a year for my body to adjust. Dizzy_ I did not want food. I still Itch on some brands_ mainly scalp.It is VERY sun sensitive. Can kill you. Take warnings seriously.,It is not supposed to help you with weight_ but I lost over 80 lbs_ because my appetite just was not there. (I needed to) And I continue for over a year now to maintain the same weight_ because my taste buds changed so. Foods I liked or loved- are no longer good. Small portions are all I want.,F,77,2  years25 mcg/h 1X O,7/12/2015Email,Fentanyl
2, 3, Neuropathic and Spinal cord injury,The drug was fine for 9 1/2 years_ then the patches would leave complete red patches that would become so itchy that you could not keep them on for more than 4 hours. The skin ulcerated and became infected. WE had to  finally quit and was started on Oxycodone / Naloxone and it is working much better. The skin is starting to heal but it will be weeks if not months before it is completely healed. Dr did not know what was causing the problem.,I believe it was the adhesive and not the Fentanyl. I do not know what to do. It was very good for so many years and it seems as though the glue started the problem and nothing we could do to stop it.,M,69,10  years75 mic 1X O,7/12/2015,Fentanyl
3, 5, severe upper back pain (Thoracic),Due to dose I have breakthrough pain thru out day. At times I have sweats.,This medication has truly saved my life. I finally sleep after 6 yrs of suffering. I'm losing weight.feel much better if only I can get the dose correct to fix the breakthrough pain I would just maybe be able to work again.,F,56,3  months25mg,4/9/2015Email,Fentanyl
4, 5, Fibromyalgia_ Chronic Pain Syndrome,Constipation_  drowsiness.   Note: these do not make me high_  though I am sure that my body is physically addicted to them - I have been taking them for 14 years now.,The Fentanyl Patch gave me my life back.   Before I was placed on it I was in constant pain_  so much pain that it made me nauseous and would keep me from sleeping.   I began with the 50 patch but soon realized it was not enough so went to 75.  After a few years I went up to 100_ but it made me too drowsy  - back to the 75.  That seems the best for me.   I place them on my upper chest alternating sides.  I've found the one's with the liquid reservoir to work the best.   To maintain the correct dose I change patches every other day.,M,58,14  years75 mcg/hr 1X O,6/27/2014,Fentanyl
5, 2, Joint/back pain,Worked well for pain at first. After two years became drug resistant withFlu-ish symptoms. Changed to morphine. The withdrawal from Fentanyl was TERRIBLE. The worst thing I've experienced.,,M,56,3  years300mgx2day,6/27/2013Email,Fentanyl
6, 2, Upper Endoscopy,Nausea_ dry mouth_ dizziness_ nervousness.,"I was given Fentanyl as a part of my sedation ""cocktail"" and to ease any pain I might experience during my procedure. I didn't make me feel calmer_ it only made me feel nervous and sick to my stomach. I hated it. I don't usually take well to pain killers_ and this one was no exception. I know it helps some people deal with their pain_ but this stuff is just not for me.",F,26,1  days 1X D,5/10/2012,Fentanyl
7, 5, Nerve Pain,Im noticing people are rating Fentanyl that don't regularly use it. They've just had an experience w/it as part of a surgery.That's interesting. I have been using this med for over six yrs after trying most every other pain therapy and med. and it is by far the less addictive -it hasn't caused me to need or crave more. It provides excellent pain relief for a severe chronic pain problem.It also -at least in my state -has by far the lowest deaths by overdose as compared to other opiates. It's ideal for people with nerve pain who need a steady stream of pain med.I get the kind of patches w/o the gel inside so I can cut them in half and put a half on every other day. It makes the dose more even.Also_I have better luck putting them on by my hipbones then on my back-not sure why? But I do-the skin is thinner and they stick better there. I do take hot baths and they still work well. Not recommending the hot baths for everyone but for nerve pain it helps. The directions say it releases the med faster_tho_so? Might make your patch not last as long_ Seems fine for me. Doing the patches in half I get no creepy withdrawals and they work well. Good luck to everybody :) hope your pain becomes better n easier. The side effects are some tiredness and feeling a little checked out sometimes.,,F,48,6  years50 mg,3/19/2012,Fentanyl
8, 5, Arthritis pains,Helps with pain very well with little side effects_ mostly constipated.,Great medicine and I think because it's a patch vs pill_ it is abused less by street people.,F,56, 255 mg 1X O,8/2/2011Email,Fentanyl
9, 3, Systemic Scleroderma Disease,The Fentanyl Patch works very well WHEN I get the correct dosage_ but they are unreliable.  sometimes the patches do not deliver the correct amount of Fentanyl. I am chemically dependent on the patch and easy to tell when low dose,I wish they would check their dosages more carefully - fairly often I do NOT get the correct amount.  When I am getting the correct amount in the patch I do quite well.,F,58,10  years25mcg 1X D,7/25/2011Email,Fentanyl
10, 2, ENG procedure,Severe headaches after 5 days post-op. This has happened twice. October 2010 and May 2011. Was told by Doc that I was also given Versed... so don't know if reaction was from Versed_ Fentanyl or both,Good news was I do not have any memory of the procedures... but only tied the severe headaches to the meds today. When the headache occured in October_ PCP did not identify that they could be from procedure done by other doc 5 days before... so went through a series of test (CT scan_ eye test_ blood work) in Oct 2010 that never identified the root cause. So I tied the headaches today after recalling the last severe headache occured 5 days post op past time.,M,59,1  times 2X AN,5/16/2011Email,Fentanyl
11, 4, patch for back_butt_leg_foot pain,slightly tired_ a little dizzy at times.,I lived with severe back pain for about 13 years. Basically lived in my bed for 10 of those years. I had SEVERAL surgeries_ procedures and therapies but no relief. I hurt so bad I wished I would not wake up at times. Depression became a monkey on my back that I thought would never go away. Using this and Neurontin has given me back a life. Not a perfect life but a thousand times happier one.,F,43,1  years25mcg/hr 1X O,4/28/2011Email,Fentanyl
12, 4, Post surgical hand pain,No side effects.,until time to detox-that was pure hell. Overall_ I am glad it was there when I needed it since nothing else worked.,F,54,5  months75 mcg 1X O,4/3/2011Email,Fentanyl
13, 1, Sheath Removal,I was drowsy from the Morphine and when given Fentanyl I  literally went from feeling drowsy to being wide awake.,The physician needed to remove my sheath after an Angiogram.  He requested 25 mcg IV_ which woke me up.  The nurse gave me 50 mcg more_ which woke me up even more.  This medication did not make me tired at all.  The removal of the sheath was very  painful.  I am not sure if this is common_ but Fentanyl is not for me.,F,37, 75 mcg 1X O,12/2/2010,Fentanyl
14, 5, IBD,Drowsiness_ Euphoria,Great pain medication. This is the only narcotic analgesic I did not experience negative side effects with; it controlled my pain as required. I would take this medication any day over a horrible drug like morphine. The euphoria with this medication is awesome. Given pre-procedurally_ it works like a charm.,M,25,3  days50-100 mcg 2X AN,7/7/2010,Fentanyl
15, 3, Chronic migraine.,Sedation_ unable to keep anything down.,I was given fentanyl in an IV first when it helped a little_ and then was given the patch while I was in the hospital for a chronic migraine that wouldn't go away after 5 days. I barely remember much of went on because of constant medications that were given to me_ but I do remember being given the patch and not having much pain relief_ but not being able to do anything besides sleep and throwing up.,F,27,1  daysPatch. 1X D,4/30/2010,Fentanyl
16, 2, Chronic pain,Sweating_ nausea_ unreliable dosage_ sometimes too much_ sometimes nothing_ allergic to adhesive.,Would be great_ if reliable.,F,52,17  months,4/5/2009Email,Fentanyl
17, 5, nerve damage,Maybe some drowsiness-hard to tell because I take a few medications.,This has been an absolute miracle for me. As for lawsuits and danger warnings-all the cases I have read about have been caused by abusing the drug or drs prescribing Fentanyl for patients that were not tolerant to opiods.This is he only med. I have taken that provides me with complete pain relief on many days. If I do a lot of physical stuff I have breakthrough pain_ bt it is NOTHING like what I used to have. I have taken most every pain med and these patches have far_ far less side effects. I am so thankful for this drug!!,F,44,2  years,11/30/2008,Fentanyl
18, 2, Colonoscopy,I was given Fentanyl in combination with Versed for a routine colonoscopy. The procedure went very well - little pain_ but I vomited for 12 hours afterwards and had vertigo_ especially when driving for the next 4 days. I had to take an additional day off work to recover. I am not sure whether the Versed was to blame or the Fentanyl or both??,,F,49,1  days,6/11/2008,Fentanyl
19, 5, Bone pain,"Few problems initially other than a bit of a ""high"" the first day of application of a higher dose patch (100 mcg).  Very slight constipation but much less than with the likes of OxyContin.  However_ by the time I'd been on the higher dose for a month I truly noticed a sharp decline in my cognition and felt my brain was becoming like ""Swiss Cheese"".",I found it a superb drug in all honesty for the most part.  The patch was great as I didn't have to remember to take a daily dose_ and it stayed on even in the shower.  I would have absolutely continued on with it if it hadn't been for the cognitive deficits at the higher dose.   Thankfully my bone pain subsided naturally within 3 months of my coming off all my narcotics so I didn't need to take it again.,F,49,4  months,11/4/2007Email,Fentanyl
20, 2, colonoscopy,I became extremely nauseous.  Even after taking anti-nausea medication_ the nausea lasted for about 8 hours.,Given all the horrible reports about Versed_ I requested Fentanyl alone for my colonoscopy.  I became extremely nauseous midway through the procedure.  In the future_ I'll find a provider who uses propofol.,F,53,1  days,9/2/2007,Fentanyl
