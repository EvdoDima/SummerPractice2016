7, 4, acute gastroenteritis,This is day 4 of a 7 day course. The doctor said I could stop after 5 days if I felt better--which I am. Before I started this med I was having horrific bloating and pain that sent me to the ER where they said I had a blockage_ so I took a stool softener but it did nothing. A week later I had a CT scan with dye. Was told I had acute gastroenteritis. My stool is semi-normal but slightly soft_ but no diarrhea. I'm having some of the side-effects others have described: metallic taste in mouth_ dull headache_ weird dreams_ but I am thankfully able to sleep fairly well. I've also been going to work (teacher) which has kept my mind off how awful I do feel! :) I'm probably going to stop at day 5. I'll see.,I'm also taking an equal amount of Cipro_ which by itself is bad enough as far as making you feel dragged out and just plain creepy.,M,67,7  days500mg 2X D,12/5/2015Email,Flagyl er
