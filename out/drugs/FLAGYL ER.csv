7, 4, acute gastroenteritis,This is day 4 of a 7 day course. The doctor said I could stop after 5 days if I felt better--which I am. Before I started this med I was having horrific bloating and pain that sent me to the ER where they said I had a blockage_ so I took a stool softener but it did nothing. A week later I had a CT scan with dye. Was told I had acute gastroenteritis. My stool is semi-normal but slightly soft_ but no diarrhea. I'm having some of the side-effects others have described: metallic taste in mouth_ dull headache_ weird dreams_ but I am thankfully able to sleep fairly well. I've also been going to work (teacher) which has kept my mind off how awful I do feel! :) I'm probably going to stop at day 5. I'll see.,I'm also taking an equal amount of Cipro_ which by itself is bad enough as far as making you feel dragged out and just plain creepy.,M,67,7  days500mg 2X D,12/5/2015Email,Flagyl er

120, 2, diarrhea caused by clindamicin,mainly dizziness and weakness,I took two weeks of clindamicin as a result of a root canal. Ten days after finishing clindamicin_ I started having severe diarrhea. Dr. prescribed 10 days of flagyl_ 500mg 3 times per day. Diarrhea stopped and bowel movements returned to normal. Seven days later diarrhea started again and Dr. put me on 7 days of flagyl_ 500mg 3 times per day. I'm in my 5th day and am not seeing any significant results as yet. Two more days to go_ so we'll see. Stomach grouls with watery sounds and soft_ grainy_ watery_ loose_ smelly bowel movements. No evidence of blood in bowel movements. I'll never take clindamicin again!!! Dr. says it could take 4-6 weeks to clear this up. It's very frustrating. Is there any other treatment out there that will take care of this problem faster??,M,67, ,10/12/2008,Flagyl er

Also_ the taste in my mouth is terrible-I feel like i'm chewing on aluminum foil. I only need to be on it for five days so I'm going to tough it out. Unfortunately_ I am finding it very_ very difficult to concentrate on my school work_ even my vision is blurry (I'm in nursing school-tough stuff!) and hope it doesn't effect the grade on my next test. There must be a better med out there.  Advice-if you are taking any meds that may make your HR increase (ex. pseudoephiderine) STOP! It will only make you feel that much worse.  :( :(",I suggest trying another medication first.

The Giardia is MUCH WORSE than taking the Flagyl. I think many people have panic_ distress and/or depression already before they take this drug as a result of (perhaps) prolonged unresolved health issues. The health issues realy take their toll and with parasites_ sometimes the diagnosis is slwo in coming with most us already having taken multiple drugs  before we get to Flagyl.

It gives me a racing heart. It puts me in a slump. It does not allow me to enjoy eating.  It causes me to have night sweats.  It's hard to tell whether you are better or the effects are strong that they make you crazy a bit.  I hope all on it don't have to go through that.,Also_ was anyone ever treated with an alternative of flagyl?If anyone has the same effect_ let me know.

I was in the ER for a C diff infection.

I fell three or four times during the week_ until I realized I needed to be careful.  This drug seems to make you more accident prone. Today I woke up and I have hives on my back and hip areas.  Again_ it could be the Lyme Herx or a reaction to the drug.  However_ for me_ someone with chronic Lyme_ this drug helps.  The cure is defenitely not worse than the disease.  It has helped with my cognitive problems as well as my joint pain.  I found that I had a rapid heart beat and some skips.  I did some research and started taking magnesium supplements.  You have to take it several hours before your antibiotics..but ALL of my heart symptoms cleared.,,F,43,30  days,2/26/2008Email,Flagyl er

I'm pretty sure all of the side effects were coming from Flagyl_ but can't be sure.The idea to put the pill into an empty gelatin capsule is BRILLIANT.  I haven't tried it_ but would highly recommend it.First course (10 days) was 1 month ago.  I could live with some dizziness_ tiredness_ lack of concentration_ nausea.  This got a lot worse at the end of 10 days.  Had to start the same course 3 weeks later and started vomiting also.  Called doctor and doctor told me to take a break.  I've been off the pills for a day and I'm a new man.  I hope I never have to go back on Flagyl again.  I cringe just thinking about the pills and the taste in my mouth (which doesn't go away after taking the pill_ but is worst when taking the pill).  It really is bad.  May get rid of the bacteria_ but if there are other pills you can take...take the other ones.,M,37,10  days,2/22/2008,Flagyl er

Spoke to a friend who took this medicine earlier and she had the excact same experience - topped with breathing difficulties.

The C diff was from Clindamycin for lingual tonsillitis. Yesterday_ one day after finishing Flagyl_ I had another bout of  diarrhea.

I had taken this medicine before for a shorter time with none of these effects_ and wonder if it doesn't affect the skin unless it's in your system for a longer period.  Anyway_ hope this helps anyone else out there!!,F,31,14  days,4/28/2007,Flagyl er
163, 4, Giardasis,Slight headaches in afternoonsDetectable malaise and some irritability. None of the other_ more unpleasant ones mentioned in this list below...,Fortunately_ I've had no huge negative side effects for the last 7 days (I'm finishing day 7_ the last day_ today). However_ I'm not completely convinced I won't have to do one more course of this stuff -- I feel 98%_ not 100%.Didn't feel the improvement in my system until days 3 and 4.My suggestion is drink lots of water and stay away from foods that irritate this condition_ particularly fatty foods. I stuck with breads and simple things and improved significantly after day 4. Other reports from other users made me scared of this drug_ but it turned out to work very well.,M,34,7  days,3/16/2007Email,Flagyl er
164, 3, intestinal prob&chronic bursitis,This is a weird_ scary drug.Am on day eight of ten at @250mg three times a day. Some parts of the day I get scary episodes of breathlessness_ other times intense muscle aches_nausea_ dizziness_ confusion. I've was so sick before taking this drug that I'm willing to go thru this but it has been very scary.,,F,62,8  days,2/28/2007Email,Flagyl er
165, 1, intestinal parasites,anxiety_ light-headedness (to the point where i had to stop driving) and extreme muscle weakness. it was a nightmare.,after visiting my dr. after three days of taking this_ she told me that these were indeed side effects that 'some' patients experience. i had read up on the site before i took them and thought the negative comments were a bit hystrionic; i digress...this was one of the worst side effects i have experienced. :(,F,45,3  days,2/16/2007,Flagyl er
166, 1, Bacterial Infection,Vomiting_ diarrhea_ aches/pains_ fever_ sensitive skin (pins and needles feeling)_ crying_ headache_ hard time sleeping_ and I felt like I was going out of my mind!,I will never ever take this again. Called doctor at start of symptoms and they told me to keep taking it and call back in two days if I still had problems. Those two days were probably the sickest I have ever been. I wish I would of stop taking them before. Called doctor two days later and they said to stop taking and they would prescribe something else. Horrible!,F,27,7  days,1/26/2007,Flagyl er

172, 1, Diverticulitis,I am on my 2nd 14 day course of 500mg 4 times a day. I begged the Doctor to give me something else. This stuff is poison! I have every horrible symptom from joint and muscle aches_dizziness_ disoriented_ blurred vision_horrendous headaches_nausea..... Does anyone know if there is another drug that can substitute for this? My doctor says no.I think she believes I'm just a whiner.My life is completely on hold for now.I can't drive or do the many other things I did daily due to the dizziness and heaaches.Did I mention depression? I cry more times in a day than I normally would in months.,,F,49,4  days,10/23/2006,Flagyl er
173, 1, tooth abcess,After taking 2 tablets(400) I felt breathless. Got a weakness during the night along with a tightness in my chest_lack of oxygen_ severe back ache_ period like cramps and spotting_ nausea and dizziness.,I wouldn't take this drug ever again. Never experienced this type of reaction to any drug. I thought that I was having a heart attack. The whole reaction lasted for 2 hours. A very frightening experience. I was also on a course of clonamox 500 for the previous 4 days.,F,37,1  days,10/6/2006,Flagyl er
174, 2, Bacterial vaginosis,I too seemed to get almost all of the UNCOMMON side effects.  I didn't get the metallic taste but holy DEPRESSION.  I RARELY cry_ I'm usually overall pretty happy and have energy to do my fitness routine but this made me feel awful.  I cried a lot and my mood was just at an absolute low.  Lots of nausea_ no appetite_ my joints hurt_ NO ENERGY_ felt uncoordinated_ could NOT sleep and the weird UNCOMMON side effect was rectal pain - everything seemed to get swollen and just overall really painful and THEN..... A YEAST INFECTION!! YAY ME!!  Never again Flagyl_ never again.,,F,28,7  days,8/5/2006Email,Flagyl er

177, 4, c. diff,"Depression. Learned today from a health practitioner that Flagyl can cause depression.  So pleased to learn that because I was getting to a ""bad"" place.  The horrible taste_ of course_ and  thrush on the tongue_ for which I took a statin ""swish and swallow"" med. Exhaustion so that I am fatigued from the slightest activity. Nausea for a while in the a.m. after a bowel movement -- I never had morning sickness when pregnant -- this must be retribution.  Mint gum has helped.  Headache and weirdness in the head sometime -- not really dizzy_ but just weird.",A health practitioner said her husband had tried everything to coat the Flagyl and found honey the best.  I tried that and find it does work OK.  Many of you suggest milk -- I'm told to stay away from dairy except yogurt with active cultures.  What about that?  I was on a 10 day course_ but became ill again about 5 days off the Flagyl and also had a postive stool culture.  Am about finished with another 14 day course.  I hope this will do it_ but recognize from talking to others and reading that this problem can continue for a long time.  It is depressing to think about because I also have MS_ which is enough_ thank you.  I had my reaction after taking Amoxycillian related to a root canal_ which I'd take previously many times without problems.  I fear the future and how they will treat me for infections.  I'm allergic to Cipro and one other antibiotic.  This is getting too depressing -- it's not just the Flagyl_ but that sure doesn't help.,M,63,20  days,5/9/2006,Flagyl er
178, 2, bacterial vaginosis,depression_ out of body experiences_ severe irritability_ uncontrollable crying_ loss of appetite_ metallic taste_ fishy smelling discharge_ PMS like feeling_ unusual heart palpitations.,This medicine wasn't that bad until my last day taking it. The symptoms may have been affecting me before_ however_ until the last day. It caused serious depression for me that day. I thought I was losing my mind. I cried atleast three times on the last day of taking the medication. I also begin having very negative feelings toward my boyfriend. It made me feel as if I was no longer in love with him. I truly feel like I am losing my mind. I have had really high moments and then really low moments all in a few hours- scary. I wish I would have been told about this. Like many reviews I've read I am truly glad I came upon this website and I vow to never take this medication again. The side effects just aren't worth it at all. I feel like a guinea pig for some terrible experiment. I am truly sorry for all of us who have had to take this medication and hope that something better comes along soon_ so that no one else has to take it. My symptoms have ended_ however.,F,19,7  days,4/7/2006,Flagyl er
179, 1, rosacea,none - yet?,according to the package insert_ metronidazole causes cancer in mice and rats but not hamsters. I'd rather have rosacea than cancer. (I was taking the MetroGel version of this drug.),F,36,5  days,3/22/2006,Flagyl er
180, 4, VAGINITIS,"I had to take flagyl twice_ the first time my infection didnt clear.  I was put o it again along with another antibiotic.  It has been a week since I have finished and I am experiencing joint pain_ numbness and tingling in my hands_ arm and feet. I have tremors/ chills_ similar to like hot flashes.  I have read so many responses to this medicine and Im not alone.  The fact is_ doctors say that the side effects I named are the more ""UNCOMMON"" but it doesnt mean that you wont experience them!  Also_ I was treated in the emergency room and I probably should've waited to go to my OBGYN simply because I was on two different antibiotics_ still taking birth control_ and diflucan.  Ay one else experience these symptons after taking flagyl?",,F,28,7  days,3/20/2006Email,Flagyl er
181, 1, diverticulitis,"Bad taste in mouth (not ""metallic_"" just horrible)_ out of it feeling.  Side effects are like a sickness in and of themselves.",I have found that if I coat the pill in applesauce (put applesauce on spoon first_ then lay pill on top and cover it with applesauce)_ it goes down easier.  Still take with water.  Make sure applesauce is all over the pill. My dissatisfaction rating (1) is NOT due to the fact that it doesn't work. I just would not recommend this drug to anyone if there is an alternative that is not so debilitating.,F,54,7  days,3/2/2006,Flagyl er
182, 3, Bacterial Infection,The side effects of this medicine are awful!!  I honestly thought I was pregnant.  I had nausea_ sore breasts_ achy joints_ headache_ confusion_ lethargy_ and just felt awful.  Also the taste this medicine leaves in your mouth is enough to make you sick.  I was not warned by my doctor that it could make even water taste bitter.  I had poared myself a big glass of milk and thought it was bad_ then realized it made the milk taste awful.  I will never take this again because I just feel terrible!!,Not worth it-I'm sure they have another drug that can clear up these dieseases.  On 500 mg and had side effects after the first pill!!,F,21,7  days,12/20/2005,Flagyl er

184, 5, BV,Lots of side effects. I feel sick to my stomach a few hours after taking them_ I have a metalic taste in my mouth when I first wake up_ rapid heartrate_ dizzyness_ headaches & loose stool (with frequent bathroom trips) are also some of the effects. Lastly_ the frothy white discharge that comes with BV_ turned into a thicker dark brown discharge towards the end of treatment_ and I also got some spotting.,I'm so glad I read the comments on this website! I thought I was going to have a heartattack a few times before reading that that others have had rapid heart rates with this drug. It's good to know I'm not the only one_ and its the drug_ not my heart_ thats the problem. But cleared up my infection!,F,24,7  days,10/19/2005,Flagyl er
