0, 1, pregnancy prevention,I had the whole cha bang. I thought i was dying. I hated the dizziness bloating fatigue mild nausea. Then when i realized that it was the pill i stopped taking it and the dizziness increased  started to lose my appetite lost weight extremities tingled and at one point i felt chest pains. All this started to happen and increase when my husband went into the hospital with kidney failure. I was left with the three young kids_ could not work and had to deal with these horrid symptoms at the same time. I really hate this poison and really wonder why the doc gave it to me even after I complained about the depo shot.,Gonna stay away from this mess.  I would never go back to that doc office either. They got it wrong twice.,F,42,2  months 1X D,7/30/2016,Aviane-28
1, 1, Cramps regulate periods moods,Severe mood swings_ disoriented_ headaches_ severe Insomnia_ confusion_ aniaxity_ acne,The absolute WORST second month. The first month was fine aside from slight breakthrough bleeding but these last few weeks have been dreadful. I am super healthy work out almost every day had perfect skin. I broke out all over my chin a week ago had the craziest mood swings could not sleep at all the last few nights. Last night both feet were freezing cold then went really hot and tingly I'm sure it's due to this terrible pill. I stopped taking it immediately and refuse to take any more birth control its not worth it. This pill is the WORST don't take it!!!!!'nnn,F,38,2  months,7/5/2016Email,Aviane-28
2, 3, Regulate Periods,,I began taking Aviane a month ago to regulate my period. It does work but I have really heavy period flow and menstrual cramps. This pill made me really emotional. I also noticed slight augmented breasts.,F,18,1  days,6/23/2016,Aviane-28
3, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Avianne 28 seemed fine the first few months_ then out of nowhere I started bleeding like crazy with cramps when I wasn't supposed to get my period for another two weeks. I have been bleeding nonstop for 8 days& am not supposed to get my period for another few days. Horrible review for this pill. Really messed me up& made me emotional on top of it.,,F,19,5  months,6/1/2016,Aviane-28
4, 1, Prevent pregnancy,By the second on aviane I was extremely tired_ moody_ crying_ and feeling sick. I knew this was high unusual and stopped right away. Now a week after stopping I am experiencing such heavy bleeding with clots and mild cramping. I had just stopped my period the week before so this is just weird. This pill was horrible. I'll be staying away from hormone bc and stick to condoms. Not worth the trauma.,,F,35,2  days,5/12/2016,Aviane-28
5, 1, Regulate period,I have been on Aviane for about 9 months and this by far the worst birth control i have ever been on ! I switched my pill due to random bleeding and now my face is breaking out every day! I had beautiful skin and now i have pimples between my eyebrows and chin. Not to mention I barely have a sex drive. Do not take this pill !,,F,26,9  months,4/26/2016,Aviane-28
6, 1, Heavy periods and bad acne,I have been on Aviane on and off for 10 years to control my heavy menstral cycle and bad acne. I recently started again from being off it for 6 months at the most and I noticed I started to feel sick. Headaches_ dizziness_ fatigue_ nausea_ cramps_ bloating_ loss of appetite_ decreased sex drive_ and just in general unwell. I realised this is why ive been always sick...from Birth Control. I will be stopping for good and I believe BC affects eveyone differently.,,F,25,10  years,3/30/2016,Aviane-28

Hot flashes and night sweats_ loss of weight and appetite_ insomnia_ mood swings (not super severe but still very much present). Increased sex drive (like suppppperrrrr increased),I really hate this damn pill. Like--I'm about to cry while writing the review.

9, 3, Birth control,Weight gain_ acne_ tender breasts_ fatigue,I was switched from Falmina control to Aviane. The other worked a lot better. It was easier for me to lose weight which is a goal of mine right now. Aviane sucks. I will give it a couple more months to see if anything changes.,F,27,2  months,1/15/2016,Aviane-28
10, 1, Pregnancy prevention,Nausea_ anxiety_ weight gain_ acne_ mood swings_ headaches_ irregular period_ major cramping_ extreme pms_fatigue,Finally realized after taking this bc for over 2 years_ that a lot of my side effects have stopped or have gotten better since stopping taking this medication for over a month.

12, 1, Prevent pregnancy\help with cramps,Nausea_ headaches_ emotional_ weight gain,I took this pill for years and was happy with it. Then_ I stopped taking it earlier this year for about 7 months and started taking it again. I figured everything would be fine since it always had been in the past but I was so wrong. I have been not too far off from a train wreck since I started up on this again! I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with me and after changing my diet_ etc I finally realized that this pill is most likely my issue.  Since starting this pill again I've experienced headaches_ dizziness_ an emotional rollercoaster (I've never been an emotional person)_ sore boobs (never an issue previously)_ and an ongoing battle with bloating and weight gain.  And I swear all of these symptoms just keep getting worse. Random stuff makes me cry which is so out of character for me. I've always been weight conscious and no matter how healthy I eat or how little I eat_ I can't get rid of this bloat I have. It was like I woke up one morning and gained weight over night. I was mortified to wake up and find that I couldn't get my jeans on (& I've been in the same size jeans for years now). I also started waking up with sore boobs...super sore. I can barely even get my bra on and I swear I gained a half cup size overnight. I get nausea most mornings to the extreme that I think I am actually going to throw up. I am DONE with this pill. I'm not even finishing the pack. I hate what it's done to me and its been driving me insane trying to figure out what has be,F,29,5  years,10/9/2015Email,Aviane-28
13, 5, Prevent pregnancy,I've been on this pill for a year now and I have no issue no side effects nothing_ it's done it's job correctly and I am not with child!!!I never gained weight or got horrible acne_ didn't make me sick_ nothing. But I can say the only thing it do to me was when I first started taking it I had my period for like 2 weeks until my body formed withe the pill.,,F,26,1  years.10,7/2/2015,Aviane-28
14, 3, Prevent pregnancy,I used to take lo loestrin fe which I absolutely loved but I couldn't afford it anymore so my doctor switched me to this. My periods are lighter and tolerable_ acne is controlled. Overall I'm extremely tired almost all the time and my breasts have been very sensitive lately and hurt a lot of the time out of nowhere which I'm starting to get sick of and may switch pills because of this since it's almost unbearable.,,F,19,5  months0.12mg,6/12/2015Email,Aviane-28
15, 1, Pregnancy Prevention,I've always been an anxious persona but after about 7-8 months of using this pill I began experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks. I also began experiencing horrible signs of depression_ feelings of emptiness and lack of motivation. I can't sleep through the night anymore and cry over everything and anything possible. I get very mean and experience lots of highs and lows. I can wake up in a great mood and that can change by the time the afternoon hits. This is horrible and it's ruining my relationship! I mean I'm taking a pill to prevent pregnancy and it's making me not even want to have sex! Save yourself_ don't take this pill.,,F,22,1  years 1X D,5/30/2015Email,Aviane-28
16, 1, Birth control,I took aviane when I was younger and there were no apparent negative effects_ so now years later I am taking it again. This time It has had horrible effects on me. Complete loss of sex drive_ horrific mood swings_ and intense menstral cramps. I also experienced scary amounts of fibrous and bloody discharge that looked and felt like much more than my monthly shedding of my uterine wall.My boyfriend and family said I was becoming crazy and a different person. It has made me reconsider taking oral contraceptives all together.,,F,25,6  weeks,4/26/2015,Aviane-28
17, 1, Acne_ prevent pregnancy,Major mood swings_ acne_ depression,I took this birth control for almost 3 years and now that I'm off of it I realize it was the cause of my depression! I was originally put on it for acne which it did nothing for. I continued to stay on it because I was afraid to switch since I'm sensitive to medications. This birth control almost cause my boyfriend and I to break up because of my major mood swings. One moment I would be saying I loved him and the next moment I would be insulting him! Aviane made me crazy! I'm angry I stayed on it for so long because now I won't get those years of my life back.,F,19,2  years,2/15/2015,Aviane-28

19, 2, Frequent periods_heavy cycles,Not usually a miserable  person and definitely not emotional. I was wondering why I've been feeling this way for a while. I would snap quickIy when someone would say something. Feel extremely logy in the day time and extremely emotional at night.  I would wake up the 3 am in the morning for no apparent reason. Behind the eye headaches and ice pick migraine like headaches. Thought i needed glasses.  Never had eye problems. I was booking appointments with all kinds of doctors too get each symptom checked out.  Feeling like I'm braking down. Just realized I'm on aviane. Seems like I have no hope with birth control. The only good thing it did was too clear up my acne. I really wanted that too but unfortunately I can't risk my hormones and emotions.,,F,,30  days 1X D,1/6/2015Email,Aviane-28
20, 2, Prevent pregnancy,I've taken this pill off and on for a couple years. I've noticed on the pill: extremely emotional (about everything) anxiety and generally unhappy. I'm complete day and night on this pill. Realized should probably stop when I couldn't have a serious convo with my partner without crying.,,F,28,9  months,12/12/2014Email,Aviane-28
21, 1, heavy menstrual bleeding,terrible anxiety and panic attacks which went away when I stopped this drug.,I thought I was dying as I couldn't breathe_ and didn't know what was happening to me. Went to the emergency 7 times in a week - turns out it was panic attacks caused by Aviane.,F,36,3  months 1X D,12/4/2014,Aviane-28
22, 4, Cramps and prevent pregnancy,Overly emotional_ headaches_ acne_ nausea_ weight gain,During my first month of this pill I became extremely emotional. I'm usually a laid back person but my partner didn't know what to do with me! Of course he was patient with me because I was starting new medication. The first 2 to 3 weeks I would have very slight nausea when waking up_ and I couldn't est that much_ but despite that I gained about 5 pounds. Everyone says the pill can't make you go in weight but how else would you explain random weight gain when you're eating less than before and exercising the same amount? Those side effects are now gone after the second month_ except for the weight gain. Now_ just ending month 4_ and I've noticed I get headaches and acne just after starting the inactive pill every month. My pharmacist just switched me to alessya so we'll see how that goes.,F,19,4  months,12/2/2014,Aviane-28
23, 4, Birth control,Small  headache _ cramps_ being hungry,The first week was a little off_ I had a few spottings. It wasn't heavy. Now I dont  feel anything. I haven't had anything happen to me.

26, 1, Hormone balance,Severe anxiety_ insomnia_ soaking night sweats_ can't function due to dizzy nausea,It's been 3 weeks since I took my last pill _ and a few days ago I started having night sweats and severe anxiety attacks that I had while on the pill.  I can't get off the couch due to head spinning and full body tremors. My hormones are so wrecked still due to 10 days on this dangerous pill. I have missed a month of my life due to being so sick_ sleep deprived_ and anxiety ridden. I had my blood taken yesterday to see what is going on.  I am so exhausted from shaking 3 days straight. Never take this pill. The negative effects last long after the last dose. Praying for relief and just want to wake up one morning and hug my kids without being covered in sweat and shaking like a crack addict. I am so sick of how this stoke my life and happiness. Hoping the new doctor can help me.,F,41,10  days20 1X D,10/3/2014,Aviane-28
27, 1, Hormone balance,Insomnia _ feeling of low blood sugar_ severe anxiety_ the worst two weeks of my life _ nervous_ nausea_ hair loss.,This pill completely screwed up my hormone balance.  I thought I was unbalanced before.  Boy I had no idea of the  nightmare to follow after taking that first pill.  The synthetic progesterone in this pill is not enough to balance women with deficiencies.  It actually makes thing worse by completely stopping your body from producing any of its own progesterone.  This equals extreme estrogen dominance.  I thought I was dying. Shaking_ sweating_ for a week.  After stopping the pill it took a month to recover.  I still suffer from insomnia and low blood sugar.  Hoping time will take this away.  I had to start on progesterone cream to combat the anxiety attacks as well.  Birth control pills are not the answer to mid life hormone balance! If your doctor tells you it is_ google anxiety attacks after stopping birth control and cancer caused by excess estradiol and make an informed decision on your own.,F,42,12  days20 1X D,9/26/2014,Aviane-28
28, 1, Heavy periods,Headache_ fatigue_ sleep issues_ can't concentrate_ anxiety attacks! Bleeding every day on active pills_ hair loss and  acne,I wanted this pill to work. I wanted to be the 5 star review saying this pill created balance_ and I feel great_ but in reality_ I can't find 10 reviews in any pill category stating they are 100% satisfied and emotionally stable for an extended length of time.  If you can endure 3 months your body goes into a hormone coma_ and you view that as relief. The drug company picks when you bleed by withdrawing hormones so you have break through bleeding NOT a period my friends. Here's to handing your emotional and physical health over to a big pharm company who doesn't care what synthetic-carcinogenic garbage they dump into our bodies_,F,25,60  days10 1X D,9/22/2014,Aviane-28
29, 1, Hormone balance,Can't sleep for more than 2 hours at a time then stay awake sweating all night__ fatigue_ general feeling of no energy or motivation,I finished the first pack and can't bring myself to finish the next pack_ I am not myself. I get irritated at the smallest thing_ get dizzy spells where I can't stand up or concentrate. I just want to be me again. This sucks! I have no idea when my next period will be or how my hormones will react after stopping_ but my family and friends are suffering due to my dwindling mental and physical health.,F,26,21  days10 1X D,9/22/2014,Aviane-28
30, 1, Birth Control,Lost 8 pounds_ and was already close to under weight. (5'9 133 pounds to start_ then lost 8 in 2 weeks because I could not eat). Mornings were especially bad_ feeling of throwing up_ sweating_ dizzy daily_ called in sick to work.  Felt like I had food poisoning the entire time I took it! Avoid this pill - please!,After not eating or sleeping for a week I called my doctor and told her about extreme weight loss_ and not able to function_ missing work_ and she told me to call her in 3 months!  What kind of medical school did she come from???  A woman's body is not a one-size-fits all hormone prescription_ which is what ANY pill offers.  The body types_ ages_ blood types_ life styles_ we're all different.  How can doctors expect us all to fit into a cookie cutter pill.  It's a recipe for disaster_ and the only people suffering are the women who are looking for relief_ NOT the doctors.  Take care of yourself and don't fall into this birth control trap that ultimately leads to poor physical and mental health.  Google anxiety attacks after STOPPING birth control.  The effects of this monster last long after your last pill. I still had problems eating 2 weeks AFTER stopping_ and continued to lose weight!  This stuff alters your body chemistry at such a low level_ it affects every body system_ not just controlling your period.,F,44,14  days10 1X D,9/21/2014,Aviane-28
31, 1, Pregnacy prevention,Horrible. I've always been a happy person. I can't even function through the day. I cry at the drop of a dime. One min I ok then I'm so mad and depressed. I hardly have a appetite and when I do think I'm hungry I can barley eat. I have a constant headache. My hands are swelling. I don't feel myself. I just want to shut the world away. I could barely keep it together when I called my doctors office to let them know I can't take it anymore. Please save yourself and never try this pill.,,F,23,2  weeks10,9/21/2014,Aviane-28
32, 1, Birth Control,The first 3-4 days were fine_ then I noticed an increased feeling of nervous feelings_ and started waking up at 3AM sweating. By the second week by 6PM felt physically shaky and couldn't wind down to sleep. Waking up every 2 hours although felt fatigued and exhausted. Woke up nauseated_ and head spinning every day. Called in sick couldn't drive 2 days_ then entire weekend. Missed my mom's 64th birthday_ my son's t-ball game_ and Parent teacher night as a result of the anxiety and shaky_ dizzy_ nausea all around bad physical health this pill gave me.,It's been two weeks after taking the last pill and this morning was the FIRST day I woke up and could eat a light breakfast and I only have minimal shakiness in my legs.  I put myself on a liver detox diet_ bought supplements to clean the synthetic chemicals out of my body that the pill put in for 9 days.  This stuff is evil if after only 9 days of taking it_ it takes your body 2 weeks of intense detox just to function- Not even feeling 100% yet.  Still have a tiny nervous feeling that hopefully will pass as I continue to detox.  If you want to quit the pill_ DEFINITELY look of detoxing your liver.  It's the only way to completely get rid of it's negative effects.  Thank God I found online how to get rid of excess estrogen_ and it has been making a slow but positive difference.,F,41,9  days10 1X D,9/20/2014,Aviane-28

34, 2, Birth control,Feeling of low blood sugar but cant eat_ nausea_anxiety! Headache all day long.,I had to buy a blood glucose monitor after taking this pill. I have taken serval other pill brands over the years and never had this side effect! What is this mess! Try having to poke yourself every morning because you wake up shaking and dizzy! I have never had eating disorders or blood sugar issues ever ever! Buyer beware! I will not be refilling my second pack. Hoping this can be reversed by quitting. This is so messed up. All I wanted was an easy birth control method. Think again!,F,28,21  days20 1X D,9/18/2014,Aviane-28
35, 1, Peri menopause symptoms,Estrogen dominance_ plus nausea_ hot flashes got more intense_ night sweats and waking_ anxiety anxiety anxiety_ shaking.,I wanted to start using progesterone cream for mild hot flashes I started getting. I didn't want to self medicate so I went to my doctor and asked if taking an OTC progesterone cream was ok. My very misguided and misinformed doctor told me since I still had my period I wasn't a candidate for progesterone cream!!! I swear that's what she said! Then she gave me a script for Aviane and said that would balance me!  This is how medical malpractice suits happen_ doctors who are just misinformed! I took the pill and it wrecked my health. My kids had to go to their grandparents because I couldn't get out of bed without throwing up and shaking.  I didn't sleep. Didn't eat. Ended up I ER and was told I had to stop the pills ASAP.  I thought I was dying. My husband missed 3 days of work. I am changing doctors! Now_ a week after quitting_ I am still suffering nausea_ dizzy_ anxiety_ and using progesterone cream to try to combat the synthetic estrogen that was dumped into me for 2 weeks. I am so much worse off now than before. It totally threw my body into a hormone hell that I can't dig out of. If you have peri menopause issues do not take this. You will regret it. I promise. My poor 2 yr old has been stck in front of the tv for weeks now because I am so dizzy and anxiety ridden I can't get off the couch. I am seeing a naturopath next week.

37, 1, Birth control,Acne_ fatigue_ nause! Headache_night mares _ sleep problems,If you want to have the same hormone issues as your teenage daughter -then take this pill! When I realized that women in their 40's are being given the same hormones prescribed to a 17yr old. I started to understand what a grave mistake I made by taking this pill. This threw me In to EXTREME estrogen dominance. I am still having a hard time getting back to normal weeks after.  I have to take progesterone cream just to stop my nervous panic attacks and headaches. I have only slept 10hrs in  a week. I am delirious_ anxiety ridden_ my family can't depend on me for anything now. One cycle of these pills caused so much turmoil. I am going to a holistic doctor next week. I can't suffer any longer. Ladies this is not the answer to per imenopause. your doctor does not understand hormones if you get this as an answer. It makes things worse. I am living out this physical and emotional hell right now. Don't do it! Throw your prescription away!,F,42,20  days10 1X D,9/17/2014,Aviane-28
38, 1, Birth control,Can't eat_ nausea_ shaky. Feels like I am constantly plugged in to electricity.,I quit this after having a nervous breakdown in my car. I used to be a happy normal gal_ now I am constantly sick_ no energy _no motivation even 5 days after last pill. This was more than I bargained for. Think twice_ the effects are long term after your last pill! This screws up your body's ability to balance hormones. How long to return to normal? This is nuts!,F,28,16  days10 1X D,9/16/2014,Aviane-28

Now I have become so tired_ haven't worked out in 2 wks since starting pill. Bleed daily_ nervous about everything. I have become a monster. This stole my health and life.

41, 1, Pre menopause balance,Insomnia_ can't eat_ nervous_ tense_ worse hot flashes. Magnified every problem I was trying to get rid of.,I read the other reviews saying they can't eat and now I know what that means. You are hungry_ low blood sugar even _ but  can't put food in your mouth and swallow. It's weird_ I am hungry and low energy but have to force food down. Also I wake every hour. Feel spacey in the morning then get nervous tension all day. No good!,F,43,10  days20 1X D,9/15/2014,Aviane-28
42, 1, Hormonal headache,Developed severe anxiety attacks_ never had before. Tremors_ vivid nightmares_ nausea_ inability to eat_ 3am wakings soaked in sweat and shaking.,At five days in I got very nervous_ started to have night wakings and night sweats. Doctor said keep taking it. At 10 days developed agoraphobia_ severe tremors_ couldn't eat. Called doctor and said to finish my pack! I quit that day_ but continue to have bleeding_ anxiety_ inabilitybo eat_ nausea 4 days later. There are no guidelines from the drug companies on WHAT happens when you QUIT. For hundreds of women who post online the side effects of the pill last for months or years after.   I pray that I didn't do permanent damage to my endocrine system. I am so sorry I ever took the first pill. I feel poisoned. Please love yourself enough to not take birth control pills. You will eventually stop_ and when you do all hell will break loose In your body and your doctor will act like they are clueless why you are suffering. This is bigger than not getting pregnant and there are other ways of hormone balance that may take longer but will work with your natural body. It's not worth the quick fix. This fix causes worse problems long term. Listen to the one star reviews. They are real women just like you. It can/ will happen. My life continues to be a living hell after only 10 days on this medication.,F,40,10  days10mg 1X D,9/14/2014,Aviane-28

The older you get the harder it is to recover from the side effects. Take this into consideration_and look at Vitex_ or black cohosh. Saliva test your hormones BEFORE trying things like birth control to create balance.  You have to have a baseline before throwing hormones into the mix. Your body and mind are gifts. Take care of them!,F,38,12  days10 mg 1X D,9/14/2014,Aviane-28

45, 1, Hormonal balance pms,Bleeding 11 days while on pill_extreme nervous_ hypothyroid symptoms after7 days_shaky_ nausea,My doctor suggested Aviane to balance my hormones. You start taking it on day one of your period.  My periods were fine. Five days long every 28 days. On Aviane I bled every day I took it - Full on period 11 days with no sign of stopping. At day five I became super irritable and felt like I was on caffeine. Every day got more intense. I actually started getting worse hot flashes than ever. Dizzy_ sick. I finally couldn't get off the couch to take my son to school and called the doctor.  She told me to KEEP taking it for 3 months! Really??? I was one step from the ER from not eating and not being able to stand up! I didn't take last nights dose but it was still the worst night of my life. Soaked in sweat_ shaking_ dry heaves_ I prayed for morning and time to pass to get these hormones out! This morning after no sleep my bleeding is minimal and I am able to eat toast_ and stopped shaking. I have a few hot flashes and dizzy still but saw a few websites saying after 48 hours it should go away. My advice is if you start having unbearable side effects stop right away. Don't delay stopping.  Get the hormones out of your body ASAP.. It gets worse not better. Some minor effects will resolve. But my symptoms were debilitating. Know when to quit. I am again unable to drive today and can't take  care of my kids as a result of 11days on his pill. Use caution and your womanly instincts to know if this is a fit for you.  For some it is_but not for me.,F,42,11  days10mcg 1X D,9/12/2014,Aviane-28
46, 1, To prevent pregnancy,Have had break through bleeding after the first week_ I am now on my last week of the pill for the first month taking it.. Ive had severe bouts of depression and feel nasty since the spotting doesnt stop. It makes me have mild cramps for the past two weeks.. Also had a bout of constipation that lasted 5 days an when I went bled. Never in my life experienced that. My mood is horrible/  get pissy/ feel like crying_ not talking_ an push people away_ when typically Im not emotional an Im a very happy person. Loss of concentration an affects my daily life and work. Feel sick to my stomach an not eating very much. Never felt like this on any other birth control an as horrible as the side affects have been my doctor recomends me to continue to take it for the first three months.

47, 2, Birth Control_ PMS_ Bad Cramps,The medication at first gave me mild nausea (which only happened to occur between 3-4 hours after taking the pill)_ and slight headaches. When I first took it_ I bled for almost an entire month_ due to it being an ultra low dose pill. Plus_ it did nothing to help with the PMS symptoms I was experiencing_ heavy bleeding_ or bad menstrual cramps. I stayed on the pill nonetheless. The mild nausea eventually subsided for the most part_ and the only time I would experience such is when starting a new pack_ during the first couple of pills taken from the new pack. Overall_ I didn't really experience any major stomach issues while taking this pill_ which at least I was thankful for as I do have a sensitive stomach and alot of pills don't agree with my stomach at all. I did put on more than 10 pounds of extra weight after taking these pills and I did not like that. So_ yes_ I do believe that birth control pills do contribute to weight gain.

My Doctor was concerned_ so I'm off of it now. I had my period 4 times in a 28 day cycle with one day breaks in between_ I got head aches all the time and have had trouble sleeping. I started having constant yeast and bacterial infections_ on this pill.

I had about six stabbing headaches in one day_ but I ignored them since a hurricane was going on_ figuring it was just the barometric pressure.  That Monday I went to class and the stroke symptoms struck in the middle of lecture and I had to go to the health center.  Once I got off of it_ for fear that I was going to have a full-blown stroke_ it took a month of steroids to reduce the headache so I could actually function again.

I never had any problems with Aranelle_ I just decided to switch to a low estrogen pill and this is what my doctor perscribed me. I took Aviane for 4 days and had no side effects. Then on the evening of teh 5th day_ I felt unusually exhausted and got a migraine headache. I had flown on an airplane that day and thought maybe I just got some motion sickness_ so I took the pill as usual and went to sleep. The next morning I was dizzy_ exhausted_ nauseous_ and I had no appetite. My symptoms continued all day and by the evening of the 6th day_ I was vomiting painfully and could hardly stand up. That night I discontinued taking the medication_ and was still sick and vomiting the next morning. It was not for about 48 hours after taking my last dosage that I regained and appetite_ my headache went away_ and I began to be able to eat and sleep normally again.

The most important thing to me though was about the bleeding because my was very_ very heavy. It did lighten my period_ but not enough really. Also I still had cramps_ though not as painful_ but I still had them. One of the biggest problems I had with this was the increased appetite. Over the months taking it_  I gained 20 pounds. It scared me to death because all my life I've been thin and could eat anything I wanted without gaining weight_ and now I was having problem squeening into my shorts. I was always wanting food and craving eating (even when I wasn't really hungry). I went up a cup size_ though I didn't really mind that. I also was over-sleeping_ but don't know exactly that Aviane effected my sleep or not because I've had sleeping issues all my life_ but I was always tired and sometimes sleeping up to 13 hours a night and then still felt like I needed to take a nap. In a month I will probably switch to a new bc because even though it does help_ it doesn't help enough and the side effects aren't worth it.,F,16,5  months28 1X D,7/10/2011Email,Aviane-28

Lots of them and won't go away!!!!,Before I go on with the bad things_ Aviane is the best birth control pill to reduce heavy flow during period. Simply the best! But for the first two or three months_ you will have spotting during the second week. But it went away now. Also_ I don't have any cramps or pain during this time. Really awesome.But with the best_ comes the worst! I was on Necon for years but I never had any of the side effects from taking Aviane. I gained a few pounds after taking Aviane. I don't want to have sex anymore. I bloat all the time not just a week before period. I am very emotional and snap about anything. And worst of all_ I have acne all over my face!!! And they won't go away. I have one on my cheek that was there a month ago and one on my forehead almost the size of a dime! And it was there two weeks ago. I am ashamed to go to work as I work with the public. I used to have flawless skin and now_ i feel like a monster. I am very disappointed with Aviane in this aspect.

Went from semi normal emotionally to severely psychotic- depression_ anxiety_ thoughts of suicide_ etc. I chalked it up to marriage jitters. I suffered for about a year after that before I read something about BC causing mental problems so I stopped the pill altogether. A month later I started Aviane because I was paranoid I'd get prego. Miraculously the bad thoughts and depression/anxiety disappeared within 2 months.  The downside is my skin is HORRIBLE since I started this pill. I had flawless skin on orthro tri LO_ but I will take zits over fantasizing about putting a gun in my mouth any day. If you struggle with depression I'd give this pill a try.

No weight gain.,I got on this BC in June 2009 then stopped using it October 2009.  My body would not adjust to it and I got tired of having 2 periods a month (perhaps one of those was the breakthrough bleeding) but it was heavy so I considered it a second period (or my real period since it was low hormone...not sure).  The first month_ I was an emotional wreck- cried from just about everything.  The good thing is that it did not last long.  It definitely cleared up my skin and did not cause any weight gain.  I started using it again (had packs left over from last time) in June 2010 and July 2010 and it actually started working (no multiple periods).  So I am not sure_ perhaps my body needed those 4 months to fully adjust to it.  Now I am on Levora-28 so we will see how that one goes.

I was always irritable to the littlest things. I will admit_ it did help me with my growth in my breast : ). Within that first month on the second week (2nd week_ 2nd pill)_ it gave me my very first yeast infection. I had very bad vaginal dryness that was very uncomfortable. I went on an over-the-counter treatment that cleared it within 3 days. The second month came a long and my period was 3 days late. My sex drive decreast ALOT. Was turned off by anything sexual a guy said to me and it only made me angry with them. Again just like the first month (2nd week_ 2nd pill) i got another yeast infection. Did not want to take the pills anymore due to the fact i was getting yeast infections; therefore i stopped taking the pills all together and since then i havent had any more infections.

160, 3, birth control,Anything that would normally bother me just a little bothers me a ton when I'm on Aviane. I want to start crying at little things. I want to sleep and have no energy. I feel disconnected and just out of it most the time.,,F,21,2  months,5/14/2009,Aviane-28
161, 3, birth control,depression_ cry easily_ moodiness_ severe fatigue_ loss of sex drive,Was OK at first_ experienced all of the symptoms at first but chalked it up to wedding planning_ etc. Got home from the honeymoon and still was depressed_ tired all the time and not interested in sex_ not a great way to start a marriage. Think I'm going to try going off and see how I feel..,F,33,1  years,3/7/2009,Aviane-28
162, 4, birth control,breakthrough bleeding_ possible weight gain_ mood changes,Overall_ I never had any major problems with Aviane. I've got breakthrough bleeding from time to time_ but nothing worth changing pills for. There was also a slight increase in my sensitivity_ since I tend to cry more now. Never got any headaches or nothing though_ so I'm pretty satisfied.,F,18,9  months,2/23/2009,Aviane-28

164, 2, Control Periods,mood swings_ weight gain_ swollen breasts,This medicine made me crazy. I am normally a very level-headed rational person_ but during my time on the pill I got into fights with two of my friends and nearly broke up with my boyfriend and I would cry myself to sleep at night. I also gained about 15 lbs. I'm an athlete_ so I'm almost 100% sure this was due to the Aviane. Still working to take the extra weight off...,F,21,2  months,1/27/2009,Aviane-28
165, 5, Prevent pregnancy,Slight nausea and headaches in the beginning.,I love Aviane have had no problems with it. I took it for a year a few years ago then recently started taking it again. Excellent pills minimal side effects. Very effective at preventing pregnancy. Going off of it to try Junel 1/20 for shorter periods. Everyones body reacts different to everything so before basing your final decision on reviews try it for yourself! Hope this helps.,F,21,2  years,10/31/2008,Aviane-28
166, 3, acne_ pregnancy prevention,Extreme decrease in libido after giving it 4-6 months to work properly. May have attributed to wieght gain_ but was taking other medications. I was able to lose the wieght though.,Did not cause breakthrough bleeding like many other oral contraceptive brands.  Helped clear up acne.,F,28,1  years,10/16/2008,Aviane-28
167, 5, birth control_ period regulation,severe acne_ weight gain,I've gained about 20lbs and counting since I started taking this medicine and I started to have severe acne. Working out 5 days a week and eating less is not helping the weight gain_ but proactiv is helping the acne. I've never had acne in my life before this_ not even as a teenager.,F,25,1  years,9/29/2008,Aviane-28
168, 1, endometriosis_ menstrual cramps,Very bad heart palpatations_ fatigue_ insomnia in the beginning and some gastro problems.,I took Alesse and Levlite which were not generic and tolerated them much better. You can no longer get this pill formulation in the US_ so it has been very difficult for me to find a pill which I can tolerate. Went off the pill for a few months and ended up in the Emergency Room with such bad pelvic pain I couldn't stand it anymore. Had to go back on the pill because of this bad ovulation pain and painful periods.,F,47,3  months,8/28/2008,Aviane-28
169, 4, Contraception_ regulation,A little bit more acne_ a few moodswings_ sometimes breakthru bleeding.,This is by far the most tolerable pill I've ever taken. Everything else has sucked majorly!,F,21,6  months,8/25/2008,Aviane-28
170, 5, Regulate Period,Leg pain (no blood clots). Decreased appetite at the beginning (not complaining_ especially since the prior pill caused a 30 pound weight gain in 4 months).  Light/short periods (no complaints there_ either),Love this pill.  The minor leg cramping I get with it is nothing compared to the excruciating migraines I get when I'm not on some form of hormone regulating pill.,,,8  years,7/12/2008,Aviane-28
171, 5, prevent pregnacy,Some breast tenderness_ light cramps.,Ive been on 5 or 6 different birth controls and this one causes the least side effects for me.  I highly suggest trying it for anyone who tends to experience side effects from birth control.,F,26,1  years,6/30/2008,Aviane-28
172, 2, Birth Control,Significant irritability_ weight gain_ and slight decrease in sex drive.,While I expected to gain a little weight with the taking of a BCP_ I have been unable to lose the 15 lbs I gained. But foremost_ I found myself crying at every little thing.  I think I cried more in the past 6 months than I had in 10 years!!  I gave it more than an adequate time for my body to adjust to the hormones_ but it is getting worse! An appt has been made with my MD to switch!!,F,34,9  months,6/5/2008,Aviane-28
173, 5, birth control,moody during first week of active pills,i LOVE this pill. I was on it before I could afford what has been a battle with yaz and loestrin and have returned.  The side effects were nothing compared to the other 2.,F,24,1  years,4/2/2008,Aviane-28
174, 3, prevent pregnancy/no period,very irritable_ mood swings,I take BC to skip my cycles. I take three weeks and start over when period is supposed to come. This worked well for a while with enpresse but my hair started shedding. I read that others had the same problem with enpresse so I switched to this. Just started taking this pill 4 days ago. I've noticed a lighter appetite_ actually very light. My breasts are tender_ and feel kinda swollen. I did notice that Saturday night and sunday I was really agitated and snappy. I'm even tempered today and feel a little tired but not irritable. It's early yet as i'm on my first week. I'll keep taking it and see how it goes. Will update.,F,30,4  days,2/25/2008,Aviane-28
175, 1, Birth Control,severe acne_ mood swings_ anger_ weight gain_ irregular periods_ breakthrough bleeding_ severe headaches.,This pill is absolutely horrible.  I have never had a problem with acne until taking this pill.  Prior to this pill_ I weighed 102 pounds_ now I can't fit into my clothes_ I must have gained at least 15 pounds in 5 months.  Also_ I have bouts of anger and irritability_ whereas I've always been known as happy and easy going.  I plan on getting off this so my periods stabilize and I can get a copper IUD.  This pill is not worth the side effects.,F,35,5  months,11/10/2007,Aviane-28
176, 3, birth control,Increased Acne!,I never had a problem with acne until I took this pill. That was the only problem I had with this pill. Everything else was fine. No weight gain_ no cramps_ and short and light periods. This pill would've ben great if it didn't give me acne.,F,23,4  months,8/29/2007,Aviane-28

179, 4, perimenopausal,breakthrough bleeding_ must take at same time daily within an hour or two.,I went on this birth control after giving birth to twins at 44 (i am now 50 and have not experienced menopause yet) and experiencing heavy (two week) periods.  I had been on a stronger pill most of my adult life until trying to get pregnant and had virtually no periods for many years prior to getting pregnant.   This pill was very successful in reducing my period flow and time_ and improving mood swings_ although i continue to have water weight gain for a week or two monthly.  Breakthrough bleeding appeared to be the only major side effect but it was far more desirable to have light breakthrough bleeding than extremely heavy periods each month. I did not notice any weight gain attributable to this pill.,F,50,5  years,6/10/2007,Aviane-28
180, 1, ,,I've only taken this pill for a month. While on it I've already had my period 2 weeks straight on the ACTIVE pills. I'm taking this so that I don't get my period for 3 months_ but guess that didn't work. I'm thinking of switching because I've been VERY depressed and have had horrible mood swings on this pill since I pretty much started. It also made my face break out pretty bad.,F,21,1  months,5/16/2007,Aviane-28
181, 2, Genric Brand for Lev-Lite,I have been on Aviane for about a year and have experienced weight gain of about 10 lbs.I have horrible mood swings and bloating about 2 1/2 weeks up until my period. I am bloated most of the time and my breasts have increased in size. I also get migraine headaches either before or after my period and they last for about 5 days or less.,I exercise and manage a very healthy diet and am shocked to be experiencing side effects to this degree. I would like to go back onto Levline_ as I did not have these types of side effects on this  pill.,F,32,1  years,5/5/2007,Aviane-28
