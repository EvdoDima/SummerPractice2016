0, 2, Chronic cough/asthma,Aggression_ mood changes_ anxiety_ chest pains.,It took me a couple weeks to realize why I had become such an angry_ aggressive person. My family noticed how different I was acting. Finally I realized it had to be the inhaler. It was the only medication I was on and had just started taking shortly before my mood changes began. I also had really scary chest pains that truly felt like I was having a heart attack. The medication did help my cough significantly so I'm really disappointed that it had such terrible side effects. I talked to my dr about these side effects and he claimed those types of side effects would be extremely rare. Well_ apparently not that rare! Within 2 days of stopping use_ I had a normal mood again. It's not a coincidence.,F,28,3  weeks,7/13/2016Email,Flovent

3, 1, asthma/allergy,headaches_ racing heart_ paranoia_ anxiety_ schizophrenia_ hallucinations_ moody_ stomach pains_ night terrors,I do not recommend this medication. My daughter has always been pleasant and happy go lucky. She was put on this medication to control her asthma and seasonal allergies. She began having night terrors and hallucination of a man in all black chasing her. She became very moody and aggressive towards everybody. She was very anxious.  Her symptoms got to the point where she did not want to be alone at any given point. She was also on other medications for her asthma as well and after slowly discontinuing one medication at a time this was the last medication that she was on so I conclude that this is the medication that was affecting her. Especially after reading how she was experiencing the same symptoms as other children around her age.,F,11,2  months44 mcg 2X D,6/28/2016,Flovent
4, 3, Asthma,Irritated throat_ itchy skin_ gerd,It helped my lungs I think_ but I started getting side effects of itchy skin and sore throat immediately  upon use and I always rinse my mouth_ and brush my teeth.

I started her on it to get through spring allergies last week. Yesterday she told me she didn't want to be alive. Today the school called because she broke down and told them she was hearing voices from under the ground telling her not to believe in God and that she should come underground with them. Thank God for this site. I suspected the steroid when her usually happy behavior changed but now I know for certain the drug caused a psychotic episode.

9, 4, Mild asthma,Been on Flovent for almost a year on and off works better when u take breaks I'll be on it for 3 months then go off it until I start getting symptoms again then go back on it . Unfortunately too many side effects I get headaches and blood pressure goes up so make sure to exercise while on this medicine as you can gain weight. And don't consume too much sodium while on this medicine as it already raised blood pressure also it interferes with my menstrual cycle while I'm on it it hardly comes. I also get nightmares as well as blurry vision best to monitor your vision while on this medication as it can cause glaucoma if used long term. These are things I have experience while on this medication as well as dizzines and feeling lightheaded also mood swings I would get moody while on this medicine as well as sadness and extreme fatigue tingling of the feet and legs as well. Also changes in my blood work while on this drug but as soon as I would stop the medicine my bloodwork would go back to normal.also pain in the stomach and abdominal area as well as pelvic pain.,If you are going to take this medicine please work with your doctor to monitor your symptoms and keep track of all side effects so he can adjust your medication accordingly. Everyone reacts different but this is how my body reacted to it. But it does help with my asthma and I get hardly if any attacks at all while on Flovent hfa 110 mcg.,F,29,3  months110mcg,12/16/2015,Flovent

I always thought they were so crazy and could not believe that anybody would ever really experience such bizarre effects.  Well I stand corrected.  Never filled out something like this before but just had to add my two cent's worth to the discussion.  This drug is making my life very different and I am only now connecting the dots.  I have every intention of stopping this drug today and I will be very curious to see how my life changes.  I cannot believe how adversely this drug has affected me.  I am usually immune to all the side effects and actually don't even bother reading the ""enclosed leaflet"" which goes into great length to describe what MIGHT happen on this drug.  I just didn't think it could happen to me BUT now I know that I am not immune - not to this drug.

11, 1, Asthma,My son has been on Flovent for 2 months for his asthma. He's always been a great kid_ never any tantrums or behavior issues. Over the past month_ we have noticed heightened anxiety_ tics (clenching and unclenching his fists to relieve anxiety)_ OCD tendencies_ inability to cope with the smallest frusterations_ tantrums and anger. I couldn't figure out where this behavior was coming from_ given that there have been no other changes in his life and he has a great day to day stress free environment.

On my normal doseage(440 mcg daily) I experience NO side effects at all.,This inhaler has improved my quality of life immensely. I have not had an attack in 15+ years because of being on Flovent.

After 3 collapsed lungs and a diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome_ this was a test trial in an attempt to raise my lung capacity to that of a person my age. I am already underweight_ but have lost about 5 pounds on this medication (this is a lot_ considering my weight doesn't fluctuate more than a pound). I also find the medicine to be useless without the use of a 'spacer'_ as this helps get the most concentration of medicine.

But side effects like most drugs are brutal and barely worth it. I was lucky enough to study physiology at university in New Zealand and start my own holistic health and fitness company in California_ where my studies have led me to control my asthma 100% with nutrition (paleolithic diet basically with some supplementation). I wish someone had informed me about the effectiveness of ancestral nutrition when I was a child_ but better late than never.

At the time I figured the anger problems were terrible twos and fact she was sick every 3 weeks with a virus. Behavior became so extreme I took her to child psychologist to be evaluated. All doctors we saw said it couldn't be the Flovent because it was such a low dose steroid. I was distraught and desperate when she started hearing voices so I frantically searched Internet and found this site. Thank god!! Once I read the posts_ I weaned her off it over a week period.  She's been off for 5 weeks now and is a totally different kid.  She's the sweet_ happy kid she used to be. The anger and agitation_ violent talk_ tantrums are gone.

35, 1, Reactive Airway(Viral/cold induced),"I noticed my son was more emotional and aggressive after 2 weeks on Flovent (2puffs once per day) but assumed it was the terrible two's setting in.  By week three on the drug_ he escalated to erratic behavior_ emotional outbursts_ grinding his teeth during the day_ 6 tantrums per day_ screaming incessantly_ bizarre hehavior_ repeated hitting_ and he completely regressed after being successfully potty trained for over 3 months.  In my heart I knew this wasn't my son_ but still thought he was going through a phase.  I realized the only change that was going on in his life was the Flovent and googled ""Flovent side effects"" and found this page and other posts outlining the same issues.  I am so grateful for this website.  I immediately called my pediatrician who knows this is out of character for my son and he agreed it was a side effect and recommended weaning him to 1 puff for 3 to 5 days and stopping it completely.  He suggested Advair_ but after this experience_ I am going to",My son was hospitalized with bronchiolitis at 5 months_ RSV at 7 months and then we had to use albuterol for wheezing most times he had a cold from then on_ and used a short dosage of prednisone on a few occasions.  My pediatrician recommended trying pulmicort as a preventative_ however we we did not do it_ and were lucky because my son only had croup twice between 1 and 2 years (we did pull him out of daycare and had relatives to come in our home to watch him)  He had 2 colds this summer with no issues_ but then when he started daycare and a toddler program this fall_ He had another cold that led to wheezing and prednisone_ so we decided to try Flovent at the recommendation of our pediatrician.  He is 2.5 and took it for 3 weeks and it had bad side effects.

My asthma has mostly been a problem because of allergies where I live and when I get on the track to run. The effects of this drug were immediate. I felt like I was on some kind of speed_ but not going fast. I felt spacey_ disoriented. Even as I type this_ I am dazed and have lost some of my voice. I have only been on this for a few days.

NEWS FLASH...that is normal behavior for children_ whether we like it or not.  My daughter has been grinding her teeth since she was 6 months old. By the way_ many children grind their teeth. I work in dental field and it's common knowledge. Parents may want to look into other reasons for the sudden erratic behavior. Also_ growth has not been as issue either.  I am not trying to minimize parental observations but I do believe that sometimes_ we as parents_ tend exxagerate.  I see it ever day!!!,My daughter was hospitalized for 5 days when she was 2 years old and then for 3 additional days six months later.  We were already using the nebulizer after her first episode which was pretty much useless.  After they prescibed flovent_ she has been stable and her catching a cold is less scary now.

He used to be the most laid back child and I just recently started putting 2 and 2 together and realized that this medication is making him CRAZY!! He will throw the biggest tantrums ever just at the spur of the moment.  He is very clingy and when he goes into these tantrums there is NOTHING i can do to control him.  At first I thought it was just terrible 3's but I recently weened him off of flovent after reading this page and his personality completely changed and he is back to the mild mannered laid back child he once was.

She is not medicated for those conditions.I found a great blog on squidoo.com under Cough Variant Asthma. The creator of the blog is spot on about medication and treatments.

Read the insert that comes with the medication.  The so-called clinical trials are usually short - term and on a small group of people (especially children).  I feel sorry for the younger kids who can't tell anyone how they feel and are put on more medications (i.e. ADHD meds)  because the doctors refuse to acknowledge side effects of the meds they prescribe.,M,7,4  months44 mcg 2X D,6/2/2012,Flovent

When i expressed my concerns about the medication with his ped. she looked at me as if i had 6 eyes.  She expressed that if i didnt want my son hospitalized again i would give him the flovent. BS! I suggested trying to better control his seasonal allergies instead of a serious condition that HE DOES NOT HAVE. I am happy to say he is now off the flovent_ and donig fine.

Was able to take her off  for a year_ then recommended by ped. To go bk on as a preventive since she had a very bad asthma attack which landed her back in hospital for 3 days. Since she has been back on it she has Been very clingy_ moody_ crying spells in the morning and at night. Irritable_ very similar to other posts.

I had been taking Advair for a few years on the lowest dose_ and was well controlled most often 1 puff a day_ 2 puffs sometimes during allergy season_ and no noticeable side effects. When I switched to Flovent 110mcg_ I had to take 2 puffs 2x a day to intially control my asthma with the change in medication. Within days_ I couldn't fit into my clothes. I jog regularly_ do yoga_ ride my bike everywhere_ hike_ rock climb_ and I eat really well. After eventually reducing to once a day_ I lost most of that initial bloating_ but am still holding on to pounds unexplained by diet and exercise program and I need my fast-acting inhaler up to 5 times a day_ more when I exercise. When I take Flovent twice a day_ I immediately bloat and struggle to fit in my clothes. I've had new allergic reactions to food_ random palpitations_ throat swelling- none of which happened on Advair. I just added in Salmeterol to see if that allows me to feel better on once a day Flovent_ but the Dr. recommends upping the steroid dose if it doesn't. My ultimate goal is to decrease my steroid doseage_ so I might see about getting on Flovent 44 and using it twice a day with Salmeterol. And if none of that works_ I might just have to throw in the cash for Advair_ which worked for years with no ill effects.,F,25,5  months110 1X D,4/15/2012,Flovent

But after more pressure from his doctor_ I decided to try it. I only gave him ONE PUFF (44 mcg) yesterday morning. Throughout the day he was OK_ maybe a little bit more clingy and easily irritable. BUT_ as soon as the night started_ he woke up each hour SOBBING_ inconsolable. This is SO unlike my son. He almost never complains and never cries. For example_ he was just teething all of his molars_ all while having a bad cold_ and he still slept through the whole night_ never crying. Last night (after having had only ONE PUFF of the Flovent) he had the worst night of his life. He is never inconsolable_ but he was last night. He would wake each hour SOBBING for 45 minutes_ until we could console him back to sleep. Then he would wake up again shortly after. It was HORRENDOUS.

Recently_ my old friends premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) started acting up. I had had a lot of problems with Albuterol years ago causing these_ so I was quick to suspect  the bronchodilator in Advair and asked to switch to a corticosteroid only_ so doctor put me on Flovent Discus 100. Since I sing_ I asked to switch to the aerosol (Hfa). It does a good job with the bronchial inflammation_ but every time I use it_ i soon get a mild nausea. My PVCs have not really gone away_ and I have been anxious and depressed. My back muscles ache at times and i feel it around in front. A heating pad on my back helps. I'm pretty active and never feel short of breath when exercising_ but usually cough afterward  My allergist had me use Spiriva for 10 days and then I am to switch to Symbicort. I am now in quite a rough spot and am both afraid of inhalers and craving them to relieve my asthma symptoms. It is really frustrating.,M,46,1  months110mcg 2X D,3/7/2011,Flovent

The worst was the insane temper tantrums but the sleeplessness has been a nightmare as well. He can stay up until 11pm and then be up again at 2am for hours. He is agitated_ violent_ restless_ poor appetite. He was also started on singulair for EE and we stopped that thinking it was causing the side effects but he was still bad so we stopped the flovent as well. The side effects all went away.

I once took him off the medication_ due to insurance issues but he was put back on it once that was resolved and he had had a serious asthma attack (most times ending with a 2 day stint in the local childrens hospital with breathing treatments and many doses of prednisone.) He has since not had any asthma attacks in the past 3 years. I NEVER attributed his behavior with this medicine I just assumed he's a little boy_ he's active and rambunctious_ but after reading so many of these posts I feel like I am reading the story of my son's life on Flovent. He has had a difficult time in school_ with repeated phone calls from teachers stating he is restless in his seat_ gets distracted easily and is quickly angered.

We had definite reservations about using anything this year but he had pneumonia 3 times last year and ended up at the hospital. We have seen some aggression from him and moodiness. I read the fine print of the pamphlet which says that they tested Flovent on 56 pediatric patients-that is not a lot for a study. The fine print does say""agitation_ aggression_ anxiety_ depression_ and restlessness. Behavioral changes_ including hyperactivity and irritability have been reported very rarely and primarily in children.""

I then weaned down to 110mg 1 puff 1x a day. I sometimes now skip the second puff. I was being over medicated on Flovent and had weight gain and a whole plethora of issues.

I also begun having heart palpitations/tachycardia_ nightmares_ and severe anxiety while on the 110mg 2x a day regimen.

Here is an update.,I took my daughter off of Flovent (and Singulair) after finding this site and she still experienced coughing/throwing up episodes at nighttime and no wheezing at all (2x throughout June). Since she had this while on the medicine_ and had it off the medicine_ I concluded that it's something more to this then just asthma and I took her to a pediatric pulmonologist. She did an asthma breathing test (and did FANTASTIC!) and I asked if this could be acid reflux in addition to her asthma. The doc said he doubts she even has asthma_ and said we'd try acid reflux medicine and see if that helps any. And guess what? Over the past month and a half she's had AMAZING breathing_ NO coughing_ NO throwing up at ALL while on the acid reflux medicine! Her quality of life has improved greatly since stopping Flovent and Singulair.

I've been told he has a mild case of asthma due to allergies. 2 weeks ago he had a couple of coughing fits that ended with him vomiting. Dr. prescribed flovent. Twice a day_ 2 puffs at a time. The coughing went away within days as did his constant runny nose_ but I started to notice changes in his behavior. He was more emotional_ more sensitive. Would cry more for silly things. Always a great eater_ his appetite began to wane. He's started to sleep less by small increments and today I noticed slight bags under his little eyes and the last 2 days he hasn't napped which had happened before on a few occasions but he would always make up for the nap by waking up later in the morning. Not the case this time. The icing was the pants wetting. as often as 3 times during the day_ completely out of character for him. I was aware of the issues with steroids and had planned to wean him off the medication beginning next week but after reading all of these comments I'm simply taking him off of it. It worked wonderfully for his cough but I do not like the side effects and at his age he can't properly vocalize let alone understand what he's feeling and I don't think it's fair to him.,M,40,14  days88 2X D,6/28/2010Email,Flovent

All these posts Ive read on children mirror behaviors my daughter has had for the past year and a half.,My daughter was diagnosed at age 2 with asthma_ and started flovent 6 months after her original diagnosis (after being on oral steroids 2x a month). It has helped with her wheezing and coughing_ but the behavioral issues as she's gotten older have become too much. I miss my sweet girl and want her back! Her asthma is allergy related and she's had adenoid gland surgery to help with her nasal drainage. She's also on Singulair granules_ I give it to her every other night (not nightly as prescribed). I didn't notice too much behavioral issues when she started the singulair a year ago_ that too helped with her coughing/throwing up episodes at nighttime. After her adenoid gland surgery and allergy tests she started allergy drops (which have helped her allergies A LOT!) and this past January 2010 I put a tower air purifier in her bedroom and started her on Omega 3-6-9 supplements. She's only had one issue with coughing/throwing up at night.

About 2 weeks into the 4 weeks that I gave him the mediction his personality changed. He has always be a playful boy_ always wanting to do something. After about two weeks he would lay on the sofa whether there were cartoons on or not. He never wanted to go out and play. He didnt really play with the kids in daycare. He began going backwards with potty training by having more accidents. When someone would try to talk to him_ he would just stand there and look at the floor and even after a person would stop talking to him he would still stand there in a daze. The final sign was when he started sleeping during the day in school. He has always been a good nighttime sleeper. I am wary about giving children medication_ so I knew it was the Flovent. I immediately took him off the medication and called his physician. She promised me as she did when she perscribed it to him_ that those side effects cannot be from the medication because the studies dont show that. I said I dont care what the studies show_ I know there is something wrong and that medication is the only factor. He has now been on regular allergy medication (singular) for about 6 months and is doing great. Within a few days his personality came back. He returned to his normal playful self.

Our 7-year-old sons teachers usually describe him as polite and even a joy to have in class. Today they said that within the past month this has sometimes changed to defiant and rude. At home weve noticed he was more volatile (quick to extreme anger or tears.) The other day his sister seemed to get more ice cream than him  he immediately exploded into tears of rage and banged his elbow on the counter so violently that it is now bruised and swollen. I was shocked and horrified. Yesterday some neighborhood kids angered him so he came in to get a kitchen knife! Thankfully his mother saw this and intervened. At first I thought maybe it was the allergies_ the trees here started pollinating a month or so ago.

He exhibited trouble sleeping_ getting along with other children_ anger_ aggression_ agitation_ inability to remember things_ confusion_ and hyperactivity.  We had notes home from his teacher indicting an inability to integrate into the classroom.  I also noticed that he was losing weight.  The behavioral changes were a severe change from his pre-Flovent behavior.  After taking him off Flovent for a day and half_ I am beginning to see my loving son again.,Be very cautious about using this Flovent inhaler.  It adversely affects the adrenals which are crucial to handling the body's stresses.,M,5,45  days110 2X D,2/17/2010,Flovent

Five to ten minutes after her first dose (2 puffs) she reported having a headache in the front/forehead portion of her head.  As far as I know_ she's never had a headache. She then started to get a low-grade fever of about 99.8.  She became very irritable and could not sleep during the night. Her behaviour was very strange. She couldn't stay still_ kept moving her lips and face.  My wife stayed up with her for the night and she (my daughter) eventually did sleep_ but was talking in her sleep a lot.  In the morning my daughter was fine_ symptoms gone.  No more Flowvent for us.,F,5,1  days44 MCG 4X D,2/14/2010Email,Flovent
121, 1, have patients who take it,nocturia_ behaviour change,I saw comments from other users. Behaviour change in children and nocturia are recognised systemic side effects of all steroids. The problem here is that Flovent_ as an inhaled steroid_ should not be exhibiting these side effects as it is supposed to be rapidly metabolised after it enters the circulation from the lungs. It is a very fat soluble drug hence the body's problem getting rid of it and these side effects.,M,57,1  days200mcg 2X D,2/10/2010Email,Flovent
122, 3, My son was taking it for asthma,My 3 year old son was having cough issues.  He had just started going to daycare and was getting a cough every two weeks_ and it would last for almost 2 weeks.  Yep_ he was constantly coughing.  The doctor described the Flovent inhaler and we did see improvements in his cough.  However_ his personality completely changed.  He was irritable_ to the point where it seemed like he could not control his emotions.  He was constantly wired_ would lose his temper at the drop of a hat_ and just wasn't the happy boy he was prior to the medicine.,Although we did have improvements with his coughing_ his behavior seemed to change.  He became very anxious_ a bit compulsive (always picking his nails) and was losing his temper about very small things.  He would wake up early and be wired immediately.  His personality changed_ where he couldn't sit still and just seemed over the top.  It became even worse_ where we couldn't handle his personality any more.  We took him to the doctor_ switched to the diskus Flovent (an inhaled powder) last week_ and I'm happy to report our boy is back.  He's much more mellow_ no longer picks his nails_ and he's sleeping better as well.  He no longer loses control of his emotions_ and if he does get upset (he's only 4...it happens)_ is able to get under control immediately.  The doctor theorizes there may be something in the additives used in the Flovent inhaler that doesn't exist in the diskus.  The diskus requires a little more coordination to take_ but it's well worth it with my boy now so much better than he was.Flovent has helped his cough_ but I truly believe the inhaler was having a big impact on his personality.  If possible_ try the diskus Flovent to see if it helps your child.  I hope you see the same improvements we have_ as the past week has been so much more enjoyable.  Good luck.,M,38,1  years,2/1/2010Email,Flovent
123, 4, My son has ashmatic cough,Constant feeling that he needs to urinate,"Previously our son was on Flonase (same ingredient as Flovent) and had the same side effect. Dr. looked at me as if I had 2 heads when I reported that to him. The feeling stopped as soon as we stopped Flonase and came back after about 5 days on FLovent 100mg_ once a day. We decreased to 50 mg and the problem went away for about 10 days_ but last night complained again. His cough is VERY WELL controlled at such a low dose and I am trying now 50mg every other day_ so we'll see. I was releived to read other kids had the ""need to urinate all the time"" side effect_ I may not be that crazy after all! If Flovent controls your child's asthma well_ try a lower dose_ and a lot of side effects could disappear_ talk to your doctor about it. I can't believe so many young children (under 4) are prescribed Flovent. It's safety has not been established for that age group.",M,6,15  days,1/24/2010,Flovent
124, 1, virus/allergy induced asthma,poor and interrupted sleep_ irritability_ loss of appetite_ aggression_ temper tantrums_ hyperactivity_,My son was prescribed flovent by our pediatrician last year when he was 2 ( I didn't realize that it was not supposed to be given to children under 4!) I was concerned as it is a steroid and so I did not use it at all. This last fall he turned 3 and we had another emergency dr appt due to excessive wheezing. The ped asked if I was still on the Flovent twice/day and I said no- He encouraged me to give it twice/day. We started 3 months ago and immediately noticed signs although we did not think that it was Flovent we just thought that he had turned 3. He lost his naps which used to be 2-3 hours_ he started waking up at 5 in the morning and having fits and biting_ throwing toys and he turned into a child that we did not even recognize. This turned out house upside down! My husband suggested that it might be Flovent and so I looked online and found this site! We stopped 4 days ago and he had his first nap again yesterday and is starting to be the smiling angel that we knew before!- we will never give him this again- I am mad as I have been angry at our son at times for not going to bed- no wonder!! poor little guy!!,M,3,3  months,1/24/2010,Flovent

My doctor thought the only reason for these side effects was because it was a steroid so we tried once a day spiriva for my asthma_ however without a steroid I was forced to use my rescue inhaler multiple times daily and never quite found relief_ always felt like my chest was tight.  My doctor told me after the fires in my area I needed to be back on a steroid inhaler because spiriva wasn't enough because I always had to be on prednisone tapers.  So she prescribed flovent (1 puff 2x daily) and I've had NO side effects at all.

In the first week_ he wet his bed at night twice and then had further issues with urinary incontinence.  After a month_ we noticed sadness in him_ verbally stating he was sad but couldn't explain why and laying on the couch in the morning stating he didn't know what to do.  In the same week_ he developed a facial tic on the right side of his face.  We took him off of the medicine.  It took two weeks for the facial tic to subside_ but his mood improved within the first week.  This child has also experienced aggression issues with Pulmicort.

However_ for that entire year_ she did not sleep through the night once_ and she seemed very hyper at all times of the day.,"We decided to take her off of Flovent in the spring. Similar to other comments_ our allergist said that it ""should not have those side effects""_ and prescribed us Singulair_ but within a couple of weeks_ my husband came across a report on how dangerous that drug can be (depression_ suicidal thoughts_ etc.) We stopped that immediately and started her with Chiropractic care_ and things looked up (she slept through the night again_ less hyper.) But this last month_ with all the fearful messages of H1N1_ and with her first wheezing problem that had her school calling me_ I got scared into thinking that Flovent is a necessary evil for my now 4 year old. Within days restless nights began again and we're seeing hyperactivity in the evenings again as well (my caregiver has also noted her hyperness.) And in the last few days_ we've also noticed red-puffiness appear around her eye within minutes after taking the medication_ and disappearing minutes later (we only made the connection tonight when it happened for the third time in a row.) So now tonight was her last night taking that stuff_ but I am absolutely confused as to what to do. I understand the importance of the ""controller""_ but it's obvious that Flovent is not right for my child. There seems to be little alternatives_ and the health professionals aren't helping us to find any.

He listened and then said condescendingly ""If I lstened to every anecdotal story that came in the door...etc etc AND ""the research does not support what you're saying"" So i tried again - scared I was putting my son - and later hiis two brothers in danger because he refused to prescribe albuterol (which never bothered them at all) without Flovent.

131, 1, asthma,I didn't realize it at first_ but slowly as my Flovent dosage was increased - I later found to an unhealthy level - I became depressed_ anxious_ I couldn't sleep_ I cried a lot.  It developed into full blown panic disorder and agoraphobia.  The doctor's all told me it had nothing to do with the medication.  I knew it did.  For the past year I've been weaning myself off of Flovent.  I went back to an old stand-by - Intal Inhaler.  No longer available in the US_ but my new doctor wrote me a prescription for it and I'm getting it through Panther Meds.  I also noticed that Flovent was available through them much cheaper than in the US - I have no insurance.  I ordered both.  The intal is fabulous and the only side effects were a bit of tightness and coughing for 2 weeks while I got used to it.  DO THIS!  Before they made it in non-CFC form_ you could even take this when you were pregnant.  It's safe.  As for the Flovent - strnagely enough_ I found out that in the rest of the world it is no,"DO NOT TAKE IT!  IF YOU""RE ON IT_ TRY INTAL.

At this time we are trying to keep her of all meds while her system returns to normal.

155, 2, Suspected Asthma,Severe aggression_ nightmares_ hyper-active,We were never aware of any side affects that related to behavioral issues.  My two year old son was put on Flovent when he was hospitalized for bronchitus. This was his second hospitalization.  The doc prescribed Flovent 2 puffs 2x daily and he was to use it for at least a year and a half.  We believed our 2 year old was just a bad child.  He constantly bit his older brother for no reason_ hit our dog_ kicked us_ screamed constantly_ could not sit still for more than 2 minutes.  His brother at some points would have 3 bite marks that would bruise on his back from my younger son.  He was biting kids at school every day.  We were told that he just was a bad kid.  It tore me apart to think I could not control my child and that we were raising a terror.  In passing I mentioned his behavior to a friend and she suggested I look into the medication.  I first found this website and the we immediately took him off.  The doc told us the medicine was not a factor in his behavior.  In one week we have noticed a TREMENDOUS turnaround.  His aggression has subsided_ he is calm_ no night terrors_ he is much happier.  I had a BIL who saw my child the week before we took him off the medication and then saw him again a week after we stopped and he could not believe it was the same child.  I am so relieved to have my baby back.  I feel awful to think what he went through.,M,2,6  months,5/27/2009,Flovent

157, 2, sudden_ severe asthma attack,While the drug controls his new asthma well (what do I know_ we've never dealt with this before) every quirk and negative personality characteristic is hyped by 100.  Tearing tiny pieces of paper_ and insisting on balling them and playing with them under a fingernail.  Inability to stop picking a scab_ till he bleeds.  Moodiness.  Verbal aggression.  Quick defensiveness.  Huge appetite.  Where he was a loving child_ now he acts like an attention starved cat.  Hugely needy  for physical affection.  Irritable and irritating the hell out of his siblings.  Generally making me nuts.  And I ADORE this child.  He was my baby for a long time until his baby brother came 2 years ago.  And oh_ reverted to obsessive thumb sucking.,"I've talked to 2 pharmacists_ and 2 nurses_ and 2 doctors_ including the pediatric pulmonologist's office.  I get the same ""well_ this med typically doesn't cause these type of symptoms"".  Oh really?  My son is just now a severe OCD nut?  What are my options?  We tried taking down the frequency and dose_ just to have to use the Albuterol within 2 days.  Maybe children are particularly sensitive_ but this is crazy.  An entire family shouldn't have to suffer with odd/unpleasant behaviors to control asthma_ but most of all_ I feel so badly for our son.  At least_ with this forum_ I don't feel so crazy anymore_ like it's all in my head...thanks to you all.",M,8.5,3  weeks,5/21/2009Email,Flovent
158, 1, Asthma Control,Rage_ anger_ severe anxiety_ night-terrors_ opposition_ defiance_ hallucinations_ day-dreaming_ ADHD.,I posted on this site in April_ '08 about my (then) 8 y.o. son's symptoms while on Flovent and wanted to update the past year.Since taking him off Flovent our son has gone from a raging maniac to a pretty normal 9 y.o. boy.  He is in 3rd grade_ gets straight A's and is reading at a 6th grade level.  His school work is exceptional and his social skills have improved 100%.  No more night terrors_ no more hallucinations_ no more rage.We are lucky that he seems to have grown out of his Asthma and we moved to another city with much less pollution which seemed to trigger the asthma.  I am confident in saying the Flovent caused all the severe symptoms I've listed.  Within 2 weeks of taking him off the medication his symptoms subsided.  We continue to work on his learned (poor) behaviors and work on our own (poor) reactions to him.  I can truly say life has improved 100% in regards to our son.Chris,M,9,7  years,5/13/2009Email,Flovent

I began all the meds for her immediately after returning from the drug store_ except for the Flovent_ only b/c I wasn't sure how to get her to breath in thru her mouth while giving it to her.  I called her dr and asked for further instruction on Wed 4-22-09.  Today_ 4-23-09_ my little girl became_ Baby Jeckle and Whiney Hyde. She has only had 4 treatments (2 per day Wed and Thurs) of the flovent.

He has a lot of enviromental allergies which I was told my choices were very expensive shots for a long period of time or Zyrtek.  For his Asthma he was prescribed Flovent 110 MCG 2 sprays twice a day and ProAir for quick relief. After a couple of days on the Flovent I noticed all of the side effects listed.  He also had loss of appetite.  He had been on Pulmicort Respules 0.25/2ML along with Albuterol 5MG and was fine it just took more time to administer.  I am going to go back to that because he only has asthma symptoms if he has a cold or has been running around a lot.  I do not recommend Flovent for anyone nor would I ever give it to my son again.

He also hit me for the first time ever! He had some nights of interrupted sleep_ and was just overall grumpy a lot! Also had a migraine in teh first few days of taking med and some cold symptoms but it wasn't really a cold.,Dr. told me_ after I told him about my son having side effects_ that the list of side effects was just mumbo jumbo and they have to write down everything from trials and that people may have been exposed to cold germs before the trial but then the symtoms show up so they have to include it. He also said that he only sees sdie effects once every two years. After trying another week_ he was just so different from his happy usual self that I called the Dr. about stopping and he agreed but wanted to put him on Qvar instead ( max dose 2 puffs 2 x a day just like the floven) He has been on nothing for over a week and he is starting to get back to his normal happy self and they are seeing a big improvement in school. Since Qvar has a lot of side effects too_ We decided against it. He has very mild asthma_ if any at all but the Dr. does not want to admit he may have made a mistake. we went in for allergy teasting and all of a sudden the Dr. says asthma beacuse he did have Bronchitis once and does get a bad cough with colds. But with the nebulizer and albuterol_ it helps the cough. I can't see hime on any stuff 365 days a year if he only needs it with colds. Also Dr. put he coughs with exercise but I said I had made a mistake and he really didn't but the Dr. would not take it off the report! He said it was part of his history and couldn't be changed.

I should add that I myself have dealt with asthma since I was a young child as well as my husband. My son has a docotr here that began treating him who started him with pulmicort and albuterol treatments.  Then we were reffered to a pulmonoligist.  At that time he was switched to flovent.  I might also add that many many times he has been treated with pred either by itself with albuterol or in addition to flovent or pulmicort.  And he has also taken pulmicort or flovent with out an oral steroid. With all that said we discontinued the pulmicort and the flovent because with both there were serious behavior issues.  I explained it to our doctors that it was that type of fit an autistic c,And here we are again facing the dilema of what is best for your child. With us already using flovent and having the same reults we do not know what the right decision is for him.

Well to that I reply I myself had a serious behavior reaction to the pred when I  was 18 years old crying rage violent to which I was taken off of the meds.  My two year old son was even worse with his behavior when he was on the flovent and pulmicort.

By the way_ his headache went away after he began taking his antibiotic for the sinus infection and have not come back.,I was very surprised to read these comments. I was beginning to feel that this is a forum intended only to bash this medication. My child has been taking the Flovent for only 3 1/2 weeks but has shown drastic improvement in most of the areas that everyone else is saying has gotten worse. His teacher says that he is on task all the time and that his grades have improved. We've seen no sign of aggression or agitation. He goes to sleep as he always has and has not complained of nightmares. This drug has been miraculous for him. This is a child who constantly had to use his nebulizer and is allergic to nearly everything. He is a changed boy_ but for the better. He hasn't used his nebulizer since he began taking Flovent.

Every approach to discipline has failed lately.  My son was on flovent 2x per day and I have brought it down to only 1 and there are still side effects.  I can't even leave the room without him having a total melt down and he is 5 - never did this when he was a toddler.  The same behavior happened when we tried Singulair.

197, 2, Seasonal Asthma,My daughter was prescribed Flovent after a 2 day stay at the hospital.  It seemed to control her asthma_ however I started getting reports from her daycare provider and gymnastics coach that they have had to give her multiple timeouts because she would not listen_ and was aggressive towards other children which was out of her character.  She does not sleep completely through the night and has become moody on some days.  She has only been on this medication for 2 1/2 weeks and takes 2 puffs twice a day.

I also have cry spells for absolutley no reason.  I am normally not emotional and could not live like this every day.  I was not told of these side effects and they were not on the product info sheet from the pharmacy.  I am glad I only had 5 days left of this medication or I would be looking for an alternative.

201, 4, Asthma (for both)_ Chronic Lung dis,2 sons take it--in one son_ age 20 months_ no adverse side effects and he has been on it since he was 10 months old. He has Chronic Lung disease and asthma.  HE also takes singulair and Xophenex daily. My older son_ now age 5_ was diagnosed with asthma towards the end of last summer and began taking flovent 8 months ago.  We have seen dramatic shifts in his mood_ behavior_ and ability to focus.  He was a golden child at his preschool last year_ and this year_ from the first day (2 weeks after starting Flovent) he has become impossible to manage.  Same room_ same teacher_ same class as last year.  The only thing that changed was him going on flovent.  It has taken us a while to pinpoint_ but we are pretty sure it is a reaction to the flovent and have begun to take him off the flovent.  We are seeking alternatives that have less of an emotional/behavioral effect.  He also recently began taking albuterol as needed.,It defeintely seems to vary person to person--like any medications.  Whiel not a commonly seen side effect_ as with all meds_ there will be side effects that show up in the genreal population that did not show up in clinical trials.  As a former scietific researcher_ I have to say that no clinical trial can ever predict every possible side effect.  It is forums like these that help people who have rare side effects connect_ and also keep the pharmacuitical companies informed of possible side effects to add tot heir warning or to do follow up studies on.,F,33,10  months,4/8/2008Email,Flovent

203, 2, prolonged barking cough,"My 5-year-old daughter was given Flovent (2 puffs of 50 mcg 2x daily) after developing a barking cough (loud enough to make you jump) at the end of a cold virus. After a few days I noticed that my daughter was restless and not sleeping well. After almost 2 weeks she was becoming hyperactive within 30 minutes of taking her med using an Aerochamber_ but her cough was still not under control so I continued her med. Her teacher commented at about 2 weeks that she seemed to be ""out of sorts"". On the 19th day_ one day after the cough finally seemed to be subsiding_ her school phoned me to say that she had asked that they call me because she wasn't feeling well - her teacher also noted that she had been acting ""completely out of character"". When I thought about the previous couple of weeks_ it became clear that she had been becoming increasingly sensitive_ moody and teary. She also experienced stomach bloating and more frequent bowel movements during this time_ which did n",It's not entirely clear which of my daughter's symptoms may have been caused directly by Flovent other than the hyperactivity and sleeplessness. Of course sleep deprivation can be quite harmful. However_ I think we have to conclude from our experience that she does not tolerate this med and should not be given it in the future except in an emergency and when there is no alternative available. I am quite unhappy that the potential for these side effects was not described in the drug information sheet that we received from the pharmacy_ nor was it mentioned by our family doctor. Even if sensitivity to a particular med only occurs in a small portion of the patients who use it_ patients and their families should be informed about this possibility.,F,5,19  days,3/26/2008,Flovent
204, 1, Allergic Asthma,I've pretty much experienced every side effect. I had been on and off it for 3 years prior. I wasn't consistently using the drug every day_ twice a day_ until about 1 years ago.  At which time I suddenly shot up 25 pounds_ even though I was working out 3 times a week. The weight was also in my mid-section and arms (which does not run in the family). I crave food constantly.I am sick ALL the time. Every cold that I am exposed to_ I catch it. I bruise just by grabbing or touching_ especially on my legs. My periods are severe_ painful_ and I am extremely emotional (which prior was not a problem). I get yeast infections constantly. I have developed severe skin sensitivities with in the last year. I can't wear any metal jewelry without breaking out into hives and bouts of extremely dry skin. ,If your doctor gives you any other recommendations on medications or alternative methods to controlling asthma_ I would be open to using them.,F,26,4  years,3/26/2008Email,Flovent

I wouldn't give up my Flovent for anything. B4 I started Flovent_ my bronchitis and allergy induced asthma was horrible and now recently I was diagnosed as having bronchitis again only this time I didn't even know I had it. I thought I just had a mild cold for 2 weeks and it turns out my doctor told me I had bronchitis. I truly believe my Flovent_ taking 1 puff twice a day at 250 mcg_ is what really helped me.

208, 4, repeated bronchitis / coughing,My 18 month old has been coughing for months_ Paediatrician started him on Singulair (our daughter is on this as well & has had great results) and the Ventolin & Flovent puffers.  He has been irritable_ eating has been off & on_ wired_ and falls asleep easily at night_ but wakes in the night with what appears to be bad dreams & gas_ and is awake for a minimum of 2 hours....  Not fun_ and it's every night... We're exhausted_ he's cranky.,We do feel the Flovent is helping to decrease his cough & dry it up.  Since he's been on antibiotics for bronchitis about 10 times in his short life_ it seems like a better change to make_ but we're not sure we can handle the night waking for an extended period of time.  Are there other options? My daughter did not have any of these side effects & still takes the Flovent/Ventolin frequently....  The Paediatrician has also prescribed a mask & machine_ is the medicine different?  We had to order it in & hasn't arrived yet.

If I could have hooked him up to an electric generator he could have powered a small city.  Aggression_ loss of self control_ mood swings_ became obsessive about certain things he previously had no interest in.  He constantly had to make noise_ even if it was just a slight humming sound while he ate.  He was a different kid. Stopped the treatment after five days.

We had some behaviour issues_ but thought that it was because of his age and did not consider that it might have been because of the medication.  Recently_ unfortunately_ the astma has returned--likely due to allergies.  He was put on Flovent two separate times and both times after a couple days we saw past behaviour issues return.

We're discontinuing immediately_ and I know his doctor will say aggression isn't a side effect_ as the only one he informed me of was the growth stunting effect_ even after I told him of our experience with Singulair.

But being anecdotal is not the same thing as not being real - the people that post to this forum might represent a statistically under-reported sample - the right question to ask is who has studied Flovent use in children? How many studies? How many children? What results? Just because we're a tiny slice of an larger population that takes this drug - this does no,F,6,3  months,1/14/2008Email,Flovent

He wakes frequently during the night and is up before 6:00am. This is not the norm for my little guy! He has been crying at the drop of a hat during the day and whining about everything from putting his shoes on to what friend to visit. It has taken me a while to make the connection to the medication since some of these behaviors are normal for this age group. But while trying to figure out the night time issues_ i have begun to suspect the medication. I wish I had thought of this earlier. We have had such a difficult couple of months. I feel like we are constantly diciplining him. He has never so much as pushed another child until this past week when he hit a little boy who wasn't playing a game the way he wanted him to. After that he just cried. It was as if he didn't know why he did it!,Contacted his doctor today_ they suggested giving him the med. in the am rather than pm. Said insomnia was not listed as a side effect_ but that everyone reacts differently to meds. See how he does with the change. After reading this site i will never give it to him again.

Coincidence? I don't believe so. Nothing else was different in my daily routine. First I noticed my face was puffy but didn't think much about it_ then when my head and tongue felt numb_ I started reading and asking ""professionals"".

Now that school has started_ she has already caught a cold but it it well under control with two puffs of flovent in the morning and two in the evening ( as her doctor has prescribed when she has a cold).

280, 3, Asthma,none,Taking this medicine along with serevent finally freed me from daily nebulizer treatments! Technology marches on though_ and for my asthma I'm now on Advair and will never go back.,F,22,4  years,4/29/2005,Flovent
281, 1, Respiratory Infection,Although Flovent (in conjunction w/ other meds) allowed me to breathe easier and cough less when I suffered from respiratory infection almost 2 years ago_ it raised blood glucose level (400+) and blood pressure (180/100+) drastically which made me feel weaker and tired (even though my breathing was improving). I was on Flovent for a couple of months and_ following such hypertension + hyperglycemic conditions_  I have become a Type 1 Diabetic (irreversibly).  Sadly_ I've also developed retinopathy as well_ despite good glucose control (90-110 average) after I was diagnosed with diabetes and put off Flovent.,Although this drug is known to be very effective for many patients_ it could be fatal to others as I found out the hard way. Unfortunately for me it was the latter --- but we had no way of knowing that Flovent would cause irreversible diabetes in my case. Living with diabetes is not easy... :(,M,36,2  months,1/24/2005,Flovent

283, 3, Asthma,I have taken a series of inhaled steroids since I was about 11 yrs. One side effect of all of them is significant weight gain. Another_ that I have only become aware of in hind-sight is stunted growth. I keep myself on as low a dose as possible now_ but when I do have to increase the dosage due to cold/allergies I gain weight all over again. As well_ I bruise much more easily. The combination of Flovent with other steroids_ such as Flonase is particularly problematic in these regards.,,F,26,9  years,10/20/2004,Flovent

285, 5, Severe Asthma,No side effects. Inhaled steriods are FAR less risky than taking oral steroids.,This is the only medication I have used that WORKED.  I have carried my albuterol around religiously since I was 8 years old.  I have discovered that while I am on Flovent_ I no longer care if I even have my albuterol nearby!  That's how wonderful this has been for me!,F,29,2  years,10/16/2004Email,Flovent

288, 1, asthma-like cough,Weight gain; advanced bone age and suppressed growth in child.,Find a doctor who will closely monitor children/be honest. Tests done w/Flovent are only a few months in duration and not long-term. Monitor your child yourself and be an advocate. We learned the hard way that Flovent is very powerful in kids under 12_ even on minimum dosage.,F,11,2  years,7/31/2004,Flovent
