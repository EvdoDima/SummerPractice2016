0, 5, Back spasms,Makes me dream more often.,I think Zanaflex is the best muscle relaxer.  Baclofen would be a close second.,M,48,1  years4MG 3X D,4/22/2016,Zanaflex
1, 4, For chronic pain and spasms,Only side effects that I have had are vivid dreams and drowsiness.,This medicine works very well_ but there is always room for improvement.  Baclofen and Zanaflex are very comparable as in it's effectiveness.,M,47,1  years4MG 3X D,3/17/2016,Zanaflex
2, 3, Muscle Spasms,Drowsiness.,I am to take this when I get up and again right before bed. The morning dose made me extremely sleepy so I don't think I'll take the morning dose unless I'm planning on being on the couch all day_ of course at night_ it's perfect because I get some needed sleep.,F,34,2  days4mg 2X D,2/29/2016,Zanaflex
3, 5, Severe menstrual pain,The main side effect is loss of muscle coordination. I find myself dropping things and knocking things over very often while taking Zanaflex. Such as dishes_ food_ items etc several times a day. This does not happen when I'm not taking Zanaflex.Also_ twice I had extreme slurred speech_ like being severely tongue tied. ,I take a total of 2-3 mg a day 3 days out of the month_ it has worked great on my pain. I take it with an Aleve or two Ibuprofen. It does not make me drowsy and I'm able to function throughout the day. It works much better than Tramadol. Before even with taking 10 or more Ibuprofen I wouldn't be able to get out of bed or move around much.,F,28,1  years1 3X D,12/21/2015Email,Zanaflex
4, 2, Lower back pain,Slurred speech_  dizzy_ extreme sleepiness_  mentally confused_ tingling impulses down my arms to my hands_ could not function had to get someone to drive me home,,F,57,2  weeks8mg,11/20/2015,Zanaflex
5, 5, Spasms in neck,Dry mouth that went away after a couple weeks,Was put on it for neck spasms. It has helped that as well as fibromyalgia and insomnia.,F,54,1  months4 mg,9/7/2015,Zanaflex
6, 1, Muscle Cramps,severe Headaches,I started taking this for leg pain/cramps related to Neuropathy. I started getting severe headaches a few hours after my first dose. It was so severe that it felt like a migraine along with nausea. As soon as I quit talking these and switched to Soma_ the headaches subsided.,F,34,3  weeks4mg,8/28/2015Email,Zanaflex
7, 5, Chronic pain bursiti_ fibromyalga,At times I may feel dizzy_ nausea_ dry mouth_ loss of appetite_and hallucinations when I increases dose with doctor's advise.,It helps me go into a deep sleep.  This helps me feel relieved from pain when I wake up.  I don't toss & turn but feel refreshed. No it doesn't take my pain away but it helps ease my pain and prevents me from taking more pain meds then I use too.  The only time I hallucinate is when my doctor tells me to increase my dose.  I am instructed to take quarters to a half of a tablet so my body can adjust to the medication.   The hallucinations eventually subside and I it helps me from getting muscle spasms through out my entire body.  I would not take without a doctor's supervision. I am limited to taking anti-inflamatories_ I am allergic to anything with aspirin_  ibuprofen_  anything that contains these ingredients.The only thing I can take is Tylenol. I also take anti-depression & bi-polar medication.   Between my pain specialist and psychiatrist I keep them both up to date with everything that is prescribed to me. This is very important_ this is a matter of life and death if you take medication that can have bad reactions to the chemicals in medication.,F,52,6  months4mg,7/11/2015,Zanaflex
8, 2, Migraine prophylaxis,Dry mouth_ fuzzy thinking_ slurred speech_ insomnia_ lethargy,I wasn't able to stay on this medication very long_ so I don't know if it would have helped my chronic migraines.  It zombified me and though I felt dead tired after taking it_ I laid awake all night unable to sleep.  I already have insomnia and this medication actually made it worse.,F,38,7  days4 mg 1X D,7/5/2015,Zanaflex
9, 5, Severe Spinal Arthritis,My Insurance Will Only Pay For Tizanadine. However_ Though I Experience Dry Mouth and Pretty Tremendous Headaches_ I Cannot Begin To Convey How This Medication Has Helped Me To Have Some Fashion Of My Life Back. I Am Now Able To Walk At A Better Than A Snails Pace While Walking With My German Shepherd Service Dog Much To Both Of Our Delights !!!Prior To This Medication_ I Was Literally Unable To Walk For Longer Than 3 to 5 Minutes.  I Can Now Walk_ On Good Days_ Up To 15 Minutes !!!!I Am VERY Grateful For This Medication Along With All Of The Other Medications I Take. This Was The Cherry On The Top !Headache_ Sleepiness_ My Dry Mouth and Even a Bit Of Dizziness ... I'll Gladly Take All Of That To Be Able To Walk With My Dog.,,F,54,10  months4 mg x 3,5/29/2015,Zanaflex

11, 1, DDD/sciatica/backpain,"I felt all of my pain slowly melt away and fell asleep for 3 hours (as i expected) When i woke up later in the evening i felt like i did when i was younger and thought it would be fun to ""day drink"" so a little hungover/groggy. BUT i will NEVER take it again due to the extreme anxiety that began to hit me a few hours after waking_ i feel so nervous and dizzy and im trying to talk myself out of it_ it's just that the feeling of anxiousness is so strong. I threw the bottle away_ I would rather be in pain than feel impending doom",,F,29,1  days2 mg 1X D,1/27/2015,Zanaflex
12, 1, fibromyalgia/chronic pain,I HATE this stuff! My Dr prescribed 4 mg but I can't stand the stuff_ it knocks me out for an entire day if I take that dose. And either way_ it does NOTHING for the pain or the spasms. I only take it so I can sleep_ because I'm in terrible pain and my Dr refuses to believe me and give me actual pain meds!,Run away from this awful drug! It makes me feel like I want to die. :(,F,36,2  weeks1-2 mg,1/1/2015Email,Zanaflex
13, 4, Muscle contracture,"Excessive sleepiness_ so I just use this as my ""fall asleep"" pill.",This drug kicks in after 30 minutes and wears off after 4-5 hours.  It puts me to sleep_ so I use it to fall asleep.  It does not help my muscles at all.  As for helping my muscles_ two other drugs I tried work better: Cyclobenzaprine (which is slow to kick in and too slow to wear off leaving me unable to wake up) and Skelaxin (which I can stay awake while taking).,M,37,2  years2 mg 1X D,9/30/2014Email,Zanaflex
14, 1, Idiopathic Nerve Pain and Spasms,I must take larger doses of medication than average people ever since it was discovered at age 5 that I don't respond to most drugs intended to sedate.Hallucinated TERRIBLY on this drug! Very scary hallucinations_ too!! Headless people that copy your own body movements and beckon to you_ crocodiles in your bed_ faceless children_ scary music that you can't drown out because it isn't real_  shapes and colors that only get more vivid when you close your eyes_ voices that talk to you_ etc! It's a rare side effect - only 5 people out of 170 case study participants_ which is approx 3% - but I'm one of the unlucky ones. I'd HIGHLY recommend against taking this medication at ANY dose just in case it happens to you. It's not worth it!,,F,41,4  months20-32 mg,9/6/2014,Zanaflex
15, 3, Back Spasms,Restless legs_ slight dry mouth_ extreme thirst_ VISUAL AND AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS!!!,I have had hallucinations of my dogs (I know they aren't real because I can always see thru them_ lol)_ things moving underneath blankets or laundry on the floor_ and cute spotted kitties playing on the rug. So far_ nothing scary - pretty cute_ actually - but nervous that I will hallucinate something scary_ like a person standing at the foot of my bed at night. I will stop taking it if that happens!! Although I did think I saw my daughter standing in the doorway of my bathroom one night but when I turned on the light_ nobody was there. I also hallucinate voices and music on this med. So far_ I've just laughed at most of it. The only annoying hallucinations have been the auditory ones. The restless legs also suck! I am okay with the thirst but chugging a liter of water before bed makes me get up to urinate several times a night. All in all_ it's an okay medication but not one I'd recommend for everyone.,F,44,3  months4 mg 4X D,8/3/2014Email,Zanaflex

17, 2, Neck and back spasms,Next day grogginess is reallyBad after taking this medication. It really only makes me sleepy and groggy_ and does nothing for my pain. I can not stand the next day hangover feeling.. So_ I hardly take it at all at this point_ maybe once a month if I'm having problems relaxing.. Because within an hour after taking it I'm pretty much asleep_ but it does wear off quickly if you don't lay down right after taking it.,,F,33,2  months2mg,7/11/2014,Zanaflex
18, 2, Neck Spasms,Since I work for a living this medication is a no go.  I tried to take it this morning and kept falling asleep_ and forget about driving. This medication for me does not work as good as Motrin.,I would rather take 3 200mg of motrin.  This medication also seemed to mess with my Lexapro that I take daily.,F,39,3  days4 mg 3X D,6/27/2014,Zanaflex
19, 1, Cervical Dystonia,Zanaflex (Tizanidine) - I had 1 mg. (1/4th of a 4 mg. tablet).  It caused a worsening of Cervical Dystonia and caused blurred vision.  It also caused drowsiness and an inability to think clearly.,This is an anticholinergenic.  Zanaflex is not supposed to have any antihistamine in it_ whereas Cogentin does.  [Note:  The half-life of Zanaflex is 2.54 hours].  The anticholinergenics that I have tried have either worsened the Cervical Dystonia or have not done anything to help it.,M,52,1  days1 MG. 1X D,5/8/2014,Zanaflex
20, 3, Muscle spasms_ neck pain,Hallucinations -- sounds like a steam valve being let off in the room.  Weird dream/wake sensation.  Have fallen on three occasions after taking.  I am now only taking this when I am sure that I am not getting up again until morning.,This drug  seems to work very quickly and wear off.  While I am initially very sleepy_ if I don't go to sleep during that phase_ I can't go to sleep afterwards.  I am probably going to cut down the dosage to avoid falling in the future and see if I tolerate the other effects better as well.,F,62,5  days10 mg 1X D,1/12/2014Email,Zanaflex
21, 3, Muscle spasms in back,It knocks me out quickly which is nice so I take it at night only. The one weird thing I notice is that my food tastes like there is nutrasweet on it.

30, 4, muscle tension/migraines/insomnia,dry mouth_ sleepiness_ kinda hazy feeling,works great for my insomnia when i take three at once. i have been on every medication possible for my migraines and nothing works this is the first medication to actually make me sleep but it is short acting.most of the pain medications they had me on would keep me awake so its nice to just be able to fall asleep. it does wear off after four hours so a repeat dose is sometimes nessesary to sleep thru the night.,F,26,4  months4mg 3X D,11/18/2011Email,Zanaflex
31, 4, migraines,slight drowsiness,I take 1mg upon waking_ 1mg in the afternoon & 3mg before bed.  My Dr wanted me to only take this med @ bedtime (1mg for 1 week & increase to current dosage) but after researching it & finding its effectiveness lasts only a few hours_ I decided to split the dosage up & take it while awake!  Dr gave her Ok (I would have done it anyway) but I did do it on her weekly schedule.  I'm @ 5mg  now (will continue to increase probably).  It helps (though has not been a cure) & I don't have any side effects.  Drowsiness is not major.  In fact_ I wake up sooner than I did before taking this medication.  I sleep deeper_ possibly_ but seem to wake up earlier.,F,38,2  months5mg 1X D,10/4/2011,Zanaflex
32, 2, Muscle spasms/ tension headaches,I took one pill before bed. The next day_ I experienced depression_ fatigue and anxiety. I felt like my insides were vibrating!! It does seem to help with the muscle spasms_ but not worth feeling like this!,,F,43, 4 mg 3X D,8/18/2011,Zanaflex

34, 5, Fibro. Auto Accidents chronic pain,Slows heartrate_ bp and respirations but is not a problem for me.,If you are taking it to help you sleep there is a catch... If you take one or two pills_ they will wear off within 2 to 3 hours and you wake up. My doc prescribed me Ambien and it helps keep me asleep. I take a very high dose of zanaflex before bed_ 2 1/2 pills or (10mg). I am a true insomniac and rarely get my deep sleep(rem's) This will do the trick. I also suffer from migraines and sometimes I sub one zanaflex and take one 50mg phenegan. This lets me get a full night of restful sleep and most of the time the migraine is gone. ,F,46,2  years4mg 3X D,1/7/2011Email,Zanaflex
35, 3, Multiple Trigger Points in Back,I have never tripped from a medicine until last night.  I took only 1/2 of the pill_ and was so dizzy I could barely stand.  I started hallucinating while looking at a picture of myself_ it was moving_ which freaked me out.  It definitely helped_ but it wasn't worth my side effects.  I don't like to be out of it like that.  I am no longer going to take it.,,F,28,1  days4mg 1X D,11/3/2010,Zanaflex

40, 1, Migraines,Jittery feeling_ sleeplessness (insomnia)_ dizziness.,My FNP ordered Zanaflex along with Cymbalta to treat my frequent migraines and the Zanaflex was to help me sleep at night. Well_ that did not happen. I fell asleep then awakened feeling jittery_ dizzy & unable to fall back asleep about 2 hours after. I tried the it a second night thinking it was due to taking the Cymbalta too late in the day only to have the same thing happen again.

My current boyfriend thought it was having a bad effect on my personality_ so I stopped taking it.

Woke up unable to breathe -- mouth and throat very dry and throat was swollen -- drank water and used my rescue inhalator (I have asthma).  I was very drowsy and went back to sleep after a few minutes_ but woke up again after about an hour with the same symptoms. Drank more water_ used my rescue inhalator again and sat up in bed so I could breathe.  During the next few hours I drank a lot of water and Gatorade to rehydrate my body.  The onset of these symptoms was rapid and frightening -- the effects lasted until about 3 p.m. the following day.,I definitely would not recommend this drug to anyone -- the prescribing doctor gave no indication of any such possible effects -- after having read other patients' comments_ I would say that this drug is dangerous and needs more research and testing.,F,56,1  days,3/9/2009,Zanaflex
