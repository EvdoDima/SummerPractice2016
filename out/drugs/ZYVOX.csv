1, 5, Staph Infection,I had severe impetigo on my face from staph bacteria.  After numerous antibiotics_ I eventually was prescribed Zyvox.  My infection cleared within 2 days!  However_ after starting Zyvox my face became extremely sensitive to facial products. Two weeks after ending Zyvox_ my arms and ankles started getting bumps on them which looked to my like focullitis.  However_ my dermatologist told me I have eczema.  There is no way I have eczema because I have had perfect skin before the staph infection.  More rashes are appearing on my hands and face but do not look like the first time I had staph.  After researching more on Zyvox I found out that you can start having reactions to the antibiotic a few weeks after you stop the medicine.  The rashes aren't horrible but they do itch and are extremely red.  They range from small lesions to bumps to just patches of reddness.,Would use this medication again if the staph infection comes back.  It really works on resistant staph bacteria.  The medicine was VERY expensive and cost me nearly $1800!,F,26,10  days,11/19/2009Email,Zyvox
2, 4, MRSA Infection in surgical wound,I did have my blood pressure spike because I wasn't told not to eat food with tyramine in it which is most hard cheeses.  There was some nausea.,This medication in the oral form allowed me to get out of the hospital and go home to recuperate.  If you are on this and experience side effects get your doctor to do some blood work.,F,49,10  days,3/26/2006,Zyvox
