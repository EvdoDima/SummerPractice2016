5, 1, Tinnitus,Nausea_ myoclonus_ hypothermia_ insomnia_ anal itching.,I have been suffering from a low pitch tinnitus in my right ear for the past 4 years and have tried numerous drugs without much success. I thought I'd give this one a try after reading that tricyclic antidepressants have helped some people get rid of their tinnitus. Well_ in my case we'll never know. The side effects were so bad (esp. the nausea_ insomnia and hypothermia) that I gave up after only 4 days. The tinnitus bothers me_ the Anafranil however made me really sick. You do feel high on this drug though so there's definitely an antidepressant effect there_ hidden beneath all the nasty side effects.,M,42,4  days25 MG 1X D,11/24/2015Email,Anafranil

I have been taking this medication since February 24_ 2014_ starting at 50 mg titrating up to 150 mg.  I consider myself lucky because although I have experienced side effects with Anafranil_ they have not been major.  I take it at night and sleep like a rock.

I felt well and lived a wonderful and productive life but when I became pregnant my psychiatrist told me I had to stop taking it as it was not a ""safe enough"" drug during pregnancy. After_ I tried other anti-depressants but they always stopped working after a number of years. Finally_ after having reached rock bottom a month ago_ I asked my doctor about anafranil and believe it or not_ from the first day I took the small dose of 25 mg_ I felt a change in my head. I now am happy_ healthy and the intrusive thoughts are almost gone and when they do appear_ they disappear so fast and the anxiety associated with them is not there. Yes_ there are some side-effects but there are with every medication. I would highly recommend this medication to anyone suffering from these illnesses.",,M,,5  weeks100 mg,3/27/2014Email,Anafranil

It has minimized obsessive thoughts and made me calmer.  The dizziness_ constipation and sweating were ok with me but this shortness of breath is a deal-breaker.   My doctor loves this medication and keeps insisting that it is my anxiety and not the drug.  As each day passes_ I am becoming more and more convinced_ my shortness of breath is from Anafranil.

25, 4, depression_ anxiety,Sleep disturbance - early morning awakenings_ sweating_ nervousness_ abdominal warmth/tension,My mood and energy are much better. In terms of nervousness that I would feel sometimes on Anafranil_ what helped was to take it with a good amount of food. Once I got the digestive side effects handled_ my agitation was gone. so it seems like my brain was reacting to the stomach problems. Taking it with food at bedtime also helped my sleep.I have experienced significant weight loss - at first because of the stomach issues_ but also my urge to overeat has gone down because I feel better mentally.Happy to recommend this drug but the first few weeks are likely to be a tough adjustment for most people.,M,31,8  days10 mg 1X D,5/1/2013,Anafranil

I would see shadows running on the floor like rats_ seeing people that had twisted bodies_ dogs etc...hearing people talking about me saying that I had to slap people and if I didn't do it_ they would bite me or scratch me. I basically developed all the symptoms of schizophrenia. I didn't do anything right away because I just thought it was real and accepted it. Then people at work noticed and told me that I was staring at things and talking alone. I called my psychiatrist and he immidiately discontinued the treatment_ even if it helped my depression.

My OCD felt under control for the first time in 10 years; I felt stable and happy. The side effects were unpleasant but I was willing to undergo anything. However by month 6 I was so exhausted and my heart was so stressed I had to discontinue the meds. Very strong chemical.

31, 2, Trichotillomania/OCD,dry mouth_ spasmodic motions of neck head and hands_ orgasmic yawning_ extreme weight loss (16 pounds),Anafranil has not worked for me at all. I still pull everyday. As far as side effects_ I'm also taking several other medications for ADD/ADHD_ so they might not all be valid. However_ the spasmodic movements were definitely a result of anafranil; and the movements are SO annoying.

35, 4, Depression_ anxiety,Acid reflux_ hard to orgasm_ severe sweating (head only)_ tiredness,Clomipramine (as it's called here in the UK) has really helped me. It has made me the person I want to be and really helped me face life again. I found I was suffering more acid reflux after taking them so I started to take them at lunchtime with food. The sweating is a problem but not a 'deal breaker' and I take much_ much longer to orgasm and when I do it feels somehow different (not bad_ just different) so I see why these are prescribed for premature ejaculation.The side effects are OK and I would strongly recommend this medication,M,39,8  months100mg 1X D,9/26/2011Email,Anafranil

37, 5, OCD,Dry mouth_ weight gain_ excessive sweating (head)_ harder to orgasm,I was diagnosed with OCD at 13 - hand washing_ checking_ intrusive thoughts. This drug made my OCD completely disappear. Yes the side effects are not great_ but they are not the end of the world. When I had OCD I could not function normally at all_ all my time was taken up with my obsessions_ I can function normally with these side effects. I have tried coming off the drug many times in the last 13 years but when I do_ I get very emotional and depressed and my intrusive thoughts come back. I would recommend this drug to anyone with OCD_ the dull headaches and tiredness do go with time_ just keep taking it regularly and they will disappear. The side effects I have sited above_ however do not seem to disappear.,F,26,13  years75mg 1X D,6/25/2011,Anafranil

I mean_ it made me so happy and carefree. But I had the worst headache on it_ my mouth was bone dry_ and even if I wasn't drinking water_ I had to pee every 20 minutes for some reason. I also gained 10 pounds because it made me ravenous! It did help with OCD a lot_ but it just wasn't worth it.,F,21,21  days50 mg 1X D,9/27/2010,Anafranil
45, 2, Anxiety and Depression,Dry mouth_ severe constipation (successfully treated with 20mg lactulose daily) and extreme difficulty reaching orgasm (even through masturbation; and if I managed_ I would experience a strong headache for hours afterwards).,I've tried SSRIs_ SNRIs_ tricyclics_ Aurorix_ Avanza_ etc. Efexor is the only one that's worked (though only temporarily). I had high hopes after reading the positive experiences of others here. Sadly_ I observed no benefit after being on 75mg for four weeks and I was not prepared to go higher due to the side effects. I'm weening myself off clomipramine and have just commenced Valdoxan.,M,34,4  weeks75mg 1X D,9/19/2010,Anafranil

49, 1, OCD,Anxiety_ dry mouth_ constipation_ zombie-like_ emotionally numb_ personality changes_ suicidal_ cutting,I was introduced to anafranil in 1990 by Dr. Jenike at the OCD Clinic at Mass General Hospital. I had a history of panic disorder from the time I was 10 and it manifested into OCD when I was 25. Approximately 5 hours after taking my very first dose which was probably 50 MG_ I went into one of the worst anxiety attacks of my life and had to be taken to the hospital.  Anyone with pre-existing anxiety disorder should be aware that anti-depressants can trigger extreme panic attacks!  Be sure to take your xanax or klonpin when taking anafranil.  After 4 years (not consecutive as I became pregnant and stopped all meds during that 9 months)_ I couldn't bear not having the desire to play my musical instruments or do art any more.  I felt like a zombie most of the time.  Looking back_ there is so much that I cannot remember from 1990 - 1995.  I do recall cutting myself (the scars are still there on the back of my arm) and threatening suicide in front of my parents.  Anafranil may have stopped me from doing a lot of the obsessive rituals_ but it also ruined my kids' and my life.  I was introduced to zoloft in 1995 and that actually worked amazingly well for the OCD without all the horrible side effects of anafranil.  I've been med-free and I'd say about 95% OCD-free since 2004.,F,45,5  years100 MG 1X D,6/26/2010Email,Anafranil

First time I visited a psychiatrist I was diagnose as bipolar disordered because I decribed my thoughts as ""racing"" and got a terrible acathisia on SSRI's which he thought to be hypomaniac symptoms. Took me 8 years to get rid of that diagnosis. I'll save you that story. Anafranil made the violent_ sexual thoughts_ the continuous doubt and need to position things ""right"" and the need to ""confess"" so much less. Adding a little risperdal (0.5 mg) made things even better! Symptoms are 60% less and I can have a professional life again! Damn that anorgasmia though ... but it is worth it. I actually don't really understand why TCA have this bad reputation; I personally find them even to be better tolerated than the SSRI's_ that for sure.",M,32,6  months,1/6/2010Email,Anafranil

66, 5, Depression/Anxiety/Depersonalizatio,None as yet,I have tried Aropax/Zoloft/Luvox/Clonoazepam/Xanax and more recently Cymbalta - most of these with valium_ as needed to varying degrees. The side effects of these drugs as well as there inefficacy has led me to try Anafranil - Having only been on this drug for about a week i have felt much better! Less distracted and able to concentrate on uni_ and the people i care about.,M,,6  days,5/13/2009,Anafranil

I no longer go to sleep fearful_ so far_ so good.,F,21,1  months,3/16/2009,Anafranil
68, 4, Trichotillomania,I don't remember any minor side effects_ but I had a real problem with mental confusion_ to the point that I stopped this medicine even though it was working.  It was like functioning on 3 hours sleep - my short term memory was shot and I had trouble recalling passwords and facts.,This drug is amazing for OCD and trichotillomania.  I took a pill and within minutes had zero desire to pull.  I stopped taking it because I couldn't tolerate the mental confusion but I'm not sure if it it is a brief side effect that gets better over time or not.  I plan on trying it again soon because I need the help.,F,31,2  weeks,3/15/2009,Anafranil
69, 5, suicidal depression_ anxiety_ OCD,25 years experience. Works very well but side effects keep me trying other meds. Yet always a relief to get back to clomipramine (anafranil). Anticholinergic effects include acid reflux leading to scarring of esophagus and inability to swallow  many foods without simultaneously drinking lots of warm/hot water_ necessitating so far 2 outpatient operations to stretch esophagus. No sexual dysfunction for first 12 years but now severe (depending on dosage_ as is libido loss) as I age. Reflux plus dry mouth anticholinergic effect have caused bad tooth decay. Bloating and weight gain. Mental confusion and difficulty urinating on higher doses_ i.e._ over 100 mg daily sometimes_ but at other times fine on 165mg. Constipation_ sweating_ trembling_ imbalance were mainly issues in the earlier years during which I often experienced some borderline serotonin syndrome.,Saved my life for sure. I was hospitalized_ so they could go straight to 150 mg_ and by the 4th day I felt great. Maintains a real sense of well-being. Still have intrusive obsessional thoughts at times_ but now I'm almost detached from them and they pass quickly. I keep trying to lower the dose because of side effects_ and success depends upon changing life circumstances_ seasons and how much anti-anxiety meds I am prescribed. Tricky_ but I've done this often enough I don't have to wait to feel suicidal anymore to know I need to increase my dose. I've been on as little as 40 mg daily for 2 months and as much as 200 mg daily when things aren't going well_ soon tapering to 150 due to borderline serotonin syndrome. A dose increase like this after falling into depression is like being plucked out of hell into a state of grace_ no exaggeration. My average daily dose is 75-90 mg. Also really helps against anxiety and insomnia. Higher doses are the best painkiller ever for my bad back. My generic is APO. Once I filled my Rx at a different pharmacy and sunk into a severe depression. I hadn't noticed the generic was GEN. My shrink said that generic had that reputation. Why don't these dummies tell you these things beforehand? I've also never had a doc tell me about tooth decay from dry-mouth-causing drugs. Drinking water_ etc. isn't enough. Dental hygienist says you need a salivary enzyme replacement toothpaste and/or mouthwash_ e.g._ Biotene.,M,62,25  years,3/13/2009,Anafranil
70, 3, OCD and depression,Dry mouth_ Dizziness when standing up_ nausea_ diarhoea_ constipation_ drowsiness_ twitching muscles and hands_ indigestion- this drug is quite acidic_ edgy feelings after being on it a while_ increases anxiety and skipped heartbeats_ fatigue for first few weeks- wears off.Upon forgetting to take it I had nasty side effects_ i sweated profusely_ shortness of breath_ frequent toileting_ alerted feeling_ a little panicky at times from the high temperature. I find this particularly nasty_ the physical addiction our body goes into.,I think Anafranil is good for anyone with acute anxiety condition or panick disorder like me. Panic disorders can be hard to treat_ but not impossible_ it can be gotten rid of for long periods thank God. But its a strong drug even at 225mg a day_ forgetting to take it for 3 days i thught i had a stomach bug and flu. I was throwing up and toileteing frequently. I feel these drugs are good for as long as you need to take them and no longer. I feel that with prolonged use side effects would increase. I really dont like the edgy feelings ive been getting with cramps in my gut. I certainly hope toc hange it and recieve therapy from a HSE in crises.,F,30,9  months,3/2/2009Email,Anafranil

Of these side effects_ the dry mouth_ dizziness_ and facial flushing diminished as time went on_ and in sum these 3 problems have been quite minor.  The low sex drive_ however_ has been problematic_ and must be addressed.,"Struggled with OCD/anxiety symptoms_ along with mild depression_ from about age 20 onward (though intermittent symptoms appeared earlier).  These problems gradually worsened as my 20s progressed.  At around age 30_ due to some adverse experiences_ I developed a couple of new obsessions that caused my condition to worsen rapidly and substantially.  Over a period of 4 years_ I tried_ in various doses and combinations_ Luvox (fluvoxamine_ I believe)_ Celexa (citalopram)_ Wellbutrin_ and Effexor (the most effective of this group)_ and received only minimal benefit.  As a ""last ditch"" attempt to resolve my problem_ believing it was something I just had to learn to live with_ I tried Anafranil (clomipramine) and within three days began to feel some improvement:  the intense tightening I would feel in my chest whenever an upsetting thought entered my mind was diminished--the first real relief I'd felt in 4 years.

Then hallucinations(like seeing halos around people's faces).After the 1 month on this_ then went in the manic phase and then totally totally out of control and tried to cut my wrist.

80, 5, Depression_ BDD,Dry mouth_ dizziness(1st weeks) loss of sex drive and orgasm (1st months)_ weight gain_ drowsiness_ constipation_ vivid nightmares (when i forget to take it),I felt better almost immediately after taking this drug. I have tried a number of SSRIs and other drugs without relief. This drug has completely turned my life around. Suicidal thoughts_ days spent hiding in bed_ frequent bouts of crying_ are all bad memories. I have so much more energy and have developed a lust for life that I haven't had since I was young. Within months of starting this drug my life turned around - I got the job I'd dreamed of_ I moved out of my parent's home_ weekends started filling up again. Now I have a career_ a full social life and am living independently. On the down side I have put on 10kg in 6 months. I went through a period of not being able to achieve orgasm but that has passed. And if I forget to take it at night I get bad nightmares. I also feel drowsy in the mornings and it takes me a while to wake up.All in all the positive effects far outweigh the side effects though.,F,26,6  months,4/19/2008,Anafranil
81, 5, OCD,Dry mouth_ constipation for a couple weeks_ lower libido,Anafranil has worked the best of all the SRI's I have tried for OCD. I have tried Zoloft_ Cymbalta_ Lexapro and none made much of a difference_ Anafranil is in its own league_ it was night and day better than any other med I have tried. The dry mouth is the only real side effect that still bugs me along with occasional night sweats especially on my legs which is funky. Libido is lower and orgasm is more difficult but that isn't all bad!,M,27,4  months,4/12/2008,Anafranil
82, 2, Anxiety and Depersonalization,Increased Anxiety_ Panic Attacks_ Sleeplesness_ Ear Ringing_ Pins and Needles in Body_ Sore Throat_ lengthened the time to reach orgasm.,I took Anafranil for Depersonalization and General Anxiety Disorder. For the first 7 days I felt absolutely Nothing. It's as if I was swallowing candy. But then on day 8 I started to feel very anxious a few hours after I took it. Also couldn't sleep very well. This medication usually makes people tired. But it had the opposite effect on me. It didn't make me any more tired than usual. It actually made it harder to get to sleep. Then on Day 9 I had a full blown panic attack after I took it. I thought I was going to have to call 911. My anxiety went through the roof and I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I was scared!!! The next day my left ear started ringing and I felt as if I was getting a sore throat. This stuff started doing some weird things to me_ so I decided to stop taking it before the side effects got even worse. Medication can effect everyone differently. This just isn't the right one for me. Use at your own risk!,M,39,9  days,4/3/2008,Anafranil
83, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ OCD_ Paranoia,Dry mouth_ Lowered libido_ Increased sweating during excersize,Before Anafranil_ my life seemed so chaotic. I was constantly fighting with my parents_ struggling to meet demands at school_ having friendship troubles due to reluctance to participate in large social groups and crowded events. Also_ I would constantly obsess over the way I looked and had an overly cynical outlook/sense of humor_ all while feeling guilty for no good reason_ and believing that strangers were either critisizing my appearance or annoyed by my prescence. My old life seemed meaningless and it got to the point where all I cared about were a couple friends_ any kind of illegal 'upper'_ and obsessing over my looks and my health. An insane asylum seemed appropriate_ as I convinced myself that I was schizophrenic. I would skip class if I was late due to my phobia of being stared at when entering the classroom.  I would tense up and begin a negatibe loop of thoughts concerning and obsess for days over what other students were saying about me behind my back (how arrogant of me);,M,19,8  days,1/29/2008Email,Anafranil

85, 5, depression_ anxiety_ obsessions,Dry mouth_ slight fatigue_ some sexual problems,I have only been on this medicine for a week and it has been a GODSEND!! After only four days I started feeling better and each day is an improvement on the last. I recomend taking this with huperzine A to counter the anticholinergic effects.  This medicine puts zoloft/Prozac/lexapro to shame.  The SSRIs have more side effects (don't believe the anti tricyclic marketing) and can barely come close to the fast depression relief anafranil has offered-much less the anxiety and obsession relief.  This drug has cured my mind of all doubts_ worries_ obsessions and paranoia and has left me with clarity to concentrate and happiness to show compassion once again!

Moreover_ the fact that I had comorbid depression and anxiety seemed to imply that it would be a great fit.  In addition_ the med was rated very highly by a lot of other people.  Surprisingly_ the med made me more anxious_ irritated my nervous system to the point of making me feel like I was jumping out of my skin.

The awful mood swings I've had since childhood (about 25 years total) are under control for the first time...and the OCD is no longer debilitating. It rears its ugly head now and then_ but it feels more like habit than anything else. There is no better feeling than feeling relatively free of OCD and suicidal thoughts. My boyfriend and family noticed the changes immediately and comment that they've never seen me ""doing better"" in my life. I hope you_ too_ experience the same_ or better_ level of freedom if and when you decide to take it. Also_ I want to mention_ DO NOT drink excessively (more than 3 drinks) if you take this medicine.
