0, 2, Osteoporosis,I've been using a nasal spray for over five years. Broke a bone last year_ had full body x-ray that showed no improvement in bone density.  This after also taking calcium.  Really disappointed.Don't know whether to try anything else.,,F,70,  1X D,9/10/2014,Fortical
1, 5, osteoporosis,None at all.,I've taken both Fortical and the generic Calcitonin Salmon and have not experienced any side effects. The Fortical smelled a little pungent_ but I got used to it.  For some reason the generic doesn't have that smell. I am very relieved to find a medication that I can tolerate so well.  Hopefully it will help with the bone loss.,F,55,2  months 1X D,11/29/2010,Fortical
