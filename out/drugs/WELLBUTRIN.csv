0, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ ADD,Mild nervousness if I don't eat frequenly,It takes about 2 months to see noticeable results. You may become agitated briefly for the first few days. My depression is gone. My anxiety is better. My ADD is better. I have more patience and I'm more social. Since taking Wellbutrin I have started taking yoga_ going to the gym. I have not experienced the weight loss that many do. I think this may be due to being on Vyvanse and losing weight while taking that.,F,46,6  months30 mg,5/31/2016Email,Wellbutrin
1, 1, Smoking cessation,Irrational thoughts. Mood swings_ lack of motivation to high activity. Anger_ frustration.,I started the drug with some trepidation but after a day or two noticed more restful sleep and an increased libido. After a couple weeks I began to question everything around me like there was_this conspiracy against me. My thoughts would swing from general happiness and calm to being suspicious and untrusting.  I lashed out at my wife _ accusing her of being unfaithful creating this whole cheating scenario in my head.  Rational thinking went right out the window. I didn't think delusions were a side effect but they are. My personality is generally confident and good natured but after a few weeks on this drug I find myself feeling insecure and at times emotional. These bad feelings come on out of nowhere and last for a few minutes to a few hours. I'm not taking this drug ever again.,M,48,1  months100mg,5/25/2016,Wellbutrin

5, 4, add_ depression_ smoking cessation,Dry mouth_ a little shaky,I had known I was depressed for some time. My husband and I were fighting about the cleanliness of our home_ couldn't keep kids on a steady schedule_ life was just...chaotic. I know it's only been a week but I can tell a difference. I'm CONSTANTLY cleaning_ dinner at around the same time_ showers and bed routine with kids done before their bedtime_and no fighting with hubby_ and I haven't had a cigarette in 8 days. I'd say it works for me.,F,26,7  days150 mg,3/22/2016,Wellbutrin
6, 5, Depression/Anxiety,When I started this med_ constipation.  That subsides_ and the side effects at 18 months are zero.,I started at 37.5 mg/day_ gradually have worked up to 225 mg/day.  I know too many people have the 150 mg. dumped on them at the start_ and I_ and others I talk to_ have found it works better to ease into this med_ more gradually.  It is a stimulating Antidepressant_ so I combine it with Effexor_ for anxiety_ and I am as pleased as punch.  If you are having problems at the start_ please give any Antidepressant At Least 8 weeks to truly begin to work....at least_ if you truly want to feel its benefits.  If not_ start complaining right away_ and stay miserable.  I wish you the best.,M,57,18  months112.5 2X D,3/12/2016Email,Wellbutrin

Very unattractive and it's something I am constantly having to make an effort to be conscious of and remind myself to smile or smirk. My son pointed it out to me.,When I was 27 this saved my life. I mean literally saved my life. After my post pard. I took it a little over a year but noticed after about 8 months it not working as well. Tried increasing to 400 mg but too many side effects. 6 years later I am trying it again and finding that its having zero effect on me. Its really weird. I swore by this medication and should have been a spokesman for it with the way I recommended to anyone I knew struggling. I am in the process of finding something that can help me as much as wellbutrin did so many years ago. Trying Lexapro now and it works very well But it doesnt give me that boost to get out andbe social and do stuff like wellbutrin did. So I am still searching. But I would still recommend for a first time patient.,F,27,1  years300mg,2/16/2016,Wellbutrin
11, 5, Smoking Cessation,Transient insomnia_ anxiety_ xerostomia_ a sensation of 'pressure behind the eyes',I took Zyban to stop smoking some years ago. It worked_ and worked well. Cravings were significantly reduced and I derived no pleasure from cigarettes anymore. I quit within a week of starting it_ and never looked back!Six years later_ I smoked something that I didn't know contained tobacco. I started smoking again. This time got generic Wellbutrin. Within 3 days_ I doubled up to the 300 mg. does for smoking cessation. That night_ after dinner_ I felt like a train hit me. Felt almost unreal_ on the verge of panic for hours.Moral of the story - stick with the name brand and you will have a much better experience_ as the drug will be released slowly into your system!,M,36,90  days150 2X D,2/12/2016Email,Wellbutrin

No enteric coatingon the generics_ means the generics dump all the drugs into your system in the first few hours_ leaving you in the gutter.

18, 1, Depression,I'm going INSANE. I was originally on 150 mg and started to feel really bad_ my worst symptom at that time was anhedonia (not caring about anything). All I felt was sadness and loneliness_ even with my boyfriend_ friends_ and family. It didn't even cross my mind that it could be the Wellbutrin because my side effects coincided with some negative things that happened to me. So because I was feeling so low_ a week ago my psych changed my dosage to 300 mg. And it seriously feels like I'm dying. I can't eat_ I forced myself to today but yesterday all I could stomach was a handful of trail mix. I can't sleep_ even though I take sleeping medication. I'm rapid cycling through moments of severe depression and occasional moments of what I would probably call mania. Yesterday I was semi-delirious because I didn't eat and hadn't slept_ and severely paranoid. I kept picturing that an earthquake was about to happen_ and then I kept experiencing it over and over in my head. My psych is weaning me off of it completely right now_ 5 more days to go_ and the end of this nightmare can't come fast enough. I'm praying these days fly by.,,F,22,3  weeks300 mg,12/2/2015Email,Wellbutrin
19, 5, Depression,Dizziness at first_ continued dry mouth_ anger_ anxiety for first two years until dosage was increased_ loss of appetite_ decreased alcohol consumption_ weight loss-losing more muscle than fat_ out of breath with any physical activity_ occasional bruxism_ mild headache sometimes_ very slight increase in libido_ tremors,"I started Wellbutrin in May 2013 at 300mg. There was no titration from 150 to 300_ and that's when the side effects really kicked in. I had horrible dizziness to the point the room was spinning_ hands shook so bad it looked like I had Parkinson's. Two years later I found that I wasn't as motivated to do anything_ whether around the house_ work or even activities I used to love. Within the 2 years I had several angry outbursts_ road rage_ and heart beating fast (+ 110). I asked my doc if we could try 450mg in late October. What a game changer. I used to drink a lot on the 300mg-12-14 beers everyday (please no lecturing). The beer went to my head really fast- slight buzz after 1_ feeling like I had 5 after 2 beers. I didn't really feel hungover like I was in my 20's_ but just a very mild headache. Surprisingly enough_ when I upped to 450mg_ the desire for alcohol has dropped to half_ but has been as low 1 day to 4.  The anger has subsided_ my mood is way more relaxed_ I continuously clean my house- to the point of getting rid of things I haven't looked at in 20 years. Bathroom is spotless_ and kitchen clean too. My production at work is increased- I'm now getting projects completed before my boss gets upset. Drinking a lot of water due to very dry mouth. I haven't noticed much a libido increase but I will have to admit_ I have read the reviews on Wellbutrin several times_ and wanted to experience the ""off the charts"" horny feeling but it never happened to that exten",M,59,2.5  years300+150 1X D,12/1/2015Email,Wellbutrin

21, 3, Severe Depression,I was on wellbutrin XL 300mg for 6 years. After 3 years I started having extreme woozy/lightheaded spells that were ruining my life. Everyone kept blaming it on my anxiety. After three years of hating life I went off of wellbutrin. It took over 30 days before I even started to see relief_ but by the 90 day mark I was free from those spells. I have my life back. It would not have gone away. Wellbutrin helps with the kind of depression where you have NO motivation and crave sugar. It will make you dehydrated_ constipated_ edgy_ and a light sleeper that only needs about 6 hours per night. It isn't good for anxiety and will not help it. During the adjustment period you could lose about 10 lbs and have the most vivid nightmares ever. This drug will stop working for you. At first you can be so numb but after awhile you start to feel very depressed again. It's not until you go off of it do you realize that it was helping.

25, 1, depression/anxiety,abdominal pain_ diarrhea_ insomnia_ loss of appetite_ nervousness_ tinnitus_ dry mouth_ heart palpitations_ weight loss,I had taken this medication 8 years ago and had no side effects from it. This time though I had a negative experience with this med. I had constant diarrhea_ 3-4 times a day. I had a loss of appetite and had gotten to the point that I couldn't stand to even think about food. Thinking about what to eat or fix for my family actually caused anxiety. I lost 10 lbs in 9 nine days. About the 5th or 6th day I started to be unable to sleep during the night. I woke up every hour. During the day I would have waves of nervous energy_ almost like the feeling you get when you experience the fight or flight response. The last day I took it I woke up at 4 am with diarrhea_ left sided abdominal pain that radiated to my back and shoulder_ and heart palpitations. A trip to the ER revealed that I had a large amount of stool and gas in my colon. I had a miserable experience with Wellbutrin.,F,39,9  days150 XL 1X D,7/18/2015,Wellbutrin
26, 1, Major Depression,"Started with 150 XR generic to ""augment"" Prozac (40-60 mg daily for ~2 yrs)_ not exactly sure why I was even looking for a boost -- undergoing significant extra stress_ in summary. I asked to increase to 300 mg within a week or two ... again_ not quite sure why. To intensify its expected ""feel good"" effect_ I guess. Knowing it is a dopamine enhancer_ I was aware it would stimulate pleasure centers formerly activated by drugs and alcohol. In short_ it does indeed appear to be a faux cocaine_ although the high wasn't near even the rather lame high of cocaine yet the adverse effects were strikingly similar if not yet out and out as dangerous. Within two weeks of 300 mg XR_ I quit taking Prozac because I believed it to be the cause of my fatigue. I figured the Buprion would keep my mood & energy up on its own.  DEAD WRONG. I became reactive_ aggressive_ angry_ lashing out_ having rageful outbursts...yet i attributed this to my underlying depression itself and stayed the course believing the drug would help me. Excruciating abdominal pain one day. Vision beginning to experience faint tracers_ which is terrifying to me (WTF!!). PRONOUNCED short-term memory loss! Immediately forgetting what I was just about to do or had just done (no thank you!!!). WORD CONFUSION -- I meant to say one word and a random word popping in my mind mid-speech would come out instead (loss of control of one's speech -- GREAT!!!!). CRYING OUTBURSTS began almost immediately even on the","good to feel your feelings_ but...). As so many others have reported_ my DEPRESSION WORSENED. My psych doc (NP) said this was a possibility if I stopped taking the Prozac. **EXTREME** FATIGUE_ IMMOBILITY (""asthenia"") just about THE WORST effect of all. Oh but wait--then there was the creeping DESPAIR_ HOPELESSNESS_ BLEAKNESS AND BORDERLINE SUICIDALITY THE LIKES OF WHICH I'D NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. AND MASSIVELY ACHING ALL OVER. NEVER ACTUALLY FELT ""UP_"" JUST INCREASINGLY DOWN_ DOWN_ DOWN. I_ like many ppl on these sites_ quit cold turkey today. Fearing  withdrawal_ the only difference I've seen_ besides no change yet in the OVERWHELMING FATIGUE_ is a RETURN TO BETTER MOOD AND RESTORED CLARITY. I don't even want to return to Prozac. This was such a HORRENDOUS RE-LIVING OF WORST DEPRESSIVE OVERTAKE that I am determined to restore myself with CARE & RECOVERY. That entails taking the mind/body/soul REST that I need_ tending to my FEELINGS_ and dropping burdens and stressors. More healthful eating & exercise will come as self-love grows to _naturally_ motivate me to further my sense of well being. I will keep the SSRI on the shelf in the event the engulfing phantom of DEPRESSIVE mood disorder returns_ but I am going to cope with my own devices first vs. coping with the comparable roller coaster of medicating this condition.

This drug basically saved my life_ my marriage and my family. It has allowed me to function as a normal member of society for many_ many years.Twice a year_ spring and fall_ I would crash into the lowest depression because of seasonal affective disorder. To this day I am not sure how I survived? After trying a number of different drugs with unacceptable side effects I was put on Wellbutrin and I have never looked back. Yes_ there are side effects but for me they are minimal and easy to live with compared to my drug free life.My heart palpitations/abnormal heart rhythm might be getting a bit worse as I am aging but I do use coffee as well. The heart issues do not bother me physically as I can climb any amount of stairs I wish to climb. I cannot fairly comment on reduced sex drive as I am 60 years old so some of these things happen with age. The unusual dreams are no big deal for me_ they are only dreams after all.

44, 2, depression_ OCD_ anxiety/social,Aggression_rage_ extreme fatigue_ apathetic_ withdrew from social situations_ crying all the time_ inability to concentrate_ migraines with nausea_anxiety_restlessness_ autopilot and boredom. No problem sleeping_ it gave me no energy,I have tried just about every med for depression. The only one that did any good was Paxil and it wasn't enough. I would come home from work and scream at everybody.i didn't realize_ my husband pointed it out to me_ as well as other family members. I just want to feel some sense of normal. It did however_ make me a lil more assertive,F,30,4  months200 mg,1/19/2015Email,Wellbutrin
45, 3, depression,raised dosage two months ago. did stop smoking while on this drug!,"I have noticed I feel more ""assertive"" towards others. Not always a good thing. Not in a bad mood all the time like I was while on 150mg. My sleeping is off schedule but_ I'm used to it now. Not sure about weight loss or gain_ I am on steriods. Was nervous at first about warning of seizures. Haven't had any though. I am glad I am on this. I like it a lot better than pristiq.",F,42,2  months300mg 1X D,1/7/2015,Wellbutrin
46, 4, Depression,Loss of appetite_ increased anxiety_ some restlessness/difficulty sleeping_ constipation_ but the side effects were well worth getting my life back. Increased to 300mg a few months in; side effects worsened but seemed to work. Took it for the second time last year_ only for ~6 months though. I don't think I was feeling that depressed and therefore didn't feel much difference in my mood_ but the side effects were still present.And today,I've been on Wellbutrin XR two separate times. The first time_ started on 150mg and my depression lifted within weeks (this was after nearly a year of failed SSRI treatment - I wish I'd found Wellbutrin sooner). Increased to 300mg a few months in; side effects worsened_ but the antidepressant effect seemed to work. Stayed on for about two years_ then weaned off and was okay without it for a year.That was a year ago. The past month my depression came back full force_ so I went back on it yesterday. Today I was able to get out of bed early for the first time in weeks_ and I am already feeling less hopeless and have more energy. I highly recommend Wellbutrin for anyone whose depression consists of low energy_ increased appetite_ loss of pleasure_ etc.,F,24,2  years150->300 1X D,1/6/2015Email,Wellbutrin

Wonderful in combo with sertraline which removes any jitters and makes me feel at peace centered and muffled the hyper-self-critical superego which is common for driven high achievement people like myself.,M,59,3  years150mg,12/15/2014Email,Wellbutrin

52, 4, Depression (situational),At first I couldn't stay asleep_ but I was taking it before bedtime. Once I switched to mornings_ I was ok. It did seem to make me more agitated at first_ which I'm dealing with high anxiety so I had to offset that reaction with Buspirone (15mg 3x/day) All that was fine_ but what I deal with daily is the feeling that my throat is closing. I feel like someone has their hand around my throat. When my anxiety is high (which can be often) it's even worse. I feel like I can't breathe sometimes or that something is stuck. If it didn't work so well I would get off of it but I deal with this side effect bc I see results.,I tried Celexa & Effexor_ quit both within 1-2 weeks_ the side effects were awful (esp sexual side effects) Wellbutrin I feel gets me out of bed each day. I don't have tons of energy_ still can get groggy by early evening. I haven't had any appetite difference. I do have headaches often but I always have so not sure this is due to the Wellbutrin. I don't have crying episodes like I was. The situation I'm dealing with took a major toll on my personality & mood. I am angry/sad all the time. Have outbursts & crying epdisodes (which are to be expected) but feel they are more manageable as time goes on. I am struggling with the throat issue but dealing bc I think otherwise it works well.,F,40,2  months300 MG 1X D,12/3/2014Email,Wellbutrin

55, 1, depression,Shortly after i started welbutrin i became extremely paranoid_extremely moody_ and stoped sleeping. When i would sleep id wake up at about 3am and stay up all day. At first i couldnt place why i was so paranoid and the feelings i had were very real to me. Welbutrin almost destroyed my relationship with my boyfriend. I started accusing him of cheating_ of not caring and loving me enough. When i play the last six months back in my head i remember my boyfriend telling me that there was something wrong with my thinking and that i had changed. I became very mean to him and wanted to fight day and night sometimes to the point of wanting to b violence_ thank god i never did. I was going crazy. I went from being a very happy loving person to a paranoid angry that never slept and im sure not sleeping made things worse. I thank god my man didnt give up on me even though at times i know he wanted to_ he just kept saying honey there is something wrong with you and you need to figure it out. Well it took me six months to do so and nearly ruined my life. I sat and began to think when it was that i started to change and what i came up with was it all started about the same time i started the welbutrin_ so i got on line and typed in can welbutrin cause paranoia? What i came up with shocked me. All the symptoms i had were right in front of me and as i read othe people's stories i started to cry. I cryed to two reasons one being i was angry that it went on for so long and nobody could tell me,,F,33,6  months300,10/23/2014Email,Wellbutrin
56, 1, Severe depression,"My boyfriend has been taking this drug now for quite some time. At first it seemed to work. He seemed happier_ had a better attitude_ less anger. His concentration level was much better. Everything was going great. But we are now about five months in and I am scared. He is a mess. Wants to sleep all the time. Has completely disconnected himself from me and our children. His anger is back but it is accompanied by a great sense of ""I don't give a f***"". He is foggy headed and very dramatic about how it is that he perceives daily encounters with people. The slightest noises send him over the edge. He wakes up at about two in the morning and stays awake for at least an hour because he can't sleep. He has no pleasure in anything but work (and even the I don't think he is very happy with that). Wants to be alone all the time_ when he is honestly a great people person. He has an appointment to see his doctor in a week_ and because he isn't hurting himself or anyone else (even though I'm scared for him and can't reach him because I am nothing but an annoyance to him at the moment) they won't push the appointment ahead any sooner. Does this sound even remotely close to anything anyone else has experienced on this drug?? I urge STRONG CAUTION in trying any psychiatric medication_ this one_ or any at all_ and proper knowledge of changes to your mental state and how to seek help at the first signs!!! Because as much as the people around you love you_ they can't do it for you!",,M,37,5  months300 mg,10/23/2014Email,Wellbutrin

58, 1, Depression and anxiety,Nausea_ headaches_ severe mood swings (super happy to suicidely depressesed)_ severe sensitivity to sounds- even quiet chatter_ couldn't concentrate_ apathy_ extreme paranoia_ constant need to sleep- even when I wasn't tired_ severe panic attacks that lasted days instead of an hour or two_ constant insomnia_ extreme fluctuations in body temperature_ my feelings shifted from ravenous hunger to vomiting at the thought of food.,Thank god my family was looking out for me and took me back into the doctor. He stopped the Wellbutrin immediately. I thought my anxiety and depression were just overcoming me_ I didn't realize everything I was going through was a severe side effect of the Wellbutrin. I have been off of it for a little over a week and I am finally beginning to feel a bit more normal. I thought I was losing my mind. I have never been so close to checking myself into the hospital for a psychological evaluation before- I was terrified of what was happening to me. I will never take another drug without reading the side effects first. Be careful when taking this medication. Make sure you have someone you trust watching out for any unusual behavioral changes you might experience. For a lot of people this medication works wonders_ but make sure you are discussing any changes in your mood with your doctor.,F,36,5  months50mg 1X D,10/5/2014Email,Wellbutrin
