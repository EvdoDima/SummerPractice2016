0, 5, Depression_ Anxiety_ ADD,Mild nervousness if I don't eat frequenly,It takes about 2 months to see noticeable results. You may become agitated briefly for the first few days. My depression is gone. My anxiety is better. My ADD is better. I have more patience and I'm more social. Since taking Wellbutrin I have started taking yoga_ going to the gym. I have not experienced the weight loss that many do. I think this may be due to being on Vyvanse and losing weight while taking that.,F,46,6  months30 mg,5/31/2016Email,Wellbutrin
1, 1, Smoking cessation,Irrational thoughts. Mood swings_ lack of motivation to high activity. Anger_ frustration.,I started the drug with some trepidation but after a day or two noticed more restful sleep and an increased libido. After a couple weeks I began to question everything around me like there was_this conspiracy against me. My thoughts would swing from general happiness and calm to being suspicious and untrusting.  I lashed out at my wife _ accusing her of being unfaithful creating this whole cheating scenario in my head.  Rational thinking went right out the window. I didn't think delusions were a side effect but they are. My personality is generally confident and good natured but after a few weeks on this drug I find myself feeling insecure and at times emotional. These bad feelings come on out of nowhere and last for a few minutes to a few hours. I'm not taking this drug ever again.,M,48,1  months100mg,5/25/2016,Wellbutrin

5, 4, add_ depression_ smoking cessation,Dry mouth_ a little shaky,I had known I was depressed for some time. My husband and I were fighting about the cleanliness of our home_ couldn't keep kids on a steady schedule_ life was just...chaotic. I know it's only been a week but I can tell a difference. I'm CONSTANTLY cleaning_ dinner at around the same time_ showers and bed routine with kids done before their bedtime_and no fighting with hubby_ and I haven't had a cigarette in 8 days. I'd say it works for me.,F,26,7  days150 mg,3/22/2016,Wellbutrin
6, 5, Depression/Anxiety,When I started this med_ constipation.  That subsides_ and the side effects at 18 months are zero.,I started at 37.5 mg/day_ gradually have worked up to 225 mg/day.  I know too many people have the 150 mg. dumped on them at the start_ and I_ and others I talk to_ have found it works better to ease into this med_ more gradually.  It is a stimulating Antidepressant_ so I combine it with Effexor_ for anxiety_ and I am as pleased as punch.  If you are having problems at the start_ please give any Antidepressant At Least 8 weeks to truly begin to work....at least_ if you truly want to feel its benefits.  If not_ start complaining right away_ and stay miserable.  I wish you the best.,M,57,18  months112.5 2X D,3/12/2016Email,Wellbutrin

Very unattractive and it's something I am constantly having to make an effort to be conscious of and remind myself to smile or smirk. My son pointed it out to me.,When I was 27 this saved my life. I mean literally saved my life. After my post pard. I took it a little over a year but noticed after about 8 months it not working as well. Tried increasing to 400 mg but too many side effects. 6 years later I am trying it again and finding that its having zero effect on me. Its really weird. I swore by this medication and should have been a spokesman for it with the way I recommended to anyone I knew struggling. I am in the process of finding something that can help me as much as wellbutrin did so many years ago. Trying Lexapro now and it works very well But it doesnt give me that boost to get out andbe social and do stuff like wellbutrin did. So I am still searching. But I would still recommend for a first time patient.,F,27,1  years300mg,2/16/2016,Wellbutrin
11, 5, Smoking Cessation,Transient insomnia_ anxiety_ xerostomia_ a sensation of 'pressure behind the eyes',I took Zyban to stop smoking some years ago. It worked_ and worked well. Cravings were significantly reduced and I derived no pleasure from cigarettes anymore. I quit within a week of starting it_ and never looked back!Six years later_ I smoked something that I didn't know contained tobacco. I started smoking again. This time got generic Wellbutrin. Within 3 days_ I doubled up to the 300 mg. does for smoking cessation. That night_ after dinner_ I felt like a train hit me. Felt almost unreal_ on the verge of panic for hours.Moral of the story - stick with the name brand and you will have a much better experience_ as the drug will be released slowly into your system!,M,36,90  days150 2X D,2/12/2016Email,Wellbutrin

No enteric coatingon the generics_ means the generics dump all the drugs into your system in the first few hours_ leaving you in the gutter.

18, 1, Depression,I'm going INSANE. I was originally on 150 mg and started to feel really bad_ my worst symptom at that time was anhedonia (not caring about anything). All I felt was sadness and loneliness_ even with my boyfriend_ friends_ and family. It didn't even cross my mind that it could be the Wellbutrin because my side effects coincided with some negative things that happened to me. So because I was feeling so low_ a week ago my psych changed my dosage to 300 mg. And it seriously feels like I'm dying. I can't eat_ I forced myself to today but yesterday all I could stomach was a handful of trail mix. I can't sleep_ even though I take sleeping medication. I'm rapid cycling through moments of severe depression and occasional moments of what I would probably call mania. Yesterday I was semi-delirious because I didn't eat and hadn't slept_ and severely paranoid. I kept picturing that an earthquake was about to happen_ and then I kept experiencing it over and over in my head. My psych is weaning me off of it completely right now_ 5 more days to go_ and the end of this nightmare can't come fast enough. I'm praying these days fly by.,,F,22,3  weeks300 mg,12/2/2015Email,Wellbutrin
19, 5, Depression,Dizziness at first_ continued dry mouth_ anger_ anxiety for first two years until dosage was increased_ loss of appetite_ decreased alcohol consumption_ weight loss-losing more muscle than fat_ out of breath with any physical activity_ occasional bruxism_ mild headache sometimes_ very slight increase in libido_ tremors,"I started Wellbutrin in May 2013 at 300mg. There was no titration from 150 to 300_ and that's when the side effects really kicked in. I had horrible dizziness to the point the room was spinning_ hands shook so bad it looked like I had Parkinson's. Two years later I found that I wasn't as motivated to do anything_ whether around the house_ work or even activities I used to love. Within the 2 years I had several angry outbursts_ road rage_ and heart beating fast (+ 110). I asked my doc if we could try 450mg in late October. What a game changer. I used to drink a lot on the 300mg-12-14 beers everyday (please no lecturing). The beer went to my head really fast- slight buzz after 1_ feeling like I had 5 after 2 beers. I didn't really feel hungover like I was in my 20's_ but just a very mild headache. Surprisingly enough_ when I upped to 450mg_ the desire for alcohol has dropped to half_ but has been as low 1 day to 4.  The anger has subsided_ my mood is way more relaxed_ I continuously clean my house- to the point of getting rid of things I haven't looked at in 20 years. Bathroom is spotless_ and kitchen clean too. My production at work is increased- I'm now getting projects completed before my boss gets upset. Drinking a lot of water due to very dry mouth. I haven't noticed much a libido increase but I will have to admit_ I have read the reviews on Wellbutrin several times_ and wanted to experience the ""off the charts"" horny feeling but it never happened to that exten",M,59,2.5  years300+150 1X D,12/1/2015Email,Wellbutrin

21, 3, Severe Depression,I was on wellbutrin XL 300mg for 6 years. After 3 years I started having extreme woozy/lightheaded spells that were ruining my life. Everyone kept blaming it on my anxiety. After three years of hating life I went off of wellbutrin. It took over 30 days before I even started to see relief_ but by the 90 day mark I was free from those spells. I have my life back. It would not have gone away. Wellbutrin helps with the kind of depression where you have NO motivation and crave sugar. It will make you dehydrated_ constipated_ edgy_ and a light sleeper that only needs about 6 hours per night. It isn't good for anxiety and will not help it. During the adjustment period you could lose about 10 lbs and have the most vivid nightmares ever. This drug will stop working for you. At first you can be so numb but after awhile you start to feel very depressed again. It's not until you go off of it do you realize that it was helping.

25, 1, depression/anxiety,abdominal pain_ diarrhea_ insomnia_ loss of appetite_ nervousness_ tinnitus_ dry mouth_ heart palpitations_ weight loss,I had taken this medication 8 years ago and had no side effects from it. This time though I had a negative experience with this med. I had constant diarrhea_ 3-4 times a day. I had a loss of appetite and had gotten to the point that I couldn't stand to even think about food. Thinking about what to eat or fix for my family actually caused anxiety. I lost 10 lbs in 9 nine days. About the 5th or 6th day I started to be unable to sleep during the night. I woke up every hour. During the day I would have waves of nervous energy_ almost like the feeling you get when you experience the fight or flight response. The last day I took it I woke up at 4 am with diarrhea_ left sided abdominal pain that radiated to my back and shoulder_ and heart palpitations. A trip to the ER revealed that I had a large amount of stool and gas in my colon. I had a miserable experience with Wellbutrin.,F,39,9  days150 XL 1X D,7/18/2015,Wellbutrin
26, 1, Major Depression,"Started with 150 XR generic to ""augment"" Prozac (40-60 mg daily for ~2 yrs)_ not exactly sure why I was even looking for a boost -- undergoing significant extra stress_ in summary. I asked to increase to 300 mg within a week or two ... again_ not quite sure why. To intensify its expected ""feel good"" effect_ I guess. Knowing it is a dopamine enhancer_ I was aware it would stimulate pleasure centers formerly activated by drugs and alcohol. In short_ it does indeed appear to be a faux cocaine_ although the high wasn't near even the rather lame high of cocaine yet the adverse effects were strikingly similar if not yet out and out as dangerous. Within two weeks of 300 mg XR_ I quit taking Prozac because I believed it to be the cause of my fatigue. I figured the Buprion would keep my mood & energy up on its own.  DEAD WRONG. I became reactive_ aggressive_ angry_ lashing out_ having rageful outbursts...yet i attributed this to my underlying depression itself and stayed the course believing the drug would help me. Excruciating abdominal pain one day. Vision beginning to experience faint tracers_ which is terrifying to me (WTF!!). PRONOUNCED short-term memory loss! Immediately forgetting what I was just about to do or had just done (no thank you!!!). WORD CONFUSION -- I meant to say one word and a random word popping in my mind mid-speech would come out instead (loss of control of one's speech -- GREAT!!!!). CRYING OUTBURSTS began almost immediately even on the","good to feel your feelings_ but...). As so many others have reported_ my DEPRESSION WORSENED. My psych doc (NP) said this was a possibility if I stopped taking the Prozac. **EXTREME** FATIGUE_ IMMOBILITY (""asthenia"") just about THE WORST effect of all. Oh but wait--then there was the creeping DESPAIR_ HOPELESSNESS_ BLEAKNESS AND BORDERLINE SUICIDALITY THE LIKES OF WHICH I'D NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. AND MASSIVELY ACHING ALL OVER. NEVER ACTUALLY FELT ""UP_"" JUST INCREASINGLY DOWN_ DOWN_ DOWN. I_ like many ppl on these sites_ quit cold turkey today. Fearing  withdrawal_ the only difference I've seen_ besides no change yet in the OVERWHELMING FATIGUE_ is a RETURN TO BETTER MOOD AND RESTORED CLARITY. I don't even want to return to Prozac. This was such a HORRENDOUS RE-LIVING OF WORST DEPRESSIVE OVERTAKE that I am determined to restore myself with CARE & RECOVERY. That entails taking the mind/body/soul REST that I need_ tending to my FEELINGS_ and dropping burdens and stressors. More healthful eating & exercise will come as self-love grows to _naturally_ motivate me to further my sense of well being. I will keep the SSRI on the shelf in the event the engulfing phantom of DEPRESSIVE mood disorder returns_ but I am going to cope with my own devices first vs. coping with the comparable roller coaster of medicating this condition.

This drug basically saved my life_ my marriage and my family. It has allowed me to function as a normal member of society for many_ many years.Twice a year_ spring and fall_ I would crash into the lowest depression because of seasonal affective disorder. To this day I am not sure how I survived? After trying a number of different drugs with unacceptable side effects I was put on Wellbutrin and I have never looked back. Yes_ there are side effects but for me they are minimal and easy to live with compared to my drug free life.My heart palpitations/abnormal heart rhythm might be getting a bit worse as I am aging but I do use coffee as well. The heart issues do not bother me physically as I can climb any amount of stairs I wish to climb. I cannot fairly comment on reduced sex drive as I am 60 years old so some of these things happen with age. The unusual dreams are no big deal for me_ they are only dreams after all.

46, 4, Depression,Loss of appetite_ increased anxiety_ some restlessness/difficulty sleeping_ constipation_ but the side effects were well worth getting my life back. Increased to 300mg a few months in; side effects worsened but seemed to work. Took it for the second time last year_ only for ~6 months though. I don't think I was feeling that depressed and therefore didn't feel much difference in my mood_ but the side effects were still present.And today,I've been on Wellbutrin XR two separate times. The first time_ started on 150mg and my depression lifted within weeks (this was after nearly a year of failed SSRI treatment - I wish I'd found Wellbutrin sooner). Increased to 300mg a few months in; side effects worsened_ but the antidepressant effect seemed to work. Stayed on for about two years_ then weaned off and was okay without it for a year.That was a year ago. The past month my depression came back full force_ so I went back on it yesterday. Today I was able to get out of bed early for the first time in weeks_ and I am already feeling less hopeless and have more energy.

52, 4, Depression (situational),At first I couldn't stay asleep_ but I was taking it before bedtime. Once I switched to mornings_ I was ok. It did seem to make me more agitated at first_ which I'm dealing with high anxiety so I had to offset that reaction with Buspirone (15mg 3x/day) All that was fine_ but what I deal with daily is the feeling that my throat is closing. I feel like someone has their hand around my throat. When my anxiety is high (which can be often) it's even worse. I feel like I can't breathe sometimes or that something is stuck. If it didn't work so well I would get off of it but I deal with this side effect bc I see results.,I tried Celexa & Effexor_ quit both within 1-2 weeks_ the side effects were awful (esp sexual side effects) Wellbutrin I feel gets me out of bed each day. I don't have tons of energy_ still can get groggy by early evening. I haven't had any appetite difference. I do have headaches often but I always have so not sure this is due to the Wellbutrin. I don't have crying episodes like I was. The situation I'm dealing with took a major toll on my personality & mood. I am angry/sad all the time. Have outbursts & crying epdisodes (which are to be expected) but feel they are more manageable as time goes on.

55, 1, depression,Shortly after i started welbutrin i became extremely paranoid_extremely moody_ and stoped sleeping. When i would sleep id wake up at about 3am and stay up all day. At first i couldnt place why i was so paranoid and the feelings i had were very real to me. Welbutrin almost destroyed my relationship with my boyfriend. I started accusing him of cheating_ of not caring and loving me enough. When i play the last six months back in my head i remember my boyfriend telling me that there was something wrong with my thinking and that i had changed. I became very mean to him and wanted to fight day and night sometimes to the point of wanting to b violence_ thank god i never did. I was going crazy. I went from being a very happy loving person to a paranoid angry that never slept and im sure not sleeping made things worse. I thank god my man didnt give up on me even though at times i know he wanted to_ he just kept saying honey there is something wrong with you and you need to figure it out. Well it took me six months to do so and nearly ruined my life. I sat and began to think when it was that i started to change and what i came up with was it all started about the same time i started the welbutrin_ so i got on line and typed in can welbutrin cause paranoia? What i came up with shocked me. All the symptoms i had were right in front of me and as i read othe people's stories i started to cry.

56, 1, Severe depression,"My boyfriend has been taking this drug now for quite some time. At first it seemed to work. He seemed happier_ had a better attitude_ less anger. His concentration level was much better. Everything was going great. But we are now about five months in and I am scared. He is a mess. Wants to sleep all the time. Has completely disconnected himself from me and our children. His anger is back but it is accompanied by a great sense of ""I don't give a f***"". He is foggy headed and very dramatic about how it is that he perceives daily encounters with people. The slightest noises send him over the edge. He wakes up at about two in the morning and stays awake for at least an hour because he can't sleep. He has no pleasure in anything but work (and even the I don't think he is very happy with that). Wants to be alone all the time_ when he is honestly a great people person. He has an appointment to see his doctor in a week_ and because he isn't hurting himself or anyone else (even though I'm scared for him and can't reach him because I am nothing but an annoyance to him at the moment) they won't push the appointment ahead any sooner. Does this sound even remotely close to anything anyone else has experienced on this drug?? I urge STRONG CAUTION in trying any psychiatric medication_ this one_ or any at all_ and proper knowledge of changes to your mental state and how to seek help at the first signs!!!

He stopped the Wellbutrin immediately. I thought my anxiety and depression were just overcoming me_ I didn't realize everything I was going through was a severe side effect of the Wellbutrin. I have been off of it for a little over a week and I am finally beginning to feel a bit more normal. I thought I was losing my mind. I have never been so close to checking myself into the hospital for a psychological evaluation before- I was terrified of what was happening to me. I will never take another drug without reading the side effects first. Be careful when taking this medication.

My doctor decided to switch me to the generic of wellbutrin.  I also take meds for hypothyroidism.  I started with 150 mg for the first three days and the first day I didn't feel any different. I could already start to feel the effects by the second day...And they were not good. Once I moved up to 300mg of felt absolutely awful. I was nervous and my whole body felt jittery.  I could not sleep for about the first two weeks...And eating? Well forget about it! I was constantly sick to my stomach and would throw up several times a day. With in the first two weeks I lost 10lbs. I had horrible constipation_ but I will spare the details! My head felt like it was in a constant fog and I couldn't focus in anything. It also gave me horrible headaches. I know it can take a while for an antidepressant to work so I'm trying to hold out. My doc lowered my dose back to 150 mg a day_ but I am still throwing up atleast once a day. My moods are crazy! Sometimes I just want to cry all day_ and other days I am just plain mean. I just want to feel normal again!! My doctor said we might have to change my meds again_ and that terrifies me because that means hell starts all over again.

I had severe anxiety_ started clenching my jaw constantly (had to get a mouth guard to keep from grinding my teeth at night)_ and the tension gave me a headache that only vicodin helped soothe.

While SSRI's let me get a good nights sleep_ felt a little zombi-like_ and made it almost impossible to orgasm.  Wellbutrin also normalizes my sleep_ and ability to orgasm is back to normal.  I know Wellbutrin is leveling my sleep_ because I have tried to stop several times over the years_ and my sleep very quickly goes to insomnia.    150mg stops me from hopeless crying_ and improves my depression down to low_ from medium_ but does not cure it entirely.  When I tried 200mg_ I started to feel buzzed and agitated.  Went back to 150.   Did not experience any headache on Wellbutrin_ but a constant killer headache on Effexor.  I started this journey 15 years ago with panic attacks and Zoloft to stop them.  As soon as I got a stable nights sleep_ panic attacks stopped_ and my dispair improved.

Since wellbutrin I've cried maybe 2-3 times in 3 yrs and over an appropriate event.  I'm able to let arguments and mean things people say or do only mildly upset me.

What I have noticed is that the constant anxiety I was having is either gone or muted....as in_ I can feel that there is anxiety there but it is not affecting me. I am having less suicidal feelings and thoughts since starting this medication. My feelings of extreme hopelessness have mostly disappeared. I have eliminated caffeine from my diet because it seems to cause anxiety symptoms & I am not a big drinker of alcohol but I have had no issues with the occasional social drink. Overall_ this drug is working well for me so far. My depression and anxiety are both long term health issues and situational.

It takes two Ibuprofen and two naproxen together to get rid of them. Dizziness is another problem. I thought the headaches would go away after a couple of weeks_ but they haven't. Sometimes I have to skip a day just to have a pain free day. At first_ my concentration and energy was off the charts_ but now I'm really apathetic and have no energy at all_ but can't sleep at night.

Also_ while I wasn't taking it for smoking cessation_ it naturally made me smoke considerably less because the desire for smoking just didnt enter my mind nearly as often.Having used drugs recreationally in the past_ I was really wanting to 'feel' Wellbutrin right away... like popping a percocet_ but of course that wasnt the case. You will notice the benefit of this drug in retrospect_ i.e. ""wow I drove 50 miles in total silence with the radio off (its usually ALWAYS on to keep my mind calm) and didn't get pissed off at a single driver!"". This NEVER would have happened without Wellbutrin. Its just a small example... Ive also noticed  much calmer demeanor in general_ increased energy_ more of a desire to do stuff (randomly clean the house_ pick up after myself_ and ""care"" about how my house looks--being so depressed I never have anyone over so its nice to see that I care more about improving my surroundings for my own benefit).",,M,32,3  weeks150x2/day,8/18/2012Email,Wellbutrin

I sometimes have a hard time sleeping_ and my appetite is very low. I may be agitated sometimes_ but overall my mood is better. It took me a couple of months to quit smoking_ but I finally did.

I also was lucky I was next to a sink about 7.5 hours after my first few doses because my stomach convulsed so hard & fast_ I projectile vomited for a half a second & then it was over_ like it never happened! I thought_ 'WHOA! Where did THAT come from!?' I decided to stick with it because people who have that honeymoon experience will generally be helped by the drug & stabilize a few weeks into treatment. I also experienced a 4 PM crash but that went away when I started the 2nd dose started after the 3rd day.",This is the 2nd time I tried it. The 1st time the initial effects of it scared me & I quit before I got to experience the benefits. I also came to this site after googling my side-effects & this site is actually what made me overreact. I think that sites like these can contribute to people's anxiety & fear. This time I will hang in there. Anything's better than being depressed! Just give it the appropriate length of time & DON'T PLAY INTERNET DOCTOR! Just relax...  It's not a drug being pushed by sales reps right now_ so I'm sure if your doctor prescribes this_ it's because he/she thinks it will help.

I lived a dream for about a year.  No depression whatsoever.  Things that were normally such a chore for me to do were no longer an issue.  Just living day to day was a joy.  I had loads of energy_ and at times was asked if I was on major doses of caffeine_ as I was extremely hyper.  I actually enjoyed feeling that way.  After about a year_ it seemed to stop working alltogether.  I decided to stay on it for another year_ but decided recently to get off.  For the past  8 to 9 months I have been extremely paranoid - to the extent that I actually confronted a man on the bus I ride thinking he was getting ready to blow up the bus (who does that?!).  I have slept on my couch for fear of someone breaking and entering and harming me and my child.  I'm bound by fear of everything and everyone.  The last couple of days I have had uncontrolled anger to the point of actually screaming and beating my fists against objects.

I couldn't perform athletically like I did before taking the med--became winded after 10-15 minutes. Poor memory. No change in not feeling anything/experience any joy. All of that changed after 5-6th week.Currently--No longer sad or angry. Regained some focus at work. Being more proactive in my life and making choices. Lost 13 lbs so far. I still cant really perform where I used to athletically--I get winded so fast and my heart races uncontrollably. Over the past week I have experienced constant nauseousness. I fall asleep generally within 20 minutes (used to take hours). I get up better in the morning. It has made my periods change a little_ nothing drastic or for the worse..just different. I have been experiencing some head-cold like sensations in my head the past few days (unsure if it has to do with the me,I haven't had any bad reactions when having alcoholic drinks on this med. I do get buzzed after one or two drinks now (where I used to drink 3-5 on average)_ so if anyhting it has limited my social drinking. The only weird thing I can say has changed_ is I remember everything visually_ but I can't remember much mentally. It's so weird!

Also_ when falling asleep one of two things tended to happen: 1) I'd feel weird and the world didn't seem real_ and felt I was crazy and was always crazy and would never stop being crazy_ 2) Nightmares_ really bad nightmares right as I would fall asleep.  Vivid too; I woke up one time convinced that I had been raped.  About an hour later I looked back and realized I've never been raped before--that made me feel really weird_ lol.Small muscle twitches when awake too.  Tense muscles.

Also_ for IR users_ morning and lunch time are good times to take it_ but if you can_ avoid night time.

Until last tuesday when_ while having an important meeting with some colleagues_ I had a grand mal seizure lasting from one to two minutes. I have never had a seizure before. After going to the hospital and having a complete work-up it has been decided that it was the wellbutrin that caused the seizure. I smashed my face up_ bit my tounge so hard that I cannot speak! It was a terrifying experience and I have since learned that it is not all that uncommon especially with people taking the generic extended release. I was happy with the results I was getting with wellbutrin until the seizure of corse. I would like to hear from others who have had seizures from this drug.

141, 4, Major Depression,Weight loss_ VERY vivid and unusual dreams_ and slight insomnia. This drug takes about 3 weeks to kick in and feel the full affects. In my opinion_ this drug has helped a great deal for me and I've tried other drugs to help my depression. Its not a miracle pill and there is not such thing. But it definitely helps take off the edge and helps me think logically. Before this medication I felt alone and felt as if it was the end of the world.. Even when little things happen. This pill made me realize that anything is fixable and I do fix it. It may not work for everyone but it worked a great deal for me.

143, 2, Depression ADD,Wellbutrin XL 150Heart Palpitations InsomniaHeadacheConstipation,I really enojoyed the positive benefits of the drug such as improved focus_ overall positive attitude about myself and the world around me_ extra sensitivity and enhanced sexual pleasure.However the palpitations that occurred on day 4 made me decide to quit.  I noticed some uncomfortable palpitations in the morning_ I took some deep breaths and they stopped for a while.  Then about an hour later_ the palpitations started up again.  I had some food and the palpitations occurred_ I had a drink of water and the palpitations occurred.  I took a walk around the building and noticed palpitations.  If I saw a sexy woman_ the palpitations occurred.  I normally drink lots of coffee (7-8 cups a day) and never have palpitations.  The last time I felt palpitations like this was after I did a line of a cocaine at a party 5 years ago.     This drug produces a high like cocaine or metamphetamine.  It might be fun to take if you're at home screwing around or out at a party.  It made me feel really sociable_ horny_ focused_ and smart.  I had some serious hard ons that lasted for about 20 minutes.  But I can't be having palpitations all day at work so I'm stopping tomorrow. I'd rather be depressed and unproductive at work.If they could make Wellbutrin that didn't cause palpitations or insomnia_ I'd be all over it.,M,37,4  days150 1X D,2/21/2012,Wellbutrin

Racing thoughts_ shakes_ nausea_ night sweats_ dizziness_ ears clogged_ ringing in ears_ trouble concentrating_ insomnia - constantly.  D/C'd Ativan and started BuSpar 7.5 mg. twice a day.  Symptoms worsened.  Thought it was the BuSpar_ so decreased to 7.5 mg. daily (1/2 tab in a.m._ 1/2 tab in p.m.) Symptoms continued.  Went back to doctor and she changed it from Wellbutrin XL 150 mg. to Wellbutrin SR 100_ once a day.  Instead of getting 150 mg. over 24 hour period_ I was now getting 100 mg. over 12 hours period.  Could actually feel Wellbutrin peak after 6 hours (shakes increased).  Ended up in ER for psych evaluation.  On-call psych said to stop Wellbutrin immediately.  Been in withdrawal all week - bad. Hard to decrease Wellbutrin as tabs are either extended release or slow release_ so you can't break tabs or you'll get full dose as they dissolve.  Lowest dosage of XL is 150 mg. Lowest dosage of SR is 75 mg.  Have been off work all week.  Felt a little better after 3 days_ but not 100% yet.  Will be under care of a psychiatrist.  Will never trust general practicianer for these type of meds again.

163, 4, Depression,I first took this years ago at high doses (150 mg or more)_ and this made me agitated and irritable.  But trying only 75 mg per day made the difference.,You have to work to get the dosage right.  Too many drs start people at a high dose when they are sensitive to meds as I am.  My current dr was wise enough to try a baby dose_ then said I can step up if I choose.  I did once step up to 150_ but went back down because 150 mg is too much for me. You can't always tell by weight how someone is going to respond because I'm average weight.  I can't take SSRIs or SNRIs because of nausea_ lack of sex drive_ feeling lethargic_ etc.  This drug doesn't cause any of those nasty effects for me_ just have to deal with the stimulating effect_ which is sometimes a good thing because depression makes me lethargic in itself.

So_ after a month of Celexa_ my doc switched me right over to Wellbutrin 150mg 2x per day_ so 300 mg/day.  After about a week_ I began to feel sluggish during the day.  As I sit here_ when I close my eyes_ they burn as if I'm exhausted.  Slight dizziness when I move around.  But_ I really dislike this feeling of sluggishness and fatigue.  While I'd love to lose 5 lbs_ I haven't seen any improvement_ possibly gained an lb or 2.  My mom is a nurse and suggested I try it with prozac.  I will have to ask my doctor.  I feel discouraged because I don't want to feel the ups and downs while trying to find what works.  I've never taken these type of meds and thought it would help mellow me out and not so wound up over things.  I am not depressed_ but literally needed a chill pill - but not if it's going to make me feel this tired every day.  This tired,I would invite someone to contact me to let me know if these side effects are worth waiting longer or should I try something else?  I just want to find what works for me: less anxiety_ no weight gain_ no lethargy.  Does such a thing exist?

Besides extreme exhaustion_ the major side effect of suddenly stopping that I have experienced is that I cannot stop eating CANDY.... seriously_ anything with sugar.  Non-stop.  I even went out at 1am last night to buy candy when I had eaten all that I had in the house.  I've never had any issues with food and I am in the low/average weight range.

When I ifrst took Wellbutrin_ I took Brand Wellbutrin and it worked for me.  When I lost my job and had no insurance_ I could not afford the Brand_ so I took a generic buproprion (Teva) and I had multiple TERRIBLE side effects with the GENERIC.  If I had not had BRAND Wellbutrin before_ I would have rated Wellbutrin as a terrible drug.  I gave up the generic by Teva and so dd several of my friends_ with the same reactions of inappropriate rage_ short temper_ panic attacks and strange dreams.  I think this site should make a CLEAR distinction between Wellbutrin and generic Buproprion for purposes of reviewm and the Brand Wellbutrin and the various generics should be reviewed separately.  I don't know if any other generic buproprion exists or would be better.  There was no pharmacist in our entire city area that used anything BUT the Teva brand generic.,I got the plain tablets_ not extended release_ because I do not always take the same dose.  I start about Labor Day with 1 75 mg. tablet a day_ going to 2 tablets as days get shorter and 3 tablets through the darkest days of winter.  Oddly enough_ although one would think it would be a stimulant_ if I forget to take my suppertime dose_ I slip into a comfortable insomnia and can stay on the computer most of the night.  If I take the Wellbutrin at dinner as I am supposed to_ somewhere around midnight my body just announces it is sleepy time and if I don't give in and go to bed_ I will fall asleep at the computer.,F,67,2  years75 3X D,5/4/2011Email,Wellbutrin

182, 3, Anxiety/Seasonal bipolar,Loss of breath_ increased blood pressure_ chest tightness_ dizziness_ loss of appetite_ weight loss_ menstrual changes_ panic attacks_ sweating episodes,My doctor started me on 150 mg to try out and all was great the first few days. I had so much energy and nothing bothered me at all. After about a week_ my menstrual cycle started 2 weeks early and now I have it again when I'm supposed to get it (I am on birth control too) and I also felt like I hit a wall. I couldn't get up the stairs and once I did_ I had to stop and catch my breath. This is not normal for me since I am a zumba dancer and can handle intense cardio workouts. I called my doctor immediately and she decreased the dose to 75 mg. The lack of breath isn't as bad_ but I am still lacking energy. Nothing seems to bother me_ but I also don't feel like doing anything. I had one panic attack on the higher dose and have not had one since.

183, 1, depression and anxiety,anxiety_ depression_ agoraphobia_ panic attacks_ paranoia,My first shrink put me on this drug. When I started taking it_ I felt fine - then the side effects kicked in. For 2 years I was completely agoraphobic. I could NOT leave my house to do something as simple as getting the mail from the box on the side of the house. I begged my doctor to take me off this drug - he REFUSED - he just prescribed Valium  and told me the side effects would be tolerable over time. LOL!!!! I lost 30 lbs in a month because of the valium. Anything I ate came out immediately afterward. Being young (23 y/o) and uninformed_ I did what I was told. I lost 2 years of my life because of this drug.I had 2 small children at the time and I missed 2 years of their childhood!!!  It wasn't until I found a new shrink that I was finally taken off of it. It was then that I finally got a medication that worked and no side effects! I will NEVER listen to another doctor or take this medication ever again! ,F,43,2  years200 1X D,3/14/2011Email,Wellbutrin

I expected them to linger for a few mos but they never went away. I ALWAYS have dry mouth so I just carry bottled water with me. Sleep has been a challenge but my main complaint is lack of focus & trouble with memory retrieval. The leg cramps are not frequent but very bothersome when I have them. This is what finally seems to work well for me: 450mg Wellbutrin and 400mg Lamictal_ .5mg Clonazepam and Ambien for sleep. I've been using this site for years. I found it very helpful so I want to contribute back so other people can benefit from my experience. It was a relief to know that there were other people who experienced the same symptoms. I know the side effects can be discouraging but I would take the side effects any day to avoid one of my episodes of depression or having anxiety attacks.

The doctor told me that sometimes you can become tolerant to this drug_ so the dose was upped a week ago to 300mg XL. I am starting to feel the same energy from the first dose. Headaches again_ dizziness_ nausea. The side effects are worth the gains if I can actually get out of bed and do my school work_ clean the house_ and get laundry & dishes done. I won't go to 450MG because of the increased incidences of seizures_ so here's hoping that 300 is enough.

Doctors routinely tell patients to go up to 300mg after a few weeks or a month or two. It's important to wait at least 4 months before increasing dose. I went up to 300mg after 1 year. Wellbutrin slowly eradicated my 10 year dysthymia which has been remarkable. I stopped drinking when I started taking it. This is also crucial.

The 150 set me off like a rocket the first day. The 300mg I just wanted to curl up in my bed and hide out or just jump out of myself. I also had all the side effects above but they were even worse. So my doctor said I am probably really sensitive to meds and I need to ease into this drug. Once I switched back to 150mg after a few days I was totally fine. I am able to sleep and focus and I'm not feeling so nutty. I think with wellbutrin people are thrown into high dosages way too quickly. I really think it's a drug that you need to gradually build up on. Also sometimes sleeping aids make you moody so I'm not sure if it's the best mix to balance your emotions.

Effexor changed my eye sight and made me paranoid_ and Paxil created a chemical bipolar change which caused hallucinations.  Wellbutrin has not made me gain weight_ which I love since I am trying to lose weight.

The first 3 weeks I took it I wasn't so sure...I was shaky and couldn't sleep much and felt like I was on some sort of serious drugs. That wore off for the most part.

I switched off Lexapro 10 mg because of drowsiness and appetite increase; I was really optimistic about Wellbutrin but so far it has not been what I thought it would be. I am also on Yaz and a small dose of Adderall so I'm not sure if the interactions of these drugs are making me feel this way but if these side effects do not reside I'm going to be extremely disappointed. I felt like Wellbutrin was my last hope being that it's not an SSRI and is for depression. I can also feel my anxiety gradually increasing.... something I really really do not need.

I have been on it for over 2 years_ and it has really helped me. Initially I had some minor issues compared to the benefits. When I am really stressed_ it does seem to amp up my anxiety. Nonetheless_ I think it is a wonder drug. 2 years later_ I have no side effects--other than the anxiety sometimes that I mentioned (which I had before). Doc just prescribed 20 mg (which I cut in half_ so 10 mg) Selexa to go on top for the week before my period_ and that has been great too. I may see if I could take this combo all the time. Anyway_ switched from Zoloft because I had no sex drive_ and my weight would not budge.ONE PRECAUTION--DO NOT TAKE THE GENERIC. I switched for two months and thought I was going insane because all my depression symptoms came back. I did research_ and it turns out that though the generic WellbutrinXL (Bupropion) has the same ingredients_ the timed release part is not monitored or regulated by the FDA. Thus_ I would be fine in the morning but a mess by the afternoon. Stick to the brand name for sure!,F,36,2  years300XL 1X D,6/16/2010Email,Wellbutrin

(and some background to judge this review - paranoia_ health issues and depression are NOT my normal state - started taking this MED with Concerta as issues came up in marital counseling about ADD.

The first day I felt slightly speedy_ but I welcomed this feeling since I am normally lethargic and unmotivated to do anything.  The entire first week was AMAZING!  I felt free from a mental prison I had been locked in for so many years.  I was able to feel happiness_ to focus_ and to get a lot of basic things accomplished (which my ADD wouldn't allow me to do before).  It has also done miraculous things to my body in such a short amount of time:  It gave me energy to be active throughout the day_ it made my digestive problems (acid reflux and Irritable Bowel Syndrome) completely disappear_ and it has cleared and softened my skin tremendously.   I have high hopes that this is the right medication for me.  The increased sex drive and double strength orgasms are a bonus!,Today is my ninth day on this drug and I'm slightly worried because I've noticed some depression the past two days.   I suffer from intensely emotional PMS and should be starting any day now_ so I'm HOPING that this slump will pass and I'll feel that vibrancy and happiness again.

I wish I had tried it a lot sooner.  The main benefit I've noticed is that my thoughts don't spiral downward anymore.  I used to have suicidal thoughts at least a few times a week_ and I haven't had them at all since I started taking Wellbutrin.  Getting up in the mornings has been easier too.

No more suicidal thoughts! Went on because of an episodal depression--I'm not normally depressed.

I'm tired of this and am going to talk to her very seriously next month about helping me get off of this. I feel like my personality has been sucked out of my right ear and it's NOT because of depression. It is so difficult to get adjusted to for the first month that I'm afraid to go off cold-turkey--I think I could end up hurting myself or someone else. So I need her help in tapering off in the best way possible.

I am wary of telling my psychiatrist about the rash on my hand because I fear she will take me off of the drug.

Furthermore_ I hope/think that after time_ I will become immune to whatever is causing the rash on my hand_ and following that_ the rash will disappear. All in all_ I am a fan of the drug. I feel that I am generally happier_ more hopeful for the future_ more confident in myself_ and more productive of a person. I no longer feel like I am alone in the world_ or that there is very little I can do to get myself out of this depressive slump.

It also made me HORRIBLY constipated_ and I have never been constipated before in my life.  I couldn't sleep well and was foggy.  I stopped taking it and everything went back to 'normal'.  Then I heard about people taking the brand_ and so I ordered the brand name drug instead (cost 40$ instead of 10$ for the co-pay) and I have not been constipated_ or violent and can sleep relatively well.  It is criminal that the generic is so disgustingly bad.  If you have had horrible side effects from Wellbutrin try the brand name.

Eating made me feel like puking_ I couldn't eat more than a spoonful or two a day and had no appetite at all.  I also could not get to sleep_ and was never tired!  I guess it's a good drug if you wanna lose weight and get a lot of work done_ but people are going to think you're an addict because you wont be able to disguise your anxiety.

273, 5, Depression/withdrawal from Adderall,Insomnia_ unable to dull or escape racing thoughts_ extreme depression if taking in conjunction with any Rx form of amphetamine_ or even coffee.,"The first few days were HORRIBLE but that was mainly because I was still weaning off of Adderall.  Once I wasn't taking any additional ""speed""_ I started to notice the Wellbutrin working quite well.  Honestly_ Wellburtin saved my life!  I was coming off of Adderall for the 5th or 6th (and FINAL) time and I wasn't sure I could pull through this one.  My shotgun was loaded and ready for that one morning when the alarm clock went off and I couldn't stand the all-encompassing anguish anymore.  Adderall withdrawal is the darkest_ most harrowing and wrenching detox I have ever been through_ tremendously worse than opiates and xanax.  I had been (and still am) taking Zoloft for depression_ but once Adderall is in your body it overpowers everything else and quickly drives you off the deep end.  No matter how horrible your brain feels on it_ you NEED it to survive.  Anyhow...back to Wellbutrin.  I had read about it and thought it couldn't hurt so I asked my doc about it.  I literally was at the end of my rope.  He thought it was a good idea so he prescribed it to me.  After two days on it I didn't NEED Adderall to get through the day!!  I soon found out that I couldn't drink coffee or do any caffeine either_ but it is a fair trade!  I've also been taking less Tramadols each day and I am almost off of them as well!  I never imagined a smoother or quicker withdrawal from such a suicide-inducing drug and I am very grateful.

This page is for the immediate release ONLY_ which is normally taken 3x/day. Anyway.... I take the 3x/day because I can pull in the timing of the dosing as early as possible and have less chance of insomnia.

It did help somewhat_ but now I had a host of new side effects. Worse one being bad rashes where ever you tend to sweat. Another one is things smell weird (mostly bad) Does it increase your sense of smell? If so_ there are lots of bad smells out there and I shower every day. I also found myself wandering around all the time looking for my car keys etc. I never had this problem and once I stopped taking the Wellbutrin memory improved greatly. I have been off it for 3 weeks now_ rashes are still there_ not quite as bad but still a problem. Sore muscles was my first reason to go off this medication last year. After 3 months of taking this stuff I could barely move my left arm. It took another 3 months for the pain to go completely away.

When I started up on the WB again_ I experienced a few days of headaches_ dizziness and insomnia.  That has gone away now.  The only problem I notice is that I feel weepy/panicky in the morning.  I think that is because the medicine has worn off and hasn't kicked in yet.  Today_ I have to say I feel really good...positive and energetic.

All of this went away after the first couple of days. Then_ I would have slight dry mouth and would occasionally suffer from headaches and very slight nausea for 20-30 min. at a time. It might've increased my libido_ and I think it may have helped me keep my weight down. After awhile_ it was only very rarely that I had adverse side effects.  Now_ after 2 years_ I was put on Bupropion several weeks ago (the generic version_ same dosage)_ and I experienced jaw tension 1 time_ increased anxiety_ and muscle pain in my legs and buttocks for the last five days. I'm not sure how the two versions are different or if my recent problems resulted from the switch to the generic form. I do know that the non-generic form was perfect for me_ and I'd still be on it if my insurance would permit it.,"Before I began taking Wellbutrin_ my depression would often make me feel overwhelmed. I would lose my concentration really easily_ was often late to work_ and would end up lying on my bed because I lacked energy and motivation. On Wellbutrin_ I am better at keeping things in perspective. I still have my moments of depression_ but they do not overwhelm me. I do not get everything done that I want to_ but I have the energy to get more things done. The only side effects I experienced on the NON-generic form were slight and rare_ and the positive effects far outweighed the negative.

In about 10 days or so_ I noticed a major difference in my desire to smoke. I have absolutely no desire to smoke now_ which is incredible_ considering I was up to a pack a day at one point. Even when I do smoke_ I don't enjoy_ which also made it easier to quit. Wellbutrin has helped with depression a bit_ but not as much with anxiety. My anxiety seem to be worse_ actually_ but I'm not sure if this is the Wellbutrin or something else. Other side effects: severe nausea and vomiting_ complete loss of appetite_ weight loss_ racing thoughts. I'm sure these side effects will go away with time.,This medicine is amazing if you want to quit smoking. I'm willing to deal with any and all side effects in order to free myself from nicotine addiction. However_ the therapeutic dose to quit smoking is lower than the typical dose for anxiety/depression_ which might explain why it hasn't made a difference with those.,F,24,21  days,9/3/2009,Wellbutrin

I was having a lot of problems with focusing on getting school work and other things done and had no motivation to do anything but lay in bed. Now I can't find enough to do. I am able to focus and get everything done. I am more orginised and motivated. I had had almost no sex drive for awhile which is not normal for me and this boosted it right back. I don't get angry so easily and it has improved my relationships with my boyfriend and family. I had been having trouble sleeping and now can sleep easily. I don't worry all the time.

I was everywhere- bouncing off the wall- I actually knew what mania felt like! Jittery coffee feeling. I'm a photography and the horrible tremors made it very difficult for me to work. I was very self conscious because I was so shakey... I look like I have Parkinson's disease! (I'm not joking...)

He prescribed me Concerta first for ADD and after I completely wigged out when I took that_ he came up with this new theory that I hate my life and my job is stressful. I mean_ whose job isn't stressful? Anyway_ I have only been taking this for 3 days_ so these symptoms might go away in time. I threw up today after eating lunch and have had to suppress the urge to gag today. I feel really tired and unlike other people on here_ I sleep really well. In fact I slept through my alarm this morning. I can't focus at work and that is an issue since my job requires concentration.

I felt like I was on a trip...a Dizzy trip in the morning about 1 hour after taking it and it lasted for 3 hours. (150mg 2x per day at 7-8hr seperation).  At the beginning of taking this medication_ I was very hyper_ always cleaning_ finishing up college work_ doing lots of things in stead of just sitting around being sad.  That lasted for about 10 days.  (I was at 150 for 3 days then upped to 300 on 4th).  After a week or so_ I actually felt as though I was loosing my mind.  It was very scary.  I didn't even want to explain what I was feeling to friends or family because it was freaky.  Always dizzy_ always nervous with extreme anxiety.  Maybe what wellbutrin (and generic) do is create the ability for the brain to take in and process more data from using our normal sensory systems and it creates an overload and one of the ways to deal with an overload is to freak out and want to just close our eyes.  This_ I can understand....what I don't understand is that this medication is not consistent with a lot of people.

Psychiatrist says the prozac and wellbutrin are not the cause_ but after reading everyone's posts_ it sounds like the wellbutrin is the culprit.  In the past four months I've started having hip pain and wonder if it is being caused by the Zyrtec.

329, 5, Primarily anxiety / depression,Started out on 150mg/day - had trouble falling/staying asleep (1st week)_ easily distracted and spaced out a LOT (1st-4th week)_ lots of headaches (still experiencing)_ then came three weeks of intense suicidal thoughts (3rd-6th week). Survived that and doc upped dose to 200mg/day - suicidal thoughts finally went away_ appetite increased_ but now I have this bad/gross/disgusting taste in the back of my mouth/throat_ ALL THE TIME. I didn't want to quit smoking but I might have to because I have a feeling the bad taste is somehow caused by the Wellbutrin+cigarettes_ since the Wellbutrin also causes me to taste the cigarette smoke in my mouth in a way that I never have before. Bad_ bad_ bad taste. (Food tastes great though!),I noticed a decrease in my social anxiety during the first month_ but I believe that to be because I was too spaced out/distracted to be anxious in situations I normally would be. The anxiety has since returned_ but it's less predictable now and sometimes I manage an entire day without experiencing it at all. I believe that curing my anxiety (if that's even possible) is going to involve a lot more work than just popping these pills every day_ but I think the Wellbutrin has helped me on my way by practically curing my depression COMPLETELY. I can't explain it but I just don't think in the same patterns I used to_ I've stopped having mood swings (and my relationship has hugely improved as a result of that). My sex drive is pretty wild_ so no probs with that. I also have *extreme* bursts of energy and have begun exercising regularly again for the first time in 4 years! I can no longer go days without having the energy to take a shower - I shower every day and always feel motivated to take care of myself in ways I wasn't able to prior to taking this medication. Overall this medication has given me the energy/ability to do OTHER things that are helping me to get better_ like exercising and getting out and spending time with people again.

The thing that I loved about it most was that I felt like myself again after so many years of suffering.  My doctor increased my dose to 300 mg after a week and that was way too much.  I couldn't feel any emotion and was getting no sleep.  So I went back down to 150 mg.  It seemed as though it has stopped working now. So my doctor raised the dosage just slightly.

348, 5, depression,Anxiety (not a problem before)_ loss of apetite_ increased libido_ nausea_ clenching teeth_ restlessness_ memory issues,My ARNP (who I'd seen for 11 years) started me off with a bang - Wellbutrin XL 300mg - for chronic low-level depression.  The first two weeks were bad_ luckily I was working from home so I could deal with each new side effect as it showed up.  First couple of days were just feeling restless and out of sorts with myself.  Around day three the nausea developed so I wasn't eating much (which may have added to the problem).  The nausea was off and on for the first two weeks - also could not drink wine or any other alcohol during that time_ the smell of it repulsed me (and I normally love it).  The anxiety scared me because I'd never experienced it before_ I worried about anything and everything - was taking Xanax .25mg to combat that (have taken that as needed for years for hormonal irritability).  Around day 14 I had my worst side effects and anxiety and had decided that I wasn't going to be able to continue with it.  The next morning I woke up and it was like a magic wand had been waved and all the side effects had subsided.  I felt like a new person_ calm_ relaxed and at peace with the world. It was a huge relief - didn't really want to go through the hassle of trying another medication.  The teeth clenching lasted for several more months off and on_ but that was tolerable and it eventually subsided altogether. Try to get through the initial adjustment phase if you can...see how it turns out.,F,48,19  months,3/29/2009,Wellbutrin

I took St Johns  Wort for about 3 months_ it helped bring out of the dark but I still had zero energy. I finally gave in and went to a doctor_ he gave me Celexa. It made me feel like a zombie so I quit taking it and went back to St Johns Wort. My doctor at the time would not prescribe anything else for me. I ended up going to the same doctor as my sister and he started me off on Pritiq the new Effor and Ativin for my anxiety for a couple of months. These had absolutely no affect on me at all positive or negative. I went back very discouraged_ the doctor gave me 150mg of Welbutrin and .5mg of Xanax. The Welbutrin kicked in after only a few days but one of the side effects of this drug is increased Anxiety_ it's in the pamplet that comes with the medication. The Xanax instantly works for any anxiety attacks that I do get but they are much rarer than they were the first few days I took the Welbutrin. I put down no side effects becuase it's in the pamplet. I feel great now and have a lot of energy_ this medication has saved me from what seemed like a life of misery. I still have anxiety but I can handle it now that I know what it is and have something to treat it.,M,43,45  days,3/17/2009,Wellbutrin

Doc suggested to add 75mg taken in two doses. First time_ reaction was awful. I quit after the third day of absolute misery. I was drinking heavily to deal with continued anxiety and depression. I stopped drinking and cleared my system for 8 days before attempting a second time. Second attempt has been significantly better. Although I'm still not sure if I am benefiting yet_ at least I'm not feeling worse! I definitely suggest laying of alcoholic beverages for awhile as you start. I've only been on Wellbutrin for about two weeks now but still haven't touched alcohol.

I was in the beginning stages of menopause & went through an assortment of HRT  -  what a waste of time & tons of $$$.  The W/B has given me  no side-effects except for that 1st week. I am not sure if the W/B has helped me lose weight but_ I have lost over 30 pounds in the 3 years I have been on it. I don't feel it changed my libido at all.  I enjoy life so much more now.  I have tried going off of it because I didn't like that I felt I had to be on drugs for my family to like me but I was right back to the mood swings;  crying one minute & raging the next.

I was a vibrant young women and am now on disability and have significant muscle loss that Dr.'s can't explain as well as multiple sclerosis symptoms with a normal mri. The Dr.'s are baffled.

On the 11th day I did not sleep one minute and for me this is hell. On the 12th day_ I was so fearful of not sleeping due to my constant agitation_ I resorted to drinking until passing out. The next day I couldn't work_ was twitching_ and felt like I was coming off LSD--complete with psuedo-hallucinations--light had a green tinge and patterns were slightly enhanced.  The drinking is not my regular behavior_ and it scared me. I stopped taking WB that day and it took 3 days to feel normal again.,I had my first episode of depression in 2001 and treated it succesfully (10-20mgs prozac/day & therapy for 2yrs). I've managed w/o drugs since then (4+yrs). This year anxiety became a problem and lead to another depressive episode. I had to consider drugs again. The Dr suggested wellbutrin because I had strong sexual side affects (zero orgasm) with Prozac. He said even with my anxiety and insomnia WB might be OK. It wasn't. From reading other people's experiences_ I think my dosage was too much too quickly_ and I wish my Dr had recommended differently. I started with 100mg/day and ramped up 100mg every 3 days-reaching 400mg at day 10. The Dr said to ramp every 3-7 days.  I was eager to feel better_ and it was OK at first_ so I ramped every 3 days.  The hand/jaw clenching and agitation came first at 200mg_ and then everything got worse.

I would consider it a huge success when it comes to helping me to stop smoking (haven't smoked in 3 months and counting!).However_ now at the end of 3 months_ I am feeling extremely depressed_ to the point even of contemplating suicide--very unlike me.  I also have bouts of extreme almost uncontrollable anger.  I have read others here on this site who tell of how they have broken out in rashes--this too is happening to me_ and it has never happened before.Are the depression _anger_ and rashes due to the wellbutrin?

It got to the point that I could no longer cope and it was affecting my professional and personal relationships. I had forgotten what it felt like to be happy. I was to the point that I was so sick of myself that I did not care if I woke up or not. I am a psych nurse and I was beginning to act and feel more like a psych patient than a psych nurse!Even though I have to cope with some annoying side effects_ I would not go back to the way I felt before getting on the Wellbutrin.

So_ I like to supplement my 150mg of w/b with L-tyrosine and complex carbs.,F,44,180  days,4/9/2008,Wellbutrin
435, 4, depression,agitation primarily...,I just wanted to suggest to those who have not been taking wellbutrin very long (shorter than a month)that it may get much better. I have been taking it more than a year_ and it pretty much saved me initially .. and is still helping. I had very bad experiences with other medications (paxil_ lexapro) but my doctor kept working with me. We have to realize that we are individuals and so it may be different for everyone_ but for me things did not improve for a couple of weeks -- and then got much better. Talk to your doctor and people you trust. Good luck to everyone --- hang in there!,M,57,18  months,4/7/2008,Wellbutrin

It's been 10 days and now I have a terrible headache and am wondering if it's from the W/b? I don't sleep as well_ but since I function better during the day_ it's an acceptable trade-off.

447, 5, ,None whatsover,All of you on here_ with the exception of myself must be real nutcases or hypocondriates.  There are NO side effects associated with Wellbutrin or any anti-depressant for that matter.  It's all in your screwed up heads.  Depression is not real_ it's not a chemical imbalance it's a state of mind.  You create your own happiness.  Stop popping a pill thinking it's going to magically make you ALL better and start digging deeper into your soul to find out why you are the way you are.  You probably screwed up somewhere along the line and now feel guilty well guess what?  Everyone messes up - it's called life.  Get over it.  Stop looking for pity.

I wouldn't let side effects scare you like I did.,Just started taking this past week. I have taken Zoloft in the past and it wasn't working and making me very tired and I had  no sex drive. Started Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once a day. I started feeling better after a few days. The side effects were very mild. I was scared taking it because of the warnings and opinions on some of these sites. I no longer have dizziness. I have never had trouble sleeping. I also enjoy having a couple glasses of wine here and there and have not noticed any side effects there. I am not encouraging drinking but this is something I enjoy on occasion and don't have a problem with substances of any kind. After several warnings I read I was afraid I wouldn't be able to even enjoy a beer or glass of wine. Anyway_ the side effects are extremely mild and everything is looking up and I have more energy.

My advice:-don't take the generic (fillers really upset my tummy_ they are not the same as the real thing) -always taper up slowly (I went straight from 150 to 300 as mentioned and felt suicidal)- I like the 150XL better than the 150SR(XL way smaller pill_ less additives? SR is twice the size)- you must give it time to start really working (@ a month)- Stay on it once you feel better.(I didn't after 4 months of feeling fine_ got sad_ went back on and felt better.)- make sure someone is aware of whats going on when you change doses. Any change in doses can abruptly change your mood.I am still not convinced this is the one for me_ but it has worked the best so far. I feel fairly normal mostly.

I'm not nearly as irritable as I was before and I feel slightly more energized.  In addition_ my anxiety has subsided considerably.  It even appears to have helped reduce the intensity of my obsessive thoughts (I've had OCD most of my life_ although of the pure-O variety).  As an added bonus_ I have cut down on my smoking to just a few cigarettes a day.  It's amazing how taking this low dosage of Wellbutrin for just a few weeks seems to have improved the quality of my life_ with virtually no negative side effects.

BUT...I already felt an increase in libido and wetness down there (which was what I got on this med for),So_ from what I read below_ I am going to keep trying this medicine_ though I already stopped it per my doctor's orders after just the first 4 days because after just that short period of time I had all those side effects I just mentioned! I freaked out. But then again_ my doctor did not warn me about any of these side effect and she did not ween me slowly onto this medicine. I jumped right in at 150mg. Clearly_ that was too much too soon. So I am going to try again_ only very slowly and with a small dosage_ increasing it by 50 weekly and see what happens. Maybe my body just needs to get used to it. I hope that's the case. I really want this drug to work because I see other people are thriving with it. I am also on Zoloft (after being on Paxil for 5+ years) and both those drugs make me have NO sex drive. I got on this to counteract that_ but it is worth all these crazy side effect? I'm not sure.

480, 5, Major Depression,In the beginning_ around 6 years ago (Wellbutrin SR 150 twice daily at the time)_ I had (for about a month) the heightened anxiety_ angry outbursts_ and insomnia alot of people here describe (this was made worthwhile by the increase in motivation_ energy_ and focus). The anxiety is much toned down nowadays_ but still remains. Recently_ about 3 weeks ago_ my doctor upped my dose from 300mg XL to 600mg daily_ and I have begun to experience 'itchy spots'--I always had one heat rash area on my thigh_ but now it is constantly itching and bruised. Now I am noticing small rash areas appearing on my neck and arms_ and I CANNOT stop sweating. I was always a sweater_ but this is constant_ and happens on pretty much every inch of my body. I think 600mg is higher than the advisable max of 450mg. Pretty convinced the sweating and rashes are due to the high dose_ but I am also on BuSpar as of 3 weeks ago for the anxiety_ and am not sure how this is affecting everything.,It saved my life. Despite the initial negative side effects_ I went from an unfocused_ inactive_ self-destructive mess to a functioning and productive human being. As I age I think my metabolism has changed_ leading to an increase in anxiety and occasional anger_ but I firmly believe that stopping this drug is really not an option for me. I prefer this greatly to traditional SSRIs such as Zoloft_ Paxil_ Celexa_ Lexapro_ and Prozac (all of which I have tried and ended up causing lethargy and serotonin syndrome). If you feel that SSRIs are not for you_ I think Wellbutrin is the way to go. I believe it is actually classified as a norepinephrine and dopamine re-uptake inhibitor (NDRI?)_ which indirectly affects seritonin levels_ so if you are seritonin-sensitive like I am_ it will not hit you like a freight train like all the SSRIs. I personally think of Wellbutrin as my depression medication_ and as I age I have learned that I need a secondary drug to work on my anxiety levels. Nonetheles,F,25,6  years,12/11/2007,Wellbutrin

I started back on the drug a few days later with better results and felt much more energy.  I had a lot of encouragement from others that had been taking this drug.  I gradually increased the dosage to 300mg (over a 7 day period). It has helped me significantly. My libido is very high and I'm 61. I'm always thinking about sex. I even get spontaneous erections.  Orgasims_ like everyone has said_ are very intense. My depression has lifted and I feel great.,If you are having a few side effects after initially taking this medication I wouldn't give up.

My poor husband and children; it was rough on them. I'm on week 3 and I still have a lot of irritability and anger_ insomnia_ and the itchiness just kicked in. I do smoke marijuana in the evenings and that helps the lessen the itchy feelings and also helps me get to sleep easier. I'm not having crying jags anymore and don't feel as bad as I did but I think an increase in dose would help more. The best side effect so far is the weight loss and loss of appetite.

My sex drive disappeared over a year ago and my marriage was suffering so my doc added Wellbutrin.  4 weeks in and so far the side effects are tolerable.

I was having an absolute lack of a sex drive and wellbutrin was given to me along with my celexa to increase my ""sexability""- there was nothing sexy about it- I panicked.

I know it definitely has been affecting my job performance_ but so far have been able to play it off.,"These side effects aside (the worst being my short-term memory loss)_ Wellbutrin has changed my life. I can speak in front of others without sweating or turning red (an important part of my job)_ I don't feel like I need a ""night cap"" to go to sleep-- in fact_ I haven't craved alcohol since I started Wellbutrin XL_ and I've even wanted to get out and meet new people (cough_ men)_ something I haven't been interested in in over 5 years_ much to the dismay of my parents.

I started to feel great but then it all went away and i became just as depressed as i was prior to taking it. My doctor has doubled my dosage so I am now on 300mg a day. I am just hoping and praying that it helps. I took effexor for 4 days and the side effects were horrible.

I am CERTAIN that this is a side-effect from Wellbutrin as I have never experienced anything like this before. Hopefully this will disappear over time (I am less than 3 weeks in) but if the nightmares continue then I am coming off the drug and trying something else. I have previously been on Venlafaxine but suffered sexual dysfunction_ so wanted to try Wellbutrin as I heard there are no such effects.Also_ I have suffered occassional headaches since starting Wellbutrin but these can usually be sorted with a couple of headache tablets.,On the plus side I think I feel my mood lifting at times.

(A while back I had a lot of bad side effects when I went from 150 to 300 in only 4 days.)  Before taking Wellbutrin I was bone-tired_ but on the 5th day (150) I began to feel more energetic.  I felt more alive_ but during the first couple weeks I also felt a bit more anxious.  The anxiety gradually went away.  My libido_ which I thought was dead_ has returned_ and my appetite for food has decreased.  I take it in the morning_ and occasionally it takes me a little while to fall asleep in the evening.  Occasional slight dizziness_ but only very occasionally.,After being on 300 for a few days I felt like the sun had come out.  I still have the same worries and concerns_ but they are no longer all-consuming.  I don't feel jittery_ I just have sustained energy and have been getting a lot done.  I used to procrastinate doing everything_ and now I look for things to do.  The worries don't go around and around on the worry track_ and I feel more at peace_ but not in a sedated way.  My emotions do not feel flattened.  I just feel so normal.  I want to do things now.    (Celexa (low dose) took the edge off_ but slowed me down.

FEW LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS: hands tremble_ less interested in sex.,Wellbutrin has worked quite well for me in keeping symptoms of depression at bay. For several years_ it was difficult to keep taking it when depressive symptoms broke through. Now I take it in combination with another antidepressant. I've stuck with the SR formulation of Wellbutrin once daily in the morning. I think the XL stays in my system too long_ raising peak blood levels too high each day. The unfortunate truth is that it should take MONTHS (at the very least) to determine if an antidepressant drug is the right one for managing YOUR chronic or recurring clinical depression. Fine-tuning your medications requires a great deal of patience_ a  skilled psychiatrist_ and your continued commitment to your own care and healing. You must be prepared to WORK in partnership with your psychiatrist to pursue all the best treatment options available to you: find reliable information in books and on the web; try support groups_ workshops_ group therapy_ individual therapy.

567, 4, Depression and mild anxiety,Weight loss_ sweating_ increased sex drive_ some nausea,I started on 150mg of Wellbutrin XL and after 2 weeks was only feeling slightly better.  Went back to the doctor and upped it to 300_ which made a big improvement.  Decided to go to a psychiatrist and she added Effexor 150mg to the mix_ which has made a major improvement.  However_ I believe the Effexor is what makes me sweat.  I do enjoy the weight loss from both medications.  I usually do not have much of an appetite and have lost about 12 pounds in 7 weeks.  I'm hoping the loss of appetite stays with me.,F,28,7  weeks,6/28/2007Email,Wellbutrin
568, 3, Major Depression,DIZZINESS!! Yikes. Spaced out.  Can't focus on people when talking to them.  Difficult to focus.  Swelling in feet.  Tight neck.  Headache. Stomach issues.  Bad comniation with Starbucks coffee or expresso. Sensitivity to light.  No patience for anyone.  Weepy.,I need some advice.  I took Cymbalta for over a year 30 MG and it stopped working - I became more depressed and pessimistic and socially isolated.  I was told to stop it completely and start taking 150 Wellbutrin SR.  I felt content the first few days and had more energy but my heads would spin when I closed my eyes and I was completely dizzy.  It has been 10 days now that I have been on 150 Wellbutrin SR.  I don't have much of an appetite and feel flu like before and after I eat.  I want this to work so badly.I have a high stress job and i need to move quickly throughout the day.  I've had trouble using things like the paper cutter at work I mess it up and i used to be so good.  My question is WILL THE DIZZINESS GO AWAY? Also_ is it Wellbutrin that is causing it or is it withdrawal from Cymbalta 30 mG?Somebody? Anybody? Please write me.,F,33,10  days,6/28/2007Email,Wellbutrin

I took one for six days_ then tried two a day. It took 3-4 days at two a day to adjust. Now I am starting to feel better. A little more motivated and upbeat. I have stopped drinking coffee.

577, 3, major depression,At a dosage of 300MG Wellbutrin XL: constant headache_ restlessness_irritability_insomnia_increased anxiety_ palpitations_ decreased appetite_ weight loss.  Transitory side-effects: very dry mouth_ mild constipation_ dizziness,I think Wellbutrin might help you if you do not develop intolerable side-effects. Since it is a stimulant_ it can get you out of bed and going if you are lethargic from depression. At 150MG_ I had some positive results with just a very dry mouth and a little dizziness for a couple of days_ but when the dosage was increased to 300MG_ I began to develop bad side effects. Unfortunately_ I cannot tolerate the therapeutic dosage and have had to decrease it to 150MG and add Cymbalta. I was not on 300MG long enough to know if that would have sucessfully managed my depression. If you suffer from anxiety_ this might not be a good choice for you. I knew going into it that Wellbutrin might increase my anxiety_ but the SSRI's don't work for me.  I did get some benefit from the lower dose of Wellbutrin_ so I am hoping that the combination of the SNRI (Cymbalta) and Wellbutrin will manage my depression.  All of the side effects I experienced are common with Wellbutrin; unfortunately_ I just had too,F,52,5  weeks,6/15/2007,Wellbutrin

Over the course of 6 weeks it was gradually raised to 400mg a day. I'm not sure if it is helping. Still have moments of hopeless depressive moods. Still don't want to get out of bed some mornings. Most of the side effects listed above only seem to last for 4-5 days and then abate. The doctor wants me to stay on it for at least another month to see if it helps. I'm willing to give it a try_ but I'm concerned that it is not doing anything for me. If my situation improves over the next month I'll write to let you know.

Now I've been taking it for 2 weeks. The first few days were hell. I was like a ticking bomb_ anything and everything annoyed the hell out of me; I was unbearable. However_ it did get better after the first week or so. I have so much more energy_ I have to excersize for about an hour each day because I have this urge to move. My feeling of depression has also eased a bit. However_ though 6 days out of the week I feel as mentioned above_ there is that one day which is HELL. I feel totally useless and spaced out_ my depression recurred and I have random fits of anger and crying. Though my sex drive has increased significantly_ the guy I was seeing called me a 'freak' due to the initial side-effects_ so it kinda sucks for me right now.

And he asked me if being heavy made me sad: of course.  So_ I got this anti-depressent.  And I loved it.  Suddenly I could exercise for a long time and feel no pain.  It didn't hurt my memory_ in fact_ I was sleeping better_ and doing better with my memory too.  I was losing weight.  And I liked it so much_ I decided to increase my dosage from 200mg a day to 400mg.  After all I read on the internet_ that 450mg was the max and that in test groups_ those on the max dosage had lost the most weight.  This contravened my doctor's advice_ and boy_ was he right_ and I_ wrong.  On that day_ I went into a severe paranoid episode_ I thought I was going to die.

Doctor gave me permission to up my dosage from 150mg to 300mg_ but space out dosage by 8 hours.  I'm feeling like I've just started again.

594, 5, Major depression,Dry mouth and a few headaches. I already take Trazodone at night for sleep_ so no problem with sleep.  Increased sex drive is true.  Half a 0.5 Xanax helps with the occasional mild anxiety in daytime.  Few side effects if gradually weaned up from lowest dose (half of 50 mg generic) waiting at least 2-3 weeks before upping dosage.,I worked my way up very slowly_ 25 mg once a day_ 50 mg once a day_ then Wellbutrin XL 150 mg in morning only.  Took about one month to take full effect_ but I am alive again and am so thankful for this drug.  I wish I had started this 10 years ago.  I have been depressed for so long_ and nothing worked - and I've tried the whole spectrum of antidepressants. This stuff works BUT you have to start low dose and gradually over several weeks or a month - gradually increase dosage of short acting_ then move to XL at lowest dose (150 mg which works for me - have no desire to go to 300) then after a month or so move up to 300 - wait a month.  Stick it out - this is well worth it.  I am happy and whistling and singing again.

For me to NOT have side effects from this is truly a blessing.  I can only repeat what I feel is the key to my success - starting at a very very lose dose and very very gradually increasing dosage after at least 1-2 weeks - this I feel helped me in not having the side effects that have been posted by many.  Jumping right in at 150 XL or more as I have seen posted may be why so many have bad side effects - the docs are starting them at too high a dose or moving up too quickly.  Each of us has to be an advocate for ourselves and do research before filling a prescription.  Just because the doctor said ""take this"" doesn't mean we should blindly trust them.  My psych doc wanted to start me at 150 XL but I insisted on starting very low and upping gradually because I had researched Wellbutrin.

(the headaches went away when I switched from IR to XL after a week_ but returned for a week each time I upped my dose.),I've used SAM-e and SJW_ but aside from that_ this is my first experience with AD meds. When starting_ I had horrible headaches. They went away after a week or so_ but really were bad to start with. And ear ringing that went away within a few weeks. I started off on 75mg twice daily of immediate release (IR)_ generic_ and had the worst side effects (of the headache_ feeling irritable)of any dose. I am not sure if it was the IR or the generic_ but I wouldn't go on that again. I also was peaking and valleying from the two doses. When I switched to the 150 XL it was like the sun shone and the rainbows came out_ way better. I asked to move up to 450 because i thought i could improve a little more_ plus i wanted the weight loss. But after 3 or 4 months of the 450_ I don't think i am as happy as i was on 300 so i will probably drop.

I told him(and my shrink)that WB should be marketed for that! This could be sold as a female Viagra. I did have a slight headache that went away and the last few days I have felt irritable. Also_ I noticed I have no need for the 2 or 3 drinks of booze I was having every night. Like many others I have weird dreams_ not nightmares_ but WEIRD! (Like Tom Hanks being a dog and talking to me! I also wake several time each night like I am finished sleeping but then go back to sleep_ as if I am sleeping lightly.Oh_ and I have a drastically decreased urge to stuff my face..and have lost six pounds.,I sure hope it keeps working and I can tolerate it well. I was told there was no 200mg of XL_ but have read in previous posts that the generic comes that way_ so maybe my switch from 150 to 300 contributed to the irritability_ and I can back off to 200.

My doctor also prescribed ambien CR to help me sleep.  Everything was going well - I had some side effects but they didn't bother me that much and the wellbutrin was great for my life and work.  About 3 weeks into the medication_ I started itching.  First it was the scalp and neck_ then all over.  Scratching would cause huge_ angry-looking welts.  My doctor thought it was the XL coating; he switched me to SR and lowered the dosage to 100 mg twice a day.  Also kept taking the ambien.  I lived with the rash for about 2 weeks and it was terrible.  Finally_ I stopped both ambien and the wellbutrin and it went away.  The rash could have been caused by the ambien CR!

Simple tasks like making the kids lunches_ packing backpacks and remebering to charge my cell phone before just exhausted me.,I have had bouts with depression all my life.  I was misdiagnosed with Bi-Polar during a terribly abusive marriage.

Two months later we tried 10 mg of Paxil.  It gave me the energy I needed and was the safest of all my choices while nursing.  I thought that Paxil was great aside from the iritability I experienced.  However_ I have seen the light now.  I am so please with the Wellbutrin at 300mg.  I am no more cranky than usual_ still feel energetic and am once again hopeful.  The only negative comment I have is one of safety.  I missed three doses while out of town and had ALOT of trouble keeping it together.  It has been 60 days now and I would hope that I am not that dependant on the drug.

647, 5, 1st-quit smoking_ 2nd-depression,I've been on it twice now.  A couple of years ago to quit smoking and now a few weeks into it for depression.  Chills_ insomnia_ strange dreams (vivid!).  Right now it seems my dosage is too low.  I went for a couple of days of high energy but have had a whole week of being REALLY grumpy_ fatigued beyond belief and a general sense of being out of whack.  I asked my doc to up my dosage to 300xl because I took 300sr to quit smoking_ it totally worked and I liked how it made me feel and it improved my outlook and coping skills,Does anyone have any comments about using the XL version vs the SR version?  My last experience was with SR but my doctor said she doesn't really prescribe that anymore_ just the XL.  I really hope this helps with my Depression.,F,40,4  weeks,3/29/2007Email,Wellbutrin

I was taking lexapro and although it helped me not feel so depressed_ it made me quite tired. I would nap as often as I could. It seemed to effect the way I dealt with things throughout the day by seemingly making everything o.k. to the point that a lot of things didnt matter. Welbutin on the other hand has had an almost opposite effect. Rather than being tired_ Im more alert.

I can not even enjoy a caffeinated drink anymore. I do not smoke or drink. This has been a huge mistake for me and a major source of discomfort/stress/anxiety.

Exercising is about the only thing that gave me a little peace but it was short lived. As I sit here_ I can barely type due to the shakiness. Please take caution with this drug. I am on 150 mg 2x's daily. I did not know this was ZYBAN either.,F,44,3  months,2/28/2007,Wellbutrin

I can deal with the few side effects I am sure that they are less harmful than smoking cigaretts.I recommend this drug to all of those who want to quit smoking_ but remember no drug can help you stop smoking . You have to be determined and willing to stop smoking. The best part about this drug is that when you start taking it cigarettes taste and smell bad. I still grave cigarettes but I am strong and do not let the cigarette control me any longer.,F,43,38  days,2/27/2007,Wellbutrin

Since then_ the others have been fought off with some ibuprofen.  The weight loss started immediately. I have already lost a couple pounds this week. I am not over weight by any means_ but the last 5 pounds have been a struggle_ including eating right and daily workouts. This little bit of weight loss with the wellbutrin has been a blessing. Lack of appetite too_ which probably explains my weight loss.,No sexual side effects at all. I was put on the extra 100 mg to increase libido. It hasnt helped. HELP?

It helped me cut back on smoking(no desire to smoke or do any of the other bad habits I had!). When I smoke it tastes different too. It has also helped my nervous anxious stomach. I dont worry so much about things or snap at people or get aggrevated as easily. My weight is the same.

I can honestly say it has helped me all around... Cymbalta made me feel more depressed and made it extremely if not impossible to orgasm_ but I find it easier to with Wellbutrin_ and the sensations are more intense. The only negative side effects I would say are dizziness that make me feel very disoriented and almost nauseous at times_ and the dizzy spells last for a few days...

Alcohol also increases the frequency and intensity of the headaches_ even in very small amounts.,"I have tried all the SSRIs and hate the side effects.  10 years a go I tried Wellbutrin and had great results.  This time when I tried to go on Wellbutrin I had terrible side effects - rapid heart beat_ insomnia_ inability to remember things.  I was going to give up and live with depression and all my suicidal thoughts when  I finally found a patient psychiatrist and he suggested that I go on Wellbutrin very slowly to avoid the side effects.  I went on Wellbutrin by making in into a 1% solution (crush the tablet and disolve it in 150 ml hot water) and then going up 1 ml at a time (1 mg).  It took me 6 months to get up to my current dosage of 15 mg per day.  This allowed me to get on the drug and to take the right amount which for me is 15 mg a day - 10% of a ""normal"" dosage.  My depression has dramatically improved_ I no longer sleep all the time or have suicidal thoughts.

744, 3, Anxiety/Depression,I recently changed from Paxil after 9 yrs of taking it to Wellbutrin. I was packing on the pounds with Paxil and couldn't get it off. Wellbutrin is the only anti depressant known so far to not cause weight gain. I've lost 34 lbs with diet and Wellbutrin.  For the last 3 mos I've really been struggling to get the Wellbutrin dosages correct. I was initially put on 100 mg a day with no 'washout' period. This means apparently it wasn't necessary to slowly transition off Paxil and onto WB. I quit Paxil cold turkey. For the first few wks on WB at 100 mg a day (in morning) things were great. My sex drive was crazy and I felt amazing. Then it hit me....I crashed! All of a sudden I wasn't sleeping_ I was having major anxiety attacks_ and CHEST PAIN that I almost went to Emerg for. My Doctor increased my dose to 150 mg a day. If anything my condition worsened. I went into the Dr's office a wk ago in tears and ready to lose it. I hadn't had a full night's sleep in over 3 wks_ and I co,but who wants to be a chubby and depressed! LOL. Hey_ at least with Paxil I could sleep. In fact_ my husband said I was a log!

However_ I have mild depression due to several life situations that I have just kind of plugged along with and tried to cowboy up about. I decided it was time to drop the cigarrets and the depression and wellbutrin seemed like the logical choice. I am using 150mg once a day and let me tell you_ the difference it has made in just 4 short days is miraculous. I feel like my old self already. I hope it lasts because going back to the darkness will be lousy after finding so much improvement. Now if it will just help me kick the cig habit_ then it really is a miracle drug. I really like it.

Wellbutrin also helped me quit smoking_ I haven't had a cigarette in over two years. Before wellbutrin I had tried quitting so many times and always gave in. Wellbutrin is also great because it generally does not affect libido.

751, 4, s.a.d. and bulemia,The first week or so - slight nausea in the morning_ flatulence in the afternoon (bonus!)_ mood elevation_ clearer thinking_ a slight rash that disappeared eventually_ diminished appetite = fewer eating binges,In the past I've had really bad experiences with anti-depressants and have steered clear of them since.  This drug was recommended for seasonal affective disorder by Dr. Norman Rosenthal (author of Winter Blues) so I thought it might be worth a try.   I was especially happy that it cuts the appetite - because my s.a.d. symptoms include insane sugar and carb cravings in the fall/winter - which lead me into a cycle of binging/purging plus annual weight gain.  I understand this drug isn't supposed to really kick in until 4-6 weeks has gone by. So far I think it's helping. I was on a subtherapeutic dose of 100 mg per day and am just starting at 150 mg.

Sometimes I feel a little too ""hopped up_"" and at 400mg SR I felt irratable_ and almost identical to the way I felt when I got sick and missed a few days of it.  Cranky is the right word if you multiply it times 10.  I strongly recommend tapering slowly in either direction. All in all_ this med is the best as far as side effects go.  It's great if it works for you_ but it doesn't work for everyone.","I've been on and off for a few years at varying doses.  I seem to think I can live without a med once I start really feeling better.    Hmmmmm.....*I am wondering if anyone else has had an experience with camparing the SR vs. the non-sustained-release version.*  I have given myself the notariety at my clinic of being ""non-med-compliant_""  but I am always safe_ and always give what they have to offer me a good college try.  Zoloft sent me the wrong direction_ as did the Lamictal and the Zyprexa.Lately the Wb 200mg SR hadn't been great_ but I really noticed when I went off becuase I got the flu and couldn't keep anything down.  It was bad news even when the nausea et all subsided.  I took a few more days worth. I ran out and started taking my backup non-SR 75mg/3x day (225mg) for a few days_ and finally felt like my gears were oiled again.Has anyone experienced a difference between the SR and non SR?

The medication worked great at first.  In the past two weeks I have had increased anxiety_ irrational thoughts (thoughts that just didn't make sense or weren't common sense)_ inability to focus and feelings of being withdrawn from my family.  These side effects came on suddenly in relation to how long I had been on the drug.  I have now been prescribed Zoloft and my primary care doctor and therapist feel this is the best route to go.  I have never in my life felt the feelings I  felt lately and they are sporadic and come one without warning_ then I am completely fine again for several hours or even days.

This is a very_ very frightening feeling.  I have never been like this before.  I thought it was because I quit smoking and my blood sugar was out of wack but I changed my diet.  Now I know it's the Wellbutrin.  I am going off of this drug tomorrow.  I'll have to research whether I can just quit altogether or if I need to wean off.  I would recommend this drug to quit smoking because it really did help with that.

Unfortunately it was the WRONG drug for my anxiety (which was the primary issue) -- the drug made me super hyper and just completely miserable.  I felt like I was on a speed-like high all the time but couldn't concentrate or remember anything.  I couldn't sleep and had several crying episodes a day where I just felt absolutely desperate.

I just switched to the XL from the SR version and am not happy at all.  My Dr. recommended I do this because I was taking 2 of the SR pills once a day which isn't really safe (you're supposed to spread them out over the course of the day).  I felt fine with the SR and it helped bring back a bit of my libido which had been lagging from being on lexapro.  However_ in the past few days I have so many sexual feelings and inclinations it is not good.  I am putting a previously great relationship in jeprody (1 yr.) and am scared of whats to come because of this.  Be CAREFUL if switching from the SR to the XL...i'm not sure what it is about the XL but it increased my libido a million fold and it's not good to be that increased.

My sister had read th research and urged me to ask for it so I did.  I stopped smoking after about 2 weeks.  I was also on Prozac for depression but after a year or so I realized that Prozac wasnt doing anything so I continue to take Wellbutrin SL 150 mg 2x/day to keep me from smoking and to keep me balanced.  Recently_ I ran out of my meds and accidently went off it cold turkey.  I was on day 8 without it when I realized that I was losing my mind and had my boyfriend pick it up and deliver it to me at work.  Im now going through the initial stages again but I believe I'll feel balanced in a few weeks.  It was really weird but I gained like 6 lbs in that week and cried at everything - even commercials.

I went through hell the first 2 weeks on Wellbutrin SR 150mg twice a day. I wanted to stop taking it_ but I wanted it to work so bad that I perservered through my hell. I started reading up on the medication and found out that the INITIAL dose should be 100mg to 150mg ONCE a day_ not TWICE a day. So I think I had a lot of those side effects because my doctor overdosed me!! Terrible.  After 2 weeks_ my doctor dropped me down to 100 mgs twice a day.  My side effects pretty much disappeared after 2 weeks. I now feel really good and think this is working.  I am glad I perservered!  Make sure your doctor doesn't overdose you on this medicine when you start it.  I believe it does work_ you just have to get the right prescription and then work through the side effects.

After talking with my doctor I was diagnosised with Post Pardem Depression (3 months after his birth).  Once I started on Wellbutrin XL_ I really started to feel better.  I was much happier_ the anger that I had to everything and everyone seemed to melt away.  I was more like myself.  I was on 150mg for a week and then went to 300mg.  After 6 months I went off the meds to see if my body and corrected is imbalance from the pregnancy.  No such luck_ so my doctor and I decided to put me back on for an additional 9 months.  After the nine months I came off of the Wellbutrin XL and all is still good.  It has been 7 months since I have been off it and life is still good.

You begin by not liking anything about the cigarette when you have one and then end up not even craving them to begin with. I was a pack-a-day 15+ year smoker who's quit briefly several times before with no luck - amazed how quickly this took effect. Left me much less edgy and jittery than nicotine patches_ which didn't take away cravings anyway. Of course I also didn't seem to care for much else I used to get pleasure from_ but seemed small temporary price to pay considering the benefit. Once I felt I had a handle on quitting cigarettes (about a month of taking it) I quit cold turkey with no side effects. The mental detachment it seemed to be causing was beginning to freak me out.

I have not noticed much improvement_ and actually got worse last week_ so got the dose bumped up.

But now_ 7 days later_ I've decided to quit this stuff after having such high hopes and now will go it alone with just patches. I started at 150mg a day then on the 5th day started 21mg patches. Well_ in the meantime_ I had a severe panic attack (day 2)_ I got so anxious & paranoid I couldn't leave the damn house (day 3 & 4_ kept trying to talk myself into leaving_ WTF!?)_ then 2 days ago I started 21mg patches with WB. Man....I can't even drive without being cockeyed and nervous. It's soooo not safe. I went to buy 14mg patches to see if that made a difference and it didn't. I wake tomorrow to just patches and hopefully_ no leftover SE's of this stuff.,My sister used this for smoking cessation and it worked like a miracle drug for her with no SE's. It does the same 'miracle' of making me not want to smoke. But the SE's are atrocious. I believe it also amplified a crisis situation we'd had here as well making me 100 times more depressed than I normally would have been (I even thought I shouldn't give this much a damn about this situation_ but I did). It really is like someone made the miracle drug that makes you so jacked up while on it_ you eagerly go back to dealing with sh*t on your own....like nicotine withdrawal.....OR what you THOUGHT was depressing before WB was nothing like slowly going crazy on this stuff.

I am a pharmaceutical executive_ ironically . . . not sure if that is relevant_ but I think I'm pretty open minded and objective about side effects.

This led to a one of the craziest nights in my life_ when I just laid in bed crying and honestly_ truly_ wanting to kill myself.  I basically just went crazy.

Also tried a few other SSRI's however_ ALL had the same terrible sexual side effects.

I had been on Wellbutrin before_ (different psych)_ and had terrible full body rash and horrendous itching after 3 days whereupon I had to discontinue.  Long story short_ got a new psych. who wanted to try me on Wellbutrin XL because of my experiences with the SSRI's.  He wrote a Rx. was for the brand name: Absolutely no problems/allergy like symptoms_ etc..

The drug seems to be less effective each day and I just feel more and more anxious as time progresses (don't feel like talking to people_ nervous_ edgy).

I am wondering if the Wellibutrin sr would have the same effect.  First time taking it_ and would like to keep up_ took 150mg for a few weeks_ then took 1/2 of another 150_ to go up slowly.  Doc said don't cut them_ because it disolves to fast_ don't know if this is correct. It helped the depression a lot_ increased desires_ and generally feel better.

The good news: I'm no longer smoking; cigarettes taste awful; no cravings.  The drug has done its job.  Now the bad news: had to stop the Wellbutrin effective last night after a trip to the emergency room for extreme dizziness and euphoria.  According to the ER physician_ this type of side-effect is not only common but enough to warrant stopping the drug.  The nurse_ in fact_ made a comment that she wouldn't take Wellbutrin either due to the types of side-effects cases they see in the ER.

I was wondering if ever having an orgasm again was important enough to feel like crap. The dizziness was unbearable as was agression_ irritability_ and hostility. Once those were gone_ the nausea kicked in. Today is the first day I feel somewhat normal (for me). I can have an orgasm again_ which is great. I am still waiting for my anxiety to be as subdued as it was when I took celexa 40 mg. I did feel increased depression and anxiety initially_ which really pissed me off. I was ready to call it quits and then I read some of these postings and it made me feel better to know I wasn't alone. I actually am starting to feel better. If anyone is going through this and is feeling like it will never end_ I have been there and in 9 days they are gone and now I can just sit back and let it do it's thing.

Now all over my torso_ down my arms_ a little on my back and now starting on the back of my lower legs.  Unbelievable.,Increased my sex drive like nobodys business.  Liked that part of it.  But unfortunatly_ I'm allergic to it.  It really evened me out though.  The Dr. is having me take 300mg of St. Johns Wort_ three times a day instead.

932, 4, Depression_ Social Anxiety_ BPD,Dry Mouth_ Occasional Anxiety_ Mood Fluctuation,First thing I did was stop drinking. I had a long time six pack a night (often more) habit. The doctor gave me librium for the insomnia and anxiety that come from the DT's_ later switched to Xanax (Librium will put an elephant to sleep- too strong.) The Doctor put me on Paxil 25mg for the depression. She later said she uses Paxil first because it is fast acting. The Sexual Side effect had me back in her office 10 days later_ when she gave me Wellbutrin 150mg XL. There is a noticeable change when transitioning off of Paxil and on to Wellbutrin. She also gave me Xanax to counteract the possible anxiety side effect of the wellbutrin. (Had one today_ took half a 1mg Xanax and was cool again.) Wellbutrin takes a bit longer to kick in. 1 week so far and I only feel half as good as I did after 3 days of Paxil. I've been told it may take as long as 3 weeks to really start working. Staying 100% sober makes a big difference too_ so I'm willing to wait it out.,M,33,7  days,1/28/2006,Wellbutrin

I handle stress in a more healthy manner too.  I'm 1 month into recovery from a narcotic pain med addiction (over past 3 years or so) and have had NO cravings whatsover_ even though I went through a hellish withdrawal/detox_ cold turkey.

935, 4, Mild Depression,first_ the side effects are to be expected and are worth trading in the bouts of depression.  so don't be upset when things feel different.  be thankful you are not depressed.  side effects: (300 mg XL) increased sweating_ vivid dreams_ interrupted sleep_ increased sex drive for sure_ teeth grinding/jaw tension_ frequent urination_ feeling withdrawn/disconnected or flat about 3 times a week.  this last side effect has been the hardest....emotions diluted_ mood swings_ etc.  bouts of crying over losing the consistency of how i FEEL.,wonderful drug.  increased energy for sure!added 300 mg to 100 mg of Zoloft.  felt low on Zoloft..no sex drive!  wellbutrin has really combined well with zoloft.  highly recommended!  be willing to wait out the effects and change your dosage during the first few weeks or months.,F,23,2  months,1/26/2006,Wellbutrin

My chest is so tight_ all my chest and back muscles hurt_ and I'm dizzy_ either from the med or not breathing right. I've never felt more anxious_ and very scared.,The first couple of days I felt ok_ even surprized at my lightened mood.  It was about 4 days into taking it that I started to get shaky_ and weird_ and on the 6th day I was a total wreck.  Last night I couldn't sleep AT ALL_ every time I tried to sleep_ I would wake up gasping for air.

At the 3 week mark_ however_ I began experiencing panic attacks_ severe nausea and vomiting_ headache_ nervousness_ crying for no reason_ paranoia_ loss of appetite...I had to force my doctor to take me off it.,I have a hypoglycemic friend that this medicine worked wonders for. She never experienced any of my side effects. So_ it seems to be a mystery why some people respond positively to it and others do not. I did quit smoking though_ so I'm calling it a hard lesson learned.,F,26,3  weeks,1/25/2006,Wellbutrin

Although the Prozac has lifted my depression it left me with no interest in sexual intimacy at all.

941, 5, Depressoin,weightloss,I have taken many different meds for depression over several years_ and nothing has worked for me.  Finally_ wellbutrin was prescribed_ and I feel like it is a miracle drug for me.  I was hospitalized last April of 2005 for severe Depression and suicidal thoughts while on another med_ and the Dr. I was seeing monthly would not listen to me about how I was feeling until the day came that I could not cope anymore.  My husband and family saw me fall into a pit that I could not crawl out of_ and finally_ a mix of meds along with proper therapy has helped me to find a way out of that cycle of depression and realize that I do not need to feel that way_ and that there is a med that can help me to feel whole again.  While everyones chemical makeup is different_ those of us that have tried this med_ and it has worked for us_ we know how much it has helped us_ thanks goodness.  I took 150 mg for several months_ and the Dr. has currently raised it to 300mg.,F,37,7  months,1/22/2006Email,Wellbutrin
942, 5, Depression,Some irritability early on.,"I took this med for several months a year ago_ then quit. Began again 10 days ago. It's almost a miracle drug for me. Instead of drinking myself to sleep in front of the TV and going to bed at 3am_ I'm sound asleep at 11pm and getting to work at 6:30am. This seemed to happen the last time I took the med but I think it may have lost that effect... at least I stopped going to work early!The most remarkable effect this time around is that I don't have the urge to drink alcohol. I'm an alcoholic and have been through rehab twice. Nothing helped. Suddenly on Wellbutrin_ I'm acting like a normal person. Two beers is my ""limit"" and I don't feel like drinking... it just doesn't taste good. That was an unexpected result of the med.Other than that_ I just feel ""good"" in general. For the first time in ages_ I seem to have almost everything in order in my life. That's my story and I'm sticking with it.",M,48,10  days,1/21/2006,Wellbutrin

I have been told that I should have weaned off Zoloft first. When will this end??  I am sooo miserable can hardly function_ especially when driving_ get extremely nauseous.  Am also having headaches_ especially in my neck and behind eyes.  Am very tired and my eyes feel swollen like I have been crying!  Has anyone experienced this before and is this from the Wellbutrin or coming off Zoloft cold turkey??   I really want to stick with the Wellbutrin.  I have heard nothing but great things about it.

Which sucks.  Like the other poster_ age 41_ it was too much to deal with_ the breathing difficulties and the neck_ jaw_ and head tension.  I started with 150L_ and thought I could handle the upgrade to 300XL after 19 days_ but noooo dice.  My DR wanted me to take 150 for just a week! then move up.  I insisted on 3 more weeks of samples.  Like the other poster_ I_ too_ had a succesful run with Wellbutrin_ in my case 7 years ago_ on Wellbutrin SR.  I don't know if it was the XL_ but this was horrible_ and sad.  Quitting cold turkey is NOT the way_ but I felt I had no choice.  The crash from stopping the drug cold-turkey lasted about 5 days_ with some lingering effects 20 days later.

Irritability... at times MUCHmore than normal. Not really noticing increased sex drive_ although am definitely feeling more ""cuddly""",I feel like I'm on a rollercoater part of the time.  I really have to watch that I space my doses enough so I don't get that drop in mood.  It seems to help the depression most of the time... although I miss the extra energy I had for the first two weeks_ at least I'm not quite as down in the dumps as I was before.  It is helping me that way_ although I wish the irritability side effect would go away.,F,34,1  months,1/18/2006,Wellbutrin

I have not had to bad of a ride so far. In two days I go to another 150mg in the afternoon and have set a quite chewing date for next Wednesday. I hope to not get the rash. I learned and read everyting I could about Wellbutrin before I started taking the script that I had filled. I decided that the side effect people are having for the most part is worth the risk but at the same time I aslo decided to only use this drug for no more than 4 weeks no matter what and plan to have another liver function test when I'm done. The one thing that I have noticed that I would like to mention to anyone thinkging about taking this drug is to be careful while driving. I almost ran off of the road twice since I started them.

My quit smoking date was December 7_ and I am now 3 weeks and 2 days not smoking.  I just can't believe quitting has been so easy for me.  I can honestly say that I have no desire to smoke and really don't think too much about it anymore.  I used to drink wine and smoke_ but I have found that I don't even like wine anymore.

At first_ I was smoking like usual_ then after about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks_ I smoked less because it tasted different_ then about the 3rd week_ I'd smoke like 3 in a 7 day period and now its been 2 weeks and I haven't smoke at all.  I haven't gained weight (but I walk 2 miles a day anyhow) and my side-effects are gone.  I have been happier and highly recommend this medicine as a stop smoking aid.

954, 5, Depression,I have had no noticeable side effects.,I started taking Wellbutrin XL 150mg about 6 weeks ago in addition to 100mg of Zoloft.  I noticed no difference with just the Zoloft so my doctor added the Wellbutrin telling me the combo seems to work in a lot of patients.  Wow!  What a difference this drug has made in my life.  I realized I have probably been depressed for years and didn't know it.  I feel like the fog has lifted significantly and I'm not always so tired.  I thought something was wrong with me that I needed so much sleep.  Now I know it was depression.  My states of awakeness and sleepiness are more like the average person now.  I think that I am going to talk to my doctor about increasing to 300mg as I'm about ready to quit smoking and I think it will completely knock off the small amount of depression I still feel exists.  I was very hesitant about trying this drug after reading some of the side effects.  I have had none and have nothing but rave reviews for Wellbutrin.,F,37,6  weeks,12/27/2005,Wellbutrin

After I took it I felt like I had BiPolar The withdrawal got so bad I started taking prozac which made it so I had absolutey no thoughts in my mind at all.  It must have been a weird interaction of the two because I took prozac many years ago fo postpartum depression and I was fine.  Well then I was told by a pharmacist to stop taking my reglan(stomach medicine} which causes anxiety.  this caused my reflux to act up so bad it damaged my eustacian tubes which caused ringing in my ears which made me even crazier.  I was so suicidal. I am lucky I have kids because I would never hurt them by killing myself.  I was afraid to go into the hospital to be put on more crap that would make me even crazier.

I have noticed an absolute inability to consciously recreate the depressed feeling-  like I can no longer access that part of my mind_ which is great! I haven't expreienced any of the anxiety or irritability associated with Wellbutrin_ but the effects are still evolving at this early stage.

Although I agree with another writer on here it made me mad_ and angry_ and a jerk to people I lvoe sometimes. I stopped taking it 3 weeks ago and I want to see what it's like not to be on anything since I have been on something for years. So far I really don't notice much of a difference except I sleep longer. But for the first time it seems like ever I can put my thoughts to words easier_ and explain things clearer to others.

I don't think I've lost any weight (no scales to check) and I do seem to still have my same appetite.   I'm hoping to see some positive effects soon. First time I've taken anything for depression.  Don't know if it makes a difference_ but I'm taking the generic form.,F,27,8  days,10/29/2005,Wellbutrin

My fiancee_ however_ states frequently that I seem ""mad""_ ""mean""_ or ""angry"".  For this reason I will stop taking the drug every 4 or 5 months for just a little while.

Didn't notice anything for a few days until I remembered to check and now I've been hearing it since.  Could very well be my own hyper-awareness and vigilance rather than a real side effect).,I've been on 150 mg xl for about 10 days.  For the first 5 days I actually thought I was feeling better.  But the past 3 days I have been getting more depressed and anxious.  I'm not sure whether it is the drug or the current stress in my life.  I would think 150 mg would be too little to affect one way or the other.,M,51,10  days,10/26/2005,Wellbutrin

Some slight appetite decrease and weight loss (but not enough).  At first_ the intense dreams were freaking me out and I wanted to discontinue but these have quit (after approx 2 months on).  Not noticed any libido change.  One problem was that if I missed a dose I would immediately experience increased symptoms- rage and a general horrible mood_ so I am now careful to never miss doses.  Has not been as effective as it was previously and so am going to ask for an increased dose.  Am currently on 150 mg Wellbutrin XL,F,24,5  months,10/22/2005,Wellbutrin

I picked up smoking again last year and thought that I could just go on wellbutrin and quit gracefully again but the first few days have been tough. I find that I'm having mood swings and for the first time in my life I have a really short temper. The temper thing sucks because after I get angry_ I get really sad that I hurt the person's feelings_ thus the mood swings. I'm going to give it another couple of weeks though because I can tell already that my desire to smoke is gone--I just miss feeling like me.

984, 5, Depression_anxiety,Wellbutrin (available in Australia only as Zyban) 150mg Lexapro 5mg - both taken in the morning.Imovane 3.5 at night for sleep.I am now moving into my third week on this combination and am extremely pleased with the effectivness of these two antidepressants in preventing a ppotential slide into a major depressive episode. I have had few side effects from either one. The Lexapro at 5mg assists with potential anxiety and the Wellbutrin has improved my overall sense of well-being_ energy_ clarity and focus. So_ after a number of years battle with depression_ I feel very good at present and that is directly attributable to the Wellbutrin and Lexapro. It is still early days and I will need to get into week 6 -10 to fully know the overall effectiveness of this combo. I would certainly not hesitate to recommend that you consult your doctor about using Wellbutrin and Lexpro.,Improved libido. Energy and focus. No serious insomnia. No obvious side effects at all (week 3). I think it is critical to try and have as positive an expectation as possible of the potential benefit that an antidpressant drug/s may potentially provide. If you are negative and expecting that you will have every side effect possible and receive no benefit_ that is likely what you will experience. I have had almost 10 years experience with the antidepressant roulette wheel and I have been very fortunate to rarely experience any extreme side effects. The MISTAKE I did make with some of those antidepressants was not BEING PATIENT and giving them the time necessary to achieve full effect. THEY TAKE TIME_ call it resetting brain chemicals_ marinating the brain_ whatever you like_ but it takes time. The antidpressants allow one the opportunity to begin a process of loosening up and taking action in other areas of your life: exercise_ relationship nurturing_ spiritual and creative fullfill,M,47,3  weeks,10/18/2005Email,Wellbutrin

I was perscribed Wellbutrin because it doesn't have those side effects_ but be aware that if you are succeptable to anxiety and light-headedness then you may end up feeling even worse.

Now after 9 months I am switching back to Wellbutrin b/c I gained all the weight back on the Prozac. Initally lost but that was just anxiety related. When I didn't need it_ I went from 150 to 140.

I lied in bed_ trying to fall asleep again but meanwhile_ all I could do was think about anything and everything. The good thing was I could direct and focus my mind on anything I wanted. So I tried to think of the most boring thing possible_ (creating a new cover letter for the job hunt) and I created it all in my head in a matter of 5 minutes in bed!!! I used to sit in front of my computer for hours trying to design a new one! Anyway Im liking this stuff_ and I feel a productive day of work ahead of me....aaahhhhh!!! The only thing that concerns me so far is the inability to sleep for more than 3 hours a night. Otherwise its doing EXACTLY what I want it to do.,M,30,3  days,6/7/2005Email,Wellbutrin

I decided to go off of it a few weeks ago because for one it makes me extremely aggitated.  Well since being off of it I gained 5 pounds back so I went back on it today.  I think I'd rather be bitchy than overweight.  It also gives you a VERY BAD dry mouth which is extremely irritating as well.

I had never had anything liek this before_ so I went to the emergency room and they told me I was having a panic attack.  I backed off the wellbutrin a little but would still get heart palpitations througout the day.  My doc put  me on another anti-depressant and it made my heart feel like it was vibrating.

I did not have weight loss until I hit the max dose_ the dr will lower the dose when I reach the desired weight.,F,38,9  months,1/8/2005,Wellbutrin
1075, 3, Smoking / Mild OCD,Decreased appitite_ dizziness_ shakey_ and dry mouth.,I like how after a week on Welbutrin XL I just didn't feel like smoking anymore and i have smoked for 7 years.  I had decreased appitite which i didn't mind_ at first i had to force myself to eat_ then it started to gradually come back.  I catch myself getting dizzy sometimes and I am very Shakey. The first week when I was still smoking i could not even hold my hand steady enough to light the ciggarette and a coworker noticed my hand shaking when i was moving the mouse.  The WORST side effect and the main reason I am quitting is the dry mouth. Not everyone gets this but mine is so bad i am drinking probobly 12 glasses of water a day.  Not only is it just uncomfortable I am constantly chewing gum because I am afraid I will havy stinky breath from the dry mouth.  Overall I could live with all the other side effects_ if I didnt have this dry mouth (which didn't occur till about the second week) I would definatly keep taking this product.,F,20,21  days,1/7/2005,Wellbutrin
1076, 3, Depression,Some insomnia but once I got to sleep was OK.   Losing weight_  I still have hunger but get full eating very little.,I quit smoking cold turkey.  6 months later started feeling bad and have loss of concentration_ cant focus.   After blowing it off and then medical tests_ diagnosed with depression.  Started on 150xl for 3 day_ the 300xl.  Didnt feel anybetter until day 8.   Focus and concentration came 3/4back.  Felt better but still not completely well.   Start of week 3 started backtracking and started feeling worse again.   I will give it a few more weeks but I may need the 450 dose.,M,44,3  weeks,1/6/2005,Wellbutrin

The MD then gave me 300 xl after 2 weeks and I could really feel side effects. I had a hard time going to sleep and I can feel my body shaking when I sit still. Also a little mild pain in my stomach. It's been 5 days since I have been taking the 300 xl and I feel much better_ not the best_ but I got up this morning and left the house.

I felt terrified inside and cried in the drop of a hat.  I had to go to the cardiologist because of extremely rapid pulse.  I hate this medication.  I could not take it!! I started out Wellbutrin XL at 175mg for one week and then to 300mg and I went 2 1/2 weeks on that and I just couldn't take it anymore.  I felt as though I was loosing my mind.

After about 2 weeks_ my doctor increased the dosage to 300 mg. and I began having strong and intense ringing in my ears. It was as if I was constantly at a loud concert; the second there was silence_ all I could hear was ringing. It was so bad that I had to have the tv on in order to fall asleep.  The doctor then lowered the dosage back to 150 mg. a week and a half later.  Three days after that I woke up itching all over. Later that day I broke out into hives. I stopped taking the medication two days later and I still have the itching and some hives. Its been two days since I've stopped. The side effects are too strong; its not worth it.,I have been feeling a little better; however_ the side effects are worse than just dealing with the depression.

Seeing that I had issues with anxiety in the first place_ it seems ridiculous that he put me on it. I have extreme irritability and horrible pms_ bouts of rage that horrify me_ suicidal thoughts. My neck and shoulders are so tight that I get severe headaches. Sometimes I get an inexplicable rash around my ankles that is unbearably itchy_ I am having terrible problems with my bladder....all of these things I have brought to my doc but he has not considered that they may be side effects of this drug....

I didnt have any anxiety all day. But then I had a panic attack_ or something like it_ which I havent had in about 2 months on Zoloft & Xanax. I read where most of the side effects wear off after a few weeks. I don't know if I can hang on that long. That stuff just made my anxiety worse! And that is pretty much the cause of my depression_ being that I suffer from agorophobia. I'm still  pretty unsure of this stuff. Cant make up mind.

1092, 5, severe depression,mild headaches_ irritability when adjusting to new dosages_ jittery feelings_ sleep less than I used to_ decreased appetite_ loss of approximately 13 pounds,I had been experiencing major depression and within two weeks of taking wellbutrin_ I was feeling much better. It also improved my ability to concentrate_ and curbed the bad migraines I used to get. The worst side-effect for me was the weight loss_ because it lowered my weight to only 100 pounds within a fairly short period of time_ although I (luckily) didn't lose anymore after that. I stopped taking the medication for four months to see if I could do without it (and I regained the weight I lost)_ but I became depressed again and now I'm back on it_ with the exact same effects as before (although now I'm having to watch how much I eat so I don't lose weight). Overall_ I'm quite satisfied with it_ and the mild side-effects I have to put up with are much easier to deal with than the depression was.,F,18,3  months,11/6/2004,Wellbutrin

Then the joint and muscle pain began - which was like nothing I have ever felt. My Dr. told me to stop taking it immediately_ and now three days later I am still feeling major joint and muscle discomfort and am worried it is not going to go away.,This is my first time taking an anti-dep_ and I didn't like it. The side effects were much worse than any depression I had exp'd prior. I'm glad it works for some people_ but it sure didn't for me. I have never felt so out-of-sorts.

But I have been on other antidep's before and knew that this can happen & toughed it out. Sure enough_ after 3 weeks those side effects subsided and I really enjoyed the drug's effect - one of the mellowest I have been on (I have switched around a lot trying to find one that did not effect libido. I have noticed a sight decrease_ but it was nothing compared to Paxil and Lexapro_ which killed it entirely). Anyway_ I was so disappointed to wake up two days ago itching from head to toe - both my elbows_ back of knees_ butt and inside of thighs were covered with large hives. I am going to the dr today to make sure it is a wellbutrin side effect but after reading this board I am pretty certain it is.

After trying a couple of Wellbutrin SR versions from a friend and finding it to be quite different_ I decided to go back and get the regular pill.  After a month or so_ I settled on Wellbutrin XR 300 mg daily.,I'm a small person so probably metabolized the initial XR much too quick upon first ingesting.  The 6-8 hour pills caused me to have no initial side effects at 75 mg/day_ but helped my depression only minimally.  At two pills per day_ I felt a lot less depressed without the suicidal thoughts and had more energy_ yet felt more anxious - like I just had too much coffee_ or as if I didn't want to talk to people because I was so tense.  However_ I felt that being depressed in itself makes me less anxious. At three pills per day_ my depression was totally eliminated (unbelievable).

I went to the Hospital ER where I passed out and was given an adrenaline shot.  I was admitted for three days and put on an IV to flush my system and 3 weeks worth of prednisone.  Horrible experience.,Other than the side effects_ this drug worked the best for curbing my depression and anxiety.,M,29,4  weeks,4/28/2004,Wellbutrin

1136, 3, depression,some vertigo the first month or so_ after that I sometimes felt a bit itchy all over_ especially on the scalp.  Weird jaw tension_ too.  My memory of amphetamines is distant but I remember them being sort of like that.  After a year I still get more acne than I used to and am constipated most of the time.,I took Zoloft for 7 years before it stopped working for me.  Wellbutrin helped me pull out of a big-time tailspin but I honestly liked Zoloft better.  After a six month break from Zoloft I now take 150 mgs of that again_ plus 150 mg Wellbutrin which does help counteract that famous sexual numbing from the SSRIs.,F,37,2  years,3/4/2004Email,Wellbutrin

1144, 4, depression/ ADD,One of the side effect I noticed was an increase sensitivity to the sun in which I had wear sunglasses consisantly.  Another side effect I noticed occured as the blood sugar rose_(over 200)(I'm a diabetic) I had to wear my glasses.(Before wellbutrin-I didn't need the glasses as much.),Taking wellbutrin gave me a CAN DO attittude I didn't have before the medication.  I noticed this effect within the first couple of weeks and was able to accomplish projects that I would not normally do. It also allowed me to focus more attention in longer spurts.  In addition_ the stress that normally was on my shoulders was relocated to the left shoulder blade. (For me_it was great NOT to have stress on the shoulders for once).(I switched to prozac_ to see if the medication changed the side effects- yes_ the side effects of sun sensitivity_increased glasses wearing HAVE GONE AWAY_in addition_ the stress IS back on the shoulders again.),F,40,6  months,7/3/2003,Wellbutrin

1155, 4, Quit smoking and depression,Disturbing chest pains and uptight feeling_ insomnia which is no worse than my normal insomnia. I take 75 or 150mg of SR formulation 3 to 5 mornings a week to minimize these affects.,"Originally prescribed to quit smoking_ I took the recommended 300mg a day for that purpose when I was not depressed_ and it made quitting very easy. I'd tried only twice before_ and both failed attempts were really agonizing. 300mg a day was damned unpleasant_ and I discontinued Wellbutrin ASAP after about 2 months_ but it really did just make me almost indifferent to cigarettes_ after 30 years of smoking 2 - 3 packs a day.About 6 months later_ I started to get really depressed; I had some Wellbutrin left over_ so I tried it_ and it literally relieved depression in a matter of a half hour like an amphetamine without any addictive or ""crash"" affect. I used Prozac for 3 months after running out of it_ but I now take the small dosage of Wellbutrin I use now as maintainance/relapse prevention. It's affects are energizing for 3-5 days in a row_ then it turns ""mean"" and I take a few days off it. I remain in a good mood for 2-3 days during these ""drug holidays""_ then resume taking it again when I start feeling down. It continues to bring virtually instant relief whenever I resume taking it. (If I felt that I could stop_ I would.) I have ADHD also; Wellbutrin has slightly helped some of those symptoms_ but is far inferior to amphetamines for that purpose.",M,44,6  months,6/29/2002,Wellbutrin
