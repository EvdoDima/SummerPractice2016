4, 1, Treated by dr for pneuomia,I was given an injection mix celestone 12 mm & rocephin 5mm the next day I took pill avelox  400mg as directed by dr. I have lost the feeling in my right arm my shoulder and right side of my face_ my fingers have feeling_ I was taken to the E/R per request from my doctor and had a stroke. I am not sure if the injection that was given to me by the doctors office was the casue of this stroke but I was a healthy 55 man active and no health issues....perhaps this could have cause my illness but I would advise for anyone that might be given celestone to do more research on this medicine.,,M,55,1  days,1/8/2009,Celestone
5, 1, injection in back,hives all over my body everyday for the past 5 weeks.,I had celestone injected in my back and now I break out in hives everyday_ it's been 5 weeks. Allergist says you can't be allergic to cortisone but it's an anti-inflammatory and I'm allergic to anti-inflammatorys. How long does it stay in your system. I can't stand the itching and swelling anymore.,F,59,1  days,12/15/2008Email,Celestone
