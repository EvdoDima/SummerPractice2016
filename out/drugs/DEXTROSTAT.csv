0, 1, ADD inattentive type and anxiety,This medication did not work well for me at all. If anything_ it only made my ADD worse. It also gave me a terrible crash everyday_ where I would feel extremely depressed. I was also very irritable and always in a bad mood; this was completely out of character for me. Also the dry mouth got so bad that it was difficult for me to talk for long periods of time.,,F,33,3  months20mg,3/18/2015Email,Dextrostat
