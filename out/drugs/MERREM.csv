0, 3, Crohn's Fistula,Very dark urine_ yeast on penis_ but especially a condition known as myoclonus: see:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoclonus for a description.  Kinda scary.  very bad pain in joints and back_ especially while sleeping or whilst in other sedentary positions.  Gets better when I move around.,Although the side effects were not very desirable_ it has caused my ileal Crohn's to go into remission.  Surprising_ because no other drugs seemed to work.  Basically_ I went from 6-15 trips/day to can before the drug_ to 2 times a day with solid bowel movements.  In a way_ it's a miracle. However_ it has not done much for the fistula_ which is still draining.  The GI said he had had other patients use the drug for fistulas and they dried up. So_ ironically_ while I was prescribed the drug for a fistula_ it has ended up working really well for the ileal Crohn's. Funny_ huh? Also_ it can only be taken IV_ so I have a PIK Line in my arm_ and I have to wear a fanny pack with a small IV pump_ which is a drag. Requires dressing changes weekly by the nurse and 2/weekly tubing changes. Also_ really crappy stability with this med - only 72 hours.  So_ it seems I am constantly at the pharmacy picking up prescriptions. But_ given my options_ I am staying on it because going back to 6-1,M,38,10  months,11/21/2008,Merrem
