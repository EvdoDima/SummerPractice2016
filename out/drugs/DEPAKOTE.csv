But feeling better than before. Praying that's all the withdrawals I have with being on it only two weeks. My mother questioned this med from the get go  from a nurses point of view it was extreme high dosage for someone who was not even suicidal to begin with. I was going thru a divorce and had a lot of stress in my life_ new job_ new home. I have not been so scared in my entire life.

11, 3, Bipolar,Shadow creatures at night. Bad headaches_ back pain_ and Hair loss.,I was put on depakote and d-amphetamine mixed salt combo for Bipolar_ lack of energy and not wanting to be around people. The very first day I took depakote I experienced a severe headache that sent a shooting pain down my spine if I moved. This lasted a week. It seemed to work well during the day. I was able to be around people without being afraid of getting angry or hiding to avoid being spoken too. Halfway in the second week I began to see quick shadow movements. I continued to take the medicine because it improved me during the day. About 3 months of taking the medicine I became paranoid before going to bed. I would see huge shadow spiders crawling on the floor or walls. When I would get to sleep I was awoken by a big bang sound and saw a bright blinding flash. I also developed a bald spot in my head. I was tooken off the depakote and a month after I developed little spots that traveled from my legs to eventually my whole body. It turned to sores that resembeled psoriasis and I had to shave my head because I had large bleeding patches. After being referred to several doctors and a few biopsys they said that it was the after effects of depakote that can linger on the skin several months after stopping the medicine. Will never recommend this medicine. I also want to note that my sons father was put on this medicine at high doasage along with seroquel and he began thinking that his own mother was pouring bleach onto his drinks and has become very unpredictable with his mood,F,26,3  months250mg,9/25/2015Email,Depakote

Till months into taking this my teeth slowly started to decay and hurt and continued to get worse as I continuously brushed twice a day floss every night and mouth wash twice a day. Yet it continued to get worse and I never could understand the problem until I read that was a side effect to this medication_ I stopped taking it the problems slowed down but still am having to catch up on getting it repaired which is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.",The worst medication_ I would rather deal with bipolar in a more natural way_ due to all the stress from that medication.

16, 1, Bipolar with episodes,I have alot of medical problems going on with me. So on day 2 of taken depakote I didn't know which of my problems to blame. The CDDD for the intense neck and back pain? Another stomach ulcer causing this burning all over my stomach? My Thyroid levels are low again_ no energy? Depression hit hard_ considering suicide...often_ very often. And now no sleep and I was hallucinating in the dark. I finally started looking up all of these things and came to find out that it is the depakote doing this to me. Yeah I read reviews now saying it's just temporary_ and it's so much better after a month or 3...but this is not for me! Oh and dry mouth_ the 1 thing my doctor did say I would get. It sort of helped with me being angry/upset all the time. Now I just don't care. I lay in bed in pain_ hungry but can't eat. Oh and painkillers makes it worst (would have been nice to know since I take percocet 2xs day for my Cddd).,My doctor swore by this medicine when he gave it to me. Now I'm waiting for him to get into his office to rip him a new one. He knew that I had my Thyroid removed and have gained 52lbs and keep gaining. I didn't something to make me gain more. And what's with the back pain seriously_ what causes that? And why does painkillers make it worse_ it puts me in pain and I can't even take an asprin to feel better. But to all of you who did stay on it with all these symptoms_ good luck to you. After reading up on this med it's going down the toilet. (Weird how somebody would pay money to get high off of these_ you couldn't pay me enough to go another 5 days. I guess it works for some_ and I wasn't 1).,F,33,5  days250mg 2xd,7/29/2015Email,Depakote

Hair lossweight gain_ 10 pounds in 6 days...,"I srsly don't understand how a drug like this can be prescribed to people. I had some issues at my last job due to anger/anxiety/insacruities but man if I had been on this drug during that time it would have made everything worse. I've lost more hair in the last 6 days than I have due to depression and stress put together in the last year. I'm kind of freaking my self out because I'm not taking another pill of this crap and I'm worried I'll go in to some sort of seizure before my doctors office opens to tell her I'm no longer going to take this medication. I'm a little upset at my doctor because she did not tell me the full side effects of this drug and the issues it could cause me. I haven't been my self_ when I lost my job I promised I would clean the house and cook for my husband every day_ and I was until I started taking this medication. Now I don't want to leave the bed and I'm having more panic attacks than ever. I'm already over weight and gaining more is not something I would like to do. When I told my doctor I wanted to be put back on metformin for my pcos she just looked at me like I was stupid. My weight_ anxiety  and my pcos are my problems. Ugh I'm just so pissed_ because of depakote I'm sitting here at 5am writing in this.

Did not stop depakote till my hands started trembling. One month after stopping depakote_ I am having severe hair fall since last two months. Seems like I will go bald.

30, 4, Migraine,Some memory loss but mild_ short term insomnia_ decreased appetite_ lowered libido - but this was a big plus.  Adding to the dose slowly instead of jumping into the recommended 1000 mg made things easier. The delayed release version was easier to tolerate than ER.,Migraine days down from 20+ per month to no more than 5. The side effects are manageable and seem to be improving as I get used to the medication. The first month I had 10 pain days_ 7 the second_ and now 5_ and they weren't as bad. I would highly recommend a slow titration because this is my second try on this drug after a terrible experience when I was immediately placed on the 500 mg and went up to 1000 within weeks. I was totally against trying this again and a few months later I find myself telling my headache specialist Im not going off it unless I have to.

31, 1, Bipolar II,First I noticed being sleepy_ more depressed_ no appetite_ urination got more difficult although I drank a lot of water_ low back pain ( kidney pains?). Anxiety went through the roof_ didn't want to go anywhere_ deal with anyone. Suicidal thoughts and plans almost always on mind when awake but no energy to do anything about it. Then came a day I threw a lot of things that were important to me away and that night I woke up looking at my clothes trying to find the blood on them_ because I just knew I had killed two people and had to get rid of the evidence. When I didn't find blood_ I looked for the rifle I shot them with thinking of getting rid of it or if I had been dreaming_ I could give the rifle to someone so I wouldn't shoot these two people like I felt i needed to (In the sane world_ I have no reason to harm these two people). It was around this point I realized I didn't own a rifle (or a gun) and that I was having a psychotic breakdown. I'm glad I had some sense left! I called my doctor and stopped the Depakote that day. I would have been hospitalized but have a great therapist who kept an eye on me all day_ making me drink tons of water. I slept fine that night other than urinating as though I hadn't for weeks! The next day I felt almost normal just very weak and felt like I'd been through H**l and back! I am surprised this drug hit me this fast...scary too! I don't know how people take this drug but I guess that is why there is a variety of them out there_ right?,I guess it bothers me a drug that is supposed to help one feel better (have less mood swings) instead has the capability of sending one into a psychotic state (my first and hopefully last). I'd like to see this drug re-researched for its many and potentially severely dangerous side effects!

I see black  dots when I look from the side  of my eyes and sometimes  it seems like I am seeing things. Feeling like I can't drive for more than  a few minutes without feeling  extremely tired like I'll fall asleep at the wheel.,I was an undiagnosed  bipolar for most of my life  (until 8 months ago). This drug seemed like the answer to my prayers. It did stabilize  my mood but at what cost? I can't for coherent sentences and often  trail off  and feel embarrassed  around peers. I am very  concerned  about  my appearance  and none if my clothes fit now that I am 2 jeans sizes bigger  ( who can afford an entire  new wardrobe  in 8 months? ) I stopped taking it and I told my doctor that I didn't feel  comfortable  taking  Depekote  anymore. He  supports  me and it's been a week cold turkey.  Keep in n mind I have no major problems like  some people that have posted  ( seizures or brain surgery  etc  ) and I would never try to stop  this medicine  if that were the case.

38, 4, bipolar 1,I had taken Depakote ER for about 6 years asking with lithium. Altogether atv one point I took a 1500mg of Depakote ER and I think 750 or 1000mg of lithium. I was very stable. But hand tremors were extrem. So I eventually was taken off lithium (because I thought i might be pregnant) and stayed  on Depakote at the lowest dose of 750mg er... and things were good I was very happy I was not in any danger of getting into manic phases. I don't drink or use drugs in almost 8 years sober. I had a busy job that I loved which looking back I think made a HUGE difference. And had to switch my medication from the ER to the regular because of medication cost. So I took my 750mg 2x day once in the morning and 2 pills at night. I eventually lost my job and became extremely depressed so my dosage was upped. To 1000 mg one the am one in the afternoon 2 in the pm. But lately. I'm tired again my moods are extremely all over the place. I just want to sleep my life away. Im not sure if I'm over medicated or under medicated. I know pills are not magic but I've been really good about being in tune with my body. My dude affects errre different than most I used to have a b&b major sweet tooth but when i started Depakote it took that away...I was happy and sad about it. I do feel like lately I can't think I have headaches all the time and im having trouble processing things at my new job. I also am not really happy at this job.

53, 5, Bipolar NOS,At first_ I was kind of zombie-ish for 1week.  And had a lot more hunger the 1st month and gained weight.  After the first month_ these side effects went away.,After very low level and infrequent bipolarity for most of my life_ bipolar NOS with recurring depressions took over my life after being triggered by significant family traumas. I used marijuana to deal with the symptoms.  Worked pretty well.  But not as well as depakote.  I have to say that the vast majority of my dysphoric hypomania symptoms (if not all) have disappeared from taking depakote ER (brand) 250MG 1X/ day after dinner. I really hope it continues to work.  My family has noticed the significant positive change as well.   I wish I tried this depakote instead of years of antidepressants (which did nothing).  I did try abilify which made me extremely anxious. Depakote has really helped me.  I didn't expect it and was hopeless that I would ever get better.,M,47,4  months 1X D,8/8/2013,Depakote

The gastrointestinal side effects were meant to subside after the first few weeks_ but they persisted the entire time I took Depakote_ and I lost almost 20 pounds (I was small to begin with_ and now weigh less than 100 pounds). I was tired most of the time_ had difficulty waking or staying awake_ and my grades suffered due to memory problems / fatigue. Ultimately I would not recommend this drug--the detriments outweighed the benefits for me.,F,20,6  months1000 mg 1X D,7/30/2013,Depakote

58, 5, Migraines,Tender breasts_ some hair loss_ some fatigue_ but a really content and mellow feeling_ which is a great side effect for me.  Some minimal weight gain in the first 2 months (2 kgs)_ but I workout daily and eat very healthy_ so it has gone down again. I slept more with the almost daily migraines and its just hair_ and I still have enough_ so I am definitely not complaining! The only thing is if I forget to take it_ I immediately get a headache. Also_ I talk a lot more in my sleep and have more vivid dreams_ but my hubby calms me down_ so I go right back to sleep. But my quality of life is so much better with this medication and its the only medication I take_ so maybe that's why it works better on me than most people here.

61, 5, Bipolar 1 disorder,Combined with ZYPREXA_ I experienced MASSIVE weight gain and heavy sedation_ sleeping 14 hours a day.  Comatose_ zombie-like state.  But after cutting out cold-turkey on both drugs for 13 mths_ lost 97lbs_ and am now 118lbs.  It is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT drug when combined with Abilify_ or alternatively as a monotherapy. My only gripe about it now is that I have had a bit of breast enlargement & soreness; but my weight has remained steady @ 118 regardless of that fact.  Also a bit of constant chest congestion - but as I am a smoker_ yes you could alternatively blame the smokes!,For those posters who feel they can survive on natural remedies only_ well_ it IS a gamble.  I had a great year of 100% normality for the time I was taking nothing at all.  But this bipolar thing often DOES ambush you out of the blue_ which I discovered after suffering another manic episode after the cold-turkey experiment.  First time I was diagnosed_ it was BAD - a psychotic break nine years ago @ 39...when I was diagnosed w/this.  But I give it top marks when contrasted to Zyprexa_ Abilify (which has caused me an array of health problems)_ or Saphris_ another deadly drug.  After 8 years_ as far as I can see_ it's the best of the lot for what ails me! (Plus_ unfortunately DID have yet another serious manic episode lately_ & with just one increased dosage_ brought me back to the realm of normality FAST; and it feels SO GOOD to be back with the world again!,F,39,8  years1_250 MG 1X D,8/9/2012Email,Depakote

This cost me a 15 year marriage which we were together for over 20+ years Lost my Kids as I could not take care of my self anymore more or even help my kids. I pretty much lost all will to live. I am now on natural things_ which I am a lot better_ but now I need answers. I have a burning sensation in my brain all the time_ which I never had before I took Depakote.

67, 5, BiPolar I,The first month I was doing 500mg/day and felt no side effects.  I researched the heck out them_ so I knew that weight gain was very possible.  I immediately quit soda!  lol  I love soda.  I did not lose nor gain the first month_ so I think that I counteracted the weight gain.  The last 2 weeks_ I have been increased to 750mg per day at bedtime_ and I have experienced some quickness of the digestive system.  No problem_ though.  Makes me feel detoxified!  I do not feel sleepy_ rather more energetic.  Sometimes mildly manic.  For the increase these last 2 weeks_ I have started running again (well_ it is 1/2 run and 1/2 walk right now).  Still_ no weight gain_ but I am ready with more ammunition if I see any creepers.,I was on Lithium 750mg for over 2 years_ from when I was first diagnosed_ but my blood tests showed that my thyroid went haywire (hypo) and my kidney(s?) started struggling_ so we switched me to Depakote.  I was nervous because I FEAR change_ but I honestly feel better!  I feel like there was a fog (maybe from the Lithium) has cleared and I am happier.  I went through a few different antidepressants the last 2 years because I think the Lithium had me a little smothered.  When I first switched_ I went through a couple of weeks where I was EXTREMELY agitated and irritable...over-sensitive and over-reacting.  I think that was the withdrawal from the Lithium.  I feel better now_ although I will admit to some excited anxiety...another scary way to say mania.My biggest fear of all of the side effects was weight gain_ but I hope to be able to control it.  Most of the other side effects were the same as Lithium_ so I have already been dealing with swollen hands and feet_ hair loss_ and tremors for over 2 years.  My hair fell OUT with Lithium.  I lost half my density...but I got a shorter style and did a Keratin strength treatment and my hair has not felt better in 10 years.The Depakote is better than Lithium for me_ so far.

75, 5, Epilepsy,None.,Have had epilepsy for about 40 years. After various medications I have gone from 140 lbs to as high as 295.  I cannot blame the weight gain on medications but on diet. I have had no hair loss. When I am tired I think slower. It is not a problem when I am well rested. I also take low dose thyroid and blood pressure medicine and vitamins. In 2009 I had two bouts of pancreatitis_ the first was misdiagnosed and missed. The second time they took out my gallbladder. The pancreatitis was likely caused by small gallstones blocking the pancreatic duct. The gallbladder problem was possibly caused by diet. Reading tonight that Depakote is being tested as a mood leveler on Alzheimer patients and may prevent formation of the amaloyid plaque and tangles that cause Alzheimers.

94, 5, bipolar,mild hair loss_ mild nausea and mild tiredness,I started this medication after they tried to put me on ativan. Later they found out I needed something for bipolar. The side effects are easing off after my two weeks and I feel so much better. I was having panic attacks. I felt like I was about to have two since starting the medicine but they subsided! So not only do I feel better with the depression_ but I am not struggling with the panic attacks. I am sorry for the ones who are having problems_ but I am happy that I am starting to feel somewhat normal again!!,F,36,2  weeks500mg 1X D,9/5/2011Email,Depakote
