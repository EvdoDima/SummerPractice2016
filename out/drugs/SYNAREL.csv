0, 1, Endometriosis,Synarel shuts down a woman's estrogen.  I experienced 23 lb. weight gain_ wasn't told that it does NOTHING to eradicate endometriosis~ Teeth problems_ put on it too long w/ provera,"I don't know why OB/GYN's don't go back to school to learn that this medicine does nothing.  Side effects were not told_ ie_ facial hair_ potential for lowering of the voice. I have tapes showing that I still had chocolate cysts_ felt terrible on this junk.  A dentist knows that pregnant women have gum changes during pregnancy.  While endometriosis is variant in many women_ it can be clear_ and encompass large areas.  Synarel doesn't do a thing.  It cannot be taken for a prolonged period of time_ and I urge anyone to see Dr. David Redwine's proof_ along with Dr. Albee in Atlanta.  Synarel is the ""Sister"" drug of LUPRON and was featured in a NBC DATELINE special in the late 1990's. As soon as a woman with a little tad of endo says they feel better_ what happens?  They either have no statistics that are valid_ nor are there any proven biopsies that show that SIN-U_ALL_ made anything go away.  It has many side effects that are yet to be determined..mood alteration_ money by MD's via Drug Reps with large bills to add.  It is a oathe to ""DO NO HARM""_ yet some baby doctors are giving this nose spray to women who've yet to be even definitively diagnosed via Laparoscopy with Endometriosis.  That's outrageous.  You are dealing with the ON/OFF switch that directs the pituatary gland.  More than ever_ women will continue to have more needless surgeries or be told that hysterectomy ""cures"" Endometriosis.  That is a LIE.  Beware.  I was told that with Lupron_",F,45,3  monthsunknown 1X O,1/10/2012Email,Synarel
1, 4, endomitriosis,occasional night sweats and hot flashes_ some vaginal dryness,This has been tremendously helpful with my endomitriosis symptons - I have tried many other medications (lupron_ depo provera_ birth control pills) and this has worked the best. I do take a low dose hormone replace therapy to help offset the side effects.,F,39,8  years 2X D,3/4/2010Email,Synarel

3, 3, IVF,Constant pain just below ribcage.  Very sharp pain when breathing deeply.  Very weepy and depressed_ unable to control negative thinking.,This is my 5th time taking synarel.  The first 3 I had no side affects_ but they now get increasingly worse.,F,38,10  days,2/16/2009,Synarel
4, 3, IVF,The first time I really only had a nasty taste in the throatSecond round of IVF Im tired & irritable_ I have gained weight & feel bloated_ I have headaches and feel overall pretty rotten,The synarel is a necessary evil_ I will put up with the side effects because its all part of the plan to get to our goal of bringing a much wanted baby into the world,F,42,20  days,1/22/2008,Synarel
5, 3, endometriosis,Headaches lasted for first 3 weeks_ then intermittent irritability_ now muscle cramping/stiffness and weakness_ tons of hot flashes although these decreased when I went from 3 sprays daily to 2 sprays daily,The medication had many difficult side effects_ but it decreased my constant pelvic pain.  I'm concerned that because after the maximum dose (6 months) my pelvic pain is not gone and I expect I will still have to have a laparoscopy.,F,38,6  months,4/14/2007Email,Synarel
