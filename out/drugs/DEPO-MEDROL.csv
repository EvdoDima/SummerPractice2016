0, 1, Severe seasonal allergy,Did not help at all_could not focus trying to pack for vacation(have packed for years) very difficult crazy bad dreams_confusion waking up like you where in a dream,Would NEVER take this drug again they say there are no side effects with this drug_ I say they are crazy should certainly have precautions before taking it there are major side effects,F,77,1  days80 1X D,8/14/2016,Depo-medrol
1, 2, Severe seasonal allergy,First_ acute spike in blood pressure and heart rate_ anxiety_ difficulty sleeping (even sitting still)_ acid stomach_ belching. Next day_ alarming physical weakness_ dizziness_ depression. Starting that second night_ heavy but unrestful sleep with unusually vivid_ crazy_ even revolting bad dreams (normally_ I rarely even remember my dreams) with lingering gloom on waking. (Now I dread going to sleep!) Pain from hip injection much worse 3 days afterwards_ despite hot baths and massaging the area; feels like my hip was hit with a sledge hammer!,"Depo-Medrol alleviated about 95% of my major allergy miseries in 24 hours_ but then the ""roller coaster"" of very unpleasant side effects after that are a whole new bunch of miseries! I think next time I'll suffer through the allergy with more OTC meds rather than undergo these awful side effects again!! The doctor said this shot could give me amazing relief. Well_ yes...and NO!!!",M,65,1  days80mg 1X D,8/8/2016,Depo-medrol
2, 5, Sciatica or extreme lower back pain,No side effects,I believe I suffer from sciatica. 6 months ago this happened and a doctor told me that's what it is. It's only in my back_ I don't feel any discomfort in my legs or hips. Strictly lower back. Anyways_ I couldn't tell you what happened but like a light switch_ yesterday_ my back started in. This morning_ I couldn't dress myself. Literally. Couldn't walk normally_ the worst_ most extreme back pain I have ever experienced. I'm a nurse for a doctor and it occurred to me that could give myself this shot. The 5 or 6 800mg ibuprofen cut nothing. Advil_ did nothing_ bengay_ nothing. No exaggeration_ not one bit of relief. So_ I got to work drew up the 1 ml of depo medrol and for good measure I drew up a nice 3mg of toradol. As fast as I could_ I shot myself in my right deltoid muscle. About 2 minutes later I could walk normally. My back was still tight but a good 80% of the pain was gone. It's now 645pm and I'm still very comfortable. Little tight but pain is minimal. I gave myself these shots at about 745am.,F,32,1  days1ml,6/23/2016,Depo-medrol
3, 5, Severe rash on hands and feet,No side effects only relief!,I've had a horrible rash almost like poison ivy/oak. Derm says it is contact dermatitis. I've gone to walk in clinics and demand a shot of Depo instead of other steroids. The rash completely goes away for approximately 45 days. After steroid  wares off rash comes back. Once itches is unbearable after 2 to 3 weeks I go on the hunt for a new walk in clinic that will give me an a shot of Depo I ask for 2 ml of 40 mg and I'm good for another 2 months.Most amazing drug.

5, 4, Low back and sacrum pain injections,This was a one time injection given by my pain doctor in his office.  After two weeks I got a terrible itching rash that spread from my arms to my stomach_ legs_ back_ neck_ and buttocks.  It has been going on for 4 weeks.  Went to a dermatologist who put me on prednisone to relieve these symptoms.  Still have them and my course of prednisone will end in 3 days.  I cannot sleep at night because of the itching.  The rash is horrible!,I have had a terrible allergic reaction to this steroid.  There are many different types of steroids that doctors use for pain relief and I will never use depo medrol again in my life.  This is agony!,F,61,1  days1cc,3/2/2016Email,Depo-medrol

12, 1, Hives,When our daughter was in college and getting ready for her wedding she had unexplained hives. Went to doctors and the nurse gave her a kenalog injection not in the hip in case of side effect but in the arm. She had the side effect of muscle wasting at the injection site. Not good when you are about to get married and in a sleeveless dress. We visited the doctors office not to sue but to advise and work a solution out. We asked them to pay for what our insurance did not cover to have it fixed. They did_ thank heavens. Our daughter had plastic surgery to repair. It fixed it and she has had no problems since. The plastic surgeon said sometimes it can recur even after surgery but it did not. That's been about 9 years ago. It was outpatient surgery. Steroid shots or Meds are Very risky. I'm sure they can help but can also hinder. Use your own judgement. We never found out the cause of her hives? Maybe nerves from upcoming wedding? Not sure. I would say be aware and proceed with extreme caution if you ever need to have an injection or need the medicine.,,F,21,1  days60mg?,12/15/2015,Depo-medrol

17, 4, Rheumatoid Arthritis,Anxiety_ hot flushes_ stomach pain and nausea. ALL ARE TEMPORARY!!,I have used various methods of steroids (infusions_ oral_ IM) and they all work great. Yes they do give you some unpleasant side effects but these are short term and what are they in comparison with extreme joint pain and stiffness?! The worst one personally experienced is anxiety. If you experience this_ contact your GP and they can give you something to help. There are always drugs that can counter act the side effects so don't listen to the horror stories!

18, 1, knee sprain,The stiffness and soreness in my knee immediately returned.  Like going back to square one.,I only got the injection because I was going hiking for a week.  The knee had nearly healed.  A steroid shot had been recommended by another doctor for a previous sprain_ and by friends who's had it.

23, 2, Severe hip arthritis,None - just some soreness for a day or two,I was diagnosed with severe arthritis in my hip and was told I'd need a hip replacement at some point. The doc said I could get relief from these shots until they didn't work anymore_ at which point I'd probably want to go ahead with the hip replacement. I had one 80 mg shot under a fluoroscope in Aug 2014_ and it gave me almost complete pain relief for 8 weeks. I had another shot in Nov 2014_ and it gave me no relief. I had a third shot March 2015_ and I had relief for about 4 days before the pain returned. I'm now talking about hip replacement with my doctor.,F,40, 80 1X O,3/16/2015,Depo-medrol
24, 4, Severe asthma,I have severe asthma and take 2 inhalers_ 2 pills and a nebulizer on a daily basis to breathe. I get an 80mg shot of Depomedrol once every 30 days without the shot I end up in the ER because I can't breathe. Yes I have gained weight and get itchy at the injection site but I will take that any day over not being able to breathe.,My Asthma is so severe_ without the shot I feel like I have an elephant on my chest and then  a  panic attack because I feel I will dieThe shot relieves all of that for about 30 days. They need to work on the weight gain issues because breathing and fat don't go well together,F,42,3  years80mg month,1/21/2015,Depo-medrol
25, 1, Neck pain,I received 3 epidural injections of Depo Medrol. Once a week for 3 weeks. I had reaction after 3rd. Waiting 15 minutes after injection before leaving office. I had taken Valium before procedure and dozed off. When I woke after the alarm went off_ I could not move any part of my body and barely able to move my mouth to talk. They rushed me to room with oxygen etc and it took abt an hr and half before I had feeling again. I asked doctor what had happened. He said not sure maybe a reaction to numbing injection. Well after 1st injection severe pain at neck and unusual eating habits. I told doctor on 2nd visit. He said wow that's odd. 2nd injection I told him the same. No response. Well after the 3 they called and cancelled my 4th. So now 6 weeks later...i have gained 30 lbs_ difficulty breathing_ pain in whole body especially legs. I have had severe cognitive issues. Not remembering short term things especially. It seems some things have improve d_ but others keep getting worse. I was 117 lbs when I started these epis. Now I'm miserable in pain and depressed. Does anyone know how long these epidurals stay in your system?,,F,40,3  weeks50 mg,12/3/2014Email,Depo-medrol

27, 1, Allergies,EXTREME insomnia_ EXTEME fatigue_ anxiety_ increased libido but unable to climax_ the list goes on and on.,My allergies became out of control while moving house (dust) so after a week of suffering I went to the dr hoping to get some relief. This was 2 days ago. I have had no relief from my allergies but that now fades into insignificance to the issues I now have. I have not slept since having the injection and have now been awake for more than 2 days. I can get a few minutes of dozing sleep in which I have strange dreams but can't get any deep sleep. Doing anything is very difficult even basic daily tasks. All I want to do is sleep but can't. I had to defer my uni exams because I am very sick and have no focus. My libido is out of control but I can't climax_ this is very strange and frustrating. I have never felt worse and am very worried about what's to come. This drug is poison. Do not go near it with a 50 foot barge pole. I went back to my dr today who said that there are no side effects with this drug. What a load of crap! She even offered to give me another 40mg dose to try and help with my allergies to which I said NO!!!!! I would jump off a bridge before I would be injected with this poison again. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG. If this post helps one person not to go near this drug it will be worthwhile.,F,31,1  days40mg 1X D,10/24/2014Email,Depo-medrol

29, 1, BronchoSpasm (Asthma),I've had depo before and it never did this to me before. Extremely rapid heart beat_ irregular heart beats_ and fluttering heart with any movement (no endurance). Shallow breathing. Could not walk far without feeling my heart was about to burst. Could not swat a fly without my heart overreacting and going wild. Slightest emotion caused my heart to go wild. Felt like acid or fire running through my arm and neck veins. Twice I almost died. Felt like I was in the 7th circle of hell! Felt like fire_ then antifreeze_ running through every cell of my body with rapid heart. Muscle weakness. It has been 20 days since receiving the shot and I'm still having symptoms. Have not been able to walk through a department store without feeling like my heart can't handle it. Going to have a heart ultrasound to ensure depomedrol didn't blow my valves. Having been praying like crazy to get well.,This stuff is poison! Never again!!! (He should have just given me steroids by mouth.)

After day two I went to the ER_ the Doc felt really bad for me and said it WAS the steroid shot_ and I would most likely feel better in a few weeks. NOPE!! In and out of a few ER's after going 3 days with no sleep each time and the anxiety was AWFUL!! Primary care doc told me to take some valium to help; it did a little but not much. She said some people have had this happen_ but after a few months it goes away. Well...I am STILL suffering 1 year and 3 months later.
