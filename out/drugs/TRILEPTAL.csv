0, 1, for sleep and mood stabilizer,Could not sleep at night__very sleepy throughout the day and couldn't perform at work_headachesstomach ache,Terrible drug___I think the dosage was too much,F,64,1  weeks300mg 2tim,7/22/2016,Trileptal
1, 2, Bipolar_ Intermittent Explosive Dis,I remember having headache when first started on 300mg x2 about three years ago. Dose was upped by another 300mg/day four days ago. The intense headaches are back along with blurred vision_ brain fog_ facial swelling_ lip numbness and tingling fingertips. May have to go back to original dose.,If you're sensitive to side effects_ I recommend going very slow.,M,36,3  years300 x3,6/17/2016,Trileptal
2, 1, Facial nerve pain,I felt Ok until day 3 and starting feeling strange.  Then I had a blackout and fell and injured my knee and broke my hand.  Later that evening I told my husband I was going to lay down as I didn't feel well.  He heard a crash and came in the bedroom and found me getting up from blacking out and hitting my face on the edge of the nightstand.  I ended up with a badly cut lip that left me with a nasty scar.  I ended up in the hospital where they ran all kind of test and discovered I an one of 3% that they know of that has this happened as a result of the med. Maybe it would be more if more doctors reported it.  It causes loss of sodium in the blood and I had water on my brain or in my brain forget which they said.  No_ I would not recommend this to anyone.,,,72,4  days 3X D,6/13/2016Email,Trileptal

4, 4, Bipolar II,Weight gain_ lack of coordination_ impaired memory_ poor depth perception_ poor thyroid function_ some dizziness,I was on the brand name which worked quite well to keep my moods in check (along with talk therapy_ good nutrition_ eating & sleeping at precise schedules_ no alcohol or drugs_ etc.).  I enjoy feeling the highs & lows in life so I've kept my doses low.  Some years I needed a little extra in the Fall to curb depression and sometimes in the Spring to curb mania (but I never need more than about 600mg total for the day).  The side effects were horrible at first but most subsided within a few months and with time/therapy I found ways to cope with the rest.But with Medicare_ I had to switch to a generic form_ as I could not afford $500+/mo.  I became completely unstable_ all the side effects got worse and I now have bad anxiety attacks.  I am weaning off this drug_ adding some lithium and will be trying a new anticonvulsant.,F,66,14  years225 2X D,4/19/2016,Trileptal

7, 4, bipolar disorder,Drowsiness_ headache with missed or irregular doses_ weight gain,Helps with the bipolar_ i still have mood swings but they are very mild and i can control my actions and reactions. I take both doses at night because it makes me very dizzy and tired to where i fall over walking only a few steps,F,23,9  months600mg,3/9/2016,Trileptal
8, 5, Bipolar,Dizziness_ loss of concentration_ drowsiness_ hangover-like feeling in morning,I also take this med at night since it helps combat my insomnia. Probably couldn't handle it first thing in the morning. Before being placed on Trileptol_ I had been on almost every anti-psychotic and anti-depressant with no signs of relief. Within 2 weeks of being on 1200 x2 daily I had finally found stability. I eventually got down to cutting my dose in half and have been on this dose for over a year and I have not had any violent mood swings. Mania was suppressed and depression pretty much vanished. I will most likely be on this medication the rest of my life and I'm okay with that cause it's worked wonders.,F,22,2  years1200,3/4/2016,Trileptal
9, 4, Seizures,Tiredness_ irritability_ diarrhea_ emotional...cries easily..mainly each time the dosage is increased following a seizure.,My son has had seizures since birth as a newborn. Was on Kepra from birth to 6 mos. Went from age 6 mos to 2 years off meds after no seizure_ however was put on oxcarbezapine after they returned two years ago. Medicine overall works well_ however we are just trying to get that correct dosage as he grows. We have went several months without seizures_ then could have two in a span of 6 weeks_ so the dosage has to be adjusted. Overall the medicine seems to work with little side effects_ as long as the dosage isn't changed. The longest time without a seizure since on oxcarbezapine has been 10 mos.,M,5,2  years9 ml twice,2/16/2016,Trileptal

11, 5, Bipolar 1,Hair thinning_ initial stomach upset and acne though subsided a couple of months in. Weight neutral.,This was my wonder mood stabilizer though after three years lost its effectiveness. Higher dose above 1200 did nothing for my mood and the gi upset was extreme. All bipolar drugs have a trade off_ you need to decide what u can and can't live with. This was the least evil of any drug I've been on (and there have been a lot over the past 12 years).,F,40,3  years1200 mg,1/12/2016,Trileptal

15, 3, Bipolar disorder and seziors,Half an hour after my dose I begin to feel squished then pulled apart then numb. Sleep being the only way to get through it. So my dose is taken before I go to bed. About 9pm every night. I have also lost 20 pounds in less then 3 months since taking trileptal. Not too long ago I started haveing abdominal pain. I was given antibiotics in case of bladder infecton via my pcp. Now im dizzy and tired and slurring my speach. The headaches seem to be enjoying themselves. Throwing up for no reason. And I am very off balance weak and absent minded. Not to mention confused. It worked great up untill the abdominal pain. 6 and a half months or so.,I don't know if its because some nights I take my dose half an hour late. Or if it because of the low sodium.

I ahve managed to control my sleep so that I have 8-9hours at night and 2-3hours in the afternoon_ only if absolutely necessary.I have a strict sugar free/yeast free diet to control the IBS and it works to a certain point. The low sodium means that I drink less water/tea than I would like_ it's either that or have a seizure due to excessively low sodium. I have never been able to go out to work or even study or work from home_ initially from the seizures_ but now from the tiredness. Doing very little and spending most of my day in bed or on the sofa is the norm and I will get dressed at weekends and go out with my husband for a couple of hours.

While I was not completely stable when I first went on Trileptal_ my instability became increasingly worse over the month that I was on this medicine. By the end of the month I was so depressed and lethargic I could barely make it to school. On the other hand_ Trileptal did not cause any other side effects besides the severe drowsiness.

I'm mad all the time. I can sleep for hours all day and it makes me stay up all night long. Everytime I take it I'm blurry and dizzy.

Recently I have been experiencing what has been diagnosed as urinary retention.  I'm not able to completely empty my bladder.  The other side effects are merely annoying.

Additionally_ I can go out and do things with my family without being afraid of freaking out. Since I can't take anti-depressants (I am allergic) mood stabilizers are about the only thing I can take. I am happy with this - I haven't taken Xanax for 6 weeks and that in itself makes me very happy.

Dont let TREMORS scare u..its usually normal with meds. This is a med u need to be patient with but it has helped me alot considering ive been on it so long. Its good to combine with an antidepressant as well like wellbutrin. I am NOT epileptic and i still had seizures during withdrawls.

No matter what I tried I could get no relief. I went to my doctor who refered me to a ENT who refered me to a Neurologist who prescribed oxcarbazepine. I started out on 150 mg twice a day for a week_ then increased to 300 mg for the second week and finally 300 mg twice a day. Controlled pain very well but after about a month developed a rash_ mostly on left arm. Looks and feels like lizard skin and itches a lot. Doctor took me off trileptal June 10 (gradually) and started me on Lyrica. Some side effects gone or reduced but rash still bad. Can't wait to see what surprizes new med has.

It has made her a blubbering idiot and she is simply not the same person I have known and loved for the past 8 years. She is not safe to be left at home alone due to the disabling side effects.

108, 1, Anxiety_ Bipolar II,This drug has been a horror for my wife.  She has had her face swell up_ trouble breathing_ trouble walking_ and trouble with her memory.  We were advised to reduce her medication by 150mg every three days_ but once we reached below 300mg_ she started to have tremors.  We increased the doses until they stopped_ but now she's waking up in the middle of the night with convulsions.  I've had to up the dose back to 600mg so she doesn't suffer any permanent damage_ and we will talk to her doctor this morning. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE HOPE THE TREMORS AND CONVULSIONS ARE NOT PERMANENT.,Think twice before taking this_ my wife's convulsions and tremors are really frightening.  She's taking this for Bipolar Disorder not for epilepsy.  We hope to god these effects aren't lasting or permanent.  No one seems to have an answer as to whether they are or not.

Just a few days into it at 150 mg_ I sank into a state of constant agony_ despair_ being unable to eat (did not eat for 7 days)_ just lying on the couch moaning_ crying_ calling my Mom_ and wanting to kill myself. I started smoking a pack a day just so I could feel like I was breathing. I slept off and on during the day and woke up weeping in terror at night. I was deteriorating so fast I thought I would have to enter a hospital. The doc thought it was just my depression and upped the dose to 200mg. Then I started being unable to speak_ find words_ or talk on the phone. I was asking my Mom to move here to live with me and take care of me because I thought I was going to lose my house and car by not being able to work. That's when I decided to stop the Trileptal. Within 24 hours I was functioning again. I woke up_ took a shower_ made food_ and felt like myself. I called the friends who were taking care of me and told them I was better.

My vision became worse and somewhat doubled at distances up to 20 feet. My emotions were limited to a zombie-like state of despair. I couldn't laugh_ couldn't feel joy... The worst was that I couldn't sleep. I would wake up three hours after falling asleep_ usually at 1:30AM every night.,This is by far the worst medication I have ever taken. This actually caused me to become more depressed_ and the time that I have taken it has left some emotional scarring. I still get chills at the thought of what life was like during the few weeks I took this medication. I was put on this medicine to stabilize my mood spectrum_ but instead it seemed to get me stuck in a zombie-like state_ barely alive. It was torture not being able to feel. The feeling of your hands being bigger than they are scared me to death_ it was weird and almost supernatural.

All of these are most likely dose related.,I switched to Trileptal in High School from Tegretol. All I remember was having awful concentration and I would have to nap for 1 1/2 hours after school each day so I could function in the evening. I was still social but probably somewhat depressed due to the drug and the epilepsy. I was seizure free for 4 years (that includes 2 years on Tegretol and 2 years on Trileptal). My dose was increased and although I was still living a happy life_ the same side effects were bothersome. I was seizure free for 7 1/2 years and recently had a breakthrough seizure. I remember that each time my doctor increase the dose_ the depression_ concentration issues_ mental fog_ irritability increased. I was still living a functional and productive life. I graduated college top of my class and am about to finish grad school in several weeks. After my most recent seizure my doctor increased my dose and now I am taking 1950mg/day. Since this last seizure several months ago I have not felt like myself. I feel like a zombie_ have even worse concentration_ have no motivation_ am depressed_ have constant headaches_ anxiety_ etc. My doctor put me on lexapro but that hasn't helped at all. Although Trileptal has been extremely successful in controlling my seizures_ I do not think I am tolerating this dose and plan to switch to Lamictal. This was my own personal experience with the drug and do not let this affect your decision to take the drug. Everyone tolerates to the same drug differently.,M,25,9  years,10/29/2009,Trileptal

My MD added trileptal and told me it is necessary as an adjuntive therapy (wouldn't work alone?).  Have had severe PMS-like symptoms since starting.  I don't know if this is the answer to my problems_ since pregnancy is not recommended while on this drug_ and that's the whole reason I got off Dilantin.

I had the worst ITCHING and HIVES I have ever had and since I was there for 28 days I begged him to take me off it. He said I would have to stick through it and it would make my life signifigantly better.

I can report that I got the severe drug rash.  Though less than 4% of patiences reportedly get it_ it's a horrible experience that lasts for seven to ten days.  To make matters worse_ the doctors in the ER initially attributed the rash to my testing postitive for Mono and they did not take me off the Trileptal.  They treated me with steriods to control the rash and as soon as I came off the steriods_ the rash came back which is when they determined that it was_ in fact_ the trileptal.,About two months later_ I saw an allergist who confirmed that I am allergic to this drug and to Lamictial.  If you are sensitive to medication and you have a history of other allergies (I also have seasonal allergies and am allergic to wheat)_ I highly recommend you go for an allergy test before taking this medication.  Even if you are allergic_ they might be able to put you on the medication by doing an 'oral trial' where they send you to a compounding pharmacy to have the medication diluted and simply have you build it up in your system very slowly.  Just be careful.  These two drug rashes were among the most painful experiences of my life.,F,33,12  days,2/20/2009,Trileptal

The medication stabilized me very well_ but I was low energy and sleepy.  Instead of getting better_ this seemed to get worse over time and I am now transitioning to lamictal_ hopefully that will work better for me.

This medication works very well for me_ and kept me very functional in continuing to work!,Trileptal was the drug my Pdoc RX'd after I'd gone off ALL meds (AWOL!) for 18 months.  When I dragged my sorry butt back in to see him_ I was in a terrible mixed state for a long time_ and was having difficulty working in the medical field. He Rx'd trileptal for me.  I was amazaed at how quickly I was stabilized and had no cognitive side effects such as confusion or retardation. Recently_ after I cycled into a manic phase from corticosteroidal use (RX'd for chronic Lofgren's syndrome)abilify was added which made me experience serious cognitive impairment for which I am on disability now!  So_ I am looking forward to Trileptal by itself again.  Trileptal did not make me gain weight_ it did not impair sex drive_ and I slept well on it_ and I was able to engage in critical thinking! Trileptal is a fantatsic drug for my Bipolar 2!!!  I can't wait to be on it by itself again as I simutaneously taper down off abilify and prednisone!~,F,42,14  months,12/10/2006,Trileptal

Topamax made me stutter_ not care about others_ and bacially started to drive me insane.  I then switched to Trileptal and my entire life improved.  Others around me have commented that I'm a lot easier to get along with than I ever was before.  I feel much less agitated than I used to.

My body seems to be tolerating the drug pretty well!",I have only been on Trileptal for about one month starting out on only 300mg/day and working up to 900mg/day.

I am on 900mg a day in addition to buspar and klonopin_ and it has changed my life. Ever since I took the first dose I have had no manic or depressive periods_ I am excelling in school and work and my relationships are stable. I highly suggest this drug as an option for anyone looking for bipolar control. I just wish it wasn't so friggin' expensive.,M,27,5  months,12/6/2005,Trileptal

Havn't had a seizure since.  Still having episodes (the ""aura"") where I feel like one is coming on but then it goes away.

The vertigo has never quite gone away_ and I am on a mid-range dose (900 mg). Flatness is the worst part_ as all emotions begin to feel peripheral. I have also known myself to fall asleep at the same time every day quite mysteriously_ something that had never happened before trileptal.

I am lucky to be alive. I have a bleeding disorder & the medicine to help me clot also drops my sodium. After it hit 105(norm135-145)I had 3 continual seizures. I've had allergic reactions to Dilantin & Lamictal. Trileptal makes my sodium drop_ the same thing that made me have seizures in the first place. I don't like the way I feel at all right now.  Can't wait for my doctor to change it. I haven't had any more seizures but my EEG's are still abnormal. They said until they are in a normal range I have to remain on something. She gave Keppra as an option. It sounds better than this. Any helpful comments are welcome. I'm new to all these seizure meds.,F,27,3  months,9/18/2005Email,Trileptal
283, 5, Bipolar II,Temporary sleepiness immediately after I take it_ so I take it at night.,This medication works fast and amazingly well for me.  I've been on it for two years and haven't had any mood swings since. It works so well that I sometimes wonder if I really even need it anymore because I've gotten so used to feeling  completely psychologically healthy.   However_ I recently missed several doses and felt myself start to cycle again. It was awful.  2 days after taking regular doses again I've been commpletely stable.  It's always interesting to realize how well the medication works when you get a taste of life without it again.  I am so thankful for this medicine!,F,25,2  years,9/1/2005,Trileptal
