0, 2, Solar Keratosis,"OMG..I was using this all over my chest..basically armpit to armpit_ collarbone to breast..I've had the ""light"" treatment about 6 years ago but the spots never went away..The first day I had nausea-flu/stomach virus like_ diarreha_ and that conintued the full 10 days..After about 3 days_ I had a burning sensation on the applied area_ that got worse and worse..red-firelike appearance.  I was to apply it for 2-6 weeks_ but after the 10 days I couldn't wear a bra_ hadn't slept in 5 nights and was so sick_ I couldn't continue.  Now I am 4 days after and the only thing that has subsided is the diarrhea and flu like symptoms.  my chest is still on fire_ red spots have not gone away and I have to load up with vasoline and aquaphor just so shirts won't run because the slightest touch is unbearable.  I am so dissappointed_ and not a wimp by any means_ but I couldn't continue for even another day.",,F,53,10  days1% 2X D,1/31/2016,Fluorouracil
1, 5, precancer/ssc on face,"The first 9 days were a breeze. In fact_ I thought I had gotten off without a hitch; face was a little red and tight but nothing intolerable. Then_ day 10-21 happened (today is day 21). I can't believe that they describe the side effects as red and itchy_ like ""a bad sun burn."" I have had bad sun burns (hence the flurorouracil) and none of them compared to this stuff. The pain_ coupled with the horrible look is not for the faint hearted. Parts of my face look like something out of the movie frozen and I'm ready to hear it crack open and tinkle to the floor. Sleeping is tough if you normally sleep on your side/belly. My husband tells me they use this product (IV form) for colon cancer.",The alternative is worse so I can't complain but it takes a very brave soul to do this more than once.,F,47,4  weeks5% 2X D,3/16/2015Email,Fluorouracil
2, 5, Actinic Keratoses,I'm in week three (two of fluorouracil_ now Prutect to moisten and heal). It's as everyone described_ but not as bad. It's slightly itchy and I can't wait until I can wash my face again without pain_ but totally bearable. I've been in numerous social situations (work_ dinner out_ board meetings_ shopping_ new Pilates class) without problem. I was afraid children would scream and run at a glimpse of my face. Never happened. So don't let the minor downsides keep you from doing this_ if you need it.,,M,64,14  days5% 2X D,1/21/2012,Fluorouracil
3, 5, Solar keratoses on my face.,No side effects.,"It took about six days until I experienced the effects of the drug that I had read about--redness_blotchiness_tingling_itchiness_taut_sensitive skin. Then_I was in ""full bloom"". It was uncomfortable_ especially in the shower. It was also rather unsightly_ so as another patient said_ I wouldn't plan any important social engagements. After 14 days_it began to peel a lot and formed a few scabs in the worst areas. The worst part for me was having to wash my face twice a day before each application and the cost--$241.00 for a 40 gram tube (with discount_ but no prescription insurance). But I'm sure that's a lot less than dealing with cancer! Per doctor's instructions_ I applied it to my face and forehead_ the tops of my ears and the back of my neck. I'm extremely pleased with the results. It removed all the sandpapery and red spots from all affected areas. I hope not to_ but I'd use it again in a minute.",M,61,14  days5% 2X D,4/17/2010Email,Fluorouracil
4, 4, Genital warts,"The first week I noticed no side effects. Then the doc said watch for ""red & angry""_ and a cpl days later ""red and angry"" indeed. Lobster red and painful in the scrotum/penis area. Cured the warts and they haven't grown back_ so it works.",,M,39,21  days1% 2X D,3/3/2010,Fluorouracil
5, 4, Aetinic (solar) keratoses,I used the 5%.  It turned my face red and crusty_ but_ of course_ it was supposed to.  There was no pain_ just a slight itching.,"I am glad my dermatologist prescribed this medicine.  It is labled as a ""chemotherapy"" because it only attacked pre-cancerous cells.  Don't take it if you have any important social engagements in the next 28 days.",M,58,14  days,6/7/2009Email,Fluorouracil
6, 5, Inoperable Stomach Cancer,Lost skin off soles of feet and palms of hands_ very painful initially but now the soles of my feet are numb.Finger and toenails growth disrupted - discontinuity_ ridging.Lost most of my hairSome Diarrhoea_ nausea and vomiting initiallySore eyesMouth ulcersGot very tired and lethargic,The side effects were pretty horrific and twice I had to stop taking the 5FU partway through a six week session (continuous infusion from a battery operated pump worn around the waist).  However_ the blood markers progressively decreased and are now normal_ so I am in remission.  After 6 weeks off the chemotherapy I have mostly recovered (except for my feet) and don't get so tired - I have resumed my normal lifestyle.,M,71,5  months,6/27/2007Email,Fluorouracil
7, 5, Pre-Cancerous Spot on Lip,"First of all_ my experience with this is similar to one a co-worker had.  It's NASTY stuff!  BE SURE YOU ONLY USE IT WHERE YOU NEED IT! FLUOROPLEXÂ® (fluorouracil) 1% Topical Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of multiple actinic (solar) keratoses.For the first three days_ I didn't notice any reaction. Then_ on the fourth day_ my lip started to redden.  Within a day_ it became terribly inflamed similar to a fever blister (cold sore).  From there_ it got worse by progressing to an ulcerated state.  It was horrible to look at and it hurt like you would not believe!  My dermatologist stopped the cream on Day 10.  From there_ it progressed for several days before I was aware that my lip had begun to heal_ although the healing was from the inside out.  I kept Aquaphor on the ""wound"" to keep it from drying and cracking.  It took a total of 22 days from the onset of treatment to completely healed.",I guess it's worth it_ but I hope I never have to go through that again!,F,39,10  days,10/4/2005,Fluorouracil
