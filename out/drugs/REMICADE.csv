Needless to say I'm no stranger to pain in my life. I've become able to push through most of it all and keep on trucking. In 6 months of using this drug I've lost my job due to recurring illnesses in my lungs_ MAJOR JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN ( narcotics won't touch the pain ) I can barely walk my feet legs hips and muscles ache so terribly. I've been hospitalized for depression 2 times_ and even experienced audio hallucinations. I have high blood pressure and gained 68lbs so far.  My 10 year relationship that had been something of a fairytale now is hanging by a thread due to my lack of libido and irritability... In short_ IM A RAGING BITCH.... but I'm not constantly searching for a restroom. In fact_ I find I'm uncomfortably constipated most of the time ( even experiencing fecal impactions ).    I'd rather be at risk for a flare and spend 2 weeks in the hospital 1-2 times a year than live in this hell...,,F,36,6  months,4/17/2016Email,Remicade

16, 5, Chrons disease,We fought and fought the dr not to take this drug I said this was not worth it the side effects the whole practice kept telling me that my daughter was so sick because of being in and out today the hospital with her flare ups and she was always so depressed with the bathroom visits and then she developed C diff the GI Doctor used this to scare her I said to her this was not it was not a normal situation and it was such a small area of concern in her intestine and the side effects did not out weigh the drug. But she was 18 at the time and decided she wanted to try it he said she had to use 6-mp with it I was like I don't think that is a good Idea he insisted. Few treatments have passed not even a year...So she did this she recently had a follow up visit with him and he Said from her blood test something wrong with her Liver we have to stop the 6-mp and this is where the nightmare has began I had no idea he was such a horrible doctor and did not think clearly what not to do prior to a remicade treatment and what to test for when your liver is like that!!! he said she needed a vaccine  pneumonia  and flu_ so we did (we never should have) then she went for a remicade treatment her very last which we should have never done!!!  we are praying to God her body can recover and she does not develop any cancers or any of these diseases- you see the doctor thought the 6-mp was the problem we went to a hematologist almost had a liver biopsy she was getting worse so tired sleepy.,I wish I knew. If I had not taken my daughter to that last treatment. And that doctor should have tested her for mono he would have known she was sick and not had her get vaccines or a treatment she would not be this sick! I really think a lot of this is the doctors fault and he is trying to place blame on me or ignore the situation. We have gotten a referral to a new Dr. The saddest pet is he referred us and then reached out to the new doctor to discuss her new treatment which makes me more upset!

17, 5, Crohn's Disease,Nothing that I can identify as a direct result of the drug.,I've been taking Remicade every 8-10 weeks for 14 years_ starting when I was about 16 years old. It was a new drug when I started_ and the rapidness with which the administration of the drug has gone from an intensive ICU experience to a very casual environment is apparent. I have been stable since my initial 1-year bout after diagnosis as a result of chronic diarrhea and fistula. Highly recommended_ revolutionized the treatment of this disease.,M,30,14  years 1X O,3/9/2016,Remicade

I feel like as though I have converted back to my teenage years_ before the Crohn's Disease.,Worried about reading all the bad side effects scares me_ but so far_ so good for me. Live each day to your fullest. This has given me better quality of life_ plain and simple. Was told at age of 19_ my probability of reaching 30 was slim.

20, 1, Pediatric Crohns Disease,Remicade at first seemed like a wonder drug. After the first three doses my son was running outside playing_something he never did before.Before the Remicade he had a poor quality of life_ with bouts of depression and anxiety.All the medications had failed ;6mp_pentasa_steroid_flagyl. So his Ped.GI recomended Remicade.He was improving but around month 8 he started having signs of a flare_ his Dr. had the dose raised to a higher theraputic level.A week after the infusion my son was covers from head to toe_even his hair with a strange bright red rash.I brought him to the Dr. They said they have never seen a rash like that ever.No one knows for sure what it is even top knotch universities and teams of Dr.s have no idea really.The most they do know is they believe it's a mutated form of Remicade induced psoriasis.Remicade can trigger psoriasis in people. Now my son has not only Crohns but a strange mutated form of psoriasis.There is no cure for psoriasis.His is so severe the only treatments are methotrexate or light therapy.And if you know you can't mix delivered with chemo drugs because you can get an incurable fatal form of cancer.So we said no thank you.My advice to parents of kids with Crohns_don't listen to these Drs. They're drug company puppets if your child dies they're just a statistic.If your state allows medical marijuana try it for your child.It does wonders for Crohns It puts ppl in remission and no weird side effects.Don't make the same mistake I did_save your selve,Dont use it for your kids Crohns stay far away!!!!!!!!!!!,M,9,1  years,2/26/2016,Remicade

22, 1, Chrons disease,I've had 3 infusions of Remicade and it has ruined my winter.  I used to be very active_ skiing_ enjoying stays at the remote cabin but now I do not want to leave the house.  My GI recommended Remicade to  heal up my rectal fistulas_ and control my symptoms.  Upon the first loading dose I got severe headaches_ felt cold_  nauseous_ tired and weak.  Within  a week I had less bleeding and it appeared to be working.  But after the second infusion I started to bleed more again.  I developed abdominal pain_ and joint pains as well.  A few weeks after the 3 rd infusion I developed a rash on my face as the skin is dry_ itchy and flaky.  My hair is falling out_ I already noticed much more hair on my hair brush after the second infusion.   From the start I found myself urinating more_ and the constant urge to go_ along with swelling on my ankles signaling fluid build up.  Cutting back on salt has helped_ but there are times that I spend the whole night having to get up to urinate every 45 minutes.,This is a serious drug_ and I would recommend to carefully think about it before taking it. I have decide to go off of Remicade and go the all natural route.  I went successfully without treatment for close to ten years and I regret having taken Remicade. I can only hope that I can get my body back on  balance.  Tinkering with the immune system is a very dangerous approach.,M,56,3  months 3X AN,2/24/2016,Remicade

I drink plenty of fluid during the infusion which seems to help so much.Before I was told to do that I was exceptionally fatigued for 4-5 days. Now I just factor in one bad day after.Numbness in my face (left side) is unexplained. Started with my first infusion but has never got worse. Seems to be more noticeable when I'm tired.I've had one bad chest infection while on remicade which developed into pleurisy. I had to delay my infusion to make sure I had completely recovered.,F,,3  yearsunsure 8X W,2/23/2016Email,Remicade
24, 1, Crohn's Disease,Terrible joint and leg muscle pain. Hair loss_ tooth loss_ skin rashes_ debilitating fatigue_ zero quality of life.I would not recommend taking this drug. It is a silent killer and doctors act like it's some sort of miracle drug. I was not warned about any of the side effects (joined the dots from my own research). Every time I would mention the side effects to doctors they would dismiss it and refuse to even consider it could be the Remicade. Please_ please do not let anyone you love or care about take this medication.,Should be banned. Ruined my life and my children's lives.,F,36,4  years,2/14/2016Email,Remicade
25, 1, RA,My husband took remicade in the beginning it worked. The past two years has Been a nightmare. He got a bacterial infection in the joints that he had RA in. This spread into all his bones. He never should have been put on this because of all his years on prednisone. I do not think the doctors are connecting illnesses to the fact a patient is on remicade he spent a week in the hospital with all the symtoms of this bacterial infection that is a cousin to TB. Not one Dr said oh you're on remicade. He also had to have his foot amputated last year because of the damage. He has had over 20 surgeries. Make sure if you're sick with a high temperature and chills you tell your dr or hospital you're on this drug. I think this Bacteria was I his body a long time.

No Energy and bloated for at least 48 hrs_ totally wiped out.  Skin and hair are dry and porous.,Getting Pre-Meds first Solu-Medrol (40mg)_ Benadryl(50)_ Tylenol (500mg)_ without these meds I'm sure the side effects could be a lot worst. I think watching cartoons (fantasia) helps my anxiety during the infusion its a psychological distraction with something that is comforting to me. I have unfortunatly built up antibodies to remicade but my levels of the drug are good_ continuing with combination theropy (azithorine 100mg) to see if this brings my antibodies down sure hope so since this has been the only drug to work (so far) for my Crohns  Disease which Ive had for 8 yrs.

My joint pain is usually in my knees and my hips and it gets really bad sometimes and when thay happens_ I take xtra strength Tylenol/ ibuprophen to help with the pain.

Then it stops until my next infusion. I get treated every six weeks. I am 36 and pray this continues to work. This was my last resort after trying all the other medications they use to treat chrohns.

I had my last & final infusion in Oct 2013. I have mixed feelings about this drug. Not being keen on the idea of getting infusions_ I had nixed Remicade whenever my doc suggested it. Fast forward a few years and mid-flare_ I was no longer responding to Pentasa and doc said it's either Remicade or surgery. I've stubbornly refused surgery in the 13 years with this disease (which is the best decision I've ever made) and I wasn't about to give in_ so I signed up for Remicade. There's no doubt it made me feel better in the first few months but the negative side effects and the tedious process of administering the drug were outweighing the postives for me. That and the cost... even with insurance & Remistart_ this drug is expensive!! So with the blessing of my doc_ I quit taking it...or any drugs. Ultimately the best thing Remicade did for me was push me to take responsibility for my own health and change my diet to Paleo_ which has helped me feel truly healthy for the first time since being diagnosed with CD.

94, 2, Crohn's and reactive arthritis,Itchy between infusions_ increasing nausea after infusion even though I was taking anti-histamines. Sadness.,"I took Remicade for a year and came off approximately 2.5 months ago. It worked well for both my crohn's and reactive arthritis. However_ the infusions made me increasingly nauseous and itchy - I've never had allergic reactions and now I seem to be allergic to a whole range of things. Remicade? The last infusion made me feel very ill and my feet and face were itching_ etc. Eight weeks later when I went in for the next dose I told the nurse how I had felt_ she spoke to the doctor and they decided they didn't want to do the infusion until I had spoken to my Rheumatologist. I made an apt with the Rheumatologist and when I told him he said (very casually) ""it's lucky you didn't take it_ you could have died"". Now I don't want to be a panic merchant_ however_ I wasn't told when I began Remicade that the allergy to the drug can increase over infusions and can potentially be fatal. If you have allergy symptoms (I was even taking anti-histamines)_ just be careful_ especially if they become greater with each infusion. Dr wanted me to swap to Humira_ but after the Remicade experience I'm just too chicken. I'm not on anything now except huge quantities of fish oil and magnesium. It's nerve-wracking because I've been on drugs forever_ but I actually do feel so much better mentally and physically and this is possibly a result of the Remicade as it can intervene in the course of the disease.

113, 5, Ulcerative colitis,I was diagnosed in 2001 with u.c. and was managed with asacol and rowasa at times. I eventually started flaring more often requiring prednisone. Each flare it took longer for the prednisone to work and my doctor highly recommended I start remicade. I was hesitant and waited a few months until I had 2 flares close together. I started remicade in November 2009 and had immediate results. The first thing I noticed was that my very painful and frequent abdominal cramps disappeared. My first treatment gave me a significant headache but beyond that_ I don't have any side effects. I do have achy joints but I know that goes along with u.c. I've also gained about 15 pounds since starting my treatment. Remicade changed my life for the better and I wouldn't give it up.

Arthritis in my hands and knees_ tendonitis in my achilles tendons_ dry inflamed eyes.,Remicade did nothing for my UC_ but it ruined the rest of my body.  I haven't taken it in 3 months and never will again_ but the side effects still remain. I hope to God they will go away.  I had only 3 loading doses_ and on the 3rd one I had a horrible reaction where I couldn't breath and started sweating profusely-- instead of stopping the infusion_ they just shot me up with a bunch of stuff to stop my reaction and continued till the bag was empty.   I used to have oily hair and skin_ now I'm dry and brittle... I could go a year without washing my hair that's how dry it is.  I have so much pain from the arthritis it gave me_ and I can barely open my eyes at night because they are glued to my eyeballs from being so dry at night.  It hurts to walk because of the pain in my achilles tendons.  All of my hair is falling out. I used to have thick thick long hair_ now I only have 1/3 of it left and it's still falling out I won't be surprised if I go bald.  So much has fallen out that I have a strange receding hairline.  This is the worst drug you could ever take for UC.  I never knew that there were mice antibodies or proteins in there_ which is what causes these horrible reactions.

Although this drug anitially worked really well I have found recently it is loosing it's effectivness so from my next treatment in four weeks time i will be on the higher 10mg dose as symptoms are not getting properly under control. doctors are going to run tests to see if i am builing up antibiodies to the drug or metabolising it too quickly.

I guess it will depend on whether I have something life threatening from it after further testing.  I was always afraid of Remicade given its strength and the side effects that are possible hence me getting it every 10-12 wks instead of every 8.  Given the extent of my disease_ my GI really encouraged me to use it.  I do think it played a role in me being in remission (or close to it anyway) for a decade or longer.

I saw results with Remicade immediately after the 1st infusion. After a year of Remicade I developed severe joint pain and discussed the risks and benefits with my GI. He told me I could go back on Remicade if severe UC symptoms returned. It might not work as well_ or as fast_ but it was an option. That's all I needed to hear to stop it.

But_ I feel that the Remicade has caused a joint problem.,I was prescribed Remicade after trying oral medications (Asacol_ Colozal_ Prednisone_ Imuran_ Sulfasalazine)_ and it worked practically  immediately. I am supposed to get my infusions every 8 weeks_ however_ sometimes I wait 10-12 weeks. After 8 weeks_ I start to get random joint pains in the evening which worsen as the night progresses. It is typically a different joint each night_ and the pain is very focal within a tendon or ligament. The pain gets so bad that I often have to take medication just to sleep. By the morning_ the pain is mostly resolved. When I get my Remicade infusion_ the joint pains stop. I haven't had intestinal symptoms since starting the Remicade_ but these joint pains are awful.

166, 1, Crohn's,I was getting an infusion once every 8 weeks,One word: Histoplasmosis.  I haven't seen it here. I didn't know what it was until it almost killed me.  It was caused because my immune system was so compromised that when I went to the Southern region of the US I got a fungal infection called Histoplasmosis. I was in the hospital for 28 days. The docs couldn't figure out what was wrong. My kidneys and heart were starting to fail. Had to go through a lung and liver biopsy. They thought it was a lung infection.  Once they finally figured it out and treated me I get better. But people don't know this can happen.  I had a high fever and generally felt bad for about a week before I was admitted to the hospital. Saw my regular doc and he gave me anit-biotics for bronchitis_ but I kept getting worse. I didn't realise how sick I was until my daughter made me go and took me to the ER.

First infusion_ then 1 week later_ - 2nd infusion_ then 8 weeks the following. It totally helped the RA pain and I felt pretty good except for my hair falling out and the ""lupus-like"" rashes on my face and body. This medicine is made from mice cells in case you don't know.  My favorite biological drug was Humira self injections - made from human cells. Very little side effects. It was my miracle drug. Because of the copays on Medicare (over $600 a month)_ I cannot afford Humira.  My copays for Remicade went from zero in 2010 to $569 in 2011 per infusion.  But it is not every month like Humira.

I was still on Imuran (azathioprine) when I first started Remicade_ but my new doc took me off to see if my fatigue would get better.My abdominal pain improved within a few months after starting Remicade but the bloody_ frequent stools continued for about a year. I did not have a miraculous cure in the first week or even the first 6 months. I was also taking Apriso 4 capsules in the morning. I tried increasing the dose of the Apriso to 8 a day for about 8 weeks but that didn't help. Then I tried taking 4 Colazol at night with the 4 Apriso in the morning_ and within a couple of weeks things got better. I think I also have irritable bowel syndrome_ as well as the UC. I take probiotics and fiber. I would really like to have my doc cut the dose or frequency of the Remicade and see if my mood and energy improve.

I believe Remicade can work really well for some people and not at all for others and that our opinions are based on our experiances_ which have a wide range of results.

I have no tolorence for physical labor without consequences. Recently_ my hip joints have added themselves to the list.  I feel 20 years older in the two that I have been on the drug,"I am taking 6 vials every 8 weeks. lost 70 lbs and had a 5 day hospital stay prior to starting remicade. was down to jello and soup. Now i eat what i want. Remicade is keeping my gut in remission_ but carries a heavy burden in side effect baggage. My doctor seems to discount my complaints because my SED rate and other blood work does not support then pain I am feeling.  I feel trapped taking a medicine that is slowly eroding my quality of life.  Two years ago i was doing a large pavestone project and now I pay for it if I do even a little physical work.

When I initially started I had GI problems and my GI tract was 60% ulcerated from my mouth to my anus and I had lost 30 lbs in a few weeks.  Right now I am getting 800mg every six weeks_ but about two weeks prior to the infusion I start to feel my symptoms coming back and am extremely fatigued.

(About 9 weeks apart) Then notice right hand and fingers tight or locked up.

I have some dizziness about once or twice a day after treatment for a week or so.,However_ I can at least use my fingers now.  Prior to Remicade I could hardly bend my fingers.  I have been through Humira which worked great for about 2 years then became ineffective.  Then tried Cimzia which lasted about 2 months.  Then tried Enbrel which had no effect.  During the Cimzia and Enbrel I was also on Methotrexate which exacerbated my asthma and caused my hair to start falling out.  Stopped that myself and then my rheumatologist started me on remicade.

Like someone was sitting on my chest_ a feeling of pressure. I already recieved Tavegil_ but I still had that same reaction. Next week I'm having another iv_ including some more medication. Something like hydrocortisone or Prednison. I'm not sure what_ but if it works? Why not???I must say_ I'm realy happy with the results. My joints are alot less inflammed and_ finally_ I'm enjoying life.,A few years ago_ no doctor knew what to do with my inflammed joints. There weren't any drugs I didn't try of have tried. My artrithis was so bad_ all I could do was wait for a new drug. Because of my situation (two types of artrithis_ 25 years of dissease and so much more...) it's hard to find medication that suits. With Remicade_ I got my life back_ after 8 years of total destruction. All I want to say is_ that there's for everyone something good and a drug that helps. Just don't give up!

226, 1, Ulcerative Colitis,About 5 days after my first infusion_ I developed severe_ excruciating lower back and hip pain that was a 10+ on my pain scale. Pain medications would not relieve this and I could not walk. As the days progressed_ it go worse and would show up in a different joint every night.  My only relief was that it would go away by morning.  However_ then I was tired all day from lost sleep. I had never had joint pain in my life before. I told my doctors no more Remicade and cancelled my second infusion. The pain let up after 12 days only to start up again last night. I am worried it may never go away.,Not worth the joint pain! I can't believe this started after one infusion. I didn't even want to take this medication and already decided I would rather have surgery than deal with what I felt was a dangerous drug. However_ I was in the hospital for two weeks with a flare that wouldn't respond to steroids and was rapidly losing weight and getting sicker. My doctor wanted to end my flare and get me strong again for surgery using 3 infusions of Remicade as an intermediate step. Thinking that only 3 infusions couldn't possibly cause permanent problems_ I agreed. The 1st infusion did end the flare but then the intense joint pain started. I have heard that the pain is usually temporary so I am crossing my fingers. I would hate to cure my UC with surgery only to be left with the debilitating joint pain from the one infusion of Remicade.,F,38,17  days? 1X D,10/18/2010,Remicade

I had some serious joint pain_ head aches and dealthy low blood pressure. I also felt like I stopped breathing when I would relax_ and it had been really hard to breath for about two weeks after my second infusion. I also experienced numbness and tingling in my hands and feet and I was extremely nervous and anxious feeling PLUS my hair was falling out in chunks in the shower. This all lasted for about two weeks after my second infusion.,I am really nervous to get my third infusion_ all of those side effects freaked me out but they only lasted two weeks and I haven't seen blood in any of my stools since and I can leave my house now and not worry about having an accident. It has really improved my stomach and bowel movement problems and relieved me of bleeding to death. But I'm still not sure if it is worth taking again due to all of the other crazy side effects. The goodness kind of out weighs the bad_ I mean I felt shitty for a couple of weeks but felt fucking fantastic for two months other than an irritated throat.

Non day 4 after last infusion I am still extremely tired but at least my joints are getting back to where they were before the infusion.,I am underwhelmed by this medication's effectiveness. It has been nothing like the first time I took Enbrel_ which gave me the sensation for the first time in my life what it would be like to live without JRA. Unfortunately_ Enbrel stopped working for me. My doctor has increased the dosage of Remicade several times to see if it's a dosage issue. With this last cycle_ I feel like it gave out about a week short of my infusion date. I learned from the nurses that sometimes the doctor will shorten the period between infusions. I take this in addition to prednisone and methotrexate injections (and a few other medications). Have to admit I am not always timely with the methotrexate injections so I can't say if this regime is effective due to user error. :-) I am thankful that this medication allowed me to stop doing 2 of 3 self-administered injections per week.

No other side effects noted to date.,The effects of my UC and RA were initially pretty severe.  I was hospitalized for 6 weeks and had recieved many blood infusions.  My left knee was operated upon.

Prior to this regimen I had used crutches to walk (when I walked at all) and had my weight go from 65 kg to 90 kg.  Now I walk without crutches and have lost 20 kg of the weight.

I was about 95% clear throughout the summer of 2009 until November_ and then my Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis began to slowly return.  Now my Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis are worse now then before the started taking the infusion.  My joints now hurt more then ever before and I feel tired a lot more now.  I guess my body has slowly built up immunity to the drug.  My doctor was having me take the infusion once every 8 weeks_ but now has switched it to once every 7 weeks.  I am very pessimistic that this will make any difference.,I have been suffering with Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis for nearly 13 years.  It started when I was 42 years old.  Prior to that_ I never had Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis.  Two of my brothers have suffered with it for almost their entire lives.  The Psoriasis covers about 70% of my body mostly on the legs_ arms_ scalp_ and front torso.  However_ my back is relatively clear. Since the Remicade stopped working my Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis is now spreading like wild fire.  If the once every 7-week treatment does not work_ my doctor will try increasing the dosage to see if that helps.  I just hope it does!

242, 5, UC,I have had 3 infusions and will be going for the forth next week.  After the second infusion I got Shingles.  I am sure that was due to the compromised immune system because of Remicade.  Not sure that shingles are a typical side effect.  I did not realize it was shingles until the rash appeared.  I didn't know that shingles causes internal pain- severe pain - I thought I had a kidney stone.  I have had some joint pain_ but I am not sure if that is from the Prednisone_ Remicade_ or age.  I was also pretty fatigued for a week or so after the infusions.  Again_ not sure if it was the Remicade or just the healing process.,I have had UC for almost 20 years.  Flare ups are usually far between_ but when I have one it usually starts out mild and gradually escalates.  Asacol and Prednisone are typically prescribed.  Prednisone usually does the trick.  After several months of mild to moderate UC flare up (latest one)_ the flare up got worse.  Was on Asacol for several months when symptoms got worse added Predisone.  After adding Prednisone the flare up turned severe - not typical reation for me. I thought I had e coli.  Severe diarrhea_ 10-20 times a day and through the night which was very unusual for my UC. Dr. discussed Remicade.  I was so dehidrated my legs were cramped to the point I could barely walk.  Was hospitalized for 6 days.  IV and clear liquids only for 5 days. Constant diarrhea day and night. Remicade infusion on day 4 (had to wait for salmonella test results). Day 4 and night 4 dramatic reduction in bathroom trips.  Day 5 I was like a new person. It has been 7 weeks since my last infusion and I feel good_ but seem to be having very mild symptoms again.    Overall I am thrilled with my results from the Remicade_ however I still have concerns about continued treatments.

245, 4, psoriatic arthritis and Iritis,I had my first infusion treatment yesterday. I was really tired most of the day and slept on and off. By the evening I started to have sharp pains in my hips and joints (mainly hands and feet). Continuing to have the sharp pains_ its getting worse. However I woke up and noticed a big difference in my eye.,I really hope this works with little or livable side effects. I've had PA for two years and was on a Embrel and Leflunomide (Arava)conbo that was working really well until this year when I started having iritis. Is anyone else taking Remicade for iritis?

248, 5, Crohn's,I had my first infusion last week after nearly 2 months of a sever flare up.  Lost 30 pounds in 4 weeks and could not eat any solid food. Lots of blood in my stool_ nausea_ fatique_ etc.  When I ended up in a wheel chair because I had such severe joint pain_all hell broke loose and I had every test imaginable - ultrasounds_ catscan_ colonscopy...I had ulcers throughout my body from the tip of my tongue to my intestines.  Went on Asacol and Entocort for about a month which did absolutely nothing.  Added Prednisone which helped quite a bit but I could only sleep about 3 hours a night because the steroid makes me feel like I an wired 24/7.  Added Ambien into the mix to sleep.  Want to get off the steroid_ but can't until we are sure about the Remicade effect.,Took Benadryl before the Remicade treatment began which made me sleepy.  After the treatment_ I was tired but the next day I felt really good.  Its only been a week and 1/2 but I have not had any negative side effects at all.  After 2 months of constant bloody bowel movements and feeling horrible all of the time_ I am hopeful that Remicade is the answer I have been looking for.  The side effects described on this site are very scary not as scary as living with serious Crohn's flare ups.,F,45,10  days 1X D,4/29/2010,Remicade
249, 5, Rectal Abcess related to Crohns,I was first introduced to Remicade in 2003 after surgery for a Rectal Abcess. (would not wish on my own worst enemy)The Abcess was Crohns related. I was diagnosed with Crohns when I was 8 years old. I am 32 now. The Remicade pretty much kept the Abcess under control. In 2006 and 2007 I was no longer taking the Remicade and once again developed the Abcess. I needed surgery once again to correct the situations. Since the last Abcess surgery in 2007 I have consitantly taken an infusion of Remicade every 6-8 weeks. The results have been great! Additionally since 2007 I have been taking 6mp and prilosec every day. But than again this is nothing in comparison to what I have gone thru from Chrohns. Like I said I was diagnosed at 8. Been on every drug in the book during the time of 8 to 19. Always led a normal life untill 19. That is when Chrohns nearly killed me. Was in and out of the hospital thru out the year of 1997. Had every side effect and syptom in the book_ hair loss_ body odor_ back,When I first started the Remicade I was given Benadryl which is used to counter any side effects you may develope during infusion. I have to admit the Benadryl really kicked my a**. It makes you very sleepy and gives off a horrible burning and stinging sensation in the arm. After time I asked to not have the Benadryl. No problems without it thankfully. The only side effects I feel after infusion is a headache and that I am very tired. This occurs hours and the next day. These effects usually clear up in a few days.,M,32,3  years 1X O,4/28/2010Email,Remicade
250, 1, Ulcerative Colitis,Extreme_ horrible back and chest pain.  I have also had joint pain in my knees and fingers.  It has been about a month since my third treatment_ and the pain is getting worse.  Cannot take deep breaths_ sneeze or cough without horrible pain in my back_ and it feels like someone is standing on my chest.  My doctor took me off the drug immediately_ and told me the side effects will eventually go away.  We will see.,The medicine has not even made any improvement in my UC whatsoever.  The risks are not worth the possible benefits_ of which there were none for me_ anyway.,F,28,3  months 1X O,4/25/2010,Remicade
251, 4, Crohns disease,No major side effects.  Just sleepy on the day of infusion.  Feel great on remicade.  Crohn's symptoms pretty minimal.  Very physically active and lead a fast paced life with family.,Started taking remicade to treat fistula 16 months ago.  I've had crohns for 25 years.  Had 2 bowel resections_ and the last one was 8 years ago.  Just had my 9th remicade infusion.  I get them every 8 weeks.  Started with 500mg then moved up to 900mg.  I'm also on flagyl_ iron_ folic acid and still taking pentasa 500mg per day.  My GI doc said to not bother with the pentasa but I do find it makes a difference after week 6.  However_ fistula is still there and my GI doc now wants me to go on Imuran and continue with the remicade.  I've read lots of really negative reviews of Imuran.  Crohn's has never freaked me out - but the Imuran stuff looks scary...ie. hair loss_ warts_ skin tags_ yellow skin_ and on and on.  Anyone taking both remicade and imuran?  What has your experience been?  Thanks,M,40,16  months900mg 8X W,3/30/2010Email,Remicade
252, 4, UC,Had some joint pain_ but it's gone. Itching isn't too bad and there's no rash - thankfully! Some back pain_  not too bad. The worse is the sinuses - I'm dry_ I'm runny_ I'm stuffy. It's more aggravating than anything.,I've had UC since 1986 and once I went into remission (which was fairly quickly_ I've only had about 5 flares. Each lasted a month or so. I was on Asacol for years and that worked great until March of 2009. I had a major flare that has lasted till now. I was on steroids until last month and I started Remicade last October. The Remicade worked ok_ but not completely. I was having infusions every 8 weeks. As soon as the steroids got out of my system_ the side effects of Remicade started. After my last infusion - last week_ the difference has been amazing. Yes_ I'm feeling some side effects_ but I haven't had any bleeding since that infusion and I've never felt better. I'm really hoping that the steroids were not only masking the side effects_ but were also hindering the healing. Time will tell_ I guess.,F,49,5  months 1X O,3/20/2010,Remicade

He has been exhausted to the point of being able to sleep all day or falling asleep unexpectedly while up. He has also been having headaches. He has started jerking and twitching in his sleep.,He has also been on Methotrexate 2.5 mg for 2 months.

257, 4, Crohns,Lots_ I suppose the worst was the ulcers_ lots of extreme pain_ a good bit beyond the regular extreme pain of an extremely raw and inflamed stomach. Arthritis_ keeps getting worse_ tylenol arthritis barely helps. Constant sore throat_ congestion_ headache_ really weird sleep (insomnia_ wake up going crazy (never happened in my life before)_night sweats)_ constant backache_ increased frequency for urination. I guess there are a bunch of internal things too_ gastritis_ esophagitis_ ulcers_ i forgot the other stuff but it wasn't pretty. The arthritis and body problems only started up maybe in my last couple treatmments but even since it stopped taking it over 2 months ago_ its worsening. Can hardly type now_ can barely open bottles of juice_ when I wake up I literally cannot bend my fingers for 5 minutes. The ulcers healed and I am still drugged up good_ on a pretty good crohns definition of quality of life (you know only 6 trips to the bathroom a day_ eating nice rich foods like rice,After the first two infusions I started to know big differences_ i was able to eat a lot more_ put on muscle from lifting. I could excercise a lot more_ better sleep_ less bathroom scares. Could finally sit in a car for more than 15 minutes without having an emergency. I actually didn't feel that much pain if any for about a year on the infusions_ never had any reaction with the IV or anything.

I question if it is possible that my system is no longer doing a much needed function because it assumes the Remicade will do it.  I do not have arthritis and I have no history of it.,Remicade_ has in many ways_enabled me to live a fuller life.  I go longer between surgery's_ eat more_ go out more often and go the the bathroom less often.   My two greatest concerns are1.The cost -is horrendous $12_000.00 a treatment and at 4 to 5 treatments a year_(not counting Dr's visits_ test_ surgery's and meds) how long will I be able to live within my insurance cap. 2. What will the long term effects be??,F,50,12  years,10/15/2009Email,Remicade
284, 4, Crohn's Disease,Intermittent rashes for the first 3 months or so on the Remicade_ frequent colds starting at about 5 months_ and intermittent mild nausea which may or may not be related.,I have been on Remicade for about 9 or 10 months now for Crohn's Disease (which was originally Ulcerative Colitis when diagnosed 11 years ago_ and has slowly converted since then after 8 IBD-related surgeries). I became hot and nauseous during the first infusion and am now premedicated with tylenol and IV Benadryl before each infusion and I no longer experience infusion-related side effects. I had my Remicade level checked through a blood test a couple months ago and it was found that at 6 weeks since the last infusion_ my level was undetectable and therefore not therapeutic. I am now being infused every 6 weeks instead of 8_ and am to have the level re-checked prior to my next infusion. We may increase it to 5 weeks or increase the dose (currently getting 300mg - 5mg/kg). It took about 6 months to start working_ but I am now beginning to notice some changes in my symptoms_ and endoscopically my inflammation appears to be improving.,F,23,10  months,10/8/2009,Remicade
285, 5, UC,I have had a sinus infection and a urinary track infection- which is the first time I have had one. I am sleepy during infusion b'cause of benadryl but totally energized for weeks after (it feels great) then by the six week it start to feel like I need it again. I am having it now every 8 weeks which probably will change due to bleeding and abdominal pain.,It has been a life saver! I was diagnosed with UC at 16. I was not having any major problems for about 20 years.  Then one day I got so sick I almost died and I have been sick ever since. I was in and out of hospitals until a new Dr offered Remicade. I have had 5 infusions and it has given me my life back.  The Lord has been gracious to me!,F,40,3  months,10/1/2009,Remicade
286, 4, Ulcerative Colities,I have dealt with most muscle pain and itchiness and hives. I have gotten the hives mostly when I am hot or on hot days. The itchiness is the same as the hives. I get muscle pain almost everyday. I used to be active(as active as you could be with UC) and now I get tired and sore so fast.,I have had UC for 17 years. I will gladly take these side effects for giving me an overall better quality of life. I have many problems from being on steroids so many times. I am glad to not be taking 25 pills a day anymore. I do have Osteoperosis and take Boniva due to use of so much prednisone over the years. Remicade has been a great alternative.,M,28,10  months,9/22/2009Email,Remicade
287, 5, Crohns,Itching_ usually just in the evenings. Have changed from 8/7 week schedule to a consistent 6 week schedule. No itching issues prior to this summer. Also dealing with protein deficiency and swollen ankles by end of day.,Very pleased; bowel-resection 5+ years ago and no major flare ups since. Drowsiness from Benadryl; although I welcome the additional rest. Usually take rest of day off and take it easy the next day.,M,34,5  years,9/20/2009Email,Remicade
288, 1, I have Crohn's disease,I just had my third treatment about 3 weeks ago and during the treatment i started feeling really hot_swollen_ and i couldnt breathe. The doctors finally came to check me and gave me oxygen and benadryl then i felt fine. They gave me the rest of the treatment slowly and sent me home. I woke up that night in tears i couldnt move. My boyfriend had to take me to the hospital all side affects from remicade. My docotor told me i got short term lopus from this medication and arthritus. At first the treatment was working the best then any of the others ive been given and now they took me off cause they reactions. Not something you want to go through all the time.,I wish everyone the best of luck when taking this treatment. Make sure to consult your doctors if you start getting any new problems!,F,22,4  months,9/9/2009,Remicade
289, 4, UC,Definite thinning of the hair.  Fortunately I had a lot of hair but now it is thinner and finer.  No bald spots mind you.,Posting for my daughter so we can give everyone information to add to their knowledge of this drug.  It worked GREAT for 2 1/2 years until her body started building antibodies and she stopped feeling so good for about six months.  No flares until the end-then the colonoscopy showed the disease had travel from just the rectum/left side to the entire colon.  DRAT!  But Remicade doesn't stop the disease just minimizes the reaction of the body to it.  So_ we had to go off Remicade and are now using Lialda tablets_ which are holding her.  We went from infusions every 8 weeks to 4 pills every morning and nightly Canasa suppositories when she'll use them.  Remicade worked-it was scarey to think of the potential long term-but if it works for you and you have quality of life instead of being chained to the toilet_ unable to function.  Four years ago we hadn't heard of this disease-now we are learning to live with it.  Good luck to all!  From Ash's mom.,F,20,3  years,8/27/2009Email,Remicade

293, 5, Crohn's Disease,None that I'm aware of_ other than sleepiness the day of the infusion from the Benadryl.,This drug has given me my life back!  I take it every 6 weeks and feel like I don't even have Crohn's.  I may be developing a resistance to the drug though_ as I used to only need infusions every 8 weeks but now have symptoms at 6 weeks.  Hopefully the drug will continue to work for me until other options are available.,F,33,5  years,8/13/2009,Remicade
294, 2, rheumatoid arthritis,I am extremely tired_ have low grade nausea_ slight fever_ night sweats_ bleeding under skin_ hives_ itching,I have called my doctor.  He is going to arrange blood work.  I am sure he is going to stop this treatment.,F,60,4  months,8/7/2009,Remicade
295, 1, Crohn's,Stopped breathing,Horrible_ almost died.  All other crohn's meds had terrible side effects too.  Tried Maker's Diet (get in any book store).  Symptom-free for 2 years now.  On no meds at all.  Please try.,F,26,2  months,8/4/2009,Remicade
296, 4, Psoriatic Arthritis,No major side effects. Have found that for a few days up to a week after an infusion I have VERY vivid dreams that tend to wake me up.  Not nightmares_ just LOTS and LOTS of dreams_ so not really a restful sleep on those nights.  Seems odd_ and no one else has ever mentioned it_ but I can't pinpoint anything else that's different during those periods following the infusion that would cause this.,So far the drug is working well for me - though I still have a few spots of the psoriasis that stay inflamed.  However_ they're small and hidden from view_ so I can deal with that.  The arthritis discomfort only bothers me as I get within a week or two of my next infusion.  I often wonder if I'm at the top of a weight range for my dosage and if I were to lose a few extra pounds would the treatment last beyond the 8 week cycle I'm on.,M,45,18  months,7/31/2009,Remicade
297, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,Was on Remicade between 2003-2006 for UC with instant remission and no side effects.  No flareups after quitting in 2006 until April_ 2009.  Started Remicade again in June_ 2009.  Remission didn't come until a couple of weeks after 2nd infusion and beginning about June_ 2009_ I've noticed some hair thinning and itchy scalp.  This didn't happen during my 2003-2006 Remicade treatment.  Does anyone else have experience with thinning hair?  Is it permanent? Is it continuous? (Will I eventually go bald?),No other side effects and/or problems.  It stopped the UC when prednisone wouldn't_ even high doses (40-60 mg/day).,M,50,2  months,7/30/2009Email,Remicade
298, 3, Crohn's,It is really the only thing that has meant my son is back at school most of the time and does seem to make a difference to his fistula. However_ he has recently had a lot of problems with swollen lymph nodes_ sore cracked mouth_ dry itchy skin_ ear infections and fevers which were put down to a virus. I am concerned they may be side effects of being on the drug for 2 years. Has anyone else had these symptoms?,,M,13,2  years,7/30/2009,Remicade
299, 5, RA,I experience fatigue for about a day and a half after the infusion and my joints are a bit sore for a few days.,Remicade is a godsend for me.  I was in extreme pain before the infusions_ to the point that I could hardly move and I slept all the time.  Within a few days of my first infusion I was my old self again.  I still have lower level pain daily and stiffness in my joints so I take pain killers too_ but my quality of life is so much better now.  I've had to increase my dose once since I started_ but it's still working.  I love it.,F,38,10  months,7/21/2009,Remicade
300, 5, Chrons,Very tired same day due to the Benedryl_ Dr. cut the Benedryl dose in half and now I just feel a bit tired.  Skin was dry but I take a good olive oil or Omega 3 supplement & lots of water and it seems fine now.,I have had no noticable side effects from it.  But I exercise_ eat healthy_ and also see a homeopathic doctor to help me with good quality supplements & food choices.  I still have foods that disagree with me_ but that is just my system_ not everyone can eat everything.  Eat Right for your Blood type is an interesting concept that I have looked into and implemented a lot of its concept to my every day eating habits.  My only concern is still having children being on this medication_ but Mayo clinic said I would be fine?  Anyone have kids on this?,F,40,2.5  years,7/21/2009,Remicade
301, 5, psoriasis,I cannot sleep the night following treatment and I am exhausted for 3-4 days following treatment.,I receive treatment with Remicade every 8 weeks. I also get weekly Methotrexate injections. I've had 7 Remicade treatments so far. I've previously tried numerous treatments including Enbrel and Humira - all with limited success.  I had extensive psoriasis prior to treatment with Remicade. I have no signs of psoriasis at the moment.,F,53,7  months,7/20/2009,Remicade
302, 5, Behcet's,Not really sure if I have any but it perhaps is the cause of sharp pains that I get in my hip (especially apparent at the end of each 8 week Remicade cycle).  Also I have recently developed an annoying persistent itch at the bottom of my thumb....,I have been taking Remicade for a year and a half and it has_ without doubt_ kept my Behcet's symptoms from flaring up - my eyes have been completely inflamation free and mouth has had no ulcers.  In short_ Remicade has been a Godsend for me.,M,34,18  months,7/13/2009,Remicade
303, 4, Psoriasis,I've been on Remicade for about 18mo. I had a reaction to the last two infusions given 4wks apart. A nurse comes to my home to administer the infusion so I'm not at any kind of hospital where a doctor is present so these episodes were very scary. In both cases_ approximately 2-3min after starting the infusion I had a tightening in my chest and throat. A tickling sensation in my throat caused me to caugh but I couldn't catch my breath. The nurse said my face became extremely red_ I felt very hot from the chest up and sort of lathargic. I take two Tylenols and a Zyrtec a half hour before the infusion begins. Even with this the nurse had to stop the infusion and pump me full of benedryl.  After the benedryl was administered we continued with the infusion with no further incidents. Just extreme fatigue when finished. The whole situation seems strange to me because I've been taking this medicine for over a year and am just now starting to have a bad reaction - allergic reaction I'm pretty s,I've been on Remicade for about 18mo. 85% of my body is covered in psoriasis. I've used Embrel_ Humira_ and now Remicade. With each medication I would clear up within a day or two of the treatment but after a while the drug stops working_ like my body is building up an immunity to the drug.  I started out getting infused with Remicade every 8wks with 400mg. Now I get infused every 4wks with 700mg_ with no noticable change in psoriasis.  Since I started on Remicade I now have extremely painful arthritis_ recently diagnosed as psoriatic arthritis. My doctor is now having me take 10mg of methatrexate to keep my body from building up immunity to the treatment.  Hopefully_ I will see results this time. My last infusion was this morning and I begin taking the methatrexate tomorrow_ 10mg once per week. I really hope this works_ we'll see. I will report back.,M,35,18  months,7/11/2009Email,Remicade
304, 4, Crohns and rhumetoid arthritis,fatigue_ less pain_ hasnt stopped it but definently slowed it down,I know when i get close to next treatment I definetly know when its close to my nest session_ when i dealt with my cancer i was not allowed to have it and i definently missed it. it has some side affects but so far it helps more than hurts i hate the steroids,F,48,3  years,7/10/2009,Remicade
305, 5, Crohn's,One episode of shingles.  Sleepy after infusions.,My son has had 7 Remicade infusions.  He gets one every 8 weeks.  His Crohn's symptoms have completely disappeared.  He can even eat corn again. This is the only medication that has worked for him.  Before starting Remicade_ we tried Pentasa_ Prednisone_ Flagyl_ and Imuran.  None of them worked consistently.  He's been symptom free for almost 6 months now. The only drawback is the cost.  It's about $2_000 per infusion - thank God for insurance!,M,14,8  months,7/1/2009,Remicade
306, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,No side effects-although_ I can't tell if the hair thinning was only from the initial prednisone or the Remicade also.  I have just developed antibodies to the mouse protein in Remicade_ so I have to go off_ darn  it! And it is very expensive-thank goodness for good insurance.,Remicade was a life-saver for almost three years.  It kept my symptoms under control.  I had infusions every eight weeks.  Now I have developed antibodies to the mouse protein in  Remicade_ so I will need to try something else-hopefully Humira_ will work for me.  It was great while it lasted.,F,20,3  years,6/17/2009Email,Remicade
307, 5, crohn's and AS arthritis,In the beginning I didn't have much of any side effects besides the cramping and tired feeling but as I have continued taking Remicade treatments I have extreme dry skin_ rash on my neck and face which comes and goes_ very tired and extreme cramping with bleeding and diarrhea.,I agree this drug has been a life saver for me. I was so sick before Remicade I was in pain 24/7....going to the bathroom 15 to 20x a day_ bleeding and couldn't eat anything without it going right through me. It increased my appetite a lot. This has not only helped my Crohn's but it has also helped my arthritis. After years of being on this drug I believe it is causing the reactions I am now facing....high blood pressure. I have PVC's which have increased with the blood pressure. I have very dry skin_ extremely tired all the time. I no longer have the great energy this drug gave in the beginning. I have been on all sorts of drugs over the 19 years after being diagnosed. I even took the 6mp along with the treatments. I stopped taking the 6mp about a year ago. I am taking Asocol now with the Remicade. I worry about the long term effects of all this poison that has entered my body to fight to have a some what normal life. This is very serious and scary but if I stop Remicade....that scares me even more....I guess I have to weigh the lesser of evils and pray I make the right decision. I have my treatments every 4 weeks with the dose being in the middle to high level. The doc had to increase it due to the terrible pain and problems from Chron's disease.,F,48,5  years,5/29/2009Email,Remicade

Crohns returned in 1999.  Remicade has kept me from undergoing additional surgeries and keeps the obstructions and other symptoms under control and manageable.

Not a big deal.,Although I was initially quite hesitent about being on a biologic my moderate\severe RA symptoms were better within a week of my first infusion.  Nodules dissapeared_ my energy increased_ and the pain was significantly lessened.  It has maintained it's efficacy over the three or so years I've been on it.

Cold sores.,Despite all the side effects it has helped my Crohns a lot. I am_ however very concerned about the potential side effects- cancer_ infection_ Lupus etc. So concerned that I may cease this treatment.

318, 3, Crohn's,DX'd with Crohn's 7 years ago. I was in and out of the hospital with severe flares and weight loss_ meds were not helping. Then my GI suggested Remicade. After my first infusion I could actually eat_ first time in 3 weeks without any problems. I was thrilled and thought I had my life back.  Went two years without a flare_ until May 2007. Had Remicade in May 2007 and have had every 12 weeks since.  I have again been flare free since May 2007_ however_ during the past year I have severe muscle/joint pain_ this pain roams from one body part to another every 24 hours. The pains start about 8 weeks after the infusion.  As soon as i get the next Remicade infusion they go away again_ each time they come back they are more servere. Really starting to doubt the benefits of Remicade_ the pain is very intense and sometimes i cannot even walk or lift anything with my arms.  My hair seems to be changing too_ very dry and falling out and a higher than normal rate.  Just had Remicade 3 weeks ago_ and,Remicade gave me my life back from Crohn's_ but now seriously worried about the side effects I am experiencing. It seems the more i get infusions_ the shorter it lasts and the worse the pain gets. i am wondering how i get off Remicade and will the pain go away?

My regular doctor thought maybe I had Fibro Myalia_ because of the problems I was having. So he sent me to a rheumatoid doctor. After blood test that doctor told me I had RA and put me on steriods and methotrexate. When that combo didnt help_ he put me on Embrel shots. One a week as prescribed. . they didnt seem to be helping but the doctor says it would take time. My insurance only covers 6 grand a year with the shots and insurance i was footing the full bill in 5 months and still not feeling better. So doctor got me on Remicade infusions as an out patient. So was covered by medical insurance. Frst infusion was groggy and tightness in chest. Blood pressure dropped so severely that the nurses were concerned that something was wrong. Started out one infusion every 8 weeks. . not helpign so then was every 6 weeks. . still no help. Blood work doctor said looked promising. I was then going once every month. Still groggy and sleeping through it. Sleepy for days after. Still in pain and getting depressed. Doctor had my infusion dose raised as high as he dare go with it. I was not feeling better_ but he was telling me to give it time. Was almost 2 and half years of infusions. He then informed me he was moving and sent me to a new rheumatoid doctor.

Those have gone away after about 15 months but have been replaces with chronic external ear infections. My ear canal will swell and drain. Very painful.,I know the remicade is helping because I tried going off it and could not function. Different and numerous swollen_ red and painful joints each day.

Could be a combo of the benadryl and the emotional drainage that's been going on for the last year or so.  Just got out of the hospital 2 days before starting treatment.  Insomnia that night (ugh),So far I'm really excited about the possibilities.  Feeling good the day after first treatment_ so I'm naturally looking forward to how the second one goes in 2 weeks.

Now that I can't take Remicade_ my doctor is not hopeful that I can take other drugs and is suggesting that surgery is my best option.,F,43,1  years,3/22/2009Email,Remicade

I'm on my sixth treatment and haven't noticed anything else!,This drug has been a life-saver for me!  I can tell when I'm getting close to my next treatment_ as my Crohn's acts up a bit.  Then the day after the Remicade infusion_ I'm back to normal!  The tiredness the day-of treatment and the insurance hassles are worth it!,F,24,1  years,3/17/2009Email,Remicade

332, 5, Crohn's,"Only had two infusions so far_ tired AFTER infusion & for next day or two_ I get very anxious w/Restless Leg Syndrome during infusion & have had to take an Ativan. (I think it's being ""strapped"" into a chair for so long that does it for me_ or it's the anti-histimine they give me). I just started noticing my scalp getting dry & itchy and I feel like my hands look a bit ""blotchy"" Certainly all better than the psychosis I experienced w/prednisone and the pain & trips to the bathroom from the Crohns.",I tried to put off going on this drug because my disease seemed to be getting progressively worse & I'm afraid of it not working forever & I'm only 30.

333, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,I fall asleep during most infusions. I am always given tylenol and benadryl right before the infusion_ so it could be the benadryl_ but I take it sometimes for allergies and I get a little sleepy but don't actually fall asleep. So I think there's a combination effect. After my last infusion (my 9th one)_ I slept during it as normal_ but then when I got home I was still exhausted and slept from 6 pm to 8 am the next morning.,Beginning with the first infusion_ my severe UC began to improve. Once I was on the 8 week schedule (the 4th infusion)_ I experienced failure at 5 weeks_ so my doctor changed me to a 6 week schedule and I've been kept on that frequency. Each infusion brought me progressive improvement and by the 7th one 3 months ago_ I began to feel that my UC symptoms were finally completely gone. Maybe a tiny bit of gas or bloating_ but only if I eat certain foods - a huge change from where I was ten months ago. At that time_ I had been living with a flare up that had lasted almost a year_ had landed me in the hospital for 18 days_ caused me to lose 40 pounds and suffer extreme malnourishment_ and even though I was mostly feeling better_ still was causing me to go to the bathroom 6-12 times per day and in the middle of the night_ extensive bleeding_ diarrhea_ and extremely painful cramps with many bowel movements. I just knock wood that Remicade continues to work for me.,M,45,11  months,2/22/2009Email,Remicade

(5'10"" and 125 lbs. due to crohn's). i am a kind of worried about the long term effects of the drug though. but for now i'm fairly satisfied and hoping that i will go into full remission soon.",F,22,5  days,2/12/2009,Remicade

Fatigue lasting for 2 days where I couldn't get off the couch.  Increased pigmentation on skin_ looks like freckles but could be petechie??  Had a punch biopsy waiting for results.  Biopsy in 2005 showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis.,My dosage has been increased and the interval decreased to every 5 weeks. I have been feeling more energy_ mouth and vaginal ulcers are improving. I have less joint pain.

He use to take Benadryl before his infusion but it made him very groggy for hours and now takes a Zyrtec and a TYlenol. With Zyrtec he is awake and uses his lap top to kill time. Remicade is the only drug that helped him and he contunues to do well as long as he gets an infusion every 8 weeks. I am concerned about the long term effects and no doctors have answers.,If anyone has any info on long term side effects of Remicade use_ please email me.

Prior to remicade I was walking with a cane_ my hands were frozen_ the fatigue was debilitating and I was getting very depressed.  It started working after the second infusion and has worked ever since.  I take it every 8 wks. I am extremely grateful for this drug.  No one even knows that I have RA.  I have my life back.  Thank you!!,F,49,4  years,1/15/2009,Remicade
339, 5, crohns,no side effects,My doctor is a researcher and a gi doctor.  Really in favor of just using remicade.  Do not have to change choices for eating.  Went into comploete remission after the first infusion.Doctor says there is many new drugs coming out that will change completely how crohns is treated.  Best thing to take is folic acid and omega 3 in coated capsules. Do not take remicade with methatrixate.  This may cause cancer when the two are combined.  Doctor says continue to take pentasea pills because they will decrease risk of cancer.,F,12,1  days,1/1/2009,Remicade

341, 2, Ulcerative Colitis,I would recommend to NEVER take this medicine as a home infusion.  After taking this medicine for 6 months with no negative reactions my son had an infusion Dec/08 and had a immediate severe reaction.  Thankfully we were at a clinic located on hospital grounds with his doctor available.  His reactions were lost vision_ blood pressure drop to 50/30 and loss of bowel function and ready to pass out.  It was incredibly scary.  They immediately stopped the medicine and pumped saline into him.  He started to come out of it as fast as it happened.  We will NEVER use remicade again.,It did seem to help somewhat for a short time but he was not able to make it to the eight weeks on this last infusion (only make it to 7).  Everyone's body reacts differently to different drugs.  I know remicade works for some_ but not my son_ due to the severe reaction at infusion.  Just be aware of the possibilities that could happen during infusion.,M,16,6  months,12/27/2008,Remicade

I take Claritin and Tylenol before infusions.,I find it is really difficult getting information about Chron's and Remicade.  Have asked doctors questions_ but they don't seem to know! ? Anyone know where to go for accurate information?  I was just diagnosed three months ago.  Have had five infusions.  Feel much better.  But_ I have completely changed my diet too.  Worried about whether it's effectiveness will decrease over time.  No other medications at this time.

I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 2007 after suffering from constant pain for 3 years in high school. I was 5'5 and weighed 90 lbs at the time. As I continued to drop_ my hs sweetheart split_ and the kids began to refer to me as ""ana"" short for anorexic. Although it was difficult_ I found ways to cope and improve myself; however I came to realize that I was depressed and was bringing down those around me. When it came time for freshman year of college_ I was accepted into my dream university_ but as my health exacerbated_ I was forced to turn down my admission and continue at a local comm. college. It was there that I got into an accident_ had an MRI done_ and finally was diagnosed with crohn's. I was later prescribed Remicade for treatment.

Currently_ I am struggling with pretty severe constipation_ but that may have more to do with my diet during my UC flare-up than the medication.,Remicade worked great for me at first.  During my induction phase_ I was healthier than I have been in 8 years.  However_ when I got to my first 8-week interval between doses_ I had breakthrough symptoms around 5 1/2 weeks.

I don't always get all these reactions and sometimes none at all. If I recieve the infusion too fast I get them all and they continue for a few days. I don't let that happen anymore. I am pretreated with Claritin and Tylenol. Sometimes I have to continue allergic reaction treatment that night and rarely for a day or two. Tylenol and 300 mg Zantec along with my daily Zertec keep away the side effects. I take the Zantec weather or not I have a stomache ache becuase it's an H2 blocker that works differently than the other allergy medication.,I was worried when I first developed reactions to treatement that they would continue to get worse and I might have to get off Rhemicade.The side effects are manageable for me.Thankfully I have been in remision sense shortly after starting treatement.Twice I have had to delay Remicade do to surgery and had major flair ups until I could recieve my treatement. 3mg/kg every 6 weeks.

Itching has increased over the years. It drives me crazy. I am so glad to read that many others have had this problem too. Many dermatologists and therapists have said there's no reason for the itching and to basically deal with it. Itching occurs on my arms_ face_ hair_ thighs. I've learned to put anbosol teething gel on the itching spots. that helps some.,This drug has saved my life. I have had this disease for 45 years. In and out of hospitals with intestinal agony for years. In 1994 I finally gave in to having surgery - bowel resection. After that I could finally eat.

I've had infusions every 8 weeks since and i've had no outbreaks. But I think this unusual itching and leg twitching might be side effects.

The headache grew in severity so much so that I was sure a knife was sticking out of my head. Three days later a 'butterfly' rash appeared on my face and I started with a dry hacking cough. The rash led my doc to think the possibility of Drug Induced SLE_ still awaiting blood results. The cough has grown to bronchitis_ had it for 2+ weeks now. Bad enough that my doc cancelled the 2nd infusion and put me on steroids. The Remicade has done nothing for my RA yet_ but I know it is too early in the treatment to expect it. I am just not sure I should continue_ the side effects coupled with the joint pain are miserable.

373, 3, Crohn's,slightly lowered blood pressure.  possible one-time allergic reaction which was more than likely caused by an anxiety attack which was concurrent with actual dosing.,I have a fistula that actually clots and closes immediately after an infusion_ however it reopens a few days after and i have to wait 8 weeks before i can get the next infusion.  has anyone heard of continuous remicade infusion (not continuous-continous but like 2 hours a day for a few days to actually allow a somewhat more complete healing process to occur.  i see that they warn against overdose_ but there are no actual documented cases or injury.  i receive this at an infusion center and of course would never alter or ask to alter my dose if there are actual dangers_ but has anyone ever heard of a more aggressive use of remicade when circumstances might call for it.  i can't seem to find any studies addressing this approach.  i have tried the shots (Humira)_ but i have severe (fetal position-crying to violent behavior) fear of needles and suffered the skin side effects of the more lauded Humira to the extreme strangely enough.  i'm in a bind and don't want any more surgery than i've,M,25,3  months,2/26/2008,Remicade

It almost killed me.,I kept telling the doctor that one week i would get sore feet. Next week i would get sore elbows. Then the time i got the swollen lip for no reason i told him that too. They put me on steroids before my last infusion which didn't help because that's when i got the allergic reaction that shut off my throat and voice.,M,44,5  days,2/21/2008,Remicade

I had a high fever_ was unable to get out of bed due to debilitating abdominal cramping_ was running to the bathroom every 10 minutes (when I could muster up enough strength to actually get up)_ and had a rash covering my entire body.  I had to go on 40 mg of Prednisone to counteract the reactions.,I've heard it works wonders for other people_ so I suppose it's worth a try.Check out my blog on UC at: www.UCgirl.blogspot.com,F,20,2  weeks,2/19/2008,Remicade

Everything in my life based around my 6 week infusion_ wk 1_ do nothing_ wks 2_3_4 I feel GREAT_ by end of wk 5_ I start to flare up. It does not last 6 weeks.

Popping a couple Vicodin seemed to dull the pain. My GI doctor prescribed 800MG of IBProven along with a regular dose of benadryl to help with the inflammation and it really did. The Joint pain did not go away until about Sunday. This was only my first infusion. Hopefully the next one will not have such side effects.,M,25,5  days,1/21/2008,Remicade

Most of my psoriasis is gone. It definitely improved my life - for the first time in years_ men noticed me and I could date without fear or embarrassment.

A year ago I was hospitlized from severe bleeding with almost needing a tranfusion and in severe pain from crohns. They started remicade that night in the hospital and It worked very quickly!

382, 4, Chron's Disease,Some minor muscle pain_ for the 1st week I have flu symptoms_no dry skin or infections and oddly enough my Cholesteral went through the roof (no other reason_ no red meat_ run daily_ no family history) after about a year of being on the drug but its under control with Zocor,I was initally diagnosed at 12yrs old (my Dad has Chron's too). I have been sent the emergency room 4 times for dehydration but no resections. I have been on prednisone but it makes me crazy-nuts_ so I purposely try not to be on it. I was on 6MP for a yr which helped but not that much. I have been on Remecade for almost 5 years now along with Azathoprine and 4gm (16 pills) of Pentasa. And except for the last week_ week and half it works fine. I have noticed that sometimes it doesn't take. I remember one time for the whole 8 weeks I was sick. My biggest concern is basically I am going to have to be on this drug for the rest of my life because I'm too scared to get off it and long term no one knows what its doing to my liver.,M,41,5  years,12/4/2007Email,Remicade

386, 4, Crohn's Disease,No side effects whatsoever!  It always makes me feel better during the infusion!  Unfortunately_ the benefits do not last as long as the period of time between infusions ...,My very first infusion resulted in a tremendous increase in stamina.  Second_ which was two weeks after the first_ did not hold out the full six weeks until my third.  Although all six infusions have resulted in very positive outcomes initially_ none have lasted a full six weeks.  I'm now scheduled for every five weeks.  Hopefully my last will last until then.,F,55,6  months,11/25/2007Email,Remicade
387, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,No side effects with actual infusion. Have developed general itching in the past few weeks_ but wonder if its the Prilosec I take for acid reflux. Am discontinuing the Prilosec today to test it. It may be the Remicade_ but should itching start 6 weeks AFTER an infusion? Seems it would start sooner not later. Other symptoms I have since starting Remicade AND Prilosec (both started at nearly the same time) is insomnia_ depression and constipation (all symptoms that MAY be related to Prilosec).I may have to get onto a 6 or 7 week infusion schedule as my UC symptoms have returned (with a vengence!) just a week before my next infusion. This will be my first 8 week interim since starting the drug.,Its been a god-send to me. Was hospitalized for over a week with severe blood loss and dehydration. Colon surgeons visited every day. My last hope was Remicade before undergoing the knife. After my 1st infusion in the hospital my symptoms disappeared. I mean_ IMMEDIATELY. I had visited the bathroom 5x earlier that day_ and after the infusion not at all and not for another 2 days (except to pass urine). I felt renewed.I was on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet after starting Remicade_ and developed severe acid reflux just a couple short weeks later. Was perscribed 40mg. Prilosec for the acid reflux. Many of my symtpoms may be due to the Prilosec. I will report back in a week to post results of my test with discontinuing Prilosec and possible eleviation of symptoms.,F,51,3  months,11/23/2007Email,Remicade

The next day there was a significant improvement in my condition_ and I was released from the hospital 3 days later. The only thing that sucks is how expensive it is. It was a fight to get funding for it. =(,F,25,24  days,11/21/2007Email,Remicade

390, 5, Chron's,Migraines which I have had to get a prescription for that I take every night and it helps tremendously but I still get at least one migraine a month usually a couple days after the infusion but is better than 4 a month_ dry patchy spots on my face especially eye lids and of course very sleepy day of infusion.,The difference is unbelievable_ I Love It!!  I had a very hard time agreeing to take the Remicade but it was well worth it because I now have my life back!!  I was severly sick_ 92 lbs._ could eat very litte_ used the restroom no joke about 20 times a day and had to go on medical leave for 11 months this past flare up....that's when my Doc. put me on Remicade and I am normal again.  I usually feel icky a week to a couple days before my infusion which used to take 4 hours but there is a new nurse and she only takes 2 hours which I  feel a difference in the effects_ unless I'm just thinking that's why this last time I feel terrible 2 weeks before my infusion?  Any how it's wonderful and I'd much rather deal with a few icky days than every day.,F,25,10  months,11/19/2007Email,Remicade
391, 4, UC,My blood pressure drops during the infusion_ but bounces right back up when it is over. I have developed mild rashes on my face and stomach during the treatment_ but they too disappear as soon as the treatment is over. Two weeks after infusion_ I often develop a UTI_ which my GI says is due to a weakened immune system_ but I can deal with it. Overall achiness sometimes hits about the same time_ with or without fever.,Though the side effects are sometimes unpleasant_ I will take them over the pain of dealing with a UC flare. About a week before I am scheduled for a dose_ I start to feel a flare coming on_ so I am always grateful when infusion day rolls around. I have heard that allergic reactions can increase/become more severe with several doses_ so that does worry me as I have had mild reactions in the past and I am always worried that it will be worse the next time around. I do take Benadryl and Tylenol before the infusion starts in order to minimize the risk.,F,33,6  months,11/1/2007,Remicade

393, 5, crohns/ankylosing spondylitis,No side affects from infusion. I have had a couple of outbreaks of hives in between infusions... they've occured about 5 weeks out from an infusion. There is no pattern of food or other unusual exposure to pin them on. They subside_ (some not completely) and appear a couple months later in the same spots. Can't say they're related to the remicade_ but other than one time 6 or more years ago_ the hives are a new thing for me. Also I think it takes longer to recover from little bouts with whatever bug is going around.,I love REMICADE. After the second 2-week treatment I was vitually pain free. So amazing. Unfortunately the level of relief has not been regained even with the 6-week infusion schedule I have currently. Even so_ there is improvement_ which I measure by the fact I need to change position only three or four times (instead of a dozen or more) while sitting through an hour lecture/movie/etc. My last treatment provided no pain relief whatsoever_ so I don't know what's next.,F,54,10  months,10/8/2007Email,Remicade

I now have an infusion every three months and hoping to extend that even longer.,F,34,1  years,9/30/2007,Remicade
395, 3, Crohn's Disease,I have no immediate side effects. A few days later I get sores in my nostrils that will not heal and crust over for about two weeks. I also have a hard time knocking out the Strep...it never really goes away. I have had several UTI's and I get dry skin_ especially on my cheeks and eye lids/brows. My neck is itchy all the time.,I have had a bunch of infusions now and two weeks before the last one_ my pre-Remicade symptoms returned. Even with the new infusion_ I'm having trouble bouncing back. My doctor might move me to a 7 week regimin. My only problem during the infusion is that the Benedryl makes me anxious which can last for several days. I'll get really jittery and need to walk around. I don't take the Benedryl prior anymore and do fine.,F,20,6  months,9/30/2007Email,Remicade
396, 5, Rheumatoid arthritis,usually just tired after an infusion.  Worked great for me for about 2 years.  Over the last four months haven't been responding to the methotrexate/remicade combination and am taking the highest dosage for each drug.  Suddenly started having flare-ups and didn't go away.  Just had an infusion last week and can barely walk and have had swelling_ starting from my right foot_ all the way up my body to the left side of my body.

397, 5, UC,My biggest issue has been with chronic infections.  Late June_ I had an unidentified infection that led to a 5 day hospital stay.  They suspected meningitis (SP) but nothing was conclusive.  Since then_ I have had two bouts of strep throat requiring antibiotics.  In less than 2 months I have had a total of 3 courses of antibiotics and am beginning to be concerned about resistance.  This morning_ I am on my way back to the doctor_ as it appears that I have strep once again.,Initially_ my response was slow.  But at this point_ I can SURELY see the impact.  For the first 3-4 weeks following an infusion_ I am like a normal person again.  I can so identify with those of you who have shared the same sentiment.  I am currently on a 6-7 week cycle_ which may not be the best thing_ but at week 5 I am breaking though terribly and can't seem to stretch it out.  My doctor is lovely and indulges me_ I just hope it is not to my detriment.  All in all_ I have loved this medication. Even though it weakens my immune system_ I feel good about the change it has brought in my life.  I am also grateful to have health insurance because at 4-6K a pop_ that could be painful too.

398, 5, Crohns,Yes - I itch from the drug.  Not always though.  Sometimes after an infusion I will itch especially after taking a shower_ or after a workout.  Only itching.  My hair is getting thinner - I am not sure if it is the drug - this pattern is in the family males.  The itching is accompanied with red splotches.,I am 44 -  I was diagnosed with crohns on my 13th birthday.  I have had two bowel resects_ and other surgeries.  I have had good life spans and years that I thought life would not turn out too long.  Plenty of pain_ and complications.  After starting Remicade I have had few if any symptoms.  Itching is not a bother.  I got an OTC drug to counter act itching and that will take care of that.  Some may require a prescription for itching and the side effects.  Like others have mentioned I am unsure about the LT effects.  I am doing very well now - very well.,M,44,2  years,8/17/2007,Remicade

403, 4, Crohn's Disease,Joint pain_ redness of the face with swelling_ back pain so sever that tyhe infusion had to be stopped (these when I have a reaction).  Otherwise_ a little joint pain for 2 days,Beats the heck out of a flare up though.  I have had Crohn's for 10 years adn 2 small bowel resections.  The 1st time I did the 3 remicades_ it did nothing.  This cycle (about a year or so) is the best it has worked and it is working.  My infusion nurse now starts me at 25ml/hr and slowly gets me up to 125.  The slow start seems to keep symptoms down DURING infusion_ but I still had some for 2 days after.  I would like to try Humira but wonder why I'd switch to reduce some symptoms and risk a flare-up.  What do you think?,M,46,1.5  years,7/26/2007,Remicade
404, 4, Crohn's,I have not had many side effects - brief bout with hive/rash on neck the day after the first two infusions; some tiredness,I have been on remicade since Dec 06 and it has been wonderful - no more pain when eating.  I was wondering if anyone else felt like they retained fluid/became very bloated and had breakouts on the body (not on the face-almost like bites)around the time of the next infusion?

406, 4, Crohn's Disease,During my first infusion_ I had chills and nausea.  Afterward_ nausea_ fatigue and flu-like symptoms (having to go D a lot) for about 2 days.  About 72 hours after the infusion_ the side affects went away.,Been a Crohn's sufferer for about 10 years_ and been on every medication you can think of: Prednisone_ Asacol_ Reglan_ Immuran_ 6mp_ Methotrexate_ and everything in between.  Remicade is pretty much the end of the line before Humira.  I've only had 2 infusions so far. It's best to have the infusion over a longer period of time if you experience any side affects DURING the actual infusion.  Also_ I find it helps to bring someone with me during the infusion to keep me company and drive me home afterwards because I am always so tired after the infusion.  It is hard to sleep during the infusion because the nurse is always taking your blood pressure!  I am hopeful I will see positive effects from this medication soon_ as others have_ as it does take a few infusions to feel the full effects of the medicine.,F,27,3  weeks,6/29/2007,Remicade

409, 4, Ulcerative Colitis,Diagnosed Dec 2001. Taking Remicade for a little over a year. Some reactions have been getting warm/sweating_ sharp pain in lower abdomen_ nausea_ vomiting_ throat closing and not being able to breath. These severe reactions were controlled by having a steroid injection through the IV 30 minutes before the Remicade infusion. Lower back pain_ joint pain in knees_ usually disappears by the next day. Recently I have gotten Itchy skin_ itchy bumps on face. Sensitivity to sun and tanning beds. I wouldn't get any color but the itching was horrible. Please let me know if you have found anyway to stop the bleeding/bloat entirely. I feel I am so close to remission. Not sure if Remicade is still working 100%.,I was not able to reach remission. Every time I went of Prednisone I flared. Asacol didn't seem to work anymore. Was hospitalized a few times and 2nd time I had no choice but to take Remicade or lose my colon. When I first started infusions I had horrible reactions. The first 3 or 4 went fine but then out of no where I started having severe reactions that almost forced me to stop treatments_ but we figured out what caused it. Examples include....getting warm/sweating_ sharp pain in lower abdomen_ nausea_ vomiting_ throat closing and not being able to breath. They would stop the infusion and the side effects would be gone within 30 minutes. They gave it to me slower and I was able to make it through. Later we realized that I had been on steroids before and that is why I had not bad reactions. These severe reactions were controlled by having a steroid injection through the IV 30 minutes before the Remicade infusion. I have had no other problems with the infusion process since then.

412, 4, Crohn's,Twitching_ bad headaches usually a day or two after infusion_ mild joint and muscle pains which usually go away in a day or two_ strange piercing shooting pains anywhere from lower back to neck and arm_ and most recently hives which may or may not be attributed to the Remicade,7 years diagnosed with Crohn's. Remicade has dramatically improved the quality of my life and helped to maintain (not fully close) a perianal fistula. Also taking Pentasa and occasional rounds of Prednisone. Most recently 4-5 days after my 7th infusion I began getting chronic severly itchy hives on my face. They have persisted for 8 weeks now. Still determining whether this is from the Remicade (having Serum/HACA_ ANA_ and anti-dnsDNA blood tests to detect anti-body to the drug or possible DIL syndrome before having next treatment).

I go every 9 weeks now_ we tried longer times between infusions_ but I began having symptoms and eye problems (usually my first symptom of a problem).  Reading through some of the rest of your problems is mind opening.  Since my last infusion_ 3/16/07_ I have been having muscle_ joint and bone aches & pains.  I also have 2 ear infections and a bronchular infection.  This is the first time I have had an infection since I began Remicade in 2/04.

I think my inflammation was bad enough that it has taken a couple of infusions to get back to feeling almost normal.  No blood_ no cramping_ solid bowels 2-3x a day-- as opposed to full flare a month ago in the hospital.  It's also allowing me to taper off my oral prednisone now.,F,27,24  days,3/17/2007,Remicade
418, 5, Crohn's,One 5 yrs ago itchy burning feet.,I am 32 and have been on Remicade for 7 yrs. Before normal meds with no luck. I say taking my Remicade is like winning the lottery! I could not live without it. The only downfall is it is expensive but worth it.,F,32,7  years,3/16/2007Email,Remicade

I have no alternative but to try this drug.  The cost is too high but I have no alternatives treatments left to try.,F,59,3  days,3/14/2007Email,Remicade
420, 3, UC,"dry_ flaking skin around eyes (esp. eyelids)_ and on scalp.  Some ""honeycrusting"" in nostrils.",taking remicade and 6-mp_ I was able to stay in remission for a year.  When the flare-up came back_ it seemed more manageable--less urgency_ less blood--although I still needed prednisone to get it under control.,M,42,12  months,3/4/2007,Remicade
421, 5, ulcerative colitis,Headaches after 1st use_ nothing else really.,It works for me!  I was on and off prednisone for the past three years_ I could not stay in remission.  Doctor was recommending surgery but decided to give this a try first.  Two days after 1st treatment I stopped bleeding and was actually constipated for a day or so_ then went back to normal.

422, 3, Rheumatoid Arthritis,"My first infusion the only side effect was some mild post nasal drip. My second infusion I had a severe allergic reaction. Nausea_ dizziness_ blood pressure went thru the roof_ I got the shakes bad - my Doc called them ""rigors"" - and almost passed out a couple of times. Making it worse_ I can't take steroids so all they had to calm my symptoms was IV Benedryl and that stuff knocked me out cold!",I do think Remicade might have worked for me if I were able to take a loading dose of steroids before each infusion.,F,38,2  times,2/23/2007,Remicade
423, 5, Ulcerative Colitis,No side effects,I wrote here last in November_ I've been on the drug for 7 months.  I feel normal again w/infusions every 8 weeks.

I hope it lasts.,F,18,7  months,2/22/2007Email,Remicade
424, 5, Psoriatic Arthritis,Maybe a little tiredness.  Sometimes headaches during infusion.  This rhuematologist always has the patients take Zyrtec + I take Tylenol before infusion.  I had to go up on my medication late last year when the effects came back in 6 weeks.  I take the drug about every 8 weeks - 5 vials right now.  I weigh about 200 pounds.,This really cleared up my swollen fingers and feet with the first and second treatment.  The small areas of psoriasis that I had cleared up.  Recently my the psoriasis came back stronger in my scalp but the arthritis doesn't seem to have returned.  I don't really seem to catch many more colds or flu than before.

427, 5, UC,After the first infusion_ I had the night sweats and felt very tired the following day.  After the second infusion_ this did not occur.  I will be getting my third infusion in a few weeks.,I am 34 yrs old and was diagnosed at age 13.  I have pancolitis that is difficult to treat.  When I flare_ I only respond to prednisone but have difficulty tapering.  Was on imuran for 2.5 yrs but it unfortunately stopped working and I went on Remicade.

429, 5, Ulcerative colitis,none that i know of,I wrote in Oct-it turned out when they did my colonoscopy that my UC was in total remission-no inflammation or bleeding.  I need to be more careful on my diet to add more fiber so I don't get D from fruits and veggies.  But it was difficult in the 7th week to make it to 8 weeks between treatments.  My Doc tells me that 8 weeks is best and that I can't stop treatment or my body will develop antibodies to the Remicade and I won't be able to use it again.  I wonder if I'll have to take it forever.  But its only been since August and I can function and go to school without having D accidents.  If anyone here has developed antibodies against remicade_ please email me.  Without this drug I was homebound_ afraid to leave the house because I needed to be near a bathroom_ just in case.

432, 4, Crohn's disease,About 8 days after my first infusion_ I awoke with mild arthritis type pain in my left ankle and hip. The arthritis symptoms moved up my left leg_ fully engulging my left him_ my left shoulder_ and left part of my neck. The joint pain then migrated to and included my right side joints. By noon that day_ I was on the couch taking hydrocodone for relief. Due to the joint pain_ I could barely get off the couch and put a shirt over my head. I called my doctor_ he called in a prescription for Prednisone and Tramadol. That worked like a charm. The arthritis began to disappear after the first two pills; then almost totally gone 20 hours later. Hopefully_ the arthritis won't return.,I took it three times in 2000 to try and close a rectal fistula. It worked like a charm. Six years out_ the fistula is still closed_ though I've developed colon and rectal inflammation. That's why I'm taking Remicade again.,M,43,2  weeks,11/11/2006,Remicade

I lost control of my bowels_ incredible pain/pressure and bloody D.  I felt much better within two days of the first infusion.  But now two weeks after the  3rd infusion I am having symptoms again.  I have a colonoscopy tomorrow-(3rd in a year and 2 sigmos) I hope we can get it back under control.  Has anyone else had this reoccurrence during treatment?,F,17,2  months,10/11/2006Email,Remicade
434, 5, Crohn's,Only once during my second treatment_ but I heard that it was a normal thing.,I love this drug.  Its like a miracle.  I am no longer taking other meds (this of course is against my doctors orders).  My GI wants me to continue on Immuran_ but the Remicade helps me just fine.  Though I think I need to ask him to give it to me more often.  I go into the hospital every 8 weeks but I notice I start experiencing the pain and frequent bathroom visits at about the 6 or 7 week mark.  I've been on it for about 3 or 4 years and I swear by it.  Though the drug is expensive_ I will continue to use it.  Since getting my infusions I've been hospitalized only once.  Before Remicade_ I was in there 2 times per year.

435, 5, Chron's,None but the benadryl and infusion made me drowsy.,"Was a holy grail_ until my doctor (the head of my hospitals G.I. dept) pulled me off it. Said he doesn't want me to build a tolerance and not have it available for a flare up later. I'd rather live my life now. It was like I didn't have the disease anymore. :(  Also to the link to the ""syndrome"" listed below_ the list of possible linked drugs is GIGANTIC.

437, 3, Ankylosing Spondylitis,The downside to Remicade for me is chronic sinusitus and constant infections.  I am only able to tolerate 1 vile and must be infused slowly or I get severe migraine headaches.  For days after the infusion I am very tired and ache in my joints. It also wears off before the next infusion.I wish I could tolerate a larger dose for additional pain relief.,Remicade is the only drug that has eased the intense muscle_ ligament and tendon pain I have but I will switch drugs when another drug that does not surpress TNF gets approved for my disease.,F,59,3  years,9/9/2006,Remicade
438, 4, Crohn's,Other than some minor leg discomfort_ my only other complaint is fatigue - seems to get worse with each treatment_ I can expect to be down for at least a day after an infusion.  Still beats chronic pain and constant diarrhea.,Remicade truly changed my life.  Two years with excruciating abdominal pain before finally getting a crohns diagnosis.  Pentasa worked for a year or so then symptoms returned.  Bad reaction to prednisone - makes me way crazy :P.  Was taking fairly high doses of methadone to deal with the pain when started first infusion; by the third infusion I was nearly pain free for the first time in over four years (methadone withdrawls were a bummer..)  On 6 week infusion schedule_ had only one flare up since starting.,M,37,6  months,8/30/2006Email,Remicade
439, 5, Crohn's Disease,a slight headache and joint aches 1-3 days after a treatment.  Then it goes away.,I love Remicade!  I has changed my life.

Luckily I only need an infusion every eight weeks.  I'm 52 and have had Crohn's since I was in my twenties. Going through steroid treatment and multiple resection surgeries Remicade was my last hope. I weighed 110 and looked anorexic I'm 5'6"". Now for the first time in years I'm a healthy 140. Pinching an inch is the least of my worries.

443, 3, Crohn's,Started in August_ got DVT in right knee in early October.  Another infusion in May - had stroke and multiple hepatic vein thromboses in June.  Not sure if Remicade is responsible for the abnormal clotting but be careful.  Unfortunately_ I am stopping the drug although it was the only thing to bring me into remission and give me my life back.,Got rid of my symptoms immediately when nothing else would even come close.  Minimal side effects except the ones listed that may or may not be associated.  Had infusions every 6 weeks and usually lasted approx. 4 weeks with no Crohn's symptoms.  Was great while it lasted!,M,22,1  years,7/23/2006,Remicade
444, 5, UC,None_ maybe some breathlessness but big deal_ after prednisone for 3 years Remicade is like a dream come true,Ummm_ yeah_ so if you experience severe allergic reaction within the first infusion_ YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO IT! This is not the drugs fault_ your doctor should not have kept you on it_ thats just stupidity_ people can be allergic to some medications. When I brok out in hives from infused iron we stopped and I never used it again_ doesn't mean it's not a good drug. My UC is so severe that remicade only helps to keep it bearable_ but thats amazing for me because I rather have something keep my under control than to go through all the pain and steriods or even surgery. I have been having the treament for 5 years(I was the first in my area to have it in the US for UC) and I am doing fine. Honestly for me and my doctor_ the possible side effects(even lymphoma) are outweighed by my need for this drug. Steriods are more destructive anyways. There are possible side effects that should be considered but there is a risk in taking any medication,F,21,5  years,7/19/2006,Remicade

With all the things I've had shoved down me_ shoved up me or in me_ this is a piece of cake (though not cheap - oy!)  Infusion is easy and restful.

My most recent flareup--the worst of my life--was not responding to any other drugs_ even massive doses of prednisone. I was in agony from the cramping and from a fissure. I felt some relief within a day_ significant relief within a couple of days_ and 70 percent relief within a week. The problem? I've had three doses so far_ and with each dose the relief has only lasted about a week or slightly more_ after which the problems come sliding back_ until now_ 6 weeks after my most recent infusion_ things are almost as bad as ever.

Then they give me oxygen and I'm OK.  This happened  4 times in 5 years.   No problems with my first infusion.  Subsequent infusions left me with chills_ fever_ aches_ insomnia -  Tylenol PM helps - up to 3 days after the infusion. 1st day after infusion is the worst. I take prednizone & allegra  3 days prior & 6 days after Remicade. Remicade day take benadryl_ Tylenol_ & decadron.  Side effect: soreness_ like exercised too much_ in the back of  legs. Unable to stand  in one place  Touching the bones on my face hurts.   However_ this time is different.  I had my Remicade infusion about 2 1/2 weeks ago.  I experienced side effects as usual then I was fine.
