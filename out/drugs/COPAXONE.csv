0, 2, RRMS,I was diagnosed August of 2015 and started copaxone Sept/October 2015. I ended up stopping around Feb/March of 2016. I would get dime or quarter size welts at the injection site_ shortness of breath_ a flush feeling and anxiety from the shot to the point of crying. I would get these horrendous chills that would like 45 min. Nothing could warm me. So I eventually just stopped taking it overall,I would like to try something different. My neuro doesn't like the pills as he calls them ineffective and can cause liver problems. I was looking into the monthly IV medication. But the side effect of that is brain disease_ which I don't think is worth it.,F,25,6  months40 3X W,8/8/2016,Copaxone

3, 5, RRMS,"It always blows my mind to read about severe side effects being attributed to Copaxone. I have never experienced a single adverse reaction in the 18 years I've been taking it (that's over 6_500 injections!). I consider the mild discomfort at the injection site a small price to pay for the benefit of experiencing fewer relapses -- and ultimately protecting my brain for the future. I am 100% certain that I would be in a wheelchair by now if Copaxone hadn't come along when it did. I do envy the patients who are newly diagnosed and can get started on the 40mg right away -- as they will likely experience very little lipoatrophy -- the only adverse reaction I've had to ""endure."" But I'm not in a wheelchair_ I'm still working full time_ I cycle at least 1_500 miles per year (in rainy Seattle!)_ and I honestly believe that none of that would be true if I hadn't started on Copaxone immediately after my diagnosis.","Of all the medications out there now (there was only Avonex & Betaseron when I was diagnosed -- we've sure come a long way since then!!)_ I believe Copaxone to be the most convenient (3x/week injections with an AutoJect) and most effective with the least amount of side effects. If I were newly diagnosed_ I would start with Copaxone. If it doesn't seem to work_ or if the injection site reactions are too severe_ there are more than a dozen other FDA approved meds to try. But I feel like I ""won the lottery"" when Copaxone was released right after my diagnosis.",F,50,18  years40mg 1X D,10/23/2015EmailHistory,Copaxone
4, 2, MS Dx 11-2014,When I first begin I just had basic normal injection site burning_ pain_ itching_ redress and swelling. I use a cold compress for about 30 minutes to an hour following the injection and was fine. I always did my injections at night before bed and in the morning after I always wake up with severe flu like symptoms fever the whole nine yards but Dr said this is better than the alternative. So I continue to take Copaxone now October 2015 6 months after starting Copaxone I relapsed causing the usual cycle of IV Steroids as well as follow up with pill form.  So I continue taking it and for the second time now shortly after my relapse but the first time this happened  before my relapse.  About 30 minutes after taking the injection I start feeling really flush heart racing and then extremely extremely cold to the point that I shake my entire bed chattering and usually I'm very hot but this happens and I get extremely cold like I lose every ounce of heat in my body_ my body goes into full body spasms I yawn excessively my eyes water I can't see anything it's like my whole body is in pain and my muscles are reacting in some sort of strange seizure type of occurrence. This can last for an hour to several hours causing me to hardly sleep through the night and then when I wake up the next morning as usual I feel the normal flu like symptoms. Now I was willing to deal with the painstaking side effects but when I relapsed I'm thinking now what is this really doing to help me its supposed t,Going to see what else is available,F,33,6  months40 mg 3x w,9/25/2015Email,Copaxone

I did NOT. I was scared of Tysabri. After finding that it caused me severe respiratory distress and bladder infections_ I went back on Copaxone last week. For the first time in 7 years I had a site reaction: a huge red welt of hives_ hot as a furnace. I put cold on it and it left after 25 minutes. This drug has been very good for me_ and oddly_ when I started it I ceased having migraine headaches. I do occasionally have weak legs after injecting_ and reactions can happen no matter how many years you've been on the drug. As I already had depression_ Avonex or Betaseron weren't options. The only real concern I have is of lipoatrophy_ as I'm running out of places to inject. I've hit a blood vessel occasionally_ never pleasant_ but nothing permanent.

24, 3, multiple sclerosis,When I first started I had no issues but as I kept injecting ....,"About a year ago I started having the ""post injection site side effect"" [what feels like a heart attack / panic attack] Which I was told mostly effects people just starting Copaxone. What I found online is when you inject into a vein this will happen. To date I have had this happen 2 times. So now I have to really check where I inject. If I see any ""blue"" at all I will not inject in that spot or near. It's getting harder to find virgin spots . In Nov 2012 I noticed pitting edema in my shins. I've been through many tests which always seem to come back negative. I am interested to know .... If anyone else has huge lumps on the top of their legs. They seem to be permanent as they never go away.  I also have bad varicose veins on my legs near the injection sites. Is it possible that the medicine is either not being absorbed properly or the damage from injecting for years is some how stopping the flow of blood[fluid] from the knees down and causing pitting edema and stabbing pain and what feels like burning veins. On me my hips and legs are the worst. If I inject that day the pitting edema seems worse in that leg. A few days ago the pitting was gone and the day I injected into leg the pitting was back. I just put this together as being a cause so I am still interested to see if the pitting starts to go away and then when I inject again does it get worse and if it does it every time.

I feel better_ but I am sure that is only because I now know what I have and that Copazone will make it better. (Hopefully),I feel like I have made the right choice taking Copaxone because of the least amount of side effects.  I can deal with the medicine buring at time of injection and if I have a post injection side effect 20 mins. will end alot faster then being sick for days after as some of the other meds. can cause.

51, 3, RRMS,Bee stinging feeling with burning.  Sometimes a lot of burning. Really itchy the next day and very hot to the touch that can last for days after.  The normal welts are always there.  I use a hot pack that Shared Solutions sent to me every night after my injection.  I apply pressure for about 45 mins to an hour with it which helps me.   I try to massage some of the bumps days later_ but it also causes it to be itchy again.  I've tried everything that my nurse from Shared Solutions has suggested for the itching_ but nothing has worked yet.  I just continue to itch.  I could be a lot worse i suppose.,I was diagnosed in Sept._ 2002.  I was stubborn about this type of treatment and perhaps in a bit of denial.   But i had a major attack New Years Eve Day weekend and i realized that i didn't want to go back to that again.   I started the Copaxone 7 months ago as of yesterday.  This is still new to me.   Every night it's different in some way and i still second guess the area's to be done.   My family is bending backwards for and with me.  I can't complain.   My husband does the injections on my buttocks and the back of my arms for me as i find it hard to reach.  My left limb from elbow to hand is still healing from the last attack and i find it very hard to use it.  I'm okay on my own with my thighs and tummy.    I can't say if this medication is doing anything for me as i don't notice a difference other then i'm alot better now then i was at the beginning of the attack.  I find i'm more tired through out the day also.  I see my neurologists in 2 days and i really hope he sends me for an MRI just to see if there is anything more going on.  I had a possible relapse 2 weeks ago that landed me back on IV meds.  But the doctor wasn't really sure if it was a continuation of the previous attack or a new one.   Hopefully some thing will become of this stuff.  I'm proud to say that i haven't missed a dose yet.  I'm getting better at it_ but i don't think you can every get use to doing it!!!!,F,31,7  months20mg 1X D,8/29/2011Email,Copaxone

55, 5, MS,Minimal side effects--I think.  My weight has fluctuated a lot over the last 21 years_ so I don't know if Copaxone has anything to do with that.  Same thing with anxiety & back pain.  I've been treated for anxiety since before I started Copaxone almost 12 years ago (started 10/99) and I'm quite heavy and my lifestyle is very sedentary_ so that's probably why I have back pain.  Sometimes I have injection site reactions (big lump_ pain_ hot feeling) but they don't last very long (just a few minutes).  The injection itself almost never hurts.  Sometimes I try to inject in a place where scar tissue is present and that hurts quite a bit and the needle doesn't want to go in.  So of course I try another spot and don't force it.,I think Copaxone is a great medicine.  The symptoms I used to have frequently (dizziness/light-headedness_ numbness in limbs) have all but disappeared.  And I haven't had a major relapse since I started Copaxone.

Although the injections are not fun_ the medicine really works. Not only have I been relapse free_ but my lesions have gone away.

I am looking ahead to kids and research shows you can continue to take it during pregnancy without harming the baby and continue taking it while you breast feed.

58, 4, RRMS,I get the usual injection site reactions_ a hive sometimes_ and the ghost bruises that stay for awhile. My main concern right now is that I feel I am immunosuppressed. Every three to four weeks I am coming down with a cold that often requires the use of antibiotics (azithromycin) to get rid of. This has been going on for the last 7 months and I don't know how to live a productive life like this. My doctors cannot figure it out_ and their only answer is that it is likely the copaxone which I am quite reluctant to stop. Is anyone else experiencing this?,I have not had a relapse in exactly one year. I think copaxone is an excellent treatment for MS and the injection site reactions are really quite negligible (for me personally) given that I would much rather have a hive than optic neuritis or another such relapse.,F,29,1.5  years20mg 1X D,7/15/2011Email,Copaxone

I tried cortisone cream everything and nothing worked. After my body acclimated to the Copaxone  I had less swelling and pain. Now all I do is take my shot out in the morning and take it as is in the afternoon.  I no longer have to ice the area_ nor take the Claritin etc. Nor do I have pain.

Have a bath before injecting_ keep the injection out of the fridge the night before and stick a small plaster on the site straight after injecting. Move around after injecting to increase circulation and do not wear clothes that will rub the site for 24 hrs. This is possible by having a strict rota for injection sites.

You have to be honest with yourself as to which you'd rather deal with; burning_ itching_ dents and maybe a bad 15 minute episode - or MS progression and possibly more lesions.

134, 3, RRMS,I started taking Copaxone 3 weeks ago. Initially_ a piece of cake - almost too easy. For about 5 minutes after injection_ I felt like I had been stung by a bee. A little bit of redness and a small welt a few times. But a week ago Friday_ I had a near-fainting episode a few hours after the injection. Saturday_ I felt light-headed for about an hour before doing the injection. And this morning I woke up dizzier than I have ever felt. Everything was spinning. Had to lay back down and close my eyes for almost 2 hours. My doc says it's probably not related to the drug. But I'm going to stop taking it for a few weeks to see if these episodes stop.,,F,37,3  weeks,11/30/2009Email,Copaxone

Since day 1 I have had redness_ swelling at injection site and itching. I was able to live with this but then I got thrush (twice) and incresing diziness and loose stool everyday (I was even going to try to live with this). THEN all this culminated in an adverse reaction. This past week I took my injection as normal and my face and tongue swelled up and I could not breath I was sweating bad could not move had really bad lower abdominal pain and had to go to the hospital by ambulance.

I had some injection site redness (minor) even though I did not rotate as was recommended_ but used only the buttock switching side each day.",After 9 years of using Copaxone daily_ my MS continued to advance slowly until I could not use my left leg well_ I had almost no short term memory storage_ mental fog big time_ and oh_ the fatigue! In the spring of 2009_ I lost my job and the employer provided health insurance. With no way of continuing to buy the Copaxone at $2_600 per month_ I needed to take my health into my own hands. I had heard of LDN_ but not looked into it because it seemed too good to be true. But at that point_ what did I have to lose? Nothing. Low Dose Naltrexone has NO side effects and no down side and costs about $30 per month. I started on May 1_ 2009 and by the middle of June_ I was riding horses in the mountains of Colorado at 62 years of age. I had not ridden for some years and the difference between taking Copaxone and switching to LDN was the difference between counting my time_ hoping to not deteriorate_ to getting my life back! By November 2009_ I can almost believe that I don't have MS. I know that I still have it_ but with no symptoms_ it is no longer a guiding force in my life. So_ the side effects of Copaxone are not the problem_ the lack of positive improvement compared to the use of LDN_ is what makes the difference. A person does not have to stop the Copaxone to start the LDN. Anybody who is just a bit curious_ can Google LDN and consider getting their lives back too.,F,62,9  years,11/9/2009Email,Copaxone
140, 4, RRMS,Some stinging & redness_ lumps_ occasional itchiness,I have been on Copaxone for almost 4 months and have found it very manageable. I do get the injection site reactions most people have listed here_ but it depends on what area of my body I am injecting. For example_ my thighs produce the ovoid lumps but do not get itchy. My stomach does not produce obvious lumps but DOES get itchy. My arms get red spots but produce no lumps and only occasional itchiness. All have lessened since first beginning treatment. Overall I have been satisfied with this medication and feel that is has noticeably improved my fatigue. I was diagnosed with MS in 1999 and in the first 2 years had an attack about every 6 months. My neurologist recommended that I start taking Betaseron but I opted not to because of the side effects. My condition stabilized on it's own and I went about 5 years without another flare-up. I started Copaxone based on the results of my last MRI and because the side effects sounded much less severe than the other medications available. I'm happy that I made the decision to start treatment and feel that the minor inconvenience of lumps or itchiness far outweighs the alternative.

178, 5, MS,"stinging at site...usually goes away within an hour. Have had 1 ""site reaction""... scariest thing I've ever experienced...I'm pretty sure I injected it into a vein...am now more careful with how I inject...no more quickly hitting areas outside of known safe spots. The shortness of breath_ locking up of back muscles_ bowel and bladder spasticness...I thought I was dying...actually called 911 before calling the DR. It went away after approx. 30 minutes.",Take a shot daily...never miss it...told the company to stop calling...they keep checking up on me...I explained that I will never miss my copaxone shot. Has helped trmendously. The biggest help for me...for two years of MS symptoms_ having absolutely no libido was the hardest thing with which to deal...and understand. I'm sure the wife thought I was messing around on her. But_ honestly_ had absolutely no libido....after having a kid_ and a cold wind getting me excited...seriously_ nada. A naked woman could have walked up in front of me and done bent over at the waist...I would have blown her off. Since the copaxone_ the libido has clicked back on...it's amazing...I will never miss my shot of copaxone. Frankly_ I'm back to being a pig again...I'm sure there are times when the wife would like to hide the Copaxone!!  The ten doctors I had seen before finding a cure all told me that I was getting old_ too fat_ etc...  However_ I knew something was wrong. :),M,44,5.5  months,12/10/2008,Copaxone

193, 4, MS,Rebif landed me in the hospital in serious condition. My Neuro thinks I may have issues with interferons so we decided on Copaxone. All I can say is the side effects of Copaxone dont even compare to Rebif. My biggest complaint about Copaxone is it feels like someone punched me where I injected the medicine and the pain lasts for about an hour. I was worried about anxiety because I read about that possible side effect due to my diagnosis years ago of having GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) but I take Cymbalta for that and think all is OK. Its just the Injection site reaction that I hate but its just temporary. I am so happy I dont feel like I am going to die like I did on Rebif.,New to the drug but I am hopeful.,M,41,2  weeks,7/9/2008Email,Copaxone

My main problem is burning pain on the entire right side of my body (worse in the face and neck) with numb spots on my legs and upper back.  I also have extreme fatigue.   Copaxone has not helped with any of this at all.   The burning pain has remained constant since 1993.   My sight_ mobility_ memory are fine.   My arms are tingly_ numb_ and very weak.   My lesions are mainly in my neck and spinal cord.   My doctor states this is why I have so much constant pain in my neck.   Has Copaxone helped anyone with their pain?   Pain meds don't work for me at all (have tried most everything including Celebrex_ Oxycontin).   Xanax helps keep me calm with the pain is too much to handle some days.,F,43,3  years,7/9/2008Email,Copaxone

Some optic neuritis and past memory of rt. hand weakness (realised it was the first exacerbation that I recall). Since I began the med. no further episodes and no changes on a recent MRI.

198, 4, RRMS,Stinging that is intermittent during the injection;Lump at injection site within 24 hrs_ lasting 2 wks;3 brief episodes of rapid heart beat_ shortness of breath severe back pain starting about 1 min post injection lasting about 10 minutes with symptoms worse in the first couple of minutes of onset and taping to near nothing within 10-15 minutes. Last episode made me feel less myself that day with general weakness. ,I live a normal life with only about 3 exacerbations. Optic neuritis was the first mention of MS in 1987 when no drug were available for treatment of MS. In 1999 had severe attack that made it very difficulty to walk but over 3-4 week period I returned to my base line function (many lesions noted on MRI at that time). Was started on Copaxone September 1999 and may have had one milder exacerbation since on this medication (but also not sure if this is the result of nerve damages of Sept 1999. My walking abilities has gone from a 2 miles tolerable walk to 0.5 mile walk with some difficulties of a stable left leg (weakness/lack of support) at the end of this walk. I have noted that I need a good 2 hr rest post walk to start another walk. Hope this is helpful to anyone who is considering this form of treatment.  Compliance to treatment is not always 100% due to difficulty finding a soft injections site with daily injections. Overall I feel it has worked well for me.,F,55,9  years,6/5/2008,Copaxone

203, 5, RPMS (Relapsing Progressive),Lumps_ Welts_ periodic itching at injection site. Piece of cake as far as I'm concerned compared to heavy flu-like symptoms for 36 to 48 hours every week for 4 years! It's important to bring the Copaxone to room temperature BEFORE injecting_ I take 5 doses out of the fridge at a time (1 card) when I have two left from the card I take out the next card of 5. Heat to injection site BEFORE injecting_ then ice AFTER if needed. I don't use heat or ice any longer_ because it's not necessary. Stinging might happen the first minute or two following injection_ but not often. Lumps can be massaged away 24 hours after injection. The only time that I had the problem with breathing was the day I definitely dumped the entire injection directly into a vein. Scarier than Halloween and Freddy Kruger combined_ but it does pass_ you just have to remember to keep telling yourself to breath slowly and deeply. Easier said than done_ but if you panic you hyperventilate. Don't put your head between your knees,After 4 years on Avonex_ being sick 2 days out of 7 and still progressing in disability_ having to take 4 Advil at 2_ 4_ 6 & 8 p.m. to inject at 9 p.m. then 4 more Advil at 10 p.m. just to cut the flu-like symptoms down to those 24 to 48 hours (otherwise I had symptoms for 6 days following the injection)I will stop taking Copaxone when they pry it out of my cold dead hands. I'm so enthusiastic about Copaxone because I felt it start working the very first injection_ and have been on a fairly uphill trend since then. It's not necessary to use my cane_ unless I've been exposed to high temperatures for more than 2 hours. I've been able to return to work part-time and today I baked a cake AND cooked dinner as well..

Otherwise_ there have been nothing but good effects from this medication. I do NOT get sick each week for 36 hours_ which is a real plus for me and makes my life so much more pleasant!,I have only been on this medication for 5 months. It definitely has NOT cured my symptoms_ but it has made my life more livable because I do not get the weekly sickness from a shot.

It causes a number of other painful symptoms such as severe headaches_ hoarseness_ rapid heartbeat_ nightsweats and difficulty breathing.

212, 5, CIS (probable MS),My first injection with the nurse was a peice of cake. I chose to do it manually because the autoinject was more intimidating. I used to have a fear of needles but I'm fine now. I like the control of doing it manually. I have had no side effects other than a little redness in abdomen spot on first try in that site. Lasted less than an hour. It's probably because I'm still getting used to poking my skin firmly enough. I'm happy that it's going so well. Much better than I anticipated.,My M.S. nurse taught me to do my injections. She told me to warm them up under my arm beforehand so they are body temp. The Shared Solutions nurse argued that they want it room temp. I am taking my nurse's word for it since I have had no reactions. Also_ my nurse told me not to use ice and the S.S. nurse contradicted this. I think my nurse is right. Ice constricts and then the med needs to find the path of least resistance. Maybe it makes the med pool up in the area longer creating a site reaction. Who knows. I am fine without it though. The S.S. nurse also is pushing the autoinject. I am starting to wonder what their agenda is. I trust my nurse who deals with people with MS face to face over someone who sits at a desk with a script.,F,34,4  days,2/15/2008,Copaxone

224, 5, RRMS,I have had the common things like Bumps and Swelling and Site Pain and Redness_ but it's all fine. My most unusual one is of Hyper Emotional Sensitivity. I would 'Cry' after something like standing on an ant. Incredible. This subsided very quickly after I started taking my Zoloft with my Copaxone at night before sleep. ,I was diagnosed with RRMS after a near complete shutdown of my body. When I did not die of the Stroke or Tumor that I was suffering from_ an MRI and other tests found the MS. Seems that I have had it for over 20 years_ just undiagnosed.I have the normal symptoms like fatigue_ weakness_ shaking and loss of muscle control_ They wax and wane. BUT - My main symptoms have been not so much to do with the physical as the mental side of life. From the bad Depression to the bad Memory_ from the change in Personality to the Mood Swings and Impatience_ the list can go on and on. I can only say that MS can be very insidious. Since I started treatment with the Copaxone_ many if not most_ of my symptoms have diminished to a very noticeable and acceptable stage.I actually look forward to what the future holds_ and I really do put it down to the Copaxone_ Because I have done nothing else different. And hey_ the walking stick makes me look distinguished. ,M,46,10.5  days,11/27/2007Email,Copaxone

I did think_ due to being newly diagnosed_ that it was reaction to getting cold_ as the extreme reaction to the heat.  I took injection the next nite_ being sure I stayed warm_ and had same reaction.  I went to my neurologist the next day and he took me off for one week_ then did injection 1 a week then every 5 days_ every 4 days_ etc. I am now doing injections everyday and it has been 10 days_ I am only having site reaction.  ,My belief is that the 2-15 minute 'bee sting' is NOTHING compared to my attack.

226, 2, RRMS,No immediate side effects besides the occasional redness at the injection site.,"Hi my name is Sheryl.  My husband_ Gerard_ has had MS for probably 12 years or more.  In 1995_ he tested positive for LP_ EP and MRI lesions.  Nothing was done_ he'd never had an attack persay...only symptoms worsening.  (bladder urgency_ erectile dysfuntion_ headaches_ fatigue)  His balance got worse and in 2000 had another MRI with lesions...and he got a DX finally and yet no MS drugs introduced.  Just meds for the each symptom.  By 2003 he was using a cane and was on disability.  Still no ""major"" attacks.  Just worsening.  So he was considered PPMS.  In 2005_ he couldn't walk for 2 weeks but recovered.  In March 2006_ another attack.  So_ the Neuro changed his Dx to RRMS and then said he could now start taking Copaxone.  We started it July 2006.  This following year has been hell.  At least 4 exacerbations and never really recovering completely.  Always losing ground.

228, 5, RRMS,Daily warm_ red_ welt at injection site.  Occasional itching.  Slight stinging sensation for 15 min or so after injection.  Mind over matter works for me.  I do some mentally and physically challenging work every day immediately after the injection.  I immediately forget about the sensations and that's it until the next day.,Site rotation is crucial to injection success.  I've never given an injection in the same spot more than once a year.  All seven of my areas are as clear and healthy as they were 4 1/2 years ago when I started Copaxone.

My doctor instructed me to only do 1/2 doses for awhile_ I'll see what happens with that.,When I contacted the company they said the side effects could not be coming from the drug_ that I must have come down with a bug.  That seemed too coincidental and my doctor said the it probably was the drug.  After missing 2 days of work and a doctor visit because I thought I had the flu_ i was dissappointed to hear that.  I cannot feel llike this every day so I don't know if I'll continue.  Does anyone else think this drug could be a scam?

Just like any other shot_ the fear of it always seems to be worse than the shot itself.  I used the auto-injector_ asked the nurse which of the 7 place of injection choices hurt the worst and told her I wanted to get that one over with first.  She said the arm would probably hurt more just because the skin is so thin.  I did my left arm and as scared as I was_ crying like a two year old_ it didn't really hurt.

I always injected in the morning however_ I began experiencing nausea and weakness so I began injecting at night.  Then_ I started having sudden_ violent episodes minutes after injecting the Copaxone.  First I tasted metal_ then within seconds_ I became flushed and sweaty_ I couldn't breathe_ I was vomiting_ had bowl urgency and severe stomach cramps. (I read 2 other entries with the same symptoms). I thought I was dying.  The neurologist's office didn't believe Copaxone could do this.  The allergist told me to stop the allergy shots for 2 weeks and he would modify the solution.  The neurologist told me not to stop the Copaxone.  But I did.

After I attended a conference the Rep for Copaxone said all it has to do is get in the fat under the skin and if you're bruising your needle is to deep so I went from 6 to 6 1/2 and it's been GREAT. I only experience a bee sting experience it gets worse before it gets better and I definitely don't mess with the sight because my Nurse said don't touch it for 24 hours after the injection. I was scared to death at first but it's been an easy adjustment I worried to much about.I've only been on it for 5 months I was diagnosed with RRMS in April 2007 and I'm 41.

I DEALT WITH TEVA'S SHARED SOLUTIONS AND THEY WANTED TO REPLACE THE SYRINGES LITTLE BY LITTLE AND DID NOT VOLUNTEER THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED OTHER COMPLAINTS.

I use a short needle depth (4) for my thighs as I'm skinny and have legs on on sofa when injecting there_ I don't do my arms too skinny.

276, 4, muliple sclerosis,I have been taking copaxone for 6 months.  The only side effect I have experienced is injection site reaction - swelling_ itching_ and lumpy.   Other than that_ so far so good.  I am hoping when my next MRI is due_ the progression will be minimal,,F,48,6  months,5/11/2006Email,Copaxone
277, 3, MS,The normal stinging upon injection_ occasional lumps. Once I hit muscle_ which was very painful_ but if you do it right that doesn't happen. My main concern is that my heart sometimes starts beating very hard and fast sometimes_ and not just after the injection.,I've seen a cardiologist who says it's okay for awhile_ but it scares me. I've only been on the drug for a brief time. The current exacerbation has mostly disappeared_ and I haven't been on the drug long enough to know if it's helping.,F,28,1  months,4/17/2006,Copaxone
278, 5, Multiple Sclerosis,Multiple Sclerosis A bit of itching/stinging at injection site which only lasted the first month or so. A little bit of color change at the injection site. Teh color change comes back to moral after a year or so. But when injected cold no side effects. I have been on the drug for 4 years now. Thank god_ I am doing well.,So far so good.,F,28,4  years,3/1/2006Email,Copaxone
279, 4, Because Avonex didn't work for me,"I get swelling_redness urticaria and""lumps"" at some sites_ mainly abdominal and arms... but I've only been on Copaxone a month and with Avonex I was sleeping all the time and experiencing flu-like symptoms.  I am hopeful with Copaxone.",,F,43,1  months,2/18/2006,Copaxone
280, 4, MS,Usually only injection site reactions (itchy_ red_ hot_ and swollen at injection site for a few days)_ and occasional flu like symptoms such as mild fever (but I usually sleep through most of it and wake up drenched in sweat...worse some days probably due to menstrual cycle and hormone changes throughout the month).  Occasionally I have the severe rare side effect reactions (maybe once every other month): rapid heart beat_ flushing_ difficulty breathing_ metallic taste in mouth_ nausea_ urgent bowel/bladder feeling.  These symptoms are frightening_ but don't last more than a minute or so.  Have been able to tolerate them so far due to infrequency (if it was every day I would consider quitting the med).  Seem to be related to injection directly into blood vein/vessel (sort of difficult to predict).  Even rarer reaction are the bone racking convulsive chills following the rapid heart etc.  Apparently I'm one of the 4% who experience these.  My chill episodes last just over an hour_ and o,Although I have been experiencing frightening side effects_ they are infrequent enough that I intend to continue on Copaxone at this time.  If I ever reach a point where these side effects become too severe to tolerate_ I will consider switching meds (e.g._ if the cure is worse than the disease).  For now_ I have experienced significant reduction in MS-Symptoms as a result of taking this medication and believe it is helping to control my disease.  Plus_ fear of the unknown is worse than fear of the known.  I've read that the side effects of other MS meds can be much worse_ so I'll stick with the med I am familiar with for now.,F,35,3  years,2/6/2006Email,Copaxone

282, 3, MS,I've had the chest pain reaction twice in the last 5 yrs.  It's unnerving_ but subsides within minutes.  Awful injection site reactions -- welts_ lumps_ bruises_ itchiness and even blistering and abscesses that last for weeks.  Given that injections are daily_ i'm running out of skin to destroy.,"For all the side effects_ Copaxone works quite well.  My MS is pretty much ""in remission"" and my MRIs actually showed a decrease in plaques on my brain and spine.  So the Copaxone working_ assuming i can tolerate the injection site reactions.",F,40,4.5  years,1/12/2006,Copaxone
283, 3, MS,I take my shot at 11 pm feels like a bee sting_ the shots in my arm creates a bruise for a day.,I am hoping it will postpone my gradual decline. I did notice it helped my eye starting to twitch so that was an improvement!,M,69,6  months,12/21/2005Email,Copaxone
284, 3, MS,After using this drug for 15 months I had a servere reaction to it.  Seconds after injection my chest became tight_I couldn't breath_ my body became very hot and felt that my organs were disintergrating_ I had a terrible metalic taste in my mouth_ and felt nauseated. The pain was excruciating and then subsided after about 90 seconds. My chest was tight for several days and I was weak for several days after that.,Prior to this reaction_ I had no severe side effects.,F,41,15  months,11/7/2005,Copaxone
285, 4, Multiple Sclerosis,bumps at injection site,I was on Rebif for 1 year prior to starting Copaxone and I had flu-like symptoms all the time. I stopped taking Rebif when I could no longer function because of the adverse side effects.,F,48,3  years,10/17/2005,Copaxone
286, 3, Multiple Sclerosis,Burning and itching at injection site and for the next day.,I don't know how to evaluate its effectiveness. I have had one major relapse with severe muscle spasms_ but the Copaxone is better for me than the beta. With the beta_ my immune system was lowered too much_ I think_ and I was sick all Winter with flu and colds from my students. That did not happen before the beta_ and did not happen this Winter on the Copaxone.,F,58,10  days,8/8/2005Email,Copaxone
287, 2, MS,Very severe reaction.  Chest constrictions with the feling that I couldn't breathe.  This went along with nausea_ vomiting_ loss of bladder/bowel control_ swollen face and arms.  Felt like a severe allergic reaction.  Didn't inject again after that episode.,,F,42,4  months,6/9/2005,Copaxone
288, 3, Multiple sclerosis,Long-lasting injection-site lumps (long=months); discoloration in those areas; stinging and burning (mitigated somewhat by applying ice packs right after injection); sensitivity to touch and pressure (pain) in old injection sites.,It's hard to know if it's helping.  I feel I am just slowly sliding into deeper MS with less functionality of hands and legs_ but maybe I would be having full-blown exacerbations instead of the softened flares I have now.  I am very grateful that Copaxone doesn't have the problems with antibodies that the betas do_ and that it's easy to inject.,F,50,2  years,3/27/2005,Copaxone
289, 3, Multiple Sclerosis,I had itchy and painful site reactions.  However_ it only lasts a few minutes.  I have had one anxiety attack.  All in all_ I would say there are only minimal side effects.,After one year of taking Copaxone_ the MRI of my brain didn't show any new lesions.  However_ I still had just as many.  I have started developing lesions on my spinal cord now. So_ I am having to change to a new drug.,F,22,1.5  years,3/22/2005,Copaxone
290, 1, Multiple Sclerosis,Disturbing images_ might be described as hallucinations. Severe anxiety_ blushing and nervousness.,The anxiety was so severe I decided that any symptom of MS would be better than this experience. I finally realized how serious anxiety could be_ and I really believe I could have ruined my life if I hadn't stopped the medication.,F,31,380  days,11/26/2004,Copaxone

292, 2, Multiple Sclerosis,Painful_ swollen_ bruised injection sites with subcutaneous lumps of hard tissue at injection site.  I have previously taken Avonex.  As there are only 4 meds available for treatment I must endure the lesser symptoms.  At least I no longer want to,My MS symptoms though I realize are not going to be altered by the use of Copaxone are increasing.  I was taking Avonex for 2 years but the psychological problems created by those injections were unbearable.,F,40,1  years,8/29/2004,Copaxone
