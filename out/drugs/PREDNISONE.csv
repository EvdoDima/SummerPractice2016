3, 3, ulcerative colitis,Moon face_ painful cramps in calves_ pain in knees and fingers_drastic loss of sleep (on a bad day which was 4 or 5 nights of the week I would get 1 to 2 hours of sleep per night. On a good night I would get 3 or sometimes 4 hours twice a week)I was exhausted but my brain was wired and wouldn't shut down_ I felt like the walking dead. I broke out in acne and grew downy hair all over my face_ I was a bit emotional and irritable sometimes_ appetite increase_ weight gain_ hump back_ my eyes seem to get weaker_ and sever memory loss and hard to concentrate. Once off prednisone I would lose my hair exactly one month after not taking it. (Two years in a row this happened) My hair would fall out daily for 4-5 months straight. The first time it seemed to grow back a bit but then come October I went back on prednisone for an additional 4 months. In February I was completely off it and my hair started to fall out again daily. Last month (June my hair loss has slowed down considerably_ but it's now mid-july and is still falling out.I have little hair left compared to two years ago. Both doctors had said it was NOT due to the prednisone but falling out from  stress. I've been stressed my whole life and never had hair loss. It was alway exactly one month after coming off of Prednisone that my hair came out TWO years in a row. I believe it was the prednisone without doubt.,I was wearing adult diapers for a month and was so sick_ the prednisone help clear that nightmare up and stopped all the bleeding. For four months thereafter I stayed healthy before the bleeding would come back.,F,47,4  months60mg,7/13/2016Email,Prednisone
4, 5, Traumatic brachial plexopathy,I agree with some of you.. When there is no alternative this drug is a lifesaver. I spent almost a year with a numb arm constant nerve radiation and the the muscle became spasmodic every time I tried to move my arm. The pain became excruciating. Lying down would caused immediate numbness and swelling to the arm. I already had major back surgery 1 1/2 years prior. I was fusing and then got hit head on by another driver and that is how this all started. I spent 8 months having test after test (5 mris _ ct scan_ emg_ muscle tests) with no diagnosis. At the end I was sleeping in the living room sitting up in a chair dangling my arms because that was the only way I could sleep and my anxiety increased; I was at my wits end I couldnt take it anymore. The neurologist decided I had traumatic brachial plexopathy and decided to start me on 60mg of prednisone a day. I was on that for 6 weeks_ then he took me to 40mg..I immediately broke out in acne_ had severe abdominal pain with diarrhea_ night sweats and had pain in my calves_ with my back spasming too. 2 weeks later he told me too ween myself as quickly as possible because of the side effects. So I lowered the dose by 5mg every 3-4 days and I just got off 5 days ago. I am still having extreme muscle weakness_ still have abdominal cramping and loose stools every time I eat. My back is killing me. As I stated I take pain meds anyway_ but I do feel like a truck hit me.I have worked full time this entire time because I,,F,46,3  months60mg qd,6/9/2016Email,Prednisone

I chose to come off the drug myself or I would still be prescribed it..stepped the dose down by 2.5mg every two weeks_ monitored by doctor. I have now been off it for 5 months_ my bone density is now low and as a result my heel bones have crumbled leaving me with painful bone spurs_ my toes have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis_ I can now only walk 100 yards with a stick until the pain becomes unbearable. I now have shoulder and finger joint pain and fear they are the next to suffer. In past two months I developed steroid induced rosacea which has moved into my eyes. My face is now usually covered in sores and my eyes are red raw most days_ my fear is getting cornea ulcers and losing my sight. I still have Myasthenia Gravis_ the prednisone did nothing for the condition except leave me crippled and embarrassed to leave the house because of my appearance.

Started on 30mg prednisone 1x daily in January 2016_ along with Dapsone to prevent pneumonia and Prilosec to reduce acid build up caused by prednisone.  After six weeks. X-rays show lungs almost clear.  Stepped down to 25mg prednisone daily for next six weeks and so forth.  Blood work though now shows reduced hemoglobin_ anemia_ which could be caused by Dapsone so off that until it's confirmed.Although Prednisone can be a saving grace on most things_ yes I did get the water retention_ moon face_ fat redistribution side effects and now this anemia cuz the prednisone does weaken your immune system.,Looking forward to getting my life back.,F,52,2  months30mg,3/5/2016,Prednisone

Took 3 20s the first day then 2 20s the remaining days. The insomnia was the most worrying because though I do have problems sleeping_ I never stay up all night. But it happened the first night with the leg pain and the other symptoms. After that_ each day it got better. I started taking the pills before lunch then my nights were much better. The increased smelling was weird too and bothering at times.  My diet helped and I slipped yesterday and had a salty main course for dinner and had some leg swelling into bedtime. Just remember to take them as early as possible at the start of your day and eat and drink as cleanly as possible. Not too much salt or sweets.

My diagnosis of AIH was new_ so I'd been feeling horrible for a long time.  The symptoms began after my first taper in which the dose was lowered from 40mg/day to 30mg/day. Called Dr and he said to go to 35mg for a couple of days and then taper from there. I've been tapering 5mg at a time per week because of the taper side effects. So far it's not helped make things better.  In fact_ the lower back pain is so bad that I can't stand up straight or walk but a few steps before having to bend over to hold onto something while waiting for the pain to pass. I couldn't afford to gain weight_ but I can't afford to allow my liver to be damaged by this AI disease. IMHO_ this is not a drug to be used for simple inflammation issues_ because there is a huge price to pay for using this medication. I took the risk knowing 'most' of the side effects_ but many people aren't told about what can happen. If your doctor prescribes this medication for you for something simple_ please do yourself a favor and ask if there's an alternative.  While I am grateful that I am helping my liver so I don't develop cirrhosis... I wouldn't wish this misery on anyone.,F,54,3  weeks40mg taper 1X D,1/6/2016Email,Prednisone

26, 1, Nasal polyps,Adrenal failure osteopenia,Hi guys... I was placed on a dose of 25 mg prednisone for 2 weeks including taper.  The reason I was placed on it was because of nasal polyps I ended up feeling great and breathing 100% I made the misfortunate decision to remain on the drug for 9 months as I could not breathe properly for 7 years... Well I didn't know exactly that the drug I was taking was rapidly destroying my body and mind... When I finally came clean with the dr and told him what I did_ I was told I would be fine in 4-6 weeks. I didn't taper properly and now a just over a year later I'm still doing it tough!!! I had adrenal failure no testosterone left in my body and I'm constantly in pain I have been to 4 Drs since and they all say the same thing. I'm constantly worried about my mortality as I've suffered so much and it doesn't seem to end. I have a mild case of osteopenia and I'm constantly getting these horrible pains in my body muscle tears and like I said pain pain pain!!! I was wondering your thoughts on my story and if you would have any advice on what to do.Will I ever get any better??? As its been and still is a long hard road.

My buffalo hump hurts bad at times.  I have  a moon face.  I had a total hip replacement due to avascular nicosis.  I do take an antidepressant or noone could live with me from the mood swings.  I eat no added salt_ lots of fruits and vegetables.  I'm currently on 10 mg daily.  When I need to take extra doses_ I puff up so much people don't recognise me.  I realize the prednisone has probably saved my life_ but I wouldn't  wish this on anyone.  For young women pregnancy isn't recommended.  I had our son before taking prednisone_ which was good.  There is a movie from the 1950's or 60's about a man who takes prednisone (cortisone).  Anyone taking prednisone and their families should watch.  It's not in color but worth watching.I rated the satisfaction as 4_ because it controls my asthma.  I' d rate the side effects as mostly dissatisfactory.Thanx for the chance to sure my experiece.Kathleen,,F,62,1  years1- 60 mg,8/28/2013Email,Prednisone

100, 4, MS flare,Intense sweating_ raging hunger_ irritability_ insomnia_ crazy energy,I've had to take prednisone a couple times as part of a gradually decreasing 3-week taper after IV steroids for multiple sclerosis flares. Prednisone is a catch-22: it's horrible_ but it actually works. I'm on day 7 of 21 for treatment and I've gained 8 pounds already! Most of the extra weight is due to swelling and bloating and gradually goes down when the treatment is done_ but I'm typically left with 3-5 more pounds after each time I take it. I do like the intense energy burst and wiredness I get while I'm taking it and I use it to clean my house and get lots of stuff done_ but it's not exactly a good energy. It's more like restlessness and agitation. Yet I can count on it to knock out the flare-ups of my illness. It's not enjoyable at all_ but it really does work.,F,39,21  days60 1X D,8/20/2013Email,Prednisone

I got worried_ anxiety started to kick in_ my temperature rose a bit_ began feeling slightly weak_ began to worry a great deal. Went to the ER to make sure it wasn't anything major. Doctor said its nothing major_ he saw no signs of anything major going on_ so he let me go. The next day I was feeling the same. I have had trouble sleeping_ sometimes I would sweat a great deal in my sleep and have nightmares. The next day I went to my personal doctor. The doctor examined me_ checked me out_ and said he found no symptoms of anything serious happening with me. All he could conclude is that this is due to side effects of this tablet_ i.e. Prednisone.

I suffer from horrible joint pain. When I first was put on the higher doses (like 20 plus mg)_ I thought I was going through the change of life. Anxiety was bad. Dr started me on BusPar_ which is a must if I am going to have to be on prednisone. BusPar is non addictive anti anxiety medication_ that I've been on for a few years at a time_ throughout the last 10 yrs_ and have NEVER became addicted. It also does not cause drowsiness..  So many on here are on such high doses. I don't know how anyone can tolerate over 10 mg. Also_ I do know for a fact_ no matter how slow you taper down/off this med_ you WILL have REBOUND PAIN.. Just expect it. I find it best_ to stay on one low dose for RA pain control.. It's the up and downs of going on and off_ that is the WORST.. I was on a burst_ and now tapering down to 5 mg again. NEVER AGAIN. Those burst and tapers are the hardest of me.. I've been in horrible pain for almost 2 weeks now__ just waiting for it to settle down. I have a 10 yr history of this medication. But the last 2-1/2 yrs has been the first time_ I've been on it consistently for this long.. In the past_ I was just put on bursts and tapers. I suggest_ if your Dr puts you on anything more than 10 mg_ ask him if a lower dose to start out with_ might be better for you. Mood swings comes with the higher doses.

I've learned that I need to take it in the mornings because it greatly reduces my hyperactivity mode so I can sleep at night. I don't have an over abundance of side effects because it helps my overactive immune system so much.,"Prednisone is a medication I CAN'T think of NOT taking. I have Celiac Sprue_ Sjogren's Syndrome_ and Sero-Negative R.A. Half of my Immune System is overactive. Prednisone is very helpful in calming my immune system down. When my immune system is suppressed_ I feel like my old self again. I feel healthy! I feel well! Swelling and fluid retention disappears! I have tons of energy and a healthy outlook on life! I can't believe there are so many ""negative comments"" here. It doesn't matter what medications you take_ there will always be ""side-effects."" I had to carefully weigh my options! NOT taking Prednisone is much_ much_ worse for me than taking it. I find that I truly NEED a steroid to manage my illness's there's just NO two ways about it. It suppress's my immune system just enough to make my illness's bearable. If I take more than 10mg. per day_ that's when I notice a few side effects. I try to take the least amount of medications to minimize any side effects. Prednisone when used carefully can save a life! At least it saved mine! I think to many people blame all of their problems on their medications.  There are some of us who don't have the luxury of NOT taking Prednisone or any other Immune Suppressant drug. For those of us who are cursed with Auto Immune Diseases_ it's detrimental to our well being to take this medication because it greatly reduces the incidence or severity of Auto Immune Disorders. Taking Prednisone for many illness's might just save",F,61,4  years7mg. 1X D,12/20/2011Email,Prednisone

Yes it can make you irritable_ gain weight and have problems sleeping but you probably aren't being prescribed prednisone unless you have a disease that is also having bad symptoms. As with all medications_ you need to way the pros and cons to decide if it's right for you. Taking it for 1-2 weeks can really help a lot of allergy related problems. Just tell your doctor your worried about the side effects and they'll probably have good advice (such as taking it right before bed if it's making it hard for you to fall assleep because it won't kick in for a few hours and by then you'll already be asleep). If you only take it for a short period of time you also don't need to worry about gaining weight or getting a moon face_ even if taken at high doses.

While I was taking it_ I couldn't sleep for the life of me. Showed up to work on numerous occasions without sleeping a peep. On my last day of using this medication_ I had a severe reaction. I had to sit down because the room was spinning_ my upper left arm felt like someone was squeezing the heck outta it_ felt as though someone had hit my muscles with a baseball bat over and over_ my heart rate was off the roof_ and felt like I was gonna pass out on the spot.

171, 1, RA of friends,This is a psychotic drug not to be taken long term; Note - if you send me a question leave your e-mail address or I cannot respond,All drugs are poisoness eventually and should be abandonned sooner rather than later. My dad died prematurely on prednisone whereas a friend of mine seems to be cured from RA. What was the difference? I have determined catching the disease early is critical and that around 2 months is a kind of barrier beyond which you become chronic. These powerful drugs can work in an emergency; when RA hit my friend he couldn't get around and went to the emergency and after 5 weeks was put on this drug for only a few weeks before it seemed to cure the RA and the program ended. My dad however was able to get around like me and was not diagnosed until too late. I knew his history but I could not get diagnosed and see a specialist until after 3 months after the attack and they then told me I was chronic. Fortunately I have found natural cures such as the honey and vinegar diet and vitamin B100 complex_ all explained at Dr Saul's website doctoryourself.com. [He is a PhD not MD!] I think Michael Douglas's story is telling; misdiagnosed all last summer until he was in fourth stage cancer and is considering suing. It appears most chronic diseases can actually be cured in stage 1 or even 2 if you read Dr Saul's accounts of MS_ cancer_ RA etc. But good luck seeing the right specialist with the right answer in time_ they make their money on our late stages and get us as permanent chronic patients! And Michael knows because he became chronic it could come back like it did Farrah Fawcett.,M,55,  1X D,4/30/2011Email,Prednisone

The only drawback is that my tongue is swel,If your doctor does not believe that the Prednisone is causing side effects after just a few days_ go see an allergist.  They prescribe it all the time.

My stomach swam with anxiety and I felt like lashing out violently. With the support of my family_ I was able to gain some type of control. We realized I was in trouble and began research on the internet. We came to the conclusion that I was suffering from withdraw from prednisone. I resumed taking a small dosage_and I have not struggled with sudden outburst since. This situation was unexpected and extremely dangerous_ so I felt it imperative to let someone know my experience. Hopefully this information can help another. Now I am taking entocort three times a day as instructed. However_ I have chosen to ween myself off of the prednisone as a precaution(doctor is aware).

I'm allergic to dust mites so that means it's year round and it's impossible to escape. Prednisone is the only medication I've ever taken powerful enough to reverse all of this_ and I've tried just about every allergy medication out there. When I first start taking it I feel like superman. I get an explosion of energy_ all of my allergy symptoms go away_ normal aches and pains that I feel disappear. I can go to the gym and workout all day and feel little pain whereas normally I can barely make it through a workout. The downside is_ after the first 2 or 3 days of taking it the negative effects really start to show up and after 5 days the negatives start to outweight the positive. The withdrawal effects are also absolutely horrible_ I feel terrible for the first 3-4 days of stopping even with a taper.

I have a love / hate relationship with this drug.  When I am sick I desperately want to go up to a high dose to get into remission (nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disease - i feel really sick and get really bad swelling all over my body).  Then when I am on a high dose the side effects of prednisone get worse and I want to taper to a lower dose as fast as possible (which of course I can't).  Although the side effects aren't the best_ I am just grateful there is something that helps me.  I haven't put on any weight at all (in fact I think my appetite decreases on the higher doses)_ which is the side effect most people really hate the most.  Advice to others:  exercise as much as you can to stay fit and healthy and to stop the muscle wasting.  watch out for your bones and have regular bone density scans.  take calcium!  take your prednisone early in the morning (unless you doctor has other ideas of course)_ the side effects should be less that way.  take it with food_ and maybe also take a probiotic to help lessen the harshness on your stomach.  Talk with your doctor about whether you really do need to take it - being on prednisone has made it impossible for me to get health insurance and has made my life insurance really_ really expensive.

It helped my joint pain (my only RA symptom) about 80%_ but there is still about 20% pain left so it did not knock it out as I was hoping. The first week I felt great with the Euphoria side effect_ but I had to take Xanax every night to sleep - there is no way to sleep on this drug_ especially when it's directed to take it before bedtime. And I had to increase my Xanax dose throughout the week at bedtime to get a decent night sleep. Even with the Xanax I still woke up with night sweats.

I was told that I was steriod dependent. Let me give you some advice; do your own research. These 'medications' are man-made and with prolonged usage will damage a lot of once normal working functions in other parts of your body. I'll be honest here. I smoke marijuana and that is the only thing I find to work. I have dodged numerous hospital visits by smoking. It helps nausea_ appetite_ pain_ with no side effects although you will have to be careful with increased appetite. Look into the studies and you will see that marijuana may be more of a medicine than these man-made money making pills that may help one part of your body but will damage other parts in the long term. I have been unable to smoke for about two weeks now and just had a flare-up with my crohn's. This has happened on one other occasion where I was unable to smoke for a long period of time. I find that this is enough proof for me to continue using marijuana to help me with my health. For the past two years I have been continuously smoking and have been symptom free except for the periods of time when I was unable to smoke. That_ in my 12 years of living with crohn's_ has never happened to me. Please do your own research and don't just rely on your doctor.,F,20,8  years30 MG 1X D,7/17/2010Email,Prednisone

It's like: if you were giving someone a rectal exam_ wouldn't that be the FIRST thing you think of? Personally I would use several. I really think the typical person who becomes a gastroenterologist is either a pervert or someone who's very greedy but could not manage to become a specialist in another field. Usually when you hear about doctors who rape_ sexually assault_ or commit sex crimes and abuse against their patients_ they're gastroenterologists_ and more often than not_ the ones from third world countries.,F,19, ,12/18/2009,Prednisone
234, 1, Possible Vasculitis,Severe Weight Gain - Especially in Abdomen_ Severe Dry-Eyes,"Do your research before taking this drug!  I have been off from this drug for nearly a year_ and apparently the side effects will be with me...forever?  I was prescribed this medication for a ""possible"" condition_ and left on it for three months - even though it was not improving my symptons.  I gained 21% of my then current body weight and my abdomen expanded dramatically.  I am 5'3"" tall_ and at 53 years old had weighed 116 pounds for the prior 34 years!  I gained 24 pounds in less than 3 months; and even though I have now lost most of that weight - it never comes off from the abdomen_ even with gym workouts 3 times a week and being a former athlete.  I also never had a dry-eye condition in my life until being put on this medicine.  A year after stopping prednisone_ the dry-eye has still not gone away.  My eyes are constantly red_ feel like there is sand in them_ and hurt after a couple hours of using the computer or watching TV. Even using lubricant eye drops every hour doesn't eliminate those conditions. Apparently this is a wonder drug if you have certain problems - but make sure you have a firm diagnosis before agreeing to take it.

This might not be a bad drug to take if you're 80 years old_ but if you're young_ prednisone could really_ really mess up your life. I wish I had known that...it really_ really messed up mine. I was told it was safe (by my doctor at the University of Iowa_ Anne Sullivan); at that time I thought you could trust doctors. I was wrong. She proved that to me. I had perfect skin_ now I have blotchy_ scarred skin--which is a great thing to have when you're 18_ right?

Also the drug did nothing for me. I ended up putting my disease in remission with just a very clean diet (no dairy_ almost no sugars_ no red meat) and taking probiotics religiously.

It's the law that your doctor tell you this_ because it is so critically important. If your doctor can't be bothered to do his or her job_ find another doctor. Under the supervision of an incompetent doctor this drug could easily end up destroying your life.,"This is what the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation says about prednisone: ""The undesirable side effects of corticosteroids are dependent on both dose and duration of treatment. For many_ the side effects of steroids outweigh their anti-inflammatory benefits...Because of these side effects_ doctors frequently choose safer medications_ such as the 5-ASA drugs and antibiotics_ as initial therapy. But there are a number of ways to reduce the risk of developing side effects."" http://www.ccfa.org/info/treatment/corticosteroids",,, ,3/2/2009,Prednisone

Now_ I'm on Remicade & was able to finally get off of this drug. The side effects are horrendous_ but I don't know what would have happened to me if my flare hadn't gone down. It certainly worked.

Hair loss (dramatic)_ painful cystic acne with scarring (always had fairly clear skin before) grew dark facial hair (I'm blonde). Sore_ red_ dry eyes. Increased hunger had me consulting a personal trainer/nutritionist. Put on strict diet of 1100 cals a day/ exercise 1 hr for 5 days per week.  No help.

Although many here are quick to say ""don't take Prednisone""_ it is often the only answer for some medical conditions. Even now I must be on an inhaled steroid for asthma control.

The most noticeable and most dangerous side effect is that this medicine increased my blood pressure; it was common for me to have a blood pressure reading while on this medicine of 195/120_ of which I was always dizzy_ in fear for my well-being.  When I explained me symptoms to my doctor_ she said to just stop taking the medication.  I did what she said and had a stroke_ now I suffer mild numbness on the left side of my body in the leg_ arm_ fingers_ severe dry mouth_ insomnia_ and lack of attention now to detail.,If prednisone is prescribed for treatment_ I urge you to ask your doctor for an alternative medicine_ if your doctor insists_ please have that doctor explain the side effects_ and give your doctor a full lowdown of all your medical issues and concerns_ tell you doctor you would like to talk over with your spouse_ another doctor or research the drug before you commit to taking it.

No prior history of high blood sugar. Now I am diabetic_ but I think I must have been borderline diabetic before because I had similar symptoms before. PREDNISONE CAN RAISE YOUR BLOOD GLUCOSE DRAMATICALLY -- so if you have extreme thirst and are going to the bathroom all the time you might have DKA like I did -- I ended up in the hospital in ICU! So be careful. Now when I take prednisone I test my blood sugar about 3-4 times a day and take more insulin to compensate.

The mood swings_ crying_ anger_ and all around craziness were out of control and a deal breaker as much as the rest. If someone sneezed wrong I'd want to kill them. Prednisone also depletes your body of calcium and potassium thus giving you muscle spasms and the worst leg cramps you will ever feel in your life. No joke. All the time_ day or night.

""Psychiatric disturbances can occur at any point during corticosteroid treatment_ including almost immediately after initiation and even after cessation of treatment."" ""Patients should be evaluated for any suggestion of suicidality."" ""Corticosteroid-induced psychiatric disturbances are common and include mania_ depression_ psychot","""Educating patients about potential adverse effects and asking about such effects at each patient encounter can enhance early intervention for adverse corticosteroid-induced psychiatric reactions.""

""In our literature review_ we found that the potential psychiatric adverse effects of corticosteroids span a symptom spectrum from subtle mood changes to full-blown affective syndromes and frank psychosis.""""Cognitive deficits_ particularly declarative or verbal memory deficits_ have been well documented during both long- and short-term corticosteroid therapy.""

She told me prednisone was safe and not to worry about side effects; I believed her_ as I would've believed any doctor. I started experiencing side effects right away and the doctors denied them--and now they're permanent_ because they refused to treat them. Also: prednisone didn't help my disease at all. In fact_ just weeks later I was told I was going to die and my mom and I had to drive five hours all the way back to Iowa City_ to the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics_ to see my doctor.

My rheumatologist confirmed this. If it were not for the fact that this is the ONLY drug I can find that alleviates the debilitating pain of PMR_ I would not take it.  The depression_ I think_ is a result of the extreme hair loss_ devastating to women more so than to men. The anger and mood swings it produces alone are not worth taking it for any other reason.  It has turned me from a well-grounded_ happy and kind woman into a person who is aggressively vocal and quick to anger_ a drastic change that was shocking to my friends_ coworkers_ and family. I started at 20 mg and have gradually reduced dosage to 10 mg. It does not get rid of all the pain at 10 mg_ but makes the pain manageable so that I can work and live a normal active life.

I continued to take it starting to wean me down after 3 months and it took over 14 months so I'm now just getting off it.

Once off of all medications but Asacol (and over the counter drugs such as Immodium and Digestive Advantage Crohn's) I felt good and was later diagnosed as being in full remission. However_ I believe the Prednisone was instrumental in getting me to the point where Asacol could maintain the remission. SUMMARY: This drug knocked out my Crohn's within a week or two of starting therapy. I was so terribly disappointed by the fact that I had to stop taking it (dangerous long term side effects according to the doctors). When I was on it_ I felt like I was a completely new man.
