3, 3, ulcerative colitis,Moon face_ painful cramps in calves_ pain in knees and fingers_drastic loss of sleep (on a bad day which was 4 or 5 nights of the week I would get 1 to 2 hours of sleep per night. On a good night I would get 3 or sometimes 4 hours twice a week)I was exhausted but my brain was wired and wouldn't shut down_ I felt like the walking dead. I broke out in acne and grew downy hair all over my face_ I was a bit emotional and irritable sometimes_ appetite increase_ weight gain_ hump back_ my eyes seem to get weaker_ and sever memory loss and hard to concentrate. Once off prednisone I would lose my hair exactly one month after not taking it. (Two years in a row this happened) My hair would fall out daily for 4-5 months straight. The first time it seemed to grow back a bit but then come October I went back on prednisone for an additional 4 months. In February I was completely off it and my hair started to fall out again daily. Last month (June my hair loss has slowed down considerably_ but it's now mid-july and is still falling out.I have little hair left compared to two years ago. Both doctors had said it was NOT due to the prednisone but falling out from  stress. I've been stressed my whole life and never had hair loss. It was alway exactly one month after coming off of Prednisone that my hair came out TWO years in a row. I believe it was the prednisone without doubt.,I was wearing adult diapers for a month and was so sick_ the prednisone help clear that nightmare up and stopped all the bleeding. For four months thereafter I stayed healthy before the bleeding would come back.,F,47,4  months60mg,7/13/2016Email,Prednisone
4, 5, Traumatic brachial plexopathy,I agree with some of you.. When there is no alternative this drug is a lifesaver. I spent almost a year with a numb arm constant nerve radiation and the the muscle became spasmodic every time I tried to move my arm. The pain became excruciating. Lying down would caused immediate numbness and swelling to the arm. I already had major back surgery 1 1/2 years prior. I was fusing and then got hit head on by another driver and that is how this all started. I spent 8 months having test after test (5 mri?s _ ct scan_ emg_ muscle tests) with no diagnosis. At the end I was sleeping in the living room sitting up in a chair dangling my arms because that was the only way I could sleep and my anxiety increased; I was at my wits end I couldn?t take it anymore. The neurologist decided I had traumatic brachial plexopathy and decided to start me on 60mg of prednisone a day. I was on that for 6 weeks_ then he took me to 40mg..I immediately broke out in acne_ had severe abdominal pain with diarrhea_ night sweats and had pain in my calves_ with my back spasming too. 2 weeks later he told me too ween myself as quickly as possible because of the side effects. So I lowered the dose by 5mg every 3-4 days and I just got off 5 days ago. I am still having extreme muscle weakness_ still have abdominal cramping and loose stools every time I eat. My back is killing me. As I stated I take pain meds anyway_ but I do feel like a truck hit me.I have worked full time this entire time because I,,F,46,3  months60mg qd,6/9/2016Email,Prednisone

I chose to come off the drug myself or I would still be prescribed it..stepped the dose down by 2.5mg every two weeks_ monitored by doctor. I have now been off it for 5 months_ my bone density is now low and as a result my heel bones have crumbled leaving me with painful bone spurs_ my toes have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis_ I can now only walk 100 yards with a stick until the pain becomes unbearable. I now have shoulder and finger joint pain and fear they are the next to suffer. In past two months I developed steroid induced rosacea which has moved into my eyes. My face is now usually covered in sores and my eyes are red raw most days_ my fear is getting cornea ulcers and losing my sight. I still have Myasthenia Gravis_ the prednisone did nothing for the condition except leave me crippled and embarrassed to leave the house because of my appearance.

Started on 30mg prednisone 1x daily in January 2016_ along with Dapsone to prevent pneumonia and Prilosec to reduce acid build up caused by prednisone.  After six weeks. X-rays show lungs almost clear.  Stepped down to 25mg prednisone daily for next six weeks and so forth.  Blood work though now shows reduced hemoglobin_ anemia_ which could be caused by Dapsone so off that until it's confirmed.Although Prednisone can be a saving grace on most things_ yes I did get the water retention_ moon face_ fat redistribution side effects and now this anemia cuz the prednisone does weaken your immune system.,Looking forward to getting my life back.,F,52,2  months30mg,3/5/2016,Prednisone

Took 3 20s the first day then 2 20s the remaining days. The insomnia was the most worrying because though I do have problems sleeping_ I never stay up all night. But it happened the first night with the leg pain and the other symptoms. After that_ each day it got better. I started taking the pills before lunch then my nights were much better. The increased smelling was weird too and bothering at times.  My diet helped and I slipped yesterday and had a salty main course for dinner and had some leg swelling into bedtime. Just remember to take them as early as possible at the start of your day and eat and drink as cleanly as possible. Not too much salt or sweets.

My diagnosis of AIH was new_ so I'd been feeling horrible for a long time.  The symptoms began after my first taper in which the dose was lowered from 40mg/day to 30mg/day. Called Dr and he said to go to 35mg for a couple of days and then taper from there. I've been tapering 5mg at a time per week because of the taper side effects. So far it's not helped make things better.  In fact_ the lower back pain is so bad that I can't stand up straight or walk but a few steps before having to bend over to hold onto something while waiting for the pain to pass. I couldn't afford to gain weight_ but I can't afford to allow my liver to be damaged by this AI disease. IMHO_ this is not a drug to be used for simple inflammation issues_ because there is a huge price to pay for using this medication. I took the risk knowing 'most' of the side effects_ but many people aren't told about what can happen. If your doctor prescribes this medication for you for something simple_ please do yourself a favor and ask if there's an alternative.  While I am grateful that I am helping my liver so I don't develop cirrhosis... I wouldn't wish this misery on anyone.,F,54,3  weeks40mg taper 1X D,1/6/2016Email,Prednisone

26, 1, Nasal polyps,Adrenal failure osteopenia,Hi guys... I was placed on a dose of 25 mg prednisone for 2 weeks including taper.  The reason I was placed on it was because of nasal polyps I ended up feeling great and breathing 100% I made the misfortunate decision to remain on the drug for 9 months as I could not breathe properly for 7 years... Well I didn't know exactly that the drug I was taking was rapidly destroying my body and mind... When I finally came clean with the dr and told him what I did_ I was told I would be fine in 4-6 weeks. I didn't taper properly and now a just over a year later I'm still doing it tough!!! I had adrenal failure no testosterone left in my body and I'm constantly in pain I have been to 4 Drs since and they all say the same thing. I'm constantly worried about my mortality as I've suffered so much and it doesn't seem to end. I have a mild case of osteopenia and I'm constantly getting these horrible pains in my body muscle tears and like I said pain pain pain!!! I was wondering your thoughts on my story and if you would have any advice on what to do.Will I ever get any better??? As its been and still is a long hard road.

50, 1, Poison Ivy,Disabling depression_ thoughts of death_ hallucinations_ boiling stomach_ burning intestines_ headaches_ limp arms and legs_ insomnia_ anxiety_ UTI_ teeth pain_ blurry vision_ and scared to be left alone.,This drug turned my life into a nightmare. I had a gastroenterologist work to get my guts normal again_ a psychiatrist to get my mental issues resolved and a counselor to help me rebuild my ability to live without complete dependence on my family. I Will Never Take This Drug Again. Had I known these side effects I would have never taken this for poison ivy.  This drug should be very restricted for use. Doctors should ask more questions before writing a RX for this. If you have a history or family history of anxiety or depression you need to be very careful with this drug.,F,42,5  days40 MG,2/14/2015Email,Prednisone

52, 1, Asthma,I will NEVER take this poison toxic deadly drug again. I was given it in hospital and very shortly after felt terrible. Sickness_ mood swings from raging (could have ripped a wall down) to feeling weird spaced out. Shaking_ tremours. I was near bouncing off the walls in my head.I was shouting and very aggitated. Was sick and stomach was so very painful. I was itching all over my legs and arms felt burning. They give me some allergic reaction medicine tthriough an IV and after seeing the consultant on the ward was given Hydro cortisone through IV. That made me feel moody_ nausea_ headache and period early. Stomach cramps but compared to prednisone not even a quarter as bad. This drug should be banned!!,NEVER take this poison again.,F,54,1  days10mg 3X D,1/9/2015,Prednisone

Completely disabling. Also did not unclog ear,I think a new pathway was kindled iny brain ad I now have tremors in my legs all the time almost four years later. I also get panic attacks with any Lind of medication that sedates. Prior to prednisone I was fine.,F,52,7  days20mg,12/25/2014Email,Prednisone
56, 1, Auto immune disease- SLE,Took this from 1997-2008 with no break. Almost every side effect. Amounts varied during those years.  Ruined my life more than disease. Off of it for 6 years but too much damage done. Had to take again in 2014. Tried not to but disease symptoms made it difficult.  Can prevent death from disease but may not be worth it due to the short and long term side effects. Self-tapering after 2 months_ want off of it ASAP. Will choose death next time.,It's horrible and will ruin your life on high amounts or over long periods of time. Try to avoid. I am prepared to die than take this drug anymore.,F,33,10  years60-2.5,12/10/2014,Prednisone
57, 2, Rheumathoid Arthritis Flare up,I started taking prednisone pack for 10 days_ at the ER_then given. A shot through. My IV fluid_  then after a month. I WAS admitted to the ER. Once again. And given prednisone 10MG_then they raised it to 15 mg. For about a month_ and now I stopped it with Dr's instructions to go from 15mg to 10mg for 1 week then 5 mg for one week then 2.5 for 3 days. During the course I was feeling very angry_ my period was early and only lasted 2 days_I was nauseated_ my stomach was burning and I had lots of stomach pains_ I couldn't sleep I was getting heartburn and I was vomiting stomach acid! But I stopped that over 15 days ago and I am extremely  hungry_ and  I feel Very emotional_ and very tired_And I am very frustrated because. I'm scared to gain weight after I struggled to loose over 100lbs over the course of 4 years. Does anyone know how long would I experience this type of side effect_  also I will never ever take steroids again!!  Now I'm on Humira and Methotrexate and sulfazine and Plaquenil and clorocolonile!,,F,36,1  months15mg,12/6/2014,Prednisone
58, 5, nephrotic syndrome and minimal chan,My 3 yr old son not only gets chipmunk cheeks but also gets dark circles under his eyes.. he is always hungry but is on a 2000mg low sodium diet which makes it extremely hard... however this medication has really helped him even with his relapses,,M,3,3  months15mg,11/26/2014Email,Prednisone
59, 5, Multiple Sclerosis Progressive,Not a fan of steroids since a bad reaction in 2008 to Solu Medrol IV but so far only thing I notice is not being able to sleep ( but that's not a bad thing since I suffer from MS Fatigue) and I do see some puffiness from the meds in my face and stomach but I'm offsetting that with diet/tea and it's helping some. I'm going to see this to day 12. I wish I had done his sooner. I was never going to touch any steroids again but glad I did this time.,I'm on a 12 day treatment of starting out with a certain amount then downsizing to a few. I stayed away from this drug since a horrible reaction from Solu Medrol in 2008 when I was first diagnosed. I have suffered years from pain and inflammation. Pain meds only did so much and I'm very careful with narcotic pain meds I'm given. I caved in and agreed to a 12 day course. I'm on day 7 and I feel wonderful beyond words. I can't believe I allowed myself to go so long in such agony. I hope it lasts awhile. I don't want to do this again but right now the leg pain_ nerve pain hip pain..are gone. I'm walking better not like a duck or with a cane. It's so great to feel a bit better.,F,35,12  days 1X D,11/22/2014,Prednisone
