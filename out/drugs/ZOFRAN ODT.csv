0, 2, Nausea,For months I've been taking this both in the hospital and at home. Could never understand why my Christ hurt and my blood pressure and pulse would go up until I read the side effects. I've thrown up while on it so what's the point?,,F,43,6  months,7/20/2016Email,Zofran odt
1, 5, Nausea and fear of throwing up,Occasional headache or slight constipation_ but only rarely.,Miracle drug_ if one dose doesn't work it's safe to take up to 24 mg a day I believe. It's very effective and I've never had to take that much. Miracle drug!,F,23,1  days8mg,5/9/2016,Zofran odt
2, 5, Migraines,Marked drowsiness and slightly dizzy at first but I could still function during the day.,I had bad nausea due to migraines this helped. Worked fast. Tried other anti nausea meds in the past but they all caused major drowsiness.,F,37,1  days4mg,12/3/2015,Zofran odt
3, 5, Nausea from Stomach Bug,Constipation_ a little tired,This drug is a life saver. I have had stomach flu bug every year for the past 3 years. Each time this drug keeps me from vomiting. I may still have some slight nausea but it is 10 times better after the pill. I would be dead without it as I would rather die than throw up. I take 200 mg of Magnesium (you can get it at any drugstore) and that combats the constipation. Other over the counter remedies for constipation don't work for me.,F,49,1  days8 mg,11/16/2015Email,Zofran odt
4, 1, Hep c tx viekira makes me nauseous,Severe HA one hour after first dose then jaw pain and feeling of anxiety and red face. My B/P which is usually 110/74 at most was 164/102 pulse 112 hard to breath. I was scared to death.,Haven't taken much medicine in my life (my Hep C came from blood transfusion ) But would never take this one again!!!,F,58,1  days4mg,10/16/2015Email,Zofran odt
5, 3, Nauseau,,If I take this early enough it takes the edge of nausea but does not eliminate it by any stretch of the imagination. Phenergan is so superior_ but doctors are more reluctant to prescribe.,F,58, 8 mg 2X D,6/27/2015,Zofran odt
6, 1, nausea,severe constipation,I would only take this as a last resort.  I'd rather take Phenergan or dramamine and be asleep than to be severely constipated.  This is TMI (sorry)_ but after taking this for 2 to 3 days_ I was severely constipated for a week or more with a giant ball of stool that could not be passed_ consisting of many marble-sized balls of stool.  Trust me_ you don't want to go through what I went through.  I have dealt with constipation from pain meds_ surgery_ etc._ and nothing remotely compares to this extreme constipation.,F,52,2  days4 mg 2X D,6/16/2015,Zofran odt
7, 5, Morning Sickness,Constipation,I tried phenergen and diclegis before zofran...finally feel like I'm not a drunken sailor. Morning sickness lasted well into second trimester and zofran allowed me to still function at work_ eat_ and drive. I didn't throw up while taking it and it drastically reduced the constant nausea. I had initial concerns about taking while pregnant_ but looked over the research and can't find any conclusive study (as the case with most medications and pregnancy) to outweigh the risk to benefit.,F,31,4  months8mg 1X D,4/2/2015,Zofran odt
8, 2, HG pregnancy,Initially after a day I felt great and was able to eat. After 4 days of taking Zofran I woke up and thought I was having a heart attack. It was like a sumo wrestler sat on my chest compacting it_ and like someone karate kicked my back between my shoulders. Very frightening.,Get side effects checked out!!!,F,32,1  days4mg,12/8/2014,Zofran odt

13, 5, Migraine cyclic vomiting,I get akathesia when I take compazine_ reglan and phenergan. This relieves the vomiting that occurs every 20-30 minutes. I only have these episodes 1-3 times a year but this prevents me from going into the ER.,,F,33,4  years4mg,3/15/2014Email,Zofran odt
14, 5, Gastroparesis,Constipation.  However so worth it. Often have to take 8 mg_ but if taken at beginning of nausea_ then that 8 mg lasts all day.  Worth every penny. Pheregan works better for nausea_ but I can not function at work on even a small dose of  phenegan.,,F,53,8  months4,12/27/2013,Zofran odt
15, 5, Nausea/fear of vomiting,Mild headache and sometimes dizziness,This is like a miracle drug. I have a severe fear of vomiting_ so I keep these on hand. If I ever get sick or start to feel really nauseated_ I just need to take one and I feel better within 20-30 minutes. Like most drugs. though_ it works best if you take it before symptoms have a chance to get severe. If you have a feeling that your stomachache isn't going to go away or might get really bad_ or if it's one of those things where you suddenly get hit with it_ take it sooner rather than later as it will work faster and relieve more of the nausea. Taking it when you're already very sick and on the verge of throwing up still helps_ but it may not get rid of all the nausea_ just take the edge off. I love this drug_ though_ I'd be so lost without it. I can now eat out at restaurants and try new foods without feeling anxious and afraid about the potential consequences.,F,18,  1X AN,11/28/2013,Zofran odt
16, 3, nausea,For the last few days days my poop has been white!I have scoured the internet about possible reasons_ and when researching what is in these tablets_ there is hydrochloride_ so it might be a culprit.,As for the way it worked_ it worked wonderfully to relieve the nausea.,F,18,1  days 1X AN,4/23/2013Email,Zofran odt
17, 5, nausea,no side effects whatsoever. it helped with my nausea so well. the strawberry taste helps because when you're constantly vomiting you don't want to take a pill with a bad taste.,,F,21,2  weeks4mg,3/11/2013Email,Zofran odt
18, 5, frequent vomiting from pregnancy,No noticeable side effect. Maybe slight tired haze_ which is far better than vomiting 10x a day. Drug saved me from being hospitalized while pregnant.,,F,32,7  days4mg,2/22/2013,Zofran odt
19, 3, morning sickness/nauseau,Bad Headache_ body tingled some_ tremors/shaking_panic attack,It made my nauseau better_ but i still felt nauseus. At least i didnt throw up.  But I didnt like the feeling this pill gave me. Doc told me to take 1/2 of a pill or 1 pill 8 mg.

27, 4, Severe morning sickness,Severe constipation_ headaches,Zofran is helping me tremendously with my morning sickness.  This is my second pregnancy - with my first pregnancy_ I was so sick that Zofran didn't seem to really help me_ but I definitely notice an improvement with this one.  I do have to eat Activia yogurt with Benefiber to combat the constipation_ which is severe_ let me tell you.  But having to address that is better than throwing up and feeling so incredibly nauseous all day long.,F,32,7  days8 MG 1X D,9/21/2011Email,Zofran odt
28, 5, Hyperemesis,None,This is my third and most severe HG pregnancy. During my worst weeks (7-20) I took 8mg twice a day in addition to Dicletin and Gravol. This kept me out of the hospital and quite functional_ although still slightly nauseous. At 21 weeks I began to wean down to just the Zofran and only 2 Dicletin. By week 28 I was only taking the Zofran on an as needed basis. This drug was not available during my previous pregnancies and even though this is my most severe bout of HG_ with the help of the Zofran I am actually the most functional_ least depressed and have been able to gain the most weight out of all my pregnancies. This drug was an absolute miracle for me with no side effects other than some minor constipation.,F,36,21  weeks8mg 2X D,7/30/2011Email,Zofran odt
29, 4, AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma,Minor headache,Got my first disolving tablet a few hours earlier after spending the entire day and previous evening with severe nausea and vomiting. Within one hour my stomach stopped doing flip-flops and I have not thrown up in almost 4-hours - nausea feeling is still there_ but nothing like it was earlier.  I will be updating this as I take Zofran more often.,M,20,1  days4 mg 1X AN,6/12/2011Email,Zofran odt
30, 4, Indigestion and Chronic nausea,Headache (but this only happened on the first few times I took it) and drowsiness,It doesn't completely knock out the nausea_ but it definitely takes the edge off.  It does cause some drowsiness_ but nowhere near the level that phenergan causes.  Phenergan used to make it very difficult for me to wake up_ but this doesn't give me a problem with waking.,M,23,3  months8 mg 1X AN,4/3/2011Email,Zofran odt

32, 4, Morning sickness,Just a headache_ which is better than vomiting all day,I am on my 8th week of pregnancy and it has been terrible up to this point. Severe nausea and vomiting daily_ making life and work unbearble for me. I have no vacation time left so I had no choice but to be placed on Zofran_ it worked like a dream for me. I do get headaches but I will deal with that so I don't have to keep vomiting.,M,34,2  days8mg 1X D,11/17/2010,Zofran odt
33, 2, nausea due to stomach virus4,dizziness_ skin tingling stomach pain_ light headed_ disoriented_ muscle contractions_ tremors,I have taken the SL in past with no problems.  Felt that this was truly a great drug.  When it works it is fantastic.  I am not sure what happen this time.  It was the oral tablets and not the sublingual and I am not sure if that makes a difference.,F,52,2  days4 mg 3X D,11/16/2010,Zofran odt
34, 3," ""morning"" sickness",severe insomnia,Note on the dosage: the prescription was to take a 4mg tablet every 8 hours or as needed. I generally only took it once per day_ occasionally twice_ and once or twice I took it three times in a day. It worked wonderfully for my severe morning sickness- I felt 100% better! Unfortunately_ I finally figured out that it was the cause of SEVERE INSOMNIA for me. I was getting 0-2 hours of sleep per night. Doc gave me Ambien and I STILL didn't sleep. I did some research and found it is selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype_ 5-HT3_ and decided to see what would happen if I stopped taking it. The first 3 days off Zofran nothing happened. After that_ each day I slept about 1 hour more_ but I was more and more ill. At the 6 day mark_ I was severely ill all over again. I switched to phenergan and hope it will be good enough that I am not throwing up and that it does not cause the severe insomnia. I have seen no other reports of such insomnia caused by Zofran_ and expect I am an unfortunate and unique case.,F,31,42  days4mg 3X D,11/1/2010,Zofran odt

37, 5, severe morning sickness all day,occasional headaches,This is a miracle pill! For the first 2 weeks of my pregnancy i could not move from the bed with the trash can beside it. I had tried phennergan but that didn't touch the nausea. My OB prescribed me Zofran ODT and after getting it in my system for about 2 days I could work and eat just as normal as before the pregnancy. I am now 8 months pregnant and if I skip the dosing for one day I am back to the same way i was before I started. I would definately reccomend this to anyone with severe nausea.,F,21,6  months4mg 2X D,5/2/2010,Zofran odt
38, 4, hyperemesis,Headache_ constipation,This is my third pregnancy to require Zofran. The first two times it was like a miracle cure with a minor side effect of headaches.

I was in the hospital multiple times for it. Zofran worked_ but my doctor's had to make sure I actually did need it before prescribing it.

41, 3, Extreme Morning Sickness,Headache_ constipation_ nausea,I had extreme nausea and vomiting due to pregnancy.  While my symptoms did not go completely away I was able to function and go to work.  I still felt nauseous and like I was going to vomit_ but never did.  Took in 8 hr increments.  I would take benadryl before bed and then  set my alarm at 4 AM for a 5:30 wake-up and I would not throw up in the morning.  It is better than nothing_ but did not completely help me.,F,33,2  weeks,1/18/2010,Zofran odt
42, 4, Severe pregnancy all day sickness,none,i was prescribed 4mg tablts 2xday. During a working day_ I took two_ when I was home I took one. Zofran is a very pricey pill_ but it worked. Some days_ after taking it I didn't feel pregnant at all_ others I felt nauseous a little bit. I was very skeptical about taking meds during pregnancy_ but I got pregnant three months after having my first baby (didn't even get a chance to start Birth Control)_ and after vommiting violantly for entire 9 months (including during labor)_ my body was so exhausted_ with being sick without a break_ I decided to try it.,F,22,20  days,8/15/2009,Zofran odt
43, 5, morning sickness,Occational headaches,I was tentative about taking medication during my pregnancy_ but at 9 weeks nausea was preventing me from even leaving my bed. I started by taking the prescribed dosage and felt 100% better! After a few days_ I cut the pill in half to see if that would do the trick. I now take half a pill every morning and that seems to hold off nausea for the entire day.,F,31,2  weeks,7/8/2009,Zofran odt
44, 5, Severe Morning Sickness all day.,some constipation in the beginning but this cleared up once my body adjusted.  Some headaches which also cleared up.,I call this drug my little miracle.  My mom and sister were both sick all 9 months with their children and I am following in their footsteps so this has been very helpful. I was only having about 3 productive hours during my work day and I have a very detail-oriented job.  Zofran helps me be able to work a full day and feel normal again.  What a relief.  Thanks to all who reccomended it.,F,34,3  weeks,4/13/2009Email,Zofran odt
45, 5, Hyperemesis Gravidarum,moderate constipation_ headache,I took this medication for Hyperemesis Gravidarum. I took it in ODT form and via IV. Both forms worked very well. I need to mention that it did not completely relieve the nausea_ but it did control the vomiting. I would highly recommend this medication for anyone suffering from severe nausea +/- vomiting.,F,34,8  months,3/4/2009Email,Zofran odt
46, 4, pregnancy,none.,"I found myself ""sick"" with pregnancy. I was 3 months along_ dropped from 120 lbs. to about 105 lbs. and keeping down about three meals a week. That's when my Dr. told me to try ZOFRAN. I took ZOFRAN every day after that...through four pregnancies. With every baby I noticed that the ZOFRAN didn't help as much. Finally with my last child_ at only two and a half months along_ I was in the hospital fully dosed on ZOFRAN and a couple of other similar drugs... still throwing up every hour. After a week in the hospital_ my Dr. (had been frantically searching for ""something"" to help) rushed in and with the help of a nurse_ gave me a dose of steroids. Yes_ steroids. It isn't something to take lightly and it was quite literally a LAST resort. HOWEVER! It WORKED! I stepped down off the ZOFRAN pump and managed with one ZOFRAN pill in the morning and a tiny bit of a steroid pill did the trick. I was careful to take just as much as I needed to feel ""ok"" not ""great&",F,30,33  months,1/9/2009,Zofran odt
47, 4, Morning Sickness,Fatigue,It helped curb the violent episodes of throwing up. I had severe morning sickness and this medicine made it possible to finally eat_ but I still had the urge to throw up_ but thankfully I didn't anymore.,F,27, ,9/26/2008,Zofran odt
48, 1, Severe morning sickness,no side effects,I suppose I'm one of the only women out there where this drug didn't TOUCH my morning sickness.  Not a bit. Might as well have been taking a placebo pill.  Tried for about a week with no avail -  I was SO disapointed!,F,33,7  days,5/23/2008,Zofran odt
49, 5, Surgery and with Flagyl,None.  This drug has been a lifesaver for me.  I wish they had it when I had morning sickness years ago.

52, 5, Brain Aneurysm burst,Slight increase in headache on occasion. Other than that experienced no side effects.,This is the best anti-nausea medication on the market today! Due to my aneurysm all I have to do is turn my head_ stand up_ smell food or anything and I get extremely ill. If I vomit I end up in the hospital. I now take Zofran ODT for the nausea; within a couple minutes it is gone. No more hospitalization. Unfortunately my health care provider is no longer going to carry the ODT and I will have to use the swallow. Now I will have to wait for it to work like the Phenergan which does not_ compazine which does not. This is a great medication.,F,44,16  months,12/2/2007,Zofran odt

57, 5, nausea from migraine,None,Miracle drug for nausea and vomiting!  I take 2 8mg.  Works fast.  Taste is minty and light_ dissolves quickly for brand name.  For generic taste is minty_ but a little grainy_ and takes longer to dissolve.  Generic works just the same and cost less so I still get it.   I prefer it very much over the older stanby for migraine nausea - phenergan.  Made me sleep way too long.  Can't say enought good things about it!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for people with migraines who can't keep anything down.  This will let you finally be able to take your pills.,F,31,1.5  years,8/22/2007Email,Zofran odt
