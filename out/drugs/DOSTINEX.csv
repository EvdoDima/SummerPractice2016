2, 1, Prolactinoma,My husband is taking Dostinex for his tumor. Ever since he started taking this drug his personality starting to change slowly. Going out not coming home wants to live a single life. Now he says he doesnt love me. He only takes .05mg once a week. He has to see his specialists for review. I'm saddened that a medication can do this to a personm Yet he thinks his normal. But after reading all the review I def know it's the medication. I just hope their is a solution.,,M,40,3  years,5/18/2016Email,Dostinex

8, 4, Prolactinoma,Felt tired_ a day or two after taking it.  Had smaller dosage than others I see listed.,Took 10 mg/wk for 13 years (listing above only went to 10 yrs).  Had prolactinoma removed 3 yrs in_ with a smaller remnant left.  The neurosurgeon did not want to damage the pituitary. Eventually the remnant disappeared after taking it for those extra yrs.  I was just thankful the severe headaches had stopped after the surgery.  It's a gradual recovery_ not instantaneous.,F,51,10  years10 mg/week,1/17/2016,Dostinex
9, 2, Hyperprolactimea,Indigestion_ lightheaded,I have been experiencing erectile dysfunction due to high prolactin in my blood due to tumor on my pirtuary gland and the Doctor prescribed Dostinex (Cabergoline)to shrink the tumor and lower my prolactin levels and I have been on this nedication for two months and no improvement.

11, 5, Pituitary adenoma,None. My doctor recommended I take it at bed time to avoid nausea_ so that's what I've always done.,I was diagnosed with a macro adenoma at age 17_ and started Dostinex with my Prolactin level in the 900s. I got my period within about 6 months. At age 21_ my doctor suggested stopping Dostinex for 3 months to see if I still needed it (the tumor had shrunk so much that it was no longer visible on an MRI for quite some time). Upon checking my Prolactin level_ it was very high_ but no tumor growth was visible on MRI. Resumed Dostinex and stayed regular until getting pregnant with no problems at age 24. Throughout pregnancy and nursing_ I was off Dostinex for 26 months_ but there was still no tumor growth visible_ though my Prolactin levels were quite high. After I stopped breastfeeding_ I resumed Dostinex and started having regular cycles after about 3 months.,F,27,10  years1mg,10/1/2015,Dostinex

When I was taking it very consistently my levels went from 52 to 17 but now they average for about 42.  I have been strict on my dose for the last few months since I want to get off this dreadful medicine.  My tumor is between 3-6mm and has stayed the same size for 10 years.  I really cannot stand this medicine_ I have to take it when I am not working the next day because it makes me so out of it.  I want to get surgery but my endo is advising against it due to the size.

16, 1, Prolactinoma/tumor,Wow. First few days nothing. 2 week in depression strange anxiety and loss of appetite/nauseous and dizzy_ like I could fall over easily. Hypersexuality_ almost over powering. I touched my colleague and ask her if she wanted to have sex!? I never acted like this before_ every woman I encounter I want to proposition for sex!??  Like so strong sexual desires_ but also feeling strong depression_ strong mood swings and sleepiness. I  just feel...weird_ like my personality has been changed.,I do not like this drug at all. Thank god my labs recently said my prolactin has dropped quickly to 4.NL_ which i was told is almost below normal_ so I feel lucky. I am currently living in a 3rd world country as an English teacher_ so many docs here are really unsure what to do or willing to give straight answer. A good doc I spoke with in USA said my tumor did not look aggressive. I will finish out the amount of meds I have then quit them!

22, 1, Prolactinoma - active,Nausea; heavy_ woozy head; headache; extreme tiredness and sleepiness; dizzy feeling; vomiting; hypersomnia - and the very WORST - SUICIDAL DEPRESSION.,"This drug is a case where the treatment is worse than the disease. My idiot endocrinologist told me to start out at the full dose and to take it at 9 a.m. Thank God I have learned enough in the last five years to know not to trust a doctor to know what he/she is talking about. So I started at 1/4 of a pill at bedtime instead of a whole one in the morning. It's s good thing. For the next three days I lived with constant nausea_ headaches and the feeling that I was only halfway awake. I slept all day and felt horrible when I was awake. Then the fourth day I was supposed to take a second dose_ another full pill. I didn't. I waited until I recovered from the first 1/4 dose and tried again. The same thing happened again. The one time I actually took several doses (half doses) according to the prescribed schedule_ by the fifth dose I was suicidal. The depression was that bad.Doctors knew about bromocriptine (another dopamine agonist) the 1980s or earlier And now it's 2015 and the best they've come up with is another drug almost just like it.  For heaven's sake_ these are OUR LIVES you are ruining by expecting us to take these horrible drugs and just ""get used to"" the side effects. It's no skin off their noses when you call their office and say the drug.isn't tolerable. They just tell you you take it anyway and ""maybe the side effects will improve with time."" Whose time? Not theirs. Another doctor told me (regarding pituitary tumor treatment) ""oh_ ed jus",F,57,2  weeks1/2 mg,2/1/2015Email,Dostinex
23, 2, microprolactinoma + high prolactin,Intially: uterine cramping/pain that did not respond to ANY pain meds_ combined with aggressive and depressive episodes. Substantial nausea which did eventually dissipate_ a period of hot flashes and acne_ constipation (did dissipate). After IUD insertion to treat the uterine pain_ and dose was upped_ two episodes of VERY high sex drive_ lasting a few days_ followed by aggressive and depressive mood swings_ eventually becoming a worsening depression featuring: Lack of motivation_ focus and mental acuity_ anhedonia_ exhaustion_ inability to exercise due to oppressive fatigue_ no sex drive_ hopeless and despairing thoughts_ not wanting to get out of bed in the morning_ no desire to connect with people_ upper portion of emotional spectrum missing; felt just neutral at best_ unable to feel happiness or comfort in any form.,Diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia in 2009_ with 3mm prolactinoma. Prolactin was at 30_ no cycle. Was put on .25mg per week of cabergoline. Within days_ I experienced severe uterine cramping which did not respond to ANY pain medication. Dropped to back to half the dose. My cycle returned. Pain: On a scale of 1-10_ pain ranged from 3-8_ and could last for hours or days. Also had aggressive and depressive moods. Endured  this for 4 YEARS. Got an IUD_ (Feb. 2013)  Pain stopped. Again attempted the .25mg dose. My levels were at 80_ dropped to 40_ then began to rise again. Dose was upped to 3/4 of the .5mg pill. Sex drive went THROUGH THE ROOF for a week_ and then slowly_ moodiness set in. Levels were still going up_ endo upped dose again to .5mg pill_ After 2 days having severe aggressive and depressive episodes_  dropped back to the 3/4 pill. Things only got worse; Emotional spectrum went from low neutral at best to absolute despair. Knowing that this was NOT right_ I sought therapy and did research. It seemed I was suffering from dopamine depression_ which is bizarre because Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist. Depression IS listed in the side effects_ occurring in 3% of people. My therapist wanted to see what I was like off the meds.  Stopped meds in June 2014_depression lifted though still moody.  Currently taking a supplement called Mucuna Pruriens_ which contained L-Dopa - VASTLY improved mood_ focus and motivation. Levels still high_ meds dont seem to really lower them,F,38,5  years.125-.5mg 1X W,12/3/2014Email,Dostinex
24, 1, Macroadenoma - high prolactin,Hair loss_ BURNING scalp_ nauseous_ anxiety_ hot flashes_ loss of appetite_ weight loss,I had a horrible reaction to Cabergoling (generic for Dostinex).  My scalp started burning after 3 weeks on the medication and I lost a massive amount of hair.  I also completely lost my appetitie and lost 8 pounds in about 2 weeks.  The drugs stay in your system too long.  If you are considering taking it_ I would try a dopamine agonist that does not stay in your system that long to see if you have a bad reaction first.  It took me 2 months to figure out that the medication was causing this reaction because it took a while to build up in my system.  Be cautious.,F,40,2  months.25 2X W,11/13/2014Email,Dostinex

Juts for your information I an prolactinamia with prolatin levels of 1000 with an 8mm benign growth. i have been told I need to be on medication for the rest of my life. So I have had found my self incredibly anxiuos the last few weeks_ however I do have bodeline personality disorder_ but this is the worst I have felt_ so I decided to check if the meds had anyside effects (Dostinex). Seems like it may do_ if peoples symptoms are not due to pre existing conditions. But anyways I have started on lexapro (anti anxiety/depressent) to try and find an equilibrium.

31, 5, Prolactinoma/Pituitary Tumor,The side effects that I have had are pretty much all positive! My personality has FINALLY come back around again -- I have never felt better.  Serious sexual arousal as of the last couple of months. My period has come the last three months.  I went and got a pedicure about three weeks ago_ my normal nail tech said she noticed some white dots in between my toes_ they don't itch or anything - I don't know if that has anything to do with it.  My feet and ankles do swell_ but that could also be from the amount of weight I put on pre-medicine.  Also -- I have LOST weight since I went on this medicine and my glucose came down from 126 to 86.  I  do urinate a lot more often.  No headaches_ no muscle issues_ Irritability has gone away big time.  My friends and family have all commented on how I seem like a different person since I started the Cabergoline.,"For me_ and so far_ Cabergoline is the best thing that has ever happened to me with this issue.  My Prolactin was around 250 and it is now down in the mid 40s.  My doctor wants it down further_ so he just pushed me from one pill per week to two.  I am hoping that the two pills don't put me into a new realm of side effects.  Before I got started with this medication_ I asked him_ ""What are the side effects?""  His response: ""None - You get better""  And after being on the Bromocriptine_ I couldn't refuse that.  Best of luck to everyone and anyone - I hope it works out.",F,33,5  months.5 2X W,8/27/2014,Dostinex
32, 3, Micro Prolactinoma,I was diagnosed with a micro prolactinoma 4 years ago when symptoms occurred such as galactorrhea. Side effects I experience include EXTREME fatigue_ severe headaches_ vertigo when first started taking dostinex_ brain fogginess_ dizziness if I stand up too fast and just feeling really lousy. I've also had severe problems with my stomach over the last 4 years including bloating_ diarrhea and pains not sure if that's related to the dostinex. I went on a trial period for 6months after 3 years where I stopped taking the medication and side effects went away however prolactin levels increased to 880 and starting lactating again so am back on the medication.

33, 4, Prolactinoma,Extremely high  libido and constant sexual arousal. Doctors don't warn you or acknowledge this happens in women.  My doc says she's never heard of this side effect in women but I found lots of evidence online that it's common.  This is sounds harmless and even funny to some dr.'s especially a male dr. that I had once but this becomes frustrating_ embarrassing and problematic for several reasons.

It seemed to work since my prolactin level went down and the tumor shrank. Well i believe my personality started to progressively change i became unhappy in life_ etc...i stopped the med for about 2 years and the prolactin level went back up with breast discharge. I went back on it _ things went ok until it no longer worked. They changed the prescription to 2 x wk in the generic form. I think my depression has worsened since. It was pretty bad before but now i blame it on the medication since i started having hair loss as well. It now all makes sense when i see the posts here.

I have very thick hair_ but now it is half the thickness that it used to be! I also gained 10lbs in a month which I worked so hard to lose during the summer. Yes_ the medicine has lowered my prolactin levels from 257 to 29 within 3 months and restored my period which I hadn't had for 3 years_ but I feel like there are too many side effects for me.,F,17,3  months.5 2X W,1/19/2014,Dostinex
40, 4, High prolactin Microadenoma,My periods stopped when I was 25_ and Dostinex helped them become regular. It does cause lethargy_ tingling in the hands_ aural migraines_ and white lights in my periphery. My OBGYN suggested I take the drug vaginally and that reduced the side effects. He had me stop taking it last week to see if my levels go up because I've been on it so long_ and I have since had two migraines within 3 days_ and a dull headache. I think these are withdrawal symptoms. I will also have a bone density test done to see if it's had any effects on my skeletal system.,This drug does work_ and it has allowed me to ovulate and have two children_ but it does have side-effects. The anti-depressant Zoloft makes the lethargic effects even worse...I felt like a zombie during the day_ so I'm now taking 150mg of Wellbutrin instead_ and have gotten my energy and focus back. I'm thinking that it might work even better now that I've stopped the Dostinex. My advice to the ladies experiencing side-effects_ take this drug vaginally (you know it's tiny_ so just insert it and it dissolves)_ and consider the low-dose of Wellbutrin_ or the generic to counter the tiredness.,F,39,12  yearshalf .05mg 2X W,1/16/2014Email,Dostinex

Never having my period_ blood test revealed prolactin level at 10_500. I was put on Dostinex_ but it was a gradual step up to my full dose_ so never felt the side effects until I got to my 2 tablets a week_ then the fun started. I was very aggressive and angry all the time_ then constantly sad... Now leading up to 2006 I had quite a tough year with deaths so I just put it down to grief_ until it was Christmas Day and I was balling my eyes out because I couldn't find the right words while talking to my mum.I saw my endo_ he wanted to put me on anti depressants_ I don't think counteracting meds with more meds is smart_ so I seemed a 2nd opinion.My tumour was encasing my pituitary_ it was 1.7x1.4x1.8cm and just touching my optic nerves.New endo said I was the perfect candidate for surgery so I took that option_ after being on bromocriptin for a few months.Fast forward to now 2013...

47, 1, prolactinoma,terrible heachache_ muscle contractions_ tingling in hands and feet_ pain in chest_ hysterical laughter,I took dostinex for 9 wks for a prolactinoma (3- 4 mm) since I was lactating.  Immediately had a bad headache for days and muscle pain in various parts of my body. Would laugh about nothing almost like I was drunk.  My family couldn't believe it! Started getting tingling and numbness in hands and feet and then had an attack of some kind.  Waves of nerve pain in my hand_ arms_ feet and legs.  Uterine contractions_ pain in both kidneys with radiating pain around my torso.  The worst was a pain in the middle of my chest accompanied by nerve pain radiating from it with my arms going limp.  Had this for 14 days even though I had stopped the medicine.  Have been back and forth to a neurologist who thinks it may have been dostinex interacting with my migraine medicine_ sumatriptan.  Do not take these together ever!  After 4 months_ I still have neurological pain in my face(I thought I needed several root canals)_ hands_ feet and throat.  Hoping this will all go away!

A significant improvement but still considered high and outside the normal range.  T levels however are still low_ still at 130 where they were before (should be between 300 and 1000.  Second MRI showed decrease in tumor as well_ down to 7mm.  I am hoping that by continuing to take the meds_ they will bring my prolactin levels to normal and will hopefully trigger my T levels to kick in and begin increasing...I am not sure why I felt a huge difference between the first and second month of taking the pills.,M,38,3  months0.25 2X W,5/23/2013Email,Dostinex

51, 3, pituitary macroadenoma,I have been taking this med for about a year now. I was diagnosed with a pituitary macroadenoma that was over 5cm. My prolactin level was 1900 before surgery. 90 percent of the tumor was removed they could not reach it all because it would have killed me it is wrapped around my Carotid artery. So after the surgery they put me on this med it started making me sick and has caused many other side effects like feeling weak or tired_ loss of appetite_ rapid weight loss_ headache_ depressed mood_ nausea_ vomiting_ stomach pain_ gas_ indigestion_ constipation and feelings of anger. At this point I have no other choice if I do not take this medication my surgeon and all my doctors said the tumor would grow back in 2 years or less and it would kill me. I really would like to hear from more people about their experiences with med and if anyone is having all the same side effects as me. I feel as if I am going crazy because I either die or feel horrible forever cause I can never stop taking it. ,,M,23,1  years,5/7/2013Email,Dostinex

57, 5, Pituitary macroadenoma,None really to speak of that I can attribute to Dostinex,Firstly_ I was fortunate to find out that I had a pituitary macroadenoma; a routine MRI found it_ as I was asymptomatic. I was luckily able to avoid surgery and was started on Dostinex. My side effects could be attributed to the fact that my high prolactin level of 4000 killed my testosterone level completely. Have been taking weekly testo injections for the past year to compensate and that could be what is causing my increase in appetite and aggressive moods. Just did bloods and my prolactin level is now at 600 and dropping_ so I would say Dostinex is definitely helping.

I was finally diagnosed about 2 months ago with a very high prolactin level a little over 3000. I had an MRI done about 1 month after it showed an macroadenoma 2cm x 3cm. I have been taking the medicine and can already feel a HUGE DIFFERENCE!! I have labs this thursday and cant wait to see what my levels are at now! My sex drive has started to slowly increase_ my energy night and day difference_ my motivation went from wanting to lay down on the couch and exhausted after 8pm most of the day to exercising 3-4 times a week and still perky at 10 and 11 pm at night. EATING HABITS A HUGE KEY FACTOR!! I went from trying to eat right to living it. My wife the angel that she is got us stated in GREEN SMOOTHIES_ 60%fruit 40% veggies. I have never felt better. It the RAW diet_ there's a family that lived in my home town that taught us a lot about eating correctly and my life has improved significantly. I would say that's why I have probably not had huge side affects like most people have bc I was willing to change my diet.

Reduced diplopia in both eyes quite a bit_ although I traded that off for worse vision.  Still that was a benefit because you can't get glasses for spastic diploplia (each episode lasting about 2 to 4 hours).Felt 100% better in about 3 days already.

Down to 3 times a day versus 6.Gave me a great lift.I am almost a senior so I couldn't take it in the full dose because that kept me awake for 48 hours at a time.  That's why it was reduced.  It also made my heart beat faster which was great because I had bradycardia_ possible LVH (EKG said) and extreme irregularities when it got too slow.  So as far a I was concerned_ it's these tumours that cause LVH and not Cabergoline.Didn't do a t,"Got off of the Cabergoline.  Violent reaction first few weeks.  Worse than getting off of a drug like Paxil.  Very violent depression.  Felt awful instantly.  Broke out in massive uncontrollable sweats!  Started sleeping more.  Started getting violent spasms in muscles from hip to toe - very violent!  From one I was crawling for several days_ and others I was sore for several days from less painful charlie horses.   My body didn't like quitting this drug at all!   Heart started getting too slow and irregular again at night.  After three weeks overcame major depression but was still in some depression for next three months with odd bout of severe depression.  Started on Cabergoline again.

After being on bromocriptine and the nausea that came with that drug_ it was a relief.,There are lawsuits surrounding this drug at present and I think people are scapegoating this drug. I was on it for 15 years_ so I was one of the earliest users of this drug for prolactinoma. Prior to this drug I was on bromocriptine and that drug caused me terrible nausea. Cabergoline supposedly causes impulse control issues like gambling_ high sex drive_ etc in certain people. My doctor never had a patient with these problems and I certainly never experienced them.

My prolactin level is 40 w/o meds_ and that is high enough for me to miss periods.  Also_ I have extreme difficulty sleeping when my prolactin is elevated.  I also had extremely painful periods (cramps so bad I couldn't leave the house) for 11 yrs prior to my diagnosis_ and still for 5 years after I started the meds. Now they are pretty much pain free but I don't credit the meds_ just increased age and a much improved_ plant-based diet.  With cabergoline (they don't make the brand name_ Dostinex_ anymore) my prolactin is usually around a 5_ but since the generic came out it doesn't seem to be working as well and the side effects are more pronounced. Junk. I take the smallest possible dose to keep my period regular and make sure I am sleeping.  HOWEVER_ the drug has problems. The side effects are consistent and have not gone away after 10 years of use.  I feel hung over for 24 to 48 hours after my weekly dose (I used to take it 2x/wk_ but due to the side effects_ I'm down to 1x/wk with my doc's approval).  On Dostinex_ I require a LOT of sleep_ 8-10 hours at night and often a long nap during the day.  It is very disruptive to a productive life.  When I first started taking it years ago_ I had increased sex drive_ but after about 6-12 months it went away (so those of you on it only a few months_ don't expect it to last).

87, 4, High Prolactin,This is my second posting on this drug_ only noticeable side effect now is tiredness and that hungover feeling. It has brought the levels down to normal.I posted again because i have noticed a complete change in my personality since taking this drug_ which is confusing as i had mental health issues such as depression and panic attacks before starting it but they got worse after_ i now do things totally out of character. My doctor says its not the medication that made me this way and even if it was i would still have to take the medication anyway. Just wondered if anyone else felt like this_ that their personality changed. Medication still working and i am slowly adjusting to my new personality.,,F,35,19  months0.5mg 1X W,11/24/2010Email,Dostinex

89, 5, ,Extreme tiredness_ almost comatose sleeping in random places.  Weight loss_ and abnormal emotional reactions (almost unemotional),After having 1st baby at 18_ i was without period for 2 years and even after breastfeeding ceased i was secreting milk_ i also found it hard to lose weight. after failure to conceive i was diagnosed with a 5mm tumour hormone level 800.  I was given dostinex 1 x a week and within 5 weeks had my period back. After 8 weeks i fell pregnant again (unknowingly) and thus continued taking dostinex fro 4 more weeks.  After vomiting non stop for about two weeks and no period realised i was pregnant and stopped dostinex. I was still very sick for about 6 weeks which was when the dostinex cleared out of my system. I was monitored very closely during pregnancy and had a perfectly normal baby.Now after 4months of breastfeeding am back on dostinex now 2x a week because hormones level are at 5000. have only been back on for 1 1/2 weeks.  So far very tired.,F,21,13  weeks 2X W,11/20/2010Email,Dostinex

92, 1, Prolactinoma,I have no control over the way I feel.I can be happy for a few hours or a day_ Then fall into pieces and cry.Sad and depressed with the slightest thing bothering me.I give importance to what I shouldnt .I am angry with people and when I am not sad I am not.Sad memories keep me crying.Anything negative hurts meNoises have made me so upset.I shake.Headaches.Fatigue.Wake up wet with sweat.Upset stomach.Near blackouts.Irrational conclusions and behavior.Inability to make dependable decisionsUnable to concentrate.I forget things- its like having a cloth between me and what I want to remember.I just cannot handle ANYTHING.I feel desperate and so dependent .I have lost eagerness- Nothing interests me.I know who I was and I feel like I am going crazy not being that person,For the longest time I thought it was ME trying to cope with life- but after research about cabergoline and a modest reassurance from my doctors_ I believe I have been horribly affected by cabergoline. I can't cope.I hate waking up.For a long while I couldn't even sleep.I can't function. I just get angry so suddenly by the slightest thing.My mind reels around sad thoughts and sad memories.I don't trust my own judgement anymore.Things (that should be easy) are just absolutely impossibly difficult.I woke up drenched the other night.I've had near blackouts.I feel like...I try to swim up and out of the water to get air to find that there IS NO AIR.This is so scary because it is not tangible! it is a feeling of complete_ sad_ emptiness.I should have filled gallons with tears by now. I shake.I lost over 30lbs.Everything is a blur.Remembering is such a task.It's like having a veil in front of your eyes that keeps you from the real world. My rationale is gone! I have never felt so horrible in my life. I was taken off the medication on Aug/8th. I still feel these effects_ although the intensity is less and less (after 7 weeks I am still very sad).I am scheduled for surgery in Nov because I refuse to try Parlodel or antidepressants. I just want to be normal again and capable and independent and HAPPY.I am now trying to find out as much as I can about the medication and surgery_ and anything related to short or long lasting side effects of both.  ,F,29,3  years.5 mg 2X W,9/27/2010Email,Dostinex

Tumor is still a Macro but has been on the Micro/Macro border for many years.Some important stuff I've gleaned from many doctors:-the high prolactin level and Dostinex can cause or worsen Depression.-Depression is treated with Dopamine inhibitors and Dostinex is a Dopamine antagonist_ rendering treatment for Depression_ ineffective at best.,F,33,13  years0.5 mg 1X W,8/26/2010Email,Dostinex
96, 3, Pituitary Tumour,Before: unbearable migraines_ loss of menstruation_ breasts enlarged_ depression_ loss of libido_ obscure dreams. After: migraines disappeared_ menstrual cycle returned but severe cramps now and can last 2 weeks_returned libido_ wake up in the mornings after taking it feeling terribly weak_ obscure dreams_ sleeplessness.,I'm not 100% sure what symptoms are actually related to the tumor and the dostinex or what's just me. I can't properly remember the details i think it was 1cm with prolactin 2000 or 3000. The first mri i got was distorted because of my braces and the second was only last year which showed slight reduction. Dostinex worked wonders it brought the prolactin down to 200 i think within a month and my agonizing headaches were cleared up quickly. The only major issue i've had is the painful and heavy mensuration that's crippling once a month. Origionally i was on 5gm twice a week but within the first 6months this was reduced to once a week because i couldn't handle taking two weeks off every month! I've been on it over 2 years now and everythings been going well but in the last weeks my breasts have began to swell and lactate and my headaches are returning. I'm rather worried that the medicine is no longer working but is that even possible? I would greatly appreciate any feedback on this.,F,20,2  years.5mg 1X W,8/10/2010Email,Dostinex
97, 5, prolactinoma,The first dose made me very tired the next morning_ felt like a hangover_ but nothing else. After one month i was fully adjusted to it_ no more side effects_ maybe mildly more tired the morning after i take it. My prolactin dropped from 300 to 18 in one month! on half a pill a week. Fantastic result. And i lost 5 pounds. I am very active all the time and over the last 2 years i had these couple of extra pounds i could not lose_ and i have a strong suspicion it was the high prolactin. The weight dropped off as soon as my levels went back to normal. Also_ improved sex drive (husband happy!).,worked great for me. My doctor said that for women that suffer nausea etc_ it can be taken vaginally - so those of you that have more side effects may want to check in with your doctor.,F,34,2  monthshalf a pil 1X W,8/9/2010,Dostinex

Has reduced levels down to around normal for a man_ but I am convinced it is playing havoc with my mood and mental well-being. Plus sides include severe weight loss so I am now down to my target weight_ more energy. I was also prescribed this with testosterone replacement so not sure if that has played a part on my weird moods. Get very angry_ then anxious to the point of shaking.

I've seen 2 different endocronoligists and a neurologist.

And I wasn't eating b/c I've been so nauseus! I keep having burning sensation in my chest(kind of heartburn).  My endo ran more test yesterday on my pituitary and to check my prolactin levels since I've been on the medicine. Won't get the test results back until July 1st.

Prolactin level at diagnosis was 14_750 which reduced to 4_500 within 12 days on the lowest dose. It's since reduced to 450 at last test having been on 500Mg twice per week. Sight tests also improving so I hope that means the tumour is shrinking too.I have had some side effects - constipation and feeling groggy the day after taking dose. Also find my energy levels in the evening plummet - hardly surprising though if my body is fighting to get better and a small price to pay for the results it produces.

I just can't handle the raging libido when I'm completely stressed about my job. Now I'm taking half of the prescribed dosage each week. Based on the comments I've read here_ I'm beginning to wonder if Dostinex can cause or reduce depression or anxiety. I have noticed my mood has improved since going back on on the generic of Dostinex.,It's far better than Bromocriptine and it works. My 2008 MRI and labs & early 2009 labs were good.

124, 5, hyperprolactinemia_ microadenoma,slight dizziness,I took dostinex after being diagnosed with a microadenoma and slightly high levels of prolactin (34). This level in itself was stopping me from ovulating_ although I had anovulatory cycles with periods.I took this back in 2008 and got my periods a month later. I got pregnant during that first cycle and went on to have a healthy pregnancy - unfortunately it ended badly because our little girl had a genetic disease that we found out about at 36 weeks.... We are now ready to try again_ but when I started taking dostinex immediately after childbirth_ my levels did not come down as fast. 10 weeks after childbirth_ my levels are at 31_ I had hoped that the effect would have been the same as before the pregnancy and that the levels would be down around 20 by now if not lower. My endocrinologist is stumped. We have increased the dose from two half tablets a week to one and a half tablets a week to see if that works.

132, 5, Micro Prolactinoma,Extremely high sex drive. I found myself constantly thinking of my wife and feeling a need to have sexual intercourse. It turned me into an animal basically_ always thinking about her_ always wanting her. I did have quite a few other side effects as well_ nowhere near as beneficial as my sex drive. I would have instant angry feelings_ about the most trivial of things. I would just be angry for no reason at all_ the slightest thing would irritate me. I would also lose concentration so easily. I found I couldnt focus on anything for long_ except obviously my wife and having sex with her. I do experience alot of fatigue_ I find myself tired far more than I was before I started this drug. My stomach does have issues being upset more than it used to be as well. The drug is very effective as it has reduced the tumor and kept it from growing back. The side effects can be wonderful if you can identify them early on and learn how to handle them. That is kind of a reason I am here_ I really wasn,All and all_ I would just say make sure both you and your spouse are well aware of the side effects so that you both understand what is going on and she can help you recognize the bad effects as they are happening_ instead of thinking there is something seriously wrong with you_ or worse_ taking it personally. AS far as the sexual desires_ I dont think there are many wives that would be against that from their spouse_ especially far into their relationship when things have a tendency to slow down. My wife has two children_ and I still find her the most beautiful and attractive woman on earth. I cant get enough of her! This drug could really mess things up if you arent aware of the side effects_ if you arent in a strong relationship_ I could see how cheating would be an issue_ I definately see how the anger flashes are a problem_ the lack of focus_ the lack of concentration_ the irritability_ the sleeping patterns_ insomnia_ the stomach issues. As long as you know to deal with them_ then this is a wonderful cure for these types of tumors.,M,39,9  years,10/23/2009,Dostinex
133, 1, Macroprolactinoma,Sexual addiction_ sexual compulsion_loss of focus_ loss of concentration_ complete change in personality,Where to begin? I have a 2cm x 2cm x 2cm Macroprolactinoma. Started out with Dostinex in 2005 and switched to generic in mid 2006. Noticed a change from the generic. Starting in 2005 I became addicted to internet porn. Now in 2009 I finally had a sexual affair and I don't feel in control of myself due to sexual compulsion and addiction. I have hit rock bottom because my partner of 17 years caught me in that affair. I want to quit cabergoline but the alternative [bromocryptine] is even worse.  Does anyone know of an alternative to dostinex and bromo or something to take with the dostinex to control the sexual addiction? Please let me know by email.,M,42,4  years,10/9/2009Email,Dostinex
134, 4, high prolactin level,The first day after I take Doxtinex it feels like I have the flu. I have to stay in bed because my head hurts so badly. I have a decreased sex drive_ stuffy nose_ occasional headaches_ weight gain_ constant constipation_ and feel tired all of the time.,I started with Parlodel and was able to become pregnant.The initial side effects were horrific. I took Dostinex throughout my second pregnacy and had a healthy baby girl. The only problem was that I could not breast feed because I didn't go off of the medicine soon enough. I have tried to go off of the Dostinex_ but my prolactin levels always rise and then I have to start all over again.  I do take birth control pills because they seem to keep everything regular. I take Seasonique because with them I only have a period four times year and the week I get my period there are pills with somehwhat of a hormone that doesn't just drop me cold turkey.  When I take regular birth control pills I have horrific headaches during the week I'm off and having a period.  I am tired all of the time and it is extremely difficult to lose any weight. I do have bouts of anger over nothing in particular and I'm glad to read that it is a symptom most of us share. It does pass_ but at least now I can sum it up to having this problem rather than I'm losing my mind.  I would reccommend to anyone who is trying to become pregnant that they find a reproductive endocronologist because they specialize in this area. I take .5 of a pill twice a week and my prolactin is now at a zero. After reading all of your comments I might try reducing my dose to see if my symptoms become less. I'm not sure I can cut that already small pill any smaller_ but I will definitely try.  Good luck to all of you and remember to a,F,38,14  years,9/27/2009,Dostinex

138, 2, prolactinoma,more sleepy than usual_ irritability_ dizzyness and confusion_ shorter memory_ severe bloating and tight stomach_ mild constipation_ restless legs at night_ increased sensitivity both physically and emotionally (didnt want to be touched).  Increased acne compounded by cystic Acne.,Was diagnosed with 5mm pituitary tumor 9 months ago. Levels in November were 90.  Went on dostinex @ .5mg 2x/week and experienced many side effects. By February prolactin levels were down to 50. But by april they were up to 65 and by august they were up to 75. By this time I had not been experienceing side effects quite as severe and for a short while_ my sex drive even went up a bit but then went back down. I moved and got a new doctor who incresed my dosage to 1.5mg 2x/week because of the apparant resistance to the old dosage.  Now I am experiencing side effects all over again.   I really hate the way I feel on this drug and really hope that this new dosage will do the trick because I cant imagine going on a higher dosage.     I am 30 and would like to have a baby but aparantly Im not even ovulating yet because my cycles are still not on track according to my doctor.  The shortest has been 34 days but most of them are between 40 and 55 days long.  Another thing... I have always had trouble with acne_ but it got worse closer to when the hyperprolactinemia was diagnosed_ then after I went on Dostinex_ it got the worst it has ever been in my life...

I finally had to make the transition to cabergoline generic_ which I am not as comfortable with_ but couldn't find any more branded after the recall.  My tumor is very small_ not even a centimeter_ but the effects of it were still very obvious to me_ including the weight gain_ hyper prolactin production_ and breast cysts.  All of these symptoms have been controlled with Dostinex and I am down to .25mg/week.  I tried to come off of it all together_ but my prolactin levels began to rise again.

141, 4, Pituitary Adenoma,Shortly after an MRI scan my doctor found a benign pituitary brain tumor because I went in to complain that my breast were leaking in 2003 . Its been 6 years and I am happy to report that my tumor is gone and the side effects were mild but its caused other problems or at least I think its related to my condition. I am not 100% sure if this was because of the tumor or medicine (Dostinex) but for the last 3 to 4 years I have had irregular and very heavy and painful periods that last up to 2 weeks sometimes.  My last doctor's visit stated that I was going through the early stages of menopause and have to get more tests done to confirm these new findings.  Can anyone relate to this because I don't want my chances of having more children over and/or God forbid a hysterectomy. I also not allowed to stop taking Dostinex until they can determine what is wrong with me now.  Again can anyone relate?,,F,33,6  years,6/24/2009Email,Dostinex

Tumor has shrunk. Prior to medication_ side effects of tumor were: High Blood Pressure_ which my endocrinologist refused to believe was related; proved him wrong_ High Prolactin levels caused me to lactate! blood sugar levels were erratic.

145, 4, microprolactinoma,Side effects..hmmm. I have been on this medication for almost 14 years and I haven't really experienced many side effects. Headaches. My symptoms from the tumor decreased so its a blessing!,When I was first diagnosed I was 14 years old. I was first put on Parlodel and it was HORRIBLE! Finally_ I seen an endocronologist who gave me Dostinex. In the beginning it was so expensive and it had went down some when the generic version Cabergoline came out. But I have to make sure I always have insurance because I can not afford the meds without it. When I started taking this I had never had a period and it took till I was 21 to finally have one. I was told I would never have children and at 22 I got pregnant. Yay!! This medication has done wonders for me. If your doctor tells you that you can't have children because of this_ I say challenge them. Stay on top of your prolactin levels and MAKE the doctors increase your dosage until YOU feel right. We know our bodies_ NOT the doctors. You pay them to make you better and stay on top of them until they do. Feel free to email me. I have been through it all with this medication.

At first I lost a ton of weight and then I became very strong. There are some very weird_ unexplainable side effects_ an anomaly. I make other people excited by my mere presence or when I look at people. One of the girls I dated said that it looked like sexuality would come out of my pores. Its like pheromones or something like that.I have no idea what the heck is going on. Do you know why the original manufacturer stopped making the drug?

My sex drive is back to normal_ which is great!  However_ I am experiencing a total lack of interest in my job.  I don't care if I complete tasks or do a good job.  This issue is really causing me some grief as I am constantly scrambeling to keep my head above water.  These problems all began 10 years ago when I was diagnosed with the pituitary tumor and prescribed dostinex.  When switched to the generic version_ cabergoline_ the problems got worse.  I take .5 mg twice a week.,M,56,8  years,11/24/2008,Dostinex

My dr. said I only need to be on this .5 twice a week dosage for a few more mos and then we'll cut down. So I will stick it out.

I became a different person on this. I became extremely fatigued (went from working out 5-6 days a week to none at all)_ major mood swings and aggression_ just the every day task of living became unbearably hard-not a good thing when you have a husband and two young children (age 4yr and 1 yr) to take care of. It took me 4 long weeks to figure out it was the medicine that was making me feel so bad and I immediately stopped.

Now on quite high dose (1mg per day) and not noticing too many ill effects. Obviously worried about heart valves on this dose but cant live without libido any longer :( so will take the risk!,Drug has been somewhat successful. It has lowered PRL down from 9000 mul (450 US measurement) to 3500 mul (175 US) in 11 months. Libido not returned yet but then PRL is far from normal. I seem to be taking forever to normalise PRL.

When I stopped taking it (just thought I was normal again I guess)_ I had all my symptoms back in 6 weeks. ( NO periods_ milking breats_ you get the picture). And Endo told me Bromo was from the Dark Ages and suggested Dostinex. Well. Yes Dostinex works for what it is intended_ but I often feel like a crazy person and have outrageous mood swings and feel very aggressive. I am usually peaceful. I have been told pregnancy can ""cure"" this condition. I am sorry most of you are suffering_ but in a way I'm glad because I don't feel so alone like no one understands.

One pill twice a week. On rare occasion I have stuttered. I repeat questions sometimes_ experience forgetfulness and lose focus_ but I don't know if it's from the medicine or the condition as I think I experienced those just before I began the medicine.

181, 5, Pituitary macroadenoma,In the beginning_ I had palpitations for a few days when my dose was increased from once a week to twice a week.  I also had hallucinations when I closed my eyes to go to bed_ but that was likely due to optic nerve compression.  Other than that_ I have been on it for 7 years with no ill effects whatsoever.,The Dostinex shrank my tumor enough (prolactin levels of 6600 to start_ 11 currently) to surgically remove_ and has kept the tumor from coming back since the surgery in 2002.

I went for tests again 5 months after i stopped the drug and the prolactin had risen to 250 again. I went for more tests last week and i have a fear it has increased again.

I was started on Dostinex over 10 years ago_ and I refuse to ever go back on the others.  My diagnosis is unclear; I had very high prolactin_ but it was dubious whether there was actually a tumor on MRI.When I started on dopa agonists_ I noticed that I slept SO well for the first 6 months or so_ then could not sleep at all. (Thank God for Ambien and Sonata!)  I am currently weaning down to only 1/4 of a 0.5 mg tab twice weekly; continue to have R breast discharge_ but apparently have to live with it.  The cost is insane in the US_ and without insurance_ I have to do the best I can.   Personally_ my emotions have been MUCH more manageable on cabergoline.  My life was much worse without it.  If I am not consistent with my dosing_ I will get symptoms of menopause and mood swings.,F,40,12  years,6/1/2008,Dostinex

When I switched from the brand name version to a generic I had a terrible response. I had to try three generics before I found one that worked as well as the original.

I have been on it for almost 2 months and my prolactin level has gone down about 10 points.  It does cause severe laziness and I get pretty sleepy on days that I take it.  But it gets slightly better the day after_ until I have to take it again.  I only take half a pill two times a week.  I am a little worried about having to take it for the rest of my life_ off and on.  But if it means my health or being alert and unhealthy_ I'll take it!  Please do NOT continue dosage while being pregnant.... big problem!  My headaches are still there often_ but not as bad as before taking the medication.  Although I am starting to feel pressure at the bottom of my throat_ like someone has their hands around it - but no problems breathing or swallowing.

I had constant leaking_ extremely painful breasts as well as other problems that both a breast specialist and a supposed ""top"" endocrinologist pretty much dismissed as ""hormonal problems"" post-pregnancy. My elevated prolactin level was discovered but seemed to be disregarded as it was just under 1000 so they kept sending me for blood tests every 6 months to ""keep an eye on it"".  It was only after I saw a new GP last year that I was referred to a different endo who could not believe I'd lived with constant breast pain_ low libido and mild depression for so many years without being given any help.

I am waiting for my 6 month check up to find out. I can tell you though it really does give me bad mood swings. I get upset over the smallest things and I relized I am more aggressive now. I hope it is all worth it. I was really hoping that Cabergoline would help me shed some of those opounds I gained with my elevated prolactin levels_ but It really has not helped that situation.

201, 3, pituitary tumor high prolactin,My tumor is just over a centimeter_ I was diagnosed after unsuccessfully trying to find out why I wasn't getting periods for the last 6 years! Eventually a new doctor took an interest_ MRI & blood tests discovered a prolactinoma tumor. I had thought my headaches were stress based_ but well... apparently not. Side effects: very dizzy (strange sensation of my brain floating around in my head!)_ nauseous_ almost constant headache_ exhausted_ inability to think clearly. I cant move quickly or pick up things from the floor_ look up etc or drive for the first few days then it gets better. Day after medication is like a bad hangover (without being thirsty)_ side effects subside as the week goes on and are getting less severe as the weeks go by (Im in my 4th week).,The hardest is being so worn out and unable to think or do much_ I am a manager at work_ & in my spare time I dance_ run and practice yoga but have barely been able to do any of these things since starting the medication but dance on any day I feel ok again. I take one full tablet a week. Im lucky living in Australia as the medication costs are mostly absorbed by the government_ each tablet works out to be less than AUD$4. Wishing you all the very best and may we all feel much better soon. Have you all noticed the side effects decreasing over time?

I started medication with parlodel (could not stand side effects) then went to permax (it was horrible also) and for the last several years have used Dostinex (caberoline.)    It is wonderful compared to the other meds I tried.   I now take it sporadically_ on six months off six months.

Headaches on days when I'm supposed to take the pill.,I've been taking Cabergoline for over a year after discovering Galactorrhea (breast discharge) and elevated prolactin levels of around 60.  Had 2 MRIs and no tumor showed_ but I am not convinced.  I messed up my pills ever slightly just a couple of weeks ago and the discharge came right back.  It's good to know that the pill is working but scary to know I am dependent upon it.  I have been happy with the pill - take 2x/5 mg a week.    Side effects have been mild to questionably existent.  Brought my period back within a month (and my sex drive).  On a side note - has anyone not diagnosed with a tumor ever been taken off the medication to find the prolactin levels stay normal?  My dr said this could happen but again...I'm not convinced in my case.  Would love to hear from you.,F,25,1.3  years,2/11/2008Email,Dostinex

I can't seperate the side effects from the medication from the fact that I have suffered with terrible depression_ anxiety_ and insomnia for many years before taking dostinex,"I was diagnosed with the prolactinoma after I finally went to the doctor because my periods had stopped.  She sent me to the endo and he took some tests.  At the end of the visit he said that it didn't look like it would be anything because I only had some small discharge from my breasts (only after manipulation) and my prolactin level was around 60.  He did say that there is the possibility for a tumour but assured me that he really thought there would be nothing to worry about.  I was sent for an MRI and I had to wait quite a while for him to phone me with the results.  He said that he didn't phone right away because he was so shocked that they had found a large tumour about 1"" if I remember correctly.  I had to have the surgery and had a CSF leak and a bout with low sodium and diabetes insipidus.  Eventually those complications went away_ thank God!  All this happened in 2001.

The pills have helped control my prolactin though I have gone off without success as the prolactin went up very quickly.,M,28,5  years,12/11/2007Email,Dostinex
212, 5, Micro Prolactinoma,Hsven't really had any,I take 0.5mg_ half a tablet twice a week and can't really complain. Haven't had any major side effects that interfere with my school or work.

213, 4, 5mmx7mm prolactinoma,Vertigo_ nausea (a few times a week)_ hives_ upset stomach_ headaches_ extreme and completely insurmountable fatigue,I was terrified when I found out about my prolactinoma. I found this website almost immediately_ so thank you all for posting. After 3 months on dostinex_ my prolactin levels dropped from 125 to less than 0. Hoping that an MRI (scheduled in 3 months) will show that the size has decreased. Overall_ it has forced me to re-think the way I live my life_ eat healthier_ and made my libido skyrocket. Though its very hard to go to the gym_ I try to go_ at least once a week for now. I will keep you posted after the next MRI! To all the new people on this site_ or readers: Please keep reporting back. We have very little information here on what happens after dostinex. Do you have a surge of energy? Does it come back? How does the body adjust?,F,29,9  months,12/10/2007,Dostinex

I have noticed in the last few years that i gained a lot of weight_ and also my sex drive went down. I am now on Dostinex_ and being close to God have also helped me a big deal especially at the begining when I found about it and wasn't sure if it was going to be something worse. I hope the medicine will be effecient and that i won't need to have any surgery. I am having my next check and MRI in 10 days so I ask God to have good results.

217, 3, Macro prolactinoma,How do you work and take this crappy medicine?! Really tired to the point where my eyes hurt_ drink alcohol most nights to fall asleep_ weight gain_ headache.,Been on this med about 2.5 years. My prolactin level was 221. I was normally about size 10_ always super energetic_ worked full-time_ active volunteer_ gym membership_ exercised regularly_ partied regular. I got up to size 14_ and could barely dress myself on 0.5mg twice weekly! Unbelievable! I got my primary to prescribe Meridia and not even a year later I'm down to a 11 or 12. Prolactin level is down to about 30. I got fed up once and stopped taking the Dostinex and felt sooo good! I would actually get sleepy_ naturally_ and sleep all nite. I felt good when I got up for work in the morning. It was just absolutely wonderful. But while the level dropped the tumor has grown and the Endo Doc has increased my dosage to 2 whole pills twice weekly! This is my first week and I feel like me and Jack Daniels have been hanging out till 2 a.m. every nite! Monday my eyes felt like someone had stuck several of their fingers in my eyes and then thrown sand in my face.,F,41,2  years,11/7/2007,Dostinex
218, 4, Prolactinoma,In the first year I was taking 1 pill each day.  YES_ that's correct!  I had head aches_ nausea_ dizziness.  The tumor was not responding.  Because my vision became impaired_ I opt'd for surgery.  Most of the tumor was removed.  The tumor remained around  an artery and pituitary stalk.  I resumed Dostinex.  I now take 1/2 pill each day.  My prolactin level is under control.  Side effects are minor head aches_ poor focus_ depression_ mood swings and my libido is off the chart. I'm divorced now because of all this shit (I'm a nut case;) And before no interest in sex - now after surgery and dostinex_ my sex drive is off the chart) I've also lost a great deal of weight... weight I gained because of high prolactin levels.,I guess all in all_ dostinex is helping.  Prolactin in a man's system sucks big time.  In my case_ I think the effects of high prolactin in my body (a man's body)and the tumor is far worse than the side effects of dostinex.,M,46,4  years,11/1/2007,Dostinex

220, 3, Pituitary tumor & high prolactin,Dizziness_ low sex drive_ nausea if not taken after a meal_ tiredness,I have been on the medication for almost a year now and they have lowered my prolactin level from 6000 to 4400 at the last appointment which was over 3 months ago. I started taking the medication after finding out my prolactin level was high and after an MRI finding out I had a pituitary tumor. The medication is doing it's job in reducing my prolacin level_ the tumor itself hasn't been checked since I started the medication. I am suffering with the side effects though and will possibly ask for a review of the dose.,M,26,1  years,10/25/2007,Dostinex

I had my surgery in April 2007 ... I stopped taking Dostinex in February 2007 after my neurosurgeon (Dr. Kassam at UPMC) told me that I don't have a tumor but a CYST on my pituitary glen_ therefore Dostinex will not work (the only way to cure a cyst is w/ a surgery) .... SO today I went for my 3rd check up after the surgery and my prolactin is going down on its own with out the help of any medication!!!  In August 2007 my prolactin was at 150_ and right now it went down to 100.  My endo and I had a conference call with my surgeon and they have decided to wait and 'see' what happens ... I have to come back for another blood work in 3 months.  Hopefully my prolactin will be near the normal level.I'm so happy.... The surgery was NOT SO BAD.  Dr. Kassam is my hero!  ... I am so happy I don't have to take Dostinex and deal with all of the horrible side effects.,F,28,11  years,10/19/2007Email,Dostinex

223, 5, Prolactinoma,Nausea and vertigo,This drug has been good for me ... my prolactin levels have dramatically dropped ... I can live with the side effects.  I take .5mg X2 a week - buy the bottles with 8 pills in them.  If you are paying an arm and a leg_ consider a trip to Korea to buy some!  I pay the full_ unsubsidised cost of the drug and it costs me $USD 17.00 a month - compared to around $USD 290 in the USA.  SOmeone is making a lot of money.  I think you could fly to Korea_ see a doctor and pick up a years supply cheaper than buying it in the USA!  Just a thought!,F,37,6  months,10/15/2007,Dostinex

He wants me to do 1/2 pill_1/2 pill then full pill_1/2 pill until I reach the max dose of 3 pills_ 3pills. My tumor is 5cm by 4.9 by 4.7cm. It protrudes and wraps around the carotid. I found this by accident. I gained alot of weight in 5 years and my sex drive went down 3 years ago. My prolactin is over 5000 and my testorne is at 48. Unable to have children the last 8 years. I went to a weightloss doctor and he he found abnormal prolactin levels and low test. I am very confident in that this medication will work. Ive read so many + stuff. Getting close to GOD and Dostinex I know my tumor will shrink and my levels will go down. I go in Dec for a follow up blood work. I will let everyone know how it goes.

Need Dostinex_ where can I get it after the recall?,I need to take Dostinex to ovulate to become pregnant. I am almost 42 and running out of time. The recall was very bad timing. I have been off and on Parlodel which like others makes me sick in all the ways mentioned including almost passing out and heart palpatations. High prolactin for 24 years.

Is this familiar to anyone else here?,"I love this medication!  After 7 or 8 years of increasingly hopeless degeneration--weight gain_ irritability_ loss of libido_ all of which I attributed to aging--I feel like I have my old life back_ and then some!  After 6 months at .5 mg twice weekly (of Cabergoline)_ my testosterone levels are back to normal_ I've lost 20 pounds and gained muscle tone_ working out to greater effect at the gym than ever before.  I feel sexy and confident (and love the spontaneous complements).  Sex is once again profoundly satisfying_ easy_ and long-lasting.  All parts of my body seem more sensitive to pleasure.  In fact_ I'm now developing all kinds of kinks I never expected I would! (I have read that some people on Dostinex/Cabergoline actually complain that it unearthed problems with compulsive gratification-seeking in things like gambling or other addictive behaviors...fortunately that's not me).

231, 3, Micro Prolactinoma,equilibrium is off_ sinus congestion_ head ache_ nausea_ and fatigue.,In 1991 I started on Parlodel and thought I was going to go insane and the doctors told me that the shooting pains in my brain were not a side effect of the meds. I stopped taking it for years. Then a doc put me on permax_ still made me miserable. Finally in 1997 an Endo at Duke put me on Dostinex 0.5mg weekly. I took it off/on for years. Weight went up without the meds and down with the meds. I was able to get pregnant in 2004. Tumor is down from 10mm to 4mm and levels are down for 150s to 20s. However_ lactation is still occurring. Increasing meds to 0.5 twice weekly to get levels closer to Zero with hopes to stop lactation. The generic version is making the side effects much worse. Going to attempt to get non-generic again. Also_ current Endo was concerned with me not taking the meds. She said it could cause issues with other hormones and cause osteoperosis later in life along with other long term issues from not having normal hormone levels.,F,35,10  years,9/16/2007Email,Dostinex
232, 4, Macro Prolactinoma,Mood swings at first_ but made many positive changes. Also restless and increased insomnia slightly.,I saw people asked if they successfully stopped taking it and the tumor failed to come back...my answer is no. I stopped taking it 2 years ago_ and it returned. After my last MRI in 2005 there was no signs of it and my levels were below 5. Now it has returned entirely and I will be taking it again. The medication is great_ it's just not a permanent cure if you ask me.,M,29,6  years,9/13/2007Email,Dostinex

I developed the WORST migraine/TIA attack within a week. This endo and another endo claim they never heard anyone else complain of this side effect but it happened to me.

The biggest problem for me currently is sleeping I really have no routine.I also have high blood-pressure so sometimes it varies from very high to very low.Taking my dostinex currently on a sunday_ then it is saver to drink some alchohol on the weekends and still be able to enjoy weekends being a student at the same time.

Such as lactating breasts_ years without a menstrual cycle_ horrible daymares (nightmares that occur while I am awake)_ change in hair texture (thinning out immensely)_ high libido as well as low libido_ and just absolute depression. My weight has gone down significantly since taking the dostinex 15 years ago.,Here is what I have to say about the drug..it seems to be the only one that works for me. I have been taking it for years off/on. Some Doctors have spoken to me about surgery_ where as others have said that even if your tumor gets to be the size of an apple never have surgery. So it just depends on your own choices. I have an MRI every year_ an eye exam every year_ and lab work every 90 days. Most nurses or Docs are not even remotely aware of what to do...so just do what you think is right for you. If you're on it for elevated prolactin I am sure you'll be taking it for life off/on...perhaps constantly but I truly don't recommend it. Just be on a constant watch of your levels. Normally I know more than my Docs usually do...and I have seen many of them in all areas of the U.S. (military),F,37,15  years,7/30/2007Email,Dostinex

Also watch the booze consumption. I drank one small glass of wine and became completely drunk. Couldn't even stand up!,When the main manufacturer stopped making the drug I had to try one of the many generics. The first one was terrible. Headaches_ sedation etc. Tried another manufacturer and I'm back to normal. My sex drive is incredible now and my prolactin level which was 172 is now 18 which is normal.

However_ when the doctor upped the dosage to .75mg/2X's week to get the levels under 75. I started to have chest pains. He scheduled an echo (awaiting results) I'm back to .5mg  I would like to know from anyone out there with prolactinoma_ what dosage took your levels under 10?

245, 5, pituitary tumor,I had everything that most entries have had. Dizziness_ spurts of anger_ visions issues and crappy doctors. I had no insurance when I was diagnosed with a 10 year old tumor. Three took most of my money and screwed me with the I do know crap. Then I found out and waited a year for surgery which they screwed up at Strong hospital. The only person telling it straight was a retiring endrocrin doc. I have been on the cabergoline for almost 15 years. I pay cash and when the one company stopped making it I found another and it's a bit cheaper. My energy levels are down but that a small price to pay for fucked up medical health care in this country. Cabergoline is all that keeps me alive. It will end my life soon than if I had continued to smoke years ago. It has been hard on my life because I don't look sick_ so I must be fibbing. Never stop fighting folks. There are thousands of us out here and I can relate my tumor to when I worked in a laser lab that had no EMI shielding.,,M,51,14  years,6/5/2007,Dostinex

247, 4, elevated prolactin,Dostinex brought my prolactin levels right down but since I've been taking Cabergoline I've had many of the side effects described by others but one thing I have not seen in the various comments I've read is an answer to the 50 lb. weight gain_ loss of sex drive_ and tired beyond belief.  I FINALLY FOUND THE ANSWER!!!! After going to several other endocrinologists one tested me for lack of Human Growth Hormone and I was producing none.  With correction of that I am feeling much better.  I don't know that it will apply to many but if it helps just one of you what a blessing.,HAVE OTHER HORMONES CHECKED.

248, 5, Yes,Minimal,"In May of 2005_ I started to take Dostinex due to lack of menstruation for over a year.  After numerous blood tests_ the doctors found that I had high prolactin level. I had an MRI taken_ but there was no tumor.  The doctors said the elevated prolactin level was ""idiopathic"" meaning that they didn't know why my levels were elevated.   After 3 months of taking Dostinex_ I got one period_ and became pregnant.  My husband and I weren't even ""trying"" so to speak.  Because I was unaware that I was pregnant_ I continued taking the medication the first 6 weeks of the pregnancy.  After I found out that I was pregnant_ I stopped taking it.  A year ago May 5th_ I had a healthy baby boy.  I was initially worried that the Dostinex may have affected the baby_ but it didn't.  I just picked up a new prescription of Cabergoline today because I have not had a period since the baby was born.

I had no sex drive and was having trouble maintaining an erection_ low energy_ and my once very athletic body had slowly lost a considerable amount of muscle mass and put on 15 lbs. of fat.  At one month of being on generic Dostinex my prolaction levels dropped to 35!_ at 2 months it was at 13_ and at three months it's at 9.  My testosterone has moved up to 224_ still low.  My sex drive is back to normal and I have no problem maintaining erections.  I've lost 8 lbs. and have started putting on muscle again and feeling more athletic.  The turn around is fantastic.

Many side effects_ see other posting.I have been on Dostinex for many years with little or no side effects until about 2 years ago.

I have called the company repeatedly and no one knows what the real story is and when it will become available again. One story I heard was that the little packet that is placed in the bottle with the pills_ was not controlling humidity and affecting the shelf life. Tired of waiting over 6 months for an honest answer about availability_ I finally wrote a letter to the CEO of Pfizer and said ""GET REAL"" - if this is the problem why are there millions of other little pills in bottles_ through the world_ that do not have a problem with humidity.

Now_ I have only been taken the drug for couple of days so can't really say anything about the effects. My  main complaint is the absence of the libido which is destroying my life.

I feel lightheaded and drowsy.,positive effects are a little less sleepless nights_ return of libido and feeling less depressed. I'm still very easily over-emotional about sentimental stuff. next week I will have my prolactine level checked. if this dosage also doesn't get the prolactine down_ I see no point in taking this dosage any longer.

Pfizer voluntarily recalled all the Dostinex in the US in 04/06 and has no statement about if/when they will sell it again.  Their public statement is that they could not guarantee the potency & purity of the product through the shelf life.   (??) I also spoke with Pfizer and Pfizer Canada.  They are still selling it everywhere outside the US.  Only the generic made by Par Pharmaceutcals that just got FDA approcal 01/06 is now sold in the US.

Its too much of a coincidence that these problems would begin after the switch. Of course_ I can't get the name brand since it seems to have been recalled.

Dostinex leveled me out again - I was happy_ energetic_ sexual_ completely normal both physically and mentally.  I had the strength to turn my life around.  It took a constant dose of 3 pills 2x a week to maintain that but I had no troublesome side effects.  Since Dostinex was recalled in April I've been on the Par Pharma version of cabergoline and I'm back to square one - a total mess after only 4 mo.  My poor husband is ready to swim the Atlantic for me since we heard it's only been pulled off the market in the US and is still available elsewhere.

353, 3, hyperprolactinemia,some nause_ headache and faintness in th efirst few weeks. they all normalised.,the high prolactin levels of over 3000 went down dramatically to the 50s however just 2 months of not taking the medicine the levels shot up again to over 2000. my period came back after nearly 10 years to a 23-day regular cycle. just last month it delayed for 5 days so i guess it is returning to my normal 28-day cycle 10 years ago. i am hoping ovulation returns and i can get pregnant.,F,39,6  days,1/5/2006,Dostinex
354, 3, Microprolactinoma,The only lasting side effect is nasal congestion.,Six years ago I had a prolactin level of 212 & Testosterone around 157. After several months of Bromocriptine prolactin leveled at 70 while T was up but not normal. Started on Dostinex and normalized everything_ including libido_ in about six months of tweaking the dose topping out at .5mg 5 times per week. My Dr. gradually backed it off and then took it away. Prolactin gradually climbed to about 50 and testosterone gradually declined and so didn't the libido. Back on Dostinex but now .5mg everyday and not the same results. Prolactin is hanging around 40_ testosterone about 350_ libido waxes and wanes but mostly on the low side. Also insurance company is stingy with dispensing with $100 copay for 56 day supply. Dr is stumped as to why this higher dose isn't working this time around. Anyone else experience this?,M,47,6  years,12/12/2005Email,Dostinex

358, 3, High Prolactin; irregular periods,Nausea and headaches.  The nausea is terrible.  I'm taking 0.25 mg twice a week and will be lowering it to once a week in the hopes that it will help with the nausea and headaches,It did a tremendous job of quickly lowering the prolactin level.  Parlodel could only get it down to 50.  Dostinex got it down to 21 in the first month.,F,36,45  days,11/19/2005,Dostinex

360, 4, microadenoma,first it was nausea_ then one day_ very scary...vertigo (felt room spinning) & difficuly balancing on one leg (my balance is normally great).  I was terrified!  It went away within 24h...lately_ feels like my digestion is slow...lots of bloating.,As a dopamine agonist_ its effects on nausea and gut motility are not surprising.  We routinely use meds with anti-dopa to treat PONV (I am an anesthesia trainee)...however_ the nausea made me scared re?pregnancy...and the loss of balance made me think I was getting MS.  However_ the breast discharge which was SOOOO alarming to me is gone and I am staying on the med because I hope all the strange stuff will go away and the adenoma too!!!,F,31,30  days,11/8/2005,Dostinex

362, 2, High Prolactin Level/No Test.,Ever few physical side effects taking the medication for me. Some acne on back.. the first couple of weeks. (and i never get acne) But I have found it to be very reactionary on an empty stomach and alcohol. (two things you are not suppose to do) DO NOT MIX THE THREE.  I turned into a raging and nasty SOB.. last night. (That's why I'm here.. looking for answers) Saying stuff I didn't mean_ and being somewhat abusive to family. Next day... I do not recall the incident or what happened.  I'm probably going to have to stop drinking... even small amounts.  It's not worth the risk of abusing my family.,I've seen very little reversal of my lack of libido. (and it's certainly not my wife.. I love her_ and she's a knock out)  Being taking 0.5mg a week (split in two doses)  I likely won't know if my levels have changed until I get in for more blood tests.,M,45,30  days,10/26/2005,Dostinex

364, 5, Pituitary Tumor/Prolactinoma,No side effects that I can think of. This drug has been a home run for me. I had been diagnosed with a Pituitary tumor/Prolactinoma in my late 20's and first treated it with Parlodel_ to shrink the tumor which it did but Parlodel (unlike Dostinex) also had annoying side effects. Parlodel had made me sensitive to light_ and at times nauseous.,My Doctor recommended Dostinex as an alternative to Parlodel and despite the increased cost_ I was much happier as it continued to control my Prolactinoma and keep my pituitary tumor from returning_ with no apparent side effects. I take one .5 milligrams tablets 2 times per week.,M,45,10  days,10/24/2005,Dostinex

I could not cope with life.  I was crying all the time.  i could not make decisions or think straight.  I became someone else.,Sure it shrank my pituatry tumour and it did get my levels down from 3600 to double figures but it destroyed me as a person and I came off it now after two years I have to find a newer drug.,F,45,2  years,10/10/2005,Dostinex
