0, 1, labor (delivery of child),After switching from morphine_ they added stadol to my IV pump.  I was not allowed an epidural and I had been in labor for over ten hours. The medication gave me hallucinations and paranoia. I thought the nurse was laughing at me and I was having trouble with my vision (focusing/dysplopia).  I do not recall the pain being minimized as I was too scared out of my wits.,,F,42,1  daysIV unknown 1X D,12/27/2010,Stadol preservative free
