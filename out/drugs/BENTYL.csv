0, 3, Severe stomach pain,Dry mouth_ dizziness_ blurred vision_ anxiety_ etc.,I was prescribed bentyl on Saturday after I came out of the ER. I've been having this pain in my stomach for so long and the last time I went to the ER_ they prescribed percocets. Let me just say_ i'd rather be high off of the percocets than bentyl. I literally just took it about an hour ago since I'm at work alone so I'm worried I'll get the pain after I eat. I was literally freaking out about 10 mins ago. I got super dizzy and nauseous. I felt like everything was going in slow motion and felt like I was going to collapse on the floor. I'm pretty sure it gave me anxiety because I felt like I was about to die. I had to call my mom and have her talk to me so I could relax. I started getting customers walking in to my job and I felt like I couldn't keep up a conversation. I don't recommend it but I guess since we're all different_ we won't all have the same side effects. Be careful and make sure you're at home taking it.,F,24,4  days20 mg,7/6/2016,Bentyl
1, 1, Ibs perscription,Side effects are as ppl say..,"I want to comment that this drug has been perscribed ""to my knowlage"" since the 70s-- I was surprised by the medical world that this drug still exists in 2016/ is that how far medicine has come in 45 yrs??  Pathetic don't let ur doc give u something like this_ research ur drugs! My aunt that used to take this ended up with serious psycosematic issues_ and bad ocd",F,45,0  days20mg 3X D,5/7/2016,Bentyl
2, 5, Chronic radiation enteritis,Bentyl has been a life saver for me!  I developed Chronic Radiation Enteritis 2 1/2 years after radiation to the small bowel & chemotherapy. I would have episodes of absolutely to worst pain i have ever felt. My episodes started w severe upper abdominal pain_ then went to 12 hours of vomiting_ nausea_ diarrhea. I would sleep on the bathroom floor_ alternating from so hot that i had to take all of my clothes off_ to freezing. My doc told me to take this drug the minute i felt like it was coming on & then don't eat or drink anything until it is gone. This drug is awesome! It has saved me from at least 2 episodes & significantly lessened another. I don't have any high feeling that some say they experience. I do have dry mouth but i just drink more water. I will take that any day over throwing up all night! I don't leave home without it.,,F,49,4  weeks,4/17/2016,Bentyl
3, 4, diverticulitis,extreme drowsiness,Except for the drowsiness_ this is a miracle drug.  I would get severe diarrhea and nausea/vomiting for days and end up in the er on IV fluids.

Had tried everything Google had to offer to combat ibs_including dieting_ probiotics_ eliminating gluten or dairy_ increasing fiber_ intense excercise...etc... with no relief_ my dr prescribed this bentyl. I don't like the ""high"" feeling because I don't feel completely in control_ but it passed after being on it continuously for two weeks_ and I cut my pills in half instead of taking the full thing every 8 hours like my Dr wanted. I force myself to drink half a gallon of water by noon and another half by 6pm. To make sure I stay hydrated and help with the dry mouth. Sometimes I feel as though I'm not urinating enough for as much water as I'm drinking_ but haven't had any major signs of problems from that so no worries. I only use this medication when my stomach begins hurting. Not as preventative even though I'm directed to. It works for its intended purpose beautifully and have finally after years_ found some sort of relief..",F,29,1  months,1/24/2016Email,Bentyl

18, 3, IBS,"I have been taking Bentyl on and off for the past two years to medicate severe abdominal pain due to IBS. I'm not a fan of this drug AT ALL. I gave it 3 stars because it does alleviate the pain somewhat_ but even a minimal dosage gives me very uncomfortable side effects. There is nausea_ but what even more detrimental for me is dizziness and cognitive malfunction. I feel like I'm in a ""fog""_ I can barely concentrate on any reading material (which is VERY BAD for my work)_ I can't drive (also bad for work!)_ and most weirdly I completely lose my short-term memory - for example; constantly forgetting what I'm talking or thinking about_ forgetting something the second someone tells me_ etc. I can barely even focus enough to watch TV! Sadly real pain medication is hardly ever given to IBS sufferers (""it's all in your head"") so that is what I am stuck with.",,F,31,2  years40 mg 2X AN,5/10/2015,Bentyl

21, 4, Severe abdominal pain_ IBS,Lightheaded_ dizzy_ disoriented_ slowed heart rate_sense of unreality_ fatigue_ lack of coordination_ dry mouth_ trouble breathing_ anxiety,This drug did take away the extreme pain in my upper abdomen within a day. But the cognitive side effects are very troubling. I feel out of my body. Like floating. Have had difficulty speaking_ brain fog and dizziness. My hands and feet feel numb and tingly. Lack of coordination in hands. My heart rate slowed way down. Feel really disconnected. Wake up from sleep with heart racing. Sweating. It gives me anxiety feeling this strange. I really want to keep taking it because my stomach pain was crippling but I can't really function with all these cognitive effects either.,F,51,4  days10mg 4X D,1/20/2015Email,Bentyl

25, 4, metformin side effects,I tend to have quite blurry vision and extreme drowiness for about an hr after taking my dose. I also feel like I am in a mental fog and have short memory lapses every so often during the rest of the day. But_ with how severe my stomach issues on metformin are_ I just make sure to schedule to take it with my metformin an hr before I get up as well as an hr before I go to sleep so i can deal with the side effects at home and sleep the drowsiness and blurred vision off. So if u only need to take it once or twice a day to help this is a pretty perfect drug to keep diarrhea and intestional pain away but if you need a medicine to take throughout the day to help_ it'd probably be a good idea to look for another medicine known to have less cognitive side effects.,,F,22,2  months4 20 mg x2,6/29/2014,Bentyl

A couple days later I noticed pain in my upper abdominal area that kept getting worse. I never had pain like this before taking Bentyl. 2 weeks into the course of meds the pain was so bad I was contemplating going to the ER bc I thought I may have a stomach ulcer or gallstones. I went back to the doctor & was reassured this medication would not cause this side effect & was told to continue taking it. I REFUSED....all my lab tests came back normal & since stopping Bentyl I haven't had the agonizing stomach pain since.

I would begin to sweat and my hands would develop a tremor and after 10-30 minutes_ an extremely painful stabbing sensation would begin in my lower abdomen.

Lasted several hours and recurred several times monthly and the pain was so significant that I had to leave work some days.  Since my PC Physician put me on Bentyl_ I've had virtually zero symptoms as long as I continue to take the medication as a preventative treatment because it's not powerful enough to stop symptoms that have already manifested.Extremely happy to not be in crippling pain anymore but taking this medication makes me feel 'high' and it's affected my memory and concentration.

64, 1, ER visit,SEVERE blurred vision_ dizziness_ very dry mouth_ drowsiness_ chills.,I was sent to the ER due to bad stomach pains. The doctor gave me Bentyl because he thought it was due to IBS. 5 minutes after taking it I could not even read the text on my cell phone my vision was so blurred. The blurriness lasted around 15 minutes. It was very uncomfortable. The dizziness was horrible too. I remember having a hard time walking to the bathroom. My mouth became so dry that they had to put me on a IV to pump more fluids in me. Just be careful if you have to take this stuff.,M,21,1  days20mg 1X D,8/13/2011Email,Bentyl

66, 5, IBS w/ constipation,Intermittent dizziness (feels like back of head is spinning) and blurry vision (have to wear reading glasses all the time_ not just in low-light situations as prior to bentyl),This drug has been like a miracle_ and I'd nominate my doctor for a nobel prize for prescribing this if I could!  After only 24 hours on it_ it totally ended the 20+ years of agonizing pain_ spasms and cramps I have endured with IBS-C.  The side effects are very minor compared to the debilitating pain of IBS.  Now my digestive system is normal_ I don't have to worry about attending meetings_ etc. at work. Prior to bentyl_ the pain was so severe I could not maintain an upright position_ and it would last for weeks and weeks until I basically stopped eating.  I take one (1) 10-mg capsule in the morning (two if I anticipate it being a stressful day) and maybe one (1) more at or after lunch.

I would suggest trying Bentyl for yourself and see how it works.  I figured out that I don't want to take it 3 times a day and only use it when I start feeling bad or if I know I'm about to eat something that's going to cause my IBS to flair up.,F,30,10  days20 2X D,3/22/2011,Bentyl

When I was in Asia on travel years ago_ I was having cramps_ and got OTC from a pharmacy a tiny pill called BUSCOPAN. Hallelujah! One little 10mg pill gave me instant relief from spasms and cramp pain for 24 hours! Upon return to the US_ I found this was not available for some reason_ though it's been on the market for 50 years and is OTC in dozens of countries_ including Germany_slight difference in my cramps and doens't last very long - though it's better than nothing.However_ you need a prescription for Bentyl_ while you can buy Buscopan online without a prescription_ and it works much better. WHen I was hospitalized in Germany_ the hospital gave me a super-strength version only available by Rx_ and it was immediate relief. It's sold overseas for menstrual cramps as well_ and taken with Ibuprofin_ I don't even know I have my period!If you're finding Bentyl doesn't work for you_ or doesn't work well_ go online and order a bottle of 10mg tabs OTC.

78, 4, IBS,Initiially extrememly satisfied w/ Bentyl and it helped my IBS a great deal. The initial side effects were slight drowsiness_ dry mouth_ and it also seemed to ease some anxiety issues which were derived from IBS since never being sure if you'll be able to make it to the restroom before dooking in your pants can be an anxiety inducing issue.However_ last night had a most frightening experience w/ Bentyl from which I'm still recovering from as this is being written.Took my prescribed dosage at around 9 pm. By 10 pm my face was itchy and red and the whites of my eyes were completely bloodshot. I should have immediately called 911 but like a fool I didn't. From the there the problem progressed until it got to the point that it felt as if sand mixed w/ pepper sauce had been thrown into my eyes- they were impossible to keep open. Obviously it was impossible to sleep. By around 7 in the morning the itching and burning had subsided somewhat and managed to go to bed. Upon waking up arou,Do not be a fool like me.

Started at 10 mg and moved to 20.  I am so frightened by this drug that I feel that I need to taper off rather than to stop abruptly_ and maybe 10 mg will work for me without destroying my well-being.  It was OK at the beginning.

126, 5, Had a bout of spastic colon.,None.,"I was on board a Princess Cruise (which I highly recommend!) in the Caribbean and had a spastic colon attack. The ship's doctor_ Russell Thomson_ was kind_ helpful_ knowledgeable_ extremely professional and gave me some ""Merbentyl"" (available as dicyclomine hydrochloride_ also known as dicycloverine hydrochloride_ only in the U.K.)  I later found out it was sold in the US under the name Bentyl.  This stopped the cramps within 20 minutes_ which helped in stopping the rectal bleeding (very dangerous on board ship in the middle of the Gulf) and I felt much better within 24 hours.  I had a colonoscopy upon return to the US and was told I had diverticulosis_ which could be controlled with a high fiber diet & Bentyl (as needed).  I have had absolutely no side effects from taking this 3 times a day for 6 days while on board the ship.  I plan on having the U.S. prescription filled so I'll have it handy_ just in case.  This medication worked wonders for my severe abdominal crampin",M,51,6  days,12/15/2005,Bentyl
