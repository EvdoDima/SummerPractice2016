0, 3, Severe stomach pain,Dry mouth_ dizziness_ blurred vision_ anxiety_ etc.,I was prescribed bentyl on Saturday after I came out of the ER. I've been having this pain in my stomach for so long and the last time I went to the ER_ they prescribed percocets. Let me just say_ i'd rather be high off of the percocets than bentyl. I literally just took it about an hour ago since I'm at work alone so I'm worried I'll get the pain after I eat. I was literally freaking out about 10 mins ago. I got super dizzy and nauseous. I felt like everything was going in slow motion and felt like I was going to collapse on the floor. I'm pretty sure it gave me anxiety because I felt like I was about to die. I had to call my mom and have her talk to me so I could relax. I started getting customers walking in to my job and I felt like I couldn't keep up a conversation. I don't recommend it but I guess since we're all different_ we won't all have the same side effects. Be careful and make sure you're at home taking it.,F,24,4  days20 mg,7/6/2016,Bentyl
1, 1, Ibs perscription,Side effects are as ppl say..,"I want to comment that this drug has been perscribed ""to my knowlage"" since the 70s-- I was surprised by the medical world that this drug still exists in 2016/ is that how far medicine has come in 45 yrs??  Pathetic don't let ur doc give u something like this_ research ur drugs! My aunt that used to take this ended up with serious psycosematic issues_ and bad ocd",F,45,0  days20mg 3X D,5/7/2016,Bentyl
2, 5, Chronic radiation enteritis,Bentyl has been a life saver for me!  I developed Chronic Radiation Enteritis 2 1/2 years after radiation to the small bowel & chemotherapy. I would have episodes of absolutely to worst pain i have ever felt. My episodes started w severe upper abdominal pain_ then went to 12 hours of vomiting_ nausea_ diarrhea. I would sleep on the bathroom floor_ alternating from so hot that i had to take all of my clothes off_ to freezing. My doc told me to take this drug the minute i felt like it was coming on & then don't eat or drink anything until it is gone. This drug is awesome! It has saved me from at least 2 episodes & significantly lessened another. I don't have any high feeling that some say they experience. I do have dry mouth but i just drink more water. I will take that any day over throwing up all night! I don't leave home without it.,,F,49,4  weeks,4/17/2016,Bentyl
3, 4, diverticulitis,extreme drowsiness,Except for the drowsiness_ this is a miracle drug.  I would get severe diarrhea and nausea/vomiting for days and end up in the er on IV fluids.

4, 4, severe abdominal pain and spasms,Dry mouth_ blurred foggy vision_ numb feeling throughout my body_ delayed physical responses_ everything feels like it's going slower when I take this medication_ constipation,"I have been dealing with severe constipation and hemmorhoid and stomach spasms and bad pain for years. Had tried everything Google had to offer to combat ibs_including dieting_ probiotics_ eliminating gluten or dairy_ increasing fiber_ intense excercise...etc... with no relief_ my dr prescribed this bentyl. I don't like the ""high"" feeling because I don't feel completely in control_ but it passed after being on it continuously for two weeks_ and I cut my pills in half instead of taking the full thing every 8 hours like my Dr wanted. I force myself to drink half a gallon of water by noon and another half by 6pm. To make sure I stay hydrated and help with the dry mouth. Sometimes I feel as though I'm not urinating enough for as much water as I'm drinking_ but haven't had any major signs of problems from that so no worries. I only use this medication when my stomach begins hurting. Not as preventative even though I'm directed to. It works for its intended purpose beautifully and have finally after years_ found some sort of relief..",F,29,1  months,1/24/2016Email,Bentyl

18, 3, IBS,"I have been taking Bentyl on and off for the past two years to medicate severe abdominal pain due to IBS. I'm not a fan of this drug AT ALL. I gave it 3 stars because it does alleviate the pain somewhat_ but even a minimal dosage gives me very uncomfortable side effects. There is nausea_ but what even more detrimental for me is dizziness and cognitive malfunction. I feel like I'm in a ""fog""_ I can barely concentrate on any reading material (which is VERY BAD for my work)_ I can't drive (also bad for work!)_ and most weirdly I completely lose my short-term memory - for example; constantly forgetting what I'm talking or thinking about_ forgetting something the second someone tells me_ etc. I can barely even focus enough to watch TV! Sadly real pain medication is hardly ever given to IBS sufferers (""it's all in your head"") so that is what I am stuck with.",,F,31,2  years40 mg 2X AN,5/10/2015,Bentyl

21, 4, Severe abdominal pain_ IBS,Lightheaded_ dizzy_ disoriented_ slowed heart rate_sense of unreality_ fatigue_ lack of coordination_ dry mouth_ trouble breathing_ anxiety,This drug did take away the extreme pain in my upper abdomen within a day. But the cognitive side effects are very troubling. I feel out of my body. Like floating. Have had difficulty speaking_ brain fog and dizziness. My hands and feet feel numb and tingly. Lack of coordination in hands. My heart rate slowed way down. Feel really disconnected. Wake up from sleep with heart racing. Sweating. It gives me anxiety feeling this strange. I really want to keep taking it because my stomach pain was crippling but I can't really function with all these cognitive effects either.,F,51,4  days10mg 4X D,1/20/2015Email,Bentyl

Then at the 7 th month mark started having trouble urinating as well as panic feeling and dizziness and lightheadedness. Have gotten down to 2 a day and now trying to get down to one a day.

25, 4, metformin side effects,I tend to have quite blurry vision and extreme drowiness for about an hr after taking my dose. I also feel like I am in a mental fog and have short memory lapses every so often during the rest of the day. But_ with how severe my stomach issues on metformin are_ I just make sure to schedule to take it with my metformin an hr before I get up as well as an hr before I go to sleep so i can deal with the side effects at home and sleep the drowsiness and blurred vision off. So if u only need to take it once or twice a day to help this is a pretty perfect drug to keep diarrhea and intestional pain away but if you need a medicine to take throughout the day to help_ it'd probably be a good idea to look for another medicine known to have less cognitive side effects.,,F,22,2  months4 20 mg x2,6/29/2014,Bentyl

A couple days later I noticed pain in my upper abdominal area that kept getting worse. I never had pain like this before taking Bentyl. 2 weeks into the course of meds the pain was so bad I was contemplating going to the ER bc I thought I may have a stomach ulcer or gallstones. I went back to the doctor & was reassured this medication would not cause this side effect & was told to continue taking it. I REFUSED....all my lab tests came back normal & since stopping Bentyl I haven't had the agonizing stomach pain since.

I would begin to sweat and my hands would develop a tremor and after 10-30 minutes_ an extremely painful stabbing sensation would begin in my lower abdomen.  A bowel movement (diarrhea with onset of symptoms) would reduce the pain but not eliminate it.  Lasted several hours and recurred several times monthly and the pain was so significant that I had to leave work some days.  Since my PC Physician put me on Bentyl_ I've had virtually zero symptoms as long as I continue to take the medication as a preventative treatment because it's not powerful enough to stop symptoms that have already manifested.Extremely happy to not be in crippling pain anymore but taking this medication makes me feel 'high' and it's affected my memory and concentration.
