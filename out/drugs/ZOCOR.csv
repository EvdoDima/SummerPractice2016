0, 4, High cholesterol,Could not tolerate the 20mg at first. All sorts of weird side effects even at a lower dose.  Stopped it for a while and was warned by my doctor.

And minimal.,Along with diet and exercise_ it does the job.,M,78,6  years20 1X D,2/20/2016Email,Zocor
1, 1, 134 cholesterol reading,A lot of pain in legs. Loss of libido. Forgetfulness. Dizziness. Loss of muscle strength in my legs.,I was on Statin for two years. This was eight years ago. When I complained about pain I was prescribed Vicodin and Gabapentin. I had this doctor for forty years. Now I am sure he did not know anything about what this poison can do. I found this website too late. I quit against the advice of my doctor when I felt something cristalize in my leg muscles. Now I spend most of my time in a chair because walking is too painful.

5, 2, To lower my ldl_ overall cholestero,Terribly calf_ and back of entire leg CRAMPS! OMG ! I stopped last night. My doctor increased my dosage to 40mg from 20mg about a year ago.

So_why my cardiologist wanted me to go to 80mg_I have no idea. But_ I'm done. I'm calling my doctors_  both my primary and cardiologist in the morning  (it's Sunday). These drugs are very dangerous. I'm thinking to myself_  maybe all the walking is causing my leg pain. Now_ I've been walking every day for 2 year's straight. So_ I figure_  my legs must be conditioned by now. So why_ when I get out of bed (the simvastatin causes insomnia. .I don't care what your doc tells you. Mine told me it's not the simvastatin. I swear these docs are compensated to prescribe medications. Must be. Anyway_ why do my legs hurt so much in the morning?

11, 1, As a precaution against heart attac,I had intense cramps_ weakness_ and other vague pains in my right leg_ which was weakened from childhood polio.I was starting to fear that I might end up in a wheel chair.,I had no problem with this drug for 3 years. My polio attack (age 6) was relatively light_ and I have always been active. I tried stopping Simvastatin (Zocor) 3 times because I couldn't really believe the drug was causing my problems - which I feared was caused by Post Polio Syndrome.I was not advised to stop the 'treatment'_ though my doctor agreed it would be a good idea when I suggested it.The problems started to recede each time I stopped_ but it took 9 months to return to normal. Over that time_ I took an NSAID (diclofenac) in progressively lower doses. This enabled me to exercise again - which I think contributed to my recovery.Note that Zocor seemed to selectively attack my polio leg - so I would advise anyone who has had polio (but really anyone at all!) to avoid this drug completely.,M,64,3  years40 MG 1X D,7/22/2014Email,Zocor

I took 80mg Zocor for 5 months starting January 2011 and stopped June 2011 when I suspected that Zocor may have been the cause of all my symptoms.  The weeks following stopping the medication things got worse.  I had to take a medical leave and eventually lost my job because of all my symptoms.  I saw many specialists and took numerous blood tests and imaging (x-rays and mri's) and had procedures done (upper endoscopy and colonoscopy) and everything was negative.  I was even sent to mental health who cleared of any mental issues.  I was told by both Mental health and neurology that they had seen this before with patients who had taken Simastatin at the high a level.  Things VERY SLOWLY got better but never completely better.    The last specialist I saw--a rheumatologist looking for auto immune disorders told me that since no one can find the answers for all my symptoms to try eastern medicine and holistics.  I didnt know what to make of that so I went to see a naturopath a year after I stopped taking Zocor (May 2012).  He asked what medications I've been taking prior to my symptoms and he gasped at the high level Zocor.  He pointed out that many of his patients had problems with statins.  He explained to me that the biggest problem with statins is that it inhibits the production of CoQ10 in the body which is required for all systems.

As is always recommended I reported these problems to my doctor and he told me he was certain it wasn't my medication.  I just stopped taking this drug for about a week and the muscle pain is already backing off. Who cares if ""your numbers look good""  if you feel terrible all the time.  Another incentive_ at least for me to quit statins is the updated FDA warnings about increased risk of diabetes and dementia.  My father has been taking ""Lipitor"" for years.  Within the last five years he has been diagnosed with first diabetes then dementia.  A little to close to home since the only reason I took this drug was because of ""Genetic Predisposition"" from Dad.",M,49,5  years40 MG 1X D,3/1/2012,Zocor

I thought maybe I was just reacting to stress at work_ however my feelings were totally out of whack. It would last 2-4 days_ where I had trouble concentrating_ lost appetite_ and just had a feeling of dread. Then it would go away_ and I would be fine for a few days. This cycle continued for almost 3 months. I was so confused by this_ I figured I might need some psychological help. Then it occurred to me this all started at the same time I had started on simvastatin. Anxiety didn't seem to be a listed side effect_ but I was desperate_ so stopped the simvastatin.

Difficulty walking up or down stairs. Severe aggravation of a pre-existing arthritic right knee.,I began taking Simvastatin the middle of July 2010. Since then_ I have experienced numerous aches & pains_ cramps and severe pain in my right knee. I never would have suspected Simvastatin to be the cause of these symptoms! I have the beginning stages of arthritis in my right knee and I went to see my Orthopedic surgeon sometime in August or September of 2010 because my knee was hurting more than ever. The pain got so bad_ it made going down stairs very painful. Plus_ this must explain why I have been experiencing foot cramps and muscle twitching in my lower extremities for no reason. I am an active person who exercises regularly. In the past few months I have been limited in my exercise activities due to the amount of pain. I even started to walk with a severe limp! My last 40mg tablet was taken on May 31st_ 2011 and I am already feeling better and less achy. I'm sorry_ but the long-term side effects of this drug are simply not worth it! I am grateful to have found this site where a multitude of people have similar symptoms. Why would we ever suspect that our cholesterol medication could cause these serious issues? Listen to the commercials for these drugs that are being pushed. It's all about the money folks. They spend 80% of the entire commercial announcing the possible side-effects.

What he didn't tell me that I would begin to lose energy_ ability to walk long distances_ climb stairs_ and would become depressed because I could not keep up my exercise routine_ and lost motivation to do so_ due to fatigue and muscle aches.  He didn't mention blurred vision and depression_ either.  Two weeks ago_ I was in so much pain_ throughout the day_ that I had to cut back on my work scheduled_ substantially_ and stay home. At first_ I thought that the muscle pains were a result of lifting my grandson on a trip we took 3 weeks ago_ until I read about another person on the web page that thought_ erroneously_ that she had lifted something too heavy_ which caused her problem.  After matching my symptoms with so many people on this web page_ I now suspect that the Simvastatin is the culprit.  I am normally a very strong_ healthy person_ lifting or not lifting.  Incidentally_ I can no longer go to the gym and work out_ which I have done for years_ due to fatigue and unbearable  pain on the right side of my body.

My lineage lives to 80 without this stuff. Is that such a bad age? These statins really much up my life. I mean what life? Once I'm on them. I don't want women any more. I don't want to work ouot. I don't want to get out and do things. My hair is falling out. My skin is morphing before my eyes. Before I tried this stuff people regularly said I looked like forty. Now they don't blink an eye when I say I'm 52. Cholesterol is a major component in your body. It's more than just about arterial blockage. And the Dr's don't even have it right. Cholesterol is more than just THC_ LDL & HDL. There are subfractions of these but they don't bother measuring at that level. Most of us probably don't need to be concerned with it. Plus recent eveidence shows its inflamation thats the big culptrit. Managing inflamation is the key. Even Alhzimers shows a connection to inflamation.I'll try this once more but really don't expect it to be differnt to previous attempts. Next I'll get real aerious about free radicals and inflamation. I'll get my % body fat to 8%. Concentrate on low glycemic/low insuline response foods. Balance my omega 3's & 6's.

He diagnosed the issue in my arms and hands as carpel tunnel symdrome but also stated that some of the issues that I am having even though I have been off of the Zocor for a couple of weeks_ could be due to the Zocor. He told me that it would take at least three months for that to work out of my system.  Nobody is going to talk me into going back on Statins. I will try and control with diet and exercise.

In November I began to have heart palpitations.  I went to the emergency room and they found nothing wrong.  Got the flu at Christmas 2010 (I never got sick before taking this medicine).  This drained me and I have been unable to get back to full strength since.  In December and January I developed 3 seperate rashes.

Then I started to have pain in the bottoms of my feet like a bruised feeling especially when I have been sitting for a while and get up to walk.

136, 1, High Cholesterol,After three months I ended up with bruised ulnar nerve - I attribute this to a constant underlying muscle tightness keeping all of my faschia ridged.  I noticed muscle pain about month 3 or 4 after going back to work after the summer off and put two and two together.  I stopped simvastatin one day and started back on Lipitor the next and my arms completely freaked out with lotsof muscle soreness at the end of the work day.  I called my doc and he's taken me off of all lipids for 3 mos and we will revisit statin issue then. Almost back to normal after 3 weeks of no statins.  Hopefully perfect soon...,Like many others on this board_ my insurance no longer covered Lipitor and so I was forced to switch.  Bad_ bad mistake as this one's side effects crept up on me very_ very slowly so much that I didn't draw side effect connections with simvastatin until the bruised nerve and arm pain set in.

180, 2, Cholesterol Levels,I believe these are all related to the Zocor as I did not have the issues prior.  It first started with an eye twitch.  From there almost like a respitory and stomach problem.  My throat down to stomach felt as if I had been cleaning with bleach for hours and as though someone was strangling me.  Trouble clearing throat_ some heartburn with severe pain_ but not normal heartburn. Feeling of something caught in throat.  Enheightened sense of smell. On and off fever 99.2-99.4_ then goes back to normal. Then to top that off_ noticed on back of neck a few days ago around hairline_ which seems to be an enlarged lymph node.  Something is going on here!!!,Going to my doctor on Tuesday with list of symptoms.  I am going to reduce the meds even if she doesn't suggest it to 10mg.  My main concern is the lymph node as if I have some infection somewhere now.,F,42,20  days20 mg 1X D,3/6/2010Email,Zocor
181, 1, High cholesterol,After the first week_ I noticed neck pain and thought it resulted from napping on the couch. This morning_ I could hardly get out of bed. I had extreme pain in my left chest_ neck and back. I could not lift my arm and wondered if I was having a heart attack.,I am a very active person. I teach elementary school and have never had an experience like this that I could not explain. It scared me enough to go to the neighborhood firestation so the paramedics check me out. Fortunately_ everything looked ok and I came home and got on the internet. I am stopping Simvastatin today. Hopefully_ this pain will go away since I've only used it for 2 weeks.,M,59,2  weeks40 mg 1X D,3/6/2010,Zocor
182, 3, Genetic High LDL,Also taking Zestril for High BP that came on late last year_ so not sure which to attribute these minor side effects: Dry Mouth (especially at night while sleeping)Lack of sensation during sexVivid strange dreams,"I am 40_ 6'-01""_ 218 lbs. I play ice hockey_ walk the dog an hour every day_ have a somewhat physically demanding job_ do plenty of active work around the house_ and have two busy young kids. I eat 3 healthy meals most of the time_ I brown bag it to work_ and only rarely would you ever catch me at the ""drive-thru"". I drink moderately and I don't smoke. Somehow though_ at my age I have high bad cholesterol_ and borderline high blood pressure. The thought of heart attack_ stroke_ heart disease etc... scares the hell out me_ so I will take the minor side effects from either of my two medications. I am lucky to not have the serious negative effects as some of you here_ but I'm also lucky that I went to my doctor and got on these meds_ so I don't suddenly disappear from the population at a relatively early age.",M,40,30  days20 mg 1X D,2/28/2010,Zocor

First ever 911 event.  In the hospital for 3 days.  Took Zocor first night in hospital - doctor said it wasn't connected - had the same reaction.  Doctor then stopped the drug.  All heart tests came back negative.  Took Crestor for 2 months with no side affects whatsoever.  Insurance co wouldn't pay for it and said I had to take Zocor.  Guess they really have paid now_ 3 days in a California hospital with every heart test under the sun has really added up fast.

Not sure if it's my age_ lack of activity. I wondered if I started to crave sweets after taking it_ but wasn't sure if it was just because I felt if it controlle my cholesterol I could eat what I wanted. But this has continued.,Only on 10mg and it's brought me down to just above the healthy leevel. Tried 15 mg. but it didn't make any difference (1 1/2 pills). Main concern now is weight gain.

198, 1, High Cholesterol,Started Simvastatin 20mg in Jan 2009. Side effects crept up on me gradually until they became unbearable a year later. Have gained 10lbs_ probably cuz of reduced exercise due to pain. Had pain in feet_ toes_ arms_ hands and fingers. Month 5: Started having pain in my left arm. Month 12: Told my PCP that I have had this pain for several months and that it isn't getting better - he thought it was a rotator cuff injury_ gave me instructions for exercises. This month_ my RIGHT arm started to hurt also. First thought it's from overusing the right arm to compensate for left arm pain but I'm convinced it's the medication. Month 8: My wedding rings no longer fit because they were so tight and I was hoping that this was a temporary issue due to weight gain. Recently I had my ring size measured. I was a size 6.5 through the 1970s/1980s_ and had been a 7 all through the 1990s up till last year August - I was told that it's a 9 now! I can't believe that my size would increase that much in such a s,I stopped taking Simvastatin on Jan 10. The pains are diminishing gradually but are still there. My arm pain is much better on my right arm but I still have my left arm pain and I do believe that I do have an actual rotator cuff injury and I need to keep doing the exercises to see if it will get better without some sort of repair surgery. My fingers still hurt although it doesn't seem to be as constant as it was previously. They are still swollen. I recently spoke with my sister and it turns out that she has had almost all the same side effects as mine which she first got on Lipitor a couple of years ago_ then went off it and then started Simvastatin last year and got the same problems again so she went off it before the end of the year. I wish I had spoken to her about this earlier - we didn't know that we were going through the same issues as we live far apart and usually don't discuss health problems.,F,54,1  years,1/21/2010Email,Zocor

200, 3, High colestorol,I started 40mg Simvastin 2 weeks ago a year after procrastinating starting it. A week later_ I had extreme vertigo and my first 911 call ever_ but the doctor the next day said it was caused by a sinus infection and prescribed an antibiotic (Azithromycin). Ever since_ though_ while I have no clear physical symptoms_ I have felt a difference in fatigue/sleep. I'm 320 lbs. and get little exercise_ and had irregular sleeping patterns while not working for a period right now_ so my sleep was irregular already_ but I felt like I understood the patterns/tiredness. Since then it feels very different. I feel a sort of constant tiredness_ a 'crash' when I go to deep sleep_ I haven't come close to remembering a dream when I wake up_ I wake up in a sort of 'still tired' feeling_ I just 'don't feel normal' in a way. I can't tell if it's the drug or not_ I started Mertformin and it at the same time for diabetes diagised a year ago_ blood sugar went from 300 to sometimes over 400 without med to 175-2,I just don't know if it is having any bad effects. I don't know how to even check my cholestorol without asking for a lab test_ bt I'm interested in this 'different feeling' right now. I'm deciding whether to stop taking it ands see if there are any changes_ it sounds like there are no problems stopping/starting_ hope that's correct.,M,46,14  days,1/10/2010Email,Zocor
201, 2, High Cholesterol,Right from the first day I noticed sore feet for no apparent reason. Woke up on the second day with a stabbing pain (similar to an extreme cramp)in my left bicep area from my shoulder to my elbow along with and ache in my left hand. These are my only two symtoms as I am only on my third day and am about ready to abort mission. I have read many negative reports online about Zocor that make me question whether or not the side effects are really going to be worth the possibility of lowering my cholesterol. It seems that there are many more side effects to look forward to if I continue to use this DRUG. I will give it a full week and make my decision accordingly. Destroying my body in one way to repair it in another is simply out of the question.,"I realize that these medications (drugs) have different side effects on different people and some may tolerate it better at certain levels. I am a 44 year old male_ 6' 4"" - 215 lbs_ with no physical ailments other than high cholesterol. I am alarmed at the fast rate in which the side effects from this drug seemed to alter my body. I will remain on this pill for a total of 7 days and after that if the adverse effects are still apparent I will no longer take this medication. I take no other medications at this time.",M,44,3  days,1/10/2010,Zocor
202, 1, Cholesterol,1st signs rash itching difficulty breathing; nausea; stuffy nose tightness in the chest; chest pain; weakness; pale stools; red_ stabbing stomach pain; ,1st episode was in August of 2009; Came off because I thought I was getting the flu. No fever;no phlegm_ got better in about 1 month. Went back on the drug in early November at 80mgs again. This time along with 2 niacin per Dr. orders because the zocor was working but not for another type of cholesetorol (not sure ldl etc..) that he thought the niacin would bring down. After over 1 month I thought I was getting a cold again; sluggish feeling had difficulty getting out of the chair. I felt intoxicated and could not walk. My 1st symptms started to get a tingling - then redness; maybe it was the niacin but the I was familiar with the diffulty of getting out of the chair so I came off the drug again because I thought I was getting sick again. Stiff upper back; spasms in lower back. I went to hospital twice no signs of any type of flew. I then got chest tightness and nasuau. I kept waiting for phlegm to come up from my chest but never did. I don't believe it after reading this board. After 3 weeks of being off this drug ; no I don't have nausua anymore; just yesterday my leg strength started to come back. Stools started to get a bit more solid. I am still in a fog like I'm drunk but it's not as bad as 3 weeks ago. I'm hoping it will go away. I'm realizing that throughout the year on this drug I always wanted to massage my head. Do not take this drug and if you do especially DO NOT MIX with Niacin. This is not a way to live life.

204, 1, high Cholesterol,Now age 64. Started zocor 5 years ago at docs advice. Read several articles saying statins had many positive effects on whole health. Was happy to be able to take it. But....in the past 6 months noticed aches_ deep muscle pain_ more than normal fatigue_ fuzzy memory issues_ screaming calf cramping and feet cramping_ weakness. Last weekend could hardly pickup my 3 year old grandson. I got scared. Was having a hard time believing it could be this drug that was causing all this. Was thinking I had symptoms of MS or some neuro muscular disorder. I like to dance and exercise but was feeling like i couldn't connect my brain to the movement I wanted to make_ seamlessly. I have always had a strong kinesthetic awareness and never felt disconnected from my body at all. But i am beginning to realise that the statin has contributed or caused this malaize. Libido non existent for a long time. Believed this was all age and work related. Was exhausted over the holidays with 8 days of family visiting,"Today is day 5 off the drug. Feel better already. Not 100% but improvement noticable.I think my symptoms are zocor related. And will stay off drug for 60 days then call the doc. Zocor alone did not bring my levels under 218. Diet and exercise with zocor did get it under 200. I weigh 126 and am 5'2"". I must get weight down to 110. And maybe take fish oil.And exercise daily.",F,64,5  years,1/8/2010Email,Zocor

Headaches_ nausea_ gas and frequent diarrhea.  I thought the diarrhea might stop_ but it hasn't completely. The headaches and nausea seem to occur simultaneously when my stomach is empty.  I always have had to eat 3 regular meals to avoid the drop in blood sugar and accompanying nausea / hot flash_ but it is much worse now.  I had to pull over the other day when this ""hit"" me while driving I felt so sick.",I told my doctor today about all these side effects and we agreed that I would stop taking this medicine today.  She is going to start me on niacin in 30 days to see if this will provide results without so many side effects; however_ she did mention it causes hot flashes_ but these can be reduced by taking the niacin with aspirin.  I am also going to go on a diet to try to lose 20 pounds although we know that high cholesterol is gentic for me. I don't want to take any more statins so will try everything else before I take this again.,F,50,20  days,1/6/2010,Zocor

211, 2, high total cholestorl 236,posted previously (12/9/09): I am adding this message to my previous comments in hopes of helping others.  My loss of sexual function was helped greatly (after stopping simvistatin) by taking 1500mg of Acetyl L-Carnitine.  While I am not an advocate of taking supplements or vitamins I was relieved to note almost immediate erectile improvement with this one.  It is available without RX.  If you try this and it works_ you may want to relate your experience here in order to help others.,I have found out that simvistatin is able to get into the brain.  Also_ some speculate that since lipids are necessary building blocks of hormones_ testosterone could be lowered by lowering the availability of lipids with statin therapy.  What ever the reason simvistatin appears to have caused my loss of libido. My doctor has given me an RX for Crestor and I asked him for an order to get a baseline testosterone level before I start Crestor.  Although Crestor isn't supposed to cross into the central nervous system (brain)_ it is going to take a great deal of courage to start taking it as my sexual function is only now (2 months after stopping simvistatin) approaching what it was before simvistatin.  Life without an ability to have sexual experiences is very depressing. I can now totally empathize with postmenopausal women who SUFFER from loss of libido. It is hard to believe that a heart attack from high cholesterol could be more life altering (unless it killed you).,M,62,60  days,12/20/2009,Zocor
212, 3, High total cholesterol,Started Simvastatin 20 mgs about two months ago.  No problems until recently when started to get pain in front thighs/groin bilaterally_ making walking difficult and painful.  Also some stiffness in the feet on getting up in the morning.  Was beginning to think I suddenly needed a hip replacement when it occurred to me to Google side-effects of Simvastatin.  AFter reading so many posts describing similar symptoms am now going to stop the Simvastatin and see what happens.,While I'd like to have a lower cholesterol level_ if the price of that is feeling prematurely old - as I have started to - I think I'd rather take my chances with high cholesterol.  The link between high cholesterol and heart disease is still not proven after all.  For those who can afford it a CT heart scan will show whether there is any 'furring of the arteries' or not.  I had one and it was negative_ which reassures me for now.,F,50,2  months,12/17/2009,Zocor
213, 4, HYPERCHOLESTEROL,Been taking Zocor for several years and noticed more age related aches and pains (I'm 67). Recently was diagnosed with minor (partial) rotator cuff tendon tear NOT due to any increase in exercise or unusual activity. Doc recommended simple shoulder exercises surgery is an option if pain increases or range of motion declines.

I went from a total level of 248 to a total 189 in 3 months. The doctor has increased dosage to 20mg due to the to good and bad levels were still a bit out of wack.

224, 1, My cholsterol was about 220.,After about two weeks on Zocor I began feeling overall weak and it was very apparent that exercise was not something that I could maintain as I had done prior to starting Zocor. I was recovering from back surgery_ and exercise was a very important part of my rehabilitation. I had to give up exercise at the gym as I no longer had enough strength to ride a stationery exercise bike. The large muscles of my arms and legs were affected. After three weeks on Zocor_ I notified my doctor that I was stopping it. It has been about two weeks since I stopped taking Zocor and I am a little stronger but am still greatly affected by the Zocor with weakness and shaking in the large muscles. I will NEVER take this medicine again. Unlike most of you_ my doctor started me off at 80 mg of simvastatin (generic Zocor) even though I told him that sometimes I'm very sensitive to medications. The simvasatin brought my cholesterol down to 159 within two weeks. This has been a good lesson for me to be more aggre,,F,64,22  days,11/14/2009Email,Zocor
225, 1, high cholesterol,Zocor lowered my LDL but after 4-6 months I was experiencing lower back pain_ pain in my feet and general weakness.  This was so gradual and after I had been on Zocor for a few months that I didn't attribute it to the drug. I would describe the pain as extreme stiffness to the point of pain_ not so bad when I was up and moving_ exercising etc._ but after sitting_ driving or sleeping_ it was difficult to walk for several minutes.  I felt old_ tired and unmotivated.,Dr. though arthritis_ however_ xrays revealed little of that.  After stopping Zocor for 3 months_ I am about 80% improved.Began taking 50 mg. of Co Q10 which seemed to speed up the improvement.  -I have heard of benefits in pain reduction while on statins when adding Co Q10.,F,52,10  months,11/13/2009,Zocor
226, 1, High Cholesterol  - hereditary,My bones ached all the time. I started to experience heartburns on a regular basis. This was never a problem before. Fuzzy thinking. Gained 15 lbs. during the 3 months I took Zocor.The worst part: I stopped taking it in November 2008 and the heartburn developed into serious acid reflux_ that does not go away_ so now_ thanks to Zocor_ I have to take regular medication to help with acid reflux. Also the pain in my right shoulder never went away. I don't know if it ever will. 2 lasting side effects so far.,This stuff is pure poison. My doc prescribed 40 mg. He did not start with the lower dose of 20 mg_ which is beyond me. When I came back to see the doc because of all the side effects_ he was in complete denial. I felt like an idiot and have since found a new doc who actually listens.Yes_ the Zocor signicantly lowered my cholesterol_ but who cares_ I could not live with the side effects and still have them after quitting Zocor almost a year ago. This is unbelievable.,F,51,3  months,11/10/2009Email,Zocor
227, 1, Elevated cholesterol level,Gradually started hurting and feeling stiff everywhere-thought it was old age and the effects of a very stressful year catching up to me. Numbness in my right arm and around right kneecap. Anxiety and depression. Woke up with swollen_ painful wrist one morning with no apparent cause.Then extreme lower back pain and numbness radiating down to legs. When the shooting pains began from ankle up my calf (so bad_ my leg jumped) it occured to me it might be the simvastatin. Had my daughter look up side effects on the internet. Stopped taking it that night. Next day felt so much better-I did a lot of strenuous yardwork and hardly had any stiffness or soreness that night.Most symptoms gone after 1 week off_ except for the wrist still sore and sometimes swollen-worse right after I wake up.,Will never take another statin.

228, 3, High Cholesterol.,I took Zocor and other statins for approximately 15 years at the 20mg level. I started around age 30 using various different statins depending on what my insurance company was getting the best deal on. I did fine until I hit 44 and I started having some anxiety and my blood pressure would pop up at the doctors office. I took Zocor for the vast amount of the time that I was on statins.The doctor felt that perhaps I was developing hypertension and increased the dosage to 40mg.  I also noted some water retention in my hands and feet.  I also started to develop nueropathy in my hands and feet.  The 40 mg didn't really make much of a dent in my cholesterol levels.  So the doctor bumped it to 80MG.  This is when my hair started falling and my bowels slowed the a crawl.  The last inch or so of my rectum stopped working so I would end up with some pretty nasty wipes for a while.  It was just better to shower after wards.  If you didn't it would slowly leak out for hours.

230, 2, High Cholesterol,The first side effects-excessive dry mouth_ constant thirst_ and diarrhea--began almost immediately_ the day after taking the first dose.  Then the chest pain and tightness began along with tingling_ numbness_ and a shredding feeling across the top of my chest from my throat/neck/collarbone to my breasts.   Heartburn and belching.  Chronic fatigue and lethargy_ insomnia_ anxiety_ and depression. Painful left groin in conjunction with a dull ache extending from left buttock to the back of the knee causing me to limp from time to time. Finally_ intermittent blurred vision in one eye.,I stopped taking Zocor two weeks ago.  Most of the physical side effects I experienced have gone.  The depression_ anxiety_ and fatigue have also seemed to disappear (but just in the past few days) and I am sleeping again. What scares and angers me about this drug and the more than 3 months of unnecessary misery I experienced is that I_ not my physician_ made the connection between the Zocor and the symptoms I had. In prescribing Zocor my doctor only mentioned dry mouth_ diarrhea_ and minor muscle soreness as possible side effects. About 4 weeks after beginning the drug_ I talked to her about the chest pain_ tightness_ and heartburn. She said my symptoms were the result of anxiety_ and prescribed meds for that and for the insomnia.  There was no mention of Zocor as a possible cause of the conditions for which she was now prescribing more pharmaceuticals.,F,55,3  months,10/21/2009,Zocor

Leg cramps_ and a sore shoulder_meant that at night I could not sleep on my side.,I was prescribed this by my doctor because I have a family history of heart disease and my cholesterol was at about 220. I have been on the drug for 2 years until I decided last month that enough is enough- I feel so achy all the time that exercise_ even moderate walking has become a big effort. I felt more like an 80 year old_ rather than 50. I have put on weight because of the lack of exercise_ and now my blood pressure is getting high. So my doctor suggested meds for that as well. Instead_ I have stopped the Zocor_ I will consult a dietician and follow a vegetarian diet_ and hopefully soon be out walking again. At least I sleep better now- no more leg cramps!I tried to report this to the FDA as a few of you suggested but their website is impossible.

236, 1, Prescribed for high cholestrol,Only took Zocor for about 2 weeks. Arm muscles began to weaken. Dr. said don't worry_ drug only affects large muscles (??).  Maybe_ like the heart?

It has been over 8 years since this started and getting worse. Taking CoQ10.  Cholestrol still high_ but my father had over 420 count at age 82_ so what is the big deal?

My doc told me it was too high (!) and I needed a statin_ so he put me on simvastatin 40 mg saying it was a low dose. After several months I developed severel low back pain_ was in for 2 weeks. In that time my wife did research and told me that it was the statins_ so I stopped taking them and my back pain went away. 4 months later and back at the doc_ who told me it was all in my head and to get back on the statins_ so I did. That was three months ago_ and here I am in bed_ again_ with a sore back and intense pain going down my arms. I have been like this for a week_ unable to do anything. I am so tired. My wife reminded me (how easily I forget--cloudy thinking) that I had these same problems before and that I need to get off this darn drug!

241, 1, high cholesterol,Joint pain in knees and feet.,Started taking Zocor in December 2008.  By mid-January I was in almost constant pain_ without apparent cause.  First noticed the pain in my knees_ felt like it was focused just underneath both kneecaps.  I would take the pill at night as recommended and then wake up in the morning with pain.  I knew there was no reason to have pain after sleeping for several hours_ and not having the same level of pain when I went to bed.  I'm 38 years old and in good physical condition.  I am in the military and running has been a way of life for me for the past 12 years_ never had ANY problems with my knees until now_ but it started suddenly just a few weeks after I started on Zocor.  There is NO doubt in my mind that Zocor is the culprit.  To verify this to myself_ I stopped the pill for a week and my knee pain quickly improved.  I have tried to get more than one doctor to listen to my story but they seem either uninterested or openly doubtful.  Zocor has done its job--my cholesterol numbers are back in the normal range_ but it has cost me the ability to move about comfortably.  Stairs are a nightmare_ and sometimes it hurts too much to walk across level ground.  I can no longer run or ride a bicycle unless I stop taking Zocor for a few days first.,M,38,8  months,9/9/2009,Zocor

Seems to be obvious now.  Stopped the zocor and will go back to GP.  On the B vitimans and fish oil plus exercise - hope my drive and fitness will return but fearful of long term damage,Friends (2) had been taking zocor for 20 plus years_ both developed severe pancreatitus and died of pancreatic cancer within 18 months - be very careful of this drug.

Give this poison up! My poor excuse of a Dr. suggested I up my intake of Zocor to 30 mg. I did that and at the same time started a diet_ long story short_ I quickly lost 15 lbs_ had my cholesterol tested_ it was down to 120. Called the Dr. and said I don't think 120 is normal_ her response? 120 is great_ keep taking the Zocor. Within 35 days of losing the weight and uping the Zocor the symptoms started_ my hair started falling out_ a lot_ my mood was terrible_ I was foggy and out of it (not like me)_ I was getting agitated and angry all of the time (not like me)_ my arms and legs hurt_ I had terrible hot flashes. I wrote all of this off to PMS_ just getting older_ etc. I started researching all of the possible reasons why my hair was falling out because the Dr. had no clue_ of course_ and finally I came across an article about statins. Bingo! I learned that any cholesterol reading under 160 is cause for concern_ mine went down to 120 and I was still taking 30 mg of Zocor_ what an idiot! I learned that your hormones_ organs_ your entire body_ especially your brain needs cholesterol_ period_ to function correctly. I stopped the Zocor 2 weeks ago and I feel like a new person_ my hair stopped falling out on day 5_ no hot flashes_ my mood is almost back to normal and I feel great.

244, 1, High Cholesterol,I was on Simvastatin (generic for Zocor). There are many similar drugs in this category including Crestor_ Lipitor etc... I strongly encourage any of you to discuss the possible side effects of that drug with your doctor and should you decide to take it pay careful attention to how you feel. I felt fine for a year or so after beginning Simvastatin then my health crashed. I am 39 years old. I run_ lift and Box daily so there was no good explanation for an immediate loss of energy_ complete loss of sex drive_ stamina_ focus and drive. The worst effects though may have been the loss of memory and mental clarity which even now has not fully returned. I have been off the drug since Jan' this year and I would say that I am probably about 80% but I hope that I will recover fully in time.  Only after I took it upon myself to do an in-depth search of the internet based on my symptoms did I find that MANY people on cholesterol lowering drugs have some of these same symptoms.

I also take Synthroid for hypothyroidism with TSH usually 2.40; good for me.  I was not very good at taking it consistently but two weeks before my lab tests I took it 13 nights out of the 14.  I started with various side effects and assumed that it was due to ""postmenopausal symptoms.""  I had blood work done a week before my appt and lipid profile was good; but for the first time I had creatinine low at 0.61_ albumin/creatinine ratio high at 43.7 and TSH had risen to 4.46.  I was concerned. I had these problems magnified because of the consistency I had taken the simvastatin and I believe it affected my blood work.  I printed a list of symptoms and gave to my doctor; he did not agree.  I reminded him how sensitive I am to medications due to being hypothyroid_ and I told him I had quit taking it.  I have lost weight_ my tummy is decreasing in size_ I sleep better and I no longer have an intolerance to heat.  I am very concerned about possible permanent liver damage because of this medication.

My cpk test was double what it should be_ confirming what I suspected was the result of this drug. Initially my doctor was also feeling it was arthritis_ but ate hum,I wonder where these drug companies get their statistics. My doctor had informed me that only 5 % of patients experience any adverse effects. After this happened to me_ I started talking with others and in one day came across 6 people who had adverse effects (with lipitor_ rather than simvastatin). It seems to me that most of these adverse effects do not get reported. So please be sure you contact fda/medwatch and report your adverse effect so that these statistics can become more accurate.

You may wonder why sanity keeps popping up_ so again I will say 2 years 4 months and 3 days _understand how long that is to a once normal_ active_ fun_ loving_ young woman? It seems a lifetime ago_and the mirror agrees with me.,I was prescribed Zocor 40 mg 2 years and 4 months ago for a possible stroke. My insurance tells me  I could have possibly had a heart attack! I dont have enough room to tell of the test done and money spent but it was my life yanno? I have had these side effects since day one of taking the meds.However at that time I was prescribed several medications and I was scared for my life so I took them anyways.My Dr.(s) told me the side effects were from something else or considered minimal. My dosage was increased to 80 mg some reason my cholesterol was getting higher. I then was hit with diabetes.. I'm thinking what the hell? Three weeks ago I was told I'm at an extremely high risk for heart attack despite everything I have done. Make a long story short. My diabetes is gone x 6 months.I have lost 27 of the mere 60 lbs gained over 2 years.I am a young woman turning old so fast I don't even recognize myself and I felt crazy_ yes I mean NUTS!God heard me and I found you_people like me.Thank you.. now I KNOW I'm not going crazy_ these effects are REAL_ and today my Dr.s will decide to save my life or be fired! After all_ They do work for me! By the way I am married with a 19yo daughter and 17 yo son. This drug has not only affected me but all of them as well_ I have found my children crying in private worried they wouldn't have a mom. SO THANKS ALOT ZOCOR!

259, 1, To prevent heart disease,I have never taken any statins - nor would I.I saw a very close friend suffer from side effects and that made me look for information. Please see my earlier comment - 11th of May_ 2009.,All statins have similar side effects. Therefore please read the comments for Simvastatin (=Zocor)_ Lipitor_ Pravachol_ Mervacor etc. The side effects can come at once or after many years when they often are diagnosed as somethings else or written off as old age.,M,74,7  years,7/16/2009,Zocor

Got to the point I was weaker than right after double bypass.,I told VA docs over and over that I was getting weaker and not a one of several managed to connect the problem with simvasatin.  They seemed to think that pain was a required element of the side effect. Had to find out for myself with extensive web browsing. Since then TV ads for statins mention weakness w/o pain.

263, 1, to lower my cholostreol,I was diagnosed 3 years ago with bursitis of the hip.  I have lived with this ever since but until recently things began to get worse.  Four months ago I would wake up with horrible cramps in my calfs.  When I asked the Dr. he told me it wasnt the medicine.  I continued to take it.  Then in February I found I couldnt get up from a sitting position and walk .  The bottom of my feet hurt so bad_ he sent me to a podiatrist that diagnoses me with osteoarthritis and neuritis of the feet.  He tells me to buy $400 night splints and $200 sneakers (NOT COVERED) but the pain gets worse.  My feet are in so much pain and my legs_ my fingers are swollen and the muscles in my arms are all inflamed.  I just came from another doctor who immediately asked me if i was on any drugs to lower my cholostral and I said yes and he said stop it now!  He also gave me Medrol to allevitate the swelling and pain since I cant take any NSAIDS and referred me to a Rhematologist.

269, 1, To lower cholesterol,FEAR - of all the possible side effects.,"I find it shameful that many doctors are quicker to break out the script pad than they are at discussing options with their patients.  I am finding that in ""my case"" a high fiber diet (green leafy carbs_ brown rice_ oatmeal_ etc..) smaller portions of lean meat_ plenty of water and exercise as well as a daily dose of niacin (a B3 vitamin) supplementation is what I needed (without any side effects) I would recommend to everyone on statins to discuss with your health care provider/and nutritionist the consideration of exercise and diet w/niacin supplementation in lieu of prescription statins.  I have been reading that in some cases lower doses of statins and a daily dose of Niacin were more actually more effective than the higher dose of the statin (that many doctors like to prescribe) I have attached a few links for those that would like to research this further. - Note: Niacin supplementation does pose some risk to certain individuals ie.. if you have liver enzyme issues_ diabetes_ or a few other conditions--that is why I say to DISCUSS it with your medical provider. Please don't just jump into a high dose niacin regimen and expect your health to improve.

I spent an hour & 1/2 in the nurse's office_ before it would quit long enough for me to drive home. I forgot to take the pill (it was new to me) until the following Wednesday.  Again_ I took it after I ate my lunch.  Exactly one hour later_again with the projectile vomiting_ didn't even make it to the restroom this time.  Then the projectile diarrhea started.

Eventually_ I started feeling like an old lady_ lost all interest in sex_ overall poor feeling_ woke up many nights with severe leg cramps.  One night my right knee started hurting so severely that I woke up from a dead sleep.  Two days later_ I woke up with such severe back pain on my lower right side I thought it was a kidney infection or failure.  I immediately wondered if these things were my medication.  I went to the computer and looked up Zocor side effects.  I WAS SHOCKED.  Many people had similar stories or worse.  MY DOCTOR NEVER TOLD ME THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN.  This drug is poison.  It needs to be removed fromthe market.  After further research_ my husband stopped taking it and his backache stopped after many months of thinking this was old age.,This drug needs to be stopped.

I'll miss the zero co-pay the insurance companies have for statin drugs_ but the cost is worth it to me for Mona Vie.  I have been drinking it since January with good results so far combined with zocor and diet.  While the combination seemed to be working quite well_ I cannot take Zocor anymore_ even if it's basically free for me.  The cost to my quality of life is more important that the cost to my wallet.

Cannot move around at all without using a cane or a crutch.,Don't take this drug or continue taking it if you have any muscle or joint trouble.

Othopedic alleviated pain with a steriod shot. The following week painful nodules appeared under arm pits. Two weeks later_ I developed a left elbow bursitis (8 cc's fluid was extracted) and I consulted two specialists and had to take family leave for 10 days. It took two orthopedic visits and 2 steriod shots to alleviate the pain. I came off Zocor after two months and the bursitis and under arm nodules disappeared. It was restarted one month later after a high cholesterol reading. The nodules and bursitis reappeared. The Tennis elbow has persisted to the point that I have to wear arm supports to bowl. Today my physician stated that I was allergic to Zocor and was placed back on Lipitor and he will deal with insurance company.

561, 1, elevated cholesteral,I hope I can help someone else. I had a horrible experience. I started taking Zocor in July. In september I was under a lot of stress and also suffer from high anxiety. I had a migrane which I have never had before followed by a host of other symptoms. Many symptoms fit the description of fibromyalgia. So thats what I orignally thought it was. I had severe fatigue_ severe joint pain and stiffness in every joint in my body. I had severe pain in my shoulders_ vertebra_hips_ knees_ hands_ ankles. I also had severe muscle pain. I would feel the joint and muscle pain especially in the middle of the night. The stiffness would improve as the day wore on and I moved around. I also had brain fog_unable to focus or concentrate or remember anything_ loss of appetite_ heightened sense of smell_ queasiness_tingling sensation on both arms by inside of elbows.I felt like I was 200 years old. My doctor treated me for anxiety and fibromyalgia with a low dose of fluoxetine however the pain never went aw,My doctor still isnt convinced it was all Zocor related. He was adament that muscle pain is the only severe side effect. Just because a symptom isnt listed doesnt mean it cant occur. I had so many people in the medical profession tell me that joint pain isnt a side effect. I think all the symptoms I had were side effects. I have never felt so sick in my life. I felt sick for 6 weeks. It put a strain on my work and family. I guess the one good thing about Zocor is that I lost 5 pounds with out trying since I was so queazy_ and my cholesteral fell from 214 to 176. I will never use it again. I will try to lower my cholestral the hard way. My liver enzymes are now back to normal. Has anyoone else had a simular experience?,F,41,3  months,10/27/2006Email,Zocor

563, 3, High cholesterol,I've been taking 20mg of zocor once a day for about 7 months.  At first there were no side effects but about a month ago began to have mild muscle pain and soreness_ shoulder pain similar to rotator cuff intermitently in both shoulders_ more frequent mild nausea and stomach pain and noticeable fatigue while exercising_ foot pain and tingling in hands and feet. Mornings are usually much worse than afternoons and evenings and I now attribute that to the fact that I was taking the drug before bed.,Like many other contributors to this site I attributed some of this to age and because my cholesterol went from 250+ to 160+ in a few short month I thought the drug was working as expected.  However_ I began to develop the other symptoms that I have described and started to think I might be seriously ill.  Then I went to this site and realized that all these people taking zocor had symptoms that were similar or identical to mine: good news and bad news---I'm probably not seriously ill but the zocor is very likely the culprit. After stopping for one day the muscle pain and soreness is almost gone.  Whether or not the zocor is the cause will be easier to determine after I've been off the drug for a while longer.  I'd rather have higher cholesterol readings and feel better than to take this drug and feel rotten.

I have not regained the muscle mass that I lost and my exercise tolerance is extremely low.  There has been a very slight overall improvement in my health_ but it is insignificant.,I wouldn't take this drug again if they told me I was going to drop dead tomorrow if I didn't.  The quality of my life is not even close to what it was prior to Zocor.  Exercise has always been an important part of my life.  Now I am in pain for days after a workout and there is no increase in muscle.  In my opinion the evidence that this drug is a life saver is weak and the information about its side effects are not well-published.  Doctors are not well informed and tend to dismiss complaints associated with this drug.  My advice--stay away from statins,F,53,3  months,10/17/2006,Zocor

584, 1, reduce cholesterol,I was prescribed 40 mg of ZOCOR daily following stent placement in my right coronary artery in May 2006. I did not note any side effects which I ascribed to the Zocor_ although I did start to experience rather frequent low level headaches_ and a nagging pain in my right shoulder_ for which I took an NSAID_ etodolac_ from 2 to 5-7 times a week. After 2 months on the 40 mg I had a follow-up cholesterol panel taken_ which indicated a significant reduction in lipids_ a reduction in HDL from 40 to 25 (the wrong direction)_ and LDL reduced from 97 to 93.  The Heart Clinic of Medford called me up last Friday (July 28_2006) and told me to double up on the ZOCOR_ and go to 80 mg_ and they would send me an Rx for the increased dosage for me to send to my mail-in pharmacy.  I took the 80 mg on Sat_ Sun_ and Mon AM_ and I felt so terrible and out of sorts I called the Heart Clinic back Monday_ and said that I was exhausted_ gassy_ constipated_ short of temper_ and out-of-sorts_ and asked if it cou,I was told by a staff nurse that it was unlikey it was the ZOCOR and that I should continue taking the increased dose for at least another week and could make an appointment with my primary care doctor to see if he could diagnose the cause of the problem if it persisted.

Oh yes_ I received another call from the Heart Clinic Wednesday_ after I had taken the 80 mg_ and my original complaint had gone on to further review_ and another nurse advised me to stop taking the ZOCOR entirely for a week to see if the side effects stopped.

585, 1, high cholestral,I was having a few back problems which is not totally unusual for me. I started having twinges in my shoulder which got progressively worse. I could hardly lift my right shoulder to put on clothers. After many weeks of physical therapy the pain in my shoulder got worse and worse. The pain would begin in my ankle and progress up to my hip and then all up my arm. The pain would migrate sometimes to the left side. My whole right side was just burning at times. I stopped taking Zocor on my own and most of the pain has gone away after 2-4 weeks.,stopping the zocor made me feel better right away. It has taken 3 weeks for the pains to gradually go away. I still have a little pain in some of my joints. I can raise my right arm without hardly any pain and the physical therapy was not the cure. My doctor is going to try me on Zetia,F,60,8  months,7/23/2006Email,Zocor

622, 1, Insurance No Longer Covered Lipitor,Thank God For The Internet! I have gone through almost every one of the side effects mentioned_ and I never would have put it all together were it not for this site.  I have had excruciating pains around my ribcage on the left side and throughout the lower neck and upper back region_ particularly behind the left shoulder blade and the middle of my back. I have also begun to feel pains in my chest_ and naturally I thought I was having a heart attack. I have been exhausted everyday_ with absolutely no libido. I get anxious and depressed for no reason. I have had to urinate constantly.  I took a 20 mg. pill this morning_ before reading the comments on this site.  I will not be taking it any longer.

623, 2, high cholesterol,Loss of memory_ decreased sex drive.,This drug will definitely affect libido_ and ability to recall information.  My total cholesterol was 233_ tg 51_ HDL 51_ and LDL 172.  My doctor put me on Zocor_ at first 5mg for 6 mos then 10 mg for the last 18 mos.  My numbers came down to 175 total_ tg 77_ HDL 47_ and LDL 113.  I started to have a decrease in sexual interest and unable to recall information once the dose increased to 10 mg.  I stopped taking Zocor almost three months ago_ adapted a low saturated fat diet (vegetarian/fish)_ and my numbers today were 173 total_ tg 64_ HDL 47_ and LDL 113.  The LDL is still a little high_ but any new diet should be tried for six months before significant results are realized.  Im still happy with todays results_ providing high cholesterol truly is directly linked to arterial sclerosis (noting some professional skeptiscism). Oh yeah_ my libido returned 3 weeks after stopping Zocor_ my memory improved after two months.  No muscle_ joint pain_ or sight problems to note.,M,47,2  years,3/24/2006Email,Zocor

I don't know if it is related but today I will stop using this drug for a few days to see if it the pain goes away. Also my sex drive has diminised somewhat over the past several years which I initially thought was due to getting older. After reading the comments from those using these drugs it now makes me think that Zocor could be the problem. To combat this problem my doctor now prescibes Levitra which only helps with an erection and does nothing to regain my sex drive.

Also_ more frequent urination_ memory loss_ dizzyness_ palpitations.,"After getting up at 4 A.M. one morning due to horrible pain (I could barely get out of bed)_ I found this website and realized it was the Zocor.

The pain would go away after being awake for an hour or so.  It would get so bad_ eventually_ that I  thought it was something serious like kidney or liver problems.  After realizing that my problem was Zocor_ I just quit ""cold turkey"" that day.  The pain doesn't go away immediately_ though.  It can take 6 weeks to 6 months.  It took me about 3 months.

Driving to work_ I felt I was cross-eyed_ blurred vision and couldn't concentrate on the road and traffic. Had several close calls.

I thought I was a hypocondriac but after reading all these people with the same side effects as me_ I am convinced that Zocor benefits doesn't outway the side effects. I started taking the drug and immediately I would feel this way. Thought my body would adjust to the drug. After 2 weeks_ some days got alittle better but not much. I had to take over for my boss while he was on vacation for 1 week. I stopped taking the drug. By the third day_ I was almost back to normal. My energy returned_ I can drive OK. I wasn't foggy and confused anymore. When my boss returned I began the treatment again. After only 1 day_ I slept 14 hours_ really bazarre nightmares_ extremely tired_ and felt so weak I had to push myself to go to work. All the symptoms returned! I drank 1 or 2 beers a day and stopped that thinking it was conteracting the drug. Nope. I use to sniff coke a long time ago_ and let me tell you_ the side effects of Zocor is far worse!

Low if any sex drive_ extreme fatigue_ slight depression and anxiety. All blood tests and other tests come back normal.

(Now all but totally gone.),I'm adding this note to soften comments I made about a month ago about Zocor because_ no thanks to my medical advisors_ I think I have discovered the source of my leg pain -- and it is not Zocor. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS! It is now mid June and for more than three months_ I have had leg pains so severe_ I haven't been able to exercise regularly. We thought Zocor had to be the culprit_ so I stopped taking it five weeks ago_ yet the pain has persisted. However_ six days ago_ for the first time since I started using them in early February_ I STOPPED WEARING DR. SCHOLL'S SHOE INSERTS IN ALL OF MY SHOES -- in my laced shoes_ loafers_ and jogging shoes! And in that brief period_ my leg pain has completely_ flatly_ and absolutely stopped. Period. Amen. The shoe inserts are not the thin_ flimsy ones_ but the thick_ molded rubber kind in the $15-18 range that really do seem to cushion the heel and forward pads of the feet. Maybe it's too soon to tell for sure what's going on here. Maybe not. I'll post additional results in another month or so. Please stand by. But not while wearing Dr. Scholl's inserts.,M,67,24  months,6/14/2005Email,Zocor

679, 3, Placed on drug after heart surgery,Had heart surgery -- steel mitral valve and triple bypass -- in July_ 2003. Much less painful than having my teeth cleaned. Started taking Zocor immediately thereafter. Starting March_ 2005_ experienced muscle pain first at the inside top-front of left calf where vein had been removed for surgery_ then in muscle spanning left calf at inside of leg_ then in hamstrings of right leg_ then in hamstrings of both legs. Pain most pronounced when walking down stairs or downhill.,There's no doubt that Zocor has done an effective job of lowering my cholesterol. Lab tests have proven it. But as of 72 hours ago_ I'm off the stuff. Leg pain at top-front of left calf that began in March was first thought to be caused by the pressure stocking which ends just above the point where a vein was removed for my bypasses. Confusing matters was a fall I took on April 2 with all my weight (275 lbs.) directly down onto concrete_ which caused much swelling to knee and leg. By April 19_ both legs felt pretty good. I wore a thigh-high pressure stocking on my left leg and a knee-high on my right leg when exercised 3 miles on a treadmill at 3.5 mph that day; the following day_ I took a 5-hour_ one-way car trip_ and when I got out of the vehicle_ I could hardly walk_ the pain was so severe in both legs. Until this week -- the week of May 9 -- the pain persisted_ though its severity varied day to day. Early in the week_ acting on my wife's mentioning that statins have been known to cause muscle pain_ I began investigating it on the internet. On Thursday_ the 12th_ I called my GP and relayed my symptoms. He told me to stop taking Zocor immediately and to plan being off of the med for at least 8 weeks. In the couple days since that phonecall_ my legs are already almost back to normal. I would recommend to anyone who is taking Zocor and experiencing muscle pain to contact their physician and discuss it with him or her immediately. For now_ I plan to try to control my cholesterol level via diet -- and to get my weight back down below an eighth of a ton.,M,67,22  months,5/14/2005Email,Zocor

Also_ ringing in the ear bothered me. So I reduced the dose from 40 mg to 20mg_ noticed differences in some areas although not in 'Ringing in the ear' problem.  Stopped Zocor about a month_ noticed improvements in Cognitive / Mental side - not complete though.  Lack of focus / Concentration still remains_ and takes longer to say write a page/letter (this is the worst consequence)_ but it is getting better.

Soon after_ my ankle and knee joints became just as painful and I had to hobble up and down stairs like an old man (I was 41 years old at the time and had just moved into a new two storey home). Next up were weird symptoms such as visibly twitching thigh muscles and a strange sensation in my calf muscles which I could best describe as gurgling. My calf muscles also felt strangely warm at times. While all of that was going on I also began suffering from brain fog where I found I had serious problems in completing relatively simple tasks and became extremely fatigued when I was put in a position of having to think for long periods of time (which is basically what I've been paid to do for the last 10 or 15 years). There were times during the 3 or 4 months that the brain fog was at it's worst that I wondered how I managed to keep my job - it was that bad. Lastly (approximately 18 months after I stopped using Zocor) I now have occasional episodes of tingling fingers_ hands and feet. When the foot and joint pain started I did quite a bit of research on statin drugs. Unfortunately I didn't find this particular site but I did find this product http://www.xtend-life.com/main/products.asp?product=tb&page=main which helped greatly with both the joint pain and the brain fog (by the way_ I have no relationship at all with this company other than being a very satisfied customer). Over the last few months I have had a number of cholesterol tests with the last one coming in at 7.3 (282 on the US scale) so my doctor has been trying to convince me to go back on Zocor which I was considering until I read this book www.ravnskov.nu/cholesterol.htm which has been like a breath of fresh air. Executive Summary: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SCIENTIFICALLY-PROVEN LINK BETWEEN HIGH CHOLESTEROL AND CORONARY HEART DISEASE. The author is a highly qualified and highly honoured doctor who has re-analysed much of the big diet/heart research completed since the 1950s and shown how biased and fundamentally flawed most (if not all) of it has been. I was extremely sceptical when I first read about his views and took each and every page of the book with the proverbial grain of salt - if he can convince this cynic then I think he can convince anybody. If you do just one thing to take control of your life after a bad experience with Zocor it should be to read this book.,M,43,1  years,5/7/2005Email,Zocor

My blurry vision has improved quite a bit.  I stopped taking Zocor about three weeks ago. To be honest_ I don't know if it's not taking Zocor_ or if it's the COQ10 that's made the improvement_ but I'm definitely a lot better/ I feel great now. I was getting really concerned about possible heart damage from statin drugs.,I'd rather have high cholesterol than take a drug that causes heart damage due to COQ10 deficiencies.  My last total cholesterol was 179.  I believe that had a lot more to do with a diet change than the Zocor_ since if the Zocor was working_ the combination of the two should have made it a lot lower.  I'm also questioning whether high cholesterol is really that bad after reading a lot of alternative type articles.,F,52,3  years,2/24/2005,Zocor

And partial numbness on my chin and hands.  Hands seem to swell when they go numb.I've been to doctors.  No one will admit ZOCOR can cause side effects.  I've even had a CT_ MRI and ultrasound.  The neurolgoist found some evidence of microstrokes and thinks this may be the cause.Now I'm wondering if the symptoms are from the microstrokes or the ZOCOR.  Or_ could the ZOCOR be causing microstrokes itself.  Scary thought.  Class Action anyone?  But how would I prove it?I'm stopping ZOCOR now.

725, 5, To lower my cholesterol from 245,I took 20mg Zocor for about 7 days_ and it has been a terrifying experience for me_ I am 32 years old male  5-11 _ 255 pounds and a day after I started taking Zocor 1/2/2005 my appetite started to decrease and I started to feel weak _ I didnt think it was the Zocor so I continued to take my daily dosage.   Four days later I was very tired and I had trouble concentrating_ I then notice that any light work will get me tired very quickly and I could feel the palpitations in my chest. At night I will feel a tingling in my right and left hand_ like when your sit on one of your leg for too long and falls asleep.    On the 7th day 1/9/05 I was extremely weak and my heart started to race_ so I took myself to the ER and checked myself in with chess pains.   I advised my doctor I was taking Zocor they test me for an enzyme in the liver to see if the Zocor was causing a reaction_ they also did an EKG _ X-Rays_ blood work_ Urine work all came back NORMAL!     I then contacted my doctor and told him I was taking myself off the Zocor and I was going to bring myself to my Ideal weight with diet and exercise. After I stopped taking the Zocor my energy levels have been coming back very slowly_ but the tingling and numbness in hands is still here at night_ and I am feeling tired but much better.I am having some digestive problems now but they are getting better also.Does anyone know how to reverse the tingling from the hands_ does it go away?

732, 1, To control high cholesterol,I have been taken Zocor for 9 years.  At the same time I had back surgeries and cervical spine surgery.  The increasing pain in my joints and muscles was always explained to be the reason for my pain.  Over the years I repeatedly asked the doctors if these increases in  muscle pain and weakness_ total exercise intolerance_ excruciating leg pain_ insomnia due to pain_ painful and total constant fatigue and much more_ could be the result of ZOCOR.  They always denied it and emphasized the importance of keeping my cholesterol controlled.  Last month_ after 9 years on 40mg of Zocor_ it was increased to 80mg. Instantly my symptoms increased even more. So much_ that one day_ when I literally could not get up from my chair because my legs would not carry me_ my friend called an ambulance to take me to the Emergency Room and there I was given fluids and sent home with no particular diagnosis. After that my doctor changed me to Lescol_ which caused the same side effects and now I have stopped any Statins and I am looking for alternative ways of treating my cholesterol problem.  I have spent years in total agony and constant decrease in energy_ depression and sense of total worthlessness.  I will never use another Statin. Since I have gone off this terrible drug_ my overall pain level is decreasing almost daily_  the skin nodules are disappearing and I have more energy. My spirits are higher as well.,I feel that every patient who reports side effects should be given muscle test and_ of course_ liver profiles on a regular basis and the doctors should be made to consider the side effects more carefully for each individual patient_ based on their history and previous activity level.,F,64,9  years,12/31/2004Email,Zocor
733, 1, High Cholesterol,Muscle pain_ severe joint pain and loss of cartilage leading to a total hip replacement. Feet hurt and burn. Swelling of hands and feet_ leading to joint degeneration. Facing foot and hand surgery because of it. Rash. Sinus problems. Affected my eyes and mental focusing. Loss of sex drive. I took it for 8 years and never had any of these symptoms until after I starting taking Zocor.,Because of the severe muscle and joint pain (which was diagnosed as Osteoarthritis) I was put on Vioxx_ which helped the pain but also added to my Sinus problems and raised my blood pressure which in turn_ caused me to be put on Cozaar for high blood pressure. All three of these meds have possible Sinunitis side effects which led to my being place on Flonaze and Claritin D. My sinuses got so bad_ I could barely breath and was using nasal sprays every two hours just to breath. I was facing Sinus surgery and develeped a big hole in my septum because of the Flonaze and all the sinus sprays. Since getting off the Zocor (which started the whole mess)_ then Vioxx and slowly the Cozaar_ my sinuses completely cleared up except for the permanent damage from the hole in my septum. My muscle pain and joint pain are getting better but are most probably permanent. I'm now off ALL the sinus medicines_ Zocor_ Vioxx_ Cozaar and trying to use only whole foods and natural medicines as much as possible. Statin drugs are horrible and I'm afraid to put any of these drugs into my body ever again. I don't care how high my cholesterol gets_ I will never take a statin again. I'm using metamucil each day along with putting all oils except olive oil and coconut oil out of my diet along with high frutose corn syrup (which is in most processed salad dressings and foods) which is probably the main reason for the increase in high cholesterol to begin with.

737, 1, High Cholesterol,I took 5 mg. Zocor for about six years with no side effects.  Went on 10 mg. a year ago.  Six months later_ I started having extreme pain in my feet- tops_ bottom_ sides_ and calves.  I asked the doctor.  He said it wasn't due to Zocor.  I continued medication until I could barely walk.  I am used to walking two to three miles per day.  About two months ago I discontinued Zocor on my own.  Three days later_ I had no pain in my feet or calves.  The doctor then put me on Lipitor - after ten days I experienced the same pain in my feet and calves as I did on Zocor.  I went off Lipitor and three days later_ my feet and calves felt better.  I am now searching for a natural way to keep my cholesterol low.  I will not go on statin drugs again as I had to be on pain killers continously and I know that is not a good thing. My feet still hurt a little at times but never aching like a toothache like they did while I was on Zocor and Lipitor.,I had no quality of life once my feet started aching and keeping me up at night.

769, 1, High cholesterol,Took 5mg at bedtime for four weeks. It knocked my cholesterol down 50 points_ but I started experiencing a debilitating pain in my joints in the morning.  The pain was so severe that it terrified me.  The tragedy was that when I saw my physician on a follow-up he told me it was arthritis this really bummed me out.  Im 41_ extremely athletic and an avid outdoorsman.  I did some research_ found out that others on Zocor had experienced like symptoms and I stopped taking it.  Within two weeks all of the pain was gone. In my case the cure was worse than the disease. I just started taking 10mg of Lipitor and Im somewhat concerned about the side effects.  Ill report back in 90 days.  Be well  JV ,,M,41, ,10/4/2004,Zocor
770, 1, high,Terrible stomach pains_ gas_ bloating_ hearburn and indigestion.  Could not take deep breaths.  Always made worse by eating anything.  Also had chest pain_ bad heart palpitations_ and headaches that lasted for days on end.  Symptoms started on day 8 of taking 20 mg.  On day 11_ I was in the ER and kept in cardiac observation thinking I was having a heart attack.  All cardio tests came back normal...no heart problems_ but stomach and chest pain continued.  Lost 8 lbs in 11 days_ because I could not eat anything without bad pain. Couldn't sleep.  Felt terrible.  Finally noticed a trend: when I took Zocor all symptoms worsened. They all started after I had been on Zocor for a week. Stopped taking it and all symptoms have improved and or stopped.  Terrible drug.  Side effects are worse than having high cholesterol.,Patients MUST be monitored regularly and often while on this drug.  Be on the alert  for and KNOW what side effects are possible.

I took myself off of zocor four weeks ago and I am already seeing a difference. I have spent thousand of dollars_ and having doctors treat me as if its all in my head. I finally found a doctor who believes that it is in fact the zocor. He told me that the doctor who put me on this medication_ put me on a very high almost toxic level for my size.

The real problems started with the sore muscles and weakness and ended up with a ruptured lower back disk! I am wondering if the Zocor ruined my muscles to the point that I injured the disk?  Now the pain is spreading up the spine and the pain between the shoulders is awful in the morning on waking. Leg cramps are getting worse and now my hands are hurting at all the finger joints.  It seems like I am loosing muscle mass and strength. The cholesterol numbers went from 260 to 163_ that was great_ but if these side effects are from the Zocor then something has to be done.  I feel like crap!  The doctor had me stop it for a week and I did not see much relief in the joint and muscle pain_ although my thinking was clearer and I felt a little more energy.,I have a relative on the Zocor that had the same basic symptoms and it took about 6 months for the symptoms to go away after stopping the Zocor.

I consider myself very fortunate to have got 12 years with very few minor side effects - but now it has caught up with me big time.  I have been complaining to my doctor for the last 4 years of leg muscle pain he is absolutely convinced that because I have no liver damage it cannot possibly be the Zocor.  I have been refered to vascular specialists who report good circulation.  Nerve specialist who reports no nerve problems.  I would be real interested to know if anyone who is reporting loss of sex drive has had a test of their blood testosterone level - mine is very low.  Could the Zocor eventually stop the body from producing testosterone which in turn brings on the symtoms of tirednes_ aching muscles etc.?  I am taking 40 mg per day and I am still alive - barely.  Eventually one says to hell with the cholesterol I have to have some quality of life.  Quantity means nothing without quality - trust me.,M,66,14  years,6/3/2004Email,Zocor

And the worst part is that doctors seems to be totally unaware of these side effects.  My eye doctors sent me to a very famous eye clinic_ and even they didn't connect my new vision problems with the Zocor.  Yet as soon as I stopped taking Zocor_ my vision problems went away.  Same with the skin rash (pimples).  Dermatologist didn't have a clue and diagnosed it as resulting from dry skin.  Clueless.  As soon as I stopped the Zocor_ all the skin problems went away.

For example_ I went to three different dermatologists about the skin nodules_ and not one of them asked me about any medication I might be taking.  Instead they gave me soaps and creams which did nothing.  I found that doctors the average doctor has been so brainwashed about the ""miraculous"" powers of the statin drugs that they will not even consider that these drugs are causing serious side effects for lots of people.  And thus these side effects are running rampant and go untreated_ or blamed on something else.  Beware.  Be very aware.",M,48,4  years,7/28/2002,Zocor

856, 1, To lower Cholestral,"I had been taking Zocor when about 1 year after the operation_ I began getting leg spasmsthat were incredibly painful.  My doctor told me to stop the Zocor__well within 3-5 days_my muscle & spasm in the right leg began to subside_ and now a few months later_and a few pounds lighter_ I feel fine.  My Lipids are still too high_ and a new cardiologisttold me to start taking Zocor (20 Mg).  I told him about the prior muscle pain_ he told me""just begin taking it"". This guy is a top flight Cardiologist at Johns Hopkins_ so I trusted him. Well_ within 2-3 days_ the spasms came back with a vengeance.  On a 10 pain scale_I was 10/10 easy_ even taking oxycontin_ it did NOT stop the spasm and pain.I stopped and again within 3-5 days the spasms in my legs stopped. It is no small coincidence that Zocor played the major role in stirring something up frommy back operation_ and play with my nerves.  I'm now going to get a muscle wasting test_(I feel there was such pain_ how could there NOT be something wrong)_ but I hope it comesback normal.  What gets me is these are all top flight docs I see_ and NO-One came outwith a connection between Zocor and my muscle pain.

I was in my late 40's and attributed the latter to the normal aging process.  Two dermatologists were unable to improve the skin nodules.  I had been on Zocor for almost five years.  My doctor switched me to Pravachol_ but these side effects continued and actually worsened.  After six months on Pravachol_ I stopped taking statin medications completely.  Within six months_ both of these side effects reversed themselves.  My skin cleared up slowly_ and my libido returned with a vengeance.",There are other things that happened to me while on Zocor (blurry vision_ collapsing to the floor once when reaching down to pick up something off the floor) that I can't definitively attribute to the drug.  But about the above two side effects there can be no doubt_ and these two side effects worsened my quality of life in many ways for over five years.  I believe there are many side effects of these strong statin drugs that are never reported or_ if reported_ are not connected with the statin drugs by the diagnosing doctor.  I would never go back on these drugs.
