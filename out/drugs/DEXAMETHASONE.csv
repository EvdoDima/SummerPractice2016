2, 1, Root canal inflammation,Had no pain or sensitivity prior to taking this medicine day 4 my teeth and gums became very sensitive and painful like before my root canal. Feel very jittery_ can't sleep_ and feeling very out of it. I'm super sensitive to medicine but I'm not taking anymore I have 2 pills left and I can't stand it. It was fine this made it worse just wish I put it together sooner.,I wouldn't take this again it did nothing to help the situation just put me in pain. I'm also epileptic so not getting enough sleep is really bad for me. The first night I was woken up by my dog I was in such a dead uncomfortable sleep she startled me and it took forever to fall back asleep. Since that night I wake up constantly.

4, 4, Inflammation after surgery,My physician prescribe Dexamethasone for inflammation after surgery.I was concerned with all the side effects noted on the medication information and review sites of other patients experience with Dexamethasone.I feared the side effect of irritabilty_mood swings and especially the weight gain.However_ my experience was the totally opposite.After my first dose I had an increase in energy and a loss of appetite and weight loss during the 2 weeks.The only bad experieince I had was heartburn couple hours after taking the medication.This was resolved  with over the counter medication.And yes it helped with the inflammation.The weight loss was not not due to the swelling going down.My pre- sugery weight was the same a week after the sugery when my physician noted I had extra swelling in sugery area and I lost 6 pounds in those 2 weeks while on Dexamethasone.,,F,39,2  weeks.75mg 2X D,3/8/2012Email,Dexamethasone

7, 2, autoimmune problem,I took dexamethasone for about 7 days and had both immediate and lasting side effects.  My glands in my neck got extremely swollen and they would wax and wane - get big and get small and big again for months.  I told my rheumatologist this and he said it was not happening because of the drug.  The dex was the only thing that changed in my life and the onset of this side effect was immediate so his reassurance did not convince me.  Secondly_ I had been warned that dex had a side effect in some of weight gain.  That did in fact happen to me but what I was unprepared for was that this weight was not water weight that shed right away after ceasing the drug.  This was different weight and it took about 8 or 10 months to drop the 10 lbs that I put on within 2 wks of being on this drug.,After taking dex I learned that the drug changes EVERY cell in your body...thus such changes leading to long-term weight gain makes sense versus just a temporary water weight gain.  Secondly_ dex is a powerful immunosuppressant and it is possible that during an immunosuppressive state microbes that had been in check by my immune system were suddenly able to activate and prompt my immune system/glands to inflame and have the waxing and waning cycle effect for months on end.  I KNOW that dex caused this side effect in me. Not saying this won't work for others but want to share my experience!,F,41, ,2/28/2009,Dexamethasone
