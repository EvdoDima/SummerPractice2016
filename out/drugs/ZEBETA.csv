0, 4, High Blood Pressure,Worked great on BP.  Only had mild stomach issue.  Had to discontinue because it caused my heart rate to go to 40 bpm even after halfing the dose.,I hated to stop this med.  very mild side effects and very effective.  Went to Altace which was was horrible compared to this_ with many wicked side effects.,F,50,1  months5 mg 1X D,4/15/2016,Zebeta
1, 3, RVOT_ frequent PVCs,Tiredness_ cold hands/feet_ headaches_ nausea_ anxiety_ depression,This drug was amazing to start with. Got rid of all my chest pain and felt quite well once the tiredness had subsided. Then came the unbelievable anxiety and depression. In a matter of weeks I became reclusive_ irritable and told my partner I wanted to throw myself of a bridge. I became so anxious I couldn't even make a simple decision and completely broke down when I couldn't get an appointment to see the doctor!  Medication was changed and within 2 weeks the depression/anxiety had disappeared. Excellent medication but the side effects were just too much for me.,F,34,3  months 1X D,7/4/2014,Zebeta
2, 5, high blood pressure - angina,This medication works very well.. I recommend it to anyone with angina...,,F,60,345  days5.25 1X D,5/12/2012Email,Zebeta
3, 1, chf_ hi blood pressure,blurred vision_ hearing loss_ ringing in ears sometimes tickle in throat_ numbness and tingeling in hands and gets very bad_ muscles in legs hurt have a hard time walking_ knees hurt_ get a strange sensation in back of thighs and start to breath heavy and legs hurt also get a strange sensation going down the middle of my chest sometimes all over body and the heels of my feet hurt especially when i'm sleeping_ and acid reflux which i believe was due to taking HBP pills for 25 years (at least 18 different pills) over the years. and of course the doctor doesn't believe you have to take all kind of test to prove him wrong. and keep everybody in business.,,F,67,5  months2.5 1X D,6/19/2011Email,Zebeta
4, 3, CHF_ Uncontrolled A-Fib,Dizziness_ Swollen Tongue & Throat_ Difficulty Breathing_ Low Blood Pressure_ Numbness In Face_ Fatigue,POSITIVE: Lowered heart rate and got me out of CHF within hours.NEGATIVE: Very low BP (60/40's); Dizziness; Fatigue; Allergic Reaction; I wish I was able to take this because it is the only drug that has worked in bringing down my high heart rate and took me out of CHF within just a few hours.  Amazing!  After stopping Zebeta_ my rate went back up over 100 (resting) within 24 hours.  I really think if I could have stayed on this_ it would have converted me out of A-fib into NSR.  If you can tolerate the side effects_ it may just be the drug for you.  Really keep an eye on your blood pressure to make sure it doesn't go too low.,F,50,1  days5 mg 1X D,3/23/2011,Zebeta
5, 5, hypertension_ arhythmias,sometimes heartbeat very slow (less than 50 bpm),works better for me than metoprolol and propranolol with less/no CNS side effects,M,28,5  years2_5 1X D,12/26/2010,Zebeta
6, 4, hypertension_ PVCs,I am taking 10MG of lisinopril but my BP went up recently (stress) so Dr. added this.  I jog 2 miles a day_ my resting HR is usually 62_ this drug is lowering my resting HR but it is stopping my PVCs (which were increasing) and has brought my BP back to 110/70; I will cut it in half for the next few days_ see if the BP results remain good but the HR goes up a little. I hate those PVCs and I can't take more than 10MG Lisinopril because it causes constipation.,,F,63,2  days5MG 1X D,3/10/2010,Zebeta
7, 4, high blood pressure,my hands go to sleep easily_ especially at night when I'm sleeping.  If I use the computer mouse much_ my right hand goes to sleep.  I also become cold more easier...used to be pretty hot-natured.,started taking half of a 5 mg pill...didn't lower BP enough so now I take a whole pill.  Seems to work fine now.,M,44,1  years,4/28/2009,Zebeta

9, 2, HBP_ PVC's,Started at 5.0 mg_ then dropped to 2.5 mg. Very Slow HR_ very tired_ more PVC's (when exercising)_ low sex drive. Lowered my BP too much (90/60) from 150/90.,My cardiologist change my RX. to Diovan 80/12.5mg_ dropped the ZEBETA after 6 months. Went for a sleep apnea study_ was RX. a CPAP machine. With the CPAP I'm sleeping much better and no more PVC's. My BP is at the 115/75 range most of the time.,M,55,6  months,10/31/2006,Zebeta

11, 4, HBP,If take > than 2.5mg = very slow HR_ tiredness_ low sex drive.,It will definetly lower your BP,M,50,6  days,10/25/2005,Zebeta
12, 5, High Blood Pressure,Zebeta is a very good drug in controlling heart rate and blood pressure....  one day dosing and it last 24 hours... I would ask your doctor about zebeta because it's not a very widely used drug but it's a good one....,Works very well in controlling heart rate.... even at low doses...,M,,6  months,10/16/2005Email,Zebeta
13, 5, Palpitations/now high bp,None really except initially due to being put on 20 mg! Went down to 2.5 and now back up to 10mg due to high BP,I think it's a wonderful drug as it has vey little side effects. In light of my high BP which is new for me_ my dr. sees no reason to change due to the minimal side effects. The feedback I've gotten from MOST Drs/hospitals is that they have NEVER even heard of it! INCLUDING Cardioligists. Not sure why that is_ but it's a shame. Get out there and ASK for it! *S* Could be VERY helpful to you.  Additionally_ it CAN mask high blood sugar so you should avoid taking it when testing for these types of things. I'm not sure if that's true for all beta-blockers. just a thought...,F,42,8  years,8/24/2005,Zebeta
14, 3, HBP_ PVC's,Started at 10mg_ too strong BP from 150/100 to 90/60 (HR 44) very dizzy_ and fatigue. Dopped to 5mg_ felt dizzy. Now taking 2.5 mg daily. Feel better_ still tired. BP 117/78_HR 60. ,Zebeta has controlled my PVC's in about 50%. I also take Diovan 80 mg (5 years in a row).,M,50,2  days,5/7/2005,Zebeta
15, 5, hypertension_ arrhthymia,Can't really tell. It's the best beta blocker I've ever been on.,Doc says it's more cardio-specific_ and doesn't make my legs feel heavy like older betas did. It works well for me_  for prob. over 7 yrs. I also have rheum arthritis and connective tissue disease. Other older betas worsened my RA/conn. tiss. disease.,F,54,7  days,11/8/2004,Zebeta
