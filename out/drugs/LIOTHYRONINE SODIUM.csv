0, 1, Hypothyroid_ Unable to lose weight,When walking or even standing still_ couldn't breathe.  Terrible Sweats.  Pounding headaches.,My endo put me on T3 to suppliment my T4.  There was a mix up between the doctor and pharmacy and I was given 15mg instead of 5.  Was absolutely unbearable!  Felt like a wrecking ball was hitting me in the side of the head.  Soaked the bed sheets and clothes constantly.  Face constantly red.  Got back down to right Rx of 5mg.  Things got better (only a mild headache vs. pounding one) but still couldn't breathe very well.  Had to since stop it and just take my chances.  Would not recommend.  :(,F,39,1  months5mg 1X D,7/3/2010Email,Liothyronine sodium
