0, 1, High Cholesteral,At first I did not notice anything_ but over the course of the year I started to get pain in my neck and shoulders.  The doctor told me it was arthritis_ but when I stopped taking it the pain has gone away.,These are very dangerous drugs and are over prescribed to patients.  I will take my chances with the cholesterol and I am currently taking Red Rice Yeast Pills.  Not sure if they are helping_ these also contain statins_ but in a natural form.  I will see how my cholesterol is when I go back.  The first time I stopped taking the Pravastatin_ my cholesterol went up and I went back on them again_ only to find out that this is a side effect when you stop taking the drugs_ high cholesterol.,F,67,2  years20MG 1X D,6/13/2016Email,Pravastatin sodium
1, 1, ,I started to notice servive muscle pains and problems even walking in my right leg . I've done nothing to cause such pain. Went had exrays and Imaging done but seems everything looks okay.This is the only medication I've been on. I've stopped taking now for a couple of months but seems like it's became worse sence I've been off. I'm usually very active no problems until now .I'M not understanding what's happening to me . I know it's because of taking this medication. Now I've been using Advil and muscle rubs to get relife and messages. Not a good thing when your doctor dosent have a answer other then pain meds.and I'm not doing that. So now what do I do will this clear up or am I damaged for good and maybe need to buy a wheelchair?  ,,F,,1  years40MG,5/13/2016,Pravastatin sodium
2, 1, High Cholesterol for the 1st time,Body and joint aches.  Weight gain,I HATE this drug.  I had never had high cholesterol before_ so when it creeped up on a recent blood exam_ my dr. prescribed Pravastatin. I do not understand how a drug that makes your body aches_ makes you lose sleep because of the pain can be a good solution for someone who now needs to exercise and maintain a healthy body weight? my arms hurt_ my joints hurt and I have gained weight. Will try a natural alternative for now.,F,49,8  weeks20mg 1X D,4/29/2016Email,Pravastatin sodium
3, 1, High triglycides,Numbness in the right arm and shoulder and pain in the upper arm . I stopped taking them and now slowly the pain etc is starting to gomaway .. Never going to take them again.,,,,7  days20 mg 1X D,12/14/2015,Pravastatin sodium
4, 1, high cholesterol,only took for 7 days. I woke up at 3 am in horrific pain in my right arm.   I was going to have my husband bring me to the emergency room.   But I realized that I had never had this happen and the only thing that has changed in my life was this drug.,,F,58,8  days40 1X D,12/8/2015Email,Pravastatin sodium
5, 1, High cholesterol,Severe insomnia that has taken me five years to pretty much get rid of.  I took this drug Sept. 2008 to Jan. 2010.  I was probably the world's best sleeper until I took this awful drug.  I think that it somehow damaged the part of my brain responsible for sleep and it has taken my a long time for my brain to heal.  This drug had a major effect on my thyroid gland and I ended up having to go to an Endocrinologist every few months for a year for him to keep a close eye on my thyroid.  Two years ago_ I started noticing that my skin was getting red.  My skin got worse and a rash started which ended up covering 60% of my body.  I was diagnosed this year with a very rare serious autoimmune disease called Dermatomyositis that has been connected to statin (including Pravastatin) use.  I am now on Methotrexate for this disease.,This is a horrible drug.  It has severely effected my sleep pattern_ my thyroid and my immune system.  If your doctor wants to put you on this drug_ RUN!!!!!!!,F,66,15  months40 mg 1X D,8/16/2015Email,Pravastatin sodium
6, 1, Caused severe muscle pain,I had severe leg cramps and burning in my feet. Muscle pain and weakness in my thighs and triceps followed. I quit the meds_ but still have the pain and weakness 6 weeks later.,I had leg trouble with Lipitor so my doctor put me on pravastatin. He said it was milder and to stick with it. What a fool I was for sticking with it.,M,62,21  days40 MG 1X D,7/2/2015Email,Pravastatin sodium
7, 1, high cholesterol,I switched from Crestor because of the high price to Pravastatin. After only a week of taking this new drug I developed severe muscle pain in upper right arm & went across my back to my neck. Then after a few more days I have some red bumps & itching.  My dr. told me to stop taking it & wait for pain to stop before I take anything else.  Its been about 10 days & still having the upper right arm pain. Taking Advil & using itching cream...not helping. Won't ever take these meds again!!!,,F,59,10  days40 mg,4/11/2015,Pravastatin sodium
8, 1, Slightly high cholesterol,One would think having had a horrible experience with statins before I would have learned. It took me 6 months to realize that the horrific and disabling pain I felt in my arms and legs was due to this medication.,I grew so fatigued_ I could hardly walk. Also_ the pain kept me up at night so that I rarely got a good night's sleep. The pain is an intense almost ripping type sensation especially in my arms and hands and legs and feet with numbness in my lower extremities. I will never take another medication like this again.,F,66,6  days10 1X D,2/15/2015Email,Pravastatin sodium
9, 4, Elevated Cholesterol,Slight stomach upset,Did the job it was supposed to (Chol now at ~150) and all other numbers in the normal range too.,M,51,1  years20mg 1X D,4/27/2014,Pravastatin sodium
10, 5, cholesterol,I took 20 mg. for several years and was changed to 10 mg. about 6 months ago. Cholesterol has been in good range and no pain.,,F,82,3  years10 mg.,8/31/2013,Pravastatin sodium
11, 1, High Cholesteral,Extreme pain in neck_ spine_ shoulder_ upper back spasms_ down my arm. Muscle weakness in my arm_ hand and fingers. It mimicks carpal tunnel_ which I have had_ but within a day or two after I discontinued it_ all the pain stopped. It took longer for the muscle weakness to disappear_ about a week or two. I could not spray a perfume bottle_ air freshner_ and difficulty combing my hair.,Before I made the connection that it could be the statin_ I tried heat pad_ ice pack for my arm and wrist because I thought it was carpel tunnel. All of that was very temporary relief. Difficulty sleeping because of so much pain. I could hardly work during the day. Over the counter pain meds barely worked and only temporary. I had to take them all the time. Ridiculous. When I finally told my doctor I stopped and told her of my symptoms_ She shook her head in disbelief_ folded her arms (body language) and said she doesn't believe its the drug because my symptoms are in part of my body_ not pain all over.,F,50,60  days40 mg 1X D,12/6/2012Email,Pravastatin sodium
12, 2, To lower cholesterol,Intense neck_ shoulder_ and arm pain.  But also hurt throughout my body: spine_ hips_ knees_ ankles_ feet.,I have just spent a miserable weekend as the pain reached a very high level.  At first I thought it was just my arthritis.  Then I fit the fibromyalgia profile almost to a T.  Finally my sister suggested I check this med at askapatient.com and here I am.  I am stopping the medication and will make a doctor appointment immediately.,F,64,44  days40 mg 1X D,12/4/2011,Pravastatin sodium
13, 2, High Cholesterol,Stiffness and joint pain mostly in right shoulder and swollen right hand_ tingling in both feet and I noticed the worse heart skipping started 3:00 am... every morning I had a little but on the 24th day it got so bad that I called my Doctor and trust me I will not take it again...,My Doctor doesn't believe that I can lower my counts on my own..  He gave me 80mgs   I feel that was to much...,F,55,25  days80mg 1X D,4/12/2011Email,Pravastatin sodium
14, 1, cholesterol issues,the side effects are severe pain.  Its weakness in your muscles and joints and some numbess in feet.  Do not assume my age of 62 could contribute to this...I was very active before and in good health.,Pill taken for about 9-10 months once a day.,F,62, 20 mg 1X D,3/16/2011,Pravastatin sodium
15, 3, High cholesterol,Excessive muscle soreness. Joint pain. Heart palpitations_ rapid/pounding pulse. Hair loss. Lack of energy. Insomnia.,It worked to lower my overall cholesterol by 70 points. However my HDL has consistently dropped and triglycerides have went up since starting this medication over a year ago. I was putting up with the side effects of muscle/joint pain however about 2 months ago I started getting palpitations and like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. After doing some research online I found this is not an uncommon side effect. I'm going to take a holiday from this medicine and discuss it with my doc. I feel that diet_ exercise and supplements can keep my high cholesterol numbers reasonable. I don't believe the side effects are worth it.,M,45,1  years10mg 1X D,1/26/2011,Pravastatin sodium
16, 4, Higher than optimal cholesterol,No side effects whatsoever. I work out fairly intensively three times a week at a gym and I was worried at first about having some of the muscle weakness and soreness and loss of energy that others report when using statins_ but_ alas_ I detected no adverse effects. The bad news is_ my cholesterol hasn't dropped quite as much as my doctor would like so I may switch to another statin soon.,I wanted to post my rating because it seems that so many people who rate drugs are seriously unhappy for one reason or another. Except for not getting my cholesterol quite as low as hoped_ this drug was fine for me. In fact_ as I await the results of a recent blood test_ I am hoping my cholesterol reading will be good enough that my doctor leaves me on this medication.,M,66,365  days20 mg 1X D,6/29/2010,Pravastatin sodium
