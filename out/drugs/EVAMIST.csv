1, 1, Dr. Suggestion,Hair loss.....too much. My doctor told me to stop immediately before I become bald.,,F,51,33  days1.53 mg 1X D,8/23/2015,Evamist
2, 1, Menopause,I had to take 2 shots in each arm to get my hot flashes and uncontrollable sweating to stop. From the very first spray_ I got a numbing in my fingers. I NEVER had that before. Even after stopping_ the numbing continued for years. I'm an artist and I work with my hands. That was very scary!,,F,52,4  days,1/14/2015,Evamist
3, 3, removed uterus,when I took too much of it I was experiencing anxiety.,I went to see a natural hormone doctor on suzanne somers website from her latest book called i'm too young for this.  your body obsorbs the natural hormones in a water soluble cream much better than the alcohol based delivery system and it is healthier.  Because of this you have to take much less mg of estrogen.,F,53,6  months 4X D,3/25/2014Email,Evamist

5, 1, perimenopause,low estrogen symptoms of worsening arthritis/headaches/chills/hot flashes/muscle aches/,Revising my review of 3/22/11. Within a month after starting it_ I noticed it wore off after about 8 hours. At 12 hours I had to spray it again (per doctor's okay).  The bottle only has 75 sprays and if you are doing 6 sprays a day it gets very expensive_ and it didn't relieve all my symtoms even at that dose and the arthritis in my fingers worsened to where they are now bent and deformed from lack of estrogen. Plus_ I couldn't hold my pets without long sleeves on (to protect them from the estrogen spray).  Currently_ back on the estradiol pill taken twice a day (only $4 month out of pocket cost) and not happy with the weight gain and dizziness on the generic estradiol pill_ so will be looking to start Premarin soon.,F,51,1  years3 sprays 2X D,3/14/2012,Evamist
6, 5, Hot Flashes_ Insomnia,No side effects. I had horrible hot flashes that were once an hour at least and terrible insomnia. It does not work instantly. It took about three weeks to fully get rid of them but now I am fine. I too lost about 5 pounds and have good energy again. It's a lifesaver to me!,,F,51,1  monthsOne spray 1X D,3/28/2011,Evamist
7, 5, perimenopause,Started this after having rashes from vivelle-dot and climara patches.  It is considered low dose (each spray equals about a .025 patch_ so 3 sprays are equal to a .075 patch). The patches gave me migraines_ headaches_ rashes_ extreme bloating_ hunger_ dry eyes and weight gain.  So did the estradiol pills. Evamist caused none of those problems_ and I felt like I was 25 y/o again! Brain working right_ sleeping great_ no bloating_ no hot sweats at night_ did not gain weight and in fact I lost weight on Evamist because I wasn't feeling like I had to have brownies and potato chips all the time (like the patches and pills caused).  The downside is how expensive this spray is. But I love it and am going to start it up again.  I had stopped EVAMIST to try the pills (estradiol) to save money. The pills (estrace generic) were the worst for side effects. Love my Evamist!,,F,51,60  days3 sprays 1X D,3/22/2011,Evamist
8, 5, Menopause,Tender breasts during the first week of use,Evamist is a wonderful bioidentical estrogen that has totally gotten rid of my hot flashes and allows me to sleep at night.  Started on 2 sprays a day and had to go up to 3 to get rid of symptoms.  After 9 months_ went back down to 2 and am doing great. You may want to consider using some natural OTC progesterone cream (like Progest)to oppose the estrogen if you still have your uterus.,F,55,18  months2 sprays 1X D,7/9/2010,Evamist
