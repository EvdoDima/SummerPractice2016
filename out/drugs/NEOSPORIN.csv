0, 5, Skin infection_ boil on face,"I did not experience any side effects.  It is greasy and gives a greasy appearance_ but the results make any ""cosmetic"" issues like this well worth it.",This product worked amazingly well for me.  I woke up with a swollen_ red spot on my face that was painful.  First I tried an antifungal cream but it didn't improve.  After one week of this_ I tried Neosporin and the effect was almost immediate.  The redness and swelling began to go away within 24 hours.  I didn't go to the doctor but think I had a Staph infection of the skin.  Neosporin is wonderful.  I was really impressed.,M,38,7  dayssmall amnt 3X D,9/10/2010,Neosporin
