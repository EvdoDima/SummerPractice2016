4, 4, Chronic Insomnia,I never review medications after taking them 1x -you need to take something for awhile to know how it affects you ( unless you are allergic /have adverse reaction ) _ but I have tried Rozerem a few times in the past and had the same experience. It helps me sleep soundly w/o vivid dreams like I have on Melatonin. I was woken up once in the night by my dog and found it was a little hard to walk at first-like being drunk-but after a minute or two it was ok. I went back to sleep easily -never happens for me. I was tired the next day. I do remember now that when I used this med in the past I often cut it in half and I wasn't tired the next day that way. I know it is not Melatonin_ but I am very sensitive to Melatonin and it has a similar reaction on the brain_ so if you are too_you might want to ask your Dr for a lower dose or if you can cut it in half.,,F,51,1  days8mg,5/1/2015,Rozerem

12, 1, To help me sleep,Horrible sleeplessness because I started itching and itching and itching.  It was like being hypnotized but my mind would not shut off.  I did eventually fall asleep but would wake up every 15 -30 minutes.  Horrible experience. now it's 1:30 a.m. and I am wide awake!,,F,59,1  days 1X D,12/24/2013Email,Rozerem

And it prevented me from falling asleep.,I can't remember what the dosage was.Why is this crap so expensive?!  It was a worthless waste of big money!  Months after the first try_ I tried it a second time_ just to make sure it wasn't just a fluke_ but the second try was just as bad as the first.I only tried it because it's touted as non-addictive - well_ of course you won't get addicted to something that DOES NOT WORK!,F,42,2  times 1X AN,11/2/2013,Rozerem

18, 3, Insomnia,Took rozerem for the first time last night. Will also (most likely) be the last. Did its job_ was sound asleep in 15 minutes. Also had nightmares. Woke up every hour or so_ but easy to fall back asleep. When sleeping it was sound sleep. Also was very paranoid about 5am that somebody was breaking into my home. Quite groggy today as well. Not sure of paranoia is a common side effect or not. I am normally somewhat paranoid so it may have just increased that. But it did its job in putting me to sleep right away!,,M,26,1  days8mg,6/18/2012,Rozerem
19, 1, Insomnia,Horrible.  Did not have hallucinations or panic attacks but it did not work at all!  Was afraid to take additional 8 mg since it appeared it would make me feel worse  according to other reviews.,Did not work last night (slept maybe 3-4 hours fitfully) from around 4 am and was wise awake at 7 am_ no drowsiness the next day!  No weird reactions_ crap just did nothing!  Ended up taking 18 mg of Silenor for 1st time (just got samples); 2 doses of Benadryl (more than 4 hours apart)_ Ibuprofen_ 9 mg of Melatonin and 1 mg of Klonopin_ and still no sleeop!  Silenor sucks_ too!  Have also tried Trazedone_ Restoril_ Seroquel_ other trycyclics_ Lunesta_ and Ambien.  Beginning to think Benadryl and Melatonin work better!  Am ready to try a barbituate-based sleep medicine if my Dr. will give me a few for a few nights of sleep!  Only slept 2 out of the last 8 nights_ constantly woke up but was at least able to get back to sleep those 2 nights.  Usually cannot fall asleeo or wake up after 1 1/2 -2 hours and stay awake.  I am on Medicaid_ so at least I did not pay much for this worthless junk. No wonder they don't advertise for it anymore!,F,42,1  days8 mg 1X D,3/31/2012Email,Rozerem
20, 2, Insomnia,Rozerem did not work consistently. Some nights it helped me get a few hrs. of sleep other nights not at all. I also noticed vivid dreams and fatigue the next day like many other people. I haven't found a sleep med. that works well for me yet! I wonder why one can't be developed that works better? So many of us seem to have sleep problems.,,F,48,10  days8 MG,3/19/2012,Rozerem

When i get to sleep i usaully can stay asleep_ but when i took this drug i woke up to an old man standing in front of me in the middle of the damn night. He made a suprized face and dissapeared into thin air. Im not sure why this happend_ but it creeped me out a little. I was able to get to sleep though.,M,16,3  days8 MG 7X W,2/28/2012Email,Rozerem

30, 1, Insomnia_ trouble sleeping,Paranoid the next day_ drowsy; tired feeling morning after_ horrible nightmares_ did not help with sleep.,This felt like nothing more than Melatonin. It took me forever to fall asleep and when I finally did I had this awful nightmare. I woke up in tears and was paranoid the rest of the day. This drug was as effective as eating a skittle before bed and beaming a horror movie into my head_ except skittles at least taste good. I wouldn't recommend this.,F,19,1  days8 MG 1X D,1/26/2011,Rozerem
31, 1, Insomnia,"Difficulty falling and staying asleep_ ""horrible"" nightmares and hallucinations_ sleep paralysis_ tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) and lethargy the next day.","I normally take Ambien_ which works well_ but wanted to try the Rozerem because it was my understanding that it was much milder than Ambien.  I only took it for one night_ but I am absolutely terrified to take it again!  I had the worst nightmares that I have ever had in my life_ and was imagining people/demons in my room!  I almost always know I'm dreaming_ and this was no exception; but this time_ I was ""trying""  very hard to wake up or move and couldn't!  The next day_ I had a rapid heartbeat and difficulty staying awake and alert at work.",F,41,1  days 1X D,1/7/2011,Rozerem
32, 1, Insomnia,No side effects at all.,Like everyone else on here_ I too was told that this drug would take 7 - 10 days to begin to work.  I have been very patient and have been taking it with the same nightly routine for over 30 days now.  No effect at all.  I took Ambien in the past until I switched to Rozerem and I regret making the switch.  Rozerem does absolutely NOTHING.  I eventually had to up my Ambien to two pills per night and occassionally 3 to get it to work but it would work.  Rozerem does nothing and may make it harder to sleep than without any drug.  3 to 4 hours to get to sleep.,M,43,30  days8 mg 1X D,1/5/2011Email,Rozerem
33, 1, Insomnia_ trouble sleeping,Very Very bad headaches.  Vivid scary dreams.  didn't get full nights sleep.  woke up often,I was prescribed this drug because of insomnia from detoxing off of alcohol.  The onset of action could be felt after about an hour_ so I tried to take it at least an hour before bed.  I fell asleep_ but found myself waking up frequently and in the morning_ each time I had hangover type feelings.  I was prescribed this drug because it is 'non' habit forming.  I will no longer take it...Ill read a book at night instead.,M,37,3  days 1X D,12/4/2010,Rozerem
34, 1, have trouble falling asleep,I have not had any side effects,After reading the posts I see why I can't fall asleep like I do on the other sleep aids u have to take this with time. Yeah not gonna work I thought this pill was just a placebo. I was on the other one lunesta or whatever I have the generic ones so don't know exact names. I like the other one cause it makes me sleepy and have no groggy feeling in the morning. I take the sleep pills because I have adhd and take meds for that and if I take it too late then I have trouble sleeping and to make matters worse I work till 10pm and I'm tired when I get home but not sleepy takes me at least till 1-2am to get relaxed enough to sleep but I think the pill is a placebo and I told my Dr that. I do have a reasonably high tolerance for any pill. When I was in the hospital for my heart surgery_ the staff was just amazed how high it is and I'm not a drug addict. Just for some reason pills don't effect me like others. Been on the highest dose of Vicodin and felt every bit of pain with no relief at all just made me sick same goes for percoset I can take so many and no pain relief just sick to my stomach. Going back to my other sleeping pills,F,29,2  days8ml 1X D,11/9/2010Email,Rozerem
35, 5, Insomnia,As far as side effects the only thing I experienced was dry throat and eyes upon waking up_ more so than usual.,I'm not sure the dosage I took_ but I was told by the doctor that ROZEREM is not a one time sleep aid like AMBIEN. It contains melatonin and will help you get better sleep over time. After taking it for two weeks I was sleeping a lot better. I fell asleep quicker_ didn't wake up at night and slept longer. I don't suffer from fatigue like I did and I've got more energy during the day. It works great for me_ but I've read a few reviews of people who don't like it. My advice_ Follow the directions and read about the drug before you take it.,M,33,30  days 1X D,10/24/2010Email,Rozerem
36, 1, insomnia,,also the benzodiazepams are GABA agonists...the GABA receptors are inhibitory and are also activated by non benzo drugs (ambien) as well...so their are many receptors that can be responsible for insomnia....,M,47, 8 mg 1X D,9/21/2010EmailHistory,Rozerem

38, 4, chronic insomnia,some headaches initially; eventually passed.,Ramelteon is NOT the same as taking melatonin.  Melatonin is a hormone that affects many things and that's what hormones are; chemicals that ACTIVATE things (not just sleep way cycle).  Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist that only activates M1 and M2 receptors-which are the only two that affect sleep.  If you take melatonin_ you are affecting many systems.  Ramelteon only effects sleep-wake cycle.  That is why you cannot take high doses of melatonin without causing potentially life threatening reactions.,F,36,3  months8 mg 1X D,9/10/2010,Rozerem
39, 1, Insomnia,Night Terrors_ Insomnia,I had very little sleep on this medication.  The sleep I did have was restless with very real dreams/nightmares.  Do NOT recommend.,M,36,  1X D,7/27/2010,Rozerem
40, 2, Insomnia,Nausea; ear ringing; weakness; cough; strange dreams,"I understand from my doctor that Rozerem takes 10-12 days to ""re-set"" your body clock.  I was prepared for that.  The first 2 days_ I did fall asleep promptly; woke up 2-4 hours later; returned to sleep & woke up for good another 2-3 hours later.  However_ the side effects are off-putting. Before Rozerem_ I was briefly on Ambien & Valium for insomnia/anxiety/to relax my back muscles.  They & Rozerem all made me nauseous_ depressed & anxious the next day.  Ambien first gave me dreams; then night terrors.  By night 2 of Rozerem_ I was dreaming that I was talking to the President - just like in the commercials.  Very weird.  Then I was hearing my cell phone ringtone when it wasn't ringing.  And I got a cough in the middle of 90+ degree summer days.  The cough may be a coincidence_ but the rest isn't.",F,45,2  days8 mg 1X D,7/16/2010Email,Rozerem
41, 5, Insomnia,Not sure what side effects I have since I started 4 medications at one time,I take 100 trazodone_ 50 mg Imipramine_ .50 xanax and 8 mg Rozerem every night. I wake up usually 2 to 3 times a night but usually get 5 hours straight sleep. Also I read in my oxygen magazine 1000 mg of calcium and 500 of magnesium would help too. It does seem to help.,F,37,2  years8 mg 1X D,7/5/2010Email,Rozerem
42, 5, Insomnia_ newly sober,Other than a bit of a headache and fatigue I feel great.  I can't believe all of the comments on here about so many side affects...I have ZERO...sleep great and wake up refreshed just like this drug promises....if it's just uber-melotonin then why would people feel angry or suicidal???  Me thinks people invent things to stay sick or a victim so as not fully participate in life or address the real issues.,Great drug!!  You must go to bed_ turn off tv_ turn off lights_ etc. and THEN the drug takes over...otherwise you could mow the yard or vacuum your house...you HAVE TO GO TO BED for this drug to work!!,F,49,6  weeks8MG 1X D,6/10/2010,Rozerem
43, 1, Chronic insomnia,Took the pill at about 9:30 or 10pm...back up several times up for good at 2am and could not go back to sleep until my alarm went off at 5am.,"I was told that this drug is to ""reset my sleep clock"" and that it may take some time.  I don't have time.  I need a drug that will work.  A drug that will put me to sleep and make me stay asleep.  I want my life back.  I want naps on the weekends and to be able to sleep till 9 in the morning when I can.  I need 20mgs of ambien but for obvious reasons_ no doctor will prescribe me that much.  I just want to sleep all night and get up in the morning and be rested and not have to guzzle 2 cups of strong coffee and a red bull before 10am.",F,36,2  days8 1X D,6/10/2010Email,Rozerem
44, 1, chronic insomnia,Waking up more than normal.  Bad dream last night.  Went to bed at 9:45 woke up at 12:15.  Headaches_ groggy as hell.  Look like hell. Big dark bags under eyes.,Stepping down Xanax and was ASSURED this crap would help me stay asleep.  Been up more the past 2 nights than just having insomnia.  Dreams were bad.  Was actually thinking of doubling the dose on my own but I'd rather go back to the Benzo's and get a good night's sleep then deal with the withdrawal some other time.  This stuff sucks and is expensive.  Will wait for GNC to deliver my Melatonin and will check back to let you know if that works.,M,51,2  days8 mg 1X D,5/7/2010,Rozerem
45, 1, Lack of sleep,flu like symptoms(lots of internal body heat)_  vivid scary dreams_ extreme anger out of the blue_ suicidal thoughts_ horrible depression_ increased heartrate_ feeling of throat constricting.,My doctor told me to take this but the side effects are the worst ever. I had really creepy vivid dreams. I would wake up 3 hours after taking it _ fell back asleep and felt bad the whole day. I had a constant feeling that my body was really internally hot. My throat felt constricted. I felt like dying. Then I visited my parants and out of the blue I started a horrible argument_ with me being very angry and saying horrific things I would NEVER unless I was out of control_ which I felt like. When I got home I realized that I am never like that _ and my body felt extremely hot_ I could feel my heart pounding really fast_ my throat was feeling very constricting and I could tell this was not normal at all. I immediately went to look at the side effects of the medicine online and realized the cause_ because that argument was not me_ it was like some angry new person had arrived. I immediately apologized and explained the situation to my parents by the way. I would not reccomend this medication_ I'm sticking to over the counter melatonin.,M,19,7  days8 mg 1X D,3/16/2010,Rozerem
46, 5, Chronic Insomnia,Vivid dreams_ but no nightmares,Started taking Rozerem after AmbienCR stopped working.  Doctor explained this med is to be taken nightly & gains efficacy over time.  This explains why it didn't initially work for me.  After 1 to 1-1/2 mos. it began to work.  I now fall asleep within 15-20 minutes & if I wake during night I'm able to get back to sleep.  So_ the bottom line is that I still wake up during the night_ but my sleep is MUCH better; more consistent and more restful.  I will continue to take Rozerem.  If you're going to try this_ take it nightly & give it time to work for you.,F,49,6  months 1X D,3/12/2010,Rozerem

I thought the dreams now are pretty cool_  but at the time I was afraid to wake up `cause of me being so  frightened. I had to really concentrate on going to the bathroom and as embarrasing as this sounds before taking this no problem and after taking it i had a problem going number one. all the other symptoms are listed above_ and ya thats all for now_ I dont recommend this_ I will stick to my natural remedies for sleep aides_ I feel bad and sorry for everyone experiencing bad problems with this drug_ maybe you should go see an orthomolecular doctor.,F,23,4  days8 mg 1X D,3/8/2010Email,Rozerem
48, 1, 15-yr insomnia due to Fibromyalgia,Horrible nightmares_ restlessness_ feeling wired and anxious_ waking frequently and unable to go back to sleep_ difficulty falling asleep (normally not my problem)_ fatigue_ flu-like symptoms,I have been taking Lunesta for about 2 years but it stopped working well.  I tried Sonata for 1 month and found out it is great for falling asleep but not staying asleep.  I have issues with staying asleep_ but usually fall asleep pretty easily.  The first night I fell asleep well but woke even more than usual and had more trouble getting back to sleep.  The following day I felt like I was getting the flu and felt anxious and restless.  The next night I was drowsy before taking it_ but after it kicked in I could not get to sleep and felt restless and wired.  When I finally did_ I woke up with horrific_ vivid nightmares that I am still shaking from 3 hours later.  I also feel extremely anxious and tearful and rather emotionally unstable.  I do not have any psychiatric problems normally.  I would stay FAR away from this drug and my bottle is going in the trash tonight.,F,34,2  days8 mg 1X D,2/26/2010Email,Rozerem

VERY vivid dreams--some of which were about me being in bed and not being able to sleep or move. Others were nightmares--strange_ strange nightmares. I did not fall asleep that fast--maybe after about two hours. The next day I had a slight headache and a bit of a hingover feeling.

57, 5, chronic insomnia,None,I have been on Ambien for 15 years.  I have a lot of sleep eating and amnesia the next day.  I cannot fall asleep.  My doctor advised that Rozerem would not work for two weeks_ so I took an Ambien CR with the Rozerem the first two weeks.  After two weeks_ I tried to go to sleep with just the Rozerem but couldn't.  I then tried taking a 5mg. Ambien with the Rozerem and fell asleep right away.  I will do this for two weeks and then attempt the Rozerem by itself again.  I'm so excited to get off the Ambien so I can remember my actions.  I have tried every other sleep aid there is_ and have never fallen asleep with them.,F,54,18  days,11/13/2009,Rozerem
58, 1, long-term insomnia,I finally fell asleep 5 or 6 hours after taking the drug and slept about 3 hours.  When I woke up I felt extremely drugged_ confused and felt like I existed in a fog.   I didn't dare drive my car.  Then the depression began.  It became worse and worse and suddenly I began having frightening suicidal thoughts.  I occasionally have short bouts of mild depression but do not need medication and have never felt depression like this or had suicidal thoughts.  I only made it through the day by reminding myself over and over that it was just the drug and it would wear off.  By evening I felt quite a bit better.  I would never_ ever use this drug again.  I feel it is an extremely dangerous drug and should be pulled from the market.  Where on earth is the FDA?  Do they really check anything out?  If I hadn't been a strong willed and rational person_ I actually believe that I might have killed myself.,,F,66,1  days,10/30/2009,Rozerem
59, 1, insomnia/trouble falling asleep and,OMG!  Anxiety_ depression_ EXTREME sadness_ suicidal thoughts_ hyper-sensativity_ couldn't concentrate_ worse insomnia,I would NEVER take this drug again!  I realize everyone is different chemically_ but for me it was almost suicide.  I wasn't sure what was happening to me so I thought about the fact that I had been on Rozerem for 5 to 6 weeks.  It actually worked at first for the insomnia.  Little by little I started noticing me going down hill and I just didn't know why.  I do have clinical depression and as long as I take my antidepressant I'm fine.  I recognized the signs and wondered what the heck was going on.  The ONLY thing different in my life was Rozerem.  I went off of it 5 days ago_ felt HORRIBLE for 2 days post_ depression started lifting 3 days post_ now I am back to normal.  If you have ANY type of clinical depression or major depressive disorder I would say STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG!!!  It almost caused a breakup in my relationship with my partner and last but not least_ ruined my sex drive.  I wouldn't take this drug again if I was paid to take it.  I am convinced that it was doing something to my hormone levels_ somehow_ some way.  I AM in the medical field but can't figure this one out.  I really thought it was just an innocent_ natural sleep aid_ and apparently so did my doc.  Just one more detail_ I am also a recovering alcoholic and haven't touched alcohol for years.  I was EXTREMELY close to drinking to get rid of the HORRIBLE depression_ sadness_ and anxiety.,F,55,6  weeks,10/26/2009Email,Rozerem
