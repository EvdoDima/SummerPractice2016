4, 4, Chronic Insomnia,I never review medications after taking them 1x -you need to take something for awhile to know how it affects you ( unless you are allergic /have adverse reaction ) _ but I have tried Rozerem a few times in the past and had the same experience. It helps me sleep soundly w/o vivid dreams like I have on Melatonin. I was woken up once in the night by my dog and found it was a little hard to walk at first-like being drunk-but after a minute or two it was ok. I went back to sleep easily -never happens for me. I was tired the next day. I do remember now that when I used this med in the past I often cut it in half and I wasn't tired the next day that way. I know it is not Melatonin_ but I am very sensitive to Melatonin and it has a similar reaction on the brain_ so if you are too_you might want to ask your Dr for a lower dose or if you can cut it in half.,,F,51,1  days8mg,5/1/2015,Rozerem

12, 1, To help me sleep,Horrible sleeplessness because I started itching and itching and itching.  It was like being hypnotized but my mind would not shut off.  I did eventually fall asleep but would wake up every 15 -30 minutes.  Horrible experience. now it's 1:30 a.m. and I am wide awake!,,F,59,1  days 1X D,12/24/2013Email,Rozerem

And it prevented me from falling asleep.,I can't remember what the dosage was.Why is this crap so expensive?!  It was a worthless waste of big money!  Months after the first try_ I tried it a second time_ just to make sure it wasn't just a fluke_ but the second try was just as bad as the first.I only tried it because it's touted as non-addictive - well_ of course you won't get addicted to something that DOES NOT WORK!,F,42,2  times 1X AN,11/2/2013,Rozerem

18, 3, Insomnia,Took rozerem for the first time last night. Will also (most likely) be the last. Did its job_ was sound asleep in 15 minutes. Also had nightmares. Woke up every hour or so_ but easy to fall back asleep. When sleeping it was sound sleep. Also was very paranoid about 5am that somebody was breaking into my home. Quite groggy today as well. Not sure of paranoia is a common side effect or not. I am normally somewhat paranoid so it may have just increased that. But it did its job in putting me to sleep right away!,,M,26,1  days8mg,6/18/2012,Rozerem
19, 1, Insomnia,Horrible.  Did not have hallucinations or panic attacks but it did not work at all!  Was afraid to take additional 8 mg since it appeared it would make me feel worse  according to other reviews.,Did not work last night (slept maybe 3-4 hours fitfully) from around 4 am and was wise awake at 7 am_ no drowsiness the next day!  No weird reactions_ crap just did nothing!  Ended up taking 18 mg of Silenor for 1st time (just got samples); 2 doses of Benadryl (more than 4 hours apart)_ Ibuprofen_ 9 mg of Melatonin and 1 mg of Klonopin_ and still no sleeop!  Silenor sucks_ too!  Have also tried Trazedone_ Restoril_ Seroquel_ other trycyclics_ Lunesta_ and Ambien.  Beginning to think Benadryl and Melatonin work better!  Am ready to try a barbituate-based sleep medicine if my Dr. will give me a few for a few nights of sleep!  Only slept 2 out of the last 8 nights_ constantly woke up but was at least able to get back to sleep those 2 nights.  Usually cannot fall asleeo or wake up after 1 1/2 -2 hours and stay awake.  I am on Medicaid_ so at least I did not pay much for this worthless junk. No wonder they don't advertise for it anymore!,F,42,1  days8 mg 1X D,3/31/2012Email,Rozerem
20, 2, Insomnia,Rozerem did not work consistently. Some nights it helped me get a few hrs. of sleep other nights not at all. I also noticed vivid dreams and fatigue the next day like many other people. I haven't found a sleep med. that works well for me yet! I wonder why one can't be developed that works better? So many of us seem to have sleep problems.,,F,48,10  days8 MG,3/19/2012,Rozerem

When i get to sleep i usaully can stay asleep_ but when i took this drug i woke up to an old man standing in front of me in the middle of the damn night. He made a suprized face and dissapeared into thin air. Im not sure why this happend_ but it creeped me out a little. I was able to get to sleep though.,M,16,3  days8 MG 7X W,2/28/2012Email,Rozerem

30, 1, Insomnia_ trouble sleeping,Paranoid the next day_ drowsy; tired feeling morning after_ horrible nightmares_ did not help with sleep.,This felt like nothing more than Melatonin. It took me forever to fall asleep and when I finally did I had this awful nightmare. I woke up in tears and was paranoid the rest of the day. This drug was as effective as eating a skittle before bed and beaming a horror movie into my head_ except skittles at least taste good. I wouldn't recommend this.,F,19,1  days8 MG 1X D,1/26/2011,Rozerem
31, 1, Insomnia,"Difficulty falling and staying asleep_ ""horrible"" nightmares and hallucinations_ sleep paralysis_ tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) and lethargy the next day.","I normally take Ambien_ which works well_ but wanted to try the Rozerem because it was my understanding that it was much milder than Ambien.  I only took it for one night_ but I am absolutely terrified to take it again!  I had the worst nightmares that I have ever had in my life_ and was imagining people/demons in my room!  I almost always know I'm dreaming_ and this was no exception; but this time_ I was ""trying""  very hard to wake up or move and couldn't!  The next day_ I had a rapid heartbeat and difficulty staying awake and alert at work.",F,41,1  days 1X D,1/7/2011,Rozerem
32, 1, Insomnia,No side effects at all.,Like everyone else on here_ I too was told that this drug would take 7 - 10 days to begin to work.  I have been very patient and have been taking it with the same nightly routine for over 30 days now.  No effect at all.  I took Ambien in the past until I switched to Rozerem and I regret making the switch.  Rozerem does absolutely NOTHING.  I eventually had to up my Ambien to two pills per night and occassionally 3 to get it to work but it would work.  Rozerem does nothing and may make it harder to sleep than without any drug.  3 to 4 hours to get to sleep.,M,43,30  days8 mg 1X D,1/5/2011Email,Rozerem
33, 1, Insomnia_ trouble sleeping,Very Very bad headaches.  Vivid scary dreams.  didn't get full nights sleep.  woke up often,I was prescribed this drug because of insomnia from detoxing off of alcohol.  The onset of action could be felt after about an hour_ so I tried to take it at least an hour before bed.  I fell asleep_ but found myself waking up frequently and in the morning_ each time I had hangover type feelings.  I was prescribed this drug because it is 'non' habit forming.  I will no longer take it...Ill read a book at night instead.,M,37,3  days 1X D,12/4/2010,Rozerem
34, 1, have trouble falling asleep,I have not had any side effects,After reading the posts I see why I can't fall asleep like I do on the other sleep aids u have to take this with time. Yeah not gonna work I thought this pill was just a placebo. I was on the other one lunesta or whatever I have the generic ones so don't know exact names. I like the other one cause it makes me sleepy and have no groggy feeling in the morning. I take the sleep pills because I have adhd and take meds for that and if I take it too late then I have trouble sleeping and to make matters worse I work till 10pm and I'm tired when I get home but not sleepy takes me at least till 1-2am to get relaxed enough to sleep but I think the pill is a placebo and I told my Dr that. I do have a reasonably high tolerance for any pill. When I was in the hospital for my heart surgery_ the staff was just amazed how high it is and I'm not a drug addict. Just for some reason pills don't effect me like others. Been on the highest dose of Vicodin and felt every bit of pain with no relief at all just made me sick same goes for percoset I can take so many and no pain relief just sick to my stomach. Going back to my other sleeping pills,F,29,2  days8ml 1X D,11/9/2010Email,Rozerem
35, 5, Insomnia,As far as side effects the only thing I experienced was dry throat and eyes upon waking up_ more so than usual.,I'm not sure the dosage I took_ but I was told by the doctor that ROZEREM is not a one time sleep aid like AMBIEN. It contains melatonin and will help you get better sleep over time. After taking it for two weeks I was sleeping a lot better. I fell asleep quicker_ didn't wake up at night and slept longer. I don't suffer from fatigue like I did and I've got more energy during the day. It works great for me_ but I've read a few reviews of people who don't like it. My advice_ Follow the directions and read about the drug before you take it.,M,33,30  days 1X D,10/24/2010Email,Rozerem
36, 1, insomnia,,also the benzodiazepams are GABA agonists...the GABA receptors are inhibitory and are also activated by non benzo drugs (ambien) as well...so their are many receptors that can be responsible for insomnia....,M,47, 8 mg 1X D,9/21/2010EmailHistory,Rozerem

38, 4, chronic insomnia,some headaches initially; eventually passed.,Ramelteon is NOT the same as taking melatonin.  Melatonin is a hormone that affects many things and that's what hormones are; chemicals that ACTIVATE things (not just sleep way cycle).  Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist that only activates M1 and M2 receptors-which are the only two that affect sleep.  If you take melatonin_ you are affecting many systems.  Ramelteon only effects sleep-wake cycle.  That is why you cannot take high doses of melatonin without causing potentially life threatening reactions.,F,36,3  months8 mg 1X D,9/10/2010,Rozerem
39, 1, Insomnia,Night Terrors_ Insomnia,I had very little sleep on this medication.  The sleep I did have was restless with very real dreams/nightmares.  Do NOT recommend.,M,36,  1X D,7/27/2010,Rozerem
40, 2, Insomnia,Nausea; ear ringing; weakness; cough; strange dreams,"I understand from my doctor that Rozerem takes 10-12 days to ""re-set"" your body clock.  I was prepared for that.  The first 2 days_ I did fall asleep promptly; woke up 2-4 hours later; returned to sleep & woke up for good another 2-3 hours later.  However_ the side effects are off-putting. Before Rozerem_ I was briefly on Ambien & Valium for insomnia/anxiety/to relax my back muscles.  They & Rozerem all made me nauseous_ depressed & anxious the next day.  Ambien first gave me dreams; then night terrors.  By night 2 of Rozerem_ I was dreaming that I was talking to the President - just like in the commercials.  Very weird.  Then I was hearing my cell phone ringtone when it wasn't ringing.  And I got a cough in the middle of 90+ degree summer days.  The cough may be a coincidence_ but the rest isn't.",F,45,2  days8 mg 1X D,7/16/2010Email,Rozerem
41, 5, Insomnia,Not sure what side effects I have since I started 4 medications at one time,I take 100 trazodone_ 50 mg Imipramine_ .50 xanax and 8 mg Rozerem every night. I wake up usually 2 to 3 times a night but usually get 5 hours straight sleep. Also I read in my oxygen magazine 1000 mg of calcium and 500 of magnesium would help too. It does seem to help.,F,37,2  years8 mg 1X D,7/5/2010Email,Rozerem
42, 5, Insomnia_ newly sober,Other than a bit of a headache and fatigue I feel great.  I can't believe all of the comments on here about so many side affects...I have ZERO...sleep great and wake up refreshed just like this drug promises....if it's just uber-melotonin then why would people feel angry or suicidal???  Me thinks people invent things to stay sick or a victim so as not fully participate in life or address the real issues.,Great drug!!  You must go to bed_ turn off tv_ turn off lights_ etc. and THEN the drug takes over...otherwise you could mow the yard or vacuum your house...you HAVE TO GO TO BED for this drug to work!!,F,49,6  weeks8MG 1X D,6/10/2010,Rozerem
43, 1, Chronic insomnia,Took the pill at about 9:30 or 10pm...back up several times up for good at 2am and could not go back to sleep until my alarm went off at 5am.,"I was told that this drug is to ""reset my sleep clock"" and that it may take some time.  I don't have time.  I need a drug that will work.  A drug that will put me to sleep and make me stay asleep.  I want my life back.  I want naps on the weekends and to be able to sleep till 9 in the morning when I can.  I need 20mgs of ambien but for obvious reasons_ no doctor will prescribe me that much.  I just want to sleep all night and get up in the morning and be rested and not have to guzzle 2 cups of strong coffee and a red bull before 10am.",F,36,2  days8 1X D,6/10/2010Email,Rozerem
44, 1, chronic insomnia,Waking up more than normal.  Bad dream last night.  Went to bed at 9:45 woke up at 12:15.  Headaches_ groggy as hell.  Look like hell. Big dark bags under eyes.,Stepping down Xanax and was ASSURED this crap would help me stay asleep.  Been up more the past 2 nights than just having insomnia.  Dreams were bad.  Was actually thinking of doubling the dose on my own but I'd rather go back to the Benzo's and get a good night's sleep then deal with the withdrawal some other time.  This stuff sucks and is expensive.  Will wait for GNC to deliver my Melatonin and will check back to let you know if that works.,M,51,2  days8 mg 1X D,5/7/2010,Rozerem
45, 1, Lack of sleep,flu like symptoms(lots of internal body heat)_  vivid scary dreams_ extreme anger out of the blue_ suicidal thoughts_ horrible depression_ increased heartrate_ feeling of throat constricting.,My doctor told me to take this but the side effects are the worst ever. I had really creepy vivid dreams. I would wake up 3 hours after taking it _ fell back asleep and felt bad the whole day. I had a constant feeling that my body was really internally hot. My throat felt constricted. I felt like dying. Then I visited my parants and out of the blue I started a horrible argument_ with me being very angry and saying horrific things I would NEVER unless I was out of control_ which I felt like. When I got home I realized that I am never like that _ and my body felt extremely hot_ I could feel my heart pounding really fast_ my throat was feeling very constricting and I could tell this was not normal at all. I immediately went to look at the side effects of the medicine online and realized the cause_ because that argument was not me_ it was like some angry new person had arrived. I immediately apologized and explained the situation to my parents by the way. I would not reccomend this medication_ I'm sticking to over the counter melatonin.,M,19,7  days8 mg 1X D,3/16/2010,Rozerem
46, 5, Chronic Insomnia,Vivid dreams_ but no nightmares,Started taking Rozerem after AmbienCR stopped working.  Doctor explained this med is to be taken nightly & gains efficacy over time.  This explains why it didn't initially work for me.  After 1 to 1-1/2 mos. it began to work.  I now fall asleep within 15-20 minutes & if I wake during night I'm able to get back to sleep.  So_ the bottom line is that I still wake up during the night_ but my sleep is MUCH better; more consistent and more restful.  I will continue to take Rozerem.  If you're going to try this_ take it nightly & give it time to work for you.,F,49,6  months 1X D,3/12/2010,Rozerem

I thought the dreams now are pretty cool_  but at the time I was afraid to wake up `cause of me being so  frightened. I had to really concentrate on going to the bathroom and as embarrasing as this sounds before taking this no problem and after taking it i had a problem going number one. all the other symptoms are listed above_ and ya thats all for now_ I dont recommend this_ I will stick to my natural remedies for sleep aides_ I feel bad and sorry for everyone experiencing bad problems with this drug_ maybe you should go see an orthomolecular doctor.,F,23,4  days8 mg 1X D,3/8/2010Email,Rozerem
48, 1, 15-yr insomnia due to Fibromyalgia,Horrible nightmares_ restlessness_ feeling wired and anxious_ waking frequently and unable to go back to sleep_ difficulty falling asleep (normally not my problem)_ fatigue_ flu-like symptoms,I have been taking Lunesta for about 2 years but it stopped working well.  I tried Sonata for 1 month and found out it is great for falling asleep but not staying asleep.  I have issues with staying asleep_ but usually fall asleep pretty easily.  The first night I fell asleep well but woke even more than usual and had more trouble getting back to sleep.  The following day I felt like I was getting the flu and felt anxious and restless.  The next night I was drowsy before taking it_ but after it kicked in I could not get to sleep and felt restless and wired.  When I finally did_ I woke up with horrific_ vivid nightmares that I am still shaking from 3 hours later.  I also feel extremely anxious and tearful and rather emotionally unstable.  I do not have any psychiatric problems normally.  I would stay FAR away from this drug and my bottle is going in the trash tonight.,F,34,2  days8 mg 1X D,2/26/2010Email,Rozerem

VERY vivid dreams--some of which were about me being in bed and not being able to sleep or move. Others were nightmares--strange_ strange nightmares. I did not fall asleep that fast--maybe after about two hours. The next day I had a slight headache and a bit of a hingover feeling.

57, 5, chronic insomnia,None,I have been on Ambien for 15 years.  I have a lot of sleep eating and amnesia the next day.  I cannot fall asleep.  My doctor advised that Rozerem would not work for two weeks_ so I took an Ambien CR with the Rozerem the first two weeks.  After two weeks_ I tried to go to sleep with just the Rozerem but couldn't.  I then tried taking a 5mg. Ambien with the Rozerem and fell asleep right away.  I will do this for two weeks and then attempt the Rozerem by itself again.  I'm so excited to get off the Ambien so I can remember my actions.  I have tried every other sleep aid there is_ and have never fallen asleep with them.,F,54,18  days,11/13/2009,Rozerem
58, 1, long-term insomnia,I finally fell asleep 5 or 6 hours after taking the drug and slept about 3 hours.  When I woke up I felt extremely drugged_ confused and felt like I existed in a fog.   I didn't dare drive my car.  Then the depression began.  It became worse and worse and suddenly I began having frightening suicidal thoughts.  I occasionally have short bouts of mild depression but do not need medication and have never felt depression like this or had suicidal thoughts.  I only made it through the day by reminding myself over and over that it was just the drug and it would wear off.  By evening I felt quite a bit better.  I would never_ ever use this drug again.  I feel it is an extremely dangerous drug and should be pulled from the market.  Where on earth is the FDA?  Do they really check anything out?  If I hadn't been a strong willed and rational person_ I actually believe that I might have killed myself.,,F,66,1  days,10/30/2009,Rozerem
59, 1, insomnia/trouble falling asleep and,OMG!  Anxiety_ depression_ EXTREME sadness_ suicidal thoughts_ hyper-sensativity_ couldn't concentrate_ worse insomnia,I would NEVER take this drug again!  I realize everyone is different chemically_ but for me it was almost suicide.  I wasn't sure what was happening to me so I thought about the fact that I had been on Rozerem for 5 to 6 weeks.  It actually worked at first for the insomnia.  Little by little I started noticing me going down hill and I just didn't know why.  I do have clinical depression and as long as I take my antidepressant I'm fine.  I recognized the signs and wondered what the heck was going on.  The ONLY thing different in my life was Rozerem.  I went off of it 5 days ago_ felt HORRIBLE for 2 days post_ depression started lifting 3 days post_ now I am back to normal.  If you have ANY type of clinical depression or major depressive disorder I would say STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG!!!  It almost caused a breakup in my relationship with my partner and last but not least_ ruined my sex drive.  I wouldn't take this drug again if I was paid to take it.  I am convinced that it was doing something to my hormone levels_ somehow_ some way.  I AM in the medical field but can't figure this one out.  I really thought it was just an innocent_ natural sleep aid_ and apparently so did my doc.  Just one more detail_ I am also a recovering alcoholic and haven't touched alcohol for years.  I was EXTREMELY close to drinking to get rid of the HORRIBLE depression_ sadness_ and anxiety.,F,55,6  weeks,10/26/2009Email,Rozerem
60, 2, insomnia,Feeling only half asleep - increase in fasting glucose.,I had very high hopes for this drug since my doctor told me that it is safe to take every night (I have had chronic insomnia for most of my life).  First of all_ I want to agree with those who mention a hung over feeling the next day.  I would feel drowsy and drained (not much different from when I didn't sleep at all).  I WOULD sleep with Rozerem but it was a creepy_ half-asleep feeling - almost as if part of me was sleeping while the other part was wide awake and watching myself sleep. This has never happened with any other sleep aid.  I have impaired fasting glucose and I monitor every morning to be sure I have it controlled (diet and exercise work for me). So_ it is a HUGE issue for me that every night that I took Rozerem_ my fasting glucose level would be extremely high in the morning.  No Rozerum: normal glucose.  I think this could be quite a dangerous drug - I went back to Ambien!,M,57,20  days,10/10/2009,Rozerem
61, 1, Insomnia,Anger_ having realized that this is nothing more than Melatonin.,Let me start by stating that I'm a clinical nutritionist and know exactly what I'm talking about. I have moreover researched this subject extensively. Rozerem is nothing more than an over-glorified_ highly-concentrated melatonin_ do NOT waste your time or money on this. Just go to a reputable health food store_ and purchase a reputable 3 mg Melatonin formula. Look for one that included B6 for absorption. Start with 3 tablets nightly (9 mg) the first week_ decrease to 2 the 2nd week (6 mg)_ and finally to one by week three. Your day/light cycle will be significantly restored and you will have saved a ton of cash in the process.,M,36, ,10/4/2009,Rozerem

But I think I had better advice from my doctor: Give it time_ let it work. Now I sleep 7 - 8 hours most nights instead of 4 like the last 30 years.  I still have one or two nights a week when I sleep less but still more than 4.  I'll take a little sleepiness during the day in exchange. I find if I nap for 10 - 20 minutes even that goes away.  Napping is also a blessing; I could never sleep during the day before. Plus I love the vivid dreams.  Very entertaining. My advice is unless you are having dangerous side effects then give it a month.,F,47,6  months,9/1/2009,Rozerem

I believe I got some relief from fatigue in the first 3 months but there has been no progression in sleep duration.  And_ I realized I was drowsy and mildly ""tipsy"" long after awakening.  I stopped the drug because of the drowsy after effects.  I have not taken Rozerem for 5 nights and my sleep is about the same as with it.  I feel ""sharper"" mentally without the drug.

All that other stuff I was taking dulled all my senses for about 4 hours after waking.  I still do stuff without knowing I did it_ though_ on both ends going into sleep and coming out of it.,"Intensifies problems already having - up and down all night after brief_ non-restful 2 hours.  Horrid nightmares over and over through partial sleep periods - like someone here describes as ""having a high fever"". It makes you feel like that all the time - day and night; also agitated and intensifies anxiety.  Skipped my first period in 38 years and no interest at all in my man. It's getting better as time goes on though_ and it's last chance so I hope it works.  Have tried everything mentioned here plus herbals for months each because I've had insomnia so many years - trazedone_ trypto something_ valerians_ lunesta_ ambien & generics ambienCR_ and two other the Dr's said were for ""anxiety stressed war veterans"".  All of those either knocked me out for 3 days like anesthetic_ or didn't do a darn thing but fog my mind.  Actually_ low dosage of Benadryl and Advil combined works as well as this stuff (see your Dr.) Ambien had worked great for awhile & then stopped totally.  This drug seems a lot like Lunesta_ & isn't much different than my own bad sleep pattern - and behavioral modification doesn't work w/some medical conditions. This could work in time_ but I'd rather be knocked out; prefer switching back and forth from Ambien to Lunesta.

As the day went along I lost all attention span and ability to think or analyze properly. Very depressed type fellings.  Just terrible overall feeling.  I normally do not take naps during the day but I had become so tired that I had to.  During the two hours I was asleep I experienced some of the worst nightmares and hallucinations I have ever experienced and found it very hard to wake up from it.

I think my success for using this drug is because I am a drug rep for the company and understand how Rozerem works. There is a ""right way"" and a ""wrong way"" to take it. I knew not to expect a feeling of sedation (like other sleep aids) and I also practice good ""sleep hygiene""_ because treating insomnia has to be a lifestyle change. This is how to take it... I take my Rozerem about 9:30pm (30 min before I need to go to bed)_ take a warm shower_ turn off the tv/computer/lights_ and do anything else to prepare for bed. Then it's lights out! If you expect to be sedated_ then you will certainly be disappointed. If you are searching for a way to sleep more normally (and not mask the problem)_ it will require a little patience and effort_ but it's well worth the outcome!

Extremely bad experience. I had bad headache and eye ache when I did wake up. After an hour of being awake had to lay back down and slept most of the day since I was not really functional. Feel out of sorts_ groggy_ and arms and legs feel heavy. Mild stomach upset.,This medication took a few hours before I felt sleepy.Finally went to sleep 2 hours after taking medication (11pm) and finally  could wake up at (7:30-8:00am) but had to lay down and slept again until 1:30pm.

I have felt absolutely no side effects (and I am someone who often experiences side effects) and have been completely satisfied with this drug. It might be of note that I take this along with Lexapro_ which I also completely endorse.  To be fair_ the Lexapro probably reduced my anxiety and depression levels enough to allow for the Rozerem to work_ but my sleep cycle was so disturbed by my PTSD_ that even as I began to get that under control_ I still could not sleep at all at night- until the Rozerem. I've had a couple nights over the last few days where I didn't need the Rozerem at all_ so just skipped it and had no problems with that_ either.

We're not supposed to feel drugged when falling asleep_ just drift off to sleep. Like a lot of patients_ I was a little disappointed in the first week because I didn't sleep at all!

To fall asleep the fastest and feel tired the longest it can be taken after a ""fatty"" meal.  The fats increase the sedative effects.  Only problem is that when used like this it results in a fatigue that can last well into the next day so its best done when you don't need to do anything the next day.  Insomnia and frequent waking returned about five days into the regimen even whan taken as directed (away from fatty meals).  Resulted in some irritability and sedative efects never came back after first week.

(stupid me.)At the recommended dose I experienced very few or no side effects.,"It is extremely important to note that Rozerem is different than any other sleep medicine; (as mentioned in another comment_ Rozerem is not a ""knock-out"" drug!) it is designed to re-set your circadian rhythm to a normal ""night=sleep"" ""day=awake"" routine. Think ""super-melatonin"". It is vital to understand that this re-setting of the ""body-clock"" is a gradual process_ sometimes requiring weeks of consistent_ daily therapy. It should be taken at EXACTLY the same time every night_ without fail; pick a realistic bedtime and stick to it! For Rozerem to be successful as an insomnia therapy it must be used with a high degree of patience.Note: If you have recently taken Ambien_ Lunesta_ Sonata_ et al._ Rozerem will not work right away_ since withdrawal (rebound insomnia) from stopping these other sleep meds can persist for 7-14 days.

159, 4, Staying Asleep,I would usually fall asleep_ but then wake up every two hours and have trouble going back to sleep. Rozerem was a miracle after trying Ambien_ Lunesta_ etc._ even Melatonin. I was becoming anxious and depressed. I slept really well for the first time in two years!  The only problem is that I wanted to sleep all the next day as well! Fortunately it was Saturday. Perhaps this was because my body needed sleep so badly.  Will try half a tablet and see if its better. None of the negative reactions mentioned by others.,,M,57,2  days,3/23/2008,Rozerem
160, 1, Sleeping issues,I took the 8mg pill_ and went to bed like normal (LATE). I woke up more frequently during the night_ and felt drugged in the morning. Tried half the pill next night. Same problems.,I only tried it cause they said it doesn't have those side effects. All I wanted was to get to bed at a decent hour_ sleep well_ and not feel hungover in the morning. Didn't help me at all.,F,29,4  days,3/22/2008Email,Rozerem

162, 1, insomnia,I came online to check out the side effects of Rozerem and found this website and found 80 other people who were having the same side effects I was! I not only hardly feel asleep_ but was also wide awake most of the night staring at a dark ceiling_ the next day I felt awful_ was fatiqued and just felt miserable_ and that was after taking it only 1 night. I just thought it was from lack of sleep_ but I've had sleepless nights before and never felt that bad the next day_ now I realize it was the Rozerem. Like everyone else_ my doc said to give it some time to work_ but after 4 days_ and after reading everyone else's bad experiences_ I'm through with Rozerem. I'll go back to Ambiem_ Lunesta_ or Tylonal PM...I'd rather take nothing than ever take Rozerem again.,,F,58,4  days,3/17/2008,Rozerem
163, 1, Insomnia,None,Horrible. The drug is worthless and did nothing. I have taken the drug for the last 3 nights because Lunesta was losing its affect and my doctor said that he could rotate different sleep meds every year or so to prevent them from losing their affect. Each night I took this med I would lay in bed for an hour and half_ than take a tylenol pm and lay in bed for another 2 hours and would finally get out of bed and watch tv. each night i have fallen asleep around 5am. I would strongly recommend not taking this med. you might as well just not take anything and save the money. this drug to me is like melatonin in the fact that it does nothing and obviously if a person does not need sedation to fall asleep then their insomnia is not that severe and they should probably not take anything. hopefully rozerem fails as a drug bc it is a bs med and all that it has going for it is weird commercials.,M,25,3  days,3/11/2008,Rozerem

The rest of the night I spent looking at ceiling. Almost immediately after taking the pill I started experiencing a terrible headache. The next day I spent in bed - drowsy_ sleepy_ hallucinating. Horrible experience!!! I took  Sonata before- it worked perfectly for me.,F,50,1  days,3/4/2008,Rozerem

Night terrors_ ovarian cysts_ exacerbation of mental illness.,"My doctor prescribed me Rozerem because it was the ""only"" script sleep aid that didn't react with my other medications.  Well_ the medications I take are for bi-polar_ manic depression_ severe anxiety_ and panic disorder.  After some research online_ I read that it shouldn't be prescribed to the mentally ill_ and it can affect hormones.  Since I was prescribed it_ I've had ovarian cysts_ and EXTREMELY decreased sex drive_ which my husband isn't very happy about =P_ and extreme mood swings_ even on my medications.    For the price_ I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",F,18,3  months,2/22/2008Email,Rozerem
169, 5, To regulate my sleep.,No side effects.  Vivid dreams (no nightmares) the first 2 weeks and sometimes groggy in the morning until I got used to the fact that I was simply able to get more sleep than I ever could before.,I LOVE THIS MEDICATION!!  It has been a miracle worker for me.  I noticed that most people who've posted here haven't given it long enough to make a difference.  Plus_ if they were taking something else and quit suddenly_ they probably blamed their insomnia on Rozerem.  Keep taking it.  I haven't had a single night-terror since I've been on it for one year now_ and I love getting 8_ yes 8!!_ hours of restful_ dreamy sleep each night.  No rebound insomnia if I miss a dose or stop taking it for awhile.  I take it with one quarter Tylenol pm if traveling and that works great for me.,F,48,12  months,2/21/2008,Rozerem
170, 2, Insomnia,Headache_ depression_ drowsiness_ night sweat,I have been taking Ambien CR for about a year and half_ and after consulted with my doctor_ she suggested me Rozerem. I have a history of depression and anxiety. I wanted to get off the meds for them and after almost 6 months of counseling and withdraw symptom_ and I finally got off and felt better. Well after taking Rozerem for on night_ I experienced the very familiar sensation of depression and anxiety next day and that scared the heck out of me! Not to mention after about an hour of sleep_ I kept getting up every half an hour. Next day I was so tired and feeling depressed I slept about three hours in the middle of the day. I understand I may need to give more than one day of tryout_ but I really cant take this chance getting depressed again. Im back on Ambien CR and I wont go back to Rozerem.,F,43,1  days,2/18/2008,Rozerem
171, 1, Insomnia,I was taking this with unisom and herbal melatonin and I would wake up at 12:30 a.m._ and worst of all 4:30 a.m.  And to top it off in the middle of the night I fondle my partner and have full conversations I don't remember the next day.,WTF the cost sucks and the problem has gotten worse.,M,31,2  weeks,2/8/2008Email,Rozerem

If I wasn't afraid of screwing up my little boy for the rest of his life_ I would have slit my wrists. Scared the hell out of me. I am writing this three days post Rozerem and still feel terrible. My NP has had to put me on Lexapro to get through this. I pray this feeling ends soon. You're taking a huge risk taking this med!,F,38,2  days,2/2/2008,Rozerem
173, 2, insomnia,My usual problem is falling asleep_ not staying asleep_ and I have fallen asleep about an hour after taking Rozerem.  But I wake up dozens of times during the night and feel the next day like I got about two hours of sleep_ plus nausea.  So_ I take it when I feel like otherwise I won't sleep at all_ since two hours if better than zero_ but really I couldn't say I recommend Rozerem at all.,,M,,3  days,1/25/2008,Rozerem

The only good thing was that it made me feel like I was in a trance... so I wasn't worried that I wasn't asleep. The next day I felt very groggy and terrible. I know you're supposed to give it time_ but I will NOT go through another night like that.,F,25,1  days,1/9/2008,Rozerem
178, 4, insomnia,slight headache first few days_went away,Rozerem in addition to my Zanaflex(muscle relaxer) allows me too fall asleep in about 45minutes and helps me to fall back to sleep if I wake during night. Rozerem is not a psychotrpic as many sleep meds are and I cannot take psychotropics.I do not think Rozerem would cause me to fall asleep by itself(but it is ahrd to make me sleepy). I suggest melatonin(natural OTC sleep aid like your body makes anturally) first.PEOPLE BEWARE OF PM MEDS(TYLENOL PM_BAYER PM_EXCEDRIN PM_ETC) THE 'PM' INGREDIENT IN THESE OTC MEDS IS NOTHING MORE THAT ANTIHISTAMINES!!!!

Also_ very weird dreams_ although not nightmares.,F,59,2  days,12/11/2007,Rozerem
180, 4, Insomnia,My doctor precribed Rozerem because I didn't like the hungover feeling I was getting from Ambien.  It took a good 4 weeks but finally kicked in and I started sleeping soundly--approximately 7 hours.  I can get back to sleep if I wake up.  I stopped taking it about a week ago to see how I would do and am still sleeping well.,I noticed that many of the posts on this drug only used it for 1 or a few days.  That is not enough.  You have to stay on it longer.  I would not have continued_ however_ if I had become depressed or had crazy dreams.,F,53,3  months,12/5/2007,Rozerem

My problem is_ I wake up within a couple hours and can never get back to sleep.  Rozerem_ to my delight_ works wonders.  The slightly drowsy feeling the next day is nothing compared to my exhaustion from lack of sleep.  The dreams are like watching a movie.  Every night but one_ they've all been very enjoyable.

Let's see_ I took the pill at 9:15 p.m. and it is now 1:01 a.m._ and I'm WIDE awake.  Honestly_ after three months of taking this prescription_ I will not have it renewed.

Anyhow I took ambien for 4 years works great but loses effectiveness_ I tried lunest for 2 weeks that was awful couldn't sleep at all. This stuff for me has worked wonders takes me a bit about 45 minutes but then I am fast asleep. I do wake up 1x around 3 but quickly fall asleep again. I feel so SO much better now.

And I only took Rozerem one night!,I've been on Lunesta for 2 months and my doctor wanted to wean me off by combining with Rozerem for one week.  What a terrible mistake - at my expense.  This is without a doubt the most dangerous prescription medication I have ever taken.

215, 1, Insomnia,Insomia_ intense anxiety and nausea,Terrible nightmares_ had be woken up by my fiance' and completely exhaused in the day_ I am unsure if it's because when I was sleeping I was restless or the fact that I was only sleeping a few hours...,F,29,2  days,5/29/2007,Rozerem
216, 3, Insomnia,Very little side effects. You do dream when taking Rozerem so the commericals are accurate. If only you could dream consistently for longer then 4 hours,You need to combine this drug with other sleep aids to get effective action. I sometime combine with valerian_ melatonin or over the the counter sleep aids like diphendrine.,M,40,2  weeks,5/19/2007,Rozerem
217, 1, sleep,what a weak drug ambien is so much better and this drug is very expensive,Ambien goes generic in April 2007_ the Ambien CR is still on patent.  Ambien Generic (zolpidem tartrate)Cheap Generic Drug,F,34,13  years,5/18/2007,Rozerem
218, 1, Delayed sleep onset,Helped me fall asleep earlier than usual_ but produced a very restless sleep with frequent waking.,,M,27,2  days,5/7/2007,Rozerem
219, 1, Insomnia,Insomnia_ made it worst.,This medicine is very expensive. It is not worth a dollar.  It did not work at all.  I was awake all night. It is nothing but a sugar pill. They need to take this medicine off the market. They are making money off something that does not work.  I don't have money to give away.  It was the worst nights I have had in a long time after taking this medicine.,F,51,3  days,5/3/2007,Rozerem
220, 1, insomnia,nightmares_ depression... same stuff that melatonin often often produces,Did not get any good sleep with this stuff.,F,35,2  days,5/2/2007,Rozerem
221, 1, for sleep,i experienced increased anxiety--unable to get to sleep at all_ a very dissappointing medication with major side effects_ it should be banned. its a horrible med,added and unexpected depression_ withdrawal symptoms with brief usage-a spacey feeling. very eery at best.,M,68,3  times,4/30/2007,Rozerem
222, 4, insomnia - due to pain meds,Drowsiness_ duh.,I discontinued Lunesta because it hit me hard_ knocked me out and left me stupid the next day with that horrible taste in my mouth. Doctor switched me to ROZEREM and I think it's great. It comes on gently_ and leads to a more natural sleep. I can wake up to use the bathroom and go back to sleep. I wake up in the morning with my brain intact. My only complaint is that it doesn't *always* work 100%. Some nights_ it lets me sleep_ but if I wake up I'll need a couple hours to get back to sleep again.,M,59,3  months,4/28/2007,Rozerem
223, 1, to help me fall asleep,None_ except it didn't help me fall asleep at ALL!,It didn't help me fall asleep at ALL!  It's worthless - I've had to switch to Lunesta.,F,39,20  days,4/25/2007,Rozerem
224, 1, insomnia,This drug has totally destroyed my sex drive!  My libido is shot and I cannot have an orgasm.  Also_ I'm feeling very sad and depressed much of the time---and not just because my sex life has tanked on this drug!,I can fall asleep readily if I take Rozerem but I wake up in a few hours and cannot get back to sleep.  I've taken Ambien for a long time and recently switched to Ambien CR.  I'm going back to Ambien CR.  Fewer side effects and I sleep much better.,F,47,7  days,4/16/2007,Rozerem
225, 1, Insomnia,I had great results for two weeks.Now I take it and am WIDE AWAKE all night.  Tonight was my last trial run.  This is the 4th bad night in a week.  I am positive the Rozerem has had an oppisite effect. Curse that Beaver!,,F,39,21  days,4/10/2007,Rozerem

228, 2, insomia,very restless night after taking it. Did not stay asleep made me feel very anxious.,,F,38, ,4/8/2007,Rozerem
229, 1, insomnia,Nightmares_ lack of sleep. I felt like I did not sleep all night. I have tken Ambien with good results. Thought I would try Rozerem because it was something new without being adictive. Worst night in a long long time. Try something else before you ever try this drug.  If I can help one person it would be worth this rating. I wanted to get your attention!,,M,56,1  days,4/7/2007,Rozerem
230, 2, Sleep,This medicine made me not only nauseated but dizzy and i felt like i was in a coma all night and unable to wake up.  It took me 45 mins just to make sense of my morning and left me sick to my stomach...I will stick to my xanax.,I continued to wake up thru the night and was confused throughout the evening,M,39,1  days,4/5/2007Email,Rozerem

232, 1, Insomnia,This stuff is garbage_ it felt like somebody used my brain for a soccer ball and put it back in my head before i woke up. It took me till 6PM the next day just to get up amd be somewhat functional. I will stick to taking a half a zanex to get to sleep. Rozerem bad very bad.,Stay away from Rozerem_ try something else!,M,38,1  days,3/22/2007,Rozerem
233, 5, insomnia,This med does not make me feel drugged.  I just fall to sleep.  No side effects that I know of.,,M,34,1  years,3/15/2007,Rozerem
234, 4, insomnia,No side effects,"I started taking Rozerem while coming off of Ambien CR.  My doctor said that Rozerem may work on the first night I take it_ but its full effect is seen over about two weeks time.  I have been taking it for two weeks now and although Rozerem does help me fall asleep_ it does not help me stay asleep.  I realize the drug is marketed this way_ so I am okay with that.  I have tried everything else for sleep and although some things work for a short time_ over time they stop working.  Rozerem is approved for long term use_ take it when you need it and leave it when you don't_ so I am hopeful this may help me in the long run.  I definitely do not feel hung over in the morning like I have with other sleep medications.  I also like that when I take it I do not feel sedated...I just fall asleep like a ""normal"" person.  Now if only I could stay asleep!  I will continue to take Rozerem; it has helped me.",F,40,14  days,3/11/2007Email,Rozerem
235, 2, Temporary insomnia,Headache_ dizziness_ drowsiness,I am on 150mg of Wellbutrin XL and get frequent bouts of temporary insomnia.  Rozerem helped me fall asleep but didn't keep me asleep...I still woke up once or twice during the night.  The next day_ I felt like I had the worst hangover of my life and that awful_ disconnected_ woozy feeling didn't go away until later on that afternoon.  The next night_ I was so worn out by the side-effects that I fell asleep on my own!!!,F,32,1  days,2/23/2007,Rozerem
236, 3, Insomnia,None so far.  Been taking for 1-2 weeks.,I took some samples from my doc_ and did not have any positive results.  I have been taking it for the last week_ and it has worked great for the last 4 nights.  I may have been having rebound from Lunesta before.  It is still expensive ($45.w/BCBS)_ but I will give it a shot.  I like the no side effects_ so far anyway.,M,52,2  weeks,2/17/2007Email,Rozerem
237, 4, Trouble falling to sleep,If I didn't give myself a full (at least) 8 hours of sleep-- I felt slightly hungover... but just kind of tired... But that doesn't last long.,I take Adderall and it keeps me from falling asleep sometimes... You can truly take it when you need it_ and stop when you don't--- It doesn't screw up your sleep cycle...,M,21,2  months,2/15/2007,Rozerem
238, 2, Insomnia,Really didn't notice any side effects_ except for vivid and wild dreams. You know_ like Abe_ the astronaut_ and the woodchuck.,Really didn't help me much at all. Bayer PM works as well.,M,53,1  months,1/30/2007,Rozerem

241, 2, insomnia,none,Rozerem did not seem to do much at all for me.  I only took it for a few weeks so maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance_ but I still was not sleeping well with it so I stopped it and went back to my standby_ trazodone.,F,27,3  weeks,1/20/2007,Rozerem
242, 5, Insomnia(Wellbutrin Side effect),None that I can link to this particular medication I'm also on 3mg of melatonin and 450 Welbutrin XL,I am taking 450 mg of Wellbutrin which has cut in to my sleep.  The rozerem seems to do the trick_ I also take it with Melatonin 3mg.  This is non addicting and not a narcotic so this is a plus.  Don't think there are any side effects.,F,16,3  months,1/7/2007,Rozerem
